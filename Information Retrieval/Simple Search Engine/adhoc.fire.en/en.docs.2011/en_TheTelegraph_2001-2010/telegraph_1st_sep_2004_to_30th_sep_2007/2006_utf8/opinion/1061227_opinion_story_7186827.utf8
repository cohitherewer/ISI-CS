 POISED TO TURN

 Proper discussion of the internal developments within the Bharatiya Janata Party tends to get deflected by the partys own rhetoric on Hindutva and Ram. This rhetoric was heard once again at the meeting of the national executive of the BJP held at Lucknow. This is only to be expected from a party that wears Hindutva as talisman and holds out Ram as a special charm. The loyal followers love to hear their leaders holding forth on these two subjects. The leaders also happily comply. It is the easiest way to keep the converted happy and contented. It is important to hear what is happening within the BJP, away from this noise. What was revealed in the national executive was a BJP that is more buoyant than it has ever been since it lost power in New Delhi. This optimism is based on a reading of the tea leaves of Indian politics. The BJP sees itself poised on a turnaround, which will begin, it expects, with the assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh. Its principal national rival, the Congress, is nowhere in the picture in UP. The BJP believes that if it can make the right pitch in that state and choose the right ally, the way to New Delhi might lie via Lucknow. The national executive saw the BJP team padding up for a second innings.

 One major problem facing the BJP team is an undisputed leader. The one undisputed leader, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by common consent seems to have entered his second childhood. No one has emerged from the younger leaders of the party. Mr Narendra Modi appeared to be a candidate at one time, but he is far too controversial to claim the epithet, undisputed. It is generally believed that he will be too divisive in a time of coalition politics. There are many within the sangh parivar who argue that Mr Modi might be good for Gujarat but ill-suited to lead India. The BJPs moving away from him is in itself a sign that despite the rhetoric, the party is not too keen to establish an indelible Hindutva identity. This leaves the old war-horse, Mr L.K. Advani, as the only and the obvious choice. This would have appeared inconceivable when Mr Advani needlessly mired himself in a debate about Mohammad Ali Jinnahs secularism. At that juncture, even his acolytes had turned against him. But now he has emerged as the only acceptable leader. Both the party and the leader think they are on a comeback trail. A return is not always as easy as an exit.

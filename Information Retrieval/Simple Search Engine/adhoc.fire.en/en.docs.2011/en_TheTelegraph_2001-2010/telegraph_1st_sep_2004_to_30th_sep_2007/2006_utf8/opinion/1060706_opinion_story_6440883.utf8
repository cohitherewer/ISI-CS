 INTO THE LAW

 It is difficult to talk about Guant?namo and justice in the same breath. But a recent judgment of the American Supreme Court has made it a less unlikely conjunction. The court has ruled that prisoners held at Guant?namo Bay can take their case of unlawful imprisonment to the American courts. This has been hailed, understandably, as a historic ruling by human rights organizations and the lawyers representing the prisoners. But in terms of the ultimate fate of the ?enemy combatants? held in Guant?namo and in numerous other, less known detention centres outside the US, the implications and implementation of what the court has ruled have to be considered carefully. American courts have been declared as having jurisdiction ?to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad?. Therefore the petition brought by Mr Salim Ahmed Hamden ? a Yemeni who was Mr Osama bin Laden?s driver, arrested by Afghan forces in 2001 and brought to Guant?namo ? will have to be heard, according to the Supreme Court, by the federal district court in Washington DC. This brings the entire process of the prisoner?s justice within the habeas corpus law. If a writ of habeas corpus is issued by a court, the person holding a prisoner must bring him to the court and justify his detention. 

 This ties the process not only to American constitutional law, but also to Article 5 of the Third Geneva Convention, which stipulates the setting up of a panel to determine whether a prisoner is a combatant. Both American law and the Geneva Convention were being flouted by Mr George W. Bush in the name of his ?war against terror?, which now turns out to be like any other war, bound by the legal codes of the civilized world. As one of the judges has put it, ?A state of war is not a blank cheque for the president.? However, the Supreme Court?s ruling does not guarantee the prisoners? freedom. In fact, it has also ruled that detaining American nationals and foreign citizens as enemy combatants without either charge or trial in a domestic court is lawful. But the court has helped to lift the prisoners out of the legal black hole in which they were being held indefinitely, and sometimes fatally. It has ensured that suspected combatants, whether American or foreign, should at least have the right to a hearing in an American court, even if they are being lawfully detained.

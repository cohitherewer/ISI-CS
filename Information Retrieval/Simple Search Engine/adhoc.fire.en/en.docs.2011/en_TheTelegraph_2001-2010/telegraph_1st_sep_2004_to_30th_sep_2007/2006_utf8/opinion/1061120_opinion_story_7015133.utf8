 Cause for worry

 Habits die hard 

Sir Those of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees colleagues still clinging on to a redundant ideology are bent on sabotaging his efforts at Bengals economic resurgence (Strike hard, Nov 17). Information technology has a substantial potential for employment and may help check brain drain in the state. The left leaders should keep this in mind, as also the fact that the IT sector, given its overseas commitments, cannot work as normal production units. They have round-the-clock operations which cannot be suspended at the whim of union leaders. Any failure on the industrys part would not only bring disrepute, but also jeopardize Bengals prospects of capitalizing on a sector that brings money. It is the responsibility of the government to protect the interests of the investors, especially when states are vying with each other to rope in companies. A wrong message may have disastrous results in this context. Take for example the confusion over the newly-formed West Bengal IT Services Associations role. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions attempts to make it a part of the December 14 strike will undoubtedly have a negative impact. Stringent labour laws, and not necessarily trade unions, could protect employees interests. Besides, no trade union is likely to alter the hire-and-fire policy that has become the norm today.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The debate among the leftists over whether unions in the IT sector can go on a strike has provided much entertainment. It appears that many are not aware that IT does not mean only the top brass software or hardware engineers and executives. The term IT sector should not be generalized. There are a significant number of jobs in the call centres which do not require much education or intellect areas which require physical labour like sweeping or canteen work. White-collared software engineers may not need unions, but there is no reason to forget that BPO employees sometimes work in appalling conditions. Since the supply of labour exceeds demand in this sector, employees are often at the mercy of the management. One fails to understand why they (particularly the non-technical staff) should be denied the opportunity to voice their problems at a proper forum and in an orderly manner. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh,

 Sir The Citu leaders had not spared any effort to turn the launch of the IT employees association into a gala affair. Unfortunately, they could not assure the presence of more than a thousand individuals, including the likes of auto-rickshaw drivers. There was only a handful of those actually concerned with IT. This shows the low esteem in which unionization is held by those are supposed to be in need of it. Citu has rushed the decision without trying to understand the working of the IT sector. Besides, how could Citu even think of a successful launch without the support of the CPI(M) politburo and senior leaders? 

 The organization should know that certain IT jobs will be delegated to be done at home, in case the sector is not spared from strikes. At worst, IT companies will simply shut shop here and open elsewhere. The worst losers in this scenario will be the lower grade staff. Ultimately, the state and its residents stand to lose out since no other IT company would again venture to set up office here in case the unionization worked towards the industrys detriment. Software professionals are paid well and they work hard in their own interest. They have to keep pace with technology, work overtime to get promoted or change jobs. Given their work schedule, one can safely assume, IT professionals will hardly have time for unions. Besides, there is the risk of being blacklisted as troublemakers. How many would take that chance? Radical trade unionism does not auger well for Indias position in international market. The left should not ignore this fact.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari,

 Sir Unions have successfully operated in various countries and secured employees their basic rights and essential working conditions. Even today, it is the union that protects workers in the West from mercenary capitalism and sees to it that they get health insurance, doles and so on. Bengal is perhaps the only example of a systematic industrial destruction carried out by the trade unions. It is, therefore, debatable whether a union would indeed protect and promote the interests of IT employees in this state. Without denying the exploitation IT employees are subject to, one still reserves the right to believe that a union, especially one affiliated to Citu, might make matters worse. Instead, the existing labour laws could be strictly enforced in the IT firms and a forum created for employees to voice their grievances.

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Nag, 

 Calcutta

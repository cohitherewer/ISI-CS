 RELIC OF THE PAST

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

 KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Look ahead

 Those who watched Barkha Dutts We the People on the veil must have noticed that the invited audience was largely made up of pro-hijab ladies, who applauded every statement supporting this outdated tradition. The assumption was that the burqa tradition has to be sorted out by Muslims themselves and non-Muslims should keep their mouths shut. That was a great pity. The burqa controversy cannot be restricted to Muslims alone; it concerns all of us because Muslims are an integral part of our society and we deal with them on a daily basis. Some of us, including myself, have deep emotional bonds with Muslim friends and their families. 

 I watched the programme carefully and have some comments to make on the principal participants. Shabana Azmi led those who hoped that burqas will soon be discarded. I am in entire agreement with her and regard her as a role model for Muslim girls. Owaisi, who is an MP elected by a largely illiterate, predominantly Muslim constituency of Hyderabad, is a backward-looking bigot. He proclaimed that the Quran was the word of god and had to be followed in the letter. However, he didnt say that the Quran asks women to be modestly clad, nor drape themselves from head to foot and move like mobile tents with slits before their eyes. There was an example of one sitting close to Owaisi, draped in a black burqa with only her glasses showing. From what I could see, I concluded that I wasnt missing much. 

 Then there was Ansari, doing his best to sit on a spiking fence and trying to reconcile the irreconcilable points of view. Next to her sat a pretty girl in see-through white gossamer, more seductive than anyone without a veil. The queen of the audience was no other than the neo-convert to Islam, Kamla Surayya Das. She reclined on a sofa, looking every bit the grande dame of Malayali literature. She pronounced, they pick on Muslims. 

 I agree that India has many Muslim-baiters, who have to be fought tooth and nail till they are routed. But not the way these people were going about it. No one takes Surayya Das seriously. She is what the French call a poseur one who strikes poses to impress others somewhat of a humbug. Much as I love and admire Barkha Dutt, I was disappointed by the largely one-sided approach to a live issue. However, I have a gut feeling that no matter what they say for or against the burqa, it will soon become a relic of the past.

 Free food from religion

 Jewish and Muslim friends maintain that eating pig is haraam and bad for ones health. I have been eating pork, ham, bacon, salami, sausages all my life and come to no harm. My health is as good as anyone of my age (92). Hindus and Sikhs say that eating cows meat is unpardonable sin (maha paap). Most of my Hindu and Sikh acquaintances eat beef-steaks, veal and other forms of cow meat when they are abroad. Nepalis and Hindus sacrifice buffaloes on Dussehra and eat the flesh. In Kerala, Hindu-owned restaurants serve beef to Hindu clientele. They have come to no harm. Their health has not suffered; their sins unpunished.

 Jews and Muslims assert that every animal or bird they eat should be bled to death because blood contains all kinds of diseases. So it must be halaal or kosher. I get my meat from a Muslim butcher; I also eat jhatka meat, regarded as kuttha and forbidden to Sikhs. I cant tell the difference in taste. I have not suffered any ill-effects eating both. Vegetarians maintain that all forms of meat, be it bird, beast or fish, is bad for you and you should be a shakahari eat only plants and fruits. Vegans go further and forbid bird or insect byproducts like eggs and honey. 

 I know that non-vegetarians are usually healthier and more robust than vegetarians. Furthermore, there are vegetarians who abstain from eating plants that grow under the soil so they avoid onions, garlic, ginger and other items from their dish. I find these three items add flavour to food. Dieticians will tell you that they are also good for health.

 One may well ask what in the name of god or anyone who created life has this to do with religion or moral codes of conduct? One may argue that vegetarianism is contrary to the order of nature, as apart from ruminants like cows, buffaloes, sheep goats and deer, which live on grass or leaves, all other animals birds, fish, snakes, frogs and so on live by eating each other. There are no divinely ordained rules prescribing what one should or should not eat. However, there is a moral dilemma should humans who have a choice deprive animals, fish or birds of their lives in order to feed themselves? At times I feel killing animals is against the principle of ahimsa (non-violence), which I regard as parmo dharma and should be the prime requirement of every religious belief. Yet I ignore it when I sit down to eat. I have not been able to resolve the dilemma. I am still arguing with myself.

 Monkey business

 Shastri Bhawan, New Delhi, houses the largest number of ministers with their civil servants, secretaries, joint secretaries, deputy secretaries and so on. A larger number of monkeys can also be seen around this huge complex. Monkeys often enter rooms of officials, tear up files, upturn furniture. They are known to open cupboards wherein confidential files are kept and at times it is observed that they read remarks written by the secretaries and ministers on the files of the staff retired as joint secretaries.

 A researcher in evolution of soul after death has suggested that these monkeys were joint secretaries in their earlier lives and want to know why they were not promoted to secretaries in their previous lives.

 Now that recourse to the Right to Information is available, if a few approach the authorities concerned, will their cases be considered?

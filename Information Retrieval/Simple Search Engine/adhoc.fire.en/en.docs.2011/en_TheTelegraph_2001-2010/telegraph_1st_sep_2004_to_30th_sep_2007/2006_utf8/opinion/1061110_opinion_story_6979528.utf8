The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO QUESTIONS

 Not wanting to tell and not wanting to know are equally defensive attitudes. And both have become deeply entrenched tendencies in West Bengals polity and civil society. The reasons are manifold, ranging from bureaucratic corruption and apathy to the extreme disempowerment of the poor and the illiterate. In most cases, however, lack of access to information is of great advantage to a government and state administration naturally wary of transparency and slow to react to innovations in governance. It is no surprise, therefore, that West Bengal has turned out to be the worst implementer of the Right to Information Act, according to the Central Information Commission. The state governments complete unseriousness about the implications of the act is evident in the fact that its official website omits any mention of the state information commission set up under the act a year ago. Other websites on the RTI Act give the wrong address and a defunct phone number for West Bengals SIC, which is woefully understaffed and struggling to cope with the flood of applications (which is a good sign). The ministries and departments do not have public information officers, and important institutions like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation have no appellate authorities.

 Indifference to accountability and dread of transparency are alarming tendencies in any government. They breed apathetic civic values, and create situations of helplessness and criminal irresponsibility, as is often seen in the states hospitals. A damaging rural-urban divide also characterizes inequalities of access to public information. Alert, active and critical citizenship is essential to a healthy democracy, and neglecting the RTI Act keeps in place systems of ignorance, and hence oppression, which endorse existing relations of power between those who know and those who do not. There is bound to be a fundamental flaw in the governance of a state that prizes information technology above everything else but is indifferent to its citizens right to information.

 Letters to Editor

 Blinkered view

 Sir? It seems that Ashok Mitra lacks a clear knowledge of the nature of the anti-reservation protests held by medical students recently (?Merit and milieu?, June 9). He says that ?the urban middle and upper classes, whose progeny are leading the ongoing campaign, do not make up more than 10 to 15 per cent of the population?. Mitra should be reminded that the protest was against reservations in educational institutions on the basis of caste, not class. While a candidate coming from a scheduled caste or tribe might well belong to a middle or upper class family, there are several upper caste families that belong to the lower economic strata of society. Has Mitra imagined what would happen to families of the second kind if reservation on the grounds of caste becomes effective? The advocates for reservation in India, especially those from the moneyed classes, should do well to assess what they have done for the underprivileged with whom they profess to sympathize now. Snatching away jobs from deserving students and giving them to the ?underprivileged?, even if they do not merit it, will do nothing to improve the condition of the backward classes. On the other hand, it will cause havoc to the existing social structure, already ridden with inefficiency. The issue of reservations needs to be looked at in a broader perspective, and beyond electoral calculations. If reservations are to be implemented, the government should first find out the exact population of each caste, and then reserve seats in direct proportion to the population.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Kumar Sinha, Calcutta 

 Sir? All those who protested against reservations were surely not children of affluent families, eager to defend their exclusivity, as Ashok Mitra claims. Many of them hailed from middle-class families that had worked hard to provide a secure future for their children. In a country with a dismal literacy rate, reserving a few hundred seats in leading institutes is nothing but an attempt by the Central government to cover up its failure to provide education to all. If the ?underprivileged? really need to be helped, then they should be taught to stand on their own rather than being provided with crutches in the form of reservations in jobs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sirish Agarwal, Calcutta

 Sir? If the affluent classes comprise only 10 to 15 per cent of our population after almost 60 years of independence ? as Ashok Mitra says ? then shouldn?t the government be blamed for being unable to improve the general economic condition of the masses? Trying to help the economically backward now by reserving seats cannot be a solution to the problems plaguing the country.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Sarkar, Calcutta 

 Sir? Ashok Mitra should ask himself a simple question: if a student from the backward classes can reach the stage of sitting for professional examinations without the benefit of reservations in primary schools or colleges, then why should he need to have seats reserved for him in the institutes of management and medicine? Besides, why is reservation demanded in medical and management institutions only and not in the others? Do politicians believe that by artificially producing a few hundred doctors or business school graduates, the condition of the backward classes can be bettered?

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir? Since reservations have been proposed along caste lines, the son of a rich man like Mulayam Singh Yadav (who has assets worth more than 100 crore) will be preferred to a boy, say, from a lower middle class family who, unfortunately, does not to belong to a scheduled caste. Can?t Ashok Mitra notice the obvious anomalies in the policy of reservation?

 Yours faithfully,

Debasish Bhattacharjee, Guwahati

 Sir? Ashok Mitra obviously has no idea of the stiff competition students face these days trying to enter into MBBS courses. This competition can only become tougher once reservations become effective. While the policy will make life for ?non-reserved? students more difficult, those from the backward classes will gain undue advantage. But the benefit that the latter will enjoy will not necessarily make them the best in their fields when they start their careers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manas Kumar Roy, Calcutta

 Sir? Ashok Mitra talks about ?desperate human minds? that always look for ?escape hatches?. He himself belongs to this category, since he has chosen to write on reservation only after the Supreme Court intervention. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Lahari Chatterji, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir? With reference to the report, ?Mukesh eyes TV business? (June 11), the British Broadcasting Corporation would like to clarify that it distributes a wide range of its programmes and services through partnerships, especially internationally. It is regularly in discussion with potential partners. These discussions are commercially sensitive and always confidential until agreements are finalized with contracts agreed by both parties. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deeptie Sethi, senior press and public relations manager, India, BBC World

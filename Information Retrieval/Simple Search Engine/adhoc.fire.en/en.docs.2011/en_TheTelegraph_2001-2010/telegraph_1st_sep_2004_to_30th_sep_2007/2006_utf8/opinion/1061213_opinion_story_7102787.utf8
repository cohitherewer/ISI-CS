 A METROPOLIS AND ITS CURIOUS BODY LANGUAGE

 The physical changes that the city is undergoing should make Calcuttans wary of what the politicians are preaching, write Bonani and Pradeep Kakkar

 Blot on the shine 

 Body language is fascinating. Verbal language may be colourful and articulate but body language is invariably honest. Communication researchers discovered decades ago that dilated pupils and sweaty palms are better indicators of interest in what people are watching than the verbal responses they may give. Avoiding eye-contact during an interview has sunk many a job- hunter. Drooping shoulders, a furrowed brow and arms crossed over the chest may reveal what is really going on in a persons mind better than the words coming out of the mouth. 

 Calcuttans listening to the words coming from their elected leaders and watching the body language of the physical changes in their city might wonder what to believe. Consider the following: about a year ago, no less a spokesperson than the chief minister of the state announced that rickshaws would be banned because the citys image needed to be improved. Even before the simplicity of this assumption could sink in, the same image strategists had decided that graffiti on the citys walls whether house owners wanted it or not was a good way to establish what a vibrant and democratic metropolis this is. 

 And while we drive the rickshaw pullers off the streets, we are quite happy inviting hawkers to peddle their wares on pavements. The mayor has announced that officially demarcated stretches of footpaths, originally meant for pedestrians, will be licensed out to hawkers. The fact that this will force people to walk on carriageways and increase the risk of their being struck by yet another speeding bus is of no concern to those who claim to know what is best for Calcutta. After all, the money generated from fees that hawkers pay for renting footpaths can always be used for the next flyover; worse, they could put in some more child-crushing buses.

 Speeding buses and flyovers...observe the body language while the words harp on the same old claims of being a cultural capital and haven for intellectuals. Over the past five years, in the name of speedier traffic flow, we have seen several dozen beautiful old mahogany trees ruthlessly chopped (as the flyover ascended over Park Circus), an architectural treasure permanently disfigured (as yet another flyover blocked out the Indian Museum on Chowringhee), and a vibrant and historically important market virtually rubbed off the citys map by the unending construction of an automated parking lot. Anyone remember the New Market?

 In many cities around the world, public transport is being given encouragement by preferred right of way and special lanes. In Calcutta, we have dereserved tram tracks on several streets, making the use of trams less attractive. Perhaps, this is part of the image-makers exit strategy for Calcuttas trams. 

 But while the trams trundle towards uncertainty, the Howrah Bridge seems to be destined for brighter nights. The newly-installed lights have added enormously to the iconic status of the bridge, even though the voltage may have dropped a bit when the governor, Gopal Krishna Gandhi, remarked at the inaugural function that there are unfed and out-of-school kids sleeping under the structure. The Calcutta Port Trust, nevertheless, was happy to have spent a few crores on demonstrating how the city is now resurgent and power surplus; never mind the crumbling warehouses it owns less than a hundred metres away that cry for a few drops of resurgence tonic. Several ministerial trips have been made to London to study the Thames redevelopment but the pathetic warehouses, potential heritage treasures if wisely reused, continue to plead for restoration. 

 But the plea for restoration has to be made rather carefully. Calcuttas Maidan long acknowledged as the citys lungs and completely out of bounds for so-called development efforts needed restoration after being mauled for years by metro and flyover builders. The army, blissfully uncaring while long stretches of the green had turned into open toilets for platoons of construction workers, decided that the best way to restore the Maidan was to hand over several acres to the house of Tata who promptly converted it into a park, cordoned it off and levied an entry fee. 

 Then, too, the chief minister promised at the inaugural ceremony that the entire Maidan would be converted into several parks under the profitable care of corporate houses. The simple fact that the citys largest open green area should be kept as an integral, natural and regularly maintained Commons for all segments of residents had not dawned on the leaders until the NGOs went to court. 

 Attacks on the citys environmental assets have been the strongest evidence of divergence between the words of Calcuttas political leadership and their body language. The much-heralded East Calcutta Wetlands Management and Conservation Authority, headed by the chief secretary and including fourteen departmental secretaries and agency heads, has turned out to be a complete charade. Since it was established in November 2005 with the objective of protecting and conserving the wetlands, a huge warehouse for Metro, a German cash-and-carry operation, has been permitted in the wetlands buffer zone. 

 A shopping plaza has also been announced by the mayor on the plea that it will have no environmental impact.It was only two years ago, on World Environment Day, that the chief minister had very eloquently promised to protect the same wetlands. That both these projects are violations of the Ramsar Convention, the international agreement protecting wetlands to which India is a signatory, and are going to be challenged in the courts by environmentalists is secondary to the overriding question of where Calcutta is going. 

 It is obvious that somewhere along the way, the aspirations of Calcuttas politicians have caused their disconnection with what has always been the essence of the city inclusiveness, sensitivity to life beneath the cosmetic and a resulting spontaneous warmth for fellow human beings. While Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his image strategists may have their sights set on the investor even better if he is foreign they have much to learn about image-building. Not only does image-building need clarity of thinking, proactive creation and reinforcement of associations, but, above all, it also needs to be anchored to reality. 

 The reality of body language, not easy words.

 KEEPING STATE SECRETS

 Malvika Singh

 I was speaking to a civil servant the other day who was rather disturbed by the cabinet decision to keep file notings outside the purview of the right to information. This was such an enlightened position that one had to pinch oneself to make sure one was hearing correctly. I asked for the reason and was told that all notings made must be thought through carefully and must stand scrutiny under the prevailing laws and norms of functioning. Therefore no bureaucrat, unless he or she is doing slipshod work, should feel vulnerable about such scrutiny. Well, that said it all. It proved that todays administrators are playing politics and therefore want secrecy and protection. Clean and appropriate functioning has become a thing of the past as babus scurry about, trying to please their ministers, doing their bidding. They are more concerned about improving their own position in the hierarchy than doing the job assigned to them.

 We can see the deterioration around us, a direct result of this criminal lethargy. Everything that is controlled by the bureaucracy, that has ceased to be accountable, is in a royal mess. The National Museum is a shame rather than an oasis of pride, as are the state museums. The pre-independence era had more to offer than anything we have done in the last sixty years. This modern regime of babus has gradually, but consistently, obliterated excellence from our midst. The national and state archives are shamefully devoid of a semblance of respectful conservation, and there has been hardly any addition to the papers from the time the British left the shores of India. Future historians will find a gaping hole in the information about governance, policies, decision-making, development, schemes, et al, of this period. It is scary because it is so utterly illiterate and unthinking, so base.

 Fall in line

 All our other museums, heritage sites that were usurped by governments and deemed national properties, almost all learning institutions controlled by the government and its representatives, are in a pathetic condition, manned by people who are merely marking time as they lobby for more lucrative postings. Their otherwise lazy minds seem to become agile and creative when used to evolve fresh techniques for self-aggrandizement at the cost of the job at hand. The same minds become mean and small, negative and often vindictive when dealing with issues that affect the anonymous people of this land. Small wonder the babus want secrecy when it comes to notings on a file! And it is not surprising that their political bosses want the same since the two are in cahoots as they destroy the bureaucratic framework, the ethics of integrity and service, as well as the values that our culture, civilization and people would like to live by.

 The fact that this bureaucracy and political class do not give the citizens the remotest confidence of being able to deliver clean, good governance, shows them up as traitors to the cause. Equally, prime ministers and their council of ministers come and go without any action being initiated on the ground to alleviate corruption and to ruthlessly restructure a corroded and ineffective bureaucracy that is detrimental to progress and which jeers at integrity and honesty. 

 A new generation of Indians have learned to beat the system and get on with their lives. Sadly, most bribe their way, thereby keeping the babu well-fed and happy, and most important, out of the way. Those who do not fall in line, who believe that they will fight to do it right, are mauled and harassed. From the prime minister up and down and sideways, India knows this truth well since it has to deal with this frightful disease. Why does no one stand up and start the process to put an end to the laws that nurture only those who have ceased to govern and administrate?

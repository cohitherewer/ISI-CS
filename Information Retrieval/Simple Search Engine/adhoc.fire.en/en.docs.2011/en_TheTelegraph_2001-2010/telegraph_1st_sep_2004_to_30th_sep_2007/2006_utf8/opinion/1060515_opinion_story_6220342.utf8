 Message in the mandate

 Sir ? The huge victory of the Left Front in West Bengal this time is a mandate for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his liberal and reformist approach to governance. Of course, it is also a victory made easy by the complete lack of a credible opposition in the state. Mamata Banerjee instils no confidence in either the old or the young voters in the state. She should realize that she cannot win elections by sitting in the middle of roads and holding up traffic or by loud street-corner speeches. She appears to have no knowledge whatsoever of economics, governance, and the kind of managerial skills required to run an administration. As long as Banerjee is the only opposition in the state, the Left Front can be assured of victory in all future polls. As for the left, this victory is certainly not an endorsement of a dead Marxist philosophy or the kind of anti-reform stand that the party takes at the Centre. It is a positive vote for the strong reformist agenda that Bhattacharjee has set. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? While a decent, intelligent and hardworking chief minister like Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his team must be congratulated for having won so convincingly, they should also be reminded of the heightened expectations of the people. The first among them is that the ruling party should not grow too smug and arrogant (especially at the grassroots level); second, that all the deadwood in the government would be removed; third, that we should soon begin to see concrete evidence of the new development programme percolating down to the masses; fourth, that the law-and-order situation will improve; fifth, that power and water might become more easily and reliably available; sixth, that something might be done about the burgeoning population, the root of most of our problems; seventh, that serious steps might be taken to check and reverse the massive environmental degradation that has already taken place; and finally, that many more opportunities might be created for talented people in both the arts and the sciences, so that the exodus of bright young minds to other states and abroad might be checked. This might sound like a tall order, but without these, Bhattacharjee?s dream of Bengal again leading the country will never materialize, and that is sure to take an electoral toll sooner or later.

 Yours faithfully,

Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur

 Sir ? It is not the image of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that helped the Left Front come to power for the seventh time in a row in West Bengal. The real reason is the lack of an organized opposition in the state. The so-called slogan of development and industrialization of the previous government, headed by Bhattacharjee himself, has proved to be completely hollow. In the name of development, the government is forcefully occupying the land of poor farmers, destroying their livelihood, while giving promoters and foreign firms absolute freedom to build shopping malls, flats and multiplexes for the rich. Slum-dwellers and hawkers are being evicted in the name of beautification and development. To talk about rehabilitation is blasphemy. However, there is no real industrialization happening. Bhattacharjee has brought some investment in the services sector, particularly in IT and retail. But nothing has been done for the manufacturing sector. As a matter of fact, around 65,000 factories have closed down, resulting in millions losing their jobs. Of around 7.5 million registered unemployed people in the state, the so-called IT boom has been able to provide jobs for only 40,000 or thereabouts. Therefore, if the people have voted for him, it was not for ?Brand Buddha? but because they had no alternative. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Hope Redeemed? (May 12), says that the election results indicate that ?the signals for economic reforms should henceforth emanate from West Bengal. The laggard state of the past should act as the model state for the future and for the whole of India.? But will this be possible? It is unlikely, because the hardliners within the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will continue to clip Bhattacharjee?s reformist wings from time to time. However, if the people have voted for him, it also means that if he yields to the pressure of ideologues, then the same people who have chosen him will throw him out. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? The editorial ?Hope redeemed?, seems too optimistic. The revival of the decaying industrial infrastructure of Bengal is not an easy proposition. It is an even longer way for Bengal to set the pace for the country. Forgotten in the poll euphoria is that the industries, in order to survive and flourish in Bengal with an international credibility, would require employees sound in both mind and body, capable of overseeing the growth and consolidation of industries in the long run. In Bengal, except a few schools in the urban areas, most lack basic infrastructure and teachers. Add to this the wrong-headed policy of abolishing English at the primary level. These have left emerging professionals in the state unable to land the best jobs in the best firms; their peers from the rest of the country beat them in the race. These apart, the poor state of health, the growing chasm between the haves and have-nots will be difficult to mend. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bijit K.Sarkar, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 It seems to be the season of birthdays. Sharad Pawar turned 66 recently, and politicians from Maharashtra headed north to pay homage to the Maratha strongman. Even Vilasrao Deshmukh found a reason to greet Pawar without setting tongues wagging. He said that he was off to Delhi to lay the foundation stone for the new Maharashtra Sadan. The state assembly wore a deserted look but the opposition, busy celebrating the birthday of Gopinath Munde, had no reasons to complain. In Delhi, Congressmen too celebrated Sonia Gandhis birthday, with senior leaders carrying presents for their beloved Madam, who, for once, appeared smiling and indulgent. The same evening, BJPs Vijay Goel threw a party. When a cheeky journo asked him whether he was celebrating Madams birthday, a stony-faced Goel replied that the bash was in honour of Shahnawaz Hussain, who had recently won the by-polls at Bhagalpur.

 Meanwhile, a Congressman has got into trouble on the account of birthdays. Salman Khurshid is in a spot of bother, with a section of the Muslim clergy issuing a fatwa against him. Ironically, a fellow Congressman from Kanpur sought a fatwa against the UPCC chief after he attended a yajna to mark his sixtieth birthday. This is not the first time that Khurshid has got into trouble for displaying his secular credentials. A few years back, he had angered Muslim leaders by gifting bottles of gangajal during a party workshop. But Khurshid should not be entirely unhappy over the incident. He may not be able to write as well Rushdie, but he can at least claim that the two of them share a similar fate. But the party leaders have found no reason to share Khurshids happiness. They know that winning the polls in UP is impossible with a divided house.

 Not just birthdays but our politicians are also having problems with news channels. Recently a television channel claimed that LK Advani had stated that he would take up the top job of the country if his party attained a position to form the government. The lauha purush, according to the channel, had also said that Atalji, the grand old man of the party, was unlikely to propose his name for the top job even if the party had the numbers with it. Predictably, Advanis comments raised a storm in political circles, with virtuous leaders denouncing his show of ambition. But the winds died down soon after as it came to light that the television channel had taken liberties to sex up the interview to raise TRPs. 

 Another channel has been facing the heat, albeit for different reasons. Crores have been spent on the Lok Sabha channel, but it has come to no avail. The channel often falls back on insipid programmes or old footage for want of fresh content. This often leads to a comedy of errors. Vijendra Pal Singh was told by an acquintance that he had watched Singh deliver a speech at an unearthly hour. On another occasion, the man in charge of the Tibetan Centre had some people telling him that they were surprised to find him elaborating on the Tibetan Cultural Week on the LS channel. What these poor people did not know was that the channel had only recycled old footage, something that it manages to do quite well.

 Madhya Pradesh governor Balram Jakhar decided to touch base after a round of shooting from the lips. Jakhar had recently threatened to shoot (sack) chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan if he failed to deliver. The BJP returned fire and threatened to approach the president on this matter. Jakhar developed cold feet and turned to fellow Jat, Som Pal, for help. The former Union minister advised the governor to douse the flames, forcing Jakhar to blow on the peace pipe. In the end, things turned out rather well for Jakhar after returning from his trip, the CM even descibed him as a respectable figure. Last heard, our man had quietly left for Abhor, his hometown in Punjab. Perhaps he was picking up a few more survival tips from the wise Jats.

 They say that the way to a man rsquo;s heart is through his stomach. Members of the Congress party seem to have realized this at last. Party leaders, desperate to get hold of Rahul Gandhi, have started to frequent a restaurant called Sagar Ratna, which happens to be his favourite eatery. The restaurant literally teems with Congress workers at all hours, as they spend their time devising ways to draw the attention of their favourite leader once he steps in for a meal. It is not known how Rahul feels about eating in a crowded place. But those who run the restaurant surely has no reasons for complaint. After all, the going has never been so good for the business. 

 Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan need not fear the stars anymore. For Lalu Prasad has come to their rescue. The railways minister apparently asked Amar Singh, a close friend of the Bachchans, whether a marriage between the Small B and the reigning queen of Bollywood was really on the cards. Singh, uncharacteristically, chose to stay mum. But there was no stopping Lalu Prasad. He went on to say that Rai should first marry a peepul tree and then get married to Abys baby. (That is how they do it in Bihar, he explained). That way, she would be able to transfer the misfortunes that come with being a manglik on to her first husband. Even such brilliant advice seemed to have no effect on Singh who still remained silent. Before parting ways, Lalu Prasad did not forget to remind the SP leader that he would be expecting invitation cards for the wedding, whenever it took place. Singhs response to this one is not known.

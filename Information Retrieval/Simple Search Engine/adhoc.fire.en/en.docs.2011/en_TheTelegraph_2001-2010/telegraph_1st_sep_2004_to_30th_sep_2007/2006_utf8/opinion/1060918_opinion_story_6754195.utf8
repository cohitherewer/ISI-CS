 BURN SOME POPPIES

 GWYNNE DYER

 Most people in Afghanistan are farmers. If Hamid Karzais Western-backed government in Kabul is to survive, it must have their support. So not destroying their main cash crop should be an obvious priority for Karzais foreign supporters. But what the hell, lets go burn some poppies.

 We need to realise that we could actually fail here, said David Richards, British commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan, last week. In south-western Afghanistan, where 7,000 British, Canadian and Dutch troops were committed during the summer to contain a resurgent taliban, the guerrillas now actually stand and fight. In the past month, Britain and Canada have lost about half as many soldiers killed in Afghanistan as the United States of America lost in Iraq in the same time, out of a combat force perhaps one-tenth as big. 

 Concern in Europe about Western casualties in Afghanistan is already so great that none of the Nato countries was willing to commit more troops to the fighting when their defence chiefs met in Belgium on September 13, despite an urgent appeal from Richards for 2,500 more combat troops. Most of them just do not believe that a few thousand more troops will save the situation in Afghanistan. 

 The rapid collapse of the taliban government in the face of Americas air power and its locally purchased allies in late 2001 created a wholly misleading impression that the question of who controls the country had been settled. Afghanistan has always been an easy country to invade but a hard country to occupy. Resistance to foreign intervention takes time to build up, but the Afghans defeated British occupation(twice) and a Soviet occupation when those empires were at the height of their power, and they are well on the way to doing it again. 

 Double trouble

 The various warlords who allied themselves with the US are the real power in Afghanistan, and in the traditional opium-producing areas in the south, they have encouraged a return to poppy-farming in order to get some cash flow. Poor farmers, struggling under staggering loads of debt, were happy to co-operate and by now, Afghanistan is producing about 90 per cent of the worlds opium, the raw material for heroin.

 Thats the price you pay for disrupting the established order, and the US should just have paid it. There is no point in destroying poppies in Afghanistan, because they will just get planted elsewhere. Even if it is ideologically impossible for the US to end its foolish, unwinnable war on drugs, it should have turned a blind eye in Afghanistan.

 But it did not. For the past five years, a shadowy outfit called DynCorps has been destroying the poppy fields of southern Afghanistans poorest farmers with US and British military support. This was an opportunity taliban could not resist, and the alliance between taliban fighters and poppy farmers is at the root of the resurgent guerrilla war in the south. 

 It begins to smell like the last phase of a classic anti-colonial war, when the guerrillas start winning and local players begin to hedge their bets. After taking heavy casualties, Pakistan has agreed with the tribes of Waziristan to withdraw its troops from the lawless province, giving taliban a secure base in Afghanistans border. Karzai, seeking allies who will help him survive the eventual pull-out of Western troops, is appointing gangsters and drug-runners as local police chiefs and commanders. The futile war on drugs will drag on endlessly elsewhere, but if the foreigners legalized cultivation of opium poppies in Afghanistan, they might just break the link between taliban and the farmers. Otherwise, the first Afghan cities will probably start falling into taliban hands very soon.

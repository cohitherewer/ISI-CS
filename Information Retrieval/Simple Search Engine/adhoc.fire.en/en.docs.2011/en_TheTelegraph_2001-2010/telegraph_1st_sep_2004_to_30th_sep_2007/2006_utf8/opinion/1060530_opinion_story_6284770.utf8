The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BAD SHOW

 Foresight leads to preemptive action. The new Left Front government failed on both counts when, last week, a team from Tata Motors faced a protest in Singur where they had gone to inspect the land that has been allotted to the company. It was obvious that the state and local administrations as well as the apparatus of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) were unaware that such a protest was in the offing. This lack of awareness is amazing and, not to put too fine a point on it, very embarrassing for the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. When land under the plough is being given for industrial development, some amount of grievance and protest is inevitable and unavoidable. It is the task of good political managers to skilfully diffuse such unrest. It is normal in West Bengal to expect such political management from the CPI(M), especially when it suits their purpose to do so. Exactly the opposite happened. It could have been a case of complacency, or even of poor intelligence-gathering, on the part of the local cadre. Whatever the reason, the incident sent out the worst possible signals about the investment climate in the state and the intentions of the Left Front government. What makes it worse is the fact that a meeting of the Tata team and the protesters could have been easily avoided. The incident showed off West Bengal at its most incompetent.

 The incident has also brought back into public discussion a rather spurious controversy. This relates to the use of agricultural land for new industries. In the case of Singur, the land is also fertile agricultural land since it yields two crops. The terms of this controversy are flawed. The issue is not about agriculture versus industry. It is about the most productive use of the land. Productive in terms of the value it adds to the state?s economy by way of income and employment. Thus even fertile agricultural land can be put to more productive use by making it the site of an industrial plant. The people who previously tilled the land or lived on it can be adequately compensated by the state government through jobs and money or both. The state government has already given an assurance that such compensation packages are being worked out. A process of economic development involves a shift in the pattern of land use from agriculture to industry. This process is beginning, if belatedly, in West Bengal. It should not be allowed to be hamstrung by local-level protests.

 Both at the level of the government and the party, the issues emerging out of a new and favourable investment climate in the state need to be clarified. As more industrial investments begin to flow into the state, the question of acquiring more agricultural land for industrial ventures will become more urgent. Now is the time to clear the decks.

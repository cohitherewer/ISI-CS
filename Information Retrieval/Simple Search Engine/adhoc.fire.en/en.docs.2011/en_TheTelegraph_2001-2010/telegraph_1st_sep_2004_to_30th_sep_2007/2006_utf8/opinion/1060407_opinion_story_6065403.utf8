 SEEKING A NEW DIRECTION

 Fresh start

 The movement for women?s liberation, writes Brenner, has passed through various phases that have been characterized by extraordinary gains as well as irreversible set backs. In the present century, the women?s liberation movement has to organize itself to meet new challenges in order to avoid a political impasse, says Brenner. According to the author, ?intersectionality? has to emerge as the new analytical strategy for such movements, so that working-class women can organize themselves across race, ethnicity, territoriality and sexual preferences.

 A historical materialist explanation of gender begins with how a specific society aligns collective human labour along with emergent power relations. Marxists have focused primarily on the production of things while Marxist feminists have broadened this notion by including care and nurturing of people ? which is also known as ?social reproduction?. 

 Gender division of labour in capitalist societies takes place through the nuclear family household. Domesticated labour is central to the oppression of women in capitalism. This oppression is not just a product of working class men?s interest but also a result of the internalization of patriarchal domination by females. In the nineteenth century, human biology and the structures of capitalist profit further constrained the conditions of working class women. Combining wage work and motherhood was extremely difficult but these conditions forced them to wage a struggle against their capitalist employers and the emerging state.

 In the twentieth century, further pressure from women labourers and the availability of gadgets that make it easier for women to work a double day laid the basis for new forms of organization and struggle. The different periods of capitalist development led to changes in the organization of social reproduction and the mobilization of middle class and working class women. In the normal course of things, survival projects created group loyalties, solidarities and lived interdependencies, whether at work or in domestic or community networks.

 Capitalist economy shaped the emergence of feminism in the Sixties, its successful spread and institutionalization in the Seventies and Eighties, and its saturation in the Nineties. Feminist movements have been successful in dismantling the system of legalized, intentional exclusion of women from key economic and political institutions but only upper and middle class women have reaped the benefits from this. And as capitalist economic power increases globally and locally, there has been an increase in income stagnation, deterioration of work life, heightened insecurity, the emergence of a competitive job market, cuts in public services and social safety nets.

 Brenner concludes by asserting that the development of an anti-racist working class feminist politics should be the basis for a renewed feminist movement. The future progress of women?s movement depends not just on the unification of women from different socio-economic backgrounds but also on the active cooperation of men. 

 A few articles in this particular book are reprints while some other pieces have been co-authored. Based mainly on secondary literature, this volume would be useful for students and researchers of gender studies and economic sociology.

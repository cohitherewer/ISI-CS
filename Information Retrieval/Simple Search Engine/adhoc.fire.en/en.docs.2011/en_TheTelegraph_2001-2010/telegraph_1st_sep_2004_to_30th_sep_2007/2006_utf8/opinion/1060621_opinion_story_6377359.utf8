 TRADE WINDS

 Revisiting old ties is sometimes a good way of forging new ones. When the ancient Silk Route is re-opened at Nathu-la next month, it will truly be a great leap forward for relations between India and China. It is an old trade route across the high Himalayas, but trade is only a small part of the real story. When the former prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, mooted the idea of the re-opening of the route at Nathu-la during his visit to Beijing in June, 2003, he had a larger vision of relations between the two countries. The fact that New Delhi and Beijing have sincerely worked on the idea since then suggests the new climate of mutual trust. For 44 years since the 1962 war between the two countries, the fenced border at Nathu-la stood as a sad testimony to a time of hostility. The re-opening of the Nathu-la road is, therefore, symbolic of a new beginning. According to an estimate by the Sikkim government, the volume of trade through Nathu-la could rise from Rs 200 crore in 2007 to Rs 2,200 crore by 2010 and to Rs 12,000 crore by 2015. For China too, Nathu-la could mean a road to the Calcutta port for the land-locked Tibetan plateau. All that is, however, a footnote to the main story about the changing times. 

 It is no coincidence that the revival of the Nathu-la route will come within two weeks of the visit of the defence minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, to China. Both countries wanted to live in peace and neither posed a threat to the other, he said on his return. That is a far cry from the threat perception about China that has shaped India?s strategic thinking for long. The former defence minister, Mr George Fernandes, articulated that strategic position when he had identified China as India?s ?enemy number one?. Although he later diluted his opinion, his remark caused a diplomatic row, which the two countries took care to mend subsequently. In the last few years, the two nations have steadily opened new vistas of understanding on several issues that marred their relations in the past. The issue of the disputed border is the most important of them. The agreement on reviving trade across the Nathu-la pass was itself the long-awaited Chinese acceptance of Sikkim as part of India. India reciprocated this by accepting the Tibet Autonomous Region as part of China. 

 This spirit of mutual accommodation has since become the basis of the ?guiding principles? for the border talks. Several rounds of these talks have been held since the ?guiding principles? were accepted during Mr Vajpayee?s visit to Beijing. Irrespective of how the border talks go, the important thing is that both countries now rule out armed conflicts as an option for solving the border dispute. Some irritants still partially cloud India?s relations with China. Beijing?s military help to Pakistan is one irritant. But hopes seem to outweigh anxieties for the moment.

 WHERE A CAT CANNOT LOOK AT THE QUEEN

 OPEN LETTER

 Two silly girls and the prime minister?s men

 Dear Mr Prime Minister, I know you are shy and men who are shy feel deeply uncomfortable in the company of unknown women. Aren?t you secretly relieved that two silly girls ? Yogita and Bina ? didn?t manage to reach you after all? What could you have said to two flighty denim-clad females?

 Lest you think this is another frivolous woman writing a frivolous letter, let me assure you that this letter is really about more important matters than how you should conduct yourself with women. But first, I want to share an experience with you.

 In June 2004, I was in London, and my itinerary included visits to the Westminster and 10 Downing Street. We were at the Westminster in time for the prime minister?s question hour. We were lucky, because Tony Blair had returned from an overseas trip that morning, or we?d have had to watch his deputy field questions.

 I was prepared to make my mental comparison with the Lok Sabha ? as seen on Doordarshan, of course ? praise the crisp English of the British MPs and get on with my day. But that was not to be. Before the verbal duels could get hot, a fine purple haze descended on the chamber. It was the handiwork of Ron Davies (we later found out), a Fathers4Justice activist, who had chosen this novel way to demand greater access to his children. 

 We were briskly herded out, but throwing a pinch of gulal from the galleries seemed quite an innocent prank, given that in India, MPs and MLAs throw furniture at one another when they are in the mood. It was only after we emerged into the lobby, where speculations were flying thick and fast, that we woke up to the possibility of the powder being anthrax. 

 Now this was a whole new angle on security threats. But there was something even more unsettling in this new vision: the realization that it could easily have been one of us. Davies had been sitting in the same enclosure as we were, and had passed through the same security check as we had. And no amount of metal detection and frisking and screening can ferret out a tiny condom and some purple powder hidden on one?s body. 

 Yes, Mr Singh, it is very easy to breach the security of your residence if one wants to and, I am afraid, the men in charge of your safety will always end up nabbing those who mean no harm. When the men with evil designs decide to attack, your security establishment can do nothing but watch ? and play at damage control later.

 If I can get back briefly to Westminster, when we filed out of the red-alerted premises, we heard that Blair had told Michael Howard, the leader of the opposition, ?I promise I didn?t organize that, Michael.? Howard had replied, ?For once, I believe you.?

 Why can?t we have a little bit of this spirit in our public life too? Why must so much importance be given to two young air-hostesses driving into 7, Race Course Road when it is abundantly clear that threatening you or your safety were farthest from their minds? Your own office has said more than once that there was no security breach. And yet, both the girls were arrested and must have been grilled about everything under the sun ? from their board examination marks to their distant uncle?s profession. And, most important, both have lost their jobs, although they were off-duty when they went on their little adventure.

 Have you read Evelyn Waugh?s Vile Bodies, Mr Prime Minister? If you have, then you might recall the uproarious episode where Miss Runcible ? dressed as a wild Hottentot woman ? and her friends troop into 10 Downing Street, casually asked in by the prime minister?s daughters. They have all the eggs in the prime ministerial kitchen and go off to sleep in one of the many bedrooms. Miss Runcible, much like Yogita and Bina, is horrified to find herself (still in her grass skirt) at the centre of media attention the next morning.

 Are you going to say now that this is fiction? But what about the man who, in 1982, scaled the walls and drainpipe of Buckingham Palace and landed straight in the queen?s bedroom? The queen was sweet enough to talk to him for a good ten minutes. One intruder claimed the queen was his ?mum? ? just as Yogita claimed she was your niece. I have been inside 10 Downing Street when Blair was very much in his den, and securing entry did not seem like an ordeal. 

 True, in America, police arrest unarmed people for using the White House pavement. But then, all is not well with the West. 

 And poor Yogita and Bina are not the least like Hottentots. All they wanted to do was say hello to you. Isn?t that even a wee bit flattering? Don?t you think you should call them over for a Punjabi dinner at 7 RCR? And do please ask the securitymen to be nice to the girls.

 Yours sincerely,

 SREYASHI DASTIDAR

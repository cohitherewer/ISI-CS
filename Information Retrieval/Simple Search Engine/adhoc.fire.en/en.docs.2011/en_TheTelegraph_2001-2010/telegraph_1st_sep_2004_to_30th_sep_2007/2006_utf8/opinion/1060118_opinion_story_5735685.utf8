 COMING TO TERMS WITH A DISTURBING 

 PAST 

 Ordinary Cambodians as well as members 

 of the international community have mixed feelings about the 

 trial of the surviving Khmer Rouge leaders beginning this 

 year, writes Sanjib Baruah 

 Tuol Sleng genocide 

 museum, Phnom Penh 

 The very ordinariness of S-21 

 makes it hard to let go of the haunting images that would 

 stay in any visitor?s mind. Tucked away in a quiet residential 

 part of Cambodia?s capital city, Phnom Penh, S-21 was Khmer 

 Rouge?s secret prison where some of the major purges by 

 its cadre took place. Inside this complex, more than 14,000 

 so-called enemies of the revolution were questioned, tortured 

 and made to confess to counter-revolutionary crimes between 

 1976 and 1979. When the Khmer Rouge regime was toppled by 

 the Vietnamese army in 1979, only seven prisoners were found 

 alive.

 S-21 was once a school. But the 

 Khmer Rouge had little use for school buildings, especially 

 those in a modern city. So they used the complex as a secret 

 prison. While a wall of corrugated iron sheets and barbed 

 wires surrounded the complex those days, today it looks 

 like a school once again and even has its old playground 

 restored. It is now called the Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocidal 

 Crimes.

 The Khmer Rouge secret police 

 were meticulous record-keepers. Each prisoner was photographed 

 ? sometimes before and after torture ? and complete resumes 

 were prepared till the date of the arrest. These pictures 

 and records are on display at the museum.

 Rows and rows of black and white 

 photographs ? of people young and old, men and women ? stare 

 at the visitors. They include workers, peasants, engineers, 

 professors, students, teachers, ministers and diplomats. 

 The forced confessions and bureaucratic 

 forms, with details of the ?counter-revolutionary crimes? 

 and the methods used for torturing and executing prisoners, 

 are all part of the museum?s archives. One can also see 

 the classrooms that were turned into cells, rusted iron 

 beds, iron bars and chains with which the prisoners were 

 shackled, and the instruments that were used to torture 

 them. There are even biographies and photographs of the 

 prison staff.

 The museum houses only a small 

 part of the evidence of the brutality of the Khmer Rouge 

 regime. An estimated 1.7 million people died of starvation, 

 forced labour, disease or execution in Cambodia?s ?killing 

 fields?. Yet efforts to try and punish the Khmer Rouge leaders 

 have moved painfully slowly.

 The regime ended more than a quarter 

 century ago in 1979. Its leader, Pol Pot, died in 1998. 

 The former head of state, Khieu Samphan, and former foreign 

 minister, Ieng Sary live freely in Cambodia. Samphan even 

 writes books and gives interviews to the foreign media. 

 However, a few leaders, notably Ta Mok, the one-legged Khmer 

 Rouge military chief, and Kang Khek Lu, better known as 

 Duch, the head of S-21, are under arrest.

 Now it finally looks as if the 

 long-awaited trial would start in the New Year. There are 

 now laws in place outlining the rules and procedures of 

 the ?extraordinary chambers?. An agreement between the Cambodian 

 government and the United Nations provides the modalities 

 for cooperation. There will be a Trial Chamber, composed 

 of three Cambodian judges and two international judges, 

 and a Supreme Court Chamber that will have four Cambodian 

 judges and three international judges. Cambodia would appoint 

 the five international judges from among at least seven 

 nominees of the UN secretary-general. The UN has already 

 prepared a list of individuals for appointment as judges.

 For a while there was some uncertainty 

 about the finances, but the matter has been substantially 

 resolved. Most of the $56 million budgeted for three years 

 of the extraordinary chambers will come from abroad. Member 

 states of the UN have pledged almost $43 million from the 

 budget of the parent organization. The pledges vary from 

 one country to another. For instance, Japan has pledged 

 $21 million, France $4.8 million and the United Kingdom 

 $ 2.9 million. The Republic of Korea has promised $150,000 

 while Luxembourg has pitched in with $66,000. While the 

 United States of America has spent millions towards documentation 

 and research, it has not pledged money to finance the trial, 

 apparently because of ?legislative restraints?. The Cambodian 

 side, however, is still substantially short of the funds 

 needed to pay for its share of the budget.

 But there is little enthusiasm 

 among ordinary Cambodians about the trial. During my visit 

 in December 2005, I found that more foreigners are interested 

 in the trial than the Cambodians themselves. Few believe 

 that the trial will take place before the aging Khmer Rouge 

 leaders are all dead.

 Yet the request for international 

 assistance for this trial came from the Cambodian government. 

 In 1997, it wrote to the UN secretary-general, requesting 

 his assistance in bringing to justice ?those persons responsible 

 for the genocide and crimes against humanity?. Cambodia, 

 said the government, ?does not have the resources or expertise 

 to conduct this very important procedure.?

 But, during the past few years, 

 the negotiations often got bogged down over differences 

 on the relative weight of Cambodian versus international 

 rules and procedures and on who would pay for the trial. 

 The UN sought guarantees that those indicted would be arrested; 

 that there would be no amnesties or pardons; there would 

 be independent, international prosecutors; and the foreign 

 judges would be in the majority. In early 2002, the UN even 

 pulled out from the negotiations to protest against Cambodian 

 intransigence. The former prime minister of India, Atal 

 Bihari Vajpayee, had, at that time, pledged Indian support 

 for a trial and an appointment of an Indian judge in the 

 event of a UN withdrawal.

 The protracted negotiations reflect 

 the compulsions of both domestic Cambodian politics and 

 the ambivalence of key countries. The Cambodian prime minister, 

 Hun Sen, is a savvy politician who was a junior commander 

 in the Khmer Rouge. Even though he himself has asked for 

 the trial and for UN assistance, he is strongly guided by 

 his own political agenda. He has publicly urged the world 

 to pay attention to achieving ?peace, national reconciliation, 

 national unity, economic development and reducing poverty? 

 in Cambodia rather than the Khmer Rouge trial. He is reluctant 

 to commit Cambodian resources to the trial. Cambodia, he 

 said, can only offer the meeting hall and can pay for the 

 water and electricity and security. Those who want an international 

 trial, he said, have to pay for it.

 There is also ambivalence on the 

 part of the key international players. While many American 

 politicians and activists support the trial, officially, 

 Washington is also wary about re-opening old wounds. After 

 all, US support for the Lon Nol regime and the bombing of 

 Cambodia provided the background for the Khmer Rouge?s road 

 to power. During the Eighties, the US supported the Khmer 

 Rouge-dominated coalition and helped the group occupy the 

 Cambodian seat at the UN.

 Nor can the Cambodian ambivalence 

 be reduced to machinations of Hun Sen or members of the 

 political establishment. There is a history of Khmer mistrust 

 and resentment of the Vietnamese. A few Cambodians I spoke 

 to expressed concern that the trial would add legitimacy 

 to the Vietnamese invasion and make them look like liberators 

 rather than aggressors. A number of people asked if $56 

 million are best spent on prosecuting a few aging leaders, 

 given Cambodia?s current challenges. I also heard reservations 

 about keeping the physical remains of the victims for use 

 in a trial instead of cremating them.

 Yet unlike in many other countries 

 that have gone through similar experiences, Cambodians make 

 no attempt to deny or minimize the Khmer Rouge killings. 

 The Tuol Sleng Museum is an ample illustration of this, 

 even though there is some discomfort about the fact that 

 it was the Vietnamese who made it into a museum.

 The sheer ordinariness of S-21 

 is perhaps reflective of Cambodian conditions. Very little 

 attention has been paid on appropriate curatorial practices 

 for displaying such a gruesome ?exhibit?. Confessions extracted 

 from prisoners, for instance, can be seen lying around on 

 tables gathering dust. Yet no expert design or contemporary 

 curatorial practice could have stood better testimony to 

 what Hannah Arendt calls the banality of evil.

 The coming $56 million trial is 

 sure to bring many globe-trotting tribunal watchers to Cambodia. 

 It is a pity though that the international community could 

 not come up with a better way of bringing the Khmer Rouge 

 leaders to justice ? one that was more in tune with Cambodian 

 conditions, and their way of coming to terms with the past.

 Spare the child

 Sir Shreyashi Chowdhurys death should be a warning for working parents. There are many like Shreyashi, suffering from depression and intense loneliness. It is not expected of parents to be with their children all the time, but they can, perhaps, devote some quality time to them during the day. Just as children are expected to be responsible to their parents, parents should also reciprocate this gesture. What Shreyashi did to herself is totally unfortunate. Such incidents can be avoided with a little care and attention. 

Yours faithfully, 

Swagata Ganguly,

Revisiting history

 Sir It is not for us to decide whether Britons are right in renovating John Nicholsons cemetery (Salute to Briton, insult to India, Oct 25). Just as India is going to celebrate 150 years of the First War of Independence (1857), the Britons too wish to honour their soldiers who had fought against the Indians and sacrificed their lives for the sake of their country. Brigadier General John Nicholson happened to be one of them. His cemetery is, therefore, a symbol of honour given not only to the man himself, but also to those British soldiers who died in the Revolt of 1857. 

 From the British point of view, he was a hero, and quite justifiably so. Hence they want to renovate the cemetery. And this could have hardly been meant as an insult to Indians. On their recent visit to the cemetery, the present members of the Nicholson family were thoroughly disappointed to see the appalling condition of the place. The maintenance of the cemetery was not up to the mark and they wanted it repaired. What Nicholson did to Indians during his lifetime is a different issue altogether.

Yours faithfully, 

Nandini Saraf,

 Sir The renovation of the Nicholson cemetery by the British government is an insult to those Indians who died fighting for the country in 1857. The British are trying to prove that their patriotism is superior to ours, and we, by allowing such renovations, are accepting their view.

Yours faithfully, 

Kavita Punjabi,

 Sir The Revolt of 1857 happened because of religious rather than patriotic reasons. How could the sepoys be called patriots when they were serving the interests of the enemy? How could it be the first war of independence when at its heart was religion and not patriotism, though the latter might have provoked the outbreak? What, then, is wrong with the honouring of John Nicholson as a war hero who died for the sake of his country? 

Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari,

 Sir The British high commission should renovate all the other monuments of historical importance and not just the Nicholson cemetery. If the British authorities had shown equal interest in the condition of historical relics all around the country, as they have demonstrated in case of the Nicholson cemetery, then the question of insult would not have arisen.

Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta,

Calcutta 

 Sir It is pointless to discriminate between the dead. The reaction to the renovation of the Nicholson cemetery, in any event, is nothing but excessive. The awareness that Britons have shown regarding the preservation of the Nicholson cemetery is commendable. There is much to learn from their initiatives, given the extremely sorry state of our historical monuments. 

Yours faithfully, 

Pranab Hazra,

Burdwan

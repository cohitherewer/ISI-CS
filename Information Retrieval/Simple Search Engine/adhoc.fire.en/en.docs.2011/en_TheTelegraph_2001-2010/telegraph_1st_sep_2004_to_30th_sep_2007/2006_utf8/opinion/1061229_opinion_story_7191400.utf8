 Ambai: sensitive chronicler

 In a forest, a deer: 

 Stories by Ambai Translated by Lakshmi Holmstrm, Oxford, Rs 295

 Ambai is one of the finest writers of short stories in Tamil. She ranks with Pudumaippittan and Mauni, the other two great practitioners of this genre. This is an English translation of Ambais third collection of stories Kaathil Oru Maan (2000). However, the last story of the volume A Movement, a File, Some Tears did not figure in the original collection.

 Ambai is an avowed feminist, and her stories, by and large, articulate strong feminist views. The ones in the volume, written between 1990 and 2002, mostly have women protagonists fighting against patriarchy. But Ambais artistic virtuosity prevents the stories from being feminist agitprops. Her stories explore the nuances of personal relationships, complex network of emotions, and mingle themes insightfully. In Unpublished Manuscript a young woman suddenly comes upon an unpublished manuscript by her mother. The manuscript tells her the way her mother was brutally treated by her now-deceased poet-father. The reading of the manuscript deepens her attachment to her mother. Towards the end, the daughter happens to see a father carrying his sleeping baby daughter nestled against his chest. She feels inclined to cast her own father into that image. The conflicting visions of fatherhood start clashing in her mind until slowly, slowly, starting with little sobs, she began to weep.

 Ambai is a daring experimenter of the short story genre. Her eagerness to forge a new language for women concurs with her propensity to constantly reinvent this genre, juxtaposing different narrative forms and subtly alternating narrative voices within the same story. In a Forest, a Deer recounts the saga of Tangam Athai, whose husband remarried because she could not bear him a child. Chinthirus journey to the forest is narrated alongside the mythological tale of Sitas banabas to underscore Chinthirus unique search for self-identity.

 Themes of exile, displacement and the diaspora are quite common in Ambais stories, and these are germane to her concept of selfhood, defined by personal memories. Selfhood, according to Ambai, is more of a psychological than a geographical construct. Matthew, in One and Another, remarks that our roots are everywhere in the world. The mother in Panasakti and Others in a Plastic Box packs some of her belongings in a plastic box which she carries wherever she goes. The narrator in A Rose-Coloured Sari Woven with Birds and Swans gives the pallu of her mothers sari a sari which had been worn at special family occasions and which had travelled all over India to her adopted daughter as part of the family tradition. This story represents Ambais study of self-perception of the diasporic Indian community.

 In her introduction, the translator Laksmi Holmstrm quotes from Victor Turners The Ritual Process to show Ambais understanding of the societal bond from the perspective of a dialectic between structure and moments of anti-structure. This is evident in stories such as Come Ride where a eunuch laments over a dead camel. Here Ambai demonstrates how an emotional bond is formed between two marginalized social creatures. A Rat, a Sparrow is an ironic study of the suffocating urban life of Mumbai through two contrasted images. The undertone of humour in Ambais stories is entertaining for the readers.

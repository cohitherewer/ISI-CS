 ALMOST WAR

 If only it were just a question of bartering kidnapped soldiers. The conflict between Israel and Hizbullah ? perhaps the third most competent military force in west Asia after Israel itself and Iran ? has the could become a major military and humanitarian crisis. Hizbullah is not a nation but a combination of a populist grassroots movement, political party and militant outfit, with an ambivalent and volatile relationship with Lebanon and its common people, especially the Shia Muslims in the south of the country. And this is precisely the problem. Israel?s retaliation to Hizbullah?s violation of its sovereignty can only result in massive civilian casualties. Rockets and drones are being fired in either direction across the borders. But very few in the international community, now gathered in St Petersburg and tensely watching the situation, would say that the aggressiveness of Israel?s attack was not disproportionate. With well above a hundred dead civilians in Lebanon, hundreds of thousands of people made homeless and vulnerable, and roads and airports being systematically destroyed, it is difficult for Lebanon, and the world, not to see Israel?s attacks as only a few steps away from a major ground invasion. The United Nations and the European Union are speaking of ?utmost restraint? and a ceasefire ? words that are beginning to sound as if from another universe of diplomacy and peace negotiations. The only comment that seems to make sense in such a scenario are President Bush?s reassurance to Israel that it has every right to defend itself, and that ?unilateral convergence? is a ?bold idea?.

 The creation of the Hizbullah, the Party of God, together with the career of its chief, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, goes back to the Israeli occupation of Lebanon from 1982 until 2000. Mr Nasrallah?s son was killed by the Israelis, and the Hizbullah has become an important political and social force in Lebanon with two seats in its cabinet. Moreover, the drones and rockets fired at Israel by the Hizbullah have been made in Syria and Iran, and these two countries, together with Hamas and the abiding Palestinian question, remain crucial elements in the situation. Lebanon, Syria and Iran, in spite of internal dissensions among them, could form what has been called ?a broad anti-American and anti-Israeli front? that could destabilize a great deal more than the stock market and the price of oil.

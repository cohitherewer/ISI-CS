The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RAVAGED GREENS

 The chief minister of West Bengal had once called Calcutta an oasis of peace. It was an unfortunate description at more levels than one, as Calcuttans have now begun to realize. The problem is not only with law and order. That lovely, green word, oasis, is also proving to be a grimly ironic choice. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has systematically undermined every legal and ethical system to damage, perhaps irreversibly, the environment of the city and the state. Calcuttas air pollution is murderous, purely out of political callousness and corruption, and its Maidan has been a victim of the governments stubborn and sustained ravage; the wetlands remain in some sort of a limbo. Now, the report of a rather old survey of 1999-2000 says that Calcutta has the lowest green cover compared to other Indian cities. Not that the other cities are doing very well. Ideally, 15 per cent of the total area of a city should be green. Delhi shows 8.6, Mumbai 8.49 and Chennai 7.5. But Calcutta is as low as 0.95 per cent. Other reports have also, from time to time, come up with a steadily diminishing green cover in the city.

 It is also ironic that this latest report has been placed before the Calcutta high court. The court, together with the entire public interest legal system, is perhaps the body least empowered to secure and monitor the citys environmental standards and resources. The state government has defied and ignored almost all the courts rulings on matters green, rendering judicial activism a non-option. The ordinary concerned citizen would also find it quite impossible to conduct his own monitoring. West Bengals attitude to the Right to Information Act which guarantees access to information regarding state action in such matters is primitive and undemocratic. Civic bodies like the municipal corporation and the pollution control board, which are accountable to the public for such basic things as air, water and trees, are conveniently oblivious of the RTI Acts requirements. So the governments chronic lack of environmental scruple, its cluelessness about how to build such values and practices into its working notions of urban development or civic administration, exist in a legal and political disorder that allows such crimes to be committed with impunity. The normal structures of accountability simply do not exist in West Bengal, together with the basic civic awareness that these structures are supposed to foster.

 OTHER TRADITIONS

 Inevitably, the boom in the jewellery industry has had a flip side. Traditional goldsmiths, in Kerala for example, are having to leave their profession and become drivers and construction workers because the world of fast production, slick designing, and high competition is not for them. ?This is perhaps the best period to be in the gold business in India and the worst to be a goldsmith,? says one whose forefathers had been official ornament-makers for the Travancore royal family. The smaller goldsmith is being forced out by the ?jewellery manufacturers?, who train people, including women, to work as ?jewellery factory workers?, say the craftsmen. It seems they are unable to produce a complete piece on their own. 

 The goldsmiths? problems began with the liberalization of the gold sector, especially the three policy changes since 1990: the repeal of the Gold Control Act, the introduction of provisions relating to gold in the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 and the permission to NRIs to bring up to 5 kilograms (later 10 kg) of gold into the country against a small duty in foreign exchange. There have been reports of suicides among goldsmiths and small traders in recent years, and of small shops closing down. Raj Mahtani of Satramdas Dhalamal, who emphasizes the dominance of Bengali craftsmen in the trade, feels that quite a few of those who had left the profession are coming back. But for many goldsmiths, especially in the South, the outlook is bleak. They are also unhappy with the state?s indifference. 

 West Bengal has some of the best craftsmen and a thriving business in gold. Even with the demand for traditional work falling, gold workers from Bengal are still paid the highest wages elsewhere. Perhaps the zari and gold parks planned by the West Bengal government will help the state?s craftsmen. No one would like to see artists, who give so much pleasure, turn into rickshaw-pullers.

 Received wisdom says that the feminine psyche is ruled by vanity, which expresses itself in the desire for ornamentation. And it is specifically gold jewellery for which women are supposed to have a peculiar fascination. Although researchers have discovered that seashells served as ornaments about 400,000 years ago, it would be quite unthinkable today to bedeck a bride with shells. Yet indigenous peoples, both men and women, decorated themselves with horn, beads or even pieces of wood

 In a traditional Indian marriage, which is an exchange between the bride?s father and the groom, the woman?s worth is measured in gold. An erotic exchange is subsumed in the economic exchange between two men, and the gold on the bride marks that transaction. 

 Gold is valued because it is a symbol ? of honour and opulence. Its prized status derives from its exchange value. Gold is supposed to hold women in thrall. Is that a myth, a cultural construct rendered natural? 

 To reject gold as jewellery can function as a statement, one which is made by women who can brave formal occasions in, say, ?ethnic? ornaments. Such a choice goes beyond just the wish for a new way to look good. The power of gold works both ways: it cannot be detached from histories of pomp and greed, cruelty and oppression, superstition and stereotyping. But the most moralistic condemnation associates gold and the woman in the evil nexus of kamini-kanchan, the woman-and-gold figure that tempts a man away from enlightenment and freedom. It is unlikely, though, that a woman choosing ethnic jewellery does so out of self-loathing. Rather, her choice attributes an alternative value to a different type of ornamentation. But is that statement strong enough to assail the inherited notions of women?s desire and the consensus of cultures?

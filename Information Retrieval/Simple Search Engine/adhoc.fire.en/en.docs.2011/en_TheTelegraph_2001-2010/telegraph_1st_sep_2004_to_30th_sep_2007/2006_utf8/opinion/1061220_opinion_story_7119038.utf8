 WHAT AILS THE JAWAN

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Yet another killing of an army captain by a jawan in the North-east makes it clear that the image of the disciplined and apolitical Indian garrison is under severe stress. One is not trying to spread panic here. But the incidents repeatedly prove that unless the problem is tackled at the highest level, the fate of the Indian army is at stake.

 Things do not seem satisfactory inside the closely-guarded citadels of the Indian army. There is the unending war of attrition in two sectors Kashmir and the North-east. Here the soldier faces uncertainty and anxiety, and has to train guns on an enemy who is still undefinable. Long hours of hardship far away from home keep the soldiers on the edge. What happens if a soldier, on top of all this, finds his superior officer to be dishonest, rude and insensitive? Is it necessary to put up with captains and colonels who pinch liquor from the regimental canteen or steal soldiers rations? Although this kind of corruption is still not rampant, there is already evidence that the cancer might spread.

 The soldiers are undoubtedly under stress and need to be counselled by psychiatrists. But will that be enough as remedy? Let us go into the mind of the soldier. He learns the art of killing the targeted enemy at the order of his superior while simultaneously trying to defend himself in the face of death. Obviously, the soldier knows from day one that it is often a bullet that separates life from death. If one looks at the strain, panic and frustration a soldier is subject to, one would realize why the gun is often trained at superiors or colleagues.

 Bad news

 There are at least 18 field (infantry) regiments in the Indian army. The soldiers for these regiments are recruited from earmarked areas, as the names suggest. Thus, Jammu and Kashmir broadly supplies men for J amp;K Rifles, J amp;K Light Infantry and the Ladakh Scouts. A big chunk of the men of Bihar Regiment hail from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The seven regiments of the Gurkhas draw their men from Nepal, the Terai, Assam and the hills of Garhwal and Kumaon. 

 One should remember that the jawans traditionally hail from the rural areas, often from agricultural families. Today, some of these areas are in turmoil. Nepals turbulence affects the Gurkhas. A burning Kashmir causes anxiety to recruits from the Jhelum valley. Suicides of farmers in Maharashtra are likely to affect the Maratha Light Infantry. The caste wars of Bihar sow hatred in the minds of the Bihar Regiment soldiers . Fresh unrest in Nagaland will be bad news for many of the Indian regiments. Assams woes would be equally bad news for the recruits from the Brahmaputra valley.

 But all this is only part of the travails of the Indian jawan. The duplicity, corruption and injustice within the system is bound to affect him. Can he accept blatant falsehood, insensitivity and ruthlessness in those whose orders he has to carry out blindly? 

 There lies the crux of the problem. A soldier is trained to give everything, including his life, without question. He swears and abides by the four tenets of namak, iman, nishan and izzat. He also expects his kind to follow these principles. Which is why treachery and disloyalty force on him a momentary lapse of senses that results in fatal firings on his own fraternity.

 Professional soldiering in India has become more difficult and dangerous than ever before. There has been a decline in the quality of officers. There is a shortage of 12,000-14,000 junior-ranking leaders at the platoon, company and battalion levels. Never before has independent India faced such a serious threat to the combat units from within. It is time to act, to constitute special and exclusive commissions to deal with the problems of Indian soldiering.

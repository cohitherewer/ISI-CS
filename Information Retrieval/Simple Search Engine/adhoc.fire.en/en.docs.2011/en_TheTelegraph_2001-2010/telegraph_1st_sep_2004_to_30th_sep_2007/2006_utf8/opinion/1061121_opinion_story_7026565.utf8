 GROUND WORK

 There are two ways of looking at the unending political turmoil in Bangladesh. At one level, the street fights and shutdowns are a manifestation of partisan politics at its worst. It is easy, therefore, to blame the countrys current crisis on the bitter personal rivalry between Ms Sheikh Hasina Wajed and Ms Khaleda Zia. But such an assessment would be simplistic and widely off the mark. The real battle in Bangladesh is over the future of its young democracy. Only superficially, the agitation by the 14-party alliance, led by Ms Wajed, is about the removal of the election officials appointed by Ms Zias regime. The alliances complaints about massive manipulations of the electoral rolls are also not just a matter of party politics. Ultimately, the unrest reflects the fear of a large section of people that their democratic right to vote might be stolen from them. No democratic institution can work in such an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. During her five-year rule, Ms Zia did little to allay the oppositions fears; worse, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies, especially the Jamaat-e- Islami, blatantly used the administration for partisan ends.

 True, Bangladeshs constitution sets the caretaker government a time-frame for the parliamentary elections. But, that is only a narrow, legalistic view of democracy. The interim administration would court worse trouble if it looked at only the law and ignored the larger political and moral aspects of the crisis. It has to hold the elections, for a longer political vacuum could also be dangerous. But it has to create the right conditions for a free vote before it does anything else. The elections will have no legitimacy if the opposition parties boycott them. Such an electoral farce took place in Bangladesh in February, 1996. But the peoples complete rejection of it led to another poll four months later. It could be enormously risky now to even try to repeat that history.

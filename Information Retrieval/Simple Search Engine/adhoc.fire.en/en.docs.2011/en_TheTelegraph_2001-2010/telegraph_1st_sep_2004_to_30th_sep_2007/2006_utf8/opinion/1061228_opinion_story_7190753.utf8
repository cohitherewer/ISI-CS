 HOPE AGAIN

 Messages of hope and promises of peace should be welcome, even from those who wield the gun. The New Year message of Mr Arabinda Rajkhowa, chairman of the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom, can, therefore, bring some relief to the people of Assam. They would consider 2007 an exceptionally happy year if it saw, as Mr Rajkhowa hoped, a political settlement of the insurgency. The problem is that the Ulfa had raised hopes of a settlement on other occasions too before dashing them. There were similar hopes when the army declared a temporary ceasefire in Assam earlier this year in order to facilitate peace-talks with the Ulfa-appointed peoples consultative committee. Not only were those hopes belied, mainly because of the Ulfas refusal to directly join the talk, but the militants also drowned Assam in despair by stepping up their violence in the past three months. Mr Rajkhowas complaint that the talks were sabotaged suggests that he still refuses to admit to his own organizations responsibility for the failure of the peace initiative. It is time the Ulfa joined the talks directly with the Centre. More important, it must stop using violence as a bargaining tool. 

 However, Mr Rajkhowas complaint about the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, headed by Mr Isaak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, is a fresh cause for concern. The boundary dispute between Assam and Nagaland is old, but this is the first time that the Ulfa has openly accused the Naga group of encroaching on Assamese territory. Given the history of clashes between the two communities on the Assam-Nagaland border, Mr Rajkhowas provocation is unwarranted. He should have urged politicians and others in Assam to represent the states case to the panel appointed by the Supreme Court to identify the boundaries of Assam, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. The last thing that Assam wants is ethnic skirmishes with its neighbours.

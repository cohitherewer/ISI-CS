 PLAY IT AGAIN

 Hamlet was a remake. For Shakespeare, part of the challenge and fun of writing it, and possibly acting in it, was to play with his audiences memory of the original, now-lost version. Such an exercise in conscious, cultural repetition calls for a special kind of sophistication in the playwright, the performers and in those who come to watch. Something like this is now beginning to happen within Bollywood with the release of the new Don, to be followed by the new Umrao Jaan, and then, if the copyright hurdles can be jumped, by Ram Gopal Varma Ka Sholay. Of course, remakes are not at all new in Indian or international cinema. Like Hamlet, they sometimes entirely upstage their originals in public memory. Who remembers, for instance, the films of which Blow Up, Blue Lagoon and Cape Fear are remakes? Very often, they are acts of respectful daring like the new Psycho, or Steven Soderberghs revisiting of the space station in which the dead have not died in Tarkovskys Solaris. And Hitchcock a man fascinated by doubles made The Man Who Knew Too Much twice, with a 22-year gap between them.

 Doubles haunt Hindi films too. Severed twins and posthumous impersonators allow actors to perform virtuosic double-roles, like Amitabh Bachchan in the old Don (a plot-element deliberately twisted around in the remake). The other story often told is that of fathers and sons, even as iconic Bollywood fathers (and sometimes mothers) are now beginning to see or oversee the rise of their beautiful and talented offspring. And these are bound to be stories of tribute mixed with tension, loyalties shading into competitiveness. Both sets of stories doubles, bloodlines provide ways of understanding the relationship between legendary films and their remakes. Farhan Akhtar, the remaker of Don, is its original scriptwriters son. But Amjad Khans son finds it difficult to imagine Amitabh Bachchan playing Gabbar Singh in a remake that seems to be legally doomed, raising questions of proprietorship that are more than merely legal. And what about the lines that join Bachchan Sr and Shah Rukh Khan, Rekha and Aishwarya Rai, Helen and Kareena Kapoor? These, too, could be seen as lines of succession, marking continuity as well as profound change, the old engendering as well as giving way to the new.

 Immense changes have taken place within and around Bollywood between the mid-to-late Seventies or early Eighties, when the originals were made, and now. The technology and economics of film-making and viewing, and with that, the very language of films and their place in the world, have been radically transformed. The inevitable result of all this is the self-reflexivity that informs most Hindi films today, from the banal to the accomplished, their sense of themselves in relation to their forebears and to a set of rapidly globalizing possibilities that puts to test every kind of inventiveness. The new thus looks at itself by remembering and re-inventing the old.

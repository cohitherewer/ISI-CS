 The right balance

 Sir ? Abhirup Sarkar presents a well-balanced argument in ?Absolute poverty? (Feb 2). However, there can be no denying the gaping inequality in India. Sarkar cites the Human Development Report of 2004, but even in its 2005 edition, the pattern remains unchanged. There is no doubt though that India is far more equal than most countries in a comparable income bracket, and many countries that are considerably richer. We may find John Rawls?s ?difference principle? relevant in this context since it allows inequalities as long as it makes the poor better off than before. It could provide us with a useful cut-off line beyond which inequalities must be discouraged. As Sarkar suggests, what is needed is a balanced approach. Extremism in economic policies ? be it laissez faire capitalism or socialist utopianism ? must be discouraged.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Narrowing the gulf of inequality does not result in the elimination of poverty. Though countries like India, Bangladesh, Pakistan have a lower inequality ratio than the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Thailand, yet they suffer from abject poverty. Inequality shall always remain, whether among states or among individuals, since it is an accepted fact that the level of efficiency of some states and individuals is higher than that of others. The agenda of some left-wing economists to do away with inequality is therefore not grounded in reality as elimination of inequality will not automatically remove poverty.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? If the richest in India earn only 7 per cent more than the poorest, it only means that the rich in India are not rich enough. Abhirup Sarkar talks about state intervention in reducing inequality, or as he puts it, ?making the poor market-worthy?. But that, in India, is a chicken-and-egg dilemma. No government has so far been able to strike the right balance on the extent of state intervention that is required, and as long as the unrealistic left is allowed to have its say in governance, a solution is unlikely to emerge.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? If the prime minister is to be believed, India is preparing for a second green revolution. But will this not add to our bulging stockpile of foodgrains, its maintenance cost and the woes of farmers who will face the brunt of falling prices consequent to excess production? Even if a second green revolution enables farmers to increase their income, it will hardly solve their problems of lack of education, healthcare, shelter, drinking water and so on. 

 If India wants to benefit from liberalization and bring changes in agricultural production, it should try to control its population growth like China. Even if globalization creates one crore extra jobs in a year, the benefits will be wiped off if the population grows at the present rate. Unless we are willing to do that, India will become another Congo. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Famous last words

 Sir ? A fresh controversy has taken hold over the nation regarding the last words of Mahatma Gandhi. Venkita Kalyanam, who was near Gandhi when he was shot, denies that Gandhi uttered the words, ?Hey Ram?, while Gandhi?s grandson claims that according to Abha Gandhi, Gandhi did utter the words. I had attended many meetings of Gopal Godse ? the younger brother of Nathuram Godse ? who was also present at the time Gandhi was shot dead. He emphasized that it is not possible medically for anyone to utter those words, or any other, when one is so fatally injured. 

 In case Gopal Godse and Venkita Kalyanam are right, it would be unwise to delude people by propagating the untruth about Gandhi?s last words. Remember, Gandhi used to say that truth is god. Another thing. The costly flame burning on Gandhi?s samadhi consumes several lakhs of rupees each year. Can we spare the luxury when the poor have no fuel to cook their food? Is it not an affront to Gandhi?s principles?

 Yours faithfully,

K.G. Acharya, Mumbai 

 Sir ? There is no logic behind the recent controversy over Mahatma Gandhi?s last words. Such controversies are created by certain sections of the populace just for the sake of publicity. Would it make any difference to India if Gandhi?s last words were revealed to be something else 58 years after his death? 

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? As Ramachandra Guha has pointed out in ?Hands and heads? (Feb 4), Gandhi did not condemn the scientific temper of the West, but he objected to the use of scientific discoveries against humanity. He pointed out that scientific inventions alone would not be able to bring the desired change in the world if the darkness of the mind is not dispelled. Sadly, his worst fears have come true today with environmental degradation, nuclear race, water pollution and similar other problems plaguing the world. Gandhi rightly placed transformation of our inner being above that of the external world. He perhaps foresaw the crisis of the modern world in which scientific advance has lead to a sharp polarization in the world, with the technologically advanced nations browbeating the not-so-advanced into subservience.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 INTO THE HEART OF TERROR

 Up in arms

 Holy Warriors By Edna Fernandes, Viking, Rs 450

 Fundamentalism, political extremism, religious bigotry and intolerance have emerged as something of a ?dark force? in human affairs. It thwarts the rights of both religious and secular forces in society by organizing a culture of violence against them.

 In this book, Edna Fernandes argues that development is impossible without education and opportunities for employment in a pluralistic state like India. In her journey into the heart of fundamentalism in the country, the author explores the cradles of terror like Kashmir, Gujarat and Nagaland and records incidents of communal violence, human rights abuse and persecution in an attempt to probe deeper into their causes.

 Holy Warriors is divided into four parts. ?Soldiers of Islam? delineates the vulnerability of Indian Muslims ? a disempowered section of society devoid of education and jobs. The political, cultural and economic discrimination against Muslims has led to their involvement in ethno-religious conflicts, writes Fernandes. 

 In ?Kashmir: Paradise Lost?, the author refers to a journey she undertook to the ?Cemetery of the Martyrs?. Here she found a sign which said ?Lest you forget, we have given our today for tomorrow of yours?. This, Fernandes realized, was very similar to an engraving at a cemetery near Imphal which marked the sacrifice of INA soldiers. 

 We also get a glimpse of Deobandism which came into existence in the wake of the Mutiny in order to ?protect the faith from corruption by the British-Christian influence as well as to maintain a distinct religious identity from the Hindus?. This line of thought has inspired leaders like Osama bin Laden in their fight against the West.

 ?The Crusaders? talks about the cruelty, oppression and forcible conversion of Hindus and Muslims in the name of the Inquisition ? a form of clerical fascism ? held in Goa from 1560 to 1774. It was revived in 1778 during the reign of D. Maria, queen of Portugal, and ran till 1812. Now, the Catholic community of Goa is asking the Church to acknowledge ?the atrocities committed in the name of faith and for Goan Christians to view their history in context.?

 If civilization is defined in terms of a shared language, history, religion, custom, institutions and self-identification of people, then the Naga secessionists have a point: they are really not a part of India. A majority of Nagas are Christians, and they differ from other Indians culturally, linguistically, genetically and in the religion they follow. And now they want to have an independent nation ? a spiritual nerve-centre to spread the Word to neighbouring countries.

 ?Land of the Pure? illustrates the genesis of the Khalistan movement, the terrorist activities it spawned and the crackdown that followed. Thus, even two decades after Operation Blue Star, an Akali leader cannot forget the instances of human rights abuse, custody deaths, and the disappearance of ordinary people that took in the name of clamping down against a regime of terror.

 The final part of the book is called ?Saffron Warriors?. In this, the author tries to unmask the Shiv Sena supremo, Bal Thackeray ? a godfather like figure who loves to operate on the basis of his charisma rather than with the help of legitimate sources of power. The author takes great care to describe the massacre at Godhra, and the genocide that followed and ravaged the state of Gujarat for over two months. The butchery left an indelible mark of shame on the state. Today, the riots in Gujarat are seen as an instance of ethnic cleansing that was organized by the forces of Hindutva. Fernandes is right in saying that the events in Gujarat has resurrected the horrifying images of Partition. 

 Fernandes dovetails different forms of fundamentalism and reacts sharply to the intolerance, disunity and bigotry exhibited by a section of the Indian population. The author?s conclusions bring to mind a warning issued by the noted poet Iqbal; ?If you fail to see the light of reason, O people of Hindustan, history will fail to record even the fact that you once existed?.

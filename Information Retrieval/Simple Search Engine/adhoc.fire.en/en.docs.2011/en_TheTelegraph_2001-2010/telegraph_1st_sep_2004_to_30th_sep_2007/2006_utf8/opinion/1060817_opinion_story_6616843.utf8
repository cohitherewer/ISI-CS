 MORE OF A BANE, LESS OF A BOON

 Instead of abolishing child labour, the government should aim at improving working conditions in the unorganized sector, writes Sumanta Sen

 To make ends meet

 The authorities have clearly failed to make a difference between violation of the law in other spheres like adulteration of food and medicine for instance and violation in the case of the issue under consideration. The offenders in the latter case are violating the law because society, or a large part of it, wants them to do so. The teeming millions in the nations urban slums and the countryside can ill afford to keep their children out of employment. Poverty demands that every member of the family earns something to keep the pot boiling at home. The children cannot be allowed to stay as non-earning members if there are jobs to be had as an errand boy at the neighbourhood eateries, the motor garage or in such other business enterprises. 

 Society also has its do-gooders who insist that the poor send their children to government schools, where fees are not required, to educate them and also keep them out of harms way. Like the ministers and the law makers, they also seem to turn a blind eye to the poverty factor. It is this factor that makes parents stop children from going to school the moment the midday meal is stopped. This is so because the parents seem to believe that there is no point in their children wasting time in school if even one meal a day is not assured. That one meal away from home means a lot to the parents and if even that is not provided, then their argument is that the kids would do well to try and earn something during school hours.

 Concern for children, for women or for any section of society is certainly valid. But such concern very often leads to action which is not in tune with the conditions that prevail. This ensures that the cause of worry continues to remain. Why are minors forced to take up jobs? This is the question that never seems to be addressed in its totality. Instead, the attempt always is to go in for measures that only sound nice, such as the minimum employment guarantee scheme. Even if jobs are really found for people in some pockets of the country, that is only for 90 days. What happens then for the rest of the year? There are also issues of selection of beneficiaries which need not be gone into here. But it can be nobodys argument that such schemes will do away with poverty in the country and thus remove the grounds for employment of minor children. Of course, on paper, these projects will remain as proof of the governments goodwill. But only on paper.

 The employment scheme that has been discussed so far is largely for the unorganized sector, which provides the bulk of the jobs to such unskilled minors. In West Bengal, efforts are on to bring this sector within the ambit of government discipline which includes employee welfare. But if the state really seeks to penalize erring employers, then there will be chaos, particularly in Calcutta, similar to the one that was witnessed over the hawker removal issue. Just as the hawkers, the parents will also ask, what about the money that our children earn? 

 The organized sector does not really come into the picture as, apart from everything else, they do not have jobs to offer these days. Another question comes to mind in this context. The voting age in India is eighteen years, so all those below that age should be considered minors. Then why has the cut off age been fixed at fourteen? Do children between the ages of fourteen and eighteen need no security even though the reality does not allow them to seek advantage of the protection?

 So poverty has to be eliminated. But how can this be achieved? In the Fifties and in the Sixties, there were dreams of a socialist revolution but they remained pipe dreams as those who had conjured up visions of a peoples democracy were of the opinion that the goal could be reached through a bourgeois democracy. The Naxalites spoke of a different path, as the Maoists are doing today. But the latter are no more than a threat to law and order, even perhaps a serious threat, but they are certainly not the harbingers of a revolutionary upsurge. On the other side of the picture, there is Indira Gandhi who declared garibi hatao but with an eye on elections and nothing else. Central dispensations since her days have also done the same. The concerns that have been, and are being, voiced are more to satisfy critics that the government is not sleeping. There has never been a political will to deal with the problem of poverty. One reason perhaps is that there cannot be a more equitable distribution of wealth as the creamy layers will then be up in arms. Today, even the leftists are advising the poor to be prepared for sacrifices in the interest of their own descendants.

 Poverty has to be accepted as a way of life. In simple terms, people are poor because those who should be earning have no jobs or, in the villages, are overwhelmingly underemployed in terms of wages. The rates of gross domestic product growth that are flaunted periodically with much fanfare are of little relevance at the ground level because the benefits that are accrued get eaten up at the top. Yet, the poor also must eat and so their children also must work. So instead of going in for legislation that cannot be implemented, it would perhaps be better if the government seeks to ensure that working conditions improve, that even the unorganized sector is forced to pay statutory wages. Yes, this will amount to a compromise but in the given situation, such a concession will be better than trying to do something good for a section which is not wanted. Curb your generosity is what the government needs to be told politely.

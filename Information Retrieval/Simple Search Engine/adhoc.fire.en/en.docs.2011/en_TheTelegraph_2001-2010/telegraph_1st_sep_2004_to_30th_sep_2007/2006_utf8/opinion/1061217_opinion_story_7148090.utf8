The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STATE OF DENIAL

 Only the searing breath of another inferno can now force open the iron gates that keep children locked inside Bengals many sweatshops. With employers increasingly arming themselves with invincible proof of the absence of child workers in their factories, the key to these hellholes may be lost forever. Around 100 affidavits from factory-owners, denying the employment of children, have reached labour officials within the span of a fortnight. It is their alarming incidence that has aroused suspicion about the veracity of the claim. 

 The labour department of the government has sworn that it is not easily fooled and will carry on with its surprise raids. But the eagerness with which the legal recourse is being sought is proof enough that the document stands sufficient guarantee to save employers skins. The Rs 25 worth of paper, prima facie, assures safety from a likely Rs 20,000 fine and three-year jail term for the offender. It will appear more invaluable if one considers the fact that it imposes no longstanding responsibility on either the notary authority, which draws up the document, or the government authority, which is supposed to verify the claim. The labour department, which seems never to have doubted the instinctive fairness of the leather-goods manufacturers before the devastating fire in Topsia (after which the raids started) may show little difficulty in being dissuaded from its pro-active stance.

 There is reason to suspect a flagging of interest. Unlike states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the government in West Bengal has never tried to combat child labour on a war-footing. The implementation of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act months ago has hardly made a significant change in the attitude or the scene. One cannot underestimate the intrinsic problems in dealing with the situation. Childrens participation in family units of labour that cater to small-scale industries and their employment in the largely invisible and thereby unregulated sector of domestic labour often limit the states ability to intervene and act concertedly. But neither the leather nor the rubber industries are, strictly speaking, such units of work. A government, thinking so keenly about re-industrialization, and taking such concrete steps to relocate and refurbish the leather industry, could not have been unaware of its ways of functioning. It was, and still is, the collusion of state authorities and profit-hungry traders that keeps the children trapped in this web of treachery. 

 Backwardness, poverty and caste- and class-discrimination of the worst kind now make Uttar Pradesh the state to report the largest number of child workers in the country. The minimization of the same factors makes Kerala boast of the least number of child labourers. Perhaps it is time for Bengal to start looking for the keys that will set its children free.

 When angry girls need a buddy

Its called a breakup because its broken (HarperElement, Rs 195) by Greg Behrenht and Amiira Ruotola Behrendt is The Smart Girls Breakup Buddy for those wallowing in the aftermath of a breakup. It is sure to help the girls who have awesome thoughts, who believe that breakups suck, that their ex-lover was an asshole. In acknowledgement of the fact that tough guys too suffer from separations, there is an a bonus chapter at the end advising the dude to get off her lawn.

 How to placate an angry naga (Penguin, Rs 195)by Leena and Jiwesh Nandan is subtitled Finding Ones Feet in the IAS. The authors write from their own experience about the nature of life in the Indian Administrative Service. The book is dedicated to all diehard optimists who will opt for this job even after coming to know about the tribulations it entails right from the horses mouth. Though humorous at times, the work could have been better if the authors had been able to forget their target audience. The abundance of information on every aspect of Indian life seems quite redundant to an Indian reader. 

 Commentaries on living (Penguin, Rs 250) by J. Krishnamurti is a collection of essays from the notebooks of the well-known philosopher and teacher. Krishnamurti had attained a considerable following by his unassuming ways and simple teachings, which emphasized that social amelioration can be achieved only through individual change. The second of a three-volume series, this book has short, pithy essays on topics like boredom, chastity, the nature of desire and the fear of death. Most of these begin with an anecdote followed by a commentary on and analysis of the mental state under discussion. In Education and Integration, Krishnamurti says, To seek contentment through relationship is to be in fear Reality is what is; and passive awareness of what is contentment.

 Soulful living (Westland, Rs 250) edited by Rick and Mary NurrieStearns and Melissa West promises to start off The Process of Personal Transformation for its readers. However, it is doubtful if many would dare to take up that challenge since the list of contributors includes names like Sri Chinmoy and Thich Nhat Hanh and the picture of the rising phoenix on the front cover looks more like a phantom from a Hollywood horror flick.

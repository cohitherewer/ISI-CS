The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BRAIN DEAD

 The state of disarray knows no laws. Normal activities take on unusually ominous colours and extraordinary twists and turns. The national executive of the Bharatiya Janata Party, just concluded in Dehra Dun, saw the unusual sight of a veteran leader like Mr Murli Manohar Joshi walking out of the meeting in a huff after the first day. Leaders, old and young, squabbled. The general impression was that of a party which was leaderless and therefore mindless. The BJP, ever since it lost power at the Centre, has not been able to adjust to the reality of not being in office. It has failed woefully to play the role of a government-in-waiting. What is worse is that despite its numbers in the Lok Sabha, it is not even seen as the principal opposition to the United Progressive Alliance. One convenient explanation for this plight of the BJP is age. The top leadership of the BJP are all tired warriors of antiquated battles. They have run out of ideas, but they refuse to relinquish posts and responsibility. The vacuity is reflected in the issues and methods that they choose as political instruments. The party went into a tizzy when one of its senior leaders announced in his memoirs that he knew of a US mole in the office of the prime minister during the tenure of P.V. Narasimha Rao. Not only did he fail to name the mole but also failed to realize the embarrassment he was causing to his own party since he and his prime minister had not taken any action on the matter when the National Democratic Alliance was in power. Another leader, hoping that history would repeat itself, decided to go on a chariot ride. The gimmick had no impact. In another move of monumental folly, the BJP was seen to hobnob with the Samajwadi Party. The BJPs approach to politics has been haphazard, like a childs first attack on a jigsaw puzzle.

 But the age factor alone cannot explain the state of disarray. Even the younger elements in the BJP leadership have not been particularly inspiring in the world of ideas. They have been forming cabals against one another or expressing disgruntlement against the older leaders. Grumbling cannot galvanize a political party. The real failure of the BJP and this is at the root of its hapless condition is its inability to redefine itself. A significant section of its leadership would like to cut off the partys umbilical link with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, but lacks the courage to actually carry out the act. The BJP is a party frozen in transition. It does not know if it is Indias party of modernity or Hindutva.

 Political obituaries are invariably premature, but a party that appears brain-dead is poised on the brink of oblivion. A revival will need more than an act of remembrance. It will need courage that is now absent, and a will that is currently non-existent. The swan may not even sing.

 SPREAD THE GOOD CHEER

 NEHA SAHAY

 Rarely has such a storm been set off as is raging now in China. Nationality, culture, identity, globalization, Mao, modernization the entire range of issues that defines what it means to be a Chinese today has been covered in the online discussion.

 The spark for this fire was lit by the appeal, posted online by 10 PhD students studying in three prestigious universities in Beijing, to boycott Christmas. Clarifying that they respected everyones right to follow religion, the students deplored the celebration of a western religious festival by millions of Chinese who believed in no religion but simply went along with the Christmas frenzy. The government, they said, had failed to maintain Chinese traditions while modernizing the economy. Western culture sweeping over China like a storm was an example of the soft power with which the West was again enslaving China, said the students.

 Responses ranged from calling them PhD = Permanent Head Destroyed, to slogans such as Do it now say no to Christmas. It was just an occasion for the youth (most of whom lived away from home) to rest and enjoy, said most, why take it so seriously? Besides, it did wonders for the economy. In fact, 90 per cent of the worlds Christmas decorations were manufactured in China!

 Hadnt Chairman Mao advised us to first think of strengthening Chinas economy, argued one netizen. China had a lot of catching up to do. Once everyone had a warm bed, a cozy shelter, enough to eat, and social security so that even grandchildren were looked after, the Chinese would automatically stop celebrating Western festivals. We just need to be confident about what we are; these guys either have no brains or lack confidence, laughed a 26 year old executive, Tina, just back from celebrating Christmas in Hong Kong. Some compared the students to the government, which blamed others whenever it felt threatened. 

 Merry Maomas

 What angered many netizens was that students should presume to tell them what to celebrate and what not. The fact that they were PhD students seemed to get many peoples goats. PhDs are not supermen, wrote one, try the market; you may not even find a job. Focus on your own business, dont become a burden on the country. Dont think you are potential Marx, Mao, Sun [Yat-Sen] . Please, you PhD students, make some innovative inventions. Stop ranting about politics. You remind me of my lost years during the madness of the Red Guards, wrote a retired teacher, referring to the Cultural Revolution of the Sixties. Appalled that just when many people in the West are opening up to Chinese culture, these PhD idiots are asking us to close in to ourselves, one netizen asked students to have more faith in our own people! During the Cultural Revolution even Chinese traditions were said to be bad by the Red Guard students.

 Those on the other side were equally vocal. Starting with the practice of the Chinese adopting English names, they went on to lament that China was becoming a country of white worshippers. Some blamed the government for encouraging everything American instead of promoting Chinese products. A few even ran down Christmas as a time when the poor in the West incurred debts, and debunked Santa Claus as a lie.

 Most Westerners who participated in the discussion ridiculed the students, the government, Mao and all things Chinese; a few were surprisingly supportive. An Arab sympathized, saying his own country faced the same invasion. Out of all this, has come one really inventive solution: celebrating Christmas as Maomas. Pointing out that Maos birthday on December 26, fell on December 25 in the West (given the time gap), some genial souls suggested combining the two to make Christmas more meaningful. What would the current Chinese government say to that!

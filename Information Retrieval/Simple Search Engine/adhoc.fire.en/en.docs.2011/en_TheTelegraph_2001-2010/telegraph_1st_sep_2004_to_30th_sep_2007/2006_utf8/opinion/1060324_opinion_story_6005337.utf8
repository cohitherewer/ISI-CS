 CASE FOR COVER

 The history of a case in the courts can be as tortuous as the conflicting perceptions behind it are irreconcilable. Ms Shabina Begum, a schoolgirl in Britain fighting since 2002 for the right to wear a jilbab to school, has lost her case in the House of Lords. She had won last year in the court of appeal, which had overturned the high court?s ruling in favour of her school. The school took the case to the House of Lords. Her victory had made a mark in a Europe torn over Muslim women?s right to wear the headscarf, hijab, or the full-dress jilbab to schools and colleges. Britain had always been looked upon as the most accepting of differences in a multiracial society. But France?s decision to ban the headscarf had, at that time, given the campaign for the right to choose an extra edge.

 Ms Begum can still go to the European Court of Human Rights. Her case, together with those of the many young women brought up in the West yet choosing to claim their religion in their apparel as a mark of distinctive identity, has laid bare the inconsistencies at the heart of the notion of rights, and of secularism. Rights are universal only in theory; in application the right of one to display a faith as a mark of identity conflicts with another?s right to treat all faiths equally by erasing their external signs. When that another is the state, or a conglomeration of states of one dominant religion with no overt personal signifiers of it, the conflict becomes imbued with the politics of power and alleged suppression, becoming tangled with the issue of identity and difference in multiracial societies. It has been immeasurably worse for all sides since 9/11. A Western state can be accused of bias when it claims it is being neutral ? or secular, the desire to wear the hijab or jilbab can be interpreted as a fundamentalist tendency, while the girls wishing to choose feel besieged and cornered. Ms Begum?s judges have pointed out that the school she wants to continue in includes in its uniform choices such as the headscarf and apparel almost as obscuring as the jilbab. Besides, some of her peers would rather she was not allowed the jilbab either, because they would then be pressured to wear it as well. Rights and choices are problematic issues for women. The assertion of identity can never be a smooth process for them, but it would have been easier if they had to contend less with the clashing perceptions about religion, authority, freedom and integration.

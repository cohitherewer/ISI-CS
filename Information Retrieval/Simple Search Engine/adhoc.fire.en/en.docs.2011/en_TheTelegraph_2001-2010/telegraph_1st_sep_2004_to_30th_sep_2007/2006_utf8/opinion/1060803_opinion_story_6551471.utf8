 IS IT SELFISH TO WANT PEACE?

 Chirosree Basu interviews Visaka Dharmadasa, who is fighting to end the war in Sri Lanka

 Visaka Dharmadasa was one of the many silent sufferers of the conflict in Sri Lanka till she found out in 2003 that her son, a soldier in the Sri Lankan army, missing since 1998, was actually dead. Since then, she has been trying to mobilize public opinion in favour of peace through petitions, demonstrations and social work. She has persuaded key leaders on both sides of the battle lines to hold talks parallel to the peace process. The Association of War Affected Women, of which she is the chairperson, facilitates communication between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government. AWAW is doing post-tsunami rehabilitation work and intends to achieve peace through socio-economic development that enlists the active participation of war-affected women. 

 You have been a prime mover behind the ceasefire agreement in Sri Lanka. Could you tell us about your work?

 I am not the prime mover in the peace initiative. In 2002, together with the parents of servicemen, we initiated the first dialogue with the LTTE. Ours was the first civil society it met. They opened up for talks, the government responded positively, and then the Norwegian facilitators came in. We collected 70,000 signatures and gave it to the Norwegians in January 2002. Before the government formally went to the Norwegians, we, as the civil society, requested them to facilitate the peace process.

 How do you react to the present situation? Do you believe the peace process has been completely derailed?

 As anywhere else in the world, bringing peace is a difficult task. We never expected the path to be rosy, although we did not expect it to deteriorate in this way. We feel frustrated, but we still believe that negotiation is the only way and we will work for that. We want the government and the LTTE to sit together and talk, instead of sending out contrary signals through the media.

Is it only the LTTE or are there other Tamil leaders you are trying to reach out to?

 For me it is only the LTTE because the fighting is between the LTTE and the government. However, everybodys opinion is important and inclusiveness is what we are aiming for.

 What are you planning to do?

 I have told the LTTE, at least for once, be the good guys. We know the government will try to stick to the table because, to be fair, it has been flexible. It is the LTTE which has not been so. Even the slightest pretext was used as a reason to march out. Of course, there will be differences because the government does not comprise one party. It has people and it has a political party consisting of extremists who see no way other than causing chaos in the country, and pain and suffering to the people, to show that they are the liberators, in order to come back to power. With the JVP, it is that much more difficult for the government to be there [at the table]. But even then, if it can manage to do it, the LTTE should also be able to do it and show some flexibility.

 How did you get drawn into this?

 In 1998, when my son went missing, we established the Parents of Servicemen Missing in Action. We wanted to know the fate of those missing, and to prevent others from it. To do that, we knew we had to bring peace. And to bring peace, we needed to work with mothers from the other side of the divide. For that, we established the Association of War Affected Women. But not just mothers, our organization has initiated the Track Two level dialogue process, which means we are working with people who can influence the government and the LTTE. The outcome is fed into the official peace process. In a personal capacity, not as government messengers, we go to the LTTE, to try to gauge what they are thinking, and bring it back to Colombo. We try to touch the humaneness on both sides.

 What exactly is the feeling on the other side of the divide?

 They also feel, why did this have to happen? Why couldnt it be settled by talking, why do our sons have to die?

 Isnt the feeling different among those committed to the cause of the Tamil homeland? 

 There are many backward areas, heavily militarized by the LTTE, and in these the feeling may be that this is the only way out. But war is very painful. All goodness and bravery vanish when your closest ones die. Nobody really wants a war...For me, security means making your enemy secure. If you have no enemy, then you have no use for the pieces of iron we call weapons...Killing a person is not going to solve anything. It is better to have him alive, to talk to him and win him over.

 How different is this government, given the radical elements in it?

 The peace efforts have continued because of His Excellency, Mahinda Rajapakse. He was a human rights worker and after becoming president, he made some very good speeches. But the appointments he made were not in the direction of making peace. There is a lack of depth of understanding of the problem. Mahinda Rajapakse was never close to the peace process at any time. The whole process is thus very new to him. This also has its advantages. Because he is new, he may be open to new ways of thinking. 

 The ceasefire agreement mediated by the Norwegians has been seen as a sellout. What do you say?

 The ceasefire agreement cannot be ignored. That is still the piece of paper which stops the killings. For me, it is the life of the country and its youth. I value that document more than any other. The same for the Post-Tsunami Operational Management Structure.

 What do you think about the suicide bombing by the pregnant LTTE woman?

 As a woman I feel ashamed, especially as a mother. Whoever she was, perhaps the most brave LTTE worker, she was a mother. Whether LTTE or not, she was the one who agreed to commit the crime.

 So you dont see women as being without agency in the war? But isnt this war fought and decided by men?

 Women definitely have an agency in this war as they have in peace. Even LTTE women. We try to bring them into the peace process. I want them to be back and to fit into society. Which means not only rehabilitation, but also reintegration. I want them back with their dignity, whatever their cause for joining the LTTE. The practice of violence is definitely wrong, but their ideology, the discrimination they have faced, are real. There is a cause for which they are fighting.

 You think women can help the process?

 Yes. There is total mistrust. If women are at the table, then some personal rapport can be made to work. There should be women from both sides, at least as observers.

 But wouldnt women representatives want to preserve the interests of the respective parties, just as men would?

 Of course they would. But at least men wont behave violently in the presence of women. Body behaviour can be regulated, and feelings can be built across the table. Women are more equipped in that than men. The peace process will be a more inclusive one if women are there. 

 Is the LTTE willing to bring in women to the table?

 They will definitely bring women. Unfortunately, for the government, everything is so politicized that it is afraid of bringing in women who do not belong to the parties that are part of it. The lack of capable women is not the question here. There are several very capable ones, like Mrs Sunila Abyesekara. But she is not affiliated to any political party.

 Tell us about your post-tsunami reconstruction effort. 

 We have selected a sensitive village Kokkilai in the Mullati district. Thousands of people in that village were displaced by conflict. We wanted to build some infrastructure so that the Sinhalese and the original Tamil inhabitants could live harmoniously. There is a healthcare unit, also a craft centre for women. We want to have such centres in eight other districts.

 You have been insisting on proper funeral rites for dead soldiers.

 Yes. We say that if you cannot identify the body, bury it, dont cremate it. That is also what the international law says. For politicians, it hardly means anything. Their children are not called upon to do any such duty. But the brave men who go to defend their country are given such treatment. So, the best thing is, dont go to war. I am saying this from experience. I have not opened the NGO for love of the world or any highfalutin ideology. Sheer selfishness of saving my other child drives me to say no to war. Now that I have tasted the bad, I am trying to do something right.

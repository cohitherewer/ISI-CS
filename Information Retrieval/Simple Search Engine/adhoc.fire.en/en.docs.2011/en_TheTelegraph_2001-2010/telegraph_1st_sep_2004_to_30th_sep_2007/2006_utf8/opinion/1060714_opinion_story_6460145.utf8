 Food for thought

 Sir ? Politicians and businessmen are ruthlessly exploiting farmers in the name of industrial development (?Riot on land for Reliance?, July 9). It appears that there is no land available for development other than agricultural land. But the trend to acquire farmland for industry, coupled with the decline in productivity of the land, is robbing farmers of their livelihood. Despite the fact that three decades of urbanization and industrialization have swallowed more agricultural land than that reclaimed, the economic indicators for many Indian states are not rosy. Things become even murkier when Reliance, the industrial group concerned in the present instance, and the chief minister of the state, Mulayam Singh Yadav, pleads ignorance after a riot of such scale. The National Human Rights Commission should step in to help the affected farmers in different states. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? As they progress, societies become less dependent on agriculture and more dependent on industry. This is a truth accepted universally. But the idea that all societies will be able to emulate the rich industrialized economies that progress fast but do not worry about food security, is ill-founded. Such developed nations usually have a relatively small population. Even China is a wrong model to compare India with. China?s industrialization was so fast that agriculture?s contribution to the gross domestic product came down steadily without any impact on total agricultural production. The country has also maintained a tight leash on its birth rate. Such factors are altogether absent in the Indian context. India has an ever-expanding population that needs food at reasonable rates before anything else. If every country follows the path of rapid industrialization at the cost of agriculture, then who would feed the population? 

 It must be remembered that agricultural land cannot be retrieved once it has been converted for industrial purposes. Nor is it feasible for farmers to always graduate into industrial workers. Had rapid industrialization been the answer to farmers? problems, why are they committing suicide in different parts of India? Industrialization will never succeed in enhancing the purchasing power of the rural poor without which there can be no tangible growth in India. Perhaps a fresh set of land reforms could help the marginal farmer since fragmentation of land often pushes him below subsistence levels. For India, food security is no less important than industrial development.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Of late, the West Bengal government has been seriously wooing investors, both domestic and foreign, to counter the challenges of unemployment and de-industrialization. Calcutta?s adjoining districts are the first choice of investors for acquiring land for their industries. The reason is their comparatively better infrastructure and existing port and aviation facilities. But such land is often the source of livelihood for the weaker sections of society. The acquisition of land for industrial development means the displacement of these people. That is, their evacuation without any promises of compensation or re-employment. 

 However, agitations against land acquisition would not solve the problems of the have-nots. Opposition parties in the state as well as certain groups within the Left Front usually have a hand in such agitation. So it is clear that the protests are organized with an eye to the vote bank. Some left politicians are convinced that the uplift of the toiling masses is only possible through industrialization. Nevertheless, certain preconditions need to be imposed on investors while allocating them land of their choice. Good primary schools, health centres, and industrial training institutes for the sons of the soil must precede any construction on such land. Those who will be directly affected by the loss of their land must first be convinced by visible action ? and not by assurances ? of the benefits of industrialization. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Chakraborty, Barrackpore

 Same as usual

 Sir ? The article ,?The more it changes the more it remains the same?, (July 5), rightly documented the recent changes in the North-east. While the Centre and the Nagas seem to be in a permanent deadlock over the issue of a Greater Nagalim, there is reason to pin hopes on the Centre?s talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom. The Union government and the chief minister of Assam may agree to the rebels? demand for the release of Ulfa prisoners in order to push ahead with the talks. After all, this has been a watershed development in the political history of state. Counter-insurgency operations, if undertaken by the army, could upset the peace talks. But the Ulfa, despite the peace efforts, continues to slap extortion notices on public sector units in the state. It is apparent that the banned outfit is in dire need of funds for its operations. Therefore, in the next round of talks, the Centre should be assertive and ask the Ulfa to refrain from extortion.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Future talks with the Ulfa would be meaningless if the Centre continues to give in to its unwarranted demands. And there would invariably be other rebel groups trying to armtwist the government into parting with more.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Erratum

 In Sumit Mitra?s article, ?Slow train coming round the bend? (July 13), the sentence, ?The chief minister has no doubt put in admirable efforts to change the perception of Bengal being the best place for man and capital to exit?, has been printed with the last word as ?exist?. The error is regretted.

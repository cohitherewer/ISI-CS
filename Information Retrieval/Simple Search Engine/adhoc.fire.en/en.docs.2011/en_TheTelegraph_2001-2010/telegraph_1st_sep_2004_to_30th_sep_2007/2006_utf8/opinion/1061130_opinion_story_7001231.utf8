 THE LILIES THAT TOIL AND SPIN

 In Kalsa, Anusua Mukherjee finds children, mainly girls, dropping out of school because they must embroider saris to augment the family income

 All work and no play

 A trip to Kalsa, a village some 40 kilometres to the south of Calcutta, on a mellow autumn morning might count as a picnic for most city-dwellers. Till one reaches the village, nothing meets the eye but a clear blue sky lying languidly over yellow-green paddy fields. And in the village itself, the nudging and giggling children on their way to the local school seem straight out of pamphlets publicizing the success of schemes for universal primary education. But a closer look around and a talk with the teachers would be enough to shatter the illusion. For, at a time when some of the children are getting ready to concentrate on their lessons in school, an almost equal number can be seen poring over yards of chiffon saris stretched across huge wooden frames.

 These children are busy embellishing the saris with beads, chumki and zari. This is a thriving business in certain villages of South 24 Parganas like Kalsa, Harishpur and Dholtikari. Middlemen, called the ostagars (tailors), hand over the raw material in the form of clothes, threads and decorations to the families. Members of the family then get together to finish the work. The children start sharing the workload from an early age, thus helping financially as well. They are given assignments of their own on attaining sufficient skill. 

 Even when the children work independently, their labour is hardly counted in its own right. In most cases, the child workers continue to be considered as extensions of the family unit, picking up the required skill while working with the elders. For whatever work the children do, the middlemen hand over the money to the parents. There are no fixed wages, which usually vary from Rs 300 to 600 for a single sari. The middlemen haggle to lower the rate if the minors do the work. In fact, the middlemen are only too eager to make the children do the work since they can easily be paid less. A bulk of the children in the villages drops out of school to contribute to the family income. And once they begin to earn, spending time and money on studies seems a luxury.

 The embroidery on the saris is usually very intricate, requiring continuous straining of the eyes. Electricity has not reached most of the village homes and so the children work in the light of the lanterns, damaging their eyesight at an early age. The work becomes more difficult to execute in summer when sweating is profuse and the tiniest stain might cause a sari to be rejected. The children labour in the open then, fighting the heat and mosquitoes. Egg shells are burnt to ward the mosquitoes off since a swat might cause a damaging stain. The children who have the determination to continue with their studies use the time before and after school hours in working on the saris, besides doing the usual household chores. Which means that they are left with no time that can be termed leisure.

 The teachers of the village schools complain that they often lose their best students to zari work. The educated few in the villages are aware of the fact that under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, the employment of children under 14 in hazardous occupations is a punishable offence. But they acknowledge their helplessness in the face of the reality surrounding zari work. When a particular senior teacher was asked to do something about the children dropping out of school, he threw up his hands in despair and said that nothing can be done about it. Apparently, the job is so lucrative that even his wife and children have taken it up. 

 The affluent artisans, who have workshops in the villages, and the middlemen believe that they are doing more good than harm by providing the children with the opportunity to earn their livelihood. They argue that the work does not interfere with the childrens studies since they labour in their spare time. The artisans say that they would have been glad to pay the children better wages for their work had it not been for the exploitation they face themselves. Since the government has not fixed a minimum rate for the work, the price of the saris fluctuates according to market demand. The artisans, living in the remote villages, have little idea about the actual price the saris command in the market. So they remain at the mercy of the retailers, who try their best to keep a considerable margin between the price of purchase and that of sale. 

 The problems facing the artisans are not unlike that of the children they employ. These have their roots in the fact that zari work is part of the informal service sector. Because of this, neither the employers nor the child employees can claim their rights. The childrens helplessness is, of course, greater than that of their employers. No matter how much time they devote to the work, their labour always remains invisible. Even the parents, when interrogated, hurriedly dismissed their childrens work as mere helping around the household. Their behaviour is not surprising, given the fact that the families can ill afford to lose an earning member and then provide for his/her education. The children are also reluctant to give up the work that brings relative prosperity to their family. 

 The girl is usually worse affected by the work than boys are. Girls might be as good at their work as the boys. Yet, they are never qualified as skilled artisans. Boys get that honour when they acquire enough expertise and their wages increase accordingly. This fact notwithstanding, girls continue to drop out of schools at an alarming rate, either to devote the time spent on studying to zari work instead, or to get married or, in most cases, to do both. Social and economic pressures do not offer them much of a chance to get education and independence. And very few mothers are able to envisage a different future for their daughters. A mother who was sitting at her loom almost gasped when asked whether her young son would take over after her. She declared proudly that she wants her son to study and not spoil his health by doing the strenuous job from a tender age. One wonders whether she would have said the same if her child had been a daughter.

 Ironically, the workers never get to wear the clothes they make. With a single well-made sari selling for about Rs 30,000 in the urban markets, there is no way in which the workers can afford the saris, even as part of the wedding trousseau. The girls nodded ruefully when asked whether they regret this fact. However, they added, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they get themselves photographed in the richly decorated saris before the middlemen can lay their hands on the booty.

 There is a huge distance between the children toiling by the lamplight in the villages and the finished saris dazzling brightly in the city shops or adorning the bodies of glamorous women. Perhaps, it is only the irrepressible energy of childhood that makes these children smile gleefully while being burdened with undue labour. Enquiries as to whether they would like to attend school instead produced an eager answer in the affirmative. The reason, however, was unexpected coming to school would give them the time to play, they declared enthusiastically.

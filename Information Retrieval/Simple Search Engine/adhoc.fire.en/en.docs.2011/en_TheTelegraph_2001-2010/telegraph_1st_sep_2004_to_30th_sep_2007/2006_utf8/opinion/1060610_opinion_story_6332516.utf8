 THE EGG AND THE CHICKEN

 Scientists are claiming that they have found an answer to one of the oldest conundrums. They claim that the egg came before the chicken. The reason for this claim is the fact that genetic material does not change during an animal?s life. Therefore the first bird that evolved into what is today recognized as a chicken first existed as an embryo inside an egg. Scientists working in the field of evolutionary genetics will definitely elaborate on the reasons for their claim and perhaps in the future the egg?s precedence over the chicken will become part of common knowledge, and the chicken and egg problem will become a thing of the past. But the impact of this claim will not be confined to the discipline of evolutionary genetics alone. Its implications are profound and far-reaching.

 The discovery that the egg came first actually strikes at the very root of the oldest controversy in the world ? the debate between the theists and the atheists. The former have always asserted that god created all living things by exercising his divine powers of creation. The classic description of this process is available in the opening chapter of The Bible. Genesis describes how god created the world and all the living creatures in a burst of creative energy spread over six days. Creation myths in other cultures and religions have also focused on the role of divinity in creation, and on the indispensable role of god in the creative process. Atheists, on the other hand, spurred on by the discoveries of science, especially the theories of Charles Darwin, have argued that living beings rather than being created through divine intervention have evolved over a period of time. There was a process of evolution from the egg to the bird which is traceable and comprehensible. There is no mysterious power that makes this possible. Theists believe that the bird came first because god created it, and then the bird laid the first egg. Atheists have argued that the egg had to come first since there never was a first act of creation. Similarly, following Darwin, most people believe that Homo erectus evolved from primates, and are not children of the first man and woman created by god. Atheists seem to have had a shot in the arm from what scientists are saying.

 The claims of the scientists have philosophical ramifications. Philosophers since the time of Plato and later St Thomas Aquinas have argued over the importance of mind over matter. Idealists have continued to argue that the idea of a thing is more important than the thing itself. Materialists, on the other hand, have placed more importance on existence and material conditions. If god created the bird, he must have had the idea of a bird to create it; but if the egg came first, there was no pre-existing idea of the bird. Idealist philosophers may well have to rethink some of their positions. Philosophers can now say that matter precedes mind without being accused of putting the cart before the horse.

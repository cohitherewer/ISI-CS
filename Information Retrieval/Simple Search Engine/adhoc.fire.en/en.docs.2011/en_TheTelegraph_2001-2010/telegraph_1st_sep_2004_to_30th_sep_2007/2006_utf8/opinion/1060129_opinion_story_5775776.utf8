 DIARY

 The takeover of one private airline company by another has made headlines over the last few weeks. But the takeover has found appreciation from a rather unlikely quarter ? the special protection group in charge of Sonia Gandhi?s security. The SPG has been handling a delicate problem ? involving the Congress president?s refusal to travel on a particular airline ? for about seven years now. Normally, Madam is not too fussy about her security arrangements. But whenever this airline was concerned, she is known to have preferred to wait for hours, or even travel by train. One can imagine the ordeal this must have meant for the SPG. Now the gentlemen attending on Madam can tick one worry off their list.

 What is the price of casting aspersions on the ruling dynasty of the country? Ask Arun Jaitley. Within 48 hours of accusing the Manmohan Singh government of helping Ottavio Quattrochhi lay his hands on an additional 21 crore rupees of the Bofors loot, the armed guards posted outside Jaitley?s residence were withdrawn. Also gone was the armed escort who used to accompany the BJP leader in his vehicle wherever he went in the capital. Not only is Jaitley now left with a lone unarmed cop outside his house, he was not even taken into confidence by the Union home ministry before it stripped his security. Surely the legal eagle is not taking this lying down?

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee may not have succeeded in pushing his candidate, Varun Gandhi, to the BJP gen-sec?s post (as those who watched this space last week will remember), but he now has one offer which the party might find difficult to refuse. The grand old man of the BJP wants Brajesh Mishra, his former aide, to be sent to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh.The nomination is almost certain to go through. Insiders reveal that Mishra is quite excited about his transition from a behind-the-scenes player to a politician. It must also be a good feeling to be welcomed, particularly after Mishra?s wish of being consulted by the UPA government on national security concerns has been rebuffed. Apparently, the Manmohan Singh government did not think it was a good idea to accept the services of someone with such close links with the principal opposition party.

 Wit and articulateness sit easy on our Bihari parliamentarians. One of them, the Union rural development minister, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, was not fazed at all when a lady journo asked why his party, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, was so bitterly opposed to the women?s reservation bill. The minister immediately began reeling out statistics: the secretary in his ministry was a woman, and so were five of the eight joint secretaries. ?Show me another ministry which has so many women at senior posts,? he challenged. It must be the media again, they will go to any length to corner our politicos.

 Finally, the true story about how the cookie crumbled. When all efforts seemed to have been exhausted and still Buta Singh refused to see reason, a Congressman called on him, and gently whispered Arjun Singh, Bhopal and 1989 in his ears. And this reminded Buta that he was among those sent to Bhopal in 1989 when Arjun Singh was refusing to step down as chief minister after a court ruling against the latter. It did not take very long after that for Buta Singh?s resignation to reach Delhi.

 The newest casualty in the BJP?s political vocabulary is the word CD. Pramod Mahajan was recently heard asking party delegates to take the ?cassette? along, when he actually meant a CD. When his attention was drawn to the error, he quipped that if he had used the right word, it would definitely have been taken otherwise. Not to mention that journos would immediately prick up their ears.

 Right after Sonia Gandhi extolled the virtues of maintaining a simple lifestyle, a select group of Congressmen got a dinner invitation from the Shiv Sena-turned-Congress MP, Sanjay Nirupam. The entertainment menu is known to have included filmstars and bar dancers.

 When most Congress leaders were making a beeline for Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, a few dedicated souls were at their helpful best. Such as Digvijay Singh. Congress delegates from Bengal to Kerala were delighted to find a patient listener and caring organizer in Diggy Raja. His troubleshooting skills came in particularly handy with delegates who were too busy catching the eyes of Madam and son. Naturally, they forgot to make arrangements for such essentials as boarding, travel and food. But they had no reason for worry. A call to ?Diggy helpline?, and they got cars or hotel accommodation, or even a plate of biryani and some ale. But, since one man?s meat is always another?s poison, soon Digvijay-baiters were heard saying that it is easy to play Santa when someone else is paying. Some even suggested that Digvijay being the AICC?s man in charge of Andhra Pradesh, he couldn?t possibly let slip this opportunity to show who?s the king on this turf!

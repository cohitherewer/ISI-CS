 Abhradeep Sen likes to buy the trendiest of clothes for his 12-year-old daughter, Jasmine. His wife is a bit apprehensive about this, but Sen feels that his daughter will be more confident of her body when she is older if she gets used to wearing skimpy clothes right now. 

 Sourabh Dass 75-year-old mother may raise her eyebrows, but he has gone ahead and enrolled his daughter and son in a dance school. The public relations officer believes that his children need to swing to popular Hindi film music because it will help them acquire a confident body language. 

 Till last year, 42-year-old Pradip Dasguptas favourite attire at home was his kurta-pajama. Now he wears shorts and a sleeveless T-shirt because he feels it gives him a trendy look. A year ago, he would have been worried about his neighbours sniggering. These days, they themselves are pretty open to changing dress codes. 

 Champa Mitra had no qualms about cooking fresh food for every meal. But, over the past 14 months, shes been cooking only once a day. A microwave oven has made things easier for her. Her husband was once finicky about eating fresh food. But his eating habits are changing, thanks possibly to his colleagues, many of whom like to eat out.

Call it a brand new attitude or a 21st century class struggle, but the Bengali Middle Class (BMC) is morphing. Just the other day, the quintessential Bong was cocooned in his middle-class values, safely ensconsed in tradition. Today, as a Telegraph-MODE survey reveals, the Bengali in Calcutta is all set for a dramatic metamorphosis. 

 In almost every field ? from clothes to food to social habits ? the citys Bengali middle class is changing. Gone are the days when a BMC would subscribe to a life of restraint and modesty. Family axioms such as no late night parties, no alcohol, no impulsive decisions and no luxuries are being obliterated with remarkable ease. 

 The statistics say it all. About 95 per cent of those surveyed agree that the BMC today is more modern and less conservative in outlook than it once was, while 42 per cent in the 20-50 age group care little about issues pertaining to morality. Eighty-two per cent feel it is important to be trendy and confident, and one out of every four polled loves to eat out. 

 A casual visit to Pizza Hut or a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) outlet on any given day would back the statistics. The swelling BMC crowd ? which couldnt think beyond machher jhol aar bhaat (fish curry and rice) till the other day ? can be spotted tucking into crispy drums of heaven or smacking their lips after a spicy chicken and mushroom pizza. 

 The number of BMCs coming to our Calcutta outlets has almost doubled in the last 18 months, says Arvind Mediratta, chief marketing officer, Indian subcontinent, of the YUM! Restaurants International ? the global chain that owns the Pizza Hut and KFC outlets in the country. Mediratta attributes this new consumer trend primarily to a global exposure along with the BMCs realisation that eating out is also a way of socialising. 

 Calcutta-based sales executive Shivaji Mahapatra agrees that the more exposed BMC is adapting to different kinds of cuisine. Since we ? the younger generation ? are travelling more, we are acquiring new tastes and opening up to a menu beyond the patented home food, he says. And Bengalis have amazing taste buds. They can adapt to any taste they wish to. 

Its not only eating habits that are changing. As far as dress codes go, the shift has been revealing, literally. From cautious and diffident to bold and wild ? is how fashion gurus sum up the transformation. Suresh Sadhwani, area manager, Pantaloons, agrees. Culturally, the BMC is evolving. With malls and multiplexes having become a part of our lives, the otherwise self-conscious Bongs are shedding their inhibitions to be in sync with the predominating cultural ambience. Naveen Mishra, unit head, Shoppers Stop, adds, Western wear and spaghetti straps are no longer strict no-nos for the BMC. Rather, it is all set to explore fresh options. 

 Take the case of Suhashini Chakravarti. An officegoer, she used to tie up her long hair and wear the dullest of cotton sarees to work. A salwar kameez that she wore to an office party ? and the praise that her colleagues showered on her ? changed her attire forever. Today, Suhashini wears short chiffon kurtas, sunshades and sweat shoes. I guess it somewhere made me feel very happy to look pretty and young. And I could see it that it was contrary to what I felt in a saree, she says. 

 Not surprisingly, Sadhwani estimates that 70 per cent of the customers at the Gariahat branch of Pantaloons comprise the BMC, while Mishra contends that the Elgin Road outlet of Shoppers Stop has recorded a 40-45 per cent increase of the BMC in the past couple of years. 

 A tour around the city underscores the change that has been taking place. 

 Calcutta is spilling over with restaurants. Between March and December 2005, 40-odd restaurants and hotels, both small and big, came up in Calcutta. Shopping experiences have changed with malls such as City Centre, Forum, Big Bazaar and Emami mushrooming all over the city. Shopping was a ritualistic ordeal till the other day, but not any longer, says Sarbani Dutta, an ad executive with, what she calls, a moderate income. I love it.

Multiplexes such as Inox, Forum, Fame and 89 Cinemas 

have opened up in the last few years. The number of car showrooms is on the rise. 

The biggest brands have their showrooms, too ? many of which are located in middle-class 

Bengali localities. 

 Clearly, the traditional Bengali is raring for a make-over. And there are good reasons for that. For one, there is more money to spend. Earlier, an average BMC family had primarily a single earning member. Now every other household has a double income. Among the younger lot, a working couple is the accepted norm, says Soma Sur, who teaches at the Army Institute of Management. In families of older people, sons and daughters have started earning. 

 Work avenues are opening up as well. Government jobs 

are no longer the only option. There are jobs in the private sector: in banks, 

hospitals, hotels, call centres and so on. Not surprisingly, spend now is the 

new mantra. 

 New consumer groups are being added to the old lot: teenagers working part-time for the extra buck, IT professionals earning a fat packet, young entrepreneurial professionals in new business and services, highly-skilled IT professionals with high mobility ? both economic and social ? and even an affluent rural segment migrating to the city for education or work. 

 With ample cash to splurge and a plethora of options, the BMC is realising that the aspirational quality of life is within its solid grasp. Partying into the night or even cribbing about life over a few pegs with friends is no longer taboo. Alcohol, in fact ? once frowned upon ? is no big deal any more. Gautam Basus parents remember when they did not allow the 19-year-old to party. Of late, they feel that he is not acquiring the skills of social interaction and are encouraging him to attend late-night dos. 

 Till the other day, alcohol was banned in Chandan Moitras family, just like in any other middle-class Bengali household. But the Calcutta-based business professional stresses that he has to keep his clients happy. Serving drinks helps them unwind, and thats when they open up and deals are sealed. My father doesnt approve of this but he has to understand my compulsions, he says. 

 Even a couple of years ago, not just drinking at home but even an unconventional hair cut could make or break a home. Ask Sabina Yah, an entrepreneur and hair stylist who runs Sunflower, a chic beauty parlour on Park Street, and she says, Things have changed. There has been a 100 per cent shift in the attitude of BMC women, especially working women. They have realised that looks matter and so does presentation. So, they want a trendy look at any cost. 

We were modest 

 Moti Nandi, the Bengali author who won the 

Sahitya Akademi Award in 1991, compares the present with the past 

 The Bengali Middle Class family household has changed dramatically. Any middle 

class Bengali today has loads of electronic gadgets at his disposal. Nobody cares 

to read a book anymore. The BMC may go to the book fair, but I doubt whether they 

buy books. 

 When I was a young man, Calcutta was not overcrowded with buses, people, shops 

and temptations. In every sphere of life, we were modest. At college, dhoti and 

shirt was the usual dress code. We never bothered much about food. My mother was 

from Barishal in Bangladesh, and she used to cook a very modest meal. Today, TV 

programmes are aired to teach you to cook. I used to stay in the Shobhabazar-Darzipara 

area. A refreshing adda with my circle of friends at a para tea shop was a regular 

incentive. 

 To sum up, it was a life of contentment. 

Style, by default, comes with shape. Sociologists 

believe, with the predominating influence of globalisation and consumerism, it 

is but natural that you start living up to a chic, metropolitan image. The Bengali 

is no longer scared of the gym ? and can be seen working out on the treadmill 

to keep in shape. Every locality, on an average, has two health clubs or gyms. 

 Not everybody, however, is comfortable with the make-over. Rahul Pyne, 32, invested in share markets and the returns made him rich. He bought a car, then he started wearing branded stuff and now goes to a discotheque regularly. But, even today, he gets cold feet when he goes to a multiplex to buy a movie ticket. Pyne fears that he may not be looking hip enough ? and that he would be spotted as what he is, a middle-class Bengali. 

 Not surprisingly, five to seven people in the 30-40 age group visit consultant psychiatrist J.R. Ram every week. Trying to change too much produces a conflict within yourself, Ram explains. When your core values receive a jolt, you feel neither here nor there. 

 Added to this element of confusion is an element of apprehension prevailing among the older generation. The survey shows that 91 per cent in the 60-75 age group feel that the BMC is going wild and losing its family values. 

 The frenzy to break free of ones assigned social mould may have its repercussions too. Says psychologist Mallika Banerjee, head of the department of psychology, Calcutta University, All of us have a coping strategy. When that goes beyond us, our cognition is affected. Our perception of life changes, emotions and passions get out of control and upsets our thought processes. The end result is conflict. 

 The apprehension is real ? but the BMC shows little signs of withstanding the winds of change. After all, theres a revolution knocking at its doors.

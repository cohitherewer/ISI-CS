 THE UNKINDEST CUT

 The battle for the presidentship of the Cricket Association of Bengal may be even less of a skirmish than the one that took place 249 years ago at Plassey, but Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya might well feel that he has already found his Mir Jafar. The self-styled nawab of the CAB, Mr Dalmiya had been, till the other day, the biggest champion of West Bengal?s hero, Sourav Ganguly. At every critical juncture of the latter?s career ? from his first selection into the Indian squad to his becoming captain ? he received Mr Dalmiya?s support. But when Mr Dalmiya most needed his support, Ganguly has accused him of ?playing?? with his career. The accusation could not have come at a worse time for Mr Dalmiya. He is poised to meet a challenger who has the direct support of West Bengal?s chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. His umbrage was evident from his comment that since he was no longer in power, he could not expect any loyalty. Cricket knows of the late cut and the square cut, but for Mr Dalmiya the comment from Ganguly must be the unkindest cut. The timing of the comment was better than what Ganguly displayed when he fished at fast short-pitched deliveries outside the off stump.

 Ganguly cannot deny that Mr Dalmiya has been his godfather in the world of cricket. Ganguly?s turn-around is more than a betrayal: it is attempted patricide. Mr Dalmiya, if he does fall from power, could well utter the words that Shakespeare put in the mouth of Julius Caesar as his favourite Brutus stabbed him: ?Et tu Brute?? ? you too, Brutus. Or Mr Dalmiya could ponder the plight of the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, who was imprisoned and humiliated by his son, Aurangzeb. There is, of course, no need to reach that far back into history. Nearer home there is the example of Mr Siddhartha Sankar Ray who turned against his mentor Bidhan Chandra Roy. Or that of Mr Pranab Mukherjee who deserted Ajoy Mukherjee and joined the Congress. There are many other similarly notorious incidents including Indira Gandhi?s desiccation of the Syndicate once she became prime minister.

 What is significant about Ganguly?s attack against his godfather is the fact that it has taken place in the world of cricket. Treachery in the world of politics, however appalling, is not entirely unexpected. Politics has never been an arena of high ideals which are endlessly invoked. They are seldom adhered to. But cricket, the assumption has been, was different. It was a world informed by a sense of honour. Playing with a straight bat was more than a technical accomplishment. Not playing cricket had come to be considered the worst form of abuse: something that a gentleman did not expect of another gentleman. It is obvious that now all this belongs to cricket?s ancien r?gime. Honourable men are as rare as those who always play cricket.

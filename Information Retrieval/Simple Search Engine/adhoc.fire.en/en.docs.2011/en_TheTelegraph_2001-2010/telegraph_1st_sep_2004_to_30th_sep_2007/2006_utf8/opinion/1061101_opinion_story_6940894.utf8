 DANGERS AHEAD

 Failures of a political system and constitutional crises often go together. The unusual decision of Bangladeshs president, Mr Iajuddin Ahmed, to take over the reins of the caretaker government is a case in point. The decision followed the failure of the political parties to agree on a name for the head of the interim government. But Mr Ahmeds move, instead of solving the problem, could worsen it. The first hint of this came in the Awami League-led oppositions refusal to accept Mr Ahmeds decision. However, since the League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have a history of disagreeing on everything, it is difficult to see how the issue of the chief of the caretaker government could have been resolved to the satisfaction of the two largest political groups. The provision for a non-partisan caretaker government that would run the country till the next elections should be good for democracy anywhere. But the way the outgoing government of Ms Khaleda Zia sought to put one of its trusted men in charge of the interim administration shows how self-serving politicians can abuse well-intentioned constitutional and legal provisions. 

 Mr Ahmed has a challenging road ahead. He must not only be neutral but also appear to be so in his next steps. He had been a nominee of the BNP for the presidents job and hence carries the stamp of his political loyalty. Given the sharp polarization in Bangladesh politics, each of his steps will be closely scrutinized by the opposition parties. That, precisely, is Mr Ahmeds challenge. It is up to him to prove that he can rise above partisan politics. The first test will come when he chooses his team for the interim administration. How he tackles the oppositions demand for electoral reforms will also test his commitment to democracy. It is not enough for him to assure the people that the next elections will be held on time. He has to make the polls free and credible.

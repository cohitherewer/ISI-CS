 PEACE MISSION

 The portrait of a writer as a peacemaker is not very common in modern-day politics. It is thus unique that the Naxalites of Andhra Pradesh want the Assamese writer, Ms Indira Goswami, to broker peace between them and the government. It is, first of all, a recognition of Ms Goswami?s peacemaking role between the Centre and the United Liberation Front of Asom. It acquires a different dimension if one remembers that the rebels of Andhra Pradesh, unlike their Assamese counterparts, are prompted by the Maoist ideology. Maoist guerrillas, who live and die for their ideology, are not easily moved by the power of art or artists. The fact that they have approached Ms Goswami to talk to the government on their behalf shows a significant departure from their known strategy. Irrespective of what happens to this initiative, it may have its ripples in the ranks of Maoist or other rebels active in other parts of India. It is possible that the Maoists of Chhattisgarh will someday want to involve the civil society or some eminent individuals in peace efforts with the government. The point of course is that there are many ways to make peace. Negotiations with the government also can take many forms. 

 The signal from Andhra Pradesh may point to a larger context. Throughout India, rebel groups are moving closer to peace initiatives. Assamese, Naga or Bodo insurgents are showing such signs after decades of armed conflicts with the state. In Kashmir, secessionists led by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference have resumed talks with the Centre. Even in neighbouring Nepal, the Maoists have taken a big leap forward toward peace and democratic politics. Not all peace moves have come to fruition. There still remain many unresolved issues between different rebel groups and the government. In Chhattisgarh and elsewhere, Maoist guerrillas persist in their violent ways. Despite all this, a new hope for peace seems to be rising. The Naxalites of Andhra Pradesh have long been on and off the peace rounds. It is good that they want Ms Goswami?s intervention in a new peace initiative. But they too must make some gestures in order to help the process. The most important of these is the declaration of a ceasefire. Guns must fall silent so that the two sides can talk and hear each other. The crucial thing is to create an atmosphere of mutual trust.

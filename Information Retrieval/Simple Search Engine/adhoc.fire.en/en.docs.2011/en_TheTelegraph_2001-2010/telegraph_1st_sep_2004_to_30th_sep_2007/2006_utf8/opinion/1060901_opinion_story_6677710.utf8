 SUCH A LONG JOURNEY

Sartha: The Caravan 

By S.L. Bhyrappa, 

Oxford, Rs 395

 The author, S.L. Bhyrappa, is a fabulist of considerable repute and his prose is often difficult to translate because it is so culture-specific. However, S. Ramaswamy, the translator, has done a wonderful job of bridging the cultural differences in the course of his translation.

 Bhyrappas book takes us back to a bygone era when India was going through a transition marked by intellectual conflicts and political upheaval. The word, sartha, literally means a trading caravan and in this book, Bhyrappa explores the Bhakti cult, emphasizing the gurus pre-eminence in mystical experiences that mingle with the transcendental in everyday life. Significantly, the book brings to life India in the eighth century, and Pradhan Gurudatta, in his introduction, says that the book is a historical novel par excellence. 

 King Amaruka Simha of Taravati sends his childhood companion, Pundit Nagabhatta, a Vedic scholar, on a mission to undertake a feasibility study for organizing a state-sponsored trading caravan. It seems that the king is keen on improving the kingdoms economy. Unaware of his friends ill-will, Nagabhatta joins a caravan led by two businessmen, Budhasreshti and Adityasreshti. It takes Nagabhatta more than four years to find out the secrets of caravans of other kingdoms. He then arrives at Mathura only to discover the kings betrayal, his wifes unchastity, and his mothers death.

 On his way to Mathura, Nagabhatta comes under the influence of numerous social and religious customs. During his journey, he discovers a country in which armies clash by day and night, hermits require harlots to perform yoni pooja and where trading caravans uphold the economy by manipulating the trade policies of kingdoms.

 A disillusioned and dejected Nagabhatta takes to acting and joins a group run by Vasudeva Sharma and Ananda Datta, and, in time, becomes a celebrity actor known as Krishnananda. His heroine, Chandrika, is a liberated woman with a past and her sacrifice, love and devotion for Krishnananda defy all conventions. 

 The episodes referring to yoni pooja, parakaya pravesha and other philosophical and tantrik feats are supported by appropriate Sanskrit quotations. Nagabhattas sojourn at Nalanda makes him try the Buddhist way of life. He gives up after the humiliation of Kumarila Bhatta, a great Vedic academic of his age, in the hands of university scholars. He leaves Nalanda to meet Kumarila Bhatta at Prayag to find solace.

 Nagabhatta atones for his sins and returns to Mahishmati, his gurukul, run by Mandana Mishra and Bharati Devi only to inform the couple about the self-immolation of Kumarila Bhatta, an elder brother of Bharati Devi. Here, at Mahishmati, the great debate between the Adi Shankaracharya and Mandana Mishra takes place even as Bharati Devi is bestowed with the responsibility of arbitration, thereby revealing the importance of women teachers in medieval India. Mishra loses the battle, becomes a disciple of Shankara, and leaves home for good.

 When Nagabhatta finds that he cannot save his guru, he leaves Mahishmati too. He is once again sent on a royal mission to prevent the onslaught of Muslim invaders. This time Nagabhatta fails in his mission and is imprisoned. Chandrika becomes a victim of the Nawabs lust. However, she saves Nagabhattas life by granting the Nawab his wish. They are thus spared and on their return, they realize that Chandrika is pregnant. Finally, Chandrika agrees to marry Nagabhatta and the latter experiences conjugal bliss.

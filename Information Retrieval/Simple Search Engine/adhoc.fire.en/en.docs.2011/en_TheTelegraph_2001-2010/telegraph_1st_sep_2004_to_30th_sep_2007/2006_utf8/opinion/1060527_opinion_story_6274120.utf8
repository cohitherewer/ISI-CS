 THE WAY OUT OF THE MIRE

 There is an urgent need to identify leaders who will take up the challenge of expanding capacity in higher education, writes Ashok Ganguly

 In need of redressal

 The solution to a difficulty lies within the difficulty itself.

 ? Niels Bohr 

 The past few days have not been happy for India. Though the two principal events ? the bear hammering of the Sensex and the seat reservation issue ? are not even remotely connected, the double whammy has dampened the euphoria surrounding economic growth and general well-being.

 Both the events are being constantly monitored, reported, debated and interpreted by the media so exhaustively that it would be surprising if any person living in India can pretend not to be thoroughly informed about them. There is also suddenly an explosion of ?experts? who are ready to offer advice, for or against reservation, and on the causes for the free fall in the stock market.

 In the midst of all the agitations for and against reservations by different sections of the student community, very little attention is being paid to the announcement by the government that Rs 10,000 crore will be made available for the expansion of physical, financial and human resources in order to raise the number of seats in all educational institutions receiving financial aid from the Centre. This is supposed to ensure that there is no shortage in the number of seats available for the general category of students, once 27 per cent reservation for other backward classes candidates comes into effect.

 The events connected with reservation of seats in institutes of higher education reminded me of the economic crisis that India faced in 1991 and the chain reaction of reforms that were triggered by it. The rest of what happened subsequently is now history and the fruits of it Indians will continue to enjoy through the 21st century.

 Although India could have done without the current reservations imbroglio, the issue has brought to the forefront the fact that the country already suffers from a huge capacity shortage in higher education. Although capacity shortage in higher education is a well-known fact, its debilitating effects remain unknown. As a nation, we could have done without the ongoing agitation by various student bodies across the country, but the issue has at least revealed the stark shortage of capacity in higher education. This shortage is perceived as a threat by those youngsters who face the world?s most stringent screening for access to higher education every year.

 I have not worked out either the sums or the statistics but, if a sum of Rs 10,000 crore raises the seat capacity in higher education significantly, it will provide India with a dramatic rise in the annual output of medical graduates, engineers, MBAs and post-graduates. It is well known that for India to reach and sustain 9-10 per cent annual GDP growth, the number of graduates who currently enter the marketplace annually is grossly inadequate. There are frequent debates on how to bridge the gap between supply and demand to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth. But these debates have remained inconclusive and ineffective.

 Now that a capacity building fund has been announced by the government, instead of trying to find ways and means to convert the promised funds into physical facilities and the required human resources, there are complaints regarding the difficulties and problems that the various institutions anticipate in expanding their capacity while maintaining the quality of teaching and research. The fact, however, remains that in addition to the Rs 10,000 crore, much more resources will be needed to build the required capacity in higher education. In order to meet the demand, there will be a role for the Indian private sector as well for foreign educational institutions of repute .

 Let me admit that we could have done without the present crisis over reservations. There was always the logical way forward to purposefully launch affirmative action for the sections in our society who face the hurdles while accessing higher education. It is now too late to go into the merits and demerits of how the herd mentality sometimes drives political decision-making in a democracy. Voices of logic, caution and reason are trampled upon and the nation is presented with a fait accompli. That is what exactly happened and triggered the current agitation by students. 

 Before the financial crisis of 1991, it was obvious that India was heading for seriously trouble. But it was the actual crisis which triggered reforms. The similarities between the crisis of 1991 and 2006 may appear to be somewhat far-fetched. Nevertheless, the former helped galvanize pending corrective measures. For example, the issue of affirmative action has been a matter of long-standing concern in the country, but it has been debated upon rather than being put into action. A well-known Central university has devised an imaginative and equitable process to determine criteria for measuring indices for family history and so on to identify eligibility for access. The process thus developed met the requirements of the genuinely needy and deprived. This excellent process could have been more widely used by other universities but they failed to do so. In India, it is in times of a crisis that we are forced into action; and this is done not always in a logical, inclusive and productive manner. But that may be the nature of the way in which we respond and this may have helped us to remain a cohesive country.

 There is very little that can be done regarding what has already happened. There are democratic ways to express approval or disagreement about important issues and that is what we are witnessing across the country. But the urgent need is to identify a group of independent institution builders and proven leaders who will take up the challenge of expanding the capacity of existing institutions, build new institutions, while protecting the quality of higher education in India. This mammoth task needs to be urgently undertaken so that no young Indian suffers a sense of exclusion or deprivation in the area of higher education.

 India aspires to be an important knowledge society in the next century. Access to higher education holds one of the keys to empowerment which will transform India into a nation of genuine equitable opportunity and socially inclusive growth and development.The human resources and leadership required to expand the capacity in higher education as envisaged by the government are mind-boggling. 

 The initial reactions from heads of existing institutions is therefore natural. We must now address the question as to how rapidly and imaginatively we can use the money to build physical infrastructure and develop the human resources required to meet the capacity constraints in higher education. This is a critical challenge for ushering in a new knowledge revolution in the country. Let us transform a crisis into a grand opportunity for the sake of the future generations of Indians.

 Letters to Editor

 Evil hour

 Sir ? The attack on the group of scientists in Bangalore, leading to the death of M.C. Puri, points to serious flaws in the administrative set-up (?Terror enters science heart?, Dec 29). It indicates a lackadaisical approach on the part of both the police and government, who do not seem to have learnt a lesson from countless terrorist strikes in the recent past. What is even more upsetting is the knowledge that the Karnataka police had prior warning of a possible attack on the centres of information technology and yet failed to take action. There was also a lapse on the part of the Indian Institute of Science as it made no arrangement to have police security on its campus where so many foreign and Indian delegates had assembled for the conference. 

 South India was earlier thought to be relatively safe, but the terrorist strike of December 28 has changed that perception. It is a reminder that no one is safe any longer.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? It is ironic that the victims of the terrorist attack at the IISc are scientists working on ?Operation research?, a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods in decision-making and makes careful predictions of outcome and risk assessment. There are OR organizations in America closely monitoring terrorist organizations with a view to predicting terrorist activities. 

 Today?s suicide-bombers cannot be beaten unless they are met on their own turf with more advanced technology and managerial effectiveness, which includes appropriate decision-making skills. Old fashioned police methods simply will not do. A large number of experts in OR are of Indian origin. The government in India would do well to utilize their services.

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

 Sir ? It is a harsh truth that despite the best efforts, terrorist strikes cannot be prevented, especially those perpetrated by fanatics like those in the Lashkar-e-Toiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami Bangladesh (?Another target?, Dec 30). Yet some amount of criticism is necessary, given that the security arrangements at the IISc were minimal. The attack was obviously well planned as attention on that day was focussed on Abu Salem, who had arrived in Bangalore that day. The government?s soft stand on terrorism ? highlighted by its revocation of the Prevention of Terrorism Act ? stemming from its preoccupation with winning votes, is encouraging terrorists and demoralizing the law-enforcing agencies. Intelligence agencies have the most difficult job in a country like India. But they cannot afford to be disconcerted as the price for this is too high.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The militant attack on IISc Bangalore was shocking, not only because of the way the operation was carried out, but also because it was directed at some of the leading scientists of the country. Such a heinous crime on the premises of an educational campus, speaks volumes about the desperation and ruthlessness of the criminals. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The IISc incident has stunned the student community. There have been instances of terrorist attacks on political leaders, religious places, even on the parliament. But this attack on a prestigious seat of learning leaves the academia with an immense sense of anger and loss. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The murder of a BPO employee followed by the terrorist strike at the IISc shows that all is not well with India?s ?Silicon Valley?. After all, if the state government attaches more importance to renaming Bangalore as Bengaluru, than to more pertinent issues, it is hardly surprising that it should be unable to tackle small-time criminals or trained terrorists. The seminar at the IISc was being attended by foreign delegates who will carry home the news of the laxity shown in providing adequate security on the campus, despite warnings. But then if a call centre employee living in the city does not feel safe, there is no reason visiting delegates should.

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanto Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was hardly prudent for the organizers of the seminar at the IISc to leave the security matter to private unarmed guards who could not even distinguish between fireworks and gunfire. Also, the terrorists had an easy escape since there was nobody to stop them. Scientists and IT professionals have become soft targets for terrorists. The authorities should wake up and provide them with proper security before all is lost.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Though Pakistani terrorist groups might have stormed the IISc, Naxalite involvement cannot be ruled out. The latter have a well-coordinated network spread from the Nepal border to the South. The Bangalore police has released the sketch of the youth involved in the attack. But much depends on whether eyewitnesses have had the opportunity to watch the criminal attentively and clearly. I wonder if eyewitnesses could provide sufficient details to the police, given that it was completely dark at the time of attack and the attacker was wearing a mask. Moreover, people were in a panic. Instead of providing a clue, this vague sketch can bring trouble to a number of innocent citizens who may be manhandled by overzealous citizens for the sake of rewards or publicity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? A free environment, undisturbed by political interference, is essential to carry out research. The liberal atmosphere at the IISc will remain shattered forever. To that extent the rationale behind the terror in the campus can be guessed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? The AK-47 rifles and grenades left by the terrorists at the IISc site point to the inexperience of the attackers. Had a more experienced terrorist been involved, the massacre could have been even more devastating. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bijit K. Sarkar, Calcutta

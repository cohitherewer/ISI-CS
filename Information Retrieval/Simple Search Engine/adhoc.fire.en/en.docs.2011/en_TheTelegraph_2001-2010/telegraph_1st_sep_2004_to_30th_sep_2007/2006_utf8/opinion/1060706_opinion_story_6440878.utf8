 DELICATE BARGAIN

 A way to cut quickly through the huge pile of cases in the Indian courts is always welcome. That was possibly the main impulse behind the passage of the provision for plea bargaining in the amendment to the code of criminal procedure. This form of pre-trial negotiation between the prosecution and the defence counsel is common in the United States of America. It saves time for the judge and the counsels, and also allows the accused the certainty of a light sentence against the uncertainties of a trial outcome, in which he may be proven innocent, but may equally be found guilty of the most serious charges. Instead, in a plea bargain, the accused pleads guilty or ?no contest? against a concession from the prosecution, which could be a lessening of the original charge or charges, dismissal of some of the charges, or, in the case of a sentence bargain as against charge bargain, limiting the sentence.

 The dangers of this provision in the Indian judicial system are obvious. Illiteracy, poverty and lack of exposure of the accused could easily distort the point of plea bargaining. Even the American system has its critics: plea bargaining is considered unconstitutional because it urges an individual to incriminate himself without claiming his right to a fair trial. It is convenient for all parties concerned, but not just. In India, the real danger is that it would be convenient for only some parties concerned. In the US, there are a series of safeguards in place too, and the Indian system would need equally stringent safeguards oriented towards its particular circumstances. The stark difference between the powerful and the powerless in this country should urge extreme caution. The accused must be assured access to defence counsel, who would help write out the application for plea bargaining, and the rule to ensure that the accused has voluntarily opted for plea bargaining must be rigorously implemented. A rejected application should not prejudice the judge against the accused at trial, so an independent judicial authority should examine all applications. Even then, since an undertrial prisoner may spend years in prison, the dangers of an innocent person pleading guilty when faced with the possibility of a long trial are very real. Cutting down on the pile of cases is welcome, only the method will need conscientious application.

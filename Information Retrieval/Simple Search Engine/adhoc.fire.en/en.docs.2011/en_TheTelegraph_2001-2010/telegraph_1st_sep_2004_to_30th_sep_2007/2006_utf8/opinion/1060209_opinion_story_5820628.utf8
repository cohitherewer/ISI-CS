 KEEP THE TRUST

 It may be premature to expect the guns to fall silent in Assam. But the second round of talks between New Delhi and the interlocutors of the United Liberation Front of Asom can justifiably be seen as a step forward. The Centre has made two important conciliatory gestures. For the first time, it has agreed to seriously consider the demand for the release of jailed leaders of the banned outfit. And, it has assured the Ulfa-appointed people?s consultative group that the cases of violations of human rights would be closely examined. Both these issues had been major hurdles in a dialogue with the rebels. More important, the talks this time seem to have succeeded in restoring the confidence of both sides in the peace process. For, before they moved any closer, there were signs that they were drifting apart. There were even complaints from the PCG that New Delhi was deliberately delaying the peace process. 

 However, the next big step has to be taken by the Ulfa. The progress of the talks will now depend on whether the rebels are prepared to reduce the scale of their violence. It is unrealistic at this stage to expect them to give up the guns. But if mistrust and mutual accusations clouded the scene recently, it was due to a spurt in the Ulfa?s violence. It is a familiar ploy of the rebels in the North-east ? the use of violence as a negotiating tool. The onus is now on the PCG to persuade the Ulfa that this ploy does not help the cause of peace. It is useless to cry foul over the army?s counter-insurgency operations. As long as the Ulfa continues with its violence and sabotage, the army and other forces have no choice but to act in order to uphold the rule of law. The PCG seems to have accepted that it is unrealistic to expect the army to suspend its operations as yet. It is for the peace process to create the right conditions for a ceasefire. As the Naga peace talks show, the real test lies in keeping the trust alive.

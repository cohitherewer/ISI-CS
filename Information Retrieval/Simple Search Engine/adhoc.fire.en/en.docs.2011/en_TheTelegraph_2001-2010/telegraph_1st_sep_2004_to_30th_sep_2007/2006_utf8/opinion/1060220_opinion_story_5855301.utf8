 Letters to Editor

 Arms and the men

 Sir ? The report, ?Query to army stirs row? (Feb 14), has not clarified as to why the United Progressive Alliance government intends to count the number of Muslims recruited in the army. Rajinder Sachar, a retired judge who heads the committee appointed by the prime minister?s office to take the count, has had secular credentials and should not have been a part of such a survey. If the committee has the sole task of collecting data, then why is the PMO distancing itself from the assessment? Did the opposition?s allegation that this is a ploy to introduce a quota system in the army intimidate it? The adverse reaction of the Indian army chief, Joginder Jaswant Singh, to the move, coupled with the PMO?s attitude, hints that this survey might have ominous consequences. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Fifty-eight years of independence have still failed to weed out the ills of the British system, as is evident from the recent furore over the composition of the Indian army (?Military list?, Feb 17). Even now, there seems to be a predominance of certain sections of the population in the Indian army and the near absence of another. If there is any flaw in the recruitment policy, it should be rectified, not covered up. As common citizens, we fail to understand how a fair representation will affect the army?s ?secular character?. According to the army establishment, recruitment is done from the ?recruitable male population?. Why are the minorities left out then?

 Yours faithfully,

Rinku Chowdhury, Burdwan

 Sir ? It was certainly not a wise move to assess the number of Muslims in the armed forces. The top brass has made it clear that recruitment is not made on the basis of a person?s community and there should be no change in that policy. Recruitment should always be on merit as a weak beneficiary will be the biggest loser when he has to face the rigours of army life. The armed forces cannot afford to have a quota for all the categories our politicians have divided the society into.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Is the UPA government playing a dangerous game in the guise of promoting ?minority welfare?? The denunciation of the Sachar committee would have been far more effective had the opposition criticized it when the committee was set up last year. But it chose to play safe then, lest it was accused of trivializing Muslim sentiments. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? In a welfare state, the government has the mandate to conduct any kind of census. But the act of singling out the army for a survey on a community-wise break-up, instead of doing the same for other government organizations, seems to be a bit too abrupt. The army chief?s stand that the defence forces serve the nation by virtue of a high degree of merit and professionalism reveals its commitment. And now politicians want jawans to lay down their lives on the basis of a quota.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 n Sir ? I wonder how the editorial, ?Military list?, could endorse the head count of Muslims in the Indian army. If the army is unaware of the minority statistics, it shows that it gives no importance to proportional representation and recruits purely on the basis of merit. Why are Muslims alone being treated as a minority and not Christians and Buddhists? If the doctrine of minority representation is accepted, we may even see this being followed in sports in the near future. Seen in a wider perspective, Bengalis are a minority in India, as are the people of other states. Real secularism lies in ignoring such barriers to build a homogeneous society.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I fully support the decision of the army not to divulge the religious composition of its forces. There is no reason why the percentage of Muslims or that of any other community in the army should match their percentage in the total population. The army often issues advertisements urging Indians to join the army without appealing to any particular community. Enough damage has already been done to national cohesion by sustaining the reservation policy beyond its logical aim. The nation needs to rectify its errors and regain its secular character. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arunkumar Raychaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The decision to determine the Muslim proportion in the army aims at destroying the spirit of the institution. The step also undermines the education and talent of Muslims. The quota system deprives deserving candidates of jobs, and this can lead to nationwide resentment. The quota system should be kept away from the army to retain its spirit of brotherhood.

 Yours faithfully,

Anirban Rudra, Calcutta.

 Sir ? The meagre representation of the minority community in the army hardly makes any difference to the physical and moral strength of the forces (?Army protects itself religiously?, Feb 16). Any assault by the political agents on the army is likely to put the nation?s security at stake. Besides, the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who hails from the minority community and is the supreme commander of the forces, brazenly upholds its true character. This is just another attempt by the prime minister to woo the minority community to bring more Muslim votes for his party.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? Are other communities living in paradise or are Muslims alone being denied the right to a dignified life? Why is the government so intent to take note of their numbers in the army? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

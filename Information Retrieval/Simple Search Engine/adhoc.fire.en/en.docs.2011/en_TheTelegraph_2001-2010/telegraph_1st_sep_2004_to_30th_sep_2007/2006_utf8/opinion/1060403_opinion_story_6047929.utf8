The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TWO JOURNEYS WITH FLAWED MAPS

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Hollow voice

 Two political mobilization strategies ? the announcement of the fifth rathyatra of L.K. Advani and the sudden resignation of Sonia Gandhi from parliament ? do not seem to have had the desired political effect. There is no upsurge of political support for either Advani or for Sonia. This has much to do with the way the perception of politics has changed.

 Today electoral politics has gone into the hands of parties which operate as firms. Trained managers whose primary concern is not public good but private profit run them. While some of the parties function like closely-held family firms, others operate with a closed internal labour market. A third category exists of small caste and community-based entities, servicing niche markets. They are run by a coterie of family members and long-term equity holders who have spent a sufficiently long time in a parent organization of the party or in its front organizations. Or they are run by the caste entrepreneur himself. They are undemocratic because they want predictability and control and they discourage meritocracy which challenges established hierarchies.

 Converting political opportunity into individual opportunism, these political firms place a premium on high corruption, low cunning and the ability of individuals to operate in a twilight zone between the legal and the illegal and between the moral and the immoral. They stand for nothing but for their continued survival. 

 It is no longer a secret that politics has become vacuous. The heroes of the new generation of Indians are not Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru or Sardar Patel. People value self-made individuals who have changed their lives and that of others by keeping out of politics. Parents hold up the examples of Narayana Murthy, Azim Premji and Nandan Nilekani to their children. One cannot imagine them today telling their children to emulate Amar Singh, Pramod Mahajan, Satish Sharma, Bal Thackeray or even Advani. They would not think of asking them to join the Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Shiv Sena or the Communist Party of India (Marxist).

 In some parts of rural and mofussil India, joining political parties or keeping them on one?s right side may still be a successful strategy for upward mobility. Criminals, goons on parole, hafta-collectors, tax evaders join them in large numbers because parties help them launder their image. It is because of this changed image of politics and politicians that Advani and Sonia sound so hollow today. People will refuse to rally behind an individual unless he also reflects their concerns. 

 Advani?s yatra is a desperate attempt at re-establishing and re-legitimizing himself as a leader. While it may not be clear as yet whether Rajnath Singh will be the next undisputed leader of the BJP, what is certain is that Advani is on the exit route. No amount of travelling around the country can change that. Can his journey really be about strengthening national security? Advani was the home minister for the better part of five years and did precious little about it. His tenure saw unprecedented terrorist attacks on parliament and the Akshardham temple. If, as the home minister, with all the levers of power at hand, he could do little to improve national security, why should one believe that travelling in an air-conditioned bus would achieve that goal now? If the yatra has been prompted by the terrorist attack in Varanasi, apparently carried out by Pakistanis, then it would make greater sense for Advani to undertake this journey of sensitization in Pakistan.

 The yatra is, therefore, seen for what it is ? an attempt to drum up support for himself by communalizing the situation in the country. While the cause of Advani is supreme, there is no peoples? issue involved. Perhaps this is why there has been no enthusiasm in the party to get him to travel through the election-going states.

 As for Sonia Gandhi, when she gave up the prime ministership, people applauded her. They saw in her someone who was different from the run-of-the mill politician. She seemed to prioritize service of the people over self-serving ambition. Today the situation is different. She has not denounced power. She has resigned from parliament in a pre-emptive manner. And while resigning, she underlined her desire to come back into parliament by saying ? ?I will fight. I will definitely fight.?

 Sonia Gandhi was not called upon to resign because of any grand public cause. She resigned because she apprehended, perhaps wrongly and prematurely, that she might be disqualified for holding an office of profit. The choice before her was to subject herself to the deliberative processes of Indian democracy or pre-empt them. She chose the latter option. In her speech in Rae Bareli after the event, she linked her resignation to being targeted by the opposition: ?Today they are out to blame Sonia Gandhi for everything under the sun ? even if there was thunder, rain or lightening ? none other than Sonia Gandhi is to blame. Today every stone is being thrown at me, every arrow shot at me and every bullet fired at me.? There is no public issue here. Sonia Gandhi herself has been converted into a cause.

 It is wrong to suggest that Sonia Gandhi has resigned because the government?s policies were being opposed or because she was spearheading a pro-poor economic strategy. This is not borne out by facts. Sonia Gandhi in the National Advisory Council was perhaps closer to the space where politics has moved. The NAC was a creative, if somewhat desperate, response to get the content of politics back into an increasingly defunct system. Sonia Gandhi and the NAC are being credited for pushing through the Employment Guarantee Act and the Right to Information Act. A host of other pro-people proposals are still on the NAC?s agenda.

 Politics has moved away from electoral processes. The best people-oriented ideas now come from the voluntary sector, from social workers, environmentalists, human rights activists and trade unionists. The primary credit for the Right to Information Act goes not to the Congress but to that doughty fighter, Aruna Roy of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathana, who is also a member of the NAC.

 The future leaders of India are likely to come not from the established political parties but from these sectors. If they do not, then we are in for very serious trouble. People, in desperation, will move towards extremism as they have done in the Naxalite affected states of the Union.

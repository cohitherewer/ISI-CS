 In the wrong hands

 Sir ? The AIFF?s decision to replace Syed Nayeemuddin with a foreign coach did not come as a surprise (?Nayeem: Even a murderer gets a fair trial? March 29). There was no evidence of planning on the part of the coach during the Asian cup qualifiers. The players too are not ashamed of their shoddy performance and the officials are busy passing the buck. The truth is that Indian footballers lack the fitness and technique to compete internationally. Nayeem should accept this and retired gracefully, instead of giving lame excuses for his poor showing.

 Yours faithfully,

 Kasturi Roy, Calcutta

 Easy way out

 Sir ? Obtaining a divorce has never been easier. The courts have now deemed that indifference, frigidity and abstinence from sex are good enough reasons to end a marriage (?Divorce is easy: just deny company?, March 22). The decision makes sense but how would the courts be sure that the charges levelled against a partner are genuine or not? 

 At a time when many men and women are indulging in extra marital affairs , one?s marital status is more of a burden than a blessing. Therefore, one cannot rule out the possibility of an unfaithful individual losing interest in his spouse and levelling fictitous charges to end the marriage. It is undeniable that our society is becoming morally lax with every passing day. Does this mean that the courts will accept adultery as a necessary evil in the near future? 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong 

 Sir ? One does not know how many men will benefit from the apex court?s recent observations on divorce. But what is apparent is that married women will surely benefit from the Supreme Court?s decision that denial of company is good enough to annul a marriage. Gone are the days when women, with little or no education, lived a hard and unhappy life within the confines of a joint family. Divorce was unthinkable in those days and the women did not seek legal advice on the matter. Women today are a more confident and independent lot, and, consequently, are less tolerant of their husbands. They often end up divorcing their men if they are not happy with them, forcing the courts to formulate new laws to keep the situation under control. The present decree will benefit disgruntled wives as it seems to have been made with an eye on them rather than their husbands. Perhaps, the honourable courts need to do something about the safeguard of poor men as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Diptimoy Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s decision to simplify divorce procedures makes a lot of sense. Divorce cases should be settled at the earliest as this would help both the man and the woman resume their normal lives as soon as possible.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Little braveheart 

 Sir ? There is a banyan tree in front of my house. It is about six or seven years old. It is a very shady and strong tree. One day, some men came and wanted to cut down the tree to construct a road. When I saw this, I objected. But they refused to listen and burst out laughing on seeing a little girl protesting. As they were about to strike the banyan tree with an axe, I ran towards it, and clasping it with both hands, asked them to cut me down instead. Then all my neighbours came out and ordered them to spare the banyan tree. They relented, and started constructing the road without harming the tree. In this way, I have saved the life of a precious tree. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Deepanyta Chatterjee, Howrah

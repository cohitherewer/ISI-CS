 To bring down a wall of lies

13 December: A reader (Penguin, Rs 200) is subtitled The Strange Case of The Attack On The Indian Parliament and carries an introduction by Arundhati Roy. It brings together fifteen essays written by academics, journalists, lawyers and writers which raise some important questions about the evidence that led to the capture and subsequent sentencing of those who were found guilty in the attack five years ago. The contributors, after a careful study of the available facts, point out that the proof presented by investigators would not stand up to a careful scrutiny, and that there is a clear case for an impartial inquiry. Nandita Haksar, one of the contributors and the lawyer defending Mohammad Afzal, also provides a chilling reminder of the brutal nature of state power by revealing that some of the accused were tortured to extract confessions. Even the media, Haksar points out, worked round the clock to develop a national consensus that bordered on mass hysteria. By Roys own admission, those who have woken up to the twisted truth have arrived late at the barricades. But, importantly, people have now begun to doubt the official version. And a Reader such as this will only help them ask the right questions over time.

 Chvez, Venezuela and the New Latin America (LeftWord and Ocean, Rs 95) by Aleida Guevara brings the Venezuelan president face to face with the daughter of Che Guevara, a visionary and a rebel, also from Latin America. In the course of an extended and exclusive interview,Chvez talks about some of the things that he holds dear to his heart his fiercely nationalist vision, the implications of the revolution in Bolivia and his dream of a unified Latin America. He also shares information about his early days spent inthe personal political formation, and the future of Ches legacy in the continent today. Chvez appears candid, even intimate, in some of the excerpts. Whether this has got to do with Aliedas distinguished lineage is something that remains unknown. Also included in the book as an appendix is another interview. This time, with Jorge Garca Carneiro who played a crucial role in defeating the coup in April 2002.

 The Puffin Quiz Book 3 (Puffin, Rs 150) by Srinjoy Chowdhury is the third book in a series, which would surely delight quiz aficionados in the school circuit. Some of the questions may even force professionals to put on their thinking caps. For example, not many would know what is common between Valashaka, Saibya, Meghapushpa and Sugriva. This book also includes actual questions from Puffin quiz contests that claim to stretch the boundaries of a students knowledge. 

Mercy in her eyes: The films of Mira Nair (Westland, Rs 295) by John Kenneth Muir examines the films made by the Indian-born director, Mira Nair, including Salaam Bombay and the yet-to-be-released, The Namesake. Nair has not only managed to create a niche for herself in an industry that is dominated by men, but she has also evolved a style of movie-making that is at once sensuous and humane. 

 The chapters in the book provide details of the cast and crew of of the films, and Muir, who is considered to be an authority in cinema, enriches his narration with interesting anecdotes. Kama Sutra, for instance, because of its racy content, was shot under the title, Tara and Maya, to keep the Indian moral police at bay.

 STAY HOME

 The path-breaking nuclear deal between India and the United States of America seems to be on the verge of being translated into reality. It is also becoming clear that this understanding on the nuclear issue could pave the way for a transformation of bilateral relations. It is now essential for the government led by Mr Manmohan Singh to build a domestic consensus in the country in favour of this historic agreement. The ?nuclear deal? has already been approved by the 50-member international relations committee of the House of Representatives, and the 18-member senate foreign relations committee. While the bill, rooted in the understanding reached between Mr Singh and Mr George W. Bush last July, will become law only once it is passed by a majority of the members of congress, the major hurdles seem to have been crossed. 

 The truly remarkable feature of the endorsement by the two committees was the nature of bipartisan support for India. The deal is no longer narrowly attached to the Bush administration, but is seen as part of a larger American reaching out to India. In essence, the deal would give India access to nuclear technology and nuclear fuel for its energy requirements in return for putting into place a plan to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities. If all goes as planned, the bill should be law by August. This would be followed by another bilateral agreement between India and the US that would operationalize the understanding. A presidential waiver given by congress would then allow American companies to trade with India in the nuclear area. The debate in the two houses of the US congress has clearly revealed that most American policy-makers see the nuclear partnership as part of a new initiative towards India. India?s growing economic and military might, its youthful skilled population, and its strong democratic and plural cultural values have created the basis for a new partnership with the US. The Americans are obviously viewing India as one of the pillars of stability in the emerging balance of power in the world, and as a potential counter-weight to China. 

 The nuclear deal must not be thus seen as a way of containing India?s nuclear programme, but as an American attempt to mainstream India. This is the first time, in recent history, that the Americans have created an exceptional law for a single country. While Mr Singh?s government may have authored this historic agreement, they have failed to reach out domestically and build a consensus on the issue at home. This is critical, since most of the controversy created within the country has been because of ignorance. It would be prudent for the prime minister and his advisers to address domestic concerns, most of which have little foundation, for the next few months.

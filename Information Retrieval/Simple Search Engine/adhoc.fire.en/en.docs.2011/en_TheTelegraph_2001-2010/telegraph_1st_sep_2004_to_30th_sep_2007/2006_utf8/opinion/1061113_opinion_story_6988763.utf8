The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOWHERE TO GO

 Those who fly into Calcutta are struck by a certain eerie quality of its outskirts by the wide and smooth highways uncluttered by traffic, which present such a contrast to the city, whose roads are cluttered to impassability. Visitors may be forgiven if they think that the government ensures perfect negative correlation between traffic density and road space. But this incongruity is not a monopoly of West Bengal. It is to be found in all cities where governments have laid out suburban development plans. The government creates inviting vistas for squeezed-in urban residents to move to, but they refuse to be tempted because their jobs, their schools, their near-and-dear ones are stuck in the innards of the city. 

 The solution to this problem is so simple that it would have struck any idiot if it had not been the government: that employers must be moved first. If the myriad wings of the government were to move, say, to Kalyani, is there any doubt that the hordes of bureaucrats would move too with their mothers-in-law, cows and street dogs? One cannot be entirely sure, for this is West Bengal, where a government job can be something of a sinecure; those who visit their offices only once a month to collect their salary would not mind travelling a bit further to collect them. Besides, their trade unions would argue, with justice, that they should be compensated for the move, and may win them enough money for them to commute every day from Calcutta. In which case they may make the trip every day, playing cards on the train and visiting their new offices just long enough for a cup of tea. 

 But the point remains, that people follow economic activity. For instance, the neighbouring government of Haryana took advantage of the vexatious zoning laws of Delhi to offer space to factories and offices. The roads from Delhi were soon filled with processions of commuters; before long, residential colonies came up in Gurgaon to shorten their trips to work. Today, Gurgaon employs nearly as many information-technology professionals and business processors as Bangalore. That strategy was tried by the West Bengal government as well, with some measure of success but nowhere near that of Haryana. Part of the reason is that Delhi was and is a richer city and offers a bigger target to draw away jobs and money from than Calcutta. But it is also the case that Gurgaon has attracted many foreign outsourcing companies, while Calcutta has not. And that has much to do with West Bengals notoriety for labour trouble. The reputation is based on a myth, for its IT industry has been entirely free of labour problems. But it may not be for long; if the Centre of Indian Trade Unions has its way, it will soon not be. If there were a prize for destroying jobs, CITU would win it hands down.

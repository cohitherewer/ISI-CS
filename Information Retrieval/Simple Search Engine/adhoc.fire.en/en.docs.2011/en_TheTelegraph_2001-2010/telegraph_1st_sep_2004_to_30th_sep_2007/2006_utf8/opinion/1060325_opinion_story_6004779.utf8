 Letters to Editor

 Out in the cold

 Sir ? The plight of Mira Moitra only serves to remind us of the penury and destitution that exists alongside our swanky malls, plush bungalows and flats that cost a fortune (?Unaccommodated?, March 11). Many people, especially the old, continue to live in abject poverty because of the government?s failure to provide social security for the aged and the poor. Unless something is done to change the present situation, many elderly people will share Moitra?s cruel fate. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Crime and the city

 Sir ? The murder of Dr Jayanta Ghosh was shocking (?First-time five held in doctor case by chance?, March 19). It is sad to see that the life of a doctor who selflessly served the poor for 34 years had no value for the criminals who decided to kill him for money. Significantly, the murderers come from poor families, and are victims of the unemployment problem plaguing the state. 

 The government doesn?t seem to realize that once an unemployed youth takes recourse to crime, it becomes impossible to bring him back on the right path. The early fears vanish after the first murder, and the lure of easy money prompts further crimes. It would be better to provide jobs to the unemployed to prevent them from turning to crime. 

 Ghosh?s murderers will now spend the better part of their lives behind bars, becoming a burden on the government which will have to cough up money to pay for their food, healthcare, and clothing. Hopefully, the strain on their meagre resources would make the administration provide vagrant youth with a steady income so that they are discouraged from carrying out further crimes .

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The police deserve praise for nabbing the culprits who murdered Jayanta Ghosh. Inspite of the many loopholes in the police department, the commitment of a few cops helped to solve the case. Unfortunately, our courts are notorious for delays; many murderers have escaped punishment for the want of evidence, especially when a case drags on for years. One hopes that the speedy arrest of the culprits in this case would serve as a deterrent to such heinous crimes in near future. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The cold-blooded killing of Jayanta Ghosh sheds light on the deteriorating law and order situation in Calcutta. If a generous man like Ghosh, who was also an expert medical practitioner, could be killed for money, one fears for the fate of ordinary Calcuttans.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The editorial ?Unsheltered? (March 20) talks about the sorry plight of poor, orphaned children, who are often befriended by vile men posing as do-gooders. The Mumbai sessions court that convicted Duncan Grant and Allan Waters for child abuse imposed a penalty of Rs 32 lakh to help rehabilitate the children. But one suspects that the money may be misused by the corrupt elements in the administration. 

 The Colaba orphanage case is only the tip of the iceberg. Many such crimes occur within the confines of a family as well. The judiciary can help pass strictures against paedophilia, but parents have to realize that every child is vulnerable to this kind of abuse and guard against it.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

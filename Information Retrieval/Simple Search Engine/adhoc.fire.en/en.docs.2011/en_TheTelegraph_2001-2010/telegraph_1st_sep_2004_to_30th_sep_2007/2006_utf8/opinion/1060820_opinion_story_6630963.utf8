Milking a tragedy 

Sir Annesha Chowdhurys article, Food for lurid 

thoughts (Aug 14), was timely and bold. Somebody had to do some plain speaking 

on the unfortunate deaths in Baghmundi. Sometimes, the tyranny of social opinion 

can be killing, and the moralists have no right to cook up spicy stories with 

the support of a hungry media. The media and people in general must realize how 

painful such incidents are for the families of the dead. Instead of looking for 

sordid details, they should do well not to sensationalize a tragedy. 

Yours faithfully, 

Deba Pratim Ghatak, Durgapur 

About turn 

Sir South Africas decision not to play in the tri-series 

in Sri Lanka has hurt the sentiments of cricket lovers the world over(SA sinks 

tri-series, Aug 17). Even though the Sri Lankan authorities assured the visitors 

of fool-proof security, the South Africans decided not to go ahead with the scheduled 

tour. By deciding to pack up and leave in a hurry, the South Africans have only 

boosted the morale of the terrorists who want to derail the peace process in the 

country. South Africas decision also speaks poorly of the unity in the international 

cricketing fraternity. Moreover, if the South African officials think that they 

would be safe outside Sri Lanka, then they are mistaken. In troubled times such 

as these, even Britain is now as dangerous as Sri Lanka. And if Britain can come 

under the shadow of terror, so can South Africa. The Proteas should remember that 

terror knows no boundaries and apologize. 

Yours faithfully,

Sir There is no need to criticize the South Africans 

for pulling out of the tournament in Sri Lanka. The Springboks had every right 

to cancel the tour after the recent bomb attack, which proved that the hosts had 

failed to provide adequate security measures for the visitors. In fact, what is 

more worrying is Indian cricket boards response to the crisis. Instead of asking 

the players to return, the board gave its nod to a three-match oneday series between 

Sri Lanka and India. This only goes to show that for the BCCI, the safety of the 

players is less important than the money it makes out of these fixtures. 

Yours faithfully, 

Amit Yadav, Durgapur

Sir That the cricket board of South Africa decided 

to call off their tour of Sri Lanka following an independent report by a Dubai-based 

security agency is rather amusing. All the more so because the agency had not 

even made an on-the-spot assessment of the ground reality in Colombo before preparing 

its report. Even the Sri Lankan boards offer to grant South Africans security 

normally reserved for a head of state did not seem to assure the players. If the 

Indian team has no problem in staying on in Sri Lanka, there is no reason why 

the South Africans cannot do the same. Maybe, they need to take a lesson from 

the Indians who often play matches in the face of numerous threats. 

Yours faithfully, 

Nirupam Banerjee, Calcutta

Sir The Indian board is hell-bent on exploiting 

the players without any considerations for their well-being. Worse, it seems that 

the board has very little idea about the weather conditions in Sri Lanka at this 

time of the year. How else can one explain the decision to allow the team to tour 

the country in the middle of the rainy season? The cancellation of the matches 

due to inclement weather is frustrating not only for the players but for the viewers 

as well. The board should consult the weather office before it decides to send 

a team to the island nation the next time around. 

Yours faithfully, 

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

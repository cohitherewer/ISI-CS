 DOUBLESPEAK

 It is possible to have one?s cake and eat it too provided one is the world?s solitary superpower. The United States of America is the most voluble advocate of free trade across the globe. But when it suits its own interests it can suddenly turn insular and protectionist. Witness the refusal of the US Congress to allow some US ports to be managed by a company based in Dubai and owned by the United Arab Emirates. Previously, these ports were managed by P amp;O, a British company. The US Congress had no problems with a British company running some of its ports but objections were raised when P amp;O was bought by Dubai Ports World, a company with an established track record as a ports operator with business interests spread across the world, including in the Western world. But the US is not willing to allow Dubai Ports World to operate in the US because its presence is a threat to national security. The allegation is absurd for a number of reasons. The company had got for itself the necessary clearance from the official committee that looks into the security angles of investments. Moroever, there are more US naval ships in Dubai and other ports of the UAE than anywhere else outside the US. It must be said to the credit of Mr George W. Bush that he opposed the decision of the Congress. There are only a few ways to explain this behaviour of the US Congress. One, that it is racist. Two, that it is suspicious of anything that has some kind of Islamic association. And three, it thrives on double standards. None of the three brings any credit to the US Congress.

 The charge of double standards can be levelled against other Western governments as well. These governments consistently hector India and other developing countries about allowing foreigners to own companies, including in areas that are normally labelled ?strategic??. But the same governments easily forget the same advice when it affects their own economic interests. Recently, the US stopped a Chinese company from buying Unocal. In Europe there was a furore when the London-based Indian steel magnate Mr L.N. Mittal made a bid to buy Arcelor. The West thus finds it convenient to be both pro-free market and pro-protectionism. It is also a fact that, despite postures to the contrary, governments in the West determine the nature of investments and ownership of assets. The world may not be flat after all.

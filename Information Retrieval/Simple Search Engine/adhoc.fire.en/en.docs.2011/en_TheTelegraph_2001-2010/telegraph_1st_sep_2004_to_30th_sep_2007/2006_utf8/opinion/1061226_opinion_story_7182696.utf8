 NOT A GIRL

 The irony of her mother a widowed farm hand in a Bengali village being called Unnati, or Progress, is perhaps the least brutal thing in the life of Tapati Biswas. The daughter, whose real name is not Tapati, is nineteen. She has studied up to class XII and now refuses to behave like a girl. She has cut her hair short, wears pants, hangs around in tea-stalls and speeds on her bicycle. Her best friend from school, Parvati, is now a housewife in another village. Tapati, when she insisted on visiting Parvati, first got beaten up by the latters husband and father-in-law, who then threatened Parvatis father, Mr Ramkrishna Maitra, with dire consequences if he did not manage to stop his daughters mannish friend from visiting her. Mr Maitra confronted Tapati, who was defiant about her transgressions. So he dragged her to the village square, and in front of the passive lookers-on, stripped Tapati, tonsured her, beat her up for two hours, and then photographed her naked to prove her girlhood. The police, the local party office and the panchayat could do nothing while all this was going on.

 Why was Tapati beaten up? Was it because the neighbours took her for a man when she kept visiting her married friend? Was it because she generally refused to behave like a girl even if she was known to be one? Were the men reacting to something more unspeakable: an intense, possibly ambiguous, friendship between two women? Or does the collective brutality confound all three responses to transgression and difference? Krishnagar and its villages form that grey zone between the rural and the suburban where other forms of gender-transgressive behaviour are not similarly brutalized. There are assigned and more-or-less tolerant spaces, however marginal and precarious, for hijras and kothis (effeminate homosexual men) for instance. It is only when women break the sex-laws that this collective violence versions of which also exist in the cities and towns is publicly unleashed.

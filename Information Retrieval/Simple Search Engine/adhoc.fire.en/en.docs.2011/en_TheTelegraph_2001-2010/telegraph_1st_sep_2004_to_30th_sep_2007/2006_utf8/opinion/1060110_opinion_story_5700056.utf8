The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RUINED GREEN

 Book fairs and political rallies are essential for the health of certain democracies. But respect for the law and for the environment is not. Such was the message implicit in the ravaging of the Maidan during the Left Front rally on Sunday. Calcutta?s legendary rallies, though a matter of great civic pride among the city?s keepers, have never been occasions for the display of civic restraint. They are usually occasions in which the unabashed disruption of civilized life becomes the highest expression of popular politics, with the flamboyant approval of the government. But the robustness of this politics reached new heights on Sunday when the Maidan was converted into a combination of rubbish heap, communal kitchen and public lavatory on a scale splendid enough to outdo most of the popular events taking place on it. Apart from the disorder and the inconvenience (Calcuttans being merrily immune to both), the irreparable damage done to the grounds remains an unforgivable act of state-endorsed vandalism. And the endorsement this time has been supposedly ?lawful?.

 The battle over the Maidan now has a long and shameful history. Flouting every principle of environmental and civic awareness, the wilful destruction of this bit of beleaguered green in the heart of the city has now been made ?official? by leading politicians in the state and Central governments. West Bengal?s chief minister, senior party leaders as well as the Central defence minister have all lent their public support to the abuse of the grounds, overturning the decisions made by other important institutions of state. The concern for environment (and aesthetics) shown over the years by the high court, and by the army, has been systematically overruled by what could only be described as the crudest exercise of political power, garbed in the rhetoric of democratic politics. The lamest of historical justifications has been proffered by the most eminent of the city?s keepers ? all in the name of the ?people? and their ?rights?. This has resulted alike in the undermining of law and order, the corruption of political rhetoric, the irreversible damaging of the city?s natural and cultural resources, and quite as irreversibly, the degradation of public and civilized values. What was done on, and to, the Maidan on Sunday is not simply a matter of poor lawn-keeping.

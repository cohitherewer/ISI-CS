 POLITICS BY NUMBERS

 Radhika Ramaseshan examines whether Kanshi Rams aspiration of revolutionizing caste politics would survive him 

 Beyond the grave

 One of the leitmotifs in Kanshi Rams pithy speeches was that politics was the means by which any obstacle can be overcome. Never an orator or a rabble-rouser, assertions such as this one from the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party was indeed the key to understanding his politics. Kanshi Ram did not conceptualize the BSP as a movement against the state for its failure to eradicate the caste system or improve the social and economic conditions of Dalits. Nor did he envisage it as a challenge to the upper castes and the entire system unlike the anti-caste movements in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra which sought to redefine the nature of imperialism essentially in social and economic terms.

 These movements worked from outside the periphery of mainstream politics and showed a disdain for electoral politics. For Kanshi Ram, the BSP was a state-based party which hoped to break the stranglehold of the Brahmanical elite on the state and leverage the numerical strength of Dalits in the power structures to their advantage. In other words, let Dalits lord over from the commanding heights of the system and everything else land reforms, equitable justice, economic parity and the rest could follow. His vision, if it can be called that, was encapsulated in the slogan, Jiske jitni sankhya bhaari, uski utni bhagayadari (Power will be re-distributed according to ones numerical strength).

 He often told his bahujan samaj audience, which comprised of the scheduled castes, the most backward castes and the Muslims, that there was no need for revolutions like those in France and Russia. All that was required of Dalits was to walk to the nearest polling booth and vote for the BSP candidate. In the late Eighties, this apparently simple postulation was virtually unrealizable in the area Kanshi Ram regarded as his karma bhoomi, Uttar Pradesh. He was a Dalit from Punjab. Although the Congresss uninterrupted hegemony was challenged by the rising clout of the intermediate and backward castes and their political patrons like Chaudhary Charan Singh, thanks largely to the spin-offs of the Green Revolution and a scrupulous enforcement of the land ceiling law in western UP, the churning did not impact Dalits.

 Charan Singhs political formulation, represented in his famous ajgar (Ahir-Jat-Gujjar-Rajput) axis, was all muscle. The traditional land-owning Rajputs subjugated the Dalits wherever they could and the parvenus, who benefited from the agrarian reforms, emulated them with double vigour. The result was that unless Dalits were protected by a party like the Congress, they had little or no hope of exercising their franchise. 

 Away from the villages but under Kanshi Rams ever-watchful gaze, something happened in urban UP. The number of lettered Dalits doubled from four per cent, between 1971 and 1981, to eight per cent, between 1981 and 1991 . Sudha Pais book, Dalit Assertion and the Unfinished Democratic Revolution, mentions UP as having the highest enrolment among SCs in private unaided schools in the entire country. These schools have been set up by the jatavs of Agra and Kanpur, dominating the leather trade, to ensure that their children obtain an education which will enable them to compete with the manuvadis in all spheres of life. 

 The BSPs roots lay in a lower middle-class trade union organization, called the Backward and Minority Classes Employment Federation, made up of bank, railway, public sector units and insurance employees. If the BAMCEF was one pillar of support to the BSP although it remained scrupulously non-political the other was the Dalit civil servant. The latter, primarily consisting of the jatavs and to an extent the passis both these sub-castes constituting the creamy layer of Dalits ensured that Dalits emerge as an effective counter-point to the two other caste-groups that controlled UPs administration, namely, the Brahmins and the Kayasthas.

 Most Dalit officials, regardless of what positions they held, routinely contributed a part of their monthly earnings to the BSP. In the far-flung districts, the senior officials, who were deployed during elections, brought a sense of fair play to the exercise. Dalits, who stayed indoors, were encouraged to travel fearlessly to the booths.

 While such changes did not translate into dramatic gains for the BSP, its voting percentage increased in every election since 1989. Enough for Mulayam Singh Yadav to knock on Kanshi Rams door to help him win his own seat in an assembly bypoll in 1991. The BSP chief agreed, provided Yadav did not set up a candidate against him in the Lok Sabha elections in which they had contested simultaneously. Their reciprocity worked and both won handsomely. Despite the backward caste Dalit contradictions on ground zero, the seed of the Kanshi Ram-Mulayam Singh alliance for the 1993 elections was sown.

 The BSP and the Samajwadi Party threw the Bharatiya Janata Party by the wayside in 1993 and in a sense, checked the rise of Hindutva for time to come. The alliance was extolled as a triumph of the subalterns over the right-wing elite. But perspicacious political observers spotted the signs of trouble at the start. For one, there was nothing subaltern about Yadav. He rarely disguised his contempt for the penurious bahujan samaj while in his inimitable fashion, Kanshi Ram made fun of Yadavs social affectations. For another, Kanshi Ram had made no bones of the fact that his ultimate goal was to grab the chief ministers post for himself or Mayavati. Political opportunism became the hallmark of the BSPs politics. The astute strategist that he was, Kanshi Ram successfully obliterated the difference between opportunism and empowerment. His logic was that the BJP was a good enough prop for a BSP-led government but it was a government on his terms and not the BJPs.

 However, the limits to what the BSP could do with its blueprint of Dalit empowerment also showed up in the three times that Mayavati ruled UP. It could not reach out to the underprivileged sub-castes, having no access to land or education. It had no agenda on land reforms. Its efforts to co-opt the non-Yadav backward castes and the most backward castes reinforced the differences they historically shared with the Dalits. 

 The faultlines became sharper when Kanshi Ram anointed Mayavati as his successor and withdrew from active politics owing to failing health. Some of his trusted lieutenants quit and floated their own parties or joined others. While the defections did not impact the BSPs core support base, it was obvious that Mayavati floundered for a strategy to expand the BSPs influence.

 By the time she allowed a Brahmin lawyer, Satish Mishra, to micro-manage its politics, Kanshi Ram was virtually comatose. Mishra claimed credit for weaning away the Brahmins from the BJP and Congress into the BSP. This strategy will be tested in the next assembly polls. But nobody knows what Kanshi Ram would have thought of it.

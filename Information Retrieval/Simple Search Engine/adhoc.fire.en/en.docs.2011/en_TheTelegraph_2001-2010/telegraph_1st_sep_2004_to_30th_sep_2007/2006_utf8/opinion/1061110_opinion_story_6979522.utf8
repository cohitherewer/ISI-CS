 HOUSE BOUND

 The government of Mr George W. Bush has been rendered lame by the victory of the Democratic Party in the House of Representatives. In the election to the Senate, the Democrats have a majority of one which suggests that the Republican Party is on a slippery slope. Add to these the fact that the Democrats have won many of the governors seats including the critical one of Ohio, which determined the fate of the previous two presidential elections. The almost unbridled power that Mr Bush had enjoyed over the last six years has now been broken with telling effect. The dominance that he enjoyed is shown by the fact that in the last six years he used the presidential veto only once. It will not be at all unjustified to read the election results as a definite swing towards the Democrats. The Republicans can only take the election results as an omen for what will happen when Mr Bush relinquishes office.

 The results are a clear condemnation of one of the most important decisions that Mr Bush has taken in the last six years. The electorate has decisively voted against the war in Iraq. The initial support to the invasion of Iraq has faded and its place has been taken by a recognition that the war has not gone well for the United States of America at all. Even Mr Bush had to accept publicly that his Iraq policy is not working well enough and fast enough. He had no qualms about accepting the resignation of his defence secretary, Mr Donald Rumsfeld, one of the masterminds of the Iraq invasion and a great war-monger. The big question in White House is what is to be done in Iraq. Nobody has an answer, but everyone knows that the present situation is a quicksand which will pull down the Republican plans to regain the presidentship two years from now. Every decision that the Bush administration will henceforth take will be subject to the approval of the Democrats. This will force Mr Bush to concentrate on domestic issues like social security on which the two parties do not see eye to eye.

 Mr Bushs debacle is not without implications for India since it has a direct bearing on the Indo-US nuclear deal. There is the fear that the Democrats, to spite the Republicans and for other important reasons, may not support the deal in its present form. They may reject it outright or introduce amendments that are unacceptable to India. For the government of India, what is critical is to ensure bipartisan support for the Indo-US nuclear deal. Both parties, the Republican and the Democratic, have to accept that a long-term relationship with India is necessary for US foreign policy. The nuclear deal is only a symbol of the new friendship that has emerged between the worlds most powerful and the worlds biggest democracies.

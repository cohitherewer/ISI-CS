 STRANGERS TALES

 - Jharkhand does not border Nepal

 More to it than upper-caste backlash

 In spite of the gods: the strange rise of modern india

 By Edward Luce, 

 Little, Brown, pound; 20

 Reading this engaging book brought to mind Graham Greenes comment that if he wanted to be understood or understand, he would have bamboozled himself into belief. But I am a reporter; God exists only for leader-writers. Greene went on to say in The Quiet American that the job of a reporter is to expose and record. That is what Edward Luce, a former Financial Times correspondent in India, does brilliantly. He is a keen observer, with an eye for things that matter, a penchant for description and the ability to see the funny side of mundane situations. It helped being a senior member of that privileged tribe led by Sir Mark Tully which has access to the movers and shakers of a land where, he candidly admits, people find it almost impossible to be reticent when talking to a foreign journalist. So anxious, indeed, are Indians to blab to Westerners that one warms to the three exceptions Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Amitabh Bachchan who gave him short shrift. 

 But Luce must also ask the right questions to get trenchant replies from a variety of people all over the country. Problems arise because he is not content with the reporters craft of exposing and recording what he sees. He must also pontificate like a leader-writer whose private God demands theories and verdicts. But while he might bamboozle himself into belief, he does not always succeed in bamboozling readers about the depth of his experience and ability to come to sound judgments. 

 There is a trace of a very young mans presumption about saying that the BJP should do this and that if it wishes to regain national office. Its equally simplistic to say that the BJP was propelled to national prominence by an upper-caste backlash against reservations. That was certainly a factor. But the reaction to Pakistan, Hindu feelings about Muslims, the itch for glory and what is called anti-incumbency sentiment all played their part. Even so, the voting pattern, both when the BJP won and when it lost, revealed no dramatic swings. 

 Luce often sounds like a hired consultant except that no one has hired him: In order to flourish again, the BJP and the RSS will need to take lessons from Indias modern breed of businessmen-gurus, whose marketing and public relations skills can reach people from many different backgrounds. I can just see L.K. Advani rushing off to enrol in Lalu Prasads new MBA class. Or enrolling for a crash course from Deepak Chopra.

 No one will disagree with Luces main points that the Indian state is overwhelming in its embrace of private lives, that Indians celebrate success too early, that nuclear bombs do not a superpower make, and that Indias economic take-off is neither automatic nor guaranteed. I particularly enjoyed his suggestion that successful Westernized urban Indians affect a longing for the simple soil, making the past seem the future. Also his dig at the long distance nationalism (quoting Benedict Anderson) of NRIs, especially in North America. His account of the Remove unemployment chant that greeted Manmohan Singh in Srinagar points to the economic bedrock of Kashmiri disaffection. He weaves many different people, anecdotes and sketches and many aspects of India into a single highly readable story. An array of statistics indicates painstaking research.

 But his judgment can be faulted. There can be no comparison between the relatively few British troops in pre-independence India and Indias heavy military presence in Kashmir because unlike Kashmir, British India faced no external threat. If New Delhi is touchy about status, it is because the Americans tried persistently to cut Indian delegates to bilateral talks down to size by pairing them with American officials who were their junior in rank. In echoing Stephen Cohens criticism on this, Luce may not know that before he became an academic, Cohen was part of the US official apparatus that indulged in these games.

 One wonders who exactly Luce has in mind when he says India wants to do something, India is loath to admit something else, or and here comes the didactic guru India should/needs to do various things. Perhaps this confusion arises because the book seems to target two audiences. The first half (or more) reads like an intelligent Westerners guide to India and is perfectly acceptable as such. But, then, the author switches round to lecturing Indians about what they want (or should want) and how they should set about gaining it.

 Much can be forgiven a chronicler who has earned high praise from Amartya Sen and William Dalrymple their flattering encomia appear on the jacket and who can take such an intimate view of India and Indians without letting the frailties that he describes candidly affect his overall judgment. All the more surprising therefore that he, a Financial Times reporter too, should trip up so often on facts.

 It may be a matter of opinion whether Jawaharlal Nehru prevailed on Lord Mountbatten to be Indias first governor-general or the other way round since Mountbatten was unable to conceal his chagrin when Mohammed Ali Jinnah denied him the same honour. But geography allows no opinion and Jharkhand does not border Nepal. Its the old Chota Nagpur. Mayawati was not Uttar Pradeshs first woman chief minister: that distinction belongs to Sucheta Kripalani. Indira Gandhi did not induct Rajiv Gandhi into her cabinet: he was in the AICC. Motilal Nehru was a pleader some say a muktear and not a barrister. Far from requesting the United Nations to mediate in Kashmir, India complained against aggression and sought an outright condemnation of the aggressor.

 The list can go on. Blemishes notwithstanding, I enjoyed reading In Spite of the Gods. But the blemishes ensure that the book should be classified as perceptive travelogue rather than serious commentary.

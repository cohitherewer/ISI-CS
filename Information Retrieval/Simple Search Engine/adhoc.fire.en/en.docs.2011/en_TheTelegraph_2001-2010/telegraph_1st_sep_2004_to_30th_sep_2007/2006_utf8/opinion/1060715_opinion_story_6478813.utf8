 ON CONTRADICTION

 Contradictions, according to the German philosopher, Hegel, lie at the heart of dialectics and therefore of the cognitive process. But contradictions can reduce a government to complete inactivity. Witness the plight of Mr Manmohan Singh. The most important contradiction that plagues Mr Singh is not the one with the left ? though that is also present. The most important one is with his own party. This is a contradiction that runs deep and is fundamental since it involves questions of policy and vision. Mr Singh is the pioneer of economic reforms. In fact, the success of liberalization and the consequent growth of the economy is Mr Singh?s most important achievement in his career as a politician. But Mr Singh?s problem is that his party is not completely behind him in the advocacy of economic reforms. The Congress, with its heavy baggage of populism and socialist rhetoric, has never been very comfortable with economic reforms. There have been bizarre attempts within the Congress to see economic reforms as the last stage of Nehruvianism. The party has always been hangdog about liberalization and privatization. The present Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, has never made herself clear on the issue of economic reforms. She is a reformist when she spends time with Mr Singh, and a populist when she talks to other Congressmen. Increasingly, it appears that she would like the Congress to be more populist and less reformist. This has cast its shadow on many of the initiatives proposed by Mr Singh and has made him appear faltering and, at times, even mindless.

 Another facet of this contradiction is that Mr Singh, as the head of the cabinet, is not free to choose and appoint his own ministers. Coalition partners decided who should represent the various parties as ministers. But the prime minister has no control over who should be ministers from within the Congress and what portfolios they should hold. Who will be ministers and what offices they will hold are decided by the party ? which means by the Congress president. This curbing of the prime minister?s independence and autonomy strikes at the very root of the cabinet system of government. It has become obvious over the last few months that Mr Singh cannot drop ministers from the cabinet according to his own choice. He has to seek clearance ? from the party president. The head of the government and the head of the party are linked by more than a dotted line, and very few have doubts about who is more important.

 Ms Gandhi, when she refused to become the prime minister of India, made a clear distinction between the head of the party and the head of the government. The distinction remains, but only just, because the prime minister is forced into a situation where he is constantly looking over his shoulder to seek Ms Gandhi?s nod. Such a contradiction cannot make for good governance nor can it add credibility and dignity to the prime ministerial office.

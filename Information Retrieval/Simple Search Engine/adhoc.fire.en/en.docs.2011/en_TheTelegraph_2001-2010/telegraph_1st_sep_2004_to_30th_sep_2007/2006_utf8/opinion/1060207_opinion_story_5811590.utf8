 BEGINNING OF AN AFFAIR

 The nuclear deal apart, in the coming weeks, India will have to decide on the nature of its relationship with the US ,writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Iran?s representative, Ali Asgar Soltanieh (right), with the IAEA chairman 

 Condoleezza Rice pulled a fast one over China and Russia in London last week to get them to vote against Iran and in favour of America when push came to shove at the International Atomic Energy Agency. And, in the bargain, she helped India resolve its domestic nuclear dilemma within seconds.

 So when the left protested against New Delhi?s pro-US and anti-Iranian vote on the weekend, that protest fizzled out even before it could take off. The political bloodletting prompted by the remark of the US ambassador to India, David Mulford ? that it would be ?devastating?? for the Indo-US relationship if New Delhi did not vote against Iran ? was over. The Ganga and the Potomac could flow silently once again. With a little bit of help from the Chinese and Russian skeletons Rice had been storing in her cupboard, the gods were pacified and all was right with the world once again.

 Following Mulford?s remarks, the national animus had been quite apparent in India. Some months ago, too, the US ambassador had spoken out about India?s particular lack of courage in inviting foreign direct investment, at which point the foreign secretary of India, Shyam Saran, had admonished him. This time Saran?s chiding took place unusually on the Republic Day holiday, indicating the depth of irritation with the ambassador?s serial undiplomatic offences. The truth is, in the divided Indian establishment, Mulford had made it much more difficult for the pro-US lobby to score over the naysayers.

 So when Rice the magician pulled off another of her tricks in London, half of South Block heaved a sigh of relief. With the Chinese voting in favour of America, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) was left looking a little silly. All the prime minister?s men in favour of a pro-US vote let it be known that if there was to be any ideological debate at all, it should be between India?s left parties and their comrades in Beijing (Moscow had done a double-take a long time ago). Look at the Chinese, they said, they had allowed Mammon to marry communism, and what a fertile union it was! World-class airports, the revolution in FDI that provided the money that paid for education and health, as well as potato chip factories and Adidas footwear.... All this while India?s trade unions paid lip-service to the workers? cause.

 In retrospect, calls by India?s ambassador to the US, Ronen Sen, (he had met the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, during a December visit as well) to the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, advising him that India should vote with the Americans on Iran despite Mulford, were not really necessary.

 With the Iran vote out of the way, India and the US are now gearing up for final talks to divide up India?s nuclear programme, that is the crucial ?separation? between those plants that will produce the nuclear fuel to make bombs and those that will produce nuclear energy. At the moment, New Delhi is believed to have offered a ?half-half? separation, that is, of the 18 plants in question (actually 22, but four are already under international safeguards), it has offered to declare half to the Americans and keep the other half.

 In response, the Americans are said to be wanting ?three-fourths? of India?s reactors on the public list. That is, at least 70-75 per cent of India?s nuclear reactors (13 or 14 out of 18) should be brought out. The US side has said that this is a number that will be credible enough to sell to the US Congress back home in order to enable it to pass the bill that will allow India to buy nuclear energy from the US.

 But the problem is that the department of atomic energy isn?t listening to either the ministry of external affairs or anyone else. Its argument is that if India gives up so many reactors to the Americans, it will not be able to maintain a credible nuclear arsenal. The US demand, the department argues, will compromise India?s nuclear sovereignty. So the big question hanging over India these days is how many bombs does India really need?

 Over the next ten days none other than the prime minister will have to stand up and make that big decision. Apart from the fate of nuclear reactors, what he will really be pondering ? with a little help from Sonia Gandhi ? is the strength of the relationship India wishes to have with the US.

 Perhaps Manmohan Singh should call all the previous prime ministers to tea at 7, Race Course Road, and ask them what they think. (After all, that was a criticism the young and inexperienced BJP never lived down after it went so dramatically nuclear in May 1998 ? that is, they could have easily pre-empted the domestic opposition by calling up all former prime ministers for a chat and ask for total secrecy from them.) The prime minister can explain that less is more ? Kalpakkam, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and Mysore Rare Earths; that better technology can be put to use to produce the same amount of bomb-making fuel that is produced by the many reactors in use today. 

 Then he can come to the point and tell his select audience that India was really on the brink of fulfilling what it had set out to do that hot May day at Pokhran eight years ago. Which is, get the world to acknowledge, implicitly at least, that India is a nuclear- weapons power.

 Clearly, there isn?t much time left, especially if both sides have to have a nuclear deal in place by the time George Bush arrives on March 1. The prime minister has already promised that he will take the ?separation list?? to parliament before it can be handed over to the Americans to be passed by the US Congress.

 The time is now. This week, India enters into one of its most interesting foreign policy phases yet. The hurly-burly apart, we will soon have to come to terms with the reality of our times. Should India play for all or nothing? Or should it take the middle path, remind itself that even the Chinese and the Russians have acknow- ledged the nature of America?s superpower (remember Iran?), and begin a beautiful, new relationship with the US? Compared to the thrust and parry of our times, those exciting days after Pokhran almost seem like child?s play.

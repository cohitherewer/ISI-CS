 Paperback Pickings

 Monsters in dark corners

 The 

 Way Home (Penguin, Rs 295), edited by Aruna 

 Chakravarti collects some ?contemporary Bengali short 

 fiction?. Readers may, however, be surprised to find Rajshekhar 

 Basu and Tarashankar Bandopadhyay in the same list as Suchitra 

 Bhattacharya. Chakravarti has several translations behind 

 her, so it is strange that neither the cover nor the title 

 page refer to her as the translator, but only as editor. 

 The translations are competent, although it would be too 

 much to expect the individual narrative styles of the masters 

 of Bengali fiction to come through in translation. Everyday 

 conversation is not Chakravarti?s forte, though: ?In which 

 direction is the station?? (Sunil Gangopadhyay?s ?The Fugitive 

 and the Stalkers?) would read so much better as ?Which way 

 is the station??

 The 

 Trouble with Islam Today (Vintage Canada, Rs 295), 

 by Irshad Manji could show the way to bloggers. A 

 self-proclaimed Muslim ?refusenik? ? she does not refuse 

 to be a Muslim, but ?to join an army of automatons in the 

 name of Allah? ? Manji has loads of questions to ask. ?How 

 many of us know the degree to which Islam is a ?gift of 

 the Jews??? ?Why can?t proper representation depend on shared 

 values rather than the superficial similarities of skin 

 colour for blacks, sexual orientation for gays, religion 

 for Muslims?? ?Is Israel truly the monster we make it out 

 to be?? For answers and more, one can either read the book, 

 or visit www.muslim-refusenik.com.

 Moin 

 and the Monster (Puffin, Rs 155), by Anushka 

 Ravishankar is not written by someone who also plays 

 the sitar (were you wondering what happened to the ?o? in 

 Anushka?). It is a delightful little tale featuring a rather 

 un-monsterly monster. He and his ilk are governed by Monster 

 Rules, of which the relevant ones are mentioned. Monster 

 Rule 42 says, ?When a monster is sent to the human world, 

 it has to hide under the bed. If there is no bed, it can 

 hide under a cupboard or any other suitable piece of furniture. 

 If there is no suitable piece of furniture, it should look 

 for a dark corner.?

 Classic 

 Sudoku (Orient, Rs 75) is a book to make a 

 beeline for if you are hooked to those ?infuriatingly challenging? 

 square. There are 101 puzzles to solve, graded through five 

 stages of difficulty. And yes, the solutions do come at 

 the end. Those not up to it might find it interesting that 

 though the name sudoku is of Japanese origin, the 

 game comes from Switzerland by way of America.

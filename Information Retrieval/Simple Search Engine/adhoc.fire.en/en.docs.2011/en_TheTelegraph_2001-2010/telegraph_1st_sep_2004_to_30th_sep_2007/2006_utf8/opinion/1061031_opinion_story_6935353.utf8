 Laws of the jungle

 Sir Forest babus build wall against science (Oct 27) reveals that a section of scientists is desperately trying to deflect attention from their high-cost failures. Surely all these failures cannot be attributed to the whims, if any, of forest department officials. On the contrary, Indian forests have always been exploited by everyone, whether by bird-watchers, or by wildlife experts, or hunters or timber merchants, either in the name of scientific research or for making easy money. Over the decades, Indian forests have been robbed of their treasures. There is now an urgent need to isolate and protect every aspect of the jungle. It is ironic that the help of forest authorities is sometimes solicited for research projects which are aborted midway. 

 Over the last several decades, Indian ecological research has thrived more on non-issues and hypes; this is expected, given the casualness in approach. Ecological and environmental research is there to help forest life flourish, not to endanger it.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir I have been reading G.S. Mudurs reports on scientific and ecological issues with interest so far. But his story on the hostility of forest babus towards scientific projects is a great disappointment. While writing about the impediments created by forest officers to research activities or scientific inquiries within protected areas meaning national parks, biosphere reserves and sanctuaries he has quoted a 14-member group of wildlife ecologists and biologists, a journal, a scientist from the Centre for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute for Science, Bangalore and unspecified research workers. The sources cited make it clear that their observations are mostly confined to Karnataka, save a single case from the North-east. But the report gives the impression that it provides a national picture. Mudur does not seem to have gone through the Wildlife (Protection ) Act or the rules under it. He has also carefully kept the accused officers under veil. And he has not cared to cross-question any forest officer of Karnataka or elsewhere. Section 12(b) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act deals with the grant of permit for scientific research, which can be issued by the chief wildlife warden of a state. Almost all the states of India have framed rules and guidelines to observe the provisions of the act. Anybody wanting to conduct serious studies on wildlife, including plants and eco-systems, should have a general dissertation on aims, objectives, means and timeframe while applying for such permits. For delay or rejection, most of the rules specify appellate authorities. It is beside the point that the Supreme Court has said that no one other than the forest and police officers on duty and the bona fide inhabitants having right of passage should be allowed in the forest. Today, with the Right to Information Act, of course, anybody can question a decision or seek information from the government. 

 A mention has been made of some scientists dropping a proposal to study wild herbivores in the North-east again no specifics are given. One has to remember that the North-east consists of seven states (eight, if Sikkim is included), and there are major areas, particularly in the forests, where insurgents prevail and outsiders are at risk. Is it strange for conditions to be imposed in such cases? G.S. Mudur needs to brush up his basics. 

 Yours faithfully,

D. Datta Roy, Bagdogra

 RCTC

 Sir I refer to a report in the racing columns of The Telegraph on Oct 30 (Senior steward resigns) that I have been under pressure to resign because of alleged financial irregularities in the Royal Calcutta Turf Club (for which the stewards have ordered a due diligence study by independent external auditors to examine the case).

 However, what has been left unsaid by your correspondent is the pressure of a growing lobby amongst certain club members demanding the outright sale of the Heritage premises of the Club at 11, Russell Street to developers, to which I have always been very strongly opposed, and which has generated its own pressures. Some very senior members amongst this lobby have even proposed that the sale proceeds be divided up amongst the members as dividends. This issue is likely to come up for discussion during the forthcoming annual general meeting of the Club on Nov 9, 2006.

 Since I do not wish to be associated with these proceedings in any manner, I have decided to resign from the Body of Stewards on the ostensible reason of a prolonged absence abroad from Calcutta from November onwards.

 Yours faithfully,

Shankar Roychowdhury,

 Former Senior Steward, RCTC, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Khushwant Singh gives an example of Mirza Ghalibs ready wit in his Oct 21 column. Here is another. An acquaintance, on spotting Ghalib drinking secretly in an inner room, told him that he had heard of Satan being locked in a kaal kotri(dungeon) during the month of Ramadan, enabling Muslims to lead a pious life. Ghalib retorted, This is that kaal kotri.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

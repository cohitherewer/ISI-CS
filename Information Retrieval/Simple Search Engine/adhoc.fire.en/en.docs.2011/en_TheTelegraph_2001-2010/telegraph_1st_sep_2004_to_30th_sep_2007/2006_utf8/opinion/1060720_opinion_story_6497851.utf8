 INTO SOMETHING RICH AND STRANGE

 How do women figure in the transformation of gold into a substance of material and symbolic value?

 How do we know that the creator of Sita was a man? The crux of The Ramayana?s plot turns on her greed for the golden deer. Ravana?s plot is the author?s plot, which ignores the fact that greed might seem strange in a princess who has willingly left the palace for the forest. But it may not be simple greed. The golden deer is mesmeric, beautiful, tantalizing, unattainable. Sita?s spellbound longing reflects men?s yearning for gold and the golden, projected as women?s limitless desire for the rich and the pretty. 

 It comes down to something very basic: a metal that shines yellow like the sun. Sol or the sun is one of its code names in the literature of alchemy. The desire to turn everything into gold springs as much from scientific inquisitiveness as an aspiration to possess the ever-elusive dream of unlimited wealth, power and the greatest beauty. For the Incas, gold was the ?sweat of the sun?, and gold covered the walls of their Temple of the Sun. The legendary gold of the Aztecs and Incas in Mexico and Peru was one of the reasons for the 16th century Spanish conquest of Central and South America. In the legend of El Dorado, the new ruler is anointed with gold dust in the coronation ceremony. 

 Throughout the ages, gold was the metal of gods and kings. There is a remarkable absence of women in its story. Palaces and places of worship are glorified by gold, whether it is the Golden Temple of Amritsar, in which the gold on the dome was donated by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, or the golden Gopal in the home. 

 Mined and worked upon by men, gold was used to create beauty, the richest artefacts as well as the finest jewellery. In India, gold ornaments were worn in Harappa and Mohenjodaro, and men wore them as well as women. Ancient civilizations ? Minoan, Egyptian, Assyrian, Etruscan ? all produced gold ornaments. But beauty went hand in hand with business, for this magic metal was loaded with values of purity and power. The earliest gold coins were minted by Lydia in Greece around 640 BC, and Indian gold coins go back 2,000 years. Alexander the Great is said to have looted the Persians of 22 metric tonnes of gold coins, much of which he used to pay his army, just as the Romans paid theirs. Dinars, mohurs, doubloons, guineas ? gold coinage is endless. Because of its rarity and durability, merchants came to select it as a common unit of account, through which evolved the international gold standard. The combination of beauty, density, divisibility and resistance to corrosion made it usable in a way that diamonds and platinum could never be.

 From the marketplace, court and battlefield to the realm of abstractions, a universe of experience bereft of women, gold symbolizes perfection. The gold medal is the winner?s prize, the ?golden mean? the way of balance and fairness, ?as good as gold? the best that can be imagined. In the cultures of the subcontinent, gold is special. At birth and after death, in betrothals and marriages, in gifts to the gods and to children, only gold will do. 

 However strained the circumstances, the father of an Indian girl struggles to gift a little gold on her marriage. As streedhan, it is the woman?s wealth ? for gold, unlike men, never betrays the owner; as dowry, it is a transaction between men. A man?s gift of gold can mean anything, from love to the price of sexual services, or a show of wealth and status.

 But is the woman always passive, an unwilling inhabitant of the golden cage? Gold, as the object of desire, makes the woman more desirable in turn, and the power-play is reversed. She allures, and is empowered sexually and materially. Gold, extracted with wile, received as gift or due, or simply bought, spells security for the woman in a gender-unequal world. And it is not as if she can be free of its symbolic magic. Even an underprivileged woman may long to acquire a bit of gold, a survival strategy in a culture that agrees to fetishize it. 

 Sita was just a symptom.

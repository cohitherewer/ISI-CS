The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FREE TO HATE

 The internet is a potentially lawless terrain. It could give human expression and communication an almost limitless freedom, while confronting the State with the limits to its control over that freedom. In this it is truly the organ of democracy, but to an extent that might often be difficult to accommodate within the actual democracies of the world. Hence Indias evident discomfort with some of the more unsavoury manifestations of the freedoms afforded by cyberspace. The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has asked the Maharashtra government to issue a notice to Google. This is in response to a public interest litigation filed against a popular social networking site, orkut.com, which has a page called We Hate India featuring abuses against the nation. There are many more such sites littering the internet which might be deemed abusive in the same way. Just after the recent Mumbai blasts, the government had tried to block 18 websites that hosted blogs allegedly spreading anti-national propaganda. But it proved technically impossible or prohibitively expensive to put down bloggers or limit access to their sites. And the governments knee-jerk will to control cyberspace also motivated a significant section of internet users to invoke the Right to Information Act and protest against the abuse of their fundamental rights. Even if the government did manage to block the Orkut pages for a while, it would be eventually possible to access them again through a number of other sites that are virtually impossible to block.

 Hence, countries like India and, to a much greater extent, China, will have to learn to let certain things be. There are certain forms of insecurity that control-prone governments will have to learn to live with, for the internet has its own life and networks of connectivity that are largely ungovernable. Besides, indulging these automatic tendencies to legislate and discipline would inevitably run up against ethical and legal human-rights issues that would be risky for modern democracies to create. Cyber technology and, with that, popular ideas of liberty and entitlement, have taken human communication beyond the vigilance of the State. The best way to ensure a more-or-less responsible use of these freedoms is for modern and mature nation-states to stop generating paranoia about them.

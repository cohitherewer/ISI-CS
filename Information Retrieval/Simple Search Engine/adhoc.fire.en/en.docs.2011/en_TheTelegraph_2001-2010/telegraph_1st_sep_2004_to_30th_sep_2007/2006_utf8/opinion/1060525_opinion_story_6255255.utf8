 Tumbling down

 Sir ? The impending collapse of the Second Vivekananda Bridge, as predicted by the German engineer, Jurgen H.H. Dorbecker, reflects poorly on Larsen and Toubro, the project contractor for the bridge (?Ticking-bomb tag on bridge?, May 21). This indifference of the company is criminal not only for the hazard it will pose to the public, but also because of the deaths it has already caused. Since the construction began in 2001, at least six labourers have been reported to have died but the incidents have been hushed up by the company to safeguard its reputation. 

 There is no doubt that the contractors are ready with excuses to explain the glaring structural deficiencies and the delay in the implementation of the project but all this will not be able to compensate for lives lost. Similar projects in other developing countries take off only after ensuring the safety of the workers. But in India, labourers? deaths in construction projects seem to have become a common occurrence. Only a few months ago, some workers from West Bengal died when a wall collapsed in a construction site in New Delhi. Those labourers were at least lucky in a way as the subsequent media attention forced the authorities to compensate the families of the deceased. But one suspects that families of the deceased will be denied any recompense in this case, as nothing had been done for those labourers who had died earlier while working on the bridge. The government should bring a law that will ensure the safety of workers working in construction projects all over the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Jurgen H.H. Dorbecker?s allegations of structural faults and poor engineering in the construction of the Second Vivekananda Bridge were substantiated by the collapse of a portion of the bridge on Friday. The accident makes it difficult to believe that the German was ?eased out? because he ?shirked responsibilities?. On the contrary, it seems that Dorbecker was forced to resign because his working standards did not match with those of L amp;T, the firm which has been entrusted with constructing the bridge. Indeed, Dorbecker has done his duty by revealing that the bridge will collapse in a few years because of the glaring defects in construction. If only L amp;T had paid heed to the German?s advice earlier, it could have prevented the deaths of the workers engaged in building the bridge. 

 However, now that the faults are there for all to see, the company should try and repair them .This might lead to a delay in construction but that should be borne with keeping in mind the safety of the passengers who will use the bridge once it is thrown open to the public. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The collapse of a portion of the Second Vivekananda Bridge has brought into light the way in which contractors risk the lives of thousands for the sake of earning profit. Even if one takes Dorbecker?s remarks against his former employers with a pinch of salt, the collapsed portion of the bridge is there for all to see as a proof of L amp;T?s neglect. The government should come forward to ensure that all such projects have an independent overseer and it should also punish the company at fault so that the safety of the public is not compromised in the future. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ?The cave-in of a portion of the Second Vivekananda Bridge is sufficient to run a chill down the spine of the people. Those in charge of building the structure should realize that there is little to gain by suppressing the faults of the bridge. This can only lead to a greater tragedy in the near future. Building a bridge with poor raw-material is a crime. The government should order an investigation to find out where all the money earmarked for the purpose is going.Turning a deaf ear to the problem now will only create the grounds for a huge loss of lives in days to come.

 Yours faithfully,

 All in the name

 nSir ? The expectations surrounding Feroze Varun Gandhi only indicates the Bharatiya Janata Party?s ideological insolvency (?Varun? Feroze is fine?, May 20). The popularity of the BJP is on the wane, but its leaders believe that the surname ?Gandhi? will turn the fortunes in their favour. What they do not realize is that the people are more likely to turn against them once they see through the party?s double standards. Playing up Feroze Gandhi as the party?s trump card against the Congress when the BJP itself had come to power by riding on the anti-dynasty wave is worth a hearty laugh. 

Yours faithfully, 

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ONCE AND FOR ALL

 In certain situations, there should not be more than one definition of civilized behaviour. This is the Supreme Court?s firm opinion, expressed as a directive to the state government of Orissa. The court has asked the state government to provide police protection to a couple, Ms Najma Bibi and Mr Sheikh Seru. In 2003, Mr Seru had given his wife the triple talaq in an inebriated state. He repented soon afterwards, and husband and wife chose to live together again. However, the local religious leaders in Bhadrak, Orissa, would not let the couple live together since they were now technically divorced. Ms Bibi can remarry and live with Mr Seru only after she has married another man, consummated this marriage, and then divorced her new husband. A similar fate has befallen another couple in Jalpaiguri, West Bengal. The husband had pronounced talaq in a similarly inebriated condition. He too repented and the couple started living together again, to be ostracized by their community. Although conservative clerics from the Jamiat-e-Ulema have objected to the Supreme Court?s directive to the Orissa government, Lucknow?s Firangi Mahal and the All India Muslim Personal Law Board have said, about the Jalpaiguri case, that a drunken talaq does not count as one according to Muslim law.

 The AIMPLB?s comment is interesting here in the light of the model nikaahnama or marriage contract, which was accepted by the board last year. One of the features of this model contract was the outlawing of the unilateral verbal tripletalaq, and the compulsory mediation of all divorces by a qazi. The Supreme Court?s directive addresses another kind of mediation by elders and clerics that results in an extreme form of legalism leading to what can only be described as serious human rights violations. ?Personal? law gets interpreted and enforced in ways that become inimical to private freedoms. In all these cases, the wishes of adult couples in dealing with their conjugal lives were overridden by conservative community elders. There has been a drive towards reforms in personal law, especially with a view to gender justice, that seeks to redress precisely such acts of conservative authoritarianism. The court?s directive endorses this, as do reformist organizations within the community.

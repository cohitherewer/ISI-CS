The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOSS OF A DECENT LIFE MALVIKA SINGH

 The Jessica Lal murder only goes to show how ethics, integrity and civility had broken down in this capital city years ago. It is nothing new for citizens who have had to live without dignity for decades in an environment where the police protects criminality and exposes innocents to social brutalities. In the old days, one could go up to a cop or a police station and feel protected. Today one shudders to even encounter a cop.

 Decent living has disappeared as governance has reduced itself to a mirage. Government officers become vindictive if issues are raised for debate in the public domain that question their irregular actions. Democratic norms are abused and veiled threats are meted out regularly. Those in power turn their heads away when confronted with this. They have learned how to manipulate officers of all colours to do their bidding. Increasingly, the mandate of governance seems to be structured for the rulers and their administrators, not for the citizenry.

 The feudals, when they ruled India, were far more compassionate towards their subjects than our present rulers, which is why the erstwhile royals, who were born to rule and were not elected, continue to attract the respect of their people despite the fact they have no ?power?. This is the finest example of the manner in which modern and free India has handled its citizens. Exploitation, extortion, corruption and other horrors have reached unimaginable proportions. It is embarrassing to be dictated to and manipulated by an administration that is neither intellectually sound nor committed to enhancing the strengths of the country through democratic means. Overwhelmed by greed, these administrators of our polity are destroying the fabric of India and Bharat.

 Political myopia

 The first worthwhile point on any agenda is the need for a radical correction of the laws that govern this land and a re-education of those men and women who administer them, forcing ?accountability? as the prime requirement. Some remarkable ideas and initiatives have been deliberately diluted by the malfunctioning of the ?steel frame?. Zero accountability has led to corruption everywhere. It has spread and taken root in endless avatars much like unattended weeds that kill all other life. The political class is wholly responsible for this corrosion and for the rapid deterioration of this ancient civilization. Lazy, selfish intellects have dominated the realm of government.

 On February 28, P. Chidambaram presented his budget to the parliament. Thankfully, it was not replete with policy changes and was, for the first time, a ?budget?. This is a sign of growing up, of emerging out of the hype of economic rhetoric at budget time. Three cheers. But budgets have been cut in the area of culture, a soft target. This single move shows up the limited intelligence of this government. These cuts are symbolic of the inability of the present leadership to absorb the many aspects of human life required for a progressive civil society. With a political economist at the helm of policy and governance, all initiatives appear ?one track?, looking within the obvious box. The challenge of making the human wealth of this country, as well as its philosophies and identities, an intrinsic part of economic resurgence is what will eventually determine true change and stable growth. The present attitude will have socially detrimental repercussions for the future of this nation. As the economy booms and the root of this civilization is neglected and forced to become a stunted ?pretty? bonsai, anarchy will destabilize India. That changing reality on the ground will stall economic growth. Our leaders do not seem to comprehend the urgency for a cultural renaissance. Sadly, they are mere economists, not political visionaries.

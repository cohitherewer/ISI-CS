 VERY TAXING

 There is beauty in simplicity. Aesthetics apart, in everyday life simple things make life easy and convenient. This is why the proposal of the income tax department that henceforward income tax returns will have to be filed in a form that is four-page long has filled most people with dread. The existing form is a single page and is called Saral or simple. The new form will not only be four pages long but will also ask tax-payers to provide information about investments made, expenses incurred, loans secured and even gifts received. The assessees will also be asked to provide the opening and closing balances of their bank accounts. The new proposals will make the filing of income tax returns more complicated and difficult. In this sense, the new form is a retrograde step from the existing one. The finance ministry seems to be oblivious of the enormous trouble most tax-payers go through to file their returns. Most, if not all of them, have to seek professional help. This, despite a one-page form. The trouble will only increase with the introduction of a form that is four pages long. It will only serve to increase the power of the bureaucracy.

 For once, the Congress cannot be faulted for objecting to the new proposal emanating from the finance ministry. Congressmen have correctly pointed out that the new form will add to the hassles the tax-payer has to undergo when filing his returns. The finance ministry?s assertion that ?normal people with normal returns? will find the new form ?better and simpler? is risible because it is impossible to define who is a ?normal? person and what makes for ?normal? returns. The income tax department?s definition of normal may not have much relevance in real life where the term normal is somewhat indefinable and therefore always contested. It is difficult to comprehend how a form that demands to know household expenses can be a simple one. The new form will not only make the tax-payer?s life more difficult, it will also increase the workload and the paper-work of the tax officials. The Congress should indeed be thanked for voicing concerns that are shared by tax-payers and the professionals who help assessees to submit their returns. There is a reluctance among Indians to make life simple and straightforward. This is manifest in the scriptures that govern religious rituals, and now, if the new form is pushed through, in the procedure involved in filing tax returns.

 THE CUP OF JOY

 Neha Sahay

 Eleven Chinese died from heart attacks and cerebral haemorrhage while watching the Fifa World Cup, one of them after the opening match itself. He had been drinking all evening, and finally collapsed two hours after the match. But neither his tragic example nor doctors? warnings helped: hospitals reported a spurt in serious hangovers as well as cases of facial paralysis as fans stayed up all night drinking while watching the matches, which began late night or early morning.

 Companies such as China Mobile offered free tickets to their subscribers, which not only entitled you to watch the match on big screens set up at street side bars, but also to three bottles of free beer. Restaurants too offered beer at discounts, and stayed open all night whenever an important match was on.The warm weather in south China proved a godsend for open-air bars, except on the crucial final two days, when rains drove most viewers indoors, though a good number watched under umbrellas.

 For well-heeled expats, however, the weather was no problem. Their hangout was most often some international five-star hotel. Watching the game with people whose countries were actually playing made even non-football fans share the enthusiasm. Expats set up blogs on their websites to predict the final winner, with some way-off results. Given the snide comments passed in private by old European rivals, there was surprisingly little rancour displayed on the blogs. As in India, China wasn?t part of this year?s game (it had, however, played in the 2002 World Cup) but the fever was all-pervasive, even more than in India. People took leave to watch the matches; a few even left their jobs. Some people took leave after the World Cup, exhausted after a month of double shifts.

 Big business

 As for all international events, for the World Cup too, China was a haven for mementos. One expat who had just returned from Germany, reported searching high and low for World Cup T-shirts for his teenaged son. After much traipsing up and down, he finally got the official World Cup T-Shirt for a whopping 65 euros.

 But in China?s sports shops, jerseys of all the World Cup teams, as well as those with players? names, were available for just 25-30 yuan. Key chains with club logos, pens, holders, socks, clocks, mobile phone covers, and wristbands were there of course, but so were football shaped MP3 players and loudspeakers. And to beat them all, even pet clothing in team colours.

 Indeed, the World Cup translated into good business in every way, as it did all over the world. Supermarkets offered discounts while you shopped in a football ambience, with giant portraits of football stars mounted all over, and television screens telecasting goal after goal; salons advertised football haircuts, and restaurants came up with dishes looking like football fields.

 TV dealers offered free ?bedroom TV sets? with every large flat-panel TV set; others offered lucky draws for World Cup tickets. However, trust the Chinese to take this commercial opportunity to an extreme. Special ?World Cup? wedding outfits were designed, with footballs printed on the bride?s white gown, and the groom?s outfit being a football jersey and shorts. Models actually displayed these creations, walking down streets with footballs in their hands, their cheeks streaked with colours of different teams. 

 Another enterprising Chinese tried to sell ?World Cup Air?, claiming that he had packed air in plastic bags from World Cup venues while the workers were cutting the grass before the matches. Li Jie tried to sell them for 50 yuan a bag. Alas, at least four of the 25 bags of imported air suffered air leaks. Next year, China will host the Women?s World Cup. The advertising possibilities are mind-boggling.

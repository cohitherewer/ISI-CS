 MANY VOICES

 Irrespective of the results, the vote in Bengal has been a major triumph of the Election Commission. In ensuring a free and fair poll, the EC has greatly enhanced the people?s faith in the democratic process. If the EC had taken some extraordinary steps for Bengal this time, these only helped clear doubts in some quarters about the fairness of the polls during the left?s long reign. It was shocking, therefore, that some leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had sought to paint the EC in black. The worst of the offenders has been Mr Subhas Chakraborty, who has earned a reputation of being his party?s loose cannon. His latest remark that he ?hates? the EC for ?insulting the people of Bengal? shows him in a particularly poor light. He had earlier been reprimanded by the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, and also by Mr Jyoti Basu for railing against the EC. But the CPI(M) seems to be speaking in many voices as far as the EC is concerned. The manner in which Mr Chakraborty?s indiscretions have been defended by the new party secretary, Mr Biman Bose, is evidence of this doublespeak. Even if this is part of the party?s strategy to bolster the cadre?s fighting spirit, it is a poor one that only reflects the CPI(M)?s unease with the new rules of the game. Worse, it is an ominous reminder of the politicians? ploys to bend an institution in order to serve their own agenda.

 True, the polls in Bengal have shown how much farther the EC has to travel in order to improve electoral democracy. Despite all its efforts, thousands of genuine voters have been deprived of their right to vote. Some of the EC?s observers for the polls did not quite play by the book. It must be noted, however, that the EC acted promptly to remove erring officials from the scene. There is a strong case for the EC to closely examine the reasons for some of its lapses, especially those relating to the large-scale deletion of names of genuine voters. It may also be necessary to take a holistic look at some aspects of the EC?s functioning. But such an exercise should not be motivated by a desire to score political points. The idea should be to find ways to farther improve the electoral system. Parties and politicians are expected to help the EC, and not hinder it, in such an exercise. The CPI(M) leaders? EC-baiting is worse than bad politics. It is ominous for democracy.

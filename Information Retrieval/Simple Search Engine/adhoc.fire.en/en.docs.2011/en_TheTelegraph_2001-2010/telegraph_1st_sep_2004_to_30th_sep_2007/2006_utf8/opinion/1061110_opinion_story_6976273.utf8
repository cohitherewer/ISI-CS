 From the mouth of old crones

THE CONCISE OXFORD HISTORY OF INDIAN BUSINESS (Oxford, Rs 275) by Dwijendra Tripathi and Jyoti Jumani is a shortened version of the original complete Oxford History of Indian Business for the benefit of the non-specialist reader. Written agreeably, it begins with a survey of trade and commerce at the turn of 18th century Mughal India. The first ten chapters cover the period between 18th century and the independence. Hence greater attention has been devoted to the post-1947 phase. A new chapter on the aftermath of liberalization affirms the topicality of this book.

 TWO MIRRORS AT THE ASHRAM (Penguin, Rs 250) by Shiv K. Kumar tells the story of a novelist whose life revolves around women and wine, until he discovers the spiritual in a secluded ashram in Mullagarhi. His meeting with the mystical Swami turns him from a hard-drinking womanizer into a traveller on the road to self-discovery, a road which stretches quite long from the self to London and Chicago. A dramatic conversion, indeed, for a man who realizes, looking at the tonsured head of a brahmacharini, how much sex there is in a womans hair!

 REFLECTED IN WATER: WRITINGS ON GOA (Penguin, Rs 395) edited by Jerry Pinto gathers together quirky little pieces historical, autobiographical, anecdotal on Goa. It begins with a Konkani song with a chorus: Ge ge ge ge ge/ Ge ga saiba/ Maka naka go/ Maka naka go. The range of contributors, and thus of the contributions, is eccentric. There is William Dalrymple rediscovering the vestiges of one of the greatest cities of the Renaissance world through his conversation with the ancient Donna Georgina, resident of Lutolim, a small Goan village. Then there are extracts from the writings of the 16th-century voyager, John Huyghen van Linschoten, and the 19th-century orientalist, Richard Burton. There is a story, written as a comic strip, Three Goan Death Stories, told by an old crone, in which an old woman is sent to the grave, as she lived with a wink on her face. 

 BOUGAINVILLEA HOUSE (Penguin, Rs 250) by Kalpana Swaminathan described as thrilling to the psychological core, is a patchwork of letters, e-mails, monologues, rants, narrative and diary. Clarice Aranxa, who comes to Baga in Goa to die peacefully, finds herself embroiled in a series of bizarre adventures.

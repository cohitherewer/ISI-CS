 On the prowl

 Bangladesh: Treading the Taliban Trail Edited by Jaideep Saikia, Vision, Rs 495 

 The world had not taken much notice of Bangladesh since the birth of the new nation in 1971. It remained one of the poorest countries that survived on aid from donors and had no political or strategic importance to attract the international communitys attention. The only exception was India which complained of illegal migration from the eastern neighbour, its patronage of militants from Indias North-east and, in recent years, of the rise of Islamist fundamentalism there. 

 As America launched its war on terror in Afghanistan, it also discovered a new hub of Islamist militancy in Bangladesh. Yet, the danger could not have been entirely unknown to America. Joseph Bodanskys biography of Osama bin Laden, published within a year of 9/11, records that Fazlul Rahman, the founder of Harkat ul-Jihad-al-Islami, Bangladeshs first major terrorist group, was one of the five signatories to bin Ladens 1998 fatwa against jews and crusaders. And Bodansky was once a director of the US Congresss counter-terrorism cell. The world has since seen Bangladesh as a cocoon of terror and as the next Afghanistan.

 The essays in this volume chronicle Bangladeshs dangerous decline from a moderate Islamic country with a fledgling democracy to a failed state. In its anxiety to save Bangladesh from falling further into the hands of militant Islamists, America now pays a lot more attention to the country. The essays by Bertil Lintner, a well-known journalist, Matthew Aaron Rosenstein, an American academic, and Bibhuti Bhusan Nandy, a former Indian intelligence official, trace the rise of Islamist fundamentalism in the country and the role of the army and the political parties in it. 

 But Islamist zealots and terrorists present only one face of the failure of the state in Bangladesh. The attacks on politicians, intellectuals, journalists, cultural and NGO activists or organizations with secular-democratic credentials expose the danger that Bangladeshi politics and society now face. 

 Salam Azads essay points to another facet of the disastrous decline the persecution of Hindu and Buddhist minorities. It is no secret that the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its Islamist allies are often hand-in-glove with those who kill people from the minority communities, loot their property and rape their women. Apart from religious bigotry, the persecution of the minorities is also political because the overwhelming majority of them are known to be supporters of the Awami League. 

 Several other essays deal with the challenges that the failed state poses to India. Subir Bhaumiks essay shows how Dhakas support to the insurgents from Indias northeastern states is a continuation of the policy pursued by Pakistan since the Sixties. 

 But there is another side to todays Bangladesh that is completely missing from the book. There is nothing in it to capture the brave fight against the Islamists by political and social groups, the mainstream media and even large sections of the ordinary people.

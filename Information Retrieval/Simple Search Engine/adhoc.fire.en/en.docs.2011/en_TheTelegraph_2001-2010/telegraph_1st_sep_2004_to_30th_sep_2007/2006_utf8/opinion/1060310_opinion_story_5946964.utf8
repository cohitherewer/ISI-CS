 CLARITY AND CONTROL

 Woolf: intimately impersonal

 Let me finish. By Udo Grashoff, 

 Headline, ?12.99

 To come to the deeply uncomfortable ? and often taboo ? subject of suicide as a researcher in the subject of contemporary history has, perhaps, more advantages than disadvantages. Looking for a rarely researched topic with an ?existential? dimension, Udo Grashoff chose to examine the way suicide was dealt with in former East Germany. The 45 suicide letters that make up Let Me Finish. were picked out of the most striking notes he found in the archives.

 Only a small percentage of people who kill themselves are mentally ill, Grashoff concludes. A human being?s most extreme decision cannot just be explained away. On the contrary, for some it is an option, like the pensioner who wrote: ?I had no influence on the beginning of my life, but I am going to have an influence on its end.? This was, for her, actually a moment of clarity, for she had been haunted by persecution fantasies with which she constantly harried the police. Grashoff?s impersonal position allows him to display, within a short space, a variety of motives. He does it without judging, and with full acknowledgment that even in the final moments, people about to commit the most intimate of personal acts are often unable to express the ?truth? when they want to, and sometimes unwilling to do anything more than apologize. Yet, for many who write a final note, rationalizing something that the world sees as irrational is important; they seek to formulate a reason even if they cannot pin it down. 

 Revenge and despair are the commonest spurs in the letters, often addressed to a partner by whom the writer feels abandoned. But there the violence is not solely self-directed, it is directed at the ?accused? as well. A woman writes to her rival: ?You are to blame for what I?m doing. I hope your marriage to my husband produces at least five children.? But more common is a desire for harmony. ?If you can,? writes a husband, ?then forget the bad times with me.? A girl wishes to be gentle to her parents: ?It?s not right for you to know that I hate you, but I don?t want to cause you any more worry.? But the young sometimes have causes that go far beyond the personal. One of the most eloquent notes in the volume is written by two teenagers to their parents: ?In our opinion, death isn?t something terrible, but something kind. Bearing in mind all the evil things that go in the world, death is man?s best friend.? For the writers, death is the option of freeing oneself from an imperfect life: ?As erstwhile true human beings?we shall live for ever in the rest of humanity.?

 Grashoff touches on suicide theories in his discussion, and gives the briefest of notes with the letters ? and no dates ? so as to release the expressions of ?pain? from the ?analytical embrace? of sociologists, philosophers, doctors and lawyers. But this attempt to approach empirically the unplumbed possibilities of the human mind has its downside too. A context ? whether historical, social, economic or emotional ? cannot be easily dismissed if clues to the hard decision are to be found. Or if questions are to be asked about the firmness of the decision, the sudden ambivalence, the hidden cry for attention. For some suicides are very simple and impersonal, committed purely because of irredeemable poverty wrought by debt after a life of hard work. That is how farmers in India die, creating an inarticulate universe of self-destruction that Grashoff cannot represent, but which his questions hint at.

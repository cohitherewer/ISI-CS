 Damage control

 Sir ? ?Army first step in gender equality? (July 11) is not as pathbreaking as it seems. In 2004, the National Security Guards introduced a 12-member woman commando team. The Tamil Nadu police are one of the first in the country to train women commandoes. So if the Indian Army decides to expand training programmes for woman cadets on a par with males, it can only be seen as a damage-control measure. For women who have proved their worth in the air force, VIP security, and even bomb disposal, ground combat should be small fry.

 Yours faithfully,

 End of a promise

 Sir ? A day after the Agni III ballistic missile plunged into the Bay of Bengal without hitting its target, the Indian Space Research Organization met with a jolt when GSLV FO2, carrying the Insat-4C communication satellite, deviated from its course and exploded merely 60 seconds after being launched on July 10 (?Trusted rocket blows up on pride?, July 11). This, therefore, is the right time to remember that failure is the cornerstone of success and the effort and endeavour of the Isro scientists should be acknowledged. The team of scientists and technicians should be lauded for its achievements and spared unsavoury political comments for the fulfilment of India?s space ambition. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

 Sir ? The Isro was rather na?ve in not insuring the GSLV and the Insat-4C. The argument that this was not done as a matter of policy makes its position more untenable. The example of the US practice of no insurance for space launches from its soil is irrelevant since American and Indian resources cannot be compared. Nor is the contention that the insurance premium would have been too high a valid premise, since, in the event of an unsuccessful launch, it may have been possible to recover about three-fourths of the cost. Finally, the fact that both the insurance and the space agencies are Central government entities need not have been a matter of concern as the state-owned insurance companies could get such a large cover re-insured by foreign underwriters, thus negating a direct risk to so much government money. Moreover, since the Isro seems to be serious about a second launch as early as possible, it would have made more sense to get the money from insurance rather than beg the state for additional resources or divert committed funds from planned and/or implemented programmes. These arguments only try to give lame excuses for the failure to insure the GSLV. Or is India afraid to get ahead of the US on this count? 

 Yours faithfully, 

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Any death is sad, including that of a farmer, and a death cannot be suppressed behind sanitized figures (?Durkheim in Vidarbha?, July 11). The media have done the right thing by raising a brouhaha about farmers? suicides in Vidarbha. It is hard to believe that the price at which we buy agricultural produce from the market is below their cost of production and distribution. The price at which we procure rice or vegetables or pulses is not so low so as to push their grower to suicide. Rather, rising prices are pushing us to the brink of suicide. Agriculture remains the most pampered sector of the Indian economy, since farmers have tremendous political clout. They do not pay tax, their resources and fertilizers are highly subsidized, and yet they claim that agriculture is becoming economically unviable. Why do farmers not stop cultivating when they have no hope of reward? Will someone explain?

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

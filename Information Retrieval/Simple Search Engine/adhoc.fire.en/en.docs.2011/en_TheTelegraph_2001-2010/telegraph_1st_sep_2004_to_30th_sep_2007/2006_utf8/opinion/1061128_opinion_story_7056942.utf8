 LOOK WHOS TALKING

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The quest for more and more cash has become the driving force in almost all activities at the cost of excellence that comes with hard endeavour and disciplined training. The Indian cricket scene suffers from this greed and mad celebration of failed heroes who seem to win by, what in local parlance is called, tukka! The lack of true skill, steady play, mature thinking on the ground, exercise, sane diet, controlled socializing, zealous practice, rest, concentration on the game rather than on being a brand ambassador, are the essential ingredients that will raise their performance to a consistent international level.

 The joke last week was when indisciplined and errant members of parliament decided to question the professionalism of the cricket team when they themselves have proven their failure in governing India. A bunch of overly privileged men and women who live off the citizen, and have lowered ethical standards, condoned and often endorsed corruption, who have, with the help of the babu, broken the rules that they themselves constructed, who have behaved and operated much like their erstwhile colonial masters have the gall to get up and reprimand a sports team. It smacks of something unsavoury, slightly devious and parochial. Is it an onslaught on Greg Chappell because he belongs to the casteless fraternity of the game rather than to the same race as most of the players? Are our elected representatives stuck in a time warp? Are they not sticking their fingers into areas that are autonomous and not of their concern?

 Without correction

 These MPs should be making demands on their own tribe, looking at ways to reform their ineptitude, the exploitative reality and the corruption and greed that have overwhelmed us all. The constant infighting at the cost of the constituent, the chronic lethargy, the consistent failure to deliver a civil society across class and caste lines despite being independent for sixty years, makes a mockery of the ability, acumen, as well as the commitment and skill of the political class. Surely, this breed of professional politicos should correct themselves and their abysmal record of performance before casting aspersions on any other group. They have managed to degrade a great and gracious civilization by demeaning its plural character and intrinsic strengths. It is that constituency, parliamentarians and all the members of our legislative assemblies, that needs reform and correction.

 Quality has not come of age in post-independent India and, without it, this country will not become the superpower that our leaders keep suggesting we are on the verge of becoming. The dumbing down of India, to use a dumb colloquial expression, has some frightening consequences. An unintelligent, subservient, insular, smug and centralized super authority at the Centre and in the states, led by rapacious politicians who know they can rule the roost and rape the dignity of their fiefdoms, sends shudders down ones spine. 

 The lost opportunity, the corrosion of a tryst with destiny, the betrayal of freedom come together, ominously, to compel India and Bharat into taking on the attributes of an anarchic banana republic. Politicians are fooling themselves if they believe that a 10 per cent rate of growth will make this nation into an economic and, therefore, a future political superpower. 

 This rate of growth and its supposed trickle down are for a comparatively small lot of citizens and do not embrace the large human resources of India. Till this social and economic correction does not become the priority of the government and governance, India will remain a large subcontinent which is unable to deal with the gaping disparities that force political and social upheavals, all resulting from thoughtless policies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TORTUOUS PATH

 Traders with nothing better to do got together under a neem tree in the 1830s to trade East India Company bonds, and formed the Calcutta Stock Exchange. Little could this shouting brigade have imagined that they would draw the wrath of the high and mighty one day. When investors greeted his fancied budget of 2001 with a spectacular crash, the finance minister, Mr Yashwant Sinha, was convinced that stockbrokers had conspired to rob him of his moment of glory.

 He decided to teach them a lesson. His punishment was demutualization. Mr Sinha had it in mind to separate ownership of the stock exchanges from the right to enter their trading rings. Demutualization would mean taking away ownership from stockbrokers. If members could sell the assets of stock exchanges, they could retire with a tidy nest egg. But the ministry could not just watch while those naughty brokers got rich. So it threatened to tax the capital gains. That brought a procession of brokers to Delhi to plead for exemption from tax. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Board of India appointed a committee under Mr M.H. Kenia; it supported tax exemption, proposed a single model of demutualization, and looked forward to a future when all private stock exchanges would merge into one. That would have strengthened competition against the NSE, owned by government financial institutions. It did not suit the government, so it dragged its feet.

 Stock exchanges other than the BSE and NSE have lost most of their business; they have been slumbering and dreaming. Their fondest dream has been to attract foreign investment and technology, and to trade in foreign financial assets. That dream is unlikely to be realized after the decisions announced last Friday by the Reserve Bank of India and Sebi. For they have decreed that stock exchanges can take in foreign direct investment up to 26 per cent and portfolio investment up to 23 per cent, but that they cannot give any seats on the board or any voice in management to foreign investors. Those terms are unlikely to persuade foreign financial intermediaries to put serious efforts into modernizing Indian stock exchanges; so they are likely to lead to further lobbying by the latter and further ponderous deliberations by the authorities. All this labour is wasted, for most members of other stock exchanges have taken terminals to trade on the NSE and the BSE; the borders between stock exchanges have disappeared. In the circumstances, restrictions on foreign investment make no sense. A stock exchange is just a trading platform. It can hardly affect the fortunes of the nation; but competition amongst stock exchanges can create markets for new assets, such as for shares of small local companies or insurance against crop failure. The government should free the capital markets for once; it will get a pleasant surprise.

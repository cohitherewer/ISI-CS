 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Working with government agencies, employers and workers and other concerned groups such as NGOs is particularly important, as these groups are often well placed to identify instances of abuse and to support children once they have been removed from employment.

 Inspection procedures should specifically include cooperation with the police, social services and juvenile courts. The use of intermediaries has proved particularly useful in dealing with sensitive aspects of child labour. And they should encourage collaboration with employers? and workers? organizations...through the collective negotiation and workers? representation machinery...

 ....Inspectors should also contribute to the systematic gathering of information on the nature and extent of child labour...data which can be then used in policy development, planning, monitoring, publications, research etc.

 ....Earlier, the main political, legal, economic and organisational factors which tend to prevent effective reduction in the scale and seriousness of child labour were mentioned. This part considers how these and other...problems inhibit the efforts of labour inspectors...

 ....Even where the political will exists to ratify international Conventions and adopt effective legislation, that is only a starting point, unless accompanied by programmes of action, joint initiatives with employers? organisations and trade unions and appropriate media publicity....Promoted by public opinion and...an administration which was convinced of the usefulness of constructing a defence against abuse, labour legislation made it possible, in combination with other measures such as compulsory school attendance, raising living standards in a context of economic development and reducing inequalities, to decrease the number of children at work and abolish the most scandalous situations.

 In some countries, however...legislation on child labour was grafted artificially onto a fragile economy and a society which had not incorporated the underlying values of the international Conventions and treaties designed to protect children. In such a context legislation can only be effective if it is backed by strong political will to implement it and is adapted to the real situation of working children.

 Unless...the initiative is driven by an action programme which is given due publicity, the labour inspectors? actions and arguments will not be seen as part of a national campaign and they will have individually to justify their actions in the face of local practice and prejudice.

 ....Appropriate legislation to outlaw all or certain categories of child labour or to define unacceptable types of work by age, the associated legislation on the registration of births, necessary to prove age, may not exist or not be followed, making enforcement of age related legislation extremely uncertain. There may also not be adequate legislation on compulsory education for the children removed from work or minimal social care, which again faces the inspector with the practical dilemma of deciding whether it may not be worse or more dangerous for the child to be removed from work but continue at risk on the street or in less ?visible? employment. There are seldom childcare facilities for the dependent children of often extremely young mothers who therefore have no alternative but to bring their children to work and possibly expose them to toxic solvents, fungicides and herbicides. Although faced with the adverse practical consequences of such institutional inadequacies and the lack of vocational training facilities the inspector is not able...to do anything to fill the void.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

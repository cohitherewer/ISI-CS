 Surviving the guru

 Sir ? Many, like me, must have been amused to read ?Guru Greg? (April 2), which tried to project the Australian coach of the Indian team as a management guru. Whatever Greg Chappell is supposed to have informed Dola Mitra is elementary in human resource management. I recall what a management expert told us, a group of mine managers, in the early Sixties when ?management? as a subject of study had still not developed in India. While speaking on the principles of management, he told us that a housewife discharges all the important functions of a manager ? planning and organizing the household activities, including the month?s budget, directing and controlling domestic help, looking after the health of family members, children?s studies and so on. Chappell?s activities have not been, by any means, extraordinary and they are not beyond the capacity and function of a housewife in a moderately large family. Chappell has 20-odd talented cricketers plus the resources made available to him by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

 Let us take a more dispassionate view of Chappell?s achievements, as reflected in the performance of Team India ? losing a test in India to a third-string England side, repeated failures of top-order batsmen in one-dayers, inclusion of players in the team who are not 100 per cent fit, poor performance of the young cricketers like Virendra Sehwag and Zaheer Khan, bringing politics into the selection procedure and so on. The team?s recent wins are owing to spirited youngsters, most of whom were discovered by the John Wright-Sourav Ganguly duo. Chappell can never be called a good human resource manager if one remembers his slanging match with Ganguly, not to speak of his gestures at the crowd in Calcutta. In other words, neither Chappell nor his buddy, Kiran More, have much to write home about. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? The fuss being made about Greg Chappell having started a ?process? cannot be justified by the team?s performance in tests. As a coach, Chappell only seems to have continued a process that was in existence during the time of John Wright and Sourav Ganguly. Chappell?s greatest failure, in fact, has been his inability to correct the repeated mistakes of Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Y. Venugopal Rao, V.V.S. Laxman, and of late, Mohammad Kaif. His support team has not been able to prevent recurring injuries. Why are we going overboard with Chappell?s management skills? Wright never took credit for his far greater number of successes, the credit for which was shared by the players, as should be the case. Perhaps this was because Wright was not only publicity shy, but also because there was a captain who commanded much more respect on and off the field. Even after so many wins in one-dayers, Rahul Dravid seems to vacillate and lack in confidence. It is time the BCCI sits up and not only reprimands Chappell for his misdemeanours, but also starts asking him about his nexus with Kiran More. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amullya Chandra Roy,

 Sir ? In ?Guru Greg?, Dola Mitra has said that Greg Chappell is in the news for a series of ?unprecedented? wins. Perhaps she believes that test cricket is not cricket at all; under Chappell, the team has witnessed unprecedented losses in test cricket.

 Yours faithfully,

Arani Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Like many other coaches, Greg Chappell also dreams of Team India clinching the world cup. The problem is with his itch ? that is to experiment, and he has been constantly doing that with the team. But too much of anything is bad. The zeal to experiment seems to be so difficult to contain that Chappell often lands the team in dangerous situations during a match. It is fortunate that his team is blessed with some young and talented players like Munaf Patel, Irfan Pathan, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Gautam Gambhir and a few others who make up for the lapses. But if the experiments go on, then the new blood may tire out and India would once again become a team where only the top-order batsmen play the match and their dismis- sal ends the team?s chances of winning.

 Yours faithfully,

Somesh Mahanty, Durgapur

 Sir ? The report, ?Pay and Chappell way is yours? (March 31), exposes the scandalous relationship between Kiran More, by virtue of his cricket academy, and Greg Chappell, by virtue of ?The Chappell Way? programme. The More-Chappell dealings and mutual backslapping are shameful, and indicates a wilful ignorance of ethics and propriety. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chakrabarty, Bangalore

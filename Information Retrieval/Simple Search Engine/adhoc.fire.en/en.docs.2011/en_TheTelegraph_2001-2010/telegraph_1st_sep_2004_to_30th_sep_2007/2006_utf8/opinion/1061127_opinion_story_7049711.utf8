 KILL BILL

 It is difficult to be solemn, any more, about the womens bill saga. It was introduced in 1996, and in the ten years of endless and farcical wrangling that has followed that move, two equally unresolvable strands of dispute have got hopelessly intertwined. Attitudes to gender, and more specifically to women in public life, and the politics of reservations (and hence, attitudes to class, caste and minorities) are now the stuff of the whole situation. If, in 1996, Mr Sharad Yadav had feared that the bill would only benefit women with bobbed hair, then very little has changed in the intervening years. Mr Mohan Singh, chief whip of the Samajwadi Party in the Lok Sabha, is now anxious that only the stylish women, wearing lipstick and hanging around the big netas will be helped by purely gender-based reservations. Concern for the oppressed classes becomes the complicating factor here, as in Mr Lalu Prasads objections to the bill. Mr Prasad seems to be wanting a separate quota for women from the other backward classes and minorities.

 This is, of course, a bizarre combination of the purely political and regional on the one hand, and political correctness gone haywire in the other. Mr Prasads concerns are as much for women from the oppressed classes and the minority communities, as with the Rashtriya Janata Dals political relations with the Janata Dal (United). In view of this strange history, the prime ministers hope that the impressively high number of women in positions of elective authority in India should set shining example to the Parliament sounds sadly ironic. Mired in a whole range of social and political interests, it is also unfortunate that the entire matter of reservations, on whatever grounds, is not being questioned at a more fundamental level. Perhaps that is the only way to deal with the fears and passions aroused by the bill.

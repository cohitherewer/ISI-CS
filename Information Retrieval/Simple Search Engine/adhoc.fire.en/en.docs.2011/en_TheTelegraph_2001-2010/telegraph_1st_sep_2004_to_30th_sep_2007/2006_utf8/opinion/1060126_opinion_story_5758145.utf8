 ANGER IN THE AIR

 Neha Sahay

 The expressway to Zhongshan city is one of those dream roads in China which provokes envy in Indians. Trees line it, and sometimes you get a glimpse of farmlands beyond. Small brick and tin houses can be seen off and on. It?s literally another world out there, one you forget the moment you enter Zhongshan.

 Zhongshan?s walking street, with its facade of old Western-style buildings and wrought iron benches; its brightly-lit riverside, gardens, wide streets and orderly traffic, have all earned it the UN Habitat Scroll of Honour award. Unlike other coastal cities in Guangdong province, Zhongshan is a historical, 800-year old ?county?. It?s famous as the birthplace of Sun Yat Sen, regarded as the father of modern China.

 But like everywhere else on the coast, life changed drastically in this county after Mao died. It became a special economic zone. Zhongshan now has 40 ?industrial parks?, with a large enough concentration of foreign industries for the local authorities to host Chinese New Year functions specially for them.

 Forcing them out

 China?s biggest festival, the Chinese New Year, falls on January 29, and the media is full of it, advertising special dinners costing as much as 18,000 yuan per head to US $24,000 per family. Nothing spoils this festive spirit, certainly not the news about a village protest on the highway just outside Zhongshan, being violently broken up by the police, and resulting, say reports in Hong Kong?s newspapers, in the death of a 14-year-old and injuries to 30.

 If the incident has been mentioned in Chinese newspapers, it?s to contradict foreign reports : the police did not use force, the villagers did; the teenager?s death had nothing to do with the protest, she died of a heart attack. Foreign newspapers have reported that around 600 villagers were squatting on the highway, protesting about the fact that while they had received measly compensation for their agricultural land, which had been ostensibly requisitioned for a superhighway to Beijing, the government had sold the same to a Hong Kong developer for 250 times the amount, to set up special industrial zones.

 Blocking a highway in Guangdong is the easiest way to let the world know your grievance; foreign executives need to travel on these highways all the time. Did the villagers have international attention in mind or was it a desperate attempt to get the authorities to respond after their petitions had failed? Whatever their intention, they succeeded in both, though perhaps not in the way they had imagined.

 Poles apart

 Protests in China are not rare, what?s surprising is that they are resulting as they do in India: in deaths due to police violence. Until now, protests were broken up by tear gas, water hoses and arrests, not bullets and electric batons. But the last six weeks have seen three deaths of protesting villagers, all in Guangdong villages. 

 The expat community here comes to know of this only when they read their own country?s newspapers on the net, or, through the Hong Kong newspapers, available only in a few Western-style restaurants. Sometimes though, issues convulsing the countryside do make their way right into the heart of expat dinners, when a family member of one of their workers commits suicide because his farmland was requisitioned without giving him enough to survive on.

 But the two worlds remain far apart on most occasions. Just a few hours after the police action, and only a few miles away from the scene, expats gathered at an expensive restaurant to exchange Xmas holiday tales. Three days later, they wined and dined with local government officials ?whose extravagant lives were part of the reason for the protest ? to celebrate the new year.

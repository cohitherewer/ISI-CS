 GRAVE DANGER

 The Maoist mayhem in Purulia shows how real the Maoist threat in Bengal is. It cannot be any comfort to Writers? Buildings that now it is restricted to some districts far from Calcutta. Rarely before had the Maoist attacks in Bengal been as horrific as Saturday?s carnage. The rebels burnt alive a leading member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s Purulia district unit and also his wife. It shows how much bolder the rebels have grown. The other worrying aspect is the failure of the administration to act on the warning. That the two policemen assigned to protect the CPI(M) leader fled from the scene symbolizes a larger failure. They were given the assignment because the authorities had known of the threat to the leader. Yet, when the threat materialized, they not only failed to foil it but were also unwilling to face it. Prior information of Maoist strategies is useless if it is not acted upon. The chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, will have much to worry about if the police and the administration cower before Maoist threats.

 There is yet another angle to the incident that should worry politicians of all hues. The Maoists claimed to have killed the CPI(M) leader and his wife to ?take revenge for Chhoto Angaria? in West Midnapore, where 11 people were killed allegedly by CPI(M) activists in 2001. Bengal has earned considerable notoriety for its violent political culture. Most major parties have contributed to this. But the larger share of the blame must lie with the CPI(M), whose cadre routinely terrorize supporters of other parties. But anger against the Marxists cannot be justification for condoning Maoist terror. The Maoists are much more than killing squads; their main aim is to strike at the state and all its institutions through terror. All parties have a stake in fighting and condemning the Maoist methods. This stake is much larger than the small gains that prompt their political rivalries. There is, therefore, a valid point in the appeal made by Mr Anil Biswas, the state secretary of the CPI(M), to other parties to condemn the Purulia violence. But it would not help if the appeal is meant to score political points. Also, Mr Bhattacharjee must take the Centre and the governments of neighbouring states more into confidence to tackle the Maoist challenge.

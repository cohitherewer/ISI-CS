 NUDGE TO PUSH

 The saying, storm in a tea cup, does not even begin to describe the hullabaloo created by what is being called a nudge by Ricky Ponting at Mr Sharad Pawar. This needless controversy demonstrates the dangers that lurk when a powerful politician gets too close to sports. The visual evidence makes it abundantly clear that Ponting had merely shepherded Mr Pawar away from a place where the latter should not have been in the first place. Mr Pawar, as the head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, had come to give the trophy to the Australian team and captain after they had won the Champions Trophy. Having done his duty, he refused to move. He probably thought it was a fine photo-op to boost his image. But he refused to budge even after several photographs had been taken. The Aussies were keen to carry on with the celebrations on their own without the presence of a man who had had nothing to do with their victory. Mr Pawar, not to put too fine a point on it, stuck out like a sore thumb, in the midst of the Australian team. Ponting only saved him further embarrassment by gently guiding him away from the spot. The gentle guiding can be referred to as a nudge.

 This act, actually a service to Mr Pawar, has raised a public outcry in certain circles. The immediate cause of the wail of disapproval and criticism is not any statement by Mr Pawar but an utterly gratuitous condemnatory statement by Sachin Tendulkar. Indias star batsman, on his own admission, had not actually seen the incident when it had occurred. Presumably someone, not with innocent intent, drew his attention to the television replays and then elicited a comment from him. Tendulkar expressed his displeasure at the fact that Mr Pawar had been nudged. It is difficult to fathom why this nudge has provoked Tendulkars ire. Unless one were to draw the extremely cynical conclusion that Tendulkar wanted to curry favour with the president of the BCCI who is also one of the most powerful politicians of Maharashtra. The public outcry, following Tendulkars condemnation, is the manifestation of extreme chauvinism that occasionally grips sections of the Indian population. It is obvious that if Mr Pawar had not been the powerful politician that he is, the incident would not have had this extraordinarily unpleasant aftermath.

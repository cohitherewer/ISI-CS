 AGAINST HOPE

 Politics tends to be divisive everywhere, but only in Bengal can it be such an enemy of promise. It is difficult otherwise to explain how a section of the states political class is so bent on opposing the Tata groups proposed automobile project at Singur. Common sense would convince anyone that the project is a symbol of a major turning point in Bengals industrialization and economic progress. It is the first automobile project in the state in many decades. It is actually much more than the story of one industrial venture. It captures a new faith in the state and could well be the beginning of a major economic and social transformation in Bengal. The politicians who fail to understand this are clearly out of sync with the times. Even in Mr Narendra Modis Gujarat, communalists and secularists make a common cause over the states economic interests. If the Tata group is forced to shift the project outside the state because of some politicians irrational ways, it would be because the entrepreneurs in a flat world cannot afford to wait for politicians to settle their small scores. They now invest in places, at home and abroad, which offer them the best opportunities and do so fast.

 Ironically, the opposition to the Singur project may turn out to be Ms Mamata Banerjees worst political mistake. The events of the past few days have proved beyond doubt that her gambles have failed. There has been practically no sign of a genuine public support to her cause. Even at Singur, the queues of farmers turning up at the block development office to collect their compensation cheques suggest a very different response from what Ms Banerjee sought to project. There are credible signs, on the other hand, that the vast majority of the people see in the Singur project a new hope for Bengal. A handful of politicians can still cause some disruptions in order to promote their own interests. Given Ms Banerjees track record, she could still try to use the issue for yet another show of her melodramatic politics. But the Congresss shows look even more bizarre. It was one thing for the party to come closer to Ms Banerjee during the recent by-elections. But the party gains nothing by joining Ms Banerjee in a sham campaign against Bengals industrialization. After all, the Congress leaders at the Centre and in the states are as keen as Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to move in step with the new economy.

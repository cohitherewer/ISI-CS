 WRONG BOOK 

- Very little meat for the cricket lover 

John Wrights Indian Summers Viking, Rs 495

 Better at strumming 

John Wright has written the wrong book. He was the 

first real coach the Indian cricket team had. He came to his job with the apparent 

disadvantage of being a foreigner in a country where cricket is equated with patriotism. 

But he made a success of his job and earned the respect of the players. He is 

clearly a person who thinks about the game and enjoys coaching. What kind of book 

would a serious cricket lover expect from such a man?

The answer is simple. He would expect Wright to tell 

him about how he planned for a match/series, how he thought out strategy and tactics. 

More importantly, he would expect to be told about the technical strengths and 

weaknesses of the players, especially of the famous ones. I do not think these 

are unreasonable expectations from a former coach of the Indian cricket team.

These expectations are utterly belied. In this sense, 

the book is a complete let-down. Wright takes his readers through every one-day 

international and test match that India played with him as coach, and the typical 

description he provides is something like the following: we won the toss, batting 

first scored 244, Tendulkar made 80 in 70 balls, Kaif and Yuvraj made useful contributions 

but we lost as they batted better and hit our bowling all over the place. In other 

words, most of the time, he provides bald statistical summaries of the matches. 

Who, in gods name, needs John Wright to tell me all this? The reporter from The 

Telegraph who covered the match already did all that, and if the reporters 

name was Lokendra Pratap Sahi then he did it a darn side better.

When Wright is not telling readers such useless and 

well-known factual details, he is occasionally revealing what he wrote in his 

laptop or diary while a match was on. Here also the entries are predictable. When 

the chips were down, the F-word predominated the entries. Anyone interested?

While reading the book, I kept a rough count of the 

number of times Wright comes close to making a technical analysis of a players 

game. There are not more than five occasions, and many of these are not substantial 

enough to satisfy a cricket lover. Let me take two of the more solid examples. 

First on Virender Sehwag, a Wright favourite: Hes beautifully balanced, with 

a very still head and no sideways movement. That minimal movement gives him extra 

time to play his shotsHe sets himself up very quickly and uses the pace of the 

ball and a wristy flick with lots of bottom hand. Is there enough meat here? 

I would like to know from someone who watched Sehwag day in day out, in the nets 

and in matches, what were his weaknesses, how did he get out so often, what made 

him a different batsman from say a Tendulkar, a Dravid or an Inzamam? Wright says 

nothing. About Tendulkar, the subject of the second example, he is even less forthcoming. 

In Australia during the 2003-4, Tendulkar was having a quiet series. Before the 

Sydney test, Wright and he talked about his batting (no details provided). Tendulkar 

decided, he was going to keep it very tight; he wouldnt play through cover or 

square off the front foot because that was where hed been getting out. Again, 

what one would like to know from Wright is what was a batsman of Tendulkars class 

and talent doing wrong to get out driving through cover off the front point? In 

another place, on the same batsman, he speaks about his strengths: When he was 

at the crease, you could see him putting his fundamentals in place: hed watch 

the ball from the bowlers hand on to and off the bat, and adjust the backlift 

for different bowlers. This might sound elementary but it is at least something 

and anytime more attractive than boring match statistics. Pity Wright doesnt 

provide more of such analysis. There is nothing on the bowlers even though we 

are told, in passing, that Wright had made a detailed computer analysis of Kumbles 

run up.

Readers will find no analysis in this book about Gangulys 

shortcomings as a batsman and what steps Wright took to correct these. It was 

important to know this from Wright, a fellow left-hander, since it was the consistent 

lack of runs that led to Gangulys exclusion from the team. Instead we have innuendos 

about Ganguly feigning injuries, often going against what had been decided in 

planning sessions and about how he was always late for the toss. Wright praises 

Ganguly as a captain who wore his heart on his sleeve. Wright obviously doesnt.

Is there any wisdom here on the art of coaching? Precious 

little, really. He records that Bob Simpson said a coach should teach batsmen 

to get more runs, bowlers more wickets. John Buchanan said a coach takes a team 

and an individual somewhere they have never been before. Duncan Fletcher said 

a coach is a consultant to the team. And John Wright? On any given day, he writes, 

my to-do list might have included finding a white board for a team meeting and 

analysing Anil Kumbles run up on a computer. Wright was the nuts and bolts man. 

But he doesnt tell us how the nuts and bolts fit and when and where they came 

apart. 

But this is what one expects in a book written by 

a coach of John Wrights stature. Not dressing room tittle tattle, here an anecdote, 

there an anecdote, touristy details about India and its hotels and so on. Interestingly, 

the book does not have a single picture of cricket action. He obviously has another 

book somewhere in his mind, a book that will be on cricket.

Sorry if all this is harsh, Mr Wright. But as you 

know, we Bengalis wear our hearts on our sleeves.

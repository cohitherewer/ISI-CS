 GOOD OUT OF THE BAD

 Malvika Singh

 The only silver lining, if one is possible, to the Natwar Singh farce is that the prime minister and Sonia Gandhi will have to come together as proactive leaders of both the government and the party. Here is another opportunity for the leadership to galvanize Congressmen and women as well as motivate workers at the grassroots and rapidly build new memberships at the base. Senile war horses, out of step with the samba of our changing times, can now be eased off, allowing for the dynamism of the representatives of the vast majority of India to enter policymaking and rulership. This, if it happens, will be the most valuable gift for India on its 60th birthday in 2007.

 It is for Sonia Gandhi to initiate an overhaul of her party as well as a restructuring of the processes of governance without being victimized by the left and other bullying and blackmailing allies. You do not have to be a member of a socialist or communist party to rigidly believe in egalitarianism or in building infrastructure for fulfilling the basic needs of the people so they can live a life of dignity. A cleansing of the bureaucracy and the law and order machinery along with the archaic laws of the social and economic sectors is imperative and the government can put a time-bound group in place to deliver a new blueprint. 

 If this is attempted with some passion and commitment to the idea, devolved to the people through public information about the intention and the actual initiation of the process of renewal, the party in power will have the mandate of India for decades. All it requires is grit, the ability to hire and fire non-performers, and accountablity of administrators to their political bosses.

 Another third front

 There is, of course, another scenario. A rather bizarre one. Natwar Singh becomes the rallying point, as he has for a short span of time, for Digvijay Singh of the JDU, Shatrughan Sinha and Yashwant Sinha of the BJP and Amar Singh of the Samajwadi Party, all representing their respective political dispensations, flanking the suspended Congressman much like black cats, as he spits venom against his prime minister. Natwar Singh, for one split second, looked like the heir apparent for the post of a consensus candidate if the jing-bang lot came together to form a third front, the Prakash Karat dream. Looking at the scene and watching it unfold in its rather crude and unseemly fashion, the stark reality of failed political leadership, regardless of party and personage, hit one in the face. In this enactment of a tragic farce, two people, in their dignified and appropriate silence, rose above the rest Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. Neither did they respond to the abuse nor did they show any peak or discomfort. That is what leadership with dignified demeanour is all about. They stood a class apart as citizens of this ancient civilization and modern nation.

 Maybe the Congress should encourage the fall of the UPA, work behind the scenes to ensure a motley crowd of politicos to form a grand alliance and witness the charade that may well unfold for some months till it all ends in brawls over the grabbing of the spoils, all at the cost of the people of India and their trials and tribulations. 

 The left can be part of the spectacle as well, because it has proven its inability to be flexible in a coalition, unable to extricate itself from the age-old trait of a dictatorial calling of the shots it has been either black or white for them, with no shades or nuances, no adjustments and no fresh approaches to the realities of a changing world order. Without sharp intellectual discourse, debate and consensus, coalition governments will only perpetuate chaos, anarchy in decision-making and endorse the prevailing corruption. The mind has to reign supreme for any honest development.

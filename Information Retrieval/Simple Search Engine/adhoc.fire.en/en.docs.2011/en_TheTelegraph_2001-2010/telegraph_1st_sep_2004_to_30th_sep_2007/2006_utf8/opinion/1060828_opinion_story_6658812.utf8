 Half truths

 Sir In It always knows best (Aug 18), Ashok Mitra makes a selective use of facts to malign the World Bank, an institution which Mitra believes is the cause of Indias economic ills. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of economics would know that it was the policy of import substituting industrialization, protectionism and political patronage rather than high interest rates that resulted in the monopoly of large industrial houses and sub-optimal capacity utilization in India during the pre-liberalization era. In fact, as Mitra admits, high interest rates had the salutary effect of increasing the savings rate, which was essential in a scarce economy such as ours. The Indian economic policy changed course dramatically from the early Nineties, shifting its attention to export-led growth and foreign direct investment. With globalization, Indian policymakers realized that interest rates would have to be aligned with those in the United States of America and the rest of the developed world to reduce the cost of funds to industry and individuals and to boost investment from foreign and domestic sources. The consistent increase of growth rates with a simultaneous surge in Indias foreign exchange reserves is testimony to the wisdom of the low interest rate regime. The requirements of a nation change during its journey from poverty to industrialization. Our leaders should take a lesson from China it readily dispensed with Marxism when it realized that the free market would be a more effective catalyst of growth and development.

 Sir One must concede that both high and low bank rates generate savings and provide cheap capital. They also help in catering to the needs of the day. If the World Bank has changed its stance, it is because new times require new measures. If a fixed bank interest is good for all times, we would not have seen different bank rates being followed by different countries all over the world. Ashok Mitra will do well to criticize a policy on its merit and should not judge every issue with an inflexible mind. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ashok Mitra shows only one side of the coin while arguing that a low-interest-rate regime will encourage foreign investors to take over the Indian market. India, however, attracts abysmally low levels of FDI due to its stringent regulations and poor infrastructure. What Mitra fails to realize is that low interest rates encourage domestic entrepreneurs to start new projects and expand existing ones, and leave more disposable income with the consumers. It also increases economic activity and helps in generating employment. Mitra speaks as if the recent fluctuations in the stock market are a result of the foreign institutional investors ganging up against India. This is not true, given the fact that incentives and motivations behind foreign institutional investments often vary markedly, depending on market specialization and the kind of returns they generate. Factors such as high crude oil prices also play its part. To take Mitras own example of interest rates, high or low interest rates do not serve the purpose of all corporations universally. Lending institutions would naturally prefer a higher rate vis--vis an automobile company, which would benefit from a lower rate. The modus operandi of the World Bank is a lot subtler than what Mitra claims it is.

 Sir The criticisms levelled by Ashok Mitra on the World Bank for its present cheap money policy are rather dubious. In recent years, cheap money has led to the growth of both big and small entrepreneurs by reducing their interest-cost. Low interest home loans have benefited both the elderly and the young, besides rescuing numerous farmers in rural India by reducing their dependence on moneylenders. Moreover, globalization is attracting surplus foreign funds and taking care of the reduced domestic savings. If a policy helps our economy, it is not wise to criticize it just for the sake of criticizing. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir In the early years of independence, the World Bank recommended the hard money policy for India for various reasons. Now the same institution is recommending the cheap money policy. But there seems to be no self-contradiction in this new approach. This is because the Indian economy, since liberalization, has undergone major alterations that can justify the recent changes. Yet, it seems that Ashok Mitra is not happy with either policy as he picks faults with both. Maybe Mitra should have mentioned what sort of policy would have benefited the country as a whole, instead of targeting a financial institution. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting Shot

 Sir I concur with Sunanda K. Datta-Ray when he says that Indians behave quite appallingly in flights and airports (Cattle-class anguish, Aug 26). Recently, at a Bangkok airport, I saw a few Indians at the boarding counter of a Delhi-bound flight having a heated argument over the excess weight of cabin baggage in the belief that they could get the airline rules relaxed by shouting at the top of their voices. Indians are often seen talking loudly at the lounge, disturbing fellow passengers. India is a developing country. It is high time we rid ourselves of uncouth manners and learn to behave more politely. In the wake of the recent flight arrests, we should be more cautious so that we are not pulled up by the authorities. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Abhijit Das,

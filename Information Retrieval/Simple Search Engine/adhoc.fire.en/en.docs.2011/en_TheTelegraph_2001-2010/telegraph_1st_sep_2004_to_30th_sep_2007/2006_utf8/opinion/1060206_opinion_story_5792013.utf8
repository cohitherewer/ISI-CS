 Letters to Editor

 Rough landings

 Sir ? The agitation of the staff of Indian airports over the privatization of Mumbai and Delhi airports was pointless (?Strike threat over airport bidding?, Jan 31). The employees, supported mainly by the left, want the Airport Authority of India to be entrusted with the job. Such an unrealistic demand proves the lack of understanding of the actual situation on the part of the agitators. The AAI simply does not have the resources or expertise to handle the responsibility. When the government has already guaranteed job security to the employees, they should not be so unreasonable. Useless agitation and opposition to all things progressive seem to be the top priorities of the left, but they ought to realize that they are doing nothing but standing in the way of development.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The effort of the government to inject competition and competence in the aviation industry is commendable. Consortiums like GMR-Fraport and GVK-South Africa Airport are no doubt more qualified than their Indian counterparts to revamp the outdated infrastructure of our airports. It should be pointed out to the airport employees, who had stalled work to protest against the government?s decision, that improvements in the aviation sector, as in all others, needs dedication, competition, and a will to improve ? all of which are lacking in them.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The tender-bid for the privatization of airports smell of foul play. Anil Ambani is justified in his charge that changes in tender-conditions should not have been allowed after the publication of tender-notice. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The objection of the employees to the privatization of airports raises a fundamental point: What rights do the employees have to resist privatization? The airports are national property, and decisions about their maintenance can only be made by the parliament. The employees are hired to ensure that the airports are run in the proper manner ? their rights do not extend further.

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The strike by the AAI employees caused serious problems to air-travellers. It must also have sent all the wrong signals to foreign airlines which are eager to take advantage of the government?s open-sky policy. Unless this kind of subversive attitude is firmly thwarted, more such strikes will follow.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R.Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? With the emergence of low-cost airlines, air travel is no longer a luxury of the rich. But the infrastructure of most Indian airports is inadequate to cater to this growing demand. During peak hours, the airports often resemble railway stations. Whenever flights are disrupted, the stranded passengers do not get even the basic amenities at the airports. Those opposing modernization should remember that any change is welcome so long as it is makes Indian airports more user-friendly.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Surely the left leaders are not so na?ve as to believe that a moribund and bureaucratic organization like the AAI is equipped to handle the huge modernization project for the major Indian airports. It is a shame that progressive leaders of the left like Sitaram Yechury are opposing the decision to call in private players, to gain political mileage. The staff at Indian airports have become synonymous with inefficiency, and protecting inefficiency will do nothing but tarnish the left?s image before the people. Modernized airports will create new job opportunities. But yes, these jobs will require people to work for their pay. Perhaps this is what the leftists and their followers are angry about.

 Yours faithfully,

Amajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Centre?s decision to modernize and privatize the Delhi and Mumbai airports is welcome. But why is the modernization bid limited to the airports in Delhi and Mumbai only, when those in Calcutta and Chennai are equally important and as much in need of development? At the same time, modernization and privatization are not synonymous. Privatization might create a monopoly and suppress the voice of the workers. The workers? rights should be kept in mind while bringing in the wave of modernization in the airports.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Bebarta, Orissa

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Air strike?(Feb 1), rightly points out that blackmail has become another name for trade unionism in India. With their arm-twisting, the unions are only showing what has brought the Indian aviation sector to such a sorry state. The pampered employees must be told once and for all that they cannot hold a public service to ransom. Thankfully, the government has refused to succumb to their demands this time. And the left?s volte face proves that taking up the cause of the airport staff was a political move.

 Yours faithfully,

Megha. A, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The aviation minister?s claim that no employee will lose his job after Delhi and Mumbai airports are privatized is a lie. Can private companies, whose aim is to earn maximum profit, ever solve the unemployment problem in this country? The hire-and-fire policy might work in Western countries, with smaller populations and better social security systems, but not in India. Providing world-class facilities to air travellers should be secondary to meeting the basic demands of the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

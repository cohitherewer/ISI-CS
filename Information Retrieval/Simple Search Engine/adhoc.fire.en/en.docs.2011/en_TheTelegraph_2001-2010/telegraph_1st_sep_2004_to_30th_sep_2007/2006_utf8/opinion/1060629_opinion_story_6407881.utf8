 BROTHER AND SISTER

 On June 5, 2006 in the Missionghat area of Malda, Swapan Haldar throttled to death his sister, Bhashani, before the family. Two days later, the stench made neighbours inform the police. The family alleged that despite warnings, Bhashani had continued to be part of a sex racket ? and Swapan murdered her. Swapan Haldar speaks from the Malda correctional home:

 Swapan Haldar: After my sister Bhashani entered the sex racket, the family had come under the poison-gaze (bishnajar) of the entire neighbourhood. When she continued her association in spite of being repeatedly forbidden, people started calling me ?brother of a slut?. I have killed her to save the family?s honour. Nobody?s sister should be like my sister. I used to love my sister very much. But if I had not killed my sister, her disgrace would have forced the whole family to suicide.

 If we had killed ourselves for her misdeeds, society would have thought us cowards. This would not have preserved the family?s honour. The punishment I have given my sister for her misdeeds will, I believe, stop the neighbourhood from holding us in its poison-gaze.

 I feel sad for my wife. The baby in my wife?s womb will not have to bear my shame. The child will know that its father did not allow wickedness. This alone is my consolation. The family depended on me. After I have come away to prison, they are suffering greatly. But what can I do, tell me? Honour is much bigger than suffering. To preserve honour one has to suffer a little.

 Saraswati (mother): To get Bhashani married Swapan worked in a sweet-shop. Unable to bear her husband?s torture, she came back. Swapan gave her shelter and found her work as a housemaid. But instead of working there, Bhashani entered the sex racket. (With Pramila, Swapan?s sister-in-law) If Bhashani hadn?t been killed, the entire family would have had to die. By killing Bhashani, Swapan has left the family?s honour intact. There was no other way but to kill her. With Bhashani dead, we have found peace.

 Neighbours: Because of Bhashani, the entire neighbourhood was getting a bad name. Her clients were a source of disturbance to everyone. By killing a sister who strayed, Swapan has saved the honour of the whole of society. We are with him.

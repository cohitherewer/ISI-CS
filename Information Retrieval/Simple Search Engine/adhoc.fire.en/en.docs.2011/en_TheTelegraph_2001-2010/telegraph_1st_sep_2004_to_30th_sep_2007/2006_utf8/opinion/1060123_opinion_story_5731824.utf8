 BACK TO SQUARE ONE

 Gwynne Dyer

 Wars only end when one side wins, or both sides conclude that they can?t gain any more by fighting. Neither side can actually win in Sri Lanka, but too many people on both sides still believe they can get a better deal by more fighting, so it?s back to the war that they suspended in 2002.

 In the past month, about 70 soldiers have been killed in attacks that the government blames on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, while the LTTE claims that 40 Tamil civilians have been killed by government forces.At some point, either the newly elected president, Mahinda Rajapakse, or Tamil Tiger leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, will declare the ceasefire over, but for practical purposes it already is.

 Sri Lanka is no more complex in ethnic or religious terms than many of its neighbours in south Asia, but it has fallen into a pit of ethnic hatred and violence from which it is now very hard to escape. The Sinhala-speaking Buddhists have shared the island with the Tamil-speakers (who are Hindu or Muslim) for almost two millennia, but it took the machinations of the British and the demagoguery of politicians to turn them into enemies.

 Divided house

 Having overthrown the Buddhist kingdom of Kandy in 1815, the new British rulers found that Tamils were more willing to work for them than the old Sinhala elite. The colonial administration depended heavily on Tamils, who benefited greatly as a result, but after independence in 1948 the shoe was on the other foot. During the Fifties and Sixties, the most successful Sinhala politicians were those who tried to destroy the Tamils? advantages by making Sinhala the official language and restricting government jobs and university places open to Tamils.

 They also laid the foundations for civil war: by 1976 most Tamils backed parties that demanded autonomy for Tamil-majority areas. In 1983, after a series of ghastly anti-Tamil pogroms in the capital, the Tamil Tigers took over from elected politicians and the insurgency began. But neither the Tigers nor the army could win, despite 64,000 dead and over a million refugees. 

 The Sinhalese have spent the past two decades arguing about what terms to offer the Tamils, but the hard-line nationalists on the Sinhala side win most of the arguments. The president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, talked endlessly about a peace deal with the Tamils, but every time one of the Sinhala nationalist parties that supported her objected to the terms she was offering, she made them harsher.

 More blood

 When a new prime minister, Ranil Wickramasinghe, won the 2001 elections with the support of a coalition of opposition parties and tried to offer the Tamils better terms, she accused him of betraying the country and suspended parliament to halt the peace process. So Wickramasinghe ran for the presidency against Kumaratunga?s chosen successor, Mahinda Rajapakse. He would have won, too ? except that by then the Tamil Tigers had given up on the peace talks.

 If Tamils had voted in large numbers, they would certainly have supported Wickramasinghe, but the Tigers ordered them to abstain, so Rajapakse scored a narrow victory instead. And Rajapakse, once willing to talk about autonomy, has been getting steadily less conciliatory as his dependence on Sinhala ultra-nationalist parties has deepened.

 The Tamil Tigers had already decided to restart the war: the electoral boycott that brought Rajapakse to power was just a device to shift the blame onto the Sinhalese. So now the war is restarting, and although everybody knows that the final deal must include a Tamil autonomous area, many thousands more will die before the next attempt at a negotiated settlement.

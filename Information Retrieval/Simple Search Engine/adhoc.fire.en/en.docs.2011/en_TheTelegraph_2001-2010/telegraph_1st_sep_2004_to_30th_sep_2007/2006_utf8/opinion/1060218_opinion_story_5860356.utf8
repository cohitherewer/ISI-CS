 ORDER OF MUSIC

 Every serious music-maker knows that the music he performs is far more significant than his own persona, no matter what his celebrity status happens to be. Similarly, there is a subtle, but indisputable, hierarchy among the instruments and the roles they play in the music. In a symphony orchestra playing Western classical music, for example, the violins are more important than say the piccolo or the timpani. This is obvious from the way the orchestra is arranged and made to sit. In a duet involving a singer and a pianist, the piano assumes a secondary role; the piano only accompanies. The nature of the music and the performance determine the hierarchy and importance. These features are by no means unique to Western classical music. They hold good for Indian classical music as well. Nobody will argue that the tanpura that plays the two shuddha notes unobtrusively with a singer or an instrumentalist is as important as the vocalist or the instrumentalist. This is not to diminish the role that the tanpura performs in the music-making but to reiterate an order of importance that is integral to the success of a musical performance.

 This reiteration would not have been necessary had it not been for an unseemly display by none other than the eminent tabla-player, Zakir Hussain, while he was accompanying Ravi Shankar. Zakir Hussain?s complaint was that the sound system had been so set up as to diminish the sound quality of his instrument. Ravi Shankar?s retort was that the sound of the tabla should always be 20 per cent lower than that of the sitar. What was at issue here was the order of priority between the principal instrument and the accompanying one. The tabla, in the tradition of Indian classical music as it has evolved, is always an accompaniment. It has never been assigned the same status as a sitar, a sarod or a veena. In the past, it is said, that the tabla-player was not even allowed to sit while he played. Things have indeed changed since those more status-conscious times, but the tabla remains an accompanying instrument and nothing more. This is true despite the fact that it has become a standard practice for a sitar- or a sarod-player to allow the tabla-player a few minutes of solo playing to show off his virtuosity. This is made more as a concession than as an intrinsic part of the music being played. The solo tabla has no place in the elaboration of a raga being carried out by the main instrument or vocalist.

 One reason why tabla-players think their status has changed is related to their involvement in jazz bands and in groups playing fusion music. These kinds of music, in structure, theory and performance, are different from the creation and playing of Indian classical music. Tabla-players who perform these different kinds of music should not allow their ego, relevant in one realm, to impinge on their secondary role in Indian classical music. Tabla-players should not be too loud in their playing and in the projection of their persona.

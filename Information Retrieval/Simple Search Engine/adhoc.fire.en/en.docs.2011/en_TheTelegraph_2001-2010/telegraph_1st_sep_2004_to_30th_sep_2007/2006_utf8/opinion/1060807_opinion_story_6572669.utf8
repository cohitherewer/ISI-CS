 Raghubir Singhs impression of Bombays Crawford Market

 Travelling from Bandra to the centre of the city in a car was expensive, even in 1984. Thats when I began to take the local train, as its called in Bombay, from Bandra to Churchgate, emerging, with a stream of commuters, into the areas in which I went to school and grew up. The first-class compartments of seven such trains, as we know, were ripped apart by explosions; but the trains, even during normal rush hour, represent a frenetic and excessive mode of travel. Mehta writes well about them and their passengers and their daily exacerbations; the Darwinian conflict among people scrambling to get a seat, and the contradictory, incongruous human impulse to give a fellow commuter a hand. For him, these people milling about Churchgate and Victoria Terminus and other stations are the crowd, a synecdoche for the city; the book, like other significant works about Bombay Midnights Children and Love and Longing in Bombay ends with a Whitmanesque, necessarily sentimental vision of the crowd: All these ill-assorted people walking towards the giant clock on Churchgate: They are me; they are my body and flesh. The crowd is the self, 14 million avatars of it, 14 million celebrations. I will not merge into them; I have elaborated myself into them.

 The observation, I will not merge into them, introduces a Naipaulean, anti-democratic glitch before flowing again into the Whitmanesque wonder at free movement and free mingling. It reminds us that Naipauls response to the same crowd in the Sixties was one of anxiety, an anxiety about his own sense of self being swamped and smothered: And for the first time in my life I was one of the crowd. There was nothing in my appearance or dress to distinguish me from the crowd eternally hurrying into Churchgate Station.

 Neither epiphany comes too often, one suspects, to those who use these trains daily; but those who examine the experience through memory, crystallizing something thats amorphous and resistant to crystallization, will admit to having felt something of both the anxiety and the wonder. I, myself, recall the press of that rush hour, and was once advised by a kindly companion whom I never saw again to remain seated when the train got into Churchgate, so as to avoid being injured by the importunate crowd on the platform waiting to get on; he said I should get off only when the frenzy of boarding had died down. Generally though, I avoided rush hour, and my journeys became an extension of my flaneur-like activities in the city on my visits from London and, later, Oxford. I travelled both second and first class. A second-class ticket cost the absurd sum of two rupees; first class a more respectable, but cheap, seventeen rupees. In second class, you usually had people in part-time employment for companions; in first class, whose interior was on the whole identical to second class, upwardly-mobile traders, small businessmen, and accountants. I was reminded of Mehtas book again when the curious piece of news came in that a group of diamond traders, who commuted habitually with their pockets stuffed with diamonds, had been killed in the explosions.

 It was in the mid-Nineties in Oxford that I gradually came round to believing that Calcutta, where my parents had moved to in 1989, had ceased to be Indias most interesting metropolis; that it was Bombay that had begun to display the contraries, the unexpectedness, and the capacity for self-renewal that characterize the great cities of the world. Globalization had acted upon it like alchemy. I, whod grown up scorning it, and had viewed my parents move to Calcutta with indifference and even satisfaction, believing that it wasnt possible for me to have any emotional attachment to Bombay (certain that, in time, Id forget it), remember stopping one day at a window at Blackwells bookshop, where Raghubir Singhs book of photographs, Bombay: Gateway to India, was opened and displayed, and staring, for about a minute, at the two pages which a large rectangular photo occupied. It was a picture obviously taken from a balcony or a window of an apartment on Malabar Hill, such as the one I lived in. One of the attractions of these apartments is their view of the sea and South Bombay, and here, too, the curve of the Marine Drive, the astonishingly thick clusters of skyscrapers and low buildings, looking a bit charred in the daylight, the Arabian Sea on the right, and then visible again on the left behind the densely inhabited land mass, the smudges of the islands of Elephanta and Trombay that I once could see morning and afternoon from the balcony, and, closer, the back of an apartment, with potted plants on the terrace all this was contained in the picture, qualified only by the wobbly lines of skeletal bamboo scaffolding: the building from which Singh had taken the photograph was being painted.

 Each time I passed through Broad Street, I stopped at that window: the window of Blackwells and the one in the photograph. I was moved by the clarity of the poor but sturdy bamboo, by the way they both impeded and framed the view. Later, I found the book in the India Institute library in the New Bodleian, and studied it carefully, photograph by photograph, as Naipaul, in the odd but excellent conversation that comprises the introduction, says you must. For me, this is still the most expressive work on Bombay Ive encountered; deeply moving in the shift in sensibility it registers in the work of an already established and gifted photographer, a shift made not too many years before he suddenly died, and one that represents a conundrum, a moment, faced by all artists whod been formed by modernity and modernism, and now found themselves faced, in their backyards, with the globalized world. Singhs major work on a metropolis before this one had been the book on Calcutta, where his pictures show the influence and the quirky humanity of Cartier-Bresson, Satyajit Ray, and, indeed, the sort of aesthetic that Calcutta itself had represented for a century and a half: of uncovering, through a modernist paradox, the intimate and the natural in urban disrepair and industrial decay, of recuperating the secretly familiar and quickening in the shabby and inhospitable.

 In the new book though, as Naipaul observes shrewdly, the recurring metaphor and motif is glass, the glass of a shop window, or of a door to a plush department store or hotel: glass, which introduces an element of surface and polish, which skews the photographers image by producing its own, which at once separates and gives access. Its not quite possible to feel at home in the city of these pictures: glass not only invents the city it encloses, reveals, and reflects, but also the photographer taking the picture Singh says to Naipaul that hes quite content to become inadvertently part of the frame, his outline and flash contained in the glass. In many ways this book explained to me why, imaginatively, Bombays time had come, and Calcuttas seem to have passed in the Nineties. 

 It was not just to do with the failure of one city, and the success of the other; for failure itself had been an integral part of modernist creativity. It was to do with the onus of creativity passing, in the globalized world, from the individual to a variety of scattered sources, to a terrain that marginalized the artist and reproduced its own images. In India, Bombay had become that terrain; and Singhs book is a way of acknowledging what that subtle but decisive change means to the photographer, to the witness and bystander. The writer just sees a few details, and he has to look hard at these, says Naipaul to Singh, while the photographer has to see it all; to which Singh responds, No. The writer does too, and points out to Naipaul a scene from his own India: A Million Mutinies Now.

 FIRST AMONG EQUALS

 The odd man out / Raoji Bandodkar

 Red carpet welcome

 The fourth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas ended only recently. The number of persons of Indian origin living abroad, even an exaggerated figure of 30 million, account for 2.8 per cent of our population. Do they contribute as much as 2.8 per cent towards our national product? That is unlikely. Are they, as is often professed, a national asset? Or are they an irrelevance?

 Apart from those wealthy enough to make frequent visits to their motherland, persons of Indian origin residing in developing countries abroad regard India through a nostalgic religio-cultural haze that makes their vision of the country anachronistic. They would like to visit India for spiritual reasons, to meet family members and for medical treatment. As generations pass by, their interest and involvement with India grows weaker and their descendants will not have the same attachment to their country of origin. Apart from sentiment, they will have nothing to invest in India. 

 The Indians giving their day-labour in uncongenial conditions abroad, such as in the Gulf, fall in a special category since they do not enjoy any right of residence and, therefore, cannot contemplate any long-term settlement outside the country. These Indians have taken India with them abroad. They eat Indian food, attend Indian social, cultural and religious events and their children study in Indian schools. Their ties with India are intimate because, in a way, they have never left. They contribute substantially towards making India the world?s top destination for remittances from abroad.

 Those living in the developed world have different priorities. They try to achieve a duality of being, by making a success of themselves both in the land of their adopted residence and in their land of origin. In the former, with a few exceptions, their efforts are mostly unremarkable and in the latter, almost insignificant. In the advanced countries, the opulent Indian classes are notable for their conspicuous consumption, ostentatious lifestyle, and a scramble for local rank and honorifics which would be risible if it were not so brash. But it is these very Indians that New Delhi seeks to court for their patriotism and putative investments. Their activities are extensively covered by the foreign correspondents of the Indian print media, whose reports are almost always more concerned with the actions, howsoever banal, of Indians overseas than about any major events in the countries they live in.

 In the poor developing countries of the former British empire, where the Indian communities are descendants of those who have been forced or persuaded by circumstances to labour abroad for a livelihood, the government of India?s interest has been sporadic. The economic, social and political welfare of these lesser breeds of Indians abroad have been largely neglected, even in cases where the persons of Indian origin have constituted a majority or near-majority and have frequently had political power denied to them, such as in Guyana, Trinidad and Fiji, by a combination of blatant racism and devious chicanery. In Africa, the communities of Indian origin have been caught between retreating white superiority and intolerant African nationalism. In South Africa, the worst is yet to come for persons of Indian origin. What safeguards has the Indian government provided and what interventions has it made to prevent such a disaster? The government probably hopes that over one million South Africans of Indian origin will head westward rather than towards India. Significantly, South Africa is the land of the ostrich which buries its head in the sand.

 The great expectations of vast inward investment flows from expatriate Indians on the lines of China will never materialize. Nor will there be a large demand for cards for persons of Indian origin or overseas Indian citizenship. Indians abroad are interested in specific charitable causes which bear their name, in real estate and other deals that guarantee a sizeable and short-term return, and in tax avoidance. They will invest in ?hot? money, readily redeemable and repatriatable in hard currency. They endlessly seek to benefit from the best of both worlds. By all means, let the ever-optimistic government grant them PIO cards, dual nationality, miscellaneous grand titular honours, the external vote and many other facilities but, of course, with none of the liabilities of the Indian citizen who pays his taxes for his nation?s betterment. But do not expect any change of heart in return. The well-off person of Indian origin abroad wants to be treated as a ?philanthropist-prodigal son-patriot-success story? because he is a non-resident Indian and like Oliver Twist, he will always ask for more.

 When PIOs have shown real patriotism and heroism, even at the risk of life and limb ? as in the role they performed on a completely voluntary basis to shelter and evacuate hundreds and thousands of fellow Indians before the first Gulf war ? their humanitarian gesture failed to be recognized by an ungrateful government in New Delhi. But then, those persons did not flaunt their wealth, socialize with Indian politicians or host lavish weddings. They were just like other normal Indians and did not merit any appreciation from the government of the day.

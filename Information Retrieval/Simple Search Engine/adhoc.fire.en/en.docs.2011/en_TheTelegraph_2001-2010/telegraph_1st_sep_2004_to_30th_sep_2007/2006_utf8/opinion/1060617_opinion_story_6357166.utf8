The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BREAKING FREE

 There is an unmistakable line that separates the good player from the brilliant one. And it is always the latter who succeeds in capturing and inspiring the public imagination. Bobby Charlton was a supremely good footballer but he never quite enthralled the terraces at Old Trafford in the way George Best did. Best, arguably the greatest ball player soccer has seen who never played in a World Cup, captivated the fans of Manchester United by his matchless dribbling, passing and shooting. He was the darling of the crowds. His utterly undisciplined personal life seemed to be mirrored in his football: he did things which even the very good player could never dream of doing. Even Pel? had to admit that Best was indeed the best. Like Pel?, Best had that extra something which others, even the most excellent, lacked. Other sports have seen similar phenomena. Bjorn Borg seemed unbeatable in tennis till a John McEnroe appeared on the scene. The McEnroe magic seemed to bring together, in a previously unimaginable way, the strength of power tennis with the sheer beauty of touch tennis. He had every shot in the book, plus a few of his own. To his skills he brought a personality that seemed human ? tempestuous, volatile, prone to error ? which was in sharp contrast to the ice-like figure of Borg. In cricket, think of the almost endless controversy between Victor Trumper and Don Bradman: the artist and the run-getting machine; think of why, over the years, the real crowd-pullers have been players like Keith Miller and Gary Sobers.

 This lure of the artist and of sheer brilliance has something to do with the very nature of sports. Sports, if one forgets for the moment George Orwell?s disparaging comments about it, is the ultimate celebration of the free spirit. This is at the heart of all games. To set the mind and the body free, and to let them perform with a limited number of accessories within a given set of rules. The rules and the accessories remain the same but there can be only one Pel? or Best, there has only been one Sobers. The reasons for this are impossible to pin down. Natural and acquired skills are the obvious reasons. But is that all there is to it? There is something a brilliant player brings to the way he exhibits his skills that makes him primus inter pares, the first among peers. There is ease, a kind of lazy brilliance that the crowds love. A masterly player, because he aspires for the seemingly unattainable, is always prone to making mistakes. But even those mistakes are memorable because of the attempt that was made.

 These points come to mind as the football World Cup unfolds. There is the stodgy, almost robot-like football played by the teams from Europe. In contrast, there is the sheer brilliance of the Latin American teams. The winner will be decided by who plays better football on the final night. But it can be safely predicted even in these early days that the public imagination will be enthralled by those who play the more brilliant football, thus celebrating the free spirit manifest in all sports.

 Letters to Editor

 Sour goes the milk

 Sir ? The proposed no-confidence motion against Verghese Kurien, which forced him to resign as chairman of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, was cruel in its insensitivity (?Hero Kurien scripts sad end?, March 21). How can a handful of people propose a no-confidence motion against a person in whom the entire nation still has confidence? Kurien, with his business acumen and dedication, almost single-handedly brought about the white revolution in India. Those who oppose him now are led by vested interests. They are forgetting his contribution to the cooperative dairy sector and they can never reach the level attained by Kurien simply because they lack his commitment and dedication to rural India.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that when Verghese Kurien is still a name that inspires awe and respect around the world, in his own country, he has been unceremoniously pushed out of the very organization he established and nurtured. The government should have intervened to prevent disrespect to the great man. Kurien?s one-time loyalists, Amrita Patel and B.M. Vyas, should make a public announcement of the reasons which turned their relation with him from ?utterly-butterly? to ?so bitterly?.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Verghese Kurien?s long walk in the limelight has earned him a few foes including his prot?g?s who coerced his reluctant exit. Surely Kurien does not deserve this treatment at the twilight of his career. The sordid events notwithstanding, for millions of Indians, Kurien will remain a one-man industry, synonymous with the brand, Amul.

 Yours faithfully,

Yasmin Banu, Abu Dhabi

 Sir ? The resignation of Verghese Kurien from the chairmanship of the GCMMF is sad. But it was an inevitability which he had kept deferring, may be out of love for his own creation. In fact, a voluntary farewell would have been more graceful for a man in Kurien?s position. It would have made it possible for him to avoid an ignominious end to an illustrious career. There is after all no point in guarding a post for long, especially when young and eligible candidates are waiting in the wings. The cooperative societies founded by Kurien might have been very close to his heart, but that does not mean that they too will be loyal to him forever.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Shyam Benegal?s film on Kurien?s white revolution was Manthan and not Nishant, as mentioned in the report, ?Hero Kurien scripts sad end? (March 21). Given that Manthan is more well known than Nishant, the error is even more surprising. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jaspreet Kindra, Cape Town

 Sir ? Even the best of milk, no matter how well it is pasteurised and preserved, will go sour eventually. It is ironical that ?India?s milkman?, as Verghese Kurien was known, found it difficult to accept this reality. He should have remembered the corporate adage: ?Leave when you are asked why you are leaving, not when you are leaving.?

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Great artists

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha ends his article, ?Man and his government?? (March 18), with a question regarding Ritwik Ghatak?s documentary film, Amar Lenin. He asks, ?Were the cuts demanded by the censor board made, or was Amar Lenin cleared regardless?? Perhaps I can throw light on some of the doubts of the author. The film was eventually passed by the censor board. Later, the existing communist bloc countries like Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia showed interest in buying it. But the then deputy prime minister, Morarji Desai, saw to it that the deal did not come off. Prodigal as he was and so in constant need of money, Ghatak later sold it to the Russian government. The amount of forty thousand rupees or thereabouts that he received went a long way in solving his financial difficulties of the moment.

 Yours faithfully,

Shrimonto Pathak, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is nothing new about the controversy which surrounded the conferring of the Padma Shri on Ritwik Ghatak. Such debates are generated by politicians from time to time to get some publicity for themselves. But this one brings to focus the need to judge an artist by his work and not by his professed political views. This is especially true of Ritwik Ghatak who had often been marginalized for his leftist ideology. Unless different versions of the truth are allowed to coexist in society, people will not be able to know what is right. At the same time, the recent cartoon controversy has emphasized once more that one can have the freedom to express one?s views only so long as it does not hurt other people?s sentiments. However, this is a complicated matter and creative men have often set their own standards of expression. Because society takes time to recognize the greatness of artists, they should at least be given the freedom to set their own criteria which might become the paradigm one day.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

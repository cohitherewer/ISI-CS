The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TRAIN TO NOWHERE 

 Indian Railways is not off the rails. This is evident from the budget presented by the Union railways minister, Mr Lalu Prasad. The numbers, somewhat incredible, are indisputable. In the first nine months of this fiscal year, Indian Railways has registered a performance which is a record. It is estimated that at the end of the fiscal year there will be a fund balance of Rs 11,280 crore. Last year, this figure narrowly missed the Rs 7,000 crore mark. The question that needs to be addressed is what has driven this remarkable performance? Some answers suggest themselves. First, the railways are enjoying some of the spin-off benefits of the growth that the Indian economy is experiencing. It is axiomatic that economic growth requires infrastructure of which railways are a critical element. It follows, therefore, that economic growth is bound to rub off on the fortunes of the railways. The relationship is reciprocal, at times even symbiotic. There is a second aspect. The rise in petrol and diesel prices has had less of an adverse impact on Indian Railways? performance, compared to the im- pact on road transport. This explains the increase in the freight revenue target from Rs 33,480 crore to Rs 36,490 crore.

 But these explanations beg one question: why hasn?t Indian Railways performed as well in the previous years of economic growth? This is where Mr Prasad can claim some credit. The performance of the railways is related in a profound manner to good governance. Mr Prasad and his team of senior officials recognized that within Indian Railways there existed pockets of unutilized resources which they have tapped. Better exploitation of resources has enhanced revenues, and, suddenly, the economic health of Indian Railways has acquired an unusually rosy hue. This, however, should not deflect attention from some fundamental issues that the present budget fails to address and the present performance successfully hides.

 Take the matter of cross-subsidization. The budget for 2006-07 announces a reduction in passenger fares at the upper end and no across-the-board hikes in freight rates. This means that passenger fares will continue to be subsidized by earnings from freight. This will mean that railway freight rates will remain uncompetitive when compared to road transport. Without the weight of the subsidy, the performance of the railways under the rubric of freight would be even better than this year?s performance. Populist strains echo in the concessions provided to farmers and milk-producers. These are all hangovers from the past. There is no sign in this budget to dismantle the behemoth called Indian Railways or even to reduce some of its monopolies which are not natural to the railways. In any case, the natural monopoly argument can only be sustained ? and that too to only a certain extent ? for the case of rolling stock.

 The railways may be chugging along at good speed but nobody quite knows, if the budget is any evidence, where the train is going.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MAIN PROBLEM

 It is not unusual in India for the more important issue to be obfuscated by irrelevant controversies. The leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party are hot under their collars about what they think the prime minister said about the Muslims. The prime minister and his office maintain that Mr Manmohan Singh did not mean what the BJP thinks he did. A large section of the political class is thus caught up in this who said/meant what debate. This is convenient for the politicians since it deflects attention from the fundamental problem concerning the socio-economic backwardness of Muslims in India. For reasons going back to the 19th century when modern education was introduced in India, Muslims have remained laggards in education. Over five decades of independence have not removed this backwardness in any significant way. The state has a role to play in this and that role cannot be the providing of quotas for Muslims in the sphere of employment. The state can play a positive role by making education more accessible to Muslims, especially those that belong poorest strata of Muslim society. The Sachar committee report notes that many Muslim children are unable to complete their primary and secondary education. This problem is, of course, not confined to Muslims alone. There are many other sections of society whose children are in the same plight.

 The prime ministers comments have been taken to mean that the Muslims have the first access to the states largesse, and others will follow. There are two points to be made in this connection. It has not been the policy of the Indian state to offer subsidies and quotas on the basis of religion. If Mr Singh is deviating from this policy, he should come through loud and clear instead of leaving room for ambiguity and misinterpretation. Second, at a more pragmatic level, the state does not have a great deal of largesse to dole out. After meeting all its commitments, the state has very little left over which it can divert exclusively towards the Muslims. Thus those Muslims who are poor and backward would be well advised to pursue education and then join the mainstream of Indian life, instead of waiting for the state to provide them with jobs. At the same time, there should be a pressure on the state to provide wider access to education. Education and overall economic growth are the best permanent remedies for backwardness.

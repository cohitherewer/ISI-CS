 A LITTLE TACT AND A SYMPATHETIC HEART

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 In certain cultures housework performed by young girls, the assistance provided by children in the fields...is not considered to be real work. Children are often considered to be the property of the family with only the parents able to decide whether they have to work, go to school or stay at home...Inspectors have therefore also to counter a large number of cultural beliefs and attitudes.

 There is also a lack of understanding of the inspectors role, suspicion of him or her as a prying outsider and fear that if their children are found to be illegally employed the parents themselves will suffer punishment. In such circumstances the inspector must rely on tact and powers of persuasion to win their confidence...and then take necessary remedial action. There is...widespread ignorance of the law often understandable because of its inconsistencies, and compounded by illiteracy among employers and workers.

 Indeed in the face of such obstacles it is necessary to assess whether the envisaged changes are acceptable to the social environment at that stage or whether they have to be spread over time with the initial emphasis...on raising the awareness of the public and training the key players. However, these are supportive actions that the labour inspector is not in a position to provide in isolation.

 A common problem for inspectors is also the uncooperative attitude of child workers themselves (often forced on them by their employers). The work provides them with an income, however small, and sometimes the chance to get some minimal training which, in the face of the alternative of inadequate schooling followed by unemployment, may well appear preferable. Mention has already been made of the undesirably resource-wasteful fragmentation of labour inspection, but this is often compounded for the inspector in the field by the absence of effective arrangements for cooperation...As a result, local labour inspectors may have no contact with those responsible for parallel... aspects of child labour, whether with the police authorities combatting illicit activities...or occupational health and safety specialist inspectors... and there will be no appropriate arrangements for coordination or information sharing. At worst there can be rivalry and competition, with each authority...leaving the problem to the other. And yet labour inspectors with their wide responsibilities and geographical coverage could so usefully be the eyes of the police, telling them of suspected illicit activities...

 TO BE CONCLUDED

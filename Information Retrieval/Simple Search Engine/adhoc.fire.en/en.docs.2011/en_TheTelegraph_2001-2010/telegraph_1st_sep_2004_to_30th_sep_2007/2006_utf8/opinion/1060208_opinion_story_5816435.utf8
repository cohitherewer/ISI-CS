The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 USE THE VOTE

 In India, polls and false promises go hand in hand. It is another matter that promises are mostly forgotten once the polls are over. For residents of a small town in Nadia district, a bridge over a river has remained an electoral promise for twenty long years. The people there cannot be amused that a minister of the Left Front government has now laid the foundation of the bridge two decades after a former legislator had done so. The event shows how power makes politicians cynical and insensitive to the people?s feelings. Yet, the leftists once cried hoarse over the ?Congress culture? of announcing welfare schemes on the eve of elections. Nearly thirty years in power have made the leftists as unscrupulous as other brands of politicians. The rush among Left Front ministers to lay foundations of development projects is aimed at skipping the Election Commission?s restrictions. Since the government cannot announce such schemes once the election schedule is notified, ruling parties scramble for buying votes with false promises.

 The attempt to fool the people is only one aspect of this election game. The larger story relates to the government?s ways that make development schemes slow, wasteful and disorganized. It is not always the lack of funds that delays the implementation of welfare projects. Crafty politicians, inept bureaucrats and work-shirking employees together make it almost impossible to complete projects on time. The cost is not just economic; the worst effect of such bunglings is the people?s growing distrust of all things associated with the government. Fortunately, the vote offers them a powerful means to express their anger. Whether they eventually get the bridge or not, the residents of the town in Nadia can use the elections in order to call the minister?s bluff. This may be their only hope of getting the bridge at all. People in some places often boycott the polls to mark their protest. That is hardly the right choice. Things can change only if they use the vote wisely.

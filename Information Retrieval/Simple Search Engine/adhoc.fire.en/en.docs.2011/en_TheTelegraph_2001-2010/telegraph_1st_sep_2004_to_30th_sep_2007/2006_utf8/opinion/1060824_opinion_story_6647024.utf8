The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOR A SONG

 There is something ridiculous as well as pathetic about senior political leaders getting mired in debates over banal non-issues. And since most of these happen in parliament, a sense of wasted time is also difficult to avoid. The latest Vande Mataram controversy involving Mr Arjun Singh, his party and some of their political opponents has all these features, apart from being of a singular order of mindlessness. The song is going to be hundred years old. So it had occurred to Mr Singh that schools all over the country should be made to sing it at a certain time on a particular day. Then he changed his mind and made the singing of it voluntary. This change went along with his explanation to an audience drawn predominantly from the minority community that choosing not to sing it, for religious reasons, does not amount to being unpatriotic. And this has provoked unsavoury rows in parliament, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party and Vishwa Hindu Parishad, about the blasphemous and minorities-appeasing nature of Mr Singhs allowances regarding the song.

 The whole affair is absurd. First, why should a ministry already burdened with the gravest problems, after the clearing of the quota bill, waste its time thinking about what individual schools could perfectly well work out for themselves how, when and why to sing the Vande Mataram? Second, why should the defining of patriotism be reduced to such a senseless and sectarian level of debate, which takes up so much time and energy in parliament? It is quite obvious that, in a free country, citizens ought to be free to express (or not express) their national sentiments in whatever way they want. It is only an immature, insecure and fractious democracy that turns such matters into earnest and endless controversy.

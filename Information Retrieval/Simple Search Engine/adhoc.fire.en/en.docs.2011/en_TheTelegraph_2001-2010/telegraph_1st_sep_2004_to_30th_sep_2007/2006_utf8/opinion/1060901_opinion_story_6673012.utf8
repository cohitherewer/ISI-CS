 BOYS OWN STORIES

Chocolate, and other writings on Male-Male Desire 

By Pandey Bechan Sharma Ugra, 

Oxford, Rs 395

 This is an important and unpleasant collection of short stories in Hindi. Their literary qualities, at least in Ruth Vanitas carefully functional translation, are unremarkable. But they are invaluable historical and sociological documents representations, from within, of the entire gamut of attitudes and energies that makes up the transition from late-colonial to modern Indian homophobia. In the elusive hybridity of its voices and allusions, in the richness of its ideological and unconscious confusions, in its depiction of everyday life in the north Indian cities of the Twenties, this collection will fascinate not only academic Queerists, but also many kinds of historians, sociologists and psychoanalysts. 

 The unpleasantness lies in the prurience and brutality of the writers mission (the uncovering and eradication of the unnatural vice of laundebaazi), and in the relentless physical and psychic violence playing the policeman that is always ready at hand in order to accomplish this mission. The beautiful painting on the cover Seva by Bhupen Khakhar of a tender regard between two elderly Indian men is misleading. These are profoundly ungentle, doomful stories, savagely afraid of erotic tenderness between men even while being repeatedly allured by its universality. Inspector Saheb, says the narrator in Kamariya Nagin Si Bal Khaye (Waist Curved Like a She-Cobra), beat those bastards a hundred times each with shoes! All of them are demons, devils in human form!

 Sharma a Brahmin from Uttar Pradesh and better known by his pen-name, Ugra (Extreme) wrote most of these stories between 1924 and 27 for a Hindi weekly, Matvala (Intoxicated), published from Calcutta with a Gandhian, nationalist and reformist agenda, under the editorship of the poet, Suryakant Tripathi Nirala. The stories were published as a single volume, entitled Chocolate, in 1927, all of them part of Ugras crusade against homosexuality. They immediately became part of a furious moral debate and controversy that went as far as the Mahatma. Gandhi read the stories and declared that their aim was pure: The writer only arouses disgust at unnatural behaviour.

 The best way into the ambivalence of the stories is in the title itself, Chocolate, with its promise of a dark and irresistibly foreign bitter-sweetness. In north Indian urban colloquial Hindi, the word stands for those innocent, tender and beautiful boys of our country, whom societys demons push into the mouth of destruction to quench their own desires. In the stories, these demons are usually well-educated older men from Benares, Allahabad or Lucknow who seduce boys with a combination of money and Wildean-Ghalibian wit, and then live out a doomed trajectory usually ending in death from consumption, suicide or violent disgrace. The punitive tone of this plot is unmistakably colonial and Victorian, a voice that remains alive today in Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. But the presiding geniuses of these seductions are none other than the best Hindi and Urdu poets of the times, their shers and ghazals interwoven with highly learned allusions to Shakespeare, Plato, Havelock Ellis and, most importantly, Oscar Wilde. Ugras 1960 novel, Phagun Ke Din Char set in Bollywood, where his career ended up reflects on the inner artist in Wilde as having digested everything heads or tails, straight or bent. The God who dwelt in him, writes Ugra, was the ultimate artist, Krishna.

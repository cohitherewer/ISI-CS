 Letters to Editor

 Lost and found

 Sir One should be thankful that three-year-old Anant Gupta, the kidnapped son of Naresh Gupta, the CEO of Adobe India, has returned safely to his parents. However, the childs return raises more questions than it provides answers to. Not only does the polices role in the case remain fuzzy, but Anants fathers position is also not clear. If the police had been keeping track of the abductors from the very beginning, then why did Naresh Gupta have to pay the ransom? Did the child return alone in an auto-rickshaw in the middle of the night, or was a policeman accompanying him? It seems that the police and the Uttar Pradesh special task force had kept Anants family in the dark about every development of the case. And when Anant returned at last, Naresh Guptas praise for Amar Singh, who is the second-in-command to the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, was also somewhat strange. Was the Samajwadi Party leader of greater help than the UP police? A special investigation should be commissioned to find out the facts of the kidnapping. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir That life in the National Capital Region is becoming more and more dangerous everyday is proved by cases such as that of Anant Guptas kidnapping. Anant was kidnapped just a few yards from his home in Noida while waiting for his school bus. The police are claiming to have played an active part in ensuring the childs return. However, certain questions remain mysteriously unanswered. Were the police in touch with Anants kidnappers? If not, how did they come to know of the house in Kakor where Naresh Gupta delivered the ransom? If it is revealed that the police were somehow working in league with the kidnappers, then people would despair of trusting the police again. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir It is heartening to know that the police used all their resources to make sure that Anant Gupta could return safely to his family. However, the very urgency with which the policemen carried out their task in this case makes one suspicious about whether they were working under pressure from superior powers. There are so many cases of kidnapping in India that remain unsolved because the police are strangely inactive. Naresh Guptas affluence and connections in the high places may have caused the police to put in an extra effort in this case.

 Yours faithfully,

 Real to reel

 Sir The report, Munnabhai magic gets PM too (Nov 18), was interesting since it indicates that a person as academically inclined and serious as Manmohan Singh, can also be influenced by popular culture. While the prime ministers reaction to the film is comforting, a commoner might have something to say about the scene in the movie that has so disturbed him. The scene involves the ordeal of a senior citizen in trying to get his pension without having to pay a bribe. Everybody is aware of and none supports the corruption that plagues every government department. At the same time, one gets a sense of poetic justice when one sees a former government employee being forced to cough up a bribe for withdrawing his pension. Most government officials take bribes for each piece of work they do. Many of them find themselves at the receiving end when they vacate their chairs. While it is normal to sympathize with the senior citizen shown in the film, one cannot help feeling that he has become the victim of a system that he must have encouraged while in office. However, people will thank the makers of Lage Raho Munnabhai if the particular scene inspires Manmohan Singh to take steps that will abolish corruption from India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The naivety of the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, never fails to amaze. Surely, he did not have to watch Lage Raho Munnabhai to know that almost all government officials are corrupt. The trouble that a senior citizen goes through in the film to get his pension would be nothing new to an ordinary Indian. In fact, by the time one is old enough to go for his pension, he knows only too well that he will not get the smallest work done without paying bribe. If, as Singh reportedly said, the very legitimacy of the state and its various institutions is brought into question by such illegal exercise of power and authority, then his state has long ceased to be legitimate. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir It seems that one can get away with any kind of indiscretion in India if he has money and power on his side. However, it would be doing injustice to Aishwarya Rais beauty and charm to say that she sails out of every muddle simply by virtue of her riches (Money? Not for me, honey, Nov 15). One flutter of her eyelids, and customs officials would be convinced that she has got nothing to do with the parcel containing 23,000 euros that arrived, bearing her address, from the Netherlands. Receiving more than Rs 5,000 in cash is an offence under Indian law and punishable with upto three years in prison. Besides, stuffing currency into parcels is the commonest way in which unauthorized currency is circulated all over the world. Since the law applies equally to everybody, Rai cannot get away without further interrogation. Not even if she is busy shooting in Jaipur. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

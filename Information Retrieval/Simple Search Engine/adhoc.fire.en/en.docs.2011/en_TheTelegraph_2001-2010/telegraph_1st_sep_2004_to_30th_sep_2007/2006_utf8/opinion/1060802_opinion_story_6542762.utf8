 Girls just wanna have fun

 Sir Parents across the country should join hands in protesting against the harassment of the three youngsters Yogita Khatwani, Bina Chowdhury and Imran who entered the premises of the prime ministers residence (Its no fun trying to meet PM, July 29). They did it for a lark, and they certainly do not deserve the punishment that has been meted out. It could have been any of our offspring there in that Hyundai Sonata, having a bit of fun. Children do make mistakes. But look at the girls now they have lost their jobs and their reputation as well (given the allegation of their being under Bacchus influence at the time of their foray). Although the breath analyser test has proved otherwise, the damage has been done and the stigma will dog them for a long time, considering their middle class environs. The lacunae, quite obviously, exist within the walls of 7 Race Course Road and this, the three have unwittingly exposed. The nation should, in fact, thank them for that. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ranjan Circar, Siliguri

 Sir The three youngsters held for driving into the compound of the prime ministers residence should not have been granted bail. There is no reason for the authorities to take the matter lightly. Besides, the three are also guilty of impersonation. The episode should be seen as a security failure. What is the use of the paraphernalia if unknown people can break into a security-barrier and then exit the same way in a casual manner? The matter would probably not have come to light had it not been for the coincidental presence of the media on the spot. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir It was stupid on the part of the trio to go all the way to 7 Race Course Road to meet the prime minister. Instead, they could have waited for the elections, when the prime minister and his partymen would have come to their doorsteps with folded hands. The prompt action by the employers of the two girls also suggests the difficulty of importing Western notions of democracy and civil rights into our feudal system. The insertion about the Australian prime minister that went with the report, Its no fun trying to meet PM (July 29), only added to the irony. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir A first information report has been lodged against the girls who went to visit the prime minister, but measures have not been taken against the security personnel on duty when the trio supposedly violated protocol. Now that it has been established that none of the youngsters was drunk and that there was no security breach, as the prime ministers office insists, why are the girls being accused of criminal trespass? The police and the special protection group are trying to find scapegoats to cover up for their failures. If there has been no security lapse, why didnt the PMO intervene when the girls were being interrogated throughout the night? The girls joyride has exposed the vulnerability of what ought to be one of the most secure residences in the country. It made a complete mockery of the cabinet security meeting which was in progress then.

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir How could the foolproof security arrangement at the prime ministers residence make it possible for the trio to enter the compound? In that case, terrorist could easily sneak in and seriously endanger the life of the premier. The security personnel responsible for the breach need to be punished. Only then can fingers be pointed at the trio.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Given the tight security ring around VIPs, Indians can only dream of meeting the prime minister now. Ignorant of the security protocol and law, Yogita Khatwani and her friends can be accused of misdemeanour, but certainly not of crime. They, in fact, caught the security napping. After turning their Sonata away from the reception, why did the security staff allow the car to leave the compound? Why did they not raise an alarm immediately? India cannot afford such slow reflexes, especially in view of the fact that the country is being targetted by terrorists.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The trios misadventure should refocus our attention on the rot that has set in among the countrys youth. Easy money and apparently glamorous careers have made young people bold and arrogant. For the likes of Khatwani and Chowdhury, ignorance is bliss. It is sad that an airhostess aspiring for an international career did not know that the prime ministers residence lies in a high security zone. Dont the young and ambitious read newspapers anymore? 

 Yours faithfully,

R.S. Chatterjee, Siliguri

 Sir There has been, undoubtedly, too much hullabaloo over the illegal entry of the young girls. But if the matter was brushed off, would that not have encouraged more youngsters to act in such a frivolous manner? The youth should have been suspended, not dismissed, from service.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Haldar, Calcutta

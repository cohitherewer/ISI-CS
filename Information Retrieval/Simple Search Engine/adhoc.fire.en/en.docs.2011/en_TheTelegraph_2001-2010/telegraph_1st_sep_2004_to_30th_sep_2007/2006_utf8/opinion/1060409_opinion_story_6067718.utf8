The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Flooded with problems

 Sir ? It?s been a year since the infamous Mumbai floods occurred, but nothing has been done to avert a similar crisis. With the monsoons fast approaching, Mumbai and its suburbs are in a vulnerable state. Parts of Colaba, Dadar, Borivili and Kurla have been dug up and the city still lacks a proper disaster management system. It is unfortunate that a government which talks of turning Mumbai into Shanghai has not managed to fix the city?s drainage system yet.

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Mumbai

 Without a heart

 Sir ? The death of Balaram Ghosh, a cardiac patient who died unattended on a street in Bhowanipore, clearly shows how insensitive the people of Calcutta have become (?Collapsed on road, patient robbed of chance to live?, April 5). Even as Nag lay on a busy road struggling for his life, hundreds of men and women passed him by, without bothering to take him to a hospital. If any one of them had shown a little bit of concern for the sick man, his life could have been saved. It is sad to see that people are so caught up with their lives that they cannot even spare a few minutes to help a dying old man. 

 Yours faithfully,

Devashis Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Dinesh Das, a student, had helped save the life of an ailing postal employee a few months ago. But the recent death of Balaram Ghosh proves that the people of Calcutta have not learnt anything from this good samaritan. While Das, who hails from a rural background, had come to the rescue of a dying man, Polly Karmakar, a resident of Calcutta, decided to attend to her chores even after seeing Ghosh writhing in pain. This makes us wonder whether living in a city has deadened our senses completely. People in the metropolis hardly have any time for anybody but themselves. 

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? Calcutta has always prided itself on its warm and friendly population. It is ironical that no one came forward to help Balaram Nag at his hour of peril. What was even more shocking was the fact that someone had even thought of robbing the dying man of the money he was carrying. This incident has surely put another blot on Calcutta?s face. A city that was once sensitive has now become a hard-hearted metropolis, full of selfish people and devoid of humanity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Fuel for thought

 Sir ? A railway electric locomotive drawing five megawatts of power may seem expensive to R.C. Acharya at first, considering the power crunch in India (?Power to the tracks?, March 29). But it is easier to build stronger electric locomotives than diesel ones for running goods and passenger trains. Electric locomotives are faster than those which run on diesel, and the cost of diesel is higher than electricity. So, despite the initial expenses, electric locomotives should be preferred to diesel ones.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? R.C. Acharya?s preference for diesel locomotives in the face of Indian Railways? drive for electric trains in trunk routes shows a lack of concern for the environment. At a time when the whole world is striving for a cleaner transport system, Acharya is advocating the use of diesel for locomotives. His theory might have some merit from the economic point of view, but it will only heighten global warming and increase diesel prices.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattcharjee, Calcutta

 HUMOURING THE ENIGMATIC OTHER

 THE CALL OF THE WEIRD: TRAVELS IN AMERICAN SUB-CULTURES, 

 By Louis Theroux, Macmillan, $ 17.99

 Louis Therouxs debut book is an engrossing account of Americas sub-cultures. From gangster rappers and porn-stars to neo-Nazis and the Christian right, a host of Americas fringe groups comes alive in this delightful book. Humour informs most of the narrative, but gradually it starts interrogating the very notion of the weird. 

 Since 1994, the author has been interviewing these cranks, dreamers, bigots and narcissists, and making a BBC series on them called Louis Therouxs Weird Evenings. This book grows out of his decision to plunge once again into their shadowy world for an update. The book is simple, and not a psycho-analytical or sociological discourse. A very simple human curiosity fuels the quest.

 Our imagination is stretched to its limits as we read, for instance, about a UFO-believer claiming to have stained ten aliens. He sees himself as a saviour of earthlings from malevolent extra-terrestrials, whom he dismisses as lousy creatures; their only merit being their superior technology. He claims to know how to remove devices implanted in humans by aliens, and believes other such absurdities that form the basis of his existence. 

 At the other end of the spectrum, we have the white Christian neo-Nazis spewing venom. They consider non-whites as sub-humans and have a pathological hatred for Jews, whom they accuse of hijacking the American state apparatus. There is a mother of twin daughters who has initiated them into a cultural hatred for all that is non-white. Between these extremes, jostle various groups with their own idiosyncrasies people in the pornography business or gangster rappers. 

 Incidentally, most of them are into illegal activities. But the authors most admirable quality is that he is never judgmental. He is simply amused or peeved and, at times, exasperated. Rather, he tries to come to terms with weirdness and find a human face, even a fleeting one, behind peoples hatred, violence and seemingly absurd beliefs. For, how can one situate the real person in a neo-Nazi who, despite a visceral hatred of Jews and a lurking suspicion of the authors Jewishness, helps him retrieve his missing laptop? 

 Shocked and amazed as he is, the author can neither dispense with these people nor accept them, but a sense of self-doubt and a disdain for all established truths make him pronounce, We are instruments for feeling, faith, energy, emotion, significance, belief, but not really truth .

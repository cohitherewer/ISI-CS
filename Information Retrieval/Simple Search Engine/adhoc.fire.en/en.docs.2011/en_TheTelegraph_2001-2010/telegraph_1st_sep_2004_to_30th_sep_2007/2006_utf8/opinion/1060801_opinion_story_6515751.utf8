 PICTURE OF INDIFFERENCE AND NEGLECT

 In a place as idyllic as Tamenglong, the mood is that of cynicism and despair. Only lately has the government pitched in with a few schemes. But Anchita Ghatak wonders if it is too little too late

 I am in Tamenglong, up in the hills in Manipur. An idyllic setting. As I type, there are singing voices from the church filling the air. God?s in his heaven and all?s right with the world, we would say. One could not be further from the truth. The hill districts of Manipur are home to Naga people of various tribes. A very large number of them dream of a united Nagalim, a homeland for all Nagas. The Nagas of Manipur feel they have been given short shrift by the government of India. Added to this is also the feeling that the Meiteis rule Manipur. Nagas explain that Meiteis are disproportionately represented in the state legislature and corner whatever advantages may be had.

 The town of Tamenglong is 150 kilometres away from Imphal. However, a car ride from Imphal to Tamenglong can take as long as 7-8 hours. Most parts of the NH 53 are in an abysmal condition. I wonder what happens at the Border Roads Organization in Manipur. We associate the BRO with wonderful roads in the most impossible places. But Manipur is perhaps forgettable.

 Other than awful roads, the drive to Manipur is characterized by an immense presence of the army and paramilitary forces. We have heard a great deal about how the armed forces have let loose a reign of rape, murder and torture in the north-eastern states. Encounters with the patrols on the drive to Tamenglong from Imphal will only strengthen the view of the armed forces as boorish and uncivilized.

 There are 12 checkposts on the way from Imphal to Tamenglong. Some are manned by the army, and some by para-military forces. We were travelling in a jeep belonging to a missionary organization. This vehicle does the Tamenglong-Imphal-Tamenglong drive several times in the week, mostly driven by the same man, a Naga. You would think that the men at the checkposts would know most things about this vehicle and the activities it could possibly be involved in. Well, let me tell you a few things.

 There were five of us in the jeep...three Indian women and two Naga men. Everytime we reached a checkpost, the men had to get out of the car. The women could continue sitting in the car. The driver had to go to the checkpost window and get his documents checked. In the meanwhile, one or more soldiers would wander to the car and begin questioning us in Hindi. The questions would go something like this:

 Where are you going? Where are you coming from? Why are you going? What do you have in the car? Are you carrying anything suspicious?

 One of my colleagues asked a soldier whether we would have told him if we were carrying anything suspicious / dangerous. She invited him to check the vehicle. He said that he trusted us. We were coming up against a checkpost every half an hour or so. The briefest halt was 15 minutes. I wondered why the Indian army had not thought of setting up simple wireless communication between the checkposts. If one checkpost cleared us, they could communicate our details to subsequent checkposts, and we could be waved on. It would surely be an efficient way of doing things and save harassment to civilians.

 Apparently, it would seem that the army and para-military forces have been stationed in Manipur to keep lawlessness at bay. However, we hear many, many stories of how there is no governance, politicians have unbridled power and villagers become pawns in battles among various insurgent groups. ?What about the army?? I asked. ?Can?t they protect the villagers??

 The locals looked at me with pity. ?Poor mainland innocent,? they must have thought. They explained that the uniformed men of the army and the para-military organizations go back to the safety of their camps when darkness falls. The members of the various political groups can go about their business undeterred. The ordinary citizen is wary of venturing out after dark. Interesting example of democracy in action, I think.

 In our conversations in Tamenglong, we hear about this innovative phenomenon of ?teacher substitution?. Government schools appoint teachers against sanctioned posts. Apparently, only candidates from the Manipur valley, more often than not, living in Imphal have the requisite qualifications and are appointed as teachers. However, they don?t fancy living a hard life in the hills of Manipur. They would like to continue with their lives where they are. In consultation with the school authorities, local politicians and whoever else, the government appointee chooses a woman or man from the hills to take his place. The actual appointee continues to live in the valley and draw a teacher?s salary, from which a fraction is paid to the substitute, and another bit paid to keep certain powers happy. All the people involved in this game of substitution gain. Are any of us na?ve enough to ask about the students?

 Certain students? organizations involved in the struggle for a united Nagalim have come up with a new strategy to add fire to their struggle. They have decreed that students studying in classes VIII, IX and X, in private schools in the hill districts, under the Manipur board, need to switch allegiance to the Nagaland board. Representatives of these student organizations marched upto heads of schools and handed over piles of books prescribed by the Nagaland board. ?Distribute these books immediately, and start teaching them,? they ordered. Concerned about the plight of their students, teachers and heads of schools tried to engage these student organizations in discussions. They pointed out that one could not abruptly change from one board to the other, questions of examinations had to be sorted out, students of Class X would be very badly affected and so on. ?That is your problem,? said the student leaders. ?We have brought you the books. You teach them.?

 Heads of schools are frightfully worried about their students. They know that flouting of the orders of the students? organizations can lead to an outbreak of violence including murder. They keep trying to reason with the students? organizations, and are also having meetings with the deputy commissioner, parents and students of their school. Talks are apparently on with the government of India too on this matter.

 I wonder where Tamenglong fits into the Indian government?s picture of an industrialized, globalized India. A very small part of the district has been electrified. However, supply of electricity is erratic. Even in the district headquarters the power supply can go off for two weeks at a time. Running water is a luxury few in Tamenglong town can even dream of. The district hospital is barely functioning. The primary health centres exist only in name. Some just have a chowkidar on its rolls and nothing or nobody else to its name. The roads connecting the district headquarters to the rest of the district are pathetic. Some villages can be reached only on foot. Public transport too is almost non-existent.

 There is huge cynicism and despair in Tamenglong. There are no jobs to be had, and the feeling is that government jobs will go to the Meiteis anyway. Power is with the legislators, sundry other politicians and the UGs, or underground activists. The UGs are young men in army fatigues, ostensibly owing allegiance to the idea of Nagalim, thinking through the barrel of a gun, engaged in factional battles and terrorizing the young, old, men and women. There must be women UGs too, I think. However, during my brief visit, I did not hear a single reference to them.

 Naga women can be seen everywhere, walking miles to fetch firewood and determinedly going about their many tasks. Children have to be fed, the old and sick need looking after, shops have to be run, cloth needs to be woven. There are church duties to do, and self-help group meetings to attend. There is very little time to think about the hopelessness all around and look for solutions in alcohol or the barrel of a gun.

 Nature in the hill districts is awe-inspiring, but there is no tourism. The general feeling is that the government needs to think about the hill districts if tourism is to be encouraged. To attract tourists, you need to have basic minimum infrastructure. Also, if more and more people were to come to Manipur, the truth about government indifference and ineptitude would be out.

 Amidst the litany of corruption, violence and apathy, I occasionally hear notes of hope. There are some Nagas in senior administrative positions, the BRO has begun repairing sections of the highway, people are getting job cards and even work, under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. However, I wonder, whether this is too little too late. After all, people are entitled to all this and much more. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act still looms large over Manipur, and there does not appear to be any well-thought-out plans to set right the many wrongs that are continually being done.

 Profitable business

 Sir ? The Centre?s unwillingness to act upon the president?s suggestions on the office of profit bill shows that our politicians have little respect for the president?s good offices. The president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has no option but to sign the bill if it is sent to him for a second time. But what he can do is refer the same to the Supreme Court for its opinion under Article 143 of the Constitution. This would shame the government even further as the apex court is likely to support the recommendations made by the president. Moreover, the Election Commission has already started acting on the petitions of disqualification against members of parliament and legislatures whose names figure in the office of profit list. Therefore, if the president were to put his signature on the bill now, it would pour water on the efforts of the EC. As for the allegation that the president is sitting on the bill, one can safely say that Kalam is known for doing his paperwork quickly. While the president has put the nation before himself, our leaders have shown a clear preference for personal gains.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The decision to send the office of profit bill back to the president in its original form is a slap on the face of democracy itself. It is a pity that our leaders chose to ignore the objections cited by the president in order to save members of parliament threatened with disqualification. Politicians should remember that the president returns a bill only in exceptional cases and his views should be respected on occasions like these. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? When Jaya Bachchan was forced to resign as an MP on grounds of holding an office of profit, the left parties welcomed the decision. When Sonia Gandhi had to resign on similar grounds, the communists hailed it as a great sacrifice. But then it came out that a number of left MPs were also holding on to such offices of profit. Then, the left first tried to argue that the posts being held by their MPs could not be termed as offices of profit. Next, they forced the Congress and its coalition partners to introduce a bill that would exempt these posts as offices of profit. The president has since returned the bill without signing it, saying that he has serious reservations about this piece of legislation. Now the leftists have prevailed over the government to send the bill back to the president so that it becomes an act in the near future. By refusing to acknowledge the presidential censure, the left parties have only dishonoured the highest office of the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, has returned the office of profit bill after raising certain valid questions, which need to be addressed in the interest of the nation. However, it is unfortunate that bill will now be sent back to the president without any modifications and the president is bound by the Constitution to sign it this time around. This only goes to show that in our country, neither the politicians nor the political parties are concerned with the welfare of the people. Our elected netas can even go to the extent of undermining the authority of the president to have their petty interests fulfilled. I hope that Kalam does not bow to the unreasonable demands of the politicians. Instead, he should resign from his post and show that he is a selfless man who doesn?t care for the trappings of power and position.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The imbroglio over the office of profit issue is another instance of the government reneging on its legal commitments to appease members of the left parties in both the houses. Unfortunately for the left, the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam saw through this devious game and refused to be a party to this nefarious act. And now pressure is being applied on him to put his stamp of approval on the bill which was sent back to him without any alterations. Perhaps it would be a good idea for Sonia Gandhi to start looking for a presidential candidate from her friends in the left so that the next president after Kalam remains a supplicant to the whims and fancies of the Congress-left alliance.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? I arrived in Mumbai from San Francisco on July 12, 2006. While still at the airport, I had to make a call to my friend?s cell phone in the city. Since the only phone booth at the airport had no cash facility, I was forced to use my credit card to foot the bill. Later, when I checked my credit card statement, I was shocked to find that I was charged $28 (more than Rs 1,200) for one call which lasted not more than a couple of minutes. It is disappointing to find people trying to take advantage of others the moment they set foot in their home country.

 Yours faithfully,

 STRANGE WAYS OF FAITH

 THIS ABOVE ALL - 

 Khushwant Singh

 Holy company

 You must have often wondered why religions, as they are practised today, are so completely different from what their founders had hoped to make them. The founders had all preached love, understanding and respect for people of other faiths; their followers emphasize their own uniqueness and look down upon and even wage wars against those who do not worship their gods.

 Many theories have been propounded to explain the degradation of religion but one of the latest and most perceptive that I have come across is Murad Ali Baigs Reflections in a Sacred Pond (which I first saw in an earlier incarnation as Tyranny in Sacred Colours: An Inquiry into the Paradoxes of Indias Mythology, Religion and History.

 Murad does not question the importance of faith but outlines how religions have been altered by the vested interests of the professional priests of all religions. He especially outlines the impact of this on India, and how distortions, religiosity and superstitions crept into all religions, especially into Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism as they are practised in India.

 He analyses the five participants in the practice of religion: the founder prophets, apostles, priests, rulers and the rich who became the patrons of religion and finally the common people who were persuaded to make offerings and sacrifices to insure themselves against the uncertainties of the future in life and the afterlife.

 Murad takes the reader on a fast Bharat darshan tour from its hoary past to the present, from the early societies of hunters, nomads and cultivators to the more urbane, civilized city life, the Aryans and their religion, a thousand years of Buddhism, revival of Brahmanical Hinduism, the impact of Islam, the Bhakti movement, the impact of Europeans and the spread of Christianity as well as the attitudes towards religion in post-independence India.

 In this bewildering change of scenes, one thing comes clear: in order to preserve their separate identity and assert their superiority over other faiths, the preachers of all religions understood that hate is a much stronger emotion than love. They practised it in the past: they practise it today.

 Cedra is no more

 On the airmail envelope, the senders name was different. Also, my name and address were not in the handwriting I was familiar with. I was reluctant to open it as I feared the worst. My fears were not unfounded. Cedra had been writing about her deteriorating health. The first line read, I am writing to tell you Cedra died yesterday. My heart sank. I looked at the entries on October 26 in my diary to see if there was any indicating premonition that my friend in France was dead. There was none.

 The letter said Cedra would be cremated (she was agnostic) at Chateavroux on October 27. I looked up entries on October 22 in my diary. There was nothing for me to construe that Cedra was now an urnful of ashes. All the talk about telepathy, mystic communication and hunches is hogwash. Here were two people writing to each other once every other week over 60 years and nothing told me that our communication was ended for ever.

 The letter was from Cedras son, Damon Osborne. I met him in 1947 when I was staying with Arthur Lall, ICS, in Knightsbridge, London. Cedra was companion-cum-helper to Arthurs wife, Sheila, and their daughter, Tookie. Cedra had separated from her husband soon after Damon was born. She had conceded custody of her only child to her husband and was on amicable terms with him. He brought Damon, then barely a year old, to see his mother. He was a tall, blond-bearded man. Damon clung to his father. What I never forget is his calling his father Mummy and refusing to sit on his mothers lap.

 Cedra was a British beauty moulded like Britannia: large forehead, shock of hair, full-bosomed and well-proportioned open-air type as they say. To see her was to love her. My friend, Prem Kirpal, had her photograph in his mantle-piece till the end of his days. We got on famously because she was also warm-hearted. I continued to see her after I moved into lodgings of my own. When Arthur was transferred to another post, Cedra joined Annigoni, a famous Italian portrait painter (I am not sure if I have got his name right), who was commissioned to do a portrait of Queen Elizabeth. Cedra picked up Italian and went under the Italian appellation, Chedra. We kept up a desultory correspondence. She married a second time, another Englishman, Andrew Castellian. It was no more successful than her first. She retired and bought a cottage in the Woods in Central France, named Mourieres in Crevant. Our correspondence became regular, at least one letter every fortnight. She worked on translating Baudelaire into English and sent me her translations in bits and pieces. She wrote about birds and squirrels that visited her gardens, difficulties of running her home and pains of ageing. I wrote to her about the books I was churning out: Whenever she went to London, she bought what she could find in a bookshop which stocked Indian publications. One was found under her pillow after she died. I was moved to tears. At the end of his letter, Damon wrote a few lines of verse which I presume were composed by Cedra as they seem to sum up her views:

 Make no tomb or catacomb for me

 Nor broken column, cross nor 

 bleeding heart,

 Instead, in my memory

 Place a free beer dispenser in the park.

 When in Canada, ride a cab

 An insertion in a Canadian newspaper: If you are a heart patient and travelling in a taxi, then you neednt worry because 90 per cent of taxi drivers are Indian doctors.

 SLOWING DOWN

 The last inflation figures are for the week ending July 29 and show an inflation rate of 4.61 per cent. This is inflation as measured by the point-to-point wholesale price index and is a dip compared to 4.67 per cent for the preceding week, but higher than 4.16 per cent one year ago. The decline is primarily because of cheaper food. While the actual level of inflation is a function of the index used and items included in computation of the index, there is a consensus that annualized inflation is now around 5 per cent, the Reserve bank of India having projected a band of 5 to 5.5 per cent. Onion prices may have led to government downfalls in the past. But 5 to 5.5 per cent is within the politically acceptable band. The key question is whether inflation can be held there, and there are two reasons for concern. 

 First, increases in global crude prices have an inflationary impact, although this is presently muted because of political inability to transmit high crude prices onto increased domestic prices of petroleum products, with adverse consequences on subsidies and profitability of oil companies. Second, there has been a sharp increase in money supply. The RBI projected a 2006-07 money supply increase figure of 15 per cent. Since the real gross domestic product growth figure is 7-7.5 per cent and inflation projection is 5-5.5 per cent, the M3 increase projection is only about 2 percentage points above nominal GDP growth and would have been fine, had it materialized. But till July, M3 growth has been 19.5 per cent. Such increases have only been seen in 1976, 1978 and 1994 and come on top of a liquidity overhang in the system. Several issues arise. First, M3 growth has been due to increased bank credit to the commercial sector, increase in net foreign exchange assets of the banking system and larger bank credit to the government. Per se, these are indicators of buoyancy. But the levels are unsustainable and may get worse. The government borrowing will accelerate, there will be greater corporate demand for loans as investments materialize and there is no reason for foreign capital inflows to reverse. 

 Second, come October, interest rates are bound to rise. Not only has the recent RBI policy hinted at such a change, there will be sectoral concerns about speculation, inflationary expectations and asset price bubbles (such as real estate), as well as higher interest rates by other central banks and desire to counter capital flight and rupee appreciation. Third, such an inevitable interest rate hike will adversely affect growth. The attempt by North Block to dictate interest rates charged by public sector banks can hardly be regarded as a serious attempt at policy-making. The proposition that there will be immediate transition to capital account convertibility is also suspect. But on the growth-inflation trade-off, since recent growth has been driven by consumption expenditure and investment increases, both sensitive to interest rates, a growth slowdown seems imminent.

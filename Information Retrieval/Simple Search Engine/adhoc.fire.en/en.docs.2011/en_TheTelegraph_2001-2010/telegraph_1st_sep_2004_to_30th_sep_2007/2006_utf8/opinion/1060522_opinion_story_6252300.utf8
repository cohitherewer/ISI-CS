 NO COMPRENDO

 The American Senate seems to be somewhat confused about what it would like to do with the English language. It has recently voted, 63-34, to designate English as the ?national language? of the United States of America. But the Senate has also approved, on a 58-39 vote, a slightly watered-down alternative to this proposal, declaring English the ?common and unifying? language of the nation. Of course, which of the two survives would be decided in negotiations with the House of Representatives. But the making of a political issue out of language, together with the slight fuzziness in the thinking, is an interesting way into the conservative American psyche. It should be noted that English has not been made the ?official? language, which would have had significant functional implications about how non-English-speaking Americans would understand American ?bureaucratese?, and the extent to which the latter would be obliged to make itself intelligible to the former. There is still confusion about how this would affect existing laws regarding mandatory multi-lingual intelligibility on the part of the State. The notion of English as the national language also denies anyone the right to ask the government or any of its representatives to ?act, communicate, perform or provide services or provide materials in any language other than English?. It would also determine how much English, and knowledge of mainstream Anglophone American culture, immigrants would have to demonstrate in order to get US citizenship.

 At stake here is, of course, what the American government does with its immigrants. Hence the problem of language is closely intertwined with issues of border security, illegal immigration and Mr George W. Bush?s ?comprehensive? vision of immigration reform. Balking at the idea of the US national anthem being sung in Spanish by its Latino citizens ? several thousands of whom had recently taken to the streets all over the country to boycott the economy for a day ? Mr Bush was concerned that his country should not lose its ?national soul?. For him, the unity of that soul seems to be guaranteed not only by god but also by the English language.

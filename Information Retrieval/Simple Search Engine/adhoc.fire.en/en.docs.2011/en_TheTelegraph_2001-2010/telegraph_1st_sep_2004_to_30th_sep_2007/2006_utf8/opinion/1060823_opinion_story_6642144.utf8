 THE NATIONS NOT FOR SALE 

- What the PM had to say on the Indo-US nuclear deal 

Diplomacy -K. P. Nayar

It is tempting to look at the substance of Manmohan 

Singhs reply in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday to the discussion on the Indo-US 

nuclear deal and, in the process, forget that the prime ministers handling of 

the nuclear controversy in recent weeks represents a turning point in Indias 

political evolution. For half a century, or at any rate for four decades after 

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehrus death, successive executives on Raisina Hill have dealt 

with Indias elected representatives in both Houses in the adjoining Parliament 

House as rubber stamps or worse. Singhs comprehensive approach to civilian nuclear 

energy cooperation between India and the United States of America, outlined on 

Thursday, and his unambiguous assurances in the Rajya Sabha on that day will be 

remembered by chroniclers of Indias democratic conventions and traditions for 

the manner in which the prime minister restored the dignity and role of parliament, 

the erosion of which was ironically wrought by his own party.

Last Thursday was also a landmark because of the way 

the left parties conducted themselves in parliament, and outside in the run up 

to the Rajya Sabha discussion. This made it possible to have a substantive engagement 

between the executive and the legislature on an issue which will have a lasting 

impact on Indias standing in the world. In a demonstration of the maturity of 

the Indian political system, once Singh offered to clear the doubts about his 

deal with George W. Bush, the left parties acted with uncharacteristic responsibility, 

which allowed the prime minister to fulfil his part of the bargain. The country 

is better off for this.

The events leading to Thursdays outcome have demonstrated 

that professionals can, indeed, play their part in securing the countrys future 

even when the quality of elected representatives leaves much to be desired. The 

scientists who individually and collectively took their firm positions on the 

pros and cons of the nuclear deal as it was evolving after the US House of Representatives 

vote in June have seen to that. 

The result of all this is a clear message, which was 

overdue in the environment after Bushs visit to India in March: India is not 

for sale. It is hard to tell who is more disappointed by this message. There were 

those abroad who thought that India could be bought and many in India who banked 

on being able to sell out the country. If Bush ever thought of calling out to 

the prime minister Yo Singh (as he did to Britains Tony Blair at the St. Petersburg 

G-8 summit, which the world heard on account of an open microphone), he will now 

have second thoughts on that score.

On Monday, the first full working day in the August-holiday-bound-Washington 

after the Rajya Sabha debate, this columnist and several others in the media who 

write about strategic issues received a document entitled an Update on the US-India 

Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. The author of the update, a friend for more than 

a decade, is also one of those leading the fight in Washington to kill the Indo-US 

nuclear deal.

His e-mail update expressed amazement that the strenuous 

opposition within India to the proposed US-India nuclear cooperation agreement 

is perplexing to those who have concluded that the US Congress and the Bush administration 

have been extraordinarily generous to India. The extent of Washingtons generosity 

has now been called into question by New Delhi.

At the root of the problems that are now confronting 

the Singh-Bush deal, which was full of good intentions on both sides on July 18, 

2005, is the conviction, even among some decision-makers in Washington, that the 

right to be generous to other nations on issues like nuclear power is the divine 

right of the worlds sole remaining super power. In fact, it is precisely this 

attitude in Washington, which is putting Irans back up and making it that much 

more difficult for a proud civilization like Irans to make any compromise on 

the nuclear question.

This attitude is reminiscent of the question that 

Helen Thomas, the doyenne of White House correspondents, used to repeatedly ask 

Bill Clintons spokesman when Clinton let it be known that he wanted to visit 

India. Thomas used to ask: Why are we rewarding the Indians with a presidential 

visit after they tested a bomb? Rewarding India? With a visit by a US president? 

Decolonization is no longer a political issue, but it continues to be a behavioural 

issue in Western capitals.

The prime minister must be trusted not only because 

of the sanctity of his solemn commitments made to parliament, but also because 

of the significance of some of his references to the US that are unrelated to 

the nuclear issue. Because the issue on the table on Thursday was the nuclear 

deal, it was lost on the nation that Singh revealed in the Rajya Sabha that he 

plainly told Bush in New Delhi in March that the US invasion of Iraq was a mistake: 

I said India does not find favour with regime change.

Such a statement has a significance that goes well 

beyond Iraq. There are well-respected, well-informed people in the US who believe 

that Israels bombing spree of Lebanon was a dress rehearsal for a similar US 

attack on Iran with the intention of regime change in Tehran. Without saying it 

in so many words, Singh has let it be known that India is not for any change in 

government in Tehran through force from without. The Americans want to overthrow 

Bashar Assads government in Damascus too. With his statement against regime 

change, Singh has implicitly rejected an American dmarche, which called 

upon India to end energy-related collaboration with Assads government in Damascus.

A source of major concern in recent months has been 

the nagging chance that India may agree to the Washington-initiated Proliferation 

Security Initiative to physically interdict ships and stop the spread of weapons 

of mass destruction. New Delhi has come under increasing pressure from the Bush 

administration to join the initiative. Giving in to that pressure could have meant 

that one day India would have been required to board a Chinese ship carrying missile 

parts to North Korea, for example, putting the two countries on the road to a 

conflict. The prime minister said in the Rajya Sabha not only that there was no 

linkage between the PSI and the nuclear deal, but also that the government has 

examined the PSI. We have certain concerns regarding its legal implications.

At the start of the discussion in the Rajya Sabha, 

there were fears that the governments credibility would be at stake. But by Thursday 

night, the biggest casualty was the credibility of some leading opinion-makers 

and strategic analysts, for whom anything that was spun out of the US embassy 

in Chanakyapuri and the state department in Washington was the gospel truth. Repeatedly, 

in pause after pause during his reply, the prime minister confirmed what these 

spin doctors for America were attempting to challenge and discredit. 

Other developments too may have helped the prime minister 

in regaining the traditional balance in Indian foreign policy. In recent weeks, 

Iran has demonstrated, through its subtle moves, that New Delhi needs Tehran much 

more than the other way round. At the same time, the war in Lebanon has once again 

shown the limits of overwhelming force, a lesson for both Israel and the US. While 

Tel Aviv and Washington digest the meaning of this lesson, Singh has decided that 

he has room for greater manoeuvre in foreign policy.

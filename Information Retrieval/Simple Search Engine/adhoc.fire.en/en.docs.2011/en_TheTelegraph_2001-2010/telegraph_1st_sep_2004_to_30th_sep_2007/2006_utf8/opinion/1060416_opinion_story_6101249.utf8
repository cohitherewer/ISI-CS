The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Who would have thought that 10 Janpath would lose two of its most integral members to that troublesome cluster of Constitutional words, ?office of profit?? But it?s true. As soon as Sonia Gandhi passed the ?oops? (the office-of-profit scandal, silly!) test with flying colours, she decided that if she was not going to hold any official post, she would not use the services of any ?government? employees either! And that?s how Messrs SV Pillai and PP Madhavan, Sonia?s additional private secretary and officer on special duty respectively, were sent packing to their parent employers, the PMO and the home ministry. The duo were the middle- and lower-rung Congress leaders? gateway to Madam, and in the process of organizing appointments and looking after the family?s parliamentary constituencies, Pillaisaheb and Madhavanji had emerged as major power brokers. In fact, many claim that Pillai played a major role in the ouster of K. Natwar Singh. But if you thought only the Congress president had Central staff working for her, hold on. George Fernandes has DN Mishra working for him, but the latter draws his salary from the Union agriculture ministry, headed by Sharad Pawar. It was Pawar, apparently, who had sent Mishra on a deputation to Fernandes?s residence. 

 While both Pillai and Madhavan had enough media-savvy, journos on the Congress beat would rather not say the same about the media cell of the AICC. It has spent over two months without a chairperson, and the three spokespersons are known to be busy with their own agendas. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, according to journos, has a soft spot for the BJP, Jayanti Natarajan is hardly ever there, and Rajiv Shukla, the new entrant, would rather dabble in the politics of cricket and the press club. Is there anyone who can brief the press about what?s happening inside the party please?

 There is no reason to think that the few politicos who were spotted at the Wills Lifestyle Fashion Week are the only fashionable souls roaming the corridors of power in Delhi. Take the BJP?s deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, V.K. Malhotra, who is advised on his attire and looks by no less a person than Ritu Beri. Malhotra had met the designer at a do he had organized as the chairman of the Sports Council of India. And ever since Rituji said she thought that the saffronite would look rather dandy in a jacket, Malhotra hasn?t stopped turning up in jackets bearing the Ritu Beri label.

 The pallor of saffron continues to grow. And now, the reasons are travelling from across the seas. The Overseas Friends of the BJP, the sangh parivar supporters in North America, who have always been generous with their funds for the Hindu cause, has suddenly been dissolved by a fiat from the Central office of the BJP last week. The reason: too much bickering within the organization, with each faction leader claiming proximity to some saffron leader or the other. A small problem, though. Who now will host the elders of the parivar on their trips to Amreeka?

 Two out-of-work politicians seem to have finally found solace in each other?s company. The Samajwadi Party MP, Raj Babbar, and the former prime minister, VP Singh, are launching a campaign against power brokers and dalals. While both have associations with the socialist movement, Babbar has played some thoroughly dislikeable characters on screen, while VP Singh has tried to eke out an alternative career as a painter. Last heard, the UP CM, Mulayam Singh, upset with one of his comrades, had pledged support to Babbar amp; Singh.

 Till the other day, Congressmen knew that Sonia Gandhi was going to file her nomination for the Rae Bareilly seat on April 18. But no, madam is not going to do the paperwork on that day, no matter what her astrologers say. And why? Because it is the birthday of her son-in-law, Robert Vadra. BJP supporters might be unhappy to know that like any Indian mother-in-law, Sonia treats her son-in-law as she would her son, and would not miss his birthday for some silly election formalities.

 No mahajot, no alliance? Not when didi is around. She has got as many as eight parties in her alliance, but how many Trinamoolis know all their names? Keep guessing.

 It is difficult to make out whether everything is alright with George Fernandes, given that he sported a dishevelled look and crumpled khaddar kurta even in his defence ministerial days. But since the fall of the NDA, things have not been going well for George. Sharad Yadav, several years his junior, pipped him to the post of JD(U) president with the help of the Bihar CM, Nitish Kumar. But for every leader left in the wilderness, there is always hope in the form of Mamata Banerjee. Fernandes has been close to didi ever since she left the Congress, so it is no wonder that, faced with an unsure future, Fernandes too flew down to a certain house on Harish Chatterjee Street, as Purno Sangma had done some time back. But Fernandes is also reported to have sounded out Mulayam Singh Yadav. Who will get the old socialist warhorse in the end?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DEATH WARDS

 Apart from their control over the political, and now economic, destiny of the state, West Bengals ministers have reconciled themselves to certain facts of life a pestilential woman-led opposition to a dream project and the shame that goes by the name of healthcare. To both they usually react with the same impassive countenance. The news of a threatened dharna thus affects the government as little as the spiralling figures of the dead in the citys only referral hospital for children. The latter, more frighteningly regular than the oppositions activity, has even assumed the status of a phenomenon. The state heath minister, Mr Surya Kanta Mishra, chose to describe the recurring deaths in the B.C. Roy Memorial Hospital in Calcutta as a periodic occurrence of multiple deaths only a few years ago. Nothing has changed since then. Children die every day in the hospital, and in large numbers on certain other days when they cannot escape the accumulated sins of an uncaring medical administration. For the state, this is most normal as normal as dengue to flare up after the monsoon, spurious drugs and blood-testing devices to be supplied to government hospitals. It is also as normal for women to deliver babies under trees outside hospitals and animals to carry away newborns from hospital beds. 

 For most of these non-events, the government and its health ministry should have hung their heads in shame. But it is also most normal for that not to happen, especially where the chief executive takes upon himself the task of lightening the burden of responsibility of a non-performing member of his cabinet. There can be no denying Mr Mishras argument that the children going to B.C. Roy hospital are serious. That is precisely why they are taken there by their parents whose financial condition allows them no better option. It is for the administration to provide them the care they need. It is inexcusable when it repeatedly fails to do so, particularly when it has substantial funds at its disposal to ensure the requisite infrastructure. There is no greater anomaly than a hospital dealing with serious patients not having a life-support system in place. This one still has no intensive care-unit, ventilators or alternative power supply, and will perhaps continue without these while the children keep dying in vain.

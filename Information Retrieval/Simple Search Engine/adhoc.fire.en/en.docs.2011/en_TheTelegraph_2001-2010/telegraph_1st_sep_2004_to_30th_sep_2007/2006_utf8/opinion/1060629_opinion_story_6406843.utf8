The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HONOURABLE FIGHT

 The year is 1994, and Shahnaz Bokhari, a clinical psychologist in Pakistan with a zeal for social reform, arrives at a hospital to see Zainab Nur. She faints when the blankets on Nur are removed. Nur?s husband had inserted red-hot irons into her private parts for complaining against his abuse to her friends. Bokhari ? in her two-decades-old fight to give shelter, medical help and justice to such victims of honour crimes through her Progressive Women?s Association (founded in 1985) ? was to witness more such horrors. There were faces completely disfigured by acid, exploding stoves that seemed to show a peculiar fondness for the female genitalia, and women forced into dementia by repeated rapes. Such brutality is not typical of Pakistan alone, nor of Islamic societies. They occur in Turkey, Britain, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Bangladesh, Morocco, Sweden, Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran ? in fact, the world over, where traditional patriarchal societies try to keep their control over women?s sexuality. And the communities require no religious sanction for that. It is as much a feature of Islamic societies as of other cultures ? Hindu, Sikh and some in sub-Saharan Africa. Recent reports show a growing incidence of similar crimes in India, particularly in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, where the caste factor has come into play.

 The United Nations reports that 5,000 women fall victim every year to this custom. But it is difficult to get accurate statistics on it because such crimes, often justified as ?crimes of passion?, frequently go unreported. States have an ambiguous role where honour crimes are concerned, often reducing punishments for the guilty. Even where there is strict legislation, as in Turkey, the practice continues uninhibited. 

 There are not many like Bokhari, who take up the cudgels on behalf of the silent victims of such violence. Her organization has been locking horns with the government for burn centres, for laws against domestic violence, for changes in rape laws. Let us hear it from her.

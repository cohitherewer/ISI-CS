The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIFFERENT TAR

 People campaigning for a particular cause are prone to blindness. Their obsession with the cause often leads to a warping of perspective. The most classic example of this is the recent statement of Ms Medha Patkar, in which she equated Mr Narendra Modi to Mr Manmohan Singh. The former was responsible for the communal killings in Gujarat, and the latter?s actions would lead to death and starvation in the name of development. Apart from the unfairness of the comparison, there is something wrong with the logic of the statement. The statement proceeds from the assumption of death. Communal riots in Gujarat led to the loss of life of thousands of Muslims; and the Narmada dam will also result in the death of those who will lose their homestead and livelihood. Therefore, the man responsible for one is no different from the person responsible for the other. On the face of it, this sounds very persuasive. There is one factor to consider, however. Those who will be dislocated because of the dam and thus lose everything have the opportunity to campaign, by themselves or under the leadership of Ms Patkar, or anybody else of their choice, for rehabilitation and compensation. Cynics might argue that such a campaign will be useless, but they will admit that such a possibility exists and in a democracy it can be used and even maximized. A pogrom, like the one Gujarat witnessed in 2002 and over which Mr Modi?s government presided, by definition does not provide such an opportunity. The victims of a pogrom are in no position to demand rehabilitation and compensation. Death holds out no possibilities. In projecting her cause and in giving vent to her anger against Mr Singh, Ms Patkar has overlooked this simple fact.

 This is an unpardonable oversight for more reasons than one. First, it seriously underestimates what actually happened in Gujarat. Men and women were killed, and were thus left with no choice. Second ? and this oversight is somewhat surprising coming from Ms Patkar ? it assumes that those affected by the Narmada dam are bereft of agency. This reduces them to helpless victims. These people are still alive and are thus in a position to make a choice which might include a gamut of options ? from appeals for rehabilitation to protest. Ms Patkar?s movement has been made possible and has been sustained by the agency of these poor people. To disregard this is to fall into a cosy elitism which is utterly unbecoming of Ms Patkar.

 Ms Patkar has reasons to be angry and reasons to despair. But she has no reason to forget history. She also has no reasons to equate a politician implicated in the murder of thousands in the name of religion with another who, for all his faults, believes in democracy. All foes, Ms Patkar should know, are not equal, neither are all friends.

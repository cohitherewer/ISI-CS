 Grand failure

 Sir ? It is not fair to blame Mamata Banerjee for the failure to form a grand alliance against the Left Front in West Bengal (?Failing the test?, Jan 31). The simple truth is that the Congress high command is not at all serious about fighting the left in West Bengal. Banerjee?s siding with the Bharatiya Janata Party and therefore the National Democratic Alliance is often used as an excuse to avoid building up a genuine anti-left alliance. If the BJP is considered communal and therefore untouchable, is the Congress being virtuous in allying with the communists who have a record for their anti-nationalism both before and after independence? Banerjee has been, time and again, asked to leave the NDA as that may help her get Muslim votes. But will that ensure a secular ideology in the state? If the main issue in this state is a change in Left Front rule, then it is immaterial whether a compromise has to be worked out with a communal or non-communal party.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Mahajots, as conceived by Mamata Banerjee, will remain a dream in Bengal if opposition parties continue to look at their own interests instead of that of the state. In any case, a mahajot which is merely an anti-Left Front coalition without any concrete ideology is doomed to fail. And a mahajot which, in all likeness, will be an extension of the Trinamool Congress is even worse. Thankfully, no such arrangement could be worked out for the polls. A negativist coalition, even if elected, would spell doom for West Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It was Mamata Banerjee who was responsible for promoting disloyal men like Subrata Mukherjee and Sudip Bandyopadhyay. Both became larger-than-life figures and a threat to Banerjee. Although in politics there are no permanent friendships or enmity, it is unlikely that the rapprochement between Banerjee and the two men will take place soon. The failure of Banerjee to form a mahajot can be attributed to the Trinamool leader?s failure to look beyond her nose. Had she been less myopic, she would have broken her failed alliance with the saffronites and joined hands with the Congress, which has a sizeable section from her own party. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Pranab Mukherjee, the West Bengal Congress chief, takes great pride in his proximity to the Nehru-Gandhis and is always keen to identify himself as a Delhiwala. An outsider to Bengal?s politics, Mukherjee has little feel and understanding of the Bengal electorate. Had it been otherwise, he would not have decided to field 294 candidates in the ensuing assembly election. This would invariably mean a division of votes in the opposition camp and would allow the Left Front reap dividends from the fractured house. Mukherjee?s insistence that the Trinamool chief, Mamata Banerjee, severe ties with the NDA before an alliance with the Congress could be formed, is a move calculated to thwart the forming of a mahajot of anti-left parties (?Pranab asks party to go it alone?, Feb 6). Mukherjee knows that the assembly elections in Bengal will make no difference to his cushy position in the Central cabinet. In Karnataka, the Janata Dal (Secular) of H.D. Kumaraswamy, which fought the BJP in the assembly election, has now tied up with the BJP to win the chief minister?s chair. Why should cross-party alliances be so difficult in Bengal despite the fact that at the grassroot level the BJP and the Congress are running civic boards? If Mukherjee does not relent, the people of West Bengal will not be able to dislodge the Marxists. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I cannot agree more with the editorial, ?Use the vote? (Feb 8). The Left front has won the assembly elections in West Bengal for the past thirty years and people have given up hope for any change. There is no doubt that the value of ?democracy? has been severely truncated during the Left Front administration. Empty promises by unscrupulous political leaders, like the one to build a bridge over the river in a small town in Nadia, have become a common feature of pre-election India. All this, together with the opposition?s antics and failure to come together in the form of a coalition, is enough to make one lose interest in the political game. But a disenchanted electorate would assure an extended left rule. The only hope is to throw the left out and this can happen if the opposition can work out a seat-sharing arrangement. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, Ohio

 Dishonour

 Sir ? It is not true that the great legendary vocalist, Rajeswari Datta, wife of poet Sudhin Datta, died without leaving anybody in her family close enough to receive a posthumous honour on her behalf, as it appeared at a function of the All India Radio at Kala Mandir on February 2 (?Rare tapes from radio archives?, Feb 3). In fact, exactly five months ago, I was visited by a representative of AIR who selected three photographs of my aunt, Rajeswari, from our album and took them to have one of them featured on the CD which, we were told, was to be released by AIR. We were promised that we would be invited during the release. But the promise was dishonoured. This is unethical and such carelessness goes against our culture, which was of the highest esteem to both Rajeswari and Sudhin Datta.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kanakendra Nath Datta, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 A job half done

 Sir ? This year?s budget was presented with the economy on an upswing, which gave it an opportunity to focus on investments in infrastructure and the rural sector, both of which are key areas in controlling growth (?It?s the economy, stupid!?, Mar 1). The finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has laid emphasis on the social and rural sectors. There has also been a significant reduction in customs duties and revenue, which will help to make up for the fiscal deficit. Life insurance and pension plans play an important role in mobilizing long-term savings. Keeping this in mind, Chidambaram has removed the exemption of Rs 10,000 in pension funds, thereby allowing senior citizens to save upto Rs 1 lakh. This would definitely boost people?s confidence in making long-term savings, which can then be utilized in building infrastructure. The finance minister must also be thanked for the excise relief to small cars that should go a long way in making India a leading market in the automobile sector. 

 Yours faithfully

 Sir ? P. Chidambaram has tried his best to please his coalition partners in his budget. But, as is often the case with such attempts, the finance minister has failed to live up to the expectations of the common man.While the reduction in the price of food items is a welcome move, the price hike of edible oils will inconvenience the middle class. Cheaper computer hardware ought to boost computer sales, but packaged software becoming dearer can very well give a fillip to software piracy. One also wonders at the wisdom of reducing the price of small cars ? especially when our roads continue to be in a deplorable state.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? One of the failures of this year?s budget has been its inability to simplify the direct tax structure. Additives of surcharge and cess will ensure that the tax-structure remains as confusing as ever. If the government wants to increase revenue, why should it shy away from increasing basic tax-rates and do nothing to remove the confusing additives? Likewise, P. Chidambaram has done nothing to make the system of postal tariffs more organized. Moreover, the finance minister has displayed his cunning rather than his ingenuity by raising service taxes from 10 to 12 per cent while making a show of not increasing income tax.

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The finance minister ended his budget speech by quoting Swami Vivekananda. But I think that he has failed to grasp what Vivekananda meant when he said that so long as millions live in hunger and ignorance, every man who has been educated at their expense, and yet pays no heed to them, is a traitor. P. Chidambaram?s budget will be found lacking when judged in the light of this sagely comment. This budget strives to please the middle class, which can now afford small cars and enjoy their soft drinks, ice-creams and pasta without feeling the pinch in their pockets. But the poor have gained little from this budget. Chidambaram has given some relief to farmers under the new loan scheme. But there is still some doubt whether this measure will really help people from the lower income groups. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The finance minister?s budget speech as well as his proposals reflect the insensitiveness of the ruling elite. The suggestion to include automated teller machines within the service tax net, in particular, defies all logic. At a time when the State Bank of India is encouraging its customers to access the ATM for withdrawing money, the finance minister has decided to impose a tax on the service. This will surely discourage customers from enjoying the fruits of the revolution in information technology. 

 Yours faithfully, 

N. Dey, Chennai

 Sir ? The budget will surely bring a smile on Sonia Gandhi?s face. Very soon, there will be kiosks selling pasta at every nook and corner because P. Chidambaram has exempted this Italian staple from excise duty. Worse, the prices of almost all commodities are bound to go up because of the hike in service tax rates. If there is to be a budget that will please ordinary Indians and also bring in revenues for the government, then Lalu Prasad Yadav is the man for the job. The railway minister has shown what he is capable of while presenting the railways budget.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? On every budget eve, P. Chidambaram is heard lamenting that Indians are found lacking when it comes to paying taxes. However, he has done precious little to force corrupt officials to cough up black money. India figures prominently in the global corruption index and the police and politicians are largely to blame for this. The government must now take tough measures to tackle corruption and strengthen the exchequer. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Chattopadhyay, Calcutta

 Money for missiles

 Sir The allegations against George Fernandes, Jaya Jaitley and Sushil Kumar prove once more just how corrupt the Indian political class has become (Missile mud on Fernandes, Oct 11). If the three are guilty, they should be given exemplary punishment since nobody has the right to abuse public trust and to misuse public money in selfish pursuits. Besides, this is not the first allegation against Fernandes. It is a shame that politicians, and important public officials such as the former naval chief, are so busy fulfilling their narrow ends that they have no time for the country and its people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soumya Mukherjee, Naihati

 Sir The investigations against George Fernandes are a witch-hunt by the ruling party. Fernandes has already been unsuccessfully accused of acquiring coffins and ammunition at exorbitant rates to benefit a particular supplier. The Congress has refused to consider the ground realities created by the unanticipated Kargil war and has excavated the irregularities in the Barak deal after so many years to settle scores. War does not wait for the essential supplies to be procured at leisure, following all the strictures in the rulebook. Moreover, Fernandes had got the approval of the military top brass before clinching the deal. It was singularly unfortunate for Fernandes that his position as defence minister obliged him to take certain emergency decisions. And now, when he is out of power, he is being put under the wringer time and again. If this becomes the fate of a bold minister, nobody in the future will dare to take a risky decision, even under pressing circumstances. The military and civilian hardware being purchased by the present government, with enormous sums of money, may likewise put todays ministers in trouble later. What India needs is a foolproof procedure for buying military equipment and ancillaries from other countries. The mud-slinging by turns brings no credit to our political system.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The report concerning the controversial purchase of the Barak anti-missile missile system throws up an interesting fact. The Barak was supposedly purchased to counter the Pakistani Exocet and Harpoon missiles. The Barak system is developed by Israel and the Harpoon missile system by the United States of America. Further, Israelis have long claimed that the Exocet missile is a licensed copy of the Israeli missile system, Gabriel. All of this implies that while India and Pakistan are busy engaging each other in meaningless conflicts and an expensive arms race, their Western benefactors are laughing all the way to the bank. If hostilities continue in the subcontinent, it will only benefit the US and Israel. It is time the people and the leaders of both India and Pakistan realized this.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is not only unfortunate but also shameful that, after being netted by the Central Bureau of Investigation, George Fernandes chose to hold the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, primarily responsible for the Barak deal since Kalam was the scientific advisor to the then defence minister. The weakness of an individuals character is evident in the manner in which he evades blame. Whatever else he may be accused of, Kalams integrity and commitment to the nation is above suspicion. Moreover, with his 1999 letter to Fernandes, pointing out the deficiencies in the Barak missile system, being made public, the former defence minister has no option but to tender an unqualified apology to him. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir George Fernandes, since the days of the Janata Party government in the Seventies, has led a public life which has been scandal-free. He has never been accused of possessing assets disproportionate to his income. One wonders what went wrong with a man with such spotless credentials. What makes things worse is the dragging of the presidents name into the matter unnecessarily. A fair investigation must be conducted to bring out the truth.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 Sir There is no room for doubt any more regarding corruption in our defence establishment. It is unfortunate that our national security is compromised repeatedly for satisfying the selfish interests of a few powerful individuals. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir The Barak drama is reminiscent of the Tehelka disclosures which also put Samata Party leaders under the scanner. However, while the army has been quick to take action against those indicted by the S.K. Jain committee, the political establishment has obstructed and dragged the investigations against the politicians. And why are politicians in power never found guilty, but only those unseated? The CBI must be empowered to deal with corrupt politicians while they are in power. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LIMITED BY LAW

 In a state where shalishi courts run by affiliates of the ruling party decide the fate of rape victims and adjudicate property disputes, it is not surprising to find another organization overstepping its judicial limits. The West Bengal state womens commission has been ticked off by the Calcutta high court for trying to settle the grant of maintenance for the complainant in a matrimonial dispute the commission had been overseeing. According to the court, such matters can be dispensed with only in the criminal or civil court in accordance with the law. It has been made clear that the legislation, under which the commission has been formed, grants no such authority to the statutory body. The high court judgment is unlikely to bring good tidings for the commission, which, by its own admission, has been able to do very little till now towards assuring women equality in treatment and opportunity, and thus end discrimination. Now, the commissions inability to bring prompt relief to the victims of gender injustice may further discourage the few who approach it to circumvent the inordinately lengthy, and often confusing, route through the courts to undo a wrong.

 The problem for the state womens commission is not unique though. Most state or Central commissions, even those dealing with human rights, have the right to review existing laws, recommend remedial legislative measures, advise the government on policy matters and facilitate the redressal of grievances. They can act as civil courts while hearing cases and do all that is necessary to expedite the course of justice. But they cannot assume the role of the judiciary in actually delivering that justice. There can be no doubting the logic behind this arrangement. However, in a country where an overburdened judiciary, an often intransigent executive and subordinate state organizations fail to act in unison, it can be a hellish situation for those seeking fairplay. For the plight of the aggrieved to be redressed, more sensitivity and promptness are required at the institutional as well as the individual levels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SO MANY OTHERS

 Indians, it appears to Mr Swraj Paul, are taking over London. But he adds in the same breath that they might get into trouble with the British Nationalist Party. Mr Paul is reacting here to the latest figures on Londons demography published by the Office for National Statistics in Britain. They reveal that in 2006, a third of Londoners were born abroad, and among them Indians make up the biggest contingent. There is an infectious glee in Mr Pauls relishing of this robust, even vengeful, reversal of history. Food, films, fiction: India seems to have become the perfect antidote to native British blandness. Bollywood, tikka masala, the Pauls and the Mittals have come to embody for Britain that vibrancy, creativity and enterprise which have made, to a great extent, its capital city the mongrel wonder it is today, more-or-less proudly. Yet, why mention the BNP too? 

 There is, unfortunately, a Britain outside London especially Messrs Paul and Mittals London. Two nearly simultaneous events precede the statistics offices figures, and qualify their implications. First, the acquittal, last Friday, of the BNP leader, Mr Nick Griffin, from charges of inciting racial hatred. He shifted, quite effortlessly, from publicly describing Islam as this wicked, vicious faith to speaking of Asians as muggers, rapists and cockroaches who need to be shown the door. Most significantly, when asked whether he was a racist, he replied that he was no longer one, and that he is now a religionist. On the day Mr Griffin was cleared, the MI5 chief, Ms Eliza Manningham-Buller, insisted publicly that she knew of 30 major terrorist plots in Britain and suggested, using patently unreliable surveys, that 100,000 British Muslims supported last years London bombings. An irrepressible religionist tension informs the celebrated racial or ethnic multiculturalism of British society. This is the emergence of a new kind of intolerance, ignorance, incomprehension and even hatred, where religion and culture become implicitly identified with race and ethnicity. In this, establishment figures like Ms Manningham-Buller and, more obliquely, Mr Jack Straw, so politely anxious to look the Other in her face, differ in degree and not in kind from the obscene incitements of Mr Griffin. A Britain that is thinking of spending unprecedented billions on identity cards for every British resident is certainly feeling something more complicated than joy at being taken over so inexorably.

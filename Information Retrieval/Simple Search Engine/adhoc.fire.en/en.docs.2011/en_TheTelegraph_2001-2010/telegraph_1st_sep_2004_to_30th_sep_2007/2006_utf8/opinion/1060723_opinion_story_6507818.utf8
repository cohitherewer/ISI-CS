 Dented pride

 Sir ? The ?pulses scam? in the army goes on to explain why India ranks so high in the corrupt perception index. It appears that the army is fast becoming a refuge for the corrupt, the reason being that it is easy to get away with the crime in the defence establishment. It is ironic that high-ranking officials of an institution, which prides itself on pursuing ethical standards, has been caught participating in nefarious activities. Perhaps a crash course in accountability and fair-play would help the army retain its former glory. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Taking a nap

 Sir ? The recent bomb blasts in Mumbai and the massacre of over thirty people in a state-run camp at Errabore in Chhattisgarh have left ordinary Indians unsure about the efficiency of the security forces defending the country. The security agencies have failed to chalk out a proactive strategy to counter the threat posed by militants. This is evident from the fact that the Maoist attack came only days after the blasts in Mumbai, indicating that the terrorists are much more professional than the securitymen. 

 A number of steps need to be taken to thwart such strikes in the future. For instance, the blame game between the police and intelligence agencies needs to stop. Security agencies must learn to cooperate with each other and take steps to cover the loopholes in the present system. In this context, one must mention that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, was right in saying that India?s intelligence network needs to be upgraded. It is time the government did something to secure citizens from the spectre of terror.

 Yours faithfully,

Anita Subba, Singtam, Sikkim

 Sir ? The slaughter of Salwa Judum supporters in a supposedly ?safe? camp in Chhattisgarh proves that the Maoists do not hesitate to kill poor, defenceless villagers for whom they are supposed to be fighting in the first place. The latest attack should serve as a warning to all the states affected by the Maoist menace. Unless the governments, both at the state and the Centre, find a way to tackle the extremists, there will be no end to the bloodshed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar, Berhampur

 Parting shot

 Sir ? In ?The right distance?, (July 17), S.L. Rao correctly states that privatization cannot solve the problems of loss-making public sector units. The root of their trouble lies in inefficient management. However, there are exceptions as well. The Indian Railways is a publicly-owned company controlled by the government of India. It?s strong performance proves that a joint public-private partnership can be beneficial if it is handled properly.

 Joint management can also help recover the sinking fortunes of a company. Jessop was a loss-making venture,before it was handed over to the Ruia Group. At the same time, it would not be correct to assume that privatization always improves the performance of public sector enterprises. In a mixed economy like India, the public sector is often burdened by its accountability to the parliament on the one hand and to the bureaucracy on the other. Moreover, multiple controlling agencies often keep the senior management on the defensive. Hence these enterprises are loathe to conduct experiments to increase productivity, thereby causing a dip in profits.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

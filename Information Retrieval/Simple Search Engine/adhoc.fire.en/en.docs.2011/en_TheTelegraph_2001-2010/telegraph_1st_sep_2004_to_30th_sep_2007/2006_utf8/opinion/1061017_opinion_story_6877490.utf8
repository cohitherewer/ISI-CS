 LET DOWN BY FRIENDS

 Shashi Tharoors case has exposed the lack of coordination between the external affairs ministry and the PMO, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 The man who knew too much?

 So why is it that India just loves kicking a man when hes down? Consider the facts: Shashi Tharoor, Indias former candidate to one of the worlds most high-profile public jobs, that of the United Nations secretary-general, lost to South Korean minister, Ban Ki-Moon, two weeks ago, because the US vetoed his case in favour of the latter. Robert Blackwill, a former American ambassador to Delhi and considered close to the Bush administration, especially to Condoleezza Rice, told me that the United States of America tipped the balance in favour of Ban because South Korea is a treaty ally of the US. Moreover, he implied, the US was not about to help another UN civil servant into the top job after it saw how Kofi Annan had, in his very suave and sophisticated way, given the Bush administration such bad press, especially over Iraq.

 So Shashi Tharoor, fluent in English and French and a handful of other languages, writer of many books, a fulltime UN-wallah for nearly three decades, including stints in peace-keeping, and in the runup to the war in Iraq a special assistant to Kofi Annan which means he knows almost everything there is to know about how and why George Bushs massive ego promoted the destruction of one of the worlds oldest civilizations, although headed by a secular dictator lost, perhaps, because he knew too much.

 On the other hand, Ban is inarticulate at best. He will impassively nod his head when South Koreas treaty masters, the good Americans, want one thing or another, and knowing John Bolton presently US ambassador to the UN and a key member of the Bush-Cheney team who has announced that he wont allow the UNs bleeding-heart morality to come in the way of Americas imperialism it will be both things, at all times.

 Ban can also be fully trusted to keep his counsel when he disagrees with Bolton. Shashi Tharoor, on the other hand, even a speed reading of his novels on Nehru and India will tell you, would also have acquiesced (after all, who can deny the almighty Americans?), but he would have also tried to defend the rest of the underdog world in a Gandhigiri sort of way.

 Still, the fact remains that the Americans never promised India, at any stage, that they would support Tharoor. In the end, the treaty ally won the day. After all, South Korea has 3,600 troops in Iraq, second only to Britain. India, however strong its desire to be a natural ally of the US, proudly disdained to send any.

 Despite the US, then, Tharoor managed to get Russia, France and Britain on his side. There was one no opinion, in the count, possibly China. He got double the votes won by the president of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, a good friend of the Americans, and he performed much better than Thailands deputy prime minister. By all accounts, Tharoor performed creditably. And yet, when he lost, instead of the nation mourning an Indian citizen who had failed to make the grade, the national press went after him like a thirsty bloodhound.

 Truth is, Shashi Tharoor lost not because of the Americans, but because the Indian establishment didnt quite know what to do with the mans candidature. Instead of mounting a worldwide campaign that would have been worthy of India Shining, officials and politicians were hugely at cross-purposes at what they had to do.

 First of all, even though Tharoor first got none other than the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, as well as the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, on board, the traditional rivalry between the ministry of external affairs and the prime ministers office undercut his candidature.

 The fact that the MEA did not have a foreign minister at the time meant that the required political push was absent. Narayanan campaigned for him at his level, and so did the former foreign secretary, Shyam Saran (under whose watch the contest was entered), but the fact remained that there was hardly any coordination between the two beats.

 Perhaps the MEA was miffed because the PMO seemed to be calling the shots on every occasion. It is no secret in Delhi that the MEA and PMO have disagreed hugely on every major issue, including Pakistan and the US. In Tharoors case, he went to the PMO when he wanted in, he called the prime minister in South Africa (then on a bilateral visit) when he decided to withdraw. According to Tharoor, that was the only proper and courteous thing to do, but the MEA was clearly upset it wasnt told first.

 It didnt help that the prime minister never called even one Permanent Five leader on the phone, not once, asking for support for Tharoor. And therein lies the rub. The fact that the MEA has remained politically headless for so long has encouraged bureaucratic groupism at Indias expense.

 If India had had a foreign minister, he might have been able to paper over traditional rivalries and differences that are bound to arise in any high-profile candidature such as this one. But since the Congress has been internally riven, first over Natwar Singhs Iraq indiscretions and then over Karan Singhs continuing Nepal tangle, the impression of a headless body that squabbles over big-ticket items, and how to deal with it, hardly adds to Indias profile at home and abroad.

 The point is that the MEA was hardly as convinced about Tharoors candidature as it remains about the Indo-US deal. With the latter, both New Delhi and Washington have burnt the midnight oil at both ends and got every other mission in every Nuclear Suppliers Group country on the job. Once all sides in the Indian establishment agreed on the nuclear deal, New Delhi decided to show the world what it could do with America, by running a tightly focussed campaign on the deal. With Tharoor, though, there was precious little coordination.

 It was a failure at the highest level. Indias redoubtable foreign office, considered among the best and brightest in the world, could not sell the nuclear deal and Tharoor to America at the same time, because it could not resolve its own differences on the latter.

 At the end of the day, if the US vetoed Tharoor, it is Indias failure, not Americas fault. Both the MEA and the PMO and the prime minister as foreign minister should realize that if we had worked together, if Tharoor had won, then India would have won. Kicking a man when hes down, in this case Shashi Tharoor, only adds to the national ignominy.

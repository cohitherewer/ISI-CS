 By Brian Clinton amp; Richard Mulvaney,

 Funtastic Limited, Rs 995

 David Beckham is among the best known names in the world today. The surname rings more bells than those of kings or prime ministers, politicians or authors. Even filmstars have lost out to him in popularity polls. Beckham is not merely a footballer. He is much more than that. The game of football may have been his dream, his career, his means of advancement and even his official profession. But football does not represent his total life. At the moment, he is bigger than the game, a living legend, an icon to millions of people around the world, many of whom are not even acquainted with the game of football.

 So why is David Beckham so popular? Surely not just for his footballing skills. There are many players far superior to him on the football field. Is it for his handsome face and toned body? Or is there a magical appeal in that gorgeous smile of his? His popularity extends far beyond the world of football, which as it stands, is big enough to envelop the globe.

 This book is a pictorial album conceived by Lucie Cave, a journalist who thrives on writing about celebrities. This self-confessed gossip columnist devotes only a few pages to Beckham?s footballing career. Instead she concentrates on his activities off the field. The coffee-table format is ideal for the fabulous photographs, many of which are rare and show the footballing hero in different guises.

 Cave?s book is a visual delight although the text is not always reliable.The author, like the rest of her ilk, has the habit of exaggerating facts and deviating from the subject under discussion. In a short chapter on family life, Cave?s blinkers have resulted in the author omitting the reported dalliances of this superstar footballer. Beckham, according to Cave, is an ideal husband. It is doubtful if Beckham?s publicity managers would be able to improve on this.

 The pictures are the main attraction of this book. They should be, in a book like this one. The text is just there to add to the flavour. The chapter headings too are specific ? style icon, celebrity, model, humanitarian, public figure and hero. The man has been depicted in his various roles with some impressive use of the camera lens.

 While on Beckham, we tend to think of him primarily as a sports personality. This, Cave announces, is a mistake. We must accept the man as he is. If he is an elegant player on the soccer pitch, he is also kind and understanding with orphans and physically challenged kids. He is an advertisement model one moment, an ambassador the next. If he is easy with presidents, he is as affable with crowds. His is a brand name that sells products. He is a creation of the contemporary marketing world. The media has created him and millions around the globe have fallen to his charm. The Beckham magic, undoubtedly, has cast its spell on all age-groups. Therefore, Cave states that the footballer should not be judged by his soccer skills alone. In fact, his importance should be judged by the fact that the face of David Beckham has achieved a lot of success in different spheres over the years.

 In a similar vein, Don Bradman is another name that sells. Even 60 years after his retirement, no other cricketer has been able to achieve comparable marketability as this Australian great. Ever since he left his rural background and entered city life in the late Twenties, his stupendous achievements in cricket have always been exploited by the commercial world. He himself made use of his own fame to gain financial security and quite rightly too. But, ironically, other people made a fortune by manipulating the great man?s name and reputation.

 While still in his prime, an anti-Bradman lobby was formed among his own team mates. Cricketers like Victor Richardson (Greg Chappell?s maternal grandfather), Bill O?Rielly and Jack Fingleton were Bradman?s chief adversaries. They wrote against him in articles as well as in books and stoked numerous controversies. The arbitrary accusations did not unseat or ruffle Bradman, but helped these men to gain fame and fortune.

 Bradman?s name became associated with numerous marketing undertakings. Souvenirs were sold in his name for which he received no royalty. Even today, books on Bradman are getting published under various pretexts. Some authors have brought forth new angles to the age-old controversy like the Bodyline Series. Others wrote books claiming certain quotes to be his last words that he did not want to publish during his lifetime. Museums, libraries, and even restaurants have cropped up in his name although neither he (in his lifetime) nor his nominees (after his death) benefited in any way. Bradman?s popularity is such that the name spells money for those who are able to exploit his reputation.

 This book comprises sketches and paintings of Bradman and is the work of Brian Clinton, an Australian painter of international repute, who had spent hours with the genius to capture the essence of the man. Clinton has done an excellent job. This exquisite book, a coffee-table title by modern usage, is a collector?s item. The cricketer?s life is depicted in the pictures with the use of prose to substantiate the story of his eventful life. The authors have stayed away from all the relevant controversies.

 The primary focus of the book is on the illustrations. Every aspect of the cricketer?s life has been documented in detail. The cricketer?s boyhood days, his early years in the cricketing world, his family life, his domination of world cricket, his life as a businessman, his days as a cricket administrator and so on have all been projected admirably. For every cricket lover, this is a book to keep and to gloss over.

 BUSINESS OF WORDS 

 Wordcage 

 - Stephen Hugh-Jones 

 I google, you google, he googles, 

 we all google. Or do we? Not if Google has its way. The 

 owners of that incomparable search engine dislike its (and 

 their companys) name being used as a verb; or, worse, in 

 connection with any rival search engine; or, worse still, 

 without a capital letter. They have written to sundry media 

 saying so. And theyve been jeered all over the Web.

 Their motives are entirely reasonable. 

 If your trademark becomes the generic word for some class 

 of object (or, in this case, a process), you may feel justifiably 

 flattered, but you risk losing its value as a trademark. 

 Indeed, you may lose the right to enforce it as such.

 Many words have gone some or all 

 the way down this line, and there is nothing new in it. 

 Even if the firm still existed, Stepney Tyres Ltd could 

 not hope to enforce a claim that no spare wheel in India 

 should be called a stepney unless it was theirs. 

 When I was young, any British housewife knew her vacuum 

 cleaner, regardless of its make, as a hoover, and 

 duly hoovered her carpets. Not only in India can 

 a bajaj mean any auto-rickshaw, it turns up in Indonesia 

 as a becak.

 It is possible, as Hoover has 

 done, to fight back. Xerox some 30 years ago had 

 become in Britain almost a generic word, both as noun and 

 verb. But vigorous campaigning by the owners of that trademark 

 has persuaded most people to reinvent the photocopier.

 So whats wrong with Google trying 

 the same? As a matter of commerce, nothing whatsoever, and 

 if you or I try to market a rival search engine as, say, 

 great for googling, we shall deserve to be jumped on.

 In capital

 But commerce is not language, 

 and the gap between intellectual-property law and impudence 

 is a narrow one. Consider this sentence that your wordcager 

 concocted in an earlier incarnation: Anyone for a martini?she 

 asked, grabbing the thermos as the jeep roller-bladed 

 across the greasy tarmac. Apart from its silliness, 

 whats wrong with that? Any intellectual-property whizz 

 can tell you: almost every word is a trademark, yet theres 

 not a capital letter in sight. And if he works for one of 

 the firms concerned, he will dash off a missive to The 

 Telegraph to say so, instructing it to show better manners 

 next time.

 Many publishers and their chief 

 sub-editors will meekly agree. British newspapers are full 

 of ludicrous references to the Tarmac, when they 

 mean the tarmac, the road or runway surface, because 

 the firm that owns that century-old trademark tries with 

 great vigour to keep it as such. I look forward to writing 

 the crumbling tarmac, badly mixed and worse laid..., 

 and getting a sharp letter insisting that I should have 

 used a capital T.

 Dont blame the trademark man; 

 hes only doing his job. And its no skin off any reporters 

 nose, instead of writing, say, windsurfer, to write 

 the generic sailboard. But to shove in a capital 

 letter where common usage has none is worse than ludicrous: 

 its simply wrong, an offence against the English language. 

 No firm, however reasonable or however mighty, and whatever 

 its advertising budget, owns that.

 Least of all if there is no other 

 generic word, or if the word came before the trademark. 

 Or both. GIs were already riding in jeeps, and fighting 

 and dying in them, in as noble a cause as any war has ever 

 offered, before the vehicles then makers decided to unite 

 patriotism with profit and trademark the word. And if today 

 you choose to describe a Toyota-built vehicle as a jeep, 

 then (unless you are trying to sell it as such) thats your 

 choice, however offensive DaimlerChrysler or their Indian 

 licensees may find it. Dont call it a Jeep, though; 

 that would be an offence against language, truth and the 

 trademark of all three.

 Of course, you could say four-wheel-drive 

 Toyota sport utility vehicle instead.

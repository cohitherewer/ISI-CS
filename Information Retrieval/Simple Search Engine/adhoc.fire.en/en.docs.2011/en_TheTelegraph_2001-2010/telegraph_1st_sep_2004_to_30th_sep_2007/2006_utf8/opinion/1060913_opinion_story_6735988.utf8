The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EXPORTER OF ILLS

 In India, it is most natural to treat a summons with trepidation. But the letter from the United Nations general-secretary, Mr Kofi Annan, to the prime minister seeking an urgent meeting between the World Health Organization and Indian officials managing the polio eradication drive should evoke more feelings than that. Shame, perhaps. The missive is in response to a global report which brands India as the worlds lone exporter of the polio virus, and with reason. Indias polio figures have rapidly climbed to 283 this year from 66 in 2005. Western Uttar Pradesh alone accords for 90 per cent of the cases. The strains of the virus in UP have been found not only in other states of India, but also as far as Angola, Namibia and Congo in Africa and some countries in south Asia. A country which had pledged to make itself polio-free by 2006, has now taken to reporting rising cases of polio in at least eight of its states, forcing the Union health minister to admit that the disease cannot be eradicated anytime in the near future in India.

 What makes polio eradication such an impossibility in this country is not so much the lack of efforts as the failure to sustain them. There is, of course, the intransigent combination of factors like social backwardness, religion, caste and illiteracy that can thwart even the most concerted of drives (UPs case is particularly pertinent in this matter). But the ability to combat all this through sustained communication, encouragement, good management and the skills of trained personnel is often underestimated. There is little use blaming the people if the governments frequently botched vaccination drives owing to bad preservation of medicine vials, shortage of manpower or failure to carry out proper efficacy studies inspire more fear than confidence in such measures. If India is to overcome its rare distinction of being an exporter of diseases, the government has to be more convincing about its intent and more persistent in its effort.

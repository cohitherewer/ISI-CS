 Letters to Editor

 A difficult lesson

 Sir ? Vimala Ramachandran?s ?A stimulating study? (Feb 28) exposes the dysfunctional nature of our education system, especially for the underprivileged. The quality of education does not match its quantitative expansion. We need to emphasize on two aspects. First, to make our education more utilitarian. If the returns are good, even without meal schemes, parents will send children to schools and insist on learning. The utility of education has to be felt by both learners and parents. Second, we must improve accountability on all fronts.

 Yours faithfully,

 P.V.L. Ramana, Bokaro

 Visiting hours

 Sir ? The left needs to be more liberal in its approach towards issues concerning the United States of America. Mindlessly opposing the visit of President George W. Bush to India did no good to their image, nor to the larger interests of India. And the electorate in the states going to assembly polls ? West Bengal and Kerala ? will hardly be impressed by the sloganeering. The communists might oppose Bush?s policies, but they should remember that he is visiting India in response to a state invitation. In keeping with the Indian tradition of hospitality, the left should have been more courteous towards the president, especially since it supports the United Progressive Alliance. In fact, the left should learn from Russia and China which, inspite of their ideological differences with the US, continue to have heads of state visit each other. India?s left should show a more mature behaviour.

 Yours faithfully,

 S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim

 Sir ? The left parties, given that they are supporting the Union government, are also hosts when a foreign dignitary comes visiting. Their ugly demonstrations during the Bush visit were inappropriate. They could have asked the prime minister not to welcome Bush to India. If their demand went unheeded, they could have withdrawn their support to the government for pursuing a policy contrary to their conscience. But that was not to be. This is an election year and what better charade to impress the electorate than protest against Bush. So the significance of the visit was drowned in the din of inanities. 

 The people of India have no sympathy for Bush and they condemn many of his misadventures. But they would not like to forget that Bush is the representative of the people of America and has been elected by the nation in a direct democratic process. Americans surely expect a better treatment of their president during his official visit to any foreign country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The communist demonstration against the American president?s visit to India raises a basic question (?Left protests?, March 2). If communists are fundamentally opposed to the US president travelling around the world, why are there no leftist demonstrations when he reaches a communist country? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The presence of the president of America, George. W. Bush, in New Delhi threw the capital out of gear. The Central board examinations started on March 1, and in the ensuing chaos, both examinees and their parents had a trying time in order to reach the examination centres. 

 It may be recalled that the former deputy prime minister, L.K. Advani, had regretted the inconvenience caused to students during his visit to adjoining Noida. Doesn?t the state need to be a little more sensitive towards students appearing for their board exams?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

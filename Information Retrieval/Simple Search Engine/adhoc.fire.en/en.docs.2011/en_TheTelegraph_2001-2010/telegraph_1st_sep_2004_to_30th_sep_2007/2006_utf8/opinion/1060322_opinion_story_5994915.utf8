 BLOTS ON THE FOURTH ESTATE

 Wasting time

 In considering the state of the Indian media, this article could be about the nefarious nexus between certain mediapersons and some politicians, about the positive way in which various dubious people are always portrayed by sections of the media in return for favours rendered, and about venality, mutual back-scratching and toadyism. But why destroy cherished illusions? After all, the public have a right to believe in the integrity of the words and images provided by the free media of a democratic country.

 Never mind the bobbing heads, the screaming high-pitched voices and the flapping hands of the TV anchors and reporters, the total absence of any impartiality, weather-persons standing in front of the graphics of the region they are describing, the common deficit of correct pronunciation, and the minimal professional skills of presenters and interviewees alike. Ignore the ineptitude of presenters to read the teleprompter, their inability to improvise to deal with the technical glitches which inevitably arise, and the unawareness among producers that not everyone can look or sound presentable in front of a camera. The anchor-people function in front of an inadequate number of cameras, surrounded by third-rate set designs and pathetic props. The new channels are as outdated in their production values as the older ones.

 Electronic journalism is still in its infancy in India, and, energized by commercial finance, it has started to gallop before it can even crawl. Thus, its amateurishness is evident in every aspect. Meanwhile, the distinction between information and entertainment has become blurred to the detriment of both. Those in front of the cameras are unclear whether they should be acting out a performance or performing a public service, and no one has bothered to enlighten them yet. Just where do all the huge revenues sloshing around the TV industry go? 

 The national newspapers may be in broadsheet format but the print media is essentially a tabloid press in that the papers have become vehicles for the propagation of brittle gossip, titillation and celebrity-worship. The headlines on the front page are often as much about cricket as Bollywood. While the Western papers can portray semi-naked females to sell the morning papers, our press, being more restrained, carries pictures of lightly clad models, actresses and singers liberally across its pages, totally unrelated to any accompanying text and often without context. Its devotion to the dynastic principle in our political life, even into the fourth generation, is blatant in its sycophancy. And its attitude to criminality is ambiguous. Rogues caught red-handed are given plenty of column space and the greater the offence, the greater the coverage. There is nothing more appealing to reporters than a fulsome depiction of the buffoonery of those who are supposed to lead our country, or to quote their banalities. This kind of news is not difficult to cover, but hard news needs no embroidery.

 The seriously-inclined magazines give the impression that they find it difficult to fill their pages because, unlike the dailies, they cannot take recourse to local or international syndicated columns to plug the gaps. The fanzines around the Bollywood dream factory have rediscovered the definition of innuendo, but, at least, their writing, if not the subject-matter, is original and the advertisements on their pages are vastly superior to those printed elsewhere. As for the unheralded public radio, it has the most professional staff and still commands the widest audience.

 It is to be assumed that the purveyors of news have the laudable objective of informing, educating and enlightening the public. There is, however, little evidence to support such an assumption. Thus, we have hours of viewing time devoted to the same events with the same visuals on 24-hour TV news channels because there is no new information coming in, no new script and no new film. Have these channels not yet heard about news agencies? Or discovered the value of file footage? We have the same ?news? running for days at a time in the print media, even if it is about a split-second gesture by a cricket coach which might or might not have any significance. To help us understand the symbolism better, one paper published on its front page a guide to international finger gestures, unhelpfully as it turned out, since it got the most derogatory picture wrongly captioned. And the newspapers in patriotic mode jubilantly announced the names of the short-listed Indian contenders for the Bad Sex in Fiction Award, apparently unaware that this is a derisive booby prize for the worst, most redundant, and embarrassing narrative in a novel.

 But what may be even more difficult to correct is to reverse the descent down the slippery slope of the corruption of language. If print editors and TV script-writers are deliberately trying to evolve a new hybrid language, that is another matter. They would then do well to take a few useful hints from that classic cross-over masterpiece, All About H. Hatterr by G.V. Desani. On the other hand, if they have no such intention, one suspects that the authentic meanings of words like scam, scribe, spunk, sleuth, and spew have escaped them.

 Despite all its shortcomings, the Indian media evidently still retains sufficient potency to trouble the political establishment. Hence the recent Tamil Nadu legislation to acquire, transfer and take over the administration of a cable television network. A government seeking to seize control of the dissemination of public information and entertainment is retrogressive and violates good governance and democratic norms. But the Indian media has been remarkably reticent about condemning this blatant attempt at mind control. It would not be wise to reserve judgment on such issues till it is too late.

 Since it is important for the media to be treated with gravity, especially by itself, the op-ed spaces in the press and serious panel discussions on TV are turned over to opinionated and over-exposed contributors who ride their predictable hobby-horses. This country is touted as ?young India?: in that case, where are the fresh names and faces of the new generation of commentators and analysts? The all-suffering Indian will search the media in vain for information on the supposedly interconnected and interdependent world. Apart from invariably negative pieces on the president of the United States of America, George W. Bush, the rest of the planet escapes the attention of our robust and penetrating media. The four horsemen of the apocalypse may ride across the earth, but our media would remain unmoved. For those who look beyond the limited fare on daily offer, turn to the internet.

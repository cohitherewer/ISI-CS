 Letters to Editor

 For arts sake

 Sir The discovery of 40-odd paintings, by Rabindranath Tagore and other masters, in a private house in Santiniketan reveals the governments ineptitude when it comes to preserving and protecting masterpieces of Indian art (Art bust in Tagore town, Oct 18). The existence of this widespread international racket in stolen and fake artefacts is alarming not only for art lovers, but also for the State. The theft of the Nobel medal was clearly not enough to improve the wretched security conditions prevailing in the archives. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta 

 Freedom wear

 Sir Mukul Kesavan, in An enabling garment (Oct 12), has rightly pointed out that the burqa does not segregate Muslim women from the rest of the world. It simply gives them recognition and respect. Many Muslim women, who are keenly aware of its cultural values, are wearing the burqa by choice. Unfortunately, very often, people wrongly consider it to be a symbol of oppression enforced by Islamic states to uphold their religious beliefs. Had it been so, then all Pakistani women would have been found with the burqa, while Muslim women in London would have gone about without it. However, it is in Pakistan that fewer women wear it, while the number of veiled women in London is increasing. 

 As far as preserving peace and harmony around us is concerned, practising ones religion can hardly be an impediment. Our prime minister, Manmohan Singh, despite his turban and beard, does not find it impossible to run a country on secular principles.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuba Yasmin,

 Sir Mukul Kesavan has compared wearing a short skirt to using the burqa. A short skirt has nothing whatsoever to do with religion, whereas the burqa is imposed on women by a particular religion, sometimes even forcibly. Some do wear it voluntarily, but their volition is primarily an outcome of the brainwashing that begins early in their lives. Kesavan argues that since this is a problem for very few people, it should better be overlooked for the sake of religious harmony. 

 If that is so, then the fraction of the Hindus who, to this day, continue the gruesome ritual of sati, may be allowed to do so without being brought to book. If every non-Muslim country must give complete freedom of religious practice to Muslims, then the thousands of Hindus working or living in the Middle-East should not be prevented from performing pujas in public spaces.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir The extreme opposition to the burqa by some and its unqualified support by others essentially comes down to a clash between the bikini and the burqa. (Bogeys in their heads, Oct 19) While the former is an emblem of voluptuous physicality, the latter stands for extreme repression, obscuring every facial expression. To be fair to Blair and company, they do have a right to speak against wearing the burqa in schools, but they should, at the same time, respect the freedom to dress in whatever manner one wishes to in a civil society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir The wearing of the veil is instructed by the Quran. Aishah Azmi, the young schoolteacher in Britain, has done no wrong by not removing the burqa before her male colleagues. While the hijab is meant for women, the men too have been instructed to lower their eyes before women, other than those with whom marriage is prohibited. The authorities were entirely unjust in sacking Azmi for following her religion. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.A. Rahman Barkati, Calcutta

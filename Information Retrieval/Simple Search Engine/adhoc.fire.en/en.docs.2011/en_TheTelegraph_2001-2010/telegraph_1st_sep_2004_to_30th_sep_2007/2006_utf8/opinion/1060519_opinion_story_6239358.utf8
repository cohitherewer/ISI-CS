 LIVING YEAR

 - Experience dovetails into writing

1599: A year in the life of William Shakespeare 

By James Shapiro, 

Faber, pound;11.99

How did Shakespeare become Shakespeare? The desire 

to understand the professional career of Borges?s ?grey man? ? who is Everything 

yet Nothing ? is, as James Shapiro admits, a familiar one. And Shapiro places 

this question, and this desire, at the heart of 1599, his story of the 

most ?decisive? year in Shakespeare?s life. While Shapiro was making the final 

revisions to this book at Columbia, Stephen Greenblatt?s Will in the World 

came out from Harvard, posing the same question about Shakespeare?s development. 

If Greenblatt?s attempt to answer it was panoramic, flamboyant and rather too 

much fun (an austere English critic called it ?the literary-biographical equivalent 

of Coca-Cola?), Shapiro?s is quieter, more cautious, yet fuller and farther reaching, 

although less liberally splashed with local colour. His subject is ?less a Shakespeare 

in Love than a Shakespeare at Work?.

 What Shapiro?s book grapples with are the overwhelming fullness of the Shakespearean and Early Modern archives (he uses mainly the Folger, Huntington and British libraries) as well as the otherness of that other country, the Past, and of its inhabitants. That is, what one does not, and will never, have access to as a historian ? ?much as we might want Shakespeare to have been like us, he wasn?t?. Fortunately, this makes Shapiro both more careful and more adventurous. He creates his narrative of what ?happens? to Shakespeare and his fellow-Elizabethans in the course of a single year not only through reading ?almost all of the books written in 1599?, together with contemporary letters, sermons, plays, poems, diaries, travellers? accounts and official records, but also through informed speculative connections, acts of imagination that supplement scholarship with intuition. ?He that undertaketh the story of a time, especially of any length,? Shapiro quotes from Francis Bacon?s Advancement of Learning, ?cannot but meet with many blanks and spaces which he must be forced to fill up out of his own wit and conjecture.? Therefore, how Shakespeare might have listened to Lancelot Andrewes?s Ash Wednesday sermon preached before the Queen at Richmond, what Edmund Spenser might have made of the second part of Henry IV and, after Spenser?s death that year, how the playwright may have reflected on the career of the poet who had, after all, chosen paths the former had rejected, become crucial exercises of the historical imagination that cannot be dismissed conservatively as mere speculation.

 There is a detailed bibliographical essay at the end, but Shapiro?s main text has no footnotes. His scholarship does not intimidate, and the absence of pedantry and jargon lifts the book out of an exclusively academic readership, without landing it decoratively on the coffee-table. The felicity of Shapiro?s writing never allows the reader to lose sight of the complex interlacing of the inner and outer histories shaping one of the most intelligent, inclusive and elusive of creative minds. 

 Shakespeare?s inexhaustible capacity for creating new forms of difficulty for himself, so that his art never becomes too easy to make or receive, is the core narrative of this book ? his ability always to ?write a living line?, as Jonson put it in his tribute to Shakespeare. Hence, its main plot is the unfolding of the four 1599 plays ? the completion of Henry V, the writing of Julius Caesar and As You Like It in quick succession, and the drafting of Hamlet. (Shakespeare had already written and co-written about 18 plays.) Inextricable from this remarkable trajectory ? a movement from history, through biography, romance and pastoral, towards a tragic and sexually charged interiority ? is the story of the building of the Globe from the remains of the Theatre. Strands of ?history?, in the more conventional sense of the word, are also woven into these plots ? the sending off of an army to crush an Irish rebellion, the weathering of an armada threat from Spain, and the formation of a fledgling East India Company as the Elizabethans waited to see who would succeed their ageing and childless queen. And here, the career of the Queen?s precariously favourite Earl of Essex becomes a fascinating parallel to Shakespeare?s. 

 Shapiro juxtaposes the famous episode of Essex bursting into the royal bedchamber at Nonsuch, after returning from Ireland, to confront the Queen, still in d?shabill?, with the writing of the Closet Scene in Hamlet. This is not to suggest that the plays are ?two-way mirrors? reflecting history and contemporary life, but to create a sense of the simultaneity of things happening in time. Keats calls this ?dovetailing?, the perfectly random but retrospectively significant coming together of various strands of experience ? human encounters, books, plays, noises, smells, the weather and the whole chaos of life, contingent and unpredictable, which are the stuff of ?history?, and which also constitute, and are constituted by, human consciousness and its artefacts. History is everything that happens within and around the writer as he thinks, reads and writes ? the ?writer?s life?. 

 Shapiro?s achievement is to be able to tell a story of the dovetailing of myriad forms of experience at a crucial stage in Shakespeare?s career, and to do so by remaining close to the grain of Shakespeare?s writing. The Romantic myth of literary genius gives way, in this telling, to the sense of ?a writer who knew himself, knew his audience and knew what worked?. And especially with Hamlet, he ?was letting the writing take him where it would?. Yet the grey man?s inscrutability is allowed to remain till the end. His 17th-century biographer, John Aubrey, tells of how Shakespeare?s acquaintances remembered him as someone who was not ?a company keeper? ? ?he wouldn?t be debauched, and, if invited?, excused himself, saying that ?he was in pain?.

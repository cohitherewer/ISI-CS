 ALL THOSE WHO WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE

 Given the highly politicized election personnel in Bengal, fair play will depend on the neutral role of senior supervisors, writes A.K. Chatterjee

 Free for all

 When the framers of the Constitution conferred the right to vote on all adult citizens of India, irrespective of their caste, religion, gender or economic status, the whole world applauded. In many countries it had taken centuries for women or the poor to obtain the right to vote. Little did the framers of the Constitution realize that a day may come when the government in some parts of the country would come to power not on the basis of free and fair voting by citizens but through the sheer exercise of muscle power or an unholy alliance of politicians and criminals. How did this change come about and why have people lost their faith in free and fair elections?

 Throughout thirty-five years of my service career, I have been associated with practically all the elections held in West Bengal either as returning officer or as an election observer. I feel it is my duty to recount my experience in order to reveal how the gradual deterioration in the electoral process has come about and how the challenge of a free and fair election can still be met by a determined administration.

 During the third general election in the state in 1962, I was assistant magistrate in Nadia district. I was appointed assistant returning officer for the Santipur constituency, where Haridas Dey of the Congress and Kanai Pal of the Revolutionary Communist Party of India were the two main contestants. After the counting was over and I declared Pal the winner, he came and patted me on the back. He said that though his party does not believe in democracy, he is surprised that he could still win because the election was conducted in such a fair manner. He told me that as a young officer I should keep up this tradition when I would be in charge of holding election in an entire district ? a rare compliment. People?s faith in the impartiality of the election process was then intact.

 True to his prophecy, I was put in charge of election in the Malda district as district magistrate during the general election in 1967.This was a historic election, one in which the Congress, in power for the last 20 years in the state, lost to a combination of opposition parties. In Malda district, formerly a Congress bastion, the party won only five of the 10 assembly constituencies. Such a historic change could come about because the election was conducted in a fair manner with no interference from any political party, including the ruling party.

 However, the first United Front government did not last long as Prafulla Ghosh broke away to form an alternative government. Near anarchy prevailed in the state and ultimately president?s rule had to be imposed in 1968. Elections in 1969 brought back the earlier United Front government with a significant majority. Obviously, people did not like the idea of dismissing a duly elected government through defection. Had the election machinery in the state not been politically neutral, this victory would not have been possible. Unfortunately, the second United Front government also did not last long as the chief minister, Ajoy Mukherjee, resigned and president?s rule was again imposed. The election in 1971 brought back a Congress-led coalition with a slender majority.

 The victory of India in the Bangladesh war in 1971, and the emergence of Indira Gandhi as one of the most powerful leaders of India brought about a qualitative change in the political system. To establish her sway, she ordered nation-wide elections in 1972, and West Bengal followed suit. This year is a turning point in the history of the conduct of election in the state. For the first time, neutrality in holding election was not observed. In many constituencies, the ruling party at the Centre issued a whip to win at any cost. The local administration meekly surrendered.

 The following data will illustrate the striking difference in result between 1971 and 1972 election in earmarked constituencies. In Dum Dum, the Congress polled 31,421 votes in 1971 and 91,428 in 1972. The CPI(M) polled 40,731 in 1971 and 15,023 in 1972. In Baranagar, the figures were 32,282 in 1971 and 69,145 in 1972 for the Congress. For the CPI(M), it was 43,342 in 1971 and 31,154 in 1972.

 This was the first time that the election process was so grossly abused and it did incalculable harm to people?s faith in the impartiality of the election process in Bengal. Was this interference really needed? My own assessment is that had the election been conducted in a free and fair manner, as in the past, the Congress could have still won, maybe with a slender majority. The CPI(M) and the CPI boycotted the assembly for five years and a handful of SUCI and Muslim League MLAs made up the opposition. 

 The 1972 election was the only major state assembly election where I was not a returning officer. I was posted in the secretariat then and thankfully did not have to be a part of that election. My conscience would have revolted. However, there was no escape. At the time of the historic general election of 1977 after the Emergency, I was in charge of the election in the biggest district of the country in terms of population ? the undivided 24 Parganas with 10 parliamentary constituencies. Through a series of joint meetings with the civil and police officials, I had exhorted them to be absolutely fair in the conduct of elections. However, news reached me that in three parliamentary constituencies? two in Barrackpore subdivision and one in Barasat subdivision ? a whip has been issued to the police to assist the ruling party candidates to win. On election day, these three constituencies turned into a battlefield. I received continuous messages from presiding officers, polling personnel and opposition party leaders that people were being prevented from voting, that ballot papers were being snatched and stamped, and in some places ballot boxes were being removed. There was demand to countermand election in these three constituencies.

 After consultation with the chief secretary, I sent two additional district magistrates for on-the-spot inspection in the two subdivisions and they brought back reports from several polling stations where elections could not be held properly. Elections were countermanded in these polling stations, and not for the entire constituency.

 I received an emissary from the highest political level on the night of election, requesting me not to hold repoll in the polling stations. I politely told him that if there is a change in government at the Centre and an inquiry commission is set up to inquire into the irregularities, I would be held guilty for suppressing the reports of presiding officers. So I could not accede to the request. Repolls were ordered after 48 hours in the affected polling stations. By that time, the prospect of a change of government at the Centre had become clear and the same police officers who had defied my instructions were at my feet, asking me to save them.

 The state government became a lameduck government once the Janata Party came to power at the Centre. After three months, elections were ordered in the state. The 1977 assembly election was probably the most free and fair election ever held in the state. No allegation of rigging was received from any polling station and no disturbance took place anywhere. The election brought the first Left Front government to power with a big majority. 

 After the parliamentary election of 1977, the Election Commission, which was set up to lay uniform guidelines for holding elections in the Centre and in the states, started taking an active interest in the conduct of state elections. It started appointing election observers in the states. I was one of the first election observers appointed in Bengal during the by-election to the Arambagh parliamentary constituency in 1980. I was then secretary, cooperation department, and, I gather, my name was specially recommended given my experience in holding the 24 Parganas district election.

 The powers and functions of elections observers were then not codified and we were supposed to visit as many polling stations as possible on the date of election and report to the election commissioner whether elections have been properly held or not. I visited as many polling stations as possible on election day. Seeing the mass mobilization of voters by the panchayats, I knew by mid-day the prospective result of the election. This was the early part of the Left Front rule and no coercion was needed or exercised to cast votes freely.

 Subsequently, I was the election observer in the 1982 assembly election in Asansol constituency, in Barrackpore constituency for the 1985 parliamentary election and 1987 assembly election and Chowringhee constituency in the 1991 assembly election. I visited a large number of polling stations on all these elections but except for the 1985 parliamentary election, the rest were tame affairs. In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi wave was sweeping the country and Bengal was also affected. In one polling station in Naihati, I found a presiding officer unwilling to allow a few voters to cast their votes as time was over although they were in the queue. I explained the legal position to the presiding officer. Fortunately, he relented. Election observers then did not have the legal authority to direct presiding officers or returning officers to undertake any course of action. Such power came with the amendment of the Representation of People?s Act, 1996 and addition of a new Section 20B, which made the status of election observers more meaningful. Election observers can now direct returning officers even to stop counting votes at any time before the declaration of result or not to declare the result if, in the opinion of the observer, foul play has taken place at a number of polling stations. So ?tin soldiers? till 1996, election observers today are much more powerful and they must exercise this power with utmost discretion. 

 Although none of the elections after 1977 have seen a law and order situation of that magnitude, aberrations have crept into the election system because the Left Front has been in power for the last three decades. The voters? list of a constituency is the cornerstone of a fair election. The list is supposed to be updated at periodic intervals, particularly before holding any election. Owing to the lack of interest of political parties, voters? lists contain names of several who are dead or non-existent or who have left the constituency or who are ineligible for being foreign citizens. Objections are not often filed in time and the door-to-door survey which administrative officers are supposed to carry out are often done on paper without actual visits. The recent drive by 19 election observers who have toured the districts of Bengal has brought into sharp focus the magnitude of the problem. Deletion of 13 lakh voters from the electoral rolls is something unprecedented in the history of election in the country. 

 For conduct of elections a large number of polling personnel are needed who are usually drawn primarily from the state government, educational institutions of the state like schools, colleges and universities. The rest are Central government staff. The state government employees are highly politicized today as they belong either to the coordination committee supporting the Left Front or employees? federation holding allegiance to various factions of the Congress. So are the school teachers and college and university teachers. Even the police personnel have been allowed to be unionized and belong mostly to the West Bengal police association which has a close link with the ruling front. To expect fair play when the majority of the election personnel are politically aligned is a difficult task unless senior supervisory officers can play an effective neutral role. 

 The most favourite technique that has developed to prevent genuine voters from casting votes is booth jamming. Dedicated cadre see to it that the voters? line moves at a snail?s pace throughout the day so that genuine voters often leave in disgust. The second direct technique to rig elections is false voting against the name of dead voters or voters who have left the constituency and in some case even against the names of genuine voters. Such false voting can be prevented only if election agents of various political parties are active and alert. Often these election agents are either absent or do not take interest, maybe because they are coerced or scared by the dominant political parties of the area. 

 If a genuine voter finds that vote has already been cast in his name, he is entitled to cast a ?tender vote.? Often the presiding officer, to avoid trouble, requests him to leave without casting such a vote. The voter?s identity card has not been made mandatory yet and the alternative of ration cards is hardly authentic, given the large number of bogus ration cards in the state. 

 All these malpractices can be checked to a large extent if sector magistrates, who are placed in charge of supervision of a group of polling stations, can conduct intense verification through continuous visits. However, even the neutrality of civil servants who are serving the same party in power for three decades is today questioned.

 The extent to which the election observer can visit polling stations in his area is limited by time. However, because of improved methods of communication, he can always be contacted on his mobile phone and he can rush to any area if irregularities are taking place. If the EC appoints 300 observers, as some newspapers have reported, there will be effective supervision no doubt but this will lower the prestige of the state government and its officers. 

 The basic responsibility for holding free and fair elections will have to be shouldered by administrative officials ? both civic and police. It is unlikely that with an enlightened chief minister at the helm, there will be dictates ?to win at any cost?. However, in some sensitive areas where political rivalries are acute, such whips may be issued by local political leaders. It is the duty of the administration to refuse to abide by any such whip. If I could refuse to abide by such a whip in 1977, there is no reason why the district magistrate or sub-divisional officers today cannot show the same courage. Senior officers now have the added advantage of the protection provided by the EC. 

 If in Bihar, the EC could create a favourable environment for holding an election which saw a party entrenched for 15 years being removed from power, it can do the same in Bengal. We must remember that in this age of global communication, Bengalis all over the world will be eagerly watching the elections in the state. If the new government comes to power through a free and fair election process, the image of the state will become bright all over the world. When West Bengal is on the threshold of rapid economic change, let the political process sustain the momentum of economic development. Let the dream of our Constitution-makers of a government being elected by the free will of all adult citizens, irrespective of their caste, creed or religion, be truly fulfilled.

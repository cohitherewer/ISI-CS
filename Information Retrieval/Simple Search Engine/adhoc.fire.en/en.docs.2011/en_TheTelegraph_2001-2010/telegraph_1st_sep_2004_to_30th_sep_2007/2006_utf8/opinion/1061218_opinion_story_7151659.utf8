 NO THREAT

 Unnecessary and irrelevant controversy concerning the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Act of 2006 is confounding public opinion. Such controversy has been stirred not only by political parties opposed to Mr Manmohan Singhs government but also by powerful sections of the scientific community. Under the circumstances, certain basic and elementary aspects of the concerned act need to be reiterated and clarified. In the heat of the controversy, what is being overlooked in India is that the act is an enabling legislation, which allows the US executive to negotiate an agreement to discharge its commitments to India in the given sphere. In this sense, the act is largely an internal US process pertaining to its own executive and legislature. The act does contain recommendations and preferences articulated by the legislature, but these are all aimed at the US administration. The latter will now have to make an assessment to determine whether the act gives it an adequate mandate to fulfil it commitments to India. Informed public opinion in India is somewhat preempting the issue by attempting to make such an assessment. This cannot be done by India or in India. It is a matter internal to the US. Moreover, it needs to be remembered, that the US secretary of state, Ms Condoleezza Rice, after examining the legislation announced that it would enable the US administration to meet all its commitments under the July 18 and March 2 joint statements. Given that announcement, it is somewhat bizarre for a group of Indians to assert that the legislation falls short of the commitments made in the joint statements.

 The Bharatiya Janata Party has been the most vocal opponent of the Indo-US nuclear deal. The opposition is based partly on the fact that the act will stop further testing of nuclear weapons by India. What is conveniently forgotten is that when it was in power, the BJP had not only accepted a moratorium on testing, but it had also showed no reluctance to convert it into a de jure obligation. The Indo-US deal only continues with this moratorium. Through the Henry J. Hyde Act of 2006, what the US legislature has done is to express its preferences. Such an expression of views by a foreign legislature should not be viewed as a major threat to Indias autonomy in foreign policy or as a breach in Indias nuclear arsenal. That a significant part of Indias political and intellectual elite sees it in such terms is a sad, if telling, commentary on the current state of affairs.

 Letters to Editor

 Put the money where it counts 

 Sir ? The prime minister should have been more generous while doling out relief to the farmers of Vidarbha, especially when a lot of money is often spent on funding pleasure trips for our netas and babus alike (?Cash, but no loan waiver?, July 2). Instead of frittering money on such wasteful activities, the government should ensure that it uses its precious resources to rescue farmers from their poverty and debt-traps. It is a pity that Indian politicians think nothing of going on expensive holidays while the poor continue to lead miserable lives.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta

 Saving grace

 Sir ? The initiative taken by corporate India to conserve the country?s wildlife deserves praise (?Boardroom fights for jungle?, July 3). Even after almost sixty years of independence, India still has very little to show by way of achievement in the area of wildlife conservation. This is so because there is a lack of awareness among Indians regarding the importance of conservation, and the government, on most occasions, is short of money to take up conservation on a large scale. The media has also done very little in this field, except publish occasional reports on endangered species like the Olive Ridleys. Under the circumstances, the news that corporate houses in India will now do something for the fast disappearing wildlife would instil new hope in the minds of environmentalists. In fact, it would be a good idea if the government considers granting tax exemptions to these companies on the amount they spend to support wildlife and launch campaigns for spreading environmental awareness.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Das,

 Sir ? It is heartening to note that corporate giants have come forward to protect the tiger, which is on the verge of extinction in India. Since the tiger is one of the creatures that stand on the upper rungs of the ecological chain, its disappearance would entail the breakdown of the entire ecosystem. The chairman of DSP Merill Lynch, Hemendra Kothari, should be congratulated for taking the lead in motivating fellow business magnates to help raise funds for wildlife conservation. Unfortunately in our country, even well-established NGOs like the World Wildlife Fund depend on money from Europe and the United States of America to launch programmes. It is time that India learnt to rely on its rich industrialists to ensure a steady flow of funds for the purpose of conservation. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.R. Banerjee,

 Sir ? It seems that the rich are suddenly undergoing a change of heart. First it was Bill Gates and Warren Buffett donating sizeable portions of their wealth for the cause of charity. Now Indian corporate barons have come together to save the big cats in the country. Whatever the reasons behind the sudden display of generosity, one hopes that it will at least serve the purpose of saving endangered species. An initiative as the one taken by India Inc. has been long overdue. These companies have surplus money at their disposal, and the least they can do is to spend it on areas which require funds desperately.

 Yours faithfully, 

 S. Mukherjee, 

 Calcutta

 Fatal attraction

 Sir ? Raising the age limit for buying cigarettes cannot rid us of the smoking menace (?UK mulls raising smoking age limit?, July 4). People cannot kick their habit as long as they can buy cigarettes easily. If the government really cares for public health, then it has to do more than just raise the age limit for buyers ? curtailing the supply of tobacco and then stopping it altogether might be a good idea. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 M. Nandi, 

 Calcutta

 Pious 

 Flames: European Encounters With Sati (1500-1830) 

 By Andrea Major 

 Oxford, Rs 625

 Pious Flames studies Europe?s response to sati over more than three hundred years. The author argues that, contrary to popular belief, European observers have not imagined sati as being diametrically opposed to a coherent western morality. Rather, their response has been characterized by heterogeneity and ambivalence. 

 Travellers produced the first substantial body of European writing on sati in the 16th and 17th centuries. These eye-witness accounts introduced sati as a spectacle to the West. Major concludes, after studying several such narratives, that there was rarely any extended analysis of the ideological basis of sati. 

 Sati is often depicted in the early modern European narratives as an act of volition and is therefore closely associated with suicide, a Christian ?sin?. It is of little wonder then that sati is imagined as a satanic rite in these accounts. Yet the ?chaste? motivation behind sati redeems it from being merely an act of suicide in the European imagination and leads to its romanticization .

 Europe in the 18th century increasingly views sati as an expression of faith. The Hindu woman is seen as inherently devoted to her husband. Artistic depiction of sati in this period invokes heroic sacrifice and martyrdom rather than suicide and eternal damnation.

 The ambiguous response of the previous centuries gives way to collective horror in the 19th century as the devoted heroine is replaced by a passive victim who evokes not admiration but pity. The author contends that this transformation is related to events in Europe itself. Sati now offends European sensibilities because a shift from torturous to utilitarian punishment has taken place in the West. Major has a point when she writes that the moral concern over sati is closely related to a more general debate about what is acceptable as public spectacle and how a ?civilized? society should deal with ?uncivilized? sights.

 Thus the 19th century, an age in which Victorian gender ideology assigned women to the private sphere, justifying her seclusion on grounds of an imagined physical frailty which necessitates her protection from violent behaviour, found sati offensive. 

 Major writes an engrossing thesis that is largely free from the academic jargon which often mars narratives of this sort. One is slightly disappointed, though, at her near silence on Indian contributions to the debate over sati; surely there is a dialogue between such writings and the ?European responses? she analyses. Surprisingly, that exchange remains largely invisible in this work.

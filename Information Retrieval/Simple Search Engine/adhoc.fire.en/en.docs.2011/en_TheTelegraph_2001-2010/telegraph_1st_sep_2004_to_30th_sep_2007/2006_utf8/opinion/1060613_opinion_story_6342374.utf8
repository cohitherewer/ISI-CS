 INTERNATIONAL CALL

 While most ministers try to escape the Indian summer, a few have more important things on their plate, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Making common cause

 The information and broadcasting minister, Priyaranjan Das Munshi, must be the only Union minister this summer who is not junketing abroad on government expense. That is because he has gone to oversee World Cup matches in Stuttgart, Germany for two weeks on an all-expenses-paid trip by FIFA, fully sanctioned by the prime minister. (Oh yes, there?s the civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, too, who has gone to Alaska on a personal holiday.) But check out the other peripatetic ministers of the United Progressive Alliance escaping the searing heat of the Indo-Gangetic plain, and the one motif that currently unites them is the desire to cross the seven seas as soon as possible.

 So commerce minister Kamal Nath has just returned from work in Paris, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar is in the United States of America to meet his counterparts, Oscar Fernandes was last heard attending an HIV-AIDS conference in New York, and even Somnath Chatterjee has embarked on a trip to the reindeer country, Finland. (Chatterjee will later travel to England on a personal tour, from where he is expected to travel to watch some matches in Germany.)

 Evidently, the prime minister was so perturbed by the unwritten slogan of his cabinet ? ?have UPA ministership, will travel ? that in collaboration with the ministry of external affairs, a fatwa was issued to all scrambling for first-class tickets on Air India: Only those mantris who urgently needed to travel on work should go, lest so many official travellers disturb the work of missions abroad.

 Only the defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, seemed to have received the full support of the prime minister for his trips to Japan and China. In Japan, Mukherjee was given the red carpet treatment, the Japanese inviting India to join a much more robust defence of the Indian Ocean waters, especially around the Straits of Malacca. For the Japanese, the protection of oil frigates from west Asia is as crucial to Japan?s recovery from recession as is the fact that Chinese ships may be carrying missile parts and nuclear components for North Korean/Pakistani ports.

 But it was in China that Pranab Mukherjee closed the chapter of antagonism, at least for form?s sake, that blew open with the nuclear tests in 1998. Mukherjee was taken on a tour of the major People?s Liberation Army sites, amidst stories that certain Chinese records pertaining to the 1962 war with India had been declassified. And even though both parties seem to be making a realistic sense of their strengths as well as redetermining that the border problem must be resolved as quickly as possible, Beijing is also simultaneously aware that the US seems to be single-mindedly focussing on building India as a major power as a counterweight to China.

 India?s response to any such query is a resounding no, worth just as much as the emphatic denials that periodically emerge from China when it is accused of helping Pakistan or North Korea with both nuclear and missile technology. Meanwhile, ask Beijing why it continues its worldwide campaign against India acquiring a permanent security council seat, especially if both are the fast friends they make themselves out to be? The answer is that both establishments know that although they pay lip friendship to each other (world?s greatest and most ancient civilizations, third world powers, Asian neighbours, Panchsheel, and so on), the truth is that both are angling for the same space in the international balance of power: the number two slot.

 To be fair to India, it has no such pretensions, not currently anyhow, what with poverty levels so high, literacy levels still low and the Indo-US nuclear deal coming down to the wire. That is why the nuclear deal is so important, because it gives New Delhi a special place in the world of nuclear realpolitik. Not part of the ?permanent-five?, who are both security council permanent members as well as the only acknowledged nuclear powers in the world. But a notch above the rest of the world, which has voluntarily ceded its nuclear weapons. It is this special place created by America that China abhors, because India then becomes too close for comfort ?up there?. 

 The moment of truth for the nuclear deal ? and India?s prestige, worldwide ? will come later next month, at the end of July or the beginning of August, when the US congress votes on this special, strategic relationship with India. Domestic opposition within the US continues to be high, especially as a number of strategic analysts like Michael Krepon ? who have, ironically, made their career from the analyses of India?s nuclear programme ? continue to sponsor free lunches-cum-seminars opposed to the deal. Meanwhile, George W. Bush?s ratings continue their free fall...Still, with Bush having put his weight behind the agreement, many are hoping that it will pass. If it doesn?t now (that is in July-August), India can more or less kiss it goodbye.

 Manmohan Singh, clearly, has set his heart on giving the Congress a leg-up worldwide, especially since internal criticism of his government?s pro-US policies seems to be growing. In the interim, though, the Congress has decided that it must balance its pro-US image with paying lip service to its traditional constituency, that is the non-aligned world. 

 And so, the prime minister will be travelling to Havana, Cuba for the non-aligned summit later this September, after a trip to Brazil to participate in the India-Brazil-South Africa partnership. Interestingly, though, he is not likely to go on from there to the general assembly in New York, with government sources emphasising that the prime minister ?doesn?t have that kind of time to stay out of the country?. There is another explanation: both the Americans and the ministry of external affairs have agreed that it would be too embarrassing for Bush to be seen shaking the hand of Manmohan Singh, who had only a few days before shaken the hand of the US?s mortal enemy, Fidel Castro.

 Then there?s that other possibility of a trilateral summit between Manmohan Singh, Pervez Musharraf and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, in Tehran in August, to finalize the pipelines from Iran to India, via Pakistan. So will the summit ever take place? The answer is, more than likely. With the Iranians and the Americans getting into direct talks, New Delhi?s sense of comfort with Tehran is likely to increase proportionately.

 Letters to Editor

 Lip service

 Sir It is shocking to note that the government is still dithering over an outright ban on child marriage (Child marriage ban on the rocks, Oct 22). In fact, the new act merely aims at preventing this malpractice. In a society where men dominate women, such a step is likely to further erode womens position. It is strange that while the government talks about protecting the girl child, it is impervious to the fact that the rights of girl children and women are being trampled by men. The child bride has no choice in a matter as serious as marriage. The refusal to ban child marriage means that poor girls are deprived of education and rushed into marriage by their parents. The argument that such a union cannot be abolished, given the prevalent social traditions, is simply preposterous. Social traditions in a patriarchal society such as ours are invariably determined by men. Worse, they are an impediment to womens liberation and empowerment. A change in the law may not be the only way to bring about changes in social attitudes, but it could certainly act as a tool with which minors could be protected. Once upon a time, sati was an integral part of Indian society. That didnt stop a legal ban being imposed on it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir That those in power are not keen on declaring child marriages void in the name of tradition is not surprising. They are intent on securing their vote banks, comprising conservative elements. The debate on the differences between terms like restraint, prevention and abolition is too demagogic. Appointing officials to prevent child marriage is an equally absurd idea. A United Nations report says that 50 per cent of Indian girls are married before they are 18. Not only does this raise the chances of violence against women, it also leads to higher maternal mortality rates. That the government is thinking of replacing the old law to strengthen the drive against under-age marriages is a judicious decision. But declaring child marriage illegal would have been a better idea.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Everytime one thinks that politicians cannot possibly sink any lower, one is surprised. The Centres refusal to ban child marriage is a perfect example of this. If social traditions had sanctified a modern version of the thuggi, would the government have sanctioned their activities?

 In India, political considerations take precedence over everything else. The icing on the cake is the suggestion that the amended act would allow the couple to file for divorce once they become adults. But by the time these children become adults, the girl may have already become a mother. She would be unable to support herself, let alone the kids, and would have nowhere to go. Thus divorce cannot be a favourable option. Besides, a marriage will not be considered invalid unless registered. And only a marriage where the woman is at least 18 and the man 21 can be registered. Which means, there is little hope for a child bride to ever free herself of the social imposition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir Indian society still finds divorce unacceptable. Thus, it would be unwise to declare all child marriages void since that would force some couples to call off their union. A better way to combat child marriage is by raising the awareness of the conservative sections of society. This way, it would be possible to strike at the roots of this social evil. The governments decision to replace the Child Marriage Restraint Act with the Prevention of Child Marriage Act is, in a way, an acknowledgement of Indias failure to stop child marriages even six decades after independence. But prevention would only be possible if the officers appointed to stop such unions are punished everytime a child marriage takes place. Apart from checking abuse and helping young girls get education, the law would be useful in checking Indias burgeoning population growth.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir Child marriage is common in states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, some of the poorest states in the country. The proposed ban on child marriage is unlikely to see the light of day. One fears that a similar fate is likely to befall the ban on child labour. India needs iron-fisted rulers to rid the country of such practices . 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Child marriage should be banned. But if the new act has a retrospective effect and nullifies all child marriages, it will be unfair to those who enjoy a happy conjugal life despite a child marriage. The new legislation should give the bride the option of repudiating the marriage. Besides, the law punishing intercourse with a girl below 16 should be upgraded and the age limit extended to 18 years. 

 Yours faithfully,

Swagato Paul, Calcutta

 Sir The proposed act does not address the root of the problem the lack of education and abject poverty. Until women enjoy economic security, such laws will be futile.

 Yours faithfully,

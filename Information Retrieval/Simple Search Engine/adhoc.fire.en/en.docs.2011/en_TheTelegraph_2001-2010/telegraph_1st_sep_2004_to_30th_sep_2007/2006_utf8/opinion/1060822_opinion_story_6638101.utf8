The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ACTING RIGHT

 It does not bode well for a modern democracy when its leaders feel edgy about the citizens right to information. It is, therefore, deeply reassuring that the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, has taken a decisive stance against the proposed amendments to the Right to Information Act. Not only would the amendment bill not be introduced in this session of the parliament, but the bill may also be dropped altogether. In the name of removing ambiguities from the existing RTI Act, the Centre, in this case represented by the information and broadcasting minister, had drafted clarifications to some sections of the act that would have seriously affected its ability to ensure transparency and accountability in democratic governance and administration. To include file notings and public examination scripts in the list of documents exempted from direct scrutiny by citizens, or to safeguard the identities of ministers and bureaucrats with regard to these file notings, would have seriously compromised the power and scope of this act.

 In vetoing such intervention so unequivocally, Mr Singh has shown both good sense and firmness. First, he has displayed a quality that is now rare among Indian political leaders the ability to remain open to persuasion against ones own position on an issue. The suggested amendments had initially had the apparent approval of the Prime Ministers Office, even if they had originated in the over-zealous tendencies of some of his ministers and colleagues in the party. But the countrywide agitation against these changes, especially the sustained activism in civil society, has found the right response in the prime minister himself. And matters of personal ego have not come in the way of a sincere revaluation of his own position. Second, in articulating this position in no uncertain terms, and in making sure that his words directly influence the fate of the amendments, Mr Singh has taken a clearly contrary position with respect to some important members of his own cabinet and party. And this is how it should be. The inordinate excesses of the information and broadcasting ministry, for instance, are part of the general syndrome of insecurity with some of the fundamental premises of a mature democracy. In voicing, with such conviction, his belief in the ordinary citizens right to information, Mr Singh has proven his own maturity as well as that of the polity he governs.

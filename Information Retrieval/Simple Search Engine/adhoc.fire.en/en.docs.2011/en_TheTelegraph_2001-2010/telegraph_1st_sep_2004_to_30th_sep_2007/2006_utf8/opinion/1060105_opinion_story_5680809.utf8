 ORIGINAL WEALTH

 Industrialization is dependent on land. The claiming of land invariably entails dispossession of those who occupy it. In India, the standard practice is to offer compensation to those who are thus dispossessed. The compensation package has two components. One is cash and the other is the offer of jobs in the factories which are set up on the land. The second aspect is honoured more in the breach, and the cash compensation is never adequate for the losses that are suffered. This is the context for the violence that engulfed Jajpur in Orissa. Tribals protested against the setting up of a steel plant in Kalinganagar on land that had been taken away from them. The police resorted to firing to quell the protest and in the violence 12 tribals and one policeman died. The question of who began the violence pales into insignificance because of certain fundamental issues that are never addressed. The tribals are the original inhabitants of the land in Orissa. The word original is emphasized advisedly. As adivasis, their claims on the land are more than ancestral, they are primordial. The compensation and rehabilitation that are usually offered in cases of dispossession destroy their lifestyle and also take away their environment from them. This devastation has been rampant in Madhya Pradesh and Chhotanagpur when private companies took out leases on coal mines. The matter needs to be looked at in a different light than welfare and do-gooding.

 The mining of ore means the utilization of natural resources which lie below the land occupied by the tribals. The ore exists precisely because the tribal lifestyle had no use for this particular resource. In other words, the tribal way of life has preserved and maintained the ore. The tribals should thus have a share in the gains and benefits of its exploitation. As holders of the land and protectors of the natural resource, the adivasis can make a justified claim to enjoy a share of the royalties that the government enjoys from the private corporations that actually use the ore. Natural justice demands that the tribals be given a share of the royalties. Leaders of the tribal movement are now realizing the importance of making such a demand. It is undeniable that the process of industrialization and the tribal way of life are at odds with each other. The disappearance of the latter cannot be compensated for by cash alone. There has to be a recognition that adivasis are partners in the creation of national wealth.

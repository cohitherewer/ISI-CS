 MID-LIFE CRISIS

 Controversy and debate are the alpha and omega of democracy. But there are certain kinds of confrontations which do not augur well for the future of a republic. On the occasion of Republic Day, it seems as if the Indian political system is poised to face certain battles which would have been best avoided. One of them is the looming clash between the judiciary and the legislature. The immediate cause of this was parliament?s suspension of the 11 members who had been nabbed while taking money for questions. The matter has, however, now acquired different and alarming proportions. Some of the suspended members of parliament went to the judiciary for redress. The latter has issued a notice to the speaker of the Lok Sabha. Mr Somnath Chatterjee, the speaker of the Lok Sabha, with the full backing of all the political parties in parliament, has refused, with due respect, to accept the notice. This means, not to put too fine a point on it, that parliament and judiciary are at loggerheads, and the battle is about nothing else save the sovereignty of parliament and its refusal to accept the superiority that the judiciary is claiming for itself. Two arms of the state, out of the three, appear to be pulling in opposite directions. This can only harm the body politic of the republic.

 The other issue addresses the federal character of the Indian polity. The Supreme Court has, in no uncertain terms, condemned the dissolution of the Bihar assembly in May 2005 by the governor of the state, Mr Buta Singh. The apex court opined that Mr Singh had acted with ?undue haste? and added that the Union cabinet should have been a little more careful before it accepted Mr Singh?s recommendations. The imposition of president?s rule has always been a contentious issue in Indian politics, and has often been seen as an instrument to impose the Centre?s dominance on the democratic will of the people of the states. The verdict of the Supreme Court strengthens such suspicions. It is also undeniable that as the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh must bear the moral responsibility of what the apex court considers to be a gross violation of democratic rights.

 The physical existence of the republic is under no threat. But the above examples do suggest that the spirit of the republic ? the codes and conventions of its functioning ? is under strain. The 57th year of the republic may well turn out to be a tumultuous one.

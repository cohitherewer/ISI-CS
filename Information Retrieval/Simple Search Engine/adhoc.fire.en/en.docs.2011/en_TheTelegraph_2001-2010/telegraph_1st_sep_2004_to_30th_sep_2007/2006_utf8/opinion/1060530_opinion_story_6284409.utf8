The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MORE SEATS IN RESERVE

Malvika Singh

 As the days roll on there is no sign of any discussion or debate on the issue of quotas for those who form the bulk of India. No new ideas have been born and all political entities are one in this vote-grabbing scheme. If only they would act in consensus on all the other critical issues that face this nation, instead of boycotting, endlessly, parliament and its procedures. Selfish politicians, most of whom are as old as the hills, just seem to want to get rid of the problem ? allocate ?seats? and make all these citizens stand apart as ?reserved humans?, an alienated species. Hugely insulting for all the good people who happen to be tribals, OBCs, minorities, women, scheduled castes and tribes. It is the most condescending and inappropriate way of dealing with those who are less privileged. The irony is that this pedestrian strategy of ?affirmative action? will not garner the votes all parties are desperate for or be instrumental in bettering the state of the ?reserved? classes. 

 It is unacceptable that a handful of failed individuals determine how they want to ?equalize? Indians. It is embarrassing to use such definitions in the 21st century. It is divisive and demeaning to say the least. To think that the UPA government is allowing its relic minister to carry on in this manner makes one wonder whether the government understands what this country really needs to make it a modern egalitarian state that is internationally competitive. 

 Wool over the eyes

 Everything is utterly frustrating because one believed, maybe wrongly, that this government would take on the challenge of change and development sans discrimination. But alas, discrimination rules from the seat of power in Delhi. Who would have believed in their wildest of dreams that Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi would have presided over this failed experiment of ?affirmative action?, going against the many fine minds who people the knowledge commission as well as other think-tanks, all because of some old, stuck-in-a-time-warp colleague, ruled by the left and their outdated mindset? It is time to call the bluff of these opportunists who do not want change because it will question them and their political tactics. None of these self-appointed ?saviours? of the ?underdog? has ever used public sector doctors or quota-appointed surgeons for their ailments, nor have they sent their children to municipal schools. They do not respect their own endeavours. They know the truth. They recognize the horror they have inflicted on us. They know how atrocious the schools are, how pathetic the education system is, and how incompetent their management of learning is.

 A first-rate doctor is a first-rate doctor regardless of caste, colour or creed. Likewise, experts in all professions. Therefore, get the schools to be ace so that everyone goes to the same schools. The government must cease to pull wool over the eyes of patient, good and unsuspecting people across this land. In fact, the actions of Indian political professionals are designed to keep the ?underdog?, under the mire for many more generations. This present generation of leaders and policy-makers has to pass on for India to emerge, step out of the boxed-in thinking of our times, and use its skills and strengths to take Bharat to its rightful place. 

 In their overenthusiasm to ?please? heaven knows who, Congress spokespeople are reduced to insulting Nehru and his position on quotas as they defend the UPA government and its position. Who would have believed that this Congress-led UPA government would regress on many policies as their populism suffocates them, fossilizes their minds? When populism runs riot, revolution is a probability. People will revolt against many tyrannies hoisted upon them by selfish rulers who do not see the writing on the wall, are arrogant in their powerful positions, no longer able but in fact, disabling. The Supreme Court will pass a judgement today, as I write this.

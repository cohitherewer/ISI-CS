 PRIZE FOR THE BIG MAN

 Gwynne Dyer

 It is very unlikely that Gambias president, Yahya Jammeh, re-elected last month to a third term with a 67 per cent majority, will ever win the Mo Ibrahim Prize for achievement in African leadership. He is a stereotypical African big man ruler, which is precisely what the prize seeks to eliminate.

 Yahya Jammeh first came to power in a military coup twelve years ago. He has won three terms in more or less free elections on the strength of his lavish spending (of borrowed money) and his control of the police (who wore Vote Jammeh badges at his election rallies ). He is not a monster, and his small west African country has escaped the horrors that devastated other nations in the region. But you would definitely not trust him with the rent money.

 Mo (short for Mohammed) Ibrahim is a very different sort of person. When I first met him, I thought he had a very good idea and practically no chance of turning it into reality, but money opens many doors. This week, in London, he has launched a prize so rich that it puts the Nobel Peace Prize in the shade.

 To qualify for the Mo Ibrahim Prize, you have to be a democratically elected African ruler who handed over power peacefully to a similarly elected successor, and did good things for the country while you were in power. The prize is worth five million dollars in the first ten years, and more if the ex-leader enjoys a very long retirement.

 Mo Ibrahim was born 60 years ago in Sudan, grew up in Egypt, and moved to Britain in 1975 to study telecommunications. In 1989, he set up Mobile Systems International, and sold it to Marconi for $900 million. Then he created Celtel, to bring mobile phones to all the countries in Africa.

 Handsome reward

 Last year, the Kuwait-based mobile operator, MTC, bought Celtel for $3.4 billion and Mo Ibrahim started looking for something useful to do with his money. Most Africans would agree that bad governments are one of their continents biggest problems. So what might be done to encourage powerful people in Africa to behave better? He focussed on just one key aspect of the problem: African presidents and prime ministers cannot afford to quit.

 Mo Ibrahims solution and he would admit that it is only partial is the Prize. As things stand now, if an African leader is legitimately elected, serves honourably, and quits when his time is up, he faces ruin.The Prize, for which only retiring African presidents and prime ministers are eligible, is $500,000 a year for ten years for their personal use, plus an additional $200,000 a year to give to charity. That deal ends after the first decade of retirement, but the ex-leaders continue to get $200,000 a year until they die. 

 To help choose the winners, the Mo Ibrahim Foundation is creating an index of good governance. It will be similar to Transparency Internationals corruption index, but it will measure how well African leaders deliver security, health, education and economic development to their people and how well they respect human rights and the democratic process. The index will be produced annually by an independent team based at Harvard, and this may be the most important component of the project.

 Almost half of Africas 53 heads of state have been in power for more than ten years, and fifteen of them have been in power for over fifteen years. At most, the Mo Ibrahim Prize can persuade only one of them each year to retire. But if the index by which the lucky one is chosen becomes a widely accepted measure of the quality of governance, it will become an immensely useful tool in the hands of a younger generation of Africans who desperately want to break with the big man tradition of the first generation of post-colonial leaders. Which is doubtless what Mo Ibrahim really has in mind.

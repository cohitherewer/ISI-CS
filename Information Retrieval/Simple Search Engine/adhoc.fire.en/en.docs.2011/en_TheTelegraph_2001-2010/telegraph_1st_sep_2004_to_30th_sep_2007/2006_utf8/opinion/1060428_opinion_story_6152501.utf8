 STARS OF THE SHOW

 The Kapoors: The First Family of Indian Cinema By Madhu Jain, Viking, Rs 595

 Readers keenly devour books on the lives of film stars, especially those from Bollywood. The Mumbai film industry has been to India what Hollywood has been to the West. The industry has churned out films that has satisfied many an unfulfilled desire, and it continues to play an important role in the life of the ordinary man. So when the focus is on the ?first family? of Indian cinema ? the Kapoors ? the interest is obviously widespread. Madhu Jain must have had this aspect in mind when she took up her pen to write on one of the most well-known and respected families in the Mumbai film world. 

 The book, as the title suggests, has an ambitious project in trying to follow the Kapoor clan for five generations. The difficulty with such a subject lies in the fact that most of the Kapoors had star status and they require a lot of space to be devoted to each of them.

 Jain starts with the Kapoor family?s passage to the dream city from Peshawar. The Kapoors were Pathans. She begins with Prithviraj Kapoor?s journey on the Frontier Mail in 1928 to Colaba with Rs 75 in his pocket and a hockey stick, and it ends with Karishma, Kareena and Ranbir Raj Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor?s son, all set to be part of Sanjay Leela Bhansali?s next film. 

 Jain divides the book into three parts ? Patriarch, Consolidators, and the Inheritors ? and takes up one actor after another to write about their lives, work and anecdotes that enliven the subject. Much of this is based on personal interviews. There is Prithviraj Kapoor, starring in the first talkie, Alam Ara, and his establishing the Prithvi theatre. The Kapoors have held on to the baton. Jain shows how the sons Raj, Shammi and Shashi dominated the Fifties and Sixties. Randhir and Rishi managed to survive the Rajesh Khanna-Amitabh era. And just when the public had written the Kapoors off, the girls, Karishma and Kareena stepped in to save the day for them.

 The book however is more about Prithviraj and Raj Kapoor than about the others, though Jain does devote space to the other brothers and the sons. Her motive seems to be to provide the reader information about the family, its work and lifestyle so that the reel life characters seem to peep out of the pages of the book. She has succeeded in doing that. There is no dearth of information on the individual members of the family, be it in the studio, at home, in lavish parties, or with their women. And the Kapoors do not disappoint. The book will be liked for its candid portrayal of the men. Take Raj Kapoor?s weakness for his heroines like Nargis, Vyajanthimala, Padmini, which is well-known. But few of us know about another who haunted the actor for quite sometime. 

 Jain is in her element when she writes about the men?s despondency and their loneliness despite the public life they led. Raj?s life is laid bare as well as his eccentricities. The Kapoors were never intellectually-inclined. Few made it to the college, or had much interest in education, expect for Shammi. 

 The Kapoors will be loved for their zest for life, cinema, food and women. The silver screen has been their obsession. Even when the great era of the Kapoors seems to be over, the present generation looks to the celluloid world for salvation. Jain writes in a language that is simple and pithy. The book has beautiful photographs, some rare. It will keep alive public interest in the Kapoors who refuse to call it a day.

 LONG MARCH

 The visit of the Chinese president, Mr Hu Jintao, to India is somewhat ill-timed. This is not because of the much-publicized controversy over Arunachal Pradesh, which, it is alleged, will loom over the discussions Mr Hu has with the Indian prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. That controversy could be less than a side-show in the meetings. The cause for pessimism is much more fundamental. In Asia, India and China are competing for the same political and economic space. The possibilities of adjustments within this overall contradiction are restricted because of several factors. One of these is the progress made in the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America. While India and the US are very keen to push through this deal and to get it accepted in the various relevant fora, China is unwilling to approve of this deal, in its present form, at the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Chinas objections to the Indo-US nuclear deal were finalized before Mr Hus Delhi trip. If this is indeed the case, the Chinese president may well discover that his governments stand on this issue is an obstacle to other issues that will come up for discussion during his visit. The context is thus a trifle inimical for the success of the visit.

 The most obvious agenda of Mr Hus visit is the economic one. China would obviously like Indias markets to open up to its own products. Chinas thrust is to push India to recognize it as a market economy under the World Trade Organization which would pave the way for a free-trade agreement between the two countries. India may not have any principled objections to such a treaty, but it would certainly like to protect its own economic interests. At the present juncture, in any economic agreement between India and China, the former will inevitably be the weaker partner. China is Indias second largest trading partner, but India is number 11 in Chinas list of trading partners. Moreover, 90 per cent of Chinas imports from India are raw materials bought in bulk. But 35 per cent of Chinas exports to India are high-value electronic goods and machinery. There is also Indias trade deficit hovering at the $ 2 billion mark to consider. This will grow five-fold if tariffs against imports are dropped. Mr Hus visit is thus plagued by some fundamental problems, which will be compounded if he displays too much camaraderie in Islamabad. The India chapter of the visit promises to be high on rhetoric and trivial on substance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FAILING AGAIN

 Litmus tests are usually unsparing indicators, and Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government seems to be failing the most important one. The governments stance with regard to tomorrows industrial strike lacks all the positive indications that the chief ministers earlier initiatives on similar occasions had begun to promise. That tomorrows strike has been called by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, the labour wing of Mr Bhattacharjees own party, makes his failure all the more lamentable and dangerous for West Bengal. It appears that the chief ministers increasingly firm conviction that bandhs would spell doom for Bengal can be implemented only when it comes to disruptions from the opposition parties and their labour wings. When it comes to his own party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Mr Bhattacharjees clarity and firmness suddenly seem to desert him, and his stance becomes uncertain and watered down. There has only been the assurance to the public that they will not be forcibly hindered from going to work. On earlier occasions, Mr Bhattacharjee has used his authority as chief minister to ensure, in no uncertain terms, that the police and the public transport system would work through a bandh to make it possible for people in the IT sector to carry on working. And he has even managed to deliver his promise to the people. But such a commitment is absent this time.

 To deem the IT sector as deserving to be protected from a culture of violence and non-performance spoke of a vision of the future of Bengal that prioritized economic development over unthinking populism and party-political imperatives. Such a privileging of the IT sector might have struck some as lopsided in its own way. The people of West Bengal, whatever be their profession, have a right to be able to go to work and live their everyday lives without state-sponsored hindrance. Yet, whatever be the faults in the chief ministers logic in those earlier instances, his support of a work ethic had raised the hopes of a state whose citizens had begun to show their own resistance to a culture of disruptiveness. On Thursday, thanks to the states passivity, an industrial strike will become a bandh. By regressing to an older ethos Mr Bhattacharjee will not only dash hopes, but also perhaps hasten his states and his own unmaking.

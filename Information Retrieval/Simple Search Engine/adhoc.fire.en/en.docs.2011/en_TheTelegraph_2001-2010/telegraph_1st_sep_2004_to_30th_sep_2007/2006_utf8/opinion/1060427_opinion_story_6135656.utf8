 Letters to Editor

 Bitter harvest

 Sir ? History and myth have several instances of the success of one brother making the other insecure (?Praveen calm, plot fuzzy?, April 24). The spectacular rise of Pramod Mahajan as a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and his extravagant lifestyle must have hit his less successful younger brother hard. Unable to take his brother?s success in his stride, Praveen Mahajan vented his ire by shooting Pramod point blank. In the cutthroat world of politics, there might not be any permanent friends, but now it seems that ties of blood cannot be trusted either.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is ironic that while the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, and its senior leader, L.K. Advani, are on the Bharat Suraksha Yatra, the suraksha or security of one of its most prominent leaders has been violated ? that too in his own home and at the hands of his own brother. Pramod Mahajan?s flaunting of his status was meant to underline his difference from the man on the streets. If Praveen Mahajan had been less fortunate in his professional life than his brother, as the case seems to be, then the latter?s crass display of wealth could have easily got on his nerves. This is not to condone his act, but Pramod Mahajan must have had the same effect on not only his brother but on many others lower in station to him. But this is perhaps not the time to indulge in such speculations with Pramod Mahajan battling for his life in hospital. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? It is good to see politicians forgetting their rivalry for a while and coming together in wishing Pramod Mahajan a speedy recovery. However, the real motive behind the attack on the BJP leader remains fuzzy. The attacker, Mahajan?s own brother, must have been in a disturbed state, being irrationally jealous of his elder brother?s success. If this be the cause of the shooting, then, instead of punishing him, it would be better to forgive him and integrate him into the family. The fact that Praveen Mahajan surrendered after the crime shows that he was not trying to run away from the police. Cases of sibling rivalry are not uncommon and psychological counselling is usually more helpful in such cases than legal chastisement. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is quite outrageous for a brother to have attempted to kill his sibling in cold blood. At the same time, cases of brothers getting at each other?s throat are not unheard of. In fact, this only lends support to the pessimistic view that fame and power prevail over social and familial ties.

 Yours faithfully,

Abu Salim, Darjeeling

 Sir ? The attempt on Pramod Mahajan?s life by his brother is shocking. But even more appalling is the way in which the media has handled the incident. All the news channels are giving minute-by-minute updates of Mahajan?s condition as if his health were the only question to explore. Would the media have spared a fraction of this attention had the victim been an ordinary man? Only a few days ago, Mohammed Javed, a teenager who had saved six children from the fire at the Meerut fair, died for want of proper treatment. Discrepant treatment like these erode people?s faith in the basic democratic credo of equality.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? A day after Pramod Mahajan was shot at by his brother, Gitanjali, the wife of actor Navin Nischol, committed suicide. The reason, apparently, was Nishchol?s cruel eviction from his own property by his brother, incidentally also called Pravin. Media investigations into the Mahajan case have revealed that Pramod Mahajan had not only brought up Pravin, but also got him a flat and tried to help him in his business ventures. In Nischol?s case too, it appears that his brother had hoodwinked him by abusing the Transfer of Property Act. More human beings tend to bite the hand that feeds them than we care to admit.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Deshpande, Nagpur

 Sir ? The surge of popular emotion over Pramod Mahajan?s attempted murder goes to prove that no matter how much the politicians deceive us, we continue to shower our love on them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 No small problem

 Sir ? The points raised by Tarunabh Khaitan cannot be over-emphasized (?Still a matter of shame?, April 24). It is indeed a disgrace that though Indian children continue to suffer sexual abuse, the legal remedies are still inadequate. Khaitan is right in attributing the reason for this to our urge to push an unpleasant social problem under the rug. Hence, sexual exploitation of children, especially those who are homeless, continues unchecked under the nose of our law-enforcers. Adults with a perverse sexual appetite are the most dangerous. The law should be harshest towards these paedophiles, many of whom roam freely in our society. The report, ?Street kids are HIV bridge population? (Sept 5), revealed that a large number of homeless children in Calcutta contract HIV/AIDS from sexual exploitation on the streets. The government is doubly to blame for being unable to provide shelters for these children and for failing to make laws that deter sexual predators. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

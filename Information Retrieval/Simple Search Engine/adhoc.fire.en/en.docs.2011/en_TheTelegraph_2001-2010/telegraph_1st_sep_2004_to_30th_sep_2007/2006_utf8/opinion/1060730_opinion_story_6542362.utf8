The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ROLL CALL OF DISHONOUR

 Accusations without substance are irresponsible. Accusations to play petty politics is another name for opportunism. The plight that Mr Jaswant Singh has brought upon himself bears out both the generalizations made above. He must be a unique author in that after having written a book, which he claims is selling like the proverbial hot cake, he has to announce that he regrets having written the book. This situation grows out of an accusation that Mr Singh makes in his book, A Call to Honour: In Service of Emergent India. He wrote that he had incontrovertible evidence that there was a mole in the secretariat of P.V. Narasimha Rao when he was prime minister. To date, Mr Singh has been unable to name the mole, he has thrown out tantalizing clues to the media, which have fuelled speculation and presumably the sales of his book. Mr Singh, if he sincerely believes in serving his country, should name the mole and produce the evidence. This is the least that he can do if he has to prove that he is a man of honour. Mr Singh says he was aware of the existence of the mole even when he was a cabinet minister in the government of India. The inevitable question that arises is: what did he do with the knowledge? Did he take any action? Did he inform his prime minister, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee? The answer to the questions is in the negative. Mr Singh sat on the knowledge concerning treason only to refer to it in his memoirs. Not to put too fine a point on it, Mr Singh failed in his duty as minister and as a servant to the nation. But Mr Singh is an honourable man. He regrets he wrote the book. He does not regret his failure to do his duty.

 The embarrassment that Mr Singh has caused is evident from the fact that none of the Bharatiya Janata Party top brass attended the release function of his book in New Delhi. This is another measure of Mr Singh?s irresponsibility. He did not even pause to think what impact his ?revelations? would have on the reputation of the quondam National Democratic Alliance government and on his erstwhile senior cabinet colleagues, like Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani. It would appear that nobody save Mr Singh?s publisher has gained from the proceedings. Mr Singh?s post facto declaration of regret only makes matters worse. It shows him up to be a thoughtless person who writes without thinking of consequences and then lacks the resources to back up his allegation.

 It would of course be unfair to excoriate Mr Singh alone. The absence of principles that he has displayed is a feature of India?s political class. Witness how the BJP opposes the Indo-US nuclear deal when the entire process of cosying up to the US was started when the BJP was in power. The Congress, when it was in opposition, spoke against disinvestments and now champions it. Support and opposition to policies are thus not based on principles but on sheer opportunism and a complete disregard for principles. Mr Singh?s revelations are touched by the same tar. Politicians may be called by anything save honour.

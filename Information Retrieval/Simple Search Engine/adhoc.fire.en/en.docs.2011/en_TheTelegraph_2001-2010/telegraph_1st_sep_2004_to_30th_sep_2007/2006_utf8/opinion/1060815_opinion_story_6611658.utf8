The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN EXCHANGE

 Goodwill gestures make sense only if they are reciprocated. There is nothing objectionable about New Delhis gesture of temporarily suspending the counter-insurgency operations by the army in Assam. Only superficially, it is a pre-Independence Day gesture to the United Liberation Front of Asom. The real context must be the initiative to persuade the rebel outfit to join the peace talks. True, the Ulfa, like several other insurgent groups in the North-east, routinely call for a boycott of the Independence Day celebrations. It is also true that, despite sporadic violence, such calls rarely receive a popular response. It would be wrong, therefore, to see the decision to suspend the armys operations as an attempt to avoid such violence. It should be seen as a political move to take the current peace initiative further. The questions as to whether it is actually a ceasefire or how long it will last are secondary to this central concern. The curious thing about the decision is that it comes at a time when the violence unleashed by the Ulfa has increased. That explains why even sections in the state government or the army are somewhat surprised at New Delhis decision. Clearly, the Centre sees it as a gamble worth the risks. 

 The onus now is on the Ulfa to respond to the governments gesture. Whether it allows the people to peacefully participate in the Independence Day celebrations will give some indication of its response. But the really positive response would be the rebels participation in the peace talks. The Ulfa-appointed peoples consultative committee has been arguing that a ceasefire could set the stage for the rebels direct participation in the peace talks. It is up to these chosen members of the Assamese civil society to persuade the Ulfa to do so. The Centres decision has given them an opportunity that the rebels should not miss if they are really serious about giving peace a chance. Even the Ulfas other demand the release of five of its leaders from prison should not be a major problem for New Delhi if the rebels decide to join the talks table. Whichever way the rebels decide will make or mar the chances of an early resolution of the conflict in Assam. For far too long Assam has seen innocent people being killed, oil pipelines being blown off and the violence holding the states economy to ransom. Peace and dialogue may give Assam an identity that the rebellion never can.

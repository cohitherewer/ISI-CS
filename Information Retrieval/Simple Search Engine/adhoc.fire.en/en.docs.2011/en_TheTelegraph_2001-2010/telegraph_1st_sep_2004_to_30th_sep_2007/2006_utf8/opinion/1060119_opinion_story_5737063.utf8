 INDIA EXPECTS

 There is little that can be done to help an organization which does not know its own importance. The Board of Control for Cricket in India has profoundly underestimated its own stature by undertaking a commitment to make a joint bid ? with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. It is difficult to comprehend why the BCCI believes that it cannot make a bid on its own. Why does it need the helping hand of the other south Asian countries? One obvious answer is that this is a tactical move. A joint bid automatically reduces opposition since the representatives of the four countries will be on one side. This assumes that India is not in a position to command support on its own and thus needs to shore up support through the politics of concessions and give-andtake. From any point of view ? choice of venue, financial clout, infrastructural facilities, popularity of cricket ? the BCCI scores by a great many points over its three chosen partners.

 What makes India?s eagerness for a joint bid look somewhat pathetic is the fact that a country like England does not ever think of making a joint bid for the Cricket World Cup. England bid on its own for the last World Cup despite the fact that at that point of time, the popularity of cricket in the country was on the decline. This did not deter England. It saw cricket as its own national game and put in a bid which it won. Yet the BCCI, representing a country many times the size of England, has to seek the assistance of three other countries to win the auction. Apart from India?s geographical size, the BCCI is wealthier than the English cricket board. The money that the BCCI can rake in through sponsorships and the sale of television rights is much more than what its competitors and allies can. Cricket has also emerged as India?s national game. But these factors have not imparted any confidence to the BCCI, which continues to suffer from an inferiority complex. This can only be interpreted as the white man?s curse.

 The BCCI must also realize that it is out of tune with the mood of confidence that now grips India in other spheres. Indian industrial houses are busy acquiring businesses abroad, and they are doing this on their own without seeking allies in other south Asian countries. At the level of foreign policy, India sees itself as an eminently suitable candidate for a permanent seat in the security council of the United Nations. In many other international fora, India behaves in the manner of the big boys and commands for itself a position at the high table. But when it comes to cricket, the BCCI relegates itself to a seat below the salt. By underestimating its own position and strength, the BCCI not only harms itself, it also hurts the pride of most Indians. The BCCI should remember that India expects.

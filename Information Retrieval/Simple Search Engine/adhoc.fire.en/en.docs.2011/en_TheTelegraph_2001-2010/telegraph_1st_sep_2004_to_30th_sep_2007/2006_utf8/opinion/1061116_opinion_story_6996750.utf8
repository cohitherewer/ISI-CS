 Letters to Editor

 Familiar faces

 Sir The British Hindu-turned-Muslim, Dhiren Barot, has been jailed for life for plotting terrorist attacks in Britain and the United States of America (Hindu Qaida, Nov 8). The point to note is that Barot will be in jail for at least 40 years before he is considered for parole. Not long ago, the former chief executive officer of Enron, a multinational US company, was also given the same punishment. Why cannot India adopt similar laws? We could then abolish the death penalty as well as a so-called life sentence, which extends for 14 years. Dangerous criminals and those guilty of heinous crimes should be in jail till death. Concurrent terms should be added to their sentences if they are guilty of multiple crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The headline, Hindu Qaida, is misleading. Apart from taking a swipe at Hindus, it is also factually incorrect. The person in question is a Muslim and not a Hindu, as is obvious from the report itself. Although Barot was born a Hindu, he had converted to Islam and then contemplated his terrorist actions. Therefore, for all technical purposes, it is unfair to still call him a Hindu. Maximum shock value cannot be the only factor determining news headlines. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Binola, Mumbai

 Sir It is improper to use the nomenclature Hindu Qaida since Dhiren Barot, aka Bilal aka Abu Musa al-Hindi, is not a Hindu but a Muslim. He would have been a Hindu Qaida only if he had acted and/or killed in the name of Hinduism.

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir Although it is not clear why Dhiren Barot converted to Islam and what impact Islam had on him, what cannot be denied is that Barots criminal instincts were sharpened after the conversion. In fact, the terrorist outfit he worked for is responsible for turning him into a criminal. But he certainly was not a Hindu when he plotted to bomb the London Underground tube or the Heathrow Express. Nor did he go to Pakistan for his training as a Hindu. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Dhiren Barots case shows how the youth, irrespective of their religious affiliation, can be motivated to carry out dangerous acts. Barots obsession with the idea of creating mayhem, his much-calculated conversion, which opened for him the gateway to terrorist hideouts, his plans for carrying out violent acts show his criminal propensity. His trainers were only using his potential. Terror groups throughout the world depend on the strengths (and weaknesses) of people like Barot to shed blood, and this is not typical of any one religious group.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Sikdar, Calcutta

 Still helpless

 Sir The West Bengal government is not serious about implementing the Right to Information Act at all (No Questions, Nov 10). In the Marxist lexicon, democracy means a democracy dictated by the party. This is the real reason for the Left Fronts non-implementation of a law that gives people the right to know about various things directly, thereby making the party redundant. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Both the political and bureaucratic establishment in West Bengal are hostile to the RTI Act. Given the well-entrenched corruption in the state, an implementation of the act would clash with the self-interests of too many big and powerful individuals and institutions. The passing of the act itself was a struggle in parliament. And now, individual state governments and those with vested interests will do everything in their power to ensure a delay in the proper use of the law. The big fry are afraid of being exposed. And the small fry, the clerical staff for example, are too ensconced in the corrupt structure and too comfortable with the status quo to let go of things. 

 The government clerk takes immense delight in inconveniencing those who he is supposed to serve. The RTI Act empowers their victims to stop this harassment. Why then should he, and his party (most government workers in Bengal swear their allegiance to the ruling party) allow that to happen? What is particularly disconcerting for the residents and voters of this state is that the Centre will not lift a finger against the Left Front since the present incumbents in New Delhi exercise their power owing to the lefts charity. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.N. Ganguly, Durgapur

 Road show

 Sir On my way to college the other day, a clammy hand determinedly brushed against my body at the Sealdah railway station. Such an experience is not new to girls like me who have to move about regularly. However, what continues to surprise is the way people treat victims of sexual molestation in public. She is often viewed with contempt and sarcasm, and her clothes scrutinized whether it is the acceptable salwar kameez or unbecoming pair of jeans that has caused the misbehaviour. The crime of the molester is of little significance here. I had expected that the crowd milling around me in the Sealdah station would help me take the rogue to the nearby railway police booth. But their looks of disapproval directed at me and the frivolous admonition of the offender made a mockery of my efforts. In the end, I was made to feel that I should not have protested at all.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Barik, Dum Dum

 Sir Married women now seem more secure than those who have not tied the knot. There is a powerful legislation they can lean on in cases of domestic violence. Out of home, their marital status often makes them less susceptible to sexual molestation than unmarried women. Even if it does take place, the vermillion exempts them from motives which young girls are suspected of enticing men into misbehaving with them. Presumably, married women are already private property. The violation of their bodies thus arouses more public ire than does that of single women whose bodies have no single claimant.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

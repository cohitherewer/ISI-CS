 VEILED THREAT

 Scarcely has a request ever evoked such an overwhelming sense of gratitude among those to whom it was not made. Mr Jack Straw, former British foreign secretary and candidate for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, seems to have brought tremendous relief to his nation by daring to ask Muslim women to consider giving up the veil in order to facilitate better communication. He has even received fulsome praise from the prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, and leading public figures for bringing up what is believed to be a difficult issue, made doubly difficult by their own double standards. Mr Straw promotes his plea, made known through a newspaper article, on the basis of his larger concerns. Administrative, for one. But why a garb worn by a minuscule section in a minority community should be an impediment to the fulfilling of his public responsibilities is not known. His second concern is the promotion of greater integration among communities. It is doubtful if denying a particular section of citizens the right to bear markers of their cultural identity can help the cause of social cohesion. Contrary to Mr Straws plans, such a denial might add to the siege mentality of the community, further polarize British society and encourage the fundamentalist forces his government is trying so hard to combat. 

 Mr Straw seizes the veil to show off his sensitiveness to gender issues. By helping Muslim women remove the veil, he wants to help them rescind a socially-oppressive dogma. Is he not undermining the right to freedom of choice by doing so? Women have often gone to law courts to fight for their right to embrace such distinctive signs of their religion a phenomenon not easily explained by the secular wisdom that informs Mr Straws efforts. That is probably why strictly political conflicts over religion continue to be fought in contravention of womens rights.

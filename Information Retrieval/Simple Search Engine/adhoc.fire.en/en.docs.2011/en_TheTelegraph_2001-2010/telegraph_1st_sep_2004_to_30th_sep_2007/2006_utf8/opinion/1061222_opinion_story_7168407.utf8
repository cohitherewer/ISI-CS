 OVERHEATING

 Although the mid-term review of the finance ministry strenuously resists using the word overheating, there are clear signs that rapidly rising demand is bumping against capacity in a growing number of sectors. The clearest signs come from agriculture. Inflation in primary commodities is hovering around 7 per cent per annum higher than in the previous ten years. Wheat stocks in September were 3.8 million tons down from the 10 million tons a year ago, despite imports of 5.5 million tons. For the past six years, foodgrains production has been bumping against a ceiling of 210 million tons. For a while it looked as if Indians had got too rich and did not need to eat more rice or wheat. But now that the boom has put some money in consumers pockets, their demand is raising prices.

 Agricultural inflation may be attributed to slow growth of supply. But industrial production rose by 11 per cent in the year to September, and yet inflation in manufactured products rose to 4.8 per cent against 1.7 per cent a year ago. The construction boom has strained cement capacity; cement prices rose 12 per cent. Although the worst is over in oil products, petrol and diesel prices have continued to rise; the prices of kerosene and LPG have not risen only because the government has absorbed the rise in their cost. The Reserve Bank of India has been concerned about the inflationary trends; it has raised interest rates and the cash reserve ratio to tighten monetary policy. But its efforts have been frustrated by the government. Thanks to the revenue buoyancy, government has been borrowing less, and interest rates have come down as a result. The governments prosperity is downright embarrassing. The only dark cloud is the widening current account deficit. But foreigners are pouring capital into the country; as a result, foreign exchange reserves continue to rise. When, earlier this year, a rise in exchange reserves was adding excessively to domestic liquidity, the RBI had to issue market stabilization bonds and borrow money that the government did not need. In the circumstances, it would be natural for the government to sit back and enjoy its good fortune. And the review does consider the danger of overheating only to dismiss it. The government clearly thinks that India has entered a long period of high growth and is cruising with full sails into a glorious future.

 Even if the government were right, it would be sad if it lost its caution. Whether it poses any immediate risk or not, the excessive buoyancy of the economy is a matter of concern, and the correct policy posture at the present juncture is a deflationary one. A deflationary stance has the additional benefit that it will reduce the fiscal deficit faster, and bring closer the day when the government will not need to borrow and can set the capital market free.

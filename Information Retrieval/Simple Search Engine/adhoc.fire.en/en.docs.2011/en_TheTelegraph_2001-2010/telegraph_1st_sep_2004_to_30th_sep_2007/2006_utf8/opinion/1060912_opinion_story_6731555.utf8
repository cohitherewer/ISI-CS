 MOVING TIME

 Transition or regicide? The British Labour Party is trying to pull itself out of a public nervous breakdown (as a Labour backbencher puts it) over how Mr Tony Blair will choose to play out his exit from the partys, and the countrys, leadership. That an alarming number in the parliamentary party is impatient to see Mr Blair go has been made quite brutally clear to the prime minister over the last week. A junior defence minister and several parliamentary private secretaries have resigned in protest against Mr Blairs dogged refusal to make public a date of departure. These resignations followed what Mr Blair has called a round-robin letter to him from the rebels, subsequently leaked to the press, explicitly stating that only a change in leadership would ensure Labours victory in the next elections, including those in Wales and Scotland. Mr Blair has found this letter disloyal, discourteous and wrong, while the word blackmail seems to have found his endorsement in describing the role played by Mr Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, in pressuring him to step down and make public his stepping-down plans. The Blairites and the Brownites are appearing to threaten seriously the image and integrity of the Labour Party, and things are generally beginning to look rather disgracefully fractious.

 There is not much evidence though that a change in leadership makes a great deal of difference to a partys electoral performance. Besides, the ongoing squabbles the prime ministers vanity versus the chancellors ego do not show either in a particularly favourable light. There is a growing voice now, within the party, urging both men and their alleged followers to rise above this unsavouriness and get on with their usual business. That seems to be the best way to secure the partys fate, especially since its opponents have been steadily pulling themselves up to a strength that must now be reckoned with. Yet, in spite of what good taste dictates in terms of departure or succession, this turmoil within the party does show up the extent to which Mr Blair has relinquished control over his own political destiny in the course of his prime ministership. The consequences of Iraq have been unfortunate. A man who is being deemed unfit to lead his party must also have forfeited his claims to leading a democracy.

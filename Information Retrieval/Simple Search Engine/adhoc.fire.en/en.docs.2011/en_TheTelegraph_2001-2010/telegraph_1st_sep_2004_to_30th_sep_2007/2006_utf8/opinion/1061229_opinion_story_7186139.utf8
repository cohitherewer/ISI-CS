 Letters to Editor

 Welcome back

 Sir Sourav Ganguly, who is on a comeback trail, seems to have settled down in the Indian side (Sourav returns to outstanding team, Dec 18). The coach has spoken highly of him, and the captain was also full of praise for his batting after the victory in Johannesburg. The fact remains that Ganguly has made his way back to the side by sheer grit and determination. Some selectors had even suggested that he retires, but the former skipper, never one to lose confidence in his own abilities, worked hard, scored runs in domestic cricket, and came back in contention. Cricket is a game of glorious uncertainties. Many players simply fade away after getting dropped from the side. Not Ganguly though. He has shown that he still has enough cricket left in him. Ganguly is now being hailed from all quarters after his performance in the first test. But one must remember that he has only been recalled because the team has not been doing well recently. It is doubtful whether Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid would have looked in his direction if India had won the one-dayers in the West Indies and South Africa.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasish Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is not for his batting skills that Sourav Ganguly has made it back to the Indian team, but because of its lack of bench strength. If one were to go through the history of cricket, one would see that every cricketer has gone through a bad patch at some point in his career. Ganguly, too, is no exception. The left-hander found himself out of the team after suffering a prolonged slump. In South Africa, he batted well in the first test match. But it would not be correct to judge him on the basis of his performance in one match. His real test will be to score consistently in the remaining test matches against a South African side looking for revenge after being beaten in the first test.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir There is no doubt that Sourav Ganguly has regained his fitness and form. He scored 80-odd runs in a first-class fixture and followed it up with decent scores in the first test match. More important, the fifty that Ganguly scored in the first innings came at a time when some of his teammates were struggling to get runs. The former captain has not only justified his selection but also proved to the selectors and the coach that experienced players are more likely to come good in unfamiliar conditions than the pack of youngsters who only deliver on benign Indian pitches. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arghyasree Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir That Sourav Ganguly has returned to international cricket in style is certainly welcome news. But the hullabaloo surrounding his selection for the tour of South Africa goes to show that Ganguly has managed to find a place in the team not entirely because of cricketing reasons. Pressure from politicians as well as the media played a crucial role in the selectors decision to bring back the former captain. Ironically, the clamour for Gangulys re-induction will put him in a spot. He will be under considerable pressure to perform. And, if he fails to score runs and take wickets, there will be more noise. Only this time, critics will be asking for his head. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bishan Sahai, Calcutta

 Sir Now that Ganguly has scored a few runs in the first test, cricket lovers are understandably singing his praise. But what is surprising is that they have not bothered to notice the performance of another old hand, V.V.S. Laxman, whose half-century in the second innings turned the match in Indias favour. This kind of attitude on the part of supporters as well as selectors is one of the main reasons why a classy player like Laxman continues to be one of the most underrated cricketers in the country. It is a pity that cricket-lovers in India are yet to learn to give credit where it is due. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada

 Sir The miraculous turnaround in Indias fortunes during the first test in South Africa has been brought about by stellar performances from veterans like Laxman and Ganguly. Incidentally, both the players had found themselves out in the cold after the coach, Greg Chappell, started his policy to replace older, experienced players by youngsters. Laxmans and Gangulys contributions to Indias first-ever win on South African soil have exposed the limitations of Chappells policy. Yet, as Mukul Kesavan points out in The Wanderers (Dec 21), Ganguly and Laxman managed to regain their place only because India had been beaten comprehensively in the oneday series that preceded the test matches. Future cricket historians would surely confer on Laxman the mantle of a tragic hero. As for Ganguly, he will be remembered as someone who taught the world the importance of having belief in oneself.

 Yours faithfully,

Susobhan Sarkar, Calcutta

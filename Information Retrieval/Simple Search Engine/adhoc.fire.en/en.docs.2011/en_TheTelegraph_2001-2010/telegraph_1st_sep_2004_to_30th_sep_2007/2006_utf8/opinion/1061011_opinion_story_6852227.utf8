 LIFE AND DEATH AND OTHER TUPENNY ACHES

 CENTENARY TRIBUTE

 At hundred, Beckett is stirring still. But was he one of the masters?

 Hundred years would have made little difference to Samuel Becketts face. In most of his mature photographs, his sunken, hawk-like eyes framed by his gaunt Irish visage are timeless in their coldness. His face, from his middle years, had started resembling W. H. Audens famous self-description a wedding cake left in the rain. Ever loyal to pessimism, his philosophy had become irredeemably nihilistic, and humanity one long sigh of despair: Oh all to end, he concluded his last work, Stirrings Still.

 The dual senses of end conclusion and purpose must have been crucial for a wordsmith like Beckett. So many of his best works including the best known, Waiting for Godot and Endgame are about the interminable waiting for closure, and wondering all along what it would bring. Sometimes the end, when it finally arrives, is clouded in mystery. The wait for Godot is riddled with uncertainties, just as the search for the true messiah in the Bible was: Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another? the disciples of Jesus had wondered, faced with their saviour for the first time.

 Becketts endings are without comfort, often disintegrating into fragments, interspersed with ever-increasing pauses. The texts are often full of grunts and groans, troubled outpourings, most powerful in their inarticulacy. Happy Days, for instance, is uttered, rather ironically, by a voice crying in the wilderness. In his disdain for ordered language, Beckett was unequivocal. Writing to a friend in 1937, he commented: To me [grammar and style] seem to have become as irrelevant as a Victorian bathing suit or the imperturbability of a true gentleman...As we cannot eliminate language all at once, we should at least leave nothing undone that might contribute to its falling into disrepute...I cannot imagine a higher goal for a writer today. This, of course, was written during the peak of World War II, a time when, alongside the monuments of civilization, intangibles were also falling apart. Becketts response to the war, though full of horror, was devoid of sentimentality. He spoke of his final duty at the Hospital of the Irish Red Cross in Saint-L in France exterminating rats from the maternity and childrens wards as his last personal act of war.

 The 1910s to the Thirties also saw the rise of Russian formalism pioneered by theorists like Viktor Shklovsky and Roman Jakobson which challenged the very foundations of ordinary language. Then there was James Joyce, the old master of post-modernism, a hero among aspiring young, Irish writers. Beckett befriended Joyce around 1927, shortly after taking his B.A. from Trinity College, Dublin. 

 As a writer and human being, Joyce was formative for Becketts literary personality. Beckett was devoted to Joyce, about whom he wrote an essay during his early twenties. He also became Joyces amanuensis for a while, taking dictation for and copying down parts of what would eventually become Finnegans Wake. His relationship with Joyce came to a rather sordid end when he failed to reciprocate his mentors daughters advances. 

 In his desire for apartness his friend, Emil Cioran, described him as this separate man Beckett was no different from his literary predecessors, Joyce and Oscar Wilde, both of whom had attained notoriety in their lifetime. His larger fantasy was to be one of the great European masters, particularly Proust and Kafka. He was meticulous in his self-fashioning by living in France, writing bilingually, being chronically maladjusted to people and places trying his best to attain the coveted European eccentricity. 

 The co-existence of multiple genres in Becketts works is everywhere: burlesque, vaudeville, the music hall, commedia dellarte, and the silent-film style of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. His minimalism is at once starkly funny and tragically moving. In Krapps Last Tape (1959), an old man sits alone in his room all night, listening to tape recordings from various periods of his past, a scene which has been revisited many times since, most memorably in recent times by Jim Jarmusch in one of the vignettes in his twelve-part film, Coffee and Cigarrettes (1998).

 Fighting against mortal loneliness, caught perpetually in a time-warp, Beckett was, with age, getting close to reality. At seventy-six he said, With diminished concentration, loss of memory, obscured intelligence...the more chance there is for saying something closest to what one really is. His estimation of the ends of human life was unqualifiedly tinged with scepticism, expressed beautifully in one of his poems: they come/ different and the same/ with each it is different and the same/ with each the absence of love is different/ with each the absence of love is the same.

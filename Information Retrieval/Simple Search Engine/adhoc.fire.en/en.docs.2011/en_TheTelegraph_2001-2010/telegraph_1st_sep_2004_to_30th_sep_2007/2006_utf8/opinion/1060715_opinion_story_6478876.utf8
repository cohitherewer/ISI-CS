 In hot pursuit

 Sir ? The attempt of the Gujarat government to prosecute Aamir Khan for filming a chinkara seven years back for his much-acclaimed film, Lagaan, is ridiculous and vindictive, to say the least (?Aamir under scanner?, July 13). There is no evidence that the animal died. And if anything, Gujaratis should be grateful to Khan for bringing the natural beauty of their state to international attention. But triviality is what attracts governments and law-enforcers most. Which is why they fail to gather the necessary information before terrorist attacks. When will they stop getting bogged down by the letter of the law and start to appreciate its spirit?

 Yours faithfully,

 Aroup Chatterjee, London

 Grounded

 Sir ? The promotionals for many of our airlines should read as follows: ?Welcome to India?s low cost airlines. Welcome everyone. Welcome terrorists, for you don?t need a proof of your identity to fly with us.? On June 11, 2006, I boarded an Air Deccan flight to Mumbai from Delhi. Next to me was a fellow passenger flying on his friend?s identity. He was the man who had helped me through the entire ?checking-in? procedure which was an hour-and-a half of complete madness. The man had been ready to get the tickets changed. But with so much confusion and chaos, he decided against it. Does the airline realize that if there were an air crash, it is his friend who would be dead on paper, and not he? 

 When I was checking in, I smiled at the lady who issued me my boarding pass. I told her, ?I could have been a terrorist?. And yet, she did not ask me for a proof of my identity. 

 After landing in Mumbai, I learnt from two Israeli men that they too had not been asked for any proof of their identity. This was not the first time I had heard of such a thing. I was on holiday with a British citizen and flying to Leh by Indian Airlines on May 31, 2006. Since Jammu and Kashmir is a region plagued by terrorism, we had expected that there would be tight security at the Delhi airport. But, again, no questions were asked. We boarded the flight. No identification was required. We were aghast. 

 At one point, we agreed to swap our tickets. My British friend informed me that when she was flying to Leh last year, she had not been asked to fill in any form that required an identification. She was, in fact, petrified and appalled by the fact that she was travelling to a region of political unrest and yet nobody cared to check the identity of persons boarding the plane. 

 Although we were made to identify our bags before flying out, that hardly made a difference. If a terrorist had managed to board the plane under someone else?s name there was no chance of the airline ever being able to locate the person. Even if they did manage to identify the person, how would they know the true identity of the man? Meanwhile, in the plane, my friend and I travelled as two different persons and nobody checked us out.

 It is not just Air Deccan or Indian Airlines which are prone to such laxity. In the course of the last two months, I have flown to Calcutta by Jet Airways and have come back to Mumbai by Kingfisher Airlines. Again, I was not asked to prove my identity. The airline industry in India is booming. New companies are coming in and the older ones are trying to live up to the competition. But why have they forgotten the basic security issues? While ensuring a luxurious flying experience, why has Vijay Mallya forgotten to ensure the basic security norms for his customers? It takes two seconds to see the photo identity of a passenger. But maybe we are asking for too much. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Neha Harlalka, Mumbai

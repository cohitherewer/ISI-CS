 Unequal concern

 Special concern

Sir The fact that the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has gone on record saying that minorities, especially Muslims, must have the first claim on resources is shocking indeed (Sparks over minorities-first thrust, Dec 10). This only goes to show that power-hungry politicians will go to any extent to appease minorities so that they can cling on to power. One would like to know whether this is the real objective of the secular policy that the Congress keeps talking about? 

 Perhaps, there is case for the prime minister to follow Mulayam Singh, who believes that efforts to promote economic development will be futile unless equal opportunity to all sections of the society is made available. This is undoubtedly a far more pragmatic approach than Singhs. It should not be forgotten that when a minority community demands something from the country, it must also learn to give back in equal measure. Therefore, if Muslims want a greater share of national resources, they should stop demanding preferential treatment and follow the laws that govern other religious communities. What is happening in India is negative discrimination and it does not portend well for the future of the country. Such statements from the prime minister will only help in dividing the nation.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Choudhury, Farmington Hills, US

 Sir With assembly elections due in Uttar Pradesh, the Congresss policy to appease Muslims has become very evident. This is clearly reflected in some of the initiatives that have been undertaken by the present government. Such gestures not only violate the principles of a secular state, but they also mislead Muslims into believing that the government is serious about their upliftment. The prime minister is expected to preside over the countrys governance and frame policies to achieve overall development. He is not in office to promote the interests of a particular community and gain political points.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshay, Secundarabad

 Second best

 Sir Shah Rukh Khan has replaced Amitabh Bachchan as the new host for the television show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, but this does not mean that the Badshah of Bollywood is better than Bachchan (Bachchan best, Dec 5). In fact, Shah Rukh has admitted that there can be no comparisons between him and his predecessor, who is certainly the best in the business. Despite his popularity, Shah Rukh has still not been able to dislodge Amitabh Bachchan as king of the film industry. Indeed, his humble remarks about Bachchan only goes to show that he has immense respect for the superstar. Bachchan has come a long way since his modest start to become what he is today. He is a living example of the fact that hard work always pays. It would be a good idea if Shah Rukh were to invite Bachchan to the show. The presence of the two superstars will surely improve the ratings of this programme. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir The hullabaloo in the media over Shah Rukh Khan replacing Amitabh Bachchan as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati will only add to the ratings of the episodes. This comes at the heels of tiresome comparisons between the original Don, featuring Bachchan, and the re-make, starring Shah Rukh, which had continue to try the patience of readers for quite a while. There is no doubt about the fact that Shah Rukh is a versatile actor. But comparing him with Big B is both unreasonable and unjustified. Both belong to different leagues and have different personalities. The media should leave these two gentlemen in peace and stop fanning an undesirable rivalry.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The report, Birdsong strikes city note (Dec 7) proves that the problems of overpopulation, unplanned development, industrialization and environmental pollution have led to drastic changes in bird habits. For instance, the poor birds have been forced to shorten their long, charming notes in order to adapt to urban noise. This has become a matter of concern for environmentalists. Given the destruction of bird habitat, there is a need for identifying Important Bird Areas, something that BirdLife International has done in a bid to save these winged creatures. It is true that some birds will succeed in adapting to the new environment but there will also be a few which will become extinct. Bird-lovers need to ensure that this does not happen. Otherwise the natural world will lose out on some birds and their sweet notes soon. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

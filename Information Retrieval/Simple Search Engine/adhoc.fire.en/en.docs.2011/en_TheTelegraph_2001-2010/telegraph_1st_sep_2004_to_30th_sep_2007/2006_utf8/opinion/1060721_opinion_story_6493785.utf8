 Letters to Editor

 With a little help

 Sir ? That India needs confirmation by the United Nations security council to be assured of the fact that Jammu and Kashmir belongs to the country is preposterous (?From UN mouth: J amp;K is India?s?, July17). The state of Jammu and Kashmir has always been an integral part of India, but politicians in this country have never laid enough stress on this point while airing their views to the world community since the time of Jawaharlal Nehru. As a result, India has not been able to generate a favourable global opinion on the Kashmir issue. It is a pity that after almost sixty years of independence, a small nation like Japan has to step in to reaffirm that terrorism in all forms is to be condemned and that Kashmir is rightfully a part of India. There is certainly no need for a UN certificate to prove that J amp;K is a part of India. Besides, it is disheartening to note that it was only because of the blasts in Mumbai that the UN came up with such a declaration. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Indians should be proud of the fact that finally they have got a prime minister who sticks to his ground amid pressure. Manmohan Singh?s forthright condemnation of the violence in Jammu and Kashmir and Mumbai was one of the factors that led to the security council?s historic declaration that Jammu and Kashmir belongs to India. But a UN mandate is unlikely to bring the frequent terror strikes to an end. The prime minister needs the support of all the countries in the world to wage a successful war against terror. Many nations have professed their support for India by speaking out against the violence. But they have failed to take decisive action when it comes to curbing terrorism in this country. American diplomats, in fact, think twice before taking any action that might hamper the relationship of the United States of America with Pakistan, which is one of its chief allies in the so-called war on terror. Instead of thinking about petty interests, the leaders of these countries should unite and fight against the global threat posed by terrorism. If the world is to be freed of violence, then each and every nation has to make its contribution to peace-keeping.

 Yours faithfully,

Vinay Mohta, Ranchi

 What lies below

 Sir ? Sumit Mitra is right in saying that the Metro Rail in Calcutta is slowly losing its shine (?Slow train coming round the bend?, July 13). The distance covered by the Metro is inadequate, given the expanse of Calcutta and the way the city is spilling over rapidly into the suburbs. The extension to Garia is taking an unbelievably long time to complete despite the railway minister?s announcement during the 2005 railway budget presentation that the stretch would be completed by 2007. Given the pace of work, it seems that one would be lucky to find the Metro running in this route even by the beginning of 2008. 

 The condition inside the trains has deteriorated as well. The recorded information given out about stations is often inaudible or incomprehensible. In certain compartments, the lights do not work while in others, a malfunctioning ventilation system adds to the woes of passengers. There are some stations like Park Street that lack escalators. The Park Street station is not well-connected with other parts of the city either. For example, commuters from Mullick Bazaar or Park Circus have to walk a long way before reaching the Park Street station. This is the problem with the positioning of the Maidan station as well. It is time the transport department did something to introduce a circular bus service connecting Park Street, Park Circus and Theatre Road to help commuters access the Metro services more easily.

 A thorough overhaul of the Metro services should include a revision of the fare structure to rake in higher revenues. As point- ed out by Mitra, the fact that a Metro ticket often costs less than a bus fare on some routes is quite ridiculous.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Unsung genius

 Sir ? It is shocking that a scientist of Mrinal Thakur?s calibre has been deprived the Nobel prize (?Polymer Professor vs Nobel?, July 17). Twelve years after he busted several myths surrounding polymers, the Nobel in chemistry was awarded to three other scientists. It seems that Thakur?s postulates, which attacked some pre-conceived notions regarding polymers, did not find favour with the scientific establishment in America. As a result, they promptly denied him the award which should have been rightfully his and also stopped funding his research projects. Such an insult to a meritorious Indian should not be tolerated. The Central government should help the wronged scientist so that he can continue with his pioneering work.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Mrinal Thakur?s example should serve as a warning to thousands of Indians who still flock to the US to chase their dreams.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 LESSONS FROM THE FIELD

 Reconstruction games

 Rules of the Engagement:A Life in Conflict 

 By Tim Collins, 

 Headline, 6.00

 About the second Iraq war, it could be argued that the United States of America won the war only to lose the peace. The Saddam Hussein regime was easily overthrown in a conventional warfare, but the American occupation troops are running into difficulties in establishing peace in post-war Iraq. It seems to be a return of Americas failure to police South Vietnam during the Sixties. Unlike the American army, the British army possesses a tradition of conducting internal policing efficiently. In his autobiography, Colonel Tim Collins of the Royal Irish Regiment narrates his experience about internal peacekeeping and the problems of the American military in Iraq.

 Collins, as a member of United Kingdoms Special Forces, had served in various parts of the ex-British empire before being deployed in Iraq. On behalf of the British government, in 2000, he trained the Sierra Leonean army, so that it could fight the Revolutionary United Front, a Liberian-backed insurgency, which is trying to take control of diamond-rich Sierra Leone.

 In 2001, Collins and his Irish regiment were also engaged in aids to civil duties in Ireland. The insurgents used petrol bombs and blast grenades. Collinss task was to help the police maintain law and order. Internal policing for the troops was a frustrating duty. He notes that utmost restraint and good behaviour on part of the troops was necessary to bring the unruly crowd under control. Finally, close cooperation with the police was a must for internal policing to be effective. At the tactical level, aggressive patrolling and occasional nocturnal house-to-house searches were conducted to deter potential troublemakers.

 All these techniques helped Collins and his men when in 2003, they were deployed as rear area security in Iraq after the second Iraq war. Collins says that the goodwill of the local population should be harnessed for ensuring peace in the newly conquered territories. And the problem with the Americans is that they have no culture of interacting closely with the locals in the disturbed areas. Collins depended on the local elites, who were ex-Baathist officers, to restructure the infrastructure in post-Saddam Iraq. He says that Americans made a mistake by replacing all the local elites just because they happened to belong to the Baathist Party previously. The Americans also lacked the local knowledge and expertise to replace the existing administrative infrastructure. As a result, Islamic fundamentalists filled the vacuum.

 Collins offers several insights on counter-insurgency duties. First, that the soldiers require night vision equipment because the insurgents are mostly nocturnal raiders. Second, that they should not depend on lengthy detailed orders from their superiors, but must learn to think independently and quickly. Third, that in the information age, the counter-insurgency force must gain a knowledge edge over the insurgents working on friendship with the media. Economic development of the disturbed zone must occur simultaneously with initiating military pressure on the insurgents, if insurgency has to be eliminated permanently.

 Collins account is not only readable but also instructive, both for professional soldiers and the political decision-makers. The Indian army it might find it helpful to follow Collinss normative model when it has counter-insurgency tasks.

 TOO MANY COMMITMENTS TOO LATE

 TWENTY-TWENTY 

BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Speaking up

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs reply to the debate in parliament on the Indo-US civilian nuclear cooperation deal indicates a change in the governments position. This change has come after sustained criticism of the deal. Earlier, the policy was either to ignore criticism or to claim that negotiations were moving in the right direction. The contents of the two separate waiver legislations passed by the US Congress and the Senate were broadly projected to be in keeping with the July 18, 2005 joint statement and the civilian-military separation plan of March 2006. The passing of the bills by the US Congress with overwhelming majority was projected as Indian diplomacys great success.

 Singhs latest statement in parliament has finally taken the criticism on board. Instead of speaking in generalities, he responded specifically to the criticism. In doing so, he has, in effect, bound himself, the government and the country to a clear policy. Therefore, when the final legislation allowing civilian nuclear cooperation with India takes shape, it will be judged by how much it does or does not conform to the commitments made by him in parliament. In terms of specifics, Singh has committed that full nuclear cooperation with the United States of America would mean removing all restrictions on cooperation and technology transfers pertaining to civil nuclear energy, ranging from nuclear fuel, nuclear reactors to reprocessing spent fuel all aspects of a complete nuclear fuel cycle.

 This is a major commitment, considering what John C. Rood, the new US assistant secretary of state for international security and non-proliferation said to the senate foreign relations committee at his confirmation hearing as late as August 2, 2006. Senate committee chairman, Richard Lugar, repeatedly asked him whether India understood that there would be policy prohibition (not legal prohibition) on transfer of reprocessing, enrichment and heavy water production technologies.

 Rood said, We look forward to civil nuclear cooperation with India, but weve informed the Indian government that we dont envision that cooperation involving enrichment and reprocessing technologies or technology for the production of heavy water....We would prefer to maintain this practice as a matter of policy as opposed to a matter of law.

 This apparent contradiction between the US administrations view and the Indian view on full nuclear cooperation makes the Singhs commitment to parliament extremely important for the future of the deal. Singh has also exercised the principle of reciprocity when he said that India-specific safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency would be signed only after the US lifts the sanctions permitting full civilian nuclear cooperation.

 Significantly, on the issue of annual certification to the US Congress by the US president of Indias non-proliferation compliance, Singh has said that India was opposed to the provision even if it was non-binding. Earlier, these provisions were dismissed as no more than the pet bugbears of certain Congressmen and senators.

 Singh clearly said that such provisions were against the letter and spirit of the July 2005 statement; that they would diminish a permanent waiver authority into an annual one and introduce an element of uncertainty regarding future cooperation.

 Singh also clarified that India would not accept any curbs on its nuclear weapons programme. However, the proposed US legislation seeks to impose not legal, but political and diplomatic curbs on Indias nuclear weapons programme. Although referring to a civilian deal, the US legislation nevertheless talks of eventual elimination of Indias nuclear weapons arsenal, monitoring uranium production and use, augmentation of Indias weapons arsenal, and concerns that access to uranium imports will release domestic uranium for weapons.

 Singhs statement that if fuel supply to safeguarded reactors is interrupted, India would take appropriate measures to protect its interests is difficult to understand. As the safeguards agreement with the IAEA will be in perpetuity, it is pointless to talk of appropriate measures. The choice of breaking the IAEA agreement does not exist. The proposed US legislation also says nothing about helping India build a strategic reserve of fuel for safeguarded reactors.

 While Singh has ruled out signing an additional inspections agreement with the US, besides the one with the IAEA, he did not address the question of end-use verification. If the US supplies India with dual-use technologies and other licensed products, then it has the right to visit the facility where such equipment is being used. India can possibly argue that US technology will only be used in safeguarded facilities, there is no need for separate end-use inspections as IAEA can do the job. Singh rightly claimed that India would not accept external interference in its strategic programme. However, the proposed US legislation talks of facilitating India-China-Pak (House) or India-Pakistan (Senate) moratorium on fissile material production. On the fissile material cut-off treaty, Singh committed India to working towards a non-discriminatory, multilaterally negotiated and internationally verifiable treaty. But the July statement commits India to working with the US on the FMCT and not against it.

 It is also significant that Singh admitted that the final US legislation is likely to have a negative provision that testing will result in cessation of cooperation. He has said that this would not be acceptable to India. Singhs commitments to parliament are entirely in accordance with Indias national interest. He has tried to clear the air and instil a sense of confidence in the country by recognizing the concerns of the nuclear scientists, strategic experts and parliamentarians. The incongruence is that such an assurance has come after a situation was allowed to develop during which the credentials of the critics of the deal were questioned.

 Also, it is one thing to make a statement in parliament and quite another to get the US to accept this point of view.. While the deal has been presented as an energy issue to the Indian parliament, it is clear that the US sees this as part of its non-proliferation dialogue with India and to first freeze and then roll back Indias nuclear weapons programme.The government has got into a bad situation by not taking the critics on board earlier. While Singh has done the right thing now, it may be a bit late in the day. The legislative process in the US, except for the reconciliation of the House and Senate bills, is virtually over. The reconciliation will only be between those clauses of the House and Senate bills where there are differences of language and where one text does not include a provision present in the other. To say that things can be resolved at the reconciliation stage of the bills is to claim that two bad drafts can make a good draft after reconciliation. The final outcome could be worse.

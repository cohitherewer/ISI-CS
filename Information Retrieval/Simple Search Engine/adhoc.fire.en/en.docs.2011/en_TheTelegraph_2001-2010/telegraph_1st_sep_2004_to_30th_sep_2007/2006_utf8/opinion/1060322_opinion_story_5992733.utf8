 Profit and loss

 Sir ? The president?s endorsement of the decision of the Election Commission to disqualify Jaya Bachchan from being a member of the parliament spells doom for other parliamentarians who are holding an office of profit (?Jaya stripped of MP crown?, March 18). The apex court may have clarified that holding office under a statutory body is not recognized as an office by the Constitution but it is yet to come out with a decree on what the term ?office of profit? means precisely. Therefore, the president should have deliberated upon the issue a little longer. Perhaps, it would have been better if the president consulted eminent jurists instead of deciding to expel Bachchan in hurry. The former actress certainly did not deserve such shabby treatment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Jaya Bachchan may have been unfortunate in losing her membership to the Rajya Sabha, but that does not give Samajwadi Party member, Amar Singh, the right to describe the president?s decision as a?politically-motivated? move . The job is only half done though. If Jaya were expelled because she was receiving a salary from the Uttar Pradesh Film Development Council as its chairperson, how can Hema Malini and Shabana Azmi, also members of the Rajya Sabha, receive remunerations for their performances in films or in private shows and still continue to be in office? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? An elected member holding public office, paid or otherwise, should not be given a public appointment of any nature. Not only that, they should also be barred from executing commercial transactions ? floating tenders and quotations, organizing public auctions of land and buildings and so on. Unless such amendments are formulated, the misuse of the public office, directly or indirectly, would continue. It is high time strict rules are implemented in the public sphere so that no one can reap personal gains from appointments in government offices. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? According to the law of the land, if a parliamentarian is guilty of holding an office of profit after being elected to the house, he should be disqualified as a member of the parliament with immediate effect. This is so because holding two salaried posts only brings to light a person?s greed for money and power. All members who hold dual posts should be ousted from the parliament. This will ensure that the Constitution is adhered to and bring an end to corrupt practices.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ?The president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has done the right thing by giving his consent to the recommendation of the EC to strip Jaya Bachchan of her membership to the upper house of the parliament. Bachchan?s conduct, unfortunately, leaves a lot to be desired. In spite of her being in the wrong, she persisted in her efforts to hold on to her post, and even challenged the EC in the process. It would have done a world of good to her and her family if Bachchan had resigned on her own once the EC let its views known on this issue. But her lust for power made it impossible for her to listen to her ?inner voice?, unlike a certain Congress leader. 

 The present imbroglion should come as an eye-opener for politicians cutting across party lines. Our netas should realize that if they are found holding on to an office of profit, the doors of the parliament, no matter how much clout they may wield in the political circles, will remain closed for ever. 

 It is time that our leaders gave precedence to the standards set by the Constitution over their selfish desires and aspirations. This would undoubtedly enhance the dignity of the nation in the eyes of the world community.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Train to terror? (March 17) says quite correctly that perpetual poverty, years of neglect and an indifferent governments have helped the Maoists gain a foothold in the economically underdeveloped belt in the country. The Maoists are now a force to reckon with in the tribal dominated areas of Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh. The people in these areas have been living in abject poverty for a number of years now. A sudden rush of development aid on the part of the government can hardly make these tribals forget the years of wilful neglect on the part of the same set of rulers. Therefore, it is unlikely that the government will be able to put an end to the Maoist menace with the help of the development card. Instead, what the government should do is lend a sympathetic ear to the people in these areas and make it a point to assure them of their socio-economic rehabilitation.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STRIKE TOO LONG

 Two wrongs never make a right. The government is clearly in the wrong in its insistence on numerical quotas for other backward classes in educational institutions. Similarly, the protesters against reservations, especially those from the medical colleges, are not doing the right thing by continuing with their strike even after the apex court had given assurance that it would examine the issue of reservations. The strike has now gone on for 19 days and the Supreme Court is justified in expressing its exasperation and in saying that the actions of the students was tantamount to contempt of court. The protests against reservations by students have forced public attention on the subject. As august a body as the Supreme Court has taken notice of the matter. To this extent the strikes have been successful and a serious point has been registered. But the students, somewhat carried away by their enthusiasm and their grievances, have prolonged their protests for far too long. This is the principal reason why the Supreme Court has rapped them on the knuckles.

 There is one aspect that the students badly neglected. Their mode of protest has brought to a standstill work in hospitals. In other words, the students failed to discharge their duty to the ill which is their primary responsibility. Even those who are strongly critical of the government?s reservation policy have found it difficult to completely sympathize with the protests, especially given the impact they were having on hospitals and their patients. The cause the students upheld evoked sympathy, but this was eroded by the continued withdrawal from work and duties. No public protest can be sustained when it is threatened by a loss of public goodwill and sympathy. In a democracy, it is a given right for citizens to protest against those government policies that they perceive as unjust and unfair. But all rights have corresponding duties. The striking students were quick to proclaim their right to protest but they completely overlooked their duty to look after the ailing. The point is important because students of medical colleges are a very small and privileged minority. Thus over their protest looms the shadow of a backlash. They must acknowledge that in a country like India some form of affirmative action, as distinct from numerical quotas, is unavoidable to overcome the innumerable forms of socio-economic backwardness.

 HOW TO END A NIGHTMARE

 The image of a resurgent Bengal is incompatible with the mindset of its political leadership and the functioning of its slothful administrative machinery, writes A.K. Chatterjee

 The success story

 We all share a dream in West Bengal today ? a dream that the state will once again become a leading industrial state; the Salt Lake-Rajarhat complex will become the new hub of technology; super speciality hospitals will be built in the Health City near Calcutta which will draw patients from all over Asia; and Calcutta, with its shopping malls, multiplexes and luxury housing projects, will rival Singapore as the most preferred destination in the East. 

 Will this dream ever come true? Can we reorient our industrial management, labour policies and century-old administrative structure to meet the challenge?

 In order to find an answer to this question, a brief recounting of West Bengal?s rise and decline in post-independent India is necessary. Once Bengal managed to cushion the initial shock to its economy from Partition in the first ten years after independence, the state?s glorious days started from the second plan period (1957-62) under the inspiring leadership of B.C. Roy. Under him, the first master plan for the development of greater Calcutta was drawn up. The Metro rail, a second Hooghly bridge connecting Calcutta and Howrah, anticipating the future growth of Salt Lake and Kalyani as alternative townships, are all his contributions.

 The buoyancy in the industrial scene of West Bengal, particularly in the Asansol-Durgapur belt because of the Durgapur Steel Plant, the Heavy Engineering Corporation Limited and Durgapur Projects Ltd., restructuring of the Indian Iron and Steel Company?s factory in Burnpur under World Bank assistance attracted the attention of the whole nation. The prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, came twice to inaugurate the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, and Mining Machinery Project in Durgapur. B.C. Roy inaugurated a chemical project in Durgapur and Sir Harry Pilkington flew down from the United Kingdom to inaugurate a Pilkington factory in Asansol.

 The 1967 election ended all dreams of a new Bengal. The coalition that came into power was dominated by militant trade unions. At his first meeting with district magistrates, the then labour minister proudly announced that henceforth gherao would be the main weapon in the hands of the working class to eliminate capitalist exploitation in West Bengal, and the government would provide full support to it. When a senior officer pointed out that gherao was illegal, he was shouted down with the logic that strikes too had once been illegal.

 The death knell for West Bengal?s industry was probably sounded that day. The confidence of industry was shaken and new investments in the state dried up. All the propaganda of the state government about non-cooperation from the Centre fell flat. After the Left Front came to power in 1977, the major tenets of state policy completely went against industrial development of the state.

 Abolition of English from schools deprived students of access to higher technical and managerial education and higher-level job opportunities. Prevention of introduction of new technology in the form of computers in both education and industry set the state back by two decades, while Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra marched ahead. The decay in infrastructure was apparent in the sorry condition of the road network. Land reforms and panchayats formed shining examples of the state?s achievement, but West Bengal?s remarkable agricultural progress in this period was entirely owing to the hard work of individual cultivators who adapted to changed technology, seeds and fertilizer. Fortunately, no organized unions here stood in their way.

 Economic liberalization in 1991 and the opening up of the economy provided the dynamics of change to an otherwise stagnant state. English language teaching was brought back, technology was no longer a taboo and computers started being used in industry, and a comprehensive incentive policy for attracting private industry in the state was adopted.

 But have we really changed the mindset in West Bengal to cope with the demand of a globalizing liberal economy? The mindset in advanced economics today is that in order to survive a fierce competitive global economy, industry has to produce quality goods at the most competitive prices and provide excellent after sales service. The interests of consumers come first, not that of workers. Through continuous education and skill upgradation, workers are encouraged to seek alternative jobs if they become redundant in existing employment.

 But in the mindset of trade unions in West Bengal, workers?, and not consumers?, rights are still the main concern. Lifelong employment, irrespective of the state of the industry, is still the expectation. Closure of sick units is still a taboo and public sector units are the white elephants which cannot be touched either for selling of shares or for privatization.

 Fortunately, the state government?s mindset has started to change. Attempts are being made to close down chronic loss-making PSUs and to restructure the potentially viable ones with private-sector participation. Private investment from all over the globe is now being welcomed and all incentives, including allotment of prime land, is being given. An administrative reforms commission has also been set up to reorient the administrative structure and bring it face to face with the realities.

 In order to survive in this age of global competition, industry in West Bengal has to re-order its management, adopt business process reengineering to be technologically viable and spend considerable amount in research so that it can keep pace with the rest of the world.

 The government, in this era of globalization, has to be super efficient, fully responsive to the needs of the people and industry and it must have a capacity to adapt to change. Senior bureaucrats must have vision and leadership qualities. Knowledge and dedication to work at every level of administration are a must. 

 The administrative apparatus we have in West Bengal today is unfortunately like a 1936 Morris car, which is expected to perform like a 2006 Mercedes Benz ? which is an impossibility. In the past 30 years, there has been no provision for training or any concrete programme for human resource development for state government employees. The incentive for hard work has been done away with by the abolition of annual confidential reports and by ensuring that promotions take place only on the basis of seniority and not merit. This is actually the result of the pressure tactics of the coordination committee of employees who owe their allegiance to ruling parties. To them the only thing that matters is holding periodic demonstrations against American imperialism and imaginary grievances against the Centre. Government offices are regarded with scorn by citizens and they would ordinarily like to avoid any contact with government officers. The latter?s behaviour is often found to be rude though they are paid out of the taxpayers? money. In other words, the current administrative system is not compatible with the image of a resurgent Bengal.

 Is there a way out? Certainly. But for that, the political leadership has to take ruthless measures to discipline employees? organizations which have become the greatest liability for the state government. We must remember though that all government employees are not lazy or dishonest. There is a large section of them who would like to get trained, acquire knowledge and perform their duties faithfully, provided a favourable setting is created. Hence, the first task of the new government would be to set up training institutes for all government employees at the district level. The old practice of writing annual confidential reports on all employees and selection to higher posts on the grounds of both seniority and merit should be immediately reintroduced, disregarding all opposition from vested interests. As a member of the board of revenue, this author remembers initiating a training programme for all newly recruited staff under the collectorate in all districts. Employees showed a lot of enthusiasm and some even requested that the programme should not be confined only to new recruits. We must utilize this huge manpower of government in a positive constructive manner. Whatever may be the expenditure, the returns in the long run will be much more.

 A few practical steps can be suggested to improve the image of the administration, and to increase its efficiency at no extra expenditure.

 One, the number of state holidays should be reduced. Today, a government employee earns six weeks earned leave and 10 days casual leave in a year. The total number of gazetted holidays in a year comes up to about 30 covering all religious ceremonies of all communities. Then there are birthdays of public and political personalities. On top of this is a five-day week. No modern government can be run with such extensive holidays. Either the five-day week should become a six-day week or six weeks of earned leave should become three weeks. Employees? organizations can take a referendum and decide.

 Two, the practice of declaring holiday whenever a political leader dies should be done away with. Exceptions can be made in the case of the death of the president, the prime minister or the chief minister. In case of the death of ministers present or past, a memorial meeting may be held in the afternoon after the day?s work.

 Three, the current practice of declaring holiday in the high court if any senior advocate dies is preposterous. No judicial system in the world can conceive of such an event. The gesture may be appreciated in case of the death of the chief justice of the country or the justice if any court, not otherwise. This would be a far more dignified way of showing respect and would not inconvenience those who come to seek justice from remote corners of the country.

 Four, attendance in government offices should be strictly enforced. The scheduled working hours are between 10 am and 5.30 pm. For quite a number of government employees, the normal working hours are from 11.30 am to 4.30 pm. If employees can report for work at 9 am at the height of winter in the West, why cannot officials do so in India? Dislocation of transport is a standard excuse offered, and this should no longer be accepted.

 Five, even when government employees come to office on time, they often neglect work. Some may be found in the canteen long after the tiffin break, doing part-time jobs of selling insurance policies or acting as investment agents during the day. All this, quite surely, will not do. Government employees are paid to do their job. If they do not have adequate work, then work should be found for them. 

 Six, working days are often cut short by recurrent bandhs in this state. And these are called not only by the opposition, but also by the ruling parties. The high court has already passed the necessary judgment on this matter, and it should be strictly enforced. No sunrise industry like electronics will function in West Bengal unless this menace is done away with.

 Finally, state government employees must be polite in their behaviour with the public, eager to solve their problems and help them exercise their right to information. This is the least taxpayers expect from employees who are guaranteed pay hikes and dearness allowance at regular intervals from the taxpayers? money.

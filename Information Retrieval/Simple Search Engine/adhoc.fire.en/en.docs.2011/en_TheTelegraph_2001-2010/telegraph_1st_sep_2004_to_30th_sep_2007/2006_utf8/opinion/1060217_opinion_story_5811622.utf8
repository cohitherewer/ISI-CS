 THE CIVILIANS

 - India was a career, not a colony

 Lord Minto: only camping

 The Ruling Caste: Imperial Lives in the Victorian Raj By David Gilmour, John Murray, ?15.50

 Some things don?t change. The 19th-century district officer who noted that ?straight? also meant ?stupid? in Bengal, implying that a ?straight man? was someone who had ?not the wit to be crooked?, might have been describing today?s catch-as-catch-can society. The government?s emphasis on reports also strikes a contemporary chord. ?Since everybody was frantically writing their own reports, people seldom had time to read anyone else?s.? I warmed, too, to the judge who always supported the accused against the police. David Gilmour is a distinguished historian, but this very readable book, bursting with delightful nuggets, is basically what newspapermen call a cut-and-paste job. He has sifted through a vast number of unpublished manuscripts and official files as well as mounds of books and articles. Since many are already well known, familiar names, descriptions and anecdotes create an inescapable sense of d?j? vu. Irritation is also unavoidable at repeated references to the ?Maharajah of Holkar? meaning the Maharajah Holkar of Indore. Such a solecism may be expected from Katherine Frank, relying on researchers for her life of Indira Gandhi; not from the acclaimed biographer of Curzon, Kipling and, in a different genre, the novelist, Giuseppe di Lampedusa. His practice of bunching together several references in the same index-entry is also frustrating, especially when one wants to know more about a particular episode.

 More disappointing is Gilmour?s definition of ?the ruling caste? of his title. The subtitle, ?Imperial Lives in the Victorian Raj?, is not very precise either since it could embrace a wide cast of soldiers, traders and others who were not Brahmins in the colonial hierarchy but also worked in Victorian India. The exclusive focus on British civilians is a reminder that the Indian Civil Service was neither Indian nor civil nor a service. Only passing mention of Satyendranath Tagore and slightly less insubstantial references to Surendranath Banerjea, Behari Lal Gupta and Romesh Chandra Dutt (the fourth Indian in their batch is not even named) clearly indicate that they did not make it to the ruling caste. It would have been scholastically valid if he had left them out altogether, avowedly writing only about whites. It?s the token acknowledgement that is galling. Even worse is suddenly dragging in Dutt and Gupta to say (inaccurately) that they could get post-retirement jobs more easily than their British colleagues. Since only 12 Indians were successful in the next 20 years, it would have been interesting from the social historian?s perspective to know how they fared with the ruling caste. That is especially relevant since seven of the first ten were Bengalis, and the British, as Gilmour confirms, feared that ?Anglicized Bengalis?, of whom they disapproved, might set a role model for other Indians. All that is ignored, partly because this is an enjoyable pot-pourri of vignettes rather than a serious study but partly, too, one suspects, because the author reflects the imperial paternalism of his subject. This casual racism ? the ?doctrine of inequality? someone called it in connection with John Buchan, novelist of the Empire ? misses the sophistication of Hugh Tinker?s argument that ?it was, and is, possible for an Indian to develop a passionate loyalty to a British institution ? the Indian Civil Service, the old Indian Army, a university, the Bar ? and yet to abhor British dominance.?

 Gilmour?s simplistic view is reinforced by a romantic portrait of Civilians suffering privation because of their dedication to India, and by dwelling on the meagre gains, the lost years, the lonely impecunious retirement in ?Asia Minor?, as Bayswater was sometimes called. It?s a moving portrait with some basis, but falls short of the whole truth. Indians might have bumped off an occasional Collector because of his symbolic value but did not minimize his achievements, academic as well as administrative; Gilmour quotes Anil Seal writing that ICS men ?worked to establish much of the ancient history and ethnology of India?. Nor would anyone deny that long stints in particular jobs (Harcourt Butler was settlement officer for seven years, another Civilian spent 11 in Broach district) show up the anxiety of today?s Indian Administrative Service careerists to bask in the political sun at the secretariat.

 But the rewards were not to be sniffed at. Their lives could be of such richness that Evelyn Howell?s obituary in the Emmanuel College Magazine recorded that ?he could exchange compliments by post in Latin hendecasyllabics or elegiacs?. According to Alfred Lyall, one could become ?a much higher official but never a greater potentate? than a district officer. If power was the principal currency of return, the annual pension of a thousand pounds was not negligible either.

 Despite a regular trickle of raj memorabilia (from an avalanche a few years ago), the ruling caste bores most modern Britons as thoroughly as the retired Civilian?s Poonah tales bored his English neighbours. Surviving remnants might still put in a brave appearance at functions of the British Association of Cemeteries in South Asia (better known as Bacsa), but not for much longer. Here, the ruling caste was never more than a fleeting presence because, as Gilmour says, India ?was a career not a colony? where few Britons ?put down roots.? As Lord Minto said, ?We all feel that we are mere sojourners in the land, only camping and on the march.?

 Yet, the ICS still looms large in India?s consciousness. It provided the first link to modernity. It represented administrative stability. It also symbolised power, position and money. The mystique that continues to surround the institution is so glittering that even today?s public admires Sri Aurobindo and Subhas Chandra Bose for rejecting it. That is looking at the ICS from an Indian point of view which lies outside Gilmour?s remit. So does Tinker?s belief that an understanding of India?s dual response to such institutions is essential for the West?s relations with the new Asia. But he admirably serves the less ambitious purpose of glorifying the ?heroic leadership? (Arthur Schlesinger Jr?s term) of the ruling caste for contemporary Britons who may be unaware of or indifferent to the legends of the raj.

 Goodbye to the bad boy 

 Sir Shane Keith Warnes decision to retire from international cricket shows that some cricketers still know how to make a gracious exit from the game (End of sleepless days, bad dreams, Dec 22). Indian cricketers should try to emulate him in order to learn the art of retiring on a high note. It is very sad that, apart from a handful of cricketers like Sunil Gavaskar and Mohinder Amarnath, most Indian players had tried hard to extend their careers even though they had passed their prime. Warnes exit signifies the departure of one of the legendary exponents of leg-spin. He redefined the role of leg-spinners in cricket with the help of his craft and guile. In the process, he has set a benchmark that will be very difficult to meet.Warnes retirement will result in the game losing one of its finest players. But the Australians, thanks to their superior bench strength, still have enough ammunition to justify the invincible tag that has been bestowed on them. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Lovers of spin-bowling will miss the presence of Shane Warne on the pitch once the series against England comes to a close. This is certainly a disappointment, given the fact that spin-bowling is fast becoming a rarity owing to the rise of fast-bowlers. Warnes magical spells may not have troubled Indians, but the Australian was a thorn in the flesh of most batting sides. There are not many examples in cricketing history when a bowler single-handedly changed the course of the game, something that Warne has done again and again.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Though it is expected that every cricketer will retire someday or the other, Shane Warnes decision to quit the game will fill cricket-lovers hearts with sadness. Despite Warnes off-the-field misdemeanours, he was a spinner par excellence. His retirement will definitely create a vacuum in the arena of spin bowling which cannot be filled even by Muttiah Muralitharan or Anil Kumble who are also gifted sportsmen.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir A spin wizard would be the best way to describe Shane Warne. One of the finest leg spinners ever, Warne has always been in the limelight, and for myriad reasons the magic ball that felled Mike Gatting, the match-fixing scandal, a troubled marriage as well as allegations of sexual harassment. Despite his many brushes with controversy, one has to accept the fact that Warne is a role model for aspiring leg spinners. Even masters like Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar have acknowledged Warnes genius. Rahul Dravid pointed out correctly that cricket will be poorer after his retirement. That may indeed be the case but Warne will be happy to know that he is leaving behind a proud legacy. 

 Yours faithfully,

B. Srinivasan, Pune

 Sir The nightmares may finally be over for crickets bad boy, Shane Warne. What is truly astounding about Warne is that his transgressions, both on and off the pitch, never affected performance. Whenever critics dared to question his abilities, he answered them with a performance that proved that he was indeed the best in the business. He was a prize catch, both for the paparazzi and cricket fans. What is also praiseworthy about Warne is that, unlike some of his colleagues, he knew exactly when to call it a day. Now, with over seven hundred wickets in his kitty, Warne has become one of the few cricketers to have ended their careers while on top.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Shane Warne is undoubtedly one of the greatest cricketers ever, and his contribution to the sport is staggering. He has been polite and decent towards his cricketing friends and has been the darling of cricket fans as well. Yet, Warne is, in many ways, an ambiguous person. He combines some of the best attributes of a committed professional with those of a typical boorish male. This contradiction has given Warnes character the traits of a typical Jekyl and Hyde persona. Warne also leaves behind a legacy that is equally mixed he will be remembered as a famous cricketer as well as a notorious skirt-chaser. Hence, most interpretations of Warnes character are bound to be mixed. Only time will tell whether the cricketing or the libidinous reputation will outlive the other.

 Yours faithfully,

R.S. Neogi, Calcutta

 Sir At 37, Shane Warne has become one of the most successful cricketers in the world. His decision to end a long and illustrious career would hopefully open the eyes of some Indian cricketers who treat cricket as a money-making machine and are therefore reluctant to hang up their boots. One had hoped that Warne will be able to get his 700th test before he retires, Thankfully, that wish has come true with the ace cricketer achieving this unique landmark against England. An all-time great, Warne will be missed not only by Australia but by cricket followers all over the world. It will be hard to find another of his kind for years. In fact, his retirement has probably come as a godsend for many batsmen, who have been victims of Warnes wizardry. Now, they will get a chance to better their records before they too retire from the game. Admittedly, Warne has not been exemplary in every sense of the term and has often acted in a manner that has tarnished his image. Nevertheless, he has been a legend and the cricketing world should now prepare a fitting farewell to one of the games greats.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 THREE BADGES OF HONOUR

 Zidane deserves to be judged by human laws which go far beyond the Fifa guidelines, writes Jay Bhattacharjee in an open letter to the star

 Always a hero

 Dear friend Yazid, I know that few people are allowed to use the name that you have always kept private. However, I do hope you will permit an admirer of yours from distant shores to address you thus, in a communication that is open and yet, hopefully, one that does not intrude on your inner thoughts. 

 The president of the French Republic has been eloquent, nay almost poetic, in his eulogy to you. Now, Papa Jacques is not the most transparent of human beings at the best of times and has agendas that ordinary mortals will never understand. However, there are times when cynicism has to give way. When he said, ?I would like to express the whole nation?s affection and admiration for you at such a hard and intense moment for you?, he was merely expressing the fervent thoughts of an entire nation and people. ?You are a virtuoso, a genius of football and an exceptional human being. That is why France admires you.?

 Goodness me, when he was saying all this, he was not even looking at the piece of paper he was clutching ? there was no teleprompter either, since all of you were in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace. He went on to say ?that the whole country is extremely proud of you. You have honoured the country with your exceptional qualities and your fantastic fighting spirit which was your strength in difficult times but also in winning times.? This is what makes your country so special to us neutrals ? the fervour with which it embraces its fallen idols and icons, right from the Maid of Orleans to Charles de Gaulle. It does take a little bit of time for the French to muster up their fundamental elements, but they do so, sooner or later.

 Brooding alone in a cold and hostile London, with Churchill (and later Roosevelt) breathing down his neck, with that unspeakable Vichy gang besmirching the fair name of his country and the abysmal and senile Petain having sentenced him to death, le grand Charles pondered on his stand and concluded that the vandals from the Prussian swamps would never be conquerors of his motherland for long. After all, there was an oft-repeated phrase in German, ?herzlich wie gott in Frankreich?. Roughly translated, it means ?as happy as god in France?. Your eastern neighbours were so envious of your beautiful and gentle country that they were ever so keen to visit it often, uninvited on most occasions. 

 All that is in the past. In your case, your compatriots and your country have taken you to their hearts as much as they did with some of their most venerable historical figures in the past. Sunday the ninth?s incident in Berlin stunned all of us to start with, but as further information started trickling in, most of your critics, except the unpardonably partisan ones south of your border, have reviewed their stands. 

 There are technical and legal points on which we can quibble. Was the fourth official correct in taking action only on the basis of a video replay ? I am sure, Yazid, these are mere bagatelles. Your action cannot and must not be assessed on Fifa guidelines ? there are human laws that go beyond those made in Zurich . 

 Correct me, if you will, Zizou. You were once reported to have said that you were first a Kabyle from the mountains bordering the Mediterranean , then an Algerian from the La Castellane ghetto in Marseilles and then a Frenchman. I entirely agree with you ? you can be all three and proudly wear all three badges of honour. We, in this part of the world, have to assume multiple identities all the time ? a garrulous Bengali and an Indian has even written a book on this and laughed all the way to the bank. 

 Let us look at certain vignettes that have endeared you to me over the years. At the age of 16, when you got your first payment, you took it straight to your mother and gifted it to her. Which Bengali (or Indian) parent will ever forget such a gesture ? After winning France?s first ever World Cup, you recounted how your father worked as a city sanitary worker to bring you up and how proud you were to have parents like yours. By this time, you had, of course, quietly purchased a suitable house for your parents and family to live in comfort, after their years of struggle. 

 Therefore, you faced an agonizing choice on that awful Sunday night in Berlin. Your mother abused, your family honour defiled by an unspeakable ordure from Palermo , you chose what a Kabyle, an Algerian and a Frenchman would do ? you gave up your country?s World Cup prospects, your career and a place in the record books. A momentary lapse, as the Anglo-Saxon press harrumphed, or an inner call that makes you even more venerated in the eyes of the world ? I would definitely opt for the second explanation. 

 Your words now : ? ?The game, the event, is not necessarily experienced or remembered in real time. My memories are fragmented ? whenever something amazing happened, I would remember playing in another place, at another time.? That is what happened ? your entire past, all the things that you cherished, flashed past your mind in that terrible micro-second. Was it not a great thinker who once said that ?anger is one of the sinews of our soul?? 

 Clearly, your country has forgiven you. So has the world. You were actually chosen for the Golden Ball award by the entire international press community. On a lighter note, at least one blogger has said that yours was a ? superb headbutt, executed perfectly to the heart, making Materazzi go down instantly?. On a more serious note, your b?te noire, Marco Materazzi, has now been exposed for what he is ? a notorious goonda (a good Calcutta word that you should put in your vocabulary) and a cheat. A British journal has revealed that Materazzi managed to clock up three red cards and 12 yellows in a single season with Everton in 1998. He was also sent off during the match with Australia a few days before your encounter. 

 Therefore, dear Yazid, keep your head high and your spirits energized. The world needs you as much as you need to be in public life. Your fellow citizen, the writer Genevi?ve Brisac has called you ?an icon, our d?Artagnan?. The English writer, Percy Kemp, has said that you ?belong to football and not just to France ?Bonne chance, Zizou, the next generation waits for you.

 IDLE CROP

 Land reforms have become an obsession for the unreformed among Bengal?s leftists. They would not, therefore, accept the simple truth that the gains of land reforms cannot be for ever. Leading these men of the past is the land reforms minister, Mr Abdur Rezzak Mollah, who seems to be wary of factories coming up on farmland. There is nothing objectionable about his anxiety for the sharecroppers who would be displaced from their plots once these are converted to industrial uses. But the remedy he has suggested ? an amendment to existing laws for acquisition of land ? is clearly ill-advised. If accepted, it will land the government in messy legal problems and thereby delay Bengal?s industrialization programmes. Fortunately, Mr Mollah?s recipe has been rejected by the commerce and industries minister, Mr Nirupam Sen. Between them, the two ministers ? both belonging to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ? represent the tension between the old and the new thinking in the party. Mr Sen?s other argument against Mr Mollah?s proposed deal for sharecroppers ? that it will lead to bogus claims by owners of land ? is also realistic. The acquisition of land anywhere can be a complicated legal problem. All governments try to make the process simpler. Mr Mollah?s ways can only make things more complicated for the government. 

 All this is not to suggest that the sharecroppers ? and owners of land ? should not get a fair deal in exchange for their land. The larger issue, however, is not really the compensation package. It is one of the uses of land and the transformation from an agrarian to an industrial economy. It is time that Mr Mollah and those who think like him faced some fundamental questions about land reforms. The Left Front?s land reform programmes may have helped the bargadars thirty years ago get legal rights to the land they tilled. But large numbers of sharecroppers and even land-owning farmers have moved on to other livelihoods over the last three decades. Agriculture has increasingly been an unprofitable occupation. It has also failed to feed expanding families. The spread of education to the villages has created a new generation of people eager to venture into non-farming jobs. It would thus be a regressive policy that tries to bind land to farming only. If anything, the government today should help sharecroppers learn new skills and try them in other pastures.

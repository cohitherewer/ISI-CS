The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 EXTREME STATES

 Leftwing politics is notorious for partisan wars. This is fundamentally due to the importance of violence in leftist ideology. The Naxalite movement in Bengal in the Seventies saw comrades killing comrades in the name of class struggle. The continuing Maoist attacks on Marxist activists in some districts of Bengal are a grim reminder of those anarchic days. The big difference, of course, is that the Marxists now rule Bengal and are, therefore, equated with state power. Unlike in the Seventies, the police and the administration, engaged in the fight against the rebels, are now seen by the Maoists as agents of the Marxists. It would be short-sighted, however, to see it as a matter between two leftist groups. The larger Maoist threat is to Bengal?s peace and political stability. The state?s economy has begun to look up after years of stagnation. The ruling Marxists too seem to have realized their past folly of sacrificing economic judgment to crass political considerations. Investors have not only noted the turnaround but have also responded positively to it. The last thing that Bengal needs at this juncture is a return to violent politics. 

 The Maoist violence would thus be Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s worst worry on the eve of the assembly polls. But a workable strategy to tackle it has to be based on a realistic assessment of the threat. It is no use pretending that the rebels have no support among the local people. It is true, as the chief minister has repeatedly pointed out, that the rebels strike from their bases in Jharkhand. The Maoist offensives in different parts of India make it clear that the rebels have a closely-knit network spread over different states. But recent incidents in Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore districts should leave Mr Bhattacharjee in no doubt that the local support for the Maoists is increasing. Once the government faces this fact, it needs to find out why this is happening. One obvious answer is to be found in the level of economic and social deprivation among the poorest people in the area. Clearly, the long reign of the left has not made much of a difference to the lives of these people. Their poverty and their sense of isolation have made such people vulnerable to the lure of rebellion. All this is no justification for the Maoist depradations. The evil of extremist politics has to be weeded out. But the task must begin with an admission of the failures.

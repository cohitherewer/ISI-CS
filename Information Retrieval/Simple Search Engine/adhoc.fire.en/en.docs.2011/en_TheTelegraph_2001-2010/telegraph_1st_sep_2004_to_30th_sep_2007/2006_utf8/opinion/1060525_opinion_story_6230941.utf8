The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LISTEN TO THE VOICES FROM BELOW

 The Congress can hope to do well in Bengal if it manages to bring the underprivileged sections into its fold, writes Sumanta Sen

 Striking the right note

 Defence minister and West Bengal Congress president, Pranab Mukherjee, is reputed to be a politician with a cool head on his shoulders. He is not lacking in perception either. That the reputation is not without merit became evident during the recent electioneering and also after the polls when Mukherjee said that the trouble with the Congress was that it did not any longer enjoy influence among the scheduled castes and tribes and the lower rungs of the minorities. While he did not say it in so many words, he was clearly suggesting that in general, the party had got distanced from the poor. The same argument perhaps holds good for the Trinamool Congress as it also does not enjoy any space beyond that of the parent party. 

 The scheduled seats in West Bengal number 74. Mukherjee, however, pointed out that elsewhere also there were people belonging to the same castes and tribes, so the total number is impressive. As for the minorities, he has been candid enough to admit that support for the Congress was restricted to the moneyed people only. Such frankness, particularly in a Congress leader, was refreshing indeed. All the more so as the entire period of campaigning saw Congress and other opposition leaders making wild claims. 

 But questions remain. The first, obviously, is: did the Congress ever really have any influence among the poor? It is true that from 1952 to 1967, the bulk of the Congress seats came from the rural areas but can it be said that the village poor voted for the party on their own? A more likely explanation is that they did so because of the existing social relations in which the landlord?s command had to be obeyed and they were with the Congress. The association was historical and in the rural areas, the Congress and the landlords were almost synonymous, as they are also today.

 The first winds of change began blowing during the United Front days in 1967 when as the minister for land revenue (as the department was then known), Hare Krishna Konar began pursuing an aggressive policy of seizing land held illegally by the landlords. Aided by the Congress, the latter rose in protest but the peasants found a new ally. The illegal ouster from the land he ploughed off Biglu Kisan in Naxalbari had sparked off the historic movement there. In South Bengal also, particularly in the 24-Parganas and Burdwan, there were big agitations. Similar was the experience in the countryside during the second UF ministry during 1969. 

 As a prominent member of the Bangla Congress during the two ministries, Pranab Mukherjee could not have failed to realize that a major change was coming in the rural areas. The poor had found their voice. Whether he had drawn the attention of leaders like Ajay Mukherjee and Sushil Dhara to this is not known but the way in which they brought about the downfall of the second UF ministry had made clear that they were worried at the change that was taking place.

 Then Mukherjee joined the Congress, became a player at the Centre and it was many years before he began taking interest in state politics. By then, the Left Front had come into office and Mukherjee could not but have understood why the Congress was losing ground in the countryside. He has said that he had repeatedly drawn the party?s attention to the problem but nothing happened. So the party did not listen to him although he was the boss in the Eighties. What Pranab Mukherjee should have been frank enough to admit also was that the class position of the Congress could not have made it walk along a different path.

 One instance will perhaps suffice. When it was in power in West Bengal from 1972 to 1977, the Congress had toyed with the idea of bringing in a scheme for ?comprehensive? area development in the villages. On paper, the scheme sounded fine ? it would take care of development in all spheres of rural activity ranging from farming to poultry and piggery. But who would have been the beneficiary? The big peasant, as, without any accompanying land reforms, the poor peasants had no means of directly enjoying the fruits of the scheme. The Congress did not even bother to think about their votes as it thought that with the leftists kept out of the way with muscle power, it was back to ancient regime and that is how it would be forever. Pranab Mukherjee was then a very influential Central minister. He could have injected some sense to the state leaders but he did not. Now, under changed circumstances, he is talking sense.

 The second question is why has he chosen to speak only of the party?s lack of support among the scheduled castes? Does he then also, like people in Bihar, equate class with caste? Or was it because he wanted to show that the problem was actually restricted to a particular group? The fact, however, is that the scheduled castes are not without their share of moneyed people and they can have no love lost for the Left Front. The support base that the left has built up in rural Bengal goes down deep and is not dependent on caste considerations.

 As the results of this election again show, this base is still restricted to just a shade above fifty per cent of the population. For various reasons, many poor people are still outside the left?s influence, choosing to be guided by those who are their traditional mentors. This phenomenon perhaps cannot be explained from any caste angle. Any attempt to do so would lead to nowhere. Left Front leaders are always heard exhorting their party comrades to ?win? over these elements but not much has been achieved in the last 30 years.

 Would development or unnayan, the word so much in circulation these days, help? It is hard to provide any clear answer to this but it can be said for certain that the kind of unnayan that Calcutta has seen will not help. With all the flyovers, shopping malls and other objects of glitter, the Left Front could manage only nine of the 21 seats in the city. Those voting against it at Ballygunge, Belgachia (West), Cossipore and elsewhere must have included a fair number of poor people. Ironically enough, the glitter and the promise held out by the IT sector of Salt Lake did not impress the other segment also ? the upper middle class and the rich ? though the left was hoping this would happen. While this segment?s opposition is clearly political, the poor needs other kinds of development which are more basic to their existence.

 Then the support from the poor Muslims. By now it should be realized that in West Bengal, there is no such thing as a separate Muslim vote. The minorities vote very much as the Hindus do. If the Congress did not have support among poor Muslims, would they have voted for the party in such large numbers in 2001 and also on 2004, helping the same Pranab Mukherjee enter the Lok Sabha for the first time? This time, in Calcutta, they voted for the Congress in Garden Reach and Kabitirtha and for the left in Entally. So Mukherjee?s argument does not seem to hold good. No communal divide exists either in urban or rural West Bengal.

 Of course, having said all this, it has to be admitted that Mukherjee was right about one thing. The poor have shifted away from the Congress. But not wholly, which remains a concern for the left. And for the same reason, it should give a whole lot of satisfaction to the opposition. But while the left is sure to get down to its task of expansion (it increased its vote share from 48.99 per cent in 2001 to 50.49 this time), there can be no doubt in anybody?s mind that the opposition will go to sleep for the next five years. Perhaps it has no other way but to be a Rip Van Winkle.

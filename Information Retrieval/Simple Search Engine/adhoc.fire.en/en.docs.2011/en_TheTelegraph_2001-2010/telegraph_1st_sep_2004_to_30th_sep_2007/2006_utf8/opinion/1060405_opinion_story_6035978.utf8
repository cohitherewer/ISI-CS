 NO SURE WAY OF DEFINING

STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Is Indian ?street? English (Englishes, rather) as valid as any other? The question isn?t, of course, one for India or English alone. It faces Spanish and Portuguese, with their vast domains in Latin America. In a sense it faces any language, however small: is good Ruritanian confined to the nobility, clergy and professionals of Strelsau, or shared equally by its merchants and the peasants beyond its walls?

 Ask the Greeks. Modern Greek is as far from that of ancient Athens as Hindi from Sanskrit. But which modern Greek? In the 19th century there were two: katharevousa (clean), literary Greek and demotic, the tongue of ordinary people, in fact spoken by almost all. Then poets began to write in demotic. Its progress was not smooth: a proposal to translate the first-century Greek of the New Testament into demotic led to riots. But it triumphed, though katharevousa persisted in legal language until after the fall of a short-lived military regime in 1974.

 That timing was not by chance. The linguistic rivalry was in part political, the right favouring katharevousa, the left demotic. Politics likewise drove recent efforts to win respect for ?Ebonic?, the spoken language of (some) black Americans.

 Such issues have long faced novelists. Is their peasant to speak like a professor? Surely not. Yet how far do you go in reproducing his actual speech? J.M. Synge, the Irish playwright of the 1900s, went far with that of the Irish peasantry, to the fury of some nationalists, who thought it shamed their country. John Buchan, author of The 39 Steps, piled obscure Scotticisms ? genuine, presumably, but I wouldnae ken ? into some of his novels, maddening English readers.

 Anything goes?

 India?s English-language novelists face an extra problem. In a country where plenty of people leap between English and their vernacular ? or land with Hinglish in the middle ? how do you record their speech? Is the Agra guide to speak fractured Indo-English to gawping tourists, but standard English when he reverts to Hindi? Brick Lane, a novel about east London?s Bangladeshis, produced a further subtlety. When its characters speak Bengali, they are given plain London English. But one writes letters in ramshackle English ? representing not English but her ramshackle written Bengali.

 In all this where does acceptable English end and bad begin? At no point, maybe? Anything goes? To many academics, the issue doesn?t arise: how people speak is how people speak, and all is worthy of study. Maybe, but your wordcager, a shameless amateur, values his language. Let it be modernized, but not debased. True, there?s no sure way of defining which is which. But then many frontiers are unmarked on the ground, yet you will soon know what?s where if a police patrol picks you up wandering five miles inside Burma.

 Language, of course, is looser than political geography: not even in theory can one define its ever-shifting limits. My own guide is ?a decent respect to the opinions of (informed) mankind?. So, no, I don?t think pidgin is English, though the citizens of Papua New Guinea well may. And no, in my heart I don?t hear ?You are staying Colaba-side, isn?t it?? as acceptable English, though the enquirer did, and I respect his ability to speak far more of my language than three years in Mumbai taught me.

 And in ?informed mankind? I admit that at my age I don?t include teenage text-messagers, albeit some are more widely read and many far cleverer than I am. And if u r that age, be warned before you mock: the years roll inexorably on, and the neologisms of 2056 will seem as barbarous to you as today?s do to me.

 ALIENS ON HOME TURF

 Nilosree Biswas

 The colonial rulers had decided to create a promenade parallel to the Hooghly during the raj. That is the history behind the inception of the Strand Road in Calcutta. Over the years, this road attained significance not only because it had the biggest ferry ghats between Calcutta and Howrah, but also because it soon turned out to be a place for brisk business. 

 This stretch has the citys largest wholesale flower market. The Calcutta Port Trust warehouses are also located in this area and so are various old buildings. This is also one of the most important transit points for the countrys surface transport cargo system. This has resulted in the influx of a poor migrant population, and this 2-km stretch has a large number of slums with over 10,000 people living in them. Slums are an integral part of any city but the problem lies in the fact that the state government has chosen to deny the existence of the slum dwellers here. 

 If one were to look at the the political history of West Bengal, it would be fairly evident that the leftist government has often encouraged migrant populations from Bangladesh, Bihar, and Orissa to make Calcutta their base. So what makes this homeless group of poor people different? 

 One has to understand that the Left Front has slowly changed its stance on issues such as development, globalization and foreign capital. Earlier, the government implemented policies that stood for people friendly development. Then, at one point of time, it realized that there can only be development at the cost of some people and the favourable option would be to promote a culture of urban development. Hence, 2000 onwards, the government busied itself in building swanky malls, highways, and bridges to attract investment. In the process, the government evicted millions of poor people, thereby creating the category of urban poor, put a ban on handrickshaw pullers and evicted hawkers who had encroached upon public space. 

 Let down

 Most of the people living on this stretch are either homeless or live in shanties. The men work as helpers to truck drivers, or as casual labourers and rag pickers. The women either do odd jobs in local shops or are rag pickers too. Most of them live on pavements, in nooks and corners of ghats or on abandoned overbridges. Their children do not have birth certificates while the adults have neither ration nor BPL cards. 

 Every week, the local police and hoodlums carry out mock evictions. They pick up men and women, put them in custody, beat them up, and free them after they have paid their weekly hafta. In the last two years, there have been numerous cases of molestations and none of the perpetrators have been punished. However, for the last 3 years, a voluntary organization has been trying to address the problems surrounding health, education, sexuality and juvenile crime in this area.

 The response has been overwhelming. With 2 pre-primary and primary centres and 3 adolescent groups, the intervention on the part of this organization has become meaningful. The NGO is planning to file a PIL in the Calcutta high court to ensure that the children born to homeless couples are granted birth certificates. It has also started a dialogue with the Election Commission in this regard. 

 However, under no circumstances should State responsibility be minimized just because a voluntary organization is trying to make a difference. The left has been shouting itself hoarse to implement initiatives like the rehabilitation of the displaced population around the Sardar Sarovar dam. But what about the fate of slum dwellers and the homeless who are living under the threat of being evicted by self-proclaimed saviours of the subalterns?

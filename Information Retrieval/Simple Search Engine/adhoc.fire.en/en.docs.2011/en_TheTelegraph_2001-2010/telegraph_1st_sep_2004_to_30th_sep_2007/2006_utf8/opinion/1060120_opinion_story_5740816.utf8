The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 INITIAL FRAUD

 The initial public offering scam now seems to be far wider than it was initially thought to be. It is increasingly becoming clear that the scam is not limited to one or two IPOs, and the market regulator is now investigating the allotment processes in several recent new issues. It is also important to realize that it is not just the IPO allotment system that is under scrutiny ? the scam has exposed glaring deficiencies in the entire financial system. To start with, it has revealed that many demat accounts are either bogus or have been allowed to be used by those making multiple applications for IPOs. Bank accounts too have been misused in the same manner. This throws up the obvious question whether banks have actually been following the stringent ?Know Your Customer? or KYC guidelines. The KYC rules are meant to establish the bona fides of bank account holders in order to check money laundering activities. The IPO scam shows, however, that banks have had no qualms about opening thousands of accounts with the same address on the same day without any investigation, obviously flouting the KYC norms. This points to the pressures on banks to get deposits and open demat accounts on the one hand, and to finance IPOs on the other. With cut-throat competition in the banking system, it is clear that a blind eye has been turned to norms that prove restrictive in attracting business. In the process, an important defence against money laundering is being diluted. Small wonder that the Securities and Exchange Board of India issued its guidelines on anti-money-laundering measures on Wednesday.

 Another problem is that the KYC norms are relatively recent, and it is doubtful whether all the accounts opened earlier have been brought under its ambit. Stories abound of thousands of fake accounts that were opened to take advantage of the IPO boom in the Nineties, accounts that have been re-activated during the current market boom. Also, it is increasingly becoming clear that the documents used to establish identity could also be fake. For instance, reports indicate that there are as many as 15 lakh fake PAN cards in the country. It is well-known that many ration cards are bogus. Clearly, therefore, the problem is not just a simple one of removing the special quota for the so-called small investor to ensure that multiple applications for IPOs come to an end, far more important issues are involved. Under the circumstances, there is clearly a need for a foolproof identification system that will go beyond the usual documents asked for. One way out would be to extend the biometric unique identification system that Sebi has introduced to all financial transactions.

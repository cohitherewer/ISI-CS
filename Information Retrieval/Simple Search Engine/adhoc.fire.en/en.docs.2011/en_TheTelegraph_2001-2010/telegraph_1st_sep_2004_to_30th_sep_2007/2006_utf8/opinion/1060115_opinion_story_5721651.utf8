The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SURVIVAL STRATEGIES

 Two deaths and a timely rescue. The end of the year in Calcutta had come with the shocking knowledge that elderly men can fall sick in full public view in the city and die for lack of intervention. It is true that no one could have guaranteed the survival of Anil Kanti Basu, who died on Bentinck Street, and of Pashupati Ghosh, who died in a telephone booth on Deshapriya Park Road, even if they had been taken to hospital immediately. But in the case of Mr Amal Krishna Talukdar, timely hospitalization did make the difference between life and death. The student who came forward to shoulder the responsibility of not only taking the sick man to hospital but also of returning to inform his colleagues has not been brought up in the city. It would seem he still carries with him the values taught by older forms of social responsibility from his life in the district he was born in. He is still capable of carrying out a purely moral act.

 The death of two men earlier had come as a revelation of change in a city famed for compassion. Passers-by and spectators who watched the men die were consciously inactive. The condemnation of changed attitudes that followed was expected, but the hock expressed uncovered the typical blindness that has allowed the city to become what it is now. The best example of things going wrong for a long time is the growing lack of safety and dignity of women in public spaces. In buses, trams and trains, for example, a woman being harassed by even one man finds no support if she protests. This is a startling change from earlier crowd behaviour, and is far from recent. The refusal to get involved when someone is visibly in trouble has its roots in a combination of fear and callousness. In the case of the men who lay down to die, the fear was most evident. If a stranger being taken to hospital dies on the way, the Good Samaritan is likely to become the target of police harassment. There is substance in this fear: no assurances by a police perceived as unhelpful and bullying can change this.

 When the trouble involves sexual or any other kind of violence, the fears are sharper. Rescuers have been beaten up or killed too many times for courage and social responsibility to endure. Bapi Sen was killed by his own colleagues. This is a particularly telling example, because it is the unchecked violence of goons and the complicity of the police that make such situations possible. But fear could be overcome had there been hope of support, a public conscience that responds in concert. But rapid and unequal development, a frenzied pace of daily life, the desire to be home safe and in front of the television have gradually eroded the values of civic existence that should have ideally accompanied urban development. For many, not to bother is a survival strategy. A city used to ignoring children being born on the streets can take old men dying there in its stride.

 TO KEEP THE FLOCK TOGETHER

 The anti-defection law needs to be amended if the political face of India?s largest state has to be changed, writes Sumanta Sen

 A new headache

 This is a dangerous situation in which the law need not apply if it goes against the interests of those in office. In Uttar Pradesh, the Allahabad high court decided that the crossing over of 40 Bahujan Samaj Party legislators to the Samajwadi Party was illegal but, thanks to the speaker, they remain honourable members of the house. The speaker is supposed to distance himself from all parties once he assumes his high office, but in Lucknow, he clearly chose not to do so. 

 Not just that. When the group of 40 had crossed over some years ago, the then speaker, Kesarinath Tripathy, had seen them as a separate block of people. After that, the group became a part of the Samajwadi Party and now the chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, is threatening to hit the three who crossed back to the BSP after the court verdict with the anti-defection law. Common sense, however, insists that they, along with their former mates, should have been debarred from the house as soon as the court spoke. The chief minister also sees a ?conspiracy? in the entire development. But who conspired against him? Surely not the Allahabad high court? Interestingly, it was the same court which had struck down Indira Gandhi?s election as null and void and then also the entire Congress party had cried out against a ?conspiracy most foul?. When in trouble, politicians of all shades speak in the same language.

 Perhaps, it is time to take a good look at the law seeking to stop defection from one party to another. When the law came into effect, it was felt that now the days of aya ram, gaya ram would be over and the nation?s political life would be that much cleaner. But that has not happened because the law clearly has too many loopholes. So in Bihar, almost the entire lot of Lok Janshakti Party elected representatives crossed over to the Janata Dal (U) even before people had time to forget their speeches against the National Democratic Alliance. Nearer home, in Calcutta, Subrata Mukherjee won in 2001 as a Congress candidate, then switched over to the Trinamool Congress, and is now back again in the Congress, paying scant regard to the law and not having to pay any price for it. So why have a law which stands in the way of nobody?

 What will happen in Lucknow now? The detractors of Mulayam Singh want him removed and president?s rule imposed. That would surely put an end to the murky business but only for now. For there will be fresh elections and there is no way in which one can see a single party getting absolute majority which will ensure that support does not have to be purchased. 

 All the three major players, the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Bharatiya Janata Party have their own limited areas of play, marked out by caste and communal considerations, and not big enough to give any of the three the magic number of 202. And such is the amount of bad blood between them that people would shiver at the thought of any coalition between any two parties. Neither the Samajwadi Party nor the BJP would be keen to again join hands with Mayavati, such has been her track record.

 So where does that leave a party like the Congress? The party is making a lot of noise about Uttar Pradesh, which is natural as the state was once its fiefdom. But it has only 16 members in the house and it will require a real optimist to predict that all the hype over Rahul Gandhi will take the party to anywhere near the three-figure mark. The Congress, of course, can hope for an alliance with Mayavati but only if the party agrees to play the second fiddle to her, which it cannot be expected to do after its experience in Bihar. Lalu Prasad called the shots in this state and the Congress was nearly wiped off. Ajit Singh is another likely ally but he also is a small force, restricted to the jats of western UP. If the Congress had not antagonized Mulayam Singh, things could have been different but then top on the party?s list of priorities was getting the young Rahul Gandhi to emerge as a knight in shining armour. 

 Electoral concerns can, however, be of interest only to the political players. Viewers of the political scene can only groan at the way in which India?s largest state, whose contribution to public life had been immense, has been allowed to be overtaken by all that is considered indecent in life. The state is desperately calling out for a fresh start but who is there to provide it?

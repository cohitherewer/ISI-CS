The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WONT LET IT GO

 There are some less obvious ways in which terrorism or anticipated terrorism can disrupt civilized life. It looks as if terror might triumph over music in the United Kingdom. The cabin baggage restrictions in Britain, in place since last months bomb scare, are making it impossible for musicians flying into, out of, or within Britain to carry their instruments with them into the aircraft. Musical instruments are extremely fragile things, and are often immensely valuable. They are usually not covered by insurance when they are carried in the hold. Most professional musicians, as well as students, would feel absolutely disinclined to part with their instruments. The freezing temperatures in the hold, together with ungentle handling by ground staff, might result in irreparable damages. Hence most professional musicians would think several times before taking that risk. The cellist Steven Isserlis, for instance, preferred to make a 10-hour train journey from London to Salzburg to rehearse a concerto composed specially for him rather than put his priceless 18-century Italian cello in the hold of an aircraft. Musician members of the Bolshoi theatre, who borrow instruments from the Russian state collection, will also be travelling back to Moscow by train via Paris after their London season ends.

 The fact that the travails of classical musicians sound slightly ridiculous when thousands of human lives are actually at risk does not make this relatively trivial problem any less significant. The world was once the sort of place where some human activities could take place without any banal worries about their logistics. There was war, and there was peace, but one could, quite unthinkingly, have a moisturizer in ones toilet bag and a cello in the next seat without being suspected of wanting to blow up the plane. Not any more.

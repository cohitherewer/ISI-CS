 THE UNFOLDING OF A GREATER TRAGEDY

 Assam may get a new government after the elections but the fate of illegal immigrants will continue to hang in balance, writes Sumanta Sen

 Driven out

 Along with four other states, Assam is also waiting for the results of the just-concluded elections which would be announced today. The immediate point of interest is whether the Congress will be able to retain power in the state. The answer to that, however, may not have much bearing on the real issues confronting Assam. A Congress victory, or otherwise, will not touch either of the two core issues in the state ? namely the separatist agitation of the United Liberation Front of Asom and the fate of the Bengali minorities who are believed to be residing illegally in the Brahmaputra valley. Thus, while the people would have made their choices regarding their future rulers, the latter, going by past indications, would be found wanting when the time comes to address the two issues.

 And therein lies the tragedy of Assam. For the last quarter of a century, the state has been rocked by violence either related to the ?foreigner? issue or for a separate political identity even as the first question remained unanswered. No answer has been found either in Guwahati or in New Delhi. The much-acclaimed Assam Accord brokered by Rajiv Gandhi did see a return of the agitationists to the constitutional path, but that was all. The reason behind the agitation stays as valid today as it was then. Meanwhile ministries have come and gone both in the state and the Centre but the hapless minorities still have the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.

 The question is whether a whole lot of people have the right to live in Assam or not. The issue, admittedly, is sensitive but just because it is so, the powers that be cannot avoid it. Yet that is exactly what has been happening in all these years with the authorities choosing to take refuge behind all kinds of legal niceties. Indeed, even as this issue remains alive, New Delhi has chosen to take up the other issue of violence and decided to contain it with huge dollops of funds. The Ulfa, clearly, has not been impressed. But more of that later.

 Coming back to the illegal immigrants. The subject featured in a big way in the recent elections with the United Democratic Front leaders once again championing the cause of the minorities as they are only expected to do. On the other end of the pole was the Bharatiya Janata Party, and to a fair extent, the two factions of the Asom Gana Parishad, none of which this time was allied to the BJP. The Congress, as is usual in such a scenario, was found sitting on the fence, seeking to appease both the ethnic Assamese and the Bengali minority ? the results may well show that the party has ended up pleasing none. The left is too weak in the state to be of any account and at least the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has made it clear that it will be happy with just four seats in a house of 126. The Communist Party of India also cannot be hoping for anything more. Overall the forecast is for a hung assembly.

 So what happens then? President?s rule (which nobody wants) or a post poll coalition? The first arrangement that comes to mind is a Congress-UDF coalition as neither of the two parties can align with the BJP or the two factions of the AGP. And if such a coalition takes over at Dispur, what will be the fate of the illegal immigrants?

 A safe forecast is that their fate will continue to hang in the balance. For apart from the divergence of views held by the two parties, how on earth can a large number of people be deported after they have lived and worked on Assamese soil for so many decades? Tribunals, commissions, call the authorities by whatever name you will, may identify some people as foreigners but who is to say that the process of identification is foolproof? Then again, in Assam, it has been repeatedly seen that certain political forces are against Bengali-speaking people, irrespective of whether they came during British rule or after 1971. The reason behind such a mindset is basically economic: the Bengali minorities have turned land which was left fallow into high-yielding areas and the ethnic Assamese would like to have the pie for themselves.

 Here a parallel can be had in the Greater Cooch Behar agitation in North Bengal. There also, the rajgan (those who were close to the palace) leaders sat up only after refugees from East Pakistan had shown what fallow land was capable of yielding. Hence the cry went up against bahe (outsiders) and today there is the demand for a separate Greater Cooch Behar. Those who believe that economics can be kept separate from politics would perhaps do well to take note of this.

 It may be argued that people identified, no matter how questionable the process maybe, should be thrown out. Fine, but who will receive them? Bangladesh will most certainly not accept them as it just cannot afford to shoulder the responsibility of feeding more mouths. ?Kick them out of Mumbai?, roars the Shiv Sena in the nation?s commercial capital but its partner, the BJP, did not dare to do so in Assam. It did not do so because no government can be that irresponsible.

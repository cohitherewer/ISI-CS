 THOSE WHO CARED 

 Bona Fide -Malvika Singh

 The new conservation policy for 

 keeping tigers alive and multiplying seems to be out, and 

 the government is trying to get it into operation. However, 

 if you look at the fine print, it is a damp squib. It has 

 deftly dismantled the forest conservation and preservation 

 acts that Indira Gandhi had effectively passed in parliament 

 because she was the last of the political leaders to feel 

 passionately for our fast dwindling forests and wildlife. 

 She comprehended well that the true resource of this country 

 lay in its natural habitat and not in the coffers of the 

 Reserve Bank of India. 

 Sadly, the broad knowledge that 

 was intrinsic to the personas of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira 

 Gandhi and suchlike, is sorely lacking today. Therefore, 

 most areas that our technocrat leaders neglect or allow 

 detrimental decision-making to happen by abdicating their 

 responsibility, are ones that are outside their narrow and 

 limited discipline. In the past, leaders had broad-based 

 interests. They read beyond the basics and were more dynamic 

 and committed people, concerned about the habitat.

 Indira Gandhi, having grown up 

 in an atmosphere that celebrated knowledge and curiosity 

 to know more, was a leader who had strong views on almost 

 everything and took positions on national issues, often 

 despite contrary advice from her babus, who she knew 

 had certain vested interests. She proved to be smarter and 

 more political than most and never abdicated political responsibility 

 on environmental and cultural matters.

 Change the rules

 The great revival of the legacy 

 industries skills that rest in rural India, those that 

 have sustained and made this country a civilization difficult 

 to match happened during her time because she understood 

 this land and the people. After her, those critical sectors 

 have degraded. Unthinking politicians, devoid of the intellectual 

 wherewithal to harness the real strengths, have destroyed 

 this larger sector, one that could have solved the scary 

 problem of unemployment. Priority sectors have been made 

 into non-priorities. We have become clones of cultures we 

 do not even understand.

 Instead of enhancing quality and 

 building the infrastructure for the rapid growth of this 

 sector, our subsequent governments and their babus destructed 

 the real India. Government agencies involved in building 

 houses, to take one example, introduced the most appalling 

 designs in their greed, built substandard and ghastly habitats. 

 Our khadi and village industries were killed off 

 by lazy, illiterate babus. Today, no person with ideas and 

 initiative is willing to work for the government because 

 the babu has earned the reputation of stalling all that 

 will bring change and growth. The administration feels no 

 excitement in breaking new ground. They worship status 

 quo. It is their god.

 Where are those political beings 

 who are excited by the challenges of building India into 

 a super power? Where are those who care and want to commit 

 their knowledge and expertise to changing the rules for 

 growth in multiple sectors? Where are those leaders who 

 respect the legacy industries, who will fight against the 

 rampant exploitation of the natural environment, who will 

 sternly reprimand those who defy and break all the rules 

 of this nation in their quest for self-aggrandizement? Who 

 is the leader who will protect the historical legacy and 

 tangible reality of India in a determined effort to showcase 

 it for future generations of Indians and people from across 

 the planet?

 The people of India are clear 

 that their leaders do not care. Maybe that is the reason 

 why they adulate dynasties because those families have a 

 legacy of doing at least something, however small, for the 

 country and not merely for themselves, their friends and 

 families!

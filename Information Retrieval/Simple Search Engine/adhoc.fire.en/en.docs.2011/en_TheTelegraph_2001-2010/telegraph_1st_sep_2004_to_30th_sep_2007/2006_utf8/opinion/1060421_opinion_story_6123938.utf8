 DEFYING FEAR

 The people of Manipur are no strangers to terror, but they also know how to defy it. Journalists in Imphal too have their own ways of coping with threats from terror groups. But the way in which some activists of a militant group took six editors hostage and forced them to publish its statement in their newspapers adds a new dimension to the media?s challenge in the troubled northeastern state. The incident once again proves that most of these groups are little better than armed gangs which seek to force their will on the people at gun-point. No matter what their labels or professed creeds are, they have no moral authority over the people. If the militants can terrorize the media in such a brazen manner, it is easy to guess how they try to rob the freedoms of other sections of the people. It is one thing to disagree with the media?s presentation of events and quite another to act in the criminal way the militants did. 

 The important thing, though, is that the journalists have refused to cower before the threat. Given the climate of fear that prevails in Manipur, their protest demonstration must be hailed as a brave act. The publishers and journalists of The Imphal Free Press in particular have thrown the challenge back at the militants by rejecting the latter?s ban on the publication of the paper. This moral victory by a small newspaper could be a big help for the state government?s fight against the insurgents. The press in Manipur also has a history of fearlessly criticizing the government and the security forces, especially over cases of human rights violation. Many of the media?s exposures have led to the government admitting its mistakes or the army authorities taking action against errant soldiers. As elsewhere, freedoms in Manipur are indivisible. An attack on the media is, therefore, to be seen as an assault on one of the basic freedoms of the people. It is not merely a matter of the people?s right to information; what is at stake is their right to live without fear.

 Letters to Editor

 Measure for measure

 Sir At a time one had started accepting the ineffectuality of the Indian judiciary as a fait accompli, the sentence delivered to Santosh Singh by the Delhi high court for the murder of Priyadarshini Mattoo comes as a welcome relief (Santosh to hang, Oct 31). 

 However, it is difficult to forget that the verdict came ten years after the crime. Perhaps justice would have been denied in this case ultimately, had it not been for the overwhelming public pressure. The media glare forced the judiciary to resurrect the case seven years after Singh had been acquitted of his crime by a lower court. One should nevertheless rejoice in the fact that Chamanlal Mattoo, in the end, won in his fight for justice. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir The death sentence delivered on Santosh Singh by the Delhi high court should be good news for all victims of injustice. Singhs crime and his attempts to derail the course of justice are all the more unpardonable since he had been a lawyer himself and thus was a custodian of law. If he had gone unpunished, then the peoples faith in the judicial system would have been shaken irreparably. Moreover, Singh had showed no signs of penitence through the ten years since he brutally murdered Priyadarshini Mattoo in 1996. Singh certainly deserves no clemency. One hopes that justice will be meted out in the Jessica Lal murder case as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is hard to believe that one is capable of so much cruelty as Priyadarshini Mattoos murderer. It is even harder to believe that a man accused of rape and murder can be acquitted by the court. Santosh Singh got away with a lot by virtue of his position as the son of a senior police officer. His past finally caught up with him. 

 But his case is a pointer to the depravity that has crept into contemporary Indian society, polity and the judiciary. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Capital punishment has always generated debate but one cannot overlook its effectiveness as a deterrent to crime. The dispensers of justice in India cannot afford to abolish the death sentence. When the crime is brutal, the verdict should be appropriate.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Santosh Singh will surely challenge the death sentence in the Supreme Court. Even if the apex court agrees with the Delhi high court verdict, Singhs death sentence may be repealed by a pardon from Indias president. So, however one celebrates the judgment in the Mattoo case, Singhs death by hanging might not happen finally. Remember, the man had been acquitted once despite there being little doubt over his murder of Priyadarshini Mattoo. One can only hope that the blatant miscarriage of justice will not be repeated and Singh will get the punishment he deserves.

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir The order to hang Santosh Singh comes at a time when there is a perpetual clamour for clemency for Mohammad Afzal, the man convicted for the parliament attack. The demand to abolish the death penalty is also raised every time a person is sentenced to death. But even those in favour of mercy would find it difficult to ask for Singhs pardon. The inhuman way in which Singh murdered his victim and then used his connections in high places to get an acquittal show what an unscrupulous and unrepentant person he is. 

 If criminals have a right to life, so do ordinary citizens. Killing someone in cold blood can only be punished with death. There are many dreaded terrorists in Indian jails who are responsible for hundreds of murders. Showing leniency to them by sparing their life would be an open invitation to trouble.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumya Mukherjee, Naihati

 Sir A murder cannot be punished by sentencing the accused to death. If the judiciary discovered ever that the accused had not really committed the crime, can the dead man be brought back to life? Capital punishment rests on the dictum, an eye for an eye, which cannot pass as law in a civilized, modern world. 

 Yours faithfully,

Swagato Paul, Calcutta

 Sir It is quite appalling that Santosh Singhs fate swung from one extreme to another on the basis of evidence which did not change during the intervening years. This is not to say that Singhs punishment is undeserved, but only to point to the mistakes that might be committed by the judiciary in the course of a trial. A death sentence is an extreme judgment, resting on the assumption that judges are infallible. 

 Besides, retributive justice only feeds the sadistic appetite of the public and generates more violence in its turn. What is needed is equitable, not extreme, judgment for the law to serve its purpose in society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir The cases of Priyadarshini Mattoo, Nitish Katara and Jessica Lal have been revived mostly because of the publicity they have received. But justice had been eluding many in less-hyped cases, which are, nonetheless, as grave. The police has played a passive role in the assault and harassment of Ballys Prasenjit Ghosh and his wife by alleged members of the ruling party. Even Santosh Singh had almost slipped out of the hands of law because he had political links. If one can escape punishment simply by being related to people in power, then one can only despair at the situation in India.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Calcutta

 SPIRITED MOVE

 Governments and politicians in India are known to use religion for narrow, sectarian purposes. In fact, a governments active support for or involvement in religious affairs is an ominous sign for the secular character of the state. But what Bihars chief minister, Mr Nitish Kumar, has done in order to promote Durga Puja festivities in Patna this year seems to be a welcome departure from the usual mix of religion and politics. His governments decision to sponsor Puja programmes and cultural shows has a commendable political purpose. In supporting these programmes, Mr Kumar wants to send out the message that Bihar is now safe enough for festivities and also for business. The governments action is thus a confidence-building measure, aimed more at the promotion of the state than of a religious festival. And there is no doubt that Bihar badly needs an image makeover. For far too long, it has been Indias biggest source of despair. 

 However, one successful festive season, even with the governments help, will not be enough to clean up the states mess. Mr Kumar cannot be unaware of the challenges before his government. It is easy to blame all of Bihars troubles on Mr Lalu Prasads long rule. But a blame game is more politics than any concrete plan of action. Some of the states worst problems such as caste violence, lawlessness and financial bankruptcy are the result of a systemic collapse to which all political parties have contributed in varying degrees. It is not simply the states politics that caused all the distortions. The police, the bureaucracy and many other layers of the administration played their part in subverting the system. Mr Kumar can tackle the challenges only if he sees them in their true perspective. If he is to succeed, he must begin with weeding out corruption from the bureaucracy and the police. He seems to have made a beginning, but he has miles to go before Bihar is truly reborn.

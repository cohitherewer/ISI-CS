 Lost harmony

 Sir Swapan Dasguptas article, Difficult words (Aug 25), looks into the objections raised, mainly by Islamic groups, to the singing of Vande Mataram in 1950 and earlier. Similar objections brought forth almost 59 years later seems to reaffirm that history repeats itself. The present opposition to the singing of Vande Mataram on religious grounds, despite its acceptance as the national song in 1950, disregards its historical significance in context of the freedom struggle. The lack of practical wisdom on the part of Indian leaders at the time of independence and thereafter is to blame for hackles now being raised by the government order. But a warped view of secularism has always been propagated in India. Religious communities have been confined to narrow compartments in the name of preserving their rights and cultures. The assertion of distinctiveness, or, to be precise, separatism has been encouraged by vote-hungry politicians who have never bothered about national integration except while speaking in parliament. Hence it is not surprising that the mindset that led to Partition has surfaced again in the refusal of the Muslim community to sing Vande Mataram. 

 Islamic resurgence elsewhere in the world has made a deep impact on Indian Muslims. Exposed to internal and external pressures, they have perhaps become oversensitive about questions of their identity. Their refusal to sing Vande Mataram is understandable in this context. Indian political leaders should, for a change, think in terms of the integrity of the nation and take sincere action against the incipient divisive tendencies.

 Sir The shehnai maestro, Ustad Bismillah Khan, like many Indian Muslims, considered Islam his religion and Hinduism his culture, for he was religious and cultured too. Thus he could worship goddess Saraswati and still be a devout Muslim. It is only those attaching more importance to the visible letter of the Islamic law than to its spirit who would find Vande Mataram objectionable on the ground of idolatry. 

 At the same time, putting forward the example of Ustad Bismillah Khan as an argument in favour of making the singing of Vande Mataram compulsory in schools is rather farfetched. No one in his right senses can suggest that Hindus read the namaz just because the Hindu seer, Ramakrishna, performed it.

 Sir Swapan Dasgupta provides a blinkered view of history by portraying Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and all Muslims who objected to the acceptance of Vande Mataram as the national anthem of India in the pre-Partition days, in a negative light. It is not impossible to view the kind of nationalism embodied in the song as Hindu-centric and neglectful of the minority cultures. Further, the novel, Anandamath, from which the song is taken, is a work with a strong anti-Muslim strain. It is essential for the leaders of India to understand that national unity cannot be achieved unless minority perspectives are taken into account.

 Guarding the guards

 Sir The report, Law on way to make police humane(Aug 31), should give Calcuttans, who have despaired long over the callousness of the police force, a ray of hope. Despite repeated complaints from the people, the police have hardly cared to make themselves accountable to those whom they serve. As a result, most people have lost faith in their efficiency. This is appalling since in a world ravaged by terrorism, it is only the law-keeper who can ensure the safety of the people.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The police force in Calcutta has almost become synonymous with oppression. They behave outrageously with people who appeal them in their helplessness. This is not only shameful but also inhuman. If the police cannot catch anti-social elements nowadays, it is because they are in cahoots with the underworld, which, in turn, receive the patronage of the political leaders. Unless this nexus is broken,the police will continue to harass people. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Spare the child

 Sir Teachers, the once-revered preceptors, are increasingly coming to resemble criminals, as the recent spate of incidents involving minors who fell victims to their cruelty demonstrates (Teacher canes girl for error in fathers letter, August 29). The teachers abuse their students for minor faults because they lack the ability to teach them with patience and diligence. The performance of teachers, especially in government-run schools in rural areas, is dismal. The teachers are more interested in their monthly pay packet than in educating the students. The situation is intimidating and only a total reformation of the educational system can save it from an imminent collapse.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Susobhan Sarkar, 

 Calcutta

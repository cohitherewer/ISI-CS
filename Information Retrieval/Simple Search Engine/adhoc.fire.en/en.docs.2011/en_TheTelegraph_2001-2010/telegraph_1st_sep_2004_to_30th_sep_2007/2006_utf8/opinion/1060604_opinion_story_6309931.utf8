 Letters to Editor

 Taking a rain check

 Sir ? Whatever experts may say, by continuing to generate a sizeable portion of India?s national income, the monsoon remains nature?s greatest gift to the land (?Monsoon arrives early, carrying hope of price fall?, May 27). To acknowledge that by providing water for agriculture, the monsoon sustains the Indian economy, is to admit that there is little substance to the recent rhetoric about our eight per cent growth. Where would this growth be if the timing, distribution and volume of the monsoon rainfall were to fall below average?

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Run for the post

 Sir ? Rasheed Kidwai?s report, ?Warriors warm up for battle to be President? (May 29), is thought-provoking. Every prospective candidate in Kidwai?s list has or had a political background. One should be wary of the possible public reaction and political fallout of the appointment of one of the above individuals as the next president of India. V.P. Singh and Arjun Singh are anything but popular with most of Indian society. The candidacy of either could trigger nationwide protests as violent and passionate as the recent anti-reservation agitation, which, incidentally, had none other than Arjun Singh as the target of attack. 

 Given the sanctity of the post of president, neither V.P. Singh, nor Arjun Singh or Bhairon Singh Shekhawat qualifies for the honour. The name of Karan Singh, however, stands out in the list. Although he formally belongs to the Congress, he is not really a political person. Besides, he is a learned man, with a considerable body of writings on philosophy, politics and social studies. Therefore, Karan Singh can be excluded from the gallery of self-serving, opportunistic politicians. He would make a good president, while the others would not even qualify for the post.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The projection of presidential hopefuls by Rasheed Kidwai sounds all too familiar, the Kshatriya factor notwithstanding. At the risk of sounding parochial, one could still contend that it is time a Bengali got the job. In spite of playing a major role in the freedom struggle, Bengal and Punjab had to bear the brunt of one of the worst instances of ethnic uprooting. Bengal never recovered from the economic, political, cultural and psychological damage of the event, to the extent that not a single prime minister or president of India has come from Bengal. Punjab, on the other hand, has produced one president and one prime minister, even if one leaves aside Swaran Singh, who acted as interim prime minister on two occasions. Thus, Amartya Sen should be the consensus candidate for the next president of India. Sen is an intellectual who is above politics and controversy and therefore the best Bengali alive to take over A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s office. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Mayajit Mazumdar, Kharagpur

 No fire

 Sir ? The government of India has once more observed No Tobacco Day as a mere formality on May 31. A lot of public money has been wasted on advertisements that also double up as publicity for politicians. It is time the Centre considered a draconian law banning the manufacture and sale of tobacco products in the country. Cigarette consumption has grown exponentially in India, courtesy the West. However, it is the West ? particularly the European Union ? which today offers the best possible role model for anti-tobacco programmes. Closer home, Bhutan offers a lesson in how to enforce a blanket ban on smoking.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

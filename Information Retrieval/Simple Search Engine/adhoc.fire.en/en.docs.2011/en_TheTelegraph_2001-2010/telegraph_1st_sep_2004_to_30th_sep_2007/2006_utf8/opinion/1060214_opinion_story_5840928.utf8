The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WATCHED BY A NEW INDIA

 Malvika singh

 Prakash Karat has now openly called for a new configuration at the Centre. Thank the lord for transparency and truth this time round in the CPI(M) objective of wanting to drop this government so that it can lead the next lot, and call the shots. This brazen openness of intent is far more acceptable than the fake, occasionally gentle, but often forceful political blackmail. It makes sense for the CPI(M) to align with those who are ?attachments? to its political ideology, as also supporters of its style and manner of dealing with a political partnership. It just wants its way, desperate for its demands to carry. The left does not respect any other thinking. The leftists are didactic and dictatorial about their positions on everything under the sun as are the RSS. Dialogue, discourse and consensus can only happen on their terms, endorsing their ?ideology?, their shut-out-all-else thinking. It is time for all such political types to come together and grab what they seem to be thirsting for ? power. Mulayam Singh Yadav has dreamt many a dream of becoming prime minister; therefore, what better moment than this to be endorsed by the CPI(M), the bully that has no responsibility or any accountability in the area of national governance?

 India, a new India, is watching. It is an India that is not carrying the baggage of past politics. It is an India that does not want to be betrayed by its leadership yet again. It is an India that knows and recognizes what it sees without emotion. It is an India that expects those in power to deliver the goods or disappear from the space. It is an India that has been ignored, that politicians have not begun to comprehend or reach out to. It is an India that will bring the change, whatever it may be, start the process of cleaning the polluted public environment. It is bound to call the bluff of this kind of opportunist politics, a politics that has kept India backward. It is bound to reject the aged mindset of those who manipulate our politics today.

 Pulling the plug

 For the Congress, this kind of coming together of opposing and disparate political forces would be most beneficial because it would, in the final call, bring the Congress back from its minority status in numbers with larger, more substantial seats. There is no other mass that embodies all the levels and thinking of India, the reason why the party held sway for decades till rampant corruption brought it to its knees. They could gain strength and numbers if there is a mid-term poll called by the ruling coalition before the year is out, and not much later, or if a mishmash coalition, constructed by Karat for his unfathomable reasons, rules India for some months.

 This generation of under-35-year-olds will begin the cleansing of the Indian political space where for 60 years political discourse and action have been stuck in a time-warp that has helped no one, neither Bharat nor India. It has been exploitative across the board in varying degrees. The timing for ?pulling the plug? is therefore critical. The consequences of some Indo/US positions and policies led by the prime minister and his ?loyal? team could cause distress in the public arena. The repercussions of some interventions and policy could well be dangerous and lead to social disorder. 

 To be seen as a puppet doing the bidding of the US, at this historical moment when the world is consciously cautious about the US, a power in decline, could be very detrimental to the Congress under Manmohan Singh. However, before that reality seeps in and begins to take centre stage, Sonia Gandhi should consider a rectification of the political position with the US. She could ask for a fresh mandate. She can only gain from the Karat syndrome on the one hand and the clean image of the PM on the other. Her true intent and commitment to the less privileged is what generates the faith in her leadership.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT FAIR

 When the Congress was in power in the Centre last, in the early Nineties, it was seized with a mission to liberalize the economy, to place the interest of the consumer above that of the government employee, to replace government monopolies by competition, to replace government ministries with regulators, and to give the private sector a level playing field. It was in those days that it handed out licences for refining crude oil to private groups. Of them, Reliance built one of the worlds largest refineries, which accounts for almost a fifth of Indias capacity. A market free of subsidies and distortions is essential to the working of competition. In 1998, the government the National Democratic Alliance one this time decided to abolish subsidies to diesel and liquefied petroleum gas in five years. When the time came, however, the abolition was postponed, and faced with the subsequent rise in world crude prices, this government has enhanced the subsidies. To compensate its own companies for the loss entailed, it issued the so-called oil bonds to them, in effect taking over the losses with a delay. 

 The result is that Reliance, which has meanwhile set up 1280 outlets and captured 15 per cent of the retail market, finds its petrol and diesel outpriced. Its retailers have lost custom, and agitated to make Reliance match the government subsidy which makes fuels from state oil companies outlets cheaper. Reliance asked the government to give it a matching subsidy, which was rejected by Mr Murli Deora, the petroleum minister. The government in this case is an unfair competitor. It can dip into the taxpayers pocket and give its companies limitless subsidies; private competitors, which cannot rob the taxpayer, can subsidize the consumer only at the cost of their shareholders. Taxpayers are the governments captives; shareholders are not of companies. If a company destroys profits by subsidizing consumers, shareholders will sell out and invest in companies that are not under such state-imposed compulsions. By giving subsidies that in effect give an unfair advantage to its own companies, the government is telling private investors to avoid companies that face competition from state-owned companies that is, not to invest in industries where the government continues to be a producer. The same issue arose in telecommunications, where the government not only gave subsidies to its own BSNL but even made private companies give BSNL a cross-subsidy so that it could undercharge its consumers. 

 It is not enough that the government allows competition and private entry; it is also essential that it should give an assurance of fairness at the time of liberalization, and forever after. This government is unprepared to do so. The subsidies it gives, while they benefit the consumer in the short run, hurt him far more in the long run insofar as they discourage private investment and competition that could bring down costs and prices.

 NOT OUT OF JOINT

 - The end of old Fleet Street

THE HISTORY OF THE TIMES VOLUME VII: 1981-2002 THE MURDOCH YEARS By Graham Stewart, HarperCollins, 18

 It says much for the sense of propriety that inspires The Times that in 1990 it deleted from the obituary of a gardening journalist called Peter Coats the suggestion that as ADC in Delhi to Lord Wavell he had been the viceroys gay lover.

 Not that this exercise of discretion will silence those whose cry of The Times being out of joint echoes plaintively in every age. But it does explain why Simon Jenkins, editor during 1990-92, called the paper the tribal noticeboard of the British Establishment. Jenkins, incidentally, was appointed to rescue a heritage in danger of sinking. But the financial wizard who appointed him to that sacred task was no Englishman traditionalist. Indeed, it is further evidence of the magic spell that England still casts on its former subjects overseas that for decades now the owners of this 221-year-old house journal of the British ruling classes have sprung from alien roots.

 The formerly American Astors yielded to the Canadian Roy Thomson who considered spending a fortune on the sinking ship the greatest privilege of (his) life. Then in 1981 came that most unlikely of knights errant, the Australian Rupert Murdoch, already owner of the two most sleazy steeds in the British press stables the News of the World and The Sun. The Page 3 phenomenon is the Murdoch Suns gift to the world. In saving The Times from bankruptcy, Murdoch also saved his own media empire and ensured the continuance of other British titles. In spite of its extraordinary length 724 pages including supplementaries this is not a tiring read. That is not because the newspapers story is either so gripping or so important as because the author presents an attractive and incisive (he is a historian after all) tour dhorizon of world history with magisterial loftiness. Consider, for instance, the sentence with which the fifth section of Chapter 13 opens. Despite the bloodshed in the Balkans, the Caucasus and in Africa, the twentieth century ended with considerable evidence that Western values had indeed triumphed after all. What in the name of all that is good and great, the reader may ask, has that to do with The Times?

 Ah, but there lies the subtle catch. Laced through page after page of inspiring prose is the subliminal suggestion that the newspaper shaped all the great events of the 21 years this volume covers. It inspired the movers and shakers of the world during that period, and through the force and wisdom of its compelling leading articles and the blazing clarity of its news despatches helped to resolve all the most sizzling crises of our age.

 That grandiloquent self-view, to which the paper has always clung with tenacious pride, sometimes receives minor support from outside. An editorial on the Irish Republican Army, declaring Hope is their oxygen. It must be denied them, prompted Margaret Thatchers famous comment about the oxygen of publicity that terrorists yearn for. The author is paid to project that sense of consequence with robust vigour. Nowhere is it actually admitted that this is ordered history, but Stewart does mention in passing that John Grigg was commissioned to write the previous volume of the official History of The Times.

 There is no harm in that for no one but an official biographer would have full access to all the papers record. But the role places an additional onus on the writer to conduct independent research as well to present an objective picture. Jenkins denies he went wobbly on the Gulf war. Donald Trelford, former editor of The Observer, told this reviewer that not only was he maligned over the sacking of six sub-editors who were ghosting for The Times but also that Stewart did not ask him about the incident. On both, he seems to have relied on the journalistic grapevine.

 A thin scattering of infelicities (forth estate, onto) is a reminder that even Homer nods. More serious is the claim that there were no obituary howlers till 2002. In 1969, The Times despatched C.N. Annadurai while he was still in a coma; told that the Tamil politician was still alive, a Times editor said it was not the first such mistake. On one occasion, apparently, they published the obit of a maharajah who also graced the social page. But Stewart tells with eloquence the story of Harold Evanss dramatic rise and fall and the heroic battle with cancer of another editor, Peter Stothard. 

 He is especially graphic, if rather long-winded, in describing the elaborate manouevres before, during and after the 1986 moonlight flit to Wapping. Perhaps the excruciatingly detailed account is necessary. No other proprietor could have planned and executed such a move, which also makes nonsense of the claim, implicit and explicit, that the six editors covered in this volume did as they willed, free of proprietorial guidance. Even if character did not make the ruthless Australian baron an absolute autocrat, the challenge of those desperate times would have done so. But in saving one British heritage, Murdoch destroyed another. History is rarely so convenient, but the day that production began at Wapping was the day when, to all intents and purposes, old Fleet Street ended, wrote David Kynaston, biographer of the Financial Times.

 Was even the first paper saved? Not in the opinion of many readers. Stewart argues skillfully that no dumbing down has taken place. His case is that breezy quizzical headlines, colour printing, additional supplements, the tabloid edition and online version all add tremendous value to existing virtue. In short, readers now have quantity as well as quality. In going down-market, The Times has preserved its up-market core. The author provides comparative statistics to prove that while readership has expanded, Top People (citing a Fifties advertising slogan) still read The Times. True, no other paper worldwide can quite compare with The Timess quirky features like letters, obituaries or the crossword. Yet, there is little doubt that the paper has suffered in public perception. Many regard the Financial Times as more serious, The Independent as more, well, independent as well as penetrating, and The Daily Telegraph as often offering more exhaustive coverage. Such claims cant be proved empirically, but Arthur C. Clarkes story of the butlers announcement, Three reporters, mlud, and a gentleman from The Times, seems sadly out of date. Perhaps its the times not The Times that are out of joint.

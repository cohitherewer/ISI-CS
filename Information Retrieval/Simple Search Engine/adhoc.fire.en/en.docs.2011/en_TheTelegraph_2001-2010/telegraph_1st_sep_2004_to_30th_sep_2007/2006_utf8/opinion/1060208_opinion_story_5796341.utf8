 WANING OF THE GENIUS

 Raju Mukherji

 Sachin Tendulkar is batting on borrowed time. The consistency of yore has vanished. Age has taken its toll. For 15 years, from 1989 to 2004, he served his country wonderfully well but the last two years were a drag on our patience. Exactly as Kapil Dev?s career was prolonged by two years too many. Apart from Vijay Merchant, Polly Umrigar and Sunil Gavaskar, no other top-class Indian test cricketer has retired while on top. All the other prominent test cricketers had to be shunted out by force.

 Those who saw the ball strike Tendulkar on the helmet in the third test in Karachi were appalled. Was the demi-god actually being made to dance by Shoaib Akhtar? Yes, it was a pathetic exhibition of batting from the little master. Gone were the sureness of footwork and the fluidity of stroke-play. He certainly did not give the impression of a man who had dominated world cricket for close to a decade and a half. 

 Tendulkar, however, was fortunate that the Indian media experts either did not observe his discomfiture, or did not have the courage to point it out. This has been the trend for the last two years. In New Zealand, when he had successive innings of 1, 0 and 1, he was always out to ?the best ball of the match?. In the last two years, whenever the bowling was penetrative or the match poised in an interesting situation or the conditions were difficult for batting, the Tendulkar of old was never apparent. Whenever he thrived, it was mainly against below-par bowling or on docile wickets. In the recent past, he has neither won matches for India, nor has he been able to save the team from defeat. 

 Different yardsticks

 Under various pretexts, he was not available to play often in the last couple of seasons. His elbow injury has fuelled much speculation. Although the condition is popularly known as ?tennis elbow?, no tennis player has taken as long to recover from it, nor used it to explain their failures.

 It is true that Tendulkar himself has not offered any excuses for his failures. But there are people in the media to do the explaining for him, and more in the selection committee to overlook his failures. The administration too is ever eager to welcome him back whenever he feels ready to play for India. His legion of admirers readily agrees that an ageing, unfit, Tendulkar is what India needs more than a fitter, younger man in form. Tendulkar is obviously judged using a different yardstick than would be used for an Anil Kumble or a Sourav Ganguly. These cricketers have been omitted and humiliated repeatedly. 

 Individual on top

 In India, we are more concerned about the individual than with the team. We put individual records higher than the team?s performance. We tend to forget that even the best of individuals have limited shelf-life. They must also make way for the next generation. Thus, if Tendulkar was shown the door with due courtesy when he was not doing well enough, it would have been a just act, since the yardstick applied to the rest would have been used for him too.

 But in India, the personal interest of favoured individuals is always more important than the national cause. If Kumble, Laxman and Ganguly can be dropped on grounds of age, fitness, form and the team?s requirement, why cannot the same yardstick be applied in the case of Tendulkar? Why should one man be exempted from proving his form and fitness to play for India? 

 Tendulkar would surely be ranked among the greatest of batsmen in the annals of cricket. He may also be capable of playing some good knocks in the future. But the consistency and dominance in his batting have gone for ever. It?s time he showed his character and called it a day himself.

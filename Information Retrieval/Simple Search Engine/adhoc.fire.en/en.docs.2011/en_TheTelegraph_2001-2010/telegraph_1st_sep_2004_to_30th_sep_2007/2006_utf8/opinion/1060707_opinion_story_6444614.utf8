The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WRONG SUM 

 In India, callousness can go on parading as concern. And it is deeply disturbing when children?s education is the object of this hypocrisy. The programmes put in place for literacy, primary education and universal education under 14 could have achieved far more only if there had been commitment and will. There is none of that, only half-baked short-cuts to an appearance of success. The National Commission for Minority Education Institutions has thought up a brilliant way to reduce the drop-out rate. Apparently, students from the minority community, scheduled castes and tribes and other backward classes drop out most after Class V because they cannot deal with English and mathematics. Hence the NCMEI has suggested that government schools should not ?count? English and maths in their assessment of students who are to be promoted to Class VI. No doubt the NCMEI feels that promotion to Class VI ? which would have more maths and English ? is far more important than compelling children to acquire what would be the basic skills of existence in 21st century India. And it is urgent to pretend that children do not drop out in middle school. It looks better if they trail off later.

 Policy-makers and administrators either do not have the remotest sense of what education means, or they are not interested in educating underprivileged children. Disrespect for the underprivileged is an ingrained habit, so it is no surprise that plans for their education lack the simplest perceptions. First-generation learners need special care; ignoring that will not produce natural geniuses. The NCMEI draws attention to the usual suspects, reasserting divisive categories instead of examining the problems of all underprivileged children. Its suggestion is comforting: instead of policy-makers having to pay serious attention and teachers having to be trained more intensively, let backward children learn less. Shortcuts are always simple.

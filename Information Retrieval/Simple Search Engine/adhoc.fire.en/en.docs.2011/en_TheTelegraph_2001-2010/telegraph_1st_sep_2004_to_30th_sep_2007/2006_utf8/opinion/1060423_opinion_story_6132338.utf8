The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Given the lacklustre visual side of the electoral campaign in West Bengal, the auditory aspect of the show has assumed an unprecedented importance. Unfortunately, the Trinamoolis do not seem to have much to say to their voters. At least that is what Sougata Ray?s words conveyed to those who lent him their ears at a roadside jamboree somewhere near Baishnabghata. Instead of going hammer and tongs at the usual targets ? the corrupt reds and the garrulous green ? the Trinamooli chose Star Ananda, and continued his diatribe for the entire evening. The grouse was pretty obvious. In a cross-?examination? of the relative virtues of the candidates of Dhakuria, the channel had found him falling far short of the qualifying attributes and had, therefore, ?failed? him. Is he then, courtesy HMV, continuing with a line set by someone on the other side of the gender divide? It would be pertinent to point out that the leader of the Trinamoolis had refused to give an interview to the same channel, despite having promised to do so, only a day after it featured the opinion polls that gave a thumbs down to the party. 

 A burnt out case for Ajit Singh? Not yet, perhaps. But the Meerut fire has not been a pleasant experience for the Jat leader, who shares power with the Samajwadi Party in UP. The Mulayam Singh regime?s cover-up bid after the fire, together with the murder of Singh?s close associate in Aligarh have angered the rank and file of Ajit?s party no end. He has also been sensing the growing disquiet among his minority voters who view the Samajwadi Party?s secular credentials with suspicion. Which way then? Ajit Singh is supposedly trying to tie up with the Congress-BSP combine and a berth in the cabinet. Agriculture is out, but Ajit seems to be game for anything ? mining, fertilizer...

 Someone claiming to represent LK Advani approached the defence ministry to get a defamation case withdrawn against the leader of the opposition. The case had been filed by an individual whom Advani had accused as a possible middleman in the Scorpene deal. Pranab Mukherjee?s office dutifully appealed to the Congress high command. That was when the roof fell on it. The high command, reportedly, took major offence, and asked why the request was not summarily turned down. Cornered, the defence ministry promptly dropped the case like a hot potato. 

 V Narayanswamy, the AICC gen-sec who comes from election-bound Pondicherry, is busy sweating it out in MP?s Budhini, where the BJP CM, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, is poised for a comfortable victory. Narayanswamy?s Hindi and sway over the tribal voters are, apparently, not very encouraging. But that hasn?t turned back the leader, who thinks he is doing a dry run for a chief ministership in his home state. But Congressmen in MP believe that Narayanswamy is there because madam wants him away from Pondicherry, where she is trying to shore up the party prospects!

 Another man missing from the scene of action was Digvijay Singh, who, despite being in charge of Assam, disappeared after the first phase of elections. When the second and third phase happened, Diggy Raja was holidaying in America. The buzz is that the Congress president, after getting an adverse feedback following the first phase of electioneering, divested Singh of the charge. Apparently, there were two more observers despatched to Assam after this. But Diggy or no, the reports have been as dismal. 

 Manmohan Singh is no Nehru. And given the growing dissension in the foreign ministry, the belief that Singh cannot handle foreign affairs with the same elan as the first prime minister is supposedly getting stronger. The toss up was to be between Kapil Sibal and Karan Singh, but given the latter?s performance in Nepal, the hunt for other faces may have to begin soon.

 The first call Salman Khan apparently got on his cell the moment he stepped out of the Jodhpur prison was from the royal family of UAE. The next thing was the flight to Abu Dhabi. Talk about connections!

 Footnote

 If you thought madam was the most feared figure in the Congress, you can change your views now. It?s actually her son. Rahul Gandhi, the suave, soft-spoken Nehru-Gandhi is supposed to be a stickler for punctuality. The other day, he was scheduled to see 15 people, mostly from the youth Congress from across the country, at his Tughlaq Road residence. Each was given a specific time within the space of 10 to 15 minutes. Eight of them were denied audience because they were late by a few minutes. Youth Congress members begged and cajoled, and even pretended to cry. But the yuvraj was unshaken. Nor did emotions cut much ice with the SPG, which denied them entry. There was another youth Congress leader from Delhi who had queued up despite having met Rahul only two days ago. The response was even sterner this time. He was asked not to ?waste time? hanging around in the office. At this rate, there might not be too many to shoo away, anyway.

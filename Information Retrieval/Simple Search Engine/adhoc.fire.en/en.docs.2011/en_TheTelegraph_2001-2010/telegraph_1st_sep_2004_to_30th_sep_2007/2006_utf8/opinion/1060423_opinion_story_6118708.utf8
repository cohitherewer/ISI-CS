The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Carefully careless

 Sir ? On a recent trip to Bakkhali, I was shocked to discover that tourists travelling alone are denied hotel accommodation for the night unless the police grant permission. Apparently, a few cases of suicide by tourists in hotel rooms have prompted this. The authorities have decided that they would rather drive out tourists than have any more suicides. If things stay this way, the government?s efforts to develop Bakkhali into a tourist destination will come to naught. Needless to say, the local people will suffer more than the tourists.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Prosenjit Roy,

 Old order changes

 Sir ? The decision of the Bar Council of India to do away with the colonial legacy of addressing judges as ?My Lord? or ?Your Lordship?, is a welcome move (?Lordships lost, Raj robes cling on?, April 19). Urgent reforms are also needed in other aspects of the judicial procedure. The black robe with black pockets worn by lawyers should also have been done away with. The robes had the pockets designed on them so that clients could put in them any extra money over and above the lawyers? fees, as a token of gratitude for the service provided. Nowadays, with the lawyers trying their best to milk their clients dry, the litigants are in no position to give extra money to the lawyers. Another formality that needs to be abolished is attestation from the ?Notary Public? or ?Oath Commissioner? because in most cases such authorities use this as an opportunity to fleece the people, attesting without actually checking the original documents. Why cannot the lawyers themselves attest their clients? records? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? To the ordinary man, the Indian courts have become nightmarish institutions. The shabby premises, dishonest lawyers, the prowling hangers-on, restricted access to judges, all contribute to make the applicants feel hemmed in and defeated even before the cases get started. Unfamiliar addresses like ?My Lord? and ?Your Lordship? reverberating in the dark courtrooms add to the awe. As a result, bearing with injustice seem to have become less difficult then seeking justice. The vestiges of the raj have indeed become a rather anachronistic feature of the modern Indian judicial system. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The dress code in courts is a colonial yoke which the Indian legal fraternity still bears, besides the British form of address for the judge. The latter has thankfully been made a thing of the past. A heavy black robe is inappropriate in a tropical country like India, but it continues to remain the lawyers? dress as a tribute to our colonial masters. The bar council must propose a more appropriate dress code for the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Mumbai matinee

 Sir ? In Mumbai, with hawkers, shopkeepers and manholes on footpaths, pedestrians have to walk on the roads leaving very little room for vehicles to manoeuvre. In Shanghai one drives on the right of the road, but unfortunately in Mumbai, one has to be content driving on whatever is left of the road. So the transition of Mumbai to Shanghai may be a long way ahead. With thousands migrating into the city everyday, it cannot be allowed to fend for itself. The Maharashtra government has reportedly formulated new rules to check migration into Mumbai. Currently, slum-dwellers constitute about 60 per cent of Mumbai?s population. We have to pitch in to ease the pressure on the city?s crumbling infrastructure. More of us could join the Lata Mangeshkar chorus and move on. I for one will do my bit and try and spend more time in Goa. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Aires Rodrigues, 

 Mumbai

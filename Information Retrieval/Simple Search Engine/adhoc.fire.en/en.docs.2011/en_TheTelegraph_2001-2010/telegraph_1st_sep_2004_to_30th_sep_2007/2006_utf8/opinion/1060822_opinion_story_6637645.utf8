 BALANCING ACT

 The governments reaction to the Lebanon issue will go a long way in deciding its domestic and international image, says Jyoti Malhotra

 Small offering

 The reputation of the invincible Israeli army is in shreds. After 34 days of ostensibly defending itself against the Hizbollah which included the massacre of innocent Lebanese women and children the Israelis have been brought to a standstill by the Iran-funded terrorist group. What a way to go in the New Middle East of Condoleezza Rice-George Bush! 

 As for India, the governments demeaning offer of a paltry Rs 10 crore to aid the reconstruction of Lebanon succinctly defines New Delhis active disinterest in its larger neighbourhood. For all the wordplay indulged in by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, in parliament a couple of weeks ago before the House condemned the Israeli invasion of Lebanon the fact is that the Congress government is so fearful of what its newfound friend and partner, the United States of America, might say about Indian support for the underdogs in the Middle East that it is performing its best ostrich take on the situation. 

 After the continuing disaster that is the US war in Iraq (more than 3,500 Iraqis alone were killed in the month of July) and the consequent demonization of Iran, Indian opinion is hugely inflamed by the Bush administrations myopic view of Islam and the world. And despite all the protestations by Bush-Blair to the contrary, large parts of the Islamic world and India amongst them are beginning to believe that there is a deliberate blurring of lines between Islam and fundamentalism. 

 When Muslims and terrorists begin to become synonymous, it is a short hop, skip and jump to the dangerous phraseology of a simplistic mind. George W. Bush may have expanded his personal lexicon with Islamic fascists in the wake of the Heathrow plot, but it is a phrase that is still reverberating around the world, conjuring up images of a rerun of the thousand-year war between Christianity and Islam. 

 This apparently deliberate confrontation between two of the worlds greatest faiths can only have the most dreadful of consequences for nations like India. Fourteen per cent of Indias one-billion-plus people are Muslims and they are watching what the Congress government is able or capable of doing when things look like they are beginning to fall apart. We are not talking of Narendra Modi here or even the aftermath of the latest Mumbai bomb blasts. We are talking about Lebanon and the historic nuclear agreement between India and the US. 

 To be sure, the nuclear deal is good for both India and the US. When the prime minister stood up to defend himself as well as his governments record in signing the accord with George Bushs America in parliament last week, it was an honourable defence. I will not apologize for my conviction that India needs to be friends with America, the prime minister said, and of course, he was right. By any reasoning, it is important to be friends with the most powerful nation on earth. 

 And yet when this nation invades another independent country Iraq not because it has any weapons of mass destruction, not because it has large tracts of oil or because of the desperately-felt need to democratize its teeming Muslim population, but because George Bush Jr wanted to do to Saddam Hussein what the latter did to his father in the first Gulf War, then it must be time to stand up. And tell America that the destruction of Babylon and Mesopotamia all to catch a thief called Saddam Hussein is horribly wrong. 

 So it has been with Iran, and now Lebanon. The world knows that Tehran funds the Hizbollah, an acknowledged terrorist group worldwide, and that the Hizbollah and the Israelis are sworn enemies. But the world also believes that America and Israel had pre-emptively decided that it must be time to teach the Hizbollah and its masters, the Iranians a good lesson. That the capture of two Israeli soldiers by the Hizbollah was a mere pretext to start a fullscale war by the invincible Israeli army against Hizbollah-Tehran. The world knows that despite the massacre of innocent children in Qana, America and Israel felt that the war must go on. 

 And what does India do in response to this horrific dehumanization of the Middle East ? It issues a few token resolutions in condemnation and announces aid worth Rs 10 crore. The prime minster, currently also foreign minister, and a previous finance minister, obviously thinks it is enough. 

 Outside 7, Race Course Road, where the prime minister lives, there is another world though. Many worlds, in fact. And in many of them, including in the otherwise completely self-centred worlds of Indias metros, it is being said that India is being restrained from manifesting a full-blooded disavowal of the Iraq-Iran- Lebanon crisis because the all-important nuclear deal is still in the works and it cannot be the time to upset America. 

 Is this true? Maybe, maybe not. If it is, then the Congress and the ministry of external affairs could soon be at loggerheads. There are less than six months to go for the all-important elections in Uttar Pradesh, and although foreign affairs, especially the war in Lebanon, is unlikely to be an election matter, the mood of a people or a wave is often a function of several calculations. One of them is how independent-minded your own government has been in being able to distinguish right from wrong. 

 Just as the Indo-US deal is a sign of the maturity of India, similarly, the Congress must realize that its inability to criticize America on issues like Iran, Iraq or Lebanon, is hardly doing justice to its own reputation. Few people want the Congress to do itself the disservice of revelling in a third-world, non-aligned cocktail that does not exist, and possibly never has. But the people also want the government to be able to think through things for itself. 

 Perhaps Pranab Mukherjee, defence minister and possibly one of the oldest Congressmen of our times, is able to manifest this multi-purpose intent like few other people in the government today. And so the MEA has been told to prepare a proper reconstruction plan for Lebanon, while the army is in the act of putting together a field hospital or so. Meanwhile, Indian peacekeeping soldiers, mandated to keep the peace on the Lebanese-Israeli border under UN command, will not allow themselves to become part of a US-French stabilization force in the same region. 

 Perhaps Mukherjee knows that on the streets of America, this ability to play several sides at the same time is unerringly described as walking and chewing gum at the same time.

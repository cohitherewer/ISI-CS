 LOVE ON SAIL

 Neha Sahay

 It might be making news all over the world, but the Shanghai millionaires love cruise is hardly known in China outside Shanghai. Most 20-somethings looked blank when asked if they wanted to be on it. Meant exclusively for men worth at least 2 million yuan, who are too busy to find love, and women who are college educated, good looking and desirable, the final count on the glittering, festooned boat called Captain One when it set sail on the Huangpu river was 50. Tickets for the enchanted evening cost 28,000 yuan. Normally, a cruise down Shanghais famous waterfront costs 50 yuan.

 But here, the fee gave you more than just an evening with pretty women and a view of Pudong. The advantage of wealth gave the millionaires the privilege of choosing three prospective partners from a catalogue, and also becoming members of the exclusive diamond bachelors dating website that had organized the cruise.

 The 20 millionaires who finally made it were worth far more than the qualifying amount. They included one woman. Accompanying them were 30 women who had been selected twice first after having been interviewed by the organizers, second, after the millionaires had picked them out. About 1000 had applied. Private rooms were available on the boat for those seriously interested in finding true love.

 In Old China, before the 1949 Communist Party takeover, it was common for poor village girls to be married off to rich old men. The communists put an end to that, allowing youngsters to choose their own partners of course with the approval of the party. But today, the wheel has come full circle with a vengeance : young girls dont need parents to sell themselves to the rich.

 Rich pickings

 What is interesting is the fact that this cruise has not merited a comment from the official media. China Daily, Shanghai Star and the official womens organizations mag zine carried reports with the headline: When beauty meets the rich. The coverage was revealing: the women were photographed but only the millionaires interviewed. As flash bulbs popped, the women boarding the boat covered their faces, or wore silver eye masks. Though it was a cold, rainy evening, brief shorts and spaghetti straps were much in evidence, as also fur wraps. There was only one picture of the men taken inside the boat. It showed suited, middle-aged men seated around a long table, while one young girl sat in a corner behind them, playing on her mobile.

 The interviews were equally revealing: a 50-plus divorcee claimed his kids had wanted to come along to cheer him on, while a 34-year-old explained that most of the beautiful young things he met were not the kind to win husbands. The lone millionairess, a 37-year-old, revealed she had already found a boyfriend from the website, but this cruise gave her one more chance to look at the field. The owner of the website said he ranked members in terms of social status. That included age, wealth and education, and those heading the list got more chances to choose better women. What these rich men want is a woman who is a bit more than normal, he explained. 

 What do normal Chinese girls feel? Another splash in the materialistic pond, was how 25-year-old Huang Xing dismissed the cruise. College-educated, English speaking Xing, child of wealthy parents, lives on her own and works in a foreign company. Currently single, after two failed relationships, Xing is a non-conformist: no make-up, natural hair, and almost always casually dressed. 

 Xu Mei, on the other hand, is an elegant, fashionable software designer who moved to Shanghai from a small town a year back, but is yet to come to terms with the stress of city life. With a devoted boyfriend who left a secure job to be near her, Mei finds the idea of such a cruise nice, but Im not interested, thanks.

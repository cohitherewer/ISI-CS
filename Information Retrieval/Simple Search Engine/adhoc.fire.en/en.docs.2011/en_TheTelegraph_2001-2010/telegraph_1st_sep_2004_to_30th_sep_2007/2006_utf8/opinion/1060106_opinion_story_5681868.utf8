 WHEN THE TOUGH GET GOING

 House rules

 Making News: Women in Journalism

 By Ammu Joseph, 

 Penguin, Rs 325

 The fact that a book gets to be written on women in journalism can serve as a comment on the situation of women in this profession. Women remain a minority in the media even today ? their share of media employment in India is only 12 per cent, as Ammu Joseph points out. This shouldn?t be surprising, given the kind of problems that women in journalism still have to face ? from fighting against male prejudices, sexual harassment, coping with late hours, to trying to balance work and family. This is not to say that men do not face any problems, but the nature of their problems is different and seldom related to their gender. 

 It is unfortunate that even after so many years of women?s liberation movements, issues of gender inevitably come up in any assessment of a woman?s achievement. At the same time, it is heartening that women are fighting back. More than 200 women in journalism find their voice in Joseph?s work. Joseph herself is an acclaimed journalist of the country with a longstanding commitment to issues of gender, children, health and human development. Her first-hand experience of the profession restrains her from painting too optimistic a picture of women in the print media. She does not shy away from facts, with the result that the book is a hard-hitting account of the obstacles faced by women as they struggle to ?make news?. 

 Many of the women interviewed in the book dismiss the notion that professional perspectives and practices are affected by gender. They resist the label, ?woman journalist?, because they feel that it is irrelevant and demeaning. Ironically for the women in the profession, they often find themselves writing on gender issues or taking a gendered perspective. This does not necessarily imply prejudiced writing since women have been found to handle issues like rape, dowry or sexual harassment with greater empathy and sensitivity than men. Joseph quotes Shobhaa De as saying that it is neither possible nor desirable to free oneself from considerations of gender. What the women in the media fight against are gender stereotypes which try to coerce them into accepted patterns of behaviour. And it seems that they have largely succeeded, since women have graduated from covering flower shows to hard news areas like war, communal violence, politics, defence and international relations.

 If Making News is a celebration of those women who have achieved success in the print media, it also reminds us that the pressure to perform is much more on women than on their male counterparts. And even if they succeed, women often find their accomplishments attributed not to their competence but to the misuse of their gender. As it emerges from Joseph?s study, for a woman professional, it always cuts both ways. 

 Perhaps it is not surprising that the problems encountered by women in the media remain the same the world over. Given the almost deterministic pattern within which women have to operate, those who have been successful in proving that sex is not destiny can become role-models for women in journalism. The author herself happens to be one such. Making News gains credibility from its unflattering look into the heart of the matter. And because Joseph does not glorify or distort, her book can serve as a guide to those women who aspire to make journalism their career. Perhaps it is time for the women in the media to look reality in the eye and shatter the glass, darkly.

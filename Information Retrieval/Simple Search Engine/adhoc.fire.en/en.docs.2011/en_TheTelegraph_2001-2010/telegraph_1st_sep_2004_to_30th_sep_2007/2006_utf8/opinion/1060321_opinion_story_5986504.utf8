 Letters to Editor

 Stand alone

 Sir ? In ?Already too late? (March 17), Ashok Mitra demonstrates, quite unwittingly, how the communists in India have failed to keep up with the changing times. But then the political left in India has always been a hopelessly confused lot. It opposes the Bush administration for the brutality in Iraq, but conveniently forgets the millions killed during Stalin?s regime. The leftists are against the Indo-US nuclear deal but keep silent on China?s supply of missiles to Pakistan. They are afraid of India becoming a ?banana republic? if it moves closer to America. But are Cuba, North Korea or Venezuela glorious examples of democracy and freedom despite distancing themselves from the United States of America? 

 Mitra fails to see that in these days of globalization, India, or any country for that matter, cannot survive by being rabidly anti-US. The communists should accept that the the US is the only superpower today and even China and Russia are doing business with it. He is right to note that both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party share a common view on India?s relationship with the US. That is not surprising given that both parties are pragmatic enough to keep India?s interests in mind. The communists meanwhile continue to thrive on borrowed ideology. It is good that they have decided not to withdraw support from the United Progressive Alliance government. For if they had done so, they would have ensured their political death. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra has an uncanny knack of complicating simple issues and also seems to suffer from selective amnesia. He suspects that the Congress and the BJP have come to a tacit understanding to execute the American agenda in India. This apart, he cites several instances where the Congress and the BJP have come to each other?s aide. But he conveniently forgets that the left too had propped up V.P. Singh?s National Front government in 1989 against the Congress together with the BJP. The left also did not mind allying with the Indian Union Muslim League in 1967 in Kerala inspite of its secular rhetoric. 

 The sole purpose of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the last few years has been to retain its stronghold in the two states of West Bengal and Tripura, to snatch power in Kerala whenever possible and to enjoy the benefits of political rule at the Centre without sharing the responsibility. The Left Front will continue to support the UPA so long as it suits its purpose. The Congress, on the other hand, has a short-term agenda of enjoying power at the Centre and is happy to allow the left the space it wants in Bengal and Tripura. In fact, there is no ideological conflict between the Congress and the CPI(M) at present as none has any particular ideology to uphold. It is a marriage of convenience. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? How can Ashok Mitra be so sure that the left ?will not touch the BJP with a bargepole?? The left had once allied with V.P. Singh to throw Rajiv Gandhi out. Today the same left has abjectly surrendered to the Congress led by Rajiv Gandhi?s wife in order to keep the communal BJP out. The facial expression of Sitaram Yechuri in the picture accompanying the article says it all. Mitra would do well not to be so certain of left behaviour in the future. Especially now that it has tasted the fruits of power. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Naked facts

 Sir ? Khushwant Singh criticizes Hindus for objecting to M.F. Husain?s portrayal of goddesses in the nude (?Where there is a will?, March 18). Perhaps Singh should now advise Husain to do a painting each of Guru Govind Singh, Prophet Mohammad and Jesus Christ in the same style he adopts with goddesses. As Husain?s brand ambassador, Singh can educate the people of these communities on the freedom of expression, the finer points of art and so on. Of course, it would be prudent for both Singh and Husain to take out a substantial life insurance policy before they embark on the plan.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Dutta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It was shocking to read Khushwant Singh?s views on the controversial M.F. Husain paintings. But why does he castigate only Bajrang Dalis and Shiv Sainiks for protesting against the paintings of Hindu goddesses? They created mass reactions the world over. Talking about Hindu religion, one must say that Singh is only just superficially aware of the literal meaning of the scriptures and totally unaware of their implicit meaning. As for Hindu temples, Singh seems to have concentrated only on those carvings that interest him. What about the other carvings found in the temple? That of an ideal kitchen, for example? According to Hinduism, there are four aims of life ? dharma (right conduct), artha (material gain), kama (desires), and moksha (salvation). Everything depicted in the Hindu religion or in the temples help mortals achieve these aims in life. 

 Husain was summoned by the Indore court for the nude painting of Mother India and no true Indian citizen will ever tolerate this. Another thing. Why is Singh silent on the worldwide protests against the cartoons of the Prophet? Is it fear or sycophancy?

 Yours faithfully,

Sujatha K. Thacker, Dhanbad

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Malvika Singh?s article, ?Post haste to the past? (March 14), presents a prejudiced picture. Singh says that the draft bill, which would disallow courier services, is ?non democratic?. But the bill can only become law if the elected representatives of the country pass it. Besides, the bill aims to delimit transmission of articles by courier only up to a certain weight and not all articles, as claimed by Singh. This practice is prevalent in other countries too. 

 It may be right to say that dependence on the government?s postal service alone indicates a ?slide backwards?. But how can Singh say that inefficiency afflicts the Indian postal service alone and not the courier services as well? This is not to condone the frequent lapses on the part of the postal department, but one needs to take into account the thousands of post-offices spread across the country to gauge the problems faced by the department. It is also necessary to consider the services rendered by the postal department in the rural areas, especially to the underprivileged. The courier services are mainly confined to the cities and most of the courier companies are led by the single aim of reaping profit. Clearly, there is a need for regulating this sector, which is functioning arbitrarily.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Walia, Shillong

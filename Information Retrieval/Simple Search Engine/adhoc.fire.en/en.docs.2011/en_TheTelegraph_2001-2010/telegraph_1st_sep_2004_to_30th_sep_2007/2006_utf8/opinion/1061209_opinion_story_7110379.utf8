The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNHOLY AND CORRUPT

 THIS ABOVE ALL KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Pious offering

 An anecdote was fabricated about Jathedar Gurcharan Singh Tohra, who was elected president of the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee for a record period of 18 years. It was said that once as the jathedar was leaving the Golden Temple, he was accosted by an elderly woman who touched his feet and placed a 10-rupee note on them. Taken aback, Tohra protested: Bibi, go and place this money in front of the Granth Sahib. The lady replied: Jathedar-ji, it will ultimately come to you, so why do I have to go through the ritual and not hand it directly to you? 

 There is no substance in the story. Jathedar Tohra was a wily politician and used the SGPCs enormous income from offerings to keep his stranglehold on the many institutions run by it, and to ensure his being re-elected year after year. But unlike other leaders, he never feathered his own nest. He lived a spartan life of a small farmer in his village. The story gained currency because it made a point. All religious institutions, be they Hindu, Muslim or Sikh, are corrupt to the core. Since offerings are made in cash, opportunities of pilferage are plentiful. That is why every time they have elections, candidates fight like dogs to get elected. They are not motivated by sewa of their gurus or the panth but greed for power, patronage and money (golak, the brass pitcher in which the offerings are put). K.J.S. Ahluwalia of Amritsar, who specializes in fabricating new versions of abbreviations at times he sends me ten postcards a day with his suggestions writes it was time that the SGPC was renamed Shiromani Golak Prabandhak Committee. 

 Personally, I am for the government taking over the management of all religious institutions and appointing civil servants belonging to the community to manage them. I am sure many people will agree with me. I am equally sure that this is not likely to happen as no government, Central or state, would be able to stand up against the onslaught of vested interests and bigots construing the move as an attack on religion. Even states run by the communists havent dared to make a move in that direction. Our best bet is to build up public opinion against the skulduggery rampant in the managements of our temples, mosques, dargahs, gurdwaras and shrines not to destroy religions but to prevent squandering money on meaningless rituals (eg, organizing massive processions comprising elephants, horses, gutka groups, bands on the pretext that they are Nagar Keertans), but to restore religious practises to their pristine purity. 

 For better or for verse

 Many years ago, the Bangalore Press Club invited me to be the chief guest at their annual function. All the speeches were in Kannada of which I could not understand a word. However, my ear caught one name which I understood Dronacharya. I presumed it referred to me as the teacher of journalistic archery. I was mighty pleased. Although I taught no one anything, quite a few of my younger colleagues hit the target, some got the bulls eye and did a lot better than I. I also put up a few budding authors and poets who made names for themselves. My formula was simple: I read the first few paragraphs of unsolicited manuscripts and decided whether or not they deserved to be read by a publisher. With poetry it was even simpler: I read the first few verses and decided whether or not the rest was worth the trouble. Most of it was teenage stuff composed before the composer has grasp of the language and sent to me by doting mothers to encourage their offspring. So my first question to them was, How old is your child? and gave an appropriate response.

 My latest discovery is barely a month old. A female voice from Chandigarh asked me timidly: Will you be good enough to read my poems in English and Hindi and tell me if they are good enough for publication?

 How old are you? I asked.

 Twenty-nine.

 Okay! post some to me.

 I read the poems and was immediately impressed. The ones in Hindi were in Devnagri script, but the vocabulary was Urdu something I wholly approve of. 

 Sumita Misra came to meet me a few days later. I discovered that she is an IAS officer with the government of Haryana. She belongs to a family of doctors: father, mother and brother. She was a topper in school and college, was in the top ten in the civil service exams. Her mother is a sardarni, her husband a sardar, an engineer-cum-farmer. She sticks to her maiden name. 

 I reproduce the first three verses of a poem entitled Except Love. You can decide for yourself. 

 There are no revelations

 Except love.

 In this forsaken planet of sighs

 The spaces of eternity are created 

 Amidst the rubbing of tongues and 

 thighs.

 The dance of bodies was original 

 worship

 Its after tremble a perpetual prayer.

 There are no songs

 Except love.

 Since, frozen crystalline polar, 

 sweeps

 Through the veins and dells of 

 humanity

 Unless shattered by the delirious 

 screams 

 The throaty private laughter 

 Only lovers everywhere share.

 There are no words 

 Except love.

 The chant of protoplasm was passion

 The thirst of soul, the deep sleeping 

 pain

 Awakening, climbing to unsought 

 wisdom,

 The world of raw thought, impetuous 

 poems opens

 Mortgaged timelessly to love.

 Plain as water

 Thunder is a rich source of loudness. Water is composed of two gins, Oxygin and Hydrogin. Oxygin is pure gin. Hydrogin is gin and water. 

 H2O is hot water and CO2 is cold water.

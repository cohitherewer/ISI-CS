 PLAYING THE DOCTOR

 Furthering bilateral ties with an eastern neighbour on the boil will severely test the skills of the new foreign minister, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Wounds that need healing

 On Friday, October 13, Bangladesh proved all astrologers, soothsayers and men in suits throughout the world wrong when Muhammed Yunus, the worlds banker to the poor, won the coveted Nobel Peace prize. Two weeks later, Bangladesh was in the headlines again for all the wrong and yet all-too-familiar reasons. President Iajuddin Ahmed, once an adviser to the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party, named himself head of the caretaker government, evoking street protests from the opposition Awami League and widespread criticism from the intelligentsia. 

 In the midst of this pendulum swing, India, at last, named a new high commissioner to Bangladesh. This put to an end the internal crisis generated by the resignation of Veena Sikri after she was superseded by the foreign secretary, Shiv Shankar Menon, to the top job. Pinak Chakraborty, currently chief of protocol in the capital, will soon take over as Indias man in Dhaka. 

 In the capital that is otherwise obsessed with Pakistan, the establishment is sounding much concerned about Indias highly volatile eastern frontier. At home in his Jangipur constituency in Murshidabad considerably closer to Bangladesh than New Delhi the foreign minister, Pranab Mukherjee, carefully voiced the governments anxiety. As a neighbour we are interested in Bangladesh remaining peaceful and stable, Mukherjee said. The statement came in the wake of a meeting between the foreign secretary and the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in Calcutta, where the situation in Bangladesh was discussed. 

 Mukherjees cryptic comments, a far cry from the observations of his predecessor, K. Natwar Singh, and even the occasionally outspoken national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, will breathe fresh life into a foreign office that still prefers controlled understatements to breathless soundbytes. 

 Whether on Bangladesh or Pakistan, Mukherjee has asserted that his government will speak in one voice. That is, whatever the points of view the many arms of the government may have and in a democracy there will be many they will all be distilled in one voice that will be his. 

 Mukherjees reclamation of the foreign office as his turf is already being welcomed by the Indian foreign service. Not only in the last two-odd years of the United Progressive Alliance government, but also in the previous six years of the Vajpayee government, the prime ministers office had established such complete authority over foreign policy that the foreign office had been reduced to little more than a rubber stamp. 

 And yet, Mukherjee, back in the ministry of external affairs after ten long years, will find that the world has changed considerably since then. As raksha mantri, he was well aware of the problems of infiltration and terrorism on both frontiers with Bangladesh and Pakistan. 

 Both issues, especially on the Bangladesh front, have been argued in some detail by M.K. Narayanan. The argument of the intelligence agency is that both Bangladesh and Nepal have emerged as the new hand-maidens of Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. That is, the ISI is increasingly using Indias other neighbours as the launch-pad for jihad activities in India. 

 To be sure, Mukherjee cannot be accused of being a bleeding heart liberal, who would rather light candles at Wagah. At the defence secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan on Siachen some months ago, Mukherjee told the press at the end of the first day that the talks had failed. This, when there was one whole day left for the talks to finish. 

 Similarly, the new foreign minister is keenly aware that peace and stability on the eastern front is tied up with peace and security on Indias western flank. To be sure, infiltration on the India-Bangladesh border is an extremely common occurrence. Many vouch for the bribery that thrives whether in connivance with errant Border Security Force officials or by virtue of the black market economy. 

 Heres a story from a couple of years ago. A Rs 50 bribe will allow you to cross the unfenced border, that is far from the prying eyes of the police. A Rs 100 bribe will enable the same border police to keep their eyes tightly shut while you disappear into the green rice fields on the other side. For a handsome Rs 150, the policeman could even put you on the pillion of his motorcycle and drive you across. 

 The point of the story is that Khaleda Zias BNP may or may not actively allow her country to be used to foment anti-Indian insurgency; her son, Tariq Zia, even as he tightens control over the party, may or may not have increasing influence over his countrys intelligence apparatus; and the Bangladesh government may or may not be increasingly hostile to the resident Hindu population, thereby exacerbating an unreported exodus into India. 

 Even if all of the above were true, one has to say that India has hardly moved to expand its natural influence over Bangladesh. Veena Sikri, the former high commissioner, was often in hot water with the government, either because of her blunt manner that made no bones about who was at fault (usually Dhaka was), or because Dhaka could not bear to agree with New Delhi. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, hours before he flew into Dhaka for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit a year ago, spoke of the failed states in Indias neighbourhood, hardly a fence-mending exercise with Bangladesh. 

 But New Delhis worst failure, in all the years since 1971, when Indira Gandhi mid-wifed the birth of a new nation, has been its refusal to take due cognizance of its neighbours, except, of course, Pakistan. Only when the crisis reaches the boiling point does India seem to wake up, as it happened with Nepal in April. And if it were not for Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary, even the Kathmandu story would be a failure. 

 The same is true with regard to Bangladesh. The Indian government focuses on its relationship with Dhaka in fits and starts. Mostly, it is a negative one. Very little attempt is made to project Indias now-famous soft power into this part of the world. The story of Indian Council for Cultural Relations sending tablas most of which tore the first time a fist went into the drum to Dhaka, when Rakesh Kumar (now under the CBI scanner) was director-general, epitomizes the sad state of our bilateral relationship. 

 Clearly, Pranab Mukherjee has his task cut out for him. November promises to be an exciting month, with the resumed foreign secretary-level dialogue with Pakistan, the visit of the Pakistan foreign minister, Khurshid Kasuri, for the wedding of Mani Shankar Aiyars daughter, the possibility of the passage of the Indo-US nuclear agreement in Washington and the visit of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao. 

 In the middle of all this, Indo-Bangla ties will burst a boil or two. It is up to Pranab Mukherjee to control the bleed, apply salve, perhaps even cauterize the wound and fix the problem. All the while, he will have to smile and reassure the patient that all will be well. The new foreign minister just needed to know how to become a doctor as well.

 PEACE WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE 

 TWENTY-TWENTY -BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Best of two worlds

 Even if the rest of India has not noticed, a historic breakthrough has taken place in the peace talks with the Nagas. After nine years of negotiations between New Delhi and the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), the Phizo doctrine has been finally buried.

 Its underlying principles were that the Nagas will not have anything to do with India, that they will be independent and sovereign and that they will not recognize the Indian Constitution. Naga leaders are now attempting to re-interpret these principles in the present context.

 Today, the Nagas want a relationship with India. They have conceptualized a sophisticated notion of shared sovereignty; and have agreed to analyze the Indian Constitution to see how the demand for a separate Naga constitution can be made consistent with it.

 A crucial part of the draft non-paper broadly accepted by the NSCN (I-M) and New Delhi reads as follows:

 An important element of the agreement will be that Nagalim/land will have its own constitution which will cover the areas of its own competencies. This constitution will be consistent with the fundamental principles (such as democracy, protection of human rights, secularism, and republicanism) and framework of the Constitution of India and will incorporate relevant parts of it, and will be developed in close consultation with the Government of India and with the participation of the Naga people.

 In agreeing to this formulation, three crucial principles have been accepted by the NSCN (I-M) leaders. One, that they accept the fundamental principles of the Indian Constitution. Two, that they accept the framework of the Indian Constitution (while not accepting the Constitution itself in its present form). And three, that relevant parts of the Indian Constitution will be incorporated in their separate constitution in consultation with the Naga people.

 This is the major achievement of the latest round of peace talks held in Bangkok from July 29 to 31. The Indian negotiators have also agreed to this path-breaking framework proposed by Michael Van Walt of Kreddha, a Dutch NGO. The framework, in addition to the above principles, also seeks to create a relationship between New Delhi and the Nagas that reflects and safeguards the unique history and situation of the Nagas and fosters unity within a federal structure.

 The relationship itself will be set out in an agreement between the Nagas and New Delhi and would form the basis of the constitutional relationship between them. The agreement would set out the division of competencies (subjects to be governed by each separately and jointly specified in the Union, State and Concurrent lists of the Indian Constitution) between the two. The agreement would then be incorporated in both the Indian Constitution and the Naga constitution.

 It has been proposed that the Indian Constitution would recognize the validity of the Naga constitution. This would form the basis of authorizing India to set the Naga constitution within the framework of the Constitution of India. Adding a separate chapter to the Indian Constitution to give effect to the relationship could do this.

 The agreed competencies of the Union will be given a legal effect in the Indian Constitution, the Naga competencies in the Naga constitution, and the concurrent or joint competencies in both the constitutions.

 Using these principles, it is proposed that the two sides would together analyze the Indian Constitution part-by-part and article-by-article to see what will apply, not apply or apply with modification to the Nagas. The agreement reached will be incorporated both in the Constitution of India and that of the Nagas in such a way that it cannot be changed unilaterally.

 However, only principles for the settlement have been agreed upon. The settlement itself is nowhere near.

 Not all the issues that New Delhi and the NSCN (I-M) have with this framework have been resolved. Indian negotiators may still say that what the Nagas are agreeing to is not explicit enough to give them confidence for a permanent settlement. They have, however, not ruled out a separate Naga constitution at this stage. They see it as one of many options on where to place the agreed competencies of the Nagas in a separate chapter of the Indian Constitution, in a separate annexure to the Constitution or by expanding the existing provisions of the Constitution such as Article 371 (A).

 Thuingaleng Muivah, on the other hand, is insistent that the Nagas cannot accept the Constitution of India. The key terms for him are separate constitution and joint competencies to be exercised in a federal relationship.

 Yet the broad agreement on a framework to settle the Naga issue is unprecedented. It takes the more-than-five-decade-old Naga problem on the path to a solution. This is the result of the wisdom and sagacity shown not only by Isak Chishi Swu and Thuingaleng Muivah, the chairman and general secretary, respectively, of the NSCN (I-M), but also the changing attitude of the government and its negotiators. Both the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and his national security advisor, M.K. Narayanan, seem convinced that a settlement with the Nagas is finally possible.

 However, different arms of the government especially the intelligence agencies and the army are following contradictory strategies on the Naga issue. This can seriously endanger the historic opportunity for peace that has arisen now.

 Naga groups opposed to the peace process are not only being propped up but are being actively armed. The NSCN (Khaplang), which has been used by the government as a foil to the NSCN (I-M), is reported to have received a significant consignment of brand new AK-series rifles and ammunition recently.

 The sudden inflow of weapons to the Khaplang faction has been reported to New Delhi by one of its own agencies. At about two lakh rupees each, such weapons can neither be financed by Naga politicians inimical to the settlement nor by the security forces deployed in the region. The needle of suspicion points to one of the agencies of the government. This policy of competitive militancy is likely to be counter-productive in the case of the Nagas also as it has been in the past elsewhere in the Northeast, Punjab and in Sri Lanka.

 Among the obligations devolving on Delhi in the new context is to ensure as a matter of priority that the ground situation remains peaceful. The cease-fire monitoring needs to be strengthened. One way of achieving this is to have a core group with permanent members within the home ministry to deal with all cease-fire violations who will have a mission-oriented approach. Peripatetic additional secretaries and joint secretaries, with their short-tenures, cannot do this.

 With peace in sight, the government needs to speak in one voice and ensure that no discordant notes are struck by any of its agencies. For the last couple of years, the two NSCN factions were trying to unify. The Indian security forces sabotaged their efforts. New Delhi was responsible for the split in NSCN in the first place. Today, it is time to encourage the Nagas to unite. The attempt should be to consolidate the constituency for peace. There cannot be more than one permanent Naga settlement acceptable to all the Naga tribes and political factions.

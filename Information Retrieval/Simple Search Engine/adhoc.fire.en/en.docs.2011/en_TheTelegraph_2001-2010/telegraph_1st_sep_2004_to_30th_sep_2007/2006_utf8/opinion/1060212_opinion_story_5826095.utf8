 Letters to Editor

 Paradise found

 Sir ? The report, ?Indonesia?s Garden of Eden reveals itself?(Feb 8), shows that there is still a place on this planet untouched by the ravages of ?civilization?. The Foja mountain in New Guinea is said to harbour innumerable new species of flora and fauna. It is inspiring to think that if there is one such place, there could be others as well. Only days back, a new species of a fox-like creature was discovered in south-east Asia. Let us hope that the slew of discoveries does not invite a predatory and destructive science to the region.

 Yours faithfully,

Nabin Sen Sharma, Calcutta 

 Time to play

 Sir ? The non-governmental organizations have done society a service by lodging a public interest litigation in the Supreme Court in order to ban child labour in the country (?Child labour notices to govts?, Feb 2). Almost 10 crore children in the 6-14 years age group are employed as labourers at various work places. Most of them are from families living below the poverty line. These children, owing to their pitiable financial conditions, are compelled to work in tea shops, households (or any organization willing to employ them) by their parents. Apart from forcing the government to arrange for compulsory schooling for them, NGOs should ensure that they are provided with at least two square meals a day and their parents get some sort of compensation for the loss of their children?s earnings. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report, ?Child labour notices to govts?, reminds us of the sad plight of the children in our country. How can the country progress if the future generation is neglected this way? Given the circumstances, the stern legal measures taken by the Supreme Court are welcome. However, the families of these rehabilitated children are bound to suffer as a result of the ban. Hence education and employment need to be provided to these children at the same time. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Nirmala, Calcutta

 Run away

 Sir ? Accidents can happen any time. But rashness and irresponsibility are not expected from the executive of a renowned private bank (?Corporate star in hit- amp;-run?, Feb 6). The allegations of misconduct against Neel Chatterjee, vice-president of Standard Chartered Bank, shows his disregard for human life. His driving licence should be cancelled and the bank should take disciplinary action against him. Street rowdies are already a menace in cities; at least the so-called ?educated? and ?responsible? people should show more road sense. India is already notorious for being only next to China in the number of casualties in traffic accidents. Strict measures should be enforced to curb such crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar.

 Sir ? The recent hit-and- run case that involved the Standard Chartered Bank vice-president reveals the real face of the rich in our society. Nowadays, most private organizations are trying to showcase themselves as torchbearers of social responsibility through newspaper advertisements. This case turns such pretension on their head. Neel Chatterjee not only hit the poor man but also misbehaved with the police who tried to corner him. Even though laboratory tests have proved that Chatterjee was drunk, in all probability, the evidence will be suppressed and Chatterjee will escape without a scratch. Like so many others cases invol ving celebrities, this might too drag on interminably, giving the culprit enough time to find a way to shut up the family of the watchman. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Harikumar, Durgabari, Agartala

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOO OLD TO DELIVER 

 Malvika Singh

 Post all fools day on the first of April, two aspiring prime ministers, one from the Bharatiya Janata Party and the other from the Congress, the two ?national? parties, have made us all look like a bunch of intellectually backward species. Editorials in all the dailies have ridiculed both along with their divisive agendas. This breed of aging politicians carrying the ?divide and rule? ethos must be voted out. They are regressive, incapable of creative thinking, and unable to generate radical new ideas that could help lessen the gap of disparities both social and economic. Instead, these old men, clinging to the last vestiges of ?power?, are detrimental forces in a country that has been forcibly held back for decades. To divide this country further on the lines of both caste and faith is unacceptable and can only damage the polity. Those who indulge in this kind of politics are in fact betraying the spirit of an India aspiring to change and grow. 

 Old and infirm, Arjun Singh has been fairly immobilized over recent months. To leave a critical ministry in his care is wrong to say the least. Further, to leave a ministry that deals with education and learning in the care of a person who is stuck in a time warp and unable to recognize the new language on the wall, is plain dangerous. He harps on and on about being secular and passionate about keeping neo- nationalism at bay but he must understand that there are hundreds of people who are neither lefties nor left congressmen who believe in egalitarianism and all policies and laws that are inclusive. Singh is forging a new kind of discrimination. He is disrupting the system as he departs from it, ensuring further chaos. This should be unacceptable to the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, and the rest of the cabinet. Arjun Singh gets away with this backward mindset because he sends out a signal that implies he is close to the Congress president. He plays the game of politics like a seasoned player. He does not have the greatness to let go and nurse his aging mind and body.

 New blood

 L.K. Advani never moves away from his repetitive chorus from atop a luxurious vehicle as he yatras across poverty-ridden India. He too, like his colleague in the ruling coalition, does not have the inner strength to let go and support a new generation to steer the BJP ahead. This living in a failed past is scary too. Listening to a rhetoric that ceased to make sense decades ago, that excluded not only other communities and faiths in our pluralist society but also many within the greater Hindu fold, the Jains, followers of the Bhakti and Sufi traditions, all of whom draw extensively from Hinduism and other religions. To even think of polarizing and thereby diluting the most fundamental asset of this sub-continent smacks of a total lack of understanding of this formidable civilization that has survived many invasions.

 It is time we discarded all those who perpetuate obstacles in new thought and fresh action by defeating them at the hustings. If some political entities are placed in certain ministries to ?accommodate? them because of some past ?deed?, or to appease partners who did not have the wherewithal to join government, share responsibilities and be accountable, they must be removed. Dynamic leaders must be given ministerial responsibility and a time frame in which to deliver the actuals of a policy initiative. This constant pussyfooting about is another type of ?divide and rule? syndrome that numbs all change, freezes and petrifies growth. It also spells a complete disregard for the next generation. It is intolerable.

 Those who should have passed on into retirement and have clung to office for dear life must be retired from office. The mind has to be young, curious and willing to break out of existing paradigms that have failed to deliver. Only then can ?age no bar? be valid!

 JOURNEYS END

This above all / Khushwant Singh 

Return to the Shivaliks (Part I)

 Take a breather 

I am as eager to get out of Delhi as I am to return 

to it. This August, I was counting the days when I could escape from the capital 

for a breather. I had an excuse one book launch after another and then a huge 

do to get an award conferred on me by Captain Amarinder Singh, chief minister 

of Punjab. He likes to do things in maharaja style; his PRO, D.S. Jaspal, 

goes along with his employer. So there were almost 400 guests crammed in a ballroom 

of Imperial Hotel. They included cabinet ministers, chief ministers, ex-chief 

ministers, editors, the Pakistani politician, Aitzaz Ahsan, Ameena Sayid of Oxford 

University Press, Karachi, my family and a bevy of my lady friends. While Amarinder 

Singh was the paradigm of princely courtesy, I behaved like a buffoon, telling 

dirty jokes. It was time to ponder over matters in solitude. Words of the Psalm 

121 kept ringing in my ears: I lift up my eyes to the hills where does my help 

come from ? 

For me, hills are the Shivaliks. So early next morning, 

I got into Nanak Kohlis fancy Mercedes Benz and set off for Kasauli. (I have 

also become an incorrigible name-dropper). National Highway No. 1 is in a shambles: 

chronically under repair, heavy slow-moving traffic of trucks, buses, tractors, 

three-wheelers, buffalo-carts. Getting through one mile of Panipat city took over 

40 minutes. My bladder was bursting with no secluded place to pee. We arrived 

at our half-way eatery, Sagar, in Karnal. I was in low spirits. A Bengali engineers 

family recognized me who could it be but Bengalis! Who could spot a non-descript 

pen-pusher? They came over to shake hands and take snap-shots. My spirits lifted. 

I am a sucker for flattery.

We proceeded on our way to the hills. It was cloudy. 

It began to drizzle. The drizzle turned to rain, and then into a downpour. By 

the time we began our ascent, the change in weather resumed its cycle of a few 

seconds sunshine, followed by drizzle, rain, downpour. My bladder was again 

near to bursting and spirits ebbed to the lowest. Then mist turned into a fog. 

My summer abode, Raj Villa, was blanketed out and the rain came down in buckets-full. 

And there was no sign of Billoo, my jet-black, hairy mongrel, who usually greets 

me leaping to my waist, whining, barking, pawing me with doggy enthusiasm. He 

had tucked himself away in the staff quarters. A very inauspicious beginning to 

a much-looked forward to holiday. It was 3 pm. We had been on the road for seven 

hours. There was a time in my younger days when I did the same journey in four-and-a-half 

hours. I was full of self-loathing and self-pity.

The slugs of Patiala calmed my frayed nerves. I retired 

early, slept as I have never slept before: nine hours at a stretch. Though the 

next day was wet, cold and misty, I was in a better frame of mind. In the evening, 

General Sinha, Governor of Jammu and Kashmir and his wife dropped in to say a 

very brief hello. With them was Brigadier Arjun Menon and his wife, Sathi. I was 

back to name-dropping.

The next morning the prophecy of the Psalm came true 

 My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. The clouds lifted, 

the sky an azure blue, the sun shining. But a cold wind blew; so I sat in my verandah 

wrapped up in shawl. Billoo sensed my presence. He trotted up to make sure it 

was his friend. He leapt up, patted my knees with his forepaws. Then went berserk. 

He ran up and down the verandah at break-neck speed yelping, barking joyfully 

and jumped up on the sofa to nestle in my lap. Lines of the song from the musical 

drama, Oklahoma, came back to my mind: O, what a beautiful mornin/ O, 

what a beautiful day!/ I got a beautiful feelin/ Everythings going my way.

The morning assignment

That morning, I was up at 3.30 am instead of my usual 

4.30-5 am. I had to leave for my summer abode in the Shivaliks. I decided to finish 

the morning assignment. Diya (Mrignaini) Hazra of Penguin Viking has commissioned 

me to compile passages I knew by heart. I promised to put down at least one a 

day in the register Diya had gifted me. I wrote down a couple of lines from Adi 

Shankaracharya:

Kushwam? Kohum? Kutah ayaat? Ko mein Janini? Ko 

mein taate?

Who am I? Where have I come from? 

And why?

Who are my real father and mother?

Would I be able to find answers to these questions 

in the two months I intended to spend in the mountains? Not likely. Thousands 

of savants had spent years in Himalayan caves doing tapasya and meditating 

on these questions and not one came out with any answers. Or perhaps refused to 

tell anyone, thereby indicating that if you want the answers find them yourselves.

However, we set off on our journey well before schedule. 

Gulmohars were out in their flamboyant glory of fiery reds and orange. Amaltas 

could be seen here and there but yet to display themselves in dripping gold. The 

monarch of flowering trees at the end of April was Neelam at intervals along the 

road through Haryana and Punjab, in clusters along the Kalka-Shimla road in Himachal. 

I asked myself: who makes these trees come into flower at set times? Why is their 

glory so short-lived? I do not have a clue.

The first news that my house-keeper, Prem Kumar, gives 

me is sad. S.L. Prashers wife, Prem, had died suddenly. He was the income tax 

commissioner, Himachal Pradesh, and is president of the Save Kasauli Society. 

She had been a badminton champion and was the life and soul of the Kasauli club 

,where she spent a couple of hours every morning. Good-looking, gracious, lively. 

Why did she have to go so early? No answer.

Prem Kumar gives me more news. After many years, a 

leopard is again on the prowl at night. It ate up Billoos mother, who lived next 

door. Then he ate up another dog belonging to a retired army officer who has built 

himself a nice little bungalow below the clubs tennis courts. It badly mauled 

yet another dog, who just managed to escape with its life. Who had sent this marauder 

on its murderous mission to Kasauli? I have no idea. I wonder if Adi Shankaracharya 

could have enlightened me. His claim to having achieved divine status leaves me 

baffled:

Manobudhi, ahankar, chittaani naham

Chidanand roopah, Shivoham, Shivoham

I am not the mind, I am neither intellect nor egoism.

I am the joy of intelligence, I am Shiva, I am Shiva.

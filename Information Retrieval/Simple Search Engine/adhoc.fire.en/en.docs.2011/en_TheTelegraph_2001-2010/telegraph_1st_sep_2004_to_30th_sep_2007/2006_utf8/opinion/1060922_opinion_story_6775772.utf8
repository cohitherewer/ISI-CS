Letters to Editor

In a different garb 

 Making a difference

Sir It is a matter of great concern that a premier 

management institute decided to invite someone like Lalu Prasad to interact with 

students (Lalu-speak wins over B-school, Sep 19) Lalu Prasad has been credited 

with reviving the flagging fortunes of the railways. Hence, the invitation from 

the B school to share the success story. But it is well known that the performance 

of a government undertaking like the railways depends on bureaucrats and its technical 

team. The role of the minister is of very little consequence in this respect. 

Therefore, inviting politicians to management schools to lecture students is of 

no use. Soon, other netas, taking a cue from Lalu Prasad, will start visiting 

educational institutions to tom-tom their achievements. Perhaps, Nitish Kumar 

will be the first to visit the IIMA to counter the claims made by Laluji. It is 

better if these institutes keep their students away from politicians, as it only 

results in a waste of time. 

Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

Sir Under Lalu Prasad, Bihar was known as one of 

the worst governed states in the country. But now, the man has silenced his critics 

by turning around the fortunes of the railways in just two years time. If Mumbais 

dabbawallahs can warrant a study on the part of leading B schools in the 

country, what wrong has the IIMA authorities done by inviting Lalu Prasad to share 

the secret of his success story at the railways? 

Yours faithfully, 

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

Sir The invitation to the railway minister, Lalu 

Prasad, to address students in a management institute proves once again that there 

is no dearth of surprises in a country such as ours. Lalu Prasad, who was credited 

with ruining Bihar almost single-handedly, has now been bestowed the rare honour 

of holding a discourse in a top business school. There is no doubt that the media 

has turned Lalu Prasad into a hero. All this attention has resulted in us forgetting 

the many misdeeds committed by the same man. One wouldnt be surprised if the 

news of accidents, robberies, and rape cases in trains are now given a hurried 

burial. It is equally surprising that a professor in the institute was so impressed 

with Lalu Prasads creative approach that he ended up inviting the minister. 

The episode is nothing but a gimmick and is meant to attract unnecessary attention. 

Yours faithfully, 

Hemanta Kumar Dutta, Howrah

Sir Lalu Prasads in-depth knowledge about the railways 

during his talk with management students came as a surprise. Nonetheless, it was 

a pleasant surprise. Our cabinet ministers, more often than not, know next to 

nothing about the respective departments that they head. But by displaying his 

understanding on matters related to the railways, the minister has not only impressed 

the IIM students, but also earned the respect of the citizens of India. Not only 

that, the students were reported to have enjoyed his lecture immensely. Lalu Prasads 

dream of bettering the standards of the railways and his dedication to his job 

show that he is the best man for the job. It is good to know that Lalu Prasad 

is an intelligent man whose moves may even outsmart some of the top managers in 

the industry. 

Yours faithfully, 

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

Sir It is indeed sad that one of Indias best business 

schools required the services of a politician to impart lessons in management. 

It is quite alright for Lalu Prasad to share his experience of turning a loss-making 

venture into a commercial success. But, at the same time, one cannot forget the 

fact that the same man was responsible for unleashing a nightmare in Bihar. Today, 

Lalu Prasad, desperate for an image makeover, is busy casting his charm over management 

students. But one must remember that this was done in his own interest and to 

strengthen his image as an honest politician. If he is really a politician with 

a difference, he should work for the welfare of Bihar and its people. 

Yours faithfully, 

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi 

Sir The fact that an institute of excellence which 

churns out smart managers by the dozen decided to invite Lalu Prasad to deliver 

a lecture is quite unbelievable. One suspects that the invitation had more to 

do with the mans popularity and his being an elected representative of the people. 

True to his form, Lalu Prasad stole the honours during the show. He also did not 

forget to cast aspersions on his predecessor, Nitish Kumar, and blamed him for 

the ills in the railways. This just goes to show that all that the minister cared 

about was injecting a doze of politics in an educational institution. 

Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

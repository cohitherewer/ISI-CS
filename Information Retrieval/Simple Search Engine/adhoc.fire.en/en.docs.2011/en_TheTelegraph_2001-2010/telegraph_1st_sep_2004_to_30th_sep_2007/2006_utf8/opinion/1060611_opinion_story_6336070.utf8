 DIARY

 If it is football, can the president of All India Football Federation be far behind? Although Priya Ranjan Das Munshi tore himself away from Germany on the day of the kick-off in Munich, he obviously has no plans to miss the live action. The information and broadcasting minister will be back in Germany later this month to watch the key contests himself. And all this for a cause ? to ensure India improves its rating from the current 117th position in the Fifa rankings. There are other indications of Das Munshi?s selflessness. The minister had made special arrangements at Mandi House for the lesser mortals to witness the bonanza of the first day on a giant screen. Far away from all this, however, even lesser mortals had their share of the enjoyment on small-screen TVs under street lamps in the galis. The mania obviously makes no distinctions in class or rank. 

 The good doctor may still manage to force his bitter pill down the left?s throat on the fuel prices issue, but the euphoria is unlikely to last long. There is no doubt that Manmohan Singh suddenly finds himself cornered from all quarters ? there is still the simmering quota controversy and the office-of-profit snub from the president. Add to that what seems to be a ?failing? Kashmir initiative. Despite the announcement of setting up five working groups during his visit to the state, there is no sign of them, and old Kashmiri hands are already wondering why the government is frittering away the goodwill. Apparently, the PM is facing a problem of plenty as far as advises are concerned. No two advisers of the PM seem to be thinking on the same lines. And this trend is not merely confined to the Kashmir issue. There are people working at crosspurposes on almost all matters ranging from trade to the foreign policy. God save the PM!

 In Madhya Pradesh, CMs seem to have a god-given right to keep two government houses. Uma Bharti retained the house she was allotted as MP when she was CM. Next was Babulal Gaur, who got the first house registered as the CM?s ?annexe?. And now it is Shivraj Singh Chauhan?s turn. He has retained the house he was allotted as MP, just in case...

 The Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, thinks no end of his job. Which is why it has reportedly been his pet project for a while to start two 24x7 TV channels relaying the proceedings in both the houses. The idea, unfortunately, has met with stiff opposition from the Rajya Sabha, which has taken a principled stand on the matter despite the fact that Chatterjee is believed to have already gone ahead and created additional infrastructure for the Lok Sabha channel. At a recent meeting of the upper house, the minutes noted the unanimous view of the members against seeking financial sponsorships from PSUs for the channels. The matter has been referred back to Chatterjee, who now will have to cajole MPs apart from disciplining them.

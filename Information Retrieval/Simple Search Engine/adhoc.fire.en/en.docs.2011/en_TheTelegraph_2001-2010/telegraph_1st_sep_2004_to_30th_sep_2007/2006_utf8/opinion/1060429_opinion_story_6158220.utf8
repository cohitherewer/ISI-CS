 WANTED, A SPY

 The end of the Cold War brought the curtain down on a number of things. The world of spying was one of these. The covert world of espionage lost the major plank of its existence with the disappearance of communism. This forced the many institutions connected with espionage also to change their character. One measure of this transformation is the recent advertisement from MI6 in a British daily seeking applications for the job of spies. This was unthinkable even a generation ago. In fact, for a very long time, the British establishment denied the existence of a department called MI6 that was devoted to counter-intelligence in foreign countries. That outfit is now open enough to actually advertise in public. The rise of Islamic terrorism has created a sudden increase in the demand for field intelligence officers. It was assumed that the advances in technology ? satellite pictures, phone tapping, sophisticated methods for cracking codes, interception of emails and so on ? had made the presence of field officers redundant for the collection of intelligence. But events in Afghanistan and in Iraq demonstrated that there is no substitute for human intelligence. Spies were thus back in the job market.

 In the past, as far as it is possible to learn, recruitment to the MI6 was done through an informal network located in England?s two oldest universities. Old Etonians or at least students from the leading public schools were preferred. Readers of John le Carr? will recall that it was George Smiley?s Oxford tutor, Jebedee, who nudged Smiley towards the secret service. Those were the days of clubland spying. This was shaken to its foundations with the defection of Guy Burgess and Donald MacLean and the unmasking of Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt. All four were from the leading public schools and Cambridge. The intensification of the Cold War made the world of espionage more secret and fraught with urgency and danger. It is not clear how spies were recruited since the Seventies. It is reasonable to assume that the old system of talent spotters in the universities still worked, but the catchment area had widened. Whatever may have been the system, it was certainly not through open advertisement. Perhaps candidates joined the secret service through what is called false flag recruitment: they were under the impression that they were being interviewed for some obscure government departments till at various stages, successive veils were taken off to reveal the real employer.

 Now with open recruitment, the mystique surrounding espionage has disappeared. From a calling, spying has become a career. Who knows, the next stage might be a corporatization of MI6 after which its head ? known not by his name but as C, after its first head, Mansfield Cumming ? will be referred to as CEO. Spies will no longer come in from the cold.

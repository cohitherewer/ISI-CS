 FAR FROM THE FULL MEASURE

 Inhibited by political pressures, Chidambaram has not gone

 In need of greater support

 This budget provided a unique opportunity to set new directions to make the economy stronger and grow faster. With gross domestic product growth expected for the next year at 8.1 per cent, following on the 7 per cent or so for three years, huge foreign and domestic investments, a booming stock market, high savings rates and investment, improvement in manufacturing and tremendous interest in India as a market for sourcing and as an investment destination, the euphoria among the educated could have been used to further build the economy. It could have reduced the fiscal deficit by less so as to give the right signals on fiscal management, but substantially increased expenditures on infrastructure, health, education and agriculture, reduced subsidies, adjusted petroleum product prices, charted a vision for disinvestments and raised tax revenues. It makes no mention of or provision for the announced new pay commission and its effects. In fact, it has been a pragmatic budget that makes the right noises but does not take actions that might confront its communist supporters.

 It was expected that the budget would stimulate job creation, support the poor, promote investment, improve fiscal consolidation and promote growth. It does plan to spend on the employment guarantee scheme (rural development up by Rs 2,693 crore, about 13 per cent), and employment generating investments like roads (up by about Rs 2,000 crore, almost 20 per cent). Education expenditure is up by Rs 5,958 crore or about 33 per cent, and health, women and child development by Rs 3,791 crore, about 22 per cent. Other big increases in expenditures are on defence (2004-05 total of Rs 90,112 crore to Rs 104,123 in 2006-07); atomic energy (from Rs 3,751 crore to Rs 5,504 crore, up by almost 50 per cent).

 The food and public distribution expenditure has remained under control but at a huge Rs 24,595 crore and on fertilizers (mainly subsidies) at Rs 17,280 crore. There is no mention of any attempt to rationalize these expenditures.

 There is no evidence as to how effective such social expenditures made last year have been. On food and fertilizer subsidies, it is evident that much gets stolen or is leaked to the better-off consumers. The budget does not even talk as the last year?s budget did, of experimenting with alternatives to physical distribution through better targeting and distribution of entitlements.

 It was expected that there would be substantial increases in expenditures on agriculture and physical infrastructure. Agriculture has seen declining public investments for over two decades, believed to be the major cause for its poor contribution to GDP. This budget proposes expenditures of Rs 5,178 crore, up by about 20 per cent, apparently a big increase, but yet grossly inadequate to undo the damages of past neglect. A regressive feature is the directive to nationalized banks to lend to agriculture at 7 per cent interest. It repeats the cross-subsidy concept, and is government interference in the operations of public sector banks. It would have been better for the government to provide such interest relief from its own revenues.

 Other elements in infrastructure see little increase in expenditures, though power goes up from Rs 3,233 crore to Rs 3,769 crore. One would have expected strong incentives to state governments to privatize power distribution and allow open access to transmission and distribution wires for all users.

 Companies had expected a tax on long-term capital gains but that the fringe benefit tax would be made more user-friendly, that no cesses would be added but new services added for tax, and that the loss of revenue because of the FBT modifications would be made up by an increase in minimum alternative tax or even income tax. Most negatives have occurred but not the positives. The changes to FBT are marginal and will see many protests from industry. However, the MAT has gone up from 7.5 to 10 per cent, long-term capital gains from securities are now to be added to incomes, many new services have been added for service tax and the rate is upped from 10 to 12 per cent. The cash withdrawal tax remains. The rates of securities transactions tax that Bombay brokers protested against last year are now to be substantially increased.

 The proposed extension of VAT is welcome as is the intention to move to a uniform goods and services tax by 2010. The abolition of Central sales tax seems to have been postponed. Tax revenues to GDP are to rise from 10.5 to 11.2 per cent on a larger GDP, adding over Rs 72,000 crore to tax revenues and providing cushions for substantial expenditure increases in areas like agriculture.

 Fiscal prudence is seen in the reduction of the fiscal deficit from 4.1 per cent last year to 3.8 in 2006-07 and the revenue deficit from 2.6 to 2.1 per cent. The anxiety about inflation shown by the Reserve Bank of India?s raising of interest rates is reflected in this effort to reduce the deficit. Yet, there was an opportunity to use the euphoria about the economy to raise expenditures and tax revenues.

 Non-tax revenues contributed Rs 2,000 crore less than last year because of decline in interest receipts and disinvestment not being included. The finance minister seems disinclined for any more battles with the left on this. But he could have sold shares to the public in some of the better public enterprises while retaining government control, adding substantially to non-tax revenues.

 The budget has little focus on energy. One hopes that the ignoring of the Rangarajan committee recommendations on petroleum products prices was a political ploy to avoid communist flak and that they will be implemented. The entry of private users into coal mining is welcome but again will depend on the cooperation of the left.

 Excise and customs duty changes will probably help only a few industries: automobiles, textiles including man-made fibres, food processing and gems and jewellery, some of which have high employment generation potential. The timidity of the budget is also reflected in the lack of effort to prune reservations for small-scale industries, a cause of inefficiency and non-competitiveness.

 This budget has all the signs of a finance minister whose natural boldness has been inhibited by parties supporting his government. Could he have done more despite this? Perhaps disinvestment was not feasible. But substitution of physical distribution of subsidized goods by entitlements could have begun.

 Agriculture could have received greater support in terms of storage, dams, canals, water conservation and so on. A beginning could have been made to separate minimum support prices from procurement prices. A more rational irrigation water pricing policy could have been attempted. The finance ministry?s own undertakings (like nationalized banks) could have been given greater autonomy and a minimum of five years? tenure to top management. Power could have been stimulated through incentives to state governments to do things like cutting cross-subsidies, targeting subsidies carefully, privatizing distribution, and so on. The gap between crude prices and retail prices of petroleum products could have been reduced along with other Rangarajan committee recommendations.

 The budget could have shown awareness about the inefficient and leaky delivery of physical and social services by the administrative apparatus. It could have proposed incentives for performance and moved towards decentralized administration and provided funds for developing capability in panchayats and local bodies. It has not been sufficiently ambitious in going after fresh tax revenues. It needed to find ways to stimulate foreign investment.

 This is not a budget in the Chidambaram mould. It is strongly influenced by the caution of his political masters.

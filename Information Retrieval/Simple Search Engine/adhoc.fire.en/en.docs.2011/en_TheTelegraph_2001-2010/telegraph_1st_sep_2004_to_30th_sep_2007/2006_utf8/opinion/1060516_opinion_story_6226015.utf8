 Letters to Editor

 Say it with a prayer

Sir ? On the one hand, there is religious freedom, 

on the other, modernity; the demand for freedom of expression on one hand, and 

the right to have faith in superstitions on the other hand. It is every man?s 

right in this country to practice any religion he pleases to. The question is, 

does this right come with an implicit responsibility to act rationally? Should 

this right be exercised by a public display of one?s blind faith in half-baked 

rituals? Celebrities in all countries have to shoulder a bit of responsibility, 

whether they like it or not. That is simply because their actions, words, gestures, 

fashion, principles, and so on do influence their admirers. The responsibility 

is much more when one is not merely a celebrity but a national hero. 

Sachin Tendulkar has a constitutional right to believe in anything he pleases ? horses with wings, UFOs, Santa Claus, mermaids and even pink elephants. One also cannot deny him his right to perform any ritual that he fancies as long as that doesn?t involve beheading children or killing black bucks. And it is quite possible that someone among his ancestors had killed a snake. If the Grand Panjandrum or the purohit of Kukke Subramanya proclaims that this is the cause of Tendulkar?s sore elbows, then who are we to harangue anyway? We are a nation that still feeds the occasional milk to Ganesh, unfalteringly bear the brunt of television evangelists. Our neo-modern celebrities romp in and out of page 3 parties and indulge in televised astrological banter with equal ease. We still spend the first 28 years of our lives arranging our children?s marriage and the rest of what is left, being crabby about it. So there should be little surprise expressed when the icon of the nation decides to publicly deal with the curse of a cobra. His example will, however, remain etched in the mind of every child who picks up the cricket bat. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sanjay Banerjee, Hooghly 

 Sir ? Sachin and Anjali Tendulkar had gone on a very personal mission to the temple in Mangalore. The Telegraph should not have printed the picture on the first page of the May 9 publication. However, the caption accompanying the picture indicated the deep-rooted superstition in the minds of the couple. Does Tendulkar really think his recent failures with the bat have to do with the curse of a snake? 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Tendulkars go for medical treatment to the best hospitals abroad. Anjali Tendulkar herself once belonged to the medical profession. And yet, for Sachin Tendulkar?s persistent problem with his elbow, they believe in the mumbo-jumbo they are fed. Perhaps, in a way they reflect India?s dilemma with modernity. It is this confusion that leads Indians to lay more stress on their horoscope to guarantee them marital bliss than their compatibility. 

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? By paying obeisance at the Kukke Subramanya, Sachin Tendulkar has proved that he abides by Indian family values and traditions. Although a personal matter of faith, the ritual performed by the Tendulkars has proved that the saffronites have nothing to worry about the future of modern and globalized India.

 Yours faithfully,

C. Mohanty, Bhubaneswar

 What lies beneath

 Sir ? There is some truth in what Sanjib Baruah argues in ?All that is in the name? (May 10). That is, a socio-political-cum-economic issue has been conveniently transformed into a security-related one by our leaders so far as the North-east is concerned. New Delhi?s obsession with Kashmir, coupled with the utter neglect of the North-east has alienated the eight states ? including Sikkim ? from the rest of the country. Perhaps a few pragmatic steps taken can prevent our losing the North-east altogether. One, removal of the army from the region, as also the Armed Forces Special Powers Act. Two, replacement of the lame duck North Eastern Council by an independent ministry for the region under a cabinet rank minister that will function from a central location like Guwahati and will be accountable to Parliament. Three, formulation of a separate article similar to Article 370 to assure a degree of autonomy to the region. Four, the creation of a special economic zone, and to include West Bengal in this group to enable the SEZ to make use of Calcutta?s sea and air ports. Five, construction of an effective border with Bangladesh to stop infiltration. Six, to organize people-to-people contacts between states to focus on history, culture, sports and games, student exchange programmes and so on. Seven, institution of a North-east quota for top level government appointments. The media has a vital role to play in integrating the region. New Delhi must remember that its much-vaunted ?Look East? policy as part of its globalization drive will come to naught unless North-east?s stability in all respects is assured.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? The North-east problem would have been easier to resolve had it functioned as a homogeneous unit. But the divisions among the seven states, and within the states, tribes and communities are so complex that a solution to the region?s social and economic problems seems almost impossible to achieve. Sanjib Baruah may complain about the Centre?s obsession with ?security? in the region, but the porous borders, the insurgents? movements and now the infiltration of Maoists into the region show that the concern cannot be dismissed.

 Yours faithfully.

B. Pal, Calcutta

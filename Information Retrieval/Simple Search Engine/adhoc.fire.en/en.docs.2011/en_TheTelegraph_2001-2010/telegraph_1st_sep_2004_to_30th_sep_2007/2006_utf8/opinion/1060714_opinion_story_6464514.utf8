 FACES IN THE RAIN

 Call of the sea

 The Girl By Sonia Faleiro, Viking, Rs 250

 Sonia Faleiro?s debut novel is simply entitled The Girl. And if anything can be singled out as the defining characteristic of this slim novel, it is its simplicity. The work is refreshingly uncluttered by any preoccupation with wider socio-political issues that has come to characterize most Indian writing in English in recent times. Instead, here there is an unabashed focus on intense emotional states of love, yearning and loneliness.

 The novel is set in a hamlet in Goa, called Azul or the Village of the Dead by the locals because the inhabitants are ?perpetually in grief for losses real and imagined?. The plot opens with the funeral of the Girl and the gray, brooding mood sets the tone for the following chapters till the end. There is none in Azul who has not suffered an untimely loss, and the languid gloom of the place is complemented by the ever-leaking skies, the insane gales and the putrefying smells of the earth. Although the Girl comes to live in this village as an outsider, she is also one with the villagers by virtue of the series of losses endured by her. Touched by death, she can no longer find a place in the world of the living. Briefly resurrected by love and sinking in the depths again when deserted by her lover, she finds her home at last in the bosom of the sea. The Girl is transfigured in death, ?her hair entwined with coral, her heart unravelled by a school of fish?? as she sleeps in her watery grave. 

 What saves the novel from becoming a clich? is the collage of haunting images in which the internal and physical landscape merge. Although melancholy permeates every page of this book, there is no sentimental wallowing in it. The sky ?groan[s] with horror?, the wind ?shriek[s]? on the day of the Girl?s funeral, but being narrated by her lover, Luke, all the sound and fury can well be accepted as pathetic fallacy. In her memoir, the Girl views her own death with an objectivity that does not preclude irony and a secret pleasure at being able to take her turn in deserting Luke. For her, death is not the end, but the beginning. And indeed, it proves to be the beginning of a new life for Luke, who is forced to give up his wanderings and live in the dilapidated house he once inhabited with the Girl and bequeathed to him in death. This is the Girl?s ?silly jest? on Luke. He had tried to escape the burden of responsibility by leaving her, and now he must live out her legacy in Azul.

 The peculiar blending of the uncanny and the real in the descriptions of the novel is almost magic realist in nature. Azul sucks away the vitality of all those who come to live in it and replaces it with a languorous fatalism. The ?real? world halts at the margins of this village and then withdraws, rebuffed by its intractable ways. Here the morning Herald is flung over the gate, but it ?invariably falls in a pool of rainwater?, the motley display in Simon?s store peels and ferments, stories of loss are ?consumed with the same appetite as the scalding sweet tea?. As a foreigner, Luke is initially befuddled by the ways of life in the village. But the Girl had found sanctuary here and by living in Azul after her death, he slowly discovers the reason behind the villagers? resignation. Left with nothing to lose, they have been ?freed of the terror? of bereavement.The arrival at this wisdom is the Girl?s gift to Luke. He had deserted her twice because he wanted to inhabit the bustling world. Broken by her death, Luke must settle for those scraps of life as he can find in the Village of the Dead.

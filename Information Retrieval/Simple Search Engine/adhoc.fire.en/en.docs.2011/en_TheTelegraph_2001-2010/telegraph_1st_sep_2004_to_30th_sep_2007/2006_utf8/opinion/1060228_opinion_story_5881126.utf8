 Letters to Editor

 Material man

 Sir ? Ashok V. Desai?s article, ?Nationalism and culture? (Feb 21), should have been titled, ?Nationality and culture?. The Mittal-Arcelor affair is more about nationality than nationalism ? it is about an Indian getting, or not getting, significant ownership of a leading European company. That is why different interest groups in France have made statements regarding Mittal being non-European and Indian. That is also why the deal appears so unattractive to Europeans.

 French businessmen and politicians have been disparaging of the Mittal offer and have highlighted the cultural differences of the bidder. How can Desai then insist that the Mittal deal should be judged on the basis of its economic and commercial merits? Is not the economics of business linked closely to issues of culture and identity at various levels? Had it not been so, ?culture? and its related issues would not have formed such a strong component of business studies in the leading schools in Europe. Mittal?s bid will thus be decided not merely by its ?attractiveness?. Desai talks about the Chinese not being allowed to do business smoothly in India while contesting Kamal Nath?s argument for ?national treatment?. But how many Indians have been permitted to do business in China or how many non-Europeans are owners of big businesses or commercial companies in France?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Lakshmi Mittal is a corporate giant who happens to hold an Indian passport. Indian ministers are demeaning their country by taking Mittal?s side or commenting on his business deals. It would be interesting to know what their reaction would be if Mittal or some other non-resident Indian makes a similar offer to the shareholders of Bajaj Auto or Godrej. Will they be able to back Mittal in the same way then?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is difficult to agree with the editorial, ?Rich man?s game? (Feb 9). The concern with what Lakshmi Mittal?s shareholders would get if his merger with Arcelor fails is pessimistic and even prejudiced. As for job downsizing, or rather the reallocation of labour force, this is a phenomenon which is common to industries the world over, and is not reason enough to frustrate the bidding process. The French objection to the bid is purely political, and smacks of double standards. The French government does not have a single share in the company and was more than enthusiastic about Arcelor?s own takeover of Dofasco Incorporated. Mittal?s being a lavish spender and an NRI are irrelevant to the issue. Unfortunately, French politicians fail to see the point even while lecturing on the merits of free market.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Lakshmi Mittal, who left India decades ago to make his fortune, suddenly seems to have discovered a new love for his mother country. He now thinks it is the duty of the Indian government to support him in his bid for Arcelor which is going to add to his fame and wealth. All we had heard of Mittal in this country concern the extravagant wedding of his daughter and the outlandishly expensive house he bought for himself in London. No one grudges him these luxuries. But as Indians, we would also like to know if he has done anything for the underprivileged sections of his country. If, in spite of being an American, Bill Gates can announce donations worth several million dollars for various social causes in India, can we not expect some generosity from an Indian who is reputed to be London?s third richest man? 

 Moreover, the fact that he has timed his presence in India to coincide with the visit of the French president, Jacques Chirac, casts doubts on his intentions. It seems all too clear that he wants to lobby with the Indian government against the French by cashing in on his political Indianness. As Indians, we cannot ask the government not to help another Indian, but it should be done with some assurance from Mittal that he would give back something to this country where millions go without one square meal a day.

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? Three European governments ? that of France, Luxembourg and Spain ? have objected to Lakshmi Mittal?s bid for Arcelor to protect the interests of labourers. The matter should be left to be handled by the customary commercial channels and the International Labour Organization. 

 Yours faithfully,

H.P. Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The obsession with Lakshmi Mittal has gone too far. It is preposterous that the commerce minister, Kamal Nath, and even our prime minister should act as his henchmen. Notwithstanding the facts that Mittal is an Indian by birth, his contribution to India has so far been nil. He has come to India to flaunt his wealth. Moreover, he is trying to get richer by creating a monopoly in the steel business, which is desirable neither for India nor the consumers of steel worldwide. Why should then the Indian government further his ambitions? Has it been bought over with promises of lucrative deals?

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

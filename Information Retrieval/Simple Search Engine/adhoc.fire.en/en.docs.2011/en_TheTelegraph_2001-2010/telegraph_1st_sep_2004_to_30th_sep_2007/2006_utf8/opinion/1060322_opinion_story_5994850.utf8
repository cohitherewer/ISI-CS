 ANOTHER MAP

 The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, sprang a surprise in Mumbai last Saturday by putting capital account convertibility back on the agenda. In 1997, a committee headed by the former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Mr S.S. Tarapore, had drawn up a road map which, if followed, would have ushered in full convertibility by 2000. But the Asian crisis intervened and the perception gained ground that the main reason why India and China escaped the brunt of the crisis was because their currencies were not fully convertible. Since then, of course, much has changed for the better. The country?s foreign exchange reserves are much higher, the economy is much stronger, the fiscal deficit is lower, inflation is under control and Indian banks are much stronger. To be sure, much remains to be done, especially in reducing the fiscal deficit. 

 The Tarapore committee had recommended full convertibility when the combined gross fiscal deficit (of both the Centre and the states) fell to 3.5 per cent, when inflation came down to 3.5 per cent and when the current account deficit was around 1.6 per cent of the gross domestic product. Currently, the combined fiscal deficit is around 7.7 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit this year is likely to be much higher than the recommended level. That is why nobody is talking of immediate capital account convertibility ? all that is being drawn up is another road map for the future. It is unclear why a new committee is needed, particularly when the earlier road map was quite comprehensive and when most of the committee members remain the same. Likewise, there exists a contradiction between going in for full convertibility on the one hand and the RBI?s concerns about participatory notes and the low levels of investment allowed to foreign institutional investors in the debt markets on the other. Also, we have progressed a fair bit down the road to capital convertibility already.

 Not only do FIIs, for example, have full freedom to buy and sell Indian equities but Indian companies too can borrow and invest large sums abroad. Scarcely a week passes without the announcement of an overseas takeover by an Indian company. Even Indian residents can now invest up to $25,000 abroad annually. In short, we already have partial capital account convertibility and all that is needed is to remove the remaining restrictions. At the same time, caution is called for, because when global liquidity tightens there may well be an outflow of funds from the country ? an outflow that may be more difficult to manage with full convertibility.

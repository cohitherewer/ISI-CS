 FRIENDS, NOT ALLIES

 An entente with the US does not compromise India?s independent, or non-aligned, foreign policy, argues Chandrashekhar Dasgupta

 The author is former ambassador to China

 Keep the warmth

 Indo-US relations have undergone a total transformation over the past nine months. The moves initiated when the defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, and the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, visited Washington last year were brought to a conclusion during the historic visit of President George W. Bush to India. The centrepiece of the new development is, of course, the deal to enable India to accelerate its nuclear power programme, on condition that its civilian (but not military) nuclear installations are brought under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. This is supplemented by a number of other agreements covering such diverse areas as defence supplies, agriculture and joint research in science and technology. As Bush said in his speech at the Purana Qila, the United States of America and India are now ?closer than ever before?. The US president is living up to his offer to help India become a major power in the 21st century.

 The old adage that one should not look a gift horse in the mouth does not apply in the sphere of politics. In international affairs, one should not only closely examine any offer made by a foreign state but also analyse the reasons for the offer. So why has President Bush taken the initiative to reshape US policy towards India?

 A large part of the answer lies in the president?s perception of India as a democratic and responsible country. For George W. Bush, the fact that India is a democracy is not simply a curiosity lending itself to rhetorical exploitation. Bush has a genuine commitment to democracy and believes deeply that the spread of democracy helps promote international peace. For the American president, democracy is a factor in policy formulation, not merely in speech-making. Bush also appreciates the fact that India is a responsible country with an impeccable non-proliferation record. He maintains that these facts must be taken into account in international non-proliferation policies.

 Some critics have voiced the suspicion that Washington?s new India policy is part of a strategy to ?contain? China. This is a baseless suspicion. US policy towards China is one of ?engagement?, not ?containment?. The US is also fully aware that India will not participate in any initiative directed against China. As Manmohan Singh has categorically stated: ?We are not part ? and are not going to be a part ? of any alliance against China.?

 A much more plausible explanation is that the US now sees a rising India as some sort of a ?balance? or ?hedge? against a rising China, in the sense that it views a future Asia dominated by a single new superpower as being less desirable than one in which there are multiple centres of political and economic influence. In this view, there would be no justification for denying India access to peaceful nuclear technologies that are available to other major countries in the region.

 It is inevitable that both China and India will ? in that order ? take their place as major global powers during the first half of the 21st century. Any policy of ?containment? against either of the two is doomed to fail. India recognizes this fact and shapes its China policy accordingly. Will China also recognize this fact and adjust its stand that India must accede to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and divest itself of its minimum nuclear deterrent? The initial Chinese reaction to the Indo-US deal has been disappointing to all those who see India and China as partners in development. In response to a question about the Indo-US deal, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman reportedly expressed the hope that countries that have not acceded to the NPT should do so. We shall have to wait and see whether this was a fully considered response or whether China will show greater understanding of India?s aspirations at the Nuclear Suppliers Group.

 Atal Bihari Vajpayee once described India and the US as ?natural allies?. This may be excused as an example of poetic licence. Bush was more accurate when he referred to the two countries as ?natural partners?. In an alliance, the less powerful members must, to some extent, sacrifice the ability to follow independent policies. India has always taken the view that an alliance with a superpower is inconsistent with an independent foreign policy, a.k.a. non-alignment. Partners, on the other hand, are free to decide on a case-by-case basis when, to what extent and in what manner they wish to join hands in a coalition. 

 There are many issues on which Indian and US national interests are very similar or even identical. The most important example concerns the threat posed by international terrorism. Even before 9/11, India had striven to draw the attention of the international community to this threat and it is only natural that we are active partners in the global coalition against terror formed by the US. There are many other issues ? ranging from drug trafficking and money laundering to global environmental problems and combating communicable diseases ? in which we share a common interest, together with many other countries. It is obviously necessary for us to join hands in global coalitions to meet these challenges.

 There are also some issues on which India?s interests differ from those of the US. While we fully share America?s dedication to promoting democracy, we take a less muscular approach to the problem. We have made a constructive contribution to strengthening democratic practices in other countries by responding to invitations to send election observers, or advise on polling arrangements, etc. We do not, however, share Washington?s faith in regime change as a prescription for democracy. Thus we rightly distanced ourselves from the US-led war in Iraq. Similarly, we have a more nuanced policy on promoting democracy in Myanmar. We cannot afford to overlook the fact that Myanmar is our neighbour and that our national interests require close cooperation with the government of that country on several matters. Indian and US policies will obviously differ on issues where they have divergent national interests.

 The real question is what position we should take on issues in which our own national interests are not directly involved but in which Washington has a strong interest. Should we base our positions solely on legal or ethical abstractions, or also take into account the US stand? Foreign policy must be formulated on a clear-eyed perception of the national interest. In the context of the new Indo-US entente, we have a major interest in maintaining close ties with Washington. In this new context, we should take US concerns into account in formulating our policies on issues in which we are not directly involved. This is entirely consistent with our traditional policy of non-alignment. Let us recall, for example, our nuanced postures on the suppression of the Hungarian uprising (1956) and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (1979). An independent foreign policy is the untrammelled pursuit of the national interest.

 What we have just concluded with Washington is an entente ? a friendly understanding. It is certainly not an alliance. It does not in the least compromise our independent, or non-aligned, foreign policy. On the contrary, it brings nearer the day when India will once again assume its due place in the comity of nations.

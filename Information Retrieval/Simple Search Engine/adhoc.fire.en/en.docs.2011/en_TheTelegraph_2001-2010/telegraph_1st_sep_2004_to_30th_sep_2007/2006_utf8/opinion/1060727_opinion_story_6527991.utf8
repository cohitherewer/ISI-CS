 NOT WORKING

 The expected has happened. The meeting of the six major members of the World Trade Organization (the United States of America, the European Union, Australia, Japan, Brazil, India) in Geneva failed to break the Doha work programme impasse. This is not surprising since there was no improvement that any of the G-6 (especially the US and EU) offered on earlier positions. A figure in WTO?s World Trade Report is indicative. It states that 21 developed countries spend $250 billion annually on trade-distorting subsidies, compared to $50 billion by all other WTO members. This covers all subsidies, but a major chunk is for agriculture, the main stumbling block in the DWP. While the blame game can go on (the US was more inflexible in Geneva than the EU), the July 31, 2006 deadline for the DWP has been missed and parallel negotiations have also been suspended. The deadline for the DWP (December 2006) is impossible. The multilateral system will survive and earlier negotiating rounds (as the Uruguay Round) also went through similar hiccups. 

 But the moot question is, when will negotiations resume? Mr George W. Bush?s fast-track negotiating authority expires in June 2007, and given US congressional elections in November 2006, renewal of the authority is unlikely before June 2007. One will probably have to wait until the US presidential elections. This means that the resumption of talks before 2009 is unlikely. That also seems an unlikely date because the EU will be reluctant to substantially reform agriculture before 2013. What happens in the interim? Estimates exist about substantial welfare gains through trade liberalization, and on the face of it, these will be lost. However, except for instances where there has been accession to WTO, has WTO been instrumental in pushing trade liberalization? Probably not. 

 Most of the liberalization has occurred unilaterally or through regional agreements, easier to negotiate than agreements involving close to 150 countries. Many such regional agreements are also WTO-plus, in the sense of covering sectors (environment, intellectual property, services) that are outside the purview of WTO-driven liberalization. That global impetus will continue. This will also be true of India, which is attempting to push such agreements with the EU, Japan and South Korea, apart from Brazil and South Africa and other regional agreements that already exist. But more importantly, the G-20 success in negotiations reflects enhanced economic clout, and for India, this is a direct by-product of liberalization. Ipso facto, the interim should be used to push domestic reforms, including those in agriculture, because that will help the country?s negotiating stance in agriculture to shift from a negative to a positive one.

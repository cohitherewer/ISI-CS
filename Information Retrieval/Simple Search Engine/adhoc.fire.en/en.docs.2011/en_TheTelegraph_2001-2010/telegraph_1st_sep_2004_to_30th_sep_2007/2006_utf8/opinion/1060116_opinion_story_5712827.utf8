 Letters to Editor

 Playing with rolls

 Sir ? It is heartening to know that the Election Commission has taken prompt action against the numerous false voters in West Bengal (?Rao gets ?bogus? taste?, Jan 10). All these years, the Trinamool Congress and the Congress have been crying themselves hoarse over the Communist Party of India (Marxist) meddling with the electoral list. At least now, perhaps, the electorate in Bengal can hope to have a free and fair elections, thanks to the EC. However, the fact that the Left Front inducts false voters, rigs polls, and indulges in other malpractices is an open secret, but can the TMC and the Congress escape the same blame entirely? The unchecked infiltration from across the border in Nadia, Malda, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and the North 24 Parganas is responsible for the unprecedented rise in Bengal?s population and the discrepancies in the electoral rolls. Perhaps the EC could highlight this fact as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? What the EC is in the process of unearthing in West Bengal is truly deplorable, but despite all this, I feel that the ruling party may manage to stay put with the help of another rigged election. Thousands of genuine voters have been deprived of their voting rights since their names have been struck off the electoral list and false voters enlisted in their place. Even with all his expertise, K.J. Rao would hardly be able to rectify all the cases of fraudulence before the elections. The chief electoral officer of the state, Debashish Sen, should be suspended immediately since it is impossible that such malpractices would have continued without his knowledge. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir ? One wishes K.J. Rao hadn?t left the work of revising the electoral rolls to district magistrates and block development officers. These are men in cohorts with the ruling party and they have done enough damage to democracy in the state already. If the DM of Nadia and his BDOs have not managed to keep out false voters from the polling booths, what is the guarantee that they can now be trusted to strike off the names of false voters from the voters? lists? Let the EC employ its own officers to undertake the task.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Majhi, Calcutta

 Sir ? The electoral rolls and the ration card system in West Bengal are in a total mess. Corruption and carelessness are the two factors responsible for this state of affairs. Government officers in Bengal seem to enjoy absolute immunity from all charges of corruption or offence, however serious, and are even rewarded with better posting for their assent to electoral malpractices. One can only imagine the corruption in the lower rungs of the administration. It is necessary to reconstruct the electoral rolls. Only this will make democracy functional in Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully, 

A.K. Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Anil Biswas now admits to a terrible mess in the electoral rolls (?Six lakh fake ration cards? Jan 8). The question arises whether he was aware of it earlier and failed to stop the malpractice of issuing fake ration cards and birth certificates. It would not be incorrect to say that his party turned a blind eye to this as long as it suited its interests, even at the cost of great damage to the democratic process. The present mess is unlikely to be set right before this year?s election.

 Yours faithfully, 

A.K. Ganguly, Calcutta

 Sir ? I recently had a harrowing experience at the newly-set up permanent electronic photo identity cards centre attached to the office of the sub-divisional officer in Durgapur. I had misplaced my voter?s identity card (on which my name had been misspelled, and so it was useless actually), and had been encouraged to apply for a replacement by the repeated advertisements issued by the EC in the print media. There was chaos at the said office, with a large crowd standing around impatiently for hours, and the clerical staff, which was short of hands, confused, uninformed about their duties and unsupervised by any officer. The latter made up for all their deficiencies by being both rude and uncooperative. 

 After I had wasted one full day and a half to get things done, I was given a card on which my name had indeed been corrected, but now, for a change, both my age and address had been printed wrongly, and this in spite of the fact that the correct ones had been written clearly in block letters in the appropriate form. What should I do now? I am a self-employed professional and cannot afford to waste days standing in queues. If it is so important for people to have their voters? cards, shouldn?t the authorities concerned ensure that the process is quick and easy for the applicants?

 Yours faithfully,

Suvro Chatterjee, Durgapur

 Book mark

 Sir ? James W. Laine?s description of Shivaji as an ?oedipal rebel? in his latest book shows that he needs to do something about his English language skills (?Author explains Oedipus parallel?, Jan 12). There are any number of sons rebelling against their fathers, and not all of them are oedipal rebels. The phrase can only be used when a son dislikes his father because he considers the latter a rival in his (son?s) desire for sexual gratification through his mother. However absurd Laine?s explanation may be, it is still not sufficient to ban the book.

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

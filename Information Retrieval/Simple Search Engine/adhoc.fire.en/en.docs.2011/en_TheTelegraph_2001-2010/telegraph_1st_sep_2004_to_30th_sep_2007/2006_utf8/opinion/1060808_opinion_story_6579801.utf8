 TOO INTERESTED

 What could be more bizarre than the Union finance ministry advising banks not to follow the monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India? Yet that is precisely what seems to be happening. By shooting off a letter to public sector banks that decisions to hike interest rates should be cleared by the banks boards, the finance ministry has sent a clear signal that it does not want banks to raise lending rates. That is flatly in contradiction to the central banks recent credit policy review, when it raised its policy rate by 0.25 per cent to dampen inflationary expectations. By ensuring that PSU banks do not raise interest rates, the finance ministry is in effect scuttling the RBIs monetary policy.

 Of course, all governments try to influence interest rates, but this is usually done by making clear the governments stand on the issue and occasionally by telephone calls, winks and nudges. The finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, routinely makes noises about how inflation is under control before every credit policy review meeting, and the finance ministrys antipathy towards higher interest rates is well-known. Clearly, however, the government feels that more overt action is needed. It has justified its meddling by stating that, as the largest shareholder in the public sector banks, it is entitled to enforce its wishes. This is rubbish the governments diktat will not protect its interests as a shareholder. As a matter of fact, with rising deposit rates and an inability to increase lending rates, PSU banks will soon feel the pinch and the value of their stocks should decline. Talking of its rights as a shareholder is therefore just a fig leaf and the governments actions are actually dictated by its fear that rising interest rates may slow down economic growth. PSU banks will now bear the burden of the governments policy of keeping interest rates low, just as the oil companies are made to bear the burden of keeping fuel prices low.

 It is possible that the government may well be right in its assessment that there is no need to raise interest rates at the moment. After all, the United States of Americas Federal Reserve may not raise the Fed Funds rate at its next meeting, signalling a pause in the global trend of rising interest rates. But that does not matter what is important is that the RBI is the monetary authority of the country and it must be allowed to do its job. If the government wants to keep interest rates low, all it has to do is curtail its fiscal deficit, which, in the first three months of the year, has already exceeded half of its 2006-07 target.

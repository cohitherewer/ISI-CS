 Letters to Editor

 So long, farewell

 Sir ? With the Bharatiya Janata Party at an all-time political low, the former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, could not have chosen a better moment than the silver jubilee celebrations of the party to announce his retirement from electoral politics. True to his image, stature and style, Vajpayee bid goodbye gracefully. He will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the best prime ministers India has had and his contribution, particularly to the nation?s reformulation of its foreign policy, and his mastery over coalition politics, will always be remembered. Despite having ideological differences with the Congress, Vajpayee always played the role of a constructive opposition leader and supported the former on issues of national importance. His choice of words and behaviour ? both inside and outside parliament ? should serve as an example for today?s politicians. 

 While the reason for Vajpayee?s quitting electoral politics has been attributed to his old age and failing health, it also needs to be noted that a clean politician like him must have felt peeved by the declining standards of politics, indiscipline and corruption in his own party. Though he has compared himself to Parashuram, and referred to L.K. Advani and Pramod Mahajan as Ram and Lakshman respectively, he has, in his own inimitable style, said that like Bhishma of the Mahabharata, he would remain wedded to his party in an advisory capacity. However, given that Rajnath Singh will be expected to make an exhibition of his hardline stance, it remains to be seen how long the National Democratic Alliance will be able to hold together. 

 Yours faithfully, 

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? There has been much noise about L.K. Advani not having gracefully quit his post, as some others have. But Advani has maintained a non-hypocritical stance throughout his career, unlike his more esteemed colleague. Advani has sinned (he has his share of the Ayodhya muddle), but he has been honest even in his wrongdoings, unlike others who have preferred to keep their masks firmly on. After decades of toeing the sangh ideology, Advani took a bold stand on the Jinnah issue and he did not capitulate under pressure. There are others in the party who have come to realize that they have reached a dead end. Advani has no reason to believe so. In fact, if the Jinnah episode is anything to go by, and if Advani really meant to be a fighter like Arjun, there?s hope for the new generation yet.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

 Sir ? I am no follower of the BJP, but would like to say that it is a party positioned to grow. It has several things going for it, the foremost being its leadership. Its current leaders, who are on their way out, rose more out of the circumstances than out of their inherent merit. In fact, the top two were mediocre people and their statements are proof of that. The second rung is made up of leaders who know how to raise funds, have grassroots support, although some of them have gone to the extent of personalizing politics like Uma Bharti. Rajnath Singh was anointed president of the party amid a lot of bad blood, yet he has an unique opportunity before him to steer the party clear of the retirees, the string pullers and the trouble-makers. Hope he rises to the occasion. The Indian democracy sorely needs a credible opposition.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Ghose, Ranchi

 Sir ? In his farewell speech, Atal Bihari Vajpayee needlessly sought to create confusion by naming Pramod Mahajan the Lakshman, instead of Rajnath Singh. Only days after, he was again sent another ?missile? by declaring that Advani would be there to help Rajnath Singh (no matter if he needed it or not). Such statements coming from a responsible leader can continue to cause mistrust in the party which is already in a mess following a series of allegations against corruption in its ranks. There was first the cash-for-question scam and then the Sanjay Joshi sleaze. It is time the party?s mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, took direct control of the political wing of the BJP to make it truly a party with a difference. Such a step will be in the national interest and provide the country with a credible political alternative. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Atal Bihari Vajpayee quitting active politics is not a shocking decision. For quite some time now, even when he was prime minister, this was speculated upon in political circles. His image as the mukhauta of the party will be remembered, particularly his efforts to make A.P.J. Abdul Kalam the president of India and his attempt to improve relations with Pakistan. After Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed was anointed president, successive governments have desisted from making a member of the minority community the head of state. Vajpayee?s break with that trend was a great step forward, considering anti-Muslim sentiments were groomed by his own party. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abdulruff Colachal, New Delhi

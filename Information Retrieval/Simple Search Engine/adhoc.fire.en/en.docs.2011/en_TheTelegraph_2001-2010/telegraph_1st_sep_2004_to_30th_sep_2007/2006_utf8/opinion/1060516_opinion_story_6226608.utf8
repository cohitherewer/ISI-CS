The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BUYING WHEAT

 Fear is often a constructive emotion. But much of it may be set off by unfortunate memories. Many in the country are apprehensive about India seeking to import, for the first time in six years, duty-free wheat from a number of countries ? one of them could well be the United States of America. Five lakh tonnes in February and tenders for another 30 lakhs in April, announced by the Union agriculture minister, have aroused fears of food insecurity. Is India regressing to its dishonourably ?ship to mouth? PL-480 days before the Green Revolution? Will its recent bilateral agreement with President George Bush make it dependent on foodgrain imports from the US at great detriment to local farmers and markets? Such knee-jerk fears should be put in place. In a globalized world, buying foodgrain from other countries is, so to speak, no big deal. Besides, the state of the Indian economy vis-?-vis the rest of the world, and more specifically India?s relationship with the US, forty years ago were very different from what they are now. In both respects, India is far from being an economically and politically helpless seeker of charity, bartering self-sufficiency for food.

 If the wheat crisis is to produce its fears and reflections, then the focus should be more internal. That it is a crisis cannot be denied. Procurement by the Food Corporation of India is well below target and less than last year?s level. If things go this way, the government will come up with about half the requirement of the public distribution system and welfare programmes.How has the government ? its agricultural policies, infrastructure, management and political habits ? failed farmers and consumers? And what can it do to boost the production of wheat, stabilize prices and make farmers feel more secure about the fate of their crops? Curbing the tendency towards strategically populist agricultural subsidies (together with quick-fix solutions like free irrigation water and electricity), planned investments in agriculture, and a clearer pricing policy would go a long way towards raising productivity and allaying farmers? fears and uncertainties. Moreover, ?freeing? the import of wheat should also mean greater transparency regarding the process and moderating the controlling attitude of government enterprises like the State Trading Corporation of India. India must confront the full implications of the liberalization of trade.

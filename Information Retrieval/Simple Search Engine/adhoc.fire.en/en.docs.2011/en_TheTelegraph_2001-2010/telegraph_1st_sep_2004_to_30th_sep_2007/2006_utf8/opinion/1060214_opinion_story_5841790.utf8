The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NUMBERED OUT

 Trust is as important to national statistics as is the ability to count right. The Union health ministry seems to have failed on both counts. It has published a prevalence rate for leprosy that allows it to declare the elimination of the disease from the country. But this figure (1 per 10,000 people) has been questioned by doctors and public health managers who actually work with leprosy patients all over the country. They claim that the figures have been manipulated in order to show the elimination rate stipulated by the World Health Organization. This might look like ineptitude (no less forgivable than tampering with the numbers). The figures were computed from the names appearing at the end of the year in the government registers in the full knowledge that patients? names get deleted from the register after therapy even when they are not cured. But what makes the matter rather more sinister, and therefore culpable, are widespread allegations that field-workers had been instructed to stop active surveillance of new patients and to not register certain categories of patients. It is difficult to ignore the unmistakable stench of corruption here.

 Still a savagely stigmatized disease in India, leprosy is characterized by a low rate of self-reporting and a long period of treatment, both of which might make things easier for dishonest public-health bureaucrats. Although 113 out of 122 countries have eliminated leprosy, intensive efforts are still needed to reach the WHO elimination target not only in India, but also in Brazil, Madagascar, Mozambique and Nepal. The full integration of its treatment into general health services and the removal of stigma are essential to these efforts. In this, the government?s political commitment becomes a crucial factor. The allegations made by health-workers about the ministry?s latest claims have to be looked into seriously, for both conscious manipulation and statistical blundering are serious offences against a section of the population, the violation of whose most basic human rights has been going on, quite literally, for ages.

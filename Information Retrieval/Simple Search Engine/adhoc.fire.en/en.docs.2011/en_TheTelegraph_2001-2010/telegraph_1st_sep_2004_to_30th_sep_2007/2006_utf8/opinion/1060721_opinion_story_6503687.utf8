The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE BIGGER B

 What better way to liven up the dullness of a degree ceremony than a bit of Bollywood? The current vogue for it in Britain must have a great deal to do with cultural boredom. But it must be political too ? Britain?s way of making a colourful virtue of a rather bewildering necessity. The first thing about Amitabh Bachchan?s honorary Doctor of Arts from somewhere in Leicester is not to take it too seriously. The automatic gravitas of Bachchan?s current commercial manner must have perfectly suited his doctoral robes, and he has certainly given the university its money?s worth in terms of spectacle. Leicester has a large Asian population, the chancellor of the university is a British Asian baroness, and for the city?s Labour MP, Mr Keith Vaz, the whole show must have made excellent political sense. Bachchan is the perfect icon for New Labour?s tikka-masala aspirations.

 But there is a serious side to the whole thing. And this has to do with the status of universities, and whether their commitment to academic excellence is compromised by the indiscriminate awarding of honorary degrees to local and global celebrities. British universities seem particularly anxious not to be seen as ivory towers, and often use such awards to bond with local communities. The managers of Arsenal and Manchester United have both received several degrees from their ?local? universities, as have several footballers, referees, pop-singers, TV stars and even anchors. Bob Dylan has got two from St Andrew?s and Princeton, the Bee Gees from the University of Manchester. And David Attenborough is believed to have got about nineteen. Bachchan got his for being, according to the university?s narrator, ?quite simply India?s greatest film actor?. Such an idea of greatness becomes the same as what this official goes on to describe as ?intellectual, professional and cultural distinction?. Perhaps ?culture? is the operative word here ? the postmodern ragbag into which just about anything might be thrown to be made fit for studying at university. Within this trendy, ?anything-goes? ethos of Cultural Studies, ?cultural distinction? begins to sound like a self-contradictory phrase, and the word, ?intellectual?, almost offensively out of place. Whether modern universities would want to redefine excellence in such a levelling way should be a subject for serious reflection.

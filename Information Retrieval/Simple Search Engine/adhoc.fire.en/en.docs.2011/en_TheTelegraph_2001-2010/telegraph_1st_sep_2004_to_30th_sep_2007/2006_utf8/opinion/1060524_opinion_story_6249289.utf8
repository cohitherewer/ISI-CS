 Letters to Editor

 The plot thickens

 Sir ? It is a great tragedy and a cause for shame that even after 59 years of independence, we still have not managed to solve the mystery surrounding Subhas Chandra Bose?s disappearance and supposed death (?Netaji no more, mystery lives on?, May 18). Two non-Congress governments did not have the courage and integrity to do justice to this hero of India?s freedom struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru?s dubious role in covering up the truth regarding Bose?s end was kept up with great conviction, invention, and fortitude by the torchbearers of his dynasty and certainly by the sycophants in the Congress. Independent investigations have revealed that Bose had landed safely in Formosa from Manchuria and from there, he had proceeded to Russia. The mystery pertains to his subsequent predicament. The answers lay with the erstwhile Soviet government and a few members of the Indian government privy to the best-kept political and diplomatic secrets. 

 One wonders what it is that the Indian government is afraid of. It should also be noted that the media too have shown a singular disinclination to probe the issue further. India?s corrupt political establishment will continue to murder truth and history for their own petty gains.

 Yours faithfully,

Amullya C. Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? With the Centre rejecting the findings of the M.K. Mukherjee Commission without citing any valid reason, the political play in the matter has become quite apparent. Earlier, the Shahnawaz Khan Committee of 1956 and G.D. Khosla Committee (1970-74), formed during the tenures of Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi respectively, had tailored their reports to suit the governments that had appointed them. The Mukherjee Commission was instituted by the National Democratic Alliance regime and it has been shoved aside by the present United Progressive Alliance government. It is easy to see that the commission?s rejection of the earlier reports and its new findings did not find favour with the group now in power. The involvement of the Congress in burying the issue each time implies that the party is afraid of raking up old controversies. The country remains indebted to Subhas Chandra Bose for his ideology and his role in the freedom movement. However, with all three inquiry committees ultimately failing to enlighten us on the mystery of his death, it is time to put the matter to rest and move on. There should not be any further politicization of the issue, especially at the expense of the taxpayer.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? The red brigade at the Centre often barks about injustices and harps on value-based politics. And the left parties never fight shy of striking their trademark holier-than-thou pose. However, they also prove the truism that barking dogs seldom bite. This character trait of the left alone can explain the studied silence over the Centre?s rejection of the M.K. Mukherjee Commission?s report. The shameless and inexplicable manner in which the report has been shoved under the carpet calls for not a bark but a roar. It seems that the enduring taste of power in a few states has mellowed the fire of red and turned it grey.

 Yours faithfully,

M.S. Bhattacharya, Sheoraphuli, Hooghly

 Sir ? If Subhas Chandra Bose were alive (never mind his probable age), and actually witnessing the ongoing circus over him, he would certainly have been very disappointed over not only the hullabaloo over his disappearance, but also the misuse of his legacy by his countrymen. One wonders what difference it would make today whether Bose died in the plane crash or not. Except for satiating the Forward Bloc?s ego, the truth would help no one. 

 A lot of public money has been wasted in funding three commissions to probe the mystery. Unfortunately, the M.K. Mukherjee Commission has no answer to how Bose really died. It seems that the trips to Japan, China and elsewhere by the various commissions and all the expenditure incurred in this futile exercise were all part of a ploy hatched by the erstwhile NDA government to win over Bengalis. The only way out of this mire is to perform DNA tests on the Renkoji Temple ashes to see if there is a match with Bose?s daughter, Anita Bose, or with other living relatives. Expectedly, the Mukherjee Commission has not received any cooperation on this front.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? As an Indian, it is disappointing to note the lukewarm response of my countrymen to the findings of the M.K. Mukherjee Commission?s report. The commission has inferred that Bose did not die in the air crash in 1945, although both the Shahnawaz Khan Committee and the Khosla Committee had concluded that Bose was killed in the crash. The Mukherjee Commission has refuted these long-standing conclusions to the extent of declaring that even the ashes kept at the Renkoji temple are not Bose?s. 

 This is the kind of investigation that changes history and rejuvenates public memory and debate. Thus it is unfortunate that such a sensational revelation pertaining to an important mystery of the last century has failed to create any impact on Indian society in general. It is obvious that the intellectual degeneration of the Indian public makes it see no idols beyond cricketers and movie stars. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deepraj Mukherjee, Memphis, US

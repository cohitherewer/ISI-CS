 MOLES AND MINDSETS

 TWENTY-TWENTY -BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Inside stories

 After Jaswant Singh?s revelation that there was an American mole in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government, one?s respect for Rao?s government goes up. The Americans actually felt the need to penetrate his government. Whatever the United States of America wants today, it can ask for directly and hope to get the information.

 Consider the following note. A government official recorded it on February 2 this year when a US embassy official telephoned him requesting the copy of a cabinet document (names and subject of the document withheld):

 ?A short while ago (at around 11 am) Mr ABC of the US embassy...contacted the undersigned over telephone (number withheld). After exchanging pleasantries, he mentioned that he had learnt that the Government of India had introduced or proposed to introduce a Bill on XYZ. Mr ABC wanted to have a copy of the Bill. I told him that only a draft was under consideration...whereupon he wanted to know the salient features or provisions of the draft...?

 ?I mentioned that I was not free to discuss the draft and that if the Cabinet approved the draft it would be introduced in Parliament and thereafter it would be in the public domain.?

 On the same day, his superior referred the matter to his minister noting: ?This is not the first time that the US Embassy has tried prying or interfering in decisions in the ministry. Earlier, embassy officials had written to my predecessor about XYZ issues. For information and appropriate instructions, if any.?

 The minister, an old fashioned nationalist, wrote on the file: ?Using the American idiom, just ask him to get lost. No need to respond any further.?

 The minister need not have bothered to take a tough stand. The officials of the ministry gathered in subsequent discussions that the US embassy official had got the information he wanted.

 Consider some more recent cases. A senior government official recently went for negotiations on intellectual property rights. He unilaterally changed India?s stand to suit that of the US, which only recognizes intellectual property rights of individuals. India?s position, however, had been that ?community interests? must be protected while negotiating such rights. He is apparently a contender for one of the top jobs in the World Intellectual Property Organization. When the nodal ministry objected to what the official had done, the issue was placed within the purview of a different ministry with no reprimand to the erring official.

 Another senior official in the industries ministry tried to change the Indian position on patents and traditional knowledge which was in consonance with a group of countries known as ?Friends of Development?, coordinated by Brazil. Some juniors stopped this senior official, fond of sitting across the table with visiting US desk officers, from altering India?s stand. They suggested that he consult the foreign office as such a policy change may have fallouts in other areas of engagement with Brazil and the other members of the group.

 Officials in the commerce ministry complain that in their tele-conferencing with the US trade representative?s office, they are talked down to. ?The number of bilateral visits by US delegations to various ministries has gone up and they do not think twice before telling us what to do,? a senior official commented wryly.

 Consider also what a senior foreign service officer did during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee regime. A full one-month after the cabinet committee on security had decided against sending troops to Iraq to ?stabilize? the situation after the US had pulverized that country, this officer sent a critique of the government?s decision through open channels.

 He accused the government of a poor understanding of the situation in Iraq and of being dishonest with the Americans. He alleged that the government was ?dissembling?, ?pussyfooting?, and that it suffered from a ?lack of understanding of realpolitik.?

 Perhaps his criticism of the government was genuinely felt. However, as the ?open? message was sent too late in the day to have any impact on decision-making, his detractors alleged that it was probably directed at garnering American support for a top job in an international agency.

 The fact is that there are people either making or influencing policy today, who argue for US interests even when they may not be congruent with India?s. This has been evident both within the government and in the media on the issue of Iraq, Iran and, of late, the Indo-US nuclear deal.

 When there are influential advocates for American interests in India ? both within and outside the government, why does the US still need to conduct extensive espionage against India? For one, its friends in the government and the media may not have all the information it seeks. For another, the leaking Indian system may not be completely porous.

 India is a rising power. The US has special interest in India because it is one of the few countries in the world that has indigenous capabilities in the field of nuclear, missile and some other sensitive technologies.

 It also has a great deal of interest in the Indian economy. In the past, the US was interested in agricultural production, projected shortages and the possibility of wheat imports from the international market. Now its interest is in the opening up of Indian agriculture to US-led corporate interests, biotechnology research and liberalization of the financial sector.

 The US also spies on India because the India-Pakistan tensions make south Asia a potential conflict zone. Keeping track of acquisition of arms from various sources, for example, helps in making an assessment of the Indian defence capability.

 Its concern with nuclear proliferation has prompted the US to spy on India?s nuclear plans. When Narasimha Rao was preparing to conduct nuclear tests, the then US ambassador, Frank Wisner, confronted him with satellite maps to show that ground preparations were on for testing. He cautioned him of the consequences of a nuclear test.

 However, the US ignorance of the Indian nuclear tests of May 1998 showed that satellite pictures are not enough. It is obvious that they would now emphasize human intelligence.

 Whether such espionage activities are legitimate or not is not the issue. Espionage is a reality and all countries engage in it. It is tolerated so long as it does not seek to damage a country?s interest.

 India and the US have agreements of cooperation between intelligence agencies with operatives on open assignment in each other?s country. Over and above this, there ought not to be any pressing need to penetrate and seek state secrets. Yet such attempts by the US embassy in Delhi continue. The spiriting away of their deep penetration agent, Rabinder Singh, of the Research and Analysis Wing to Nepal and then to the US and the stealing of secret data from the National Security Council by the US diplomat, Rosanna Minchew, are but only two such recent examples.

 While the US may have an interest in keeping an eye on India, any self-respecting state would protect itself against penetration by a foreign power. Instead of coming across as a supine and scared state, India needs to make it clear to the US that this kind of intrusion is not acceptable from a friendly country. This can be done while continuing to improve ties with Washington. The two are not contradictory goals.

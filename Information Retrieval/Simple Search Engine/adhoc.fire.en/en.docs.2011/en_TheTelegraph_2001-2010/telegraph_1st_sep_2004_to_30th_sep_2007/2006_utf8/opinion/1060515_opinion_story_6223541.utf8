 TEA IN PEACE

 Change and continuity can go hand in hand in politics. The people?s voting preferences are often determined by their desire for both stability and change. In Assam, the voters have once again chosen the Congress to rule the state, but with a significant difference. Unlike in his previous term, Mr Tarun Gogoi will have to run a coalition government. It is unlikely that this mandate has come as a surprise to him. The fact that the Congress had a pre-poll alliance with the Bodo People?s Progressive Front suggests that Mr Gogoi had an inkling of the possibility of a reduced mandate for the Congress. A coalition government should be both a challenge and an opportunity for Mr Gogoi. The BPPF was formed by former militants belonging to the Bodo Liberation Tigers. Mr Gogoi had done well to bring the outfit into the political mainstream. The fact that some of the BPPF legislators would be in his new cabinet should help him tackle the challenge from the largest group of Bodo insurgents, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland. Also, the Congress?s first coalition experiment in Assam could provide an opportunity to the party to bring other ethnic groups closer to it. 

 However, he can expect problems too. The Congress and the BPPF together have a tally of 65 in a 126-member assembly. Mr Gogoi can also count on the support of the lone member of the Nationalist Congress Party and, more important, of some of the Independent legislators. He will face conflicting demands from those supporting his government and many of these demands may have nothing to do with the issues of governance. How he tackles such demands without alienating the supporting parties may decide the success or failure of his second stint in office. For two challenges of his earlier term have not been fully met. First, he will have to pick up the talks with the United Liberation Front of Asom from where he had left them. And he has to renew the peace efforts with the NDFB. On both these fronts, he had some successes during his earlier term. But that should not lull his new government into complacence. His second challenge is the state?s economic regeneration. His last term had left much to be desired on this front, especially on the revival of the tea industry. The two tasks are linked in a crucial way. Assam?s progress depends primarily on peace with the two militant outfits.

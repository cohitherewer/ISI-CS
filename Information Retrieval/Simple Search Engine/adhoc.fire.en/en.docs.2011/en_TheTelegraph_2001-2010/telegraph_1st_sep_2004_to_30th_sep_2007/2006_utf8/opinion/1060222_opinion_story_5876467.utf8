 ON THE FAST TRACK

 R.C. Acharya

 Recently, the United Progressive Alliance government had stated that dedicated freight corridors for railways will be introduced with huge dollops of private investment. However, the proposed DFCs are not exactly a new concept. Quite a few of these have been in existence, some of them built almost a century ago for carrying iron ore from mines located inside the forests to steel plants. Most of these corridors have been laid with rails larger than the average mainline size tracks, enabling them to carry about 23 tonnes axle loads as against the normal 20 tonnes permitted on the main trunk routes.

 One of the earliest examples of such a line, built a century ago by the erstwhile Bengal Nagpur Railway, carried iron ore from Badampahar to Tatanagar when India?s first ever steel plant was set up at Jamshedpur. Over the years, a number of such short spurs were built especially when new steel plants came up at Bhilai, Rourkela, and Bokaro. Now an entirely new line from Banspani to Daitari enables the vast mineral wealth locked up in the hinterland to be directly brought into the ships waiting at Paradeep, reducing the distance to almost one-third.

 Long-term demands for iron ore by Japanese steel plants prompted the Indian railways to set up another 445 km long line from the mines around Kiriburu to transport the metal into Vizag port. However, it is no match for the big daddy of them all ? the Mt. Newman railways on the Australian north-west coast, which routinely runs 18000 tonne trains hauled by multiple diesel locomotives using dynamic braking for its descent from Newman to Port Hedland which runs downhill for all but 30 km of its entire length. 

 Future needs

 In the early Sixties, when this line was built, much of the technology was acquired from the United States of America. But with experience and local research, Australian engineers in the Eighties upgraded much of the heavy haul rail technology which has now established them as world leaders in the state-of-the-art heavy railway engineering. The single line alignment has one 64-km and 11 three-km long passing loops which enable trains from opposite directions to pass each other without having to stop, thereby saving on laying a double line, a concept being strongly advocated for the proposed DFCs. Significantly, the first Heavy Haul Railways Conference, held in Perth in 1978, attracted worldwide interest and confirmed the pre-eminence of Australian engineers. 

 Faced with dwindling market shares and the slow pace of its freight-carrying trains on the trunk routes crowded with passenger trains, the Indian railways has now opted for the DFCs with a view to improve the infrastructure in order to meet transportation needs of the future.

 The rail India technical and economic services has proposed two corridors, one extending from the coal fields of eastern India to power plants in the north and western parts of the country, and the other to move the burgeoning container traffic from production centres in the north to ports on the west coast. Running double stack container trains hauled by diesel locomotives would be the norm for this corridor, yielding substantial economies of scale. The lessons drawn from the highly successful systems operating in the US for both the coal and container traffic may be useful for the new DFCs.

 To a very large extent, the choice of the consultants for getting the project off the ground would determine the technologies which will be adopted, including a host of new designs of track, signalling, wagons, locomotives and so on, all with a view to provide a quantum leap in productivity. For the millions of crores to be sunk into the project, viability and payback as well as the involvement of major players such as ports and the coal industry would be indispensable.

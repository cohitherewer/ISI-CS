The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 KALI AND THE LAW

 All visitors to the Kalighat temple will be relieved by the verdict of the Calcutta high court that removes the pandas from having anything to do with the temple and its rituals. The pandas had become a menace, and their presence and influence encouraged a whole range of nefarious activities that the high court judgment has taken steps to eradicate. Very few devotees of the goddess Kali will deny that her abode in Kalighat needed to be cleaned, literally and spiritually. The Calcutta high court has performed, in its own eyes and in the eyes of all visitors to Kalighat, a public service. But this cannot deflect attention from certain profound concerns relating to the nature and the scope of the judiciary.

 Hinduism is not a religion of the book. The character of Hinduism is determined by its practice. Thus rituals are inseparable from worship in Hinduism. These rituals are based on the belief that an individual devotee, unless he is a Brahmin, cannot reach god directly. He needs an agent, a purohit, who guides an individuals prayer to god. A temple without a purohit is inconceivable. Pandas, forgetting for the sake of an intellectual argument, their innumerable malpractices in Kalighat and elsewhere, act as middlemen between god and devotees, directing the latter to the proper place and the proper person. The pandas, not surprisingly, are drawn from the highest caste. The high court has now interceded, with the best possible intentions, to do away with this particular agency. In other words, the court has intervened directly in an existing religious practice. It has also decreed that the traditional blood sacrifice cannot be carried out in public within the temple premises. A vital component of the rituals associated with the worship of Kali has thus been removed from the Kalighat temple. The question can well be asked if the matter of an agent existing between worshipper and god can be decided by a court. Does the subject of religious ritual fall within the ambit of the judiciary? These are matters of theology and belief and of religious practices. How can they stand or fall according to the diktats of the judiciary?

 These questions should not be confused with the coercion and the corruption practised by the pandas. When the pandas break the law of the land, they need to be dealt with appropriately by the police. This is separate from the theological questions and those relating to ritual, which pertain to the functions the pandas perform. In a laudable attempt to rid the Kalighat temple of filth and malpractices, the Calcutta high court may have grasped a jurisprudential nettle.

 India is a self-proclaimed secular state. This, when translated into practice, means that the state will remain indifferent to religious beliefs and practices. It cannot say, for example, that a Catholic priest, as an agent of god, cannot take confession. Or that the burning of incense will not be allowed during Mass because the smoke is injurious to health or wine will not be permitted during Holy Communion. Yet the high court has forbidden agents in Kalighat and sacrifice within the temple. Kalighat temple will be cleaner because of the verdict; the devotees will have freer access to the goddess. But the judiciary needs to ponder about where it should draw a line regarding its powers of intervention.

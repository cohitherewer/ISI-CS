 Letters to Editor

 One more time

 Sir Scotland Yard and MI5 deserve full credit for thwarting the plot to blow up in midair ten US bound flights from Heathrow (British police bust strike on 9/11 scale, Aug 11). It proves that alert intelligence agencies can foil any attempt by terrorists to kill innocent people and cause an international uproar. The Indian government ought to take the help of experts the Scotland Yard has shown the way to track the culprits of the recent Mumbai train blasts as well as the attacks on tourists in Kashmir.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 Sir By unmasking the conspiracy to blow up trans-Atlantic flights, British intelligence and the police have not only averted a great human tragedy but also made it easier to unravel some of the links in the global terror network. It will be difficult to counter terrorism unless the international community acknowledges the common thread running through all acts of terror 9/11 onwards. The global terror trail can lead to only one location the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. The best bet is to control this region by cutting off its logistics. A responsible democratic government in Pakistan would go a long way in securing this end. India, on its part, needs to toughen its stance against terrorists operating from this region. Our response to acts of terrorism against us has not been honourable ever since the Kandahar hijack. Perhaps, an operational group comprising India, Israel, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States of America can be formed to hunt down terrorists all over the world instead of waiting for their next attempt to bomb trains, buses and markets.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune 

 Sir Although the diabolical design of terrorists to blow up aeroplanes has been foiled, it is interesting to note that Pakistan played an important role in both the making and breaking of the plot. American action all over the world is only managing to create more recruits for al Qaida. It is imprudent of India to grab the hand of Uncle Sam, who ignores us when death and destruction comes Indias way from Pakistan, while self-righteously justifying the invasion of Lebanon. But Britains case is slightly different. Patting the back of intelligence agencies and the police will not help Tony Blair save his skin once the British parliament convenes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir The editorial, Where from Heathrow (Aug 12), blames the West for fomenting terrorism through divisive policies, economic and political exploitation and what not. If the West is responsible for terrorism, how is it that global terrorists are all Muslims? And why is it that of all erstwhile colonies it is only the Islamic countries that generate terrorists? Why is there terrorism in Chechnya, which was never ruled by the West? Why do Shias and Sunnis fight among themselves in Iraq and Pakistan? Could there possibly be something within the Muslim psyche that is the link between Muslims and terrorism? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The editorial, Where from Heathrow, does not mention that the lack of education and a promise of paradise make it easy for the vulnerable Muslim youth to be brainwashed and lured into mindless and heinous acts of terrorism against innocent civilians.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir Indian airports are under threat similar to the one just defused at Heathrow. However, unlike Britain, our Central and state governments are yet to rise above vote-bank politics and wake up to the danger. For instance, illegal constructions exist right next to the runway of the international airport at Mumbai. The Maharashtra government must brush aside the flimsy objections raised by local businessmen and politicians and take steps to protect aircraft and passengers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Geraldine H., Mumbai

 Sir George W. Bush may have been extraordinarily harsh in his choice of words, but there is no denying the fact that the free world, comprising democracies with open and plural societies, is threatened by Islamic fascism. The nightmarish plot hatched by terrorists, with close Pakistani ties, in Britain is an eye-opener on how 21st century jihad has become a criminal enterprise.

 Yours faithfully,

Megha A., Hyderabad

 Sir The latest terrorist plot could not have been foiled without the help of Pakistan. At the same time, it could never have succeeded without Pakistans active help and support. Pakistan has once again pulled a grand diplomatic coup by using Islamic terrorism as a double-edged sword. While allowing the industry of Islamic terrorism to run within Pakistani territory, Pervez Musharraf occasionally busts a plot or two to please his Western bosses. Surprisingly, his cunning has succeeded again and again and he has been consistently rewarded with pats and promises of more military and economic aid. This way, Pakistan can train, arm and push more terrorists into India while screaming Kashmir on the world stage. In contrast, Indias rudderless foreign policy has failed miserably either to isolate Pakistan or to persuade the world on Kashmir. Moreover, India has shown that it is capable of neither preventing terrorist strikes nor nabbing the terrorists. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

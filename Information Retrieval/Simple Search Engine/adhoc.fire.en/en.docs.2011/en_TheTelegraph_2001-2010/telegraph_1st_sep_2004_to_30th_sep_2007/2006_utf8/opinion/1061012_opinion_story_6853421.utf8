 Letters to Editor

 Friendliness doesnt pay

 Sir It is surprising to read about the reaction of Pakistans interior minister, Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao, to Mumbai polices claim that the Inter-Services Intelligence has masterminded the recent blasts in Mumbai trains (7/11 buck at Pak doorstep, Oct 1). Surely, India would not accuse Pakistan without proper evidence. The Pakistani ministers rejection only proves that the guilty always cry louder than the rest to prove their innocence. After the blasts, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, did voice the suspicion that they were the work of elements across the border. Yet, India, nave as it is, still harboured hopes of a negotiated resolution of bilateral issues with Pakistans president. India should not initiate any attempts at peace unless Pakistan actually reins in the ISI and other resident militant groups. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir The people of India should thank the Mumbai police for zeroing in on the real culprits in the recent bomb attacks in Mumbai trains. It is now left to the prosecution to build a strong case to ensure that the strongest of punishment is given to those guilty. Most important, we have to have enough evidence to pull up the Pakistan government in the international forum, and charge it with the crime of instigating terrorism. Keeping in mind the recent revelations, it is a matter of shame that our prime minister was again taken for a ride by Pervez Musharraf in Havana. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir It is time India officially starts working on ways to destroy the ISI network so that the very root of terrorism can be decimated in the subcontinent. Surely our intelligence agencies have the werewithal to plot the total destruction of the enemy spy set-up. Pakistans economy needs be completely crippled in order to stop the government from pumping funds into its terrorist-breeding programmes. Once the ISI base is destroyed and Pakistan is put in its place, global terror will slowly decline. India should do its bit for world peace, even if it means declaring war on Pakistan. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanta Das, Calcutta

 Sir Instead of shuffling between a shaky policy of cordiality and a prompt show of displeasure whenever a fault with Pakistan is exposed, India should once and for all take firm action against its neighbour for sponsoring terrorism in India. It is hard to understand why Manmohan Singh is so eager to shake hands with Pervez Musharraf when the ISIs involvement in the Mumbai train blasts is undeniable. Is the prime minister still ignorant about Pakistans real intentions or is he just pretending to be nave?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Brijesh D. Jayal gives a good picture of the parameters within which the Pakistani army operates vis--vis India and how Pervez Musharraf as its chief must continue propagating the anti-India bogey or lose his head (Art of surrender, Oct 2). In the light of the Indo-Pak anti-terror agreement signed at Havana and the revelations about Pakistans hand in the Mumbai train blasts, it seems that Musharraf has laid the precondition that the agreement precludes all that has happened in the past. Has this been accepted by the Indian prime minister then? If so, then the new foreign minister of India can achieve little by presenting evidence of 7/11. Musharraf and his high commissioner in New Delhi have stressed that Kashmir is to be excluded from the agreement, as the militants in the valley are not terrorists but freedom fighters. Also, the general has warned the world against blaming the ISI, for without Pakistani support, the West will surely fail against al-Qaida and the taliban. The battle lines are thus clearly drawn: The West is too bogged down with Iraq and Afghanistan to shed a tear for India. The Indo-Pak situation cannot be equated with Israel and Lebanon. The only means now available to India are economics, diplomacy and containment, the very policies that the United States of America so effectively employed against the Soviets.

 Yours faithfully,

V.P. Singha, Calcutta

 Sir A person exposes himself when he is angry. It is telling that Pervez Musharraf, when criticized for being hand-in-glove with terrorist organizations, shot back, saying that the world (read the West) will be crippled without Pakistans help. Musharraf also claimed that the ISI had played a crucial role in getting rid of numerous al Qaida militants. Had that been really the case, the militants would have caused Pakistan ten times the harm they caused the West. This clearly means that Pakistan has a control over the global terrorist network. Given his desired compensation, Musharraf might consider curbing its actions.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir Even though several anti-Indian incidents have revealed the involvement of the ISI, the agency has remained unindicted for decades. Why should we always be arm-twisted by Pakistan at peace talks? India should adopt the policies patented by George Bush to tame Pakistan. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

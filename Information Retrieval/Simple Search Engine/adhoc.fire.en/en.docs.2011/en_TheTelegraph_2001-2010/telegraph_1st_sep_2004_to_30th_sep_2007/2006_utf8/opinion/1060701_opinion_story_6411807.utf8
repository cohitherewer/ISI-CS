 Letters to Editor

 Cup that unites the world

 Sir ? As we watch the World Cup unfold in Germany, everything about the tournament seems incredible. Our boys do not play such wonderful football, our girls don?t dress up like the Brazilian belles cheering their team, nor do we have such wonderful stadiums. All this till we read that the shortage of toilets has forced football fans to urinate on bushes, thereby threatening Germany?s plant life (?Plants pay for lack of soccer toilets?, June 27). It is good to know that faced with basic human urges, people behave in an identical way the world over.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Charitable business

 Sir ? It appears that the media is obsessed with the rich and the famous (?Buffet billions for Bill trust?, June 27). However, the fact that Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are rich does not make them any different from the rest. And neither Buffet nor Gates has done anything unusual. While Gates is busy making plans to extend his business empire to India and China, Buffet is looking at alternative ways to invest his huge fortune to evade tax officials. Hence his decision to donate a huge portion of his wealth to charity. Their actions can in no way be termed selfless. In any case, they are returning far less to the society than what they have amassed. Therefore the poor in India should think twice before praising Buffet. After all, the rich ensure that certain sections of people remain poor so that they have the opportunity to shower them with gifts in the name of charity. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Charity beyond home? (June 25), is correct in saying that Bill Gates?s decision to step down as chairman of Microsoft in order to devote more time to charity must be taken with a pinch of salt. Now, with Warren Buffet joining in the race for charity, it seems that some of the world?s richest men are suddenly trying to outdo each other in being generous. Their haste in donating wealth is enough to raise suspicions about the real motives of these businessmen. One would have loved to believe that Gates and Buffet are acting out of goodness of heart but, unfortunately, the nature of their donations hardly gives credence to such a belief. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Nupur Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? The world?s second richest man?s decision to donate a large share of his wealth is an admirable example of benevolence at a time when the world has become increasingly indifferent to the plight of the poor. Rich capitalists who have created their empire by exploiting nature?s resources should follow in Buffet?s footsteps and think of new ways to help those who have played a part in creating their wealth.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? It feels good to see that the two richest men in the world are also the two most generous souls. By donating a large part of their fortune, Buffet and Gates have shown that they possess not only superb business sense but also hearts of gold. Their contribution to global charity will remain unsurpassed in the history of the human race. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Khemka, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The concerted efforts of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett will certainly improve the lot of underprivileged people in many countries of the world. It might also help eradicate many social evils, most of which result from acute poverty and deprivation. If this is true, then it goes to show that turning nations into killing fields is not the only way to vanquish disparity and injustice. Philanthropy can also help make the world a safer and a better place.

 Yours faithfully,

 N. Mitra, Guwahati

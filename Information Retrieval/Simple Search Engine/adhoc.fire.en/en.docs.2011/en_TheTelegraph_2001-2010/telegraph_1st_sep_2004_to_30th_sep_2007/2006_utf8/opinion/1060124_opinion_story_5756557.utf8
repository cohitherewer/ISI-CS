 JUMBO JET

 Jet Airways?s acquisition of Sahara Airlines has raised the question whether the deal will hurt competition in the aviation sector. The consensus estimate seems to be that Jet Airways?s market share will move up to 47 per cent from its current 35 per cent. At first glance, that should not be cause for concern, especially since not only are there several competitors left in the field, but also because Indian, the public sector airline, continues to have a substantial market share and because the field is open to new competitors. Nevertheless, certain issues do come into focus. First, it may not be the right approach to club the low-cost airlines on the same platform as Jet Airways. As Air Deccan?s management has pointed out, they cater to a very different segment of the business. Seen from this perspective, the Jet-Sahara deal has shrunk the competition from three regular airlines ? Jet, Sahara and Indian ? to two, Kingfisher being too small currently to make a difference. Much will depend, therefore, on how Indian decides to play the game. Next, the acquisition will give Jet nearly 85 per cent of the flights on the Delhi-Mumbai route, which accounts for half the total domestic traffic. The overall market share number therefore hides the substantial market power that the acquisition will give Jet in crucial sectors. And finally, Jet will now have access to Sahara?s airport infrastructure, which includes parking bays, prime time take-off and landing slots, check-in counters and business lounges. It is well-known that there is a severe shortage of airport infrastructure, and analysts have argued that Jet has paid a premium for acquiring the rights to this scarce commodity. However, the transfer of these parking slots and landing rights is not automatic and the advantage can only be a temporary one, but there?s little doubt that the prospect of one airline having the lion?s share of these facilities has unnerved the smaller players.

 From Jet Airways?s point of view, the acquisition makes a lot of sense. The company?s third quarter financial results have shown a drop of 53 per cent in net profit, while its seat occupancy has dropped from 73.3 per cent in April 2005 to 68.8 per cent in November 2005. Also, in spite of a larger income, Jet Airways?s operating margins have been squeezed. Under the circumstances, given the constraints on airport infrastructure, growth by acquisition was the way out. Costs can now be reduced, and volumes increased. For the industry, the first step towards consolidation has been taken and we should expect more such deals and alliances. From the customers? point of view, therefore, there is a need for a competition commission, which can probe the issues impartially and suggest safeguards, if needed.

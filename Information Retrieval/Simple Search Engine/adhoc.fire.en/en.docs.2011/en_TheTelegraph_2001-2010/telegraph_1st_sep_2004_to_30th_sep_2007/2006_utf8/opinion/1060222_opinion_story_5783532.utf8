 THE STARS IN OUR FIRMAMENT

 The odd man out

 Raoji Bandodkar

 Larger than life

 The celebrity cult is well-suited to the Indian character. In our mythology, gods have regularly deigned to live among us to perform their divine deeds, and have, on occasion, shown some endearing signs of fallibility as well. In the A-list of our present celeb-deities come sportspersons, especially cricketers, film stars and politicians. In the B-list, there are business tycoons, especially from the IT sector, a few civil servants, larger than life due to self-inflated reputations, and mediapersons who make it their business to exalt each other. The role of the big and small screen in the typology of these celebrities is pretty evident.

 Cricket is a pastime perfectly in tune with our collective persona. A non-global sport played at a glacial pace by less than a dozen English-speaking member countries of the former British empire, the sport is replete with a profusion of statistics and recondite musings on the character of a 22-yard strip of earth. It is also an advertising person?s dream come true ? a player identified with a particular consumer product can be seen on the small screen for hours at a time, even when not performing a crucial task or playing especially well. 

 This is reality TV at its pinnacle. Everyone is entitled to a comment on the game, even obese box-watchers who have never played any sport in their lives and whose only exercise is in rising with difficulty from the front of the television set during the several, and often lengthy, intervals when play is aborted. These interruptions, not known to any other sport, provide valuable opportunities for commercial breaks which are repeated with mind-numbing persistence. 

 The day is surely not far when there will be 50 or more Indian television channels showing cricket in its manifold aspects; sen- iors, ladies, senior ladies, un- der-18s, under-15s, under-11s, tennis ball cricket, one stump cric- ket, French cricket and so on. There would be another 20 channels with round-the-clock comment on the game by geriatric ex-players, groundsmen, managers, umpires, scorers, statisticians, actuaries, astrologers, film stars, politicians, chief executive officers of IT firms, and media barons, because a golden rule of the celebrity culture espouses that celebrities are expected, and indeed obliged, to express an uninformed view on everything that exists in this universe.

 The plethora of statistics associated with the game of cricket is highly appreciated in the only country in the world where the Guinness Book of World Records is taken seriously, and the game serves as an essential social dimension for the stability of the state. It fixates millions of people to the dream of a better tomorrow for the cricket team or a particular player. Gods, when they live among men, may have charming human frailties from which they are rapidly exonerated since they retain their hold over us even though we may lose faith in them temporarily. They may endure setbacks, and even occasional failures, but they will always bounce back and triumph. This is exactly the basis of our cricketing hopes. The game is an unbeatable pain-reliever, with superb addictive qualities which insulates the fabric of Indian society from the expectations of the 35 per cent among us who exist on less than a dollar a day, and the 80 per cent who live on less than two dollars a day. The 80 per cent can bond with the 20 per cent in looking forward with hope to the next match, the next season, the new coach and a better cricketing future.

 And what of our other celebrities? The various categories merge and draw synergy from each other. The film stars ride piggyback on the cricketers by playing charity games and attending some matches, and the cricketers are comfortable on the fringes of Bollywood and ?acting? in televised commercials. Some umpires also join in the fun by being highly theatrical. 

 Politicians, even without a shred of originality, charisma or sex-appeal, are perhaps the only people who can achieve celebrity status bereft of any real talent or qualifications other than that of having been elected. The more inconsequential the politician, the more the publicity that is needed. They des- perately crave media attention and the lat- ter need them too, a reciprocity which can lead to a very unwholesome arrangement. 

 The business tycoons are celebrated because they have a lot of cash or handle a lot of cash which belongs to other people. They are also known for making the dullest public statements because businessmen are mortally afraid of alienating any authority, central, state or local. Some civil servants, puffed up with transient importance, try to manipulate the media, and in the process become the most manipulated lot themselves. The media people treat each other as celebrities because that is the way they like to see themselves.

 Those who control the media organs are in pole position because it is they who determine who are the celebrities of the day. They steer the popular mood in this respect though they have to be conscious of the fluctua- tions in the public?s interests and affections. In a self-renewing process, they have to replace waning favourites with the intro- duction of new faces and make them famous and their names household currency. This may seem a heavy responsibility but the media carry this burden lightly, especially because celebrities sustain the viability of the media. 

 The average Indian is apt to be respectful of authority, impressed with achievement, starry-eyed about material success and sycophantic towards superiors. So there is little surprise in the fact that ordinary Indians venerate the celebrity culture. This adulation is made all the easier as criteria such as merit and suitability are fashioned by remote, and often, inscrutable forces.

 There are very few Indian celebrities who enjoy fame on the international circuit. The easiest way to achieve celebrityhood in this country is by earning some kind of media recognition outside India. Even notoriety helps in this respect. Hollywood groupies, mistresses of famous men, squires of princesses and actresses, passport-seekers, murderers, arsonists, gun runners and felons, all qualify for stardom. And so the self-serving merry-go-round keeps on turning and churning out money in its wake.

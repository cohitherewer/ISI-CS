The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Leader in the making

 Sir One can only despair on reading the report, Salem posters sprout in UP (Oct 24). It is unbelievable that Abu Salem, a man who is perhaps responsible for hundreds of deaths in the Bombay blasts, can metamorphose overnight into the benevolent neta of Mubarakpur in Lucknow. However, in India, the reputation of most politicians is determined by the number of corruption and criminal cases against their name. So Salem should fit the bill perfectly. Perhaps it is only a matter of days before Salem goes to parliament. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arunima Sen, Calcutta

 Exploit less

 Sir The editorial, Dire threat (Oct 25), voices the fear that the information technology industry, owing to its global links, cannot afford to suffer any disruptions. I am against strikes in any industry for any cause, political or economic, and hence would ask: is IT, which till very recently was considered a sector for exploitation, suddenly more important than the railways, the lifeline of the Indian economy? Can the railway services afford to be disrupted, thereby cutting off national links? All strikes are disruptive and should be banned. Insulating only one sector from this menace is hardly the solution. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The Centre of Indian Trade Unions, with its archaic notions about the labour-capital relationship, has done more harm than good to the economy of West Bengal. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, in his newfound confidence as the chief minister, hoped to hold in check the canker of industrial indiscipline by inducing a mental make-over in the Citu leadership. He had extended an open-arm invitation to investors, assuring them a congenial climate. But his grip over the Citu appears to be tenuous. He has not been able to prevent the Citu from forming an association with the IT employees. Come December, he is sure to be in for a shock, as the opponents of the new industrial policy are teaming up for a subtle show-down to push him into a place where, they feel, he belongs. It is clear that the Citu is not going to budge from its stance. Can Bhattacharjee stand up to the challenge so subtly thrown at him? 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir Investors have no right to deny the IT sector employees a weekly holiday. They have a working day which runs beyond eight hours and a weekly work schedule of over 48 hours. In the name of development, investors cannot overlook the International Labour Organization convention, or the Factories Act. By offering high salaries, employees in this sector have virtually been converted to currency-note slaves. Their family lives bear the brunt of this. Work-related stress is making many of them vulnerable to heart-related ailments. A union is an absolute necessity in the IT business. If trade unions must not disrupt work with strikes, industrialists too should ensure that employees are not mercilessly exploited.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The decision to extend the date of filing income tax returns by companies to November 30, instead of October 31, could have been taken much earlier. In fact, it should have been announced before the start of the festive season. The finance ministry was surely aware of the holidays during October and the complications in the new form. An earlier decision could have helped Indians to celebrate their festivals in a more relaxed mood, without the October 31 deadline looming large over their heads.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

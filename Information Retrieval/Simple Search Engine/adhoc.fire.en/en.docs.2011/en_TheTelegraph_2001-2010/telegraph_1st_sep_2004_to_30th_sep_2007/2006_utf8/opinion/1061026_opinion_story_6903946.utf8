 WHEN THE CANVAS TELLS A LIE

 INVISIBLE LIVES

 Students of art in Calcutta should help art college models get due recognition and remuneration 

 They might have inspired many a masterpiece, but the models who pose for hours in the citys art college are not masters of their own lives. The fact that their job profile is mostly about posing in the nude obviously has much to do with this. True, ancient Indian arts love affair with nudity is for everyone to see in the caves of Ajanta and Ellora or the Khajuraho sculptures. But it seems that the naked human (mainly female) body is only acceptable when there is some divine association to justify its existence. outside a religious context, nudity only embellishes a work of art, and ceases to have a character of its own. The artist can still hope to be lucky and hear a few good words on his creativity. But the models, whose bodies protest from having to sit or stand in one position for long hours, get lost somewhere in the appraisal. No one enquires about her, and even if someone does, it is mostly out of a perverse curiosity. 

 The Indian model willingly shies away from the limelight; otherwise she has to confront some very uncomfortable questions regarding her choice of work. At the very mention of a nude model, people ask, are they sex workers as well, or strip-club dancers? Shrouded in layers of paint, the models portraiture belies their actual predicament. Often emaciated and malnourished, art models in India are the picture of misery. 

 The use of models, both draped and nude, dates back to the ancient Greeks. Even Renaissance painters drew with the aid of live models. The approach towards art has undergone a positive transformation over the centuries, and has led to the shedding of many a taboo. Indian greats, like Raja Ravi Varma, have repeatedly used nudity as a form of artistic expression. Yet, while models in Europe and America enjoy the perquisites that other professionals are entitled to, apart from being respected as individuals, their Indian counterparts are far too deprived and stigmatized to even ask for regular pay. 

 India has always played safe. We have burqa-clad women here and housewives who still cover their heads with their pallus. In such a conservative set-up, nudity is scandalous. The film, Bandit Queen, was banned here because it had a rather long nude scene. Yet, Kali is one of the principal deities devoutly worshipped by Indians. But the models who pose for paintings are mere mortals they cannot disclose their identity in a world which will not lose any opportunity to criticize a woman who has to pose in the nude to earn her bread. 

 Nude modelling is summarily dismissed by most people as another name for the flesh trade. Hence the attitude towards it is that of disdain. This kind of work is obscure for most people, and therefore, ignoble. It is precisely because of this that models in India do not receive their due. They cannot even venture to make people aware of the crises they face. In West Bengal, which is home to militant unionization, there is no organized union for the models affiliated to art colleges even when sex workers have been organized into unions. There is no college or government forum they can approach to demand a regularized salary, medical benefits, annual bonus, leave sanctions, or any other privileges regular employees receives. 

 While talking to nude models in the Government College of Art and Craft in Calcutta, it became quite apparent that they are treated like pariahs by the governing body. More than the paltry sum of money they get as wages for each sitting, what hurts them deeply is the lack of social acceptance. The students treat them kindly, even help them with money, but neither they nor the college faculty actively protests against their sorry plight. In October 2005, the students of J.J. School of Arts, Mumbai, called a strike to protest against the lack of models for figure-drawing. These models had quit their job because of inadequate pay. Can art students in Calcutta not do something similar to improve the situation of the models here? Till society is purged of these prejudices and the models find an independent voice, should budding young artists not save them from further exploitation? Can the government, which champions the cause of the proletariat, not ensure that their labour is given the dignity it deserves?

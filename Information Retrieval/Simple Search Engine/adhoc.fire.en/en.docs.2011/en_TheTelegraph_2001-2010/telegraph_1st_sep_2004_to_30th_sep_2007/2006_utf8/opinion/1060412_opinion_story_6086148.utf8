 BUCK STOPS HERE

 The law has a long arm, if it decides to use it. Salman Khan may have killed protected chinkara deer seven-and-a-half years ago, but he has been sentenced to five years? rigorous imprisonment and a heavy fine for all that. The chief judicial magistrate who passed the sentence in a Jodhpur court made it clear that the harshness of the penalty was partly exemplary. A hero in people?s eyes had to set an example. Read from another angle, the comments would suggest that the court had to set an example ? or rather, send a message. No one is above the law, not even someone with a popular following as big and passionate as Khan?s. Even this is the easiest, though not a mistaken, way to perceive the sentence on the film star. That an example is being made of Khan is obvious enough: although he gets a cell for two dozen people to himself, a bathroom, a fan and his own clothes, he has to eat jail food and actually live in prison for at least two days before the petition for his bail can be presented. He had been sentenced a few weeks ago to a years? imprisonment and a smaller fine; but the sentence had been suspended to allow time for appeal. This time though, the sentence was passed on the eve of the court?s closing for two days, and the length of the imprisonment has ensured that a higher court will have to hear the bail petition.

 This context is significant. Justice, ideally, is neutral, but the implementation of justice is mediated through numerous realities that make the ground uneven. Khan is a repeat offender, and his offences are marked by the callousness of the glamorous rich. Neither laws, nor the struggle of communities like the Bishnois to protect endangered species matter in the attitude he and his companions represent. This is the second in the four cases against him on similar charges. There is the larger context of the Jessica Lal murder case, where public outrage against the verdict has forced both the government and the courts to think afresh. The rethinking about the status of hostile witnesses suggested by the Congress president seems to have been pre-empted in action by the Jodhpur court?s refusal to accept the retraction of a key witness?s statement. It is important to signal to the people that things are changing, that justice is important. Khan?s conviction does suggest that. A retrial of Lal?s murder case would strengthen that belief.

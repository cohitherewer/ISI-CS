The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOUCH AND GO

 Remembrance of things past is not always a pleasant occupation. The former actress, Ms Jayamala, who is waiting to be interrogated by the Sabarimala temple?s own vigilance wing for an indiscretion on her part close to two decades ago, knows that. In fact, the anxiety is self-inflicted. It is Ms Jayamala herself who admitted to her folly ? of entering the temple and touching the deity, both of which are forbidden for women aged between 15 and 50. The urge to confess came after an astrologer declared, with alarming certainty, that a woman artiste had defiled Lord Ayyappa, the bachelor god, sometime in the not-too-recent past. Had her action some 18 years ago not left her deeply uncomfortable, Ms Jayamala perhaps would not have been provoked to rake up the past. Unfortunately, Ms Jayamala, a product of her social conditioning, does not seem to be thinking very differently about the nature of her deed than the holy authority now ranged against her. 

 Behind Ms Jayamala?s way of thinking ? notwithstanding her little rebellion against convention ? as that of her detractors is the established belief about woman?s corruptive qualities. And the idea is not peculiar to Hindu religion and society alone, although in this case they might be inviting the most censure. Hinduism regards fertile women between the ages of 15 and 50 ? the period from puberty to menopause ? as the most damnable for their presumed irresistibility (even to god). The belief, which betrays patriarchy?s deep-set fears about female fertility, has often been used to keep the ?impure? woman away from rituals and matters divine, which is still very much the male prerogative. Ironically, this is true even for a progressive state like Kerala, where Sabarimala is located. So while temples change their norms to accommodate even male Dalit priests, the prescription against women stays. And given India?s increasing touchiness about the sanctity of what is known as tradition, it is likely to stay that way. The diktats of the temple authorities, in all probability, will not be contradicted in the name of religious freedom. Despite the furore in the state assembly or sloganeering by women?s organizations, devotees like Ms Jayamala, who send priests scrambling to purify shrines, will continue to sneak in through the backdoor.

 UNFINISHED BATTLES

 If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee lost his cool with his cabinet colleague, it points to a larger problem that he faces, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Long march ahead

 For Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, 2005 ended on a slightly sour note. At the year?s last cabinet meeting, he frowned and fretted at his higher education minister, Satyasadhan Chakraborty. Stung by a sharp reprimand from the chief minister, Chakraborty offered to quit. The apparatchiki at Alimuddin Street, with whom the minister complained of undeserved humiliation, has put their decision on hold until the assembly elections this year. But the episode points to a larger problem that the chief minister faces. 

 Why did Bhattacharjee lose his cool and vent such anger at a senior cabinet colleague? He cannot be unaware of the fact that the deliberations at cabinet meetings are routinely passed on to the media by some of the ministers. The chief minister rebuking a senior colleague, that too someone belonging to his own Communist Party of India (Marxist), is just the kind of stories that the media justifiably love. 

 It was another such story, involving a tiff between the finance minister, Asim Dasgupta, and the land reforms minister, Abdur Rezzak Mollah, that caused a ripple a few months back. On that occasion, too, Mollah drove straight from the cabinet meeting to Alimuddin Street and complained to the state CPI(M) secretary, Anil Biswas, against Dasgupta?s ?outrageous insinuations?. Incidentally, Dasgupta joined the chief minister in criticizing Chakraborty too. 

 It is, however, no coincidence that Mollah and Chakraborty happened to be two ministers who were thus humiliated at cabinet meetings in recent months. There is a link between the two events and together they point to important developments in Bhattacharjee?s scheme of things. 

 The Mollah episode first. True, it was not the chief minister, but Dasgupta, who needled Mollah. It happened while Mollah opposed the government?s initial plan to give away large tracts of land in his assembly constituency in South 24 Parganas to the Salim group?s proposed commercial projects. He also foiled the government?s plan to relax the urban land ceiling that would have made large plots of such land available to the Salim group and other investors.

 Now, 2005 was also the year when Bhattacharjee had major successes in wooing large-scale investments in Bengal. After a lull in the previous years, 2005 created quite a wave of fresh investment hopes. Having tasted success, Bhattacharjee was impatient to do more in order to get more investments. He had the party generally backing him. But there was still a section of party leaders who were not fully convinced of the economic and political benefits of his policies for the people at large. 

 These leaders shared the chief minister?s enthusiasm for new industrial and commercial investments, but not his thesis that some old rules must be bent to make room for the new games. Mollah is one such leader, but he is not alone in the party. Dasgupta may have expressed the chief minister?s impatience with the spoilers within the party when he got into the tiff with Mollah. But Mollah is a veteran of inner-party battles and it is significant that he actually succeeded in forcing Bhattacharjee to revise the government?s original plan for finding land for the Salim projects. He also managed to stall the government?s move on lifting the ceiling on urban land. It would be na?ve to believe that Mollah could have done all this without the support of other party leaders.

 Let us now move on to the episode involving the higher education minister. It is no secret that the chief minister is unhappy with the state of higher education. Two things in particular have bothered him about higher education for quite some time. For the past four years, he has been promising to grant some colleges such as Presidency and St Xavier?s the status of autonomous institutions. He has identified at least five such colleges to start with. 

 But he has met with stiff opposition from within the party, especially from the leaders associated with the government college teachers? association. As with Mollah?s opposition, these teachers? resistance draws its strength from the position taken by some top leaders of the party, including Anil Biswas. These leaders rule the roost in education and see in Bhattacharjee?s move a threat to their power and influence. 

 The chief minister?s other complaint about higher education is even more important. He is simply disgusted with large sections of college teachers, mostly belonging to his own party, who are unable or unwilling to do their job. In private conversations, he has no qualms about saying that most of these teachers have no business to be in the profession. But doesn?t he also know that they got the jobs by pleasing the party bosses? 

 He may feel the same about large numbers of schoolteachers as well. There could well be another occasion when he loses his cool with the school education minister, Kanti Biswas. The point, however, is that Bhattacharjee is actually fuming at those party leaders who thwart his plans to reform education. It is also an admission of his own failure in education, for reforms in industry and education are closely linked in his vision of a new Bengal. Bengal may get more of IT and other high-tech industries, but Bengalis, with a CPI(M)-controlled education, may not be good enough to get jobs in these. But the party will not loosen its grip on education because teachers form an important constituency of the party?s mass base, particularly in the districts, and can influence other social groups. 

 When Bhattacharjee led the Left Front to its sixth consecutive election victory in 2001, I had said in an article in this newspaper that education was a major area over which he would have to fight a hard battle with his own party. He still has the battle on his hands, as the Chakraborty episode has shown. He has failed to break the party?s stranglehold on Bengal?s education and the failure clearly is hurting his self-confidence. Hence the outburst at the cabinet meeting. 

 One could argue, though, that the chief minister?s impatience and anger should be good for Bengal. A chief minister impatient with failures and frauds is so much better than one who would suffer them in silence in order to buy peace with his party. 

 It is not that his party has not changed. For all its rhetoric, the CPI(M) is a party that keeps changing its policies to suit the changing times. It is also a party that keeps its political interests above everything else. Bhattacharjee has raised hopes that he can stand up for his new beliefs even if the party does not fully share them. There is little doubt that his economic reforms reflect the party?s new strategy. 

 But then, when the elections come, he cannot expect to take the credit for his government?s successes and let the party shoulder the blame for its failures. If he cannot get the party to agree to his plans, it is his failure. After all, it is his government, warts and all.

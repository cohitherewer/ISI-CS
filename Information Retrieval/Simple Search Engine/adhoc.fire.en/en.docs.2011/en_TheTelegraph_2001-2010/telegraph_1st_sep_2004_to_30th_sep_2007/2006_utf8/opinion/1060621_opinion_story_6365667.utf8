 Behind closed doors

 Sir ? Susmita Chakraborthy?s death is unfortunate and does not auger well for the army (? ?Suffocated?, lady officer kills herself? and ?A fighter who hated girlie jobs?, June 17). It is sad to know that even in this age, women are not treated at par with their male colleagues. In this particular case, Susmita had found the work assigned to her humiliating. This discrimination is evident all around in a male-dominated society like ours. Which is why the future of women in the army looks bleak. Despite the claims of the army counsellors that they are keeping soldiers in good spirits, they are obviously failing to perform the task. The army top brass, as well as the government, must look into this matter, and those in the armed forces guilty of sexual harassment should be severely punished. Women?s rights must be securely established before it is too late. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? The comment of the army vice-chief, S. Pattabhiraman, that the armed forces could do without women is a serious affront to their rights. Getting rid of those who complain against the institution is not the best way of solving the problem. The recent suicide of a woman officer has once again raised questions about women?s dignity and safety in the male-dominated army set-up. The defence ministry should set up an expert-committee to suggest means for expanding the role of women in the armed forces after considering the practical aspects. The Israeli army could provide a good model for such a venture. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Susmita Chakraborthy?s suicide may bring skeletons out of the army?s closet. Prior to her, Major G. Shobha Rani had hanged herself in May 29 and on April 30 Captain Sumeet Kohli had shot himself. From 2003-06, 430 officers and jawans have committed suicide due to stress and strain or sexual harassment. The army top brass has always tried to explain such incidents as resulting from ?depression?. But will the establishment explain why a lady officer was asked to organize late night parties? 

 An army job is undoubtedly tougher than most civilian jobs. Staying away from one?s family, frequent transfers, difficult working conditions take a heavy toll on the men and women. Add to that the gender bias. Soldiers have to be properly counselled and if the real issues that cause stress to the personnel, particularly female, are left unaddressed, there will be more such deaths of promising soldiers.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Susmita?s case points to the utmost importance of counselling and aptitude tests before embarking on a career. Her experience shows the army in poor light and may discourage intelligent boys and girls from joining the forces. The army invests a lot in their officers and it would be a colossal waste of taxpayers? money to allow men and women to quit the army after having undergone the training. It is difficult to sympathize with Susmita, who deprived someone else more committed from joining the force and ultimately refused to serve. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir ? The reasons for Susmita Chakraborthy?s suicide require serious investigation. The government will have to amend its policy on inducting women in the combat wings. It seems strange that the army finds itself unable to employ merely 918 women officers on assignments of their choice. The explanation given is confusing. Officially, the army wants women officers to be ?mentally prepared for the rigours of army life?. This is exactly what Susmita wanted, and yet she was made to do ?girlie? jobs. The authorities should have been more sympathetic and alert about Susmita?s problems since she attempted suicide twice before. The fact that she chose an army job instead of civil service proves that she was a fighter. Ultimately, it is the army?s loss that it failed to utilize Susmita?s potential and enthusiasm. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? S. Pattabhiraman?s remark is shocking. He may have made the comment to cover up the episode and prevent a scandal from breaking. Perhaps the truth behind Susmita?s death could have been known had the psychiatrist treating her been allowed to be interrogated. But it is unlikely the army will allow such intervention.

 Yours faithfully,

Hemanta Kumar Dutta, Howrah

 Sir ? Men like S. Pattabhiraman disgrace the Indian army. It is time for soul-searching within the armed forces to find out where things are going wrong. Why are so many officers and jawans succumbing to pressure, and what kind of pressure is being built up? Pattabhiraman must be made to apologize for his remark, failing which he should be court-martialled. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 An abbot on a mountain 

 IN THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS 

 (Mapin, $40.95) by Kurt Meyer and Pamela Deuel 

 Meyer reproduces a fascinating photographic record of 

 Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and Sikkim kept by John Claude 

 White between the years 1883 and 1908. White was a civil 

 engineer by education, a colonial administrator by profession 

 and a photographer by vocation. He worked as an engineer 

 at the British residency in Kathmandu and spent two 

 decades in Gangtok as the first British political officer 

 overseeing British interests in Sikkim, Bhutan and Tibet. 

 This is a photograph of the Shigatse Abbot (right) in 

 his tent at Khampa dzong. The abbot had been 

 sent by the Panchen Lama to meet the British mission 

 in the camp at Khampa dzong. The abbot?s tent 

 is a black yak-hair enclosure with a small canopy, protected 

 from the piercing winds of the high Tibetan plain only 

 by a canvas wall.

 A black and white world

The Corporation That Changed The World (Orient Longman, Rs 295) by Nick Robins is the story of one of the world?s earliest and most successful corporations ? The East India Company. This commercial venture, a ?forerunner to the modern multinational?, had a rather humble beginning, starting its life as a trader in Asian spices. But at its zenith, it held its sway over the entire subcontinent ? the jewel in the British crown. However, underneath this spectacular economic accomplishment lay a dark underbelly ? the social record of the company was characterized by events such as war, famine, stock market crashes and corporate rivalry, which brought untold misery on its subjects and on the land that it ruled. Robin?s book may not help modern conglomerates carve out an empire in today?s world but it can certainly give them an idea or two about how to manage their affairs.

 Racists (Penguin, Rs 250) by Kunal Basu takes us back to a deserted island in Africa in the mid-nineteenth century, the setting for ? the most audacious experiment? in the history of human civilization. Two infants, a black boy and a white girl, are to be raised in this primitive environment by a young nurse, incapable of influencing the children in any way on account of her muteness. The objective is to find out whether one child turns master, and the other, a slave.Or will love and mutual respect triumph over the forces that divide humans in terms of colour? 

 Basu?s plot is a clever inter-play of history, science and romance, and sets about seeking an answer to the question whether the world can really be divided in terms of the colour of human skin.

 The blindness of insight (Navayana, Rs 200) by Dilip M. Menon is yet another offering from the ?Other Heading? series which serves as a platform to explore theoretical questions that remain unanswered.The four essays in this book talk about the reciprocity between concepts such as caste, class and communalism in Indian society which is a curious amalgamation of the traditional and the modern. The caste system is the ?central faultline in modern India? and, Menon reminds us, that the use of violence to strenghthen such divisions is often invisible.

 Small giants: Companies that choose to be great instead of big (Penguin, Rs 395) by Bo Burlingham talks about how fourteen privately-held companies renounced size to become the best in terms of quality. The journalist in Burlingham has taken great pains to tell readers that other firms can draw important lessons from the triumph of the lucky fourteen. But what he does not reveal is why a journalist should dish out such inanities that have a rather limited following.

Good heavens!: One-act plays for children (Puffin, 

Rs 195) by Poile Sengupta is a delightful little book which is dedicated 

to all those ?who love theatre? and would like to know more about it. Sengupta 

has divided her work into two parts. The first serves as an introduction to theatre 

and sifts through the various processes associated in the writing and staging 

of plays. 

 The second ? a collection of seven plays ? looks at the different aspects of production such as stage lighting, sound and choreography of music. The meticulous approach and useful nuggets of information would help the uninitiated grasp the various aspects of the stage.

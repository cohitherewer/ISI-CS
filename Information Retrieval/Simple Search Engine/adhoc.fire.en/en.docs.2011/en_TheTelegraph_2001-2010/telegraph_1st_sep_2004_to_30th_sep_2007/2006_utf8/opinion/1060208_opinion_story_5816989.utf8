 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Recommendation No. 146: this international standard, which accompanies the Minimum Age Convention No. 138 (1973), specifically emphasizes strengthening labour inspection and related services by, for example, providing special training for inspectors on detecting abuses in the employment or work of children and young persons and on correcting such abuses; strengthening government services for the improvement of training offered in enterprises; placing emphasis on the role which can be played by inspectors in supplying information and advice on effective means of complying with relevant provisions of the law and in securing enforcement of the law, coordinating labour inspection and inspection of training to provide economic efficiency; having the labour administration services work in close cooperation with the services responsible for the education, training, welfare and guidance of children and young persons.

 It further recommends that labour inspection should give special attention to: the enforcement of provisions concerning hazardous types of employment or work; the prevention of work during the hours when instruction is available where education or training is compulsory; taking measures to facilitate the verification of ages, such as maintaining an effective system of birth registration, including issuance of birth certificates; requiring employers to keep and make available to the competent authority registers or other documents which give the names and ages or dates of birth of children and young people who are employed and who receive vocational orientation or training in their enterprises; and issuing licences or other documents to children...who work in the streets, ... stalls, in public places, in itinerant occupations or in other circumstances which make checking employers? records impracticable and which indicate the eligibility to work.

 The recommendation suggests several measures that could make enforcement effective, such as the provision of appropriate training for the government officials concerned, especially inspectors and law enforcement officials.

 Convention No. 182 requires ratifying member-states to apply the convention to children under 18; take immediate and effective measures to prohibit... the worst forms of child labour... adopt programmes of action; ensure effective enforcement, including penal or other sanctions; take preventative measures for the removal from work, rehabilitation and social integration of the children concerned; ensure access to free basic education; take account of the special situation of girls; and take steps to assist each other through international cooperation and/or assistance. 

 Recommendation No. 190 postulates the design and implementation of national programmes of action which aim at: identification and denunciation of the worst forms of child labour; preventive action and the removal from work, rehabilitation and social integration of the children concerned through measures that address their educational, physical and psychological needs; giving special attention to younger children, girls, hidden work in which girls are at special risk; and children with special vulnerabilities or needs; identifying, reaching out to and working with communities where children are at risk; raising awareness and mobilizing society; determination of the types of work that are hazardous; compilation of data; establishment of monitoring mechanisms to ensure effective implementation; designation of certain of the worst forms of child labour as criminal offences; and effective enforcement measures.

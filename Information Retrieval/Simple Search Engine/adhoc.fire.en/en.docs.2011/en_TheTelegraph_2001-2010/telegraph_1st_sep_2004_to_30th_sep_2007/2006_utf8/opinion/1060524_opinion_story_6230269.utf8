The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOR A PIECE OF THE SOUTHERN PIE 

There are already murmurs of discontent in the Democratic 

Progressive Alliance, days after its victory in Tamil Nadu, writes M.R. Venkatesh

 Berth pangs 

Hours after a new coalition government led by the 

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam was installed in office in Tamil Nadu, supported for 

the first time by four parties from outside, including the Congress, the mosaic 

of this year?s assembly polls verdict that unseated J. Jayalalithaa brought to 

mind two metaphors ? ?Tantalus? for the Congress and the ?Buddha? as balm for 

a suffering DMK.

What stares at the face of the Congress in Tamil Nadu 

now is the imagery of Tantalus, who, according to Greek mythology, was punished 

in the following manner. Tantalus was provided with fruits and water but he could 

not lay his hands on either as they moved away whenever he tried to get hold of 

them.

The Congress, having won 34 of the 48 seats allotted 

to it in the DMK-led Democratic Progressive Alliance and whose support is crucial 

for the survival of the DMK-led government, faces the same predicament. It is 

neither able to share the fruits of power with the DMK, nor is it able to slake 

the new thirst of its party men.

Amid cries from sections of the Congressmen here that 

a historic opportunity to be in government is being lost nearly 40 years after 

the Congress was voted out of power in the state, the swearing-in ceremony of 

the Karunanidhi ministry went off smoothly with senior Congress leader, Pranab 

Mukherjee, himself gracing the occasion.

But the only comforting word for the disillusioned 

state Congressmen came from Veerappa Moily, Congress working committee member 

in charge of Tamil Nadu. He said that while power-sharing was not discussed before 

the polls (many assumed that DMK will get a simple majority on its own), the aspirations 

raised in the minds of the Congress legislators and in the party on joining the 

government would be duly addressed by the All India Congress Committee.

This keeps the door for the Congress?s entry into 

the government open. M. Karunanidhi?s brilliant campaign ? he led from the front 

braving the summer heat ? and the DMK?s stunning poll manifesto had won all round 

applause. The results hinted that it was basically a mandate for Karunanidhi?s 

fighting spirit and his desire to become the chief minister of Tamil Nadu for 

the fifth time.

Though the DMK?s allies are in agreement on this assessment, 

the Congress and the Pattali Makkal Katchi have insisted that the DMK should draw 

up a common minimum programme. This development is the first definitive signs 

of the pressures within the coalition. This has come after a 31-member ministry 

had been ushered in, for which the DMK inducted many new faces for the first time. 

All the subjects have been allocated to the DMK ministers, and there are hardly 

any portfolios left to accommodate cabinet berth aspirants among its pre-poll 

allies.

A CMP would ensure that the party?s hands will be 

tied. It would also be a radical departure from the ?alliance politics? of the 

past in which allies preferred to sit as a constructive opposition and made no 

direct claims to the spoils of power after the elections were over. This is definitely 

a thing of the past, and it prompted the outgoing chief minister to comment that 

it would be difficult for Karunanidhi to function due to the pulls and pressures 

in the coalition.

In his retort, Karunanidhi used the metaphor of the 

Buddha. Terming himself to be ?very fortunate? to have been sworn into office 

on a day that coincided with the commencement of the 2550th birth anniversary 

of Gautama Buddha, the DMK leader reminded his cadre that the spirit of purity 

and compassion symbolized by the Buddha ?should...guide us in power?.

Karunanidhi started off in a dramatic fashion? signing 

three orders at the swearing-in ceremony including the orders to provide quality 

rice at Rs 2 per kg to all ration card holders from June 3 and a massive waiver 

of all crop loans of farmers that they owed to cooperative societies and banks. 

However, his party faces an uphill task in implementing the pre-poll promises 

given Tamil Nadu?s fiscal situation.

A narrow margin of about 4.30 percentage points in 

the vote-share separated the winning DMK-led coalition from the All India Anna 

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam-led alliance in this election. The actor-turned politician, 

Vijayakant, surprised the political pundits with a noteworthy vote-share. Vijayakant?s 

fledgling outfit, the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam , cut into the traditional 

vote-banks of both the main Dravidian parties but damaged the AIADMK more than 

the DMK. M.Venkaiah Naidu, a leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which drew 

a blank in Tamil Nadu, felt that the small percentage points difference in the 

overall vote-share between the main parties could be explained by the fact that 

the minorities had supported the DPA.

Two other factors contributed to Jayalalithaa?s defeat. 

These included the distress of farmers? arising out of three years of continuous 

drought which was followed by the subsequent floods and the state government employees 

and teachers? steely resolve to unseat Amma for her decision to dismiss 

about 1.70 lakh government workers for their decision to strike work for a day 

in July 2003.

Caught in a fiscal trap, the Jayalalithaa regime had 

to strike a balance between a liberal and humanitarian response to the drought-hit 

farmers. The tsunami and the floods that followed made the situation worse, even 

as the government tried to simultaneously implement a package of painful economic 

reforms to make Tamil Nadu qualify for aid from multilateral agencies like the 

World Bank.

The former finance secretary, N. Narayanan, who later 

became chief secretary, had to diligently push some of these reforms including 

the pension reforms that hit the babus and teachers very hard. To be fair 

to Jayalalithaa, her government managed a fiscal turnaround towards the end which 

helped Amma to roll back most of her unpopular measures.

But state government employees and teachers never 

forgave Jayalalithaa for the police ?repression? on striking employees. Moreover, 

the first casualty of a radically populist DMK manifesto that promised free colour 

television sets for poor households was Jayalalithaa?s attempts at state-level 

economic reforms. This forced Jayalalithaa to respond with a slew of populist 

measures in the midst of her election campaign, including offers of 10 kgs of 

free rice to ration card holders every month and a write off of all crop loans 

owed by farmers to cooperatives.

However, it proved to be rather late in the day for 

Jayalalithaa. Her sops were debunked as carbon copies of the DMK?s promises. Karunanidhi 

had the advantage in this, as he had already established a connection with a major 

section of the farmers and the state government staff with the help of his party?s 

manifesto. The manifesto, according to finance minister, P. Chidambaram, was the 

real ?hero? of this election .

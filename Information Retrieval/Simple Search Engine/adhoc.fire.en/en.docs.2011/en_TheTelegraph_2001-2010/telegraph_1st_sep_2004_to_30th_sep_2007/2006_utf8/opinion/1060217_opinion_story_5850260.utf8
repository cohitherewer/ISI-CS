 LESSONS FROM VENICE

 Malvika Singh

 It is always refreshing and, in some ways, exhilarating to leave India and travel away from the man-made mess that symbolizes our homeland and life within it. Venice represented what we need to absorb and learn from. One of the world?s most unusual and special cities, this centre of great culture, trade and tradition has been nurtured with intelligence and deep caring. 

 We, on the other hand, abuse our tradition and the edifices as well as the environment that made India a civilization that ruled the imagination of the world centuries ago. From 1947 till today, with Indians at the helm determining the future for their fellow countrymen, we have consistently destroyed our inherent strengths and diluted the sense of pride that is critical for any real social and economic advance. We have had at the helm elected representatives who have exploited us in much the same fashion as those who conquered and ruled us. The bottomline for the ruled and their relationship with the rulers have been the same for centuries.

 The Venetians are staunchly proud of their home, their past, present and future. They zealously protect these from vandalism, something we see happening across the world, particularly in the subcontinent. ?Revival? has become a mantra in Venice and the world congregates here to celebrate that energy. 

 In contrast, we, in India, scratch names on the walls of ancient historic edifices venerated by the sensitive in the world community, we spit and pee on every wall we find regardless of its antiquity, we destroy skills that are ingenious and worship the worst of unaesthetic junk that is dumped on us through advertising or television. There was a time when the Mughal ateliers produced unmatched products. Neither the many art forms nor the skills were cultivated or revived in free India and many slid into oblivion while others limped along, getting adulterated with neglect. Treasures succumbed to thoughtlessness.

 New beginning

 We have a great deal to learn from the Italian experience in this area. Historical buildings and palaces are restored, lived in and maintained as a legacy held in trust for the future generations. Silly municipal rules do not apply but instead, intelligent and firm strictures control the public and private space. Misuse is not obvious as it is in India. Archaic and unacceptable interventions, based on a colonial past, that are enforced by the authorities in India have made a complete mess of our material and natural heritage. 

 To extricate ourselves from the mire would be a heroic task but one which will restore our dignity as a multicultural entity. A renaissance is called for in this realm immediately. If only the babus in government and the political leadership understood the importance of diverse cultures. The endless disconnected policies and blind application of thoughtless norms by the octopus-like arms of the government need to be re-addressed before whatever remains disintegrates.

 This inability to recognize the substantial magnitude of our many-layered civilization, as we move on in a fast changing world, is short-sighted and careless. Where many countries of the world are retreating into their shells, isolating themselves behind the purdah of conservatism and its regressive effects, not knowing how to deal with alien, growing cultures and ideologies that come from a part of the world that was till recently suppressed economically, India can use its multicultural strength and reality to bring about dialogue, tolerance and peace in the world. To allow those who govern us to become political and economic stooges of declining world powers seems foolhardy and grossly unwise. But alas, where are the visionaries who are needed desperately on our political spectrum? They seem to have eluded us.

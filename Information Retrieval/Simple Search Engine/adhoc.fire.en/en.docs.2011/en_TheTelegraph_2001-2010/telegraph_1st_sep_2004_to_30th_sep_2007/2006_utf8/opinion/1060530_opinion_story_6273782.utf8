 Letters to Editor

 Destroyed in freedom

 Sir ? The decision of the theatre- and multiplex-owners of Gujarat not to screen Fanaa raises the vital question of freedom of speech and expression in the country (?Aamir, the unapologetic?, May 26). It is even more shameful that this is backed by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government. One shudders to think what would have happened if a person living in Gujarat had supported the Narmada Bachao Andolan ? as Aamir Khan, starring in Fanaa, does. Perhaps this person would have been ostracized or even burnt, given Gujarat?s track record. Gujarat can no longer boast of being part of a democratic country if the state government believes that it is going to act in a similar way with anyone who dares to oppose its decisions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? Even if Aamir Khan were to actually oppose the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam, nobody would have the right to stop him from travelling and doing business in Gujarat. Whereas all that he has advocated is the rehabilitation of the dam oustees, which is exactly what the Supreme Court has demanded on the issue. The BJP and the sangh parivar are holding Gujarat to ransom. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Hasan Jowher, Ahmedabad 

 Sir ? If Fanaa is not released in Gujarat, then the financial losses will be suffered not by Aamir Khan but by others involved in the film. Keeping this in mind, the simplest way for those in Gujarat opposed to Khan?s stance on the NBA would have been to refrain from watching the film instead of banning it. If it so happened that most Gujaratis kept away from the film, then it would not have run for long in the cinemas, in any case.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? Aamir Khan?s support for the NBA deserves to be praised. Building the Sardar Sarovar dam without rehabilitating the poor farmers displaced in the process is hardly a commendable stance. Banning Fanaa in Gujarat brings to focus the way in which a personal vendetta is being raised to a political level.

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Lall, Perth Amboy, US

 Sir ? Aamir Khan?s sympathy for the displaced farmers is praiseworthy. It is good to see him utilize his celebrity status for a greater cause. Khan is no politician, but by taking the initiative to comment publicly on the issue, he has proved to be a conscientious citizen. He has been declared as anti-dam and anti-development by the BJP, but is it not unconstitutional to seize land from farmers in the name of progress and forget about their rehabilitation? Banning Fanaa unless he apologizes for his comments amounts to blackmail. 

 Yours faithfully,

Babhrabi Nandy, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Aamir Khan?s support of the NBA, even at the cost of jeopardizing the fate of his films, must not be viewed merely as a publicity stunt. He must be sincerely concerned about the thousands of villagers who will be rendered homeless once the dam is constructed. Khan can exercise a great deal of influence on the public because of his position as an immensely popular actor. The BJP leaders should know that banning Khan?s film in Gujarat will not suppress the truth, and right-minded people will support Khan once they realize how serious he is.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Aamir Khan might be an idealist and an activist, but he is also an opportunist. He does not, ostensibly, believe in award ceremonies ? but only as long as they are held in India. For when Lagaan made it to the Oscars, he went out of his way to impress the jury. He is opposing the construction of the Sardar Sarovar dam, but has no qualms about behaving like a buffoon in commercials for soft drinks that damage our health, and whose factories also exploit poor villagers. He tries to look like a crusader but that is at the expense of the producer of Fanaa. Now that Khan is past his prime, and facing serious challenges in his career from younger actors, he is desperately looking for an alternative vocation. It is not uncommon for fading stars of Bollywood to join politics. Perhaps he hopes that bashing the BJP will endear him to the Congress and its allies like the left. But shouldn?t he remember that the Congress cannot make tall claims for artistic liberty, now that it was almost banning The Da Vinci Code? 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? It is wrong to ban a film on the basis of an actor?s remarks on an issue that has got no relation whatsoever to the film being banned (?Not in love?, May 25). However, if the chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, finds Aamir Khan?s stance objectionable, then he should argue with the latter on political grounds. Khan is wrong to criticize the riots in Vadodara which are not, in any way, connected to the Narmada issue. Besides, Khan?s contention that Modi?s government had failed to contain the riots reveals his ignorance of the subject. If Modi had not taken the initiative to curb the violence, then it would have become more serious than it actually did. Khan should take an informed and unbiased look at the situation before making hasty comments.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the Muslims protest against anything that is unacceptable to them, they are promptly branded as intolerant. But nobody seems to recognize the fanaticism evident in the BJP?s attempts to coax Aamir Khan into an apology. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Sabir Ansari, New Delhi

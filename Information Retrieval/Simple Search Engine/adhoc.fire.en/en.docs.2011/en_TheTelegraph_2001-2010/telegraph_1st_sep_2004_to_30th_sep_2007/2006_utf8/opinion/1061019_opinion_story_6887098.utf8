The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STAY VIGILANT

 Should the Reserve Bank of India raise its policy rates at its next credit policy meeting at the end of this month? Those who argue against the move will point out that the United States of Americas Federal Reserve has stopped its series of rate hikes. That considerably reduces the external pressure on the RBI to raise rates. Foreign portfolio inflows have resumed and there is no longer any need to raise interest rates to defend the rupee. Moreover, crude oil prices have softened considerably, thus removing one of the main sources of inflation. This is the line of thinking that led to the fall in bond yields since the highs reached in July. Of late, however, thanks to some jawboning by the RBI, bond yields have moved up again, although certainly not anywhere near their highs. Those who argue that the RBI must raise rates point to the sizzling rate of growth of the economy. They point to the fact that bank credit is growing at 30 per cent, while money supply growth has been 19 per cent, well above the rate of growth of nominal gross domestic product. On the other hand, inflation continues to be high, indicating that if the RBI does not try to cool demand, inflationary pressures may get out of hand.

 There is little doubt that global liquidity conditions have improved since the sell-off in the equity markets in mid-May. Since then, interest-rate fears have dissipated, to be replaced with hopes of a global soft landing. Oil prices have tumbled from their highs, and the lower expectations of growth in 2007 have resulted in lower bond yields globally. In the US, for instance, the yield curve has become inverted, with the 10-year bond yield at a lower level than short-term rates. But while Indian bond yields too have drifted down, growth expectations for the Indian economy are very different from that of the US economy. With investment demand by corporates remaining high, growth in India is likely to remain strong and so will demand for funds. In this scenario, therefore, the flattening of the yield curve to the extent seen in September appears to have been unwarranted. That is all the more so because the relatively benign level of inflation seen so far is the result of a base effect that will wear off in the coming months. Moreover, the fall in long-term bond yields could once again lead to lower rates for consumer and mortgage credit, adding fuel to already high rates of growth. In the circumstances, the RBI can hardly afford to relax its vigil, regardless of what the politicians say.

 GUILTY WITHOUT TRIAL

 Raju Mukherji

 Envy makes a person blind to his own faults. Most men who are pointing fingers at Jagmohan Dalmiya today belong to this breed. For the last ten years, the same people were both the policy-makers as well as the watch-dogs of Indian cricket. They held numerous positions in the various committees of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. They accepted and applauded the decisions that Dalmiya took. After being elected to power, the same set of people are raising allegations which they themselves had once acknowledged as authentic. 

 Over the years, they did not raise any objection to Dalmiya?s style of functioning. If there was misappropriation during Dalmiya?s tenure, then why should his detractors, who were the supposed co-conspirators, not be nailed to the cross as well?

 The real reason for their anti-Dalmiya stance has precious little to do with cricket administration. But it has everything to do with their jealousy of Dalmiya?s success as an honest cricket administrator. Dalmiya has impeccable manners, is accessible and loves debates. Criticizing his policies would often have a positive effect because he would acknowledge his mistakes and try and rectify matters. Not many high-powered officials in the BCCI are as sporting as Dalmiya. 

 If 1929 is taken to be the birth year of the BCCI, then the first 67 years have been full of intrigue, conspiracy and sabotage. A tour manager had once claimed that the BCCI funds had been blown off the deck on the Atlantic. On another occasion, a treasurer had pilfered huge sums of money. Influential officials have often forced undeserving players to be selected in the team. Even the beneficiaries of the ?Sharjah largesse? were selected at random. All these activities were accepted without a murmur. There never was any accountability in the administration of the BCCI.

 Smear campaign

 While in power, Dalmiya?s critics themselves had overlooked the crimes of others. Not once did they make an attempt to set the ?wrongs? right. The style in which the board functioned was never transparent. So why is Dalmiya being singled out for punishment?

 Was this because the presidential chair of the BCCI was occupied by a man who hailed from unfancied Calcutta? The same man had also sat on the International Cricket Council throne, thereby becoming the first Indian to head the premier cricketing body of the world. Apart from teaching cricket administrators how to market the game, Dalmiya has also contributed to Indian cricket by helping many young cricketers achieve their dream of playing for the country.

 During Dalmiya?s reign, cricketers from all parts of India got a chance to represent the nation on the international stage. Today, young cricketers from Jharkhand, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, among other states, no longer feel that they need to go to a major city to win a place in the side. They know that if they are capable, the national cap awaits them.

 Dalmiya?s tenure as the president of ICC may have made the average Indian cricket fan walk tall, but this did not go down very well with some administrators in the BCCI. They could not accept the fact that one of their own had overtaken the rest and occupied the top position in the ICC. 

 For most of them, this was the proverbial last straw. From that day onwards, a concerted effort was made to soil Dalmiya?s reputation. There is no doubt that the man?s policies are not above criticism. Dalmiya is famous for backing wrong horses. But the man?s integrity is beyond doubt.

 Sooner than later, Dalmiya would be walking with his head held high. But the attempts to malign his image would forever remain as a blot on some of the administrators in the BCCI.

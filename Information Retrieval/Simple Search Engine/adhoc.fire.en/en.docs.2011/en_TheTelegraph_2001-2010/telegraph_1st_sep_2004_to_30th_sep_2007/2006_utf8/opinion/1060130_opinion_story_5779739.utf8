 HOPES IN TERROR

 Democracy may spring deadly surprises. Its Western sentinels ? the United States of America, Britain and the European Union ? would have had cause to rejoice over the Palestinian elections, which were remarkably free, fair and peaceful. But the rejoicing has been made difficult, rather dramatically, by the results. Hamas ? perceived to be the quintessential ?terrorist organization?? has won a sweeping victory. The Palestinian electorate appears to have chosen, almost unanimously, theocratic terror over the possibility of negotiated peace with Israel. But that is only one way of looking at the verdict. The situation, like the nature of Hamas itself, is informed by contradictions. An apt emblem for these contradictions was the sight of polite Hamas officials helping voters inside computerized polling booths against a backdrop of huge posters of suicide-bombing ?martyrs?.

 It is easy to overlook, given Hamas?s profile since the mid-Nineties, that what ordinary Palestinians have chosen is the right to hope for a peaceful existence. This is also a judgment, an expression of despair, against the non-achievements of the Fatah and the Palestinian Authority with regard to the peace accord. Opting for Hamas also harks back to this organization?s original identity, large elements of which managed to co-exist with its more violent transmutations. Hamas, founded in Gaza in the late Eighties, is named after an Arabic acronym for the Islamic Resistance Movement, which also means ?zeal?. Its roots were in welfare charity though, and even after its political, intelligence and military wings evolved, together with its radically anti-Israeli stance, it continued to provide social support and fight corruption within the Palestinian political system. As a party, it called itself ?Change and Reform? during the latest elections. This dichotomy may now be forced to resolve itself as it comes, from an officially marginalized position, into political eminence and responsibility, and puts itself even more prominently in the gaze of the world. That is Palestine?s hope, and the international community, wondering what to do with feeling morally obliged to help a country now being run by people deemed terrorists, would do well not to lose sight of this last ditch at optimism.

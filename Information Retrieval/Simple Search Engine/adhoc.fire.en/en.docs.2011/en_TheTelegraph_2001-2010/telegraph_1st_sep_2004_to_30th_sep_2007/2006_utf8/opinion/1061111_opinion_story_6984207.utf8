 Letters to Editor

 Anything for Guinness

 Sir I was astonished to read that doctors performing a laparoscopic cholescystectomy on a 100-year-old woman chose to write to the Guinness Book of World Records (Successful surgery at 100, Nov 5). Shouldnt they have written to a medical journal instead? Why do Indians have this puerile fascination with the Guinness Book? Indians perform abysmally when it comes to competitive sports. Growing the longest nose-hair and getting into the Guiness Book is not an achievment. It seems Indians have an infantile hankering after low-level Western recognition.

 Yours faithfully,

 Telling tales

 Sir Salman Rushdies two-part article, Blood relations (Oct 22 and 23) was fascinating. Rushdie, a master storyteller, superbly merges romantic literary imagination with his perceptive historical imagination. The style of narration is almost as riveting as the tales themselves. Rushdie manages to stoke the feeling of inquiry in his readers.

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Maiti, Calcutta

 Sir After the holy scriptures of Islam, Salman Rushdie has picked the Arabian Nights. No doubt his objective is to defame Muslims and Islam. While doing so, he has revealed his obsession with sex (For three years, they each married, fucked and ordered the execution of a fresh virgin every night.) In the end, he calculates the quantum of blood spilled by cutting the throats of 3,203 queens! Will Rushdie please estimate the quantum of blood being spilled by Bush, Blair and Co. on the streets of Iraq every day? Rushdie does not deserve a column in The Telegraph. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Anwar, Calcutta

 Sir As one who has read the entire, unexpurgated version of One Thousand and One Nights more than once, I can state that there is little resemblance between Salman Rushdies version and the original. In any case, one wonders at the point of his essay. Is it a condemnation of the treatment of women in Islam? Is it to show off his erudition? Or is it a defense of the American occupation of Iraq? 

 Yours faithfully,

B. Purkayastha, Shillong

 Road rage

 Sir The other day, I was sitting in a bus, which was waiting in a long queue before the toll tax kiosk on the Howrah side of the Vidyasagar Setu. I saw that two white Ambassador cars with red lights on top, followed by a police vehicle were allowed to pass through the VIP channel. But soon after, a taxi, waving a red cloth frantically (that is, carrying a critical patient to hospital), was not allowed to pass through the same channel and was diverted to a congested public channel. This is the ugly face of modern and high-tech Calcutta.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapas Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir The other day, at the Lansdowne Road-Rashbehari Avenue crossing, as I was taking a left turn, a scooter hit the left side of my car. Within moments, a mob of 15-20 people gathered and started shouting obscenities at me. One man was especially vocal and even threatened to hang me. The scooter, though, had only a single scratch; the first thing the scooterist demanded was Rs 2,000. Fearing for my personal safety, I gave in. The police were happy to play a passive role. One sergeant, Dipak Kumar Das, even refused to hear my version. He pronounced me guilty simply because I was driving a car and the victim was in a scooter. Funnily, the screaming mob melted away as soon as I had paid the money. Gangs like this work right under the noses of the police in our city. Can the citizens still repose faith in the rule of law or in the so-called custodians of law?

 Yours faithfully,

P. Sarkar, Calcutta

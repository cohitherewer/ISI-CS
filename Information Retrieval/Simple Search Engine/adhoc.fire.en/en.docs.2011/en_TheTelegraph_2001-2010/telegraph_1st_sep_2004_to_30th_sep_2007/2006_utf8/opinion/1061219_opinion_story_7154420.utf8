 HISTORY WAITING TO BE MADE

 Manmohan Singh has done his best to encourage Musharraf to go boldly where no Pakistani leader has gone before, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Buzz of new ideas 

 At last, our mealy-mouthed bureaucracy has been upstaged by none other than the prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Returning from Japan Indias newly-minted friend and partner, in the wake of the galvanizing Indo-US relationship over the weekend, the prime minister was asked for his response to Pervez Musharrafs proposals to resolve Kashmir.

 I welcome them, said Manmohan Singh, himself a refugee from Pakistans Jhang district and keenly aware that economic prosperity on both sides of the Radcliffe Line could go a long, long way in mitigating the trauma of the religious partition of the subcontinent. They are new ideas, he went on to add, putting all those off-the-record bureaucratic naysayers wanting to shoot the messenger (Musharraf) along with the message (how to resolve the Kashmir dispute) in the shade.

 It is true that the mild-mannered prime minister could have made the same general comments in response to any subject under the sun. After all, his couple of sentences on Pakistans Kashmir ideas did not either classify as world-class literature or path-breaking discourse. And yet, the prime minister clearly chose his words with care. He did not dismissively point out that these ideas were hardly new after all, his special envoy on Pakistan, Satinder Lambah, who took over the job after the death of the redoubtable J.N. Dixit had been discussing precisely these issues for the last 18 months or so with Musharrafs close friend and national security adviser, Tariq Aziz.

 Singh did not emphasize that Musharrafs musings were still a cliff and a chasm away from the Indian script, especially when it came to the joint management or supervision of both parts of Kashmir. And significantly, he did not complain about the Pakistani presidents bout of amnesia during the long interview on NDTV over terrorism, or his special responsibility in ending the sponsorship of it inside India. 

 In the few words that he did speak and he knew the world was waiting with bated breath to hear what he had to say the prime minister showed that he spoke on behalf of the rest of India. By generously acknowledging the comments of his adversary (Pervez Musharraf) as new ideas, the prime minister encouraged him to stay on the course of going where few Pakistani leaders had gone before.

 Moreover, by restating his intention to visit Pakistan, in response to an invitation, Singh was also sending a message to his critics both in the opposition and in the bureaucracy that a determined effort to the 59-year-old Kashmir dispute was being made. And if, god willing, a solution was soon in sight, he would travel to the other end of the world namely, Islamabad to seal it.

 Indeed, Musharrafs comments and the follow-up remarks by the Pakistani foreign office (Pakistan never had a claim on Kashmir) are so path-breaking that it is easy to break out in goose pimples at their very thought. In recent history, the path to peace with Pakistan has been littered with such overwhelming obstacles Kargil, the December 13 attack on parliament, Operation Parakram and the Mumbai train blasts in July that it would have been a foolish man who attempted to stave off the river of blood with kind words.

 The point is, Pervez Musharraf, the architect of Kargil, needed to publicly say to India that he and his country (in his mind they are one) never had a claim on Kashmir. That is as close as he will come to an apology, on behalf of Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan for the previous wars, and on behalf of himself, for Kargil.

 Metaphorical hand on heart, Musharraf is making the ultimate turnaround in Pakistans history. He can never dare to question the great Qaid-e-Azam, Jinnah himself, or say that he was wrong because he carved out another nation in the name of religion. But by saying that Pakistan never had, or was now giving up, its claim on Kashmir, Musharraf is basically telling India that he is okay with a Muslim Kashmir remaining within a largely-Hindu India.

 So what does that do to the infamous two-nation theory that has dogged the lives of the two ageing twins, India and Pakistan, violently separated at birth? Was the Kashmir insurgency motivated, driven and funded by Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence since 1989 and picked up so seamlessly by Indian Kashmiri boys, in which at least 50,000 people are believed to have died worth it at all?

 Neither Musharraf nor Manmohan Singh wants to stir the old ghosts or overhaul forgotten graves. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who has served longer in parliament today than anyone else alive, knew that India, like Sisyphus, was condemned to roll the rock up the hill again, and again and again. It is a lesson the prime minister has learnt well. In January, when the external affairs minister, Pranab Mukherjee, visits Islamabad to invite Pakistans prime minister, Shaukat Aziz, to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in New Delhi later in the summer, both sides are expected to take the Lambah-Aziz dialogue forward.

 Sisyphus, both Mukherjee and his counterpart, Khurshid Kasuri, will find, may as well have lived in Siachen. If India does not claim the Saltoro Ridge, where Indian soldiers have been perched west of the Siachen glacier since 1984, Islamabad could easily accede to Indias demand by authenticating the ground positions of Indian troops on joint maps. In fact, Siachen could become the ice-breaker that thaws the relationship. It has been four years since the guns at Siachen went silent. As a former defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, well understands the issue at hand. As the foreign minister, he may have to break new ground that takes those sensitivities on board.

 As for Musharraf, he seems poised to rewrite another chapter in the history of India-Pakistan. Having trashed the Hudood ordinance (restoring the rights of women in rape) in the face of Pakistans naya mullahs, the Pakistani president is up against fundamentalists more than ever before. To be sure, Musharraf also plays the ISI both up north in Afghanistan as well as in the east in Kashmir. Manmohan Singhs job is to tighten the noose, with a little help from the Americans, so that the returns from the ISI end are gradually negligible.

 J.N. Dixit and Satinder Lambah, Tariq Aziz and Pervez Musharraf and Manmohan Singh, all these names will one day be part of the great unfathomable. One of them already is. If the rest dont give history a shot, they can be sure history wont give them another chance.

 WHATS IN A PARDON?

 Nirmalendu Bikash Rakshit

 In a momentous decision, the Supreme Court has recently announced that the presidential and gubernatorial power to grant clemency is subject to judicial scrutiny, and that this power cannot be exercised as a political privilege or as an act of grace. The apex courts decision assumes particular significance at a time when Mohammad Afzals mercy petition remains pending and the death sentence passed in an infamous rape case in the capital has created a lot of stir. Even before this judgment, the Supreme Court had set aside the Andhra Pradesh governors decision to pardon a Congress activist who had been convicted of murder. 

 According to the apex court, the president cannot consider political, religious, caste or other extraneous factors while pardoning convicts or remitting their jail term. In other words, while deciding Afzals fate, the president cannot be influenced by the Kashmir chief ministers fear that the hanging would worsen the situation in the state. The rule of law cannot be compromised on the grounds of political expediency. The executive, the court holds, must keep in mind the effect of such clemency on the victims families in particular and the society as a whole, and the precedent it sets. The convicts conduct, potential for reform and his familys plight must be considered before taking a decision.

 The guideline, if faithfully followed, will conform to the spirit of the Constitution. Article 72(1) gives the president the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remission of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentences of any person convicted of any offence (a) in cases where the punishment is by a court martial, (b) in cases where the given punishment is for an offence against a control law and (c) in cases where a death sentence has been pronounced. Article 161 has vested in the governor similar authority.

 Full of purpose

 In fact, clemency includes a group of analogous powers each of which has a distinct meaning and significance. Pardon actually absolves the convict of all punishment and sets him free. Commutation, on the other hand, substitutes one form of punishment for a lighter one. Remission reduces the amount of sentence without changing its character. Respite implies awarding a lesser sentence on special grounds (for example, pregnancy). And reprieve means a stay of the execution of a sentence.

 Although some experts regard clemency as a judicial power, it is an executive power. The president, while exercising the power, does not act as a judge, nor is he supposed to rectify a judicial error. In reality, he does not, in any way, consider the legal aspect of the case. He only looks into the humanitarian side of it.

 The judge examines whether there has been a breach of law. There cannot be any personal aspect in the dispensation of justice. But the president can consider the background of the crime, the situation in which the crime has been committed, the financial effect of the punishment on the petitioners family. In short, the purpose of inserting such provision is to add humanitarian aspect to the legal system.

 It may be asked whether or not such authority is unfettered and absolute. In the Kedar Singh case (1986), the apex court held that the president was not, in such case, bound by the judicial decision. Though the judiciary does not interfere with such affairs, it can see whether the president has considered all the relevant materials connected with the case (Hukum Singh vs UP). And, now, it has opined that the exercise of clemency is not a privilege. It should be exercised solely in the public interest. Otherwise, the court warns, it would soon lead to legalized discrimination and destroy the fabric of democracy. It would also undermine its deterrejnt effect.

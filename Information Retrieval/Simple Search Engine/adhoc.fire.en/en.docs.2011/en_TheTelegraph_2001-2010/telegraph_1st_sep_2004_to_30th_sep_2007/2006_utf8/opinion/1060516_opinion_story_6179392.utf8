 NO SUBVERSION PLEASE, WE?RE INDIAN

 Brokeback Mountain in New Delhi and the hostility with which Indians greet ?difference?

 When Fire, the film by Deepa Mehta, had its first screening in a theatre in the heart of New Delhi, followers of the Shiv Sena damaged the hall and forced the owner to take the film off the screen.

 The men who attacked the theatre found the film?s subject offensive. Tales of forbidden love and sexuality as themes of creative art and cinema have never really found an anchor in Indian society. They always were, and still are, mocked at, derided and denounced. 

 Brokeback Mountain is the most recent in the series of such subversive films. It tells the heartbreaking story of love between two men. But the crowd in the Delhi theatre seemed to be indifferent to the film?s tragic underpinnings and its devastating end. They were blissfully ignorant of how relentless social persecution can destroy a relationship that challenges traditional norms. The viewers did, however, feel occasionally tickled by the scenes of two men kissing and making love.

 The audience comprised young boys and girls, and a few middle-aged people. At one point, a group of young men, so far quiet and busy with their mobile phones, suddenly livened up. ?Money scene aa gaya?, they jeered ? probably meaning the scene they had paid for. 

 Some started whistling loudly. Others made catcalls. The mirth reached its peak during the scene where the wife of one of the protagonists accidentally sees her husband and his partner locked in a passionate embrace. The mindless titters were a telling and depressing comment on how little progress our society has made to being tolerant and less hostile towards ?difference?.

 The audience which had gone to watch Brokeback Mountain was much the same as that which went to see Boys Don?t Cry. Seven years ago, Hilary Swank won the Oscar for her performance in this stunning film on lesbian love. The film ended on a devastating note. Swank ? on being discovered as a woman masquerading as a man? was raped and brutally killed by a group of boys. Even as you were trying to grapple with the sheer horror of what was unfolding on the screen, many in the hall were clapping to see Swank being raped. 

 The Shiv Sainiks, however, did not attack either Brokeback Mountain or Boys Don?t Cry. The reason is simple enough. The sainiks associate Western culture with subversive love and all things evil, which lead the Indian youth astray. It is ?misguided? filmmakers of Indian origin, such as Deepa Mehta, who have allowed themselves to come under the spell of firang culture, who pose the real threat. 

 The Hindutva brigade is not alone in its unwavering faith in the purity of Indian culture. Our parliamentarians ? right, left and centre ? share this perception and demand that the ?cultural invasion? of the West be somehow curbed.

 The resistance to the West is apparent in the sphere of education as well. A large section of left MPs, opposed to Western universities setting up campuses in India, argue that the West is unfamiliar with Indian culture and their ideas may be unacceptable to the people here. Politicians are frequently heard demanding a clamp-down on foreign television channels.

 The themes of gay or lesbian love inhabit a cultural zone that no MP ? regardless of his political affiliation ? wants to defend. When the sainiks attacked Fire, parliament was in session. Left MPs bludgeoned the BJP for its ideological and political intolerance, but skirted the issue ? the right to have a relationship of your choice ? that had provoked the outcry. On the floor of the house, Fire turned into a political baton with which the left beat its saffron rivals. Lesbianism was pushed out of the discourse. Not a word was uttered in its defence.

 There is a strange unanimity cutting through different social layers on issues like this. Institutions like the police, the judiciary and the legislature share the same contempt for subversive love as the tittering audience of Boys Don?t Cry and Brokeback Mountain. Homosexuality is still a criminal offence in the Indian penal code, notwithstanding the sustained protests from groups NGOs. The politicians diligently follow a code of silence which snuffs out any debate on these issues. They are afraid of losing the support of those who make up their vote-banks. Sadly, most of them are orthodox and downright hostile to homosexuals and lesbians.

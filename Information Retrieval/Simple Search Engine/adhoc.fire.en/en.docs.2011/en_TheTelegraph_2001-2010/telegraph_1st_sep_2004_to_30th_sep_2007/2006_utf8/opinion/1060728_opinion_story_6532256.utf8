 GOING SOFT IN THE KNEE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Who was the mole in P.V. Narasimha Rao?s office, and who cares about that past history? It is dead and gone, not relevant to the realities of today. And for the press to pursue, relentlessly, a non-story is even more farcical than the story itself. Frankly, if one looks at the saga clinically and dispassionately, it has been the best marketing gig of recent times. Congratulations to the author and the publishers for having pulled off a national media coup. As for Kandahar, we all remember it rather clearly and we all have a view on all that happened then. To enter such events in an autobiography of sorts is acceptable but to have the media jumping all over the place on non-issues is another story. Sadly, the press is losing its credibility as it over-reacts, embellishes and sensationalizes unimportant happenings to fill pages or screens.

 The unacceptable attack by Israel on Lebanon is hardly mentioned on our prime time news bulletins. The government of India appears to have been gagged by its new master on taking a public stand on this war. Not too long ago, our national leaders would have condemned, in no uncertain terms, this illegal military intervention. Indira Gandhi, for one, would have either played the role of a proactive mediator or would have severed ties with Israel till the ceasefire. To be a mute lackey of a unipolar power, frightened to take a moral position because of the possible repercussions on the tenuous nuclear deal with America, reduces our stature in the world congress of dynamic nation states. The US has always wanted us to heel and for the first time we are where they want us to be! Ironically, the UPA, led by the Congress till some months ago, and historically wary of the US and its politics, which made it consciously keep its political distance, has unconditionally fallen in line. This is no partnership. It is an abdication of India?s historical political position. It is the calling of a soft state.

 Real shame

 That is the tragedy. Here was an opportunity to set a fresh standard within a new parameter, and the UPA has blown its chance. If the prime minister believes that the new model for change is to be a poodle and not an equal, respected partner of the US, he is barking up the wrong tree. Had this government said to the Bush administration that it would play mediator between America and its many enemies in the Middle East and elsewhere, there would have been merit and purpose in the alliance. But to be a mute spectator in world affairs, particularly those that are outrageous by any definition, is a shame for a civilization such as ours.

 Wherever you look, this government has succumbed to pressure and blackmail. The UPA partner, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, has had a free run and reign. The left has bullied and intervened without having taken on the responsibility of governance. It is much like college politics and is another example of a soft state. Tampering with national institutions, politicizing autonomous administrations, allowing inappropriate interventions by ministers and suchlike, reintroducing regressive and archaic systems and norms have been the hallmark of the UPA. Old methods and thinking have been reintroduced, killing the excitement of taking on new challenges and risks that invariably bring new energy into the country. More symbols of a soft state.

 Two years ago, many felt that this government could, in fact, trigger a paradigm shift because it had leaders in its midst who believed in building a modern and vibrant India. We were looking forward to radical administrative reforms, to the dramatic lessening of red tape and the accompanying corruption. Somewhere deep down, we had hoped for a renewal that would rejuvenate a tired and corroded polity. Alas, there is not even a hint of real change in the horizon.

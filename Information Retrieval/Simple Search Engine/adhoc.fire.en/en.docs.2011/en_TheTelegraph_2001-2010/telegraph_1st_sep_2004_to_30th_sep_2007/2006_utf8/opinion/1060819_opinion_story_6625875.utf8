The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AFTER SUCH KNOWLEDGE

 The job of a citizen, Mr Gnter Grass had written once, is to keep his mouth open. The perverse reader might visualize an open-mouthed fool. But Mr Grass is writing here about free and fearless speech, a dogged commitment to the truth even when this truth is unpleasant or inconvenient. It appears now that Mr Grass himself has been rather good at keeping his mouth shut about a few things, and he is certainly no fool in choosing to open it now. For about six decades, he had concealed and sometimes equivocated about his Nazi past. He has confessed now, just before the publication of his autobiography, that in his late teens, he had been a member of Hitlers elite military wing, the Waffen-SS. The confession, together with the book that it strategically heralds, breaks this unholy silence. Most of Germany is shocked, some of Mr Grasss Nobel-winning peers want him to return the prize, and an eminent historian has declared that he would not even buy an used car from this man. Only Mr Salman Rushdie has stood by his friend shocked, but asking for Mr Grasss literary achievements to be judged by their merit.

 First, how much did Mr Grass know about what was happening in the death-camps during his stint with the SS? His writings repeatedly claim initial disbelief, followed by dawning horror as the truth of the Holocaust began to be revealed. He sees his early youth as part of an overarching stupidity. But perhaps it was part of something far more disturbing a willed, collective ignorance that blurs the distinction between not knowing and not wanting to know. As a Panzer man, however young and green, Mr Grass must surely have had to do a great deal of willing in order not to know. Second, it would be particularly difficult, in his case, to separate the life from the work, the past from the present. So much of what Mr Grass has written in his fiction and non-fiction, and stood for as a public figure, has directly to do with individual and national memory and conscience, and with confronting and articulating the truth of ones past. That has been the core of his publicly professed morality, ethics, politics and aesthetics. All that has begun to appear now, quite justifiably, in a bizarre and unsavoury light, even as a monstrous form of hypocrisy to some. What is even more outrageous is his disappointment with the public response to his confessions nobody seems to see the point of his atonement, or the absolving power of publicly rehearsed guilt and shame.

 The Tin Drum will remain The Tin Drum, Mr Rushdie maintains, in spite of the omissions and commissions of Mr Grasss life. But given what the novel is about, it would be impossible not to read it differently in the light of these new truths. Besides, Mr Grasss greatness as a writer is far from being an undisputed fact. It is only the very greatest who can afford to play with good and evil and get away with it.

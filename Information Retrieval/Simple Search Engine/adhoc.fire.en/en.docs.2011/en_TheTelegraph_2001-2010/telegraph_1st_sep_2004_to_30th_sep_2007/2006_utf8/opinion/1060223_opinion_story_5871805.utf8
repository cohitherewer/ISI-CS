 BOLD AS BRASS

 Jyoti Malhotra recounts several instances in recent international politics where India has stood its ground

 There?s a song in the hugely popular animated film, Hanuman, which goes like this : ?Agram, bagram/ Dekho yeh tigram/ Jaadu ki taakat/ Bolo, kisme dam.? For the uninitiated, this roughly translates into the following: ?Here?s a mess, but if you have the strength to fix it, then speak up!?

 The Hanuman song also puts its finger on the pulse of India?s foreign policy. First, there?s the mess between Lakshmi Mittal?s Dutch company which wants to buy out Arcelor, a French-Luxembourg outfit. Despite the fact that all sides are European, there have been racist remarks against Mittal. To add to the fire has been the commerce minister, Kamal Nath, who took the precaution of speaking to the prime minister, Manmohan Singh (perhaps he was protecting himself from the usual refrain, ?Oh, I didn?t know about this!?), before he shot off a letter to the European Union trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, demanding ?national treatment? or trade parity in these days of globalization.

 Singh certainly didn?t want to get involved in a trade spat, considering both Jacques Chirac and George W. Bush are in India within a fortnight of each other. So just as he and Chirac were meeting on Monday, the foreign office was making it known that India did not want to get ?involved? in a European spat. In that case, what was Kamal Nath doing there? An embarrassed silence greeted the query.

 Meanwhile, Kamal Nath seemed to have instinctively understood the latent Indian anger against the ?life?s-just-not-fair? dictum. Mittal has an Indian passport, but as foreign ministry officials pointed out, he paid his taxes in England and lived in London. Perhaps the foreign office was justifying its lack of interest in the matter. Meanwhile, there?s a whole ministry devoted to the ?overseas Indian?, but no one thought of asking Vayalar Ravi. None of it mattered to Kamal Nath. A man who was in some danger of being moved out of commerce if the reshuffle had happened a couple of months ago, is now firmly entrenched in his seat as the defender of the faith. Bolo, Kamal Nath mein dam!

 Then there?s the small matter of separating India?s nuclear programme into civil and military parts that has obsessed the intellectual class since last month. According to newspaper reports, the experimental fast breeder reactors will be kept out of the civilian list till 2010, that is till they become operational and start producing electricity. It is said that Anil Kakodkar, chairman of the department of atomic energy who accused the American government of shifting the goalposts after the July 18 agreement and implied that New Delhi was acquiescing to the shift, is on board. And when India?s ambassador to the United States of America, Ronen Sen, was in Delhi last time, he persuaded both Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to accept the terms of reference. It remains now for the US to agree. The matter will be debated when the US undersecretary of state for political affairs, Nicholas Burns, arrives in the capital for talks later this week. Bolo, kisme dam.

 According to Kakodkar, the US was going back on its July 18 promise of according India all the rights and obligations of a nuclear weapons power. That is, America was insisting that India place certain facilities under permanent safeguards. But the five acknowledged nuclear powers had the freedom to change their minds about what they wanted to do with their own facilities. Kakodkar?s coming out of the closet has since been accepted as part of India?s negotiating strategy by the political class.

 It helped the United Progressive Alliance?s case when a certain letter written by the former national security adviser, Brajesh Mishra, to the then US secretary of state, Colin Powell, was leaked to the press. The Mishra letter, dated July 28, 2002, offered to put all electricity-generating reactors on the civilian list. It was argued that the Bharatiya Janata Party?s and Mishra?s current dismay at the UPA ?selling out? to the Americans was opportunistic in the extreme. The BJP-NDA had not only offered to do the same, but had gone much further. When the letter was shown to Sonia Gandhi, one is told, it reduced a number of apprehensions on the government?s part over cutting a deal with Bush.

 And so Bush will stand in front of the ramparts of the Purana Qila (a possible venue) in ten days or so and pronounce upon the similarities between the world?s oldest and largest democracies. Surely, both sides have come a long way since Madeleine Albright said that India had dug itself into a hole, after the 1998 nuclear tests. Bolo, kisme dam.

 In the interim, India and the US are fast becoming new friends in the new global order. Despite the left-handed criticism of the UPA on Iran and the nuclear deal, New Delhi is going ahead with the extension of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan gas pipeline into India, and calling it Tapi. Interestingly, the prime minister?s statement in parliament last week on New Delhi?s keenness to continue with the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline was conditioned by the economics of the scheme. The Manmohan Singh government is surely banking on the fact that with the US staunchly against the Iran-sourced pipeline, it will be difficult to put together an international consortium that will agree to go where politics dare not.

 Here then is a little-known nugget for all those left-bashers. During the week K. Natwar Singh was in the political doghouse after the publication of the Volcker report, he summoned the Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Prakash Karat, and offered him a deal. In exchange for left support, Natwar Singh would come out against the government?s stand on Iran. Prakash Karat, it is said, turned down the offer. Bolo, kisme dam.

 NEW LEAF

 The culture of policing in India is 145 years old. The Police Act of 1861, framed in reaction to the events of 1857, is quintessentially colonial. It enabled the raj to use the police as an instrument of imperial rule. This entire history, and the ethos it sustained, was carried forward into independent India, which, over the years, infused its own kind of rot into the system, to produce a venerable brew of corruption, politicization and inefficiency. Next to the politician, the policeman remains the most mistrusted and caricatured public figure in modern India. All this is set to change with the Supreme Courts landmark judgment on extensive police reforms, with which the Centre, states and Union Territories must comply by January 3, next year. Since the National Police Commission of 1977, many committees have given their recommendations until now. But very little was actually done, simply because of sustained political opposition and apathy.

 Hence, the apex courts primary emphasis has been on restoring the autonomy of the police by minimizing interference from the executive, while augmenting the structures of accountability to the people rather than to politicians. The three key institutions outlined by the court would put this into action at various levels. The state security commission would supervise policy, the police establishment board look after transfers, postings and promotions, and the police complaints authority would look into allegations of police misconduct. Moreover, investigative policing and the keeping of law and order would also have to become more distinct. These are far-reaching and radical proposals, but for depoliticization to really work, the politicians will have to be as much persuaded of its merits as the judiciary obviously is. Otherwise, this epochal judgment might remain yet another ideal vision.

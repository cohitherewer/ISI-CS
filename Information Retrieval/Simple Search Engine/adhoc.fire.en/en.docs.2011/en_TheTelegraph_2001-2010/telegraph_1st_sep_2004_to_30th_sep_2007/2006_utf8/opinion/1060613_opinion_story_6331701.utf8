 Letters to Editor

 Fuelling discontent

 Sir ? The prices of petrol and diesel needed to be reduced instead of being hiked since the majority of Indian consumers will be unable to afford the new rates (?Oil at half century?, June 6). Is it impossible for the Union government to regulate the periodic hikes in oil prices? Since the public sector companies are the biggest consumers of petrol and diesel, drastic measures should be taken to control their fuel consumption. As for private transport, only fuel-efficient small cars should be allowed on the roads. Finally, oil-prices need to be made uniform throughout the country by levying the same rate of sales tax in every state. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Price of gas? (June 7), was hard-hitting. Anybody who is aware of the unprecedented rise in global petroleum prices would agree that the government had no alternative, although it overlooked many recommendations of the Rangarajan committee. Why liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene have not been touched is not difficult to see. The answer lies in political pressure and vote bank politics. 

 As a result of the intervention of the left, the Bharatiya Janata Party and even some members of the Congress, the government has had to limit the hike to Rs 3 instead of Rs 4. The editorial suggested that a reduction in government levies on petrol (that make up almost 50 per cent of its retail price) would certainly bring the price of petrol down. The government?s answer to this argument is that a loss in revenue would hinder state welfare programmes. And this is where the left?s double standards come into play ? it opposes the hike, but will not support the easiest way to reduce petrol prices ? that is, by the lowering of levies. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The Centre has once again agreed to the demand of oil companies to increase the operating profits by raising the prices of petroleum products. But it has not considered the impact such a move would have on the common man?s pocket. Instead, the government should have asked the oil companies to adopt cost-reduction measures and reduce overheads in their day-to-day operations.That would have automatically increased operating profits. The move to cut sales tax in some states should be extended to the country as a whole and the excise structure should also be modified. A combination of some of these measures would compensate losses without inconveniencing the ordinary citizen. It is also time to increase the domestic production of crude so as to cut down on imports. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nirmallya Sen, Haldia

 Sir ? In order to check the spiralling oil prices, a centralized oil price equalization fund may be created by drawing money from the excise duty levied on oil. Similarly, state governments may transfer part of the sales tax earned on fuel prices to the fund. This fund should then be used to stabilize petroleum prices in the country. Unplanned expenditures and establishment costs should be curtailed by law. Besides, oil companies should be prevented from advertising in the media since oil is an essential commodity and needs no promotion. A portion of the savings of oil companies may be diverted to the oil price equalization fund as well. This would make it easier for the Union government to tackle the frequent rise in international oil prices. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asim Kumar Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is difficult to understand the mindset of the BJP and the left since the obvious reason for the oil price hike ? the rise in international fuel prices ? seems to be beyond their grasp. Instead of unfairly demanding a rollback, the left should practice what it preaches and reduce the sales tax levied on oil in the states where it is in power. West Bengal, for instance, has the highest sales tax in the eastern region, at 24 per cent. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The leftists have known the importance of money for a long time. Their opposition to the price hike of petroleum products is therefore a mere show. They are bound to oppose, even insincerely, for the sake of the voters of the 60 Lok Sabha constituencies who, in 2004, had voted for their ideology and assurances. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s refusal to participate in the country-wide protests called by the left on June 13 confirms that the comrades are merely play-acting. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The skyrocketing prices of essential commodities have already become a matter of concern. The recent rise in the price of petrol is, therefore, ominous. Doubtless this hike will adversely affect the economy. The total increase in petrol and diesel prices over the last two years has made the United Progressive Alliance less likeable, seemingly insensitive, and unconcerned about the poor. What baffles one is that the price-increase in the economy has happened in spite of the left. The notion that the left forces the Centre to pull the prices of commodities down and improve the living conditions of the poor has been proved wrong. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? While the basic prices of petrol and diesel are almost equal, there is a gross disparity between the excise duties and sales taxes of the two items. Petrol is mostly used by the owners of two-wheelers and small cars. Diesel, on the other hand, is used for public vehicles and luxury cars, mainly by businessmen. This is a clear case of discrimination against one group of people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Purushottam Sah, Calcutta

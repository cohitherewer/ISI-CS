 GOLDEN GOOSE AND UGLY DUCKLINGS

 MIND THE GAP

 The IT sector remaining open during bandhs is no indication of progress in West Bengal 

 It is difficult to imagine Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as a software professional. But there can be no doubts about the chief ministers new-found love for information technology. Once, the Marxists and their unions had resisted the introduction of computers in government offices. But new times call for newer measures. Today, for communists in West Bengal, the IT sector is the proverbial golden goose. The state, they argue, can piggy-ride the infotech boom to harvest rich rewards in the form of investments, capital and employment. So much so that Bhattacharjee is now hell-bent on keeping this particular sector secure from the threat of that sacred form of protest bandhs. Jyoti Basu, the supreme authority, has echoed his protgs sentiments by declaring that IT should be treated as an essential service, and that strikes and union activities should be restricted in this particular industry. Even CITU, the militant trade union of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has been unusually defensive over its decision to include the IT sector in the strike called on December 14. 

 Keeping the information technology sector outside the ambit of bandhs is certainly a welcome development. But what the chief minister needs to explain is why has his government not extended a similar promise to other industries and sectors of the economy? Banks, services, retail, manufacturing, hotels to name only a few industries in the organized sector all have a role to play in generating wealth. And then, there is the unorganized sector a huge and complex network of big and small businesses, comprising over 90 per cent of the countrys total workforce whose contribution to the economy cannot be ignored either. 

 Such preferential treatment on the part of the government for a particular sector sends wrong signals to the entire economy. It is as if the government is saying that it is quite alright for strikers to bring other businesses to a standstill, provided they leave software companies alone.

 And it is not entirely true that the sunshine industry is the real mainstay as far as economic growth is concerned. Bhattacharjee and his colleagues should pay very close attention to the figures released by Andhra Pradeshs Economics and Statistics directorate. The IT sector in this particular state contributed a total sum of Rs 1490 crore to the gross state domestic product in 2004-05. It is by no means a negligible amount. But it still falls sort of the Rs 1492 crore raked up by tailors, barbers and laundry-shop owners. This, in a state, which has stolen a march over West Bengal in information and technology. What holds true for Andhra Pradesh should not be entirely irrelevant for a state, which is trying to adopt a similar model to attain economic growth. The Marxists should do well not to ignore the welfare of industries other than IT in their own backyard.

 Significantly, strikes, whether called by the government or by the opposition, are no more the ideal way by which a political party can endear itself to the ordinary people. A sizeable section of the working population in West Bengal is not in favour of such repetitive disruptions. Bandhs, especially the ones called by those in power, spell familiar trouble for the people. The employed find it difficult to report to work, given the absence of transport, and the presence of lathi-wielding cadre who take over the streets. Passengers are left stranded in front of railway stations and airports, with nowhere to go, while the sick and the dying cannot be taken to hospitals. For the hawkers, labourers, vendors and other petty businessmen, it is another day wasted. Matters will remain unchanged this December too. Except for the fact that BPO and call centre workers would be able to go about their business unscathed. They have the chief ministers word for it. 

 Bhattacharjee has his task clearly cut out for him. He has to work harder to wean the unions of their fondness for bandhs. This would undoubtedly take some time. Meanwhile, it would be absurd to see the functioning of the IT sector during bandhs as a sign of progress, when life remains just as annoyingly dysfunctional for most of the city as ever.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Picture perfect

 Sir The photo accompanying the caption, Revolution over, on the run, is an example of quality photojournalism. There are three different characters in the picture. A man fleeing in his sports shoes after vandalizing a car showroom; a security guard, who, instead of confronting the attacker, has his face turned away, and, significantly, a loyal and alert mongrel who seems to be the only one concerned with the situation. The image shows that a violent act never goes unnoticed. But nothing is done to prevent such acts because people often choose to look the other way.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Music rings hollow

 Sir The report, Music fatwa at home or out, (Dec 6), mentions that a maulana has prohibited people to listen to music in and out of their homes in a Murshidabad village. The cleric has also banned playing music in public, citing reasons from the shariat. However, the report does not provide an answer to certain key questions. For instance, do all the villagers share the same faith? If this is not the case, then do non-Muslims have to follow the fatwa as well? The decree is yet another proof of the ghettoization of Muslims in India. The central government must take note of this issue and take steps to stop this practice. Otherwise the day is not far when imams all over India will issue such fatwas and compel people to abide by them. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir The fact that a fatwa has been issued against the playing of music in a democracy such as India comes as a surprise. But what is even more shocking is that the administration has decided to tolerate such edicts. This only goes to show that a parallel power structure exists in parts of India, which does not conform to the laws of the country. The ban is reportedly being implemented by imposing fines on those who dare to break the rules. Predictably, the local police have said that they are not aware of any such development. If this is the attitude of the administration, then there is a real danger of taliban-like pockets developing. Ignoring such an ominous sign can be fatal to the countrys social fabric in the future.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Some of the biggest exponents of both classical and popular music in India have been Muslims. Their faith never posed problems in the pursuit of their cherished interests. And neither did the clerics raise a storm over the issue. So what is the fuss about Muslims playing or listening to music now?

 Yours faithfully,

Rathin Guha, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The Supreme Court judgment doing away with the need for a sanction from the government to prosecute a public servant for criminal offences is likely to have far-reaching consequences in Indian politics (Big guns lose graft shield, Dec 7). It is unfortunate that a large number of government employees and politicians in India have sacrificed their ethical values and indulged in corrupt practices. The ruling will undoubtedly help the courts weed out dishonest members from the government offices. The judiciary must also be congratulated for trying to clean the system. 

 Politicians have often tried to meddle with the judicial system, thereby denting the peoples trust in the delivery of justice. There is no need to protect errant public servants who have abused their position for personal gain. 

 Ordinary Indians would now hope that the highest courts of the country would continue to uphold the course of justice for all the citizens of the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 ANOTHER RED

 The portents were proved right. The Left Democratic Front won in Kerala, a two-thirds majority in a house of 140, and the biggest victory for it in its present configuration. The United Democratic Front could hardly have been unconscious of the coming defeat ? being augured since the Lok Sabha polls, although it was, perhaps, too immersed in addressing its own troubles to be able to do much about it. There was something even rather purblind in the announcement of a new development programme for the state by the former chief minister, Mr Oomen Chandy, on the very day that the UDF was trounced in the local bodies elections by the LDF in October last year. Mr Chandy?s ?Kerala Vision 2010? emphasized development in such sectors as knowledge, education, industries and tourism. A notable absentee in the list was agriculture, although the numbers of farmers? suicides in the state had outstripped those in Andhra Pradesh between 2001 and 2004.

 In the October elections, the UDF?s most celebrated breakaway group, the Democratic Indira Congress-Karunakaran, had an understanding with the LDF. But if Mr K. Karunakaran?s dissidence pointed directly to divisions within the leading Congress, the Revolutionary Socialist Party (Bolshevik) had quit the coalition earlier. Managing the coalition was not proving easy for the UDF, although the DIC(K) had returned to its fold for the assembly elections, to little avail. But factionalism was not solely the UDF?s problem. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), leading the LDF, had its troubles too. It went to the assembly elections, still nursing the tussle for control of the party by the two factions headed by Mr P. Vijayan and Mr V.S. Achuthanandan respectively. Mr Achuthanandan was fielded as a candidate at the last minute, and the LDF victory is likely to bring an urgent edge to the issues at stake. Mr Vijayan is considered to be the reformer, in tune with the demands of the new age, while Mr Achuthanandan, moulded in an older tradition, speaks of reviving agriculture and the traditional industries. There are also hard issues regarding foreign investment in infrastructure and, more tellingly, the pending question over acceptance of a loan from the Asian Development Bank. What Mr Achuthanandan?s government decides on this would indicate to some extent how the Kerala CPI(M) is going to deal with its divided approaches to reform.

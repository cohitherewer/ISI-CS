 Paperback Pickings

 Pilgrims in imaginary homelands

 Elvis, Raja (Penguin, Rs 250) by M.G. Vassanji is a collection of twelve short stories, all of them looking in a myriad ways at expatriate life. Vassanjis craft has resonances of Lawrence, and Naipaul. The very first story, When She was Queen, bears the twin stamps, exploring the dynamics of the Indian diaspora settled in Kenya through the eyes of an adolescent boy. In The Girl on the Bicycle, the knowledge of being peeped at on her wedding night changes Anar Dhallas life forever. Anars story is beautifully woven into the narrators own. The moment of Anars revelation shakes the narrator to her roots: How can I ever imagine what it meant to her, that one scorching moment in the life of a tender, raw nineteen-year-old girl...and what that moment did to all the other moments of her life? Vassanjis Nairobi could easily remind readers of Joyces Dublin.

 The Essence of Rumi (Arcturus, Rs 200) by John Baldock captures the life and works of Jalaluddin Rumi, the 13th-century Sufi mystical poet who has been compared to Dante and Shakespeare. Baldock does a commendable job of outlining the histories of Islam and Sufism, introducing Rumis predecessors as well as peers, and tracing the path which took Rumis writings to the West. The biggest chunk of the book is reserved for discussions on Rumis three most important works, Fihi mafihi, Mathnawi, and Divan-i Shams-i Tabrizi. There is also a section on Rumis themes.

101 Pilgrimages (Rs 395) is part of 

the Outlook Traveller Getaways series, which includes volumes on trekking holidays, 

wildlife holidays, weekend breaks and so on. The maps and ready reckoners are 

a great help, as are the information about the crispness of hotel linen and the 

cleanliness of the loos. This is the perfect guidebook for the new-age pilgrim.

Tango One (Coronet, 6.99) by Stephen 

Leather is a police thriller, which begins with three recruits Jamie, Bunny 

and Tina in different parts of London, preparing for their first day at the 

Metropolitan Police training centre in Hendon. All three, with not-so-illustrious 

pasts, are inducted into a team trying to bust criminal gangs. On the top of their 

list is the gang headed by the worlds biggest drug dealer, Den Donovan, alias 

Tango One.

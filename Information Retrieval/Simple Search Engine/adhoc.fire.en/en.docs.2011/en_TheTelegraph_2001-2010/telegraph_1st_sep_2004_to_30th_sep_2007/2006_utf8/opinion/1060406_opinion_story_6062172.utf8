 LAST POST

 The army of independent India is a colonial army, and it does not quite know what to do with this paradox. One sign of this confusion is the recent attempt to move away from the British practice of calling old soldiers ?retired? or ?ex-servicemen?. The Indian military establishment wants to adopt the nomenclature followed in the army of the United States of America and call old soldiers ?veterans?. At one level, the change is meaningless since all other symbols, rituals and ranks of the Indian army continue to follow the traditions and practices of the British army. Also, the reason for a shift from a British name to a US one is difficult to fathom. A full-scale Indianization, however unwelcome, is at least understandable and defensible. Is it the assumption that ?veteran? endows more dignity on an old soldier than ?retired? or some other epithet? The dignity of an old soldier cannot be guaranteed by a word alone. The transition from uniform to mufti, from army to civilian life and from regimental discipline to the chaos of everyday life is one of the toughest in India. Indian soldiers, like their counterparts elsewhere in the world, are well-trained to defend the country?s borders but not to meet the demands of ordinary life. The military establishment should be more sensitive to the problems of this transition. The adoption of a word signifies nothing.

 The issue of carrying on with a colonial baggage is evident in other spheres as well. It has come to light that the Indian army maintains detailed records of the caste- and community-wise composition of its ranks. The Indian army has always denied that it kept such records of its recruitment pattern. But the revelation is not entirely surprising since here, too, the Indian army is following colonial precedence. The British Indian army was not only recruited from selected castes and communities, it also took care to document the origins of its soldiers. It helped to construct stereotypes and to select castes and communities to reward them for their loyalty. It is clear that the Indian army has not abandoned this practice. The Indian army ? the symbol of Indian unity and its defender in times of threat ? actually recognizes the various fractures in Indian society and enshrines it in its records. All this would perhaps be unobjectionable if the army did not deny it and make a fanfare of ridding itself of its colonial heritage.

 When custom prevails over law

 CHILD MARRIAGE IN INDIA: SOCIO-LEGAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS DIMENSIONS By Jaya Sagade, Oxford, Rs 545

 The half-hearted reform of the Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929 by strengthening the law to prevent incidences of child marriage rather than abolishing such marriages altogether has revealed how customary law has prevailed over legislation in India. Sagades extremely topical research dwells on this lacuna in the CMRA from demographic, feminist, human rights and health perspectives. She shows that the CMRA is drafted in a way that pays lip service to the prevention of child marriage. Not only does this crime involve very mild punishment (either a fine or imprisonment up to 3 months), the marriage, once performed, remains valid. Since the Indian Majority Act, 1875, sets the age of majority at 18, anyone below that age cannot be considered as a consensual participant in marriage. The case for abolition of child marriage is further reinforced by the age of suffrage, set at 18, as also by the fact that the Indian Contract Act, 1872, recognizes the validity of contracts, which includes matrimony, in cases of persons who are at least 18 years old. This law is also not gender-neutral, setting different minimum ages of marriage for men and women, at 21 and 18 years respectively. Alongside analyses of jurisprudential questions, Sagade argues for a movement creating a legal culture, making the active agents sensitive to the consequences of child marriage, and furnishing meaningful alternatives to young girls.

 WOMEN IN THE INDIAN NATIONAL MOVEMENT: UNSEEN FACES AND UNHEARD VOICES 1930-42 By Suruchi Thapar-Bjrkert, Sage, Rs 650

 This book tells the story of the hundreds of women, forgotten by most historians, who participated in the Indian national movement at the local level. Instead of recounting the contributions of national leaders such as Sarojini Naidu, Vijaylakshmi Pandit, Sucheta Kripalani and Aruna Asaf Ali, it focuses on women like Raj Kumari Gupta of Kanpur, who worked with Gandhi and Chandra Shekhar Azad. She was also a part of the notorious Kakori Dacoity, in which she supplied revolvers hidden in her underwear. On being arrested, she was disowned by her in-laws. The history of politicization of the domestic sphere is constructed out of archival resources, oral narratives, poetry, cartoon, vernacular magazines and private correspondences, making this book a valuable addition to cultural and gender narratives of the struggle for independence.

 BEHIND THE MASK: THE CULTURAL DEFINITION OF THE LEGAL SUBJECT IN COLONIAL BENGAL (1715-1911) By Anindita Mukhopadhyay Oxford, Rs 595

 This book focuses on the transformation of legality from durbari to colonial culture, and how this change was perceived by the bhadralok the educated middle class and the chhotolok who formed the underprivileged classes. The courts and jails, dreaded by the ethically upright bhadralok, gave rise to a new cultural language of morality that delineated the parameters of bhadralok public behaviour. This put the underbelly of colonial society in a peculiar relationship with bureaucracy.

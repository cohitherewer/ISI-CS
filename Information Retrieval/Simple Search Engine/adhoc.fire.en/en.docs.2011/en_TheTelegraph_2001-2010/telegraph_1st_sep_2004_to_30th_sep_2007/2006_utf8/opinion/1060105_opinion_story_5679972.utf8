 JINGLE BELLS

 The telecom sector in this country is a shining example of what deregulation can achieve. Growth has been phenomenal. Competition has been intense and has resulted in India having the cheapest call rates in the world. While this has led to lower average revenue per user, that has been more than made up by the increase in the volume of calls. Consultancy firm Gartner says that at less that $8, India is the only country among China, Singapore and Australia to have a single-digit ARPU, while its mobile usage at 287 minutes per month is the highest among them. Not only has the consumer benefited, but telecom penetration has zoomed. Moreover, the business is expected to do so well that it is attracting substantial amounts of foreign investment. But perhaps the best example of what competition is capable of doing is Reliance Infocomm?s new tariff plan, which charges a flat Rs 1 rate for calls anywhere in the country. The plan does away with the distinction between STD and local calls. This ?One India? call rate is precisely what Mr Dayanidhi Maran had called for last August, and analysts had expected the minister?s declaration of the policy this month. Clearly, a private operator has beaten the minister to the announcement. It can be argued that the minister created the environment for the flat rate last November, when he slashed the national long distance entry fee from Rs 100 crore to Rs 2.5 crore and also reduced the annual licence fee.

 The obvious lesson is that, given the scale of competition in the sector, one of the things the government needs to do to further lower tariffs is reduce the burden it imposes on the industry. In fact, a finance ministry strategy paper on telecom services points out that at least 30 per cent of a customer?s telecom bill goes to the government directly or indirectly as taxes, fees and levies other than the access deficit charge. Similar fees in countries like China stand at around five per cent. It is difficult, therefore, to understand why the finance ministry has turned down the telecom regulatory authority of India?s proposal to further lower the licence fee and spectrum charges, especially when what will be lost in licence fees will eventually be made up in service taxes. It is to be hoped that the finance ministry is able to rise above its short-term revenue considerations.

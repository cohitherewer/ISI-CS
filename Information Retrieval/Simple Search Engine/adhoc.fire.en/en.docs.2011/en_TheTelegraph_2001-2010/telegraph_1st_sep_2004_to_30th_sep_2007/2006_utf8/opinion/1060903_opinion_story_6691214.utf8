 UNSPEAKABLE LOGIC

 There is a simple logic to their actions. And this logic is framed by an equally simple story of revenge. Renuka Kiran Shinde and Seema Mohan Gavit, already into petty theft, kidnapped a child for the first time because this child was born of their fathers union with the woman for whom he had left their mother. Then they realized that children would come in handy when going out to steal in public. People found it difficult to believe that a woman with a child could be a thief. So the women abducted many more little children, used them for this purpose, and then killed them brutally once they grew too old for the job. This went on for about six years during which the initial revenge motive was also kept alive. The sisters got caught when trying to kidnap their fathers second child with the other woman. Meanwhile, Renuka got married, enlisted her husband in her crimes, and had four children of her own. She has been, for all practical purposes, a good mother to them, setting aside a considerable sum from her earnings for their future. The sisters are now sentenced to death. They are the first women in independent India whom the courts and most Indians want to see hanged in spite of their being women. Moreover, the horrifying violence with which each child was killed informs the simple logic of the operations with an element of excess that is evidence of something altogether more unspeakable and inexplicable. For the courts, this inhumanity is beyond reform.

 It therefore feels absolutely just that the courts have made no concessions to the killers sex, whatever be ones views on capital punishment. Yet, motherhood is crucial to this familys criminal career. It is precisely that image of a woman with a child, and the sense of vulnerability and innocence automatically projected onto this image by a patriarchal society, that the women had exploited in their use of the abducted children. The clemency shown to women within the legal process, in some liberal societies, is perhaps a version of this same paternalism. Criminologists have shown that the British criminal justice system, for instance, responds very differently to men and women who kill children. Women are less likely to get prosecuted and tend to use psychiatric pleas to get non-custodial sentences, whereas men tend to use normal pleas and receive prison sentences. It is assumed that men are bad and normal, while women are mad and abnormal. In India, it is usually easier to find sociological determining factors behind infanticide by women. In most cases, these are mothers, often the poorest of the poor, getting rid of baby girls in violent desperation. The responsibility for such acts is far more difficult to work out within a purely criminal or punitive framework. With Renuka, Seema and their late mother, none of this seems to work. A society given to valorizing motherhood, or womens natural motherliness, would thus find theirs a bizarrely unsexing crime, calling for an appropriately unsexed judgment.

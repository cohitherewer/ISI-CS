The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Party time

 Sir ? The illegitimate use of public buses by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to ferry its cadre to political rallies is appalling, but it hardly comes as a surprise to the people of Bengal (?Buses for party, not people?, Jan 12). Democratic principles almost always take the backseat when the government is run by communists. The paraphernalia of a CPI(M) rally symbolizes the anarchy that has come to prevail here during the three decades of left rule. Using the government machinery or private enterprises for party purposes is an offence. What is more shocking is that private bus owners were forced to rent out buses at discounted rates and bear the financial burden of the show at Maidan. As for the people on the street, there was the farce of the transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, apologizing for the ?inconvenience? caused to the public. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The Telegraph should be thanked for speaking up for the Calcuttans, especially those whose lives were disrupted by the ?forced? withdrawal of almost all public transport from the city on January 8 by the ruling CPI(M). The villain of this piece is, predictably, the transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, who seems to believe that he has absolute right over the state transport corporation. In thinking so, he has the full support of the leaders of his political party who, and for very good reasons, give him a free run. It is for Chakraborty to mobilize resources ?cheaply? ? either by arm-twisting the private operators or by hiring out government buses at a discounted rate. He should be reminded that he has been authorized to preside over this department of the city to provide convenient transport for the public. However, Calcutta?s commuters are not an organized body, which makes it easy for parties to ride roughshod over their rights.

 Yours faithfully,

Subir Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report ?Buses for party, not people? makes it obvious that the taxes and duties paid by the public are not being utilized properly. The total loss incurred by the bus operators on the day of the rally was approximately Rs. 2.27 crores. Who is going to pay this bill? It is certainly not going to come from the party funds! The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seems to be concerned with the state?s development, but what happens when his own party breaks rules? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir ? The CPI(M) acted disgracefully by spending such a stupendous sum on its rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds. The leaders could have donated the amount spent to the district headquarters instead. It would have provided food to the starving, for whom the party seems so concerned. Pulling crowds from all over West Bengal to show its strength is a cheap pre-election gimmick.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The January 8 rally undoubtedly upheld a ?social cause? as it enabled people from remote districts in West Bengal to come to the Maidan for a picnic at public expense (?Have a party, hire a state bus?, Jan 13). Whenever there is a hike in fuel costs, private bus operators demand a fare hike, and our noble transport minister seconds their demand, sometimes even instigating them to agitate. Now we know why. A fuel price hike gives the transport minister an opportunity to compensate the private bus operators who are forced to let out their buses at nominal rates to accommodate party demands during rallies. Actually, it is the public who are made the scapegoat. They are forced to pay increased fares and put up with all the discomfort that a CPI(M) rally, and worse, rule, entail.

 Yours faithfully,

D. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Moral of the story

 Sir ? It is gratifying that the editorial, ?Sappho wasn?t Indian? (Jan 14), courageously defies Indian social mores in supporting love and marriage between two women or two men on the ground that the Indian Constitution guarantees every Indian citizen?s rights to equality, dignity and liberty. The viewpoint can also be justified in terms of the Indian cultural tradition of tolerance towards alternative sexuality. Ancient Indian textual history is convincing proof of that. Formation and rapid growth of homosexual organizations in many Indian cities in recent years, frank discussions about the issues related to homosexuality in the media and decreasing resistance to screening of movies with homosexual themes indicate a trend towards greater acceptance or tolerance of same sex love in India. But legal and social recognition of same sex marriage is more problematic because it requires radical changes in the long-standing perceptions and beliefs regarding marriage. This is why Western countries sympathetic towards same sex love tend to legally recognize same sex ?civil union? rather than marriage, where the rights and obligations of the partners are different. So it may be a better strategy for Indian activists to demand legal and social recognition of same sex ?civil union? rather than marriage.

 Yours faithfully,

Moni Nag, New York

 Sir ? Homosexuality and lesbianism are unnatural social behaviour. I do not agree with the editorial which says that the provision of equality, dignity and liberty under the Indian Constitution should not restrain Seeta and Vandana from making a manifest demonstration of their sexual orientation. If they are allowed to do so, how will we face our next generation?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

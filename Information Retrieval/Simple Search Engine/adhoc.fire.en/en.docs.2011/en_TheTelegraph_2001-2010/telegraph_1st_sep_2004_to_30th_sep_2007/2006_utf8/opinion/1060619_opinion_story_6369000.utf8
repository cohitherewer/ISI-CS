 MANY A SLIP

 There is an old joke that defines mixed feelings as seeing one?s mother-in-law driving one?s new BMW over a cliff. In India, the joke can be rewritten to say that mixed feelings is watching a highly accomplished mandarin being thrown in to fight an election whose outcome may not necessarily be favourable to him. Few can doubt Mr Shashi Tharoor?s diplomatic and bureaucratic credentials. In his generation, he is the mandarin par excellence. After being in the United Nations for more than two decades, he is currently the under-secretary (communications) in the UN. Apart from the laurels he has earned in his professional life, he is an accomplished writer. His curriculum vitae makes him an excellent candidate for the post of UN secretary-general that falls vacant when Mr Kofi Annan relinquishes it. The government of India has already declared its intention to propose Mr Tharoor?s candidature. Every Indian will want Mr Tharoor to get one of the most important jobs in the world, but there are certain critical factors that lace the optimism and the hope.

 The most important factor is the uncertainty of the outcome. Mr Tharoor is arguably the best candidate but the best candidate does not always win, especially an election that will see an enormous amount of lobbying, factionalism and even intrigue. The election will become a microcosm for global turf battles. There is already the announcement, not entirely unexpected, that Pakistan will field a candidate to counter India?s move to sponsor Mr Tharoor. A candidate from Thailand is already in the ring. Others may be hovering in the wings. The matter is open and uncertain, and given this, the announcement of India?s support to Mr Tharoor may have been somewhat premature. It would have been wise to have waited till the intentions of the big players are better known. It is a UN convention that the post of secretary-general always goes to one of the ?smaller? countries of the world. And this will weigh against Mr Tharoor too. The job of the secretary-general has become more political than bureaucratic. Mr Tharoor, given his experience as a bureaucrat, may well find the political hat to be a crown of thorns. There could be nothing better if he were to win. But the government of India should ensure that he goes in with a fair chance and that the support for him is unequivocal.

 NET GAINS

 Political rivalries in India often blur the distinction between politics and governance. The most significant point about the all-party meeting on the Tata groups proposed automobile project at Singur is that it sought to bring the focus back on governance. Whether the meeting was a success from Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees point of view or a failure from the oppositions angle is only incidental to this main issue. Democratic politics is all about divergent views and strategies. Dissent too is integral to democracy. But good governance requires the government and the opposition parties to share ideas as well as concerns in a spirit of mutual accommodation. Ideologies can be irreconcilable, but governments are run more on practical wisdom than on ideologies. It is not necessary that the chief minister and the opposition leaders will see eye to eye on any particular issue. But that is no reason for the government to ignore the opposition or for the latter to keep away from dialogues. Whether the governments original plan for the acquisition of land at Singur changed a little as a result of Wednesdays meeting may be of some importance. But more important is the fact that the two sides sat together to discuss an issue that is crucial to the future of Bengals economy.

 The Trinamul Congresss decision to stay away from the meeting is a throwback to Bengals legacy of confrontational politics. Ms Mamata Banerjee obviously believes that street politics is the only option available to the opposition. She thus equates the government with the Marxist party. Ironically, this had long been the political strategy of the Marxists themselves who wanted to settle all issues of governance on the street. Even after the Left Front came to power, it did not quite overcome its suspicion of the opposition. That was no way for a government to win the oppositions confidence. Worse, it was a sure recipe for reducing governance to a partisan affair. Thus, even when the government went through the motions of all-party meetings on major issues, these always acquired unnecessary political overtones. One hopes that Mr Bhattacharjees initiative over the Singur project is not an isolated attempt. It is for him to convince the opposition that he really wants to keep politics out of governance. If he succeeds, he could usher in a new political culture in which dialogues prevail over street shows.

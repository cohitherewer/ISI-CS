 GUSH AND GLUT

 The Reserve Bank of Indias mid-term review of monetary policy on October 31 contained several warnings about the possibility of an overheating economy. At the time, the Central bank had pointed out that if demand is running ahead of full capacity, there is a case for tightening of monetary policy with a view to slowing down the economy and heading off overheating. Since then, inflation according to the wholesale price index has come perilously close to the Reserve Bank of Indias upper limit of 5.5 per cent. The rise in the consumer price indices has been even sharper, with the year-on-year rise in the consumer price index for industrial workers at 7.3 per cent in October. It could be argued that much of the price rise stems from the shortfall in foodgrain and pulses, and prices will come down with imports and as the winter crop comes in. But demand pressures too cannot be ignored. 

 Second quarter growth in gross domestic product has been a very robust 9.2 per cent. Non-food bank credit continues to increase by 30 per cent. More importantly, the RBI says that there are reports of growing strains on domestic capacity utilization. There are also reports that expansion of capacity is underway but the realization could be constrained over the next two years. In other words, while demand is rising, the supply is unlikely to catch up soon, which will lead to rising prices. The current-account deficit has moved up sharply in October. Real estate prices have shot up. Occupancy costs for prime commercial space in Mumbai have risen between 75 per cent and 100 per cent in the past year. Mumbai is now the worlds 7th most expensive business location, up from 15th last year. Another recent survey showed that India had the highest average salary increase in the Asia-Pacific region this year and that similar increases are expected for 2007 as well.

 To these fundamental factors add the gush of liquidity. Foreign investors have been pouring money into the stock markets, and the Central bank has been mopping up dollars in its effort to keep the rupee from appreciating too rapidly. Since the RBI releases rupees into the system when it mops up dollars, the result has been a glut of liquidity in the money markets. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond fell over a hundred basis points from its mid-July peak. Money-supply growth has been well above the growth in nominal GDP. In short, the stage had been set for a rise in inflation and the Central bank has done well to hike the cash reserve ratio and suck out some of the liquidity. If, in the process, some of the irrational exuberance in the stock market is also squeezed out, so much the better.

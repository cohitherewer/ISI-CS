 EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT PREVENTION

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Strides towards functional integration of labour and factory inspectorates can be noted in an increasing number of English-speaking African countries, starting with South Africa, which has introduced the concept of a one-stop-service, Nigeria, Eritrea, Kenya, Mauritius and others.These functional mergers have as their ?leitmotiv? not only the drive for greater efficiency (i.e. rationalization, cost-reduction, avoidance of duplication and overlap), but rather that of greater effectiveness, mainly to establish, develop and strengthen the system?s capacity for prevention. It is difficult to imagine how prevention can be efficiently and effectively organized if, for instance, occupational safety and occupational health (hygiene) enforcement remain the responsibility of different inspectorates, organized in different, unrelated and usually noncooperating field services, under the administrative responsibility of separate directorates, answerable to different government ministries with different, often opposite political priorities. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the dichotomy between labour and factory inspection. Conversely, merging, for instance, employment functions with other labour inspection responsibilities has clearly strengthened overall inspection performance, first quantitatively and then, with proper training and new enforcement policies, also qualitatively, and reinforced these systems? prevention capacity.

 Finally, the merger of occupational safety and health inspection and workmen?s compensation insurance functions, for instance in Australia and New Zealand, has led to the creation of strong, prevention-oriented organizations with access to a single enterprise-level data base, and all information on occupational accidents and diseases, thus capable of closely monitoring labour protection performance in different undertakings and sectors, enabling inspectorates to better set priorities for intervention in areas where enforcement is most necessary, and thus considerably optimizing available (but always scarce) resources with a view to ensuring significantly greater impact.

 Conditions for effective labour inspection: ILO Convention No. 81 provides the essential benchmarks: labour inspection should be organized as a system (Article 1) applying to all workplaces in respect of which legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers are enforceable (Article 2); it should cover a basic set of functions, such as hours of work, wages, safety, health and welfare, the employment of children and young persons, and other connected matters (Article 3.1).

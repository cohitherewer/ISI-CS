 MAKING GLOBALIZATION WORK 

 By Joseph E. Stiglitz, 

 Allen Lane, Rs 595

 It is said that those who are the most deeply committed to an idea or a cause are often the most critical of it. Joseph Stiglitz is currently the best example of the type. Men like Stiglitz fear the hijacking of what they hold dear by time-servers and the corrupt, who use the cause as a faade to push their own interests. However, they also fear the fanatic, whose radical advocacy of the idea or the cause does more harm than good. Stiglitzs Globalization and its Discontents (2002), demonstrated how the International Monetary Fund upheld the concerns of the United States of America above those of the poor nations it should have actually helped. He opened the Wests eyes to the reasons behind the hostility that globalization faces from many quarters. One factor that had made Stiglitz a hero and his book a bestseller was his identity of having once belonged to the establishment. 

 In Making Globalization Work, Stiglitz has had the good sense to spare fewer words on Wall Street Machiavellis and more on economics and the environment. His middle-of-the-road approach is clearly summed up in a sentence from the preface: Economic success requires getting the balance right between the government and the market. His most scathing attack is against economic conservatives who refuse to acknowledge that economics is not all about efficiency and that the problem of equity cannot be left to politics alone. The contrast between the success of East Asia in exploiting globalization without being exploited by it (except for the late Nineties crisis), and the devastation of Latin America, thanks to its acceptance of the Washington Consensus policies, tells the story of the two faces of globalization. The recent turn of political events in South America is in fact a refutation of the unbridled endorsement of the market there made by the likes of Milton Friedman, although Stiglitz does not mention him in the context.

 But the 2004 World Economic Forum had marked the shift in views as many participants questioned the efficacy of globalization. This was a progress from the Nineties when the talk was only about the virtues of opening up international markets. The developed world could at last be made to talk about poverty reduction and fairer trade conditions. However, Stiglitzs optimism for the future is suspect, given especially his self-righteous tone and the confidence he places in his own book to enlighten policy-makers.

 The international community has identified six areas that need immediate attention and that demand a thorough reformation of globalization poverty, debt relief, fair trade, limitations of liberalization, the environment and global governance. Aware of the benefits of globalization for poor and rich nations alike, and the ways to ensure it minus recessions, job cuts, instability and environmental hazards, Stiglitz preaches saving globalization from its advocates, primarily the IMF and the World Bank. Just as human development is not inevitable after globalization, its lack does not call for abandoning the same.

 This important book suffers from a simplistic reductionism that often eclipses the authors sane advice. Nor is Stiglitz very accurate in analysing 20th-century global political history although he understands better than most how politics has strangulated globalization. But he does provide the ground where right and left must meet and work for everybodys good.

 Another world may, after all, be possible.

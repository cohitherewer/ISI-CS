 PARTY AND GOVERNMENT

 One of the imperceptible threats to democracy in India is the gradual but unmistakable blurring of the division between the government and the party. At first sight, the separation of the two appears to be self-evident. But in practice, the infringement of the party on the functioning of the government occurs frequently. The latest example of this kind of trespass comes from the public utterances of Ms Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president. She said that she had serious doubts about the governments policy regarding special economic zones. Her doubts, not surprisingly, were shared by other party members, and so she thought it was her duty as Congress president to articulate such scepticism to the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh. Nobody can deny that Ms Gandhi and other Congressmen have the right to have reservations about the SEZ policy of the government. But it is equally true that government policy on any issue cannot be dictated and determined by the priorities of a political party. Mr Singh is the prime minister of India, Ms Gandhi is the president of the Congress. There is a difference, a very critical difference. Mr Singh has to think and one hopes he does about the whole of India and what will take it forward. Ms Gandhi has to think only of her party and to take it forward that is, how it will garner a larger share of the electoral pie.

 The complacent manner of Ms Gandhis statement seems to suggest that she does not see anything radically wrong in this intrusion of the party into the affairs of the State and of the government. This is an ominous sign for the system. The fact that other political formations the left in West Bengal, for example permit such infringements of the party cannot take away from the dangers embedded in it. The vested interests of a political party are not the ideal place from which to take policy decision. More importantly, the system of governance and the mode of decision-making should remain autonomous from the party. A prime minister of India, and members of his cabinet, cease to be members of a political party. They become dedicated to the greater good and development of the country. If policies that further this aim run counter to the ideological positions of their party, they should adhere to the policy and not the party.

 The prime minister, by virtue of holding the most important job in the country, is the leader of India. He is not a follower of the party to which he belongs. He should put his imprint on government policy and not his partys seal of approval. Ms Gandhi should appreciate this since Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi functioned in the manner that befits a leader. The party followed where the leaders led. Ms Gandhi seems approving not only of the collapsing of the party and the government but also of vacating the role that a leader plays in making a nation. She should also decide if she herself is a leader or a follower of the Congress.

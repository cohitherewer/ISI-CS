The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Should we call it generation gap? The chief of the women?s cricket association of UP, Siraj Mehndi, cannot stop asking, ?Yeh google woogle kya hai??, ever since he spoke to Rahul Gandhi?s office on the telephone about whether the Nehru-Gandhi would see him. Mehndi, having sought an appointment with Rahul days back, had called merely to inquire on the issue. What greeted him was a volley of very refined English, in which the only word he could grasp was ?Google?. Apparently the chief had informed the Lucknow media that the young Gandhi would be the chief guest in a women?s cricket match without bothering to take the consent of the MP. Rahul?s office had picked up the information from the Google search engine. Accosted, Mehndi immediately denied the charge, only to be told to look up Google himself. And that truly unsettled Mehndi. Well, now that Rahul has marked out UP as his field of action, shouldn?t he start off by giving a crash course to his partymen on internet browsing? And perhaps a spoken-English course too to the Congresswallahs who are preparing to take over the great dustlands of UP?

 The hero in Karnataka?s evil hour is obviously not HD Kumaraswamy, who brought on the deluge, but TN Chaturvedi, the state governor. When the political drama began to unfold, hawkish Congress leaders began whispering into Sonia Gandhi?s ears about how her apolitical Manmohan had goofed up by retaining the likes of Chaturvedi. A more enterprising minister even recalled how the good doctor had described Chaturvedi as a ?good friend?. The former comptroller and auditor general?s associations with the BJP were known and it was taken for granted that the Congress would get a raw deal. Unfortunately, for the fogeys, Chaturvedi granted Dharam Singh time no one had anticipated. The turbaned one has been smiling since then, but perhaps not for long.

 Nitish Kumar has been hard at work in Bihar and he recently assigned an important task to each member of his council of ministers ? they were to drive out mosquitoes from their respective districts. Initially, they all laughed at the proposition, repeating a Hindi saying which suggested there was no work. A week later, however, the laughter had faded. The mosquitoes are still humming away and the ministers realize that even killing flies could be one hell of a job.

 Why was the RSP leader and Rajya Sabha MP, the firebrand Abani Roy, absent from the crucial coordination committee meeting of the Congress and the left to decide on the privatization of airports? That is because he was not informed of the meeting in time. He was apparently out of Delhi and got the summon only on the evening of January 11 for the meeting next day, and by that time it was too late to reach the capital. The buzz is that it was a deliberate ploy on part of the bigwigs attending the meeting who suspected that Roy, a rigid opponent of the privatization bid, would be shooting his mouth as usual, giving precious information to his friends in the media. But can they keep him out forever?

 The 7/7 seems to have had little impact on Muslims living in the UK, that is if Birmingham?s instance is anything to go by. The west Midland town is already being referred to as ?Birminghamsharief?. This incredible name is proof of the growing influence of the Barelvi sect among the local Muslim population. The death of a prominent Barelvi leader was followed by the construction of a shrine. An annual urs began and now that the city has become reasonably holy, its said to have got the status of a sharief.

 Rajnath Singh obviously is not helping matters for the BJP. The middle rung leadership continues to be sore over the coronation, and intent on showing up Singh in poor light. When the Bofors issue resurfaced, Singh was found missing from the limelight, even from the party protest in which he was supposed to take the lead, according to Arun Jaitley. But Jaitley hadn?t consulted Singh about whether he would be available, and when questioned, Jaitley merely said that Singh was preoccupied with ?Operation Dharma?. 

 Then there is the redoubtable Sushma Swaraj, who seems to have gone on a perpetual sulk. She has refused a post under Singh and voices her displeasure about the party every now and then, for example over Varun Gandhi being too young to be made a gen-sec. Grapes are really sour, aren?t they?

 Arundhati Roy has competition. She is not the only one to have the pleasure of rejecting government bounty. We have to say that unlike the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, which distributed Padma awards like Diwali sweets, the Manmohan Singh government has been more serious about its benefaction. It is to the credit of the prime minister that he personally recommended two of the most distinguished media personalities for the Padma awards this Republic Day. As per protocol, both TN Ninan, editor-in-chief of a prestigious daily, and Prannoy Roy, founder-editor of the NDTV group of television channels, were sounded out about their names being included in the final list of awardees. But both seem to have politely, but firmly, refused. They obviously don?t need the crutch of the Padma to command respect in their social and professional spheres. And probably worse, be identified as UPA favourites.

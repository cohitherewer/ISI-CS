 Letters to Editor

 No man?s land

 Sir ? It is heartening to see the efforts of the government of West Bengal to improve the industrial scenario of the state (?Village protest Tata visit? May 26). But development that does not consider the interests of the people at whose cost it takes place, can hardly be called so. The village of Singur has been chosen by the Tatas as the site of the proposed small-car project. But the 1,000 acres that the Tatas would need to put up their plant also happens to be a fertile agricultural tract. Offering an attractive compensation to the farmers in exchange for their land is not a feasible solution. The loss of valuable agricultural land cannot be compensated with money. The Tatas should have chosen their site in districts like Bankura, Birbhum or Purulia where the land is not ideal for cultivation. It is surprising that the state government endorsed the site chosen by the investors in a hurry without carrying out a detailed survey. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.C. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? Being a primarily agrarian society, a sizeable portion of Indians still depends directly on farming for a living. Since West Bengal can boast of being one of the most fertile states in the country, the government should work to upgrade its agricultural sector rather than replace invaluable agricultural land with industrial units. Indiscriminate allotment of fertile lands to realtors has already resulted in ecological degradation, with the wetlands, ponds and other water bodies being filled up to make way for multistoreyed buildings. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has done enough towards the industrialization of the state during his first tenure in office. It is time that he focuses on modernizing farming instead. Or, he might try to revive the industries that were closed down during the regime of his predecessor, Jyoti Basu. This will not only save the lands, but also generate employment.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The protest by the villagers of Singur is a spontaneous outburst of the people?s apprehension and outrage (?CM seeks Singur connect?, May 29). The history of industrialization is replete with instances of farmers and small landholders being ousted from their lands and falling victim to official high-handedness, inadequate compensation, and eventually, poverty. The compensation promised by the government to placate the distraught farmers is a myth, because there can never be a true valuation of land in the sense that it is difficult to set a value to what it can produce in future.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? If large industrial units are set up in Singur on the proposed site by Tata Motors, then in no time they will swallow the adjacent agricultural lands. The farmers and small landowners will be compelled to sell off their plots on the terms set by the buyers. And if the investors close the factories down one day, then thousands of jobless men will be added to the list of the landless population created by the so-called industries.

 Yours faithfully,

Shibaprasad Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? The protests by the farmers in Singur indicate that the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had not consulted them before promising away their lands for the Tata Motors plant. Bhattacharjee loudly declares communist China to be the inspiration behind his much-hyped industrial reform policy. The leftist government?s unfair treatment of farmers, who have perhaps been loyal voters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), does remind one of the illegal occupants of Tibet and the perpetrators of the Tiananmen Square firing on students.

 Yours faithfully,

Dev Gupta, Scottsdale, US

 Sir ? The incident at Singur has all the trappings of an anti-poor policy. One despairs to think that an uncertain future has been gifted to the farmers by a government led by the CPI(M), the party that professes to stand up for the marginalized and the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

Vijaya Rao Veerla, Nottingham, UK

 Sir ? What will happen to the farmers of Singur once the money promised to them as compensation for their land runs out? Lands form long-term assets and cannot be replaced by money. Besides, the farmers? lives centre around the land they till and reap. Dispossessing them will put an end to a particular way of life. And no amount of money can give that back to the farmers.

 Yours faithfully, 

Nupur Bose, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Mahesh Rangarajan may feel that ?the announcement of the Tata small-car project is the best evidence yet of the industrial renaissance of West Bengal? (?Mark the details?, May 18), but I would like to point out to him that there are at least six car-manufacturing companies that have come up in India during the last 30 years, not one of them in Bengal. Evidently renaissance came to the other states much before us. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

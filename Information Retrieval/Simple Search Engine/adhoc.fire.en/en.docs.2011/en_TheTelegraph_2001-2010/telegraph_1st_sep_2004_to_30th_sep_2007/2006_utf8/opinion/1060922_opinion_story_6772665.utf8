Paperback Pickings

Too many slips, and showing

Tagore Tales (Projapoti, Rs 150) contains 

one novella and ten of Rabindranath Tagores most popular short stories. But the 

translations can only sadden those who had welcomed the expiry of copyright on 

Tagores works. The translation of Nashtanir as Fouled Nest would suffice 

to illustrate the point. If morning shows the day, then a look at the preface 

would be advised. Here the translator, Carolyn B. Brown (who has done the job 

with Sharat Kumar Mukhopadhyay), talks about audiences being drawn back 

to Tagore by new creations such as Sunil Gangopadhyays Ranu o Bhanu, Rituparno 

Ghoshs Chokher Bali, or the television series, Tarpar Rabindranath, 

which tried to visualize the life of some of Tagores filmed heroines 25 years 

after their fictional time. One doesnt quite know who to feel sorrier for the 

audience, or Brown herself. The book is a compendium of carelessness and ignorance, 

with Mussalmanir Galpo being referred to as Mussalmani Galpo, Brahmadaitya 

(in the context of the Brahmo-elite professor Bamacharan) in Professor being 

explained as the Brahmin giant. The preface also mentions Hemsashi in Sentence 

as an example of a recurring figure [in Tagores stories], a woman at the window, 

often sitting in the dark. But there is no character by that name in Sentence 

or Shasti.

The Power of N (Rupa, Rs 195) by 

Meeta Lall attempts to respond to the problem of our increasingly sedentary 

lifestyle and dangerous food habits. Growing affluence has affected our patterns 

of eating, both at home and at work. And so Lall suggests several nutrition patterns 

for men, women and children, using food guide pyramids and specifying portion 

sizes. Sections are devoted to nutrition needs of pregnant women, travelling as 

well as desk-bound professionals.

Civil Disobedience Movements in India amp; Indias 

Case for Freedom (Frog, Rs 250) by C.V.H. Rao records the history 

of the various satyagraha movements conducted under the guidance of Mahatma 

Gandhi and auspices of the Congress and also tries to appreciate the results 

and fruits thereof. Rao is under no illusion about the movements being run on 

the steam of high ideals. His analysis of Indias freedom movement in the context 

of international developments, such as the Atlantic Charter, Monroe doctrine and 

World War II is useful.

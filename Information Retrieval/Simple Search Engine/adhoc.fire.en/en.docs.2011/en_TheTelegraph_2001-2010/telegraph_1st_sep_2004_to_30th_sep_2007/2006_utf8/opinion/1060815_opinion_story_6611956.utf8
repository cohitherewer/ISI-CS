 ENERGY FOR DEVELOPMENT

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 While the current outlook for nuclear power remains mixed, 2005 was a year of rising expectations. In March, high-level representatives of 74 governments, including 25 at the ministerial level, gathered in Paris...to consider the future role of nuclear power. The vast majority of participants affirmed that nuclear power can make a major contribution to meeting energy needs and sustaining the worlds development in the 21st century for both developed and developing countries. 

 There were 441 nuclear power plants in operation as of 31 December 2005 and 27 under construction. Four new NPPs were connected to the grid in 2005 (two in Japan and one each in India and the Republic of Korea), and one laid-up plant was reconnected in Canada. There were two NPP retirements, both in accordance with national nuclear phase-out policies the Obrigheim reactor in Germany, and Barsebck-2 in Sweden. There were three construction starts, Lingao-3 in China, Olkiluoto-3 in Finland and Chasnupp-2 in Pakistan. Olkiluoto-3 is the first new construction in western Europe since 1991. Asia remains the centre of expansion, accounting for 16 of the 27 reactors under construction at the end of 2005, and for 24 of the last 34 reactors to have been connected to the grid.

 Uranium prices, which had been low and stable for the previous decade and a half, continued their climb from $25/kg in 2002 to $112/kg in May 2006. Uranium production has been well below consumption for about 15 years, and the current price increase reflects the growing perception that secondary sources, which have covered the difference, are becoming exhausted.

 As of the end of 2005, eight plants had been completely decommissioned, with the sites released for unconditional use. Seventeen had been partially dismantled and safely enclosed, 31 were being dismantled prior to eventual site release, and 30 were undergoing minimum dismantling prior to long-term enclosure.

 Progress on disposal facilities for high-level waste is most advanced in Finland, Sweden and the USA. In 2005 Hungary and the Republic of Korea selected sites for their first repositories for low level and intermediate level radioactive waste,...and in Belgium two communities voted to become candidate sites for a low level waste repository.

 National research on advanced reactor designs continues for all reactor categories water cooled, gas cooled, liquid metal cooled, and hybrid systems. Five members of the Generation IV International Forum signed a framework agreement on international collaboration in research and development on Generation IV nuclear energy systems in February 2005. The IAEAs International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles grew to 24 members, with the addition in 2005 of Ukraine and the US. Current INPRO activities include completion of a user manual on the INPRO methodology, application of the methodology to assessing innovative nuclear energy systems, analyses of the role and structure of INSs in meeting energy demands, and selection of the most suitable areas for collaborative development.

 A major advance in fusion energy occurred in June 2005 with the signing of the joint declaration of all parties to the negotiations on the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor and the agreement to start construction at Cadarache, France. This decision signalled an important new stage in the development of fusion energy.

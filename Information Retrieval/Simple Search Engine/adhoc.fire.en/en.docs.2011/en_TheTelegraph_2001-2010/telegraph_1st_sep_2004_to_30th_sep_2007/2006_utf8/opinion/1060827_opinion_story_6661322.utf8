The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 The latest edition of parliaments Whos Who is out. And it is as good a reading as a collectors edition of Punch. For one, there is a mile-long list of the professions of our MPs. Guess which noble profession connects Atal Bihari Vajpayee, LK Advani, Pranab Mukherjee and George Fernandes? Why, they are all journalists, of course. (The capitals press-club veterans must be wondering why they are not seen more often inside the premises.) Arjun Singh, Ahmad Patel, Sharad Pawar, Sachin Pilot, Mohammed Shahabuddin, Pappu Yadav, Jitin Prasad are all farmers. (That should explain the existence of quite a few farm-houses.) Rahul Gandhi has chosen to describe himself as a consultant (sure, Mama Sonia will vouch for that), while aunt Maneka is an author (how modest of her not to have included television presenter too!). Lalu Prasad Yadav, in case you had any doubts, is a lawyer (where else could he use his gift of the gab better?). If these are revealing, heres more. Shahabuddin loves to promote higher education and excellence (inside the jail, or outside it, one wonders), while Jaswant Singhs hobby is to dissuade people from drinking. But George Fernandes takes the cake. With ravishing modesty, he describes himself as a pacifist whose sole interest is to oppose the nuclear bomb. Is JP turning in his grave?

 In this high-flying circle of professionals, it is understandable if the prime minister feels a little awkward. But that does not mean he will give up quoting Machiavelli or economists he admires. This is exactly what he did while replying to the debate on the Indo-US nuclear deal in the Rajya Sabha. What he should have known is that there arent too many in the hallowed circular building who can digest Signor Niccolo and TT Krishnamachari, all in a days work. Vijaypal Singh, the BJP MP from Bhilwara, questioned Manmohan Singhs preference for Machiavelli over home-bred Kautilya, and surmised that it must have something to do with the Prince-authors Italian origin. Once the Italian connection barb was in place, Vijaypal Singh mentioned that it was Machiavellis endorsement of deceit and fraud in statecraft in the land of Gandhi? Ram, Ram! and TTKs involvement in a corruption case that his objection was all about. Fair enough. But why talk about Italy and Italians when you have a sound argument to offer?

 On Janmashtami, when devotees around the country were worshipping the lady-killer god, Krishna, defence minister, Pranab Mukherjee, found himself in the company of a different set of ladies. They belonged to the Women Press Corps. Pranabda, thanks to his Calcutta connection, can be the life of informal addas. And that is what he soon became, regaling the women scribes with anecdotes and tales from the Indira era. Next day, however, he was greeted with knowing smiles in the Central Hall of parliament. Soon, cabinet colleagues were ribbing him about playing Kishan Kanhaiya on Janmashtami. For once, Pranabda did not have a ready wisecrack, and was even caught blushing.

 Whoever said that behind every successful man is a woman must have been thinking of Sadhna Singh. The wife of Madhya Pradesh chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, is an able home minister if the discipline in Shyamala Hills, the chief ministerial residence in Bhopal, is anything to go by. In that bungalow, with its usual quota of security paraphernalia, Ms CM has introduced an attendance register, where all the employees have to write their check-in and check-out time. Some employees are known to be a little unhappy about an extra-constitutional authority monitoring their movements. But in the CMs house, Madame CM is the boss. Shall we ask Rabri Devi?

 Yet another ugly fight to get close to the Madam of 10 Janpath. During Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary celebrations, Jagdish Sharma, a Congress worker loyal to the Delhi CM, Sheila Dikshit, had put up hoardings all over Veer Bhoomi, with pictures of Rajiv and Sonia Gandhi, and Dikshit. But there was a small problem. The late prime ministers samadhi fell under the purview of the urban development ministry, and the minister of state for urban development, Ajay Maken, has little love lost for the Delhi CM. In a fit of anger, the young and restless Maken was about to ask one of his subordinates to pull all of them down...till someone pointed out that tearing down pictures of the late leader and the current party president might not go down well with 10 Janpath. And so Maken decided to reign in his ambition this one time. Better luck next time, may we offer?

 Now that the monsoon session is finally over, and the prime minister has hinted at the possibility of some cabinet vacancies being filled, action is hotting up ahead of the Delhi winter. The most talked about candidate is Jairam Ramesh, currently the minister of state for commerce and industry. He has been receiving congratulatory messages and calls ever since Uttaranchal chief minister, Narain Dutt Tiwari, predicted at a function that Ramesh would soon succeed P. Chidambaram in the North Block. At Rameshs embarrassed protestations, Tiwari added that with a mind that worked like a computer, Ramesh was cut out for a bigger role at the Centre. With several other hopefuls lurking in and around 24 Akbar Road, those close to the minister have advised him to lie low, rather than bask in the glory of ol man Tiwaris comment. After all, our politicians are like crabs in a can. When one tries to climb up, there are always others waiting to pull him down.

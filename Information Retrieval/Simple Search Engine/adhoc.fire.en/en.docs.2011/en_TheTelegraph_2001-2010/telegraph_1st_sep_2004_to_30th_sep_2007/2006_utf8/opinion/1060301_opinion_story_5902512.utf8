The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 The hidden message

 Sir ? It is mindboggling that 3 crore votes were polled through telephones and SMSs from eastern India alone in a recently concluded music competition (?East tilts balance in Silchar boy?s favour?, Feb 25). The North-east, put together, has less than a 4 crore population, and most of it is underdeveloped, with poor telecom facilities. So the bulk of the messages must have been sent in thousands by a few. What is the credibility of such opinion polls? The online betting prompted by cricket matches is worse since the data in all probability is used for match-fixing. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Partho Roy, 

 Calcutta

 Road back to hell 

 Sir ? The sanction given by the left-run Calcutta corporation to hawkers to permanently station themselves on the city?s footpaths is yet another example of how blatantly the administrative machinery is being used to garner votes for the party (?So long sunshine, hello hawkers?, Feb 23). Calcuttans had voted the mayor to power to look after their benefits, conveniences, and above all, their safety. But the mayor has violated that trust. If hawkers are allowed to permanently encroach on footpaths, pedestrians will be forced to walk on the roads and risk their lives. Any sensible administration would have found a more practical solution to the problem and given thought to public safety.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asit Kumar Mitra,

 Calcutta 

 Sir ? The decision of the Calcutta 

 mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, to allow hawkers to return 

 to the city?s streets is a great setback for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, 

 who is trying to change the image of the city. The corporation 

 decision also proves that the chief minister has little 

 control over his party, which may go against his policies. 

 This will send negative messages to prospective investors. 

 But those worst-hit by this decision are the citizens of 

 Calcutta. In spite of paying their taxes for civic services, 

 they are being deprived of the freedom to walk freely on 

 the pavements. Given the forthcoming assembly elections, 

 there is little chance of the mayor reconsidering his decision. 

 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) would not like to 

 tarnish its pro-poor image. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Shameek Bose,

 Calcutta 

 Sir ? Hawkers occupy Calcutta?s 

 roads because of the government?s inability to give them 

 suitable employment or a permanent establishment elsewhere. 

 The civic body?s decision is a cover-up for this inefficiency 

 before the elections. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.K. Das,

 Calcutta 

 Sir ? The official announcement to end Operation Sunshine 

 will give a new lease of life to many poor hawkers who have 

 continued with their trade under severe pressure from different 

 levels in the last few years. Only days back, the same political 

 party had worked fiercely to free Calcutta?s pavements from 

 the hawker menace which it is now welcoming back. Instead 

 of using the hawkers to suit its interests, the party should 

 take some steps to resettle them so that they can run their 

 trade without interference. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Payel Bhattacharyya,

 Calcutta

 Sir ? Is there any guarantee that 

 hawkers will restrict themselves to only a third of the 

 road as promised and not spill over to adjacent areas? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 H.P. Mitra,

 Calcutta

 Sir ? The pavements are not meant for carrying out commerce. Several statutes are being violated, including those of hygiene (chickens are slaughtered and fish sold in the open). This city deserves better than vote-grabbing tactics.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Avijit Chatterjee,

 Calcutta

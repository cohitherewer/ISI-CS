The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

Life in the wild 

 EYE IN THE JUNGLE (Universities Press, Rs 1,500) is a breathtakingly 

beautiful collection of naturalist M. Krishnan?s wildlife photographs and writings, 

brought together painstakingly by Ashish and Shanthi Chandola with the aid of 

Krishnan acolyte, T.N.A. Perumal. Reproduced exactly in Krishnan?s way, the captions 

to the masterly black-and-white pictures shot in his ?Superponderosa? capture 

the verve, enthusiasm and commitment that Krishnan brought to his recordings of 

life in the wild. Take the ?Elephant children? (picture), which describes the 

antics of a bull calf trying to cross over a huge log which babies of his size 

had steadfastly avoided. The calf first tried to heave himself over, but could 

not get even his front legs on top of the wood. Then he fell back with a resounding 

thud. Eventually, to Krishnan?s surprise, he succeeded in the third attempt, and 

probably became his hero.

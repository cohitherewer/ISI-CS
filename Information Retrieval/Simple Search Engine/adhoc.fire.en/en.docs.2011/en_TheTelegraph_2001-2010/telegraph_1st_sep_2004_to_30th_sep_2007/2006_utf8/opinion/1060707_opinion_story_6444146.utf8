 OPTING OUT

 India has walked out of the Doha talks. At least, that is the way the commerce minister, Mr Kamal Nath, has sought to project the decision domestically. Had it been a question of India being the sole dissenter, this would not have been a credible threat. However, unlike the Uruguay Round (1986-94) and the Doha ministerial conference in 2001, India is not the lone ranger, and that makes the threat credible. The decision is implicitly supported by the G-20 coalition on agriculture (China, Brazil, India and South Africa being the core group) and the G-33 agriculture group, that wishes protection against import threats and NAMA-11. Not only that, the sense of injustice at developed-country inflexibilities also finds resonance in other developing countries, least developed countries and cotton producers in Africa, not to speak of support from assorted NGOs. Since the Cancun ministerial conference in 2001, India?s negotiating skills have improved, aided by greater economic clout courtesy liberalization. Ostensibly, the failure is due to the deadlock over non-agricultural market access and agriculture, especially the latter, the June 22 drafts having failed to break the impasse even in the subsequent Geneva meeting. While there are differences within NAMA on several counts, the core problem is one of relative commitment burdens by developing countries compared to developed ones, the formula divide being one symptom.

 But this could have been resolved, had it not been for agriculture. And countries like Brazil and India might have been able to salvage the Doha work programme had they accepted NAMA commitments and diluted demands on agriculture. By not agreeing to do so, the developed country bluff has been called. This is because on agriculture, developed country offers on subsidies (domestic and export) are not good enough, and market access, without disciplining subsidies that distort markets, is a non sequitur. This is not the end of the World Trade Organization, since earlier rounds went through similar hiccups. The DWP has now been knocked back to whenever the European Union, particularly France, can contemplate agriculture reform, perhaps 2013. Beyond immediate bravado, there is a question of how one revamps the WTO, fast-headed the United Nations way, with agreements stuck because a single country can block consensus, and several agreements negotiated through regionalism routes. 

 In that context, responsibility also devolves on major developing countries like India, as it does need the WTO, notwithstanding regional agreements. There is a more serious issue. Not only is India?s agro export interest constrained by lack of domestic reforms, liberalization is needed for enhancing economic clout, thus contributing to bargaining power. The additional time, now obtained, should be used for this, not for being complacent.

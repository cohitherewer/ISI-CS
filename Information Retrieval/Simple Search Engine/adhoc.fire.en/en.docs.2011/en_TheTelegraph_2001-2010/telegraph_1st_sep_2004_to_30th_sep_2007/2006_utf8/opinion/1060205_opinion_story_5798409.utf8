 Letters to Editor

 On a slippery turf

 Sir ? H.D. Kumaraswamy has become the chief minister of Karnataka bringing the curtains down on a rather comical episode. But some questions remain. For instance, is Deve Gowda?s resignation as the party?s national president for real or is he just shedding crocodile tears? Also, why did the BJP decide to enter into an alliance with a leader who is notorious for his ficklemindedness? The real loser seems to be the people of the state who would have to visit the polling booths again in the near future. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 U.S. Iyer, Bangalore

 Dead men voting

 Sir ? The secret to the Left Front?s long reign in Bengal has now been revealed. It is hard for the opposition to win elections against a party for which even the dead turn out to vote (?Dead voter count: 3.5 lakh?, Jan 29). Although false voting is common in Indian politics, no other government can match the Marxists when it comes to rigging elections. However, the deletion of a large number of names from the state?s voters? list this year reflects the competence of the present Election Commission. It is a pity that the EC was not as efficient on earlier occasions. Perhaps, it could not stay above political influences before elections in the past. 

 The Front cannot boast of being democratic as it is in the habit of fixing polls. The communists in Bengal have left a lot of people disillusioned with their chicanery. One only hopes that poll officers will help hold free and fair elections in the state. That would bring about a change in government and retrieve Bengal?s lost glory. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The names of many people who work outside West Bengal have been struck off the voters? list by the poll officers who argued that they now stay elsewhere. These people however, do not have voting rights in the places where they work; they visit their home state regularly, and have also informed the election authorities to rectify the error. Yet, nothing much has been done about it. Will these people ultimately lose their right to vote?

 Yours faithfully,

J.C. Bose, Kalyani

 Sir ? Like the other districts in the state, Nadia, too, has thrown up a huge number of false voters in the voters? list. The poll officers need to be thanked for going about their jobs with all the seriousness it deserves. While this may have put the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in a spot of bother, leaders like Mamata Banerjee have no reason to smile just as yet. The drama surrounding Banerjee?s attempts to stitch up a mahajot of all anti-left parties may put off voters and help the Marxists win another term at the office. 

 Yours faithfully,

D.K. Roy, Calcutta 

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Was there any need for Usha Uthup to offer to sing for Lalu Prasad on the day he was vacating his house at 1 Anne Marg from where he ruled Bihar for 15 years (?No song at Anne on Lalu?s last leg?, Feb 3)? Did Uthup think that belting out a pop song with a dholak would do good for the railway minister?s despondent mood? Uthup, a self-proclaimed Lalu-fan, went a step further and demanded to meet his wife, Rabri Devi, but was politely refused by Lalu Prasad who told her ?Madam will not come out today?. One must admire Lalu Prasad for being courteous to Uthup at a time when he was far from cheerful.The singer should also thank Lalu for preventing her from meeting Rabri Devi. Forget Uthup, even Lata Mangeshkar would not have been able to lift her gloomy spirits on one of the saddest days of her life. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

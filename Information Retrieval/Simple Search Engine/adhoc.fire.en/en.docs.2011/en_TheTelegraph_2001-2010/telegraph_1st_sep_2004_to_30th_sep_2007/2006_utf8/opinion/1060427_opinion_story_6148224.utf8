 CHARTING A NEW COURSE

 George Fernandes?s ouster as the president of JD(U) has begun a process of churning that can change political equations in Bihar, writes Sumanta Sen

 Two?s company

 It had to happen at some point of time. The continuation of George Fernandes as president of the Janata Dal (United) (which sees itself as a secular force) and, at the same time, his close ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was always too much of a tight-rope walking. This was not quite liked by people like Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav. Now the latter has struck and Fernandes has been replaced by Yadav. And this perhaps has set in motion a process that may have long-term implications, not just for Fernandes as a person but also for the political life in the country.

 The ouster of Fernandes was presided by a couple of interesting developments. The chief minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar, has not made it a secret that he would be less than happy to welcome Lal Krishna Advani when the latter?s rath enters the state. Unlike his predecessor, he is not expected to arrest Advani. At the same time, it needs to be noted that Nitish Kumar has aired his lack of interest at a time when the BJP is his coalition partner and a member of the party occupies the chair of the deputy chief minister.

 Not just that. The chief minister recently invited state Congress president, Sadanand Singh, to a meal. As things stand in the state, the Congress is a party of no account. Why did then Kumar take time off from his busy schedule to play host to Singh? In Patna, the explanation is that through his invitation, Kumar was seeking to send a message that noting is permanent in politics and his own secular credentials as a socialist should not be forgotten.

 So is some kind of a new equation in the offing? This possibility cannot be ignored, particularly as the man replacing Fernandes is Sharad Yadav. At the national level, Yadav has always had good relations with the left. Subsequent developments like the breaking away of Lalu Prasad, the split in the Janata Dal and the manoeuvrings of Fernandes saw the JD(U) as a member of the National Democratic Alliance. However, Sharad Yadav could never have been at home with the saffron brigade at an ideological level. Now he and Nitish Kumar may well have chosen to gradually steer the party along a new course.

 There is of course a personal angle also to the removal of Fernandes from office. Non-Congress formations in Bihar had to accommodate a non-Bihari just because of his position at the national level for far too long. Now it is being felt that the time has come for sons of the soil to assert themselves. Fernandes himself has questioned the manner of his removal and has hinted that he would not give up without a fight. But the fight will be basically in Bihar, and here the ageing man may find his opponents too strong for him. On the other hand, Fernandes may just choose to accept the reality in which case the BJP will find him to be a person without teeth and not worth towing along. The man, who has always organized things to his own advantage, may now have reached the end of the road.

 But if Fernandes is not of much worth in Bihar, the same cannot be said of Lalu Prasad. Nitish Kumar may dine with Sadanand Singh but Lalu Prasad continues to remain as his arch enemy. Here Kumar and Sharad Yadav have a clear gameplan. Distance the JD(U) from the BJP and at the same time, invite defections from the Rashtriya Janata Dal, many of whose members are still not comfortable sitting in the opposition. The BJP will not like the JD(U) getting stronger in the state but will not be able to complain. Then if Ram Vilas Paswan also chooses to follow suit, then the Kumar-Yadav-Paswan combination will become a force to reckon with in the state and even get a man like Lalu Prasad worried over the future.

 There is another individual to be taken into account. This is H.D. Deve Gowda, the former prime minister. Deve Gowda?s son has seen to the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) ministry in Karnataka and has not been pulled up by daddy who is maintaining a low profile these days. His future as a politician lies in an unified Janata Dal, which is not aligned to the BJP. This seems to be the aim of the leaders in Bihar. If this happens, then Nitish Kumar may well feel emboldened to bring down his own ministry and opt for a mid-term poll, keeping both the BJP and the RJD out of his scheme of things. And the Congress on its part may not be averse to tying up with such a party as its ?secular? plank will not be compromised by the alliance. As for ditching Lalu Prasad, the Congress has shown in in the recent past that in Bihar ditching allies comes easy to the party.

 This will also please the left parties in the state. While the Communist Party Of India has made it clear that it wants to have nothing to do with Lalu Prasad, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has also never been comfortable keeping the company of a man who has so many charges against him. Actually in Bihar, both the communist parties need shoulders to lean on, and the Kumar-Sharad Yadav combination minus the BJP is a better option than Lalu Prasad.

 The developments in the JD(U) can only be of concern to the BJP. At a time when the party is not exactly a happy family, it can ill afford to have an important ally showing signs of restlessness. This is particularly so because that ally has so far given it some credibility to the world outside the influence of the sangh parivar. True, the JD(U) is restricted essentially to Bihar but losing that one state must be seen in the context of the party?s waning influence in Uttar Pradesh and its discomfort in Maharashtra because of the split in the Shiv Sena. The BJP leaders must also have taken note of the fact that Advani?s rath yatra has taken off for sometime now but it has failed to create the ripples that were expected. In this context, the results of the assembly elections in five states would prove to be crucial for the party. These are weak states for the BJP, but if its dream of making even the slightest inroad fails to come true, then, who knows, the party may decide to go the whole hog for Hindutva. That may not really help matters as this would alienate the JD(U) further. Therefore, it is a catch-22 situation.

 How does the JD(U) factor influence the Uttar Pradesh chief minister?s attempts to forge a third front? It doesn?t, because none of the constituents of that proposed front are as vocal against the BJP as they are of the Congress. Also these parties do not exist in Bihar. It is another matter that in electoral terms, such a front will be meaningless as none of the parties will be able to transfer its votes to the other as they are strictly regional in character. A united Janata Dal on the other hand may turn out to be more relevant to larger parts of the country.

 Right now, the only thing that can cause Fernandes and the BJP to breathe easy is the falling out of Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav. This possibility cannot be dismissed as unlikely as socialists in this country have a long history of parting company with each other. This has ensured that there is no socialist party in the country. The followers of Jayaprakash Narayan are no exception to this as any observer of the Bihar situation must be aware. And the fact that Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav are the present rulers of Bihar cannot be taken as a guarantee against their falling out as Lalu Prasad Yadav was the chief minister when his parent party had suffered a split.

 How things turn out is yet to be seen. For the present, however, it cannot be denied that a process of churning has begun. Existing arrangements are showing signs that they will crack up. The status quo seems to be getting disturbed and some would say that this itself is a sign of health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LAW FOR LAND

 It is easy to underestimate the significance of legislative victories. The series of amendments with which the East Calcutta Wetlands (Management and Conservation) Bill was passed in the assembly comes at the end of a long battle involving government departments, NGOs, and a number of environmental activists and concerned citizens. The general concern was with two things. First, the destruction of the delicately balanced and valuable ecosystem of the wetlands; and second, the nexus of administrative corruption, realtor profiteering, local politicking and environmental callousness which was promoting this destruction in the name of ?development? or ?urbanization and infrastructure?. The amendments have addressed both. The areas listed by the environment department as ?urban/rural settlements? have now been declared as waterbodies, restoring their original classification by the Calcutta high court and the Ramsar Bureau. This stalls the legal sanction for two real estate projects, which would have set precedents for more building on the Ramsar site. They also deprive the government of the power to exclude, curtail or modify any part of the wetlands.

 Legal checks, by themselves, will never fully ensure the conservation of the wetlands. The law will have to be implemented by an ecological awareness and conscientiousness informing not only government departments, municipal authorities and panchayat bodies, but also developers, the local communities that use these lands and other citizens. The lawkeepers must also be vigilant against infringements. And fears still remain. For instance, the clause about creating another waterbody if one is filled might look to some like a deliberately planted loophole. How does the question of filling a waterbody arise if this bill has been passed? But if this legal triumph leads to the government and civil society working together to protect a rare environmental resource, then a new form of consciousness might emerge within governance and citizenship. The Calcutta Municipal Corporation adopting and restoring waterbodies with the help of the South City group in north Calcutta is one such occasion for hope.

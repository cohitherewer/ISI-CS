 TEN AND ABOVE

 A double-digit GDP growth can be reached and even sustained, if India becomes more industry-friendly, writes Satrujit Banerjee

 More for less

 With an annual 8 per cent growth in gross domestic product for the last three years, India has every reason to rejoice. This year, manufacturing output, currently at 9 per cent, is fast closing in on the 10 per cent in services and is the prime reason for the forecast of 8.3 per cent GDP growth by the International Monetary Fund. For several decades, Indias route to economic development was distinctly different from that of the other Asian successes. While Japan, South Korea and China relied on manufacturing and exports for the double-digit growths in their GDPs, India focused on the domestic economy and almost accidentally stepped onto the services sector the software engineers, the computer programmers and the BPOs. But all this is rapidly changing. Manufacturing and exports are driving the economy at a much brisker pace of economic growth. New factories manufacturing motor cars to mobile phones, computers to washing machines, steel to tractors are coming up in the countryside.

 The irony of all this is, if the sudden spurt in the services sector was by accident, the spectacular advances currently being made in the manufacturing sector is by default! Global manufacturers are looking into the future and finding a serious demographic squeeze facing China. As a result of Chinas one child policy, family sizes have been shrinking since the early Eighties and long-term planners detect a shortage of young people in the future who will be available as factory labour. Interestingly, although India is not expected to pass China in total population until 2030, it will have more young workers aged 20 to 24 years by as early as 2013. The International Labour Organizaion predicts that by 2020, India will have 116 million workers in this age bracket to Chinas 94 million. 

 As if to emphasize this, earlier this year, factories in Chinas Guangdong province reported a staggering surplus of jobs over workers of one million and was thus forced to raise wages from $ 70 to $ 100 per month throughout the region. In sharp contrast, when LG, the South Korean electronics major, decided in 2005 to hire 458 assembly line workers paying around $ 90 per month here in India, it demanded applicants with at least 15 years education, further narrowing it down by deciding to hire a young work force, it received 55,000 applications which met their requirements.

 Suzuki, General Motors, Hyundai and Ford are already in the process of making India their hub for the export of cars. Mobile phone majors like Nokia and Motorola, and the tractor heavyweight, John Deere, have set up manufacturing plants here for the domestic market as also for exports. Major international steel players like Posco and Mittal Steel too are eyeing potential sites here. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, National Capital Region and Haryana are the frontline states where new plants are being set up or existing ones being substantially expanded. However, one aspect of this manufacturing boom which is disturbing is that all new ventures are capital intensive. As such, it is geared to need as few workers to run it as possible. The Whirlpool factory in Pune offers a good example. For producing 33,000 refrigerators a month, the company employs only 208 assembly line workers, making it the highest productivity-per-worker Whirlpool factory in the world, a rather dubious distinction considering Indias perennial 20 per cent unemployment rate. 

 Bajaj, the second largest motorcycle company in India, has a factory in Pune where 4,000 workers manufacture 1,500 low-cost vehicles a day. To increase the production, it built a brand new facility at Chakan, 40 kms away, complete with Fanuc robots which is at par with the latest the Japanese can offer. Only 900 employees turn out 2,600 high-end motorcycles a day. For new ventures throughout India, this is the rule rather than the exception.

 Archaic labour laws that have seen very little change since they were enacted shortly after independence are a major culprit. It is practically impossible for companies to lay off workers even if the companys fortunes sour or the economy slows. It also bans companies from allowing manufacturing workers to put in more than 54 hours of overtime in a three-month period even if the workers want to earn extra money. On the contrary, twelve-hour shifts are routine in some industries in China. 

 But by far, the biggest question 

 mark hanging over the rise of manufacturing in India lies 

 in whether the country has enough roads, ports and electricity- 

 generating plants to move huge quantities of goods and power 

 the factories that make them. The answer lies in a myriad 

 of maladies, primary among which is the woefully inadequate 

 infrastructure which India currently provides. China spends 

 seven times as much on roads, electricity, ports and running 

 and drinking water. The results are clearly visible. New 

 Delhi routinely experiences daily power cuts in excess of 

 four hours as does the whole of north India. In parts of 

 Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, there is no power for most of the 

 day during summer months. As a result, industries have to 

 install and run their generating sets everyday, producing 

 electricity at nearly eight times the cost of Chinas uninterrupted 

 power supply. 

 In Bangalore, which has become 

 a world centre in the IT industry, every company has a provision 

 to generate its own electricity because the government cannot 

 ensure an uninterrupted supply. Just a couple of years back, 

 Nhava Sheva, on the west coast, was hailed as the model 

 port and was slated to cater to the entire exports from 

 that region. Now there is a waiting time for export containers 

 to be loaded, ranging from one to four days. Expansion is 

 not in the immediate horizon. The story is much the same 

 in other ports as well, as they too have not been able to 

 cope with the increased traffic as a result of the rise 

 in exports and imports. 

 Let the powers that be not sit back contented and bask in the accolades showered on them for the achievements on the economic front, much of which came our way by happenstance. If we seize the opportunity offered, and make India a tad more industry-friendly, we will surely witness sustained double digit growth in the GDP before the 21st century steps on its teens.

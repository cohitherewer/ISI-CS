 ONUS OF TRADITION

 The Aligarh Muslim University has a rich legacy which it is unable to reconcile with modern reality. It began life as an institution dedicated to educating Muslims in English and in the Western sciences. It was the belief of Sayyid Ahmad Khan, the founder of what was to become AMU, that Muslims were falling behind in every sphere of society because of their lack of Western education. The institution thus carried a Muslim birthmark and its name records this identity. Despite enjoying the status of a central university, Aligarh retains its Muslim character. Even today, for a student keen to pursue the study of Persian or Urdu or even medieval Indian history, AMU would be the university of first choice. This is not to suggest that AMU does not teach other subjects. It does, but it is in the study of Persian, Urdu and medieval Indian history that it has earned an international reputation. This has only served to fortify its Muslim identity.

 This very identity ? some would argue that this is AMU?s strength ? has created an anomaly for AMU. How can it claim to be a modern university in a secular country and yet maintain its character as a Muslim university? Isn?t the very idea of a Muslim university anathema to the spirit of secularism? The conventional answer to such questions is that AMU has a special status and its Muslim character is an integral part of its original charter; the state should, in fact, protect this special status. This controversy has now become a legal wrangle. The character of a university and seat of learning cannot be decided in a court of law or by the state. Scholars and students associated with the university must decide on its character and its future. They must do so without expecting any state funding. The state should begin to pull out of the realm of higher education and scrap the concept of central universities. This will force institutions like AMU to rethink their own status and to chart their own future.

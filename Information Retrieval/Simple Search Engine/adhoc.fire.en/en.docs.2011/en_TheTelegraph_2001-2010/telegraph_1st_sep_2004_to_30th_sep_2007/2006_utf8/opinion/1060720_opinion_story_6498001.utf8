 Letters to Editor

 Twists and turns

 Sir ? The editorial comment, ?Hell hath no fury like a mild-mannered man whose anger is underestimated?, rings hollow when we find that the same man, the prime minister of India, takes two years to be convinced that ?Pakistan [has been] sponsoring violence against India? (?Stay tough?, July 18). And this after watching how Pakistan-aided terrorism scalded the whole of Punjab for years together, not to speak of the regular killing of innocent people since October 1947 in Jammu and Kashmir. They even had the cheek to attack the parliament house, an event that evoked some sound and fury from the Indian side. The message which Manmohan Singh seems to send to Pakistan after the Mumbai blasts is worn through overuse by his predecessors. Even Pranab Mukherjee?s firmness on not moving the army from the border is laughable. Do our leaders really expect to scare Pakistan with such statements?

 Pakistan has been pursuing its single-track hate-India policies through the Inter-Services Intelligence, terrorist outfits, the Students Islamic Movement of India and other similar organizations. It would be childish to hope that the cry of our ?mild-mannered? man would stop Pakistan in its tracks.

 The United States of America, which is supersensitive to any attack on her citizens anywhere in the world, pays lip-sympathy when Indians are killed, knowing full well Pakistan?s complicity in the terrorist attacks on India. For a country which has no qualms in supplying sophisticated weaponry and money to Pakistan, it is foolhardy to expect any active cooperation from the US in India?s own war on terror. 

 A strong India, and not a mild prime minister with strong words, is the need of the hour. It is important to reverse the gradual balkanization of India because of her squeamishness in the matter of statecraft. A common rule of law, a common civil code and a uniform system of education under a secular umbrella are the minimum requisites. If the prime minister can ?stay tough? in ensuring these, a strong India could indeed emerge under his leadership to stand up to Pakistan?s threats and manoeuvres.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? I agree with the editorial, ?Stay tough?, that ?every single terrorist attack in India carries Pakistan?s fingerprints? or that our prime minister ?is at the end of his tether so far as Pakistan is concerned?. There is no doubt that Manmohan Singh needs to convince the world that he is sincere in his tough stand against Pakistan. Unfortunately, the editorial does not spell out how he should go about this. Another bus ride to Pakistan perhaps?

 If Israel can hit back at Lebanon ?to smash Hizbollah, pure and simple? (?Israelis: Just smash them?, July 19 ), I fail to see why India cannot take the same approach and blast the militant bases in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir out of existence. How long are we going to suffer in silence while our innocent citizens continue to be killed? The enemy is not faceless. It is time the prime minister got a little angry for our sake.

 Yours faithfully,

Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Gain for India? (July 19), exemplifies what the Indian establishment has mastered over the years: self-delusion. Nowhere in the G-8 statement on terrorism has Pakistan?s name been mentioned. The editorial?s assumption that the G-8 will now take Pakistan to task is pure baloney. India must come to terms with one fact: that no one else will fight our battle against terrorism for us. It is no use pleading with the international community constantly. Surely we have some self-respect, especially since the country that is terrorizing us is one-fifth our size? The recent show of solidarity in Mumbai led by the president seems to portray India as having accepted defeat. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? Pulling out of the dialogue with Pakistan after the Mumbai blasts would be an irresponsible knee-jerk reaction. The peace process has made remarkable progress in the last three years. It should now be taken to its logical conclusion. The reason why terror attacks have increased and talks have slumped of late is because of a weakening of Pervez Musharrafs position in Islamabad. Should we then pin our hopes on the strengthening of his position? No, the process should acquire a momentum of its own so that it can continue with the next leader. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? The stalling of Indo-Pak talks comes as no surprise, since the involvement of Pakistan in terror attacks on India has always been an open secret.

 Yours faithfully,

Bedashruti Basu, Singapore

 Parting shot

 Sir ? I have read in The Telegraph over the last few days about the Royal Calcutta Turf Club?s affairs (?RCTC faces inter-venue crisis?, July 16, ?RCTC crisis deepens?, July 18, and ?Public view gains force, July 19). RCTC?s stewards are the custodian of the money entrusted to them by the public and the government. I think they (the stewards) owe an explanation to the public and the members of the club on how a relative of a steward was employed by the club in a key position with a six-figure salary. Was there an advertisement in the papers for the post?

 I believe about Rs 1.3 crore was spent on the repair and renovation of the race course office. I learnt that the roof of the ?repaired? office caved in recently, after which the angry staff locked up the contractor in the bathroom, accusing him of misusing public funds. Proper inquiry and explanation from the stewards are necessary to restore people?s confidence in the functioning of RCTC.

 Yours faithfully,

B.M. Varma, ex-chief steward, Royal Calcutta Turf Club, Calcutta

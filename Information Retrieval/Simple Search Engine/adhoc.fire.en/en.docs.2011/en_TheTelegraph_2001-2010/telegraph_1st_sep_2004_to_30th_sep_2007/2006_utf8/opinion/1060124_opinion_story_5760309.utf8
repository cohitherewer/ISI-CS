 Plane truths

 Sir ? The left parties have already started expressing their concern at the Jet Airways takeover of Air Sahara (?Left voices concern?, Jan 20). It only reflects their outdated perspective, as the merger of two airlines is a very common global phenomenon. It is for their vehement opposition to anything progressive in nature that the leftists are regarded as anti-reform. They should wake up to reality and learn from the rapid development of the Chinese economy as a result of liberal and pro-reform policies. Our communist leaders should take serious note of the remarks of Singapore?s former prime minister, Goh Chok Tong, who praised the reformist attitude of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee but was sceptical of the party Bhattacharjee represents. One can only implore the left not to become a stumbling block to India?s progress. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The dogmatic left feels that the Air Sahara-Jet Airways merger will create a Jet Airways monopoly in the civil aviation sector. The chairman of Jet Airways, Naresh Goyal, claims that even after the takeover of Air Sahara, Jet will have a market share of 41 per cent (although it is expected to rise to 50 per cent). As there will still be four to five airlines in the field, the fear of monopoly is unfounded. As far as access to the profitable routes is concerned, who is stopping Jet?s rivals from getting this access? Even prior to the merger, Jet was a success story ? it made a profit about five times that of Indian Airlines, in the year ending on March 31, 2005. This clearly shows that Jet?s takeover of Air Sahara is purely a business deal and not a monopolistic act.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Jet Airways?s acquisition of Air Sahara for about $ 500 million (or Rs 2,300 crore) has ended months of speculation on the future of Air Sahara, which has been up for grabs for quite some time (?Jet flies away with Sahara?, Jan 20). Air Sahara?s true value lies in its entrepreneurial advantages and the rights it holds in various domestic sectors and airports, as well as the licence to fly on a few international routes. Although others in the aviation industry, including the new entrant, Kingfisher Airlines, were also interested in the acquisition, the price tag apparently kept them out. 

 The deal has distinct advantages for both parties ? it can make Jet the major player in the domestic sector, with a market share of nearly 50 per cent in traffic, and bail Air Sahara out of its mounting liabilities. As per market reports, much of the money may go towards settlements of dues and debts. Further, the deal marks the first major step towards consolidation in the Indian aviation industry. The two airlines were among the first to enter the field when it was opened to the private sector. It remains to be seen what lessons the more recent entrants will draw from the Jet-Sahara deal.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Jet Airways has exhibited its financial strength and zest to provide quality service to customers by taking over Air Sahara. Now that Jet has acquired the prime position in India?s civil aviation sector, it should surge ahead of the new-look Indian (Airlines). This competition can gain from as well as facilitate the business boom in the country, where quick transportation of officials from one part of the country to another is a basic requirement. 

 Yours faithfully,

 University blues

 Sir ? The editorial, ?University of mediocrity? (Jan 21), has painted a picture of the University of Calcutta that is largely true. However, the implication that the university is churning out ?devalued degrees? is objectionable. The university still enjoys a more prominent global presence in international conferences than any other Indian University (excluding research institutes), and is very well-respected for the performance of its alumni. This has been recognized in surveys of the world?s top universities, where the University of Calcutta has figured among the top Indian institutes. Most of the university?s graduates get accepted in highly respected post-graduate institutes, both in India and the world. Indeed, no institute can deliver scholars of exemplary calibre on a regular basis. The fact that the faculty and students of the University of Calcutta have consistently excelled in spite of the pollution of the academic atmosphere speaks volumes of the calibre of its students and teachers. It is time the West Bengal government realizes that it is individual brilliance, and not the state government?s munificence, that has helped the university maintain its standard. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudipto Banerjee, Minneapolis

 Sir ? There was a time when studying at the University of Calcutta was a matter of pride. Though much younger to Oxford and Cambridge, CU earned comparison with these elite British universities. The faculties of the university boasted of such names as Bhabatosh Dutta, Amlan Dutta, S.N. Sen and Suniti Chattopadhyay. 

 The decline began from the Sixties and Seventies when the Naxalites forced good students to flock to other universities. Today, political interference has become par for the course. Vice chancellorships have become rewards for an individual?s closeness to the bosses in Alimuddin Street, while teachers are recruited from the party cadre. Student unions, with their obvious political affiliations, disrupt classes with impunity. Unless mindsets change and academics can function freely, the future of the university looks bleak.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

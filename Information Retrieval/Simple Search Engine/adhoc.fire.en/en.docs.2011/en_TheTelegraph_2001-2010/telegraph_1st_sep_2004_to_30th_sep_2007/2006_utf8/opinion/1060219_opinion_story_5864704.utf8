The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 When heavyweight Congresswallahs are hardly satisfied with their portfolios, there is no reason to suspect they would be happy with their workspaces. And if anyone is as upset with work as Ambika Soni, then any solution emanating from a temporal authority other than 10 Janpath is unlikely to resolve matters. In other words, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi?s intervention in sorting out Soni?s problem with her room in Parliament House was doomed from the start. But since Soni insisted, the parliamentary affairs minister persevered. Soni, the new culture and tourism minister, given her proximity to the Nehru-Gandhis, envisions herself to be seated in the ground floor circular corridor of the building which houses the high and mighty of the UPA government. But the house, which is like no other, has its own set of rules. Unlike the AICC headquarters, there are customs to be followed, and in terms of those (seniority for example), Soni falls far short of the requirements. Desperate, Das Munshi nevertheless approached the social justice minister, Meira Kumar, requesting her to make room for Soni. The former diplomat was outraged. Das Munshi was told, and in no uncertain terms, that this would constitute an insult to the 200 million Dalits across the country and belittle the legacy of Jagjivan Ram himself. Last heard, Das Munshi was still trying to understand the caste equation thrown at him while a livid Soni had got busy again with her own calculations to acquire a room of her own.

 Mani Shankar Aiyar has a room of his own, and a huge one at that, but he still feels crammed in. There are too many people meddling in his ministry. Cricket matters obviously go to Sharad Pawar, football to Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, athletics to Suresh Kalmadi, hockey to KPS Gill, rowing to KP Singh Deo, and hordes of other politicos lord over other sports bodies. Aiyar has a suggestion for the PM if he cares to listen. Let him change his room to the external affairs ministry, where he could sit in the chair Natwar Singh once did. If only wishes were horses...

 Ever since Anand Sharma became a minister of state in the MEA, there have been things happening. One was the invitation to all heads of missions hailing from African countries for a chat-cum-meal. For the emissaries of these states who are mostly forgotten, this was a rare gesture. The interaction was widely praised. But before you give the kudos to Sharma consider one fact. Anand?s wife is from South Africa. That explains the warmth?

 Canniness or absent-mindedness? When it comes to AB Vajpayee, one still doesn?t know. At the RSS Samarpan Diwas, where the big and the small had to contribute to the party fund, sanghis came with bulging pockets or cheques in hand. Except the vikas purush. When Vajpayee?s turn came after Rajnath Singh, his face turned blank. There followed a quick rummaging of the pockets, but when that yielded nothing, Vajpayee blinked and smiled a little before gesturing with his hands that he had nothing to give. Indeed!

 Believe it or not, there is only one electric meter inspector for the entire area covered by the New Delhi municipal committee. And he does not have the technical wherewithal to detect slippage in old meters or ways to calibrate them as per the rules of the electricity regulatory authority. The facts emerged when a senior secretary to the GoI took up what he suspected to be a case of excessive billing by the NDMC electric department. The inspector not only did not have the tools to detect the cause for a fast-running meter, but also did not know how to make the necessary corrections. Anyone to take the blame for this poor man?

 The UPA seems all set to give a free rein to the controversial lottery business, and is determined to place a bill to the effect in parliament. All of this is giving jitters to anti-lottery campaigners like Vijay Goel, former minister in the Vajpayee government. Goel, convinced that it is a bane for the poor, was himself under pressure to drop his opposition to lotteries, but has refused to succumb. How powerful is the pro-lottery lobby can be gauged from the fact that when a parliamentary select committee sought public response through newspaper ads on whether lotteries should be banned, only six people said yes (Goel being one of them). The 53,000 other correspondents argued forcefully that the ban should be lifted. It is another matter that the text of all the 53,000 messages was identical. 

 Days after it forced LK Advani to bite dust and resign from office, the ghost of Jinnah still seems to be bothering the sanghis. For a while it seemed that at least one person had got over his fear. In his latest avatar as a pilgrim, Jaswant Singh announced that he would visit Jinnah?s mazaar when he was in Pakistan. But Jaswant returned without fulfilling his promise. The excuse proferred was that he had fallen ill on the day he was supposed to undertake the journey. The buzz is that he had received calls from both Pramod Mahajan and Rajnath Singh warning him of the likely impact of the trip. Days later, it was Arun Jaitley?s turn to visit Pakistan to see an ODI between India and Pakistan with friends and supporters. Shahryar Khan, the Pakistan Cricket Control Board chairman, had apparently sent 40 passes to Jaitley. But the former law minister chose to stay away. What was it that scared him?

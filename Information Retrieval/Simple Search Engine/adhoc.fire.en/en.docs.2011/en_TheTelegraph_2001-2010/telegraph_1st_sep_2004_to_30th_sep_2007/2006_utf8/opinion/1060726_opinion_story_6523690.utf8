 PAPERCHASE

 By all estimates, Ms Ketaki Dewasi is a lucky girl. And not least because she alone had the pleasure of having her Madhyamik marksheet delivered to her doorstep by the West Bengal board of secondary education. It is because she was fortunate enough to have been advised by her school to take the board to court without first filing for a scrutiny of her life science paper. In this paper, she was marked 33 instead of the 83 she actually got. Although the board president, Mr Ujjwal Basu, may insist that this is the institutionalized route, following it would have cost Ms Dewasi an academic year, if not her entire career. As Mr Basu may not be entirely unaware, there are hundreds of students patiently waiting for their papers to be produced in court after a year or more of the prescribed post-publication scrutiny, the results of which they find as unacceptable as the marks inscribed on their marksheets. And many of them would not even suspect their answer-scripts to have been destroyed in the meantime by the board, which, reportedly, cannot preserve them beyond a stipulated period. Even as Ms Dewasi makes up for lost time, there are more than a hundred other cases filed this year alone that have to be resolved to help students brace themselves for the next state-induced trauma ? taking the higher secondary examination.

 Arguably, it is not the examination system alone which makes secondary education such a harrowing experience in Bengal, but it makes up a significant part of this experience. Together with the syllabus (the Madhyamik course will purportedly change from 2008), the lack of infrastructure and of the teachers? commitment, and the mismanagement, the entire system seems to be driving students to despair, and sometimes even suicide. City schools are opting for other more efficiently-managed boards, but the choice for rural Bengal may not be so easy. There is no denying that handling an examination with 751,459 candidates is a difficult task. But in addition to the new technology, the board should perhaps consider a more decentralized management of examinations and greater accountability as ways to shorten the queue in the law courts.

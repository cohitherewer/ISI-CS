 Trial by fire

 Sir Factual inaccuracies in General Pervez Musharrafs memoirs have caused justifiable outrage in Delhi, and might deter the Indo-Pakistan peace process (Forget facts, its the selling thats masterly, Sept 27). In the Line of Fire indulges in distortion of well-established facts that could negatively impinge on security issues for both the countries. Musharrafs description of the outcome of the Kargil war as a great victory for Pakistan proves that his book lacks credibility. He also claims that Indias uranium enrichment programme has benefited from Pakistans centrifuge design, and from A.Q. Khans clandestine network. Such claims, however, are aimed at belittling Indias excellent record in nuclear non-proliferation. The former prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, has also dismissed Musharrafs contention that the failure of the Agra summit was a result of their humiliation by someone above. This only goes to show that Musharrafs book is based on selective, often flawed, recollections. 

 The book might be doing great business but it is unlikely to enhance the stature or credibility of its author. The utter insensitivity with which Musharraf has spoken out on issues that require tact and diplomacy exposes a rashness, unbecoming in a leader of his stature. The contents of the book and the time of its release appear to have been aimed at dousing domestic fires and deflecting criticism from his political opponents. Obviously, he is seeking to bolster his position ahead of possible presidential elections next year. However, in doing so, he has put narrow personal gain before the interests of his country. Courting controversy to boost book sales is quite a well known tactical strategy. It is unfortunate that the head of a state would stoop low enough to follow this path. Musharrafs allegations against Delhi will only give credence to those in India who have been arguing that diplomacy with the general is an exercise in futility. This is not the kind of book that a head of state genuinely committed to rapprochement with India would write. His justification of terrorism has dealt a blow to the prospective Indo-Pakistan counter-terrorism venture, even before the proposal could take off. Trust between India and Pakistan, tenuous at the best of times, has crumbled further, thanks to this memoirs.

 Sir Musharrafs disclosures have placed the general in deep waters. Has he forgotten that Pakistan has, for a long time, denied the role of its army in Kargil, so much so that the bodies of Pakistani soldiers killed during the war remained unclaimed? How could such a man be trusted? One wonders why Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is still determined to follow the near-utopian and unrealistic idea of an Indo-Pakistan collaboration to counter terrorism. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The general-turned-president-turned-author, Pervez Musharraf, has proved he can easily camouflage defeats as victories. One wonders how he could glorify his countrys role in a conflict in which Pakistan disowned the bodies of its own soldiers. Those who survived could be retrieved only due to the diplomatic skills of the then prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif. If one is to go by Musharrafs words, the pressure of ruling over the country for more than three decades has blunted the professionalism of the Pakistani armed forces. This, one supposes, required a change in strategy in the bleed India policy, and one soon saw the use of indoctrinated youth to fight battles on Pakistans behalf. Perhaps, it would be better to read through the author rather than the book to comprehend his conspiracy theories better.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Musharraf is under fire for his book, In the Line of Fire (By the Book, Sept. 29). There is a Hollywood movie with the same title starring Clint Eastwood in the lead role. Eastwood plays a secret service agent who takes his job of guarding the American president seriously. The publishers of Musharrafs book, Simon and Schuster, possibly, have borrowed the movie title to project the Pakistan president in the same light as a faithful ally (or is it subordinate?) of President George W. Bush. 

 The question of the propriety of a president, who also happens to be the chief of the armed forces of his country, publishing his memoirs while still in office, is being hotly contested all round. But for the fact that Pakistan is an Islamic country, Musharraf might probably have arranged for a few of his statues to be erected in the country, to perpetuate his memory as a saviour of Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

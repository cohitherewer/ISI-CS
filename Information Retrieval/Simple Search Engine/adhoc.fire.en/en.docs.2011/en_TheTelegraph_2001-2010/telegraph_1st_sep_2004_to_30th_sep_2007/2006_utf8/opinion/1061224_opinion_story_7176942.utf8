The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 The winner is about to take all in UP. And, contrary to the general impression, it is not the Dalit queen who is in the lead anymore or the Congress babalog. Mulayam Singh, if the red carpet rolled out in the state for the BJP bigwigs is any indication, is already preparing for the post-poll scenario. What turned the tide for the Samajwadi Party? If the grapevine is to be believed, it is Mulayams reaffirmed hold on the Muslim-Yadav constituency. He has been labouring towards it for a while. Populist schemes like the one-time gift of Rs 20,000 for each marriageable daughter of a poor family are catered to this ideal. Mulayam has also been undertaking tours to districts with senior officers to trouble-shoot. But the single-most successful gambit has been the recruitment of around 30,000 policemen. It goes without saying that a disproportionately high percentage of the new recruits belong to Mulayams own community. But a fair number from the minority community has also found their way into the force. With such a vast number of recipients of the CMs bounty manning crucial outposts in the cowbelt, the kingdom may not go to the queen, finally.

 Where Dalits and the minorities are concerned, the game is not restricted to UP alone. The countdown to the two-day international Dalit-minorities meet has begun, and leaders are trying their best to steal the show. The organizer of the meet, Ram Vilas Paswan, has his own calculations. He has invited VP Singh and hopes to corner glory by teaming up with the Raja of Manda. There are others in the fray, Congresswallahs like Arjun Singh, AR Antulay and Meira Kumar. Arjun has instructed his wordsmiths to craft the speech of a lifetime. Antulays staff is working overtime to showcase their boss. And Meira Kumar is counting on the legacy of Jagjivan Ram to emerge the winner.

 Indias ambassador to the US, the indubitable Ronen Sen, got a taste of parliament security the other day. He had gone to the house to witness the debate over the Indo-US nuclear deal, but at the main gate, his car was refused entry. The easy-going Sen just got off and began walking. That is till he was spotted by the Congress MP, Rajiv Shukla. The MP turned to the securitymen, telling them that they had refused permission to a man who was the chief architect of the global security mechanism. The apologies were profuse, but were the men impressed enough?

 Parliamentary affairs are now quite popular with Indian cinestars, if their growing presence in the two houses are any indication. However, there are still some who are a trifle unconvinced. Take BJPs Dharmendra and the Congresss Govinda, the two stars who were conspicuous by their absence in the winter session. Both, in fact, are supposed to have decided not to seek re-election. The other set of Bollywood figures seems to enjoy every bit of their newly-acquired VIP status, some are even prepared to fight tooth and nail for it (remember Jaya Bachchan?).

 Theres no discouraging the Gorkhas. The demand for a separate Gorkhaland was heard once again in the capital. It was voiced by the Bharatiya Gorkha Parisangh, which recently called on the PM, the home minister and other top government officials. The prime minister has given the front a patient hearing but offered nothing concrete. The Union home minister has been similarly lukewarm to the Parisanghs demands, which include recognition of Gurkhas as freedom-fighters and a distinction between Indian Gurkhas and those of Nepali origin. However, given that Pranab Mukherjee, who heads the AICC panel on smaller states, is averse to encouraging more divisions in the polity, the Parisangh may have to persevere more.

 The Rais and Bachchans continue to get all the attention they crave for. Ash holding hands with Jaya at Mumbais Leelavati hospital, where the Bachchan matriarch, Teji, is admitted, was further grist to the rumour mills. There are also cynics who allege that all is not well with the two families. Ashs father, for example, did not take too kindly to his daughter being publicized as a manglik during the visit to the Varanasi temple. There are still others who believe the success of the film, Guru, will determine if the wedding bells will toll at all. And then there are the ever-hopefuls who think February 19 will be the big day. Watch this space for more.

 One thing is for sure. Ram Jethmalani is not one to be easily defeated. The Delhi high court verdict in the Manu Sharma case might have gone against him, but for an ace lawyer like Ram, such things do no irreparable harm. As he himself is supposed to have admitted in parliament when he was berated for his unprincipled stand, anything was fine so long as it kept him in the public eye. Which is probably why Ram did not blink twice before popping a question to the law minister which he knew would offend the latter. Hansraj Bhardwaj was solemnly answering questions regarding the appointment of judges to fill existing vacancies when Jethmalani asked whether a system could be devised so that good judges like Muni Lal Paswan can be rewarded for their good work. Bhardwaj side-stepped the query, but its import was not lost. Paswan, the special judge in Patna, has recently acquitted Lalu Prasad and his wife. Was the spotlight good enough, Ram?

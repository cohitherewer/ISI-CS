 Extracts from the United Nations World Water Development Report 2, 2006

 Water is an essential life-sustaining element. It pervades our lives and is deeply embedded in our cultural backgrounds. The basic human needs of a secure food supply and freedom from disease depend on it. Social development...such as the smooth functioning of hospitals... relies on the availability of clean water. Economic development requires energy resources and industrial activities, and both are in turn water-dependent.

 The provision of sanitation for girls in schools offers yet another example of water?s broader links ? it has positive effects on hygiene and health...and helps to safeguard the natural environment. For these reasons and many more, access to safe drinking water and sanitation is both a development target in its own right and integrally linked to achieving all the Millennium Development Goals.

 The United Nations World Water Development Report is the flagship publication of UN-Water, the inter-agency mechanism established to coordinate the activities of all United Nations agencies and entities working in the area of freshwater resources....The Report is produced by UN-Water?s World Water Assessment Programme. Working closely with governments, non-governmental organizations, civil society groups and the private sector, WWAP monitors water problems, provides recommendations for meeting future demand, and develops case studies in order to promote informed discussion of freshwater issues.

 This second edition of the World Water Development Report ? Water, A Shared Responsibility ? shows that collective responsibility is essential for assessing and monitoring progress and for meeting internationally-agreed targets and goals. 

 Change can lead to famine, loss of resources and contamination of water supplies. Population pressure on forest resources can accelerate land degradation and compromise watershed functions, increasing the vulnerability of the poorest communities. Warming temperatures, rising sea levels, uncertain effects on ecosystems, and increased climatic variability are just some of the changes expected to have a disproportionate and significant impact on developing countries.

 While climate may reduce poor people?s assets, increased climate variability will increase their vulnerability and undermine their resilience and coping ability. Thus, climate variability and change present a fundamental challenge to the long-term development prospects of many developing countries, and will make it difficult to meet and sustain the Millennium Development Goals.

 ...Water is fundamental to our way of life, at whatever point in the socio-economic spectrum a community may be situated. It is likewise crucial to the preservation of the essential ecosystems upon which our lives depend. Whatever development initiatives are proposed over and above the provision of secure access to water...unless the requisite water services are secured and provided, these initiatives will not succeed. Access to secure water supplies is essential.... Yet...it is clear that the central role of water in development is neither well understood nor appreciated. Much more needs to be done by the water sector to educate the world at large and decision-makers in particular.

 Water is the primary life-giving resource. Its availability is an essential component in socio-economic development and poverty reduction. Today, a number of significant factors have an impact both on this resource and on managing water in an integrated, sustainable and equitable manner. These include widespread poverty, malnutrition, the dramatic impacts of demographic change, growing urbanization, the effects of globalization ? with the threats and opportunities this brings ? and the recent manifestations of climate change. All these factors impinge on the water sector in increasingly complex ways.

 The defining characteristic of today?s world is change. In almost every sector ...the pace of change is unprecedented in recent history. Technological change ...facilitates ?globalization?, which in turn affects virtually all aspects of our lives as physical and cultural products move ever more easily around the world. As internationalization and rapid economic growth in many societies alter traditional socio-economic structures, it is clear that change...is not entirely positive. Many people, especially in the developing world and...on urban margins and in rural areas, are left behind in poverty and mired in preventable disease. All the chapters in this Report address this issue in one form or another.

 PRIZE DEAL GOING SOUR

 Twenty-Twenty 

- Bharat Bhushan

 Power point

 Three weeks before the arrival of the US president, George Bush, the indications are that the India-US nuclear deal may not be signed and sealed in time. It is unprecedented that the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and secretary of the department of atomic energy, Anil Kakodkar, should have chosen to give an extensive explanation in public of where the negotiations are stuck and why.

 He has said four things: One, that the fast breeder reactor programme cannot be put under international safeguards; two, that nothing should be done to compromise India?s nuclear power programme; three, that the division of nuclear facilities into civilian or military domains has to be an Indian decision; and four, that if the civilian domain is made so big that it affects India?s strategic interests, then that will not be acceptable. What this means is that there is US pressure on each of these counts.

 It is puzzling that Kakodkar should go public with such a detailed critique a few weeks before Bush?s visit, unmindful of the political class. Assuming that Kakodkar has done this off his own bat, then what could have prompted him? He must be aware that the Bush visit would lead to pressure to see the deal through. If the political class failed to withstand it, then the pressure would eventually come to bear on him and the DAE. By making the contentious issues public, he has ensured that the hands of the extremely active pro-US lobby in the government are effectively tied down.

 Such an explanation makes the interview an act of desperation. Kakodkar was asked three times whether he would bow to the political decision-makers should they decide to overrule him. Thrice he replied that he is a professional whose job is to point out what the facts are.

 It is unlikely that a bureaucratic high achiever like Anil Kakodkar would want to confront the political decision-makers in this manner. The prime minister has more than underlined the fact that Kakodkar had been consulted and he had said that he could live with the deal.

 The only other plausible explanation then is that this is mere shadow boxing. The chairman of DAE is fully aware of his responsibilities ? he is only creating technical grounds that the political leaders can then refer to in their difficult negotiations with the US. Kakodkar is being used not to scuttle the nuclear deal but to ward off US pressure to seal it in a manner unacceptable to India.

 Notice that Kakodkar has said nothing in his interview that goes against the known negotiating posture of the government. He is only specifying the bottomline below which it would be difficult for India to go. While this may seem a clever move, it also demonstrates how unprofessionally the broad contours of the India-US nuclear deal have been negotiated. India went to the US with its preferences and thought that Washington would go along without a gameplan of its own. The important question to ask is: What does the US get out of the deal if it cannot prevent India from producing fissile material to increase its military nuclear capability?

 If Washington only wanted to help India produce more electricity, then why would it want indigenously built nuclear plants, nuclear material production and research facilities put under international inspection? It should have merely demanded that the imported nuclear technology and material be put under inspection and safeguards to prevent their diversion for military use. India?s horizontal non-proliferation record is impeccable ? export controls and requisite laws are in place to prevent leakage of technology to third countries. So that cannot be a matter of US concern.

 The inevitable conclusion, therefore, is that the US wants to place limits on India?s strategic or military nuclear capability ? to prevent vertical proliferation in terms of building greater quantity and quality of nuclear weapons. This is why the FBR has become a bone of contention. It produces plutonium that can be used both for making bombs and for producing energy. Kakodkar made it clear that the FBR was linked to both strategic and energy security of India through the fuel cycle. The FBR is not a proliferation-free reactor.

 India is being offered participation in the global nuclear energy partnership as an incentive to ink the nuclear deal. The GNEP is not about FBRs, but about proliferation-free reactors. So the US will still be able to restrict further production of weapons-grade fissile material.

 The US has rejected what India is willing to put in the civilian basket as too little. The broad outlines of this plan with the US are in the form of the talking points left by the foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, with his US interlocutors. Leaving behind talking points indicates a desire to ensure that there is no confusion about the official position taken. The US now knows what the Indian bottomline is and has rejected it, so any concessions made to save the deal would have to be above that.

 Suppose the Indian negotiators propose that the FBR is put under safeguard in phases ? specifying dates when the technology is likely to mature so that nothing is left open-ended. It could save the deal. But the US political system may not tolerate such a concession and it may also be difficult for India to draw precise timelines about the FBR technology maturing. The only other way out is for the US to keep the FBR, along with some indigenous reactors that use un-safeguarded material, out of the civilian list so that the FBR can be fuelled. India would also have to keep the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Uranium enrichment facility at Mysore out of the safeguards list.

 The National Democratic Alliance government had offered to put ?a couple of reactors? under safeguards. That number can perhaps go up to half a dozen. It would represent an important breakthrough in India-US relations. However, many in the US would see that as a marriage without a groom and therefore reject it. Even if the US administration were to take a softer line because of Bush?s visit, the US congress will not accept it. US non-proliferation purists say that the condition for getting access to US nuclear technology has to be that India stops producing fissile material.

 Manmohan Singh seemed to hint that negotiating the nuclear deal was going to be a prolonged process and, quite significantly, added, ?Our relationship with the US is not...limited only to cooperation in civilian nuclear power.? Could this point to a realization that the deal will not be through before the Bush visit?

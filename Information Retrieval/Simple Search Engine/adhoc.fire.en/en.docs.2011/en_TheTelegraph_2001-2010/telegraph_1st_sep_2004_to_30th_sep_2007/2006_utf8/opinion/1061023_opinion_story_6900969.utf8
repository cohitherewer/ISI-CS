 IN TROUBLE

 Jet Airways took off just over a decade ago; soon it made a reputation as an airline of quality. That did not seem such an achievement then, since the only competition came from the aged, lumbering, off-putting Indian Airlines. Some fuddy-duddies may have remembered the smart service its staff used to give when it was still a Tata airline, but decades as a government airline had wiped out the tradition it had inherited. It was David against Goliath; the outcome was not in doubt. Jet steadily took away passengers; Indian Airlines was left carrying members of parliament, bureaucrats and other free riders. Jet overtook Indian Airlines as the largest domestic airline. Jets success brought in imitators; new private airlines entered the field. The year 2005 saw the largest aircraft acquisitions by Indian airline operators in history. And with competition came differentiation. Deccan Airways started a barebones, cut-price service at one end, while Kingfisher started a luxury service at the other. At first, it looked as if Jet was invincible. It made Sahara, its closest private competitor, bleed, and nearly bought it up. But then Sahara lived to wait for a better offer. 

 It now looks unlikely that the offer will come soon. For meanwhile, the unthinkable has happened: Jet has made its first-ever loss. A sizeable part of it is on account of international operations; the limited overseas service Jet has started simply does not pay. But domestic services have made an even bigger loss. Jet, having become a public limited company, has to publish its accounts; other private airlines do not have to. But they must be bleeding even worse.

 Their distress is palpable. They met Mr Praful Patel, the aviation minister, to see if he would restrict competition and give them relief. He will not license new airlines, but he can do nothing to close down those that are already in the field. They set up an industry association. It will no doubt act as a lobby in the tradition of Indian industry bodies; in particular, it will lobby the government to make aviation fuel cheaper. But it is doubtful that it will be able to raise fares. The industry has surplus capacity at the present fares; at higher fares, it will have even more. In the battle to come, those with the deepest pockets will survive; those with empty pockets will go bankrupt. What this industry needs is capital. Indian businesses are piling in cash; but they do not seem likely to take over bankrupt airlines. The only way fresh capital can be infused into this industry is to open it to foreign investors. This will be vehemently resisted by the current owners. There will be voices against it in the government and amongst its allies. But seeing the impracticality of cartelization, foreign investment seems the only way of stabilizing the industry.

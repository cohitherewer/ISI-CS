 Letters to Editor

 Fingers burnt

 Sir It was unbecoming on the part of the West Bengal chief minister to describe Jagmohan Dalmiyas triumph to the post of CAB president as the victory of evil over good. As someone who has been democratically elected as the chief minister of a state, Bhattacharjee should have acknowledged Dalmiyas victory in a free and fair poll and accepted the defeat of his candidate in a sporting manner. Moreover, his pledge to rid Eden Gardens of the evil Dalmiya can only be described as an outburst of a frustrated person who is yet to taste defeat in the political arena for over three decades. Perhaps someone should tell Bhattacharjee that politics is a different ballgame from cricket.

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir It is shocking to see the normally quiet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in such a belligerent mood. In fact, if Bhattacharjee carries on like this, it would be difficult to differentiate him from his great rival, Mamata Banerjee. Unfortunately, Bhattacharjees jihad against Dalmiya has also put a dent on his clean image. It is evident that Dalmiyas victory over Prasun Mukherjee (propped up by the chief minister) foiled Bhattacharjees bid to gain indirect control over the Cricket Association of Bengal. It would be better if Bhattacharjee got busy with Bengals economic resurgence instead of meddling in the internal affairs of an autonomous sporting body. By criticizing a man who won a democratic election, the chief minister has also cast aspersions on the integrity of all those who voted in Dalmiyas favour. Finally, calling Dalmiyas win a victory of evil over good is wide off the mark. Does Bhattacharjee think that he epitomizes all that is good in this world?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The language used by a cultured person like Bhattacharjee while spitting venom against the newly-elected president of the CAB was shocking, to say the least. His comment smacks of a Stalinist mindset, which is common among our comrades who try and win everything by force. It seems that Bhattacharjee has decided to settle his scores with Dalmiya by using Sourav Ganguly as a pawn. Bhattacharjee is convinced that Dalmiyas ouster would facilitate Gangulys return to the national side, which, in turn, would boost the chief ministers image among his electorate. But the chief minister is living in a fools paradise. It is a pity that he could not even understand that a man in his position should not have interfered with the elections of a sporting body in the first place.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Maitra, Agarpara

 Sir How can Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee stoop so low as to describe Dalmiyas win as a victory of the forces of evil? Was Bhattacharjee voicing the peoples opinion about his partys victory at the hustings a few months ago? Such remarks are very embarrassing, particularly to those of us who reside outside Bengal. Bhattacharjees tirade exposes the true colours of a supposedly pragmatic chief minister who is gaining popularity all over the country. Dalmiyas win in the CAB polls has been a blessing for the police commissioner, who will now be able to devote more time to his job. In fact, the country requires many more Dalmiyas who can replace some of our ministers who have very little time for their work.

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mookerjee, Pune

 Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is of the opinion that Jagmohan Dalmiyas victory in the CAB elections will surely doom the future of cricket in West Bengal. But the chief minister need not have fretted. There are still a few games that are outside the realm of Dalmiyas evil influence football, hockey, table tennis, tennis, badminton and so on. Instead of bad mouthing the CAB chief, Buddha babu should now try to ensure that Bengal achieves success in these other games. Incidentally, the state does not even have a world-class turf to play hockey on. I hope Bhattacharjee is able to build one soon without Dalmiyas help.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The honourable chief ministers remark against Dalmiya shows that politicians in our country have little regard for their opponents, even if they manage to win democratically-contested elections. Furthermore, this incident also shows Bhattacharjee in very poor light, especially in front of his partymen, some of whom had asked the chief minister to wash his hands of the matter. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has not been able to stomach the results of the CAB polls since his candidate, Prasun Mukherjee, lost out to the wily Dalmiya. Despite the odds stacked against him, the former chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. His flair must be acknowledged and respected by one and all. It now seems that at last there is someone who can oppose Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tooth and nail. This incident has also put a question mark over the return of the e-mail boy of Indian cricket who has been doing everything except scoring runs to get back in the team.

 Yours faithfully,

Ajmal Hussain, Sivasagar, Assam

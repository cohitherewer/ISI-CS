 SIT AND WATCH OTHERS

Malvika Singh

 While watching a television programme on Abu Dhabi and its plans for development and growth, one realized how backward and silly India is being in relation to the tourism industry. Despite heavyweight economists at the helm, responsible for new policy initiatives to generate employment and wealth, this government continues to put the largest asset of the service sector on the backburner. The low priority status awarded to tourism makes one?s blood boil. 

 Abu Dhabi has begun to put in place the required infrastructure to sell ?hot sands, blue waters and its culture?. It has already drawn in large numbers of travellers. The industry has begun to boom. Hotel projects are being planned and will be up and running in Abu Dhabi attracting people and commerce, while hoteliers in India continue to struggle against red tapism, archaic ?rules, clearances, permissions?. We never manage to get our act together, discard what has been detrimental to clean, efficient business in order to ensure productivity, smooth functioning and rapid growth in this sector. 

 India is a magical, ancient civilization with much to offer to the world. We are a modern society where traditional mores change sensibly through generations. We have the largest repository of human resource in the world. We are possibly the most complex, multicultural pluralistic nation. We have a large diaspora. What we do not have is the will to celebrate and grow these inherent strengths. Our leadership and its bureaucracy have restrained and restricted India?s ingenuity, diminished national pride, and caged the vivacity and diverse genius of its people. 

 What is wrong?

 There is no explanation for treating the services sector in this manner. It makes no economic sense. It makes no political sense either. And, it is senseless to waste this unique resource ? natural, material and human ? that come together as an extraordinary living culture. Why is it so difficult for the prime minister and his cabinet to sit around a table and spell out a policy that fits into our contemporary world? Why are they not challenged or excited by the prospect of a dramatic change that will lead to inclusive growth? Why is there no new thinking on anything from literacy to primary education to reservations to conservation and restoration to the environment to city planning to tourism to infrastructure (the list is interminable)? Why this dismal, all pervading vacuum? 

 Many in key positions in both parliament and government agree that nothing substantial is happening, that no dynamic initiatives have been ushered in to replace what has clearly failed. What then is stalling action? Why are cabinet ministers, Congress leaders, members of special ?bodies? and commissions so demoralized? Why is everything in a limbo? Some of our best and brightest professionals were charged up when the Manmohan Singh government took its oath of office. They enthusiastically joined the various think tanks like the national advisory council and the knowledge commission. Why did the experiment to draw in experts and thinkers dissipate so swiftly? Many participants agreed to take their time off from professional commitments and join the process for change and renewal. Many are already disillusioned. What has gone wrong? Why this loss of faith? And why is the feeling unanimous? 

 To ask the question is important because the malaise has spread across the board. In this state of being in a limbo, the dark horse is the bureaucrat who knows how to manipulate the weak politician with ease, donning the mask of an innocent. It is a sad and scary commentary on our times. The excuse trotted out is that these are the compulsions of a coalition. That is an eye wash. These are the compulsions of weak decisions, lack of political will as well as the astute ability to play politics.

 Suffering on tour

 Dangerous flights

Sir The Indian cricket team must be congratulated for putting up yet another inept batting display (India rattled and rolled for 91, Nov 23). The fact that all the Indian batsmen put together failed to equal the runs scored by a single South African player came as a shock. Jacques Kallis notched up 119 runs, while India were bowled out for 91, their lowest ever score against the Proteas. 

 Cricket is big business in the subcontinent. Indian cricketers earn in millions, but are not really bothered about their performance. The cricket board needs to put a stop to this. Indian players must be made accountable for their performance on the pitch. If a player does not perform, then he should be ready to take a cut in his payment. Perhaps this alone will ensure that our top-order batsmen find form. In case they continue to fail, new players should be drafted into the side. This is also the perfect time to decide on the fate of the coach, Greg Chappell. The team has had enough of his experiments, which have resulted in the team hurtling from one defeat to another.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The reasons for the debacle at Durban are many. But it will be enough to cite just two reasons to help us understand why India capitulated meekly against the South Africans in the second one day international. First, Indias undoing can be attributed to the batsmens inability to play on fast pitches. By now, every team knows that Indian batsmen are uncomfortable facing deliveries that bounce above knee level. Hence, when on tour, Indians are made to play on green tops that have pace and bounce. This one condition is enough to make the Indians quake in their boots when playing outside the subcontinent. Second, the timing of the day-night matches also has an adverse effect on the performance of Indian cricketers. We know that cricketers in India lead busy lives. They are often busy in activities such as modelling and brand endorsement, which take a heavy toll on their bodies. One cannot really expect our players to win matches after putting in so much of hard work. In fact, it is a miracle that the Indian players managed to survive nearly thirty overs to score 91. If one has to act in ad-films, walk the ramp and play cricket too, a total of just 9 runs should be considered as a fair return for the meagre remuneration paid by the board.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ghose,

 Flight unsafe

 Sir Despite the measures undertaken by the authorities to enhance security at the airports, one cannot rule out the possibility of a terror strike inside the premises (FBI activates hijack alarm, Nov 13). If a fidayeen were to detonate a bomb or drive an explosive-laden vehicle inside the airport, the loss to life and property would be considerable. A gunfight between the security officials and the terrorists would only add to the civilian casualties. 

 A better way of securing the airports is by installing concrete barriers under the ground which can be raised or lowered as and when required. These would be able to cut off suspicious-looking vehicles a long way from the airport premises. At other times, they would be hidden and would not inconvenience airport-bound traffic. At a time when terror strikes have become common all over the world, it makes sense for the authorities not to compromise with standards of public safety.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The authorities are busy raising the safety levels at the airports all over the country. This is largely because of the fact that al Qaida has now decided to target Indian airports. Unfortunately, such threats have changed the nature of air travel. Whether one boards a domestic or an international flight, every journey is now fraught with risks. Deputing air marshals on board is not enough. Destroying the spectre of terror is the only way one can make journeys on planes a safe proposition. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Ugly truth

 Sir The report, On Tomato diet, model dies (Nov 18), should come as a warning to aspiring models who want to stay thin in order to earn a living. Most of the top models in the country work hard to stay beautiful. But this is often achieved at the cost of their health.

 Beauty in the modern world is a commodity that can be tailor-made to suit the market. The prevailing patriarchal norms have also ensured that only slim and fair women have the right to be labelled as beautiful. Consequently, women in the entertainment industry are asked to not put on weight so that they continue to look their best. 

 Most young women want to follow in the footsteps of these models. They get carried away by their desire to remain beautiful for ever. In the process, they often do not have the time to stop and think what they are doing to themselves. It is a pity that models have to sacrifice their lives to make the fashion industry understand that beauty can never be more important than health.

 Yours faithfully,

Tutun Mullick,

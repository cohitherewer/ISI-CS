 THOSE TERRIBLE TWINS

 Gwynne Dyer

 I am afraid that with Jaroslaw Kaczynski as prime minister, Poland will become more extreme, more anti-European and a more xenophobic country, warned Bronislaw Komorowski, a member of the opposition Civic Platform party, when the second Kaczynski twin was made prime minister by his brother, President Lech Kaczynski, in July. He could have added that Poland is becoming more anti-Semitic, more homophobic, and much more vengeful towards former communists and collaborators.

 The Kaczynski twins, chubby 57-year-olds whose baby faces remind everyone that they first shot to fame as child actors in the 1960s, are identical in both their appearance and their politics. They are nationalist, catholic, and conservative, which is why they appeal to the left-behinds of Polish society, who provided most of the votes for their Law and Justice Party last year. Then Lech, who had taken over the presidency, appointed Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz as prime minister, but replaced him with Jaroslaw soon after.

 The campaigns most prominent victim is former president, Wojciech Jaruzelski, who declared martial law in 1981 and jailed about ten thousand Solidarity members. Jaruzelski has always claimed that he did it only to forestall a Soviet invasion that would have ended in a national disaster. Most of Solidaritys former leaders now accept Jaruzelskis justification for his decision, though they spent years in jail because of it. Former president Lech Walesa, Solidaritys founder, was publicly reconciled with Jaruzelski last year in a joint television appearance. But Jaruzelski is now charged with being the head of an organised criminal group which aimed to perpetrate crimes that consisted of the deprivation of freedom by internment, and he faces a possible eleven years in jail. Hundreds of thousands other Poles also face reprisals under the new law introduced by the Kaczynskis.

 Lords of misrule

 Under the old rules, members of parliament, judges, top civil servants and security officials were required to state whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police, but they were not automatically banned from those jobs. Under the new law, all persons in positions of public trust who were over seventeen when Solidarity finally brought down the communists in1989, including diplomats, local officials, school principals, lawyers and journalists, will lose their jobs if they cannot produce a certificate (to be issued by the Institute for National Remembrance) showing that they were not collaborators. Similar things happened in other countries of the former Soviet bloc just after the communist regimes were swept away by the revolutions of 1989, though nothing so extreme. But to institute such a witch-hunt 17 years later, when most of the targets of this revenge are retired or nearing the end of their working lives, is vindictive and pointlessly destructive.

 It is the same resentful obsession with past wrongs that caused president Kaczynski to cancel a visit to Germany recently after a German newspaper satirized him as a potato-head. It gives rise to demands that Poland erect a memorial to the 1940 massacre at Katyn, in which Soviet troops murdered at least 15,000 Polish reserve officers, directly across the street from the Russian embassy. It turns a blind eye to anti-Semitism, gay-bashing and other relics from the darker parts of Polands past.

 Two million young Poles over five per cent of the population have left the country for greener pastures in Western Europe since the EU membership made it easy for them to move. The 17 per cent unemployment rate, the highest in the EU, also gave them a big incentive to go. There is another Poland, but quite a lot of it is currently living abroad.

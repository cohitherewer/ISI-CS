 CONSERVING CRICKET

 - Only an interventionist board can make Test cricket survive

 I spend more time than an adult should trying to work out how many Test matches and series Rahul Dravids Indian team will have to win to qualify as different from or better than Indian teams gone by. I re-read, with gloomy dj vu, an article I had written in the run up to the last World Cup. I had tried to assess the Indian teams chances of lifting the trophy under the aegis of that justly celebrated management firm, Ganguly amp; Wright. Messrs G amp;W nearly pulled off that heist and look where it got them: inside two years of that World Cup final, every stakeholder in Indian cricket, from the BCCI to Cricinfo, had joined forces to nudge Wright into retirement and Ganguly, poor wretch, found himself in the same position as Charles I immediately after Cromwells coup: dethroned, though not yet beheaded. 

 Are Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell going to make India a consistently successful team? Ive no idea. Will they win the Champions Trophy now and the World Cup next year? Who knows. What I do know is that even if they do, the victory will do nothing to change the condition of Indian cricket for the better. If you are worried, as I am, about the health of Test cricket, winning the World Cup might make things worse. 

 Over the last two decades, the financial health of world cricket has become increasingly dependent on the Indian hunger for the game. The critical challenge facing crickets establishment is the relative decline of Test cricket and the likelihood that the five-day game will become ever more marginal to the financial well-being of the game. As David Runciman wrote in the London Review of Books, the extraordinary Ashes series in 2005 wasnt a new dawn, it was more like a last hurrah. The reason, he explained, was the fact that international crickets centre of gravity had shifted to the subcontinent, where the one-day game was hugely more popular. 

 I am not suggesting that the quality of Test cricket has declined. It has never been more competitive or more exciting. Its run-rate is exceptional, the draw is nearly extinct. But for the viewing public it is no longer the default form: in that, it has been replaced by the one-day international. The evidence for the dominance of ODIs is everywhere. One of the most exciting Test series in recent times was the one played out between India and Pakistan in Pakistan in 2004. It was a closely fought contest which ended 2-1 in Indias favour. Nobody came to the stadium to watch. There were more visiting Indian fans in the terraces than there were natives. But the attendance at cricket grounds, or the lack of it, isnt Test crickets main problem: the real danger are the preferences of crickets couch potatoes. To adapt the words of an eminent Victorian, a spectre is haunting Test cricket, the spectre of television. 

 First, credit where its due. Television has done more to educate and popularize Test cricket than any other force. The nuance and subtlety of Test cricket has become available to all of us thanks to the astonishing sophistication of television coverage. ESPN and Star Sports have treated us to archival footage for which no thanks is enough. But the fact remains that all cricket now is paid for by television revenues. And there are many more eyeballs to sell for ODIs than there are for Test cricket. 

 A few months ago, the cricket producer for one of the main sports channel told me that it was easier and more profitable to sell commercial time for ODIs than it was for Test matches. He loved Test cricket but as far as business went, it was a no-contest: one ODI could raise more advertising money than a whole Test match. He said that the money television channels made from ODIs was effectively cross-subsidizing the cost of covering Test Match cricket. During a television show, an official from the Delhi cricket association defended his preference for ODIs. It was what the public wanted, he said, and whatever else I thought of his arguments, there was no contradicting that. 

 ODIs are no longer tacked on to Test series. Increasingly, India tours and hosts other countries for the sole purpose of playing limited-overs cricket. Indias last tour of South Africa was a case in point. Players increasingly make their international debuts in ODIs and then leverage their performances in the short version of the game to push their way into Test cricket. Celebrity and the commercial endorsements that accompany it are increasingly the prerogative of those who represent India in ODIs; being in the Test team is an optional extra. Yuvraj Singh and M.S. Dhoni are outstanding examples of this tendency. V.V.S. Laxman is an instance of the process in reverse: how being dropped from the one-day side can lead to instant eclipse, even for a player of extraordinary gifts who has played one of the greatest Test innings of all time. 

 Runciman is right when he notes that Most Indian cricket fans would far rather their team win the next World Cup than that they become the number one team in Test cricket. When India beat Australia in their epic three-Test encounter of 2001, the visitors then stayed on for a five-match series of one-day games, which threatened to overshadow what had gone before (especially since India lost 3-2), and gives a good sense of where the Indian administrators priorities lie. 

 It has been suggested that the BCCI, despite its incompetence, its shamateur officials, and its corrupt politics, could help the cause of Indian cricket by simply getting out of the way of progress. Progress here is cast in broadly laissez faire terms: economic liberalization, the de-regulation of the media, the geyser of revenue tapped by television commercials, have, it is argued, created a new climate of performance and reward in which talent will flourish even without leadership from the BCCI. 

 This is a reasonable view if were talking about the health of limited-overs cricket. If cricket is left to the economic imperatives of the television market, Test crickets share of the Indian calendar will dwindle into insignificance. The BCCI in the era of Jagmohan Dalmiya, and now Sharad Pawar, has done everything possible to maximize television revenues by promoting the one-day game at the expense of Test cricket. There was a year, for example, when the Indian team barely played half-a-dozen tests. The dodginess of the BCCIs procedures and its squabbles with television companies shouldnt obscure the simple truth that the coffers of honorary officialdom and the balance sheets of television companies both stand to gain hugely from the ascendancy of limited-overs cricket. 

 For Test cricket to survive and prosper, we need an interventionist board that will play the market and temper its profit-milking logic to create a stable environment for Test cricket. The cricket boards of England and Australia have nurtured the longer game by keeping Test cricket front and centre in their calendars, by doing everything possible to ticket, schedule and market Test matches efficiently, by making sure (in the case of Australia and, till recently, in England) that Tests were telecast free to air so that they reached the largest possible audience. Sustaining Test cricket in India might be harder because ODIs have been such a large part of our television diet, but it needs to be done, for reasons that neednt be elaborated, for those who love the long game, but for the sake of conserving cricket, for those who dont. Think of Test cricket as a tropical rain forest that nurtures a diversity of things that have been bred out of the monoculture that is one-day cricket. 

 As crickets yellow bible once nearly asked: For what does it profit a fan to gain the World Cup but suffer the loss of his games soul?

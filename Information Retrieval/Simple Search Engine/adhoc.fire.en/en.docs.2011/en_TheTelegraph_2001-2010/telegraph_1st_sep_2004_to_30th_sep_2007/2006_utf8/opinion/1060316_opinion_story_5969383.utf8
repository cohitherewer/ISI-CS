 SWEETER PILL

 Jessica Lal?s shadow is a long one. It darkened the tone of the prime minister?s address at the conference of chief ministers and high court chief justices recently, although neither Mr Manmohan Singh nor the chief justice of India, Mr Y.K. Sabharwal, referred to it directly. The Lal murder case epitomized everything that is wrong with the justice system in India. What is, perhaps, more important, was the public ire at its outcome. That public feeling could be made known so clearly and so fast is the best indication of the changes that electronic communication has wrought. So the context was exactly right for the prime minister to talk about judicial reform, which, he said, should keep pace with changed times and economic reform. This needs concrete steps. He proposed an all India judicial service, which would provide a mode for judges? self-scrutiny while ensuring their independence. Corruption among the judiciary was a serious concern with both Mr Singh and the CJI. Delay and backlogs would be addressed through more fast-track courts and village nyayalayas on the one hand, and by hooking up courts electronically and appointing more judges on the other.

 But there are other hurdles to the smooth delivery of justice, and more distractions than are desirable. Mr Singh?s suggestion that judicial activism be restrained and the public interest litigation used sparingly is the closest that the executive has come to formally addressing the troublesome issue of judicial intervention. While the PIL was once a useful tool for rectifying public ills, the ?pendulum?, felt the prime minister, may have swung to the other extreme. Today it may cause ?obstruction?, ?delay? or even ?harassment?. It has often seemed in recent times that courts are more interested in imposing their ideas of the public good through the vehicle of PILs. Mr Singh?s remarks recalled the distinction between the duties of the judiciary and the executive. The courts are there to ensure that the law is followed; their job should not take them beyond the legalities of an issue. The delicate balance of the democratic structure relies on the rigour with which its different segments ? the executive and the judiciary being two of them ? confine themselves to their defined tasks. Conservatism in this is the only way to ensure the polity?s health.

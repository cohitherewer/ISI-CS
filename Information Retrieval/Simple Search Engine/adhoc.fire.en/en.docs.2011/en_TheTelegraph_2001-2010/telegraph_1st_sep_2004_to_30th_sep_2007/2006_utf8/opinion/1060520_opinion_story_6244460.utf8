 A BREACH OF TRUST

 New Delhi needs to show more commitment to the Naga cause for the peace talks to succeed in Amsterdam, writes Tapan Bose

 United force

 When I met Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of National Socialist Council of Nagalim in April in Bangkok, I asked him whether NSCN (Isak-Muivah) would agree to the extension of the Indo-Naga ceasefire beyond August 2006. He laughed and asked me to name the substantive achievements of the nine-year ceasefire. I have known Muivah over two decades. He is a man of high principles, deep commitment and honesty. He faced many political and military challenges, endured personal loss and pain without admitting defeat. 

 The Muivah I met in Bangkok was a sad man. He said, ?Bose, we have got only platitudes and advice to be patient?. Every Indian prime minister he met assured him of New Delhi?s awareness of the ?uniqueness of the history of the Naga people? and the firm commitment to do ?justice? to the Nagas this time. He is now convinced that New Delhi does not care about the Nagas. They did not care about the history of the Nagas, he said. Otherwise they would have appreciated the historic desire of the Naga people to live together. ?The right to the divided people to live together is recognized all over the world, but almost all Indian political parties are against the unification of Naga homelands?, he said.

 The traditional homelands of the Naga people were divided into different administrative units by British imperialists. It was a part of their policy of divide and rule. In addition, parts of Naga homelands ? Chandel, Churachandpur, Senapati, Tamenglong and Ukhrul were gifted to Raja Gambhira Singh of Manipur as a reward for his support to the British during their expedition in the Chin Hills of present-day Myanmar.

 Muivah stated that after young men and women went on rampage in Manipur and attacked local politicians, the prime minister told him that as a democratic country, India could not ignore the sentiments of the people of Manipur. Muivah interpreted this as New Delhi?s surrender to the pressure of the coalition partners who owe their political fortunes to the ?majorities? in these states. Ironically, the discrimination faced by the Nagas in Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh did not seem to bother ?democratic? India.

 In 1993, general S. Roy Chowdhury had apparently advised Prime Minister Narasimha Rao to move away from over reliance on a military approach to the Naga problem, and to develop a political strategy to resolve the cause of Naga self-determination. The late Rajesh Pilot, then minister in the home ministry, was the first interlocutor. Pilot was able to get the NSCN leadership to meet Narasimha Rao in Europe. He also extended his services to Deve Gowda after the change of government. The secret ?talks for holding talks? continued till 1997. Finally an understanding was reached, which said that the Indo-Naga talks would be held at the highest level; that there would be no pre-conditions attached to the talks and all political issues would be discussed; the talks would be held only between the government of India and the NSCN (I-M); and, finally, the talks would be held outside India.

 On July 31 1997, the president of the NSCN (I-M) announced a ceasefire with Indian forces for one year. Prime Minister Inder Gujral reciprocated on the floor of the Lok Sabha the same day. In answer to a question by a member of parliament about the geographical spread of the ceasefire, the prime minister clarified that the area was limited to the territory of Nagaland state. However, the NSCN pointed out that as the two forces were engaged in hostile activities in all the Naga-inhabited areas of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Manipur, therefore limiting the ceasefire only to the territory of Nagaland would defeat the very objective of this initiative and it would fail to create a conducive atmosphere for the peace talks. Initially the Indian interlocutors told the NSCN that the prime minister?s reference to Nagaland was a mistake and it would be corrected soon.

 However, Gujral did not make a mistake. He told an editor of a national daily that the extension of the ceasefire beyond Nagaland would have created problems. In 2002, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee confirmed this when he told the NSCN (I-M) that he could not extend the ceasefire to all Naga-inhabited areas formally. However, he promised that the ceasefire would be observed on the ground in all Naga-inhabited areas.

 ?What have we got Bose?? asked Muivah. Before I could answer the question, he said, ?New Delhi wants to keep us engaged in meaningless talks while plotting to take away even what was agreed in the so-called 1964 and 1975 agreements?. In both the agreements, New Delhi was committed to resolve the unification issue through dialogue. The 1964 agreement was rejected by the Naga National Council headed by Adino Phizo. The 1975 Shillong agreement was rejected by a section of NNC and NSCN was formed. And the Naga people?s struggle for independence continued.

 The NSCN (I-M) is the first Naga organization to have built a national consensus among the disparate Naga groups to find a permanent solution within a ?federal framework?. But if New Delhi is not even willing to address the issue of unification of Naga inhabited areas, I wonder whether there will be another extension of the ceasefire. Indian negotiators are due to meet Muivah and others in Amsterdam in June. Would they be carrying a new message from the prime minister, Manmohan Singh and his political colleagues? The future of the current ceasefire certainly depends on that.

 PROTECTION WHERE IT IS NOT DUE

 No matter how radical the EC?s display of armed power may appear, it may be a result of some misplaced zeal, writes Sumanta Sen

 K.J. Rao checking voters? lists in West Midnapore

 After their sixth successive drubbing in the assembly elections in West Bengal, opposition leaders had gone on record demanding that the next polls in the state should be under military supervision. Well, this time they should feel happy. The demand has largely been met, with the Election Commission making arrangements for an unusual deployment of paramilitary forces. 

 The Maoists have created problems in the tribal-dominated areas of three districts but to counter them, the EC has taken measures that may actually frighten away the voters from the booths. Similar measures had been taken in Bihar a few months ago and the percentage of votes cast there was below fifty. Can democracy be kept alive by scaring away voters with a display of armed power?

 Such display is always accompanied by the problem of misplaced zeal. The forces brought from other states invariably feel nervous at doing duty in ?alien? territory, particularly since they are repeatedly told that the people around them may well be ?enemies?. They feel jittery all the time and may use their firearms at the slightest hint of trouble. This is not idle speculation. One has seen this happening in the North-east with serious repercussions. Even today, Manipur is seething with resentment against such law-enforcers and so are parts of Assam. In West Bengal, in the early Seventies, the combing operations against Naxalities in Calcutta and elsewhere by paramilitary forces had caused people to wonder whether they were actually living in a free country.

 The EC would, of course, insist that the situation does not allow it to take any chances. But at the same time, can it dispute the argument that a show of might on polling day is against the spirit of democratic functioning? It must also be taken into account that so far, the Maoists have given no indication that they would disrupt the polls in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. And why should they? They would rather work for the defeat of the Left Front.

 Of course it must be said that the EC?s bandobast was in keeping with the pleas from the state government for additional security forces. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had been clearly nervous after the Maoist attacks on his party workers. It would, however, not be out of place to remind him that in Tripura, the late Nripen Chakravarti had made similar appeals in 1988. The Centre had responded and the CPI(M) had lost after being in office for ten years. People in the state later said that the forces had kept voters away from the booths. This may not happen in the much larger state of West Bengal where depredations are confined to small pockets only. But Marxists are supposed to take history seriously.

 Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore go to the polls on April 17, the first phase. What happens in the next four phases? Do the Central forces remain to frighten the workers of the ruling alliance? One is not being subjective while asking this question as it appears that in the name of creating a level playing field, the supervisory body is tilting a bit towards the opposition. The opposition wanted the army deployed in all the 294 constituencies. Even if the situation does not demand it, will there, therefore, be a near-army presence in Hooghly, Birbhum, Burdwan and other districts also, particularly if the display of strength has the ?desired? effect in the first phase?

 If the unusual presence of paramilitary forces raises questions, so also must the latest diktat that all hoardings and banners highlighting the government?s achievements must be pulled down. At polling time, it is natural for the ruling party to announce its achievements, and the best way to do that is through hoardings and banners. Where was the EC when the National Democratic Alliance had gone to town with its ?India Shining? campaign two years ago? 

 The worthies at the EC?s office may argue that since the achievements would in any case be highlighted at rallies, the people would get to hear of these in any case. But is listening to speeches at rallies and reading a hoarding or banner at one?s leisure the same thing? The latter undoubtedly offers a greater chance of assimilation. Also, there appears to be no ban on opposition parties rubbishing the government?s claims through similar means. True, the tomtoming of achievements does give an advantage to the ruling party or formulation but that advantage had been gained when it won a democratic election five years ago.

 That advantage can of course be offset by the incumbency factor. That the opposition in West Bengal has never been able to use it seems to indicate one of two things: either such a factor is too negligible to be of any use in the state or the parties in the opposition are too incompetent to use it. The opposition, of course, maintains that it cannot take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor because of the muscle-power of the ruling party. Now that the EC has arranged for such a security cover, the opposition should have no problem, unless they discover after the polls that the gun-toting men had scared away their voters too. Indeed, their present glee at lakhs of names being struck off the rolls may turn into sorrow ? who knows whose supporters are being disenfranchised? 

 Also who can help the opposition in the state unless it helps itself? It is no use talking of it being in a shambles, politically and organizationally, as it is all too well known. In their various representations to the EC, the opposition parties have also made it clear that most government employees and teachers are not with them and so should be kept out of the election process. So who are with the opposition? Surely not the majority of the workers and peasants? And those who are with the opposition must be amazed at the sight of the leader of the biggest opposition party continuing to woo the Congress even though the latter has made its position clear. In the meantime, something that has never happened earlier is happening: her workers in some districts are deserting her for, wonder of wonders, the CPI(M). On its part, the Congress presents the familiar picture of a divided house and even the Bharatiya Janata Party, desperate to make its presence felt in the state, has rumblings within its ranks on the issue of nominations.

 So it must be the EC who has to come to their aid. The remarks made by some of them (?This time it will be an election with a difference?) must have been music to the opposition?s ears. But then god helps them who help themselves. The EC can only do so much and no more. If this realization has not already dawned on these parties, then it should, even at this late stage. It should also be remembered that the left?s preparation for the election had begun immediately at the end of the last election in 2001.

 Incidentally, what is a former Maoist, Ashim Chatterjee, doing contesting a Calcutta seat with Trinamool Congress support? This is certainly a Great Leap for him. Whether it is ?forward? or backward, only time will tell.

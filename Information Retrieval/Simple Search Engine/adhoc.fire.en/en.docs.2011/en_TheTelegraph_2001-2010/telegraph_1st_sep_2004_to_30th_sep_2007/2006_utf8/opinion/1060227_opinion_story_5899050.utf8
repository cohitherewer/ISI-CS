 THE CAUSES OF A MALADY

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Inhibitions to effective labour inspection of child labour : Lack of political will. Notwithstanding their obligations under international standards, a major obstacle to labour inspection in many countries is the lack of political support. This is often expressed in state budget allocations; in many developing countries, the whole labour administration system receives less than 1 per cent of the national budget; sometimes, it is a mere 0.1 per cent. 

 Labour inspection services in turn receive only a fraction of that sum. This is in stark contrast to the fact that the cost to the State of poor labour protection, in the form of accidents, illnesses, absenteeism, abusive exploitation, industrial conflict and the like, is in many countries in excess of 5 per cent of total GDP. There is substantive evidence that an effective and efficient labour inspection system can significantly reduce these losses. Strong political support for labour inspection and commitment to standards...in the last ten years, has made a measurable difference in the performance of their labour inspectorates, and therefore in the reduction of socio-economic losses, at both macro and micro levels. Although labour inspectors may be convinced of the usefulness of their work, they have no control over the political and social environment in which they operate. It is hard for them to single out child labour abuse in workplaces where other labour regulations are being ignored.

 Labour inspectors are often frustrated because, on the one hand, they are asked to enforce the rules while, on the other hand, the underlying message is not to disrupt the economy. Lack of political will and therefore political support for inspectors when they meet resistance and defiance inevitably undermines their morale...as well as weakening their determination to achieve improvements.

 Shortcomings in the law: the need for reform. Political will and commitment must not only translate into adequate resources, they must first and foremost provide an appropriate policy framework and legal base for labour inspection. Large volumes of outdated, fragmented and increasingly complex regulations effectively impede labour inspection....In some countries, the labour code alone contains several thousand articles, supplemented by even larger numbers of parallel or subsidiary regulations. This is true of child labour provisions, which are often found in several different laws and are sometimes inconsistent with each other. With inconsistencies and gaps in the law, varying minimum ages, confusing and different definitions... explaining and ultimately enforcing such requirements becomes for labour inspectors difficult and at times virtually impossible. Inspectors may also be required to master thousands of technical and legal standards in the area of safety and health alone, an impossible task that often results in inertia or stagnation.

 Many countries have streamlined their regulatory framework,weeding out contradictory, often overlapping or outdated regulations and standards. Others have mandated all their regulatory agencies to make the legislation more easily understandable... and this has contributed in no small degree not only to a better understanding by employers of what is required of them, and thus improved compliance with the law, but also to more effective supervision of compliance by labour inspectors.

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 One of the difficulties in eliminating child labour or improving the working conditions of minors is that the work often takes place in the informal sector. If labour inspection activities are planned solely on the basis of the official registers of businesses, they will cover only a fraction of the establishments in the country. And it is not often that any significant number of child workers will be found in these officially registered businesses, at least in industrializing countries.

 In some countries only registered...urban enterprises are monitored. In such cases, inertia and limited resources may inhibit inspectors from fulfilling their advisory and enforcement function...in the informal sector of the economy. In these circumstances it is often difficult to track down cases of child labour. If inspectors are able to extend their action beyond registered businesses, however, they are more likely to succeed in identifying areas employing child workers.

 Since most incidences of child labour occur in the informal sector...in home-based activities carried out by the childrens families or, as in the case of domestic service, in ?invisible? workplaces such as the childs own or someone elses home, they are very difficult ? indeed often legally impossible to reach by inspectors. They face problems of legal intervention in such informal work situations, not to speak of the practical problem of gaining access to shifting workplaces in the informal sector (e.g., the street).

 In most countries, the law provides that when workers live and work on the same premises, the occupiers permission is required before those premises may be entered. If permission is refused, there is usually little the inspector can do, despite the fact that a large number of people may be involved whose conditions of work could be quite unsatisfactory. Indeed, often this requirement is abused for the very purpose of hiding illegal forms of employment, including child labour from the inspectors intervention.

 Lack of understanding of the inspectors role : The difficulties involved when people are living in scattered private dwellings provide considerable scope for fraud. It also happens that the people whom the inspector is there to protect do not fully understand what inspection is about, or are too frightened to cooperate. In such circumstances, the inspector must rely on tact and powers of persuasion to win their confidence, obtain information and then take the necessary remedial action.

 The mere presence of a stranger, i.e. the labour inspector, might alert children working in agriculture and other sectors to disappear from the worksite. Labour inspectors therefore often need to act very quickly in order to be effective.

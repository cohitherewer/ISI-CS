 WHEN BOOKS BECOME BRANDS

 Publicity stunt

When all is said and done, Publishers have just one single objective that the book they have invested on brings in the returns as quickly as possible. Putting it bluntly, the book sells, whether it is read or not. Hence the massive publicity drive on the eve of publication point-to-point mailing to potential customers, review copies for the media, author interviews, excerpts to newspapers, some snippets to news columns so that it gets talked about, and in a few cases, launches at great expense in five-star hotels with the author and publisher reading extracts from some key chapters. But does all this sound and fury help sell more than it would otherwise or do the fundamental things apply as time passes by?

 Inside the editorial rooms, where the book is still a glint in the editors eye, opinion is sharply divided; most senior editors who have been in the game (and they tend to be conservative) believe that after the party is over there is no way to tell whether more copies sold because of the song and dance as there is no established correlation between publicity and sales. Marketing, on the other hand, believes that publicity helps to keep the name alive. Both are right in their own way: from a short term perspective, the editors are right because they have had to pay the bills, and marketing, from a longer view, because the brand image makes it easier for them to sell their books.

 But from an Indian perspective, it is the fundamental factors that matter. And these are: price, discounts to the trade, credit terms and other facilities (like whether the bookseller can return the unsold books after a period), easy availability, and the sales representatives personal equation with the trade.

 Contrary to what many academics who havent walked the streets from shop to shop believe, price is not a terribly important factor; the relevance, or the usefulness of the book (define usefulness any way you want) is much more important. Discounts are important for the retail trade one reason why low-priced books with meagre discounts, like NCERT textbooks, are not stocked by many retailers if there is no money in the deal, they are simply not interested. And it is because of low discounts that these books are not easily available, at least in the neighbourhood bookshop. Indian book buyers are not prepared to put in that extra mile to buy a book or browse through a bookshop. They dont have the intellectual stamina to do so.

 Finally, what matters is the sales representative who has to do the job. He has to walk the streets, meet the retailers, make sure the books are available, service his orders, and assure him that when things go awry, he is there to take care of the traders problems. It is he who has to walk the mean streets of the Indian book trade. 

 So, is the publicity so much wind and smoke? Not really. The book gets talked about and that helps in a way. But what matters is the actual slog day after day, from one bookshop to another. There is no getting away from leg work.

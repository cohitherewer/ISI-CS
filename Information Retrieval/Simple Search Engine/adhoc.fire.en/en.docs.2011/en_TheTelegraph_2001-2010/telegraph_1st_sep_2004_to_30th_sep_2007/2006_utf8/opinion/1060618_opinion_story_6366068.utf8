The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE DELHI ORDER

 Nobody minds working out of beautiful offices. Better still to be able to live in them forever, and for nothing. And certainly the best, when the house happens to be a Lutyens bungalow in Delhi. Leaders of important political parties, ministers and senior bureaucrats in India would know the grosser as well as the finer pleasures of such privilege. Hence, they would empathize when some of their peers are individually or collectively deprived of the use of these heritage buildings of the ?Delhi Order?. The axe is about to fall, this time, on political parties. The Centre has decided to obey the Supreme Court by asking parties to vacate their offices if these happen to be in the capital?s Lutyens Bungalow Zone. These parties ? among them the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party, Samajwadi Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal ? will be leased land elsewhere in the city by the government. But these addresses are not quite as grand as the Akbar and Ashoka Roads, Jantar Mantar or Lodhi Estate, where such bungalows have been sold for as much as Rs 100 crore. Naturally, this has provoked powerful sentiments among the ?displaced? party members ? mostly resentment expressed as nostalgia.

 There is no reason to sentimentalize such transitions. This is an entirely desirable move, and not just for the preservation of heritage. The Lutyens bungalows are invaluable historical treasures, even while they remain living structures and spaces. The Centre must think of how to look after them properly without turning them into mere ?heritage? buildings. But more importantly, this decision will also lead to better, and more sensible, governance. There is no justification for the government to be allotting houses or land to parties or elected representatives of the people, whatever their status within the polity. And the move should not stop at party offices. Such a feudal system of pri- vileges bestowed by the state, at taxpayers? expense, should be fundamentally re-examined. There is a direct line of continuity here from the granting of imperial favours during the raj to the later ?socialist? practice of using, say, the Forbidden City or the Kremlin for the use of party leaders and organizations according to the dictates of Mao or Stalin.

 There is something dubious, and potentially fractious, about even the ?reformed? land-leasing plans for the re-located parties. Setting up complicated land-allocation criteria based on the nature of representation in parliament does not fundamentally alter the role of the government in bestowing privileges. In fact, it only complicates the existing practice. The state should minimalize ? and modernize ? its involvement in improving the material comforts and prospects of its servants. The mansions of the raj should not be used to sustain another kind of empire.

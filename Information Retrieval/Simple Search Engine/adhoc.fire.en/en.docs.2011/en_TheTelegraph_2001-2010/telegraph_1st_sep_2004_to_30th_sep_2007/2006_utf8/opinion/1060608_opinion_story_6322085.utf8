 On the backfoot

 Sir ? The Supreme Court?s intervention forced the doctors protesting against the decision to have 27 per cent reservations for other backward classes in higher education to call off their 19-day strike (?Doctors pass strike baton?, June 1). But the question as to whether the apex court denied the striking doctors their right to protest remains as the medics have been forced to resume their duties. Those who had joined the protests are being described as irresponsible people who have no concern for ailing patients in need of help. Yet the state, which has been instrumental in thwarting the careers of these meritorious students, has been let off without a warning. The prime minister has assured the protesters that reservations will not be applied from the 2007 session, and the education infrastructure would be expanded to take care of the needs of OBC students . This, however, does not fully meet the demands of the protesters. It only goes to show that the government is incapable of formulating constructive policies to resolve the issue on quotas. An increase in seats will further burden the teachers who are already struggling to make ends meet on their paltry salaries. There will always be loopholes in the infrastructure for which the quality of education will suffer. The prime minister?s decision will surely put in place a reverse caste system in the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The doctors have rejoined work in the hope that justice will be done by the apex court. But the Manmohan Singh government is only lobbying for reservations to extend its OBC vote bank. The Supreme Court has become a mere puppet in the hands of our netas. If politicians can amend the Constitution to suit their own interests, they can also foster inequality in institutions through the system of reservation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The withdrawal of the strike by the junior doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences came as a major setback to the anti-reservation camp. The new reservation bill, instead of harnessing new talent, will, in fact, adversely affect the quality of the medical professionals. The government must give this issue serious thought, because the future of doctors from the general category is rather bleak. The fact that people in different parts of our country have unanimously voiced their protests against reservations stands testimony to the gravity of the situation. The government must review its decision as it may trigger a nationwide rebellion. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? Now that the Supreme Court has declared that it would look into the grievances of the striking doctors, some necessary measures need to be implemented. Rules should be framed to ensure that an OBC student can enjoy the fruits of reservation but other members of his family cannot make a claim on the same in the next five years. Moreover, students availing of this facility would not be permitted to take up jobs abroad unless he has worked in India for at least ten years. The government must also ensure that members of OBC families are not eligible for the reserved quota if their annual income is above the non-taxable limit for three consecutive financial years. 

 Certain other things should also be kept in mind. For instance, seats should be reserved for only those students who secure not less than ten per cent marks below the cut-off point fixed for general category candidates. The seats that are left after admitting the OBC candidates should be declared as open. If the Supreme Court keeps these suggestions in mind, it will live up to its impartial standards. However, one must agree that the best way to integrate the deprived sections into the mainstream is to provide them with free education. Perhaps that will rule out the possibility of reservations in specialized courses such as medicine. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Supreme Court is becoming increasingly proactive these days. Whether it is the divestment of HPCL or its indictment of Narendra Modi for the Gujarat pogrom, the apex court has stepped in repeatedly to voice its opinion on a wide range of issues. This time too, the protests against reservations were nipped in the bud as the court forced the striking doctors to join work.

 However, such judicial activism hints at a departure from the existent democratic norms. It is equally unfortunate that the United Progressive Alliance government runs to seek the advice of the Supreme Court on every single issue. In fact, non-governmental organizations have stated that people have more faith in the law than in their elected representatives. Is democracy failing to fulfil the country?s needs then? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 WAYS TO TREAT THE CITY BLIGHTS

 Remains of the day

 Ripping the Fabric: The Decline of Mumbai and its Mills By Darryl D?Monte, Oxford, Rs 595

 As the Industrial Revolution gained momentum in Britain in the 18th century, Indian textiles were no longer in demand there and India began to export raw cotton from Gujarat and its neighbouring regions to the new cotton mills in Manchester. As the port closest to the cotton growing areas of India, Bombay, now Mumbai, became the main export centre. 

 Historically, the shifting of the East India Company headquarters from Surat to Bombay, gave the city the status of an important trading centre of the world. While it was the port which gave the city its identity in the 19th century, manufacturing provided it sustenance for most of the succeeding decades. Textiles were the leading sector, though over the years chemicals, engineering, petrochemicals and electronics industries also developed. Bombay contributed immensely to India?s industrialization goal. 

 The chequered growth of Mumbai got a jolt in the late Seventies when the cotton mills began to decline steadily. Liberalization of the economy hastened this process. Consequent to the departure from protectionist policies of the past, workers were no longer secure in their jobs as production units began to trim operations or close down. India was unsettled by these far-reaching changes and Bombay, as the industrial capital, was particularly affected.

 Mills occupy around 500 acres of prime property in Mumbai. With the decline of the cotton mills, the re-development of the land they occupy has become a major urban policy issue. Darryl D?Monte in this book has tried to grapple with the issues of decline of the mills, sale and re-use of mill lands, plight of the workers, unclear government policies, the underworld-politician?mill owner nexus and so on.

 In recent years, private mills have surreptitiously gone for the sale of mill land. But the law regarding the sale process is far from transparent. Applications are made for ?vacant? land on mill sites when structures still exist. They are subsequently demolished to create vacant land. There is no official monitoring and no guarantee that part of the proceeds of the sale will be ploughed back into the welfare of the workers. This is a shocking example of dereliction of duty on the part of the authorities.

 In the absence of any public intervention, market forces alone will decide how Mumbai will grow in the coming decades. But decline in manufacturing industries and reduction in employment cannot be compensated for by a surge of jobs in the service and finance sector. Although the state government would like to project Mumbai as another Singapore or Hong Kong, the fact remains that in spite of the tall skyscrapers coming up in the mill compounds, more than half of Mumbai?s population lives in slums.

 D?Monte rightly asserts that only by reconciling the interests of all the different stakeholders, can the city can forge ahead. As to how this reconciliation can be achieved, he has a few suggestions. The land can be recycled, but the interest of the workers has to be protected. A quarter of the surplus mill land should be given to them, mill owners can sell workers loom at concessional rates and the mills can modernize their operations. While the alternatives are noble, the question is why should mill owners indulge the workers when there is the easy option of bribing the authorities, selling off assets at lucrative prices and washing hands off liabilities?

 The utopian suggestions apart, this is a serious work based on various case studies. As one of the first systematic studies of the city and its mills, the book will interest both general readers and researchers in business management, industrial economics and policy makers.

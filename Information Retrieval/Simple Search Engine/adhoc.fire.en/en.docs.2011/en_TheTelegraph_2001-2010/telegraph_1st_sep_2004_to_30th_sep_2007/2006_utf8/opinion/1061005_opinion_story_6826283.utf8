The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GET IT RIGHT

 Although the ministry of agriculture has not rung alarm bells, its first advance estimates of the kharif crop should cause acute alarm. It expects the output of coarse cereals and cotton to be 7 per cent and that of oilseeds to be 22 per cent below last year. Coarse cereals may worry no one because the poor are expected to eat wheat and rice nowadays. But shortage of cotton and edible oil could only mean imports. Given Indias large exchange reserves, that would be all right, but for the fact that the estimates are almost certainly hugely wrong. The heartland of kharif crop production especially, Gujarat, which produces most of groundnut and much of cotton received copious rains in August, so torrential as to cause the centurys worst floods in some parts. All that water has sunk into the soil and will give bumper harvests of dry crops. The reason why the ministry has got it all wrong is that it starts preparing estimates almost before the monsoon has arrived. Its crop estimation committee reviews the rains till the end of July, adjusts last years figures up or down and makes up a first estimate. It is an average committees average guess, based on early data. It may argue that the sowings are over by July and should give a good idea of the eventual crop. But monsoon rains in the west and the north are notoriously capricious, and the farmers are quite used to moving the date of sowing as well as changing the crop on their basis. There is a risk in late sowing, but less than the definite outcome of not sowing, namely, no crop. So the output of cotton, groundnut, sesame and bajra is likely to show a considerable rise this year. 

 These estimates matter only because they are the basis of policy. The government keeps reviewing such unreliable figures and pondering which commodities to import or export, and how much. The deliberations look even more important because interested industrialists queue up to lobby them. Right now, for instance, mill owners are lobbying the agriculture minister to let them export a million tons of sugar. Sensing that the government is making a convenient mistake, spinning mill owners will now start lobbying him to let them import cotton. Opposing him would be the minister of consumer affairs or commerce or finance whoever feels like jumping in.

 This is how frantic ministerial activity is generated over inconsequential policy issues. All these acrobatics would be unnecessary if the government reduced the prohibitive agricultural import duties and allowed free imports and exports. Trade would deal with shortages or surpluses far more expeditiously than the government ever can. The only role the government might then have would be to ensure sufficiency of domestic stocks; it can do so by giving cheap loans on inventories up to certain limits.

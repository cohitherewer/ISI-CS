 Letters to Editor

 Sticky wicket

 Sir It seems that the Pakistan cricket team is unable to stay clear of controversy (Pak in permanent crisis, Oct 17). The alleged drug abuse by Pakistani pacers, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, is a huge blow to their fans. But it is no secret that a globalized world has produced a tribe of men and women not ashamed of using unfair means to win. It seems that the cause of Akhtar and Asifs downfall was their overreaching ambition. In the past, people had more faith in fairer means that went well with a slower pace of life. But todays cut-throat competition makes even the strongest feel insecure. This must be the reason why sportsmen, including cricketers, want to achieve as much as they can before new-comers push them to the fringes. Nevertheless, both Akhtar and Asif have brought cricket in serious disrepute.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir It must be appreciated that the Pakistan Cricket Board disclosed the results of the urine tests of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. But the PCB should also note that players guilty of doping ought to be strictly dealt with so that younger players learn from their seniors mistakes. When Wasim Akram and three other Pakistanis were caught with marijuana in the West Indies in 1993, they were not penalized adequately: this set a bad example for the juniors who probably thought that they too would get away with similar acts. Given this history, the PCB should test all Pakistani cricketers for doping. The International Cricket Council should henceforth conduct even the random tests without notice in order to get the best results.

 Yours faithfully,

Gagan Chawla, Calcutta 

 Sir Steve Waugh, who enjoys a lot of goodwill in India, wants Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif to receive exemplary punishment if it is proved that they had indeed taken nandrolone. One would like to ask the former Australian skipper why he did not apply the same yardstick when his team-mate, Shane Warne, failed the dope test before the 2003 World Cup. Again, when Waughs twin brother, Mark, was involved in a controversy, he, along with others, had tried to dilute his brothers offence. But Mohammad Azharuddin and Hansie Cronje were banned for life for similar offences, and cricket lost two great players. The cricketing community must condemn such partiality on the part of Australians regardless of the verdict on Akhtar and Asif.

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada

 Sir After the worlds most successful bowler, Shane Warne, tested positive for drugs and was banned from international cricket for a year, it is now the turn of Pakistani players, Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif. The piling of one controversy on another implies that Pakistani cricket is indeed in deep trouble. Although the PCB is yet to announce the fate of the speedsters, one fears the worst. How Pakistan will fare in the Champions Trophy without the two pacers is the subject of much speculation, but it is to the teams credit that, in the face of so much trouble, they recorded a victory against the formidable Sri Lankans. Bob Woolmer and the stand-in captain, Younis Khan, must be given credit for getting the best out of the team amid such adversity.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Cricket is on the front pages once more, thanks to two Pakistani players testing positive for nandrolone, Herschelle Gibbs admitting to match-fixing, Inzamam-ul Haqs punishment in the Darrell Hair controversy, the BCCIs invitation to Mohammad Azharuddin and the furore over Harbhajan Singhs appearance in a liquor companys surrogate advertisement. What is clear from these incidents is that if a cricketer wants to get into trouble, he must, first of all, be from the subcontinent. If you are an Australian and admit to wrongdoing, you can continue playing. Even if you are accused of sexual harassment, as Shane Warne was, you can still get away with calling other people names. Pakistani pacers are charged with ball-tampering simply because they can reverse swing the ball. But if English players manage the same, then it is high art. The ICC must be congratulated on its hypocrisies.

 Yours faithfully,

Ajay K. Mandhyan, Jamshedpur

 Parting shot

 Sir For three successive years, The Telegraph has failed to remember the birthday of one of the greatest Indians ever. Readers were informed this September 26 that it is the birthday of Serena Williams, forgetting completely a man named Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar. It is unfortunate that American sports-stars are closer to us than our own great men.

 Yours faithfully,

Rajarshi Sengupta, Calcutta

 CHECK BEFORE YOU LEAP

 NEHA SAHAY

 The recent national committee meet of the Chinese People?s Political Consultative Conference, the country?s highest advisory body, held in Beijing wasn?t significant only because President Hu Jintao decided to do a Mao and enunciate his own eight-fold path for the masses. It also produced an interesting document, far removed from the usual platitudes about ?green development? and ?social harmony?, which have become the staple of these annual meets. It called for a return to the old ways in a very personal sphere. 

 Till 2003, all Chinese wishing to marry had to produce proof of a health check-up ?specially aimed at finding inherited and contagious diseases, including STDs, mental illness, and most recently, AIDS. In the past ten years, 10 per cent of urban and 13 to 15 per cent rural couples were diagnosed with various kinds of diseases in these check-ups. 

 In 2003, pre-marital health check-ups were made voluntary. All that was needed now was a ?non-intermarriage statement? signed by the boy and girl to prove that they were not closely related. Within three years of the change in rules, the results are there to see. In just one province, the rate of new-borns with congenital physical defects increased to 12.34 per 1,000 from the 2001 figure of nine per 1,000. Of all reported HIV/AIDS cases last year, mother-baby infections accounted for 1 per cent.

 New attitudes

 It is unclear why the rule was dropped. The only reason given was that it was an invasion of privacy, and didn?t gel with the new ?market-oriented? state. The average Chinese seemed to have been only too glad to get rid of this requirement. The rate of such check ups fell dramatically. One reason for this was that like everything else in the new economy, this too came at a price: ranging from 100 to 300 yuan. As in India, unscrupulous doctors seized the opportunity to insist on a whole lot of additional check-ups, pushing up the cost. 

 Another reason was the change in attitudes of the post-Mao generation. The very nature of the check-up was unacceptable to the new urban educated youth, though their parents may not have found anything objectionable about a rough physical check-up by someone in authority. A foreigner who underwent the check-up way back in 1992 recalled with a shudder its very public nature at that time: pelvic examinations of 10 women simultaneously in the same room; collecting one?s urine sample in the public loo and then carrying it all the way back in an open plastic cup. 

 Free to choose

 But the pendulum has now swung back: a CPPCC member proposed at the latest meet that the old rule be revived. He was supported by the director of women?s health, who pointed out that with even rural families spending 10,000 yuan on weddings, the check-up wasn?t too expensive. 

 However, it?s not going to be easy. Some provinces tried last year to reintroduce the compulsory check-up, but were foiled by their own local-level bureaucrats, who described the move as ?illegal?. From the heated debates on this issue, it appears that people, still distrustful of doctors, want the check-ups to remain voluntary, but free.

 Interestingly, some provinces and municipalities (including Beijing and Shanghai), have been farsighted enough to have introduced free check-ups, with strict rules for the doctors involved, and they?ve worked. In Beijing, the rate of such check-ups went up to 30 per cent from 8 per cent; in another province, the increase was more dramatic: from 2 per cent to 20 per cent. 

 Right now, a nationwide awareness campaign is on. There?s a lesson in this for India: but will our planners allow such generosity towards health?

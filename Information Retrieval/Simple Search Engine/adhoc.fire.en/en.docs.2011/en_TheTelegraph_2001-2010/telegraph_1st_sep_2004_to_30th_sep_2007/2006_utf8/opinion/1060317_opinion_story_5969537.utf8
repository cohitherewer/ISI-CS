 Laughing invitation to naughtiness

 Helen: The life and times of 

 an h-bomb (Penguin, Rs 275) by Jerry Pinto 

 is a delightful, intelligent and effortlessly well-researched 

 book about a French-Burmese refugee called Helen Richardson, 

 who walked to Assam from Rangoon in 1941, lived in Calcutta 

 for a while as the daughter of a struggling nurse, moved 

 to Bombay in 1947, became a chorus-girl in films in 1952, 

 and then forged for herself a kind of immortal iconhood 

 ? the cabaret-dancing vamp ?quite unparalleled in commercial 

 cinema. ?She entered a world dominated by North Indian men,? 

 writes Pinto, ?who had very definite notions about how women 

 should look and behave on-screen and she managed to redefine 

 those requirements.? Pinto?s book is an astute, but entertaining, 

 essay about evolving Indian attitudes to sex, dance, song, 

 women and pleasure. But it is also a warmly personal response 

 to a woman?s ?laughing invitation to naughtiness?, written 

 by someone who has never managed to meet her, but captures 

 in nuanced but unpretentious prose (no Film Studies twaddle), 

 ?the sheer transcendence of Helen?s personality?: ?By the 

 happy accident of retaining her Western name and inhabiting 

 a space that allowed mobility, Helen created a liberated 

 ? and liberating ? persona. She belonged totally to Hindi 

 cinema, she was its creation, but she seemed to be slightly 

 apart from it.? 

 Isla negra (Rupa, Rs 

 295) by Pablo Neruda is Alastair Reid?s parallel 

 text ? in Spanish and English ? of Neruda?s poetic autobiography. 

 Neither black nor an island, Isla Negra is a small village 

 above a stretch of sand on the Pacific coast of Chile, eighty 

 miles south of Valaparaiso where Neruda bought an old sea 

 captain?s house in 1939, to which he retreated to write 

 when he could. Neruda described this book as ?spinning the 

 thread of biography? that also captures ?each day?s joyous 

 or sombre feeling...a tale that strays off and then rejoins, 

 haunted by both the events of the past and by nature, which 

 keeps calling me with its numerous voices.? 

 Madhav amp; kama (IndiaInk 

 and Roli, Rs 195) is A.N.D. Haksar?s translation of 

 an ancient Indian love story, Madhavanala Katha. Part 

 of the katha literature of classical Sanskrit, this 

 story circulated orally before it was written down around 

 1422, after which several versions of it exist. This story 

 is also a part of the considerable Sanskrit literature about 

 the exploits of Vikramaditya, who features as the third 

 principal character, through whose extraordinary efforts 

 the two lovers are eventually reunited. 

 On nature and the environment 

 (Penguin, Rs 175) by J. Krishnamurti collects 

 excerpts from talks, dialogues, journals and letters from 

 the Forties to the mid-Eighties. Most of what Krishnamurti 

 has to say would sound either very profound or very banal, 

 depending on one?s attitude to the man and on the desperation 

 with which one needs spiritual guidance. ?If you lose touch 

 with nature you lose touch with humanity.?

 Street fighting years (Seagull, 

 Rs 525) by Tariq Ali is a reprint of the ?autobiography 

 of the Sixties? (1987) by this writer and film-maker, editor 

 of New Left Review, and a symbol of the radical spirit 

 of ?68. The epigraph to Ali?s new introduction is a poem 

 by Pasolini: ?oh unfortunate generation/ you?ll weep, but 

 lifeless tears/ because perhaps you won?t even know how 

 to return to what, not having had, you couldn?t even lose/...oh 

 unfortunate young people, who?ve seen within reach/ a marvellous 

 victory that didn?t exist!?

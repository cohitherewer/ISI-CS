 THEY POODLED 

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES thewordcageyahoo.co.uk

 Tony Blair is hardly Britains 

 favourite man. At home, his government and party have recently 

 been yet again up to their knees in sleaze. Abroad, 

 he is seen as too close by half to George Bush: lapdog, 

 poodle, toady, bagman, lackey 

 and flunkey are just some of the epithets aimed at 

 him in this context, plus several more best omitted from 

 a family newspaper.

 Yet credit where credit is due. 

 Albeit as its victim, not its originator, Blair has given 

 the English language a new verb: to poodle. More 

 exactly, a new meaning: the verb exists, but in other senses, 

 ones that Ive never met in use. My dictionary tells me 

 it has in the past meant to clip a dog to look like a 

 poodle; and my London-born wife tells me of a moribund 

 colloquial usage, poodle along, meaning go gently. 

 But now it has an apt, up-to-the-minute meaning.

 Mr Blair, sneered the leader of 

 Britains opposition Tories recently, was too busy poodling 

 to Bush to attend to some other business. Another Tory 

 promptly employed the term as a plain intransitive verb, 

 with no to and indirect object: in accepting Britains 

 new, notoriously unequal, extradition treaty with the United 

 States of America, he said simply, we poodled.

 By nice coincidence, one may think, 

 this kind of shift from noun to verb is typically American. 

 So, at least, lament those who dislike it. They are right, 

 but only half-right: in fact, the shift is common also in 

 British English, indeed in most peoples English. As with 

 other things cars, electoral spending and bombs come to 

 mind Americans have just carried the habit further, faster 

 than the rest of us.

 Muses smile on us

 Thus it was they who first chose 

 to action some plan, or trial some drug; usages 

 today widely adopted in Britain. These two still grate on 

 your wordcagers elderly ears. Yet, after long hesitation, 

 he is by now perfectly happy to access files in his 

 computer; just as, 40 years ago, he used to phone, 

 cable or telex a story to his newspaper, later 

 to fax it, and now to e-mail it. Every one 

 of those verbs began life as a noun.

 So did countless others; back 

 in Blair territory, to toady, flunkey, kowtow 

 and to parrot among them. Read any page of prose 

 with this thought in mind, and youll find umpteen such 

 verbs, many so familiar that you never noticed until you 

 made the experiment both notice and (as a verb) 

 experiment being examples. To blame all this on American 

 idiom is as sensible as crediting the Mississippi with filling 

 the Atlantic Ocean.

 It is sometimes hard to know which 

 came first, noun or verb: usually, the noun, Id guess, 

 to judge from the number of very common nouns partnered 

 by much rarer verbs. For instance: head, scalp, 

 eye, nose, mouth, jaw, neck 

 (a Twenties to Fifties version of todays smooch), 

 back, shoulder, elbow, hand, 

 palm (off), finger, thumb, stomach, 

 leg, knee, foot, heel and toe. 

 Or, if you prefer, house, roof, floor, 

 wall (up or in), nail, screw, 

 hammer and saw. And much else.

 How fortunate our language is 

 that can do such things, with complete freedom and no need 

 to alter even one letter of the spelling (though there is 

 a curious shift of stress with some latinate dissyllables 

 such as convert or reject). No other tongue 

 known to me has this freedom; certainly none in Europe. 

 The Muses smile on us. Are we to frown and 

 sneer?

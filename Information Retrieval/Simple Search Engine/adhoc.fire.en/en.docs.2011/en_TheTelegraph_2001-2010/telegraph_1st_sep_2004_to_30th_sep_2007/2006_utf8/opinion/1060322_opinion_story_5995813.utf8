The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GO WITH GRACE

 An institution is always bigger than the individual who makes it. This simple principle, obvious at first sight, escapes many Indian institution-builders who begin to look upon their creations as their own fiefdom. In so doing, they do themselves a terrible disservice. This is the moral of the incident that led to the resignation of Mr Verghese Kurien as chairman of the Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation. Mr Kurien established the GCMMF and made what has come to be called India?s white revolution. The making of this revolution and the success of the brand called Amul have all the dimensions of a fairy tale. Mr Kurien started out his operations from a garage and went on to build a farmers? cooperative worth Rs 3,600 crore and to make Amul one of the best known brands in India. But this success, remarkable as it undeniably is, cannot justify the fact that Mr Kurien remained chairman for thirty three years even though he was 84 years old. His success should have made his exit gracious and dignified. In fact, the opposite happened. He resigned only when it became clear that the board of directors of GCMMF would oust him from his post. Mr Kurien quit before he was made to quit.

 Mr Kurien?s pathetic plight is self-inflicted. This is evident from the fact that his own prot?g?, Ms Amrita Patel, chairperson of the National Development Board, is completely estranged from him. The reason for this estrangement and other similar ones is the same: Mr Kurien?s refusal to step down and to allow the infusion of new ideas. Mr Kurien, for example, remained steadfastly opposed to the idea of corporatizing cooperatives. He has alleged that a conspiracy has been hatched to remove him. He refuses to reflect on the fact that he had no business to hang on to his post for over three decades. His ego became part of the institution he built. This is suggested by his statement that his departure will be followed by disaster. If indeed that happens, it will be the strongest indictment of Mr Kurien since it will prove that he failed to build an institution. He should just hold his peace and go with grace. History will remember his contribution to modern Indian life.

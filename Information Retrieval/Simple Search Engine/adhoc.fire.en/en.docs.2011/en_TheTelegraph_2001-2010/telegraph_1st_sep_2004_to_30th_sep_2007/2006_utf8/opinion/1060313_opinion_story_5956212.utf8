 WALL OF WORRY

 Bulls will point to the 217-point drop in the Sensex on Wednesday, and its subsequent climb to an all-time high within two days, as evidence of the remarkable resilience of the Indian market. They could be right. India is one of the few emerging markets that are still in positive territory this month, after a bout of concern about rising long-term interest rates in the United States of America increased risk aversion and shook markets around the world. The selling by foreign institutional investors in the future market, which led to the panic on Wednesday, is now being described as nothing more than hedging. FII net inflows into the cash market have remained strong. Furthermore, new equity fund offers have raked in thousands of crores in the last couple of months and all that money, when invested, will provide a cushion to the market. 

 The strange thing about this rally, however, is that practically all the experts seem to be warning about increasing risk. They have pointed out that the Indian market is one of the most expensive in Asia, corporate earnings growth is decelerating and that interest rates are moving up. Over the last couple of thousand points, in particular, the markets have been climbing a wall of worry. The reason, of course, is a constant inflow of liquidity ? every investor in the world seems to want a slice of India. Nevertheless, it?s important to realize that markets across the globe fell together and they have already started rising together.

 This is not the first time that emerging markets have tottered during the current boom. They crashed in May 2004, shook again in January last year, and dived last April and October. Corrections are, of course, a feature of any bull run and are widely seen to be healthy. The problem is that this worldwide boom has rather shaky foundations. The bears believe that it is the result of a huge ramping up of liquidity by central banks around the world, the creation of a mountain of debt in the US and an unsustainable investment bubble in China. Trouble is, so far, the markets have pooh-poohed these fears, and ingenious theories have been put forward to explain why record asset prices are justified by the ?fundamentals?. The worry this time is that global liquidity may finally be tightening. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note touched its highest level since June 2004 last week. There are initial signs of weakness in the US housing market. The European central bank has raised interest rates and Japan seems to be all set to give up its zero interest rate policy. In short, the concerns remain and the markets will, every now and then, reflect that sense of disquiet.

 IN THE FORCE

 There is no inquiry that can do complete justice to the dead. The ?reasons? why Susmita Chakraborthy allegedly chose to end her own life will never be known. But her death opens up issues ? within the defence establishment and, more generally, in society ? that point to fundamental problems of perception, administration, discipline and hence, ultimately, of social justice. Some of these issues are structural and procedural, pertaining to the defence services as a more or less closed system, yet existing as part of a changing society. And some of the issues are crucially gendered: the impact of the entry of women on the armed forces, and perhaps more importantly, the impact of the armed forces on the lives of the women who are part of them.

 First, the question of stress and psychiatric counselling within the forces. The rate of attempted and successful suicides in the armed forces has been significant since 2002, and the medical and counselling infrastructure is obviously not proving to be adequate. However, psychiatric practice and diagnoses within the defence establishment (and anywhere else, for that matter) cannot be entirely free of social and cultural assumptions, or of the entrenched values of the institution that they attempt to serve. Notions of ?fitness? ? physical, mental and hence, professional ? are formed, put in action and enforced according to existing assumptions and systems of power that are specific to institutions and to the larger social structures in which these institutions exist. How a traditionally, and still predominantly, male institution like the army or the air force perceives the role of women within it is, therefore, one of the fundamental issues here. How do these perceptions inform the ethos of such institutions, down to the nitty-gritty of internal administration, discipline and behaviour? And how does this ethos constitute the lives ? professional as well as personal ? of the few women who are taken in as a still largely marginal part of these institutions? To what extent are objective measurements of women?s physical abilities (whether, say, they are capable of combat or flying fighter planes) confused with cultural stereotypes of what women ought to or can do and what they should be like? To what extent are women allowed to be professional beings, with capacities and potentials irrespective of sex, before being lumped together as a gendered species?

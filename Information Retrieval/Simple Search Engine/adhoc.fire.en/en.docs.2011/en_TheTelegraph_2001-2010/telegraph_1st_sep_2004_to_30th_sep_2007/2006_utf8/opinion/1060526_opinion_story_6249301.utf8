 Shooting from the mouth

 Sir ? By banning the actor, Feroz Khan, from entering the country, president Musharraf has proved that Pakistan is still a regimented society, unaccustomed to criticism and intolerant of individual freedom of speech (?Pervez bans Feroz?, May 19). The comments by Feroz Khan had nothing to do with ?a few glasses too many?. On the contrary, his remarks were in response to the ill-treatment of an Indian actress at the hands of the compere, Fakhr-e-Alam. This kind of behaviour meted out to a guest on the part of the host country is really surprising. What was even more surprising was the behaviour of Feroz?s brother, Akbar Khan, and Mahesh Bhatt, who were present on the occasion. 

 Normally, when Indians are invited to attend programmes in other countries, they swallow all the pejorative remarks about their own country to ensure that they get their next invitation. Very few have had the courage to speak up against their hosts, something which Khan did on this occasion. Musharraf?s ban on Khan only reveals an aspect of Pakistani society which should be condemned and not praised.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Feroz Khan is persona non grata in Pakistan because of his comments on the ongoing ethnic strife there. The reactions within the Pakistani establishment and the intelligentsia reflect their ostrich-like approach towards religious and social discrimination prevalent in the country. It is a matter of great pride for all Indians that Feroz Khan waxed eloquent about the secular fabric of India in a country that was created on the basis of the contention that Muslims would be unsafe in a Hindu-dominated, independent India. India has come a long way since the Partition. It has made tremendous progress in almost all walks of life. The world looks at India with respect as the country has ensured the representation of all religious denominations on the land. Pakistan, in comparison, has not been able to achieve this unique feat. It is a country which is still characterized by political instability, dictatorship and incessant attempts at talibanization. Most sensible and informed people consider Pakistan a cradle of terrorism where, among others, Muslims are not safe either. 

 However, what the ordinary Pakistani cannot accept is anyone pointing out that the Partition has resulted in a resounding failure of Pakistan as a nation. In Feroz Khan?s case, the criticism came from an Indian Muslim and must have angered the hosts no end. It must have taken some courage to say the things that Feroz Khan did. And he did not bother to camouflage his true emotions by sugarcoating his words. As a true Indian, Khan deserves kudos for his clarity of thought and commitment to truth. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The outburst of Feroz Khan on foreign soil was ridiculous. In the first place, the actor should have known that he was representing India as an individual citizen and not as a delegate sent by Indian Muslims to represent their community. Furthermore, he should have done his homework on the different categories of Muslims in India. There are some who are nominal Muslims, then there are the practising Muslims and finally, the subaltern Muslims. Nominal Muslims swear by Islam as and when they find it beneficial. But they spend most of their time drinking and gambling. This is also the section that readily condones inter-faith marriages and considers itself a model of civilization and cultural elitism. 

 To the second category belong the likes of the Shahi Imam and other religious leaders. They are devout Muslims who pray five times a day, wear their religious identity on their sleeve and conveniently forget the adverse attention that they themselves receive on account of their conservatism and parochial views. The final group comprises poor Muslims whose voices are seldom heard. Their representation in the public and private sector is negligible. They have lost whatever land they owned to urbanization and development. Nor do they have anyone to speak up for them. These Muslims need to be given a fair treatment and a legitimate share of national resources. It is irrelevant whether Feroz Khan spoke in favour of Indian Muslims in Pakistan. What is certain is that the actor certainly did not have the interests of his poor brethren in mind. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? There is a new menace on public transport nowadays. Even the state buses are not free from it. I am referring to the FM radios that are played at a high decibel on buses, taxis and autorickshaws, without seeking the permission of the passengers. 

 While private buses comply on some occasions, CSTC buses simply refuse to do anything about the noise. This is because they have no fear of loss of revenue even if irate passengers decide to step down from the bus. The least that a passenger expects is a safe and peaceful journey. What is dished out instead is loud trashy music. Hopefully, the authorities will look into the matter and put an end to the menace. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashim Banik,Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LIVING WITH GRIME ON THE FACE 

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 How far are we prepared to meet the environmental hazards that threaten Calcutta?

 What would it be like if Calcutta became the epicentre of a potential earthquake? Sceptics probably think this is impossible. After all, like Indonesia, we are not sitting atop the Pacific Ring of Fire and hence are safe from the effects of sudden tectonic activities. Even our grandfathers do not remember any major earthquakes that took place in the Calcutta in the last hundred years. 

 But what if over-exploitation of land, water bodies and groundwater level in and around Calcutta lead to a major man-made disaster? Such a possibility is perhaps not improbable. And, more worryingly, neither the government nor the people are bothered about the factors threatening Calcutta on World Environment Day.

 Climatic changes, rising temperatures and sea levels across the world are problems that have bothered scientists and the media alike. But how far are we prepared to meet the environmental hazards that threaten Calcutta?

 Barring a few NGOs that have raised voices against the real estate boom, the state government and the residents seem to be hell-bent on turning Calcutta into another Shanghai. Money is flowing in to fund flyovers, skyscrapers and shopping malls but at what cost? 

 Geologists say that Calcutta is sitting on soft alluvial soil, which is unsuitable for constructions that need deep boring. Rampant exploitation of underground water by boring deep tubewells have caused the soil layer under the surface to sink in the newly developed areas along the city?s fringes. 

 Soil layer sinking could weaken the foundation of buildings leading to their collapse. Moreover, as the water level recedes further, the space in between becomes hollow leading to landslides and increasing the chances of an earthquake. But can one really blame the residents? With no regular drinking water supply, they have no other option but to depend on tubewells. 

 Moreover, to encourage realtors, a notification has been recently amended to ensure that the Calcutta municipal corporation cannot raise its voice against the filling up of waterbodies. This, along with weak monsoons over the last couple of years, has resulted in falling underground water levels. 

 Felling of trees have stripped many parts of Calcutta of their dense foliage. And with mayors like Subrata Mukherjee turning a deaf ear to the protests of environmentalists trying to save precious trees from being felled, the situation has become worse. Calcutta would soon die, if steps are not taken to change short-sighted policies that aim at scoring quick gains. What we need is diversification of infrastructure and implementation of laws with an iron hand.

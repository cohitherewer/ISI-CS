 Test case

 Sir ? India?s 1-0 victory over the West Indies in the recently-concluded test series is reassuring (?Kings at Kingston?, July 4). India was certainly the superior side throughout the test series, and had it not been for the weather playing spoilsport in the second test in St Kitt?s, India might have won 2-0. However, one must not forget the 1-4 drubbing India received in the one-day series just before the tests. 

 India needs to take a lesson from the way the Sri Lankans have ?whitewashed? England in the one-day series in England. This proves that the Lankans are currently a better-organized one-day side than India, thanks to their blend of maturity and youth. Veterans like Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly could provide the same balance to the Indian team, and ensure success in the 2007 World Cup. However, apart from the captain, Rahul Dravid, no other Indian player was consistent either in the one-days or the tests. After a lot of hype in the media before the start of the series, a drubbing in the one-dayers was least expected. In fact, most had believed India would clinch the one-day series, and have it tough in the tests, given the 35-year jinx. But then, India is an unpredictable team if ever there was one. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? Team India must be congratulated for their historic win against the West Indies in the Caribbeans after a gap of more than three decades. Credit for the feat should go to all the players and to all aspects of play ? batting, bowling and fielding. India won the series 1-0, but it could have been 3-0, as the Windies had a close shave in two other matches. Besides, one should not forget the coach, Greg Chappell, whose presence has made the difference. On the whole, the triumph over West Indies will have a positive impact on the build-up to the World Cup in 2007. If India keeps this momentum, it will see more success in the future.

 Yours faithfully, 

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir ? Everybody will claim India?s test victory in the West Indies as historic, but few will remember that India had lost the one-day series 1-4. Besides, it could have easily won the first two test matches as well, had there been proper team selection. We should not go over the top congratulating the team for defeating a West Indies team which is ranked by the International Cricket Council only above Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. There should be no hero-worship of players for taking on such minnows.

 Yours faithfully,

Gagan Chawla, Calcutta

 Sir ? India?s victory in Jamaica is praiseworthy. One can see the media already speculating over Dravid being ?the finest batsman that India has ever produced?, or whether this is the best team that India has ever had. A few weeks ago, when the Indian team had just lost the ODI series, the same television channels had gone to the extent of questioning the integrity of Dravid and Chappell in matters of team selection. 

 When are we going to realize that winning and losing are a part of the game? There can be no doubt about the fact that Chappell and Dravid have done a great job in knitting together a team that wants to win and for giving many youngsters the opportunity to prove themselves. Chappell has not only brought his experience and expertise to the job, but has also not hesitated in bringing in necessary technology and experts. However, one Jamaican victory does not mean that Team India is without problems. As the last test showed, there is no batsman in the team, except Dravid, who has the skill, patience and temperament to battle it out on a difficult pitch. Both Chappell and Dravid should mull over the matter. They have to find ways to hone the necessary skills. Among the bowlers, S. Sreesanth is a great find and deserves praise for his consistent and aggressive bowling. This victory should be looked upon as a stepping-stone to greater success. The team could have Australia as its benchmark, even though it is lightyears behind in performance and consistency.

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 On the border

 Sir ? The enthusiasm about Nathu-la promoting India?s trade ties with China is premature. For one, China is certainly not the friendliest of neighbours. (?Nathu-la decks for highest traffic jam?, July 5). Besides, the volume of trade through this pass is not expected to be significant since the infrastructure necessary for it is absent. Meanwhile, there are already fears of an increase in espionage activities in India, especially in north Bengal and the North-east. India will also have to deploy a greater number of armed forces to keep constant vigil there. Indeed, the Nathu-la trade route might turn out to be more of a curse than a blessing for India.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If traffic is the main problem, one wonders why the administration hadn?t thought of it before throwing open the Nathu-la. Does India think trade would happen on mule-back?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sen Sharma, Calcutta

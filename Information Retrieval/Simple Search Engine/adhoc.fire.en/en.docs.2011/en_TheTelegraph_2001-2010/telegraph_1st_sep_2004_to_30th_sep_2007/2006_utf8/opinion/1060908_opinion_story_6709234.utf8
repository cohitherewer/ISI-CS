 LISTEN TO THE VOICE WITHIN 

 Bookwise

 Tricks of the trade 

 Developments in print and communications 

 technology have led to a vast expansion and diversification 

 of media outlets newspapers, magazines, television channels, 

 radio stations and so on. These changes have also touched 

 the world of books. They all have an inexhaustible appetite 

 for raw material; that is, for writers who can turn out 

 articles and books on subjects of contemporary interest. 

 Hence the rise of writing schools and creative writing courses 

 in universities as a regular subject at the postgraduate 

 level.

 But the question is: can writing, 

 creative or otherwise, be taught after school? The answer 

 is both yes and no, depending on what kind of writing you 

 set out to teach. This is because all publishing boils down 

 to a few simple queries who are you writing for? What 

 is the readership profile, that is, the linguistic standards 

 (for the Indian market knowledge of language skills is very 

 important) and the current interests of the potential reader? 

 These are not easy questions to answer but they lie at the 

 root of all successful writing.

 Simple communication skills can 

 be taught. Although these skills ought to have been taught 

 in school, the emphasis on grammar, sentence structures, 

 correct usage of dictionaries and close reading of texts 

 is not given importance because of the pressures of syllabus. 

 The job is left for the universities or the fine-tuning 

 is done at the post school stage. There are a number of 

 excellent texts on language and style that a student can 

 pick up without relying on a teacher. This is to say that 

 the urge to improve must come from within.

 Can creative writing be taught? 

 The answer is no to a large extent. Of course some creative 

 writers have come out of such workshops but what these courses 

 did was bring out their latent talent that was waiting to 

 emerge. Some excellent books must have helped too: John 

 Gardners Art of Fiction, Strunk and Whites Elements 

 of Style, William Zinssers On Writing Well, 

 Eudora Weltys One Writers Beginnings, Norman Mailers 

 The Spooky Art: Thoughts on Writing, Margaret Atwoods 

 Curious Pursuits: Occasional Writing, and several 

 others. Having said this, there are some problems why creative 

 writing cant be taught.

 First is the lack of interest 

 many students show in reading. And those who read often 

 lack the training to observe subtle clues or the close reading 

 that is required. Potential writers have to savour books 

 rather than racing through them, a strategy that may require 

 some rewiring, unhooking the connection that makes you 

 think that you have to have an opinion about the book and 

 reconnecting that wire to whatever terminal lets you see 

 reading as something that might move or delight you. 

 Second, writing requires some 

 living with and living by. In other words, as Evelyn Waugh 

 said, it is experience totally transformed. Every writer, 

 Hemingway famously said, must have a built-in, shock-proof 

 shit detector. This is the voice of the story or its feeling 

 that cant be taught. It must come from within.

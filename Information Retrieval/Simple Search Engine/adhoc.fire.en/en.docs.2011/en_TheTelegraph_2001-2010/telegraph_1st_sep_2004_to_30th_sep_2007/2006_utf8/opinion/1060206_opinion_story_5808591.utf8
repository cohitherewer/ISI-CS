 LOSING PERIPHERAL VISION

 Twenty-Twenty 

/ Bharat Bhushan

 Read between the lines

 The current dispensation in New Delhi does not seem serious about settling the periphery of India ? whether it be Kashmir or Nagaland. As long as Metropolitan India is safe, it feels secure. The bushfires in the periphery can continue for all it cares.

 When it is the question of allowing foreign direct investment in retail trade or airport privatization, the government acts firmly and with determination. But when it comes to dealing with India?s periphery, it feigns weakness. Therefore, it is not surprising that since Manmohan Singh assumed power, not a single political initiative has been taken to address the festering Naga problem ? except, of course, the appointment of a group of ministers to talk to the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isac-Muivah). However, the ministers have nothing to show for themselves.

 Eight-and-a-half years of ceasefire has made New Delhi forget the advantages of solving the Naga problem. Its entire focus is to somehow keep extending the ceasefire, forgetting the primary purpose of the cessation of hostilities. This is what was witnessed in Bangkok at the end of January. A prolonged ceasefire has meant that the government does not even remember the seriousness of the Naga problem. How can it then even begin to see the benefits of solving it?

 Nearly 25,000 lives have been lost due to the Naga insurgency. The Naga rebellion has also been the source of all insurgencies in India?s North-east ? they have trained most of the militant groups in that region. If the Naga issue is settled, the entire North-east can hope for peace. If the North-east is peaceful, then it is less likely to be a fertile ground for anti-India operations by either Pakistan?s Inter-Services Intelligence, Islamic fundamentalists and other countries aiming to bog down India in its internal security problems. New Delhi then has more time to address other issues such as Kashmir or the growing Naxalite problem. Since the Naga issue is next only to Kashmir in terms of the international attention it draws, there are other benefits to be had by solving it.

 The prime minister does not tire of repeating the mantra that the Naga movement is ?the mother of all insurgencies? in the North-east. But the fact remains that since the Mizoram Accord of 1986, not a single insurgency has been solved.

 New Delhi?s lack of political will has been compounded by a misreading of the NSCN (I-M). It believes that eight-and-a-half-years of ceasefire have put its ageing leadership at a disadvantage. Its chairman, Isak Chishi Swu, and its general secretary, Thuingaleng Muivah, are no spring chickens and its cadre have got used to an easy semi-urban life compared to the hardships of the jungle. Wear them out some more and they will settle on terms acceptable to New Delhi.

 If they continue to be intransigent, then a militarily weakened NSCN (I-M) can be marginalized and other groups ? NSCN (Khaplang), the Naga National Council or S.C. Jamir, the Congress party?s ?Gandhi of the North-east?, can be used as negotiating partners instead. The rest of India will think that Naga peace talks are continuing.This assessment is flawed. Muivah can still paralyze two states fully and two partially in the North-east. If negotiating with the NNC or the NSCN (K) could solve the Naga issue, then that is what the government ought to have done. Why bother with ?unreasonable? elements in the NSCN (I-M)?

 Those who signed the Shillong Accord also thought that the Naga issue had been settled with reasonable people. It resulted in a generation walking off to the jungle in protest and taking up arms. Through its unthinking acts, New Delhi can send one more generation of Nagas underground. There is no guarantee that this time the war will be fought in the jungle. Terrorism today is effective not in deserts, mountains and jungles but in the metropolises ? in New York, London and New Delhi.

 The government does not appreciate that the Nagas are talking about issues internal to India. All indications are that they want to be a part of India. They only want their relationship to be based on the terms of the peace agreement signed with them. So why insult the Nagas by constantly raising the red herring of ?sovereignty?? It is reasonable, however, for New Delhi to expect that any solution to the Naga issue ultimately should be within the Constitution of India and that it must preserve the integrity of the Union. But the Constitution can either be a point of departure to resolve the conflict or it can be a point of arrival ? the solution can be accommodated within the Constitution after due amendments.

 Those in the government who want everything to be discussed ?within the four-corners of the Constitution? do not recognize that it is the people who require a Constitution, not the government. Governments can also run on martial law, on monarchical tradition and even on a criminal or penal code ). A Constitution, therefore, is a document of the people. The people have to have the ownership of the Constitution and hence, it needed a constituent assembly, and today a two-thirds majority of parliament, for amending it. However, we should recognize that the Nagas were not represented in the Constituent Assembly. This can be changed so that they too, like the rest of India, can own it. They will have that ownership when they feel that their rights are recognized in the Constitution.

 The Constitution does not recognize the unity and unique ethnic identity of the Nagas. If the Constitution unites the Nagas, they will welcome it. This will be a solution both within the Constitution of India as well as the Union of India.Why raise the issue of ?sovereignty? when the Nagas themselves say that the notion of sovereignty has changed the world over. They still talk of sovereignty ambiguously but this should not be taken seriously. Farooq Abdullah and Parkash Singh Badal also talked ambiguously about the Constitution. Badal, in fact, burnt a copy of it in New Delhi but later went on to become the chief minister of Punjab.

 The Naga underground will eventually go the way the Naga people want it to go ? this connection with civil society is the singular achievement of the eight years of the cease-fire. The Nagas today see their future with India. They need to be hand-held in this process, with the government showing sensitivity to their aspirations and agreeing to devolution of powers. This cannot be done by sweet-talking them into extending the ceasefire indefinitely. New Delhi needs to come up with viable proposals. The patience of the Nagas is wearing thin. If the process breaks down, Manmohan Singh and his government will have to take the blame squarely.

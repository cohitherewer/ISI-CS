 Shame game

 Sir I have not been shocked by Gnter Grasss expos of his being a former member of the Waffen-SS (Grass peels away veil from shameful Nazi past, Aug 13). The Nazi influence was so overwhelming in the Thirties and Forties Germany that most young Germans were likely to be conscripted either by force or through misguided inspiration. We should not commit the fallacy of re-reading Grasss anti-Fascist novel, The Tin Drum, in the light of this information. Every man must bear his own cross and it is redeeming enough for the Nobel laureate litterateur to have confessed about his Nazi associations in his autobiography, Peeling the Onion. I would continue reading Grass, now with more critical attention and affection.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Pinaki Roy,

 Sir Gnter Grass has revealed his sordid past. Although there may be some misgivings about the timing of the revelation, the Nobel Prize winner deserves praise for his confession. Instead of keeping quiet or letting his past be revealed by future researchers, he has told the truth himself, although a bit late in the day. However, it would have been fitting for a man of integrity like Grass if he were to stall the sale of his current novel temporarily. During this time, he could undertake a world tour to have a heart-to-heart talk with his readers, and tell them about the unbearable pangs of guilt he suffered for so many years. He could tell them what compelled him to open up the can of worms. Probably, that would convince readers that he had no special commercial interest in disclosing his past. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Nobel laureate was conscripted into the Waffen-SS. He did not choose to join it (After such knowledge, Aug 19). Also, any historian of World War II will confirm that the SS had nothing to do with the Allegmeine SS which staffed the concentration camps. The division that Grass joined was a combat division. 

 It is normal for Grass to have kept his past a secret, given the colossal hypocrisy regarding war crimes that overlooks the Allies own crimes while putting the blame entirely on Germany. The overreaction to the authors confession should be compared to the quiet acceptance of the fact that the current pope, Benedict XVI, was a Hitler Youth as a boy. Grass has had the courage to admit to his past. One wishes his critics had accepted the fact with a little more grace.

 Yours faithfully,

 Play by the rule

 Sir The report, Security threat in a golf ball (Aug 5) made interesting reading. The disturbance caused by ricocheting golf balls to the policemen guarding the Karnataka chief minister, H.D. Kumaraswamy, and his driver has been reason enough for the authorities demand for a closure of the Bangalore Golf Club. There is no doubt that the security of the chief minister is a serious matter and that golfers need to be more careful about where they send their balls, but does any of this warrant the shutting down of a century-old club? More important, given the clubs list of members, can Kumaraswamy do it without hurting the sentiments of the high and mighty?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The district administration of Karnataka is to shut down the Bangalore Golf Club for security reasons, that is the menace of stray golf balls. But this could be easily prevented by raising the boundary net of the golf course. And if push comes to shove, instead of closing down the club, would it not be advisable to shift the residence of the chief minister to the outskirts of the city, where his security cover would remain intact? The golf club should be allowed to survive because it also acts as the lungs of the city, once known for its well-manicured gardens and parks. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Dressing down

 Sir It is a disgrace that even after 59 years of independence, Indian women need to be shackled with sartorial regulations (Dress properly, home ministry tells women, Aug 12). If a proper dress was what prevented sexual atrocities, then there would be no crimes against women in Islamic countries. The government cannot abdicate its responsibility of ensuring the security of women by simply asking them to dress properly. There must be stringent laws to deal with those who commit crimes against women. As said by Renuka Chowdhury, who is in charge of the ministry for women and child welfare, womens mobility and independence should not be curbed in order to keep sexual violence at bay. If necessary, the state should provide additional security to women so that they can move freely. Setting a dress code for women amounts to gender discrimination. NGOs and womens groups should come forward to create greater awareness and change the mindset of the patriarchal society. 

Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee,

Sir One agrees that women are 

 not subjects of sexual violence only because of their dress, 

 but there is no denying that the modern dress code gets 

 them undue attention. A burglar has no right to rob a house 

 simply because the door is open, but the fact is that he 

 will surely utilize the opportunity. If a modest attire 

 saves a woman from being sexually harassed, then it is a 

 good idea to wear such clothes. After all, safety is much 

 more important than fashion. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 S. Mukherjee, 

 Calcutta

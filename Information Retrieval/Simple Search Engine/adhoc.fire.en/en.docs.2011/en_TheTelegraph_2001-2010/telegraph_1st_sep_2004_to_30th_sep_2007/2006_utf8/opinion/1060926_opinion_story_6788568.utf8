 One more time

 Sir Is anyone surprised at the way India crashed out of the DLF Cup in Kuala Lumpur? I am not. Do we have a single player who is consistent and can be relied upon? Even Sachin Tendulkar has failed to perform in critical situations. In the match against Australia which India should have won but lost by 18 runs, Tendulkar was called back to the crease by the umpire who mistakenly declared him out. But the star batsman came back and threw his wicket away a few balls later, proving that the umpires mistakes do not cost India matches. India loses because of a lack of dedication and hunger for victory. Why should non-performing batsmen like Virender Sehwag (even Sachin Tendulkar since he hardly ever comes good in crisis situations) be carried on with? Why shouldnt players like M.S. Dhoni and Suresh Raina be dropped for letting success go to their heads? Both Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell have proved incapable of giving Team India a new direction. The board should think about replacing them soon.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir It appears that the prolonged training that Indian cricketers took under foreign experts and coach prior to the DLF Cup had no impact either on the team or on individual players. Indians continue to remain sloppy in fielding. A casual approach is particularly evident in the batsmens selection of shots. Frequent changes in the composition of the team and too many experiments with the batting order and bowling combination must have affected the confidence of the players. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.C. Chakrabarti, Calcutta

 Sir The early exit of India from the DLF cup once again exposes the chinks in Greg Chappells armour. He will go on experimenting with the batting line-up, and the composition of the team, but to what effect? He has very little to show after West Indies and Kuala Lumpur. For team spirit to develop, players need to feel secure in the team something that looks impossible with Greg Experiment Chappell around. Irfan Pathan is an example at hand. Pathans bowling is suffering because he is forced to give too much attention to his batting. When senior batsmen like Sehwag, Kaif and Yuvraj Singh do not perform regularly, they should be left out to set an example before the juniors, if for nothing else. Why are the selectors using double standards when they are dealing with the likes of Sehwag, Kaif, Raina on the one hand and Kumble, Laxman and Sourav Ganguly on the other? 

 If Dravid doesnt perform as a captain, the selectors should remember that we still have a captain sitting on the bench the most successful Indian captain so far. He could always be called forth to lead the team on the field.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumya Mukherjee, Naihati

 Sir Indias dismal performance against Australia last Friday is ample testimony to the fact that the entire team is liable to buckle under pressure when faced with a quality opposition.To make matters worse, the batting which is often considered to be our greatest strength has proved to be our greatest bane in crunch games. Besides being regularly beaten by Australia over the last five years, the last time India won a tri-nation tournament was way back in 2002. It is quite baffling that despite having Greg Chappell as coach for over a year now, the Indian team has not yet been able to overcome the jinx of losing in crunch matches. So where is the so-called killer instinct which is supposed to be injected into the team by the world-famous coach? 

 It is time for the entire Indian team to go through a series of psychological and psychometric tests which will ascertain their mental toughness in various situations. Those who cannot make the grade should be left out of the team when it is time for the next round of selections. Looking at the performance of Team India in the DLF Cup, one cannot but wonder whether the Indian team even deserves to play in the Champions Trophy, considering it is more or less a knock-out tournament. In other words, handling pressure is once again going to be the key factor.

 Yours faithfully,

 Festival under water

 Sir Durga Puja is only a few days away. But the festive spirit seems to have been washed out by the rains, as the city witnesses waterlogged streets and traffic jams. The paint on the Durga idols is yet to dry. Last minute shopping too has had to be put on hold, and this means huge losses for the traders who wait for this time of the year to bring home some profit. One can only hope that such calamitous weather does not ruin the three festive days. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanta Das, Calcutta

 Sir The Mumbai floods of 2005 should have been a warning to all municipal corporations to repair the citys drainage system. Calcuttas clearly has not heeded the warning. New schemes will soon be undertaken with a lot of fanfare and foreign funding agencies or the Centre will be approached for money. In spite of unsatisfactory work in the past, funds will be sanctioned too. But then, completion will take its own sweet time, and dont be surprised if some of the funds mysteriously disappear. One cannot expect much more from a government devoid of commitment or dedication.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

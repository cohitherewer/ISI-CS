 CHINK IN THE ARMOUR

 P. K. Vasudeva

 Recently, the United Progressive Alliance government constituted a committee headed by Justice Rajinder Sachar to collect data on the number of Muslims serving in the armed forces, the positions they hold, and their role in the key positions. The armed forces had taken exception to this and argued that the Indian army is an apolitical institution and such a move would disturb the religious harmony within the force.

 The survey has kicked up a storm among serving as well as ex-servicemen. Many of them are of the opinion that the survey is a retrograde step and could entangle the army in a needless controversy. Most of them feel that the collection of data of a communal nature will only add fuel to fire.

 Reacting to the government order, the Bharatiya Janata Party president, Rajnath Singh, and former defence minister, George Fernandes, have said that the exercise is a ?seditious act? and amounted to ?communalizing? the force. They have also demanded that the exercise be stopped and termed it as ?anti-national?. 

 War of words

 According to Singh, the army is a professional and secular outfit and there can be no ?minority? and ?majority? in the country?s defence forces. ?Whoever is floating these ideas is working to weaken the forces and break their morale?, he said. Former minister of commerce, law and justice, Arun Jaitley, also pointed out that the survey was in progress despite the army?s objections. Examining the hierarchy of the defence forces on the basis of religious representation throws up a ?disturbing trend?. Jaitley wants the government to step in to prevent the Sachar committee from proceeding further.

 However, the Congress-led government has defended its decision to conduct the survey. Congress spokesperson, Abhishek Singhvi, has said that the allegations levelled by the opposition were baseless and sought to sensationalize the issue. The survey, Singhvi adds, is purely a data-gathering and fact-finding exercise. Any department or public entity is entitled to collect data and it was irresponsible to attribute motives to it, he added.

 As a matter of fact, the Indian army is the best example of national integration in the country. It is indeed a delight to see troops belonging to different religions and communities living in harmony and brotherhood. Whenever there is a religious function, for instance the Guru Purav, armymen belonging to other religions join the Sikh troops in praying at the gurdwara. 

 United we fight

 Similarly, Muslims, Hindus and Christian jawans in the army celebrate religious festivals like Id, Ram Navami, Janmashtami and Christmas in mosques,temples and churches in unison. This census will definitely disturb the bond that exists between the soldiers of different religious communities who are the backbone of the forces. It is also likely to impair the feeling of camaraderie that is in place in the army?s rank and file. The data may politicize the armed forces and disturb the unity that binds the force together.

 If one were to go through the history of our armed forces, one would find that it is replete with tales of bravery of Muslim soldiers who had been conferred bravery awards for fighting shoulder to shoulder with Hindus, Sikhs and Christians against terrorists and soldiers from across the border.

 The present government shall be playing into the hands of adversaries who are bent on dividing the armed forces on communal grounds. Therefore, a status report on the Muslim soldiers in the armed forces need to be stopped from being carried out. Otherwise, it would undoubtedly undermine the solidarity of soldiers and impair a secular institution known for its exemplary tradition of integration.

 IT?S NOT ABOUT NUMBERS

 GWYNNE DYER

 April 26 is the 20th anniversary of the explosion and fire in the Chernobyl-4 nuclear reactor, so the long-running dispute over how many people actually died as a result of the accident is back. And now the growing public argument in the West about ending the de facto ban on new nuclear power stations has lent wings to the debate.

 Last Tuesday, the WHO published a report estimating that 405 people died in the first decade after the accident, almost all of them former plant workers, firefighters and soldiers ? exposed to massive radiation doses in the initial explosion or during the nine-day struggle to put out the fire in the reactor core. But over 200,000 people were involved in some aspect of the clean-up operation, and some of them as well as some people living near the site will also develop cancers from their lesser exposure sooner or later.

 The WHO?s best estimate is that about 9,300 people will eventually die from Chernobyl-related cancers. Greenpeace International, on the other hand, has just issued a report predicting that the number of cancer deaths directly attributable to Chernobyl will ultimately reach 93,000.

 This is as much an argument about the future as the past, since the outcome of the revived debate in the West about the desirability of nuclear power depends heavily on the public?s perception of the risks involved. It?s not how the debate should be settled, but both sides know that?s how it will be.

 The real arguments for and against nuclear power are about complicated technical and financial issues. Would the same amount of investment in ?renewables? like wind power produce as much electricity, and how do you allow for the fact that the wind does not always blow? Would investing in techniques like ?sequestering? the carbon-dioxide output from conventional coal, oil- and gas-fired plants be a better way to spend the money ? and how soon could such technologies be available on a large scale?

 Real question

 Those are the real issues, but everybody knows that ?safety? will be what decides the outcome in the public debate. Since Chernobyl is the only accident involving a nuclear power plant in the past 50 years that has killed any members of the public, just how many died has become a bitterly contested question. Unfortunately, it is also a hugely misleading one.

 There is no doubt that 30 people died in the immediate struggle to contain the accident. But after that, all the other deaths attributed to Chernobyl are statistical inferences. That doesn?t mean they did not occur, but it does mean that the range of plausible conclusions, given the state of the medical and demographic data in the affected area (Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia), is very wide indeed.

 Moreover, predictions about the ?final death toll? are meaningless, because everybody dies eventually, and about 30 per cent of people in developed societies die of cancer. Whether it?s 9,300 or 93,000 people who die as a delayed effect of Chernobyl, mostly from cancers developing late in their lives, they will be dying just a few months earlier than they were statistically likely to anyway.

 The massive hydrogen-bomb tests in 1962, which released about a hundred times as much radiation as Chernobyl, had a similar effect. Worldwide, the average radiation dose from those tests was ten milliSieverts. Ten milliSieverts of radiation is calculated to shorten a person?s lifespan, on average, by four days. What those tests really meant was an early death for an unlucky few, and nothing for everybody else.

 In the case of nuclear power, the number of lives that might be at risk from accidents is only a tiny fraction of those at risk from global warming, but the debate will be mostly about the alleged dangers of nuclear power, not about whether it is the best way to produce huge amounts of power without also producing a great deal of carbon dioxide.

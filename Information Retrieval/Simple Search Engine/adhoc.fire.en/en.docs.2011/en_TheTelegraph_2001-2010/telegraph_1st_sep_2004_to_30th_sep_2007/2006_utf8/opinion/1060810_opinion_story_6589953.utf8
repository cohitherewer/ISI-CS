 INQUIRY REPORT

 It was Aristotles dictum that all interpretation or criticism must begin with the text itself. Thus it would be appropriate to begin with the text of the report submitted by Mr R.S. Pathak on the United Nations oil-for-food programme. Since Mr Singh made himself a cause clbre after his involvement in this programme became public, the text of Mr Pathaks report has not come in for the discussion it deserves. There can be no doubt from the report that Mr Natwar Singh, whatever be his protestations to the contrary, was implicated in the process through which certain Indians made monetary gains under the UN oil-for-food programme. From the evidence presented before Mr Pathak, it was clear to him that there was a ready and constant willingness in Shri Natwar Singh to provide such support as he could to the efforts of Shri Jagat Singh and Shri Andaleeb Sehgal to obtain allocations of oil from the Iraqi Oil Minister. These allocations were political allocations made at the behest of Mr Singh who wrote letters and proclaimed himself friendly to the people of Iraq and their cause. Since Mr Pathak has found no money trail to link Mr Singh and his son to the transactions, Mr Singhs motives remain a mystery even as his complicity is clear as daylight. It is also obvious that Mr Singh was somewhat economical with the truth in his deposition before Mr Pathak.

 Mr Pathaks report, despite its limpid narrative, conveys a sense of incompleteness. Mr Pathak makes clear in his initial statement that he was conducting an inquiry and not a trial. Yet, as a former judge, he is actually trained to conduct a trial. Members of the judiciary are trained to sift and evaluate evidence and to interpret the law. Judges are not trained to make inquiries, to carry out investigations and to gather evidence. These tasks demand training and expertise which are not available to a judge. It is not unreasonable to speculate that if the inquiry had been entrusted to someone trained in the art of investigation and gathering evidence, much more would have been unearthed than Mr Pathak has brought to light. But he cannot be blamed for this. The problem is bigger, and is intrinsic to the procedure of appointing a present or a former member of the judiciary as the head of an inquiry commission. Apart from the problems already noted, judicial commissions make members of the judiciary an extension of the government.

 There are two aspects of the case which were beyond Mr Pathaks remit and have been lost in the general hullabaloo. All the transactions under scrutiny relate to 2001 when the National Democratic Alliance was in power. Was it aware of the transactions? It is difficult to believe that it was not informed that Mr Natwar Singh, a Congress leader, with his son and Mr Sehgal, had met the Iraqi oil minister. Similarly, how could the Congress have been oblivious of such goings-on? These questions need to be asked in a democracy.

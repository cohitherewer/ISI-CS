 The way out of the mess

 Sir ? Now that the prime minister has taken up the issue of reservations himself, he might consider a simple solution to the problem (?Quota on PM plate?, May 17). Instead of disturbing the admission structure of existing universities ?engineering, medical, management or otherwise ? the government can start building institutions dedicated solely to the scheduled castes and tribes and the other backward classes. Since all the seats in these institutions will be reserved for the minorities, they will no longer be able to complain of discrimination and the party in power will also be spared the worry of losing their precious votes. 

 Yours faithfully,

F. Saha, Calcutta

 Slow but steady

 Sir ? The sentencing of Bir Singh Mahata, the member of parliament from Forward Bloc, to ten years for a rape committed 24 years ago is a classic example of the limitations of the Indian judicial system (?MP jailed for rape?, May 13). It is quite incredible that the courts took well over two decades to decide on Mahata?s case. Unfortunately, this seems to be the normal pace of settling cases in Indian courts. The few cases that have seen a speedy disbursal of justice have been exceptions, rather than being the rule. Given this particular situation, the ordinary citizen?s disenchantment with the judiciary does not come as a surprise. In this particular case, the Purulia court imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 each on Mahata?s three accomplices. This is surely not enough, considering what the victim had to endure at their hands. This, along with the delayed judgment, would only add to the agony of Mahata?s victim who has waited for justice for over two decades.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 Sir ? At a time when money and muscle power call the shots, the Supreme Court?s decision to sentence the Congress transport minister in Maharashtra, Surupsinh Naik, and Ashok Khot, an IAS officer, to a month?s imprisonment for contempt of court, should act as a deterrent to those politicians who think that they are above the law of the land by virtue of their political power (?Out of the woods no more?, May 13). 

 This particular judgment should also inspire judges to do their duty in an impartial manner. If the dispensers of the law can stoop so low as to be controlled by the wishes of political leaders, then ordinary people will forever be deprived of free and fair trials. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa

 Sir ? The punishments meted out to Bir Singh Mahata and Surupsinh Naik will help the judiciary dispel the charges of being partial while dealing with politicians. What is even more remarkable is that in the Naik case, the apex court even dismissed a petition that sought a review of the court order. This ensured that the guilty would have to serve their terms in jail. Not just that, the court also observed that the judgment should serve as a warning to those who think that the law cannot touch them. These two judgments should go a long way in rekindling the faith of the common people in the judiciary. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhasish Mohanty, Puri

 Parting shot

 Sir ? It is sad that the actor, Feroz Khan, has been banned from entering Pakistan (?Pervez bans Feroz?, May 19). But can Khan really be faulted for saying that Indian Muslims are better off than their Pakistani counterparts? India is a liberal country which treats its citizens equally, irrespective of religion, caste, colour and so on. Isn?t this why India is regarded as one of the most successful democracies in the world? 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

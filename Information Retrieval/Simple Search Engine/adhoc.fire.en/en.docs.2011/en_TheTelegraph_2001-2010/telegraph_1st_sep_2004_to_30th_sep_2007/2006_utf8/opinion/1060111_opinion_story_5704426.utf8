 BACKWARD HO!

 The cabinet committee on economic 

 affairs took the decision to reduce the foodgrain limit 

 for below-poverty-line families and increase the price for 

 households above the poverty line. But Mr Sharad Pawar, 

 the Union minister for food and agriculture, announced yesterday 

 that the decision was being stayed. This is a weak-kneed 

 response to criticism voiced by the left and other allies 

 like the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. The original rationale 

 offered by the government was very simple ? now that poor 

 households will have an additional source of foodgrains 

 under the rural employment guarantee scheme, they can make 

 do with less under the public distribution system. According 

 to the mid-year review of the economy, foodgrain stocks 

 were marginally lower than the buffer stock norms, so reducing 

 the limit will actually help matters.

 Increasing issue prices, however, is not really the solution to the problem of burgeoning food subsidies. Most people seem to think that foodgrains subsidy is a consumer subsidy alone. That is far from being the case ? it is also an open-ended farm support programme, since the Food Corporation of India has to buy whatever foodgrains are offered to it and it also pays for the creation of the buffer stock of foodgrains. Even if issue prices are raised in tandem with the rise in the minimum support price paid to farmers, offtake will drop, stocks will rise and the subsidy will increase. The food subsidy scheme currently in operation therefore has conflicting objectives, that of ensuring a remunerative price to farmers on the one hand and of providing foodgrains to the poor at affordable prices on the other. Under the circumstances, what needs to be done, on the supply side, is to take away the open-ended character of the scheme. The quantity procured should be limited to the amount of offtake expected, and the price should be arrived at through some market mechanism such as competitive bidding. On the demand side, solutions such as food stamps have been advocated. Studies have shown that the cost of transferring a rupee to the poor through the PDS is Rs 6.68 and that administrative costs account for 85 per cent of the total expenditure. A report by the Centre for Civil Society suggested that only 25 per cent of the grain actually reaches the poor. And a study by the Planning Commission pointed out that leakages from the targeted PDS or TDPS are higher than those under the PDS, which it was meant to replace. In short, the current system is extremely inefficient, and the recent cost-cutting measures by the FCI and the decision to increase issue prices address only the fringe of the problem. Populism is the biggest enemy of economic logic.

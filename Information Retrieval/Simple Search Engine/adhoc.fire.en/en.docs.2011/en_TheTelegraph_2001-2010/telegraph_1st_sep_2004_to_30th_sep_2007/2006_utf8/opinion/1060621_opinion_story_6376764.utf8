The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LIVING IN THE HEART OF DARKNESS

 India may have progressed materially but it has not been able to erase the culture of superstition that still prevails in parts of the country, writes Sumanta Sen

 Pearls of wisdom

 As the soccer World Cup got under way, the media was full of news of Togo, an African country which made its debut this year. It was natural that the media would be excited about Togo for this factor alone. But there was another reason for the hype. Readers and viewers were repeatedly told that this was a country which still believed in black magic, that there were exorcists who would perform sorcery to ensure success on the pitch. In short, Togo still represented the ?dark and mysterious? continent even as it geared up to participate in a modern tournament.

 Around the same time in Calcutta, someone stole a locket that belonged to the former Indian cricket captain, Sourav Ganguly. The locket was supposedly vested with mystical powers but this aspect of the incident hardly caused a flutter. Eyebrows were not raised as belief in the locket?s powers was a personal affair of Ganguly. This was similar to Sachin Tendulkar offering a puja to recover from his indifferent form. 

 The two incidents may have been personal affairs but one should remember that the two cricketers are role models and their activities, both on and off the field, are supposed to leave deep imprints on young minds. What would happen if these young Indians also start believing that there exists a greater power which can always see them through in their times of trouble? If a talisman is seen as anything more than a piece of metal, and that too by a huge number of people, then it is dangerous, both for the individual as well as for the nation. This is the 21st century, not the Middle Ages. Progress today also means progress of the mind. Globalization may be the key word today but when it comes to the mind, we seem to believe in only sharing the ideas of those whom circumstances have still kept backward.

 Neither Tendulkar nor Ganguly should be blamed for this though. It is not their fault that society has refused to move forward to shed its superstitions. Even in two enlightened states like West Bengal and Maharashtra, both of which enjoy a rich legacy of social reforms, faith in the supernatural persists. The reformers have remained largely confined to the pages of history books. Unfortunately, their words and actions have failed to enter popular consciousness.

 Tradition has remained as another obstacle in our society. Our forefathers believed in wearing amulets, in going to temples particularly at times of crisis, and so, it is often said that we must do the same. No questions must be asked. That would make a young man or woman, un-Indian. Just as the young footballer from Togo who is not encouraged to wonder why black magic can do what he himself or his coach is finding difficult to achieve. Our problem is that we can laugh at the man from Togo but when it comes to one of our own kind, we can only put on a sombre face and admire the youth?s religiosity.

 Religion and scriptures. Therein lies a problem. In the 19th century, those who defended the practice of sati and were opposed to widows remarrying also quoted scriptures. This was till Rammohun Roy and Vidyasagar quoted from the same books to prove that what was said by the defenders was all hogwash. Unfortunately the roots of social evil and superstition have gone down so deep that even those great reformers could not fully uproot these. In time they have also become almost a part of the Hindu pantheon, objects to be worshipped and not to be studied and understood.

 Bengali society is supposed to be liberal. Don?t we have our Rabindranath, our Nazrul, our leftists? Neither Rabindranath Tagore nor Kazi Nazrul Islam or others can come in our way when we decide to add one more ring to our already crowded fingers to ward off some evil spirit.

 We accept such behaviour and so there will be none to gently tap Sourav on the shoulder and tell him, ?My boy your footwork needs looking into and that is something you yourself will be able to do without any help from your charmed locket.? As for tradition, well, man had not visited the outer space when the beliefs of today were born.

 Such shoulder tapping of course can also be dangerous. Remember Satyajit Ray and Devi? When the film was released, there was a hue and cry that Ray had insulted Hindu religion and snide comments were made about his coming from a Brahmo background. Mercifully the Jan Sangh then was a small force. Had it been today, he would perhaps have not been able to even complete the film. In such an environment, people who know they are role models fail to understand the disastrous effects their own superstitions can have on the general public. It may just be a matter of time before we come to know that mothers are buying lockets by the fistful ? there is no dearth of money in the city ? and getting these blessed by sadhus of their choice for their children. These may be useful in examination halls also, as, after all, private tutors are only human.

 Some maybe tempted at this juncture to blame the sangh parivar for this state of affairs. Yet that would be a gross mistake. The parivar may indulge in obscurantism, and may want it to grow strong for its own political ends but its opponents have not been of much use either. In the early Eighties, I had asked Saroj Mukherjee, then state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), of what his party and the government were doing about the temples that were overtaking the payments. Mukherjee?s reply was that nothing could be done in a hurry, people would have to be educated. 

 In other words, nothing could be done as votes had to be kept in mind. Also while almost everybody is up in arms against the communalism of the Bharatiya Janata Party, nobody is looking inwards to question whether communalism is the only manifestation of obscurantism. Almost every other day, there are reports of witch doctors being active in the villages of Bengal or women being attacked on the suspicion of being a witch. And this in a state where Marxists are supposed to have a say in every aspect of rural life. Where is the scientific mind?

 Material progress loosened the shackles of the church in the West. In India, it seems to be the other way round. Calcutta, for instance, was a much more modern city in terms of attitude than it is today when there is a lot more money all around. Or has money gone to the wrong hands, to people who have become emboldened by their riches to assert their backwardness? Is it a rustic milieu that has found a place for itself behind all the glitter that we see? Sociologists may answer the question or they may get themselves entangled, as is often their wont, in all kinds of theories.

 What is happening in society is surely not going unnoticed. Yet nobody is speaking out, perhaps for fear of offending sentiments. And so the rot continues to set in deeper. Reformers in the 19th century also had popular sentiments to think of but that did not keep them away from their tasks. The Young Bengal had declared, ?Down with Hinduism, down with orthodoxy?. Why cannot today?s Young Bengal rise and say, ?Down with obscurantism??

 Times of course have changed. This is the age of the individual, each for himself and society be damned. During the recently held elections in the state, a few leftist leaders were heard saying on television that the reason why politics today did not attract the youth was because they had careers to think of. Yes, times are hard, careers have to be built and built in a hurry. And that leaves no time to look around and ponder. It also allows the so-called leaders of society to turn a blind eye to issues that should engage their attention and there is nobody around to tell them so.

 So let us laugh at the tiny African nation of Togo. Let us consider ourselves a superior people, even as we immerse ourselves in a darkness that is primeval to say the least. Let us continue to work in our modern settings and all the time pin our hopes on a benign star.

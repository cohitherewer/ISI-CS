 MUSICAL CHAIRS

 One of the pieces of advice that Louis Mountbatten gave to Jawaharlal Nehru was that, as India?s prime minister, Nehru should periodically shuffle around his ministers. Mountbatten thought that this would keep ministers on their toes and would stop them from building up vested interests in particular ministries. The present prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, a self-proclaimed admirer of Nehru, has never really played the shuffling game. Yesterday?s exercise, though it has been long in coming, cannot really be described as a real shuffle. The changes and the new appointments were largely cosmetic in nature. The important portfolios were left untouched. This was somewhat surprising given the track record of the home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil. The failure to appoint a minister for external affairs is also indicative of the absence of a political will. A country of India?s size and aspirations can ill afford to function without a full-time foreign minister. Even the minister of state for external affairs, who will ostensibly assist the prime minister, is not really an experienced hand. If the foreign ministry can be run for a length of time by mandarins and without a full- time head, the need for a foreign minister itself comes under a question mark.

 Even if the wisdom of Mountbatten?s suggestion is doubted, it cannot be denied that a cabinet reshuffle is one of the few instruments a prime minister has to show his approval and disapproval, to reward and to punish. Here, Mr Singh has sent out mixed signals. Mr Mani Shankar Aiyar, even most of his critics agree, has been a hard-working and energetic minister for petroleum. Yet, he has had this portfolio taken away from him. This, by any reckoning, is a punishment though its reasons are obscure or known only to the prime minister. Mr Kapil Sibal, another minister who brings a lot of energy and ability to his work, has been elevated to cabinet rank. Clearly, there is a lack of consistency. Or to put it in another way, the changes have not been dictated by a recognition of merit but by other motives which are not immediately obvious. As prime minister, Mr Singh has every right to choose his own cabinet colleagues, and his choice can also be determined by a desire to reward loyalty but any decision to appoint ministers must be based on a transparent and consistent principle. Unfortunately, it is difficult to locate such a principle in yesterday?s changes and appointments. There is nothing more demoralizing than mixed messages emanating from the top.

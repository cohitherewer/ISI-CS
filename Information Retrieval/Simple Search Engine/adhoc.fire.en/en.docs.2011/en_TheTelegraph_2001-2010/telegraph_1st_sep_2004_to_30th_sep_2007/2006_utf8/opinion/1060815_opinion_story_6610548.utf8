 TERROR BRED OF TERROR 

 Malvika Singh

 Mala Fide

 Having averted a possible disaster 

 of unimaginable proportions, Britain and America continue 

 to be threatened by terrorism. The Israeli military offensive 

 and rampant killings in Lebanon, with silent US approval 

 and therefore the assumed support of the Blair government 

 and all other allies as well, have accelerated the retaliation 

 by radical Islamist groups to prevent their people from 

 being swamped by the muscle power of the US-led Western 

 powers. The most devastating fact that has emerged is that 

 no power on this planet can stop illegal military attacks 

 on any sovereign country, based on any judgmental whim or 

 reason unless the US enforces the ceasefire. This is scary, 

 particularly because war, terrorism, militancy or peace 

 are wholly dependent on the position taken by the president 

 of the United States of America regardless of the intellectual 

 calibre of the ruler of that international power.

 This frightening reality is strengthened 

 by the mute acceptance of the invasive foreign policy of 

 the US by all allies of the Bush regime, who have thus alienated 

 vast sections of the world forcing militancy, because 

 no one country from that predominantly Western conglomeration 

 is willing to seriously initiate peace talks in an attempt 

 to forge a consensus by taking all the differing views, 

 motivations and aspirations into account. Surely that is 

 what diplomacy is all about. Why has it been replaced by 

 ruthless and unthinking military intervention? Is it because 

 of colour, creed and poverty? Is this the US definition 

 of globalization? Does the world have to fall in line 

 with the undemocratic diktats of this unipolar nation state 

 to survive? And all this in a modern age ruled by information 

 technology? This kind of unilateral foreign policy has made 

 the world an unhappy and dangerous place, no different from 

 the historical past when brute force, bloody victories, 

 and might-is-right principles ruled humanity. We have regressed. 

 Ancient Indian sages had forecast this descent into kalyug, 

 something Western cultures will find near impossible to 

 comprehend. It is much too complicated for comparatively 

 juvenile societies without strong cultural roots.

 Rich and poor

 Terrorism and militancy will not 

 abate till all the disparate groups communicate their angst 

 and their aspirations to each other to collectively find 

 solutions to both national and international problems. Till 

 this happens, huge amounts will be spent on protection 

 and not on bettering the social sector. World citizens will 

 get more and more frustrated and rapidly join radical movements 

 for want of other options. The rich nations will continue 

 to crush and exploit economically poor countries, rich 

 in natural and human resources.

 Surely this new millennium of 

 globalization should trigger a coming together and not 

 a tearing apart of the valuable diversity of this globe. 

 We should dilute the colonization of the planet by the US 

 and restore cultural and social dignity of the diverse people 

 of this planet. We should allow for more diversity and pluralism 

 and thereby restrict the robotization of the world by yankeedom. 

 Economic and military supremacy has created a modern monster 

 that has begun to dominate the world in the garb of a rogue 

 state, where dialogue has ceased to be of import and where 

 the less privileged have become the victims. To think 

 world leaders have no role of consequence in this scenario 

 is only to belittle them.

 In a United Nations where rich 

 and poor member states are equal in status and in voting 

 rights, where humanity overrules money and military power, 

 the international policy will be starkly different. That 

 truth is the lurking fear of those who control the world 

 order today. To keep the vast majority poor and dependent 

 suits the Western powers. But their mantra is now disrupting 

 the world.

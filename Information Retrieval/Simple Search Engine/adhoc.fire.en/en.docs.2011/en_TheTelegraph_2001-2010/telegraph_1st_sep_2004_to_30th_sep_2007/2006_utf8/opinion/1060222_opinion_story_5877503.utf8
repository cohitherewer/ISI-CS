The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SPOILSPORT

 All politics may be local, but not all local politics is in the public interest. Such politics is sometimes a game of oneupmanship among local leaders. The ?economic blockade? planned by the former Union minister, Mr Yashwant Sinha, in Hazaribagh later this week is a case in point. The senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party has planned the blockade in protest against the Centre?s decision to shut down a regional training institute in Hazaribagh. Mr Sinha may have a valid case. But that does not justify the form of protest he has chosen. The blockade will disrupt the transportation of coal from Hazaribagh, Mr Sinha?s parliamentary constituency, to other parts of the country. This can cause major disruptions in the operations of power plants which depend on the supply of coal from Hazaribagh. A day?s disruptions can have a snowballing effect spread over many more days. It is unfortunate that Mr Sinha?s men began the protest by forcibly closing down some Union government and public sector offices in the area. As a former Union finance minister, he should know how such disruptions harm the economy.

 There are reasons, though, to suspect that Mr Sinha?s agitation has much to do with the internal problems of the BJP?s unit in Jharkhand. On the face of it, it is aimed at the United Progressive Alliance government and the coal minister, Mr Shibu Soren, who hails from Jharkhand. But the protest has become a rallying cry for one faction of the BJP?s state unit which is known to be opposed to the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda. The stir comes close on the heels of the decision by the state BJP to expel eleven partymen. The disgruntled flock has turned the Hazaribagh protest into a show of strength. It is also ironic that a BJP-led government in the state has to tackle the agitation. The protest may, therefore, create more problems for Mr Munda than for New Delhi. Jharkhand is one of the poorest states in India and also among the worst-affected by Maoist violence. Yet, Mr Munda has managed to attract considerable industrial investments there. His next big fight could be with the spoilers within his own party.

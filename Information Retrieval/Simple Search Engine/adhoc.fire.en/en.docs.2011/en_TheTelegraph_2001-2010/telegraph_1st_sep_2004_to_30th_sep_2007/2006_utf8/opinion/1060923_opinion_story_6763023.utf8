 Letters to Editor

 Rodents in the seat of power

 Sir Why should Rats on Writers rampage (Sept 20) raise such a rumpus? These rats have made the Writers Buildings their home for long. They also know how to make themselves invisible, just like the foreign spies who trouble the mandarins inside the building. If only they hadnt relieved themselves on the chief ministers sofa, life would not have become so difficult for them. It is only when ministers are personally inconvenienced that action is taken. But none can dislodge the rats from the Writers Buildings till, maybe, a Pied Piper comes along. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Laws of piety

 Unlawful entry

Sir The editorial, Kali and the law (Sept 17), rightly points out that Hinduism is more a matter of practice and not a religion of the book. However, this practice is as dynamic as it is varied. Some may consider the panda to be the agent of god. At the same time, I think, even as a devout Hindu, that they are an absolute nuisance. Since the two points of view can never meet, the dispute would need the intervention of the court. Hence, the Calcutta high court is within its jurisdiction on the matter. However, the government should not be involved in any business other than governance, least of all in the management of temples. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anand Gupta, London 

 Sir Sundays editorial seems to have deviated from progressive thinking by casting a doubt on the Calcutta high courts decision forbidding the practice of animal sacrifice openly inside the Kalighat temple premises. If Hinduism can be rid of orthodox practices like sati and gouridan, it can surely do away with the slaughter of animals. In the absence of social reformers like Rammohun Roy and Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, there is no harm if the judiciary does the job. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit K. Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir As Hinduism is more a way of life than a religion, its sacred places are open to everyone dogs, pandas, lepers, sex workers and the poorest of the poor. The Kashi Vishwanath temple is claustrophobically small, and devotees there have to wrestle for a darshan. The access roads are narrow, where a stampede can happen anytime. Yet, the Allahabad high court has not passed a ruling to widen the lanes, perhaps by demolishing the Gyan Vapi mosque. Judicial intervention for improving the Kalighat temple indicates good intentions, but the efficacy of implementation looks doubtful. If people are not happy with the arrangements, let them not visit the temple, or work towards making things better. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir A devotee has the right to go to any temple in the country to offer prayers without being harassed by pandas. Why should a mediator be allowed to come between the worshipper and his god? The Calcutta high courts order is a step that could cleanse the puja premises of corruption. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Guha, Ontario, Canada

 Sir The Kalighat pandas have fleeced thousands of innocent devotees for years. The high courts verdict is in the interest of the devotees. Surely it cannot be reversed so easily. Instead of trying to regain entry to the temple, the pandas should try earning their living as tourist guides. They could also sell incense sticks to pilgrims. An honest employment at last could help them reform their ways. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subroto Sarkar, Pondicherry

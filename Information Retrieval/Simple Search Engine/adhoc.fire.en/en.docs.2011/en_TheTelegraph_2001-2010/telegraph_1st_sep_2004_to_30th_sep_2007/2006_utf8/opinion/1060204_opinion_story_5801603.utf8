 READ THE WORLD

 The classics, it would seem, are what the old want the young to read. Why? Because these works have survived the passage of time; they can be enjoyed by anybody living anywhere in the world (knowledge of English or a European language being taken for granted); and, perhaps most importantly, they help make better human beings. Every now and then, little bits of the world formulate their own ideas of the enduring and the universal in Art and Literature. Whether or not the rest of the world listens to them usually depends on how important these little bits are, or had been, to the rest of the world. In India, for a long time, the most important little bit was Britain ? an island particularly given to proclaiming what young men and women ought to read for their own good, and to actually producing some of this matter, usually of excellent quality, though less and less so from the latter half of the 20th century. 

 Recently, two hugely popular British writers, mostly of children?s books and fantasies, and the current poet laureate have published their reading lists of books they feel British children ought to have read before leaving school. They were asked to make up these lists by the Royal Society of Literature, and Shakespeare figures in all three. What emerges, most interestingly, from this establishment-driven effort is the inevitably local nature of such anxieties. The three list-makers, J.K. Rowling, Philip Pullman and Andrew Motion, have all declared their passionate belief in ?the democracy of reading?. The problem of ?elitism versus accessibility? finds its most anxious expression in the current debate about higher education and the National Curriculum in Mr Tony Blair?s Britain. To many there, books, and not WMD, are beginning to look like the best guarantors of democracy. 

 But what about the rest of the world ? particularly the third and/or the postcolonial one? What should its children read in order to better themselves and the worlds they live in? Are illiteracy, hunger, foeticide and genocide as inimical to the reading of the classics as iPods, computer-games and the internet? A powerful voice from a darker continent has refused to oblige the Royal Society with a ready list of books, providing instead some cryptic advice to children on reading. ?Read the books your parents hate,? Ben Okri has urged young readers. And then, ?Read the world ? it?s the most mysterious book of all.? In one stroke, the child is liberated from the book into the world, from the child?s own little world to everything that lies beyond it, even while being alerted to the creative and critical act ? reading ? through which this might happen. 

 Some children learn to read books, and some to read the world. And in this, it is sometimes easy and sometimes difficult to separate the fortunate from the unfortunate. Yet, it will be necessary, every now and then, at least for some, to wonder whether reading books might be as important as reading the world.

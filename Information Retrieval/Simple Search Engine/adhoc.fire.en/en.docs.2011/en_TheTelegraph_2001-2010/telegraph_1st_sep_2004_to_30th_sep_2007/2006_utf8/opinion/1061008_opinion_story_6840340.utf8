The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Dengue in the capital has the entire political establishment feeling feverish suddenly. There are the inevitable trails of inefficiency to suppress, the winged creatures to vanquish, and on top of it all, a stroke of sheer bad luck to have the prime ministers grandchildren join those already in the hospital for treatment. Not surprisingly, bucks are being passed at reckless speed. At a cabinet meeting recently, the Union health minister, bearing most of the brunt, tried to pass on a slice of the blame to the invincible Lalu Prasad. A. Ramadoss alleged that unhygienic conditions at railway stations was one of the factors behind the frightening spread of dengue in the city. Lalu, his teeth clenched, sat through the meeting in silence. As soon as it was over, he flung himself at Ramadoss, questioning him about the basis of his allegation. As Ramadoss struggled to find the right words to pacify a fuming Lalu, the railways minister sent off a dire warning, Arre bhai, suni sunai baton par mat jaiye (Do not go by what you get to hear). Lalu was probably hinting at the NDA rumour mills. Ramadoss, meanwhile, hadnt even begun to think. He was found nodding vigorously, eager as a beaver to buy peace with a man who continues to play kingmaker with such elan.

 The good times seem to be here for Ambika Soni. Just nine months after she was ousted from the AICC, Soni has managed to find her way back, this time to the hallowed precincts of the PMs inner coterie. Soni was one of the few ministers who visited South Africa recently. There is more. She continues to hold the charge of J amp;K, despite being a Central minister, a feat which is only shared by the defence minister and Oscar Fernandes. And in November, it would be time to pack her bags again. The Congress president is likely to visit Brussels and the buzz is that Soni will find a place on that flight too.

 Three candidates vying for the Vidisha Lok Sabha seat had called on Sonia Gandhi aide, V. George, to lobby for a party ticket. Rudrapratap Singh was called in to Georges room first, even as the other two contenders ShivKumar Umraliya and Jagdish Yadav waited patiently in the ante-room. After a while, Singh came out smiling, but it vanished as soon as he realized that his mobile phone had gone missing. The matter was brought to Georges notice and it was time for a round of grilling. The security guard ruled out the possibility of a break-in, while the integrity of the staff was thought to be beyond question. At this point, without a solution in sight, Singhs wife, Rajshree, made matters worse by shouting that the theft was the handiwork of his husbands political rivals. Needless to say, George was not amused. But he is not the one who loses his cool quickly. In a measured voice, he assured all those present that whoever had picked up the mobile by mistake would surely send it back to him in a matter of days.

 Oscar Fernandes is in the middle of a domestic crisis these days. The minister without portfolio is keen on playing a full-time role in the Congress, but his wife, Blossom, has thrown a spanner in his works. Mrs Fernandes has been requesting party bigwigs not to relieve Fernandes of his ministerial responsibilities. Oscar, gushes Blossom, has been doing a pretty good job, and there is no need to draft him into organizational duties, she argues. But there is some good news for Fernandes too. He is now a member of the exclusive henpecked husbands club, and there are the two Singhs Arjun and Natwar to keep him company.

 The annual general meeting of the Delhi Gymkhana Club a few days ago was a stormy affair. But the storm was not brewed in one of the clubs own teacups, but came from outside, via a letter published in the October issue of Club Life, the clubs official newsletter. The writer, a non-member, heaped much abuse on the prestigious watering hole: ...the service is sloppy, the glasses and the waiters uniforms seem to need washing. The membership is very Punjabi. Men salivate every time a woman walks past. Most evening the bar resembles the sitting room of an Old Peoples Home. I dont belong to it. I refuse to join a club that would take someone like me as a member. Needless to mention, Groucho Marx had introduced this mode of refusal after the Hollywood Club had offered him a membership. Coming back to the Delhi Gymkhana, the letter-writer probably enjoyed a hearty laugh over the impact of his missive. But what about the gentleman on whose shoulders lay the newsletters editorial responsibility? 

Footnote

 Power is a great leveller leftists and rightists, radicals and democrats, all behave in the most predictably similar way as soon as some form of power is thrust on them. When the AB Vajpayee government appointed a senior RSS member as the head of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, he treated the department as his personal fief. Kumudben Joshi has been sent up to the same chair by the Manmohan Singh government, whose distance from all things saffron is known all round. But she is proving to be exactly like her predecessor in very many ways. She has spurned that old faithful, the air-conditioned Ambassador car, and demanded to be provided with a Maruti Baleno. But the minister for rural development, Mahabir Prasad, is playing a spoilsport by refusing to part with the six lakhs required to procure a Baleno. What will Kumudben do now? Maybe launch a satyagraha outside Prasads office till her Baleno-wish is granted.

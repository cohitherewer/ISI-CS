The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WIN TO DEFACE

 Everybody likes to win. But victory celebrations are usually followed by responsible behaviour from the winner, and the resumption of normal business. This is expected of Mr Budhhadeb Bhattacharjee too. But the chief minister?s triumphal glee appears to have found a rather odd expression. He seems to think that brightening up other people?s walls in the state would suit his state?s ? rather, party?s ? upbeat mood. So graffiti and posters are going to be allowed again. Ever since the run-up to the elections, and the Election Commission?s interventions during that time, most people seem to have forgotten that the ban on graffiti and defacement of property had existed as law since 1976. But the political parties had flouted it so rampantly, and for so long, that such defacements had become a normal part of Bengal?s political and aesthetic culture. The EC, this time, had simply insisted on enforcing again an already existing law, which exists to protect the people?s right to not have their property defaced and vandalized.

 To revert to breaking the law, almost with a vengeance, and then try to pass it off as celebratory largesse, is irresponsible, to say the least ? especially coming from the chief minister himself. To allow political graffiti and posters would also mean, by logical extension, allowing loudspeakers ? in hospital premises and near schools and colleges? ? and then, by further extension, allowing several other forms of lawlessness and uncivil good cheer that Mr Bhattacharjee?s party and its cadre have made themselves notorious for in Bengal. Even if not interpreted as aimed at the EC, the chief minister?s high-hearted gesture might be seen as an exercise of a freshly reinforced form of power that disregards with impunity a basic human right and civic principle. Such a cavalier attitude in Mr Bhattacharjee himself, and what it reveals of his party?s working culture, cannot bode well for law and order in West Bengal.

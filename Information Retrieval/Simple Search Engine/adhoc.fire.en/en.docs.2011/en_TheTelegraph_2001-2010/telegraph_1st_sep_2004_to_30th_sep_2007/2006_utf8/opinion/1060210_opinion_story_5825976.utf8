The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FAST FORWARD

 The Central Statistical Organization?s estimate that the gross domestic product will grow 8.1 per cent this fiscal is a confirmation that the bull run on Dalal Street, the rise in business confidence, and the feeling of prosperity on Main Street all have a solid basis in the ?fundamentals? of the economy. This will be the second time that the Indian economy has posted a GDP growth of over 7 per cent for three consecutive years, the first time being between 1994-1997. One reason for the high growth could be the change in the base year to 1999-2000, but then the growth rate for 2004-05 has also been revised upwards. An 8.1 per cent growth on top of 7.5 per cent in 2004-05 is not to be scoffed at. As in the mid-Nineties, the expansion is being led by services and manufacturing, while agriculture continues to be in the doldrums. Much of the growth in recent years has occurred due to a sharp drop in interest rates, which has led to a huge increase in retail credit and has stoked consumption demand. At the same time, exports have been buoyant, while companies have started to go in for capital expenditure. This rise in investment demand, together with a good rabi crop, should buttress growth.

 Nevertheless, the 8.1 per cent growth rate, coupled with red-hot asset markets, does raise the question ? is the economy overheating? Recall that a similar situation in the mid-Nineties led to an economic slump that lasted for years. There is little doubt that a large part of the current boom is cyclical. However, there are important structural changes as well. Gross domestic saving was 29.1 per cent in 2004-05, well above the 25.5 per cent reached during the height of the mid-Nineties boom. Gross domestic capital formation too is well above the mid-Nineties? level. Further, the rise in the wholesale price index was much higher in the mid-Nineties, while prime lending rates were around 15 per cent. At the micro level, companies have become far more efficient and whole new sectors of the economy have sprung up, like BPO and IT services. The indiscriminate capacity expansion of the Nineties is largely absent. But while the current boom has a more sustainable basis, there continue to be areas of concern. Higher oil prices could bloat the current account deficit. Corporate earnings growth is slowing. Infrastructure bottlenecks continue to hold the economy back and urgent reforms are needed in sectors like power and coal. If the prime minister wants to achieve 10 per cent growth, his government will have to be serious about taking the reform process forward.

 STATES INTEREST

 Compromises invariably breed further compromises. This is the most charitable comment that can be made on the Supreme Courts decision to do away with the domicile clause for being elected to the Rajya Sabha. The matter was brought before the apex court because of a public-interest litigation by a former member of the Rajya Sabha, Mr Kuldip Nayar, who pointed out that political interests were sending persons to the Rajya Sabha who were not residents of the state from which they were being elected. This violated, Mr Nayar held, the original purpose of the Rajya Sabha. He was indeed right. The Rajya Sabha, as any study of the making of the Indian Constitution makes clear, was born out of an attempted compromise between the Westminster model and the constitution of the United States of America. In Westminster, to preserve monarchy within the framework of democracy, the House of Lords was thought of as an upper house that represented the views and interests of the Crown. (By convention, members of the House of Lords do not vote in an election since they stand above all party affiliations.) The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution, following Westminster practices, created an upper house. But a republic, by definition, could not have lords representing a monarch. The makers of the Constitution solved this by deriving an idea from the US constitution. They created the Rajya Sabha which, like the US Senate, would articulate the interests of the state. It was assumed that those who sat in the Rajya Sabha, after being elected through a complicated system of proportional representation of the numbers in the Bidhan Sabhas, would be domiciled in the state from which they were being elected. An amendment to the Representation of the People Act in 2003 did away with the domicile clause. Mr Nayar in his PIL had challenged this amendment. The dismissal of the PIL by the Supreme Court restores the status quo ante. Thus, members of the Rajya Sabha can now be elected from anywhere in India.

 In its ruling, the Supreme Court observed that the Rajya Sabha does not act as a champion of local interests. Without quibbling on words, it needs to be pointed out that the Rajya Sabha may not represent local interests, but it is supposed to represent, as indeed its very name suggests, the interests of the state. It is also reasonable to assume, as the founding fathers of the Constitution did in their wisdom, that someone residing in a state will be better informed about the states interests than an outsider to the state.

 The Supreme Courts desire to protect the federal nature of Indias polity is beyond question. But by upholding the removal of the domicile clause, the Supreme Court may have harmed the balance, created by the Constitution, between the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha.

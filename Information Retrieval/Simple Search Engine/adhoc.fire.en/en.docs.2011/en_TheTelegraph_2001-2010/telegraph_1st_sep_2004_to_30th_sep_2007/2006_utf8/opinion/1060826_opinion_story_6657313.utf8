 BAD HAIR DAYS 

 Is Darrell Hair an umpire who fights 

 for fair play or is he just a big bad Aussie?

 Controversy has always been his 

 middle name. Still, the fiasco at the Oval on August 21 

 can easily be regarded as Darrell Bruce Hairs career-best 

 in umpiring heavy-handedness. First, he ruled that Pakistani 

 players had tampered with the ball. Then, when the sulking 

 Pakistani team refused to take the field, he and fellow 

 umpire Billy Doctrove whipped off the bails and declared 

 that Pakistan had forfeited the match and that England had 

 won by default. 

 So what was Hair doing showing 

 an unyielding commitment to the rules of the game or was 

 he being downright pig-headed? Was Hair a strict disciplinarian? 

 Was he fighting for fair play or was he really a big bad 

 Aussie, a mini Hitler (as Imran Khan called 

 him earlier this week) whos prejudiced against teams 

 from the sub-continent? 

 Such questions have dogged Darrell 

 Hair throughout his career as an international umpire. Thats 

 perhaps why no one is talking about the other umpire involved 

 in the Oval incident. Indeed, the 53-year-old Australian 

 from New South Wales, who used to be a handy medium fast 

 bowler for North Sydney before a knee injury cut short his 

 playing career, has always shown a penchant for getting 

 into the crosshairs of a controversy. 

 Unfortunately for Hair, most of 

 his hotly disputed decisions have gone against teams from 

 the sub-continent, leading to accusations that his rulings 

 stem more from racial bias than from a scrupulous adherence 

 to the letter and spirit of the laws of cricket. 

 In his very first match as an 

 international umpire in the Australia vs India Test match 

 in Adelaide in 1992, Hair gave as many as eight lbw decisions 

 against India, while all but two of the appeals from the 

 India side were rejected. 

 But that was nothing compared 

 to the storm he created when he called Sri Lankan spinner 

 Muthiah Muralitharan seven times from the bowlers 

 end for throwing during the Australia vs Sri 

 Lanka Test match at the MCG in 1995. 

 International cricketing journal 

 Wisden had this to say about the incident: ...unusually, 

 Hair made his judgment from the bowlers end, and several 

 minutes passed before the crowd realised that Muralitharans 

 elbow, rather than his foot, was at fault. 

 Not content with having become 

 Sri Lankas pet hate, Hair took his battle with Muralitharan 

 a step further when in 1998, he said in his autobiography, 

 Decision Maker an umpires story, that 

 the Sri Lankan spinners action was diabolical. 

 His remark led the Sri Lankan cricket board to ask the ICC 

 to suspend him as an umpire. And Hair then threatened to 

 sue the president of the board for accusing him of bias. 

 Hairs history with the Pakistan 

 team has been no less fraught. Among other incidents, in 

 January 2004, during the New Zealand vs Pakistan match in 

 Wellington, New Zealand, Hair and fellow umpire Billy Bowden 

 reported Pakistan fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed for suspected 

 bowling action. 

 It is this long list of alleged 

 injustices by him that prompts players like Sri Lankas 

 former captain Arjuna Ranatunga to describe Hair so scathingly: 

 He has the habit of always picking on Asian players 

 for some reason that I cannot fathom, says Ranatunga. 

 Former Bengal player and national selector Sambaran Banerjee 

 seconds that. Quite clearly, he seems prejudiced, 

 says Banerjee. 

 Even so, Hair has so far seemed 

 to enjoy the confidence of his ICC colleagues. A member 

 of the ICCs elite panel of international umpires, 

 Hair, who is married to an Englishwoman and lives in the 

 UK, has officiated in 76 Test matches and 124 one-day internationals. 

 Altogether, he has umpired in 131 first class matches since 

 he made his debut as a first class umpire in 1988. 

 Teams that get the brunt of his 

 controversial decisions and rulings may consider him a big 

 bully, intent on throwing his weight around out there in 

 the middle, but many of his colleagues actually describe 

 him as a man of principle who will not brook any nonsense. 

 Darrell has his own way 

 of doing things, Simon Taufel, a fellow umpire, has 

 been quoted as saying. According to Taufel, Hair is the 

 sort of individual who is prepared to stand his ground and 

 enter areas where many would refuse to go. Kiwi umpire Billy 

 Bowden, who counts himself among Hairs friends, has 

 told the media that he is a determined and resolute individual. 

 Even Indian all-rounder Ajit Agarkar 

 says that Inzamam was wrong to walk off the field in response 

 to Hairs decision. If he had to protest he should 

 have approached the umpires when the ball was being changed 

 or gone to the match referee, he says. 

 Predictably, the Australian media 

 cannot sing his praises enough. Phil Wilkins, a sports writer 

 for The Sydney Morning Herald, had this to say after 

 the Oval incident: Hair is a man of the strictest 

 principle, an official absolutely true to the game, an umpire 

 of the fairest, most unswerving practices. Clearly, 

 you will either love him or hate him. 

 But though he is being reviled 

 in the Pakistan press, even so-called non-partisan commentators 

 like Geoffrey Boycott and Ian Botham now feel that in the 

 latest incident at least, Hair got too high-handed for comfort. 

 Both have said that the ICC should have taken steps to manage 

 the situation rather than let it escalate into this kind 

 of unholy mess. 

 Perhaps that is Hairs biggest 

 failing not being able to manage a tricky situation well. 

 He may be on the side of right or he may not be (though 

 that question is crucial to his continuing on the ICCs 

 umpiring panel), but what he is certainly terrible at is 

 man-management and public relations. 

 Still, despite all the bad press 

 he has received in recent days, his autobiography is selling 

 like hot cakes. Who said a little thing like bad publicity 

 would hurt a man like Darrell Hair?

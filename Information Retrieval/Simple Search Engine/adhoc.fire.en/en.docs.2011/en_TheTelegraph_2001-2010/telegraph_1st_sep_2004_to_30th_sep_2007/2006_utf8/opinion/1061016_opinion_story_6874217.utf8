 NEW PEAKS

 It has taken just five months for the Sensex to recover fully from the May meltdown and record a new high. It is not only the Indian market that has bounced back the Dow, the Straits Times index and the Mexican market have all notched up new records. The rebound is the result of major changes in the global economic environment since May, when fears of a spike in American interest rates led to the crash. Since then, interest rates in the United States of America have topped out, worries about a withdrawal of liquidity have receded, and hopes of a soft landing for the world economy have increased. Corporate results, so far, have been better than expected. Crude-oil prices are far below their peak and commodity prices too have fallen, leading to lower raw-material prices. Foreign portfolio flows to emerging markets have resumed. The upshot has been a return of optimism at the bourses.

 There are many reasons for the buoyancy. The Indian economy is on a roll, as the latest industrial production figures testify. The boom, so far, has been based on consumption demand, which has been fuelled by low rates of interest. Even if interest rates are hiked further a strong possibility, given the 30 per cent rate at which bank credit is growing and consumption growth slows down a little, the slack can easily be taken up by investment demand, with corporates planning to expand capacity in a big way. At the same time, the outsourcing story is going from strength to strength, and more and more investors are buying into the long-term India story. Of late, another trend has started taking shape investors have begun discriminating between emerging markets. For instance, the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China used to be lumped together, but investors have now realized that while Brazil and Russia are dependent on commodity prices, China and India are not. The result has been that the Indian and Chinese stock markets have outperformed the others. Studies have shown that the Indian market has a relatively low correlation with commodity prices. Moreover, unlike the export-dependent economies of east and southeast Asia, the Indian economy is much more insular, with domestic consumption being the biggest driver of demand. In the event of a global slowdown, therefore, the impact on the Indian economy will be comparatively muted.

 For the Indian market, however, the problem is one of high valuations. India is now the most expensive emerging market, even if its higher rate of earnings growth is taken into account. While it is true that the momentum may carry the market to new peaks, the high valuations call for caution.

 RULE AND RUIN

 - Dispassionate account of a tragedy

 A nation shamed

 Ayodhya: 6 December 1992

 By P.V. Narasimha Rao, 

 Penguin, Rs 395

 This is the story of a day that shook India as few other events have done since 1947. There had been other events ? the assassinations of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948 and of two prime ministers, Indira and Rajiv Gandhi, in 1984 and 1991 respectively ? that shocked the nation. Mutinies, big and small, rose and fell in different parts of the country at different times. But December 6,1992, was different from all of these in both scope and scale. India had known communal riots in the years before and after independence. But that December day in Ayodhya, the secular fabric of the country received its fiercest blow ever. India, many thought at the time, would never be the same again. Those who perpetrated the Ayodhya tragedy thought it heralded a new India; others feared it was the end of the secular, multicultural nation they had known. 

 The story of that day has since been told many times over. It will surely be told many times hereafter as future historians and other chroniclers revisit the day or as other events of the future bring the spotlight back on Ayodhya. But this book brings alive the story from a man who was at the centre of it all. P.V. Narasimha Rao was the prime minister of India that fateful moment in the country?s history. He knew and saw it all. But did he do enough to prevent the demolition of the Babri Masjid? Was he not as responsible for the event as the sangh parivar zealots who actually brought the 16th-century structure to the ground? Worse, did he too have a hidden agenda and thereby connive at the villainy? 

 Rao continued to be prime minister until 1996 and lived for eight more years. In the last years of his life, he began recording his experiences of the events leading to the December 6 catastrophe. He wanted the book to be published posthumously. 

 If that raised expectations that Rao?s recollections would bring to light hitherto unknown facts or reveal new faces of the major players of the Ayodhya episode, the book does little to fulfil them. Thanks to the intense political and media campaigns that accompanied the event and its aftermath, most of the facts recalled in the book are fairly well known. Except in its details, the book does not really offer many new revelations.

 That, however, takes nothing away from the book?s value as a historical document. The most striking impression that it leaves is about the author himself. The heat and dust of the day settled long ago, a calm, dispassionate rendering of the event and an objective, de-politicized assessment of its meaning are what one would expect in a book on Ayodhya now. Rao, the most scholarly prime minister India has had since Jawaharlal Nehru, largely succeeds in offering such a view of Ayodhya. 

 His story of Ayodhya begins on a cold December night in 1949, when a group of men stealthily walked into the Babri Masjid , carrying a bag containing water from the Sarayu river, idols of Ram and a copper urn, washed the floor of the sanctum sanctorum with the water, placed the idol on a piece of cloth and broke into a chant of Ram worship. Only then, the two dozen-odd policemen posted outside the shrine came to know of the trespass that was to lay the foundation for future shocks at Ayodhya. The next day, Ayodhya was abuzz with rumours of the divine appearance of Ram?s idol at the shrine and crowds thronged to it in defiance of the prohibitory orders issued by the district authorities. If the Ayodhya of 1992 symbolized the failure of the state, that night in December 1949 marked the beginning of that failure. 

 The new story of Ayodhya began in 1984, when the Dharam Samsad of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad decided to start a movement for the ?liberation? of the Ayodhya shrine, now called the Ram Janmabhoomi, as well as of two other places of worship at Mathura and at Varanasi. The burden of Rao?s song, however, is the political transformation of the Ayodhya movement. It started during V.P. Singh?s prime ministership, but gained momentum after Rao assumed office in 1991. According to him, Singh managed to avert a crisis at Ayodhya mainly because of the tough stand taken by Mulayam Singh Yadav as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. With Kalyan Singh from the Bharatiya Janata Party succeeding Yadav, and doing everything to implement the saffron agenda, Rao had no such hope. 

 In two separate chapters, Rao answers the question that he faced most often at the time of the Ayodhya tragedy and in the years after it. Why did he not impose president?s rule in UP in order to protect the historic monument and, more important, the secular fabric of the nation? He gives two broad reasons for his action. The state governor had warned of a violent backlash against such Central intervention; even Rao was not sure that a situation had actually arisen to warrant it, as Article 356 put it. The other reason was the Centre?s faith in the assurances that the UP government gave to the Supreme Court, till the last moment, that the kar sevaks would not be allowed to damage the mosque or build any structure on the disputed land. 

 Obviously, Rao?s answers will not satisfy his critics. But the main virtue of the book lies in its being more a historic document than a judgment of the event. The author pleads his case without excessive emotion and in a lucid, unadorned style. There is just an attempt at offering his own meaning of Ayodhya. Whether one sees Ayodhya as Rao?s monumental political failure or sympathizes with his case, the book will remain an invaluable source for future explorations of the subject.

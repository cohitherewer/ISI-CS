 Unsafe territory

 Sir The accident in the Bhatdih mines in Dhanbad proves that a majority of coal mines in the country are unsafe (Miners die in gas chamber, Sep 8). There cannot be any compromise on the safety of miners and both the unions and the management must take the blame for this accident. In most mines, there are huge water-bearing aquifers in the vicinity of the walls. Often, steps are not taken to measure the thickness of these walls, thereby increasing the risks of an accident. The geo-technical properties of the overlying rock layer are also overlooked, in the name of meeting production targets. 

 The real problem in the mining industry is its lack of vision. Recently, the district administration in Piparia in Madhya Pradesh faced a peculiar problem houses started developing cracks on their walls. Soon, it was found that this was due to old, abandoned mines in the vicinity, which had not been properly stowed with certified material like rocks or sand. The management should work in tandem to avoid such lapses and ensure that working conditions improve in coal mines. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The death of miners do not surprise us any more. In fact, disasters in coal mines appear to have been accepted as routine incidents by the authorities. This despite the fact that Indias safety record in mining is abysmal. One of the main reasons for this is that whenever an accident takes place in mines, the authorities try their best to hush up the matter instead of taking any corrective measures. The lives of miners are worth very little and the safety measures exist in paper only. The government should come down heavily on the guilty and stop the exploitation of miners in the hands of the authority. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Yet another accident, this time in the Bhatdih colliery in Dhanbad. According to reports, a blast was followed by a fire caused by the accumulation of poisonous gases, which led to the death of the trapped miners. Blasts such as this one are common in coal mines. They are usually followed by a coal dust explosion, which cuts off the air supply underground, killing miners. To make mines safer, coal bed methane extraction has been started in some parts of the world. This process has numerous advantages: it makes the mines safer, produces a natural gas which also serves as an eco-friendly industrial fuel and helps check the emission of green house gases. 

 There are many coal mines in operation in India, but steps to make them safer with the help of technology are few and far between. The accident in Bhatdih should serve as a warning to the coal ministry. It should start the process of extraction of dangerous gases in a phased manner. This might take a few years but it needs to be undertaken on a war-footing. Hopefully, the coal companies will now take steps to ensure the long-term safety of miners. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The death of 53 miners in Bhatdih brings to mind the Chasnala tragedy in Bihar, which claimed many lives in the Seventies. In fact, the tragedy at Chasnala inspired the cult movie, Kaala Patthar, starring Amitabh Bachchan. That things havent changed much is evident from the Bhatdih incident. The main reason for these accidents is the poor maintenance of mines. The authorities should try and improve safety standards and punish those who are responsible for such accidents. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Pulling up the socks

 Sir The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has quite correctly expressed his concerns over Bangladesh fanning terrorism in India. Bhattacharjee gave vent to his views during the chief ministers conference on internal security (Stinker for Bangla, Sep 6). This is not the first time that Bhattacharjee has pointed an accusing finger against Bangladesh and we need to thank the chief minister for being alert to the threat to Indias eastern borders. Had Bhattacharjee been a politician without any sense of responsibility, he would not have taken the trouble to point fingers at a neighbouring country planning to create mischief on Indian soil. Bhattacharjees political opponents should learn a lesson from him and work together to tighten Indias security. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Bidyut Datta,

 Sir The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has exhorted all the chief ministers to be alert in the face of the terror threat that looms large over the country. He has also asked the states to strengthen internal security arrangements. Per- haps, it would be better if the prime minister personally monitored these aspects with the help of the home ministry and took appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the people. After all, isnt it true that some of our state leaders have failed to contain the threats posed by Maoists, busy as they are mouthing worthless rhetoric?

 Yours faithfully, 

 M.M. Kale,

 Sir It is unlikely that we will see the end of terrorism soon. Therefore it is necessary to involve ordinary people and strengthen the intelligence network to counter the threat posed by militants. But this does not mean that the police will be given the right to harass citizens for information. Instead, the police should seek their active cooperation to thwart a terror strike. If common people keep an eye on trouble, they will be able to help the police catch terrorists even before they manage to shed blood. Terrorists will also find it difficult to strike as there will be thousands of eyes watching their every move.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govind Das Dujari,

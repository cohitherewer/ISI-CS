 SLEAZE AND ALL THAT

Malvika Singh

 It is all so very sordid. Sleaze, heroin, cocaine, rape, criminality, corruption, harassment of the law-abiding citizen hit us all in the face each day through the television and newspapers. And then, of course, there is the farce of ?roll-backs?. There is endless talk in the cabinet and outside on the need for an oil price hike, followed by an attack by our populist political parties on the raising of the price. We are then bombarded with information that the petroleum minister is in meeting with the Congress president who has asked for a roll back. 

 This bit of information conjures up images of the ?confusion? that seems to prevail in government ? is the price hike debatable after it has been approved by the cabinet? Does the cabinet have to get ?approval? from the party on all decisions it takes? For how much longer will the left parties, who are not part of the coalition, carry on rabble-rousing every time the government of India moves? When will the sabotage end? 

 As this goes to press, it appears that the prime minister will stick to his guns, stick with the decision of the cabinet, and not allow a rollback. It is exactly what he must do, for only then will he be seen to be effective. The perception, whether true or false, has been that the prime minister is merely ?standing in? for the Congress president. Clearly that is not the case. Manmohan Singh runs the government and Sonia Gandhi leads the Congress and that is how it should be. 

 However, many would like to see the prime minister being more proactive and decisive on policy initiatives. The left seems to have created the impression that whenever it wields a whip, the prime minister backtracks because he is unclear about Sonia Gandhi?s position on whatever the issue is, and is insecure about taking the hard decisions that may well have serious consequences. This time Manmohan Singh seems to have ignored the populist cries allowing good economic sense to dominate his decision. 

 New ideas?

 Dole is a dirty word. It holds back growth and development. It is the only sop that political parties use in economically poor societies where they have failed, over decades, to deliver dignity of life and living, where they have failed miserably to deliver food, water, clothing and shelter, let alone education and health services, and where they have achieved one thing alone, the creation of effective corrupt practices. These traits are the hallmark of societies where an exploitative political leadership has reduced their polity to a banana republic. India has been resilient and has taken the knocks that come with rampant corruption in her stride. The difference today is that all the political dispensations are virtually the same, much like fraternal twins, and there is no real choice for good and honest governance. That is India?s tragedy. 

 There is that predictable and failed element in the Congress that is smug in the fact that the BJP is in a crisis and therefore, the Congress will rule. How wrong they are, how intellectually limited, how destructively exploitative and complacent. Not so long ago, India was saying the same things about the Congress. The political pundits thought that the BJP would gain seats, that the Congress would be reduced to double digits. They were all in for a surprise. Predictable populism could well become the other face of the India Shining coin. 

 Where are the sane, intelligent voices in the political space? Where are the new ideas and initiatives to deal with poverty and unemployment? Why has the planning commission not addressed the question of what mechanisms are needed to harness the strengths of traditional India in an effort to combat the unemployment problem without forcing an exodus from rural India? Why is the service sector given short shrift? Why isn?t tourism given the status of an industry? Where is the leadership of ideas in a changed age?

 A NEW LINE OF THINKING

 BIDYUT CHAKRABARTY

 The anti-reservations stir launched by members of the medical fraternity has brought back the ?quota system? into the limelight. The state often discriminates against one group of people while favouring another. The idea of ?recognition? is thus political because it is justified keeping in mind a specific type of power relationship. Reservations may accord recognition to the disadvantaged sections of the society but a politically liberal society cannot endorse social discrimination as the idea of citizenship is universal. What we therefore require are special rights for minorities who are identified as disadvantaged groups. 

 This argument draws on the idea that citizens are differentiated and hence unequal. Therefore, different communities should have different rights as citizens. There are two significant implications of this conceptualization: first, differentiated citizenship justifies discrimination in favour of cultural minorities and second, it factors in cultural distinctiveness as a denominator to challenge attempts at homogenizing communities with clear socio-cultural differences.

 A society that rejects differentiated citizenship in favour of universal citizenship insists that the latter give up their identity and merge with the majority. This is clearly a case of cultural imperialism because norms and values of the privileged majority acquire salience and therefore any opposition to them provokes consternation among those who tend to belittle the importance of historical processes in dividing mankind.

 Divide and gain

 There are thus strong arguments in favour of reservations in a multicultural society such as ours. But difficulties arise when groups or communities that deserve reservation are identified on the basis of ascribed identities such as caste. Similarly, reservation in higher education seems to be an empty slogan because seats for SCs and STs remain vacant for lack of applicants. The reasons are not difficult to find. The latest statistics released by the Union ministry of human resource development shows that while 73 per cent of SC students quit school before taking school leaving exams, the figures for the ST students (79 per cent) are worse. When contrasted with the prevalent high gross enrolment ratio for both the groups, the drop-out rates reveal that unfavourable socio-economic circumstances force many of these children to take up odd jobs. 

 Given this reality, reservations in higher education makes no sense so long as drop-out rates in schools are alarmingly high. What is required is to increase literacy levels among the poor by creating conditions in which benefits for going to school outweighs the alternative of working for survival. Otherwise, the benefits of reservation would continue to be uneven. The affluent sections within socially backward communities would be better-off with such an arrangement. It would help only the creamy layer to grab the advantages. Thus the social justice agenda will always remain a distant goal.

 It is difficult to suggest a solution to get out of the present imbroglio. One may begin by taking into account most seriously the ?creamy layer judgment? of the Supreme Court. Unless one reviews whether it is appropriate to extend reservations to the creamy layer from one generation to another. 

 Will the cause of social justice be served if reservations are confined to first generation learners or further? This is the question that needs to be addressed. And the answer may lie in differentiated citizenship, which is a powerful device to achieve social justice. However, this scheme could cause serious disturbances unless it is conceptualized in the affirmative action mould. Merely extending a blanket license to those differentiated by virtue of birth will not do.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SILLY MAN FROM SHANGHAI 

 The internet has certainly revolutionized the modern world. But it has also bred a global community of recklessly silly people. It reduces adults, across classes and cultures, to fits of obsessively stupid behaviour that comparable inventions ? trains or telephones ? never quite managed to inspire. Or perhaps human beings always had the potential to be silly and obsessive, and the internet just provided them with ways of realizing it more efficiently and of finding other people to do this with. A young man from Shanghai ? Edward Lear would have loved him ? has offered his soul for sale in the Chinese equivalent of e-Bay, and has even attracted 58 bidders. Most incredibly, the proprietors of this site have conducted what sounds like a perfectly serious exchange with this man over this issue. They want proof that he can provide the goods, and have allowed him to sell his soul only if he can provide written permission from a ?higher authority?. Discussions of the metaphysical implications of this situation among those who have earnest stakes in the human soul have been equally mindless ? along predictably Faustian lines.

 Some of the internet silliness can be less innocuous than this and actually quite dark. There are suicide websites where similarly inclined people from different parts of the world coordinate their last moments in front of webcams so that they can all watch one another die. In Germany, a man who eats human bodyparts got another man to agree to be eaten. Not only did this man agree to be eaten, but he also agreed to be turned on by the idea. There were serious discussions after this on the ambiguous nature of adult consent, the perversities of appetite (sexual and otherwise), and so on. On a less grim note, a slice of bread which popped out of the toaster with the face of the Virgin Mary miraculously imprinted on it had also been put up for sale on an internet auction. (The toaster should have been canonized.) Sad old men have offered themselves for adopted grandfatherhood to bidding families, and virginities similarly hiked and hawked. And in the chat world, the possibilities of being obnoxious, inventive or sinister are bottomless.

 So what is it about the internet that inspires bizarre or mindless behaviour? Perhaps it is a combination of anonymity, the allure of being anybody and nobody, and sitting alone behind a machine that is, in spite of its limitless human connectivity, just a machine. Everybody is capable of being bored, lonely, aroused or attention-seeking ? sometimes simultaneously and quite desperately so. The vast democracy of the internet ? difficult to legislate and easy to manipulate ? allows such foolish, mad moments to bear strange, uninhibited and sometimes fascinating, even dangerous fruit. But it is this very freedom ? including the freedom to escape being accountable for one?s cyber-actions ? that also makes endless room for unbridled silliness.

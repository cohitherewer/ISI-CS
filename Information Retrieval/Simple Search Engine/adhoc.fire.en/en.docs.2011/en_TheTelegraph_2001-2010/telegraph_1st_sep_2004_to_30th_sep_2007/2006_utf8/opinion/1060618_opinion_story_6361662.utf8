 Letters to Editor

 Old communist?s new lessons

 Sir ? It is wonderful to know that Jyoti Basu has agreed to teach the ?freshers? of the West Bengal assembly (?House class in Basu?s house?, June 10). He is a gracious gentleman indeed. But what exactly is he going to teach? The favourite chapters of communists ? gheraos, bandhs, trade unionism, and so on ? are all out of the new syllabus approved by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The new chief minister?s favourites are FDIs, private sector etc. Has Jyotibabu read up on the new subjects well enough to teach the young Turks? 

 Yours faithfully, 

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Lip service

 Sir ? The way the Punjabi pop singer, Mika, kissed the upcoming actor, Rakhi Sawant, during his birthday bash has created quite a stir in the Page 3 world and outside (?Rakhi fumes after Mika mouthful?, June 11). A lot of people are eager to dismiss the incident as yet another attempt by Sawant to hog the limelight. Her last attempt was in the form of vulgar gyrations, which got a stage show in interior Maharashtra cancelled. Amid the present ruckus, it is important to remember that every individual ? and this includes sex workers ? has the right to protect his self-respect. It would be wrong to assume that a woman in the glamour business does not care about her dignity.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? If Rakhi Sawant cannot live without attention, then the media are falling over one another to supply it to her. The paparazzi and their favourite celebrities enjoy a symbiotic relationship. While the sudden splash of Sawant?s face in newspapers and television channels all over the country must be indirectly boosting her career, the media too have much to gain by sensationalizing the really insignificant event. It would be, therefore, wrong to point an accusing finger at Sawant alone. However, as a reader I plead that we be spared of the daily updates of the trivial story at the cost of more important news stories.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Western influence has so permeated Indian society that the once-distinct line between decency and unacceptable behaviour has got blurred. This has lead to the rise in the kind of objectionable behaviour as that displayed by Mika. Rakhi Sawant had every right to express her outrage at the forced kiss. It is no use citing arguments such as ?item girls? are creatures of loose morals. The least courtesy that Mika could have showed his guests was to be decent with them. However, given the rapidly changing values of the youth of India ? remember Rahul Mahajan? ? the day is not far when such conduct as Mika?s would become the rule rather than an aberration. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ramya Ganesh, Cuttack

 Baby boom

 Sir ? Our hearts really go out to the poor little rich Brangelina kid (?Hello! Baby?s on the Net?, June 8). With the intrusive media always on her trail, the child will never have a normal childhood. For this, none but her celebrity parents are to blame. 

 I remember how Sourav Ganguly, then yet to become a star, had invited mediamen to his home because Sachin Tendulkar would come for lunch. Photographs are for public consumption. And hence the idea of selling the Jolie-Pitt newborn?s photo, ostensibly for charity. So far, so good. But it is only when photographers discover skeletons in the cupboard ? like David Beckham?s Rebecca Loos or Hugh Grant?s Divine Brown ? that all hell breaks loose. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Letters to Editor

 Too little, too late

 Sir ? Sukanta Chaudhuri?s article ,?Road to dereliction?(July 19), was very informative. However, I would like to add some other equally important points other than those that have been highlighted by Chaudhuri. First, the construction of the highway between Barasat and Raichak will adversely affect underground aquifers that are vital to preserve the underground water table and the supply of water for irrigation and drinking purposes. Second, any major disturbance of the aquifers and aqueducts will also adversely affect the natural process of detoxification of city sewers, resulting in massive contamination of the underground drinking water supply. There are glaring examples of this in Mexico, China and, to some extent, Brazil where massive construction activities on wetlands have caused a lot of damage. Perhaps, it would be a good idea if the concerned authorities look at alternate routes for the proposed link. This would ensure that there is minimum disturbance to Calcutta?s wetlands even as steps are taken to develop the state.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tapan Dutta,

 Sir ? It seems that Biman Bose has suddenly realized that Calcutta is now left only with the Brigade Parade Ground for its sustenance. (?Shark shield for wetlands?, July 21). The Left Front has been in power in West Bengal for nearly three decades and Biman Bose has served as the front chairman for sometime now. Yet, Bose has been unaware of the fact that promoters have been filling up water bodies in and around Calcutta with active support from a section of the comrades. It is surprising that Bose has realized that the destruction of wet-lands was damaging the city?s eco-system only now. Perhaps the real reason behind Bose?s concern is that the land sharks are now eyeing property belonging to his party comrades, as there is nothing left to steal.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A. Roy Mukherjee,

 Sir ? Large tracts of wetlands in north and west Calcutta are now lost forever, thanks to the promoter-politician nexus. The communist government should squarely take the blame for this environmental degradation. However, one hopes that Biman Bose is able to break this unholy alliance and save the remaining stretches of this precious resource in the city. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta

 Less transparent

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that the Union cabinet has compromised its biggest achievement thus far ? the Right to Information Act ? by deciding to drop the clause that stated that ?file-notings? by bureaucrats have to be made public. File-notings are the main sources of information contained in government files. This is so because replies to petitions on the part of Central Public Information officers are invariably aimed at holding back information. This just goes to show that the CPIOs conveniently utilize the provisions under Section 8 of the RTI Act to deny necessary information.

 Even if the Centre wished to amend the RTI Act, it should have proceeded to do so after a detailed discussion between the Central Information Commission and the government officers who support the move to exclude file notings from the purview of the RTI Act. Unfortunately, the government?s move comes only a few days after a fortnight-long campaign to publicize the merits of the RTI Act by some renowned media organizations. 

 In this context, it is important to remember that the RTI Act has created a fear-syndrome in government departments and undertakings and most of the problems mentioned in RTI petitions are instantaneously solved just by filing first petitions with the CPIOs. This is why most CPIOs discourage accepting petitions under the RTI Act. Dilution of the Act in any manner will only strengthen the hands of the guilty parties in offices covered by the RTI Act.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It has been reported that the Centre has approved the proposed amendment of the Right to Information Act. In the name of removing ambiguities in the law, the government has decided to keep file notings out of the preview of the Act. This is the result of strong lobbying on the part of politicians and bureaucrats who are uneasy about disclosing their way of working. 

 Worse, the decision by the United Progressive Alliance government also goes against a citizen?s fundamental right to have access to information and transparency as enshrined in the Constitution, which is crucial to the functioning of a democracy and its capacity to curtail corruption. More importantly, such a right also ensures that the government is accountable to the general public. The decision to do away with such a vital clause should be criticized in the strongest terms. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Milap Choraria, 

 Delhi

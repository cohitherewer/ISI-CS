 FREE TO PROFIT

 Whether it is industry or agriculture, the only way to run it profitably is on sound business principles. The West Bengal government?s proposal to open some state-run farms to private investors is, therefore, a welcome move. Like the sick public-sector industries, these farms have long been languishing as loss-making units. The only justification for their existence has been the employment it provides to some people. Worse still, they give no support to the farmers for whose benefit they were set up. These farms have thus remained a glaring example of all that is wrong with the state?s initiative in agriculture. The government has to realize that it has no business to stand between the farmers and the market. Private investments can make farming profitable business and, at the same time, help farmers diversify their livelihood options. What kind of contracts the farmers enter into with private investors should naturally be a matter between the two sides. It should be up to them to decide if the farmers would sell their produce to the companies investing in the production. Similarly, the prices at which the farm produces would be sold should be left to the two sides to decide. 

 The trouble is that political rhetoric often mars the simple economic argument. That was pretty much the case with the debates over the state government?s new agriculture policy. Sceptics within the Left Front cried foul over the government?s attempts to liberalize agriculture. They feared that the new policy would turn the left?s land reforms on their head by alienating the farmers from their land. The other fear was that opening agriculture to private investment would threaten the state?s food security and leave the farmers at the mercy of the private investors. However, the situation on the ground is very different from what the political rhetoric suggests. The fact is that large sections of poor farmers now find agriculture uneconomical because of increasing costs and low prices for their produce. Several studies show how unprofitable farming has pushed an increasing number of marginal farmers to the category of farm labourers. The result is a steady decline in agricultural production and productivity. The new farm policy was right in identifying the problem and also in emphasizing the need for private investments. The government needs to prove that it has the political will to implement the policy.

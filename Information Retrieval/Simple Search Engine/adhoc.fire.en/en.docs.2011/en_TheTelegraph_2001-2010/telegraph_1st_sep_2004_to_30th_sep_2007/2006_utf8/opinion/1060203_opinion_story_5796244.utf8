 END OF AN ERA

 The Greenspan era came to an end last Tuesday with the man, whom many revere as the maestro of monetary policy, laying down office. In his eighteen years at the helm of the Federal Reserve Board, Mr Alan Greenspan presided over a period of strong growth and low inflation in the United States of America. His tenure included milestones such as tackling the 1987 stock-market crash, handling the fallout of the Asian crisis, rescuing long-term capital management, managing the technology stock bubble of the late Nineties and the swift recovery from the crash that followed. But for the world at large, Mr Greenspan?s importance lies in the fact that he led the US central bank during a time when globalization became a fact of life. During his tenure, the US economy continued to play its role as the engine of the world economy, while US funds discovered emerging markets. 

 Of course, his policies have also been the target of much controversy. Critics point out that his cheap money policy not only fuelled the bubble in technology stocks but that his reluctance to raise interest rates in time is also responsible for the current housing bubble in the US and, indeed, for the rapid rise in asset prices across the world. Mr Greenspan?s predecessor, Mr Paul Volcker, has, in fact, criticized Mr Greenspan?s policies sharply, maintaining that the huge rise in the debt burden on American consumers and the housing bubble pose grave risks to financial stability. In several respects, however, Mr Greenspan has been rather lucky. Mr Volcker had already slain the inflation demon when he took over, and globalization ? with its unlimited supplies of Asian, especially Chinese goods ? ensured that prices remained firmly under control. The lowering of inflation expectations allowed the central bank to increase money supply without raising the spectre of inflation, permitting a sharp burst of debt-fuelled growth.

 It will be left to Mr Greenspan?s successor, Mr Ben Bernanke, to tackle the imbalances that have been created in the US and world economy. The growth of US gross domestic product decelerated sharply in the December quarter, and the housing bubble has started deflating. Job growth has been anaemic and US median real wages are below that of a generation ago. Whether the US consumer?s prodigious appetite for spending will continue in these circumstances is a moot question. And if US consumption slows, so will Asian production. America?s huge current account deficit, and its financing, also need attention. Asset prices, whether gold, commodities or emerging market stocks and bonds, are red-hot. And finally, there is the constant worry about high crude oil prices. In short, Mr Bernanke will have to steer very skilfully to ensure a soft landing not only for the US, but for the global economy as well.

 Letters to Editor

 Does the crown fit?

 Sir ? Will the Congress leaders never change? Instead of focussing on important issues facing the country in its plenary session, the party seems to be too busy with dynasty politics (?Cong makes get-Rahul resolution?, Jan 23). Further, Pranab Mukherjee?s act of comparing Rahul Gandhi to Nelson Mandela is sycophancy at its most ridiculous. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nivedita Roychowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? In no other country would such a slogan as ?Rahul lao, desh bachao?, given the same context, be entertained. The saying goes: the one-eyed man is king among the blind. And so it is in India, where there is a serious dearth of capable young leaders. We live in a fool?s paradise, and still prefer to think that an individual born in a particular family can deliver the country from all its woes. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Nehru-Gandhi family is both the strength and weakness of the 130-year-old Congress: strength because thousands of Congressmen are still at this family?s beck and call; and weakness because blind allegiance to the family has reduced the Congress from a democratic party to a dynastic and dictatorial one. In the Hyderabad plenary, for instance, Congressmen, including senior leaders, were found shouting slogans about Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, rather than about the party. The way the party members fawned over the president?s son, and begged him to be their leader, was for everyone to see (?Rahul to work for post, not ?inherit??, Jan 24). All this obviously becomes fodder for the opposition. A party in its right mind would try not to hand such lollies to its opponents on a platter.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Rahul Gandhi is definitely at an advantage because of his last name. It gives him the unquestioning support of the Congress cadre. Congress leaders probably see him as the future prime minister and want to be in his good books rightaway. But the young Gandhi seems to be aware that many are likely to see him as inexperienced and raw. Hence, like a mature leader, he has announced, ?We must move away from the corridors of power and build direct links with people. A leader is made by listening, learning and working,? true leadership is built brick by brick, on hard work. There is no fast track.? By declining the party post, Rahul Gandhi has won the hearts of thousands of people.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? If ever there was any doubt, there should be none any more about the fact that in this country it is the dynasty that rules. Even to this day, the dynasty, in the form of Sonia Gandhi, regulates the prime minister?s functions with a remote control. And I would not be surprised if she has already decided that Rahul Gandhi should be the next prime minister. However, the one thing that can be said in his favour is that he is young and educated and, hopefully, dynamic too. He has already declared a good amount of his assets ? a rare thing where politicians are concerned. There are speculations in the media about his reported courtship of a foreigner. But the choice of politics as a career should not impose impediments in his personal life. After all, his father too had married a foreigner, and she has come a long way to lead a party no less than the Congress. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? We could do without the hype surrounding Rahul Gandhi as the next Congress icon. It seems that he is popular more for his illustrious lineage than for his political acumen. This brings nothing but shame to the Indian democracy. If he is idolized before he has got a chance to prove himself, he can never earn the respect of the masses as a politician.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Pipe dreams

 Sir ? ?Lessons in the pipeline? (Jan 19) should be an eyeopener for the Indian government, especially after the Russian action of stopping the supply of gas to Ukraine and demanding a huge increase in price ? which is tantamount to blackmail. India should abandon the Iran-Pakistan-India proposed project. First, the gas supply will be under Iran?s control. Second, it will also be dependent on Pakistan?s whims, given the political conditions. Third, it could be vulnerable to terrorists? threats to blow up the pipeline. Fourth, Iran could be the site of the next world war. Fifth, Iran could do a Russia by hiking the price of gas exorbitantly. Sixth, industries set up banking on this gas could face closure with the slightest change in any of these factors.

 Clearly, it would be unwise to go ahead with this project, however expedient it may be politically. One option could be to offer to buy gas if delivered at a suitable Indian border at a predetermined price (with a provision for periodical increase of, say, 10 per cent every three years or so). Any other option will be disastrous for the country. If we are importing material, that can be transported by other means such as by ship, or by air, till we have alternative supply sources lined up. One hopes that sense will finally prevail on the government, which has a disturbing tendency to think only post-facto. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ramakrishnan, Calcutta

 Sir ? Chandrashekhar Dasgupta?s analysis of the Russia-Ukraine gas supply imbroglio and the note of caution implicit in it should be made to bear on the proposed projects involving Myanmar-Bangladesh-India and Iran-Pakistan-India. In fact, since India is at the terminal point in both, its bargaining capacity will be the lowest in case of disputes. The risk quotients are high in both projects since they involve countries which harbour terrorists targeting India. The economic and political factors should be weighed first.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 BEYOND THE LINE OF FIRE

 By telling lies about Kargil, Pervez Musharraf has sowed the seeds of distrust in the minds of his own people, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Feeding half-truths

 A few weeks ago, President Pervez Musharraf was being seen as having pulled off another coup under the nose of the toughest Indian hawks when he got Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to agree to a mechanism on counter-terrorism. As New Delhi struggled to explain how and why the Agra summit of five years ago had culminated in the successful agreement in Havana, lo and behold, the general had committed a self-goal. In the course of the scores of talk shows, interviews and press conferences that he subsequently gave to the Western media in America, the Cuba declaration lost potency by the minute.

 Instead, Musharrafs book, In the Line of Fire, and additionally, his visibly recalcitrant mood at the meeting with George W. Bush and Hamid Karzai, shifted international focus once again to the competitive politics of the war against terror on both sides of the Durand Line. Once again, American TV networks are beginning to cry themselves hoarse about which leader is paying lip service and who is fighting the war body, mind and soul.

 In India, though, the Musharraf book is being perceived as a pack of lies. General Ved Malik, the Indian army chief during the Kargil war, has said as much. Other armymen and politicians have wondered why Musharraf has felt the need to concoct so many semi-truths about Kargil. Especially, when one thought that Musharraf was smart enough to either side-step the matter, or, if he truly wished to come to grips with the India-Pakistan problem, to come clear and tell the truth about Kargil.

 The book, instead, has once again tried to draw wool over the eyes of Musharrafs Pakistani readership. The general has tried to come across as a blue-blooded hero, one who either conceived or approved of the Kargil stratagem that would put pressure on India to seriously talk Kashmir. The failure is all Nawaz Sharifs, of course. First, Sharif was told about the invasion plans and he never did a thing, and secondly, he sold the country for thirty pieces of silver on July 4, to the Americans.

 The truth is, Pakistan lost the Kargil war not only because its invasion of Indian territory was a blatant act of treachery considering that both sides were aglow in the aftermath of the bus ride from Amritsar to Lahore or because the Indian army was that much better, or because the United States of America intervened and roundly told off the Pakistanis to get back. Pakistan lost the Kargil conflict for all the above reasons in July 1999. However, the fact remains that Pakistan and General Musharraf has played a big role in this has refused to come to terms with the defeat at Kargil. And so the Pakistani army will continue to lie and cheat and dissemble, only so that it can continue to tell its own people the semi-untruth.

 That, then, is the real value of In the Line of Fire. A large part of the book is inspired prose, but there are large parts too that are economical with the truth. The Kargil war who lost, who won, how only 5,000 Pakistani soldiers took part in the war, since most of those who fought were Kashmiris waging an armed struggle against the Indian state is one episode. Another is about Indias copying the Pakistani nuclear programme. Yet another part is about a comment that Richard Armitage, the then US deputy secretary of state denies ever having made, about bombing Pakistan back into the Stone Age if it refused to help in the war against terror.

 The Stone Age comment can be contested one way or another. As for the Indian nuclear programme, maybe Musharraf was just being loyal to A.Q. Khan. But denying Kargil? Denying the deaths of Pakistani soldiers at Kargil? Musharraf may be sowing the seeds of permanent distrust of the Pakistani army in the minds of the Pakistani people. Remember, Musharraf has refused to take off his uniform even in the 2007 elections. In time, the peoples distrust of its own army may become so strong that they may demand systemic reform, or that the army has to be subject to the political class.

 The tragedy is that Musharraf need not have lied about Kargil. Too much is in the public domain, too many people know what really happened. Television ensured that it became Indias first living-room war. Not telling the whole truth to his own people either betrays a fear of the system or a fear that he may be asked to be counted by his people and that he may fall short.

 Like it or not, Musharraf is a real hero for most of Pakistan. This is not only because he commands real power, but also because he is seen as having tried to reform his country, to cleanse it of the overweening influence of the mullahs, to roll back the creeping religious hold on everyday life.

 However, India need not be frothing at the mouth over Musharrafs Kargil lies. The Pakistani generals inability to deal with the full truth at Kargil can be a source of strength for India. New Delhi can rest assured that if a leader cannot tell his own country the truth about a major event in the nations life, then he has lost touch with his people.

 For the first time in years, Musharraf seems human. Even when the summit with Atal Bihari Vajpayee fell apart at Agra in July 2001, the visiting Pakistanis seemed to have been somewhat wronged by a concatenation of circumstances that included out-of-turn speeches by spokespersons of the Bharatiya Janata Party. New Delhi was on the backfoot in Agra as India refused to have a dialogue with the offending party about its offences.

 In Cuba, too, Manmohan Singh seemed to have been under some political flak for the counter-terrorism mechanism, especially since the prime minister was hard put to respond to the generals insistence that the mechanism be led by the intelligence chiefs of both sides. Musharraf even offered that the director-general, Inter-Services Intelligence, lead the Pakistani side. But the prime minister demurred, saying things needed to be discussed first.

 All of the above was forgotten as soon as Musharraf left Cuba and flew to the US to launch his book. Lights, camera, action! The sequence of events was worth any Clint Eastwood movie. In fact, it seems that Eastwood, long ago, had actually made one with a similar name.

 LAND FOR USE

 Small-time politicians are usually incapable of seeing the big picture. It must be a source of discomfort for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), has too many of them. Such comrades cannot quite make sense of his policy to usher in a new era of industrialization in Bengal. These men cannot, therefore, come to terms with the simple truth that better standards of living, jobs and an overall economic growth do not come from agriculture alone. Worse still, they pretend to accept the economic argument about industrialization, but use populist politics to work against it. This seems to be the crux of the debate over the government?s attempts to acquire land on which new industries are to be set up. The trouble with the debates in communist parties is that they seldom end or result in a clarity of vision. But there is a worse fallout of such confusions. The investors who are now attracted to Bengal by Mr Bhattacharjee?s liberal policies, may read ominous signals in old-style leftist rhetoric. They may have no time to waste waiting for the comrades to conclude their debates over the acquisition of land. 

 Ironically, the CPI(M) leadership has been keen to give the impression that it has successfully concluded the debate. Mr Bhattacharjee led the left front to its seventh successive electoral victory in May mainly on the campaign for industrialization. The party would be dishonouring the mandate if it now raised hurdles on his way. The land reforms minister, Mr Abdur Rezzak Mollah, is clearly raising a bogey when he talks of a ?food crisis? in the future if farming land is increasingly used for new industries. Such irresponsible remarks by a veteran party leader cannot inspire the investors? confidence in the government?s policy. Also, the argument that agriculture offers the best use of land is a seriously flawed one. A modern, industrial economy can raise the people?s purchasing power in ways that an agrarian economy cannot. Mr Mollah should know how large numbers of farmers in Bengal sold off their plots and switched to other jobs in recent years because they found agriculture economically unviable. If anything, the need of the hour in Bengal is to free farmers from land and unproductive farming. True, such major changes would involve some political risks. But not espousing the changes could be even more risky for Bengal?s economy.

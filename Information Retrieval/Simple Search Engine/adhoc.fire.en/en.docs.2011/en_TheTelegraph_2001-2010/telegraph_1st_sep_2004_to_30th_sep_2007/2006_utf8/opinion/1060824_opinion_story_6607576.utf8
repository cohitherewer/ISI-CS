The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Taste of faith

 Sir The reports, Faith proves sweeter than filth and Miracle, to drink and take home(Aug 20), are pointers to the bitter truth that all the talk about social awakening through mass education remains more a hype than a reality in India. The chart on the front-page of The Telegraph, showing the chloride and solid content of seawater, litres of which were consumed by the people of Mumbai, is intimidating. Anyone, no matter how religious he is, should think twice before drinking such water. But the urban, (mostly) educated Mumbaikars obviously gave no thought to the hazards they were exposing themselves to. This shows that peoples belief in religion is more unyielding than in science or in the government that has been trying to dissuade them from drinking seawater. The madness witnessed at the Mahim Creek is enough to leave the Union education ministry in despair over the futility of all its policies aimed at spreading education and awareness. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Das,

 Calcutta

 Sir Hard facts about the level of toxins in water can have little effect on people determined to experience a miracle. No one could stop people from believing that idols of Ganesh were drinking milk in 1995. And so nobody could convince the Mumbaikars that drinking the polluted water of the Arabian Sea can pose a threat to their health. It is quite incredible that people could bring themselves to drink the murky water contaminated with human, animal and industrial waste in the belief that it had acquired curative powers. Even those aware of the pollution level of the water willingly suspended their disbelief to be part of the miracle. Indians prefer to live in the world of make-belief than face facts. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, 

 Faridabad

 Sir The fatalistic mindset of Indians is evinced by the Mumbaikars declaration that even if they fall sick after drinking the water they will accept it as the verdict of god. It is ridiculous that people still harbour such beliefs in the 21st century.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Nirupam Banerjee, 

 Calcutta

 Sir Nothing short of a miracle can turn the normally saline seawater sweet all of a sudden. If the statistics about pollutants in the water are to be believed, then those who drank the water should have fallen sick immediately. But nobody complained of any ailment even after having bottles of the sacred water. Miracles do happen, as was proved a few years ago during the episode involving milk-drinking Ganesh idols. And now the 14th-century saint, Baba Maqdoom Saheb, has provided the residents of Mumbai with the opportunity to experience yet another extraordinary phenomenon. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Calcutta

 Sir Whether the seawater really turned sweet or not, the unusual happening at Mahim Creek in central Mumbai was a miracle nonetheless. In a Mumbai ravaged by blasts, with accusing fingers being pointed at Muslim militants, the incident succeeded in uniting believers of all faiths. Sheikh Naseer and Sita Devi alike believe themselves touched by the divine in having drunk the water.

 Yours faithfully, 

 D. Basu, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The Maharashtra government should institute an inquiry into the sudden sweetening of the seawater at Mahim Creek. The drinking spree could have led to an epidemic of water-borne diseases. The government should try to prevent any such outbreak by prohibiting people from approaching the seashore. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Madhu Agrawal, 

 Dariba, Delhi

 Sir As pointed out in the editorial, Water crisis (Aug 21), it is ironic that when people across the country are raising Cain over the alleged presence of pesticides in soft drinks, they have no problems in drinking contaminated water thinking it is divine.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Soma Dutta, 

 Siliguri

 Sir When hundreds drink polluted seawater or believe that idols of Ganesh actually drink milk, the so-called educated sections scoff at their blind devotion. Yet, many of these enlightened men would readily take for granted the purity of Gangajal and charanamrito.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Anagh Pal, 

 Calcutta

 Lesser evil

 Sir Sanjib Baruah, in Torchlight on a blindfolded face (Aug 10), does a surgical analysis of the secret killings of United Liberation Front of Asom militants during the counter-insurgency drive in Assam. Unless justice is done to those killed or missing, the peace talks with the Ulfa will remain ineffectual. Strangely, whenever the chance of a settlement arises in the Centre-Ulfa talks, the defence establishment makes unnecessary interventions in the name of counter-insurgency operations and upsets the process. In the end, the people suffer and peace prospects become bleaker.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Amit V. Sengupta, 

 Calcutta

 Sir It seems that Sanjib Baruah is all sympathy for the Ulfa militants who were killed in Assam. But he fails to take into account the cases of hundreds of civilians who have died in the hands of these militants. Peaceful ways do not work with militant insurgencies. They need to be suppressed with an iron hand. The secret elimination of militants between 1998 and 2001 were cruel, but it was necessary to stop the violence that had been ravaging Assam. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Datta, 

 Calcutta

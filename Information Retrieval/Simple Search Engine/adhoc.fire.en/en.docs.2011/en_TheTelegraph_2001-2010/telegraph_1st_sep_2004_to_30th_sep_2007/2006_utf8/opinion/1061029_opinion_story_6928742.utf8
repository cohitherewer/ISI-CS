The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Pranabda is breathing easy, and not merely because he no longer has to put on the snowgear that had to be donned so frequently on visits to military posts in the mountains. The journey from defence to the MEA has been pretty smooth (so far so good that is), despite apprehensions that it could be touted as a demotion of sorts. And the relief is palpable. On the day of the hearing-in, Pranab Mukherji was found in his new chamber in South Block praising the media. Several reports, especially ones that had appreciated the posting as the right choice for a challenging assignment, were quoted out aloud. The visibly-pleased minister then called for tea for the scribes. He rang the bell in order to ask someone to fetch the beverage. Seconds turned to minutes, but there was no sign of the peon. Smiling still, the minister tried again and again. The reality then dawned on him. It has been nine months since the last occupant sat on the chair. During this intervening period, someone enterprising had nicked the battery of the bell. Pranabda had to go up to his private assistants office to place the order. Meanwhile, his smile had vanished. A sign of things to come?

 The cabinet reshuffle could not be missed as an occasion for the Priya Ranjan Das Munshi-Ambika Soni battle of wits to be played out to the hilt. Munshi, seemingly, was gloating over the likelihood of his arch-rival, Soni, being blessed with a deputy in the Kannada actor, Ambareesh. But the tables were soon turned. It was Munshi who, in the end, found himself saddled with Ambareesh. The actor, on his part, was so confident of getting the tourism ministry that soon after the swearing-in, he was found giving soundbytes on tourism. When he heard he would be in I amp;B, the script changed rapidly. It was also delivered in style. Ambareesh, after all, is a man with indisputable acting credentials.

 Daggers drawn again. Former PM VP Singhs Jan Morcha, one hears, is keen to contest the assembly polls in UP. More than Singh, his son, Ajeya, is supposed to be more interested in the fight. So is actor-turned-politician Raj Babbar. The objective is not so much to win, but to inflict as much damage possible to Mulayam Singh. Both Babbar and Ajeya Singh have been singled out for special treatment by the state government. A land allotment to the former and the construction activities of the latter have come under a scanner. The reason for all the sound and fury?

 Never say die. The BJP president, Rajnath Singh, is still trying to make himself acceptable as a national leader. Some say his idea to celebrate Diwali in the capital instead of hometown, Lucknow, is part of this objective. His spin-doctors are supposed to have advised him to spend more time at the capital. In keeping with this image change, has also acquired new habits. He works on Sundays. Apart from proving that he is a hard worker, it assures him a lot of news space. Most other politicos take a holiday on Sunday, allowing Rajnath a free run.

 The Ficci was a moribund body till a few years ago. Not anymore. The induction of Amit Mitra as secretary-general has helped revive its fortunes. But even Mitra was not prepared for the hungama at a recently-held interaction between farmers and government officials organized by the Ficci. Trouble erupted when a senior government official, as usual, began his address in English. A farmer from Haryana soon brusquely protested against the use of the phoren language. When the poor fellow tried Hindi, another voice from the audience arose. It belonged to a farmer from Kerala who said that he and his folks did not follow Hindi. It required all the persuasive skills of the organizers to prevent a free-for-all between the guests.

 The Ayodhya cauldron has started simmering again. The allegedly pro-Congress sankaracharya of Dwarka has taken the lead, advising the top RSS leadership and the UPA to go for an out-of-court settlement. A Union minister of state and devotee is supposed to be playing a key role. The solution entails construction of the Ram temple, and allowing a mosque to be build in the vicinity. One doesnt know if 10 Janpath has fallen for it, but the Vishwa Hindu Parishad is up in arms already. It has asked the sarsanghchalak not to indulge dubious saints. Minority leaders seem to be equally suspicious of the plan. Back to square one then?

 By any comparison, the number of iftaar bashes was far less numerous than any other year. Even during the BJP government, there were many more ministers holding five-star feasts for at least a hundred-odd members of the minority community. They are the invariable invitees, called to the VIP parties every year, along with a few others from the bureaucracy, media and so on. The iftaar party of the PM this year stood out, however. It was perhaps the only one where the host was paid the least attention. While the good doctor sat in a corner with another former PM, IK Gujral, everyone crowded around the star attraction, Sonia Gandhi. As she flitted from one table to another, from one cluster to another, a goodly crowd followed her. She was the prima donna of the party, and the guests vied for her attention. It was the CPI leader, D Raja, who took pity and went up to the two men in the corner to engage them in polite conversation.

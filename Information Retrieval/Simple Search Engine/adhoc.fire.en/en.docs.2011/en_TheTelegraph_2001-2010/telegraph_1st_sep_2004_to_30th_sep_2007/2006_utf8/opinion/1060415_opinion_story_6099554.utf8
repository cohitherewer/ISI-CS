 IDENTITY OF VIOLENCE

 The past is a foreign country, they do things differently there. Many north Indians feel that the statement would lose none of its significance, if the word ?past? were to be substituted by ?south?. Such prejudices have perhaps been fortified by what has happened in Bangalore in the aftermath of the death of the famous film star, Rajkumar. He suffered a natural death at the age of 77. But the announcement of his death was followed by a frenzy of mob violence in Bangalore. Television cameras caught young men mindlessly destroying public property and attacking policemen. There was bloodshed and loss of life as the inexplicable violence continued for nearly two days. The word ?inexplicable? is used advisedly since the occasion was that of mourning. Sorrow-driven violence is not a common cultural phenomenon. Rajkumar had died of natural causes at a ripe old age. Yet there was a bizarre exhibition of popular anger. What were the people angry with? With death, the one thing that is certain in life? Did they expect that the matinee idol would never die? What triggered off the violence? These questions will continue to haunt sociologists and cultural anthropologists who study popular behaviour.

 Popular violence led by mobs has always posed a conundrum for social scientists. The French historian, George Lefebvre, looked at the behaviour of the Parisian crowd during the French Revolution and located the cause of their violence in the fear of a great aristocratic plot to take over the country. The violence of the crowd, Lefebvre concluded, was the expression of a popular anger against currents of rumour which predicted a return of the ancien regime. The English historian, E.P. Thompson, studied the bread riots in England in the late 18th century, and suggested that the common people turned to looting and destruction when the price of bread rose above a certain level, which was determined not by the laws of political economy or the market but by a prevailing moral ethic that Thompson called moral economy. But these explanations of popular violence have been contested, and other historians have offered different explanatory frameworks for the same events.

 The recent violence in Bangalore poses a different kind of problem by way of its uniqueness. It is different even from the violence that followed the death of the Tamil icon, MGR. On that occasion, people killed themselves, rather than inflicting violence on others and on public property. Bangalore is a city struggling to establish its own identity to which there are many claimants ? from the votaries of globalization to those who clamour to establish a more provincial identity. For the latter, the death of an icon is a loss, a depletion of identity. The depletion has to be compensated by an assertion. The violence is perhaps located in the cusp between loss and retrieval.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 REAL THREAT

 A functional relationship between the government and the opposition is a crucial sign of a mature democracy. In Bangladesh, the two sides seem to be perennially on a collision course. That has been so irrespective of which party is in the government and which in the opposition. The latest unrest in the country, sparked by the opposition?s strike call, has, therefore, a familiar ring about it. That is not to say, however, that the demands by the Awami League-led opposition alliance have no justification. On the contrary, its demands for electoral reforms and replacement of the present election officials are absolutely crucial for fair elections to the country?s parliament early next year. If the run-up to the elections is marred by more political violence and an administrative collapse, the responsibility will lie entirely with the government of Ms Khaleda Zia. A fair poll may be extremely unlikely in an atmosphere charged with violence and mistrust. It is possible that the opposition alliance will organize more agitations over the next few months in order to keep the heat on the government. Ms Zia could take the wind out of the opposition?s sail if she initiated steps to clean up the electoral process. Such moves could assure not only the opposition but also the international agencies that regularly monitor the elections in Bangladesh. 

 International opinion is important for Dhaka for two basic reasons. First, the country?s practice of democracy is linked to decisions taken by the donor countries about aid to Bangladesh. Ms Zia?s regime has had a bad reputation for abuses of human rights. Several international rights groups have identified Bangladesh as one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. Second, Ms Zia?s rule has seen militant Islamist groups striking deep roots in the country. Worse, some partners of the ruling coalition were suspected of conniving at the activities of some of these outfits. True, the government launched a belated counter-offensive against them, thanks largely to international pressures. Ms Zia, therefore, has to prove her democratic credentials both at home and to international observers. Also, an endless confrontation with the opposition parties can land the economy in a worse mess. The worst danger, however, is to the country?s fledgling democracy. It is a very real threat for a country that has suffered long under several army rules.

 FREE THE VOTE

 Boycotting polls is not always the best means of protesting against electoral frauds. For such a step does not serve the ultimate purpose of cleaning up the electoral system. Worse, it helps the manipulators of the system to steal the popular vote. The decision of the 14-party alliance, led by Sheikh Hasina Wajed, to take part in next months general elections in Bangladesh is, therefore, a welcome move. It does not mean that the alliance has no more fears about the possibility of the polls being manipulated. Actually, not only the alliance but also international rights groups have serious doubts about the electoral process. One such group has confirmed the alliances complaint that there are close to ten million bogus names on the electoral rolls. Serious doubts also persist about the neutrality of a large section of the administration alleged to be partisan to the alliance led by Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. If the front led by Ms Wajed of the Awami League has still decided to fight the polls, it must be in the hope that popular will can foil subversive attempts. What is more, the future of democracy in Bangladesh is too crucial a matter to be left to vested interests. The battle for democracy is far more important than the victory or defeat of any particular party or group. 

 The elections in Bangladesh are significant for yet another reason. Five years of Ms Zias rule saw democratic values in politics and society come under attack, mostly from the ruling group. Attacks on the civil society, the media and particularly the minority community created a fear psychosis among the people. Even more disturbing was the rise of terrorism and religious fundamentalism. So much so that a section of the international community blacklisted Bangladesh as a failed state. For India, the new wave of terror across its eastern border became a major cause of security concern, because Bangladesh-based terrorists frequently struck at Indian targets. The elections are an opportunity for the common Bangladeshis to reject the purveyors of conspiratorial politics and to re-assert their faith in democracy. And they must guard against those who might try to rob them of their free vote. The international community has an obligation to ensure that the election commissions conduct of the polls is above suspicion. The world has a stake in seeing Bangladesh freed from the web of terror.

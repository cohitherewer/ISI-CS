The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 JUST A NUDGE

 Tragedy is created when two rights are thrown into conflict ? love against honour for example, or obedience to the king against duty to a brother. The proposal for introducing reservations in industry made by the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, at the annual conference of the Confederation of Indian Industry, however, may not have the aesthetically delineated tragic effect. But it certainly puts two positives in positions of potential conflict: merit and affirmative action. The prime minister is following up on the proposal in the common minimum programme of the United Progressive Alliance regarding quotas for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the private sector. Predictably, the response from industry leaders has been less than enthusiastic; the majority is willing to be perceived as doing their social duty through education and training of less privileged sections, while in recruitment they would like to stick to merit. And it would be unfortunate if the government decided to move from nudging their social conscience to actual legislation ? they would be likely to oppose it.

 There is logic and restraint in this response. It is not as if the private sector does not discharge its social duties ? paying taxes is certainly one of them. Labour reform through more flexible labour laws, which the prime minister is also promising, should broaden the labour market and automatically increase opportunities for the economically backward. Forcing a fixed number of recruitments on caste-based criteria on an establishment is likely to have the opposite effect of limiting jobs. Inequities cannot be corrected by a bouquet of jobs: that would merely increase divisions and confine benefits to certain layers of certain castes. The government needs only to look at the net gains of its policy of job reservations in the public sector and assess whether it has changed anything for the underprivileged or whether it has just helped different political parties get more votes. While it is true that merit cannot be judged fairly when the conditions for the development of merit are so painfully unequal, it is also true that the corrections have to be made at the base, by addressing poverty and social attitudes, the lack of opportunities for education and access. The government cannot pass on the burden of its failures to the private sector.

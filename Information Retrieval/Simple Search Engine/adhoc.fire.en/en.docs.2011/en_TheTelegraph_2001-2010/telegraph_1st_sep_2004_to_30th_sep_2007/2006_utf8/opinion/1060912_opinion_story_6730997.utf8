 NEW VISTAS IN INNOVATION

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 With respect to safety, work on technical improvements includes larger water inventories...lower power densities, larger negative reactivity coefficients, redundant and diverse safety systems with proven high reliability, and passive cooling and condensing systems.

 With respect to proliferation resistance, intrinsic measures incorporated into various advanced designs concern the chemical form of nuclear material, its mass and bulk, radiation field, heat generation and spontaneous neutron generation rate, the complexity of modifications necessary to use a civilian facility and material for weapons production, and design features that limit access to nuclear material.

 Important design efforts on large advanced light water reactors are underway in Argentina, China, the European Union, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation and US. Both Canada and India are working on advanced heavy water reactor designs, and advanced gas cooled reactor designs are being developed in China, France, Japan, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, South Africa and US....For liquid metal cooled fast reactors, development activities are underway in China, France, India, Japan, Republic of Korea and Russian Federation.

 Complementing the initiatives above are two major international efforts to promote innovation the Generation IV International Forum and the Agencys International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles. GIF has reviewed a wide range of innovative concepts and, in 2002, selected six types of reactor systems for future bilateral and multilateral cooperation: gas cooled fast reactors, lead alloy liquid metal cooled reactors, molten salt reactors, sodium liquid metal cooled reactors, supercritical water cooled reactors and very high temperature gas reactors. A Framework Agreement on International Collaboration in Research and Development on Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems was signed by Canada, France, Japan, UK and US in February 2005. The agreement clarifies explicit ground rules for joint research and other cooperative activities and provides the foundation on which specific GIF projects can now be negotiated.

 In 2004, INPRO published revised guidelines and a methodology for evaluating innovative nuclear energy systems. Current activities include completion of a user manual on the INPRO methodology... application of the methodology to assessing INSs in national and multinational studies, analyses of the role and structure of INSs to meet national, regional and global energy demands...and selection of the most suitable areas for collaborative development...

 In June, 2005, a joint declaration of all parties to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor negotiations was signed, and agreement reached on the construction site at Cadarache, France. This decision signalled an important new stage in the development of fusion energy....In December 2005 India became the seventh member of ITER.

 Harnessing nuclear fusion energy presents many challenges....With the approaching construction of ITER, many atomic, molecular and plasma-surface interaction issues have taken on increased importance ....An initiative will be launched in 2006 to study and quantify the erosion properties of fusion reactor containment wall materials that will have a direct influence on the understanding of tritium absorption by wall components.

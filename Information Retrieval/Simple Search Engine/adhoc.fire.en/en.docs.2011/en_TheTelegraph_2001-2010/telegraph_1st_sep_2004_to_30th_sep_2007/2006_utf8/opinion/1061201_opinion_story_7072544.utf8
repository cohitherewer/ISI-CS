 TALKING ON PAPER

 Creative urge

 Who do you write for? is the central question for all publishers of fiction and non-fiction. Writers write for their ideal readers, for their loved ones or their peers, for themselves, or for no one. Or they write for a livelihood, as journalists and textbook-writers do. All this is true. But still that fundamental question crops up every now and then and it has a fundamental answer.

 Dont ever try to visualize the great mass audience even publishers with years of marketing experience cannot figure out the critical mass of readership. They all say they do but finally go by their hunch. Actually, there is no such audience every reader is a different person with his/her own interests or intellectual capabilities.

 Again, dont try to guess what editors want to publish or what you think the country is in a mood to read: every editor brings his/her own interests to bear on the kind of lists they want to build on and your assessment of what a country wants is far too presumptuous (often patronizing) because moods can change overnight. 

 What all this boils down to is this: believe in your own identity and in our own experience. If good writing comes from a deep involvement with the subject, it has to be autobiographical but, as Evelyn Waugh said in Officers and Gentlemen, it is as experience totally transformed. To keep the reader from falling asleep or from being distracted, you must write for yourself and not be gnawed by the doubt of whether the reader has got it.

 There are two other ways of getting published. One is craft, and the other, attitude. 

 Craft is a question of mastering a precise skill. Books on creative writing have lessons on writing skills that can be learnt. Simplify, prune, strive for order, always keeping in mind two factors: no reader wants to read more than what is necessary and good editing means not what we need to put in but what we can no longer keep out. 

 Basically, craft is a mechanical ability that can be sharpened with constant practice. There is no getting away from repeated reading because when all is said and done, every writer has to learn the craft on his own. Authors often worry about whether the reader will like what they are saying or how they are saying it. But if you can write one true, honest sentence, which comes from a deeply felt experience, as Hemingway said, it is good writing whether or not it is good grammar.

 Writing, it is said, is like talking with someone on paper. It is more important to write as we speak rather than as the classic texts on good writing instruct us to do. So, if you want to get published today, it is necessary that you not only master the craft but write in the way we speak. Just choose a subject of contemporary interest, make it short and sweet, and it would be in print before you know it.

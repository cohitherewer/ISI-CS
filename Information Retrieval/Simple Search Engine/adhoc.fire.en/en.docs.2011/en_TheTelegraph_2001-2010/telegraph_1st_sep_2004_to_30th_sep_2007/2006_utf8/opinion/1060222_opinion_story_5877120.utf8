 The decision taken by France to supply nuclear power plants to India is significant and timely. The decision announced during the visit of the French president, Mr Jacques Chirac, comes days before the trip of the American president, Mr George W. Bush, to India. The move does finally signal India?s gradual accommodation within the international nuclear regime. Much will however depend on American endorsement of the deal and subsequent changes within the guidelines of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. France, however, has always taken the lead in reaching out to India. It may be recalled that France was one of the few Western countries that did not impose sanctions against India after New Delhi conducted nuclear tests in 1998. Instead, Paris had engaged New Delhi in a strategic dialogue. 

 France and India have also shared a commitment to work for a truly multipolar world order. During Mr Chirac?s present visit, India and France issued a declaration on ?development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes?. France has expressed its readiness, subject to non-proliferation norms, to provide nuclear power plants and supply nuclear fuel to India in the future. The declaration also visualizes the two countries engaging in the training of nuclear scientists and joint research activities. Both in terms of nuclear power reactors and the experience with fast breeder reactors, the French experience is most relevant to India. Indeed, it is believed that the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited and the French nuclear company, Areva, have already initiated a feasibility study to evaluate the setting up of six pressurized heavy water reactors of 1,000 MW in Maharashtra for power generation. But for cooperation to translate into reality, the nuclear deal between India and the United States of America also has to be concluded successfully. The French side has apparently made it clear to India that a full-fledged nuclear agreement would be signed only after India successfully negotiates the July 18 statement between the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and the US president, Mr Bush. 

 In addition to agreement on the nuclear issue, a total of nine agreements, including one on defence cooperation, were signed during the visit of the French president. The defence agreement established a ?framework? for cooperation between the two countries. The only jarring note of the visit was the controversy over the bid by Holland-based Mittal Steel to take over European steel-maker, Arcelor. This, however, is not an issue that would have a lasting impact on Indo-French relations, which are clearly on firm ground.

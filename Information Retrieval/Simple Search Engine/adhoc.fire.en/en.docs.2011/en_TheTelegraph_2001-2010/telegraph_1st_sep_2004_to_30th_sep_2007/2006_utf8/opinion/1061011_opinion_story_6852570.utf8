 HARD WORK

 How many working Indian children less than 14 years old know that yesterday was supposed to change their lives? How many of the adults who make these children work know that what they have hitherto done unthinkingly has become punishable now? And no less important, how many of these children have birth certificates to prove their age beyond doubt? Besides the staggering scale of the problem of child labour in India, these are some of the basic questions that the law and its implementers would have to confront before they can put into effect the well-intentioned amendments to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986. Eliminating, or significantly lessening, child labour will require hard thinking and even harder work. But nothing other than a singular failure of intelligence and enterprise can explain turning at once to Bollywood for the next best solution. Whether Gul Panag or Shabana Azmis expensive heart breaks at the sight of a little boy making tea on the Grand Trunk Road will be of little consequence to the tough-minded teashop-owner who has been making children sweat for years, profitably and without any qualms. The celebrity-appeal approach might occasionally brighten up a campaign or two, but Indias toughest problems of juvenile well-being and justice HIV, child labour and trafficking require a great deal more of the exercise of will than mindless stargazing. Indeed, to reduce the problem to such a solution implies a trivializing thoughtlessness at the heart of childrens charities that is quite as brutal as the problem itself.

 Identifying and sending back working children to their homes are only the beginning of the problem. Keeping them at home and in school until they complete at least their primary education is, in fact, the real challenge. Children work because their families need them to, or because they need to support themselves after their families, for a variety of reasons, have failed to do so. Hence, spectacular police raids on unscrupulous employers, followed by the apparent rehabilitation of droves of young labourers, seldom have the happily-ever-after results that the media and their consumers feelingly imagine. Thinking through problems of basic literacy, rural or suburban poverty and domestic violence is a more difficult affair than a charity sit-and-draw.

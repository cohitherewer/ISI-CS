The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LEGAL SUPPORT

 Old age gives rise to possibly the quietest and most invisible form of helplessness in modern urban society. The dissolution of the joint family system, an inadequately planned and managed welfare state and, more generally, the inevitable cruelties of a developing society create forms of geriatric vulnerability that can only partially be addressed by legal reform. Yet the bill passed by the Andhra Pradesh assembly that would make it simpler for parents to claim maintenance or shelter from their children (provided the latter are financially capable of doing so) is to be welcomed. Not only can they claim to be looked after, the elderly can also bring criminal charges much more easily against their negligent children. However, implementing this would require not only proper sensitization of the law and order machinery (police, as well as community organizations), but also informing the elderly themselves about such provisions.

 It is time that West Bengal sat up to this gap in its welfare system. Cases of geriatric suicide, of the elderly dying alone and unattended in their rooms or being victims of crime in their own homes, or of domestic violence from their children and grandchildren (or children-in-law) are noticeably on the rise in the state, especially in Calcutta and in the suburbs. The police have kept up a minimal and rather erratic system of phone-line help or vigilance on domestic workers, but none of this is worked out and sustained systematically. Nor is it possible for the police alone to keep an eye on situations that are too widespread and private to be monitored. Healthcare, banking and access to basic support services can be tailored to the special needs of the elderly through a combination of awareness, sensitivity and intelligent management motivated by a genuine sense of the value of the elderly in society. But sharpening and simplifying the law, and sensitizing its implementers, are a good idea, for a start.

 Letters to Editor

 Your choice

 Sir ? There should be serious discussion over the validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code following the Supreme Court?s recent advise to the Delhi high court to review it (?Ban on gays under review?, Feb 4). The medical fraternity deleted homosexuality from the international classification of diseases in the early Seventies and declared such sexual orientation as a normal variation with many evidences in the animal world. Unfortunately in India, we are yet to legalize gay-sex as it is considered ?against nature?. The PIL filed by the Naz Foundation was opposed by the Centre on the grounds that there was not enough public tolerance towards such behaviour. Hence homosexuality cannot be taken out of the statute book. In any secular democracy, social dynamics must be taken into consideration while criminalizing some behaviour and decriminalizing others. But given the dreadful spread of HIV/AIDS all over the world, the time has come to seriously ponder ways to modify our views towards homosexuality. The normal desire between two consenting men cannot be declared criminal. It only forces them to go into the closet. This not only deprives them of necessary information about safe sex but also becomes a hurdle for the anti-AIDS campaign. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shabab, Calcutta

 Sir ? Homosexuality or gay relationship has become a hot topic these days not only in foreign countries but also in India. It is argued that such a relationship cannot be accepted in our country as it is not a part of our culture. But what about rape and ill-treatment of women? Are they a part of our culture? Apart from rethinking homosexuality, the government should also seriously deliberate on the safety of women. Homosexuality is a natural thing and should not be treated as an unnatural offence.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? ?Your voice? (Feb 5) showed that 81.03 per cent readers think that the ban on homosexuality should be lifted. I am sure the respondents are mostly bisexuals who believe in the individual?s right to practise a sexuality of their choice. The reason for this support, presumably, is the belief that some people are oriented (or disoriented) to be sexually attracted to members of their own sex and enjoy having sex with them. This deviation, despite being against the law of nature, is respected on the grounds of defending the choice of individuals. One question. What is the percentage of homosexuals? Maybe 5 per cent to 10 per cent of the total population. But what about the poor majority (some 80 per cent) who love to watch pornography and derive sexual satisfaction out of it? Why has this silent majority of pornography-watchers not been allowed to assert their rights? Why are they prevented from getting sexual satisfaction? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s Republic Day speech to the nation has significant messages for both the populace and the politicians who rule over them. He asked all parties to be committed to development and to be patriotic and democratic. Politicians are supposed to act as watchdogs in a democratic set-up, and yet they are so immersed in politicking that development issues invariably take the backseat. In referring to this tendency, Kalam must have had in mind the mess in Bihar. 

 Given the state of things, the president?s position is the most vulnerable in the Indian political system. Technically, he is the constitutional head of the country but has to follow the advice of the cabinet. He can only ask the parliament to reconsider bills passed by it but has no right to overrule them. The president, in the case of Bihar, had to give the nod to the dissolution of the assembly and call for fresh elections. It is clear that Kalam finds himself compromised by the system. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? In his address to the nation, the president emphasized that politicians should be role models for the youth. He asked political parties to orient themselves towards development politics, and urged everyone to practise honesty, sincerity and tolerance. Since all these virtues are absent in our politicians, the net result is squabbling in the name of politics. The principles the president asks us to strive for can be within our grasp only if the number of political parties is reduced. If the aim and objectives of a set of parties are found to be similar, they should be asked to merge. More important, if these do not meet the requirements of the Constitution, they should be de-registered. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

 Sir ? I was saddened to see just a small paragraph on the president?s Republic Day speech printed in The Telegraph, and that too in the inside pages. Needless to say, Kalam is one of the finest presidents our nation has ever had. In his address to the nation, Kalam, apart from putting forth some national missions to be completed in the areas of science, technology and healthcare, also focussed on vital issues like corruption. He also spoke at length on the values of truth and honesty. The president is the first citizen of our country and keeping his stature in view, his address should have been printed on the first page.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

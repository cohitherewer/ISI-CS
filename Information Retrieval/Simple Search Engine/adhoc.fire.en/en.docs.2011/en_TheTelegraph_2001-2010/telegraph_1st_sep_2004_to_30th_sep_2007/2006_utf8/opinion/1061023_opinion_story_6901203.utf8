 In its Integrated Energy Policy document, the Planning Commission estimates that to sustain 8 per cent to 10 per cent economic growth rate over the next 25 years, India needs to increase its primary energy supply by three to four times, and electricity generation capacity by five to six times their 2003-04 levels. This will enable the eradication of poverty and meet human development goals. By 2030-31, power generation capacity must increase to nearly 800,000 MW from the present 160,000 MW inclusive of captive plant capacities. 

 Over 60 per cent of the electricity generated in India is from polluting sources (mainly coal). As climate change seizes the worlds attention, India will be compelled to conform to the Kyoto protocol. It then can no longer depend to such extent on coal for electricity generation. In any case, our reserves of coal are far less than earlier estimated. The pending nuclear agreement with the United States of America has energy security as the primary objective. It will enable a substantial increase in the generation of non-polluting nuclear power for some years. But it will not be enough, and we must, meanwhile, look for all other means to reduce coal dependence. 

 Indian politicians and consumers are hostile to big increases in electricity tariffs. Hence, gas will be a small source for electricity generation because of its rising costs that raise electricity tariffs. Maximum use of other renewable sources hydro, wind, biomass and solar must be stimulated. The Electricity Act 2003, requires state regulatory commissions to enable grid connection for renewable energy (there are no restrictions on its sale) and to specify a percentage of all electricity to be distributed by a licensee from renewable sources. 

 Government incentives for renewables have been through capital grants, capital and interest subsidies and fiscal incentives. These have enabled renewable capacities, albeit at low levels, and even lower utilization. The total installed generation capacity (excluding a little of captive generation from renewable sources), at the end of 2005 was 118,419 MW, of which hydro was 30,935 MW (26.12 per cent), electricity from wind and other renewable sources was 2,810 MW (3.22 per cent). India does not count hydropower as being from renewable sources because hydropower is under the ministry of power. Only electricity generated from sources under the ministry of non-conventional energy, namely, wind, small hydro, solar and biomass, is counted as electricity from renewable sources. This turf-led bifurcation must change and we must count all renewables together. That must include hydro. Governance of all these sources must be holistic. Different ministries for different sources of power (even nuclear is under a separate ministry) only prevent coordination. For example, rural electrification is planned to be primarily from grid power. Locally generated and distributed power, from biomass, wind and so on (not under the ministry of power), is reserved for remote locations. There are other turf battles between different ministries. They divert attention from the main objective of increasing available electricity from renewable sources. 

 Coal is the main source of our electricity the most polluting in electricity generation, and the chief culprit in carbon-dioxide emission, which is believed to cause more green house gases and climate change. The present international agreements on climate change give India and China some years to limit their burning of coal. This exemption will go soon, especially as our economies grow as they do. It is imperative that we increase electricity generation by alternatives to coal. This explains our fervour in pursuing a nuclear agreement with the US . It will allow us to import more uranium and produce more nuclear energy. However, even then, enough nuclear power to make a difference will take many years. Meanwhile, we must use all possible non-polluting sources. 

 According to recent estimates, we have at least 63,480 MW of unused hydroelectric potential at 60 per cent load factor. The government believes that the present potential for electricity from other renewable sources (wind, small hydro, biomass/cogeneration, solar, waste) is 81,340 MW while the achievement is only 5,950 MW, that is, less than 10 per cent of the potential. Clearly, we need to go all out to exploit all the potential sources of electricity. 

 Some countries use feed-in laws compelling utilities to purchase electricity from renewables, with an attractive guaranteed sale price, to promote electricity from renewable sources. In Europe , the price is a percentage of retail electricity prices. In California , the growth of electricity from renewables has been by attractive long-term contracts and guaranteed purchase at prices based on the cost of the next best alternative option for energy. 

 The approach in the US, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Italy requires that a certain percentage of the annual energy use must be from renewable sources. Suppliers or generators are required to procure a percentage of energy sold from renewable sources. To enable flexibility, individual renewable energy obligations can be traded. In India, this would, for example, enable electricity from renewables from Tamil Nadu to be traded as a renewable energy credit to, say, Delhi. The actual power might not move, but the overall renewable generation in the country will increase to that extent. The success of this approach demands that there are credit-worthy buyers and there is an established market for trading in electricity and in these renewable energy obligation certificates. Regulators must push for this to happen. 

 In India , the law requires the state electricity regulatory commissions to decide the percentage of electricity from renewable sources in their states. Instead, the government and political leadership must decide the quantum. This electricity is today more expensive than electricity from coal and hydro. Given the political opposition to tariff increases, it will be difficult to pass on to the consumer this higher cost of electricity from renewable sources. This is a political and policy decision for the government to take, not the regulator. 

 Present incentives on investment in renewables should be modified to relate them to actual generation. This will ensure that high-income individuals do not invest in renewables merely for tax advantage, while not producing electricity from renewables. Presently, some regulators allow an annual escalation in tariffs for renewables. This is unnecessary since such installations do not have the rising costs of other generating methods. 

 Availability of electricity from renewable sources like wind power, fluctuate depending on wind speed. When more power is so available, there can be prior contracts with such users who can increase or reduce their production and so increase or reduce their power requirements, matching the fluctuations in wind power. Such users could agree that they would lift the suddenly available excess power. 

 Renewable electricity has great potential for rural communities, and for use in energizing pump sets. Farmers are used to getting power at odd times and for short duration. Compared to that, wind power is much more reliable. This should be encouraged. Panchayat employees could be trained to run them and to bill and collect from users. 

 Electricity regulators must make it attractive to generate and sell renewable energy. The producers must be free to sell directly to any user. This requires that such producers have open access to transmission wires at no extra surcharge. Most importantly, the state regulators must have a fast track method to help generators of electricity from renewable sources. Many government purchasing entities today exploit these small generators by breaking contracts, offering lower prices than agreed, and refusing to lift contracted quantities. These small generators are reluctant to confront huge state-owned enterprises for fear of vengeful behaviour. It is essential that state regulators discipline the state enterprises, if electricity from renewables is to make headway. 

 In summary, renewables-based electricity must be supported. State governments and state regulatory commissions have so far played passive roles. They have allowed contract violations apart from putting bottlenecks in the way of the generators. We now need both of them to move with conviction, and support this non-polluting energy source. Vested interests of bureaucracies and state electricity boards, and their successors, must not be allowed to sabotage the growth of renewable energy.

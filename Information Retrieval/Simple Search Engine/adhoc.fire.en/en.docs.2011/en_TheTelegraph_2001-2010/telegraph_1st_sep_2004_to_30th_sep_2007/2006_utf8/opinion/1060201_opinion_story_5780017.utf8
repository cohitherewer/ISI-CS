 Powerspeak

 Sir ? All too often in the past, the left has been accused of anti-nationalism when it warned of the dangers of indiscriminately involving the United States of America in the affairs of India (?Vote against Iran, or else: warns US?, Jan 26). The left has been proved right by the overt attempt at manipulation by the US ambassador, David Mulford, who cannot now suddenly protest that he has been quoted out of context. Anti-left constituencies in the country should observe that the Bharatiya Janata Party has also condemned Mulford?s comments, while only the Congress has chosen to remain silent. India has to remember that any concession made to the US now will be used to force out more compromises from India. The country should abrogate the nuclear deal with the US before it drags us even further down.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? David Mulford has brought to light the pitiful terms of the bargain struck by the government with Washington under the banner of civilian nuclear cooperation. Who can, after Mulford?s outpourings, doubt that the ?deal? requires India to behave like a puppet, forced to go against its own national interests in order to please Washington? By insisting that India must vote against Iran at the February 2 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mulford has virtually foreclosed India?s options. The United Progressive Alliance government will now be under tremendous pressure ? if it votes against Iran, it will be seen as having capitulated to American arm-twisting; if it abstains or votes the other way, it will been seen as having made concessions to an increasingly clamorous left. The outrage against Mulford?s comments is understandable. No independent nation would want to be talked down by another, even if it happens to be the world?s sole superpower. The US ambassador and the administration he represents must learn to respect India?s sensitivities.

 Yours faithfully, 

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? In the typical way of George W. Bush, David Mulford has issued a ?either you are with us or against us? warning to India. Although the US state department dismissed it as Mulford?s personal views, the administration must be warned that inconsistent politics will only cause it to lose credibility. Mulford is the official representative of the US government in India and his comments are taken to reflect the official US stand on issues. Otherwise, why should the PTI be interested in interviewing him? The US government seems to have intentionally provoked India in order to know its position before the crucial IAEA meeting. However, after getting the answer, it promptly washed its hands off the matter so that the fa?ade of ?friendship? with India was left undisturbed. The US has been nakedly expansionist in its international politics. This is perhaps why many are not interested in going against Iran in the IAEA voting, as this will allow the US to have a free run in the region. India should be aware of the dangerous effects of siding with the US.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? David Mulford?s aggressive posture borders on blackmail. India should convey to the US that it has a mind of its own. Let us not grovel before the superpower for a few favours.

 Yours faithfully,

Ramani P. Easwaran, 

 Bangalore 

 Sir ? The Indo-US relationship is built on a strong foundation and it is unlikely that it will wilt just because a US official has decided to have his say in matters relating to Iran. Be that as it may, we still need to find out why the Indian authorities, in possession of adequate intelligence and diplomatic skills, should allow themselves to be led by the nose? India has enough potential to conduct itself with more self-respect.

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

 Child?s play

 Sir ? A generation back, babies were just born. Childless couples could satiate their longing for kids by caring for their relatives? children in a joint family system. Then the basic purpose of having kids, rather sons, was to ensure the well being of the parents in old age. Modern-day couples have lesser kids as it makes good economic sense. But ?Rent a womb? (Jan 22) shows that kids are now the ultimate fashion statement. What else can be said about spending a fortune to have a kid? In India, the more things change, the more they remain the same. Technological advancements are being used to perpetuate feudal beliefs. So, like ultrasonography, surrogacy is also used to perpetuate sexist beliefs, to counter the threat of the husband remarrying for a child, for example. Instead of empowering women, it has opened avenues for exploiting them. Soon, we may find the technology being used to ensure the conception of a male child only. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir ? As ?Rent a womb? indicated, laws need to be put in place to ensure that surrogacy does not turn into an exploitative practice in India. In a country where body organs and blood are sold at a premium, it is expected that the womb would fetch a decent price as well. Unfortunately, the women on hire will be paying their own price as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Jyoti Sikdar, Calcutta

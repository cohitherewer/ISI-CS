 TALKING AGAIN

 The resumption of the India-Pakistan composite dialogue, as a result of the meeting between Mr Pervez Musharraf and Mr Manmohan Singh, at Havana, has received international acclaim. It remains to be seen if the bilateral dialogue can now ensure a normalization of relations and a resolution of the many areas of difference. The real challenge, however, will be to overcome the great deficit of trust that exists between the establishments of the countries. The dialogue had been disrupted after the bomb blasts in Mumbai. In this context, the most important outcome of the talks has been the setting up of a joint mechanism to combat terrorism. This is the first time that New Delhi and Islamabad have agreed to set up a concrete institutional arrangement to address an issue that affects both the countries. The issue of terrorism had found place within the composite dialogue, but here the deliberations had reduced themselves to mostly an exchange of allegations and counter-allegations. The Havana proposal could see officers of intelligence agencies and security forces actually exchanging information and devising common strategies. The success of this institutional mechanism would be the best test of Mr Musharrafs assurances that Pakistan is genuinely attempting to stop cross-border terrorism. 

 Messrs Musharraf and Singh have also agreed to address the disputes over the Siachen glacier and the Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute with renewed vigour, as well as continuing the dialogue over Jammu and Kashmir and other outstanding issues. The best way to build confidence in bilateral relationships is by incremental steps that widen the constituency for peace and increase the number of those who have a stake in good India-Pakistan relations. It is essential to open up more trade and transit routes on the international border and the line of control, and further relax the visa regime in operation. The success of the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus is good evidence of this. No less important is for New Delhi to insulate the dialogue from incidents of violence and terrorism unless there is direct evidence to link it with the Musharraf regime. It will, of course, be critical for Messrs Musharraf and Singh, who obviously share a personal chemistry, to ensure that they meet more often than they have in the past.

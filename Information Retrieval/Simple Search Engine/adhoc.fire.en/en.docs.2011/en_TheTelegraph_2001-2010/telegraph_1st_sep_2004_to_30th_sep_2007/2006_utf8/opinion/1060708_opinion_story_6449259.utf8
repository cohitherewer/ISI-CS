 REQUIEM FOR A PM

 Absolute principles are a rarity in a vocation driven by the maximization of the possible. But one of the rare absolute principles is that a country cannot be governed on the basis of political blackmail. Even the leader of a coalition government, like the one Mr Manmohan Singh heads, must distinguish between acceptable pressure from allies and outright blackmail. It is unfor- tunate that the prime minister, Mr Singh, has failed to make this distinction and has succumbed tamely to the demands of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. Under threat from the latter, Mr Singh decided to put on hold all disinvestments in the Tamil Nadu-based Neyveli Lignite Corporation. The disinvestments programme is now all but dead and there is no hope of its revival. Mr Singh has thus bid adieu to his own past, or the most significant achievement of his political career. The author of economic reforms has been forced to strangle economic reforms. There is nothing more pathetic than this because Mr Singh had before him a very clear alternative: he should have said no to the attempt at blackmail and offered to quit as prime minister.

 Mr Singh?s stature as a man of principle would have gained if he had mustered up the courage to say no. He went into politics with one asset: his integrity. He has no political constituency save the intelligentsia, who see him as an erudite man fallen among politicians. But his inexplicable propensity to cling to power at any cost is eroding fast his sole asset and his only support base. If he is willing to sacrifice economic reforms at the altar of coalition politics, then the only conclusion one can draw, alas, is that principles count for nothing with him. Even a few months back, it would have been difficult to articulate this conclusion, but after his implicit support to Mr Arjun Singh on quotas, after his silence on the dismissal of Mr P. Venugopal from AIIMS and his surrender to the DMK over NLC, it is difficult to resist such a harsh conclusion. He has chosen to play power tennis and is failing rather miserably at it.

 Mr Singh prides himself on being a patriot. He should then be conscious of the responsibility he has taken on by becoming the prime minister of India. Holding the top job in the executive arm of the Indian state means that the holder places his country over everything else. As prime minister, he cannot see himself as a mere Congressman. He must do what he thinks is best for the country. Mr Singh announced a decision and then recanted because his decision brought upon him the wrath of an ally who threatened to quit the coalition. Mr Singh placed the survival of the United Progressive Alliance above his duty to the country and his own dignity. This may have caused Mr Singh profound personal anguish but that is nothing compared to the grievous harm he has done to the country and the office he holds. Let there be a prayer for the vertical man even if India knows only the horizontal one.

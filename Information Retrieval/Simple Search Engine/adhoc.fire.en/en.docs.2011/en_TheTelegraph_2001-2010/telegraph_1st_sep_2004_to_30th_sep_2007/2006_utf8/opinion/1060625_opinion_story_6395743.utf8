 CHARITY BEYOND HOME

 Charity hardly ever begins at home. Charity begins with the self. It is an extension of the ego: I give, therefore I am. An apparent act of altruism might have self-interest lurking within it. This is a cynical view of the world but not without substance. But all this should not take away from the grandness of the gesture made by Mr Bill Gates. He announced recently that in 2008 he would step down as chairman of Microsoft and would engage himself in philanthropy through the Bill amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. In India, Mr N.R. Narayana Murthy has expressed his desire to resign as executive chairman of Infosys Technologies. There are reasons to believe that relieved of his official responsibilities, Mr Narayana Murthy will occupy himself by doing social work, which is so dear to his heart. 

 Businessmen and fortune-makers have a propensity to devote part of their earnings to charitable work. Mammon has close links with charity. Cecil Rhodes, who made a huge fortune in Africa by means that would be decried in the age of political correctness, created a huge fund out of which has grown the Rhodes Scholarships awarded to bright young men and women to go and study in Oxford. Rhodes did this long before corporate responsibility acquired a certain respectability. It has been argued that after a lifetime of nefarious activity, Rhodes bought himself respectability. Similarly Andrew Mellon in the United States of America. He owed the US government huge sums of money in taxes. He struck a deal with F.D. Roosevelt. He built the National Gallery in Washington DC, donated his art collection to it and his tax dues were overlooked.

 Devoting money and energy to social work earns for a person enormous tax benefits in the US and other parts of the Western world. By creating this opportunity, the state allows the individual concerned to choose in which special area ? education, health, art and so on ? he would like to make an endowment. An act of charity thus becomes a part of an individual?s predilection and choice. Through an act of charity he can contribute to social welfare or creativity and thus contribute to the nation?s pool of wealth, welfare and talent. In turn, he also benefits through tax exemption. Altruism and self-interest become engaged in a symbiotic relationship. In India, the area of tax exemptions is restricted. Institutions have to apply to get exemptions for donors. This might be one reason why charity, outside the field of religion, has never gathered momentum in India.

 Another reason is the unprofessional manner in which most non-profit organizations are handled. Here, the entry of a person of the calibre of Mr Narayana Murthy might bring a dimension of professionalism and a high level of comptence. This might bring to an end the era of the champagne social worker in India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Whistling women 

 One corner of the Maidan in early autumn afternoon. Two 

 teams have just finished a five-a-side football match. As 

 two more teams wait to go on, the referees take a breather 

 on the sidelines. In what looks like a slightly public boys 

 locker room ---- the players, officials, and a handful of 

 supporters are all male journalists ---- the refs ought 

 to be sticking out like sore thumbs. But they dont. For 

 one, Minati Ray, Ranjana Chatterjee, Chaitali Chatterjee 

 and Shukla Nag wear the same outfit as their male counterparts 

 --- the familiar black-and-white shorts and T-shirt. For 

 another, three of them wear their hair short (Shukla Nag 

 sports a ponytail). But most important, they handle men 

 who play a rough game, constantly spewing expletives and 

 trying to influence the referees decision, with a kind 

 of authority that has to be seen to be believed and admired. 

 Minati Ray stands tall in her four and a half feet and puts the fear of god into the men who tower over her. Many of those who cower under her glare were born after Minati started playing for the national side. She refuses to accept that it is a big deal handling men on the field. From the moment we don the black-and-white and put the whistle to our lips, we cease to be men or women. We are referees and our job is to conduct a football match.

 But football remains a game where tempers fly as often as the ball, and referees sometimes find themselves at the receiving end. Dont the ladies feel scared? Ranjana Chatterjee is now amused. From her three years of experience, she has come up with a rather novel solution to violence in the mens game: Have all the mens matches officiated by women refs. Even the most short-tempered right-back will not hit a woman official, and there will certainly be less swearing all around. She claims that all the fifth division IFA league matches and office games managed by women are marked by their lack of incidents. (Mind you, most of those playing in the office league are former club footballers, who are trying to make up for their fading expertise by playing a physical game.) The IFA has refused to take much note of this so far.

 But then, there are so many things that go unnoticed. The clubs and the IFA chose not to notice when Ranjana came out tops in the AFC coaches programme, which trains men and women together. It is the men she outperformed who have gone on to bag lucrative club offers or are in charge of the national teams. The media hardly took notice when Chaitali became only the second FIFA woman referee from India, or Anamika Sen a FIFA assistant ref ---- although there was no dearth of coverage when K. Komaleeswaran played a bit part in the World Cup. 

 In a world where rewards are hard to come by, what is it that keeps the women going? Undoubtedly, their love for the game. Ranjana talks about the hours she spent travelling from her village in Howrah to Calcutta for practice, matches and national trials, when there werent even separate rooms for women to change. There still arent too many around the Maidan, so that girls sometimes have to walk across the Maidan to tents that can spare a changing room. It is an ongoing battle, nothing ever comes to us without asking, says Ranjana. 

 Have they been so busy waging this battle that they have had no time to contemplate marriage? Minati says, maybe, but points out immediately that there are many who have married and had children. This is a delicate subject, for Ranjana has had many people tell her that women who play football can never have children. Of course that is not true. You only have to look at Shanti Mullick, Dipti Mullick and the rest. Last week, we had organized a football tournament in the memory of Rama Das, a dear friend and one of the best goalkeepers of Asia, and several women had brought along their children to watch them play, says Ranjana, who feels proud that the tournament was organized by women, in the memory of a remarkable woman and were watched by several girls from schools in Calcutta and the villages.

 Such small joys and triumphs keep the women going. For Ranjana, the responsibility of building a football team in an elite girls school of the city is another small victory. (It is surprising how upwardly mobile parents will encourage their daughters to take up swimming and tennis, but never soccer, she laments.) But Minati has the last word on this. She forgets all that has eluded her grasp everytime someone calls her referee-da on the field.

 Postscript: The media football tournament is over, and it is time for the distribution of awards. Ranjana, Minati, Chaitali and Shukla have come out of their black gear and slipped into bright coloured T-shirts and trousers, with equally bright smiles on their faces. But the organizers nearly forget to mention them while presenting the mementos. But the refs are not perturbed by glitches of this kind. They have more important things on their mind. One of them is to make scribes play their next tournament with three men and two women in each team.

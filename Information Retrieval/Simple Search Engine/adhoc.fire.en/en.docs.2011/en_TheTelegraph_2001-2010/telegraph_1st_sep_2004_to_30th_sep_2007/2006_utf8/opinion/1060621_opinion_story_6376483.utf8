The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN A STATE OF NEGLECT

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 For those who have heard of but not seen the National library, the sheer grandeur and beauty of the building is bound to invoke a sense of awe. At one time, the library was stacked with the rarest and the best of publications and its staff were a courteous lot.The lighting, acoustics, seating and ventilation, along with the drinking water facility for readers had been done with great care and planning. One of the other attractions for the young minds visiting the premises was the opportunity to meet the brightest scholars, intellectuals and professors of the country.

 The best part of the library, however, was the playground. This was used for hosting inter-departmental football matches which saw readers cheering lustily for the players and comparing them with P.K. Banerjee, Chuni Goswami and Balaram. Such was the camaraderie, fraternity and spirit of goodwill then.

 In fact, everything else paled in comparison to the charms of one?s life inside the library. Be it the reading room, the canteen, football and cricket matches or Durga puja, the campus created by the British represented a miniature India which was in perfect harmony. The administrators of the library were efficient, the people manning their posts were modest, the readers disciplined and the campus a sight of serene beauty.

 Getting dark

 That was the situation then. A visit to the library today would show that there has been a qualitative decline because of an erosion in the environment that was once a book lover?s paradise. These days, the library is in the news for organizing conferences for the elite. The ordinary reader is left speechless at the sight of the parking space filled with expensive cars, and of microphones blaring through the shamianas. The administration is more interested in using the premises for such purposes than maintaining the sacrosanct character of the abode of learning. The library is also being used by the police for activities that are best suited for the Maidan. The crowning glory was the Election Commission pitching its tent during the state elections. Hundreds of policemen, poll officials and political agents assembled to ensure ?peaceful? polls, thereby violating the peaceful atmosphere of the institution.

 Each of these incidents prove that the people are hell-bent on disturbing the peace within the library premises. The readers too are no longer as serious as they used to be in the past. They no longer take pains to read, write, and study in the library. This has led to a qualitative decline in readership and hence, the readers are no longer bothered about maintaining peace and decorum inside the library.

 A classic example of the decline is the present reading room which, though air conditioned, gives one the feeling of a ghost house. Unlike the previous building (from where the reading room was shifted), one half of the hall is dark while the other half is poorly illuminated. There are also a battery of sleuths operating inside the reading room to ensure that readers don?t lose their valuables. They are in fact ?outsourced staff? who are more keen to find out what the readers are studying and shadowing them. 

 The reading room is supposed to close at 8 pm and on holidays at 6 pm. Yet securitymen posted at the library have been putting the lights off at 5.35 pm, thereby depriving scholars of precious time to study. The former prime minister of the country, Rajiv Gandhi, had once said that Calcutta is a dying city. Those who have been visiting the library premises over decades can now safely say that the National library is a dying institution. Unless the authorities pay attention to such a dire warning, this portent may soon turn into reality soon.

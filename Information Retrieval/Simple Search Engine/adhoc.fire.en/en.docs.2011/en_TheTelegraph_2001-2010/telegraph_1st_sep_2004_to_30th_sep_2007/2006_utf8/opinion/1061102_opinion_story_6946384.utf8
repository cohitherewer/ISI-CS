The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 POOR PLAYERS

 Success in sports, be it team games or individual, has come as rare bursts of fresh air to Indians. For one World Cup victory in cricket, there are innumerable humiliating defeats. In hockey, the early triumphs, when no other country played the game with any degree of skill, have dwindled with the change in rules. Indian football does not bear any resemblance to the game that is played at the international level. Individual sports narrate an even sadder story that is made more poignant by the recent victory of Jeev Milkha Singh in the Volvo Masters European golf championship. Before him very few Indian sportsmen have done themselves and their country proud: Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand won the All England badminton championship, which was equivalent of being the world champion. Milkha Singh Jeev Milkha Singhs illustrious father broke an Olympic record in the 1960 Rome Olympics in 400 metres, but failed to win a medal, as he came fourth in a photofinish. These and a few others in sports like chess, snooker and shooting are the few landmarks in individual sports for Indians. This lack of individual achievement inevitably raises the question: why?

 The obvious answer that suggests itself is that Indians do not possess the skills necessary to make a top-class sportsman. But this is an answer that is once removed. Why do Indians not have the necessary skills? The absence of sporting skills cannot be a function of racial characteristics. Other countries seem to have acquired the skills which they lacked once upon a time. The principal reason for this failure is the amateur mindset that dominates Indian sports, which is yet to emerge as a full-fledged specialized profession. The absence of professionalism means that sportsmen in India are badly paid and this leads to poor motivation and poor performance. Jeev Milkha Singhs achievement only underlines this point.

 VOTERS WIN

 Cynics who scoff at the power of the vote must be a self-deluding lot. The huge turnout of voters in the first phase of polling in Bengal reflects a unique re-affirmation of the people?s faith in democracy. Irrespective of who wins and who loses, the voters have earned themselves a rare victory. For these elections in the three districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore had an unprecedented backdrop of fear, uncertainty and misgivings. The fear of the Maoists hung over the polls like a storm cloud. The massive deployment of Central forces was obviously intended to instil a sense of security in the people?s minds. But this also raised some doubts about whether this show of state power would scare sections of the people away from the polling booths. Political parties did their bit to confound some of the confusions. By voting in such large numbers, the people have made their point clearly and forcefully. They have rejected the politics of violence, even if it is couched in ideological rhetoric. The Maoists may succeed in striking at isolated targets once the security cover on the areas is weakened. But their acts will now look more illegitimate than before. 

 The other big signal from the massive vote is a popular endorsement of the Election Commission?s measures. It is important to stress this because the EC?s role had come under attack from the ruling Left Front. The vote has proved that much of the noise the leftists made about the EC was a political ploy. The EC has a constitutional obligation to do all it can to try and make every poll free and fair. In the face of persistent complaints of ?vote-rigging? by the opposition parties in Bengal, it had little option but to take some extraordinary steps. The EC?s idea clearly was to create a level playing field. The vote has now shown that the left?s complaint about the EC?s allegedly partisan role was unfounded. The left, on the other hand, can now claim that the poll has busted some myths, mostly negative, about them. It has proved, for instance, that a high percentage of polling is not necessarily an indication of vote-stealing. The opposition in Bengal too should be careful hereafter about hoping to thrive on wild charges. Above all, the EC?s tough measures have given Bengal a completely violence-free poll. It is no mean achievement in a state notorious for its culture of political violence. Whether the polls will change that culture is another question.

 A WORLD OF THEIR OWN 

 Tapas Chakraborty

 During a routine sortie , a Dornier aircraft of the coast guard spotted an unmanned dinghy on the North Sentinel island in January. The same day, the Vandoor Fishermen Welfare Association informed the Port Blair police that a dinghy carrying two fishermen had remained untraced for the last two days.

 What unfolded thereafter is a story of the fight for survival between two kinds of people: one exposed to civilization and venturing out to unknown territories for subsistence and another resisting the invasion into their age-old culture that has been termed as uncivilized and barbaric.

 The Sentinelese tribes killed two fishermen, Sunder Raj and Pandit Tiwari, resisted attempts of the coast guard to retrieve the bodies and buried the corpses in the island. An example of tribal savagery? Anthropologists don?t agree. 

 Raj and Tiwari were exploring the possibility of catching mud crabs illegally off North Sentinel Island. Coast guard sources said that the fishermen had dropped anchor for the night and gone to sleep. The anchor failed to save their uncovered boat against the currents and the fishermen drifted towards their destiny. After spotting the strangers from afar, the tribesmen pounced on the ?invaders? and killed them.

 Photographs taken by the coast guard showed the two fishermen buried in shallow graves. They had not been roasted and eaten though there were rumours in the main island that the fishermen had been devoured by the tribes.The police have now suspended the search for bodies of the slain fishermen as they wanted to avoid further mishaps that might raise the death toll.

 Better alone

 With the outside world turning into a civilization driven by technology, the Sentinelese are now up in arms against this so-called civilized world and blame it for all the bad things that have happened to them over the years. These tribals survived the tsunami and they possess a body of knowledge that the civilized world can envy. But they are not ready to part with it as that goes against their culture.

 The media, especially in the West, have covered the incident extensively and referred to the Sentinelese as tribes of the ?Stone Age?. Some reports have even said that the tribes are ?untouched by modernity?. In a sensitive analysis of the event, The Guardian has quoted Stephen Corry, director of Survival International, an organization that campaigns for tribal people, as saying that this view is ?fundamentally a throwback to a colonial way of thinking?. Corry also justifies the resistance efforts of the tribes ? ?If you look at the historical record, that?s a perfectly rational decision. Their neighbours are often decimated as a result of contact.? 

 The state of affairs of the smaller tribes in the Andamans confirm what Corry says. The Jarawas, whose members made first contact with the outside world in 1997, have dwindled to 350 in number. The Onges now number 99, Shompens have 350 members and the little Andamanese are left with 39 of their tribesmen 

 With the Indian government networking with Thailand to promote tourism on the island, the resistance of the Sentinelese should send a message to our policy-makers. In fact, incidents of Sentinelese resistance may recur. For history has never favoured the Sentinelese. The Eighties and early Nineties saw many of them being killed in gun battles with armed men who had visited the island after a shipwreck.

 The turtle, fish, forest vegetables, fruits and wild pigs are all that the Sentinelese survive on. Their reputation for hostility towards outsiders is born out of fear and their unshakable faith in their own customs. What is the problem if a group of people wants to be left on its own? Should we not honour such a right?

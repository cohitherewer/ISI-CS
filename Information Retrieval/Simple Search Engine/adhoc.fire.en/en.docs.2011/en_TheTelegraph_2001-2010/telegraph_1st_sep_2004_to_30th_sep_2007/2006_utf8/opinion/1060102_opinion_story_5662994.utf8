 Letters to Editor

 Unclean shave

 Sir ? Whenever Indian politicians find themselves in a soup of their own making, they try to save their skin by fabricating some story about some conspiracy being hatched against them. Sanjay Joshi is no exception. However, Pramod Mahajan?s comparison of Joshi to Sita is both ludicrous and shocking (?Support for stained Joshi?, Dec 28). Mahajan has not only belittled his own party but has also insulted the Indian cultural tradition as well. He must retract his statement and apologize.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Nivedita Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The sex scandal involving Sanjay Joshi has harmed the Bharatiya Janata Party more than the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. The BJP president, L.K. Advani, was not wrong in announcing that his party has made history. And it is part of that shameful history that the party came to power by cashing in on communal issues like the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid controversy, and revelled in the genocide in Gujarat. This is not to say that the BJP has achieved nothing positive at all in 25 years, but that it should think twice before defaming other parties. Recent incidents have repeatedly served to blacken the BJP?s face and now the the sex racket involving the party general-secretary has dealt a severe blow to both the image and credibility of the party. Advani should have had the courage to accept the reality of the gross indiscipline in his party. If the party fails to mend its ways soon, it might alienate itself completely from both the public and from allied parties.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The RSS, which often seems to have taken upon itself the role of India?s moral police, has now got itself involved in a sleaze controversy. The BJP is going to find itself in deep waters, what with the unearthing of the skulls of suspected riot victims in Gujarat. The BJP better keep a strict vigil on the nefarious activities of the party members if it wants to retain its credibility in a secular state like India.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is shocking to find someone of Sanjay Joshi?s stature in a compromising position, and quite literally. The RSS has always tried upholding a lofty moral stance and the pracharaks have had to seek permission to lead a married life, as L.K. Advani did. Some of the sangh family members, like Sushma Swaraj, has even gone to the extent of banning some television commercials. Yet we now find people like Sanjay Joshi in the party. Perhaps the BJP should desist from preaching to others what it does not practise itself.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Restating facts

 Sir ? This refers to Gwynne Dyer?s article, ?The Samurai returns? (Dec 5), and his statement that Japan?s latest move be interpreted as the ?final proof of a vast conspiracy? against China. The allegation is groundless. Dyer has, as proof of a Japanese conspiracy, pointed to the reform of the ?peace constitution? and re-definition of Japan?s common strategic objective with the United States of America. But none of the points raised by Dyer is sufficient to hold Japan responsible for any conspiracy. This kind of assertion is unreasonable because it overlooks the historical fact that Japan has been consistently keeping the position of a peaceful democratic nation for sixty years after World War II.

 As for Mr Junichiro Koizumi?s so-called declaration that Japan?s peace constitution should be changed, the Liberal Democratic Party, the current ruling political party of Japan, has come up with a proposal for reviewing the existing constitution and to enable amendment if it is supported by a majority. But pacifism and democracy, both fundamental principles of the current constitution, have been adhered to in the said proposal. In addition, Mr Koizumi, the Japanese prime minister, has never remarked that Japan?s peace constitution be altered. 

 With reference to the phrase ?contemporary Japan?s reluctance to take full responsibility for its past crime?, Japanese leaders have categorically expressed their remorse and apologies successively up to now. In the Asian-African Summit of April 2005 and in a remark made by him on August 15, Mr Koizumi admitted that, ?Japan through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations?, and squarely faced these facts of history in a spirit of humility. He stated his resolve to prize the relationship of trust Japan enjoys with the nations of the world. Needless to say, the above statement is for countries including China. Particularly, in relation with China, it has been stated in the Japan-China Joint Declaration announced in 1998, ?The Japanese side is keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious distress and damages that Japan caused to China during a certain period in the past and expressed deep remorse for this.?

 The joint statement of US-Japan security consultative committee in February, 2005, mentions the encouragement of ?peaceful resolution of issues concerning the Taiwan Strait through dialogue? as one of common strategic objectives of Japan and the United States. This is reflective of Japan?s position, which has been consistently maintained up to now. 

 Yours faithfully,

Yoshikazu Takeuchi, consul-general of Japan, Calcutta

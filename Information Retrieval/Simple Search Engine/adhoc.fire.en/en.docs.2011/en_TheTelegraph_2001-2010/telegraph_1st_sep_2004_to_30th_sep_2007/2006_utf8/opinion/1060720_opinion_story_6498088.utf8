 BLOGS IN A SPOT

 None can accuse the Indian government of weak reflexes. The horses may have bolted, but there can be no question about the firmness with which the stable doors have been shut ? or are thought to have been shut. In an order that came two days after the Mumbai blasts, the government came cracking down on 18 websites that host innumerable blogs (one of them had provided yeoman service to blast victims) and asked local internet service providers to block access to them. The presumed aim is to screen out blogs which are allegedly spreading ?anti-national? sentiments, and are suspected to be favoured by terror groups for communication. But there is no official line on this as yet. Responsible officers of the department of telecommunications, which enforced the order, and those of the department of information technology (actually responsible for cyber-security) have steadfastly refused to comment. Meanwhile, all that this attempt at muzzling cyber-freedom has done is force a change of habit among the committed bloggers and their readers. They are simply opting for different blog-hosting sites to access their chosen domains, whose popularity may go up several notches now.

 People, although the government may think otherwise, are indeed smart. They are smart enough to see that the block on websites is a direct assault on their right to freedom of expression and to information guaranteed by the Indian democracy. Many, in fact, are already contemplating approaching the law courts to assess if their rights, granted by the Right to Information Act, have not been violated by the order. And unlike the government, people are also smart enough to realize the futility of using the ban to discipline terrorist groups, which have found a myriad ways to use cyberspace. The only thing this country?s population may fail to figure out is how to keep the government from trying to have a toehold in every aspect of their lives. It is a peculiar habit with the Congress-led government, perhaps given the party?s historical baggage of interventionism, that it wants to have a say in every matter of both public and private life, be it on how much sex and violence one should see on screen or on where one should be seen smoking. It is only when it comes to saving people?s lives, from poverty or from violence, that it is found missing.

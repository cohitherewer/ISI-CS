 NEW AGE OF 

 GILDED HORRORS 

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 The Jorasanko Gate is another brazen 

 display of the city?s bad taste

 Any reader who had chanced upon 

 a recent news item on the theft of Edvard Munch?s famous 

 work, The Scream, may have been startled by the fact 

 that it was painted way back in 1893. At a time when even 

 in the West, society was still repressive and claustrophobic, 

 this great Norwegian artist had plumbed the depths of despair 

 and neuroses that are inescapable in today?s world.

 One may also have been struck 

 by the fact that around this time in the late 19th century, 

 Rabindranath Tagore used to paint and doodle enigmatic human 

 faces and fanciful creatures veiled in mystery that did 

 not even try to be realistic, not unlike the swirling, misty 

 lines and ectoplasmic visitations in Munch.

 One throws up one?s arms in despair 

 when one discovers the same fanciful creatures of Tagore?s 

 imaginings, reborn, presumably as terracotta moulding, on 

 the gate erected at the intersection of Chittaranjan Avenue 

 and Madan Chatterjee Lane. Written on the arch is Jorasanko 

 Thakurbari in what is supposed to be Tagore?s scrawl. So 

 one assumes it is meant to be the portal of the family seat. 

 Such monumental, brazen and unbridled display of bad taste 

 in public is rarely seen outside the war paint of K-series 

 heroines and Kolkata Panorama in the Town Hall where the 

 pi?ce de r?sistance is a moth-eaten effigy of Tagore 

 that wobbles its head and breaks into a song.

 Even the ugliness of the towering 

 water tank dubbed Calcutta Gate that the previous mayor 

 had planned to foist on the city pales into insignificance 

 before this gilded horror. This Mayorgate ? for it has been 

 erected by the Calcutta Municipal Corporation ? is an archway 

 gone noticeably askew. Supported on stunted columns with 

 lotus feet, it can trace its origin neither to any classical 

 order nor the indigenous models. In red, with patches of 

 black, it could easily become a byword for ornamentation 

 in excess.

 At the base are snatches of verse 

 scribbled on white ceramic tiles. Perched on top is the 

 poet himself, looking northwards. It should be interesting 

 to find out what this epitome of the civilized man would 

 have to say about this pedestal. Perhaps he would have repeated 

 the verse he had composed when he was feted in London after 

 the publication of Geetanjali, to the effect that 

 he was unworthy of the honour.

 One would have thought that the 

 height of ugliness had been scaled with the construction 

 of the new state secretariat at 4 Camac Street. But Jorasanko 

 Gate takes the cake.

 It is undeniable that when reverence 

 is blind, it could lead to the most untoward and disconcerting 

 results, one such being the death of our aesthetic sensibilities. 

 Witness some of our national icons who have become the victims 

 of our collective banality. 

 Misshapen images of Gandhi, Subhas 

 Bose, Indira Gandhi and her martyred son grace the walls, 

 streets and lanes of our city. Tagore is not spared either, 

 his clay models sharing pride of place with the armless 

 Venus in many a middle-class home.

 But such lumpish images are the 

 equivalents in plastic form of graffiti and slogans scrawled 

 on the backs of vehicles, and, unlike the Jorasanko Gate, 

 have no artistic pretensions. And public money is not involved 

 either in installing the streetside statues or in painting 

 graffiti, whereas lakhs, if not crores, go down the drain 

 to give shape to offerings such as the Jorasanko Gate. These 

 were not chance directed nor chance erected either, like 

 the city of Calcutta.

 This is nothing short of desecration 

 of the poet?s memory. Yet paradoxically, Visva Bharati, 

 the custodian of Tagore?s letters, has yet to bring out 

 an unexpurgated version of his correspondence. In the published 

 version, most references to his personal life have been 

 expunged. God cannot have a personal life, but if Caliban 

 cannot comprehend the greatness of the object of his worship, 

 he must bring him down to his own boorish level. But Caliban 

 gets away with it because as a people, we seem to be incapable 

 of critical thinking. When the critical edge gets blunted, 

 barbarism becomes the order of the day.

 Letters to Editor

 Clear the air

 Sir There was much hoopla over the Union health ministrys ban on smoking on screen. And yet, in the remake of Don, we find Shah Rukh Khan toying with his cigarette lovingly. Has the ban failed then? If not, how can the film be allowed to make it to auditoriums? Don will be watched with interest by both adults and children and hence one cannot underestimate the impact of the display. Teenagers will now try to live up to the image of the hero and children will emulate him during play. A. Ramadoss was right in formulating the ban. Now it needs to be enforced. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Shilpa Goel, Rishra

 Coloured dreams

 Sir The report, Oscar ticket for Rang De (Sept 26), comes as no great surprise. The hero, who does not believe in Indian awards but is thrilled about the Oscars, and who talks of environmentalism while selling pesticide-loaded soft drinks, is a far more calculative gentleman than suspected. The Oscar entry is probably part of a larger gameplan a small favour in return for getting under the skin of a saffron rival. Rang De Basanti also has a heroine who has the censor board chief as her mother. Given its high connections, it is not unusual for the film to make it to the Oscar milieu despite contemporary classics like Lage Raho Munnabhai or Omkara, which have a more loyal audience.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir Rang De Basanti has not only done well at the box office, but it has also won critical acclaim. The film occupies a special place in the hearts of millions of people in this country and abroad. The film had a strong story line and a star cast. Aamir Khan once again proved that he is the finest actor in Bollywood. This is his second movie to win an entry into the Oscars. Rang De Basanti reflects the modern Indian scenario and will hold its ground on the international stage because of its cinematic excellence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanta Das, Calcutta

 Sir Where Lagaan and Black failed to click, it is unlikely that a pedestrian film like Rang De Basanti will bag an Oscar. However, given the fact that money does the talking in film circles, it is not surprising that the film has managed to make it to the awards. Lagaan showed that the song and dance routine does not satisfy the Oscar jury. Rang De has a substantial portion of that formula. This film might have been a block-buster but it is not worth an Oscar entry. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Rang De Basanti beat eight films to make it to the Oscars. It is good that Indian film-makers are now coming up with good ideas and scripts. Rang De was a fine example of a combination of a brilliant script, screenplay, songs and direction. The film has not only been a commercial success but it has inspired youngsters as well. The candle light protest shown in the film is now a new Indian way of public protest. This was evident in the public uproar following the acquittals in the Jessica Lal murder case. Indians will fervently hope that the movie gets an Oscar.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Parting shot

 Sir A recent advertisement by the Indian Railways must have satisfied a number of egos at one go. Apart from the dozen guests of honour, it lists the names of several distinguished guests and special guests. Indian Railways may have made a turnaround, but what purpose is served by such an advertisement? Could this money not have been used to improve the service? Do those featured in the ad think that this is money well-spent? 

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Haksi, Ranchi

 DEFENCE LINES

 A defence minister, by virtue of the post he holds, has to see himself and his role as being very different from that of the top brass of the armed forces. He has to be conscious all the time that he does not think or speak like army generals, admirals and air marshals. This may appear easy on paper but that is not the case in practice. Many veteran politicians, once they assumed the post of defence minister, have almost unconsciously donned the brass hat or the beret. In a democracy, the distinction between civilian leadership and military leadership must not only be maintained but also the latter has to remain subservient to the former at all times. Mr A.K. Antony needs to be reminded of these verities as he takes over as the new defence minister. This is not because these had been lost or obscured in the previous dispensation but because they deserve to be reiterated every time a new defence minister is appointed.

 Mr Antony faces problems which are to do with the day to day functioning of the defence ministry. One of these is a meaningless controversy which could occupy peoples minds only in India. This is to do with the presence of middlemen in defence buying and selling. Suddenly, there is a moral outcry against the operation of middlemen in defence deals. A position as extreme as the banning of all middlemen has been articulated in certain circles. The absurdity of this position is, in fact, beneath contempt. The removal of middlemen would bring practically all economic transactions to a complete standstill. In all spheres of economic activity a group of people call them middlemen, agents, brokers, what have you operates in the space that separates producer from consumer and buyer from seller. From commodities of everyday use to big guns the selling of everything is done through middlemen. A retail shopkeeper is also a middleman. The presence of the latter in defence deals is required because of the specialized and the narrow nature of the market. This argument should not be read as an endorsement of those brokers who use underhand means to ensure a contract or of military personnel who get implicated in such underhand deals. But the bay cannot and should not be thrown out with the dirty bath water. Mr Antony will have enough problems to deal with without being distracted by irrelevant issues.

 ON THE RISE

 The Sensex has had a marvellous ride in recent years, rising from 2900 in May 2003 to a high of 10000 on Monday. That is an almost three-and-a-half fold rise in two-and-a-half years, and it has resulted in a vast expansion of investor wealth. Nor is there any sign of a decrease in momentum ? the rise from 9000 to 10000 has happened in less than two months. The market has proved to be remarkably resilient, bouncing back from every drop. It has taken in its stride the fall of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government and the rise of the United Progressive Alliance, it has ignored rising interest rates in the United States of America, and it has brushed aside dire predictions of a slowdown in corporate earnings. It has, in short, resolutely ignored all bad news.

 How far is the rally based on economic fundamentals? There is no doubt that much has changed in corporate India in the past five years. Interest rates have come down sharply, companies have become leaner and more efficient, and there has been a boom in consumption fuelled by the availability of cheap retail credit. In the last one year, investment demand too has picked up as companies started expanding capacity, while export demand has been robust. However, there are signs that the peak of the cycle is behind us. Earnings growth has decelerated. Market valuations are stretched and India is now one of the more expensive emerging markets. Surprisingly, foreign institutional investment net inflows continue to be very good, while local money too is making its way into the market, as seen from the amounts mopped up by domestic mutual funds. Simply put, liquidity continues to be very strong. Much of that is a consequence, not of domestic factors, but of easy monetary policy in the US, which has led to a tsunami of liquidity across all asset markets, resulting in higher prices for commodities, gold and emerging market stocks and bonds. True, part of the reason is undoubtedly an improvement in the fundamentals of emerging markets, but a lot of it is simply the result of too much money chasing assets. The crucial question, of course, is whether the rise in liquidity will continue to offset any slowdown in corporate earnings growth. Japanese funds have already started putting their money into India and there are reports of Middle Eastern oil surpluses being invested in the Indian market. In the last year or two, India has become a much desired asset class. Nevertheless, at these levels, there are signs of irrational exuberance. Most investors have already made a lot of money, and it will be prudent to book profits.

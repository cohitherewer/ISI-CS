 SLAYING THE MONSTER

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Fallen hero

 Did you know your Muslim friend is in love with Saddam Hussein? She told me so herself, he said. Later, I confronted my lady friend and asked her bluntly: I am told you are in love with Saddam Hussein. Is it true?

 She blushed a deep red and replied, See the way his American jailors treated him! Running their fingers through his hair and beard as if looking for lice. Is this the way to treat a fallen foe, the president of a country?

 Americans are not known for their good manners, I replied. They stripped our defence minister, George Fernandes, on arrival at the airport. We are still on talking terms with them. Saddam is a different matter. I recounted the crimes he had committed as head of state: ten years unprovoked war in Iran, annexation of Kuwait, ethnic cleansing of Kurds, persecution and killing of Shias. I went on to repeat what I have been saying many times before: no one in the history of the world shed more blood than Saddam Hussein. He is worse than that monster Idi Amin of Uganda who fled his country and was allowed to die in peace in Saudi Arabia. How can anyone, Muslim or non-Muslim, forgive Saddam? He even murdered his daughters husbands and many other relations.

 The sentence of death passed by the panel of five judges, none of whom was nominated by the Americans, took the lid off the historic divide between Muslims. The Shias are happy; Sunnis resent it; the Hizbullah of Lebanon, till recently heroes of the Muslim world for their resistance to Israeli incursions, approve of the sentence; so also Shias of Iran. Other Muslims who are Sunnis and in vast majority do not. Communists have a simple formula; if the Americans are on one side, we must be on the other.

 Prakash Karat, general secretary of the CPI(M), and his fiery spouse, Brinda Karat, must perforce condemn an imperialist, capitalist conspiracy of the Anglo-Americans. They have a good precedent to follow which requires neither much thinking nor moral compunctions. Non-Muslims are indifferent or react as expected; the most nave of them are the Indians. You might recall the time when Saddam annexed Kuwait. Our then foreign minister, I.K. Gujral, flew over to Kuwait, gave Saddam a friendly hug of approval, when thousands living in the country were assured safe survival. The Kuwaitees never forgave them for their betrayal. It came to be known as the Gujral doctrine: wherever you meet anyone you have to deal with, give him a bear hug and recite a couplet of Urdu poetry.

 Light of other days

 The first thing I do on getting up after a nights sleep is put down the time in my diary. Its been getting earlier and earlier by the day. It used to be 5 am, then 4.30 am, 4 am and now it is usually 3 am. I am no longer sure if it can be described as day or night. I draw my window curtain to see. At times it is pitch dark and there is dead silence. At other it is bathed in moonlight. However, it is a daily reminder that I am running short of time; so I better do what I intend to before it is too late. Unfortunately, at that hour I am in no mood to do anything except brood over the past. I try to empty my mind and make it still. I rarely manage to do this for more than a few seconds. Silently, I go over my version of the Gayatri mantra: I marvel at the earth and the cosmos; I imagine the sun rising and giving light and life to everything. I wish my mind was more enlightened than it is. 

 I am unable to get down to work. So I switch on my satellite radios Maestro channel. I try to guess whether it is Mozart, Bach, Beethoven or Haydn. I am never certain. I am sure Zubin Mehta would know at once. Even through the melodious harmony of orchestral music, my mind goes back to days past: to the village lost in the sad dunes where I spent my earlier years with my grandmother. Shes been gone over 70 years, but I ask her, Where are you? She answers with a smile. Lines of Thomas Moores The Light of Other Days steal into my thoughts:

 Oft in the stilly night/ Ere slumbers chain has bound me,/ Fond Memory brings the light/ Of other days around me:/ The smiles, the tears/ Of boyhoods years,/ The words of love then spoken;/ The eyes that shone,/ Now dimmd and gone,/ The cheerful hearts now broken!/ Thus in the stilly night/ Ere slumbers chain has bound me,/ Sad Memory brings the light/ Of other days around me.

 Moore was talking about post-dinner thoughts as he sat by a dying fire overcome with sleep. Why should similar thoughts beset me after having had a full nights sleep? Nevertheless, the past haunts me. I think of my grandmother, then my grandfather, who called me pharooah (pimp), my parents, uncles, aunts, cousins, brother and sister. Where are they? More than my kin, I recall my friend Manzur Qadir who died in a London hospital, having Allama Iqbal and the Quran read out to him. Krishen Shinglo, who was going to write a best-seller entitled Woman with Golden Breasts. He did not get beyond the title. His wife, Sarojini, who coyly looked down when the novel was mentioned to see if it referred to her. Prem Kirpal, who churned out reams of blank verses which no one wanted to read, and painted pictures no one wanted in his home. Where are they?

 I see a huge wall with the words: The End painted on it. I shout, Where are you? The echo comes back to me, Where are you?

 And Moores conclusion: When I remember all/ The friends so linkd together/ Ive seen around me fall/ Like leaves in wintry weather./ I feel like one/ Who treads alone/ Some banquet-hall deserted/ Whose lights are fled/ Whose garlands dead,/ And all but he departed!

 Alls fair in love

 Mahesh: I love you. Will you marry me?

 Roma: I will only marry a man who is either older than me, or at least the same age as me. And you are two months younger to me.

 Mahesh: Not really. You see, I was a premature baby born in the seventh month.

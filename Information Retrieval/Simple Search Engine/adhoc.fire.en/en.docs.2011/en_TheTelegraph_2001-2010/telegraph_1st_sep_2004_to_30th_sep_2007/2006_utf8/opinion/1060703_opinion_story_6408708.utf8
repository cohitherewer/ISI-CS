The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Frenzied wheels

 Sir ? It is time drivers of vehicles in Calcutta did some introspection (?PM throws a polite punch?, June 25). Driving etiquettes and road manners are anathema to the appalling driving culture of Calcutta. Impatience and intolerance are the hallmarks of drivers, passengers and pedestrians alike. On Calcutta?s roads, the values that Manmohan Singh talked about are thrown to the wind. Here, might is right, and the loss of a few lives or limbs are merely incidental. Instead of just selling vehicles, automobile companies should teach driving etiquette too. Why can?t the transport authorities and automobile giants institute annual awards for safe driving? 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The prime minister has done a great service by pointing out our impolite and irresponsible behaviour towards others in public. But bad road manners and mistimed horns are not the only vices. People have also become unsocial, intolerant, aggressive and unsympathetic. The effect of all this is to be seen in the poor manners of most people. These are also among the reasons why Calcutta is falling behind in the race with other cities. In Mumbai and Delhi, misleading the tourist or speaking rudely to them are almost routine. Calcutta has always been famous for its helpfulness. But these days, even the simplest of gestures such as giving up one?s seat for the elderly, ill and women are going out of practice. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Understandably, there has been a furore over Mumbai?s being voted the ?rudest? among 35 cities of the world. But, before jumping to any conclusion, it is important to keep all parameters equal when comparing two or more cities. A city bursting at the seams ? with inadequate transportation, crowded trains and buses, traffic congestion on unsafe roads, accidents and crime, red-tapism and corruption ? is bound to tell on the psyche of the average resident. Small wonder then that a section of the crowd is perceived as ?rude? because of the stress levels of people in this fast-paced city. Thus, Mumbai should be compared only with a city with similar living and working conditions, infrastructure and level of development.

 Yours faithfully,

Nitin G. Gokarn, Mumbai

 Sir ? Earlier, drivers would teach road and traffic sense to others. Today, traffic conditions in Calcutta are at their worst. There may still be good drivers who do not need to be trained, but most could do with a strict training regime. The real need, however, is to regularize the transport system. Besides, the commission system of paying private bus drivers should be replaced by a salary system. A final need is to ensure that buses stop only at the bus-stops.

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 To be better informed

 Sir ? In most government offices, it is difficult to access the officers despite the Right to Information Act. Nor is it easy to get the required information over the telephone. Every important government office (with a lot of public transactions) should print a directory of officers ? names, designations, room/floor numbers, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses ? annually. A record of e-mails and telephone calls received by them must be maintained and the same should be checked by higher authorities to see what action is being taken on those calls, mails and even personal visits by the people. Finally, such a directory should be easily available on the internet. Only with easy access to information and officials and speedy response to applications can Indians live in a genuine information democracy. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

 Sir ? The Union government?s move to publicize the RTI Act is welcome. However, the govern- ment should also simplify the rules governing the use of the act. At present, different government departments require not only an RTI fee, but also separate fees for applications to different officers. Again, some departments do not accept cheques and postal orders. Fees should be payable under a common head such as that of the Central Information Commission and drafts and postal orders should be accepted for the same. Then people will be able to counter-file their applications under the act because, right now, most departments discourage such applications. According to news-reports, the judiciary and the army are seeking exemption from the act. But no dilution or exemption should be allowed, since Section 8 of the RTI Act gives adequate powers to public officers to decline information on various grounds. Finally, the CIC should get exclusive premises considering the manifold increase in its workload in the near future.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Delhi

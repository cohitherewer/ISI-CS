The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Whatever too many cooks do to the broth, too many ministers of state certainly make for a very confused external affairs ministry. With the three ministers of state ? Anand Sharma, E. Ahmad and Vyalar Ravi ? stepping on one another?s toes all the time, the PM is frequently striking his familiar helpless pose these days. Sharma is in charge of Latin America but he finds west Asia more interesting. So he decided to brief the media on the Lebanon crisis himself, and called a press conference at 4.30 the other day. But Ahmad, the real west Asia in-charge, would have none of this. So he called his own press conference at 6 the same evening and went to complain to the PM, who also holds the external affairs portfolio. Manmohan Singh, thoroughly annoyed, sent off his media adviser, Sanjaya Baru, to stop Sharma?s briefing. Poor Ahmad, his PC got scrapped as well, and the ministry spokesperson, Navtej Sarna, was asked to do the honours. And what did the other MoS, Ravi, do on seeing his peers in action? Not wanting to lag behind, he promptly rushed to Kerala to receive the Indians arriving from Lebanon.

 Some are born politicians, some grow into politics, some others look for still greener pastures. Sharad Pawar has found his patch of green on the cricket field and in the office of the BCCI. But Lalit Modi, the young Turk from Rajasthan and a Pawar-loyalist, prefers to do things the other way round. Having become the vice-president of the BCCI, he now feels ready to take on the big bad world of politics. He has on his side the Rajasthan chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, who is known to have tried to send Modi to the Rajya Sabha in the last biennial elections. Till the road to parliament opens up, Indian cricket should give Modi enough net practice.

 But proceedings in the parliament are getting curiouser and curiouser. During a recent debate on the Mumbai blasts, the interruptions got so out of hand that a solemn discussion was transformed into a haze of din in a matter of minutes. When order could finally be restored, a Congress member got up and complained to PJ Kurien, then chairing the session, that a member of the opposition had called him a joker. ?But I am not a joker, I am a member of the house,? he offered. Satisfied with this clarification of the member?s credentials, Kurien asked the offending word to be expunged from the record. But there was one problem. It could not be expunged from the live telecast of the proceedings. 

 If Big B comes to London, can small A be far behind? Of course not. Amar Singh was behind alright, but right behind Bachchan senior. He even announced that the proceeds of the fundraising dinner to celebrate Bachchan?s honorary doctorate from De Montfort University would go to the victims of the Mumbai blasts. But the subtext was hard to miss. Soon after the Gujarat earthquake, photographs of Singh having fun at his birthday bash were all over the papers. That didn?t do the Samajwadi leader?s image any good. Hence the thought of making amends, perhaps?

 After Operation Bluestar, in a move to smooth the feathers she had ruffled, Indira Gandhi had ordered that the original glory of the Golden Temple be restored. To that end, large quantities of gold were imported, leading soon to reports of their diversion into private hands. Something similar appears to have happened recently, if reports from Pakistan are anything to go by. Late last year, a team of Delhi Sikhs ? a breakaway faction of the Akali Dal ? visited the Nankana Sahib shrine in Pakistan. With great fanfare, it also gifted the shrine a palaki (topping) made of ten kilograms of gold. Only recently has it been revealed by Pakistani authorities that the amount of gold brought by the Sikh delegation was a mere one kg. In the name of wahe guru, what happened to the remaining nine kgs? The Akali Dal, too, is apparently demanding an answer to the same question.

 Here is a passage from Jaswant Singh?s book, A Call to Honour: In Service of Emergent India, more significant than all the ?Smiley? revelations.

 It reads: ?My riding skills became much more polished, decidedly more mature but reckless still. This caused many falls, some injuries too. I suffered two concussions but the RMO of the Academy pronounced me fit. [He asked] ?What is your skull made of, wood?? ?

 Now what would Brajesh Mishra say to that? 

 Now that it is clear that the office of profit bill is going back to the president without any changes, everyone who is anyone is wondering what APJ Abdul Kalam is thinking. Does he have any ace up his sleeve which no one has been able to guess so far? In their desperate effort to get inside the scientist-president?s head, UPA bosses ? I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi featuring prominently in the list ? are even known to have consulted journalists. Clearly, the government wants to have a counter-strategy ready, whatever the situation. But what if Kalam, in keeping with his image as an upright, no-nonsense man, decides to resign in protest against his opinion being ignored? The UPA think tank has prepared for that eventuality too. The names doing the rounds as likely successors to Kalam are Narain Dutt Tiwari, and the Bengal brigade of Pranab Mukherjee, Somnath Chatterjee and Jyoti Basu. Calcutta chromosome at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, then?

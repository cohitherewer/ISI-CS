 Letters to Editor

 Casting in a new mould

 Sir The recently released report of the Rajinder Sachar committee depicts a grim picture of Muslims in India (Tale of minority deprivation, Nov 18). It reveals that the community is lagging behind others in all spheres of life. Their literacy level is much below the national one, resulting in poor representation in public- and private-sector industries. Also, in urban India, Muslims mostly live in the slum areas, in stark contrast to the affluence and material wealth of a few elite ones. 

 We can hardly blame others, as we have ourselves chosen the path of seclusion and marginalization. Therefore, first, an affirmative action on the part of Muslims is required. But the government too needs to help by focusing its attention on promoting primary and secondary education among the Muslims. The thrust should be on modern education that has the potential to add values and create assets in community lives. The outlook of the madrassahs has to be revamped to bring them on a par with global educational standards. This in turn will change the perception of Muslims towards themselves as well as others. These steps would go a long way towards creating a more progressive Muslim community. Apart from that, a responsible leadership is also required to provide proper guidance to the community.

 Yours faithfully,

Sohail Md., Calcutta

 Sir Whether a quota is the right approach towards socially backward and impoverished Muslims is not the real issue. The question is, what if sections of Muslims are enticed by the promises of equality, only to discover later that they have been betrayed and sent back to the lower rungs all over again? Are they, then, to be denied access to social justice that the political class claim to be committed to (Absurd quota, Nov 16)? If Sikhs and Buddhists have Dalit categories, there is no rationale to deny the existence of Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims. Leaders of the minority communities have mostly not bothered to look into intra-religious grievances; they have projected the community as a casteless religion and a unified force. To claim that there are no Dalits among Muslims on the basis of a fundamental tenet of Islam would be similar to rejecting the presence of communal people in India. Surely no religion encourages communal tendencies.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir It seems that there is no community in India that needs attention and care more than Muslims. Almost all political parties are going out of their way to appease them. Orthodoxy and bigotry are the main reasons for backwardness in both the minority and majority communities. Political largesse and quota policies are not the remedies for this; these can only make the backward citizens weaker. Unfair quota and vote-bank policies created thousands of undeserving millionaires who are destroying the democratic and electoral processes. If Indians have survived without quota for centuries, then there should be no need for such discriminatory systems today. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir Even as the media is full of opinions about the need for reservation for Muslims in jobs and education, one noticed that in the Indian cricket team playing in South Africa in the (abandoned) first match, there were four Muslim players, all of them from underprivileged families. All four have made it to the national team through sheer hard work, which was prioritized over their economic status and their faith. Reservations for Muslims would have been justified had there been a general bias against the community. Poverty and the lack of educational facilities are responsible for the backwardness of some sections of Muslims, and that is true of other religions as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir Once a community has achieved a certain degree of economic independence, it acquires the means to come out of the deprived category. Thereafter it does not require reservations and hence should not expect it any more. When a section of a community attains such independence, it can serve as an example for others within the community to emulate. This is the way society ought to be rid of the caste system. In any case, reservations should be based on an economic index, and not a religious one. Therefore, the backward sections among Muslims are just as much entitled to reservation as are such sections in other communities. Such measures will only prove that we are no longer held captive by parochial interests and are truly a secular society. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

 Sir The myth that Muslims are pampered in this country needs to be busted and there should be a concerted effort for the development of the community. Muslims, like all other communities, want to be a part of the countrys economic growth story and also contribute to it. So, initially, strong affirmative action and reservation are required. Caste-based reservations have been endorsed by the courts; the backward Muslims should also get the benefits of these quotas. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir The Rajinder Sachar committee has submitted its report to the prime minister, confirming that Muslims are educationally and economically backward, compared to the other religious communities. This report seems to be incomplete as it has failed to point out the cause of this backwardness. The Muslims, who form a significant percentage of our population, can contribute in a big way to the nations economy, if given equal opportunities with the rest. Equal opportunities include education, right from the primary level. Unfortunately, the Muslim clergy lay greater stress on religious teachings than anything else. Lagging behind in most other subjects of study, Muslims find themselves easily exploited by political and religious leaders. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bengalooru

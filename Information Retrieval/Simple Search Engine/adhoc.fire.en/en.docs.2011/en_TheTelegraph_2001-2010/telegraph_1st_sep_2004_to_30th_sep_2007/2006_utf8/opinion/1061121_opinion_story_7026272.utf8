 LACUNA OF NEW IDEAS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 India has become a desirable destination after many decades of being left out in the cold, unable to compete with smaller countries in Asia and elsewhere. Today, after a great Incredible India campaign, two energetic central ministers, Renuka Chowdhury, followed by Ambika Soni, have worked hard to make their government comprehend the value addition that travel, tourism and leisure brings to employment, development and growth. Till recently, all the old and disconnected men who ran this sector, succeeded in dwarfing its importance and potential because it was considered a soft sector, not macho enough for their fading realities. Women have proved to be dynamic, intelligent and able to deliver the goods. They have excited the world, and given a huge impetus to the young who want to activate the services sector. Fast becoming the first option to travel to, this country urgently needs to put in the infrastructure to handle the inflow.

 Babuism must not be allowed to stand in the way of change and the immediate rationalization of archaic norms that have stunted this growth area. Benefits, unencumbered with babugiri, should be doled out to encourage and entice entrepreneurs to enter the fray and relieve government from controlling style, creativity, expansion and hospitality. No government anywhere in the world and at any time in history can be described as hospitable. Comfort, happiness, joy, curiosity, enquiry, being human and savouring the excitement of discovery, of learning about other cultures and different lives, are something the rigid authority of government administration, with its more-important-than-you and fake VIP attitude, cannot bring into play. They have always been seen, through the decades, as the boulders in the way of potential bliss!

 Think more

 Therefore, a decentralization is essential for the travel trade to boom and come into its own. Ministries concerned should lay policy parameters and be facilitators, something the bureaucracy will have to be vigorously taught. They will have to be put through an examination to prove that their closed, predictable and disruptive mind set has changed. The two women have already made the initial statement for a fresh blueprint, have shifted gears and changed the course and direction of the ministry and policy during their tenures. For the next phase to take off, the tacit support of the prime minister is imperative. The babu must not be permitted to scuttle this time-bound opportunity because of his deep-seated sense of insecurity and his inability to let go of an economically lucrative industry.

 Co-related are many other major areas that have been hitherto exploited and then neglected. Lethargic and old-fashioned methodology used for conservation and preservation of our heritage; municipal ineptitude that has resulted in distressed and degraded habitats; dreadful regulations, complicated and tiresome paperwork that compel bribery and corruption in the service sector; urban building norms; the degradation of green spaces; polluting of our rivers; all these man-made problems which have assumed gargantuan proportions, and many similar issues, will have to be addressed. Travel and leisure form the great umbrella that houses the culture and reality of India. It is the largest industry.

 When will our planners step out of the imitative box from which they determine policy and therefore the future of India? Will they continue to wait for global exploitation and be satisfied with the crumbs that may come our way? Are they intellectually and creatively inadequate, unable to give India what she deserves? Why this lacuna of new ideas? Why is there no drawing in, no bringing together of diverse, plural thinking in an effort to devise innovative solutions? Why is it all so predictable and intellectually pedestrian?

 WHY CIVILIZATIONS MUST LOOK BACK TO MOVE FORWARD

 India and China in the colonial world Edited by Madhavi Thampi, Social Science press, Rs 395

 The relationship between India and China, the two ancient civilizations, is old. A section of the Indian literati is familiar with the history of India?s trade links with China as well as events like the Opium war, the Taiping movement, the Communist-revolution and so on. But the complexities of Indo-Chinese interactions in the colonial period are less illuminated. This collection should go a long way towards filling this gap. The reader should find many things of interest, such as the tumult created during Tagore?s visit to China, the early settlements of the Chinese community in Calcutta and so on. The essays in this volume are products of serious scholarly work and contain valuable information.

 It is very interesting to learn, from Sisir Kumar Das?s article that Chen Duxiu, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, was also an early translator of Tagore?s works in Chinese, and that the same Chen led some sort of an anti-Tagore agitation during that tempestuous visit. This article deserves special praise because in our country there are not many who are aware of this aspect of Sino-Indian intercourse. Similarly, the role of Tan Yun-Shan, the first principal of the Cheena-Bhavan at Visva-Bharati, in promoting Sino-Indian friendship has been illuminated in an article by Huang Chih-lien. That professor Tan was a boyhood friend of Mao Zedong and had a myriad life is not known to many of those who had seen him at close quarters. In his article, B. R. Deepak talks about the rebellion of Indian troops against their British masters and their involvement in the Taiping rebellion. The support of Indian troops for the rebels is an untold story which Deepak has unravelled. His article also proves that the two peoples have a long tradition of helping each other in the fight against imperialism. The articles by Asiya Siddiqi and Chen Zilong are valuable in the sense that they supplement already existing knowledge on the respective subjects. Ramkrishna Chatterjee?s piece on the Chinese community in Calcutta and Madhavi Thampi?s work on Indians in China offer interesting insights. 

 In an article rich in facts, Shalini Saksena tries to portray the various shades of Indian opinion on the emergence of the People?s Republic of China in 1949. The writer has noted that the ?Indian attitude towards the inevitability of communist victory in China began crystallizing even before the achievement of any major success?. But what Saksena fails to mention is the opinion of Jawaharlal Nehru, arguably the foremost international statesman of India at the time, on this subject. Even a year before the Communist victory, Nehru thought that Chiang?s rule was a stable one, while Sarat Bose had a clear understanding of what was about to happen. In Nehru, Chiang Kai-shek, and the Second World War, Avinash Mohan Saklani fails to make a note of this point, notwithstanding the detailed analysis on the nature of the relationship between the leaders of the two countries. It seems that Nehru was besotted by the rhetoric of Chiang, so much so that he could not comprehend the course of the war in China as well as the events that followed later. In this context, it can be mentioned that in a parliament speech in 1952, professor Meghnad Saha compared Nehru with Chiang Kai-shek in a tone of indictment. 

 In a small but significant article titled Subhash Chandra Bose?s perspective on China, Girish Chandra Maiti underlines the contradictions in Bose?s patriotism. The man was torn between his respect for the freedom struggle of the Chinese and his fierce anti-British attitude. While the latter was perfectly in keeping with his nationalism, he could not easily discard the former. The writer, while attempting to substantiate his opinion, should have noted what Bose said in his farewell statement on the eve of the Indian medical mission?s departure to China in order to help the anti-Japanese war of resistance.

 Surjit Mansingh?s attempts to analyze how the differences in perception, rather than correct assessments of reality, affected and embittered Sino-Indian relations during the periods of Nehru and Mao are engaging enough. However, Mansingh would have done well to examine how these differences were produced in the first place. Did the difference in class position of the two leaders have anything to do with the differences in perception which the writer has tried to point out?

 Taken as a whole, this collection of articles should add to our understanding of the various aspects of the Sino-Indian relations in the colonial and post-colonial periods. It would also encourage further investigations into the subject. This understanding and investigation is useful for developing a healthy relationship between the two countries in the near future.

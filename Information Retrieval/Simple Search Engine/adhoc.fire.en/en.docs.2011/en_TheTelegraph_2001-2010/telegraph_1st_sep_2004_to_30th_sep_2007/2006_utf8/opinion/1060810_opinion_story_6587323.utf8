 Letters to Editor

 More to come

 Sir The editorial, New Vision (Aug 2), has raised hopes as well as concerns. The Salim groups participation in a mammoth infrastructure project in Bengal is being seen by most Left Front members as a result of the chief ministers personal interest in the resurrection of Bengals economy. Unfortunately, there are not many takers for his vision even in his government except perhaps a few like the industries minister. The reasons for this negative attitude are purely political. It is because this project will bring prosperity to the state that forces opposed to it have kept it languishing for over three decades. Bhattacharjee will go down in history as one of the most visionary chief ministers the state has ever had. It is essential that he, along with like-minded members in his government, mobilizes support among the partys central leadership. The Haldia petrochemicals project got delayed, and almost derailed, in a similar way. When it finally materialized, it did not help much since the national and global scenario for petrochemicals had changed by then. It would be unfortunate if the Salim project meets with the same fate. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tapan Dutta,

 Sir The farmers, whose land is being acquired for setting up new industries, should be properly compensated. If the government can make mega-budget deals with foreign collaboration, it can very well give a share of the pie to the impoverished sharecroppers. In the service sector, employees get a compensation apart from the usual provident fund, gratuity, leave encashment and so on, if their service is terminated abruptly. Land is the sole form of insurance for the poor, illiterate peasants and the only legacy for their children. So, if a peasant is forced to give up cultivation, he should be given compensation adequate for supporting his family for the next fifty years at least through a pension calculated on the basis of the quantity of land given up. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Hara Lal Chakraborty,

 Sir In his bid to sign prestigious agreements with the Salim group, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has put aside the urgent problem of the thousands of closed factories in the state.But then, the chief minister is now more interested in the haves than the have-nots. So what if the latter have elected his party to power?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govinda Bakshi,

 Sir The new-look investor-friendly government of West Bengal is leaving no stone unturned in providing the best stretches of arable land to prospective investors. But has the chief minister and his cabinet taken into account the immediate and long-term effects of their action? In its rush to get land, the government will surely offer much more than the prevailing price of farmlands, which are always cheaper than housing plots. The sudden hike in land prices will result in the price of all commodities to go up abruptly. Those who have lost their land will move towards the already overcrowded towns and cities in search of work. Since no industry will be able to provide jobs to all of them, poverty and crime will rise. Instead of spending money on upgrading barren land, it would be more sensible to use those areas for setting up new industries. 

 Yours faithfully

 Bumpy ride

 Sir The editorial No need of a primrose way (Aug 6), hits the nail on the head. I live on Free School Street, which starts from the crossing at Park Street and moves down towards the fire brigade headquarters. Half the stretch has been dug up, with bricks and stones jutting out everywhere. Entry of vehicles into Jan Bazaar has been stopped. When I have to go to Jan Bazaar, the auto-rickshaw takes me to the Free School Street post office, turns left into Lindsay Street, and then turns right and goes past the clock tower to Jan Bazaar. From the clock tower area to the Jan Bazaar crossing, an impossible traffic jam awaits the traveller. Is it not a duty of the municipal authorities to ensure that road repairs do not inconvenience commuters?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Gautam Das Gupta, 

 Calcutta

 Sir As a corollary to the miserable road conditions in the city, I would like to bring to the notice of authorities the condition of footpaths. The sidewalks are meant for pedestrians. But, many a time, a neat footpath is dug up by utility and other companies and then, filled up clumsily with mud and rubbish. After a shower, this becomes a pedestrians hell. Why are these companies allowed to get away, without restoring the pavements to their original condition?

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.K. Ghosh, 

 Calcutta

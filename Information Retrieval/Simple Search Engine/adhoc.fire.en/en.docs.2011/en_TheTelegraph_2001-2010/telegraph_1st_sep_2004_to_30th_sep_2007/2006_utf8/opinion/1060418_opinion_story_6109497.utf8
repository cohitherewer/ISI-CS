 THE GREAT BETRAYAL

Malvika Singh

 Medha Patkar, and her continuing fast, seems to have had hardly any impact on the government. As it turns a blind eye to its own failure to rehabilitate the displaced, it continues to come across as uncaring and callous. Governments in our country have always neglected the poor and the less privileged, even though the rhetoric has been the exact opposite. They have betrayed the people, exploiting their isolation from the mainstream, also called the middle class. This could be because many ?leaders? are smitten by ?upward mobility?, lapping up the spoils of consumerism as they grow inept to deliver the goods promised in election manifestos. Given their intellectual lethargy, peppered with greed for personal aggrandisement, their inability to engage with the realities of their verbal commitment, these men and women have preferred to keep India underdeveloped and disconnected.

 Development is essential but not at the expense of the people, political values, correctness and integrity. ?For the people, by the people?... If dams and highways and suchlike have to be built, those who are being displaced for that growth must be compensated at market rates, not at the lowest ?tender?. If the government were decent in its policies and directives, people would join hands in that development initiative. The truth is that all governments, some more than others, have been grossly exploitative. Indians today firmly believe that those who govern are dishonest. As this stark truth gets firmly embedded in the body politic, Indians across the board get on with doing what they have to by whichever means they can use, regardless of the ?rules? and ?regulations?. They have had enough of this corrupt governance and have, individually, taken steps that allow them to be productive. That is the strength of India ? it grows despite the government.

 Daily horrors

 Had one promise of rehabilitation been successfully met, there would be none of this endless stalling of any and every potential project. Governments and political parties have, more often than not, been barriers to change. A healthy, educated population would make them accountable. Which is why health and education in this country, controlled by government diktat and administered by their bureaucracies, have been virtually non existent for hundreds of thousands of Indians, thus keeping poverty intact. That is one thing governments have achieved ? the conservation of poverty.

 We are the only country in the world where a traffic police force cannot control mad and drunk drivers on the roads. Excuses are perpetually forthcoming from superior bosses who have recently asked constables on duty to stay away from drunk drivers! Why not ask them to stay away from work. Period. 

 We are the only country in the world that allows and endorses a haphazard urban spread because those who administer municipalities are corrupt. We are now trying to clean up the mess without an alternative plan of action, once again, to keep the illegitimate money-making avenues open. We are ingenious when it comes to circumventing rules. And, when the rules belong to an age gone by, we are left with no option but to find ways of ?getting around it?, a contemporary Indian expression.

 We are the only country in the world that exploits, in an unthinking fashion, the natural habitat, thereby denuding the bounty of nature. If such balances are destroyed, we will be plagued with disease and destruction in the near future. Yes, there must be an escalating rate of growth, but not within a paradigm that deals with bits and pieces of the economy, one that is unable to deal with the whole because that exercise requires an honest, intellectual endeavour based on a mandate to cleanse and correct a system that has clearly broken down, allowing for the horrors we see each day.

 UNDERSTANDING A PAINFUL HISTORY

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from Gnter Grasss letter to the mayor of Danzig, Pawel Adamowicz 

 Dear Mr Adamowicz, I thank you for your letter and for the confidence that you have reposed in me even in this present situation. Even before my latest book, Peeling Onions, has been made available to the public, a controversy has been triggered off regarding the report about an episode pertaining to my younger years, not dominating the content of the book, which is disconcerting for the citizens of the city of Gdansk and at the same time has assumed threatening proportions for my existence.

 In my book that narrates the course of my life since 1939 when I was twelve, I report that in my youthful delusion as a 15-year-old I had wanted to join the U-Boot-Waffe (submarine division) but was not accepted. Instead, in September 1944, as almost a 17-year-old I was drafted to the Waffen-SS without my applying for it. At that time this happened to quite a few of my age. I could survive the two weeks of military duty from the beginning till the end of April 1945 only by chance.

 In the years and decades after the war, when I came to know of the horrific magnitude of the war crimes perpetrated by the Waffen-SS, out of sheer shame I kept this short but heavily weighing episode to myself, but did not dismiss it. Only now at this age did I find the literary form to report about it in a larger context. This silence can be construed as a mistake as is happening now and condemned. I also have to accept that due to my behaviour my honorary citizenship is being questioned by many citizens of the town of Gdansk. In this situation I am not entitled to refer to all that has constituted my lifes works over five decades as writer and socially committed citizen of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, I would like to claim for myself that I have understood the hard lessons imparted to me in my young years: my books and my political actions bear witness to that.

 I regret that I have burdened you and the citizens of Gdansk, to which I am deeply attached as a born Danziger, with a decision that would have been easier and fairer to make if my book were already available in Polish translation.

 To conclude my letter, I would like to thank the citizens of this city of yours and mine, who continue to have confidence in me. When on an earlier occasion in the beginning of the Fifties I had to comprehend that due to German fault one had to ultimately suffer the loss of my hometown Danzig, I publicly stood for this admittedly painful realization, also when I accompanied the then German Chancellor, Willy Brandt, to Warsaw in December 1970.

 Since then the burden of this loss has got more than lessened due to the post-war history of the city of Gdansk, because it was this city of yours and mine that was the source of political, pioneering initiatives in the form of a repeated workers movement fighting for freedom, which has gone down in history along with the names Solidarnosc and Lech Walesa. This process took shape in my books in the narrative mode; and in my political texts I have valued the violence-preventing method of the Round Table first practised in Gdansk as a model. I saw many reasons to be proud of my erstwhile hometown; it is there that the mental attitude originated that became effective throughout Europe, when it came to the question of terminating dictatorial rule without violence, thus also contributing to the collapse of the Berlin Wall and opening up the possibilities for true democracy. All that gives me the courage to continue the time-and-again-deadlocked dialogue between the Poles and the Germans, the Germans and the Poles, till all of us draw a conclusion from our painful history, a conclusion that will allow mutual understanding. 

 With regards,

 Gnter Grass

 Reading this letter, the Polish recipient 

 of the Nobel Prize for Peace, Lech Walesa, withdrew his 

 demand that Grass should surrender his honorary citizenship 

 of Danzig in the wake of his confession that he had been 

 part of the Waffen-SS.

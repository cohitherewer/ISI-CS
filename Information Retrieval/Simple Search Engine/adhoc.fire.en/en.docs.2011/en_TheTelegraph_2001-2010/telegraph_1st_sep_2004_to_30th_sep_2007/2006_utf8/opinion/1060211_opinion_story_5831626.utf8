 SHOOTING FROM THE LIP

 Raj Babbar has just been suspended from his party but the 53-year-old Samajwadi Party MP from Agra is clearly elated

 Know a man by the books he reads, the wise men said eons ago. These days, though, you get to know a man by the book he keeps in his visitors room. Take actor-politician Raj Babbars study. The walls are lined with tomes to suit the soul of every man. A hard-bound Koran rubs its spine with thick volumes of the Guru Granth Sahib. Historian Bipan Chandras Communalism in modern India is lying compatibly with books on Jainism and Hinduism. And there is a series on Marxism, too, not far from a book on Vivekananda. 

 But the book that sticks out like a sore thumb is the one that professes to teach its readers all that they wish to know about leadership. Raj Babbar, clearly, no longer needs to read How to be a leader ? this is a book he could well have written himself. Suddenly, the man who was till the other day just a Member of Parliament is being publicly feted as a leader. 

 A line of visitors streams in and out of his study. Babbar takes turns to hold closed-door confabulations with politicians, interviews with the press and impromptu meetings with political workers. Inquilab Zindabad, says an emotionally-charged supporter. This is the time for work, Babbar replies in a suitably grave tone. 

 The 53-year-old Samajwadi Party MP from Agra has just been suspended from his party, but there is a sense of celebration in his official bungalow in a quiet enclave a few hundred yards from Parliament. And Babbar, who suddenly shook the silly, pre-budget season of politics by taking pot-shots at Samajwadi big fish Amar Singh, is clearly elated. 

 This has been building up for a while, he says. For quite some time I have been taking up important issues like the rise of brokers in the party. And even this time, I had spoken out only at a party meeting. But Amar Singh called me up and said: Did you say all this thats been reported in the papers? I said: Are you threatening me? And, yes, this is the gist of what I said. And the next thing I knew, the press was knocking at my doors, asking questions. And once I was asked a direct question, I had to speak out.

 For those who came in late, heres the news in brief. In a series of interviews earlier this week, Raj Babbar described SP general secretary Amar Singh as a fixer who had brought about a broker culture in the party. Babbar was promptly suspended from the Parliamentary party and from the primary membership of the party and a three-member team was constituted to look into Babbars sudden outburst. 

 But now that the cork is out, the Babbar bubble is flowing with a vengeance. At the root of the problem, he says, is development work that has been stopped in Agra. The Prime Minister had okayed a scheme for water for the parched city, but the party refused to act. Another scheme for electricity met with similar disinterest. And the state government was sitting on a proposal for an airport in Agra. There is a lot of money to be had with these projects, he says. Thats what its all about. 

 Petitions to chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav ? once close to Babbar ? have yielded no results. Its anyway been eight months since Babbar last met his party chief. And thats not surprising, he says, because the party has been hijacked by Amar Singh. The problem with this broker culture is that the brokers are fast turning into leaders, he says. 

 There are many, in the SP wings and outside, who are quietly applauding Babbar. Raj has taken the right decision ? though its been long overdue, says former Samajwadi secretary Amitabh Adhar who left the party some five years ago. 

 Resentment against Amar Singh has been rising along with the man himself for sometime now. Old-timers rue that there was a time, not so long ago, when the Samajwadi Party was a political outfit driven by a socialist ideology. Then came Amar Singh ? more of a socialite than a socialist. In the last few years, the old cronies point out, Mulayam Singh has been seen more in the company of Bollywood actors and industrialists than his old friends and associates. 

 Adhar points out that it was not always so. People like Raj Babbar joined the party out of ideological conviction, he says. And he campaigned relentlessly along with Mulayam Singh Yadav when the CM was virtually a nobody. 

 Babbar, on the other hand, was quite a well-known actor then. The man from Agra ? he grew up in the UP city before moving to Patiala to study theatre in 1969 ? joined cinema in 1979, and went on to act in 150 films, including Insaaf ka tarazu, Aaj ki aawaz and Shaheed Uddham Singh. Babbar, never out of the news for long during his Bollywood days, even had a short-lived marriage with the award-winning Smita Patil, who died soon after giving birth to their son in December 1986. 

 But unlike other stars-turned-politicians, Babbars entry into cinema came after he had had his first taste of politics. I joined the student-led Samajwadi Yuvajan Sabha in 1967, says Babbar, who likes to emphasise his political links. Babbar was with former Prime Minister V.P. Singh, till Mulayam Singh urged him to join his party in the early Eighties. 

 His first wife, theatre activist Nadira, is the daughter of a renowned Marxist, Sajjad Zaheer. Babbar, who did not divorce Nadira and went back to her after Patils death, clearly revels in his Marxist links. Among the first people he met after he went public were CPI(M) leaders Prakash Karat and Sitaram Yechury. 

 Not surprisingly, Babbar is not greatly concerned about his political future. I have friends everywhere, including in the Congress, he says. Babbar also met former defence minister and Samata Party leader George Fernandes after his suspension. 

 Babbar, clearly, is taking one day at a time. Amar Singh still rules the Samajwadi Party, but Babbar is not giving up hope. I am a small man ? I cant change the system, he says. But I can always raise my voice, he says.

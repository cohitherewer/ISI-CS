 Property dispute

 Sir ? The ultimatum served by the government of West Bengal to Purnendu Chatterjee to either buy or sell Haldia Petrochemicals is a prudent move (?Govt buy or sell offer to Purnendu? April 1). This much-hyped project of West Bengal has not lived up to the expectations of the people of the state and stakeholders alike for nearly two decades. And yet, the project has managed to remain in the news, more for the constant bickering among the shareholders than for its achievements. The Haldia experience, in fact, has made the public sceptical of joint venture projects which inevitably end up with the government getting more interested in the politics involved than in the economics, and the private partner always scheming to get the lion?s share of the profits, if any. It is heartening to note that the government has finally decided to look beyond its narrow interests and displayed some fine business sense that is sure to give the project a much-needed push.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? With the government of West Bengal making a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Purnendu Chatterjee, the dispute over Haldia Petrochemicals seems to have come to a head. The government is undoubtedly trying to force a settlement. But it is important to remember that the dispute has reached this stage because both the parties are loath to relinquish their control over a project which has not even taken off. It would be ungrateful to forget that Chatterjee came to invest in the Haldia Petrochemicals at a time when the climate for foreign investment in West Bengal was hardly congenial. It was his endeavour, together with the genuine efforts of the state government, that helped bring up a behemoth like Haldia Petrochemicals. Chatterjee?s reluctance to give up his share of the Petrochems is understandable in this context. But even if he does retain control over the project, can the government guarantee that he will face no hostility from it in the future? The assurance is important for the project has already become symbolic for the industrial resurgence in the state, and will be keenly watched both by the public and the investors.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bus disservice

 Sir ? The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has indeed offered a ?treaty of peace security and friendship? to Pakistan by flagging off the Punj-Aab Express, which will run between Amritsar and Nankhana Sahib, Guru Nanak?s birthplace, in Pakistan (?Omnibus Offer?, March 28). But since the future of not one but two countries is involved in this case, it is important to know how Pakistan reacts to this gesture of peace. Besides, the bus service between India and Pakistan might have a completely negative effect if it ends up providing Pakistani terrorists with an opportunity to intrude with greater ease into India. History shows that Pakistan has hardly ever paid much heed to goodwill moves on the part of India and has tended to view them as a weakness. Given the situation, one cannot help being sceptical about express bus services between India and Pakistan. They will have a far-reaching effect, and not all of them pleasant.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Maitra, Agarpara

 Sir ? The opening of the bus service between Amritsar and Nankhana Sahib will surely help improve relations between India and Pakistan. Manmohan Singh deserves to be congratulated for his peace moves. But there are doubts if a bus route linking two holy places would help restore peace between two nations divided on the basis of religion.

 Yours faithfully,

 Due payment

 Sir ? At the entrance to Kerala while on a visit to pilgrimages in the state from neighbouring Karnataka, I was told by the driver of my hired car that I would have to pay Rs 600 at the Kumbla checkpost. The sum, I was told, included a bribe to the regional transport department. When I accompanied him to the post, despite his protests, I had to flesh out only Rs 260. The inspector and his assistant were both exceedingly courteous. The experience has changed my views on the conduct of both state servants and greedy travel agents.

 Yours faithfully,

U.S. Iyer, Bangalore

 Sir ? After having repaid my car loan to the bank, I was required to get certain formalities done at the motor vehicles department. The legal fees for this is Rs 120, but I was asked to shell out Rs 1,200 to get the work done. I was told that the money was to pay various people to do the necessary job. It is shameful that bribery is so openly solicited and encouraged by taxpayers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sandip Raja, Calcutta

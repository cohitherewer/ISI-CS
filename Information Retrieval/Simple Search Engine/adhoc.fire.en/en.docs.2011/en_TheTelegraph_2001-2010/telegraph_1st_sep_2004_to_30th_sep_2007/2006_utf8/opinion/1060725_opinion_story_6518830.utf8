The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Dangers of a time lag 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The recent poll conducted across 

 the country has given the benefit of doubt to the prime 

 minister, Manmohan Singh. The majority of people questioned 

 are satisfied with him although most would prefer Sonia 

 Gandhi as the prime minister. Clearly those who live in 

 rural India and the smaller urban towns have faith in Sonia 

 Gandhi?s concern and commitment to bettering their lot, 

 in working to build the infrastructure required to put that 

 large, hitherto unattended to, tract of India on par with 

 the rapidly developing urban centres. When the UPA took 

 charge, many of us were confident that the two leaders at 

 the helm of both government and party were the best in the 

 book. They were both committed, honest and honourable. Two 

 years down the road, they remain so and it is rather depressing 

 to see that there is much they could have done that has 

 not happened, and some things they are doing that could 

 be detrimental to a transparent age.

 Disappointment and frustration 

 in the manner of governance, in the initiation of radical 

 economic and social policies, in the neglect of certain 

 key sectors usually starts in the capital where most are 

 in the know of what is happening in government. It then 

 filters to the metropolitan cities, small towns and finally 

 into the vast spaces of rural, neglected India. It takes 

 a minimum time lag of six months for ?India is not shining? 

 to become the war cry in Bharat and India. By then we shall 

 be in the post-budget session phase. Predictably, the rulers 

 and their hangers-on, those who merrily lap up the cream 

 that comes with being close to ?power?, will feed their 

 bosses, with untruths and comments like, ?Have no fear, 

 this is the press and the elite talking and they have no 

 clue.? Such coteries have sabotaged all well-intentioned, 

 honest albeit insecure leaders from time immemorial.

 Poll action

 Coteries are doing the same damage 

 today. A person who is playing the ?bridge? between the 

 prime minister and the Congress president, not necessarily 

 ?officially? through the PMO but extra-constitutionally, 

 is causing confusion. Correct ?instincts? are being manipulated 

 with false and often mischievous interventions to negative 

 ends. Peeved party stalwarts, who would have wanted to occupy 

 certain ?high? posts, are manipulating, conniving and fanning 

 such fires. Therefore, both leaders need to call their bluff 

 and save this country from possible instability in the months 

 ahead. Both need to meet regularly, without aides, confidentially, 

 and with complete honesty. You just have to watch one episode 

 of Yes, Prime Minister to see how bureaucrats and 

 aides manipulate the thinking and policies of political 

 leaders. Therefore, isolate the bureaucrat, instruct him, 

 and if he does not deliver, move him out. Do not be held 

 to ransom because of their devious briefings all at the 

 cost of the nation and change.

 A reshuffle is imperative. We 

 need a minister of external affairs, we need a new and dynamic 

 minister of home affairs, to feel confident that this government 

 will deliver. We need an injection of some younger ministers. 

 Sports, for instance, should be with the new generation 

 in preparation for the Commonwealth Games, as well as a 

 ministry that represents the energetic young, not the tired 

 old. Extensions to retiring bureaucrats are rather unfortunate 

 for a young nation such as ours. The old and infirm in mind, 

 body and soul continue to plague us with their archaic and 

 failed ideas and methodologies that have corrupted and corroded 

 Bharat. It is as sad as a young body with a cancer-ridden 

 brain. 

 Let us hope that the ?High Command? 

 will use the positive result of the poll to shift gears, 

 become proactive regardless of coalition blackmail. Going 

 to the polls this year, pre-budget 2007, will get the Congress 

 more seats. To go later, after the reality check on the 

 ground, the numbers could crash!

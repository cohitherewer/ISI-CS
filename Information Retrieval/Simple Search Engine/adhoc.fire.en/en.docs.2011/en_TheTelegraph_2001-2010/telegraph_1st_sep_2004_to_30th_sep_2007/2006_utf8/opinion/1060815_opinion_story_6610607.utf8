 ANATOMY OF A GREAT LACUNA

 A diplomat with a chronic distaste 

 for briefings is likely to substitute facts with conjecture 

 and hearsay, writes Chandrashekhar Dasgupta.

 Nehru with Patel: who let the Chinese in?

 Jaswant Singh presided over the ministry of external affairs during a critical period in our diplomatic history. In May 1998, India successfully conducted a series of nuclear weapons tests in Pokhran, drawing wrathful condemnation from the established nuclear powers as well as a majority of other states. The challenge confronting our diplomacy was to restore normal relations with other countries as early as possible on the basis of at least a de facto acceptance of Indias new status. Topmost priority had to be accorded to repairing ties with the United States of America, the sole superpower, in view of its vast influence in global affairs. Jaswant Singh rose to the challenge. There were other issues in which his touch was less sure for example, his surrender to the terrorist hijackers at Kandahar but on the whole, he served with distinction as Indias foreign minister. 

 Reading Singhs A Call to Honour, one is struck by a strange dichotomy. On the one hand, it is obvious that the author is highly intelligent and widely read; on the other hand, his historical ruminations are all too frequently marred by factual inaccuracy. His account of India-China relations, for instance, is replete with such errors. Singh believes that the Five Principles (Panchsheel), derived from Buddhist thought, were propounded by India and accepted by China (page 158). In fact, it was China that first proposed the Five Principles. India accepted the principles and baptized them as Panchsheel. The term Panca Sila had been coined by Sukarno several years earlier, as Singh correctly notes, to describe the underlying principles of the Indonesian state, but neither Sukarno nor Zhou Enlai drew their inspiration from Buddhism! 

 The former foreign minister draws a sharp contrast between Indian and Chinese border policies in the early Fifties. China worked ceaselessly to first establish fixed boundaries (page 160), in contrast to Indias relative indifference to borders (page 157). China consolidated its borders, we talked about doing so, and ceaselessly we talked. China took what it needed of Indias territory, particularly in the Aksai Chin, because that was of vital national importance to it (page 160). To drive home his point, Singh quotes at length from Sardar Patels famous letter of November 9, 1950, addressed to Nehru, on the implications for Indias security of Chinas entry into Tibet. 

 What are the facts? In the first place, establishing fixed boundaries was not one of Chinas priorities in the early years of the Peoples Republic. Its first boundary negotiations were held with Burma (now Myanmar), commencing in 1956 and culminating in a treaty in 1960. Boundary negotiations with Nepal began in 1960; with Mongolia and Pakistan in 1962 and with Afghanistan in 1963. The Sino-Soviet boundary negotiations commenced only in 1964. 

 Nor was India indifferent to its borders. After the arrival of Chinese troops in Tibet in 1950, India speeded up plans for extending its administrative presence in the border areas. In parallel with the enhanced administrative presence, armed personnel were inducted and development projects initiated in these regions. Priority was accorded to NEFA (now Arunachal Pradesh) because of the great strategic importance of this sector for India. Singh implies that Patels letter was simply ignored by Nehru (unfortunately, the political leadership at the time did not take kindly to well-argued and cogent reasoning which differed from their own policy preferences). The facts are that Patels letter, together with an Intelligence Bureau assessment, was immediately circulated to all concerned departments and a number of important decisions taken thereon. B.N. Mullik has provided a detailed account of the follow up action in his book, The Chinese Betrayal. 

 Indian and Chinese moves on the ground were not all that dissimilar in the early Fifties: each side moved into the area that it regarded as more important from a strategic viewpoint. There can be no doubt that we made serious mistakes in our border policy but this does not mean that each and every Indian move can be faulted. The errors should be identified more precisely on the basis of a detailed and careful study of the facts.

 According to Singh, China had begun to distance itself from its other great neighbour, the Soviet Union, exactly [when], on account of other global considerations, India sought a closer relationship with the Soviets. This jangled Chinese sensitivities (page 158). In fact, the turnaround in Indo-Soviet relations and the Sino-Soviet split did not occur at the same time. The breakthrough in Indo-Soviet relations came in 1953. The Sino-Soviet split occurred five years later in 1958. Far from jangling Chinese sensitivities, the steady growth of Indo-Soviet ties over these five years had a positive fallout on India-China relations. This was the heyday of Hindi-Chini bhai bhai. It was only after 1958, when Beijings relations with New Delhi started to deteriorate, that Soviet ties with India became a complicating factor in the Sino-Soviet split.

 Singh is no run-of-the-mill politician. He is a former foreign minister who is gifted with the ability to see issues in a broad, historical context. It is precisely this fact that makes his uncertain grasp of our diplomatic history so disturbing. How does one account for this lacuna? It is possible that part of the explanation lies in the rather cavalier approach of the former minister to official briefs. Singh makes no secret of his impatience with briefing sessions. I far preferred collecting my own thoughts than going over lengthy briefing notes, he confesses on page 138. Again, referring to Ambassador Naresh Chandras efforts to brief him on his first visit to Washington as foreign minister, Singh writes, it was only for a little while that I could courteously continue to pay sufficient attention to his briefing. I wanted to be by myself, with my thoughts and not with briefing papers (page 294). This chronic distaste for briefs and briefing sessions may partly explain his tendency to substitute facts with conjecture and hearsay. 

 This personal foible does not, 

 however, provide a full explanation. The historical facts 

 mentioned here should be widely known even outside the corridors 

 of the foreign ministry. If they have escaped the notice 

 of a person as experienced and widely read as Singh, it 

 is because of a national failure to pay sufficient attention 

 to a study of our own diplomatic history. Singh is not unaware 

 of this deficiency. Thus, he writes, I find it tragic and 

 also symptomatic that whereas there do exist military appraisals 

 of developments and events that led to 1962, no corresponding 

 official study focused on the diplomatic or the political 

 is yet available. This is a great lacuna (page 164). It 

 is, indeed, and Singh cannot shrug off responsibility for 

 failing to commission an internal study during his tenure. 

 Quite apart from internal or confidential accounts, however, 

 there is a crying need also for published works covering 

 important aspects of our diplomatic history since 1947. 

 Foreign policy debates should be based on facts, not rumour 

 and conjecture. A nation aspiring to play a major global 

 role cannot afford to ignore current history.

 ambassador to China.

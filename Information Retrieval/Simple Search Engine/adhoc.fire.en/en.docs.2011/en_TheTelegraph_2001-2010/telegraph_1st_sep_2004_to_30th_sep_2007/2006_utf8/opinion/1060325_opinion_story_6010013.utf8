 MORAL CAPITAL

 A gesture of sacrifice repeats itself. The first time as piety; the second time as posturing. Ms Sonia Gandhi?s resignation from the Lok Sabha on Thursday had resonances of her grand act of abnegation when she refused the prime ministership in 2004. But the context of the two acts of renunciation are radically different. In 2004, the post of prime minister was for Ms Gandhi?s asking. Yet she refused to accept the top job of the country. But in 2006, she has resigned as member of parliament when the government of the United Progressive Alliance ? and Ms Gandhi is the chairperson of the UPA ? has made a complete mess in parliament over the office of profit issue. The matter began as a minor political ripple in Uttar Pradesh but has now acquired dimensions that threaten to create a constitutional crisis. This has happened because the government chose to adjourn parliament sine die to pass an ordinance designed to amend the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act so that certain offices of profit can be outside the purview of the act. The ensuing uproar alleged that the adjournment of parliament was aimed at protecting Ms Gandhi. The government, not to put too fine a point on it, had acted in a ham-handed manner. There was ample opportunity to work out an all-party consensus since all parties are affected by the act, and then to present a bill. Instead, the government chose the ordinance route. Only the very simple-minded will believe that Ms Gandhi was not privy to the decision.

 Once the opposition began making the allegation that the entire exercise had no other purpose save the protection of Ms Gandhi, the latter had very few options open to her. By resigning, she did a number of things. First, she took the wind out of the opposition?s sails. Second, she gave her own government a face-saver. And third ? from her own point of view, the most important ? she claimed for herself the moral high ground. But this analysis fails to explain why parliament was adjourned and why Ms Gandhi had to wait for the adjournment and its aftermath before she decided to resign. It is undeniable that these two questions take away a substantial part of the moral charge from Ms Gandhi?s resignation.

 In Indian politics, very few leaders actually offer to renounce positions they hold unless they are compelled to because of defeat in elections, change in government and so on. In that sense, Ms Gandhi?s gesture is an unusual one. While making this gesture, Ms Gandhi has reiterated her claim that she is personally not interested in power and position. While applauding her self-righteousness, it needs to be noted that in politics, Ms Gandhi?s chosen area of operation, a stake in the moral high ground is an investment. What returns Ms Gandhi expects from this investment for her party or for her son, who is in politics, is the most tantalizing question about India?s future.

 REAL CHANGE IS OUT THERE 

 Malvika Singh

 The joy of not having to ?look? at any national daily for a few ?real? and delicious days, those reams of newsprint that fill their front pages with reports of all the unacceptable behaviour and political shenanigans indulged in by leaders who people Parliament House is unceremoniously snatched away as soon as one enters an airport. Then one is compelled to watch inane television news coverage on a large flat screen that now adorn almost all lounges, waiting for the predictably delayed aircraft to take off and return one to the capital of India. There is so much happening in this country that never makes it to the papers or the TV screens ? an India forgotten but clearly moving ahead with energy, with aspiration, with determination, let down by a fading and incompetent administration, a redundant machine that destructs instead of nurturing, and a leadership that manipulates for itself and not for India.

 Small towns are changing rapidly. Clean, simple but adequate places to stay, ?caf?s?, and spruced up dhabas are sprouting all over the place. Village homes are becoming pucca. Public toilets are attached to petrol pumps. But municipalities are polluting the habitat. If that particular arm of government, for a start, is forced to do its job, India would fast become a cleaner and disease-free place. It is there for all to see ? the government has failed this country, betrayed the people and made us into a slow, blundering and corrupt nation. Innocent citizens have been pushed into working against their grain, only because the system is poisonously rusted with corrupt practices, kept alive by those who govern us.

 Pass the baton

 There remain large tracts of this stunning and special country that are untouched by the tardy and imitative extravagances of a moneyed middle India that is uprooted from its tradition in its attempt at ?social mobility?, and uninitiated in comprehending the strengths of its indigenous culture. This large mass of people on the move appear to want to shed the best of this subcontinent and absorb the worst of what the world has discarded. This is where India is falling between two stools, losing its lead and respectability in the world, as it grapples to not decline further.

 Madhya Pradesh, supposedly a ?bimaru? state, has, within its manmade boundaries, some of the most pristine, unspoiled and magical places. Outside the big towns and cities, all of which are falling apart with concerted negligence, the smaller towns and hamlets remain clean, happy and are gradually becoming prosperous. If there had been an intelligent, thoughtful and marginally dynamic political leadership, it would have grabbed the opportunity and set a standard for the future growth of this ?treasure?. India is a skilled, sophisticated and austere country with human resources like no other, where simplicity has always been a virtue, where good sense is intrinsic to living. Over the years, a polluted political space has generated a deadly virus that has invaded the lives of Indians, and has demeaned and diseased us all.

 Alas, they continue to infiltrate our lives, our traditions and our myriad cultures. For India to become a vibrant force, we will have to spawn a new, concerned, caring and literate leadership with an understanding of India and the world, and we will have to purge the administration of all parasites that have become fat and lazy so that Bharat can get what it deserves ? freedom from the overwhelming corruption of mind and spirit. One young and committed ?messiah? could trigger the change ? the aged must pass the baton ? enough is enough ? just those images of national leaders on TV at the airport lounge, gabbling away about their personal irrelevancies, put the diminished political truth into perspective. Change must happen.

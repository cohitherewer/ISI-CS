 CALL OF NATURE

 This above all -Khushwant Singh

 During the hot summer afternoons when hillsides of the Shivaliks bask in sunshine, a call most frequently heard is that of black partridges. It is a raucous cry beginning with a squeek and going on to what sounds to my ears as karach-a-Jack Jack. Bird-watchers have different interpretations. The commonest among local paharis is:

 Lehsen, piyaaz, adrak

 Khuda teyreey Qudrat

 Garlic, onions and ginger

 Are Gods gift to Nature

 It makes good sense to me as it lauds three items which add flavour to food and are good for digestion. Unfortunately, the first two leave an unpleasant odour in the mouth and are therefore disliked by the social elite as well as those who want to make love. Since I do not belong to either category, I relish garlic (lehsen) and onion (piyaaz) and the even smellier heeng (asafoetida) besides ginger (adrak). There are Marwari vegetarians like the Birlas who serve tasty food cooked in shudh (pure) desi ghee but rigorously exclude the four items from their diet.

 Praises of the medicinal qualities of garlic have been sung from time immemorial. My mentor, Ashutosh Tuli, sent me an article by K.A. Josekutty of the Spices Board, Cochin on the legends of garlic. One is about Lord Vishnu slaying a demon who had stolen a clove of garlic from the gods and swallowed it. Its severed head spilt out garlic. So besides its medicinal qualities, garlic acquired demonly tamsik qualities of foul smell and lust. 

 There are many other fables about garlic in Greek, Roman and Egyptian mythology mostly built around garlics ability to ward off evil and cure diseases, including high cholesterol, kidney stones. One that sums up good and bad points of garlic runs as follows: In order to control his cholesterol level, a middle-aged man used to consume garlic milk daily in the night. Days gone by his cholesterol level started decreasing. However, it adds, his beloved wife wasnt too pleased about what it did to her love life.

 There is a reason behind my entitling this piece, Call of Nature. Indians use the expression to suggest the evacuation of bowels (oddly enough never so used by the English). I did so deliberately because garlic does, in fact, help in keeping my bowels clean.

 Adding spice to life

Paper chase

 Everyone who has read, or tried to read, Asadullah Khan Ghalibs works (1769-1809) should be familiar with the first couplet of his Diwan which runs as follows:

 Nagsh faryaadi hai kis kee shokhee-e-tehreer ka

 Kaaghzi hai pairahan har paikar-e-tasveer ka.

 Most translators, including T.N. Raaz of Panchkula, allude to an alleged custom followed in the courts of the Shahs of Iran of petitioners having to wear paper robes (kaaghazi pairahan) when they presented petitions asking for favours from the ruler. I wrote to Ralph Russel, Professor Emeritus of the London School of Oriental and African Studies, regarded as the greatest authority on Ghalib, and a few others, but got no satisfactory answers to my question. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that the couplet had nothing whatsoever to do with the ancient Iranian custom and simply meant that a painting or a masterpiece of art speaks for itself and should not rely on an art connoisseurs explanation. I venture to give my own version: 

 A painting speaks for itself,

 No learned exposition to whom does it plead

 Paper on which it is painted is its outer garment

 Everyone of them tells its own story indeed.

 Satyam, Shivam, Sundaram

 Some weeks ago, I had asked readers to enlighten me about the genesis of these three words being put in the order they are now. Though all three appear in our sacred texts, they appear separately. I was flooded with learned comments by scholars explaining what they meant everyone knows what they mean and where they were to be found in the Vedas. Only two readers threw some light on the subject. Biresh Kumar of Birpur, Begusarai (Bihar) gives a direct answer to my question. He writes: These words, in fact, are a translation of I.A. Richards terminology: The True, the Good and the Beautiful. But who was I. A. Richard and when did he write these words? I wish Bireshwar Kumar or someone else would further enlighten our readers. 

 The other was Professor Darshal Singh of Hoshiarpur (Punjab). He maintains it was an Aristoelian concept taken on by German scholars and later translated into Sanskrit by Guru Debendranath Tagore. He does not give his sources for saying so, and I am no wiser than I was before.

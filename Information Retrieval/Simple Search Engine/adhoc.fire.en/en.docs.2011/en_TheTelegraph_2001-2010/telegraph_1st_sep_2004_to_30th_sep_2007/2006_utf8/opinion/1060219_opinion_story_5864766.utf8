 CHAPEL FOR THE YOUNG

 Age is an opiate to sporting activities. Sportsmen who try to defy biology inevitably end up making themselves look ridiculous. This is one reason why the timing of a sportsman?s retirement is as important as his successes. In a country like India, with a long tradition of reverence and respect for age, seniority continues to get respect even in the sporting arena. In the world of cricket, Greg Chappell is trying to break out of such hidebound ideas. As soon as he took over as the coach of the Indian cricket team, he made it clear that he would respect only one thing in a cricketer and that was performance. He knew that in modern cricket ? a distinct genre from the leisurely amateur game of yore ? performance could only come from the young. He set himself the target of building an Indian team which would not win a consolation prize for participating in the 2007 World Cup. The privileging of youth and performance did not provide a smooth passage for Chappell. His first obstacle was a useless controversy over Sourav Ganguly. It was assumed that he had something perso- nal against Ganguly when the only point the coach wanted to make was that seniority without performance was of no relevance to him.

 Chappell?s emphasis on youth is already showing results. Against Pakistan, in the one-day internationals, at crucial times, the younger players of the squad have performed to win matches and the series. The energy of youth has been more noticeable in those aspects of the game which do not register on the scoreboard but never escape the eyes of a good coach or a connoisseur of the game: fielding, running between the wickets, and a general sense of buoyancy and aggression. Both catching and giving chase have improved beyond recognition; every player is more keen on the field. The younger players are running faster between the wickets, and therefore the taking of singles ? so crucial to keep the run-rate going and the rotation of the strike ? looks easier and less hazard-prone. All these are functions of a higher level of fitness, which can be attained only by the youth and not by those above thirty ? when, in sporting terms, the body begins to age, and stamina and fitness start to flag.

 It is evident that Chappell is working according to a well-thought-out plan. He knows that the real stars of the present side ? Rahul Dravid, Virendra Sehwag and most importantly, Sachin Tendulkar ? will be on a downward sloping curve in 2007 so far as fitness and even performance are concerned. This is the time to think of the future stars and to seed new talent. M.S. Dhoni, Yuvraj Singh and Irfan Pathan are the new stars, but others have to be discovered if India is to be a competitor in the next World Cup. Chappell needs support, and not carping criticism from those who put vested interest above cricket.

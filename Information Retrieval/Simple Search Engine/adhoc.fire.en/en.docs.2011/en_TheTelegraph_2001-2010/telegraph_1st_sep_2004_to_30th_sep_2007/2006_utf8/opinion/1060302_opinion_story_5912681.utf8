The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TACTLESS

 It is in the nature of so-called class struggles to degenerate into senseless violence. That is pretty much the history of Maoist movements ? in Telengana, Naxalbari, Jehanabad or any other part of India. Tuesday?s Maoist strike in Chhattisgarh is yet another proof of the rebellion?s ideological degeneration. Although it might be tempting to do so, it could be wrong to see it as evidence of the rebels? growing strength. Unlike most other rebel strikes, when policemen had been the victims, this one had common people as targets. The important thing is that these people were targeted because they had dared to organize themselves against the Maoist violence. It was thus an offensive that felled no class enemies or even their collaborators. Obviously, the Maoists killed those whom they had failed to win over with their political argument. Also, this act of revenge stems from a fear of a popular rejection of the rebels? cause. Such popular resistance to the Maoists has been a new phenomenon in several other states. 

 However, the courage of conviction is not the best defence against armed bands. The people?s revolt against the Maoists has amoral force that needs to be supported by the state. The problem is that the state has been failing to play its part in fighting the rebels. In Chhattisgarh, several rebel offensives over the past few months have exposed the state?s inability to deal with the challenge. Grinding poverty and the state?s failure to reach even the basic economic needs to the poor help the rebels? designs. Governments at the Centre and the states routinely promise to tackle the socio-economic problems in these areas. But the feudal social structure renders the state?s intervention largely ineffective. This is the larger battle, but the state cannot win it only with force.

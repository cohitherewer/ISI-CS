 PEOPLE POWER

 Historically, the English Revolution of 1640 decided the outcomes of all future conflicts between kings and their people. It showed that kings had little choice but to give in to the people?s will if they wanted to save not only their monarchies but also their heads. Nepal?s King Gyanendra must be suffering from exceptional delusions if he thinks he can overturn the tide of history. Closer home, he has the examples of the births of the three republics of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. India and Pakistan were born of the people?s rejection of imperial rule. In Bangladesh, the people overthrew what they perceived to be a foreign rule. The lesson in all these, as in the English example, is that kings and emperors are today anachronisms that are best discarded. King Gyanendra?s acts since he ascended the throne prove how dangerous it is to leave the affairs of a state to an over ambitious king. Here is a king who not only wants to rule against the wishes of his people but also makes a mockery of the spirit of the constitution. The monarchy under him emerged as the worst force of destabilization in his country. His offers for restoration of democracy are half-measures at best; they even look suspiciously like a tactical retreat. 

 It is important for Nepal?s pro-democracy agitators not to miss this opportunity to rewrite the country?s history. They have to match the king?s moves ? measure for measure. They must tell the king in no uncertain terms that his game is up. Whatever steps they take in response to the king?s offers have to be dictated by their own agenda. If the king has been forced to revive the parliament he had dissolved in an autocratic manner in 2002, the parties must take it as an opportunity to decide what to with it now. The seven-party alliance needs to take the Maoists into confidence in deciding how to prevent the king from usurping parliament?s powers in future. The best course for them would be to set the stage for elections to a constituent assembly in order to draft a new constitution. They cannot afford to repeat the mistake of 1990, when pro-democracy agitators won another battle against the monarchy but overlooked a provision in the constitution that gave the king emergency powers. A new constitution this time has to wipe out that danger once and for all. In fact, the popular will clearly is in favour of the abolition of the institution of monarchy.

 The international community, including India, should have no problem with the demise of the monarchy. If that means an acceptance of the Maoist demand for a republic in Nepal, the people seem to have unequivocally endorsed it. More important, the end of the monarchy should bring the rebels into the democratic polity. A stable, republican Nepal, rather than a destabilizing monarchy, should be in India?s ? and every other country?s ? interest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TINY STRIPS WITH A VARIED FALLOUT 

Sabyasachi Mukherjee (designer):

Q: Do you think the bikini is an imaginative 

costume?

 A: I think that it is an imaginative 

costume insomuch as it does not leave anything to the imagination. 

Q: Does it represent culture-specific notions 

of beauty and sexiness?

A: As a bathing suit, it is almost a mainstream 

subculture in the West. In India, it is a taboo garment. It is viewed as a sexual 

garment in India because nudity is taboo. It is seen as too aggressive and is 

therefore widely used to portray upbeat sexuality. 

Q: But the bikini now features in beauty 

pageants and even on the ramp. Don?t you think the attitude has changed?

A: To a certain extent it has changed; our 

awareness is greater. But the bikini still scandalizes. 

Q: How would you rate the bikini as beachwear, 

swimwear, rampwear and sportswear?

 A: Beachwear: 9.5 because it 

is a perfect tanning outfit. 

Swimwear: 4.5-5.5. I don?t think it is stable because 

of the nature of its fastenings.

Rampwear: Negative, because it is singularly responsible 

for sensationalism.

Sportswear: Completely zero except for modified bikinis 

as running costumes or two- piece garments. But it is still impractical. 

 Jesse Randhawa (model): 

Q: Is it essential to walk the ramp in 

a bikini?

A: I don?t think so. A model can well do with 

a sari or a salwar. The job is to showcase any clothing. 

Q: Have you worn a bikini on the ramp? 

A: I wore a bikini once in a show in India 

and the experience left me with a bad taste in the mouth. 

Q: Why?

 A: Well, it has to do with how 

Indian men perceive the bikini ? they tend to look at it in a sexual way. If Indian 

men were a little more settled, I wouldn?t have a problem. I have done shows abroad, 

in London for instance, and I?ve never had a problem with it.

Q: So are men abroad ?a little more settled? 

than here?

A: Yes, definitely.

Q: Do you think the bikini makes a statement, 

say, about women?s empowerment? 

 A: I associate the bikini with 

comfort. When I think of the bikini I think Goa rather than women?s empowerment. 

It?s less about making a statement and more about getting a good tan.

Atul Kasbekar (photographer):

Q: How challenging is it to photograph a 

woman in a bikini?

 A: The challenge really...is 

to stay clearly on the sensuous side of the fence. If one were to draw a line 

between sensuous and vulgar, then I have no doubt that my intention is to stay 

with the former.

Q: If you were to photograph a woman in 

a bikini so that the image alludes to Bikini Atoll, how would you compose your 

shot?

A: Tough question! You pay me a bomb and I 

will tell you.

 AN UNENVIABLE RECORD

 This Above All

 Rebuilding life

 The bomb blasts in over-crowded commuter trains, which leave Mumbai?s Churchgate station every few minutes to take thousands of working men and women back to their homes every evening, took a heavy toll on lives (over 200 dead and over 400 injured) on July 11. They reminded me of other bloody events in our history since independence: Bapu Gandhi?s murder (January 30, 1948), Operation Blue Star (June 6, 1984), in which well over a thousand innocent men, women and children were killed in the exchange of fire between Bhindranwale?s goons and the army; Mrs Gandhi?s assassination (October 31, 1984), followed by a massacre of about 10,000 Sikhs across northern India; murder of Rajiv Gandhi (May 21, 1991) by Tamil Tigers; demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya (December 6, 1992), followed by killings of Muslims in Bombay and parts of Maharashtra; series of bomb blasts in Bombay (March 12, 1993) taking hundreds of lives from all communities; the burning of a train compartment at Godhra railway station, followed by killings of innocent Muslims (toll of over 2,000) in Gujarat. When things began to settle down came the explosions in commuter trains, which killed people without distinction of religion, caste, creed or gender. Who did it and why, we are still not sure.

 It is a bloody record for a nation which likes to call itself peace-loving. We killed the founding father of our nation, two prime ministers and many thousands of others in 58 years. Let us face the ugly reality. Far from being peace-loving, we are quick to lose our temper and pass judgments based on hearsay, and are prone to violence. We continue to harbour religious prejudices and are willing to commit the most diabolical of crimes in defence of what we believe to be right, which in fact is wrong and evil.

 Not only do we have to learn to control our tempers, not to come to hasty conclusions and seek revenge, we also have to defeat the designs of evil-doers by defeating their attempts to sow seeds of discord between communities. Never, never equate criminal outfits like the Lashkar-e-Toiba with Muslims.

 Fist and fury

 I hear of the searing heat in the plains with temperatures rising above 45 degrees Celsius and feel privileged sitting under the cool shade of a massive Toon tree and taking in the pine-scented air of the Shivalik hills. ?Miserable plain-dwellers?, I tell them in my mind, ?come up to the hills?. Here, when it gets too warm, all I do is change into shorts and a T-shirt and let nature?s cooling system do the rest. In Delhi, I heard the koyel call only twice before I left. In Kasuli, I hear it first thing before sunrise and it continues screaming all day long till sunset. The koyel?s preference for mango trees is a myth perpetuated by legends and songs: ?Ambua hee daaree pe koel boley, ?kuhoo, kuhoo? ? . It is a shy bird and looks for trees with thick foliage to avoid being seen, but calls to make its presence known. We have no mango trees up here but plenty of thick- foliaged trees like horse-chestnuts or my own Toon, and koyels kuhoo away all day long. Many a time I?ve noticed it only after hill crows chase it away during their nesting time.

 One day, it was stiller than before. Usually, a wind picks up in the afternoon. Not that day. The sky azure blue, I sat watching white-cheeked bulbuls and mynahs sporting in the bird bath I have put in my garden. They were fluffing out their wings and chirping away vigorously till the sun went down behind the line of trees and a full moon emerged to lighten the darkening skies. A blissful end to a gorgeous day. I retired for the night, hoping the days to come could be like the one just ended.

 At midnight, I was shaken out of my slumber by a clap of thunder. It was followed by flashes of lightening. My bedroom windows were slapped shut, re-opened and violently shut again by gusts of wind. Branches of the pine trees came crashing down on the corrugated tin roof. Then came hail and rain; it sounded like an army of malefactors throwing stones on my roof. I got up to see what was going on. As I expected, electric lines had been felled by trees falling on them. I groped around the room with the torch I keep by my bedside. I put on my sweater and went back to bed, this time under the razaaee. I could not sleep because of the peels of thunder and lightening and the bombardment on the roof. It seemed like apocalypse ? the end of the world. I have never experienced the wrath of nature of this magnitude ever before.

 It is a miracle: we survived the ordeal. Peace and silence returned. After a while so did the moonlight and then came the dawn. I stepped out to see the havoc caused by the storm. The roof and the garden were strewn with pine needles, dried twigs and branches. It took the bijliwalas two days and nights to restore electric power. Perishable items in the fridge rotted and had to be thrown away. The geyser did not work; so there was no hot water for a bath. I had to light candles to take the sundowner and my supper. No doubt romantic. In this mini-paradise in the Shivaliks one can find houris and wine but never rely on the weather.

 Stop twinkling, little star

 You have twinkled enough, o little star

 Your hour has come now to pack up and go

 Our own sun has risen already, and so.

 All western light from the eyes of mother India

 We must pull out and in the ocean throw.

 And you Baa Baa Black Sheep

 You are not a sheep but a vulture,

 A wolf in sheep?s clothing, who?ll eat up

 Our centuries old solid culture

 You damned un-Indian

 You must never our (sic) children.

 And, then, we have enough of black sheep already.

 And how about you, Chacha Nehru

 Who has done more harm to our country than you?

 And don?t feel discriminated against

 When the time comes, we?ll throw out Gandhi too

 From our school books, because 

 A new dawn has broken upon our nation

 And we are producing new men and

 women and brand new children.

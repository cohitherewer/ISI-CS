 Letters to Editor

 Matter of shame

 Sir ? Every once in a while, incidents like the blackening of the face of a Mumbai professor happen, putting a black mark against the image of the student community of India (?Prof paraded with black face?, July 1). In the recent incident, activists belonging to the National Students Union of India waited for over a year to turn into saviours of women. Quite obviously, they were merely looking for an excuse to assault the professor. There are bad teachers just as there are bad politicians, lawyers, doctors and so on. But the students who act as self-proclaimed well-wishers of their fellow-students are usually interested in nothing more than earning the favour of their political bosses. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is difficult to find words to express indignation at the disgraceful action of the members of the Congress-affiliated NSUI, who paraded one of their professors at Wilson College, Mumbai with blackened face and a garland of slippers for his alleged misconduct with a girl student a year ago. The senior and respected professor of biology was only two months from his retirement. 

 One wonders how long the administration and the ?responsible? political parties will continue to support the misbehaviour of their student wings. From the reports it is evident that the professor was made the target of attack because the college authorities had rejected the union?s unjustified demands regarding admission to the college. The perpetrators of the atrocity should not only be expelled forthwith, but also disowned by the party if it abides by any moral values. Our elders still recall with fondness and awe their interactions with their teachers. How is it that not an iota of this reverence has managed to travel down the generations?

 Finally, newspapers should have taken a stand and desisted from printing the blackened face of the unfortunate professor, a victim of the unruly representatives of an anarchic society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is sad that teachers are today subjected to humiliation by their students, particularly since India happens to be a country where the teacher or the guru has been revered down the ages. The action of the NSUI must be condemned in the strongest possible way. If the students wanted to air their grievance against the professor, there were several civilized ways of doing it. One obvious way would have been to inform the police and let them handle the situation. It is good that the college authorities have sided with the assaulted professor, and reading the reports, one is more inclined to believe the testimony of the administration. Even if they had a valid cause, the NSUI activists had no business taking the law into their hands. They deserve stern punishment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bhismalochan Sharma, Aurangabad

 Sir ? The act of Congress-affiliated students in Mumbai is disgraceful. Whatever may be the allegation against the professor, students (or anyone else for that matter) had no right to violate the human rights of an individual who also happened to be their professor. These students seem to have taken a leaf out of the culture of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. It appears that the anarchy which Bengalis are familiar with under CPI(M) rule, is spreading to other parts of India, given that the country is now ruled by a left-backed United Progressive Alliance government. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Kumar Pal, London

 Sir ? It seems that Vilas Athavale, the biology professor of Mumbai?s Wilson College is the victim of a dirty trick played by his student who alleged that he had molested her a year ago (??Other college? link to parade?, July 2). Why was she silent all this time? The police must make the girl take a lie-detector test. If found guilty, she should be given exemplary punishment along with those who have paraded Athavale after blackening his face. If they are let off now, teachers of other institutions could also come in for similar treatment if they mark students badly or fail them in examinations. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The alleged molestation of a student at Mumbai?s Wilson College by a professor and the subsequent parading of the latter gives a bad name to higher studies in India. The fact that NSUI activists barged into the college may support the claim made by the vice principal that the union was exacting revenge for the authorities? refusal to grant its candidates admission. Unless the state government intervenes and conducts an impartial investigation, such politically-charged incidents would rise in educational institutions.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 Gender bender

 Sir ? The claim of the ?linguist?, Andrew Dalby, that Homer could have been a ?she? (?Homer may be woman: Study? (July 2), must have been provoked by a desire to become famous. It is easiest to make an absurd claim and enjoy the turmoil it causes. Dalby?s argument that women can narrate stories with a greater depth and sympathy ? as apparent in the Iliad ? is too simplistic and na?ve to be convinced by. Without going into gender theories, it can be said that the text as a means of interpreting the psyche of authors is no longer a reliable tool. One can ask Dalby, given the sensitivity with which Shakespeare portrayed the characters of Lady Macbeth or Desdemona, whether the bard too was a woman. Or shall we leave the issue to another literary stuntman?

 Yours faithfully,

Rudrashis Datta, Howrah

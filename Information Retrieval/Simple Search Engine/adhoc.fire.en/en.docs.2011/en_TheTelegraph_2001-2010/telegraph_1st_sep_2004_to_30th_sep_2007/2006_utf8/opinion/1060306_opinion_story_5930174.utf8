 EXIT POLLS

 Strength and straightforwardness are usually rewarded with brickbats. Mr K.J. Rao, the election official who has not endeared himself to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal by his determined effort to rid the electoral rolls of false names, has been called many names by various affronted parties during his career. But his sudden resignation, just before the assembly election process in West Bengal gets going, has nothing but ?personal reasons? behind it. Mr Rao?s remarkable successes in the very different poll scenes in Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar had led those unhappy with the CPI(M) domination in West Bengal to hope for some fairness in the assembly elections. His focussed and efficient management of checking complaints from every party about false names on the voters? lists had fanned the glimmers of such hope into shy flames. It is disappointing that he should resign now, although it is not fair to burden upright and committed persons with more work than they wish to do.

 Conspiracy theories are all very well, but they are unlikely to help in this case. The Election Commission has been firm about the phasing of elections in Bengal on Mr Rao?s advice; people might feel somewhat reassured at the possibility of fair polls because of that. Mr Rao?s wish that the electoral rolls be published after the clean-up is finalized ? the EC weeded out 13 lakh false names ? may not have been satisfactorily fulfilled, but speculation is useless. Although Mr Sitaram Yechuri is still fulminating against the EC for insisting on phased polls, Mr Anil Biswas, the state CPI(M) general secretary, can barely hide his relief at Mr Rao?s decision. He has gone to the lengths of calling Mr Rao a ?nice, good person? in a dramatically different key from the series of remarks against the election official so far. Many in Bengal are unhappy to see Mr Rao go. At the same time, relying on an institution to do its job is better than relying on an individual alone.

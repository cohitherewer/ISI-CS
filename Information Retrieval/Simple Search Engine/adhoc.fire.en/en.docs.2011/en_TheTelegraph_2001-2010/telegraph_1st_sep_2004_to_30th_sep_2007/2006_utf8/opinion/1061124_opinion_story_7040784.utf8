 THE INDIAN MUTINY AND THE BRITISH IMAGINATION 

 By Gautam Chakravarty, Cambridge, Rs 495

 1857 was a turning point in both British imperial and Indian histories. For both the colonized and the colonizers, the world was turned upside down. British authority temporarily disappeared over a wide swath of north and central India when the brown sepoys turned their muskets on their white masters. Time seemed to stand still as the Company state disintegrated and a rebel regime emerged. The British had to spend a lot of blood and money for re-establishing colonial authority over Hindustan.

 From archival documents it is evident that the 1857 uprising continued to have a lasting effect on imperial policy till 1947. The British were always aware of the possibility of a rebellion among the Indian subjects. 1857 had a lasting effect not only on the colonial apparatus but also on British popular fiction. And the latter influence is the subject of Gautam Chakravartys monograph under review.

 Instead of depending on literary methodologies, Chakravarty locates the fiction written on 1857 within the wider imperial policy declarations and the historical literature triggered by the colonial officers. In the 19th century, both the imperial policy statements as well as the autobiographies of colonial officials pushed the agenda of the civilizing mission of the raj, concerning the racial supremacy of the sahibs over the natives. And these assumptions were also reflected in the British fictional literature on the mutiny written between 1859 and 1947. 

 Interestingly, colonial historians like John Kaye, G. B. Malleson and the authors of mutiny fiction overlooked the technological superiority enjoyed by the British. Instead, the rebel defeat is explained by British pluck. This was partly because most of the mutiny novels aimed at a juvenile readership that saw the event as a heroic imperial adventure occasionally interspersed with romantic plots. An example of this sort of novel is A Hero of Lucknow (1905) by F. S. Brereton. Chakravarty asserts that character-building of the British youngster, needed to sustain the empire, seemed to be the objective of such novels.

 Like the travel literature produced in Victorian Britain, the mutiny novels portray India as a land of exotica. The Indian kings and nawabs were painted as degenerate oriental despots. The ideology of Social Darwinism and the rise of pseudo-biological race theories in the late 19th century resulted in racial anthropology. This in turn generated the martial race discourse among colonial bureaucrats. In accordance with the martial race theory, Hindus were regarded as feminine. And the symbol of the feminine Hindu, India, subordinated to muscular Christianity, occurs repeatedly in these novels. The paternalistic idiom of the relationship between British officers and childlike sepoys, who were led astray by a few devious natives, was common to both the autobiographies of British officers and adventure novels like The Disputed VC: A Story of the Indian Mutiny (1909) by Frederick A. Gibbon.

 Chakravarty should be credited for portraying the interactions between colonial history, the cultural assumptions of the British ruling class and the fictional literature on 1857. In fact, his book shows that there was no clear distinction between the colonial historians and the metropolitan fiction writers. The valorization of British gentlemen officers, a hagiography of the empire and the myth of the civilizing mission were common concerns for both.

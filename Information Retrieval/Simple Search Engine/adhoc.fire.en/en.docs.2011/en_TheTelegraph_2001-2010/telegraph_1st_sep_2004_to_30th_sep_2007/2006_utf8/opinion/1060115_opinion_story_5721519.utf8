The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Party time may be over for the BJP, and the antics of the party-poopers may be just beginning to fade from memory, but new nuggets from Mumbai continues to surface. One of them is about Pramod Mahajan?s new-found love for the dhoti. If the devotee of the churidar-kurta was suddenly spotted wearing a dhoti at the party?s silver jubilee celebrations in Mumbai, then one can?t blame the rumour mills for springing into action. Apparently, this was Mahajan?s ploy of getting close to the sangh elders while keeping in mind the august tradition of BJP presidents being clad either in the dhoti or the lungi/ mundu. But Mahajan has lost his subtle touch perhaps. For, last heard, the old men of the RSS were still having a good laugh over how the young chap tried to impress them with his designer dhoti.

 It would be quite wrong to say that when Pranab Mukherjee played the honorary censor board chief recently, he let the Aamir Khan-starrer, Rang De Basanti, pass without any objections. As a matter of fact, he suggested as many as four cuts. Of the four, the most important one ? and one which Khan was rather resistant to ? was of the scroll that runs at the end of the film, listing the names of all the pilots who have died in MiG accidents over the years. The defence minister?s ? and that of the service chiefs ? logic was that the list would have a demoralizing effect on the military personnel who would go to watch the film. Not wanting to disturb the scheduled release of the film, the producers and director gave in without a fight. As they did to the other changes suggested by Pranabda. Which is probably why we never got to hear of them.

 While no one is surprised when ministers and MPs ? in other words, the executive and the legislature ? throw mud at one another, the judiciary has still managed to retain its reputation as a fiercely self-protective lot. Contempt of court is slapped on anyone who dares to accuse the judiciary of any kind of wrongdoing. Naturally, it was surprising to find lawyers from the lower courts of the capital take to the streets against the shifting of cases from Tis Hazari to the new court complex in Rohini. In the course of the protest, they had some serious allegations against two Delhi high court judges and even a senior Supreme Court judge ? ranging from favours taken from politicians to land scams. Can we hear another bastion crumbling?

 The saga of the dhoti is not over yet. Pramod Mahajan may not be desi enough for the sangh?s liking, no matter how niftily he carried his dhoti, but Rajnath Singh, the new party president, is as indigenous as desi ghee. Every swish of his dhoti speaks of his rustic roots. But wait a second. Did you know that his not-so-desi lifestyle is thanks to his daughter, who happens to live in New Jersey? And she put in a surprise visit to join in the family happiness and celebrate in the true ?made-in-the-US? way.

 Talk of activist-politicians, and one of the first names that pops up is Jaya Jaitley, without whom India?s artisans and craftsmen, and their art and craft, would certainly have died a painful death. Now, of course, they thrive merrily in Dilli Haat. What a strange thing that Jaitley should lose her purse in Dilli Haat, of all places! But being a woman of influence, she soon mobilized the Sarojini Nagar police ? who found the thief with Jaitley?s purse even before a complaint could be lodged. On another occasion, however, Fatima Mir, an African guest who was in Delhi to attend the Indo-Africa khadi workshop hosted by none other than Jaitley, faced a far less cooperative police at the Sarojini Nagar police station. She had just lost her passport and other important documents, again at Dilli Haat. But the police refused to let her lodge a complaint, and the host to exert her influence. Finally, some friends helped, but the taste of India and Delhi and the handloom activism in India had already become very bitter for Mir.

 The dust has settled on the issue of illegal occupation of government bungalows. And the illegal occupants have finally breathed a sigh of relief. One chief minister continues to lord over the bungalow allotted to him years ago when he was a Union minister. But he pays rent for the bungalow at the market rate. However, others, including journalists, continue to live and put the houses to a number of uses, so what if they have forfeited the right to do so long ago.

 Is it the mother, or the son? If reports are to be believed, Sonia Gandhi is quite keen to have Rahul in the CWC, but her son is not as eager to handle so much responsibility this early in his political career. So madam had to give up and fall back on the wisdom of Ahmad Patel, a fact many Congressmen are known not to enjoy. And so, eyebrows went up when Hari Prasad, a Rajya Sabha MP from Karnataka, was elevated from secretary to general-secretary. Barring Jyotiraditya Scindia and a couple of others, no generational change is visible. But this is not the end of reshuffles. Manmohan Singh will reorganize his cabinet after the party?s plenary session in Hyderabad from January 21. Party and cabinet leaders will be tossed around till the combination that pleases the maximum leaders is found. But who will go where? What will happen? According to a CWC member, ?Kuchh to zaroor hoga. Kuchh log yahaan ayenge, aur kuchh wahan jayenge?. Now have we heard something so profound before?

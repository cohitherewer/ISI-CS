 AN ISSUE IS NOT A PROBLEM

STEPHEN HUGH-JONES 

 Has Britain?s down to pandemic reached India? Do you too have an issues issue? And if you object to these novelties of language, might your reaction be thought inappropriate? 

 The words in italics are the most misused in today?s British English. 

 There was once ? indeed, still is ? a genuine use of down to, derived, one is told, from some 18th-century golden age when pub-keepers gave credit, and would write down drinkers? debts on the pub slate: ?Another jeroboam of claret, landlord, put it down to Mr Fox.? From this grew wider uses: if you lose ?50 to a conman, friends may console you, ?It could have been ?500, put it down to experience?. But now down to has grown wings. 

 On one side it is taking the place of due to. If young Tracy in systems has got pregnant, that may be down to Kevin in accounts. Or maybe it?s down to her own stupidity. The takeover isn?t complete: I?ve yet to hear ?Down to a technical fault, boarding is delayed until 3 am.? But that?ll come. 

 On the other side, down to is replacing up to. ?Car or train? It?s up to you,? we might say. This is often now down to you. 

 As for issue, because it can mean problem, it is becoming a full-time substitute for that and similar words. These are issues we have to address; fine. But what about Jack has issues running the post-room? Or ? and this I didn?t invent ? It is hard to communicate with old people, especially when deafness is an issue. Balderdash. You may have umpteen issues to discuss with deaf old Mr Jones, but his deafness is seldom one. It is a fact of life, a handicap, a difficulty or indeed a pain in the neck, but an issue, in that context, no. 

 I look forward to some astronaut?s Houston, we have an issue. An issue of what? Escaping hydrogen? Navy rum? 

 Last and worst is inappropriate, today?s weasel adjective for anything the world disapproves of. It may merely mean some fool has objected; it may be a euphemism for unwise, damned silly, utterly irresponsible or even (the word still exists) plain wicked. The swimming coach who gropes his pubescent female trainees is these days accused of inappropriate touching. Forty-odd years ago, a British junior defence minister had to resign because of his liaison with a call-girl who (allegedly) shared her favours with a military attache at the Russian embassy. Nowadays, if such a minister were caught on peak-hour television in bed with a couple of rent-boys actually supplied by that embassy, and all three high on cocaine making racist comments on a snuff movie, he?d probably issue a statement regretting his inappropriate behaviour. 

 Yet can one really object? Isn?t this just language changing, as it always has and always will? I?d reluctantly admit that with down to: I dislike its new uses, but if enough people use it that way, I can?t for ever say they?re wrong. But the other two cases are more than that. 

 Sure, they are changes of language, but they?re also examples of misleading imprecision, of using the fluff word when precise ones are available. When there really is a problem, why not call it one, instead of the vapid issue? It is not by accident that British ministers these days habitually say some issues have come up when the truth is that their department is a total shambles. Nor is the swimming coach?s groping just inappropriate; it?s a gross abuse of trust. 

 Yet, is it really down to your wordcager to object? Is it not inappropriate (as in arrogant, stupid, pointless...) for him to question the authority of the British people over their own language? Well, if he were questioning the notorious probity and competence of British or any other ministers, it might indeed be inappropriate (ill-timed, tactless, embarrassing, true... ). But language is this column?s job. Still, if you insist, OK, so be it. No issue.

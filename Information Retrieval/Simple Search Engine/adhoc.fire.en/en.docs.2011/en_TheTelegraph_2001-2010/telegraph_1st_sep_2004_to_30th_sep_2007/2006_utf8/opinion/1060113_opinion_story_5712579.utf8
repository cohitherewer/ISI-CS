 LETTING GO

 What does it really mean for Indian institutions of higher education to be ?autonomous?? It is a word that figures promisingly on the agenda of modern governments eager to minimalize the machinery of state. Yet, in actual and practical terms, deeply entrenched insecurities and double standards in the political system are laid bare in the granting of such a status. Most of the Indian institutes of technology and of management have never failed to prove to the country, and to the world, their robust capacity for generating both merit and money without much help from the state. Yet it has been these very institutions that have had to face, quite persistently, the discomfort of governments with their increasingly justified claims to autonomy. And a change of regime seems not to have made much of a difference. Mr Arjun Singh?s ministry of human resource development has vetoed IIM Bangalore?s opening of a campus in Singapore. The invitation to do so had come from the Singapore government; but the Indian government thinks that until the IIM has met its ?internal demands?, it should not be looking across the seas to expand.

 The HRD ministry?s heavy-handedness would be far from unfamiliar to the IIMs. Mr Murli Manohar Joshi?s ministry in the previous regime had kept up a degree of meddlesomeness in the administrative, fiscal and academic matters of these institutions that had helped them, quite paradoxically, to affirm their own understanding of what it really meant to be autonomous. The ?internal demand? argument put forward by Mr Singh?s ministry is unacceptable on two counts. First, if meeting these ?demands? means increasing the number of students being admitted each year, then that is hardly a way of securing and enhancing academic excellence. Second, these demands, by the ministry?s own admission, are internal, and should therefore be monitored and assessed by the institution itself, and not externally controlled. Surely, that is what being autonomous ought to imply. A knee-jerk unwillingness to relinquish control is a form of paternalism that the Indian state should make a concerted attempt to outgrow. The IITs and IIMs are powerful and esteemed institutions of excellence. Regressive and obstructive political and bureaucratic habits of thought and action should not come in the way of their self-determined growth.

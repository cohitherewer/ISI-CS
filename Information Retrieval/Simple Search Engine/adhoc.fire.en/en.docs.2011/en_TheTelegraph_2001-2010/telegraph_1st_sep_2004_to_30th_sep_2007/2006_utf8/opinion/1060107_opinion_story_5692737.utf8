 Out and About

 You would have thought that with so many years in the industry, the Shahenshah of Bollywood would have a ear for what makes the audience dance to his tunes. But, as Amitabh Bachchan admitted in an interview on TV recently, the first time he heard the Kajra re number from Bunty aur Babli, he thought it sucked. Its another matter that the song went on to become one of the biggest chartbusters of 2005 ? despite Bachchans worst nightmares. And its being proven true in foreign markets as well. The song has been voted the best among last years Hindi numbers by the audience of three of South Africas radio stations. The song even went on to beat its closest rival ? Just walk into my life from Main Aisa Hi Hoon starring Ajay Devgan ? by over 1,000 votes. Bachchan Sr ? famous for having two left feet ? can sleep easy now. 

 As if one Meera of the Magnificent Smooches wasnt bad enough. Now we have Sana ? the latest import from across the Line of Control. She made her mark in Lollywood ? as the Pakistani film industry is better known ? with Yeh Dil Aap Ka Hua. Now, flush with the films success, she has decided to take the plunge into the murky, casting-couch infested waters of Bollywood. Theres no doubt though that big brother Sunny Deol, who stars opposite her in Kafilah, will be watching over her. Believe it or not, the film is apparently on the trials faced by illegal immigrant women in India. Shooting for the film has already started in Ladakh and Manali. Lets hope, unlike Meera, Sana remembers the limits of her line of control.

 TO FIND THAT FAVOURITE BOOK

 Keep tracking

 For instance, where and how would you find these recent books? William Easterly: The White Man?s Burden: Why the West?s Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good; Richard Hines: A Night at the Majestic: Proust amp; The Great Modernist Dinner Party Of 1922; Amos Oz: A Tale of Love and Darkness; Meghnad Desai: The Route of All Evil: The Political Economy of Ezra Pound; and the whole corpus of Cold War titles after the opening up of the Soviet archives. 

 There are two reasons why serious books are not easily available. First, booksellers don?t know what these titles are or who their likely customers would be. All they know is the price and trade terms and whether or not they would make money on a deal involving multiple copies of a title. In other words, the business is about money alone, and not about books or ideas.

 On the crucial question of relevance of a book, they simply don?t know; at best their intellectual input is to check out the bestseller lists in the British and American press and then play it by the ear. Invariably they play safe and wait for the market to respond.

 The second reason is the lack of physical space. There is no bookshop that has adequate space to stock multiple copies of a title. So bookshops either specialize, stock heavily discounted titles while show-window some of the latest titles that are invariably advance publicity copies provided by the publisher?s representative.

 So, how do you get the books you want? The organization structure of the imported book trade in India is pretty simple. The supply chain is the same as for any other commodity ? publishers-wholesalers-retailers-customers. However, the dividing line between wholesalers and retailers is becoming blurred now. There is a considerable overlap because British-American publishers will supply titles to any retailer on more or less the same terms as they offer to wholesalers. Besides, apart from publishers, there are ?jobbers? in America who don?t respect any distribution arrangements: whoever is willing to pay is welcome to pick up any stock.

 All the same, every British-American publisher has a local representative in India and it is important to know who this is. Once you know the book you require, you could place your order with the representative or route it through a bookseller. Either way, you can be sure that the book would reach you within 4 to 6 weeks.

 That?s more than half the battle won. The other half is to know the title you want and the name of the publisher. This information could be had by checking out the up-market magazines ? The New York Review of Books, Times Literary Supplement, London Review of Books, The Economist et al ? where forthcoming books are advertised or reviewed soon after publication. Or you could get forthcoming books? catalogues or surf the internet.

 The essential point to bear in mind is that you have to make the effort to get the book you want and not just rely on the bookseller to get hold of it for you.

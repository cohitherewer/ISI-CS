The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BODY BLOW

 It would be alarmist to call it a spectre that is haunting Bengal. But it could be a costly mistake to ignore the fact that Maoists are growing bolder in some parts of the state. The worrying thing about the Maoist strike in Belpahari is not that it happened. An element of surprise is at the heart of guerrilla tactics. The real worry is that the state government once again found itself inadequately prepared to meet the challenge. This failure should be a major cause for concern for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. True, as the chief minister insists, the Maoist threat is confined to only a few pockets in four districts close to the Bengal-Jharkhand border. That should have made it easier for the government to tackle the threat. The government?s inability to deal with it even in these isolated areas makes one wonder if it is equipped to meet a larger threat. 

 The failure has much to do with a political dilemma that Mr Bhattacharjee seems to be facing. The leftists have long been confused as to how to fight their extremist comrades. They are ever uncertain if they should look at it as a political problem or as a law and order issue. The coming elections would also hold the government back from a full-fledged offensive against the rebels. There are signs that such political calculations have diluted the government?s strategy to fight the Maoists. But then, the ruling leftists are not alone in this. Their opponents too try to use the issue to their political advantage. It is a dangerous game and the parties may have to pay dearly for their petty gambles. Just as the government needs to be more decisive, the parties too must see the real danger the Maoists pose to all of them. It would be suicidal for the opposition parties to connive at the Maoist violence in the hope that it would weaken the Marxists? hold on Bengal?s villages. The political battles have to be fought in democratic ways. The parties can have a major role, though, in stirring public opinion against the rebels.

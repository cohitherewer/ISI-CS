 INFUSE FRESH BLOOD

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Why does the Congress continue to procrastinate on making the many radical changes required to bring a fresh energy and vitality to its organization? Why is the much-needed overhaul not being orchestrated and carried to its logical end? Why are all the old and infirm ruling the roost with their outdated and archaic positions on all contemporary issues? Why are redundant and failed administrative methodology, unthinking policy initiatives seen as experienced management? Why are the aged not eased out of office and forced to retire? Why are intelligent and effective ministers in their early sixties seen to be young, and, therefore, not given full cabinet rank? 

 We are at a critical moment in our history. Corruption in politics and in administration, criminality, lack of integrity, abuse of all the values our generation was infused with, the supremacy of money and muscle power, have come together with the abdication of responsibility by the executive to poison the roots of dignified life, impinging violently on civil liberties. A whole new generation of voters in independent India are waiting to discard all the trappings that are symbolic of regressive policy and initiatives. These had compelled India to mark time through the Sixties and Seventies, forced corruption during and forever after the Emergency, and did not correct themselves. 

 India has reached a saturation point where it can no longer absorb the negatives thrust upon its body politic. The outer, public space is becoming home to new demands and aspirations. A societal churning is happening and rapidly gaining momentum. But there is no indication of an attempt to understand this new reality.

 Sadly, all the polls that are conducted tend to ask the same predictable questions through the same predictable mechanism, using the same preconceived notions as the base for questioning and probing. We need to extricate ourselves from what we believe we know. We must start on the premise that we do not know. We must introduce the young, those under the age of 35 and 40, to frame the issues and then the questions. Only then will a clearer picture of the metamorphosis emerge. Till that happens, no assessment can be deemed valid. 

 If a strong signal goes out from the Congress high command that this time round it means business, that it is putting in place and making operational a fresh methodology and ethic for political activism led by a youthful generation that has a stake in securing its own future, the scene on the ground could change overnight. Constituents, a majority of them, regardless of social and economic class, caste, creed and religion, are looking for a handle to hold and shift gear, in an effort to move ahead, to free themselves from social, economic and intellectual penury.

 With the start of the 60th anniversary of Indian independence from the British, we must re-invent ourselves and break loose from the inherited legacy of feudal and colonial laws, rules and regulations, alien values, false prejudices against our own, and breathe oxygen into our political, social and intellectual space. It is time we restored our dignity and civilization, only to enter another more dynamic phase where the struggle for equality of opportunity and purpose holds more importance than exploitation, corruption and ineptitude.

 The Congress can well become the symbol and engine of that long-sought-after change. It is well-placed, better than most, to trigger the movement. It should start in the heartland, where the chronic disease needs urgent diagnosis and a drastic curative that will purge the body politic of its all consuming illness. Radical chemotherapy in Uttar Pradesh could set the trend and evoke a sense of hope.

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Attitudes and ethical conduct of inspectors: The limitations of labour inspection are often also related to the attitude of labour inspectors. One must not close one?s eyes to that. In some, mostly developing, countries the attitude is one of accepting bribes and perks. Corruption can play an important role. ILO has evidence of such situations. In countries where such unethical conduct persists, enforcement is far beyond inspectors? abilities and possibilities, and other approaches need to be sought. One could start with the advisory and/or facilitating role of labour inspection to regain trust and rebuild confidence, and re-establish a reliable position of authority.

 4.1. Defining the authority of labour inspectors: The authority of labour inspectors must be clearly defined. There must be an unambiguous definition of the role and functions of the labour inspectorate, as well as of its authority in relation to child labour. The legislation must establish the general principle that labour inspectors may enter and search premises, and specify sectors or areas where this power is limited. The mandate of the labour inspectorate must be established not only to guide its own action but also for the sake of other government agencies, employers? and workers? organizations and NGOs that have a role to play in securing the rights of children, as well as the children and their families themselves, so that they all understand the role of the labour inspectorate and utilize it effectively.

 With clear authority to enter and search workplaces, special provisions must regulate inspectors? access to places where child domestic workers are employed or where children work in private homes. They also have to be protected against acts of intimidation by third parties or senior officials. Obstructing their work must incur severe penalties or sanctions. If labour inspectors have a direct or indirect role in prosecution, they need to network with other agencies connected with law enforcement, such as the office of the state prosecutor or attorney-general, judges and the police. They will also require training on how to investigate complaints, to conduct inquiries at the workplace... to initiate prosecutions and to give evidence.

 4.2. The qualities of labour inspectors: The labour inspectorate itself must be an efficient and trained cadre of permanent staff who have the necessary status within the public service to be able to perform their responsibilities. They need to know the law, the industrial and commercial environment and the measures that have to be taken to protect workers in general, and working children in particular. They must be able to maintain records, collect statistics, analyze data and write reports. The inspectorate must also have an infrastructure of support services for record keeping and maintaining the confidentiality of information. The impartiality and authority of labour inspectors has to be ensured through the system of recruitment, their conditions of employment and, most importantly, their expertise and conduct.

 Given their protective and preventive responsibilities, labour inspectors must be able to interact with workers and employers and obtain their cooperation in upholding with the law. In so far as they have a role to play in conflict resolution, they need to have conciliation skills and considerable sensitivity. They must be trained in communication skills as their responsibilities require that, in addition to employers and workers, they collaborate with a range of government officials and technical personnel. Networking with medical doctors, engineers and other professionals concerned with health and safety and other labour protection issues at the workplace may also be necessary. In developing countries generally there is however a great shortage of human and material resources to carry out the functions of labour inspection. There may perhaps be genuine intentions to apply the law, but performance fails to measure up to these intentions.

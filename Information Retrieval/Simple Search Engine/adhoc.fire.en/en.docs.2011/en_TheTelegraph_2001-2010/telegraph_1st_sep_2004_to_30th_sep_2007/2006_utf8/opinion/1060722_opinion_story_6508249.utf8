 SHAH OF THE MARQUEE

 Actor Naseeruddin Shah has wielded a directors baton ? and woven magic 

 Will the real Naseeruddin Shah please stand up? First there he is, a stage actor. Then the mainstay of parallel Hindi cinema. He makes another glorious entry, this time as an actor in mainstream Bollywood. And just when the world gets used to Naseer, the actor, he goes and directs a film. 

 On Friday, Yun Hota To Kya Hota ? or What If? ? was released in cinema halls across the country. The first reactions have been flattering. All those who thought that Shah ? with his intense, brooding looks ? would churn out a dark film on real life were surprised to find that the film is all about colours. There is life, a reference to tragedy, and a good dose of verity. 

 I feel like a 22-year-old making a debut. I felt exactly the same way when I made my debut as an actor with Nishant, says Naseeruddin Shah. The thought behind the story was a fact about life. They were all credible characters, he says. 

 Thats what they had said about Shyam Benegals Nishant, and a young man called Naseer. Some 130 films and over 30 years later, Shah ? who turned 56 on Thursday ? has wielded a directors baton ? and, if some critics are to be believed, woven magic. 

 Those who know him are not really surprised. Naseer is versatile and has always been a wonderful actor, says director Mahesh Bhatt. I feel he should have taken up direction a long time ago. Im sure hell do a wonderful job. And filmmakers will have tough competition, he says. 

 So what took him so long? I was very cautious at the beginning. I felt like a snowflake in hell, he says. 

 His fans wouldnt think so. For them, he was the quintessential thespian who essayed every role with perfection ? whether he was Vishwam in Nishant, Bhola in Manthan, Bhaskar Kulkarni in Aakrosh, D.K. Malhotra in Masoom or Jay Singh in Tridev. 

 Not surprisingly, the legion of fans even in the industry is quite a strong one. Naseeruddin Shah is an institution, avers actor Paresh Rawal. Naseer has always been an inspiration to me. 

 Some say that Naseeruddin Shah can never be typecast, even though he has played a Parsi in six different films ? They call me Naseeru Dinshaw, he guffaws. One moment he is on a Mumbai stage (Theatre is an addiction for me, and I draw strength from it. Even if any friend is doing theatre, I have to have a role in it), and the next moment he is in Bollywood. 

 Industry buzz has it that he was paid a whopping Rs 9 crore for his role in the Sean Connery-starrer The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Says Shah: I wanted to meet Mr Sean Connery for, as a kid, I loved him as James Bond. I was also offered a huge sum of money and I wanted to know more about these big-budget Hollywood films. There was no way I could have refused the film though in the end, it turned out to be a bore. 

 Shah would like to believe that Yun Hota To Kya Hota is going to be anything but a bore. The audience is in for a surprise if they think my movies are going to be like the early films that I have worked in, he says. And it is an achievement if they like my film. 

 For Shah, there are other doors still waiting to be opened. He plans to teach everything that you want to know about cinema at director-producer Subhash Ghais new institute Whistling Woods International. I will be trying to teach acting to the students there, he says ? somewhat incredulously. 

 There is some good cinema on the anvil as well. Naseer is in Mithiya, director Rajat Kapoors new film. Ranvir Shorey, he stresses, is playing the lead and Shah is a gangster in the film. And then theres Hat Trick ? a love story between Shah and Hema Malini. This is about a not-so-legit relationship between two people in the twilight of their lives. 

 Twilight of his life? Nah ? Naseeruddin Shah hasnt yet dealt with dawn.

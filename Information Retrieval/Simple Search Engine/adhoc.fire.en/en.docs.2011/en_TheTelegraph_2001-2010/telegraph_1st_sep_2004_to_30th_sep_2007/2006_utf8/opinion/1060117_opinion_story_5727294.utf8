 FENCING MASTERS

 Borders and boundaries are matters of a state?s security, but the people living on them may view things very differently. The controversies over fencing along the India-Bangladesh border are evidence of this. The three non-governmental organizations, which have opposed the Centre?s move to fence the India-Bangladesh border in Meghalaya, reflect the local people?s worries. They are not the first ones to have serious misgivings about the impact of the fence on their lives. Some northern parts of Bengal witnessed a similar campaign against the fencing of the border in recent months. In both Bengal and Meghalaya, these people are afraid of losing large tracts of agricultural land because of the fence. It is easy to understand the fear. The people living on the borders depend entirely on farming. The areas are too poor to offer alternative sources of livelihood. It can be argued that the government that cannot make their lives any better have no right to take away the people?s only source of sustenance. 

 However, no state can afford to keep its borders unprotected. India?s borders with Bangladesh may not be as unquiet as those with Pakistan. But New Delhi cannot ignore the ominous signals on the eastern frontiers. The threat of Islamist militants trying to infiltrate into India through these borders has increased manifold, as recent events in Bangladesh show. Some of these border areas have also been used by insurgent groups in India?s North-east as transit routes to their camps. There are small stretches of disputed territories that intermittently lead to armed conflicts between the border security forces of the two countries. All this underscores the need for greater security on the borders. But a democratic state cannot trample on people?s lives even in the name of national security. The fence will remain a symbol of displacement and deprivation unless it comes with a resettlement and compensation package.

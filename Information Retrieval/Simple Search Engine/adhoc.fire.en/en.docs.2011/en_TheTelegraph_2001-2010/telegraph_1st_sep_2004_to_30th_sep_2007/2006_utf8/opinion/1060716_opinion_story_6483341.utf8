The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 For the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, it has become imperative to prevent a repeat of the Mumbai scenario elsewhere in India, for his own sake at least. The moment a bomb goes off somewhere, the spotlight shifts to him. He was the most-sought-after man following the recent train blasts in India?s economic capital. The prime minister, who was in Calcutta that fateful day, asked for him the moment he landed in New Delhi. While desperate efforts went on to contact him, someone wryly commented that the minister would, in all probability, be found busy combing his hair. What, Patil? Yes, because the home minister, reportedly, has been found to be inordinately concerned about his appearance most of the time. One account would illustrate this. On the day a close associate of his died, Patil was apparently spotted changing thrice to suit the mood. He was seen in spotless white when he rushed to the hospital. Hours later, when the dead was brought home, Patil was there, grim-faced, but clad in a safari suit. In the evening, at the cremation ground, it was an immaculately-cut bandhgala that was put on, in keeping with the sombre settings. What was it this time for Mumbai?

 While Mumbai saw red last Tuesday, the BJP saw saffron. It seized the occasion, and now Modi is trying to lead the campaign in Maharashtra, Sushma Swaraj in Delhi, and LK Advani in Gujarat. Before the plan of action got rolling, the immediate reaction from Advani was staunchly anti-government. Advani roundly accused the UPA of turning soft on terrorists. But he soon realized that his own record as home minister did not inspire much confidence either. After all, some of the worst terrorist attacks ? from the hijack drama to the attack on parliament ? happened under his watch. So there was immediate change of tack. The anti-government refrain, however, has been taken up by Rajnath Singh. A multi-pronged attack, no less frightening.

 A Pawar play, albeit of a different kind. While the country struggled with the price hike, the agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, thought it most expedient to attend an ICC meet in London and hold forth on how to promote cricket in South Africa. And why not? Pawar has been the favourite whipping boy of the Congress for some time now. And yet, only days back, he was the PM?s most trusted ally. So why stick around to take the punches!

 The Congress president?s recent reshuffle of the party?s media cell has had a few surprises. There was no major one when Janardhan Dwivedi was elevated to being media chairperson. It was Satyavrat Chaturvedi?s rehabilitation that has raised eyebrows, although his credentials are impeccable. It is just that Chaturvedi had recently been stripped of his charge as gen-sec because of his turf war with the Uttar Pradesh Congress committee chief, Salman Khurshid. This was balanced by Chaturvedi?s nomination to the Rajya Sabha from Uttaranchal, whose CM, ND Tiwari, has Chaturvedi in his good books. There are more changes in the offing reportedly. Mukul Wasnik has been accommodated in the media cell, giving rise to speculations that Meira Kumar could be resettled in the party with a more unglamorous assignment. The person who stands to gain from all this is the indubitable Renuka Chowdhury, who has been grieving over her present position as minister of state for women and child welfare.

 The high profile Congress gen-sec, Margaret Alva, has for long resisted being shunted off to a gubernatorial posting. But now there seems to be no avoiding that fate. However, Alva, allegedly has her preference. If Raj Bhavan it has to be, then it better be Maharashtra?s. There is a slight problem there though. Alva has a running feud with the CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh, which has forced the high command into a rethink. She is, supposedly, being considered as the next lieutenant governor of Delhi. A consolation prize?

 Return of the prodigal, we mean Uma Bharti and Madanlal Khurana. They claim to have clinching evidence of the corruption in the BJP, but may return to the party if their rivals are shown the door. Khurana, in fact, has more to offer. If the BJP does not cleanse its house, Khurana is determined to join Ramdev in teaching yoga and ayurveda. The sadhvi, however, has no such retirement plans. Which means the BJP can look forward to more fire-fighting.

 Even out of the party management, Ambika Soni continues to be a problem for many. Soni is reputed to be the only minister who occupies two offices ? one in Shastri Bhavan, the other in Transport Bhavan ? for tourism and culture. Meanwhile, AR Antulay, minister for minority welfare, still has no office and has to operate from his residence. Soni also has two private secretaries ? Damu Ravi for the tourism ministry and Sandeep Silas for culture. The minister, wielding the iron rod, has abolished the GoM on tourism and culture, and not without reason. It was headed by arch-rival Arjun Singh. Also, not surprisingly, schemes started by Soni?s predecessor in the tourism ministry, Renuka Chowdhury. Unlike Chowdhury, Soni is yet to meet other ministers to work out policies undertaken to promote health and eco-tourism in the country. There have been reports of bureaucrats resigning for want of job. Time to shift Soni out?

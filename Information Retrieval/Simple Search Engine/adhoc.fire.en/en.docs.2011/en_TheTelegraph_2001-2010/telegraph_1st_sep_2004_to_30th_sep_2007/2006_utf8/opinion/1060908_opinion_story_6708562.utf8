 Draw the hussy to your bosom

 Event, Metaphor, Memory: Chauri 

 Chaura 1922-1992 (Penguin, Rs 295) by Shahid 

 Amin studies the notorious anti-police riot of February 

 1922 in Chauri Chaura, a small market town in north India. 

 Some followers of Mahatma Gandhi, mostly peasants, burnt 

 down a police station and killed twenty-three policemen, 

 blighting the non-violent nationalism that had been espoused 

 by Gandhi. Amins unsparing account of the ways in which 

 this event has been repeatedly left out of nationalist 

 hagiography, exposes the heart of aggressive politics that 

 belies the supposed non-violent character of Gandhian nationalism. 

 By combining archival material with local memory, Amin shows 

 how new meanings are created by the interplay of recorded 

 and oral narratives.

 Scoop!: Inside Stories from 

 the Partition to the Present (HarperCollins, Rs 250) 

 by Kuldip Nayar collects the veteran journalists 

 thoughts on subcontinental politics and politicians. There 

 are crisply written sketches of Gandhi, Jinnah, Nehru, Mountbatten 

 and Radcliffe, sometimes as personal memoirs, alongside 

 incisive commentaries on national and international politics. 

 This book is written almost as a prelude to Nayars prospective 

 autobiography, The Day Looks Old.

 Selected Stories (Penguin, 

 Rs 295) by Parashuram includes some of the best 

 stories by Rajshekhar Bose, translated from the Bengali 

 by Sukanta Chaudhuri and Palash Baran Pal. While Chaudhuris 

 introduction to the selection is excellent, the translations 

 are not uniformly elegant: O Kali, O Mother, draw the hussy 

 to your bosom in a bout of cholera, prays Shibu in On 

 Bhushandis Plain. Jatindrakumar Sens charming illustrations 

 to the original Bengali stories have been retained in this 

 volume.

 Baghdad FC: Iraqs Football 

 Story (John Murray, 5) by Simon Freeman 

 is a record of the tribulations faced by Iraqi footballers 

 during the despotic regime of Saddam Hussein. Subtitled 

 A Hidden History of Sport and Tyranny, this book reveals 

 how Uday Hussein, Saddams son and former sports minister, 

 tortured, arrested and murdered Iraqs sporting heroes. 

 Freeman intersperses political and sports history deftly 

 to create a seamless and eminently readable narrative.

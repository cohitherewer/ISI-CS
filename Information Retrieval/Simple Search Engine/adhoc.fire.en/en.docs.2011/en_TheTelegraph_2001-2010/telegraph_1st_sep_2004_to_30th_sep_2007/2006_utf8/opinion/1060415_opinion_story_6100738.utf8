 The reception was something like the one that greeted freedom fighters on their way back home from Kalapani. The roads of Jodhpur ? where Salman Khan was incarcerated ? were spilling over with men and women eager to catch a glimpse of the white-vested actor after his release from jail on Thursday. When he reached home in Mumbai, there were people hanging on to roof tops to welcome Salman. Sallu was back ? and everybody was happy.

 The sympathy for Abdul Raseed Salim Salman Khan was so thick that you could cut through it with a blunt butter knife. Brother Sohail Khan, a director, whispered that mother Salma couldnt take the news of her sons imprisonment and had to be hospitalised. Girl friend Katrina Kaif ? difficult to recognise for she was fully clad ? rushed to Jodhpur to accompany Sallu back home. Elsewhere, celebrities were shaking their heads in dismay. Such a beautiful person, said director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. So caring, said step mom, Helen. Fabulous human being, said music director Anu Malik.

 Clearly, it was a harrowing two nights for the beautiful, caring and fabulous man. For breakfast, the media duly noted, the 38-year-old actor was given roasted Bengal gram. For lunch, there was sabzi to be had with rotis. All that the poor man could do was nibble on chocolate and play carroms with his jail mates through the day. When he left town immediately after being granted bail, the jail ? said his cell mate ? felt all empty. For Salman Khans spell in jail had bestowed fame upon a nondescript little prison in a Rajasthan town.

 And the two nights in the cell also gave the actor ? known for his violent bouts of hot-headedness ? a pristine halo. Suddenly, Salman Khan was not the man who publicly and physically harassed former girl friend Aishwarya Rai. He was not the man actor Vivek Oberoi denounced at a press conference in April 2003, saying that Salman had called him 41 times one night. And he was certainly not the man who fled after his car ran over four men sleeping on a sidewalk in Mumbai four years ago.

 Instead, he was a man, everybody agreed, who had encountered the flipside of being a celebrity. He was in jail for shooting animals when those who had gunned down Delhi model Jessica Lal still roamed free, said the sympathisers indignantly. And all this, they argued, just because he was a celebrity.

 Emotions ran high also because public memory, being notably short, had all but forgotten the eight-year-old incident of hunting. In 1998, Salman Khan was in Jodhpur to shoot a song for a film called Hum Saath Saath Hain. The actor and his friends went to the desert for a hunt and shot dead two black bucks and a chinkara. A complaint was lodged with the police. He was charged, under The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, with hunting and killing three endangered animals on the night of September 27-28. On Tuesday, a Jodhpur court sentenced him to five years in jail.

 Bollywood shed copious tears for a man who has always been in the thick of controversies. I do know that hell come out of this stronger, but I think the sentence is too harsh, said Anu Malik. I dont know the details of the case and I believe that celebrities set examples, but the conviction is too harsh, he said.

 To be sure, Salman Khan has always managed to pull himself out of unseemly controversies. For, clearly, the mans penchant for getting embroiled in rows equals his ability to wriggle out of them. For Bollywoods enfant terrible ? who made his mark as a sad-eyed, romantic hero with his 1989 film Maine Pyar Kiya ? has had the most chequered career in Bollywood outside of cinema.

 Take his relationship with Aishwarya Rai. Salman and Aishwarya started dating in 1991 after they were paired as lovers in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. Soon, Mumbai was abuzz with stories about Aishwarya being bashed up by Salman. In 2002, the Rai family lodged a complaint with the police saying that a drunk Salman Khan had broken window panes and furniture in Aishwaryas house. On two occasions, he tried to publicly rough Aishwarya up. Finally, her then boy friend, Vivek Oberoi, went to town on the issue. Enough is enough, said an incensed Oberoi.

 (He) needs psychiatric help not just for his unacceptable behaviour but also for his problem with alcoholism, his attitude towards women and for his warped sense of machoism, he said.

 Warped or not, Salman Khans USP is his macho image. With his bulging biceps, yesterdays Romeo is todays macho man. He is a guys guy, says Mumbai-based film critic Rajeev Masand. Hes there for you and he wants you to know that. He enjoys his reputation as a 3 am friend and fuels that reputation himself. But theres clearly a wild side, he says.

 The so-called wild side was most evident during the 2002 hit-and-run case. His Land Cruiser rammed into four men, killing one and injuring the rest. Worse, Salman disappeared from the site of the accident, later claiming that he was worried hed be lynched. Salman was charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, driving while drunk and not having a valid license.

 For Salman Khan, all this is passe. For Salman is just one of the many men seeking thrills ? through fast cars or motor cycles and often violent behaviour ? in and around Mumbai. Delhi-based psychiatrist Sameer Parikh believes that male hormones and socio-cultural conditioning trigger aggression in men. Expression of aggression could range from verbal abuse to physical fights or speeding on the road to killing other animals for pleasure, depending on an individual bent of mind, he says. The expression comes in different ways to different people, he adds.

 Most celebrities get away with it, says Parikh, in the lack of a social deterrent. The irony is that when the system gets back to a celebrity, it gets back very hard, he says.

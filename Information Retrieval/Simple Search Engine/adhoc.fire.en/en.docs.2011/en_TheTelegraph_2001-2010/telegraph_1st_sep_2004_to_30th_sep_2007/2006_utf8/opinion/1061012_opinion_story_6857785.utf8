The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNDER HAND

 Only misplaced faith will see the market economy as a school for social ethics. This is not to condone corruption but to recognize the reality of a world driven by competition. The desire to outdo a rival has made many companies across the globe cut corners and engage in practices which often do not pass the purists test of probity. This overall ambience needs to be borne in mind before passing too harsh a judgment on Indian companies that use bribes to procure business abroad. The 2006 Bribe Payers Index has revealed that Indian companies are most prone to giving bribes. Indian companies were right at the bottom of a list of 30 countries. Above India were Russia and China. Countries were graded on a scale of ten where a score of ten indicated a perception of no corruption. India scored 4.62 out of ten, the lowest. The three countries that were at the bottom of the pile together account for nine per cent of global exports. This statistic is interesting in its implications. It suggests that a large number of people in government and private enterprises across the world are not averse to taking bribes. Bribery by definition is a transaction: a bribe-giver must find someone on the other side of the table who is willing to accept the bribe. In that sense, the Bribe Payers Index is meaningless without a bribe-receivers index. The entire exercise will be reduced to nonsense if, for example, it is discovered that those who scored very high on the payers index scored very low in the one concerning receivers. The Bribe Payers Index thus needs to be taken with some amount of salt on the tongue.

 The above argument should not be read as an attempt to whitewash Indian bribe-givers. Anyone familiar with Indian public life knows about the prevalence of corruption: the giving and taking of bribes and of other kinds of favours. Corruption is perhaps the single most pervasive feature of public life in India and its tentacles cover the fields of politics to business to sports. Thus it is not difficult to believe the findings of the Bribe Payers Index. In fact, it is a statistical confirmation of a general impression. That India is the worst offender in a global study acquires a certain urgency as Indian companies have only recently begun to operate in global markets. Indian business houses have merely exported their nefarious business practices to foreign shores.

 Some business houses operating around the world are known to have indulged in fraud and corrupt practices. They dressed up, in the words of one writer, capricious and vacuous venality as enterprise. What such instances reveal is that bribery is not the only form of dishonesty while doing business. The market economy is yet to evolve a set of best practices and a code of ethics. Indian businessmen have taken full advantage of this lacunae. It would not hurt so much if Indians did not always claim the moral high ground.

 TROUBLED LIVES

 Exception proves the rule. For one Indra Nooyi allowed past the glass barrier, there will be innumerable others kept firmly shut out. Sitting in judgment over a Manchester health inspectors allegation of being grossly underpaid in comparison to her male colleagues, the European Court of Justice recently ruled that employers are justified in paying some employees more for a longer period of service. The additional years of service, it held, allows a worker to attain rewarding experience, which enables him to perform his duties better. Apart from the unassailable proof that more years in service do not necessarily culminate in stellar performance, the ominous message that the judgment sends out to women can be held against it. The premium placed on the workers length of service means that women who gain from the experience of childbirth and child-rearing, would gain little otherwise from their indiscretion of allowing biological instincts to take over their lives. Female employees, who naturally lose out in terms of working years to their male colleagues, can no longer hope for the pay gap to be bridged. The playing field for the sexes, yet to be levelled, is now made more irregular. 

 There are several reasons to suspect that. Close to three decades of activism and legislation have failed to bring pay packets of men and women on a par for work of equal value in the West. Discrimination against pregnant women is phenomenal, especially in the private sector, which is most reluctant to sympathize with the plight of child-bearers. As the British political leader, Mr Godfrey Bloom, famously proclaimed in the European Parliament about two years ago, no self-respecting small businessman would employ a lady of child-bearing age. Reluctant to bear the burden of workers, made temporarily unproductive, managements sometimes dismiss pregnant women, make them redundant or treat them so badly as to force them to quit. For those who stay on, the tangible discrimination in the form of missed opportunities and financial loss is no less humiliating. The court verdict may further institutionalize this experience. 

 As a way out of this obvious limbo, lawyers advise that men be cajoled to take paternity leave. In most Western countries, such periods vary between a few weeks to as much as six months. But few men, even if they are convinced to take the initial weeks off, are willing to take longer paternity leaves that come with a wage cut. Women thus seem to be left with an unenviable choice. Many, however, are seeking a way out by deciding not to have children at all. Not surprisingly, birth rates have come down, forcing countries like Germany to lure parents by promising 14 months of paid leave. Most of this, one can say with some conviction, will be taken by the clueless women who see more worth in creating homes than in inhabiting hostile offices.

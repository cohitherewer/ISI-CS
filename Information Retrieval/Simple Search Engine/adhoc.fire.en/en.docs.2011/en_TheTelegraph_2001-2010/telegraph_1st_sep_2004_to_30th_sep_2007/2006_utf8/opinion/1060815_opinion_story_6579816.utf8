 MAKING HEAVY WEATHER 

 - A prime minister decides on a balance of considerations 

 Writing on the wall 

 Ashok V. Desai

After a year and a half of courtship, 

 President George W. Bush came to Delhi and signed an agreement 

 with the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, on March 1. Under 

 it, India promised to divide its nuclear reactors into civil 

 and military ones and to put the former under the safeguards 

 of the International Atomic Energy Agency. It promised not 

 to carry out nuclear tests, and to abide by all the restrictions 

 applicable under the missile technology control regime and 

 controls on proliferation of nuclear technology that the 

 five nuclear powers have agreed to apply to themselves. 

 In return, the United States of America undertook to supply 

 nuclear fuel to the Tarapur power plant, to cooperate with 

 India on civil nuclear technology and to persuade other 

 nuclear powers to change the international control regimes 

 and accommodate India. While they were at it, the two leaders 

 also agreed to initiate or enhance cooperation in ten other 

 areas such as rural education, AIDS and prevention of terrorism.

 The basic concession India got 

 under this agreement is that the nuclear non-proliferation 

 treaty requires its signatories to place all their reactors 

 under IAEAs surveillance, and in effect, not to use any 

 of the spent fuel for making nuclear bombs. Under the Indo-US 

 agreement, India can keep some reactors outside the IAEA 

 discipline. It can keep the bombs it has made; whether it 

 can make any more is left unspecified, but it cannot explode 

 any more.

 The two bills in Congress enshrining 

 the agreement contain some additional restrictions which 

 have caused concern in India. But the passage of legislation 

 broadly embodying the agreement is pretty certain, and so, 

 therefore, is US commitment. The Indian Constitution does 

 not require inter-state agreements to be approved by the 

 parliament. So the agreement is more or less in place. But 

 it is at the centre of a political hurricane; the Indian 

 government has been under vicious attacks from political 

 enemies, partners and the media. 

 All parties in this debate behave 

 as if Manmohan Singh is the sole initiator or perpetrator 

 of this agreement. It suits the opposition to have a real 

 and present culprit. And the government, which considers 

 the agreement to be a great achievement, is happy to take 

 all the blame. But the truth is that Manmohan Singh has 

 only concluded a process that was started by the previous 

 government.

 This agreement has been in the 

 making for seven years. Soon after Indias nuclear ceremony 

 in 1998, Jaswant Singh began his serial conversations with 

 Nelson Strobridge Talbott III known to all as Strobe Talbott 

 and tried to persuade him that the Indian bombs were a 

 reality and that the US should adjust itself to it. This 

 argument did not carry with the Clinton regime. But even 

 before he was elected, George Bush had identified a potential 

 ally in India. Once he became president, Jaswant Singhs 

 efforts bore fruit. The first was the joint statement of 

 Bush and Vajpayee in November 2001. After two years of negotiation, 

 it led to the next steps in strategic partnership agreed 

 in January 2004. They included cooperation in civilian nuclear 

 energy, civilian space programmes and missile defence; what 

 India promised in return was that it would institute effective 

 export controls on nuclear material and technology, and 

 that it would not use technology it was to get from the 

 US to advance its nuclear weapons programme. NSSP foreshadowed 

 the Bush-Manmohan Singh agreement of March this year. Jaswant 

 Singh and Atal Bihari Vajpayee could beat their chests today 

 and take credit for this agreement. But the current BJP 

 party line is mindless opposition, so these otherwise sane 

 leaders have to disown their own achievements and attack 

 Manmohan Singh for following in their footsteps. The United 

 Progressive Alliance government could not get NSSP translated 

 into concrete changes in US law and policy. For one thing, 

 Vajpayee unwisely brought in Yashwant Sinha as foreign minister; 

 the momentum in Indo-US relations was lost as a result. 

 For another, persuading US legislators was a different game 

 from negotiations with the administration. Emollient, Anglophone 

 Manmohan Singh has played it better; the March agreement 

 is on the way to being embodied in legislation by the US 

 Congress.

 Of course, it cannot be proved 

 that the March agreement is one that the BJP potentates 

 would have signed. And no one but a government flunkey would 

 argue that it is the best that could be achieved. The merits 

 of the agreement can be discussed endlessly, for no agreement 

 can be proved to be both ideal and feasible. It is the result 

 of a bargain between two countries it is bound to be a 

 compromise that serves the interests of neither completely.

 And for that reason, I do not 

 think it is clever of the government to engage with the 

 opposition on the merits of the agreement. The agreement 

 does place constraints on the governments future freedom 

 of manoeuvre. There is no way to counter an opponent who 

 asserts, however intemperately, that the government has 

 sold out the interests of the country.

 The prime minister has not been 

 voluble or vehement in its defence; sometimes he has even 

 sounded as if he was part of the opposition. Maybe he senses 

 that the government cannot win the argument on points. But 

 a prime minister cannot sign such an important agreement 

 and then distance himself from it. He has not only to defend 

 it, but he has also to find the most favourable vantage 

 point from which to do so.

 A nuclear reconciliation agreement 

 is an advance, but not one worth laying down ones life 

 for. It takes on significance only as part of a broader 

 vision. Such a vision was embodied, however imperfect, however 

 unclear, in NSSP. It was spelt out in even bigger letters 

 when George Bush told the prime minister that the US would 

 help India become a major world power in the 21st century. 

 What did he mean? What would the US do for India? Manmohan 

 Singh should have striven to put content into that promise, 

 and used it to persuade his countrymen to accept a radical 

 change in foreign policy.

 Admittedly, a man of caution would 

 think twice before shouting India-Amrika bhai bhai. 

 First, the US unseated Saddam Hussein, a friend of India, 

 and occupied Iraq. Now it is backing the mass killings and 

 destruction Israel has unleashed upon Lebanon. But as Manmohan 

 Singh must know from long experience, a prime minister must 

 take decisions on balance of considerations; he cannot afford 

 to have sensitive morals. If he thinks an alliance with 

 the US is in the national interest, he must embrace it with 

 all its consequences; and he must defend and glorify it 

 with all the eloquence at his command. A prime minister 

 does not always have a strong grip on the government. But 

 he has unlimited access to public eyes and ears; what he 

 says can have far-reaching influence if he knows how to 

 spin words, weave stories and carry people with him. In 

 a sense, words are all he has; and coming from him, words 

 could change the world. And changing the world is the business 

 leaders are in; there are any number of mediocrities around 

 to run it.

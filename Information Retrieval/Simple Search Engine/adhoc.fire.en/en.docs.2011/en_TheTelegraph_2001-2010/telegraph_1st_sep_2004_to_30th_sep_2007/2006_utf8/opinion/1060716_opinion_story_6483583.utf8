 HISTORY AS BUNK

 Indians have an obsession with anniversaries. The current one high on the list of political priorities is the celebration of 150 years of the revolt of 1857. Despite the blasts in Mumbai and Srinagar and the consequent deterioration in the relationship with Pakistan, the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, found time to chair a 68-member committee to discuss the celebrations to commence next year. The committee does not have on it a single historian who has worked on the history of the rebellion. It is packed with politicians of various hues. But it has at its disposal a generous grant of Rs 150 crore. What can such a committee do with such a large amount of money? It can use the anniversary for political purposes and also give to the events of 1857 a particular political slant. The absence of historians on the committee is thus telling and perhaps not entirely an oversight. Already the pitfalls of this are evident. The celebrations are to begin in August. It is known, even to school students, that the revolt began in Meerut on May 10, 1857. Then, why August? This is an obvious and rather crude attempt to appropriate the revolt into the saga of the nationalist movement ? the Quit India Movement of 1942 began in August and independence came to India also in August a few years later. There will be a museum in Lal Qila but nobody is quite clear what will be preserved in that museum, since the remains of 1857 are really scanty. Again, the project to build one central museum for 1857 takes away from the revolt its regional character. There will also be a yatra that will begin in Barrackpore, even though that cantonment had little or nothing to do with what happened in North India in the summer of 1857.

 In the sidelines of the celebration plans are taking place bizarre controversies. The Bharatiya Janata Party, represented in the committee by no less a person than Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, does not want to get left behind in the race to appropriate 1857 into the freedom struggle. It has suggested that special attention should be given to V.D. Savarkar since he was the first, according to the BJP, to call it the first war of Indian independence. The communists have retorted that this is factually incorrect because Karl Marx described the revolt in those terms much earlier than Savarkar. The level of ignorance being displayed is breathtaking. Savarkar?s book was called The Indian War of Independence, 1857. The word ?first? is added through a sleight of hand. Marx never used the phrase. When his writings on British rule and the 1857 revolt were brought together and published in 1957, the publishers in Moscow called the collection The First War of Indian Independence.

 In a country like India, where myth-making is a thriving activity, it is perhaps too much to expect that the history of 1857 will be left to historians. The theory that a lie repeated often enough becomes the truth flourishes outside fascism as well.

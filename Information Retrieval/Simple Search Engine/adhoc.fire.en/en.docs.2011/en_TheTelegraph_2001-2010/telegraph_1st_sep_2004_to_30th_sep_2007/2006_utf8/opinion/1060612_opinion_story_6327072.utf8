 Caught in a wrangle

 Sir ? The West Indian cricket captain, Brian Lara, committed a shameful act during the first test match between India and the West Indies (?Play crosses the line?, June 7). What authority did Lara have to ask the batsman, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, to leave the ground after Darren Ganga held on to a catch close to the boundary line? Lara has many followers among young cricketers and he should be careful about the example he sets to them. Lara?s behaviour seemed to suggest that a cricket match is akin to war and that aggression is all that counts on the field. By acting in the manner he did, Lara not only violated the laws of cricket but also the spirit of the game. Dhoni?s dismissal could not be adequately ascertained even after it was referred to the third umpire. On occasions such as this, the usual practice is to give the batsman the benefit of doubt. The West Indian captain should have kept this in mind and allowed Dhoni to carry on with his innings. Lara probably acted in this manner because he feared that Dhoni might be taking the game away from the West Indians. Unfortunately, the umpires did not report him to the match referee, as they thought that it was a one-off incident. But this should not have been the case and Lara?s actions shouldn?t have gone unpunished. Are we to assume then that the umpires were influenced by Lara?s larger-than-life image? The role of the match referee also comes under the scanner in this context. After all, isn?t it true that those who condone a fault are as guilty as those who commit it?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The showdown between Brian Lara and the umpire, Asad Rauf, should have been avoided. There was no need for Lara to snatch the ball away from the umpire?s hands and make his displeasure known. Moreover, M.S. Dhoni?s dismissal raises doubts about certain regulations followed by the International Cricket Council. Why should the rules permit a captain to put pressure on an umpire in order to claim a dismissal ? In Dhoni?s case, since the third umpire had failed to deliver a clear verdict, the batsman should have been declared not out. It pains to see match referees acting in a partisan manner. If an Indian player had behaved in the manner Lara did, he would have surely incurred the wrath of the authorities concerned.

 Sir ? Brian Lara tarnished his clean image at Antigua when he misbehaved with the umpire during the first test between India and West Indies. Lara?s action is the worst thing that a playing captain can do during a cricket match. It seems that the West Indies skipper told Dhoni that the fielder, Darren Ganga, had confirmed that he had taken the catch cleanly. This was clearly a lie as Dhoni himself informed that Ganga was unsure if he had stepped on the cardboard on the boundary. Now cardboard is not soft material so how could Ganga not know whether he had gone over the line?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Inefficient and irresponsible umpiring was responsible for generating a lot of tension during the Antigua test. However, it was always upto the umpires to decide whether M.S. Dhoni was out or not. They had no business asking the fielding captain to have a say in the matter.

 Sir ? There are many cricketing greats who have been known for their sporting attitude. Remember Gundappa Vishwanath recalling the Englishman, Bob Taylor, after the latter was declared out wrongly, only to see Taylor score a century and win the match for his team. It is obvious that Brian Lara, despite his greatness as a batsman, is not in the ranks of Vishy when it comes to sporting behaviour.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The advantage gained by the Indian batsmen after posting a huge total on day three was spoiled by India?s inept bowling performance. Although some may rue the fact that Indian bowlers could not scalp the last three wickets despite bowling 21 overs, I think that the game slipped away from India?s hands in the first session itself. When the hosts began their second innings on the last day of the test match, the manner in which the likes of Munaf Patel, S. Sreesanth and V.R.V. Singh bowled to the West Indian batsmen showed that they were more interested in containing the batsmen than taking wickets. There were problems with Indian field placements as well. This resulted in Chris Gayle getting a freeway with the bat. Nevertheless, due credit must be given to the Caribbean tail-enders for the manner in which they negotiated the Indian bowing attack. The Indian captain, Rahul Dravid, was disappointing in the way he handled his bowlers. The question whether India has done the right thing by leaving out the in-form Ajit Agarkar would be answered by the time the test series is over.

 Yours faithfully,

 Make a killing

 Sir ? The Bharatiya Janata Party leader, Vinay Katiyar, recently made an offer of Rs 1 lakh to any civilian who kills a militant (?Kill a rebel, win 1 lakh from BJP?, June 9). This may prove to be a useful step in curbing militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. However, Katiyar?s offer is far from perfect. It is not easy to identify militants who usually travel incognito. Besides, if Katiyar?s plan is put to use, criminals may murder innocent people and claim to have killed militants. Katiyar would have been better off keeping his faith in state agencies that are trying their level best to rid the Kashmir valley of terrorists.

 Yours faithfully,

Mohammed Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Letters to Editor

 Villain of the piece

 Sir Marco Materazzis comments during the World Cup finals, whatever they might have been, still make Zinedine Zidanes head-butting inexcusable. Zidanes action, given his experience and maturity, was unprofessional and irresponsible, especially as swearing and abuse are common in football. Fifas summoning of Materazzi for a hearing is even stranger. Maradona scored against England with his hand in 1986 and later admitted it. If Fifa did not feel the need to punish him, it shouldnt be questioning Materazzi either.

 Yours faithfully,

 Hand in glove

 Sir Nowadays, no crime is committed without the knowledge of the police or the politician. However, crimes that lead to scandals like Bofors, St Kitts or the Telgi scam are different from that which killed Shivani Bhatnagar, Jessica Lal, Nitish Katara or Priyadarshini Mattoo. But even in these cases, there is no denying the strong link between the criminals and the administration. The police and the political establishment feed on each other. Corrupt legislators and the recruitment of police officers through political connections are the main reasons why justice is not delivered. The reservation policy is only aggravating the situation since it puts no emphasis on merit. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir When Abdul Karim Telgi was arrested, the police had recommended that the case be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation. However, the case was given to an agency, which is a creature of the state government. The case languished for years till the government of India brought in the CBI. Why was this allowed to happen? During the narco-analysis test, conducted in a Bangalore hospital three years ago, Telgi himself had admitted that politicians were the backbone of his business. A substantial majority of this nation believes the scamsters statements to be true. The political motives now being attributed to Telgis revelations are a diversionary tactic.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The former chief minister of Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar, is already a tainted figure in Indian politics. So the allegations levelled at him by another fraudster, Abdul Karim Telgi, do not come as a surprise. If Sharad Pawar feels that he is not guilty, then why does he not move a defamation case against Telgi? Perhaps the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, will show as much interest as he did in K. Natwar Singhs case and order an inquiry into this one as well.

 Yours faithfully, 

 T.R. Anand,

 Sir Our country has two sets of law, one for the common man and the other for those who are rich and powerful. Had a commoner been named in the narco-analysis test of Abdul Karim Telgi, he would have been subjected to vigorous interrogation by the investigating agencies. But the CBI has already given a clean chit to Sharad Pawar and Chhagan Bhujbal, considering their status and the power they wield. One wonders why, despite a scandal of such proportions, the government has failed to do away with the system of private vendors for the procurement of stamp papers. The authorities need to ensure that stamp papers are sold through bank branches, nationalized or private, and post offices. Those who are in charge of selling the stamp papers should work on the basis of commission. This will remove private vendors who often indulge in irregularities. Counters in courts and select government offices can also undertake the sale of these documents.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subhash C. Agrawal,

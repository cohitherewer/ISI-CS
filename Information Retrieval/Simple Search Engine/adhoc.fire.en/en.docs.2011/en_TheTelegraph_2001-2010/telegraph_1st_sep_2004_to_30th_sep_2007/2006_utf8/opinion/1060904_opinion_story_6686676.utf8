 Letters to Editor

 The peoples director

 Sir If R.K. Laxman depicted the life of the common man through his cartoons, Hrishikesh Mukherjee did the same through his films. Mukherjee was fortunate to have started his career assisting the legendary Bimal Roy in Do Bigha Zameen. Having learnt the ropes of film-making from Roy, Mukherjee went on to direct many a classic, including Musafir. Most of his films tried to capture the nuances of Indian society. Mukherjees versatility as a director can be judged from the fact that both his serious films and comedies were a commercial success. Mukherjees movies provided for clean, wholesome entertainment and, unlike todays movies filled with sex and violence, his films could be watched by the entire family. There is no doubt that Mukherjees death has left a void in the film industry which will be very difficult to fill.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With the passing away of Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the Indian film industry has lost one of its stalwarts. Mukherjee belongs to the Bimal Roy school of film-making and most of his films reflect a few of his gurus touches. Yet it would not be wrong to say that Mukherjee was largely successful in putting his own stamp of class and vision on his own films. In his long and illustrious career, he directed most of the big stars, including Raj Kapoor, Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Balraj Sahni, Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan. Mukherjees films also exposed many of the social ills. In Satyakam, he raised his voice against corruption; Namakharam depicted a society divided on class lines; while Anand was a sensitive portrayal of a terminal patient in his last few days. Mukherjee had a fine sense of humour and this was evident in his films like Chupke Chupke, Khoobsurat and the memorable Golmaal. All in all, Mukherjee for his many talents was a deserved winner of the presidents medal in 1960.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Most of Hrishikesh Mukherjees films dealt with the Indian way of life. The characters, dresses and the music in the movies are typically Indian. His films also cast a sympathetic look at human aspirations and issues that affected the common man. The fact that Mukherjee averaged just one film per year speaks volumes about his dedication as a film producer and a director. Later in his career, he went on to direct some memorable television serials too. 

 Luckily for him, Mukherjee got the recognition he deserved from the government he was the recipient of the Padma Bhusan and he also won a National award. He also served as the chief of the censor board for sometime. Our young film and music directors can learn a lot from Mukherjee and the style of direction he followed. That way, at least, Hindi film directors would not end up making poor copies of foreign films .

 Sir Hrishikesh Mukherjee had a keen interest in the intricacies of human life and tried to present them in a simple and humourous manner. In other words, his films were a study in the predicaments and ironies of middleclass lives, something which gave a philosophical bent to his film music. It was his capacity to portray complexities that turned him into a darling of the masses. There is no doubt that Mukherjee managed to describe lifes humdrum affairs in details and blend them perfectly with the requirements of the market. This is what has made Mukherjees films immortal in the history of Indian cinema.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With Hrishikesh Mukherjees death, an epoch in the history of Indian cinema has come to a close. Mukherjee was one of the directors who cared to make meaningful films unlike many others who ply the same trade. The credit for turning artistes like Rajesh Khanna, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri and Dharmendra into superstars squarely goes to him. He is truly a legend and it is unlikely that the actors whom he directed or his fans will forget him in the days to come. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 T.R. Anand,

 For a breath of fresh air

 Sir The Calcutta corporation should consider steps to reduce congestion and the lack of greenery in the city. There are very few parks and the ones that are there are very small and cluttered with para clubs. Recently, I also saw a restaurant coming up in a park in south Calcutta. This could only happen in Calcutta where the city fathers have no time to think about the citys welfare. The Left Front government is busy signing agreements with private entrepreneurs for the construction of satellite towns, which will come up in the future, adding to the congestion. What happens to Calcutta seems to be nobodys concern. One way of controlling the overcrowding is to stop the building of multi-storeyed apartments. If necessary, the existing rules should be changed in the interest of the citizens.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Arun Sankar Gupta,

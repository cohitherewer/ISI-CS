 WHAT GOES BETWEEN THE COVERS

 Critical acclaim

 Begin with a simple axiom: more bad books are published than good books. Put it a little differently, there is a negative correlation between the quality of a book and the level of its sales. Every publisher?s editor knows this and the critical reading public knows it, too. Hence the question: why does the deluge of bad books continue to overwhelm us?

 But first, how do you distinguish between good and bad books when the only criterion of excellence today is sales and profits. Much as we might dislike the stranglehold of the market over all things else, the fact remains that the bottom-line matters at the end of day; ignore it, and the publisher goes down or is gobbled up by the big fish in the business.

 So, it is absolutely essential that a book has sales potential, which means a consideration of many interlinked factors: language, style, relevance of the subject, packaging and marketing strategies. At the very least, a book must recover costs within a year of publication. Given the cost of money and warehousing space, any latitude like giving one more time to unload stocks can be fatal because new titles will edge out the old. The rate of return becomes important, if only to maintain a healthy cash flow. This is the minimum requirement for any book, good or bad.

 If you keep the financial aspects aside for a moment, how do you distinguish good from bad and why do bad books dominate the publishing scene?

 In the Indian context, a good book means simplicity of language, the relevance of the subject and its timeliness. (Entertainment value has also been thrown in as a factor, but that is for another article later.) These three criteria need to be defined further but a working definition would be something like this.

 Simplicity of language would mean working within a vocabulary range of 3,000 words ? the frequency of word usage has been provided in many modern dictionaries as well as their alternative meanings and their usage ? without too many compound sentences. Also, language must stick as closely to the spoken word as possible; the written language that used to be taken as the real source of authority, while the spoken language as derived from it, is out. The real situation, that which the common reader understands and appreciates, is the other way round.

 Relevance has a very wide canvas that ranges from entertainment to simple information useful for professional courses. Timeliness, too, can mean a whole lot of things but essentially something that is ?the air? or is ?a climate of opinion?, and would be so for some time to come.

 All these factors have to be packaged well, that is, good printing, paper and binding with an attractive cover that catches the eye. Some critics have emphasized price as a crucial factor for increased sales, but it has been proved time and again that lower prices do not increase the number of copies sold: relevance, production quality and timing matter.

 If the line between good and bad is clear why do books that serve no purpose get published? Two reasons. First, there are few editors who have taste, literary discrimination and/or passion for the work undertaken. All they have in mind is that the ?production quotas? (the number of new titles to be published) are fulfilled in the year. It is a mechanistic view and therefore anything goes. Second, there isn?t much literary talent floating around; the best writers have gone ?abroad?, not merely because there is more money but much greater professionalism. In the absence of a pool of talent, editors accept what comes their way.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOCAL FLAVOUR

 People try to rediscover their identities in many ways. Reviving old names is often the politicians? way of gaining popular support. Given the tendency among state governments in India to change the names of cities and towns to their original, local forms, the renaming of Assam is nothing unusual. But rarely has such a major decision by a government been accepted so widely. This clearly is Mr Tarun Gogoi?s major achievement. He has pulled off something of a coup without creating a flutter. Neither the politicians nor the people at large seemed to have any idea of his government planning such a move. They were taken by surprise but could react only positively to it. This shows that the chief minister had correctly anticipated the popular sentiment on the issue. The decision helps the state shed a colonial legacy; more important, it sharpens a sub-national consciousness. By contrast, the questions that some scholars have raised over the historical accuracy of the new name, Asom, would appear to be inconsequential exercises in sophistry. 

 Politically, it has been an astute move by Mr Gogoi. He has a difficult job on hand in the coming assembly elections. His government has been accused of doing little to check the influx of Bangladeshis into Assam or to deport those who are staying there illegally. The Congress has long been accused of using illegal migrants as vote banks. Opposition parties play on the people?s fears that the Bangladeshi settlers are changing Assam?s demography. An attempt to bolster the Assamese identity could be Mr Gogoi?s answer to these charges. However, he would do well not to overplay the ethnic card. Assam, like most other states, is a mosaic of many ethnic and linguistic groups. Promoting one ethnic identity at the expense of others cannot be a sensible policy for any government. The caution is especially relevant to a state that has a history of violent ethnic conflicts. The Ahoms are the state?s majority community and, therefore, give it the new name. But several other communities have large populations in the state. Mr Gogoi should be happy that the Bodo Sahitya Sabha has welcomed the new name, as the Assam Sahitya Sabha did. Although the opposition parties too have supported the decision, Mr Gogoi should have taken them into confidence before finalizing the move. That would have been more in keeping with the spirit of democracy.

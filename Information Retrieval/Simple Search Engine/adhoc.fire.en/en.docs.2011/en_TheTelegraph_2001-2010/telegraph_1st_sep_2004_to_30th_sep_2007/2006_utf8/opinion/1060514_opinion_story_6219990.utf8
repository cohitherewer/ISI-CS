The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE THIRD EYE

 Time was when cricket was considered to be synonymous with fair play. Competition, the influence of money and betting, and a general decline in standards have all contributed to reducing cricket to just another game from the elevated status of the noblest of them all. The decline in ethical norms in the cricketing arena has recently been highlighted by the allegations made by Mr Steve Bucknor. These allegations could have been ignored had they not been made by a person generally regarded by most players as one of the best umpires the game has seen in recent times. Mr Bucknor, with years of experience behind him, has accused television producers and cameramen of doctoring evidence. He says that depending upon the stature of players, sometimes pictures are removed or tampered with. This, he says, makes trouble for the umpires by seriously undermining their credibility with players and officials. Not surprisingly, Mr Bucknor?s charges have been denied by cricket officials and TV companies who regularly cover tests and one-day matches. The denials cannot take away from the gravity of the allegations. 

 What Mr Bucknor?s statement does is to reopen the discussion on the use of technology in umpiring decisions. The conventional wisdom on the subject welcomes the use of slow-motion cameras and the third umpire in judging appeals. The laws of cricket have been amended to include only close line calls within the jurisdiction of the third umpire. There is a body of opinion which asserts that not just close line calls, but even bat-pad catches, faint snicks, and most definitely leg before wicket decisions should all be brought under the purview of the third umpire, and it should be mandatory for the umpires on the field to consult the third umpire on all such appeals. The argument is that the technology is available and full use should be made of it to eliminate all error. Against this is the contrary view advocated by a minority, which says that umpires should be left to judge what they see through their naked eye without the aid of any kind of technological device. This view does not rule out the incidence of error but it believes that in the course of a game errors will cancel out. 

 While the use of the slow-motion camera and the third umpire has enhanced viewer interest and also reduced controversy, it has made life for umpires much more difficult. Every single decision of an umpire is now under public scrutiny. And often players and viewers forget that what can be seen in slow motion would be invisible to an umpire. It has also been proved that technology is never neutral, and the adage that the camera never lies is not necessarily true. Pictures can be doctored and, given the star orientation that cricket has acquired, it is possible that the available technology is being used to boost the stars. What had once seemed impossible has now become possible. When allegations of match-fixing were first made, most people said it was impossible. It is prudent to be careful and to remember that umpires have the most thankless task in the game.

 TIME TO REBUILD LIVES 

 Mala Fide 

 -MALVIKA SINGH 

 Delhi is once again in the throes 

 of having its shops and commercial establishments in residential 

 areas and other illegal operations sealed. However, municipalities 

 have, over the years, given permissions to people and establishments 

 against the rules in exchange for cash bribes and looked 

 the other way. All this has finally come home to roost and, 

 in the process of the unravelling of past misdemeanours, 

 many truths stand exposed. Builders who hand over properties 

 without legitimate completion certificates, who have taken 

 their clients to the cleaners are, without remorse, fighting 

 for their rights that are, in fact, the worst wrongs inflicted 

 on our cities. We are in an urban crisis, a mess that will 

 be very hard to clear.

 To begin with, there are multiple 

 authorities, all pulling in different directions, all reporting 

 to different points of power. The Delhi Development Authority, 

 mandated to protect the interests of government and therefore 

 the people of the city, has got completely entangled with 

 the builder community. There is no watchdog anymore as the 

 two move ahead with a common agenda. Exploitation is rampant, 

 rules are bent and cities are being ravaged as big money 

 changes hands. Government-administered municipalities too 

 want their share, and turn a blind eye to the rape going 

 on under their noses. There are too many vested interest 

 groups and too much opposition to anyone attempting to overhaul 

 this corrupt system. To rock this boat one has to lock horns 

 with the high and mighty, the authority of politicians, 

 administrators, builders and traders, municipalities and 

 the law and order machine. Change would mean stepping out 

 and working for the citizen something no authority has 

 done in India for decades. No one seems willing and ready.

 Hopeless age

 The failure of our system lies 

 in our inability to make administrations and municipalities 

 accountable. There is no functioning mechanism that ensures 

 the delivery of all the ingredients of a civil society. 

 Sadly, no elected government has made this a priority. As 

 no leader stands up and denounces the horror on public platforms 

 or the media, the exploiters and manipulators of this fragile, 

 subservient and weak system, get away with murder. Citizens 

 want to hear their leaders abuse wrongdoings. They want 

 their leaders to take a strong stand on issues that degrade 

 our social mores. 

 When the corruption is all-pervasive, 

 it is easier to lay down a new paradigm, a fresh parameter 

 and enforce a mandate that will restore values and ethics 

 that have faded over the past few decades. All it needs 

 is guts, minus the greed to remain in the chair at the cost 

 of the nation and its growth and development.

 For Delhi, a sensible master plan 

 needs to be devised within a short time, without caveats. 

 Politicians and their babus must not be the architects 

 of the plan. Urban planners, conservationists, historians, 

 sociologists, engineers and representatives of citizen groups 

 a multidisciplinary mix of professionals should be mandated 

 to produce a blueprint. Thereafter, no deviations should 

 be permitted. A review and upgradation of the plan should 

 happen fifteen or more years later. Any encroachment on 

 public or community space should be made a cognizable offence. 

 What is done within ones private space should be governed 

 by simple, intelligent and tried norms. 

 Let us go back to the patterns 

 we have from our civilized past, a past where planned townships 

 and cities were the envy of the world, a time when skill 

 and expertise dominated, which remain sturdy examples, standing 

 the test and ravages of time. From that legacy sinking down 

 to the present day DDA is a shame. These 60 years of India, 

 when excavated in the future, will tell a sad and hopeless 

 story of our age.

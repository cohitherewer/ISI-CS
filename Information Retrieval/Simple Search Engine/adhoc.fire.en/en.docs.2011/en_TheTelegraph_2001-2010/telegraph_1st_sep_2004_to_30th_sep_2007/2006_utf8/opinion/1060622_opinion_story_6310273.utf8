 THE PUZZLE OF INDIA?S GROWTH RATE 

The post-1991 economic reforms in India has been ridden 

with quite a few crises. Achin Vanaik busts the myth of their so-called 

?success?

 No turn in the tide 

Given the worldwide media coverage, everybody surely 

knows by now that India is one of the faster growing countries in the world and 

has been so for some time. Those who have been the most ardent supporters of the 

1991 reforms would have us believe that this has been due to those very reforms. 

But the more level-headed and sober among the pro-liberalizers also realize that 

there is a huge problem with this simple-minded conventional media story. The 

break from what has been called the ?Hindu rate of growth? of 3.5 per cent took 

place not with the 1991 reforms but around 1980. It has also had to be accepted 

that not only was the average growth rate from 1991 to 2003 of around 5.7 per 

cent roughly equal to that for the 1980-90 period, but that the post-reform growth 

rate was based on a different and somewhat worrying change in the sectoral composition. 

Average growth rates in the primary and secondary sectors were lower than during 

the Eighties while that in the services sector was higher.

The question that arises then is how to explain this 

leap forward? It becomes impossible to give too much credit to the post-1991 reforms. 

A supporter of those reforms can argue that the rise in growth rates during the 

Eighties was unsustainable ? witness the balance-of-payments crisis that led to 

the 1991 reforms in the guise of International Monetary Fund loan conditionalities 

or the ?structural adjustment programme?. However, not only is there dispute about 

the seriousness of that ?crisis? and the reforms introduced ostensibly to deal 

with it (critics called the 1991 reforms a ?long term ?solution? to a short-term 

problem?), but one still has to explain why the growth take-off took place around 

1980, whatever one?s views about its sustainability? Strong critics of the 1991 

reform thrust call it a neoliberal turn. Strong supporters usually call it a very 

welcome pro-market and pro-competition turn in economic policies.

But if the leap in growth rates ? the most important 

and widely accepted marker of the ?success? of the 1991 reforms ? took place a 

decade earlier, then reform supporters must either claim that the crucial pro-market 

or ?neoliberal? policy turn took place earlier, or that the earlier turn was not 

a pro-market or neoliberal turn but something else, and that the 1991 turn towards 

a greater use of the market was essentially an extension and continuation of that 

more important earlier turn. The name given to that earlier apparently-more-decisive 

turn is that it was a pro-business, rather than pro-market, turn; that India has 

not now embarked on a neoliberal or stron- gly pro-market/pro-competition economic 

project as so many of its critics and supporters tend to believe.

The problem with this claim is that it downplays the 

significance of the post-1991 reforms. They did represent a ?neoliberal? break 

regardless of the fact that they did not lead to a trend break upwards in average 

growth rates. Throughout the world, from China to Europe, there has been a significant 

shift rightwards in economic policies rightly characterized as a neoliberal turn 

although under no circumstances are the economies of western Europe or China anywhere 

near as market-determined as the economies of North America. 

What justifies calling their economic orientations 

a neoliberal one is that despite very different starting points and therefore 

quite different outcomes/end points, the direction of policy changes and the basic 

philosophy underlying that shift of direction is basically the same everywhere. 

In India what made the Nineties and the early years of this millennium different 

from the Eighties was a profound ideological shift greatly influenced of course 

by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ?socialist? project.

The new ideological-philosophical elements were an 

obsession with raising growth rates as the single most important goal of economic 

policy and the master key to development; and the subordination of all considerations 

regarding inequalities of consumption, income and wealth to the priority of raising 

growth rates. In any case, belief in the validity of the Kuznet?s Curve (a disputed 

and criticized technical claim that high growth rates increase inequality to begin 

with, but eventually it decreases it) could provide a good conscience to those 

who might be embarrassed by this issue of growing inequalities. A belief that 

bad as market failures are (in the neoclassical economic tradition this is always 

a feature and is behind the concerns of such thinkers as Amartya Sen), they are 

much less of a problem than government failures. Hence the new ?logic? of systematically 

withdrawing the state from economic activity via steady and cumulative 

privatization of public assets, reduction of public investment and abandonment 

of Keynesian type macro-economic policies and the thinking that went behind them. 

In this scheme of things, public enemy number one 

? to be avoided at all costs ? becomes inflation, not unemployment or underemployment. 

Severing all connection between productivity contributions and income and wealth 

rewards except for wage-earners, or workers who, of course, must be criticized 

(especially if they are unionized) for getting too much while contributing too 

little.

These last two principles are vital, for without them 

there can be no justification for policies that sustain the extraordinary financialization 

of the Indian and world economies in ways whereby there is now little connection 

between financial activity and wealth accumulation for so many, and their non-existent 

or utterly negligible contribution to the real economy of production and distribution 

of actual goods and services. 

And, of course, creditors (overwhelmingly the already 

rich) looking to make quick and big gains in the myriad ways now available on 

financial markets, hate inflation more than anything else. The post-1991 reforms 

are a ?neoliberal? turn marking a real break with the past! The claim that there 

was around the Eighties a ?pro-business? turn forgets that the mild policy shift 

that could go under that name took place not around 1980 but in 1984, with the 

advent of the Rajiv Gandhi government.

So what explains the rise in growth rates in India? 

No doubt a combination of factors should be used to explain this. Trade liberalization 

and industrial de-regulation have both helped, but they have also given rise to 

other problems. But the most important single factor that prevails throughout 

the whole period from around 1980 till today is simply the break from the Indian 

past (between 1947-80) in overall investment rates and therefore in the investment-gross 

domestic product ratio. There is no significant change in total factor productivity 

between the Eighties and the post-1991 period. Higher labour productivity is counterbalanced 

by lower capital productivity, that is, greater capital intensity in all sectors, 

including agriculture, industry and the services sub-sectors having high growth 

rates. 

Also, while private investment has risen, public investment 

has declined. This means unemployment and underemployment have grown significantly 

throughout India?s ?miracle? years. Between 1991 and 2003, savings rates between 

23 per cent and 26 per cent (of GDP) and investment rates between 24 per cent 

and 27 per cent were little different from the Eighties. What gives even greater 

power to this explanation is that the new acceleration in average annual Indian 

growth rates between 2003-04 and 2006-07 to around 7 per cent is accompanied by 

a corresponding leap for this period in average annual savings and investment 

rates to around 29 per cent and 30 per cent respectively.

But unlike China or east Asia, the Indian growth story 

is different in crucial ways. Employment absorption has steadily diminished especially 

in the all-important agricultural sector. Overall growth is led by the services 

sector whereas the east Asian miracle stories were explained by the dynamic performances 

of the manufacturing sector. Inequalities of income and wealth of all kinds ? 

urban-rural, between states, between classes ? have all grown steadily. Poverty 

remains deep and widespread. The state of welfare ? social security, healthcare 

and good education, public hygiene, safe drinking water ? remains dismal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PRO AND CONTRA

 In a parliamentary democracy, todays opposition is often yesterdays or tomorrows government. In Westminster, there is the practice of the opposition forming a shadow cabinet, which is nothing but a government in waiting. The implication is that the opposition should, while opposing the government and while trying to dislodge it, actually behave with responsibility and conduct itself in a manner befitting the republic. The opposition should be as loyal to the state as the government. In India, alas, this role of the opposition is honoured more in the breach. Here the opposition, irrespective of its political colour, opposes for the sake of opposing. A party which had pushed forward economic reforms when in government opposes the same programme when it is in opposition. Both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have been tarnished by this kind of irresponsibility. There are other parties, newcomers to the democratic ethos and its conventions, which make a mockery of the unwritten codes of behaviour that are the hallmarks of parliamentary democracy.

 Two recent examples of gross violation of democratic and parliamentary conventions can be cited. One is the infamous example of Mr Natwar Singh, who tabled a privilege motion against the prime minister, although of his own party. That the motion was disallowed only underlines its absurdity. Mr Singh could have articulated his indignation against his own prime minister by resigning from the party. Instead, he chose to do something completely contrary to all established parliamentary conventions. The other example is the decision of the National Democratic Alliance to boycott the speaker of the Lok Sabha. This was tantamount to abdicating the responsibilities of being in opposition. A debate between the treasury and the opposition benches is an integral part of a democratic polity. Vacant opposition benches make such a debate impossible. There can be exceptional situations when a party or a political formation is unhappy with the behaviour of the speaker. Such unhappiness must be expressed within the conventions of parliamentary practice. Boycotting parliament is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the veteran of many parliamentary battles, realized this and he voiced his unhappiness through a letter to the speaker.

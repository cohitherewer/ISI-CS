 SLICE OF LIFE FROZEN IN TIME

 INDIAN PAINTING, THE GREAT MURAL 

 TRADITION (Mapin, Rs 3,500) by Mira Seth is a well-researched 

 study of murals in the ancient caves, temples and monasteries 

 of India. The author analyses the wall paintings by placing 

 them in the context of their times. Thus the paintings depicting 

 stories from religious texts are also seen to exhibit a 

 fascinating realism, providing insights into contemporary 

 life. The entire range of the tradition of mural painting 

 is represented in the first 10 pages through representative 

 murals from south, north and west India. The characteristics 

 of the murals change according to the schools that produced 

 them but there are also discernible similarities, indicating 

 the mutual influencing of the different traditions. This 

 mural from Ajanta, Cave xviii, depicts a couple in conversation. 

 The naturalism in the relaxed poses of the couple is noteworthy.

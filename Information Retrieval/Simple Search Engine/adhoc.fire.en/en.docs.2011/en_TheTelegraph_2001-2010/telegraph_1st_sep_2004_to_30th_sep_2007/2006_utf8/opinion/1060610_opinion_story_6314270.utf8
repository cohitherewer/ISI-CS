 Letters to Editor

 Fly high at a low cost

 Sir? The British prime minister, Tony Blair, choosing to fly in a low-cost airline while returning from Italy should be a lesson to the Central and state ministers of India (?Fly cheap with pride, even a PM does so?, June 6). Indian politicians brazenly fly executive class and stay in five star hotels at the cost of the taxpayer with total disregard to the fiscal status of the country. The parliament needs to pass a bill which will make it mandatory for the ministers to travel low cost and stay in the state-sponsored guest houses in order to save the exchequer thousands of rupees. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Striking hard

 Sir ? The attempt to storm the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh?s head quarters in Nagpur by members of the Lashkar-e-Toiba shortly before dawn proves that the militants had laid the plan for their attack with care (?Terror at Sangh sanctorum gate?, June 2). The militants tried to take the guards by surprise by deciding to strike at the crack of dawn. Not just that, they dressed up in police uniform and arrived in a white ambassador with a red beacon to fool the policemen on duty. Thankfully, the prompt action taken by the security guards saved the the day. Had it been otherwise, communal tensions would have flared up in different parts of the country, and this was something that the terrorists hoped for. After all, it is clear that militant groups are intent on destroying India?s secular fabric, by organizing such attacks. Little wonder then that militant groups want the peace initiatives between India and Pakistan to fail for that would mean an end to their violent ways. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir? The increase in attacks on Hindu organizations and their places of worship makes it obvious that apart from fanning communal strife, the terrorists groups operating in India also want to weaken the forces of Hinduism in the country. Instead of mouthing rhetoric about maintaining peace, the government should take concrete steps to combat Islamic terrorism. 

 The Manmohan Singh government has allowed militancy to assume menacing proportions by failing to take adequate measures to root out terror. The soft policies adopted by the United Progressive Alliance have ensured that ordinary Indians remain at the receiving end of terror.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? An attack of the kind that took place on the RSS headquarters could not have been carried out without the support of local Muslims. Our netas pamper minorities for their votes and they reciprocate by helping the networks of terror. The Nagpur police deserve praise for their courage in foiling the evil designs of the terrorists. 

 Yours faithfully,

G.B. Srikantiah, Bangalore 

 Fall from grace

 Sir ? The once noble profession of medicine has fallen into disrepute because of errant doctors (?Doctor arrested in murder case?, June 4). Today, medics make patients undergo expensive tests to get a commission from laboratories. They have also been known to prescribe wrong treatment. Now a cardiologist practising in Raniganj has been arrested in connection with the murder of a sex-worker. One wonders what murder and prostitution has in common with doctors. Section 7.5 of the Code of Ethics regulations mandates that the licence of doctors involved in ?moral turpitude or criminal act? would be cancelled. But given the track record of the state medical council, one suspects that the guilty doctor should have no reasons to worry about his future.

 Yours faithfully,

 K. Saha, Columbus, US

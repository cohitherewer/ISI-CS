 THE GREATER GOOD OF A SMALL NUMBER

 The prime ministers attempt to make Muslims beneficiaries of development seeks to promote sectional interests, writes Sumanta Sen

 Peace overtures

 The prime minister has issued a directive that minorities should constitute at least 15 per cent of the beneficiaries of any development project. As things stand, there can be no quarrel with this. Muslims are among the more economically backward in the country, and Manmohan Singh must have kept that in mind. Yet, the communal divide has become so deep that it is not easy to accept anything at face value.

 The timing of the directive makes one suspicious. Among the states going to the polls early next year is Uttar Pradesh, where the communal factor is as important as caste. The Congress is desperate to make some sort of a comeback in the state where it once ruled the roost. One way in which it can make that happen is by cutting into Maulana Mulayam Singh Yadavs Muslim support base. Would it be too wrong to assume that together with the general issue of minority backwardness, the prime minister had this in mind as well? It is difficult to believe that this is not the case. Particularly as this is the season of minority- wooing. There is concern for Dalit Muslims all of a sudden, though this is a contradiction in terms, for a person can either be a Dalit or a Muslim. But then, rational thinking has to be a casualty when the objective is to somehow please voters. So in Lucknow, Mulayam Singh Yadav is busy legislating on these lines. He has also given a clean chit to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India. On the other side of the picture, the Bharatiya Janata Party has geared itself up to play the mandir card once again.

 There is nothing unusual about what Mulayam Singh Yadav or Rajnath Singh and other saffronites are doing. They are going by their own chosen scripts. But the Union government is another matter, particularly as it was formed on the specific assurance that secularism would be the cornerstone of its polices. It may be argued that insisting that Muslims get a better deal does not offend the spirit of secularism, but it does. By specifically mentioning Muslims, the prime minister did create the impression that he was also being communal, albeit in a reverse order. It would have perhaps been more appropriate if he had insisted that the benefit of development went to all people, irrespective of caste or religion which, in any case, is what any government should aim for.

 Strangely enough, the left parties have gone along with the prime minister on this, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee being one of the first chief ministers to issue instructions that the Centres directive will be implemented. Did it not strike him that this insistence on a particular religious group was not in keeping with secular principles? Indeed, this is playing into the hands of the Hindu communalists as it will only strengthen their campaign that all that the secular parties are up to is to pamper Muslims.

 Also, in West Bengal, which Muslims did the chief minister have in mind? There are two distinct groups the Urdu- or Hindi-speaking ones and those whose mother tongue is Bengali. The former are mostly to be found in the central districts of Calcutta and the waterfront areas. Like all citizens, they are more at the mercy of the municipal authority than that of the state government. There is no evidence to suggest that they are in any way discriminated against in the matter of providing drinking water or other civic amenities. Any complaint heard in Kidderpore or Entally is the same made in Kalighat or Ekdalia. The mayor or any other city father will be the first to protest at any suggestion that Muslims are not benefiting from their goodwill as much as the others.

 It is the same in the districts where the overwhelming number of Muslims are Bengali. Actually, because of this common language, the ordinary Muslim in a village does not really feel he is different in any way from his Hindu neighbour and it goes to the credit of the state that no government has ever sought to see the communities as being different from one another. Instructions like the one under discussion can only be counter-productive. They will, instead, create in the mind a sense of difference which is actually not there. Who can guarantee that Muslim communalists would not grab this to create discontent by conjuring up cases of discrimination? And they do have their opposite numbers in the majority camp who are always eager to complicate things. Similarly, any special attention to the Urdu-speaking in Calcutta can only help further widen a gap that exists because of the language difference.

 Muslims themselves are not pleased with such mindless attempts to keep them happy. For the most part, they want to be seen as members of the whole community. At times, the problems in that direction are created by leaders of their own community for example, during times when they frown at madrassah education getting modernized or at polio immunization programmes. Any such obstacle towards integration can, however, be removed only through patient campaigning by political parties. Treating them as hothouse plants certainly does not help, and marking them out for social benefits does amount to such treatment.

 The prime minister would have done better if he had taken all implementing agencies, both Central and state, to task for not ensuring that the fruits of well-intentioned projects reach the people. That is the main problem in this country. The people, whether Hindus, Muslims or of other religious faith, hear of things being planned for them but rarely get to see the efforts. It is the same with Dalits, tribals, everyone. Doesnt the West Bengal chief minister know what has happened in his state with below-the-poverty-line cards? Can he say for certain that schemes such as pension for widows have been a total success? There are a whole lot of Centrally-funded welfare projects which regularly go haywire and it is not just the minorities who suffer.

 Shedding tears for the minorities in public may be a good way of getting votes but it is bad politics, in the larger sense of the term. Also, are votes really got that way for all times to come? If that was so, then in Uttar Pradesh Mulayam Singh Yadav would not have had the mortification to see sections of his Muslim supporters deserting him for Mayavati, who has proved herself better at playing the duping game.

 Everybody talks of India being one nation. But leaders have to work towards building a single nation, instead of seeking to promote sectional interests. And that, too, in the name of secularism which should insist that the state takes no note of differences in terms of religious faith.

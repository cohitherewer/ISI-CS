 THE POWER OF SILENCE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Demolitions ? the new mantra that the ?authority? in urban India seems to be obsessed with. Wholesale corruption has been an intrinsic part of the urbanscape for as long as I can remember. It sickened one then as it sickens one now. Municipalities grew gross and ugly, battening on this extortion. From top to bottom, everyone knew this disgusting reality was taking root. Leaders and the courts did nothing at all to stop the degradation of our habitat in its tracks.

 Corrupt practices were endorsed by the silence from the power hierarchy, the institutions that were mandated to preserve the environment and the rule of law. Government servants betrayed India and defaulted on their oath of office. Worse, they were allowed by the top leadership of India to break the law. They were above the law, much like the colonizers of yore, and the voting constituents were lawless if they were honest. India has worsened and regressed with time, and nearly sixty years down the road, the total anarchy and break down of our towns and cities, and therefore our lives, is a frightening truth that we have to confront.

 Our rather shaky, defensive and guilty leadership along with their administrators, are now running amuck thoughtlessly sans intelligence. Demolitions have become a free-for-all where monies are continuing to be extorted to delay the destruction of one building here, a mall there, a barsati somewhere else. The courts too are enjoying playing executive instead of the game called jurisprudence. The failed, corrupt and inept executive is ignoring the courts, using delay tactics to buy time and money.

 Virus of anarchy

 It is imperative for us to restore our cities and save them from the all-consuming and suffocating virus that has made all living spaces into slums that are undignified and anarchic. However, yet again, those conducting the ?demolitions? have no plan for the future, for the alternatives, for the growth of our towns and cities. There is zero creative thinking on urban issues. There is no attempt to write sane and contemporary laws that should govern our everyday lives. All that serious thought requires brain power, alas not muscle and money power, something sorely lacking in our leadership and administrative sphere. That is India?s trag- edy. Those with care, commitment, ideas and solutions are outside government and do not want any association with corruption. 

 Why has land not been allocated for commercial enterprise? Why were shops and establishments permitted to function for decades illegally? Where are those corrupt extortionists who represented government and allowed business where it was not to be? Why are they not demolished? Why is the prime minister not calling for the real cleansing operation? Why this cosmetic exercise?

 Manmohan Singh needs to make sure, as a symbolic beginning, that his family of cabinet colleagues voluntarily ?demolish? the illegal structures in their plush properties in Lutyens?s Delhi. They must be ordered to rent offices in commercial complexes like us, taxpaying citizens, who have been exploited for nearly 60 years of independent India. They must be ordered by the prime minister to stop, with immediate effect, renting their quarters to all and sundry for free services.

 All of us could cite chapter and verse about how our friends and acquaintances have lived off the fat of government dispensation, sometimes rather shamelessly. It is being questioned. But a new danger looms. The executive, in a democracy, cannot abdicate its responsibility and the judiciary must not play the role of the executive. That will break the democratic foundation of this diverse, multi-cultural polity, impinge on our freedoms and set the clock back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Whose welfare is it anyway?

 Sir ? Two photographs appearing side by side in The Telegraph of April 3 speak volumes of the lopsided economic development taking place in our country. One of them shows a five-tier expensive cake being cut, while the other one captures the emaciated faces of the scalded bonded labourers of the brickfields in the suburbs of Calcutta. Unless immediate steps are taken to remove poverty and bonded labour, both will thrive and spread to towns and cities. It would pay to remember John F. Kennedy?s words, ?If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.? 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Justice fast

 Sir ? Whether against celebrity figures or squatters, the law of the land should be invoked evenly. The Sunil More case, and now the even swifter nine-day trial of B.H. Mohanty on charges of raping a German tourist, shows that a speedy justice is not impossible in India (?MBA student gets 7 years for rape?, April 13). Money and power should never be allowed to influence the wheels of justice. Many feel that the sentence slapped on the actor, Salman Khan, is harsh. But shouldn?t we be asking why it took eight years to conclude a simple poaching-case trial? With some faith being regenerated in the judicial system, the next case to be closely watched is the trial of Abhishek Kasliwal, the high-profile accused in Mumbai?s Worli rape case. For the police, this will be a test to prove that they have not made a habit of botching cases as they allegedly did in the Jessica Lal case.

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Mumbai

 Sir ? The fast-track court in Alwar, Rajasthan, has set an example by trying and passing a verdict in a case within one month. So has the magistrate?s court in Mumbai, by sentencing superstar Salman Khan to five years? rigorous imprisonment and fine for killing an endangered species of deer. For once, the celebrity status of the accused has not succeeded in influencing the law.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir ? The media these days is full of news of stern punishments being awarded to criminals, no matter what their social standing. The prompt verdict by the Alwar fast-track court in sentencing a young MBA student for raping a German national is certainly a trend-setter, given that the father of the accused is an influential IPS officer. One hopes that rape cases in future will be settled as expeditiously as this one.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? The increasing incidents of rape of foreigners are becoming a blot on India?s image as a tourist destination. It surely is a matter of shame for the people of India. On the one hand, we take pride in being one of the most culturally advanced nations of the world, as well as one that welcomes everyone with open arms, but on the other hand, when it comes to the safety and security of the foreigners visiting our cities and villages, we are savagely unconcerned.

 Students from many countries around the world look at India as a good place to study as they harbour the belief that India not only offers an environment with amazing diversity in culture, but also some of the best faculties in upcoming academic fields. Incidents like the rape of the German research student ? ironically by an MBA student who had earned her friendship ? could destroy overseas students? faith and interest in India. But thank god for small mercies such as the speedy ruling by the Alwar fast-track court, a proof of the Rajasthan government?s will to let it function effectively.

 Yours faithfully,

 Santanu Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 SHIFTING ABOUT TO NO END

 Malvika Singh

 What a strange game of uninspired musical chairs in the cabinet rejig! For India and the Indian people, this cabinet reshuffle need not have happened. The shifting about of men and women appear to be so utterly meaningless, so typical of how leadership detract from the real issues with superficial cosmetic changes. It is now quite obvious, through certain choices that the PM has made, that India is gradually but definitely becoming the most populous satellite country of the US. Some of the people who have been put in place will cheerfully follow the future diktats of supporting American policy on some critical international issues. The US should feel more comfortable. India will rapidly become yet another playground for ?terrorist? activity as it links itself to the US at a time other nations are moving away in an attempt to protect their sovereignty. We, on the other hand, are behaving like a large dopey poodle, confused and unable to behave like an equal partner as we bend over to touch the toes of an alien and arrogant power. Sadly, all this is at the risk of disturbing the communal peace.

 We have the Antulays of the world back in cabinet forcing our memory into the dismal past followed by some ministers of state without portfolios that only goes to show the lack of control, the scant thought process that seems to dominate governance today. Technocrats as rulers are all very well, but how about some real politicians playing clean politics? Or, are we going to be at the mercy of a bungling bureaucracy with the political class having abdicated its responsibility? 

 Small wonder that the Supreme Court has begun to play the role of a failed executive. This is very dangerous for the future. Manmohan Singh should make it his priority to ensure good governance. The shame meted out to the PM and his council of ministers with the Supreme Court judgement on the dissolution of the Bihar assembly has embarrassed even the supporters of this government, let them down because it smacks of a lack of integrity. 

 PM disposes

 Do we have to wait for the next reshuffle to witness the exit of the eighty-year-olds because their Rajya Sabha term expires by then and the PM will not ruffle too many feathers in this shuffle? This is no way to govern India and rectify the mess that prevails across the board except where entrepreneurial Indians have developed and grown despite government. To use cabinet berths merely to keep certain individuals in the party happy is a betrayal of the mandate. Do cabinet ministers comprehend the demands of their respective ministries? Are the choices made based on expertise or passionate interest? Or, do other criteria kick in? Are we going to remain in this intellectual vacuum, having to abide by the warped policies and norms of a confused and disparate governing council?

 Honesty and integrity have to be supported by action for India. This old and failed model of administrative structures, operations and mind set has to be replaced. New methods of policy-making, of governance have to be brought into play. The bureaucracy that has become a rusty machine, set in its ways, inept, exploitative and corroded, has to be dressed down, restructured and given a fresh set of rules to govern with. 

 Many believed the UPA, with Manmohan Singh at its helm, was the right grouping to initiate the change. Alas, there is no sign yet of that major challenge being addressed. Populist acts are not enough. Their implementation is critical. Many of the pledges made in the Congress manifesto at the time of the elections have been addressed by the party led by Sonia Gandhi. In contrast, the prime minister and his council of ministers have not been able to restore the dignity of governance India desperately wants.

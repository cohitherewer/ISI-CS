The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

Not too big for the coffee table

 AB, THE LEGEND: A PHOTOGRAPHERS TRIBUTE (Rupa, Rs 995) is a disappointingly 

reverential tribute, combining Pradeep Chandras photographs of the actor with 

biographical commentary and guest columns by the likes of Pritish Nandy, Govind 

Nihalani and Shobhaa D. This is pure Page-Three Coffee-Table, and most of the 

writers are too much in awe of the Big Bs bigness to come up with interesting 

and original accounts of the man and his roles. When he is not a legend, he is 

an enigma. And the film stills are better photographs than Chandras, most of 

which show him as uniformly larger than life. On the left, AB is being measured 

for his wax statue;(middle)catches him with other eminent Mumbaikars, and bottom 

is a still from Guddi (1971) with Jaya Bhaduri.

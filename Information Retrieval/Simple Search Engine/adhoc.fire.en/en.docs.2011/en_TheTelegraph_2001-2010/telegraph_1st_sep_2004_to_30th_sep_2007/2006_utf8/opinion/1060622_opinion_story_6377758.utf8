 Letters to Editor

 Blow by blow

 Sir ? The rare courage shown by Sonia Karwalia in meting out punishment to a traffic constable who refused to take her complaint against an errant bus driver, is admirable (?Woman?s punch shakes up police?, June 19). It is a shame that the deputy commissioner of police (traffic), Jawed Shamim, thinks that she should not have assaulted the policeman, and gone to the traffic guard office instead. When poor, helpless people like Ruma Pal are being turned away from police stations despite having legitimate complaints, we need Sonia Karwalias to show that when the need arises, the public too can teach the police a thing or two about what law actually means. Karwalia?s instance will go a long way in boosting the morale of women and help them tackle problems with more confidence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskaranand Jha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The law-keepers of the city should feel ashamed after the Sonia Karwalia episode. This incident brings to light the loopholes in the existing system. The chief minister?s appeal for a more responsive police force sounds patently false given the regular harassment faced by people at police stations. 

 The Calcutta police has been arranging a number of programmes to improve its public relations through football tournaments and various welfare functions. Obviously, all that has not helped matters. Sonia Karwalia may have the courage to hit a cop who was not doing his duty, but how many of us can manage to do the same? People turn pale at the thought of visiting the police station. And the reasons behind such behaviour are not difficult to seek. Either pleas are ignored or complainants are thrown out. It is time errant policemen received a sound thrashing. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anushyuta Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? Sonia Karwalia?s assault on a law-enforcer was an expression of anger at the utter negligence of duty not only on the part of the person in charge but also of the entire police organization in the state. The chief minister has often asked the police to conduct their duty honestly, without fear or favour. But perhaps the men in uniform think that these sermons are for the consumption of the media only. Some serious thought should be given to the present law and order situation before things get out of hand. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? In the face-off with the traffic police at Ultadanga, Sonia Karwalia demanded her right to justice. But in doing so, she has herself become a violator of the law. However wrong the police might have been that day, Karwalia, instead of punishing the constable herself, could have hauled the officer to court on charges of dereliction of duty. She should have avoided hitting him because this is a culpable offence.

 Such incidents, however, have a brighter side. They leave an impact on public mind and make the administration sit up and take notice. Karwalia?s actions will not go in vain, though it is doubtful if the offending driver can be traced. There exists a peculiar symbiotic relationship between the guardians of law and its violators. The public have become immune to this and show little concern unless they are directly affected. The incident at Ultadanga is not to be seen in isolation just because it is the outburst of a young woman. The circumstances that provoked Karwalia exist in most places in both the city and the suburbs. Negligent police officers need to be made aware of their responsibility towards the public. If that is done, Karwalia and people like her would be spared the unwanted publicity.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is ironic that just when the chief minister had wanted the police to be more prompt in lodging FIRs and following up cases, incidents like that of Sonia Karwalia and Ruma Pal had to happen. The latter case makes evident that violence involving dowry matters still plague India. But the torture and abuse perpetrated on women go unreported because the police are not proactive enough. The police force has to be sensitized to the needs of the people they serve, especially those of women. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? If one has to approach the head of the police administration of a district to file a complaint, what is the use of maintaining policemen in the lower ranks at the taxpayer?s expense? Unless cops at the lower end of the hierarchy start being more responsible and sensitive towards the common people, victims will continue to be deprived of legal help. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

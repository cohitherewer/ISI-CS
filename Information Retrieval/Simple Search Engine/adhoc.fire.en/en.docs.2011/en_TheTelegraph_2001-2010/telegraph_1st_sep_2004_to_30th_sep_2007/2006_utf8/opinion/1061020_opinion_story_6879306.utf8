 NO FREEWAY FOR BIBLIOPHILES 

Bookwise

 New roads 

More and more out-of-copyright books are being digitized 

and many scholarly papers are being posted on the internet. Any scholarly book 

should now be supplemented by postings on the web because everything that is written 

cannot be published. The Google Book Search project, which major libraries such 

as the New York Public Library have signed onto, is in the process of transferring 

millions of books into the search engines database. The publishing industry is 

also in the process of developing an automated content access protocol, a digital 

framework that will allow publishers to define and regulate the terms of access 

in a manner that the search engines robot spiders understand. 

Hence the question we need to ask is whether digitization 

will help the three main players of the publishing industry: the publishers, booksellers 

and, of course, the readers. Will they get the stuff for free or will they need 

to pay for it? 

Google, the main driving force behind digitization, 

is not going to give away its labours for a song. It would certainly charge a 

fee for access. Pricing could be along the lines of the annual subscription fee 

for the print edition of journals, which also allows access to the archives at 

a little extra cost. 

For instance, if you subscribe to The Economist 

or The NewYork Review of Books, you get access to the archives. 

If you do not, all you get online are summaries of the articles that would tempt 

you to pay the annual fee. These are early days but some such formula would be 

worked out, probably on a publisher-to-publisher basis. The bottom line is that 

you pay. But, there are swings-and-roundabouts for each of the three players. 

The publisher makes his money on reprints which means 

not just a straight reprint of the earlier, non-copyrighted edition but also of 

its re-designed version which is copyright. If Google lifts off the new edition 

without paying a fee, it is a violation of copyright. Besides, to reset an old 

book costs time and money. Google would have to pay for it and then charge its 

users. 

Booksellers would lose out a little on the online 

edition, but not very much. Not everyone has a computer at home, nor would he 

necessarily subscribe to the digitized edition. 

A reader, who owns a computer, makes wide use of it 

and such usage will definitely increase in the coming years. The reader will certainly 

benefit from digitized versions of non-copyright books which often are not easily 

available. 

Of course a lot depends on how old you are: if you 

are under 30, you will easily take to the electro- nic edition; if older, there 

will be a psychological barrier that would take time to get over.

 TO COURT TROUBLE

 History is made in unexpected ways. The Supreme Court has awarded Ms Zahira Sheikh, one of the sufferers in the Best Bakery violence, and initially one of its most outspoken witnesses, a sentence of a year?s imprisonment and a fine of Rs 50,000 for trying to deflect the course of justice. This is her penalty for perjury, allegedly after being bribed into a bewildering series of turnarounds in court by the influential thugs interested in concealing the truth behind the genocide. The penalty is significant not only because it is rare, but also because it is exemplary. The young woman, condemned for her lies under oath by her own community, had been at the receiving end of the violence the court is ruling on. Thus the court is making a strong point against perjury, and issuing an indirect warning against witnesses who are persuaded to turn hostile. This has an inescapable bearing on the Jessica Lal murder case, in which hostile witnesses sabotaged the evidence against the accused. Influencing crucial witnesses to sing a different tune is not a new event, but it has now reached proportions the court cannot ignore. Nor can the government. An amendment to the criminal procedure code, which will help hold witnesses to their word, is being formulated.

 But as the court has reportedly acknowledged, this is not the whole story. Intimidation of the weak and allurement by big money ? spelling future security ? are dimensions of a crime and harsh realities in a witness?s everyday life that no administration can wish away. Punishing a hostile witness for constant lying may be necessary, but it still leaves the real culprits free. Although the court has instructed the state to protect witnesses in sensitive cases, since this is the state?s responsibility, it has to be asked why such an obvious instruction is necessary. What is to be done if those closest to the forms of state power, politically, economically, socially and by ties of blood, are foremost in inducing perjury in witnesses? And given the role of the police, both in the Gujarat violence and in the Lal case, it has to be asked if they are the best repositories of such trust. Both as sufferer and as perjurer, Ms Sheikh remains the most unforgettable face of the Gujarat genocide, and of the conflicting and destructive forces that foil the aspiration to truth and justice in a country that calls itself a secular democracy. Witnesses can be made accountable only when the state is.

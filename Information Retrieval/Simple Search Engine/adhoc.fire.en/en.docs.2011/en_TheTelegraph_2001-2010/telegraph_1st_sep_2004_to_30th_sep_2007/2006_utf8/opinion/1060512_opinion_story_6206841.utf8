 Keys to the heart

The Piano Shop On The Left Bank: The Hidden World 

of A Paris Atelier

By T.E. Carhart, Vintage, pound; 4.55

This is the story of one man?s fascination with the 

piano. It is at once enjoyable and educative. Woven into the narrative is an account 

of the history and the evolution of the piano. This book will delight all lovers 

of Western music.

 T.E. Carhart, an American in Paris, is attracted and intrigued by a small piano repair shop in the street on which he lives. Unable to resist its bizarre allure, one day he steps into it. An old man greets him, but is cold and unwelcoming. He even denies that the shop handles old pianos. Despite this, Carhart keeps going back to the shop which, he discovers from acquaintances, actually deals in old pianos. But the old shop owner is unwilling to entertain Carhart as a customer since he has come without a reference. A reference provided an opening and, more importantly, Carhart accidentally meets a younger man, Luc, co-owner of the shop, who is much more forthcoming. Luc invites Carhart to the back of the shop where the workshop is located. The atelier is littered with old pianos. Carhart ultimately buys a piano which transforms his life. But through the process of choosing and buying a piano, he and Luc become friends, and from Luc he learns an enormous amount about pianos, their history, and their mechanism.

 No one knows exactly when the piano was invented though the name of the inventor is known. An instrument-maker at the Medici court in Florence named Bartolomeo Cristofori developed a way of making a struck string instrument resound loudly. This was a major breakthrough since before Cristofori keyboard instruments were unsatisfactory: clavichords were small and delicate and could be used only for small gatherings. Even the harpsichord, an older instrument, did not make possible the dynamic control of each note. What Cristofori invented was an ?instrument as large and robust as the big harpsichords that would also allow the dynamic range that before had only been available on the flimsy clavichords.?? 

 A contemporary described the first piano in 1711 as a ?harpsichord with soft and loud?. German instrument-makers improved upon Cristofori?s breakthrough. The Bach family contributed significantly to improvements in the mechanism of the piano. By the middle of the 18th century, the keyboard as a solo instrument had come to the fore musically. Keyboard music was thus freed from the confines of the drawing room and the salon. Both Haydn and Mozart wrote exquisite pieces for the piano. Its popularity made possible the work of a class of instrument-makers and technicians who transformed piano-making with London and Vienna as the twin focal points of piano production. The Viennese pianos had a soft and refined singing tone. This enabled the melody to come out to the forefront. English pianos were more robust. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven excelled on Viennese pianos but Beethoven?s late piano sonatas, especially the incomparable Hammerklavier, underline the significance of the stronger English pianos.

 From the score to the fingers to the pressing of the keys ? this enables the piano player ?to encompass the composer?s ideas and translate them from the kinetic to the infinite orbit of music.?

 This book presses the right keys in a music lover?s heart.

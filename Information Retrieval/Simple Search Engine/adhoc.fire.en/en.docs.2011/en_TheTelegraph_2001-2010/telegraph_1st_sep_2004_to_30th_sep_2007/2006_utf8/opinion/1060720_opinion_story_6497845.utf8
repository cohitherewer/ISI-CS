The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FIRST CLASS FIRST

 India is now officially the biggest gold jewellery producer in the world. There is no escape from the fact, for jewellery is flaunted, in all its shining perfection and variety, in advertisements and sponsorships in bewildering abundance. The approach has changed too. Gone is the passive woman, stiffly smirking from behind a cascade of gold, and framed by bland claims of purity made purer by pure metal, or happiness in marriage made more perfect. 

 The woman of the new-age ad wants the very best. Youthful and bright, she might demand of her father a ?first class first? for her wedding, meaning not a groom but jewellery of a particular brand or shop. Is this the gold fetish in its new incarnation? Or less youthful, but a known personality, she might assert, ?Ami kokhono compromise kori na (I never compromise).? This one asks of no one.

 Jewellers now have to capture the traditional and the progressive, and open up horizons beyond weddings and anniversaries. The homemaker is the heroine of a game show, while a shiny butterfly flits out of a jewel box the young woman holds, as a shadowy young man looks on. The tag is romantic, enticing: ?Do you really know me??

 Do they? The advertisers call out to all types, harping on the old tunes of beauty, purity and endurance, as well as on fresh themes of selfhood, choice and freedom. Gold sets the woman ?free?, a message that erases the old ideas of golden fetters, as when she lets her pendant down her back, rather than let it nestle in her cleavage.

 Perhaps, advertisers have discovered the new woman out of a need to compete with the newcomers, diamond and platinum, which, with their Western associations, are made to denote class, individuality, style and subtlety. But here too, the strong beauty, also a celebrity, who looks into a mirror and declares her belief in herself, is offset by the melting beloved overcome by her man?s gift of diamonds. 

 Some like it old, some like it new, and some like it through celebrities. One way to do this is through product placement in films: period tales with new-old jewellery seem to have hit the right spot. Advertisers must match up, projecting a dazzling variety that reflects the glitter of a jewellery mall. The mall has everything, from 14-carat products for teenagers and 18-carat ?Italian? gold to 22-carat ?Indian? pieces from Rs 5,000 to a few lakhs, from mangalsutras with diamond pendants to pendants with religious images, from certificates guaranteeing purity to bulletins with the latest updates. From the mall to the gold lifestyle shop is equally bedazzling. The astrological gemstone chart still in place, a vast glass-fronted shop might offer watches and luggage, as well as an exclusive line in modern jewellery.

 The metrosexual man is still way behind in this race for the glamourous consumer. Addressing the woman is probably more fun. One TV commercial has a celebrity tenderly asking those who manage the home, or office, or both, if they don?t want to find a bit of themselves. A game, presumably with a pot of gold at the end, is the way to do it. Finding oneself amid the glitter is quite a challenge. 

 Can women live to shine, as another jeweller directs women to do? It may be that they have discovered women can choose. But where a choice, freed of the desire to please or subjugate, will lead them, is another question.

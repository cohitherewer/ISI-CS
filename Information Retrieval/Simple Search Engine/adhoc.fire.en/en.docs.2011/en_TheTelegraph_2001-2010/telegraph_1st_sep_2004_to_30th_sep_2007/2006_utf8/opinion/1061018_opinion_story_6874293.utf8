 FACING EAST, BUT GOING WEST

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 East, we know, is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet. In fact, they do: at exactly the opposite side of the planet from Greenwich, where 180 degrees E become 180 degrees W. Less well-recognized is the way they can meet, nay exchange places, in writers and (often) journalists minds.

 A friend of mine on The Economist has just brought out a fine new book on the Greek-Turkish exchange of populations after 1923; pity Mountbatten couldnt have read it. But it has one oddity: modern ideas flowing westward from Europe into Turkey. A new history of the English-speaking peoples that Im reviewing has Stalins troops marching eastward across Europe in 1945, and the Allied invaders of Normandy on D-Day planning to swing westwards, a manoeuvre that would have brought them swiftly not to Paris but to a different set of beaches on the English Channel. 

 You can be an expert and still do it: The Riddle of the Sands, a once-famous novel stuffed with yachting lore, has a boat facing north, yet with West So-and-So Island to starboard and East So-and-So Island to port (ask a sailing friend, if you need to). I likewise remember a learned article that had explorers sailing southward from Antarctica. Ive often read, indeed as a journalist may well have committed, similar errors. 

 At the front

 Why do we make them? I dont think its just the usual enemies of accuracy in my trade, haste and (at least in Britain) drink. Theres something in the language. Brown means brown, a brick is a brick, but east and its like are relative terms. They depend on where you are. A Britons Middle East is, or should be, an Indians West Asia. The Levant and the Orient come from originally Latin words meaning the rising sun. Does Calcuttas sun rise over Lebanon? 

 The terms are pretty fluid too. Germans in 1914-18 described their troops in France as fighting on the western front, as distinct from those facing Russia. Britons, having no other front to think about, but still oddly, adopted the German usage: their troops went off eastward to the western front. Parts Egypt, Israel and the like of what Britons now call the Middle East they used to call the Near East (as some Americans and many Frenchmen still do). During the Cold War, East Berlin was a political entity; hence the way some British newspapers today overcautiously always write eastern Berlin. 

 No sense of direction

 In those Cold War days too, and in some contexts even now, the West for journalists included Japan and Australia, while Greece was part of Western Europe. Nowadays, the South, in development terms, can include any poor country from Namibia to Nepal. 

 Some terms can overtly contradict themselves. A south wind blows from the south, agreed? But what does the English song mean by Blow the wind southerly, southerly? From the south or to it? As it happens, in this case, from; but southerly can also mean to the south, and similar words likewise. 

 I wonder idly, I admit whether it is pure coincidence that in so many European languages east and west sound alike: est/ouest in French, este/oeste in Spanish and Portuguese, Ost/West in German and similarly in Dutch and the Scandinavian languages. All, curiously, are words of Germanic origin, not Latin; even Italians can use est and ovest. Could it be that Europes astounding conquest of East and West alike happened because its great navigators werent quite sure in which direction they had been instructed to set off?

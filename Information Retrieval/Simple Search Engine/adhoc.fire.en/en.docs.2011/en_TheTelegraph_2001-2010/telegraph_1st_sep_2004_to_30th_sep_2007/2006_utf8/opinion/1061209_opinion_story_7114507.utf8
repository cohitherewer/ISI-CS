 MOLES ON MODERATION

 The past has often been rewritten or reconstructed to meet the political and ideological needs of the present. This is especially true in countries where the state interferes directly in the writing of history. The results of such rewriting and reinterpretation can be dangerous, as was evident in Nazi Germany. There is thus good reason to treat with scepticism the recent attempts of the state in Pakistan to alter the explanation for the origin of Pakistan. Since the birth of Pakistan, school children there have been taught through their textbooks that the country was created by the active pursuance of the two-nation theory by Mohammad Ali Jinnah and the Muslim League. But now, according to reports, a new explanation and emphasis will be included in the textbooks for grades IX and X. According to this new angle, Muslim deprivation, not religion led to the Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan. In other words, the emphasis will shift from ideology to economics. But the reasons behind this shift are significant.

 The shift is dictated by the new orientation Mr Pervez Musharraf is trying to give to the polity and society of Pakistan. Mr Musharraf is trying to establish a policy of enlightened moderation that seeks to stem extremism and militancy and promote moderate and progressive ideas. This policy is aimed as an attack against bigotry and fanaticism, which seek to promote hatred of other religions and have no space for any kind of argument and dissent. The idea of enlightened moderation is then being projected backwards. The attempt is to show that it existed even when Pakistan was conceived and created. Thus, the new textbooks will exclude all material that promotes prejudice against non-Muslims of pre-Partition India. The political demands of present-day Pakistan will thus come to determine the circumstances of its origin. The fact that this might lead to a distortion of history does not seem to have occurred to the authors of this exercise in Pakistan. The political aims of the Pakistan president are to be welcomed but these aims should not be transposed back into history.

 Jinnah was in his private life and beliefs a secular person. But he found in religion a convenient vehicle for fulfilling his political ambitions. He fashioned himself as a Muslim politician and argued that Muslims in India had their own interests and aspirations. These interests and aspirations had never been nurtured in India because India was dominated by Hindus who formed the majority. Further, he argued that the interests and aspirations of Muslims would never be upheld in independent India, which would inevitably be dominated by Hindus. Muslims of India thus needed a separate country of their own. This resulted in Jinnahs promotion of the politics of hatred: one of the most horrible examples of this was Direct Action day in Bengal on August 16, 1946. Religion and violence associated with it are the birthmarks of Pakistan. Mr Musharraf will have to build a new Pakistan without removing these.

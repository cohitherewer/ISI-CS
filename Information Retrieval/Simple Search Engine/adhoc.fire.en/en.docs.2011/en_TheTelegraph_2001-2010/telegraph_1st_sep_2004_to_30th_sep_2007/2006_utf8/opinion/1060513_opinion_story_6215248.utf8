 EVERYBODY?S CHILD

 The relationship between poverty and childhood is simple and brutal. Money and the bodies of children become literally interchangeable, and the exchange is embedded in larger, and local, relations of power. These relations are, in turn, held in place by inequalities of gender and economic status. As the story of Budhia Singh, the marathon-running child, unfolds in Orissa, this structure is emerging in all its oppressiveness and clarity. Pieces of the Budhia puzzle are beginning to fit together to give a sense of the forces and pressures that control his body and mind. It is money that binds him to his widowed mother. His training to be a runner is a long-term investment that promises the enhancement of both fortune and prestige. Instead of being on track for the Guinness Book of World Records and the Olympics, Budhia could easily have become ? like his friend and former neighbour, Babu ? a ragpicker, sweeping the floors of passenger trains. It is also money that binds Budhia?s mother to his coach, Mr Biranchi Das. Mr Das gave her the 800 rupees for which she was going to sell her son to a hawker, thereby buying Budhia off her, and getting the child to live with him. 

 It is power, then, that binds both mother and child to the coach. Mr Das is president of the slum in which the mother lives with her children. And it was corporal punishment that revealed Budhia?s talent to his coach. Mr Das had made the child run paces as punishment for mischief, only to realize that Budhia could run exceptionally well. This also marked the beginning of another kind of oppression: the coach?s control over Budhia?s body and its growth, and therefore over the child?s ?evolving capacity? to ?express? himself, to come up with statements like ?I will run for my country?.

 ?Evolving capacity? and ?express? are crucial words in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, a key document to which India has been a signatory for more than a decade. This ?universal? discourse of children?s rights ? with its ideas of children?s ?freedoms?, ?capacities? and right to ?participate? in their own development ? exists like a remotely sheltering sky above the heads of children like Budhia and his dish-washing sisters. And mediating between the ?global? language of the UNCRC and the ?local? structures that determine the lives of particular children are the legal, administrative and civil-society institutions responsible for the ?protection? of children. In Budhia?s case, these would be the local courts and child welfare committee (acting under the Juvenile Justice Act), the police and the National Human Rights Commission, the various doctors, hospitals and NGOs that are being consulted, and ultimately, the relevant ministries of the state and Central governments ? the nation for whose glory Budhia is being made to run. 

 With the Orissa government now reluctant to ban his running, it is becoming clear that between these two forms of ?protection? ? his own people?s and the State?s ? Budhia?s childhood is anybody?s for the taking.

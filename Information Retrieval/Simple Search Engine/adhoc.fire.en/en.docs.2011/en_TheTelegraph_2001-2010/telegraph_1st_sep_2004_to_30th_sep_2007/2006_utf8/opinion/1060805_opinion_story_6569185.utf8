 MAN IN THE KNOW

 Former taxman Arvind Kejriwal, who has won this years Ramon Magsaysay award for activating Indias Right to Information movement, is taking on the state again 

 Humility is a trait Arvind Kejriwal seems to wear on his sleeve. As a former taxman, he knows theres no duty levied on smiling and he exploits the loophole to the fullest. His phone hasnt stopped ringing since Monday, when news broke about his bagging this years Ramon Magsaysay award. But he apologises to all those who have had to hear the this-phone-is-busy monotone in an attempt to speak to him, as if it were his own fault. He has been honoured for activating Indias Right to Information [RTI] movement at the grassroots, says the award foundations official statement. Yet he insists this award is actually for all the people out there who have stood for the movement his role has only been circumstantial. 

 There are no streamers or glitters at his Ghaziabad residence to celebrate the occasion the only objets dart that adorn his drawing room walls are paintings by his 10-year-old daughter. Congratulatory messages keep filtering in through all modes of modern electronic communication, but Kejriwal, who grew up in Hissar in Haryana, doesnt spare precious minutes to sit back and savour them all. Theres a tough battle about to begin the enemy, in this case, happens to be the state. And the RTI Act, which has been Kejriwals baby ever since he took up his crusade against corruption, stands a chance of being subverted. Clearly, Kejriwal is in no mood to party, the award notwithstanding. 

 A lot of water has flown under the bridge since Kejriwal who holds a B.Tech degree in mechanical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur chucked his job at Tata Steel in Jamshedpur in 1992, to step into the shoes of a bureaucrat. His opting for the Indian Revenue Service (IRS) wasnt purely voluntary; the 38-year-old says it came about more as a result of peer pressure. All my colleagues were quitting their jobs at Tata Steel to do civil service, and I decided to go with the flow, he says. But then, I had also realised that the IRS would give me an opportunity to serve my fellow citizens, and that eventually turned out to be my calling. 

 The entry into the world of bureaucracy also brought upon Kejriwal the realisation that the government was, in effect, meant to serve Indian citizens, and administrators in that vein were not really masters of all they surveyed, as many of them loved to believe. Even beggars pay taxes in our country, while buying something as small as a matchbox, he observes. And since people pay taxes, they have a right to know how their hard-earned money is being spent. 

 The right to know, says Kejriwal, was the driving philosophy behind establishing Parivartan, a peoples rights movement in Delhi, way back in January 2000. Our strategy was that of collective advocacy, he says. We began by urging people not to pay bribes to get their work done and in due course of time, urged people to exercise the Delhi RTI legislation, which was passed in 2001, to seek redressal. It worked. People wielding the RTI stick started getting their work done in as little as 10 days time, he says. 

 Having managed to stop corruption at a micro level, Kejriwal soon felt he needed to devote more time to the movement. Twice I was on extended leave from service to dedicate myself to Parivartan, and in February this year finally quit the IRS to become a full-time worker for the movement, he says. 

 Disillusionment had nothing to do with his opting out of the IRS, says Kejriwal. I must say I was quite lucky, he reflects. As an honest officer, I was never victimised. I even got postings that people would have given their right hand for. Its just that I could be replaced in the IRS by another officer, but not many would want to take up the mission that I wanted to take up, he says in a resolute voice. 

 There were difficult moments at home, too. His middle class parents were unhappy about his quitting Tata Steel to join the government, and worried about his decision to leave the government for a movement. But Kejriwal moved on possibly aided by his ability to concentrate. An avid practitioner of Vipasana meditation for some years now, he says it helps him go about his mission, arduous though it may be. 

 Over six years, Parivartan grew from a one-man effort to a mass movement and achieved its goal of putting in place a national legislation that would make administrative officials accountable to the common citizen regarding the movement of files within their offices. 

 But less than a year after its implementation, the RTI Act happens to face a stiff challenge from none other than the government, in the form of proposed amendments that many fear could cripple it substantially. Its a regressive step the government is taking. The amendments could effectively kill the legislation, he says. 

 Saving the law thus remains Kejriwals first priority, for the moment. But that apart, he wants Parivartan to go ahead with its advisory work, spreading mass awareness and educating common citizens on how to seek redressal for their grievances. 

 And the larger movement for change, say fellow activists, will continue. The government needs to realise the fact that this movement is no longer a personal battle waged by a few people, says 2000 Magsaysay Award winner and activist Aruna Roy, also associated with the RTI campaign. Its a mass movement now, and it cant be stopped even if the government decides to curb the legislation. The collective spirit of Indian citizens cannot be thwarted, she adds. 

 Needless to say, Kejriwal has a lot on his platter in the days to come. And its also an indication that he stands to miss out on oodles of forthcoming action from Bollywood, considering that he once used to be a first-day-first-show man. Theres just not enough time for it these days, he says, flashing a smile that doesnt reflect an iota of regret. A new release is all about the flow of information for Kejriwal these days.

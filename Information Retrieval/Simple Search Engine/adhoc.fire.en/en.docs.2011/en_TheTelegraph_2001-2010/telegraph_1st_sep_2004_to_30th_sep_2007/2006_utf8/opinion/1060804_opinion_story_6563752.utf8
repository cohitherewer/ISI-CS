 CALL THE BLUFF

 Even Mr Manmohan Singhs mildness and patience have their limits. The prime minister has, at long last, done some straight talking to the comrades. The left has been told in no uncertain terms that if it votes with the Bharatiya Janata Party for a parliamentary resolution on the Indo-US nuclear deal, it would mean the end of the day for the government led by Mr Singh. This threat from the prime minister is directed at the Communist Party of India (Marxist) whose leaders have been sharply critical of the nuclear deal and of Indias growing closeness to the United States of America. The CPI(M) leaders have not stopped at criticism; they have even considered voting with the BJP on a parliamentary resolution to convey a sense of the Lok Sabha to the government. This has proved too much for Mr Singh, who is by no means unused to the lefts carping and sniping at his policies, especially in the realms of the economy and of foreign policy. He has finally had enough and has decided to call the CPI(M)s bluff. It is also clear that Mr Singh is not the only person who is impatient with the lefts antics. A few weeks ago, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, the defence minister, remarked that the government would neither accept a resolution nor a motion on the nuclear deal in the Lok Sabha.

 The prime ministers statement is a warning to the CPI(M) to end its schizophrenia. It has to decide for itself and for the country where it stands so far as the United Progressive Alliance is concerned. It cannot be an ally and not an ally simultaneously. The schizophrenia extends to other spheres as well. It has assumed for itself the moral high ground in politics, but when it comes to embarrassing Mr Singhs government, it can contemplate the idea of breaking bread with the BJP. It continues to attack policies aimed at furthering economic reforms while its own chief minister in West Bengal assiduously woos foreign direct investments and pursues other aims of liberalization. It is very clear to most observers that the CPI(M) is using its numerical strength in the Lok Sabha as an instrument of political blackmail. Even some of the other left parties are dismayed by the CPI(M)s flirtation with the BJP. Mr Singh has shown enormous courage by showing it up for what it is and for declaring that he will have nothing to do with the left if the latter goes with the BJP. A forked tongue is the hallmark of a particularly reprehensible creature.

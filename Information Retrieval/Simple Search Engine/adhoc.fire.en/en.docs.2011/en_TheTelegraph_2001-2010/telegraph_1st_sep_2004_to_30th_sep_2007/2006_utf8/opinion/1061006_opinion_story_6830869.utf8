The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Disease in the polity 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Dengue and Chikunguniya are as 

 dreaded today as tuberculosis and polio, small pox and malaria 

 were in the not-so-distant past. These two new strains of 

 malaria, transmitted by mosquitoes that breed merrily in 

 filthy conditions, in stagnant open drains and pools of 

 contaminated water, have come to haunt India. These diseases 

 are fast becoming fatal, much like the plague. That in this 

 day and age our municipalities are incapable of ensuring 

 basic sanitary conditions, incapacitated by endemic corruption 

 and a lack of accountability, only goes to prove the failure 

 of governance that has overwhelmed our polity. 

 In Delhi, the capital of India 

 and a favoured city, the flouting of all social norms, ranging 

 from chucking garbage on the street to encroaching on spaces 

 that are out of bounds under the law, have led to complete 

 anarchy and corruption, and finally to the degradation of 

 the city. It has reached unmanageable proportions and the 

 lack of honest governance and correct policing has aggravated 

 the situation to a point of no return. 

 Those who have lived off and flourished 

 by breaking the law are now fighting to keep illegalities 

 alive hoping to make them legal. Yes, it is as convoluted 

 as it sounds here. The gutters of the city are never cleaned 

 and therefore, when it rains for a few minutes, the city 

 comes to a standstill as the water rises and stagnates, 

 with nowhere to drain off to. No official in the municipality, 

 nor the concerned department is hauled up or suspended for 

 failing to do his job. 

 At construction sites that are 

 at every corner owing to the building boom, no norms for 

 clearing the debris and rubble or for making sure that water 

 does not stand indefinitely at the site and suchlike are 

 enforced. Access points, by lanes, even main arteries are 

 blocked with what is referred to as malba. If we 

 can see the muck, surely our leaders and their bureaucrats 

 can see it too. Why then does nothing happen? Why are we 

 held to ransom in this manner by the government?

 Missing in action

 Delhi is in a bizarre situation. 

 The part of the city that houses the strange breed called 

 the VIP, is maintained by the NDMC. It is cleaner and 

 more privileged. Disease does not strike the inhabitants 

 here as it does elsewhere in this capital. However, this 

 time round, according to the television reports beamed to 

 us, the prime ministers grandchildren have tested positive 

 for dengue and have been admitted to the All India Institute 

 of Medical Sciences. Ironically, dengue was rampant on the 

 campus of this prestigious institution where mosquitoes 

 had found a virtual haven in the open, choked gutters and 

 garbage dumps. 

 Just the image of Indias premier 

 scientific institute, enveloped in filth, makes ones stomach 

 turn. There is no excuse whatsoever for this state of affairs. 

 And no one has been brought to book or held responsible. 

 Will the entry of this near fatal disease into the poshest 

 parts of town finally herald the much-needed awakening and 

 trigger some real action?

 Small pox, polio, malaria, tuberculosis 

 have all been eradicated. Today, decades down the road, 

 when other diseases too should have been put to rest, these 

 old timers are back with a vengeance. There is a direct 

 correlation with the deteriorating environment, the lack 

 of green and tree cover, the poisoning of water sources 

 and the destruction of natural catchment areas, the brutal 

 assault motivated by greed that building and timber mafias 

 are inflicting thoughtlessly on this land, and most important, 

 the nexus between political professionals, the administration 

 and the commercial groups. 

 Long-term and sustainable growth 

 can be painful because it demands adherence to norms and 

 regulations. Great civilizations are built on values and 

 ethics, not on quick bucks and corruption.

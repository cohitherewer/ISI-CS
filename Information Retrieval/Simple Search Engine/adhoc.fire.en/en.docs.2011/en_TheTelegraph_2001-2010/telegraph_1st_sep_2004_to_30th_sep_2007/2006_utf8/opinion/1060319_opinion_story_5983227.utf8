The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BY THAT NAME ALONE

 What is not in a name? The fancies, dreams and disillusions of parents and family, the insidious nuances of domestic politics, celebratory proclamations of the culture?s notions of beauty and value, even desperate prayers, are fossilized in miniature in a collocation of sounds that signify one unique person. A girl named Annakali, for example, will never be able to forget that her Bengali parents were praying to the deity not to give them any more daughters. There is quite a chance that the name might make her or break her. As personalized and weighty is the tradition that names children after their forefathers or foremothers, leaving them with examples to emulate or defy. Only a state that believes that even a small personal pleasure is sin can deprive families of this excitement and individuals of a bit of their secret history by deciding to take away from parents and kin the power to name babies. But then China, which is the state that has decided to make a list of names beyond which parents will not be allowed to go, is practised in the art of erasing individuality.

 It is no surprise that China would discover a right, just to take it away, with the pretext of making things easier for everybody. Electronic identity cards cannot accommodate all the characters in the language, therefore a limited list. Control comes in many-splendoured guises. Naming a child is not a codified right of parents and kin, simply because it has always seemed a natural corollary of birth in a family. What is less explicable is the ease with which talibanization in Chinese society takes place in different pha- ses under different dispensations without too much attention from the world. 

 ?Human rights? is not the most favoured concept of the Chinese state, but the nation has too big a population to send to Coventry. It can afford to ignore what the rest of the world is saying, for the rest of the world cannot ignore its growing economic power. Even Tiananmen Square and the Falungong are mentioned in embarrassed mumbles when routine objections are made about China?s human rights record. Appro- priating the right to name babies would barely make a blip in its booming list of rights violations.

 The babies with the official names will also have to live an official youth. A market economy is a cultural foe to reckon with, and the authorities are alarmed at the signs of waywardness among their young people. Naming is, perhaps, the first twitch in the rein. The next stage is obedience to an eight-point ethical code evolved by the leadership to make virtuous citizens of the young. Here too, China is traditional: a little modulation in Mao Zedong?s instructions can make the new directions fit the times. It is the name-game again. Mao?s ?modesty and prudence? has become ?plain living and hard struggle?. But a little modulation says a lot: what is not in a name?

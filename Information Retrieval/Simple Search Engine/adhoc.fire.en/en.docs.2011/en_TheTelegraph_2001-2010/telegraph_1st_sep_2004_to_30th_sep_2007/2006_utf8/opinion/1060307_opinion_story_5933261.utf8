The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CLOSED ROUTE

 It is not too difficult to make an ass of the law. The accused in the Jessica Lal murder case seemed to have managed to do that quite efficiently. Witnesses can be intimidated or paid off, they can always be made to un-see what they have seen. The only condition is that the perpetrators should be richer than the witnesses. The ugliness of the Lal murder trial and the consequent public outrage prompted the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, to suggest an amendment to Section 164 of the criminal procedure code that would contain witnesses from turning hostile. Witnesses? statements will be taken and recorded under oath as soon as possible after the crime. They would also have to sign their police statement, a copy of which would be forwarded to the magistrate. Recently, two crucial witnesses, Mr Shayan Munshi in the Lal case and Ms Zahira Sheikh in the Best Bakery case, claimed that they had problems with the language in which the first information reports were written. Ms Sheikh is facing perjury charges, but this or similar penalties will become inevitable when the recorded statement becomes part of law. There would be no need for the prolonged grilling of a hostile witness in order to establish perjury, as happened in Ms Sheikh?s case.

 The other feature of the proposed amendment is a corollary of the first, but less easy to implement. This is about witness protection: a witness can be threatened with not only his own life but that of his nearest kin, or, at an extreme, eliminated. The world being targeted through the amendment ? of politics, wealth and glamour ? pays well for the best thugs. In hostile witnesses, greed can be punished, but should fear be punished too? Protection is of urgent concern if the amendment is to be fair. Besides, the amendment should not obscure the fact that it is not witnesses alone who are corrupted by money or fear. It is a long route to the court, and the police seldom shine in investigating and evidence-gathering. Can any law change that? If the section is amended along the lines suggested by the Congress president, it has to be seen if it can be implemented successfully when crimes occur in less visible circles. When the victim is poor, and the police somehow forced or persuaded to register a complaint, witnesses tend to vanish from sight even before the police begin the routine inquiries. It would be good if the amendment could change this.

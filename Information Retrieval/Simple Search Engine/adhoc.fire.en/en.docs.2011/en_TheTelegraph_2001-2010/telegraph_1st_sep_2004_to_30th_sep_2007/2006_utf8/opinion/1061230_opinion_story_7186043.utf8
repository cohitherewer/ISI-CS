 FIGHTING BIRDS IN NEED OF HELP

 With most of the IAFs fleet facing the obsolescence problem, it is time for some quick action, feels Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Scary grave

 These are difficult and uncomfortable times for the Indian Air Force. On January 16, 2006, the IAF chief had asked the media to stop calling MiG-21 a flying coffin. And yet, on January 17, a MiG 21 crashed after facing an engine surge during a training sortie over the Jamnagar air base.

 Three llyushin ll-76 Phalcon will be effective from 2007 for airborne early warning. 

 Is this a revelation? No. This is no military secret. It has been reported by Janes World Air Forces and the analysis requires (virtually) no expertise, the data being clear and clean even to a lay man.

 Of the 16 types of aircraft and rotorcraft with the IAF, the combat support and reconnaissance Canberra inducted in 1957 still flies (and crashes, as one did in January 2006 near Agra). One marvels at the magical performance of the IAF men to keep the 8 Canberras airworthy even after 49 years.

 Janes revelation of the IAF inventory shows that the transport aircraft, Avro 748, also flies after 42 years, along with HAL-made Chetak 316B helicopter (41 years), and the air defence and attacking MiG 21 FL (40 years). Sadly, however, age appears to have taken a toll on the numbers of aircraft. Incredible also is the saga of the ex-USSR-made assault helicopter Mil-8, whose number has come down from 150 to 64 in 35 years.

 This is not all. Virtually every other combat flying machine of the IAF has completed more than 20 years service life. Even the MiG-27 M Flogger J attack aircraft and the llyushin 76 MD Candid transport aircraft are 21 years vintage. The only exception to this list of old wine IAF inventory, mercifully, is the fleet of Sukhoi-30, first inducted into the 24th squadron at Pune in 1997.

 The question may be legitimately asked: has the major block obsolescence hit the IAF inventory? If yes, then what is the remedy? How does one resolve this problem? If the answer is no, then what is the reality? Are the aircraft of other major air forces older than Indias?

 A cursory glance through the Chinese air force inventory would reveal that its fleet obsolescence is less pronounced than the IAFs. The Chinese bombers may be 38/39 years old, but their interception and attack-type aircraft are brand new. However, the average age of Chinese combat aircraft varies between 40 to 46 years. And they are due for replacement. 

 Closer to New Delhi, the Pakistani air force too is beset with the modernization/obsolescence dilemma. The age of its multirole F-16 fighters is 23 years, and the original total of 40 aircraft has dwindled to 32. The age of its attack fleet, Fantan and Mirage-5, too varies between 23 to 33 years. The only exception, however, is the Chinese-built air defence aircraft, with age varying between 4 and 18 years.

 It would, however, not be wise to compare the IAF with the Pakistani and Chinese ones because the security environment of New Delhi vis--vis her neighbours is far more complicated than that of Beijing and Islamabad. Seen thus, the recurring crashes of the old fleet make the need for modernization all the more urgent.

 One may find innumerable faults with the IAF system, but should one continue to criticize and whip further the men who are already demoralized, watching their aircraft turn into flying coffins? The IAF does seem to be burdened with the age of its fighting birds. And the only way to come out of the morass appears to be the induction of new fleet. Whether one chooses French Mirage-2000 or Rafale; US F-16 or F-18; Swedish JAS-39 Viggen, Russian MiG-29/35 or Eurofighter matters little; but what does matter to the sagging morale of the brave IAF men is quick action. Today, every Indian is concerned. The young pilots and their old machines may not gel one fine morning. What happens then? Should one then blame the men who wanted to fly? Or the machines which could not fly?

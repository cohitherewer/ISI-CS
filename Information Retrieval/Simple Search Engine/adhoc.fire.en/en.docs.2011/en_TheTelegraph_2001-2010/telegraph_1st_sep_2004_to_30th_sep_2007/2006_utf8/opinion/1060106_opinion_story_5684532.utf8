 Letters to Editor

 Will this blow over?

 Sir ? ?Demolition light on bribe? (Dec 20), had the Delhi mayor, Satbir Singh, admitting that the four-decade old nexus between builders and officials is responsible for the city?s present civic woes. If that is so, shouldn?t action be taken against them? For it is not merely the bribe-taking officials, but also the bribe-givers who are equally at fault. The demolitions, in fact, were necessary as they alone could convey the message which people have steadfastly refused to accept ? in the long run, bribes can be counter-productive. The message, however, will ring true only if the political establishment does not prove it otherwise, as it has done repeatedly by its vote-bank politics that has led it to regularize illegally constructed colonies and residential complexes. 

 Talking of illegal constructions, one wonders why the government drive has not been extended to unauthorized jhuggis and other roadside dwellings put up by migrants from the villages. This problem too deserves the attention of the civic authorities as the influx from villages to the big cities continues unabated. Government-owned shelters should be created for them to bypass this problem.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? The demolition order was passed and put into effect without any thought for the residents of the 18,000 allegedly illegal structures. These did not come up without the knowledge of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, and some of these structures are as old as 40 years. In these four decades, the corporation took no measure to undo the damage. Quite obviously, enough money was changing hands. If that is the case, why wasn?t a case registered against MCD officials for dereliction of duty? The promoters of the buildings should be punished instead of their innocent occupants. How can they go scot-free after cheating unsuspecting buyers and pocketing huge amounts of money? Many promoters in Delhi often sell or rent out the top floor of their buildings to government departments at very cheap rates in order to protect the illegal floors beneath. The promoter-bureaucrat nexus runs deep, but it is invariably the public who suffer the most. The Delhi corporation has cheated the government of revenue and yet has not been called to account. Is it because the government and the judiciary fear that more skeletons will tumble out than they can handle?

 Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Many of the illegal constructions in Delhi are important establishments which are difficult to pull down. This is causing a furore among the residents of Delhi.The government officials should have been vigilant enough to stop such constructions. However, most of the time, it is the small settlers who are being made the scapegoats. Quite predictably, the political backlash against the Sheila Dikshit government will be severe. It is better to legalize some of the landmark constructions instead of demolishing them at random.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? We all knew of the link between corrupt officials and builders before the Delhi mayor told us of it. But instead of destroying the unauthorized structures, many of them residential complexes, it would be more politically correct to regularize them on humanitarian grounds. Builders will continue to find loopholes in the law and the government will continue to make fresh laws or rewrite old ones to accommodate illegalities. In most cases, building and development rules have been brazenly violated and vacant lands grabbed in connivance with the political class. Incredible justifications are provided for the continuance of legal violations. The courts should ensure that the politicians and the violators of law do not succeed in their criminal ventures. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Narayan, Mumbai

 Girls? night out

 Sir ? The out-of-work bar girls of Mumbai are justified in showing their anger against the deputy chief minister, R.R. Patil, by naming their service ?RR Package? (?RR packages: a tribute to minister from bar girls pushed into one-night-stands?, Jan 2). Presumably, some measures must have been considered by the government to negate the pitfalls of the ban on beer bar-dancing. If that is the case, then why are those remedial measures not being implemented? The axe on the dancing bars was brought down with much fanfare by the Maharashtra government. Why is it now shying away from the media queries? Was the hullabaloo over rehabilitation a ploy to win the adulation of the victims or an act to please the moral police? What had started as a move to bring back the ?untouchables? of society to the mainstream, has consigned them to hell forever. Things have worsened to such an extent that the girls are being forced into prostitution to make both ends meet. It seems that the government is too prudish to let these bar dancers continue with their profession, and too narrow-minded to provide them with a healthy alternative.

 Yours faithfully,

Bijoy Ranjan Dey, Tinsukia, Assam

 Sir ? The bar girls of Mumbai have waged a long war against the city administration?s lack of understanding and insensitivity, some times under the scorching sun and in blinding rain. And now, in their inimical style, they have hit out with their ?RR package?, hoping that somewhere it might hurt. But they are deluding themselves. They have given R.R. Patil his time under the sun and their barbs will do nothing to unsettle that. They?d better think of other ways than a name to undo him.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Saksena, Mumbai

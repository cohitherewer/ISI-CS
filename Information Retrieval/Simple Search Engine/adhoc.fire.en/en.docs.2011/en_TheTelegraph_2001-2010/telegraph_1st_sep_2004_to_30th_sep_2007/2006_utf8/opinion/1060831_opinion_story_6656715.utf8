 EVERYTHING BUT THE BIG PICTURE

WESTMINSTER GLEANINGS -ANABEL LOYD

 The terrorists are laughing

 Summer holidays are drawing to an end. I missed most of this years unusually hot weather, when temperatures rivalled Calcuttas, while travelling in India and the last two weeks of our holiday in Scotland have been rather grey and dull. The newspapers, domestic and international news and potentially news-rich conversations with friends and acquaintances offer few jolly tales for the holidays. The most recent Middle Eastern crisis in Lebanon is pending since the start of the ceasefire but the belligerence of those involved and the unwillingness of the rest of the world to act as peacekeepers do not encourage hope for long-term goodwill. The situation in Afghanistan and Iraq gets worse as Bush and Blair pursue a goal that we neither understand nor think attainable. 

 We have suffered the chaotic backlash in our airports from the disclosure of a possible terrorist plot and the governments intemperate reaction to it. The deputy prime minister has successfully embarrassed Blair, in the prime ministers absence on a Caribbean holiday, by calling his presidential ally an old cowboy with crap policy. Prescott has articulated publicly and in his own inimitable way what the rest of us think anyway but I doubt the president will lose any sleep over the last ditch harangue of a second-rate has-been. Discussion on his own future and that of his boss has retreated to the inside pages of the newspapers for the holidays and is unlikely to hit the headlines again until the party conference.

 The rapidly growing breed of celebrity magazines thrives as people search for an escape from the daily grind of work and bad news. The magazines feed on the equally fecund celebrity creation television programmes such as Big Brother and Celebrity Love Island, which may not yet be familiar to Indian audiences. These programmes put a lot of not-very-appealing horrible people, who may or may not already be famous or notorious, in a house or on an island where they have to carry out pointless activities under the eye of 24 hour television monitors. Participants attempt to gain viewers sympathies and win votes for themselves. Not, as you might expect, to escape their fellow inmates or castaways but to remain imprisoned. The goal of the winner who survives longest in captivity is a large cash prize and instant celebrityhood. He or she is then in a position to find employment as a commentator on the lives of other celebrities and to build an entire lucrative career on the basis of being slightly less horrible or a little more entertaining than his or her fellows.

 It is a miracle that murder has not been committed although most of the activities of human existence have been, quite literally, laid bare by the intrusive cameras. The incumbents can be incarcerated for up to 10 weeks with no access whatsoever to the outside world until they are voted out. The viewing public, on the other hand, can engage with the prisoners via their televisions at any hour of the day or night, should they choose to tune in. 

 No doubt last nights revelation of this years winner of Big Brother will have produced another news and picture worthy victim for us to pick over in the pages of the trash mags. This time he is a young man suffering from Tourettes syndrome, a condition that causes the sufferer to twitch, speak and shout incontinently and occasionally have a fit. It seems incredible and slightly sick that this should make for excellent television but possibly he won on the sympathy vote.

 Judging by the Advanced level exam results, which were published yesterday, with a greater proportion of children receiving high A grades for the 24th year running, children must occasionally spend time in pursuit of more worthwhile information. The annual press discussion on the lowering of standards to create artificially high levels of success is in full swing. I think it is a hard judgement to make children work pretty hard for their public exams, whatever their other activities, although not perhaps so hard as their Indian counterparts. Whether grades are good or bad, competition for jobs is tough and our childrens lives are likely to be more regulated by government and international convention than ever before. We may live in an increasingly insecure world but I find it frightening and infuriating that we are no longer allowed to take responsibility for our own actions, whether the way we bring up our children or in assessing potential risks to our persons for ourselves. The Big Brother house may just be a foretaste of normal life in the future, with prying eyes recording every move. In 1984, we all congratulated ourselves that Orwells prophetic novel had not come true, but in the 21st century it no longer seems so improbable.

 The terrorist threat provides the best excuse for a reduction of civil liberties that this regulation-crazy regime has yet discovered. It is horrifying that a Labour prime minister can follow in the footsteps of a right-wing republican American president whose propagation of the seeds of fear has allowed a group of neocon megalomaniacs to control Washington and have their hands on the reins of world power. None of us knows the full story of the bomb plot to blow transatlantic flights from British airports out of the sky but the government has turned it into the best propaganda weapon they have had since suicide bombers actually succeeded in killing Londoners in July 2006. 

 There is increasing pressure on the Muslim community here to police itself its leaders are frantically dreaming up measures to do so and failing because extremists are always outside the reach of the mainstream. The growing number of arrests and harassment of ordinary young Muslims is presumably adding to the disaffected minority of the ultimately dangerous by the day. All our lives become less law-abiding as the numbers of laws grow and John Reid, our current home secretary, sounds like a man who would love to declare a state of emergency in order to completely take over our lives.

 Actually it is probably not as bad as that yet, or so we hope. There is still an opposition in parliament and a rising tide of Labour backbench dissent. However, it is easy to look with a very sceptical eye at the orchestrations of our leaders and our government as we allow them to get away with murder under the guise of protecting the country and the population. The theory that the government represents and is accountable to us, the voters, is being worn thinner by the day and it is not impossible to ima- gine John Reids dream and a leap into totalitarianism coming to pass. 

 It is vital that the voting public, who have spent a lot of time in recent years assuming the omnipotence of this Labour government and sitting back to enjoy the strong economy, start standing up and demanding their civil and democratic liberties. We all moan a bit about new health and safety regulations that mean you can barely mow your lawn without a licence for the mower, but we avoid looking at the bigger picture of government take-over. I find it fascinating, when I spend a lot of time working with those building civil society in other parts of the world, that our society should be so fragmented and self-satisfied as to destroy our ability to stand up and demand that our democratically elected government be transparent and accountable to us and not to its neocon role models.

 It may be that the number of holidays ruined by cancellations and delays during the mayhem of contradictory airport security regulations will help to focus peoples minds on what the government is actually doing. It cannot, in fact, guarantee our safety from terrorism and we should only wish for a comprehensible and sensible set of laws that deal with national security and the proven perpetrators of terrorism and put the government on the same side as the rest of the country. 

 Airlines and their staff are also furious about their losses. The cut-price airlines have suffered particularly and their executives are describing the confusion of security measures as farcical. Even pilots are no longer allowed to carry toothpaste or contact lens cleaner on board flights. The chief executive of Ryanair, Europes biggest cheap flight carrier, has threatened to sue the government for compensation unless normal service resumes, saying: We are not in danger of dying at the hands of toiletries. As he also pointed out, whoever and wherever the terrorists are, they must be rolling around, laughing at us.

 JUST TOO LONG

 There are always two ways to look at the same thing. While an oft-heard saying wisely pronounces, ?Justice delayed is justice denied,? another, with equal wisdom, and some degree of sombreness, assures the disappointed that ?the mills of god grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small?. The latter might seem illuminating in the context of the court order requiring the production of the Trinamool Congress leader, Ms Mamata Banerjee, in court in January 2005, on charges of rioting, attempt to murder and damaging public property in an incident in February, 1994. Evidence, especially in cases of this sort, takes an inordinate length of time to begin to be adequate, although a layman may be sorely puzzled at the number of years that have actually elapsed between the event and the court order. But a court passes an order only when it is legally right and necessary. The onus of delay, therefore, cannot be placed on the courts alone. 

 It is the delay in evidence-collection and police action that is routine. When the former Union minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader, Mr Shibu Soren, was finally made to appear before the Jamtara court in 2004, the case for which he was held was a quarter of a century old. Mr Narayan Biswas, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader, was finally produced 16 years after the event in which he was one of the accused, although he had been, as minister in the West Bengal government, daring the police to get him. These are just two examples, but they are symptomatic of a trend, which also manifests itself in the inexplicably long periods that some inquiry commissions take to come to their conclusions, and the peculiar silence with which the submission of many of these reports are then enveloped. 

 To grind exceedingly small, justice needs evidence. The first question is about the possibility of holding on to witnesses ? or their memories ? for decades at a time. People die, vanish or move away. They change their minds. Although the core issue is legal, perceptions are inevitably political. The debate within the West Bengal administration and the CPI(M) over the pros and cons of arresting Ms Banerjee, for example, merely serves to encourage such perceptions. Who ? or which government ? goes after whom during which regime become the only issues of interest ? or boredom. Besides the occasional inaccuracy in such inferences, the unconscious reduction of law and its processes to secondary, or even irrelevant, status is the gravest consequence of delayed justice. The legal process loses credibility, as do the civil institutions engaged in carrying it out. If Mr Soren says, for example, that he cannot remember anything about the Chirudih affair 25 years ago, and asks why he is not being held for later cases in which he has been charged, there is no easy answer. The real victim in the long run is civil society, because losing faith in the legal process is the surest route to instability.

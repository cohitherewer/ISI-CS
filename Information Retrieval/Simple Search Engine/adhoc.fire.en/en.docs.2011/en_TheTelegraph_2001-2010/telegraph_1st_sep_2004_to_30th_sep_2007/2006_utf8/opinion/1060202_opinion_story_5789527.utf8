 A BALANCING ACT

 The BJP has come in the way of the Congress?s teaming up with the TMC to put the Marxists on the backfoot in Bengal, writes Sumanta Sen

 Time to smile?

 In a recent interview, the secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal said that while the BJP openly pursued its economic policies, the Congress is seeking to do the same thing ?behind our back?. That his words are not without merit can be seen in the way the ruling party at the Centre is always seeking to skirt round the common minimum programme and then retracing its steps when the left ?finds out? what is going on. The Congress appears to be pursuing the same path in West Bengal politics.

 Consider the following scenario. Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly announced that the BJP has a definite place in her proposed grand alliance against the CPI(M). Obviously, the Congress cannot be a party to such a formation. Yet the state Congress president is holding talks with her. The question that naturally arises is whether Pranab Mukherjee is trying to make sure that Banerjee parts ways with the BJP or is he working out some other alternative in which the party continues to be a part of the National Democratic Alliance?

 If that is the case then it will not be the first time that the Congress adopts double standards while seeking to counter the left. During Indira Gandhi?s reign, the Congress had quietly encouraged the Shiv Sena to attack leftist trade unions in Mumbai even as it waxed eloquent against parochialism and communalism. Then there is Malda where the Congress is running the zilla parishad with the BJP?s support. Congress leaders in Calcutta have dismissed this step as a minor local matter.

 If the Congress has a covert understanding with the NDA in Bengal this time, will that also be dismissed by New Delhi as a minor state-level matter, especially if there is no evidence of any formal seat sharing arrangement? One suspects it may do just that. So far, the party has said nothing about A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury?s assertion that he will have a mahajot in his district. Chowdhury has also challenged the party leadership to stop him if it can. So when it comes to votes, the Congress is prepared to shut its ears to words that not only constitute indiscipline but also hit out at the party?s declared political plank of not hobnobbing with communal outfits. Mukherjee cannot be expected to be as brazen as Chowdhury and hence his manoeuvres must be conducted in the dark.

 As for the man from Malda, he clearly has another objective in mind. He knows that the bulk of Congress workers in the state desperately want a mahajot. For them, secularism is a mere slogan which need not be taken too seriously. And so if Chowdhury shows that Mukherjee is the main stumbling block, then he will achieve his purpose of cutting down his arch rival in the party to size. He has a personal score to settle with Mukherjee as he is convinced that it was the latter who stopped him from becoming a Central minister. Nobody wants to be seen as the ?fall guy?. Hence, it will not be surprising if Mukherjee works towards the same end as Chowdhury in Malda, but, of course, through whispered parleys. If it works out, he will be able to spread the word among the rank and file that he has been able to get the Congress to have the cake and eat it too ? the party has entered into an understanding with the NDA without tarnishing its secular image. His tact then will be more appreciated than Chowdhury?s bluster.

 In Malda, Chowdhury perceives the BJP to be insignificant in terms of influence and indications are that he will leave a single seat to it. The BJP will be happy and what is more important, there will thus be no split in the votes. Like the ordinary Congressman, Chowdhury has little time for the politics of the saffron brigade. But then which Congressman in Bengal politics has any time for the BJP? Priya Ranjan Das Munshi advised Banerjee to severe her ties with the BJP because the latter has about 4 per cent share of the total votes in the state. To him, and many others in the Congress, it is just a numbers game. And because the BJP is nothing much to write home about in West Bengal, the Congress may well ignore its presence while having a covert relationship with the Trinamool Congress. 

 In such a case, the Congress will have problems with its ally, the Party for Democratic Socialism. The PDS will definitely protest against the Congress?s tie-up with the BJP. Perhaps the Congress will feel that since the PDS is not a force to reckon with, it is not indispensable and it can afford not to pay any attention to its complaints.

 Spare a thought for the Congress though. The party knows that in south Bengal, it cannot achieve much without an adjustment with the TMC and that is what makes the party so desperate. There is also a distinct possibility of desertion from its ranks, more so if Chowdhury sticks to his guns. At the same time, relations with the TMC cannot be made official and hence the need for late night parleys at Nizam Palace.

 But can there be an alliance between the two parties in the state? Banerjee will have to leave some seats for the BJP and as the Congress will be contesting those, will she be able to tell her supporters to vote for the Congress and leave her older ally in the lurch? A clandestine arrangement will see the setting up of ?dummy? candidates by both parties and the purpose of the exercise will be lost.

 It is a strange situation. A party which is practically of no consequence in the state is standing in the way of the Congress joining hands with its kith and kin. The same maybe said about the TMC but from a long-term perspective, Banerjee may gain by staying with the BJP. To her, that is more appealing than to come a cropper after taking a plunge with the Congress. The BJP has nothing to lose and will be happy if the Congress takes another beating in the state. 

 In the midst of all this confusion there must be one thought at the back of the minds of the two Union ministers from Bengal. Can they afford to do anything in the state which may force the left?s hand to withdraw support? Not only will they lose their jobs, they may be forced to sit in the opposition again. So the Congress may keep on talking with Banerjee even as it continues to walk a tightrope all this while.

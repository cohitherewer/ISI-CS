 MAPPING THE BORDERS

 Shifting boundaries

 A little background to begin with. This requirement came into force sometime in the mid-Sixties after the Chinese attack in the North-east. S.Gopal, the eminent historian who was the director of the historical division of the ministry of external affairs at that time, led the delegation for negotiations on the border dispute. The Chinese showed him and his team the first edition of Nehru?s Discovery of India (1946), which carried a map of India. In this map, the North-east was not clearly demarcated, which apparently strengthened the Chinese claim that it was disputed territory. Thereafter the bureaucratic machinery was cranked up and the survey?s permission became necessary.

 Till the mid-Eighties, this requirement led to a lot of hassles which have now been lessened somewhat by rubber-stamping the statutory requirement. All the same, it remains an irritant and quite unnecessary in the internet age when every kind of information is readily available. 

 With the explosion of information technology, is it necessary to have the statutory requirement insisted upon? After all, the most detailed maps are available on the internet.Three-dimensional satellite mapping is now the norm, which can break down the grids into their minutest details. 

 The survey says that scrutiny is still necessary because borders are like ?shifting sands? and should be correctly depicted. Hence the question ? where are our borders? Survey officials remind us that they are not merely the Indo-Pakistan, Indo-Chinese and the Indo-Bangladesh borders. Our borders are also along the coastlines and the little islands that dot the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean. These are subject to soil erosion and therefore borders that lie ?25 nautical miles as measured from the appropriate baseline? need to be revised. This may be tantamount to quibbling, especially for non-government publications that can never be taken as the appropriate authority for settling border disputes. For government and semi-government publications the requirement may still make sense, but certainly not for private or imported publications.

 As far cartography is concerned, it is high-technology that is the driving force today. It will decide whether bureaucratic rules have any relevance any more. Given the speed and sophistication with which the internet provides the most classified information, you can expect to know almost anything on people and places in the remotest corners of the world in no time. Surely, borders are becoming irrelevant when messages and images fly across electronically with ease.

 TARGET PRACTICE

 The Maoists? kindling of tribal discontent is likely to create more situations like the one in Kalinga Nagar, writes Sumanta Sen

 Protests against the Kalinga Nagar killings in Ranchi

 In 1967, tribal villagers at Naxalbari in north Bengal had risen in revolt and their first victim was a policeman, Sonam Wangdi, who was felled by an arrow. Thirty-eight years later, it was again a tribal protest that caused a policeman to die in Orissa. At the north Bengal village, the tribals had responded to a call for an uprising that did not take off. Indeed, it died first in the region where it was supposed to be the first spark to light a prairie fire. The Orissa tribals are fighting for a specific demand ? no taking away of land on which they have lived for ages for purposes of industrialization. Yet it would perhaps be wrong to assume that the specific issue can be so ?amicably? settled that there will be no further unrest.

 It is the context that has to be kept in mind. Orissa, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh ? everywhere there is tribal unrest organized by the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The issue which made the Orissa tribals rise in protest has also been taken up by their brethren in Jharkhand. Elsewhere also, the tribals see themselves as helpless victims of economic neglect, and those who want to view politics as something unconnected with economics (the expression ?good politics but bad economics? makes no sense) would do well to have a rethink. Economic deprivation leads to a certain kind of politics.

 The time has certainly come to go in for a bit of introspection. The tribals are truly the adivasis, but having recognized that fact, society has never thought it essential to give them, by any substantial measure, what should have been their due as the original inhabitants. True, there are seats reserved for them in legislatures, every state government has a department to ensure their welfare, but the essence of the problem has never been addressed. Tribals continue to live on the fringes of national life, both physically and metaphorically. This was the situation even before the concept of a nation was born. On their part, tribals also have passed on to each generation a deep-rooted mistrust for the dikhu or outsider.

 This, of course, has not been the case with the hill tribes of the North-east. A Naga, a Mizo, a Khasi or a Garo has never had his existence threatened in the same way. Christianity also helped, with the missionaries bringing in education and healthcare, and, in general, helping them to remain a people who could not be taken for granted. Above all, they had never been minorities in their own lands.

 In the plains, it has always been a tale of exploitation. What made things worse for them was that the Santhals, Mundas, Oraons were by nature meek and did not see for themselves a life outside the jungles. The dikhus have always had a field day. To ensure that things remained this way they had always treated with suspicion any move at raising the consciousness of the tribals. The latter did revolt now and then, but were always horribly outnumbered. Independence brought a change in official attitude but, as said earlier, largely on paper.

 Worse, tribals have also been let down by their own. In Tripura, for instance, the poor in the hillocks had always been treated as serfs by the tribal kings in Agartala, leading to the armed revolt in the Thirties of the last century which contributed hugely to the birth of the Communist Party there. In Chhotanagpur, Jaipal Singh had stood up for tribals? rights, and then, slowly, was seen to become a part of the system which he had railed against. In today?s Jharkhand, Arjun Munda, the chief minister, may also find himself in the same situation as Naveen Patnaik in Bhubaneswar, while going along with his plans for industrialization.

 Jharkhand has also seen a growing mistrust within the tribals themselves. During the agitation for a separate Jharkhand, Shibu Soren had come to be acclaimed as Guruji. The name remains but it did not help him and his Jharkhand Mukti Morcha win the polls. One reason is said to be the splintering of the original JMM and the corruption among the leaders which, in the past, the adivasis had always associated with life outside their own community. With time, the Bharatiya Janata Party in Ranchi may also appear in the same light.

 One thing needs to be made clear at this stage. It can be nobody?s argument that industries are not needed. But at the same time it needs to be asked for whom is this industrialization? South Bihar (now Jharkhand) had seen the growth of various heavy industries and mines. But did that improve the lot of the tribals? Orissa also has industrialization but even today, tribals are forced to survive on mango kernels which the chief minister describes as a traditional and healthy food. He would have done well to ask himself why kernels have remained a ?traditional? food. Of course, if he had been in the opposition he would most certainly have raised the question as politicians do whenever it suits them. There was a funny report from Bhubaneswar that the former chief minister, J.B. Patnaik, has taken up the tribals? cause. What did he and his Congress do when in office? Why was Kalahandi allowed to become what it is?

 Equally trite is the promise of compensation. What compensation did the tribals all over get when they were denied the right to forest wealth in the name of progress, and later, out of concern for the environment? They cannot hunt for food, cannot fell trees for fire and a little money, and now they cannot till small plots of land since giant factories are supposed to come up to provide wealth and employment, not to them but again to outsiders. There is a greater sense of alienation today, thanks to the growing consciousness. In West Bengal?s Purulia district, the Bandoan killings caused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary to rue the failure of ?party intelligence?. Was that failure an indication of the party getting isolated from the tribals? If so, was that because the ordinary tribal is losing faith in his fellowmen, whom he sees as part of the world of babus?

 So did the arrow at Kalinga Nagar achieve what it had failed to do at Naxalbari? Is a tribal-led revolution round the corner? Only an incorrigible romantic will reply in the affirmative. But at the same time a large area of discontent should cause sleepless nights. The meek are asserting themselves, if not to inherit the earth then at least to find their rightful place in society. The Maoists may not (will not, one is tempted to say) achieve their cherished objective, but the unrest unleashed by them will certainly help discontent gain in depth. Unfortunately on the other side there is neither competence nor imagination to deal with such a situation, which makes it so much more dangerous. Upheaval may not be on the cards, but there can be no comfort if such a threat continues to hang overhead.

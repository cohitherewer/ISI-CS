The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 If you happen to be a frequent traveller on Calcutta?s roads, you will have heard it at some point of time ? from either the taxi driver, sweating it out in his unbuttoned grey suit, or your fellow passenger with whom you so unlovingly share the one-foot long backseat of the autorickshaw. Call it unconventional wisdom if you like, but the point they are hell-bent on making is that there is nothing to get so het up about Bengal not getting enough rain this season. The coming years may, in fact, see even less of it. When you look away thinking that this might just be the parroting of information gathered from the special interest channels, the bomb hits you. The reason why Bengal wouldn?t bother about a rainless monsoon, they insist, is that it would have no use of rain anymore. Eyes popping, you go on listening... Since there would hardly be any agricultural land left, courtesy the Salims and Tatas, there would no longer be any crops to yield, and so no need for water to irrigate the fields. Of what use would the monsoons be then, especially when they mean waterlogged streets, overflowing sewers, inundating rivers... 

 Things were not in working condition between Kamal Nath, Jairam Ramesh and Ashwani Kumar in the commerce and industry ministry. Now the science and technology minister, Kapil Sibal, seems to have joined the riot. Sibal was in London when Nath was addressing the Indo-UK business forum and signing memos of intent. At one meeting, the two came together, shook hands and highlighted the need for greater understanding on intellectual property rights between the two countries. The bonhomie was perfect till Sibal got a chance to speak. Without batting an eyelid, he ventured to state that he couldn?t understand what the commerce ministry had to do with IPR when the world over, the matter was dealt with by the science and technology ministries. Sitting next to him, Nath gave a look that said it all. Within seconds, Nath?s camp was heard wondering aloud why Sibal reaches every destination that is on the commerce minister?s itinerary. The Raisina Hill grapevine could put a finer spin on the rivalry. According to it, both Sibal and Nath fancy being the next external affairs minister. Have they forgotten that K Natwar Singh is yet to call it a day?

 There might be a grain of truth in Mika?s allegation that the chairman of the National Commission for Women, Girija Vyas, is interested only in celebrity cases. For Vyas, it is said, has shown no inclination to help an MP, Tejeshwari, of her own party, in a sexual harassment case. The Congress legislator, who has accused a former Karnataka minister close to the current establishment in the state for sexual exploitation, is apparently running from pillar to post for help. When she contacted the AICC gen-sec, Margaret Alva, she was directed to the Mahila Congress and the state Congress committee. But even there, Tejeshwari is said to have found no sympathetic ear. And Vyas, obviously, is not listening.

 Sharad Pawar continues to be the favourite punching bag of the Congress. At a meeting held to discuss the price rise, as many as 12 Congress working committee members, including ministers, chose to name him and hold him entirely responsible for the state of things. Predictably, Sonia Gandhi did not speak. But every time someone named Pawar, she turned to look at Manmohan Singh. Is there a message for Pawar?

 An oversight can prove costly, as one of the biggest companies of the country realized recently. Like every year, the ONGC took out newspaper advertisements to announce its financial results for the year ending March 31. However, the first few catchwords in bold in the copy had an apostrophe missing. It read ?Igniting the nations growth?. The next day, full pages had to be reserved again for the corrected version, ?Igniting the nation?s growth?, a correction that must have cost the company a couple of crores of rupees.

 For scores of centuries, mangoes have made PR work easy with their taste and smell. Those receiving baskets of this delicious fruit are also obliged to fulfil the wishes of the sender. Pranab Mukherjee is said to have sent the famous Begum Pasand mangoes of Murshidabad to madam and the PM. Wonder what wish he wants fulfilled?

 Dhoti-clad babus are often seen changing into bush shirts or kurtapajama-adorned politicos into safari suits the moment they land on foreign soil. But one hadn?t quite expected a creative spirit like MF Husain to betray the same disposition. The maverick painter seems to have had no qualms in putting his trademark bare feet into designer Italian leather when he was on a visit to London recently. There were even socks to boot. And yet, the bare feet had once been meticulously showcased by Husain to make a personal statement. Initially prompted by health reasons (the acupressure of the shoe-less feet apparently enabled him to sit for long hours on the floor), walking barefoot had become a habit synonymous with the artist. Husain had even entered parliament without shoes with the plea that when one entered a place of worship, it was peremptory for one to remove one?s footwear. How then had he interpreted his visit to London?

 Unfair play

 Sir ? The spat between Sourav Ganguly and Jagmohan Dalmiya may have exposed the ?true? character of the former Indian cricket captain, but it also shows that Dalmiya is no saint either (?Sourav dumps Dalmiya in battle?, July 22). Be that as it may, Ganguly?s attempt to back-stab Dalmiya just before the Cricket Association of Bengal elections is nothing short of a desperate attempt by the out-of-form cricketer to return to the team by pleasing Dalmiya?s opponents in the Board of Control for Cricket in India. It is unfortunate that Ganguly had to stoop so low at the fag end of his otherwise illustrious career. However, Dalmiya?s claim that he does not expect any ?loyalty? from anyone since he no longer heads the BCCI, hints that Ganguly had been loyal to him in the past. But why should personal loyalty matter when it comes to professional cricket? This rather distasteful email saga proves that the Indian cricket team is better off without any of these two former powerhouses of Indian cricket. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The timing of Sourav Ganguly?s email and the disclosure of its contents make it clear that the episode was well-rehearsed. With the CAB elections round the corner, the former captain, with the chief minister?s support, is all set to show the door to his one-time mentor, Jagmohan Dalmiya. If Ganguly believes that it is Dalmiya who had leaked Greg Chappell?s confidential email, which cost him his place in the Indian side, then he could have lashed out at Dalmiya soon after that incident. But with little chance of his getting back to the team, and Dalmiya a spent force, Ganguly obviously thinks now is the best time to venture into active politics. His email supporting the government-backed candidate, Prasun Mukherjee, followed by the snipe at Dalmiya, is the first step towards it.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It has become routine for elected administrative bodies to castigate the previous regime by pointing to the latter?s activities that are irregular or contrary to established rules. Thus it is not surprising that Dalmiya, having lost control over cricket administration, now finds himself in a spot. Yet Dalmiya, as his adversaries would agree, has been singularly instrumental in making the game such a commercial success. The BCCI became one of the biggest beneficiaries of this process, in terms of revenue. Dalmiya?s manipulative powers and business acumen made him an able administrator and secured him the top job in world cricket. Why is a post-mortem of his actions being undertaken now that he is no longer in power? Accountability should be built into the system. Why should the board, which stands for collective leadership, bestow all powers on one individual and then be silent about his actions for years? Misdeeds, if any, should be detected and corrective action taken in time, without requiring a change of regime. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Sourav Ganguly seems to have learnt to play the dirty games which were once played against him. His email at this juncture is being rightly seen by many as a move to appease the BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, and can be interpreted as his last attempt to stage a comeback. Even Ganguly?s fans would agree that his dumping of Dalmiya has been in poor taste. Ganguly has been respected for his outspokenness as a player and a captain. But the latest email will definitely tarnish this image. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The media, which once went to town every time Sourav Ganguly sneezed, is trying to tear him apart now. The former captain has been compared to Aurengzeb, Brutus et al. But shouldn?t the media spare a little more thought on the issue? The historical personalities mentioned are all people who bore a distinct characteristic trait ? their ability to turn situations to their favour, successfully. Could we possibly find a tad of such efficiency in the actions and manners of Ganguly? It is well-known that he was a Dalmiya prot?g? when Dalmiya was in power. When Greg Chappell ?defamed? him, he neither raised his voice in protest nor did he go to court. At that time, the media told us, it was Sharad Pawar who had offered him some crumbs, though only to take them away. Should there be doubts that he would shift loyalty when another crumb is offered? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Bidyut Datta,

 Sir ? Why is so much being made of Sourav Ganguly?s email? How would his comments improve or reduce the hopes (there are hardly any though) of Jagmohan Dalmiya making it to the CAB? Ganguly has long been written off as a cricketer. And now, with his email, he has proved to be a failure even as a schemer. 

 Yours faithfully,

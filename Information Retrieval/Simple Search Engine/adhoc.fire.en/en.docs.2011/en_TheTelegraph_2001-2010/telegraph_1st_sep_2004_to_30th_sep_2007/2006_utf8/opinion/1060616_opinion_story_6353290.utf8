 Larger than life

 Sir ? Americans are busy celebrating the death of the dreaded terrorist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Everyone, from ordinary soldiers to President Bush, has made a statement about the incident. Ironically, this has transformed Zarqawi into a cult figure among ordinary Iraqis and jihadis, and this may lead to an escalation of violence in the region. Zarqawi?s killing should have been yet another day at the office for the American forces. The killing should have been mentioned in military dispatches and the matter should have ended there. Instead, the Americans chose to blow the incident out of proportion, thereby heightening fears of retaliatory strikes. It seems that the West has failed to realize that the al Qaida leadership is a hydra-headed monster. When one cuts off one head, another grows in its place. It is evident that Zaraqawi?s place will be taken up by another person and the bloodshed will continue. Instead of trying to root out terrorism by force, the Americans would be better off trying to rebuild the country and its economy. This will help ordinary Iraqis turn their backs on terror.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

 Sir ? Abu Musab al-Zarqawi?s death is a major breakthrough in America?s fight against terror. Surprisingly, the American success seems to have rubbed off on to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Is this why Vinay Katiyar, a party leader, announced a reward of Rs 1 lakh for civilians killing militants in Kashmir? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Those fighting to liberate Iraq from American occupation were never really happy with the ways of al-Zarqawi. This Jordanian terrorist slaughtered Shia Arabs in Iraq and his sole purpose was to start a Sunni-Shia civil war in the country. Both bin Laden and al-Zawahiri disapproved of Zarqawi?s terror tactics and they even asked him to lower the violence in Iraq. Given this background, the Bush regime?s claims of ?success? in eliminating Zarqawi should be taken with a pinch of salt. Zarqawi was betrayed by his own outfit since he had become too much of a burden. Previous ?breakthroughs? such as the killings of Uday and Qusay Hussein and the capture of Saddam Hussein himself have made no difference to the freedom struggle in Iraq. Therefore it is unlikely that the elimination of a small-time jihadi leader will cast a spanner in the works of the resistance movement in Iraq. 

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir ? The Iraqi society can be broadly divided into three factions ? Shias, Sunnis and Kurds. These three communities do not see eye to eye on many fundamental issues facing Iraq. Hence, it should not have been very difficult for the American intelligence to penetrate Zarqawi?s secret network and gather precise information about his movements. However, what proved fatal to Zarqawi was not American intelligence gathering but the manner in which he gave a sectarian colour to the resistance movement in Iraq. Not happy with attacking foreign troops and institutions supported by the present Iraqi government, he also targeted Shias in an attempt to drive a deep wedge into Shia-Sunni unity in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

G.Raghavendra, Bangalore 

 Sir ? The death of al-Zarqawi in an American air strike brings to mind the wisdom in the ancient adage ?He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword?. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Sarmila Bose?s ?Death by War? is a mischievous attempt to exploit the controversy created by the rejection of the Mukherjee Commission report by the Centre. Bose thinks that she can delude the public with her concoction of half truths and untruths. For instance, it is now a fact that the government of India pays a monthly sum to the keepers of the Renkoji temple. Therefore thanking Japan abjectly for the upkeep of Netaji?s ashes on Bose?s part was quite unnecessary.

 Moreover, Bose lays great import on the Shah Nawaz Committee report submitted in 1956. This report was a result of a bare four-month effort arrived at without a visit to Taihoku, the scene of the crash. It is also surprising to see that Bose does not refer to the 200-page Dissentient Report submitted at the same time by the third member of the committee Suresh C. Bose? In this, Suresh Bose gives irrefutable reasons for his disagreement and details the shoddy manner in which the enquiry was conducted. It is this Dissentient Report, now confirmed independently by the Mukherjee Commission, that should be distributed widely. The Netaji Research Bureau, established by Sarat Bose, should join hands with the concerned authorities in this endeavour. Bose also refers to ?pitiful attention seeking individuals? who have held the subcontinent ransom to conspiracy theories regarding Netaji?s death. Identifying these individuals is critical for it would help us know who have exploited the Netaji connection to gain personal and political capital.

 Yours faithfully,

D.N. Bose, Calcutta

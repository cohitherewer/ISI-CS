 Travel to be happy

Big neem, Red Jaguar and Mrs Samson?s Lammergeier 

(Rupa, Rs 295) by Ranjit Lal refers to three incidents, which, 

according to Lal?s parents, ?are a result of...overheated imagination and too 

much free time?. They might have added that their son drew his literary inspiration 

from the likes of Rushdie and Garcia Marquez. Anirudh, a bored and neglected teenager, 

has a strange set of friends that include ?a crochety-voiced? neem tree and a 

?pretty ghost with leopard eyes? by the name of Ambi. Our young hero sets out 

on a journey to uncover secrets in the hills, an expedition that turns out to 

be the most exciting ride of his life. The line between fact and fiction get blurred 

in this delightful book which is bound to enthrall young and old leaders alike.

 Spiral (Orbit, ? 2.99) by Andy Remic is the story of the conflict between good and evil set in the distant future. Remic imagines a world in which Spiral, a secret organization, fights fanatics and rogue states. But the tide turns and the organization comes under attack itself, bringing the entire planet close to destruction. Part sci-fi and part trash, this book would be a perfect present for corporate executives who travel a lot.

Eat, Pray, Love (Bloomsbury, Rs 495) 

by Elizabeth Gilbert must have been conceived after a screening of one 

of the Bridget Jones movies. Liz, fresh from a bitter divorce and an affair that 

leaves her miserable, goes in search of happiness, spending her time learning 

Italian from brown-eyed twins in Rome and the tricks to attain enlightenment in 

an ashram in India and is finally taught to sit still and smile by a toothless 

sage in Bali. Funny and tender, Liz?s travels might help those who are in search 

of a happier life.

 The Suragi tree (Mapinlit, Rs 395) by Prabhaker Acharya traces the contours of a journey that spanned six decades, starting from a small village in Karnataka, passing through the city of Bombay and ended amidst the idyllic settings of Karnataka again. The protagonist, Sudhakar Rao, moves away from a life in a small village, and ends up teaching English literature at a place far from home. In the course of his travel, friends and family fall by the wayside even as Rao finds his way back to his roots. Rao?s tale is rich in symbolism and has been written in a tone which is rather desolate.

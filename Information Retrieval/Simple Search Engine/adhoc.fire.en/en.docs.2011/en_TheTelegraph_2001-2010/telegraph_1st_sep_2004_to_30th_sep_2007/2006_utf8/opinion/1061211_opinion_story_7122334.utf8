The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AFTER THE DEAL

 The passage of the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Act of 2006 through both Houses of the American Congress will be counted as a major landmark in bilateral relations. The act also has a wider significance for Indias role and place in the international system. Only the formality of a signature by Mr George W. Bush is needed to make the bill law. While there continue to be apprehensions about the nuclear deal within sections of public opinion in India, it is clear that the benefits far exceed the costs. The concerns that exist could be ironed out in bilateral negotiations and the 123 agreement that should now be signed between New Delhi and Washington. 

 The nuclear deal signals recognition of India as a major player in the international system by the worlds only superpower, the United States of America. This is the first time that Washington has made such a major exception in its non-proliferation policy for any country. The act does circumscribe aspects of Indias nuclear estate by international regulations, which would obviously impose some restrictions, but New Delhi would, by and large, retain its strategic autonomy. Nor would Indias nuclear deterrent capability be really compromised. Instead, the country should witness the robust growth of the now-almost-stagnant civil nuclear programme. It has been clear for many years now that for new reactors, for safety technology, for best practices followed in the nuclear industry and especially for nuclear fuel, it had become important to circumvent the international nuclear regime. Neither an old ally, Russia, nor a new enthusiast, France, would be able to exert enough pressure to suitably modify Nuclear Suppliers Group guidelines to give India access. Only the US had the weight and influence to be able to adjust the nuclear regime in order to accommodate India. This has now been done.

 It is, of course, essential that New Delhi remains cautiously optimistic throughout the implementation process following the enactment. Three issues merit serious concern. First, the essence of the deal is reciprocity. It is vital that this tit-for-tat approach is maintained throughout the implementation process. The Indian government must move towards implementing its side of the bargain only once the US government has implemented its side of the deal. Second, the adjustments should bring greater freedom for India to do business with all countries possessing advanced nuclear technology. Third, India must not be seen as a junior player of an American global strategy. While it should not be reluctant to accept American support to become a major player in Asia and beyond, India needs to retain the space from which to carve out its own equations with Tehran, Beijing and other countries.

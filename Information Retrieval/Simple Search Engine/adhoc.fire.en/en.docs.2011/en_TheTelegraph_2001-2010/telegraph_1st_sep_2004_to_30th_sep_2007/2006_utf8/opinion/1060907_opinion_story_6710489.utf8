The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Three in one 

 Moni Adhikary can still recall the day her husband Tapan 

 broke his leg for the second time in a year and his career 

 as a rickshaw-puller came to an abrupt end. With a little 

 money from her mother, Moni set up a small paan shop 

 that would help her make ends meet. Then Monis brother 

 came up with the idea of a bhaater hotel and offered 

 to make the extra investment for it. Thus came up another 

 shack next to the suburban train station, offering cheap 

 but wholesome meals to railway workers, masons, sweepers 

 and all who passed by. About 25 years ago, this hotel 

 morphed into a cholaikhana where people could have 

 lunch by day and country liquor after five in the evening. 

 Moni insists that the suggestion to add booze had come from 

 her regular clientele. While she had hesitated, Tapan had 

 gone ahead with the upgradation, believing that the family 

 income would grow. He was right. But with the money came 

 trouble. Moni is ambivalent about her apprehensions at that 

 time. At work, she exudes the resigned efficiency of those 

 who do a job well by doing it everyday for the better part 

 of their lives without the leisure to reflect on it. 

 Although Tapan wanted to take over when the business re-invented itself, his alcoholism and ill-health kept matters in Monis more reliable hands. She employs six workers from the adjoining slum and the occasional part-timer. Three years back, her cousin Rani joined as a business partner. The place looks like a dhaba from where respectable men and women, coming off the trains on their way back home, buy rotis and/or tarka in the evening. At about six, the afternoon customers start returning for bangla and satta. Men from the slum are usually on the monthly register; during the first week of every month, passengers on the railway platform opposite are treated to the spectacle of drunkards being ejected by Monis two sons and brother for not clearing dues. Moni confesses that the brawls used to unnerve her to start with. But over the years she has learned, if not to not care, to scream out an admonishment and, if the situation seems to get out of her control, ask one of the men to clear out the troublemakers. But this does not mean that she successfully browbeats every boor on more than one occasion she has been beaten up or molested, once by her husband for refusing to serve free liquor to his buddies. And her son, Raju, threatens her regularly over money.

 There is another source of trouble for Moni this one has to do with the third service her business offers to regular customers and to desperate babus. The bhaater hotel aka cholaikhana is also a mini brothel with half-a-dozen girls from the slum and a few outsiders who are today full-fledged sex-workers. While these girls do not solicit customers on the railway platform, it is an open secret in the middle-class neighbourhoods that their men father, brother, son do stop by at the bhaater hotels by the station, especially in the evenings, for reasons neither gastronomic nor purely spiritual. But the last business is not professionally organized. Perhaps because of this, even sober customers sometimes mix up the women running the business, women who are customers and the women offering sexual services. Monis own daughter and her daughters-in-law have been pawed too. 

 Prostitution and illegal liquor are the pretext used by the police to conduct their periodic raids on Monis establishment and the adjacent ones. Rani is convinced that the raids are undertaken every time some lower-end officers at the thana need liquid cash in a hurry a conviction Moni does not share, although she admits that the police are usually bribed with cash and/or kind. But apart from her husband or sons being taken away for the night and released without much fuss the next morning, the raids never have any permanent consequences. Not unusual, when junior police personnel constitute a part of the regular clientele. The toddy-tarka-sex trinity exists despite and, in fact, because of these binaries of protection and exploitation. 

 Moni does not hesitate to talk about her life and her trade (although she did not choose her shop as the venue for her interview, fearing her husband and sons and hopes the English language will keep this story out of her immediate society). But she is particularly reticent about her daughter Shampa. Observing the daughter at work does not really help since she spends most of the time at home. One suspects that she has run away from her in-laws and her husband does not inquire after her anymore. Neighbours say that Shampa, unlike her mother, has taken to drinking. Another disruption Monis household has learned to live with is Rajus mysterious disappearances, with money from the cash counter, twice or three times every year. 

 Moni gets through the days work but admits feeling vulnerable as she ages. What she does not doubt is that without her the family would starve. She fears physical violence at the hands of her husband and sons three individuals incapable of working consistently for more than a week at a time; she fears their unthinking impulse to pick a fight with one and all. It is Monis alertness and commonsense that has fed the family for more than a couple of decades. 

 The family dreads any expansion plan of the railways or the civic authorities. Station expansion, road-building, house-building do mean money and more customers. But in this microscopic manifestation of globalization, local economic development pushes the Moni Adhikarys farther to the fringes. Already costs of running the show have increased fourfold over five years. If, in the end, Moni moves or gives up the business altogether, it is the boorish working-class customer who is going to admit missing her while the middle-class pot-bellied babu will be forced to agree with the women of his house that it is good riddance -- sighing quietly all the while.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COSTLY ERROR

 The commerce minister has applied himself single-mindedly to his portfolio, and pursued his ministrys concerns with characteristic energy and aplomb. One cause he has taken especially to heart is the promotion of special economic zones. Various incarnations of SEZs have been around since the Sixties. The underlying idea has been that Indias high import duties handicap import-intensive exports, and that the solution is to create establishments or areas which can import inputs and equipment duty-free on the condition that they export all or a substantial part of their output. Earlier policies of this kind have failed. Such zones have not attracted many firms; those they attracted kept complaining about harassment by customs, asking for more concessions and agitating to be allowed to sell more in the domestic tariff area. Their exports have been minuscule.

 The United Progressive Alliance government came to power with the belief that earlier arrangements failed because of lack of infrastructure; Chinas incandescent export performance was believed to be because of its excellent infrastructure. So Mr Kamal Nath proposed SEZs to be set up by private and public parties that would be given considerable tax incentives to set up infrastructure. Since the concessions involved heavy loss of tax revenue over a long period, the finance ministry resisted strongly. But Mr Kamal Nath steamrollered the opposition, pushed through the SEZ Act and gave the policy a momentum. He has been so successful that business houses have been queuing up to set up SEZs. He has just persuaded the cabinet to remove the ceiling on the number of SEZs; now they can sprout all over the country as fast as state governments can give them land.

 Even at this late stage, however, the government should think again. The country is littered with industrial estates and parks set up from the Sixties onwards. They are either populated by the ruins of failed undertakings, or have been diverted to new uses such as software production. Business houses that have taken plots in them hoard them in the expectation that policies will change, land prices will rise and they will make a killing. Mr Kamal Nath would argue that the SEZs are different that those who set them up will have to invest heavily and create superb infrastructure something that the country admittedly lacks. But if infrastructural investments are to create exports, they should not be strewn all over the country; they should be concentrated close to ports and airports, of which no more than a dozen would deserve special treatment. Above all, software exports have changed the fortunes of the country. Our problem is not lack of exports; it is to spend all the foreign exchange that exports are raking in. What the country needs is Special Import Zones. Or better still, the government should abolish import duties; that would turn the entire country into an export zone without any effort on Mr Kamal Naths part.

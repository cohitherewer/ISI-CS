The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOO MUCH PUBLICITY KILLS 

Bookwise

The basics first. Successful marketing of books depends 

upon collaboration between the writer, the publisher and the media. The publisher 

and the writer have a common interest in high sales, and the media are eager to 

collaborate with them because developments in print and communications technology 

have led to a vast diversification of media outlets. All of them have an inexhaustible 

appetite for raw material. Discussion and gossip about books and writers are the 

cheapest source of raw material. The media picks up all the juicy stuff which, 

the publisher and writer think, would provide them publicity. But the scorecard 

at the end of day may be very different.

 Stale read

Take Pervez Musharrafs memoirs, In the Line of 

Fire, as a test case. These may be early days but the scene pans out like 

this. The media here has skimmed off the cream. The Pakistan press too has gone 

to town with the book and its critiques. Quite apart from the fact that there 

is no such thing as non-egotistical autobiographical form, some commentators have 

reminded us that the whole book is just an ego trip as a prelude to the generals 

re-election next year. Whatever the case, there has been a publicity overkill 

which makes the publisher and author believe that it would lead to a bumper sale, 

say of 20,000 copies in India alone, which would be followed by a Hindi translation 

of presumably the same number of copies.

Precise figures are hard to come by but a ball park 

figure tells us that a total of 12,000 copies have been imported by the key distributors 

so far; you may add another 3,000 copies of direct orders by booksellers, which 

make a total of 15,000 copies. Although this is not something to scoff at, it 

is not as great as the hype would make us believe. Why? There are three reasons 

at least that the book would die out very fast. 

First, there has been far too much publicity, too 

many critiques that have taken the topics of interest to pieces. Every single 

angle of the Kargil war has been explored, the lies exposed and the general 

described as a liar. With so much exposure, there isnt much more to read about 

the Kargil conflict. Much the same could be said about Musharrafs formula to 

solve the Kashmir problem. At least two national newspapers have carried details 

of the formula and commented on it in editorials and op-ed pages. Again, there 

is not much more to read than what has already been published. 

Second, although topicality is one of the factors 

that make for sales, it tends to grow stale quickly. Overexposure does precisely 

this; when the contents have all been spilled out, why buy the book? You could 

check it out in a library, if need be. Third, there is a fundamental flaw in the 

book itself. A memoir is not, strictly speaking, an autobiography. It is an account 

of the authors encounters with interesting people. A memoir is autobiography 

without the risk of not only laying oneself bare to public view but of exposing 

oneself as essentially dull and pompous. But this is how the general shows up 

to the reader. Why, then, buy the book when the little it contains has already 

been out in the media?

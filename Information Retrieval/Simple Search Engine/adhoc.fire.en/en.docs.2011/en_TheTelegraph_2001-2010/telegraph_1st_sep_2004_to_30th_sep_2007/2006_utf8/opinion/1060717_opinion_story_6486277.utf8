 NO MERCY FOR THE OFFENDER

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the draft bill of the Offences Against Children Act, 2005

 Cognizability of offences ? all offences under this Act shall be cognizable. Provided that offences punishable under sections 19 (corporal punishment), 21 (bullying), 25 (other forms of abuse) and 30 (false complaints) shall be cognizable only for the purposes of investigation of such offences and for the purposes of matters other than the arrest of a person without a warrant...

 Bail ? excepting for offences under sections 19 (corporal punishment) and 21 (bullying), which shall be bailable, all offences under the Act shall be non-bailable-

 Provided that no person accused of any sexual offence against a child shall be released on bail or on his own bond unless the public prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the application for such release, and where the public prosecutor opposes the application, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is not guilty of such offence... 

 Compounding ? excepting for offences punishable under sections 19 (corporal punishment) and 21 (bullying), which shall be compoundable with the permission of the court, all offences under the Act shall be non-compoundable.

 Prohibition of remission ? notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being enforced, no sentence awarded under this Act for sexual offences shall be suspended or remitted or commuted.

 Release on probation ? nothing contained under section 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973... shall apply to a person convicted of a sexual offence under chapter II, unless such a person is under 18 years of age.

 Fines ? all fines payable under this Act may be determined by the children?s court or any other court...based on the capacity of the accused to pay. Proceeds of any fines imposed as part of punishment for any offence under the Act would be payable to or for the benefit of the aggrieved child, under procedure as prescribed. All amounts recovered as fines are to be deposited in a fixed deposit with a nationalized bank for a term which will extend until the child attains majority. The children?s court may direct that the interest be used for the upkeep of the child and the principal retained until the child attains majority. 

 Save as otherwise specifically provided under this Act, offences including but not limited to commercial sexual exploitation, child pornography and trafficking, the children?s court may in the case of habitual offenders order confiscation of all self-acquired assets from the proceeds of the crime. The proceeds from such assets are to be applied to the welfare of the child victims in accordance with the procedure laid out for fines...

 Community service ? in case of any offences mentioned in sections bullying, corporal punishment, other forms of child abuse and neglect under this Act, the children?s court may determine that the interests of justice are better served by directing the offender to do community service and may impose a ?community penalty? on an offender... 

 CONCLUDED

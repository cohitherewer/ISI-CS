 WITH FULL FORCE

 Gwynne Dyer

 Hizbollah certainly started the fight (by crossing Israel?s border and taking two soldiers hostage), but it is not clear that either Syria or Iran is the mastermind behind the operation. Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hizbollah, is perfectly capable of taking this initiative on his own.

 Nasrallah knew that the Israeli retaliation for the kidnapping would fall mainly on innocent Lebanese (because they are much easier targets than his elusive guerrillas), but he doesn?t care. He had a few surprises up his sleeve, like longer-range rockets that could strike deep into Israel and radar-guided ?Silkworm? anti-ship missiles to attack Israeli warships that used to shell the Lebanese coast. And if he manages to fight Israel to a draw, he will come out of this as the most popular Arab leader since Nasser.

 Maximum damage

 General Dan Halutz, the Israeli chief of staff, was also spoiling for a fight. His major concern has been that Israel?s ?deterrent power? has gone into decline, and he wanted to re-establish it. Some Israeli defence analysts believe that the plan for the massive strikes against Lebanon has been sitting on the shelf for years, awaiting a provocation that would justify putting it into effect. But what does ?deterrent power? actually mean? 

 Understand that, and you understand the remarkable savagery of the Israeli attacks. Of course they are a ?disproportionate use of force?, as French president, Jacques Chirac, called them the other day. That is the whole point. Israel?s ?deterrent power? lies in its demonstrated will to kill and destroy on a vastly greater scale than anybody attacking it can manage. Its enemies must know that if one Israeli is killed, a dozen or even a hundred Arabs will die.

 This has been the dominant concept of Israeli strategy from the very foundation of the state, and the ?kill ratio? in all of Israel?s wars down to its invasion of Lebanon in 1982 conformed to that pattern. The first time it didn?t apply was in the struggle between Israeli troops and Hizbollah during Israel?s prolonged occupation of southern Lebanon in 1982-2000, when the Israelis were managing to kill only a few Hizbollah guerrillas for each of their own soldiers who died.

 Turn of the tide

 Hence the perceived need within the Israeli armed forces to demonstrate that Israel can respond with massively disproportionate violence even to minor attacks. In the case of the Gaza Strip and the kidnapping of the first Israeli soldier by Hamas militants on June 25, the operation went more or less according to plan, because the Palestinian militants have little to fight with. The casualty ratio there has been over twenty dead Palestinians for every Israeli killed. But Hizbollah is a much more serious opponent.

 After a week of mutual bombardment, Hizbollah still has at least three-quarters of its rockets left. A large part of northern Israel will remain under attack from the skies ? not very accurate attacks, but about one rocket in a hundred kills someone.

 Even more worrisome for Israel is the fact that ?deterrence? is not really being re-established. A great deal of Lebanon?s civilian infrastructure is being destroyed, but the kill ratio is only about six-to-one in Israel?s favour.

 This is not just a hiccup; it is evidence of an inexorable shift in the terms of trade. Israel will remain unbeatable in war in the future, but the good old days of cheap and easy victories are not coming back again.

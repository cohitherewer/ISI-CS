 Letters to Editor

 Freedom song?

 Sir The editorial, For a song (Aug 24), states that citizens in a free country ought to be free to express (or not express) their national sentiments in whatever way they want. This view, when extended, seems to suggest that they also have the right to express views that go against a nations interests. The fact is that many devout Muslims are guilty of deeds that are prohibited by their religion. But the community prefers to overlook such violations of the principles enshrined in the Quran. But the moment there arises a question of singing Vande Mataram, Muslims come out in protest, as if the sanctity of their religion depended on this one song. One must remember that a majority of Muslims supported the Muslim League and M.A. Jinnahs two-nation theory, and considered the Congress-led independent movement as a predominantly Hindu struggle. The slogan adopted by the Indian National Congress in their fight for freedom was Vande Mataram. Hence, Muslims have always perceived this song as a Hindu mantra. This idea has been passed from one generation to another in the community. To suggest that the present controversy is banal is to ignore a matter of considerable national importance.

Yours faithfully,

Sir As someone who left Islam to embrace Christianity, I too cannot bring myself to sing Vande Mataram. The reason is quite simple. The song glorifies idol worship and refers to only Hindu deities. Little wonder then that Gandhiji was against the singing of songs which catered to Hindu sentiments in public functions attended by non-Hindus.

 Sir Arjun Singh is at it again. First, the human resource development minister made it compulsory for schools all over the country to sing Vande Mataram at an appointed hour on a certain day to mark the centenary of the national song. Then, shockingly, he changed his mind and made the singing voluntary so as not to hurt minority sentiments. Vande Mataram, composed by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay, should be regarded as sacred as the national anthem for all Indians. It must be made compulsory in schools to inculcate a sense of unity among children who practise different faiths and hail from different parts of the country. How can a minister then make an exception for a particular community when it comes to singing the national song? The oppositions grouse on this issue is justified. Singh should realize that such retrograde steps only foment divisions in our society. The claim made by Muslim clerics that the song goes against the principles of Islam is ridiculous. No religion can forbid singing in praise of ones motherland. The clerics should go back to the holy book and verify this fact for themselves.

 Sir The refusal of a majority of Muslim leaders to sing Vande Mataram has once again shown how difficult it is for Muslims to integrate with the mainstream Indian society. Muslim leaders have cited religious reasons for not singing the national song. If this is indeed the case, then they also have to explain why they have no qualms in accepting the government subsidy for haj when the Quran says that only those who can afford the expenses need to undertake the journey. If certain un-Islamic practices can be deemed acceptable, why raise a hue and cry over a patriotic song?

 Sir The political establishment may have been satisfied over the proceedings during the monsoon session, but in reality, they were a huge disappointment. None of the concerns of the public were discussed adequately. Worse, the ruckus raised by the opposition over a non-issue such as the Vande Mataram controversy raises serious doubts about the credibility of one of Indias apex institutions. The parliament definitely needs to have more informed debates and resolutions.

Yours faithfully, 

Pranav Sachdeva,

 Sir The mudslinging between political parties over the singing of Vande Mataram is an example of the erosion of the values that informed Indias freedom struggle. After witnessing the minority communitys refusal to sing the national song, one can understand why our freedom fighters dream of an united India went to waste. The position taken by the minority community is an insult not only to our country but to the memory of all those who laid down their lives for freedom. One must not forget that Vande Mataram is not merely a song. It was a mantra which united the nation during our freedom struggle. Indians must learn to rise above religious and social differences. Arjun Singhs decision to make the singing of Vande Mataram voluntary was taken to appease Muslims before the elections in Uttar Pradesh. This proves that politicians can even forget to respect the countrys national song in order to keep their vote banks intact.

Yours faithfully, 

Arnab Sarkar,

 Sir Of Vande Matarams five stanzas, only two were sanctioned for presentation in public, citing Muslim sensitivities. Now, after the objections raised by the Muslim brethren, one suspects that the song will be discarded altogether. One wonders what will come next. 

 Perhaps, it will be the turn of our national anthem, which includes a salutation to a deity-like figure, the dispenser of Indias destiny. This might also hurt the feelings of the minority community as their religion abhors idolatry. India definitely has some duties towards its Muslim minority, but surely the minorities have some obligations too? Primary among these is being respectful to the nation. 

Yours faithfully, 

J.S. Acharya,

 Sir In the din raised after Arjun Singhs controversial decision, one has forgotten to enquire whether Vande Mataram is a religious song. So many died at the hands of the British with this song on their lips. Did it not voice the spirit of freedom of an enslaved nation? Now that India is a free country, it is sad to see Indians losing their belief in sacred icons. For our politicians, protecting the votebank has become a more important duty. Not many seem to understand that these small gestures go a long way in compromising values and ethics. 

 Arjun Singhs decision will no doubt adversely affect the unity of our composite society, thereby threatening the very concept of nationhood. Are we to keep quiet in the fear of being dubbed communal? Every Indian should raise his voice in protest before its too late.

Yours faithfully, 

Shyamal K. Sinha,

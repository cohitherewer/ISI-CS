 The girls 

 in the backroom 

 WORKER WIVES

 In homes and election offices, women 

 may be the real but unseen heroes

 ?However much you strut about 

 outside,/ Get home and the wife will take your hide./ In 

 the home, Mian?s a zero,/ Bibi?s the real hero.?

 [Baire jatoi karo na phutani,/ 

 Ghare-te elei bibi-r dhantani./ Barite Mian zero,/ Bibi-i 

 ashole hero.] 

 ? MLA Phatakeshto 

 Everyone loves the funny politician, 

 all bluster among his followers and henpecked in the house. 

 But the bogey wife is funnier, reduced by the humorous male 

 voice, and stuck firmly at home. Who are the women being 

 ridiculed here, ever so gently?

 It could not be Nayana Bandyopadhyay. 

 Far from the nagging shrew, she is the perfect supportive 

 helpmeet. Her position is unique: she is the sitting MLA 

 (who won on a Trinamool ticket) of the same constituency 

 from which her husband, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, is running 

 as Congress candidate this time. As a campaigner for her 

 husband, she asks her electorate to vote for him.

 In our pick of the wives of candidates 

 and campaign leaders, and of women workers, she is an MLA 

 herself. So political shifts do not bother her. She has 

 been inspired in her change by Sonia Gandhi?s sacrifices. 

 In place of Didi (Mamata Banerjee), Pranabda and 

 Somenda are now there to guide her. 

 But Nayana has to balance her 

 acting with her own political career and that of her husband. 

 Today she is the candidate?s ideal wife. Visiting party 

 workers constantly need tea, and she orders out if there 

 is a crowd. That?s a change from her mother-in-law?s days: 

 Nayana remembers her making handis of tea. Now she 

 gives Sudip tea, toast and fruits for breakfast; makes sure 

 he is carrying water, towels and a change of clothes on 

 the campaign trail, and has half a cup of rice and fish 

 ready for lunch, soup and sandwiches for dinner. This is 

 as pretty as a picture, ready to be filmed. 

 But voices can be different. That 

 of the mother of Firhad Hakim, Trinamool councillor, Ward 

 82, is distinctly so. She was unenthusiastic at first about 

 her son?s political activism, but supports him now. Yet, 

 she voted left as long as Mani Sanyal was alive despite 

 her son?s leanings. That choice was her own.

 the way it runs

 Choices are of different kinds, 

 like households. Sati Chatterjee, wife of Salil Chatterjee, 

 CPI(M) candidate from Cossipore, said: ?The way this house 

 runs could be a little different from other houses. That 

 is because my husband has been active in politics for over 

 two decades. [He was the councillor of Ward 7 from 1985 

 to 2005 and has also been borough chairman.] So the house 

 is always full of people, who drop in at all times. I have 

 to address their queries besides running the house.? It 

 is just a little more hectic during election time. Looking 

 after her husband?s health, ensuring that he has his medicines 

 and noon-jal, is one of her extra jobs then. Sati 

 may not be an MLA, but she has been a member of the local 

 CPI(M) Mahila Samiti for 20 years: ?I am not known simply 

 as Salil Chatterjee?s wife, and I enjoy my role. A lot of 

 people who come here actually come to meet me rather than 

 my husband.?

 Would she have acquired this identity 

 had she married into a non-political family? Maybe the answer 

 is to be found in the way she recalls her marriage: ?I was 

 married [in 1971] into a household that was active politically. 

 The situation was very new to me. For days I would not see 

 my husband. He was living outside Calcutta, his life under 

 threat. My father-in-law would smuggle me out of the house 

 to meet him in the weekends.?

 Sati has her daughter-in-law, 

 Maulisri, looking up to her. For this young lecturer, too, 

 marrying into a political family has been illuminating. 

 She is more aware now of the problems of people in the slums, 

 for example, and admires her mother-in-law?s efforts to 

 help them.

 Mutual admiration among these 

 artists of identity circulates within the home. Hakim?s 

 mother admires her daughter-in-law, Ruby, whose adaptability 

 has made her son?s career possible.

 Ruby Hakim, too, campaigns when 

 her husband is a candidate. This time, when he campaigned 

 for his party, she would have to stay awake late, discussing 

 perhaps an error in a leaflet with her worried partner. 

 He is always busy, but during campaigns he is out of the 

 house by 6.30 in the morning and not back before midnight. 

 She runs the house, looks after her children and in-laws, 

 and helps in her husband?s business.

 The councillor?s wife is a ?medium? 

 between him and the people, taking phone calls, directing 

 the ?boys? to get the occasional ambulance, ensuring that 

 her husband signs the right papers when a widow?s allowance 

 falls due. While talking, she runs upstairs several times, 

 calls out instructions, answers her children, directs the 

 driver, gives money to men going in and out, talks business 

 with an employee, gets ready to take her 15-year-old for 

 tuition and go to office because it is pay day. Hakim returns 

 with a string of men before she leaves. Ruby arranges for 

 their refreshments, jokes with her husband, instructs her 

 baby to eat properly, scolds a maid mildly for breaking 

 a tumbler, then picks up her bag to get going.

 There is an intriguing sameness 

 in the stories. Jhuma Ghosh, wife of Atin Ghosh, the Trinamool 

 candidate from Baranagar, often hops over to the election 

 office from her Nalin Sarkar Street home to see if the workers 

 have eaten or if allotted money has been correctly utilized. 

 She runs the house and looks after her teenage daughter 

 and sometimes their business. These women may be the real 

 heroes, but not quite Phatakeshto?s type. 

 The boudi is ?placed? by 

 the address, her political role erased by her social one. 

 Loora Sarkar, whose husband is Subhankar Sarkar, former 

 state chief of the Chhatra Parishad and secretary of the 

 state Congress committee, says that politicians? wives are 

 their best friends, sometimes doing their most confidential 

 jobs, and also their worst critics.

 In this world of strangely wrought 

 equalities, support is taken for granted. No one complains 

 about extra work. And there is no point, Loora says, in 

 cribbing about the lack of privacy. For unlike the gentleman, 

 whose home is his castle, the politician?s home is his office. 

 Even the most glamorous boudi of them all, Nayana, was shocked 

 to find strangers in her bedroom soon after marriage. 

 Politicians, says Loora, cannot 

 and do not spend time with their families. She, too, copes 

 with child, home, and work, and with endless telephone calls 

 meant for her husband. Family holidays, even honeymoons, 

 just do not happen. Ranjini, the wife of Partha Pratim Biswas, 

 CPI(M) candidate from Tollygunge, is happy with her little 

 daughter and her music. She feels, as do Sati and Ruby and 

 Loora, that her husband is just busier than usual at election 

 time. She has to field more phone calls, and he can spend 

 even less time at home.

 If there are conditions to this 

 support, they are not visible. Or audible. In this new game 

 of Family Values, the realities of power and violence, the 

 nuances of ideology have nothing to do with the achievements 

 of the favourite boy. The recognition of realities is replaced 

 by a faith in ?doing good?. Confusing social work with politics 

 is a reassuring exercise. Ruby, for example, does not mind 

 being ?sucked into? her husband?s passion for politics, 

 because Firhad genuinely loves helping people. It is a belief 

 ? in partners, sons, fathers ? echoed by the others. Jhuma?s 

 mother-in-law accompanies her to election offices as does 

 her sister-in-law. Ranjini?s mother is proud of her jamai, 

 and her mother-in-law too has faith. 

 Family loyalty is easily the winner 

 over freedom of choice. 

 Home and the world

 Social good is the key to the 

 commitment of women party workers as well. Women workers 

 are displayed by all parties as a measure of their political 

 correctness. They work devotedly, their partymen 

 say, moving from door to door in between their household 

 chores, mobilizing their ?friends? for processions and meetings, 

 distributing voters? lists, without stipends or other benefits. 

 Badal Bhattacharya, the chief election agent for Somen Mitra, 

 Congress MLA from Sealdah, feels they are more committed 

 than men. The women in the office of Khalid Ebadullah, the 

 Congress candidate from Entally, were only too eager to 

 talk about their commitment and the support they get from 

 their families. The men all around watched them keenly. 

 They seemed to exert a concerted will to end the chat as 

 soon as possible. 

 To go by the men, the lives of 

 candidates and their colleagues are models of harmony, both 

 in and out of home. Badal Bhattacharya says his wife, Bani, 

 knows the demands of a political household well, having 

 married him in 1969, when he was the Chhatra Parishad general 

 secretary. His home is forever open to party workers and 

 that makes Bani ?happy?. Ebadullah, whose wife we could 

 not meet because his family had to ?fly? somewhere on business, 

 said, ?I am speaking for them.? They are very happy, he 

 said, they have no problems.

 Invisible hierarchies, like glass 

 walls, divide the world of women workers. The headquarters 

 of the Trinamool Congress, which is said to have 30 to 35 

 per cent of female worker participation, and the highest 

 percentage of women candidates, was a male bastion at 10 

 in the morning a week before Calcutta went to the polls. 

 Men wandered around either freshly bathed or in their nightclothes, 

 talking on their mobiles and casting sidelong glances at 

 the female intruder waiting to ask them questions. She sensed 

 they were wondering how best to shoo her away. She was sent 

 away to Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, West Bengal Trinamool Mahila 

 Congress president, who would answer all her questions. 

 Not all walls can be seen.

 A different class

 It is gruelling work on the streets. 

 Female foot-soldiers across parties are all from the lower 

 or lower middle-classes. Chandrima Bhattacharya, West Bengal 

 Mahila Congress president, who says that 7,000 to 8,000 

 women have worked for the assembly elections, claims that 

 the ratio of participation of women to that of men is equal 

 at the basic level. There is no difference in the work. 

 Female participation is greater in villages, although literacy 

 levels there are lower. Is that an argument for reservations? 

 But what about rising out of the 

 ranks? Jayanti Banerjee of the Pashchim Banga Ganatantrik 

 Mahila Samiti and member of the Calcutta district committee 

 of the CPI(M) admits that the foot soldier can at most become 

 a leader at the primary level. Poorer women are limited 

 by their inexperience. Leadership and organization are given 

 to middle-class women. 

 The hierarchy of values within 

 the home matches the hierarchy of gender and class outside 

 it. Harmony is kept in place by internal ? and internalized 

 ? forms of control. In the office of Mita Mitra, Trinamool 

 councillor of Ward 74 in Chetla, who campaigned for Tapas 

 Pal, Swadesh, her husband, tells the women workers in a 

 low voice, ?Speak carefully (Shabdhane katha bolbe).?

 According to Kakali, the Trinamool 

 Congress has 10 workers per polling booth. But not one party 

 can show off a female chief election agent. Badal Bhattacharya 

 says it is too hectic a job. Women are comparatively less 

 educated, say the women leaders, and they lack skills to 

 manage a booth. (Or is it violence?) Besides, household 

 duties clash with the sleepless hours of an election agent?s 

 job. Most often, male leaders decide what the women will 

 do. But chauvinism alone is not at fault, says Chandrima. 

 There is a social history to take into account: ?Women like 

 to lag behind (Meyera pichhiye thakte bhalobashe).?

 Even Sati Chatterjee, apparently: 

 ?The responsibilities of a leader or an MLA are very different 

 from that of an ordinary worker. I don?t think I have the 

 time or the resources, or even the confidence, for such 

 roles. I straddle two worlds, the private and the public, 

 and I wouldn?t like to sacrifice either.?

 Sushama Singh or Maya Dey, Trinamool 

 workers under Mita Mitra, straddle two worlds too. Sushama, 

 whose husband is an auto driver, wakes up at 3 am to collect 

 water. She does the housework, gets her children ready for 

 school, comes to the party office at 10. At 12.30, she goes 

 home and cooks lunch, is back in the office by 5, and goes 

 home four or five hours later. Neither she nor Maya thinks 

 of contesting elections. They are proud to be close to Mamata 

 and Mita, and happy to be of use. They look to their didis 

 to address their problems.

 Freedom is made of many colours. 

 Of what are choices made?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FRONT RUNNER

 For all its new clout in national politics, the left remains a small political force in India. Its presence is negligible in states other than West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. For many years now, the left has been chasing the illusion of a ?third front? in order to extend its influence beyond these three states. The left?s decision to return to a partial alliance with the Telugu Desam Party for the coming panchayat polls in Andhra Pradesh is one more attempt to that end. The left severed its past links with the TDP after the latter had allied with the Bharatiya Janata Party. This attempt to revive old ties betrays the left?s failures as well as its dilemma. It shows that after all these years of failed experiments with the so-called third front, the left has not found any new way to expand its support bases in other states. This failure has led the party to try and hang on to the coattails of regional parties. Thus, the left?s national ambitions have seen it trying to forge opportunistic alliances with Mr Lalu Prasad?s Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar, Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh or the Asom Gana Parishad in Assam. The futility of such politics was proved once again by the AGP-left combine?s poor showing in the recent elections in Assam. 

 However, the real import of the attempted third front lies in its bearing on the left?s relations with the Congress. Clearly, the left wants to use the idea of a third front to keep the Congress under pressure. This seems to be the real political context of the left?s latest endeavours for alliances with parties other than the Congress and the BJP. No matter how unreal the idea of the front, the left would like to prop it up from time to time in order to force its agenda on the Congress-led government at the Centre. That is why the left, while supporting the Manmohan Singh government, behaves more like its opponent. The BJP?s allies in the previous National Democratic Alliance government were not half as confrontationist toward the alliance leader. If the left?s desperation is increasingly showing, it is because of its inability to change the government?s ways. It is safe to predict that the left?s current attempts at front-building would be as futile as the ones in the past. Its pressure tactics are unlikely to make any difference to the Congress. Also, they may not open up new pastures for the left. But then, leftists love to keep up pretences.

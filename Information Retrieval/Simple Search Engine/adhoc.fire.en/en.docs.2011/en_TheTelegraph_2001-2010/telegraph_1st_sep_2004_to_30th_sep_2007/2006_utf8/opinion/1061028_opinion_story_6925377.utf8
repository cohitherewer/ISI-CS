 CLEAN, BUT WHERES THE SHEEN?

 Despite having been in politics for over four decades, A.K. Antony has never quite made a name for himself as an able administrator or even as a canny politician

 A wag in the South Block yes, there are wags in the unlikeliest of places insists that the new minister of defence, not quite clued in about the colours of uniform, asked a senior Indian Air Force officer the name of the ship he commanded. It was a joke, no doubt scripted by a cynical bureaucrat, to underscore the fact that the minister did not know his MiG from a Maruti, or a frigate from a fridge. 

 But Arackaparambil Kurian Antony, 65, would have no problems with the claim. His forte, his supporters will tell you, is not in-depth knowledge of matters related to defence. Let others be remembered for the defence deals they inked: A.K. Antony, aka Mr Squeaky Clean, will always be known for his integrity. 

 Indeed, as a walking advertisement for detergents, there is nothing that you can add to enhance the image of the minister from Kerala: Antony is to integrity what the late Pramod Mahajan was to, well, fundraising. And this is a trait that even political foes endorse. To be incorruptible in a party like the Congress is a remarkable virtue, says Keralas Marxist minister for education and culture, M.A. Baby. 

 But there are, clearly, two sides to the proverbial coin. The man who is honest in his work and life is also known for lack of efficiency in administration. Despite having been in politics for over four decades he had three short stints as the chief minster of Kerala and was a minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos central government Antony has never quite made a name for himself as an able administrator, or even as a canny politician. 

 The problem, curiously, stems from the fact that Antony is an honest man. Because of this worry that something may taint him, he is often indecisive, says a Kerala politician. And lack of decision does adversely affect administration. 

 Not surprisingly, Antonys tenures he has been elected five times to the Assembly and thrice to the Rajya Sabha have all been lacklustre. And indecisiveness, his critics hold, has been his hallmark. In fact, things havent changed much since Antony first became chief minister at the age of 37. Old-timers recall that he walked up hesitantly to take his oath of office, almost like a coy bride. 

 Thirty years on, the trepidation still lingers. Im like a student in the first standard. Ive to begin from scratch, says Antony. This is a challenge Ill face with the cooperation of all. 

 In defence circles in New Delhi, there is some consternation about the new ministers inability to take hard decisions. To top it, officials are concerned about his habit of remitting office at the drop of a hat his chief ministerial and cabinet stints all ended with sudden resignations. 

 But defence is a ministry that requires difficult decisions. On the anvil, for instance, are several would-be deals worth billions of dollars. He takes over at a critical time when there are very big decisions to be urgently taken on defence acquisition, says a ministry watcher. And unlike (his predecessor) Pranab Mukherjee who had political clout and could get things to move in the government if anything got stuck, Antony is a political lightweight who cant do so. 

 Antonys critics, in fact, are waiting for the man to trip. We have one more opportunity to assess Antony, says former chief minister K. Karunakaran who had been involved in a bitter fight with Antony for years. Im concerned about the countrys security, says Karunakaran. 

 But Antony has no reason to worry his image will carry him forward. In a morass called Congress politics, his honesty will always be legendary. His media managers stress that he is a man who sold LIC policies to make both ends meet. And the only property he possesses is a house that his wife, who works for Canara Bank, acquired after taking a loan. 

 He has no time for favour-seekers however close they may be to him. In fact, once, when he was made chief minister, he didnt even arrange for a pass for his wife for the oath-taking ceremony. 

 During his last tenure as chief minister, he even donated every official gift that he received to a museum. Among them were two gold watches gifted by the Kuwait government. Antony told the media that he had not shown the watches to his wife, Elizabeth, in case she was tempted to keep them. 

 But thats Antony, the curious politician. On the one hand, he does noble things that few of his contemporaries ever do. On the other hand, he makes sure that people get to know about his actions. 

 A contemporary recalls how, when he stepped down as the minister for civil supplies in 1995 in the aftermath of what was called the sugar scam Antony had an official function to attend. His resignation was still to be accepted, but Antony decided he wouldnt take the office car. Instead, he got into an autorickshaw a move that was promptly pointed out by his supporters to local reporters and duly covered. 

 But that didnt surprise anybody, for Antony has always been media-savvy. Once, on a flight from Delhi to Cochin, Antony made it a point to shake hands with every passenger on board. 

 Some would say thats a politician. Others would say, going by his track record, he should have waved goodbye.

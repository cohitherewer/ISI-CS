 THE IMPORTANCE OF COOPERATION

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Besides ordinary or regular inspections, there may be special inspection visits, follow-up visits or team visits, each of which has its own set of prerequisites, methods and consequences.

 Inspection may deal with specific issues (e.g. occupational safety and health) or it may address all aspects of protection of the workers. An integrated approach is obviously more cost-effective, but it is also more demanding and requires a higher level of competency.

 Special visits may concern the investigation of accidents or complaints or the collection of data; they may also be ordered specifically to detect and deal with cases of illegal child labour. Often, inspections for the purpose of investigating illegal forms of employment are organized as team inspections, involving agents from outside the inspectorate such as labour administrators...other government agents, experts or monitors from NGOs, and possibly others. Efficient inspection also depends on the rigour with which follow-up visits are undertaken.

 Such visits must be made if an employer has been ordered to take certain action within a specified period, after which he or she faces legal charges. Follow-up visits are also useful when a new regulation or policy has been introduced and the inspector wishes to ascertain whether the requisite action has been taken. In programming its inspection activities in respect of child labour, it is important to give it due priority and a specific allocation of time or ?inspector days?, to prevent the work being squeezed out by other functions. 

 ...Inspection visits to workplaces may be initiated by the inspection service itself or prompted by complaints from the public. Normally complaints are made by those affected ?the victims ? or by their representatives. However, child workers or members of their family do not normally report instances of child labour (except perhaps in cases of forced labour), because their circumstances are such that they see no alternative and they therefore have an interest in perpetuating it. They may not even know whether there are laws against it.

 Members of the public... could play an important role in reporting child labour; in most countries where child labour is prevalent specific abuses are rarely reported, but heightened public awareness and better training of inspectors can increase the number of complaints.

 Labour inspection alone cannot solve the problem of child labour. But it can certainly make a very valuable contribution if the conditions are right. This means cooperation with the ministries of education, health, social affairs, etc., whose mission it is to protect the safety and welfare of the public in general, and of children in particular. It means cooperation with local authorities, who can help locate the establishments employing child labour and facilitate access for the labour inspectors.

 It is essential to establish good working relations with employers and workers organisations and others,...who can assist labour inspectors in carrying out their duties. The importance of cooperation and coordination has to be emphasized because it creates an atmosphere where the labour inspectorate is viewed not only as reporting on violations but as working together with all the actors involved towards the elimination of child labour.

 LORDS OUT OF TIME

 Rituals are often bits of history surviving as habit. They are enacted almost unthinkingly, but on reflection, might be seen as embodying attitudes or relations that have been carried forward, in some form, into the present. The Supreme Court has refused to spend too much time thinking about whether judges should continue to be addressed as ?My Lord or Lady?, referring the matter to the Bar Council. But a forum of ?Progressive and Vigilant? lawyers thinks that the practice is colonial and should be done away with in a modern democracy and republic. It is true that the Old English origins of the lord are in the hlafweard or bread-keeper, evoking the darkest of feudal patriarchies. Here the lady, interestingly enough, was the hl?fd?ge or bread-kneader. These figures then passed through the Middle Ages, lording over their serfs, while the words gained another kind of elevation and gravity in religious discourse. 

 It was, of course, the British and their wonderfully resilient language of class that fixed for the colonies the ?modern? connotations of the lord and the lady, with elements of self-caricature built into this language itself. Not only the upper house of parliament, but also such eminences as the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chief Justice and Lord Bishop carried the title into the other estates as well, giving rise to the ?lording? of the judges in the colonies. This stuck on, and became expressive of the dignity and inviolability of the office itself. It also came to be associated with everything that was spectacular and indeed theatrical about the courts, especially the higher ones.

 The challenge for a modern democracy lies in honouring that dignity while being true to the critical and egalitarian spirit of modernity. In India, particularly, the issue is more philosophical than the mere nitty-gritty of forms of address. Confronting the reality of corruption in the courts, the entire matter of the accountability of judges has to become part of public democratic discourse without undermining the authority and autonomy of the judiciary. Hence, the ordinary citizen?s critical, and even slightly alienated, distance from the rituals and accoutrements of law, its pomp and ceremony, need not amount to disrespect or contempt, but could foster a healthy and empowering form of consciousness that is valuable for a democracy. The problem is not so much with the residual colonialism of these practices, as with the uncritical acceptance of the theatricality of power. 

 This is the spirit in which traditional forms and rituals might be fruitfully interrogated, and changed. And if the law is to be purged of antiquated colonialism, it might be a better idea to start looking at the actual contents of, say, the Indian Penal Code, rather than worrying about whether ?My Lord? should become ?Mr Justice?.

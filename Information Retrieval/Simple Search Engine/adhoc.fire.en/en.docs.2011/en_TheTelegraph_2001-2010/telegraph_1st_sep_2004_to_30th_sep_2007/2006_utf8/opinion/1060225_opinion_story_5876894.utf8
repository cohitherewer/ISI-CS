 Letters to Editor

 A cruel end

 Sir ? While out walking, I saw three boys torturing some ducks. While two boys kept kicking the birds, the third was beating them with a stick. There is no point in blaming the children though, especially when adults are guilty of the same crime ? health officials in Navapur have been killing chickens with sticks (picture on page 6 of The Telegraph, Feb 21). One can imagine the pain the birds endured while being beaten to death. Couldn?t the authorities come up with a painless way to cull chickens?

 Yours faithfully,

 Empty rhetoric

 Sir ? In ?Reveries of equilibrium? (Feb 20), Ashok Mitra says that he is against free trade and argues that economics should be returned to ?its ancient pledges?. However, it needs to be pointed out that two of Mitra?s heroes, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, were both advocates of free trade. They contended that by resorting to free trade, countries can specialize in industries in which they are more productive, thereby achieving higher social gains. But for this, they would have to refrain from imposing tariffs or import quotas. 

 This is where international bodies like the World Trade Organization come in as they help nations to move towards free trade, at the same time, controlling the speed of this movement through bargaining at the international level. Therefore, the spirit of the WTO, unlike Mitra?s claims, is in keeping with the theories proposed by Smith and Ricardo. The job of such bodies is to ensure that weaker countries do not lose out to stronger ones given the imbalance in power equations in the world order. To help weaker nations attain higher bargaining power, trade groups like ASEAN, BIMSTEC have been formed on the basis of their regional proximity, levels of economic development, and ideology. Perhaps, Mitra also ought to be reminded that there has been much progress in modern economics since the days of John Hicks. Maybe, it would be a good idea if Mitra takes a break from ranting about free trade and concentrate on the real issues at hand. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra continues to dwell on outdated ideas in his columns. Mitra writes that Marx ?strove to prove that whatever production takes place in society is the exclusive contribution of labour...the fruits of such production should therefore belong in entirety to the working class?. What Mitra does not say is that Marx was na?ve to believe that production alone is the cause of economic success. Profit,in fact, depends on managerial skill. If a company lacks an efficient management, it would incur heavy losses despite high production. As for the Pareto Optimum, which states that nobody in society can be better off without somebody being worse off, it is sheer nonsense. Multinationals pay better wages than small firms, offer better services to people and are doing good business themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Many parliamentarians celebrated International Day of the Mother Language by speaking in their respective mother tongues (?On bhasha diwas, it?s Bengali on the floor?, Feb 22). This may be heartening, but does the government have a clear policy to promote regional languages? State education departments tend to promote the mother tongue but students face a lot of difficulty if they wish to pursue their vernacular in another state. It is time that the Centre did something to promote the numerous regional languages of the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Chayanika Roy, Calcutta

 COURTLY INTRIGUES 

 - Sonia Gandhi?s leadership style is proving costly for the 

 Congress 

 Pratap Bhanu Mehta

 In his ?travelogue?, From Sea 

 to Sea, Kipling, while observing courtly intrigues in 

 princely Rajasthan, suggests something to the effect that 

 courtly politics can be far more intense than real politics. 

 In actual politics, the politician has to submit himself 

 to a nebulous entity called public opinion; ambition has 

 to be tailored to a real ability to sway people. In courtly 

 politics on the other hand, the only thing that counts is 

 second-guessing the monarch?s wishes. This, paradoxically, 

 fuels the wildest ambitions. All kinds of individuals, who 

 might not be able to sway the masses, who might not have 

 real strength of character or brilliance of intellect, think 

 they can do two things: embarrass rivals, and ingratiate 

 themselves with the sovereign. A lot depends upon the signals 

 the monarch sends. Who does he intend to put in charge? 

 What does he want done? What are the limits no one is allowed 

 to cross? Kipling writes, ?It must always be borne in mind 

 that everything that has been done, was carried through 

 over and under unlimited intrigue, for Jodhpur is a Native 

 State. Intrigue must be met with intrigue by all except 

 Gordons or demi-gods; and it is curious to hear how a reduction 

 in tariff, or a smoothing out of some tangled Court, had 

 to be worked by shift and byway.?

 When Kipling wrote this, Jodhpur 

 was undertaking serious reform of its court and justice 

 system. In order to make it a success, Jodhpur appointed 

 a ?Punjabi Sirdar?, Har Dayal Singh. Kipling?s gloss on 

 this was: ?it is not easy to circumvent a Punjabi.? He then 

 went on to pay Jodhpur and Har Dayal Singh a compliment, 

 ?The details of his work would be dry reading. The result 

 of it is good, and there is justice in Marwar, and order 

 and firmness in its administration.?

 Even if we mind Kipling?s attribution 

 of characteristics to ?native? states, or Punjabis, it is 

 difficult to avoid seeing the resonance of this episode 

 in what is unfolding in Delhi. During the last few days, 

 it has become apparent that there is no longer a single 

 government in Delhi, but a succession of ministers jostling 

 for limelight, ideological prominence and sheer power. In 

 every episode, whether it involves Arjun Singh or Saifuddin 

 Soz or H.R. Bharadwaj, the prime minister?s position is 

 becoming more reactive than proactive. On a range of issues, 

 from the Nepal crisis to Naxalism, from reservations to 

 Narmada, you begin to wonder who exactly is in charge. The 

 image of the government is unravelling, not under demands 

 from the allies but by each minister appearing to chart 

 his own course. The ?non-political? head of this drama, 

 the prime minister, who, in his own ?dry? way, is supposed 

 to be the source of justice, order and firmness ? as much 

 of a statement of a political philosophy we will ever have 

 ? is being easily circumvented to the point where the agenda 

 of his own administration does not appear to be under his 

 control.

 Delhi is a town where there are 

 as many narratives as there are insiders. So no one is quite 

 sure what exactly is happening inside the Congress party. 

 Whose ambitions are creeping or soaring? What shape does 

 the party want to give to this country? Where does it stand 

 on crucial issues like reservations? There is no doubt that 

 the prime minister?s authority is being challenged and dissipated 

 on a range of important moral and constitutional matters, 

 and the prime minister has not done enough to recuperate 

 his own stature or vision. But equally, there is little 

 doubt that the blame for much of this disorder lies squarely 

 with Sonia Gandhi. When the ?Queen? does not make her ideological 

 intentions clear, or puts her weight firmly behind her chosen 

 men, intrigue and ideological uncertainty are an inevitable 

 consequence. Every courtier feels empowered to vie for the 

 coveted position of diwan, every policy choice becomes 

 plausibility, and there is no one at the head who cannot 

 be circumvented.

 For what it is worth, I have argued 

 that extending reservations to other backward classes in 

 Central institutions is not warranted for a variety of reasons. 

 Whatever one?s views on extending reservations to the OBCs, 

 the manner in which the debate has come to the fore is a 

 disgrace to the Congress. In any scenario, the party looks 

 bad. If Arjun Singh took the initiative on his own, why 

 is he being tolerated? If he did not take the initiative 

 on his own, why does not the party have the courage to own 

 up to its convictions? Arjun Singh is correct in one crucial 

 respect: the issue of reservations has been on the radar 

 since the constitutional amendment enabling it was passed. 

 If the party, to this point, has no considered view on the 

 subject, then it is either being extremely evasive, or it 

 takes important decisions in a fit of absentmindedness. 

 Either way it looks bad.

 What Sonia Gandhi?s leadership 

 style has done within the Congress is add to ideological 

 uncertainty and factional intrigue. There is one policy 

 measure that Sonia Gandhi has made her own: the employment 

 guarantee Scheme. For a brief moment, she appeared to salvage 

 her reputation by resigning from her seat, not as an act 

 of sacrifice but because it was the right thing to do. It 

 is often difficult to fathom what she thinks of a range 

 of important issues. But what emerges from her actions is 

 a style that is a throwback to the days and ideological 

 predilections of Indira Gandhi: a distrust of genuinely 

 popular local leaders, undue tolerance of the improprieties 

 of those whose power depends upon her, little respect for 

 constitutional norms, little attempt to articulate the core 

 convictions of the party, and an emphasis on an improvised 

 populism rather than serious reform of the state. The circumstances 

 are different: Sonia Gandhi is not Indira Gandhi, and India 

 itself has transformed beyond recognition. But the Congress?s 

 ideology and culture are still struggling to catch up. The 

 Congress is doing its best to sow the seeds of the kind 

 of reactionary politics that was a result of its stints 

 in power.

 Sonia Gandhi?s leadership style 

 imposes many costs on the Congress: it has long prevented 

 its organizational renewal, and the stress on loyalty over 

 propriety has saddled the cabinet with ministers who are 

 constitutional and intellectual liabilities. But its most 

 corrosive effect is deeper and often unremarked: it has 

 created a party where there is almost no leader whose thoughts 

 are their own. There are few ?intellectuals? who can be 

 forceful qua intellectuals. As Congress party members, 

 they are reduced to fitting into a paradigm rather than 

 helping to shape it. In fact, the remarkable thing about 

 what Arjun Singh did was that he actually took a policy 

 initiative and claimed responsibility for it. But what the 

 party has spawned is a culture of second- guessing what 

 Sonia Gandhi might think, and second-guessing is not the 

 same as thinking.

 Is the current tussle between 

 the prime minister and Arjun Singh a genuine tussle? Push 

 comes to shove, do they really have opposed views on reservations? 

 If they do, why has Arjun Singh been allowed to go this 

 far? Or is it like the moderate extremist duet the Bharatiya 

 Janata Party used to put on to allow Atal Bihari Vajpayee 

 to have his cake and eat it too? If, indeed, the prime minister 

 does not share Arjun Singh?s views, then this particular 

 round of courtly intrigue has got to be a fight to the finish: 

 it is difficult to fathom how the prime minister could continue 

 to tolerate a minister who has openly challenged his authority. 

 Or will the prime minister fall more in line with the Arjun 

 Singh-view of the world? Unfortunately, the answer to whether 

 Manmohan Singh, unlike Kipling?s Har Dayal Singh, can be 

 circumvented may not lie in his own hands: it will depend 

 upon Sonia Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MORE THAN LOCAL

 All politics may be local, but not all issues are the stuff of petty, local-level politics. The Naga insurgency, one would assume, is too serious a matter to be mired in small-time politics. It is unfortunate that some politicians of Nagaland are bent on scoring partisan points over how to deal with the militancy. That seems to be the problem with the argument by the chief minister, Mr Neiphu Rio, that the state government can do little to tackle the conflicts between two militant factions. It is not difficult to see why Mr Rio wants to put the ball into the Centre?s court. True, the Naga peace talks and the ceasefire are largely matters between the Centre and the militant outfits. The trouble with Mr Rio?s argument is that it is clearly aimed at shirking his government?s responsibility in dealing with the law and order problem. He is right when he says that the Naga insurgency is a political, and not just a law and order, problem. But, the problem can only get worse if the state government evades its own responsibility. The impression cannot be avoided that Mr Rio, who heads an anti-Congress alliance, blames the Congress-led government in New Delhi for political reasons. It is much the same for the Congress leaders of Nagaland who would like to put all the blame at Mr Rio?s door. 

 The short-sightedness of this brand of politics is truly amazing. The Union and the state governments, one assumes, would put their heads together to try and find a solution to the insurgency. It is the oldest militancy in the North-east, that had its beginning immediately after India?s independence. It is also the inspiration behind most subsequent ethnic militancies in the region. And, like the other insurgencies, the Naga one has split into different factions over the decades. Contrary pulls by these factions have been a serious problem for New Delhi?s peace processes since the Seventies. Politicians are expected to try and help these groups come closer and thereby bolster the peace plans. If the recent factional feuds among these groups have caused serious law and order problems, Mr Rio should make common cause with New Delhi in order to tackle them. The Centre?s peace talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, are at a crucial stage. This is no time for a game of political one-upmanship.

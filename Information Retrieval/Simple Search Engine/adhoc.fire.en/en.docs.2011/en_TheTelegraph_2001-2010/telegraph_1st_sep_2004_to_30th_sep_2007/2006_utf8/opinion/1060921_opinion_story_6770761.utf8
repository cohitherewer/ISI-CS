 BLOOD ON THE STREETS

 Neha Sahay

 The unimaginable has happened. In a country where private e-mails are spied upon and international internet sites blocked, a graphic video of a citizens protest being broken up by the police and then turning violent, was doing the rounds in the internet. The video, which circulated for about a week before it was blocked, showed police chasing unarmed people, cars overturned and windows smashed, and even a group of policemen beating a bloodied protester.

 The first protesters were high school students, marching in disciplined rows to protest the alleged cover-up of the sudden death of one of their favourite teachers. One day she was joking with them in class and discussing the next days assignments; the next morning, they heard she had committed suicide by jumping off her apartment building.

 The teachers relatives and close friends smelt a rat, specially since she had confided in them that her husband, a wealthy businessman, used to beat her. Her diary substantiated the abuse. When the local police refused their demand to interrogate her husband, sticking to his version that she jumped off because she had a mental disorder, the students decided to protest. Carrying a red banner saying: Too many doubts! Where is Justice?, they marched through the main streets of the small town in their uniforms.

 The students also posted an open letter to the public online, describing how vivacious their young English teacher had been, how full of plans for their future, how she had doted on her two-year-old son. How could someone like her have committed suicide suddenly, they asked, that too in her underwear? The letter, signed by the entire Third Year Class, also questioned the peoples guide, the media.

 Breach of trust

 A few days later, small groups of citizens gathered in front of the local government headquarters. The police arrested some of them, sparking off a mass protest the next day. As police tear-gassed those who had turned up at the main plaza and the road outside the husbands factory, fleeing citizens broke the window panes of the government building and the windshield of the husbands Honda, and overturned rows of cars parked outside the factory.

 The overwhelming turnout at this protest that had been organized largely through word of mouth and the internet, was remarkable. In India, dowry deaths used to provoke protests by women two decades ago when the womens movement was at its peak. But, even then, the turnout was never large enough to fill up a main road, despite painstaking efforts to get together as many women as possible. Here, both men and women were on the streets. Westerners in China were repelled by the police violence perpetrated on the peaceful protesters. They were even more shocked when informed by Indians that had such a protest taken place in any small town in India, there may well have been a few deaths due to police firing.

 Its been predicted that globalizing the Chinese economy would inevitably lead to a freer society. Videocams and mobile cameras are cheap here; and the people technologically savvy. Surprisingly, the ever-tightening controls on the internet did not seem to have frightened these protesters. Significantly, the first woman to post the video warned viewers against attacking the government.

 Her warning was ignored; promptly, her site was blocked. Whats amazing is that the video remained on the internet for a week, moving to other sites as soon as one was blocked, long enough for millions of surfers to have heard the students cry: In a society under the rule of law, something infuriatingly unjust has happened! Our rights become so pale and powerless in the face of money! How will the people ever trust the government again?

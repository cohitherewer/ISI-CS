 BEHIND THE AUTHORS VEIL 

Bookwise

 How to be a ghostwriter 

Heres a true story to begin with. Sometime in the 

late Seventies, Virago, the all-womens house devoted to exclusively feminist 

books, published a novel, Down the Road, Worlds Away by Ms Rahila Khan. 

The theme was topical and the writing, crisp: an immigrants experiences in London 

and the painful process of adjustment in an alien environment that also raised 

the question of multiple identities. But Ms Khan, who submitted the manuscript 

by post, refused to meet her publishers face-to-face. She is believed to have 

said that her religion did not allow her to meet strangers without her veil. If 

the veil could not be removed, what was the point of a meeting? In any case, all 

editorial queries and changes could be clarified by post.

So it was done her way and the book published amidst 

much acclaim. Three weeks after the author had received the statutory authors 

copies under the contract, a white man, Reverend Toby Forward, revealed that he 

was the author and that Ms Khan was his pseudonym.

This revelation raised some questions. First, is it 

necessary for a publisher to meet the author face-to-face, especially when it 

comes to a first-time book? Second, are ghostwriters a necessary evil whose identities 

should be kept under wraps? Third, does it really matter what sex a writer happens 

to be or for that matter what colour? 

Yes, it is necessary for a publisher to meet the author 

face-to-face for both to size up the kind of person he or she would have to deal 

with. Publisher-author relationships are always tenuous; they extend far beyond 

the signing of the contract and the published book. There are questions of promotion, 

sales, royalties that crop up and misunderstandings that arise. It is necessary 

therefore that the publisher knows the psyche of the author to handle the many 

problems that crop up after the baby is born. Publishers believe that authors 

are prickly characters who have to be handled with care and the best way to do 

this is to sort out the differences that arise from time to time. Correspondence, 

which is rather like the computer-generated responses we get for our complaints 

these days, is no substitute for a one-to-one meeting. 

Ghostwriters are much more widespread than before 

and many have come out of the closet now with the demand that they should be given 

a share of the advance and royalties. Take autobiographies or memoirs for instance. 

Autobiographies arent auto any more; the as-told-to technique is taking over. 

Celebrity figures under deadline pressures say what they remember into a recorder 

for shaping by professional writers who then polish it up and lace it with anecdotes. 

But it is not just autobiographies where ghostwriting 

is rampant; it is equally prevalent in academic books. Sometimes these ghosts 

are research assistants but more often they are professional editors with wide 

writing skills. In fact, it is no longer a secret deal, it is out in the open, 

with the author acknowledging the assistance in his Introduction to the book. 

Of course, the assistance comes with a heavy price tag, depending on the quantum 

of work that needed to be done.

Ghostwriters are very much a part of the publishing 

game. They are the backroom boys who are constantly in demand because very few 

of the big and the famous can actually write. Their copy needs to be revised or 

completely rewritten before being published.

Of course, sex, colour, caste or creed does not matter 

any more; what does is good and relevant writing for the reader. But if you are 

an attractive young thing, a pretty face on the back cover takes you a long way 

to getting published. The backroom boys can always do the writing.

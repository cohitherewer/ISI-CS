 DARK CITY, SHINING PAST

 A New Dawn: Patna Reincarnated 

 By Sudhir Kumar Jha, S.K. Jha, Rs 395

 Bihar, a smart alec once said, is a BC state. The point is not without substance. If you look at the history of Bihar before the birth of Christ, then it is difficult to explain how it descended to the state it is in today. The area covered by the province known as Bihar was the birthplace of Gautama Buddha, of Chandragupta Maurya, of Kautilya and of Ashoka. The present capital of Bihar, Patna, known in ancient times as Pataliputra, was also the capital of Indias first centralized empire, the Maurya Empire. But as one moves towards years after the birth of Christ, the achievements of Bihar seem to dwindle till in contemporary times it has acquired the dubious status of Indias most benighted state.

 Sudhir Kumar Jha, who was a student of history before he became a police officer, is passionately fond of Patna, the city where he studied and grew up. His book is not about the ancient glories of Pataliputra. On the contrary, he concentrates on modern Patna and its importance. He presents his views with great conviction and lucidity. There is an intermingling here between a police officers firmness and a historians analytical skills.

 Under the English East India Company, Patna emerged as a major commercial centre. It became the collection point of commodities en route to Calcutta. The area called Bihar was originally part of the Bengal Presidency. The new province was born with the partition of Bengal and formally came into existence on April 1, 1912. This naturally gave Patna an enormous boost since it became the capital of a new province with its own secretariat and high court. Jhas account actually begins from here.

 Jha describes the various institutions of government and civil society that came to be established in Patna and goes on to sketch the spread of the city. From a small town, Patna grew into a city. Jha also provides thumbnail portraits of personalities he considers to be the movers and shakers of modern Patna.

 There are two chapters which are of special interest. One concerns the society of modern Patna where Jha speaks of the various groups that made up Patnas society from the Bengali bhadralok to the Anglo-Indians. The other is on sports. Cricket in Bihar has a long tradition and Jha does a service to history by retrieving the contributions of long-forgotten players. I was surprised that there is no mention of the redoubtable Shute Banerjee, who moved from Bengal to captain Bihar in the late Forties.

 The most significant aspect of Jhas book is that he does not give politics the central place in his narrative. This enables him to tell the story of a city. Jha, an amateur historian, has done what a professional historian should have done a long time ago.

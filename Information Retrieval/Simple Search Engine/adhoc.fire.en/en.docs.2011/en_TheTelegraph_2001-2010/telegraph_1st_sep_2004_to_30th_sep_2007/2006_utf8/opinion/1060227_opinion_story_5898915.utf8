The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN FULL VIEW

 The very rich can get away with murder ? and everything else ? as long as the victims are less rich. Or less well-connected. This is the rather obvious moral of the Jessica Lal story, one which has outraged the whole nation. The outrage is expected, but the accompanying amazement presupposes an innocence difficult to believe in. The slow progress of Lal?s murder investigation, the lapse of seven years before the trial since the initial confessions by the alleged murderer and his helpers and the witness testimonies, and the acquittals of all the accused, enacted a subversion of the justice system at which no one living in India can pretend to be surprised. What made the case dramatic was that the murder occurred in full view of a large number of witnesses in one of the playpens of the rich and glittering, and had seemed what was once called an open-and-shut case. The importance of the Lal murder lies more in its high visibility than in its unusualness. And because the event was so visible, the justice system needed to be seen as dependable, impartial and efficient, and not fizzle out like a damp squib at the end of the process.

 The delay itself augured ill for the justice-seekers. Especially since there were charges of tampering with evidence against some of the accused from the very beginning. The trick with the vanished gun and motherless cartridges, that proved so crucial in the defence, provides glaring evidence of tampering. What cannot be denied any more is the role of some policemen in aiding the tampering, either by commission or omission. The criminal levels of corruption this suggests have not been reached in a day, and no one arm of the administration or state is responsible for it. No one can expect the rich and powerful to want a murder or a rape to disrupt their lives, they would naturally use all the resources they have to abort justice. The responsibility lies with the institutions and the individuals who work in them to make sure that justice is impartially and convincingly implemented, that murderers, rapists and abusers, whoever they are, do not roam free. And it is up to the nation, outraged today at the perceived injustice in the Jessica Lal case, to demand accountability every time ? whether the victim is killed in full view of roistering VIPs, or a poor servant girl set on fire with acid and flames in the privacy of her employer?s bathroom.

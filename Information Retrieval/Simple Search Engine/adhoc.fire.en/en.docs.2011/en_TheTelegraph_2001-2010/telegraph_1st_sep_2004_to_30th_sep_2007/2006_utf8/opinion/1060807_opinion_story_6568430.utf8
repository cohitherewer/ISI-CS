 Blood money

 Sir No punishment seems harsh enough for Ajay Agarwal, one of the two doctors who agreed to amputate the limbs of poor people to make them beg (Axe on beggar doctor, July 31). But in a country such as ours, where doctors routinely commit heinous acts like aborting female foetuses, one wonders whether Agarwal and his associates will be brought to book for their offence at all. One hopes that their medical licences will be cancelled permanently so that the duo cannot cause any further harm to people and add to the malaise of the medical profession in India. The outgoing president of the Indian Medical Association, Sanjeev Malik, has described Agarwals action asbarbarous and has threatened to cancel the IMA memberships of the two doctors. However, only the medical council has the power to cancel the licence of an errant doctor. Therefore, Malik should impress upon the council that the intentions of these doctors are criminal, and get their licences revoked. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The question as to whether dishonest doctors should be punished or not is superfluous as the answer is quite obvious. Men like Ajay Agarwal should be given exemplary punishment with the help of speedy legal means. Agarwals may have been an open-and- shut case, but in every large city, including Calcutta, the medical profession has on many occasions exhibited petty commercial interests. The ethos of a noble profession is long dead and the practice of medicine has now been taken over by medicos who mean business. To cite an example, of the total number of pregnant women in urban areas, those who seek medical help from private practitioners attached to city nursing homes, have to undergo caesarean deliveries though in the overall count, there are more normal deliveries than caesarean ones. City women are therefore being charged for an unnecessary operation. To cite another example, a huge billboard on the Park Circus connector, erected by a private hospital, advertises a particular cardiac test and urges people to utilize the facility. This is unethical because the lay man has no idea about such tests; and if such tests are needed, his doctor ought to recommend it. And for a doctor to know that a certain facility is available in the city, there is no need for a gigantic billboard. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir There is nothing novel in the exposition of scams and scandals such as those involving orthopaedic surgeons and school admission officials. Such misdeeds have been committed since time immemorial. People have always been aware, tolerant and adjusting with regard to these outrages. Whether it is the tax departments, police, municipal corporation, and even schools, corruption is all pervasive and ordinary people have to resort to unfair means to get their job done. If one has to put an end to corruption, or even minimize it, the preventive measures undertaken have to percolate from the top to the bottom. Often, charges of corruption are brought against top politicians and businessmen. But one never sees an end to the investigation, nor any punishment being meted out to the guilty. This has made Indian citizens cynical and they seem to have grudgingly accepted the way things are. To change things around, one has to bring about a change of heart among politicians. No amount of policing will reduce corruption since the corrupt are always a step ahead of the law. Only when the corrupt at the top have been reformed can things improve.

 Yours faithfully,

 Give it a boost

 Sir S.L. Rao is right when he says that India should take adequate steps to meet its energy requirements (Energy at a price, July 31). Energy is crucial to power a countrys economic growth. Besides, a states foreign relations often depend upon its energy needs. In India, coal meets more than half of the countrys energy demands. The fact that India imports almost 70 per cent of its oil is harming its economy. With spiralling international oil prices, coal will be the safest bet for our energy requirements. But a rapid expansion in the extraction of coal needs huge capital and the participation of the corporate world. Unfortunately, the coal and the mining sectors have registered a meagre growth of late. This needs to be addressed if India is to have a secure future in energy.

 Sir S.L. Rao states that India is short on electricity because of the low levels of investment and poor generation of surplus funds within the sector. But Rao has overlooked the main reason behind this shortfall power-generation by the various electricity boards is far below the installed capacity of the generating plants. While the national average of power generation is around 50 per cent of the installed capacity, the WBSEB generates below 40 per cent of this mark. Blaming poor investment, therefore, would not do in this case.

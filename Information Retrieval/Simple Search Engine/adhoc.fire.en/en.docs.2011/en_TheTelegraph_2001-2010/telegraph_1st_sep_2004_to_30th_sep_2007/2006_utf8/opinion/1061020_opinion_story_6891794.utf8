 STEP OUT OF THE BOX 

Bona Fide

Malvika Singh

India will be celebrating the 60th anniversary of 

its independence on August 15, 2007. Much is being planned to mark the occasion 

but in a manner that is predictable and uninspired. Here is a point of time in 

history when India can step out of the box and initiate events and activities 

that will represent a new generations aspirations and commitments. It is a time 

when Indians can be drawn together at all levels caste, class and faith under 

an umbrella that is thoughtful and inclusive. We can, as a nation and people, 

make a statement that endures.

The Indian administrative service should be compelled 

to deliver dignity of life and living to citizens, who have been battered by corrupt 

practices and a draconian state machinery that has functioned for itself and not 

for the collective. For a start, there should be no discrimination based on caste 

and faith in any public space. A village well provides water for all, and it is 

the responsibility of the administration to ensure that. This one act will bring 

dignity back into the lives of the lesser privileged and the poor.

Municipalities must be tackled before all else in 

an effort to restore our habitats, to make them liveable. Drains need to be closed. 

A movement could be launched a shramdaan of a kind in public or private 

partnership to clean villages, towns and cities with the active involvement of 

all citizens. Every mohalla doing this will, very quickly, deliver a cleaner 

India.

Joint action

A successful campaign for a green India is imperative. 

Every panchayat should, in this 60th year, earmark one acre of community 

land as a sacred grove a sacrosanct space where trees of indigenous and local 

species are planted and nurtured by the children of the village. This will create 

pools of solace for all on the outskirts of each and every habitation in India. 

These mini-vatikas could be the modern symbols of equality and secularism. 

We do not need the outlay of huge sums of money for sticking statues across this 

landscape. With young children at the helm of creating and conserving these sacred 

groves, the future mindset will be stable and will protect India from the kind 

of greedy, mercenary environmental exploitation we are witnessing today. The panchayat 

must be held accountable for seeing that such ideas survive and grow. In a similar 

vein, village school kids should grow their own food in the compound of the school, 

and mothers of the kids should, in rotation, cook the free meal each day. This 

will bring parents into the school, indirectly, and make them have a proactive 

role in the lives of their children. Schools and teachers will become accountable 

to the parents.

Every state capital must celebrate its heritage by 

modernizing its museum and archives and herald, in 2007, the critical system of 

public or private partnership that will generate the funds to make museums places 

of worship. This is because they embody the strengths and ethos of this society 

and its diversity, its ability to absorb other cultures and traditions and, therefore, 

its intrinsic secular nature. These places are unkempt and neglected, put on the 

backburner by the babus as the job is not as lucrative as the one where 

policing brings revenue. If governments put culture and its institutions on the 

front-burner, allow private monies to enter the coffers of such institutions and 

restructure the framework of operation, India will rapidly restore its lost pride. 

That alone will help build the flagging confidence of a great and special civilization.

These simple ideas do not require huge allocation 

of resources. They include the citizen and they will force the babu to work in 

tandem with the citizen. These are not extraordinary things to do. It is what 

should have happened in the normal course. Here is another god-given opportunity 

to celebrate yet again.

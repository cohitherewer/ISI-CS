 AN OPEN AIR EXERCISE

 NEHA SAHAY

 ?I want to climb the mountain, but I have no company,? complained the 20-something shop girl. ?My friends are always too tired, or sleeping.? It was a cold December afternoon. The girl had feigned illness to take an off to meet a friend. Finding the latter game, she discarded her stilettos for flat rubber chappals, and the two were off. 

 In South China?s cities, mountain-climbing is somewhat like going for a walk. In fact, foreigners learning Chinese find the sentence ?let?s go mountain climbing together? occurring quite early in their ?Learn Chinese? books. Scandinavians jump at the prospect, but are disappointed to find steps carved into mountain sides all the way to the top. 

 For the Chinese that?s what makes this otherwise intimidating activity so popular. These are small steps, keeping in mind the small feet of the Chinese. Actually, these mountains are more like hills. They also have ledges to rest on the way to the top. There are convenient points en route where one can stop climbing and descend by another, equally beautiful route, to the other side of the mountain. 

 Any time of the day is good for mountain climbing. Some enthusiasts go at the crack of dawn. The shop girl, who started the climb with her friend at 4 pm, was pleasantly surprised to find that they were not the only ones there. Chinese and foreigners of all ages overtook them: ranging from a five-year-old to 60-plus grandmothers exchanging the day?s gossip as they climbed. The majority however, were youngsters, who didn?t rest even after they reached the top. They exercised other limbs before beginning their downward run. Many had come alone, and the shop girl resolved to do so the next time. However, muggings have been reported by foreigners, who probably venture into the mountain in the summer when the blazing sun keeps locals away. 

 Hills are alive

 Despite the rigorous nature of the exercise, few Chinese treat it as a picnic. The most the climbers carry is a bottle of orange juice. Those not exercising on the mountain top, prefer to explore the small pathways to enjoy a better view. 

 Mountain-climbing is also chosen as an after-dinner exercise; most Chinese dine at 6 pm, and mountain sides are lit up. Indeed, one autumn festival called the Double Ninth festival as it occurs on the ninth day of the ninth month of the Chinese Lunar calendar, requires you to climb a mountain at night and eat special cakes to honour your ancestors. Some cities have mountain-climbing races on that day. The Double Ninth festival is also the ?Old Men festival?. Old people are meant to improve their health by taking part in the activities on that day. But old Chinese climb mountains all through the year. On that night, midnight on the mountain top is something like Mumbai?s Chowpatty beach on the last day of the Ganesh festival. 

 Mountain-climbing is so ingrained in the Chinese that historic events are commemorated through mountains. The return of Macao to China on December 20, 1999, was commemorated by carving 1,999 steps on the side of the Banzhang mountain that rings Zhuhai, the coastal city adjoining Macao. From the top of the mountain, you can see the skyscrapers of Macao across the harbour. Sun Yat Sen, regarded as the father of modern China, has his mausoleum built on the slopes of the vast Zhongshan Mountain in the historic city of Nanjing. 

 Mountains form part of feng shui; and you?re considered lucky if your house is anywhere near a mountain. For poor Chinese, mountains are a free source of drinking water. Many carry 15-litre containers up and down on small trolleys everyday. However, as mountain sides are carved up to build tunnels, highrises and rock gardens, this perennial source of water is also drying up.

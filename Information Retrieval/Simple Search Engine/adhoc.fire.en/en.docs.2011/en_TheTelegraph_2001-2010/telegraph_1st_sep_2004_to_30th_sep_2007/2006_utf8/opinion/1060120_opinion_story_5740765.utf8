 Letters to Editor

 Trip abroad

 Sir ? Being part of a premier set of management institutions in the world, the Indian Institutes of Management can serve aspiring management professionals the world over if allowed to set up shop overseas. In an era of globalization, there is no point in restricting quality education within the nation?s boundaries. So if infrastructure and other requirements permit, there should not be any restriction on IIM Bangalore setting up a campus in Singapore (?No passport for IIM Bangalore?, Jan 12). With increased foreign exposure the IIMs back home can look forward to upgrading their own knowledge systems.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recent furore over opening branches of the IIM abroad is surprising. While the human resource development ministry has straightaway denied permission to the IIM to go global, it hasn?t given a straight answer to why the institute is being forbidden to venture out of the country. The IIMs are our national pride, producing the best management brains in the country. It has to be kept in mind that the institutes are still out of the reach of most middle class students. But the government is as responsible for this as the IIMs. Instead of thwarting the IIMs? future moves, let the ministry formulate concrete policies in consultation with them so that the IIMs become more accessible. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sushanta Narayan Biswas, Shillong 

 Sir ? IIM Bangalore?s foreign venture is undoubtedly an effort to free itself of government control, which, despite the change of dispensation at the Centre, does not seem to have slackened. Arjun Singh?s strictures are proof of this. A branch abroad will earn more revenue for the institute in Bangalore and may even enable it to refuse government funding, and thus political interference. The HRD ministry is thus making an all-out effort to stall the move. Despite claims that the ministry is likely to review its decision after a change in the memorandum of association, a go-ahead is unlikely to come soon. The memorandum of association will be difficult to change, and a board that has a substantial government presence in it will not make things easy. What is most intriguing, however, is Mukesh Ambani?s support for the government policy on the matter. Is this a sign of his concern for the Indian student community or an attempt to get close to the politicians who decide their fate?

 Yours faithfully,

J. Acharya, Calcutta

 Sir ? The United Progressive Alliance government?s firm no to IIM Bangalore?s request is disappointing. The argument that business schools must first meet domestic demands is unacceptable. Setting up an IIM overseas will in no way hamper the education process within the country. Institutes such as the IIMs are supposed to foster a global mindset in their students. But in reality, they cannot even branch out to a small country like Singapore. Does liberalization mean different things to different ministries? 

 However, one must also remember that brand IIM is already global, thanks to the alumni who are making a mark in all spheres of management. There is no need for a physical campus to be set up outside India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Get it straight

 Sir ? I am surprised to note the information provided in the report, ?Citu drives out ?skilled? workers? (Jan 11). Please note that the undersigned never met any of The Telegraph?s representatives nor has made any statements in connection with the above. We have, in the meantime, received a written statement in Bengali addressed to The Telegraph from Mr Nitya Hari Dutta, general secretary, Graphite India Ltd Mazdoor Union (Citu), which attests to the fact that the news has been fabricated.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Banerjee, senior manager, personnel, Graphite India Limited, Durgapur

 Our correspondent replies:

 We stand by our report. The Telegraph?s correspondent spoke to P.K. Banerjee at length over the telephone in the presence of a senior government official whose name is not being mentioned as it is not germane to the context of this reply. Nowhere in his letter has Mr Banerjee contradicted our report. As for the letter purportedly written by the general secretary of the Citu-affiliated union at Graphite India Ltd in Durgapur, significantly sent via Mr Banerjee, and without its appropriate letterhead, it does not contradict the report.

 Parting shot

 Sir ? A news clipping on the BBC website said that the Ford truck that was used for carrying Mahatma Gandhi?s ashes to the Ganges is being ?made roadworthy? and spruced up to be used on February 12 in a re-enactment of the procession. Do our politicians have any idea about improving the lot of the toiling millions in our country or are they in office only to stage dramas of this kind, rename cities and streets and remove statues of historical figures just because their ideologies differed? I think it is time we thought about the option to recall our representatives as is available in many countries.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ashim Choudhury, Calcutta

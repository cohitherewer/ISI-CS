 THE BUSINESS OF PLEASURE

 A new law seeks to decriminalize sex work, but Sumit Mitra wonders if India is ready to accept prostitution as yet another vocation

 Out of the shadows

 When the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Amendment bill becomes a law, hopefully in this session of the parliament, it should cheer not only Calcuttans but also metro-dwellers across the country. The bill seeks to amend the principal Act of 1956, making, for the first time, a brothel customer liable to severe punishment. The jail term may be of three months but can go up to six months for a repeat offence with a fine of Rs 50,000. It should sound the much-awaited death knell for the civic nuisance that is Calcuttas Sonagachi or Mumbais Kamathipura.

 As the law comes into force, only the die-hard adventure seeker would dare step into the bordellos. These bazaars of cheap, commercial sex managed to survive all these years because society, while adjusting itself to increasing doses of sexual freedom, gave itself the woolly idea that brothels were an extension of the same freedom. This position overlooks the fact that there can be no freedom of any sort, least of all sexual, in a marketplace where the seller is not free. The woman who provides the service is in the grip of a landlord-local mafia-corrupt policeman nexus. She has most probably been trafficked from elsewhere and is ready to be trafficked further as if she were a fast-moving carnal good.

 There is room for ethical debate, though, on the permissible extent of sexual freedom, especially in the context of the recent murder of Tanya Banerjee, a Bangalore call-centre employee. Tanya reportedly took her calling a bit too literally. She had become a call girl, it is alleged, and had been arrested with a client in a south Calcutta flat while on a short visit from Bangalore. It appears that her jealous boyfriend killed her.

 But if Tanyas tragic destiny is a paradigm of freedom, life at brothels is a saga of exploitation. The new law will bring brothels under zero tolerance norms. For the offence of keeping or managing them, the maximum sentence has been raised from five years to seven. For trafficking, one can serve a life term and the burden of proof has been transferred to the accused, as in an anti-narcotics case. Trafficking of women has been equated with drug running. The new law also proposes a Central authority to prevent and combat human trafficking.

 Critics of the bill, ranging from feminist lawyers to NGOs which thrive on American funds to control the HIV epidemic, allege that it will push the sex market underground, thereby putting it beyond health and anti-trafficking regulations. There have been demonstrations in Delhi by residents of Sonagachi. To drive home the point that prostitutes can manage their own affairs perhaps with a little help from NGOs a bunch of survey reports have surfaced. They show that since the NGOs came on the scene, there has been a drastic drop in the incidents of HIV and trafficking. The surveys are about as credible as most of our pre-election opinion polls.

 A new line of attack on this strict piece of legislation is that it is inspired by the United States of America, where prostitution is banned other than in a handful of states, and policymakers are alarmed at the influx of women trafficked from poor countries. It is said that Americans are giving foreign aid in the social sector on the condition that there must be rigid anti-trafficking provisions in the aid-receiving country.

 The criticism notwithstanding, one of the most interesting features of the new law is that it decriminalizes prostitution. Section 8 of the existing law is deleted outright. This section had made punishable the act of seducing or soliciting for the purpose of prostitution ...whether by sitting by a window or on the balcony of a building or house or in any other way. Also removed is Section 20, which empowers a magistrate to remove a prostitute from her home.

 In other words, a woman should be free, in terms of law at least, to sell her body to whoever she pleases and at whatever price. As far as the customer is concerned, visiting a brothel is illegal but he (or, as evidence increasingly mounts, she) is free to take the service provider to a hotel or to a private residence.

 The new law may be bad news for the mushrooming massage parlours in Indias big cities which are brothels in another guise. The legal definition of a brothel in the current and the new bill alike is a place where two or more prostitutes are engaged in sex-based transactions. If the parlour-owner is convicted of running a brothel, he faces seven years in prison. He can escape only by providing one masseur at a time. This will not give him the economies of scale needed to make a deep penetration into the market.

 But a prostitute can always take an in-call or an out-call through an escort agency, which is the practice in most Western cities. And de-criminalizing prostitution may even lead to the return of the girlie bars, like Caesars Palace in Mumbai, which the police had closed down using Section 8 of the Act.

 True, these ended up becoming dens for criminals the owner of Caesars Palace was gunned down by the underworld but that was a policing problem. The state must find other ways to contain crime in places where women come to solicit without coercion. And consenting adults are free to check into a hotel, if they like, or any place which is not a brothel.

 Will the new law push the anti-AIDS and anti-trafficking campaign underground, as the critics allege? Hardly. The proponents of the argument do not acknowledge the vast changes in the contours of the man-woman relationship in recent times. Within the space of sexual freedom available even to the lowest strata of society, it is possible for a woman to live by selling her body without taking up residence in a designated red light area. For the World Health Organization-sponsored anti-AIDS campaign, which disproportionately targets high-risk groups among women only, the message will now require to be delivered more forcefully across classes, and genders.

 In the Regulation versus Abolition debate now sweeping through Europe, Germany has moved furthest to the left by re-legalizing brothels. But the improvement it reports on the trafficking situation is marginal at best. On the other hand, strong abolitionist measures taken by Frances hardline interior minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, in 2002, have had unexpected fallouts elsewhere. For example, a Spanish region known as Alt Emporda bordering France, has gained the reputation of being Europes brothel as it has turned its hotels and houses and even chapels into macro-brothels.

 The place is attracting customers even from France. But the mini-skirted desirees and Baby Dolls at the lounges are mostly women who have been trafficked from Romania, Nigeria or Colombia.

 Is India ready to accept prostitution as just another vocation? That brings us back to the sad story of Tanya. After being booked for participating in the flesh trade, she had reportedly told her interrogators that she had no qualms doing what she did. Guys enjoyed her company and she liked it, the interrogating officer later told the media.

 But it was quite beyond the tolerance level of her lover and colleague, Gururaj Kishore, to whom she had reportedly said, What you earn in a month at office, I earn in a single evening. He slashed her many times with a kitchen knife before dumping her body along a national highway.

 In 1967, Louis Buuel made the celebrated film, Belle de Jour, in which the beautiful Catherine Deneuve straddles two identities, the frigid wife of a middle class doctor at home, and, strictly in the afternoon, a whore in a brothel. Could her husband bear the shock if he knew it? Buuel left the question open. But the new law puts India, particularly its men, on the threshold of an answer.

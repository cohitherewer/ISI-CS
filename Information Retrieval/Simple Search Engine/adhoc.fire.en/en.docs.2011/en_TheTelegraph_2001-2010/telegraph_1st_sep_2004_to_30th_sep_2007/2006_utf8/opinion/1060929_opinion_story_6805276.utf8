The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BY THE BOOK

 The Pakistan president, Mr Pervez Musharraf, has consistently invited scepticism in India. Predictably, the publication of his memoir, In the Line of Fire, has intensified public disquiet in India about him. Ironically, the contents of the book should make it easier for New Delhi to shape its policies towards Pakistan. Political opinion in India has not found it easy to trust Mr Musharraf. He has been seen as virulently anti-India, willing to take rash and costly decisions, someone who would never compromise or make peace with India. The evidence provided for such a judgment on the Pakistan president is, at first glance, convincing. Mr Musharraf is a Muhajir from Delhi who saw the worst of Partition and probably continues to be haunted by the memories of 1947. Moreover, as a refugee, he has had to face deprivation even within Pakistan, which probably reinforced his bitterness. He is widely seen as the man responsible for the Kargil misadventure, which led to a diplomatic and military fiasco for Pakistan. The general carried out a coup against the prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif, and established himself as a military dictator. Like other dictators, he is clearly unwilling to transfer real power to a properly elected democratic authority. Indian intelligence agencies believe that Mr Musharraf is unwilling to rein in the jihadi groups that operate in Jammu and Kashmir, and have carried out attacks in other parts of India.

 All this, of course, is a textbook Indian reading of Mr Musharraf. A nuanced reading of his memoirs and past events will probably provide another narrative. In this view, Mr Musharraf is an opportunist, inspired not by historical memories or ideological doctrines, but by considerations of his own survival and success. The U-turn on Afghanistan, the willingness to be a satrap of the Americans in south Asia and the new flexibility on Kashmir seem to reveal that he holds nothing sacred. Thus, for New Delhi, he may be the easiest man to do business with in Pakistan as peace with India may help him strengthen his control domestically. Faced with crises in Baluchistan and Waziristan, and the alienation of liberals after the killing of Nawab Bugti, a modus vivendi with India may be Mr Musharrafs greatest need. It may be prudent for New Delhi to grasp opportunities offered by the general, rather than let controversies about the book queer the pitch.

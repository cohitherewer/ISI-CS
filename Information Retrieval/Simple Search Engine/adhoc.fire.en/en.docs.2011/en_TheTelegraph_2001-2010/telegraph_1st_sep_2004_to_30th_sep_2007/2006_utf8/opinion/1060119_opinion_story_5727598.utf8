 Guns blazing

 Sir ? ?CBI carries Bofors can? (Jan 17) amply shows how the Central Bureau of Investigation has served as a tool in the hands of the government, now that it has come forward to own up responsibility for the defreezing of Ottavio Quattrocchi?s London accounts. Despite the admission, however, it is difficult to understand the CBI?s modus operandi, which could not have worked without the instruction from the government. The CBI action is the last nail in its coffin. It shows how urgently the organization needs to be freed from government interference and placed under the president, like the comptroller and auditor general of India. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Bofors controversy is a god-send for the Bharatiya Janata Party. A divided house, the BJP gets to kill two birds (both the Congress president and the United Progressive Alliance government) at one go. But the BJP intends to use the controversy to maximum effect and ensure safe transaction of its political business, so finding evidence against Quattrocchi is hardly its chief concern. Remember how the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance tried to go slow on Quattrocchi?s extradition from Malaysia? Neither is the Congress interested in bringing the guilty to book. The CBI?s role in all this is most suspicious. Its delayed admission was only to save the Union law minister from embarrassment.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The Bofors scandal is living up to its image and Ottavio Quattrocchi has once again taken the Indian law enforcement agencies, the judiciary, the media and the political system for a ride. The nation can now stand and watch helplessly as taxpayers? money is siphoned off, right under its nose. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? Exposed for its brazen conspiracy to facilitate the defreezing of the bank accounts of Ottavio Quattrocchi, the Central government has laid the blame at the door of the CBI. The Centre could not have asked for a more willing scapegoat. The CBI, which only a couple of days ago, had publicly distanced itself from the attempt to bail out Quattrocchi, has done a volte-face. After briefing reporters that it had nothing to do with the additional solicitor-general?s visit to London, the CBI has tamely assumed full responsibility for the developments. In an unconvincing attempt to insulate the Congress and the Central government from the damage, the CBI has stated that ?neither the law ministry nor the department of personnel at training had any role to play? in lending Quattrocchi a helping hand. As if on cue, the Centre, through a statement by no less than the prime minister himself, has ?clarified? that the Quattrocchi affair was dealt with entirely by the investigative agency. This amounts to a crude obfuscation of the CBI?s longstanding differences with the government on how to handle Quattrocchi?s frozen funds and a direct political interference in its functioning. Quattrocchi remains an accused under the Indian justice system. Providing him assistance to unlock his bank accounts is tantamount to subverting the course of justice. From refusing to give the CBI clearance to appeal against the Delhi high court verdict of February 2004, to stretching a helping hand to Quattrocchi, the law ministry?s approach to the Bofors issue is a throwback to the cover-ups of the late Eighties and the early Nineties. In 1992, Madhavsinh Solanki was obliged to resign as the external affairs minister following reports that he had asked his Swiss counterpart to go slow on the question of handing over secret bank documents to India relating to the Bofors kickbacks. The charges against the Union law minister are no less serious. Shouldn?t he be made to resign, too?

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? It is quite incomprehensible why the BJP and the NDA are raising such a hue and cry over defreezing the bank accounts of Quattrocchi. They were in power for six years prior to 2004. What action did they take to bring Quattrocchi to justice during that period? No civilized government like that of the United Kingdom will keep bank accounts frozen without a valid reason. The NDA government should have practised during its tenure what it preaches today. It is also time someone told George Fernandes to use decent language when he speaks about the Congress president.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Bofors probe has taken so many U-turns over the years that the recent changes do not appear surprising. Instead of going into the politics of omissions and commissions, let us have our own set of guns to replace the Bofors. A country which can launch geostationary satellites into the orbit can also manufacture its own guns. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir ? In a country where millions of litigants are suffering from the huge backlog in the judiciary owing to time constraints and lack of manpower, why is the Bofors issue being thrust on the courts again? What is the use of flogging a dead horse? Arun Jaitley, obviously, does not have the answer, nor can he explain what he was doing about Bofors when he was the law minister. It is perhaps Sonia Gandhi?s turn to show some steel. She can start by calling the bluff and removing the law minister, and then come down heavily on saboteurs within the Congress. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

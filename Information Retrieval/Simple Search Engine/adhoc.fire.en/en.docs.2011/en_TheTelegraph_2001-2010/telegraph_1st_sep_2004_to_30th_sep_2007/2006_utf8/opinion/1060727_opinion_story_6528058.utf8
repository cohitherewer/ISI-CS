The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ANATOMY OF A MISSIVE

 RAJU MUKHERJI

 Would anyone who has seen Sourav Ganguly at St Xavier?s School, Calcutta, ever believe that the email came from the fingertips of a Xaverian? Sourav is as fluent in English as he is in his cover drives. It is inconceivable that he should make such mistakes. For him to say ?heavy punished? and to spell career as c-a-r-r-e-r is inconceivable. But if we do accept that he had instructed someone else to push the keys on the keyboard, the question that occurs is why did he have to wait for so many years to reveal the truth? Yes, there are people in the Cricket Association of Bengal who have held players? careers to ransom. What is heartening is that a player of Ganguly?s stature should finally agree that they should be punished.

 Why did Ganguly wait for so long to admit this reality? If he had said this 10 years back or even a few years ago when he still dominated Indian cricket, the words would have sounded credible; cricket-lovers would have complimented him for his courage. From someone in the wilderness, the words bear a hollow ring about them. The timing of the email has also not done him much help. If he had an axe to grind against Dalmiya and company, he should not have waited till he fell out of favour with the national selectors.

 Why now?

 Today even Ganguly?s diehard fans feel that he is being disloyal to a person who had helped him to find his feet in 1996. When the India team to England was selected, Dalmiya was secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and wielded enormous power and influence. How much Dalmiya was responsible for Ganguly?s selection in the 1996 tour cannot be proved for it is impossible to know what really transpired behind the scenes. But general impression remains that Ganguly?s inclusion in the team coincided with Dalmiya?s elevation to power in the BCCI. Moreover, wasn?t it Dalmiya who worked overtime to get the bans on Ganguly by Clive Lloyd and Chris Broad reduced? 

 An issue of concern is the content of the message, which referred to the leaking of Greg Chappell?s infamous email of last year, sent to the BCCI president, Ranbir Singh Mahendra. Dalmiya and the CAB were then nowhere in the picture. How can one claim that the email, which came neither to Dalmiya nor the CAB, was leaked by Dalmiya? The leak was a ?scoop?, and the journalist behind it deserves acclaim for it. 

 Bad timing

 Over the last few years many such scoops have happened in the media. Proceedings of closed-door selection meetings have been highlighted by the press. Behind-the-scene activities, especially dressing room gossip, have also found more than adequate media coverage. And yet, no one has blamed anyone for leaking information to the press. May we ask today, who were the people leaking out secret information and gossip to journalists over the years?

 Ganguly is intelligent, educated and has the courage of conviction. So far, he has not shown much inclination to get involved in backbiting. He has always walked with his head held high. He is pragmatic enough to realize that the content and timing of such an email would shatter his glorious public image. Why then should he make oblique reference to a man who has been his constant source of benefaction?

 The email attributed to Ganguly has disappointed his fans ? not so much for the content as for the timing. It is extremely difficult to visualize Ganguly sending that error-filled email. It is just not in tune with the man?s character and his education. If that email did originate from him, then along with his millions of fans I can only wish that he had more pragmatic advisors to guide him.

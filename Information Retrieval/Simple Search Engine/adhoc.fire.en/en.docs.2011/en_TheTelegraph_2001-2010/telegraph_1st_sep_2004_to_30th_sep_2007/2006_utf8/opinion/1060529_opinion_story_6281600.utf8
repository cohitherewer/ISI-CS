 VALUING SKILLS

 Heritage, like culture, is a tricky thing for governments to deal with. Preserving and conserving it must be founded on notions of intangible value, which are difficult to monitor or legislate, and depend on the proper use of special skills, resources and infrastructure. This is an expensive affair, yet must also be made part of the everyday lives of communities. Notionally, the Centre?s decision to allocate Rs 40 crore for the maintenance and upgrading of small museums and collections, especially the ones languishing in the mofussil areas, is laudable. West Bengal will directly benefit from this allocation. The state?s archaeological department has already identified around 27 monuments and eight museums or collections that would be given money to upgrade their resources and infrastructure. This would include renovation and repairs, curating and digital cataloguing, research, documentation and publication, conservation projects, building libraries and security. The special focus on provincial and rural collections is also significant.

 The sudden attention being paid to museums and ?special protection of historical assets? has a rather ignominious immediate context ? the theft of Rabindranath Tagore?s Nobel medal from Santiniketan, and similar disappearances at the Calcutta Museum. These were the result of pervasive callousness and systemic failures. It is doubtful whether a sudden influx of funds will make any fundamental difference to how these things are dealt with in West Bengal, or elsewhere in India. Reforming the situation is surely a matter of highly specialized education, the introduction of specific technology, the maintenance and development of infrastructure, and a change of attitude in ministers, bureaucrats, academics and ordinary people. Besides, those who plan and implement must also be taught how to deal with sudden influxes of funding. This is especially true of people looking after small collections in obscure towns, since they are likely to be interested amateurs without state-of-the-art professional training. Conservation and museology are still difficult to learn in India, and those who make important decisions regarding these matters ? mostly bureaucrats ? are often clueless about such things. The government must ensure that the use of this money is planned and monitored by people who know, or are trained in, the special skills required to value and preserve heritage.

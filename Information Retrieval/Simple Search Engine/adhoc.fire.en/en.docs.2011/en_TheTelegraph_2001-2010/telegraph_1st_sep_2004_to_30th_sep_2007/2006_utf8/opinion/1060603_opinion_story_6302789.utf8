 SHUTTLE QUEEN

 A lot of effort has gone into the 

 making of Saina Nehwal

 When little girls tied up their bows for birthday parties, there was one nine-year-old who knotted the laces of her sneakers. Saina Nehwal had started taking her badminton seriously at an early age for which she often willingly missed the parties and film shows that her friends flocked to. 

 It paid off. Seven years on, Saina has become the first Indian woman to win a four-star badminton event. The sixteen-year-old scaled up 33 rungs in womens world badminton rankings with her triumph in Manila on Sunday. Last week, she was 86th in the world, on Friday, she was 53rd. 

 The pre-university student of St Anns college at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad made national news when she upset German top seed and world number four Xu Huwaien in the last eight of the Philippines Open. On Sunday, she ensured a place for herself in the headlines when she defeated Malaysias Julia Wong then ranked 20 places above her in the final. 

 In India, where sporting successes make for a thin booklet of listings, Sainas victory is being given the same treatment that the other Hyderabad denizen, Sania Mirza, earned with her success with tennis three years ago. The media is gushing, the coach is happy and the family is ecstatic. 

 We had no doubts about her skills and stamina, says her father, Harivar Nehwal, a senior scientist at the Seed Research Institute of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. We thought in one years time she would edge out the top guns in the game. But she surprised us all by winning the Grand Prix in the first year itself, says the proud father. 

 Clearly, quite a lot of family sacrifice has gone into Sainas success. Harivar Nehwal, for instance, was promoted to head a major research and development unit in Delhi, but preferred to stay back in Hyderabad for the training that the city offered his daughter. 

 And Saina, too, had to often give a miss to the treats of childhood. She might have missed several movies or birthdays but not her practice sessions, says Sainas mother, Usha Rani. Discipline and a religiously-followed practice session gave Saina the much-needed edge in the game, the mother holds. 

 Thats not just a proud mother speaking, for Usha Rani herself played badminton for Haryana. That was where Saina was born as well. By the age of nine, she had started taking her badminton seriously. Once the family moved to Hyderabad, and Saina had joined the Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan School, it was evident that the young girl had both talent and drive. 

 I had noticed Sainas talent in sports, particularly in badminton, says C. Ramadevi, the principal of Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan. Our school organised special sports talent-hunt sessions to spot them young, she says. 

 Hyderabad worked out well for Saina. Earlier trained by badminton wizard S.M. Arif, Saina later joined an academy for badminton set up by top gun badminton player Pullela Gopi Chand, the All-England champion of 2001. Saina put up an incredible performance in Manila, says Gopi Chand. She was in tremendous form and improved her game at every match. 

 The academy honed Sainas talent but badminton lovers first spotted her in a series of matches in 2003. In June last year, she won a triple crown in the all-India junior ranking circuit, winning the junior singles, doubles and sub-junior singles titles in the Indian Oil Servo RSC tournament. She was so much better than her opponents that some of her matches barely lasted 15 minutes. 

 In July that year, she scored another hat-trick winning the under-16 and under-19 singles, and the under-19 doubles in another all-India junior-ranking badminton tournament. She won the Junior Czech Open a few years ago and represented India at the Commonwealth Youth Games at Bendigo, Australia. 

 That Sainas talent is not ordinary became evident when, as a 15-year-old junior national champion, she took on and defeated the reigning senior national champion Aparna Popat in the final of the Asian Satellite Badminton Championship in New Delhi. For long years, Aparna Popat was Sainas idol in October, she pulled the pedestal from under the feet of the eight-time national champion with her 11-8,11-6 victory. 

 Sensing a victor there, the Champions Trust of London-based steel baron Lakshmi Mittal promptly signed her on in an effort to make her an international champion. Not surprisingly, there is much jubiliation at Gopi Chands academy too. Saina has made us famous. A lot of media men are coming to our academy now, says a rapturous Vanaja, a trainee at the academy. 

 But, clearly, quite a lot of effort has gone into the making of Saina. Gopi Chand began a practice-cum-fitness session with her, involving the fitness diva of Hyderabad, Dinaz Merchant, in the exercise. They charted out a six-month long programme for Saina, who was not without her share of puppy fat. We had to work not just on reducing her fat, but also to improve her strength, right arm muscle power, speed and endurance, says Merchant, who runs some seven fitness outlets in the city. 

 The crash programme, Gopi Chand stresses, worked. But what separated Saina from other players, he holds, is her strong will. She works harder and harder till she gets the correct shots and drives, he says. 

 Her coaches have dreams for her, but Saina is doing her own planning as well. I want to win an Olympic gold, she said in an interview last year. And to most Indians used as they are to seeing sports idols blaze like comets and come crashing down like meteors that doesnt seem like tall talk any more.

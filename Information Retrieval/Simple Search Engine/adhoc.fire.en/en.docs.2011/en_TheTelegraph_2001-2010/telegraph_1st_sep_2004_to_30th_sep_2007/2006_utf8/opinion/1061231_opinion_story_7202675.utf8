 DIARY

 When Abdul Rahman Antulay got the brand-new portfolio of minority affairs, he had certainly expected the going to be good thenceforth. Who is to blame if the year has not ended on a high note for him? Did we hear the name of Arjun Singh? The HRD minister did make life difficult for Antulay, first by whipping up a confusion on the issue of minorities education, and now by trying to retain the secular status of Jamia Milia University (Antulay wants to make it a minority institution). Last heard, Arjun Singh was trying to fetch himself some bonus marks by trying to expedite the implementation of the Sachar committee recommendations. Perhaps disheartened, Antulay had turned to his country cousin, Shivraj Patil, on hearing of Sonia Gandhis Maharashtra visit. Obviously, Antulay wanted to accompany Madam to his home state. But he was told to go to Patil, who was coordinating the trip. But Patils office washed its hands of the matter, passing the buck to Madams office. Having had enough of moving from one desk to another, Antulay is supposed to have declared that he would have no more of such petty politics. Heres wishing the puzzled leader a happy new year.

 Manmohan Singh has been unhappy for some time now with the BJPs volte face on the Indo-US nuclear deal. For hadnt his government always kept the opposition leaders posted on the developments? Nor was it a secret that Brajesh Mishra, one of the initiaters of the deal during the NDA regime, was being consulted by Singh at every step. Atal Bihari Vajpayees birthday provided the perfect opportunity for the PM to set right the facts. He caught Mishra unawares at Vajpayees residence, and asked him point-blank if he was not keeping the former PM informed on the deal. Mishra could only mumble that he was, and Vajpayee too had to admit that he was not exactly in the dark.

 Has Uma Bharti taken a maun vrat? The sanyasin was recently in Bhopal for a few days, but she did not utter a single word against the ruling BJP, or the chief minister, Shivraj Singh Chauhan. Journalists looking for some juicy bites were left disappointed. Insiders state that the real reason for Bhartis silence is her disillusionment with her own Bhartiya Janshakti Party. Its coffers are apparently running dry, prompting state BJP leaders to speculate that Bharti is planning a return to the parent party. Till then, it seems that mums the word for the sadhvi.

 With the reshuffle in the Congress proving to be the classic elusive pimpernel, it looks like the BJP will beat the Congress at it. With the question, kaun banega pradhan mantri, being nudged around quite a bit by LK Advani recently, the question of the moment is, kaun banega general secretary. Om Mathur and Vinay Katiyar are almost certainly on their way out, and are likely to be replaced by men from the RSS. Among the new names likely to find place in Rajnath Singhs team, Arif Mohammed Khan and Varun Gandhi are the insiders favourite bets. With both Shahnawaz Khan and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi accommodated in the parliament, Arif Mohammed might just end up being the BJPs new Muslim face. Theres one problem though the latters record of switching loyalties. With Varun Gandhi, theres a different kind of problem. The young turk, with ample support from his animal-friendly mother, is reluctant to settle for anything less than general secretary or vice-president. But with no grey hairs and all his teeth intact, that is a tad difficult. The only certainty, therefore, is the deepening of the saffron shade once the list is out.

 Different men, different moods. Arun Jaitleys Christmas lunch was remarkably secular. Spotted around the sumptuous fare were the likes of Justice Sachar (of the minorities report fame), the Congresss Rajiv Shukla and Abhishek Singhvi, Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh and LK Advanis daughter, Pratibha. 

 Cut to the long-overdue lunch for mediamen hosted by the Maharashtra BJP spokesman, Prakash Javdekar. The journos should have known better, with this sworn RSS, Pune-Brahmin type. The food was so basic and bland that many decided to go without it. Those who were more hungry ordered for their dabbas.

 Snub of the week went to Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, from Madam. Reason: Priyada had been caught hobnobbing a bit too much with NDA allies Jayalalithaa in Chennai and Mamatadi in Calcutta.

 The defence minister, AK Antony, has finally agreed to shift house. Ironically enough, his new residence is the palatial building that once housed his archrival, K Karunakaran. The bungalow has most forms of creature comforts, including a huge swimming a pool that was installed by Karunakaran when he was the industry minister in the Narasimha Rao government. Apparently, when Rao faced a rebellion in the party over the demolition of the Babri Masjid, Karunakaran, ever the astute politician, used his bargaining power to get himself a hot-water swimming pool. The rulebook had to be altered a bit, but so what? Every afternoon, the tale goes, Karunakaran would apply loads of butter and take a dip, even as Rao sweated it out to save his chair. However, the pools days, if Kerala Congressmen are to be believed, are numbered. The defence minister is unlikely to splash about in this unauthorized structure, given his clean image and the fact that he is a stickler for rules.

 Letters to Editor

 Left in the lurch

 Sir The Centres extension of the ban on child labour to children in households and eateries is a long awaited and welcome legislation (Ban on child help at home, Aug 2). The previous ban had only included children employed in hazardous jobs, and so, thousands of children continued to be exploited in Indian homes, dhabas and shops. 

 Even the term hazardous jobs remains vague in its definition. The registered and unregistered tea gardens in Assam employ over 20,000 children in their factories and plantations. The legislation has had no impact here though the kind of work the children are made to do is definitely hazardous in nature. The attempts to ban child labour are problematized by the fact that not only do the employers prefer to employ children who can be made to work on relatively lower salaries but the parents also send their wards to work so that they can augment the family income. For the law to be effective, it is not enough to be a conscientious and responsible citizen and stop employing children. There must be a change in the mindset of parents, which in turn would depend on a change in their entire economic condition. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Stephen Ekka,

 Sir The many facets of the law banning child labour need to be assessed properly before one starts hailing the recent government move. Considering the economic condition of India, one wonders whether such a move will be more inhuman than beneficial for the children. Millions of children are forced to work to get themselves two square meals a day. What will happen to them if they are stopped from working? Have the government, the expert committee recommending the ban and the NGOs welcoming it done anything to improve things for these children? Besides, many youngsters working in roadside eateries are orphans. Deprived of their livelihood, they will inevitably turn to anti-social activities. As in the case of most laws passed in India, this law too will be abused, while the children continue to be exploited. The labour ministry obviously has not considered the ground realities before passing the legislation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The long battle of the NGOs against the employment of children in the unorganized sector has at last yielded result (Child law in place, NGOs want action Aug 3). But the prohibition cannot be of much help if the employers are not sensitized and the labour inspectors remain their usual callous selves with regard to the implementation of the law. But if enforced properly, the ban will give underprivileged children the opportunity of a having a normal childhood and the advantage of basic education besides creating more posts for adult employment. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Employing children up to the age of 18, instead of 14, should be considered child labour. The increased age limit will help reduce exploitation of human beings in general.

 Sir The Centre has widened the scope of the existing law on child labour by making the employment of children in hazardous sectors a punishable offence. But doubts still remain on whether this new legislation will meet with the same fate as the earlier Child Labour (Regulation and Prohibition) Act promulgated in 1986, which did not succeed in bringing a single offender to book. Unless the evils at the root of child labour are addressed by our political leaders, the eradication of this social problem might remain a dream. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The revised ban on child labour has come about largely because of the initiative taken by different NGOs, the chief among them being the Bachpan Bachao Andolan. But since the governments legislation is no more than a half-hearted attempt to deal with a problem midway without doing much about the causes and results of child labour, it is the task of the NGOs again to see that the children deprived of their jobs are properly rehabilitated. If this is not done with immediate effect, then the NGOs cannot be said to have succeeded in their efforts. They should take it up as a challenge to prove that they are more responsible than the government.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bad line

 Sir On July 28, 2006, I recharged my mobile phone (Airtel connection no. 9831335312), though the recharge date was July 30. I had received an SMS from Airtel that day, supposedly sent to select pre-paid customers, to the effect that I would get a local bonus talktime worth Rs 50 if I recharged it by that date on payment of Rs 200 or more. I paid Rs 330 to get a talktime of Rs 144.55 p on that day. The Airtel agent who recharged the account said that the extra credit would be available in 48 hours time. When this did not happen, I had to keep ringing Airtels customer service to find out the reason. Only after several complaints was I told on August 3 that the credit would be registered that night. To this date Airtel customer service has not kept its promise. I am sure there are many other Airtel customers who have been lured, and then harassed, in the same way. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Romabai De,

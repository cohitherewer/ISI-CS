 SLIPPERY SLOPE

 When Ms Sonia Gandhi sneezes, Mr Manmohan Singh and his cabinet do not catch a cold, they get pneumonia. The president of the Congress, who has nothing to do with the government, declared that fuel prices should be reduced, and the very next day the government announced that the price of petrol would be cut by Rs 2 per litre and that of diesel by Re 1 per litre. This is no way to govern. Governance is not about taking popular and convenient decisions. Nor is it about introducing measures that fetch votes. On the contrary, it is about introducing policies that one considers right and are consistent with a proclaimed ideological orientation. Policies cannot be haphazard, like a childs first attack on a meccano set. Policies must be underpinned by a commitment to a programme and an ideology. Mr Singhs government swings between economic reforms and populism in some kind of atavistic delight. One of the important pillars of economic reforms is the reduction of fiscal deficit. But the lowering of petrol and diesel prices is going to cost the exchequer a whopping Rs 3,000 crore. In other words, the government is back to the business of increasing the subsidy burden, something that goes completely against the spirit and the letter of economic reforms. Mr Singhs government is thus both reformist and populist, which is a polite way of saying that it has no character.

 When Ms Gandhi took over as the president of the Congress and then subsequently refused the prime ministership, it did seem that she would bring some fresh air into the Congress and its mode of thinking. She has belied such expectations, and has, in fact, taken the Congress back to the days of populism. She is mistaken if she thinks that this will get her electoral gains. In fact, the poor performance of the Congress-led government will adversely affect the partys electoral prospects. As Mr Singh was fond of saying at one time, bad economics is bad politics. But Ms Gan- dhi, perhaps unwittingly, has done something worse. By acting like a remote control prime minister, she has blurred the distinctions between the party and the government. This cannot augur well for the Indian democracy. Mr Singh, by forgetting governance and doing Ms Gandhis bidding, is doing serious harm to his reputation as a man of honour and vision. His critics say that Mr Singh is the weakest prime minister India has had. He should dispel, not fortify, that impression. The test of leadership is the answer to the question posed in Alice: who is the master?

 Man with a view

 Sir With the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, giving his assent to the office of profit bill, many members of parliament and the legislatures who were likely to face disqualification by the Election Commission of India, must have heaved a sigh of relief (Kalam signs bill, just in time, Aug 19). By signing the controversial bill, Kalam has only respected the Constitution. In fact, it is our politicians who have earned the displeasure of the whole nation for showing disrespect to the president, and forcing him to do what he did not want to do. The president had but only four options before him vis--vis the bill. First, he could refer the bill to the Supreme Court for its opinion under Article 143 of the Constitution an unlikely option since it would have required him to consult the Union cabinet again. Second, he could have kept the bill pending in his office till July next year when his presidential term expires something he would never have done as he does not sit on papers. Third, Kalam could give his assent to the bill as required under Article 111 of the Constitution which he actually did. 

 Finally, he could have resigned from his post which he did not, disappointing many politicians for sure. His resignation would have led to a constitutional crisis besides sending the message that the head of state and the head of government are in confrontation with each other. Obviously, the nation means more to the president than it does to our shameless politicians. However, a day before the president signed the bill, the government had announced that it would set up a joint parliamentary committee to examine the three proposals he had mooted. But by the time the JPC gives its report, Kalams tenure as president would, in all probability, have expired. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has proved to be a competent president by making the government respect his views on the office of profit bill and that too by avoiding any conflict with the government. There should be an altogether new approach on the issue. The JPC should seriously consider the proposition that no elected representative be allowed to hold any extra-parliamentary or non-governmental post. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The president has ultimately given his assent to the controversial office of profit bill although he had initially returned it to parliament for reconsideration. What is clear from the episode is that our president is as helpless as ordinary citizens. It also speaks volumes of the nature of the Indian democracy, which is ruled by a handful of people and their henchmen. The so-called representatives of the people respect neither the law nor the people.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Raj Bagri, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir The president must be congratulated for standing firm and forcing a halt to the headlong rush of the government and the parliament to pass the office of profit bill. The bill, hastily introduced to protect the incumbents of such offices, makes one believe that all politicians, irrespective of their ideology, come together when their power and perks are at stake. In such a situation, the firm stand taken by the president brought the government to its senses and avoided a most unseemly confrontation. The least that can be expected from the JPC now is a balanced and apolitical view. Hopefully, the committee members will see that run by non-political persons with the requisite expertise, many such institutions may be rescued from their present moribund state.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Shyamal K. Sinha,

 Stand firm

 Sir The dignified silence during the prime ministers speech in the Rajya Sabha on the Indo-US nuclear deal was probably because the house felt re-assured by what Manmohan Singh had to say (PM activates Left deterrent, Aug 18). However, nuclear energy is as important for Indias economic growth as for its strategic interests. It is in the interests of developed and developing nations to promote nuclear energy, since it will reduce dependence on oil and gas. The prime minister has clarified that India was ready to open its nuclear facilities to the International Atomic Energy Agency inspection only if all the restrictions on civilian nuclear supplies were lifted. In fact, Americans are afraid that uninterrupted civilian nuclear supplies will do more good than harm to India. Moreover, Indias disciplined nuclear track record is an established fact. It was its hostile neighbourhood that forced India to opt for nuclear weapons but only to the extent that was necessary for self-defence. If the Americans really want to worry about nuclear proliferation in south Asia, they should train their eyes on Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govind Das Dujari, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir The prime ministers address on the nuclear deal has proved the sceptics right. History is replete with instances of the United States of America trying to assert that it is more equal than the other signatories to a deal. India should have kept this in mind. Whatever diction the prime minster uses to assert Indias stand with regard to the US, it is clear that our foreign and nuclear policies require greater thought. After that, if India is left with no option but to walk out of the deal, then so be it. India does not need to get any certificate from the US.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Das, 

 Calcutta

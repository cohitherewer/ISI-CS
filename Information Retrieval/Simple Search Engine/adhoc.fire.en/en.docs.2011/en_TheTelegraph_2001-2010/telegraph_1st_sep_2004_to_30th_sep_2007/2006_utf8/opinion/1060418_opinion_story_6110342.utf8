The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RIGHT SUM

 At least some mathematics teachers get their calculations right. Heading the list in West Bengal is the teacher of mathematics from Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission College, who has been fighting a lone battle for months over the outrageous errors in a Class VI mathematics textbook published by the Board of Secondary Education, West Bengal. Repeatedly foiled in his quest, yet undefeated, Mr Parthasarathi Mukhopadhayay finally went to the chief minister?s house, hoping that something would be done if he could get his message across to Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. His sum turned out to be accurate: officials of the board have suddenly got cracking on efforts to make corrections, to provide excuses and do anything and everything to show the chief minister, irate mathematicians and a critical media that all of this prolonged display of callousness, ignorance, irresponsibility and inefficiency was always someone else?s fault.

 The saga needs to be recalled in brief to highlight the depths to which the work ethic has sunk in public institutions. The determined mathematics teacher had been writing ceaselessly to different officials of the board for the past eight months. The response was limited to the promise of a meeting with the writers and other experts, which never took place. It is noticeable, though, that the issue became one man?s campaign; there was no organized pressure from the schools that were using the books ? neither from the teachers nor the guardians. But in response to the outcry over the book in the media, an errata section was appended to the 2004 edition. It made things worse. There were more mistakes in the errata, while the corrections had not even touched upon certain basic errors in the text in the first place. This itself is an alarming comment on the levels of commitment, care and capability among experts given the responsibility of educating children in the state. They are significantly anonymous: no one need be accountable for slipshod work which in effect is seriously damaging, neither need people know who exactly has been given the precious job of work. Everyone loves and looks after everyone else as long as no one works. The scale of the failure of this work culture is best exhibited by the fact that the chief minister, prompted by a lone crusader, has had to intervene directly in order to get an organization to sit up.

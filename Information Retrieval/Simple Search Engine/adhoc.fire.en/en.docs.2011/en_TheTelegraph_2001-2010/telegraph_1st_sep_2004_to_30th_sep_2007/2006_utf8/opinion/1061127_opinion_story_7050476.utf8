 Burning questions

 Sir The fire mishap at the Topsia leather factory should serve as a warning not only to the government of West Bengal but also to numerous other illegal factories that have mushroomed in and around Calcutta (Locked in to be burnt to death, Nov 23). The authorities should probe into this matter urgently as in most cases the workers in these dingy and dismal factories are children. They work 15 to 18 hours every day with inflammable leather and adhesives, and there are little or no safety measures against calamities like the one that struck last week. Although West Bengal is gearing up to receive huge amounts of foreign direct investment, the government has spared little effort towards developing the infrastructure and working conditions of the indigenous factories. Thus, unplanned and unauthorized constructions with illegal electric wiring house several makeshift workshops and flourishing businesses. As a result, it becomes all the more difficult to rescue people from these tinderboxes in times of emergency. However, all this talk of illegal constructions and crude manufacturing units should not take attention away from the poor victims of the tragedy. The government should compensate for the precious lives lost. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir It is not surprising that illegal factories, eateries, grocery stores and show rooms have sprung up all over the city, including in posh residential areas. These thrive because one suspects that they enjoy the support of the municipal corporation and the local police. The chief minister must form an independent body to scrutinize all such establishments and seal the ones that are not legal, following the example of Delhi. Else, such accidents are bound to recur. Involving the corporation or the police is not a good idea since they may have vested interests. Also, those units which employ children should be dealt with strictly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir In West Bengal, an administrative inquiry is the most that can happen in the form of State action. The word illegal, used time and again in reports on the Topsia fire, drives home the point that illegal operations are the order of the day. So the question is, is there anything legal in the state anymore? Almost all laws are flouted with impunity, either by bribing officers or employing force. In the name of fighting for workers rights, trade union leaders too serve their selfish interests. This time, nine lives were lost in Topsia. Can the chief ministers inquiry give the relatives of the deceased any hope of redress? 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Many entrepreneurs, taking advantage of the recent economic boom and the growing unemployment in the country, are using poor children to rake in more and more profit. Bride-burning never discouraged people from marrying; similarly, the burning to death of nine people in Topsia would not stop the flow of bonded and underpaid labourers into the hellholes that have sprung up to cater to the global market. The profiteers would keep selling the idea that they are rescuing some people from poverty. What we need is not a soft heart for weeping, but hard laws to deal with unscrupulous businessmen. The death of labourers in Topsia is no less than commercial terrorism.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir In most of the small industries producing consumer goods across India, workers work under inhuman conditions, with meagre wages and no safety arrangements, just to get two square meals a day. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has ordered a probe into the illegal factories and buildings in and around Topsia. 

 But what is to be done to improve the working conditions of the labourers? The workers should be given a common platform, which would include entrepreneurs, who can suggest and implement measures to improve the conditions at the workplace and prevent accidents. Involving trade unions in this will only lead to the closure of the units, and the loss of jobs for the labourers. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Ghosal, Calcutta

 Sir The hard-hitting editorial, Fire within (Nov 24), highlights something we all feel strongly about. The leather industry engages the poorest of the poor...who sweat in cramped quarters without proper food, pay or safety... The wilful failure of the state machinery in tracking disputed property and illegal electric connections only goes to show up the corruption within the government. The only way the government can redeem itself is by addressing the root cause of the problem, that is, corruption. However, in the bid to get to the bottom of the problem, the dead should not be forgotten. Proper compensation, and safer employment opportunities, should be given to their families. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

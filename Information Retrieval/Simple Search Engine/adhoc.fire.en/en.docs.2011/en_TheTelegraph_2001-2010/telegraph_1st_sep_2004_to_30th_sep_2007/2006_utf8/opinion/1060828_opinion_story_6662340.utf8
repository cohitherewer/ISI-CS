 PANIC RETREAT

 The Essential Commodities Act is an emergency legislation passed in 1955 to deal with rising prices. It authorized the government to place limits on traders stocks of commodities that the government chose to declare essential. As time went by, the act became ever less effective. Trade worked out ways of bribing inspectors who came to verify stocks, and stocks came increasingly to be held by farmers, whom the government did not dare touch. The National Democratic Alliance government finally saw the incongruity of this act, and abandoned the powers in 2002. The United Progressive Alliance government has just reassumed these powers. The impression has grown that this government, headed by the initiator of liberalization in the Nineties, is not keen on further reforms. But this is virtually the first time it has reversed direction and gone back to its pre-1991 incarnation.

 The government is in a panic about inflation; but that is due to incorrect reading of the figures. It has been alarmed by the just released wholesale price index for August 12, which shows 4.92 per cent annual inflation, up from 3.67 per cent a year ago. An uneducated policymaker may take this as evidence of rising inflation. But it could also be the result of base effect inflation may look high because prices happened to be relatively low a year ago. There are a number of ways of avoiding this pitfall. A simple method is to take the average inflation over the past two years. Reckoned this way, inflation now is 4.4 per cent, down from 4.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2006. The rise in fuel prices, which has driven inflation in the past three years, has come down from 9.7 per cent at the beginning of July to 7.7 per cent now, the rise in the prices of manufactures from 3.7 to 3.3 per cent now. The rise in primary goods prices has admittedly crept up from 3 per cent in July to 3.4 per cent now. But the kharif harvest is just a month away; seeing the abundant rains this year, which still continues in western India, more confidence is justified than the government has shown. 

 It is particularly regrettable that the government has assumed arbitrary powers but does not adopt solutions that are before its eyes. If it wants to keep domestic prices down, it makes no sense to maintain absurdly high tariffs on foodgrains and to relax them only for its own corporations so that they can make easy profits on imported grains. The way to keep prices stable is to encourage people to hold more stocks, not less. Instead of giving a monopoly to its Food Corporation, the government should give cheap loans to private stockists who invest in silos that would protect grains from mice, vermin and pilferage on a large enough scale to ensure sufficient stocks in the economy.

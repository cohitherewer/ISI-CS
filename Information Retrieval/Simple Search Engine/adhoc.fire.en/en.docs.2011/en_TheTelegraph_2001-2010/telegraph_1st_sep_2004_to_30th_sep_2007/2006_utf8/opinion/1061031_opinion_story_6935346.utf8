 WHAT IMPEDES GROWTH

 Malvika Singh

 And, yet again, we have thrown the possible victory at Mohali to the winds. It is predictable and unfortunate that we have no real professional discipline in the field of sports. We do not have the killer instinct that is so vital for being an ace. We seem to win by default and not for accomplished play. This lack of excellence in most endeavours makes one wonder what went wrong with the Indian psyche, for there was a time when we had inherent skills that took the world by storm. Today, there is not one game or sport in which we can say that India is on top. Polo, golf, tennis, cricket, football, sprinting and swimming have not been able to produce an international star because before players have mastered the game they become salespersons for some product or the other. Is it faulty training and bad work ethics?

 The rigours of training come with adequate and uninterrupted sponsorship that must demand excellence and enforce dedicated work. The brand ambassador concept should not be permitted till the players reach the age of Amitabh Bachhan! Without this strict regimen, India will never produce a great player nor achieve international fame. 

 Having to host the Asian Games should compel us to go through a radical change in attitude. The ministry of sports and youth affairs must be given the status of a critical department, considering the average age of Indias citizens. Sports must be deemed a profession and not a hobby. Parents must also recognize the merit of professional sports and encourage their children (who have potential) to dedicate themselves to sports rather than compel them to go for irrelevant university degrees.

 Lathi-charge

 Since the majority of Indians are young, this is the time to change the mindset of the government, other institutions and parents. New specializations should be encouraged, degree status be given to the diplomas of today, and those disinterested in academics should not be forced into universities. For all this to begin, parents would need hectic counselling because it is they who want the status quo for their own comfort. This has dulled the sense of challenge, the desire to break out of the existing models and look beyond, towards exciting, unexplored horizons. Following such dreams with energy and hope makes for change and growth. 

 Sixty years after our liberation from colonial rule, we seem to have undermined the self-assurance and confidence we had when fighting for freedom. This has to be restored, the latent lively spirit of our people has to be activated. With old men and women at the helm of our political space, the movement of the nation has slowed down. We need the young to replace some of them, to energize the discussion and debate on policy and other issues, and to take on the risks that are needed to build a dynamic, contemporary social order. The baggage left by the British, adopted by the babus and stretched to absurd lengths, must be discarded rapidly to welcome the next phase of Indias growth, its entry into adulthood.

 India must cease to protect and nurture the minuscule few who people the administrative services and the houses of parliament. Laws should support civil society and enhance dignified living. They should not be used as a lathi to suppress talent and innovation. Today the rot is suffocating because aspiration is seen as an offence. It is, supposedly, not allowed by the state, by some strange interpretations of the endless addendas to the archaic, colonial law. For new ideas to be sown, to begin to bud and be nurtured, entrepreneurship must not be whipped, mutilated and destroyed. It must be hailed and celebrated with sane and immediate restructuring of regulations that prevent the natives from getting on with it.

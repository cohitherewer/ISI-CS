 LOST FOR WORDS

 The Kaavya Viswanathan fairy tale 

has taken a different turn ever 

since the American media accused her of plagiarism 

 A hot new plot is doing the rounds of literary circles. How Kaavya Viswanathan Got a Life is the tentative title. There are no takers yet, and, alas, no talk of a half-a-million-dollar contract. But there is a buzz.

 The plot is complex ? one of those open-ended, dark stories that leave the reader somewhat puzzled even after the last page. It, however, starts off on an optimistic note ? telling the tale of how US-based Kaavya Viswanathan changes her life. There she is one day, a mere student of Harvard University. And then there she is, richer by 500,000 dollars after she signs a deal with Little Brown amp; Company for a two-book contract.

 So far, so good. The story, after all, is based on real life ? mapping the eventful late teen years of the much-feted 19-year-old author of a book called How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life. And there are some who believe that the story of the authors own life, if ever penned, is going to cause quite a stir. Just like Opal... did when it was recently released.

 Its so hard to believe that Im going to be able to walk into a bookstore and see something that I wrote on display there, an excited Viswanathan had said in an interview when the news first broke about her mega-dollar deal, unprecedented in student circles.

 As it turns out, it may not be so hard after all. On Thursday, the publishers of her debut novel said they were going to withdraw the book from the market. But there was no official word on the withdrawal from Kaavya, whose Indian-born father Viswanathan Rajaraman is a neurosurgeon and mother Mary Sundaram, a gynaecologist.

 The problem erupted over the weekend. On Sunday, The Harvard Crimson, a student daily brought out by the University, pointed out in an article that Viswanathans book was startlingly similar to two novels written by Megan McCafferty. The parallels had been brought to McCaffertys notice by a reader.

 For instance, in her first novel, Sloppy Firsts, published in 2001, McCafferty writes: Sabrina was the brainy Angel. Yet another example of how every girl had to be one or the other: Pretty or smart.

 Viswanathan writes: Moneypenny was the brainy female character. Yet another example of how every girl had to be one or the other: smart or pretty. McCafferty writes in her second book, Second Helpings: ...but in a truly sadomasochistic dieting gesture, they chose to buy their Diet Cokes at Cinnabon. Viswanathan writes: In a truly masochistic gesture, they had decided to buy Diet Cokes from Mrs. Fields...

 The Kaavya Viswanathan story has moved on since the American media first accused her of plagiarism. The student has, over the last few days, expressed surprise and regret. In between, she admitted that she was such a fan of McCafferty, a former editor of Cosmopolitan magazine, that she must have internalised the senior authors language. I feel as confused as anyone about it.

 A few theories are being thrown around. One, Kaavya Viswanathan did some blatant cheating and hoped that nobody, least of all McCafferty, would notice. Two, she was, as she holds, so influenced by McCaffertys young-adult books that she used her language inadvertently. But there is a third argument that is gaining ground.

 People are talking about a growing trend in publishing of authors being approached by book packagers.

 Abook packager pens proposals for publishers ? with plots, characters and so on ? and then looks for an author. Alloy Enternationment, one such company, had been introduced to Viswanathan by agents William Morris. The New York Times news service points out that the relationship between packagers and publishers is so intertwined that one particular editor is thanked by both Viswanathan and McCafferty in their books.

 The real-life plot shows little signs of a denouement, but there is need for an epilogue in the book-that-could-have-been. 

 Viswanathan, the only child of her scientifically-inclined parents, had once said in an interview that everybody in her family won science prizes. I was the one with the writing gene, she had said.

 Viswanathan should have stuck to science. A life that revolves around simple equations such as E=mc2 would be so much easier than one beset by words.

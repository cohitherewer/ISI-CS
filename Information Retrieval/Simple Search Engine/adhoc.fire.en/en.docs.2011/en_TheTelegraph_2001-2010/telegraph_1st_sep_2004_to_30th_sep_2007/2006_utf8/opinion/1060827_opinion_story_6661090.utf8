 DIRECTORS SPECIAL

 In corporate affairs and in other areas, the need is for more, not less, professionalization. Such a need is belied by the appointment of celebrities and filmstars on the boards of companies. The elevation of Shah Rukh Khan as a director of Jet Airways is a case in point. Shah Rukh Khan is, undoubtedly, a successful actor, but this does not make him a successful manager and businessman. Hence the perfectly valid question: what contribution will he make to the running of an airline company? The answer, with due respect to Shah Rukh Khan, is none. He will bring star value to the company but add no real value to it. If the intention of Jet Airways was to associate the actor with the company in one way or another, that could have been done in various other ways. For example, he could have been made the brand manager of the airline. There is nothing that Shah Rukh Khan can bring to the boardroom table. He should not be blamed for this. He is trained to be an actor. Being a professional manager or an entrepreneur is not part of his expertise. In fact, his appointment might reduce the credibility of the management of Jet Airways.

 Filmstars in India are immensely popular. Some of them, like Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan, have a mass following. But this is neither a necessary nor a sufficient qualification for them to become experts on corporate affairs. It is thus difficult to comprehend why Jet Airways chose to appoint Shah Rukh Khan to its board. It will not be unfair to see this appointment as a sign of the cavalier fashion in which the board of directors is treated. The board of directors of a company is responsible for the overall running of it, all its strategic decisions, its profitability and so on. The board is not, and should not be, a mere ornamental body. The appointment of a filmstar to the board of a company reduces it to an ornamental body. It is thus indicative of the lack of penetration of the professional ethic.

 A similar lack is evident in other spheres of public life in India. Take the example of the presence of a large number of politicians on sports bodies. Mr Sharad Pawar has numerous qualifications and is an eminently successful politician but he has no claims to head the Board of Control for Cricket in India. He holds the top position on the strength of his ability to garner votes. This is different from a professional running BCCI. What is significant is that all the companies that have come to represent the new India are actually professionally run. One has only to think of Infosys or Wipro. Jet Airways, through its efficiency, has also come to represent the new India that aspires to equal and better global standards. To fulfil these challenging aspirations, it needs to draw on expertise relevant to running its business and its aircraft. This cannot come from the glitz of tinsel town.

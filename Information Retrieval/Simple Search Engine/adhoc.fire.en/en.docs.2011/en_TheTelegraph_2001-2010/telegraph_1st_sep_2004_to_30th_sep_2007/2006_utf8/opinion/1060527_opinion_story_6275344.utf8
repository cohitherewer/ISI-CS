 MAN FOR ALL SEASONS

 Aamir Khan has found a new role for himself ? that of a social activist

 Actors tend to reinvent themselves, but Aamir Khan, really, seems to be making a habit out of it. Just when you get accustomed to the image of a fresh-faced young boy in jeans and a T-shirt, he turns into a dhoti-and-singlet-clad man with short-cropped hair. And when you get used to that, he goes all hirsute, growing curly tresses and an equally wavy moustache. And then, once that sticks, the man is perversely back to wearing jeans and an intense look. 

 Clearly, the man likes to morph. Take a look at his advertisements. In any given ad, Amitabh Bachchan looks like Amitabh Bachchan, and Shah Rukh Khan, on most occasions, like Shah Rukh Khan. Aamir Khan, on the other hand, looks like a Bengali babu, a bhaiyya from the east, a lusty Sardar, a Nepalese guide, or a Japanese whos not Japanese after all. 

 And now, the 40-year actor has found a new role for himself ? that of a social activist. And, as he proved at a press conference in Mumbai on Thursday, its not a role that Khan is ready to give up ? at least not in the near future. 

 Aamir Khans recent utterings have kicked up a storm. His remarks in favour of rehabilitating people displaced by the Sardar Sarovar dam have irked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Gujarat. And, as a result of that, Khans latest and much-awaited film, Fanaa, was released everywhere but in Gujarat yesterday. 

 The BJP may be baying for his blood but Aamir Khan has also found his share of supporters. His friend, the writer Kiran Nagarkar, believes that Khan has the right to an opinion. And Tarun Tejpal is all praise for a man who speaks on potentially unpopular issues at the height of his career. Any celebrity who descends from his or her ivory tower to come forward and stand for a public cause is a person who must be lauded, says the Tehelka boss. 

 Tejpal knows what he is talking about, because it was his Tehelka Foundation, an organisation promoting social causes, that gave Aamir Khan a platform in support of Medha Patkars Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA). In early April, when Patkar and other NBA activists were on a hunger strike in New Delhi, the foundation invited Aamir Khan to join the protest. He was extremely responsive and agreed rightaway, says Tejpal. 

 Aamir Khans sudden interest in NBA came as a surprise to most, for, unlike some other actors who have been vocal about their political or social beliefs, Aamir Khans views have mostly been out of reach. But, according to Gauhar Raza, a member of Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), another voluntary organisation that Aamir Khan has recently been seen hobnobbing with, the actor has quietly been working with social groups for a while. 

 When ANHAD, for instance, got in touch with him to fund the education of children orphaned in the 2002 riots of Gujarat, Aamir Khan reacted with alacrity. He personally came forward to respond to an email that we had circulated, says Raza. 

 Earlier still, when Gujarat was crippled by an earthquake, Aamir Khan had stepped in with relief efforts. Last year, Khan led a team to play cricket with Kapil Devs XI for tsunami relief. Aamir is just great, exults Kunal Khemu, who was a child actor in the Aamir Khan-starrer Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke and is now a hero. 

 There was a time, not so long ago, when Aamir Khan was like Kunal Khemu. Khan, who started out as a child artist in the blockbuster Yaadon Ki Baraat, became a hit with the 1988 film Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak. He was then the quintessential teenager on the silver screen, the much-loved chocolate-boy hero. 

 Somewhere down the line, Khan grew up. He started doing all kinds of roles and producing himself ? as he did in 2002 with Lagaan ? in challenging parts. That was when his 16-year-old marriage with childhood sweetheart Reena unravelled, and Khan went on to wed Lagaan assistant director Kiran Rao. Suddenly, Khan was not the actor locked up in an ivory tower. He was right there on the ground, actually rubbing shoulders with, if not the hoi polloi, at least the middle Indian. 

 Some, like BJP actor Shatrughan Sinha, are not greatly enamoured of the new avatar. When you consider that he hasnt taken a stance on past incidents, like farmers suicides or even the oppression in Bihar, his recent move appears a little forced, says Sinha. He ought to have studied the pros and cons of the issue before opening up too many fronts with political parties, he holds. 

 Young Khemu, however, would have none of that. I personally dont think that if you are an actor, you cannot be an activist, he says. When Aamir took this stand, Im sure that he was sure, that he had decided. 

 Khan himself seems happy to have carved a social niche for himself. Those who believe in truth and courage will triumph, he said at the Mumbai press conference, quoting a line from a popular song in Lagaan. 

 Aamir Khan, clearly, is the flavour of the season. In an interview telecast on most TV channels on Thursday night, he asked his Fanaa co-star, Kajol, to list his strength. The fact that you are open to new things, she replied. In some circles, they would count that as his weakness.

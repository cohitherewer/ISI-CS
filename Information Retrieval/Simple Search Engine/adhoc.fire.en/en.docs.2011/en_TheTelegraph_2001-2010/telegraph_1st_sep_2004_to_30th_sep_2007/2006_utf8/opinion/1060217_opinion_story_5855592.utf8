The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BEFORE THE VOTE 

 Even ?foreigners? can be an election issue in India. In Assam, all elections have been dominated by controversies over the Bangladeshi aliens living there. The coming assembly polls are going to be no exception. That explains why the Centre has decided to amend the Foreigners Act of 1946, apparently in order to identify the illegal migrants living in Assam. On the face of it, New Delhi?s intention is unexceptionable. The amended act will ensure that anyone accused of being an alien can have a fair hearing in a tribunal examining the case. It is supposed to ensure that genuine Muslim citizens are not harassed on suspicion of being Bangladeshi migrants. So far, so good. But the context in which the Centre decided to amend the act makes it more a political move than a legal one. The Congress government in the state suffered a political setback when the Supreme Court struck down the Ilegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act last year. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Asom Gana Parishad have persistently demanded that the IMDT Act be scrapped as it had done little in the 20 years of its existence to tackle the issue. Their complaint has been borne out by facts.

 It is time the governments in New Delhi and Dispur accepted that illegal migration had been a major problem for Assam. Successive governments had only compounded it by refusing to face the reality. An unchecked influx across the border can drastically change Assam?s demography. Such a change, or even the fear of it, can cause massive political unrest. Assam?s history of communal and ethnic riots is a constant reminder of this danger. Also, large numbers of aliens living in a border state can have grave implications for the country?s security. But then, politicians anxious to make small electoral gains are unlikely to be bothered about the larger threats. In fact, the lure of political gains has prompted ruling parties in Assam and Bengal to gloss over the problem. Former chief minister of Assam, Hiteswar Saikia, who belonged to the Congress, wished away the problem for many years until he was forced to accept its magnitude in the early Nineties. Another former chief minister, Mr Jyoti Basu of Bengal, did much the same. But by the time they woke up to the problem, it had been too late. And they did little to solve it, obviously for the sake of Muslim votes. All politics may be local, but petty local politics can be dangerous too.

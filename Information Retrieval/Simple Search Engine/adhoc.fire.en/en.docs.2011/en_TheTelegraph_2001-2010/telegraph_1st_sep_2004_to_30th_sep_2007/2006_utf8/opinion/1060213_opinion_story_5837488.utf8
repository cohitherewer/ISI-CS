 ARMED GUILT

 The army?s task in the North-east is not an easy one. It has to fight the armed insurgents and, at the same time, ensure that innocent civilians are not harassed. The tragedy in Assam?s Tinsukia district shows how difficult the balancing act can prove to be for the army and the state administration. The death of a farmer allegedly in the army?s custody has sparked a wave of popular protests that led to the killing of nine others in police firing. The actual facts of the alleged custodial death and its tragic consequence may still be somewhat unclear. But the government has enough reasons to be worried. This is not the first time that the army has been accused of human rights abuses in the North-east. Similar complaints keep surfacing periodically from Manipur and Nagaland. It is not that the army is unaware of the risks to civilians in the course of its counter-insurgency operations. It would be unfair to deny the crucial importance of the army?s role in protecting the rule of law and in securing the lives of common people in the region. However, the army cannot afford to be seen as lenient to its errant men who are found to be guilty of violating human rights. Ms Sonia Gandhi has, therefore, done the right thing in asking the defence minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, to ensure that the ?guilty? armymen be punished. The chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, must follow the example by ordering an inquiry into the police firing.

 Tragic as the events were, they must not be seen as the end of the peace process in Assam. In fact, the biggest challenge that the events have thrown up to the peace-negotiators is to keep the dialogue alive. The people?s consultative group that the banned militant outfit, the United Liberation Front of Asom, has appointed to negotiate with New Delhi has to take the main initiative in this respect. It would be unfortunate if the group pulls out of the talks in response to the tragedy in Tinsukia. For the dialogue aims at a much larger goal and should not be the casualty of isolated incidents, however unhappy. Also, the group will not help the peace process if it uses the deaths to insist on the suspension of the counter-insurgency operations in Assam. It was realistic enough not to raise the issue during the recent talks with the Centre. In fact, both sides were anxious to avoid contentious issues in the larger interest of peace. The latest crisis has to be tackled in the same spirit of mutual understanding and accommodation.

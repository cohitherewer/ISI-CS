 Schools for scandal

 Sir If Schools take parents for a ride (Sept 14), then the latter are as much to blame as the schools which trick parents into believing that they give children swimming and horse-riding lessons. Why send unescorted three-year-olds for swimming and horse-riding lessons in the first place? This kind of racket thrives on the culture of ultra-busy parenthood, on-line admissions and ayahs looking after children. But since such money-sniffing playschools target only affluent parents, they should be made to run primary schools in villages, for children of parents living below the poverty line. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Warning signals

 Sir The death of 53 miners in Bhatdih mines in west Jharia has once again raised the question of the safety and security of miners. The Coal India management had never taken these accidents seriously and has always tried to take an easy way out. There is no denying that the equipment used by miners are old and dated, and most do not function properly. There is a gas test called methanometer test done by the miners before they enter a particular area. Had this been done, the accident may not have happened. Even the process of dousing, that is using sand when gas appears between coal seams during digging, was perhaps not carried out. Will the management do something or wait for another accident to happen?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Nirupam Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The subject of coal bed methane gas is important. The recent accident in a Dhanbad colliery was one of those mishaps which technology allows us to circumvent. The methane in the coal bed can be used to meet the energy demand. The extraction of the poisonous gas will also make mining safe. Unfortunately, this is not treated as an overriding priority. The committee of secretaries is yet to finalize such exploration bids. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission and other players are too slow to complete assignments. Companies have reportedly been penalized for the delay in exploration works that would have made mines safe. Perhaps, it is beyond their capacity and foreign players should be involved in the task.

 Yours faithfully, 

 C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Yet another mine disaster, loss of human life and the announcement of compensation. It is a never-ending tale. However, more and more miners are now asking why no measure is taken to save lives. Most of these miners were from Nagda village in Jharkhand, which is one of the most backward and poverty-stricken areas of the state. Officials seem to be unable to understand that no amount can compensate for the loss of lives.

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanta Das, Calcutta

 Sir The explosion in the Bhatdih mine which took away the lives of over 50 miners is similar to the one in which miners died because of inundation. At the New Kenda mine, about 54 miners died from fire. Certainly, these are not acts of god. Standards of safety in underground mines have been deteriorating steadily in nationalized coal mines. A more concerted effort needs to be made by government officials as well as by trade union leaders to prevent tragedies like these from occuring in future.

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Mitra, Durgapur

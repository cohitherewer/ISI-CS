 Wine, poetry and nautch girls

 The hall of a thousand columns 

 (John Murray, ? 3.50) by Tim Mackintosh-Smith 

 is about a fascinating journey undertaken by the author 

 in the footsteps of the legendary traveller, Ibn Battutah, 

 who had visited ?most of the known world between Morocco 

 and China? almost ?ten life times? before Mackintosh-Smith. 

 The Arab traveller had spent a good part of ten years in 

 India, and even ended up being appointed as an ambassador 

 by the eccentric Muhammad Shah Tughluq. Smith, who ?re-visits? 

 the country, seven hundred years after Battutah, discovers 

 a land that is both beautiful and macabre. Smith?s rendition 

 is rich in quirky anecdotes ? a dead Muslim posing as a 

 Hindu deity, a rotten tooth of a mad sultan with saintly 

 qualities, and a blind-folded yogi driving a car 

 on a national highway. Funny, insightful and irreverent 

 at times, Smith reminds us that India manages to exist both 

 in the past and the present at the same time.

 The Ranbaxy Story (Penguin, 

 Rs 295) by Bhupesh Bhandari is ostensibly a ?gripping? 

 account about how a sleeping pill set a stuttering pharmaceutical 

 company on the road to success. Ranbaxy?s founder, Bhai 

 Mohan Singh, had fallen into a charcoal stove as a child, 

 and bore the burn marks all his life. Singh?s tryst with 

 his company was not entirely painless either. He survived 

 the Partition, bitter boardroom battles, family feuds and 

 the challenge posed by big players to make Ranbaxy one of 

 the biggest names in the global market. Dour and boring, 

 the book would not even interest a confirmed hypochondriac. 

 The Open Frame Reader (Rupa, 

 Rs 250) edited by Rajiv Mehrotra is a collection 

 of essays that explore the myriad aspects of documentary 

 film-making. There is a lot of useful information on the 

 technological as well as the creative sides of film-making 

 ? cinematography, editing, sound recording, research and 

 so on. Mukul Kesavan, one of the contributors, makes a telling 

 remark when he says ?Nobody...goes to watch a documentary 

 film. Documentary films are brought to them?. One hopes 

 that the readers would prove Kesavan wrong after going through 

 these pages.

 Umrao Jan Ada (Orient, 

 Rs 175) by Mirza Muhammad Hadi Ruswa recounts 

 the tale of a gifted Lucknawi courtesan delivered in the 

 first person. Umrao was some sort of an enigma ? a complex 

 persona whose beauty and scholarly abilities remain a mystery 

 even today. Ruswa?s book captures this sense of the mystic, 

 and its evocation of life in old Lucknow, with its wealth, 

 decadence and debauchery, is delightful. Khushwant Singh 

 and M.A. Husaini have also done a wonderful job of translating 

 the verses from Urdu ? ?A clouded sky, a gentle breeze, 

 a garden and some wine/, but also let youth once more be 

 mine.?

 Wildlife holidays in India 

 (Outlook, Rs 295) is another interesting title 

 from the ?Outlook Traveller Getaway? series. This is a comprehensive 

 guidebook on wildlife tourist spots in India, and is a must 

 for those interested in visiting these enchanting places. 

 The book features sixty-four wildlife sanctuaries and national 

 parks of the country that have been arranged geographically. 

 Each park has been described in great detail, with a special 

 emphasis on its flora and fauna, accommodation, road networks 

 and other such trivia. At a time when India?s forests are 

 being ravaged by the timber mafia, poachers and meddling 

 tourists, this title, quite aptly, reminds us that ?once 

 you step into the wild, it?s best to leave behind nothing 

 but your footprints?.

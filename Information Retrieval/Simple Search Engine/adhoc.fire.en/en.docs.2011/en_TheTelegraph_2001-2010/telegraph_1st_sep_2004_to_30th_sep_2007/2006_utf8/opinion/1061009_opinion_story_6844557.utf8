 YET IT MOVES

 Advocates of economic reforms received a jolt last week from the announcement that the Union cabinet was resurrecting that tired populist slogan, garibi hatao. The return of populism suggested that the shutters were coming down on economic reforms. Such fears were grounded also on the continuing opposition of the left, a constituent of the United Progressive Alliance, to economic reforms, especially in the financial sector, and to privatization. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, however, removed such fears by announcing in Mumbai on Friday that the government would continue to push for reforms in the financial sector. The same government that is reviving populism is also committed to reforms in the financial sector. This bizarre situation might prompt the conclusion that the UPA government is suffering from severe schizophrenia. Or it could lead to the inference that Mr Singh and his cabinet are pulling in two contradictory directions. Neither scenario bodes well since they indicate that the government does not know its own mind or is mindless. Such an assessment is perhaps too harsh. There are a number of state elections in the offing, and the UPA, especially the Congress, would like to go into the fray with a popular slogan since it is now a common assumption among politicians that economic reforms do not bring votes. It is another matter of course that Congressmen could not think of a slogan except one that is well past its sell by date. To tired and old parties belong tired and old slogans.

 The prime minister, prisoner as he is of a coalition and of a political party, had no option save acquiescing in the cabinets decision. But where he could speak as Mr Singh, the pioneer of economic reforms in India, he reiterated his and his governments commitment to the reform process. One of the problems that Mr Singh has faced ever since he initiated economic reforms as a Congress finance minister in 1991-92 is the fact that his own enthusiasm for reforms is always hamstrung by his partys populist legacy. This often makes Mr Singh appear as a less keen reformer than he actually is. It also conveys the impression that he lacks authority. Mr Singh evidently believes in proceeding through consensus. This has made progress in reform slow, even faltering. But Mr Singh has not given up. He has tried to balance economic reforms with political compulsions. This has not done wonders to his image. But he has, one suspects, accepted his plight as a reformer fallen among politicians.

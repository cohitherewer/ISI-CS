 GRIN AND BEAR IT 

 Gwynne Dyer

 On July 1, the Russian rouble will become a fully convertible currency, traded under the same rules as dollars, euros, pounds and the yen. The date was obviously chosen by President Vladimir Putin to impress his guests at the G8 meeting in St Petersburg in mid-July with Russia?s economic progress, and there really has been quite a lot of progress on that front since he took over. But the Group of Sevenwas originally meant to be an annual gathering of the leaders of the biggest industrialized democracies.

 It would be stretching the term to say that the new member of the Group of Eight, as it became in 1996, is a democracy anymore. While sections of the Russian press still conduct raucous political debates, the all-important medium of television has been brought under state control, and more and more power has been concentrated in Putin?s hands. 

 It?s equally questionable whether Russia is really an industrialized power any more. The Russian economy resembles Nigeria?s or Iran?s more than those of its fellow G8 members: oil and gas account for 70 per cent of the country?s export earnings and 30 per cent of its entire economy. Even after six years of Putin?s rule, Russian oil production has not risen back up to the level of the early Nineties, and only the high price of oil worldwide gives Russia some prosperity at home and some clout abroad.

 Since the whole purpose of inviting Russia to join the G8 was to encourage the growth of democracy and a modern free-market economy in the ex-communist giant, Russia?s fellow G8 members are filled with consternation at the way things have turned out. How- ever, they are at a loss for how to deal with the cuckoo in their nest.

 For freedom?s sake

 The remarkable thing about Putin?s rule is that after six years in office, he continues to have the approval, according to reasonably reliable opinion polls. Though Putin has sworn to obey the constitutional ban on a third consecutive presidential term and leave power after the March 2008 election, there is massive popular support for changing the constitution to allow him to stay on for another four years.

 Not every Russian wants democracy. According to Leonid Sedov, a senior analyst at the VtsIOM-A polling agency, about 80 per cent of Russians say that they dislike democracy, although they are less clear on what they do like. Only three per cent want the return of the tsars, some 16 percent want a tough authoritarian ruler like Stalin, and the rest are scattered all over the political map. But they know they like Putin, because he has given them back stability, prosperity and self-respect.

 It?s a reaction to the chaotic process of de-communization under Boris Yeltsin, which was misleadingly called ?democratization,? and it doesn?t necessarily mean that Russians would dislike real democracy. Russians are still among the best-educated populations on the planet, and once the middle class feels prosperous and secure enough, the demand for democracy is likely to re-emerge. But that may be years away, and what are the democratic majority in the G8 to do with this authoritarian cuckoo in their nest in the meantime?

 Put up with it, and pretend not to notice that it doesn?t really fit in. Nag it about its human rights abuses, and demand that it give at least lip service to its democratic principles, but don?t drive the regime out into the cold. When the tide finally turns in Russian society, the survival of formal democratic structures and the rule of law in the country, however much abused in practice, will make the task of building a genuine democracy a lot easier.

 In effect, that is what the other seven members of the G8 have decided, and they are probably right. Of course, the fact that Russia has all that oil and gas to sell may have influenced their decision too.

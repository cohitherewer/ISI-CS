The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FOLLOW THE LEADERS

 Malvika Singh

 All those who have seen the role of the CPI(M) in New Delhi as having been regressive on the economic and the services sectors, those who found it virtually impossible to comprehend and rationalize the stand taken by hawks like Prakash Karat and suchlike in the party politburo, and those who found the stalling of change, growth and development unacceptable, are delighted with the resounding victory of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in West Bengal. It is a landslide in his favour.

 He is one of the most remarkable leaders in this country today. There is no arrogance in the man. He exudes quiet dignity. He is not dogmatic and dismissive of views that are contradictory to those of the elders in his party. He appears to have an open, intelligent and able mind, unlike some of his colleagues who are strident in their rhetoric with less to show in terms of governance. He stands apart in his party as a man who thinks out of the box, keeping all the basic tenets of egalitarianism, workers? rights et al as intrinsic to the change he is bringing to the hitherto unchanged policies of the CPI(M). He is a real politician and leader, clearly different from some of his armchair comrades. He is a man of conviction and of action. He seems to have pulled in the urban support as well as the backing of the new generation. He has shown that the left can step out of the time warp, compete in this new and changed environment, adjust and win.

 Two heroes

 Some left leaders, commenting on Bhattacharjee?s victory, sounded and looked rather peeved, maybe because the rigid, hardcore positions of the past will now have to change. The victory in Kerala, again, is thanks to a leader in his eighties, who had been dropped by the central politburo leaders and then hurriedly brought back when they realized that only he would be able to deliver the goods for them. This kind of fiddle-faddle comes when those on the high chair do not have any real experience of the grassroots. Often, this makes them strident as they attempt to cover up their many shortfalls with their dogmatic positions. In a sense, the two personalities ? V.S. Achuthanandan and Bhattacharjee ? seem to have taken over and led the victories in Kerala and West Bengal respectively.

 The Congress has done remarkably well too. In Tamil Nadu, it has made a dent that will force the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to let it participate in local politics. In Assam, the Congress continues to lead but do not have enough seats to form the government. And in Rae Bareli, Sonia Gandhi wins with a landslide margin, making all those who abuse her, her antecedents, her family, her children, appear foolish. Her election campaign was conducted in a ?non- Congress? manner. It had a different tenor, a fresh, no-nonsense approach, a young and energetic professionalism. 

 Shed old skin

 The usual sycophantic band of men and women was not to be seen. Rahul Gandhi was there, either on foot or driving to and from villages that comprise the constituency, working at building, restoring and establishing a very strong base for his mother and the Congress party in Rae Bareli. He and his team have won a resounding victory. Is this a symbol of what is on the anvil for the rest of the state? Will this methodology be replicated across Uttar Pradesh? Will the rebuilding of the base now begin? Will the old style of operations be replaced? Will the lethargy be swept away?

 Congressmen and women, particularly those who have in recent years played manipulative politics, been parasites, feeding on the party and its earlier goodwill, have been shaken and are suddenly feeling insecure and vulnerable. Hopefully, their days are numbered. Shed the old skin and give way to the new.

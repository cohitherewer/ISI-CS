The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNSHELTERED

 Poor children who come to live in shelter homes are among the most vulnerable of human beings. A Mumbai sessions court?s verdict against the men who have sexually abused and procured children under cover of an NGO could not have been clearer in its message to the world. The two convicted men are British, and the judge wants ?paedophiles around the world? to know that ?India should not be their destination in future?. He has also stressed the importance of the compensation given to the victims and their proper rehabilitation. This is certainly the best possible verdict, every element of which is unexceptionable. But worries remain, especially when the present and future of these children are seen in the larger context of children?s rights and juvenile justice in India today. 

 The abuse of children, by individuals or institutions and systems, can be of different kinds, some of it not ? or not overtly ? sexual. These children from the Mumbai shelter are presumably all without proper homes and families, and would therefore fall under the category of ?children in need of care and protection? under the current Juvenile Justice Act. But the infrastructure required for this ?care and protection? ? the child welfare boards, observation homes and various ways of restoring them to their families or rehabilitating them ? are, in most cases, inadequate and ill-managed to an extent that could also be deemed as inhuman, and therefore abusive. The Mumbai judge has emphasized compensation and rehabilitation. Who, one wonders, is going to manage the money these children will be given? And what does rehabilitation mean here ? restoration to their families or arranging for foster care or adoption? Each of these systems in India is fraught with problems, informed by institutional, bureaucratic and legal attitudes, which often end up being profoundly detrimental to the children?s well-being and rights. In the face of such systemic ills, it is tempting to see the abuse of children in purely sexual terms, and then to project that vision of evil onto foreign paedophiles. ?International sex tourism? is not the only form of harm that India?s most vulnerable children are victims of. There are dangers closer home that would require more pervasive social, legal and institutional changes than punishing and warning foreign criminals.

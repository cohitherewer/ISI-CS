The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Multiple identities

 Sir Once again, Subhas Chakraborty, is under media glare for exposing the basic tenets of communism to public criticism. It is surprising that the leftists are raising a storm over such a frivolous issue. What is wrong with a minister visiting the Kali temple and offering puja at Tarapeeth (Communist sermon to Hindu Subhas, Sept 17)? One cannot deny that religion, and not communist ethics, binds people together. If there were no religious fervour, violence would have been the order of the day. Besides, cultural or religious barriers have never restricted Chakrabortys natural gregariousness. Those who are casting aspersions on him must question their own conscience first. Holding on to residues of power is not typical of communist leaders either. Long after relinquishing the office of chief minister, Jyoti Basu is still in possession of Indira Bhawan. Officially, it should have gone to his successor, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. If the comrades are so worried about the secular character of communism getting tarnished by Chakrabortys practise of Hindu customs, then they must ensure that no party member follows any religious ritual. Muslim party leaders must refrain from observing Ramadan or offering namaz on Fridays. All party members should observe communism in letter and spirit, indiscriminately.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir It was rather shocking to read about Subhas Chakraborty offering puja (BJP hails Hindu Subhas, Sept 16). But is it really so important an issue as to get front page coverage? Would it not have made better sense to carry a story on the beggars found on the temple premises instead? Especially since the front page of The Telegraph is hardly a place for trivialities?

 Yours faithfully,

Soham Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir The West Bengal state transport minister has always spoken his mind, whatever the outcome. At least, he does not try anything on the sly. In these times of financial, political and religious conspiracies, Subhas Chakraborty remains a striking exception. Are Hindus alone responsible for preserving the secular character of communism? Why should party members of other religions be exempted from this stringent demand for atheism? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir Perhaps, Subhas Chakraborty did not realize that his visit to Tarapeeth would start off another controversy. However, the way the communist leaders have attacked him is unacceptable. In spite of ruling Bengal for decades, the communists have failed to bridge the sociological gap with the common people. By putting ideology above all else, they have also neglected the modernization of Bengal. It is their dislike for privatization that has denuded the state, industrially.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Subhas Chakrabortys visit to Tarapeeth is being blown out of proportion. By publicly identifying himself as a Hindu Brahmin, albeit belatedly, Chakraborty has not acted against the tenets of communism. Sitaram Yechury and Biman Bose may not like to call themselves Hindus, but they cannot impose this dictum on others. Secularists and neo-propagators of communism take part in various official ceremonies by lighting the lamp, which is traditionally a Hindu ritual. Nearly six decades after independence, we have not done away with this non-secular mode of inauguration. In West Bengal, local communist leaders have often occupied various positions in Durga Puja committees. It is not clear in which direction the communists intend to steer the country where religion and worship play a dominant role.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sambamurthy, Calcutta

 Sir Members of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are irritated with Subhas Chakraborty for his visits to temples. The former chief minister, Jyoti Basu, has said, Whom does he see and worship? Does She exist at all? It would be better if he worshipped mankind. Has Basu forgotten his own visit to a gurdwara, with a cloth tied to his head, after Indira Gandhis assasination?

 Yours faithfully, 

T.R. Anand, Calcutta 

 Sir Our communist leaders have an uncanny habit of getting embroiled in inanities in a bid to hit the headlines. And no one does it better than Subhas Chakraborty, who has a bizarre knack for drawing public attention. Why should the Alimuddin mandarins feel that following party diktats is more important than personal beliefs? India is a secular country and its people are free to observe their religious practices, despite their party colours. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Sinha, Berhampore

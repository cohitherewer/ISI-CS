The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STRIKE AGAIN

 There are conflicts in which a temporary setback is an advantage. This is perhaps the only consolation that the chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, can draw from the industrial strike which brought the state to a standstill on Thursday. That there is an ongoing conflict between Mr Bhattacharjee and the Centre of Indian Trade Unions is undeniable. An integral part of Mr Bhattacharjees policy and vision for a new West Bengal is a revival of work culture. This, in practical terms, means doing away with strikes and bandhs altogether. The Citu sees this as a direct threat to its turf and practices. Mr Bhattacharjee has been trying in various ways to rein in Citu and its irresponsible disruption of work in West Bengal through strikes, go-slows and so on. This process of reining in the Citu cannot be completed overnight. The Citu has a long history of disruption and it is unlikely to abandon this history without a protracted battle. Despite Thursdays bandh and despite the failure to keep the IT sector outside the purview of the bandh, it needs to be noted that the IT sector functioned. The Citu leadership also had to issue the guarantee that the bandh would not be enforced through intimidation and violence. What is more important is that the battlelines between the chief minister and the Citu are now more clearly drawn than ever before. The setbacks will only strengthen Mr Bhattacharjees resolve to tame the Citu and other recalcitrant elements within his party who threaten his overall vision and strategy.

 These considerations will, of course, be of little solace to the people of West Bengal who had to suffer another wasted day. On previous occasions when opposition parties had called bandhs, the Left Front government had taken steps to foil it. But the industrial strike on Thursday became a bandh because of the not-too tacit support that the state administration provided. Mr Bhattacharjee may have failed to bring in line the Citu, but a similar failure is also writ large so far as the administration and his own ministers are concerned. Mr Bhattacharjees minister for transport had the cheek to say that it is not his job to provide transport. Mr Bhattacharjee should tell the concerned minister that providing transport is precisely his job. Mr Bhattacharjee cannot afford to be seen taking the view that strikes by the opposition are bad and those called by his own party are good.

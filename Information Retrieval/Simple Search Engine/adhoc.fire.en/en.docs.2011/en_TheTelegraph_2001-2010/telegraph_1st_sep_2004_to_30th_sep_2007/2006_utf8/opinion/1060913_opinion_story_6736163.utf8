 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 An improved understanding of the physics of confined plasmas is leading to improved parameters for optimized operation of fusion power plants. Alternative magnetic confinement schemes such as spherical tokamaks and stellarators (devices used to confine hotplasma with magnetic fields to sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction) have also made significant progress in terms of achieved operational parameters. 

 Wendelstein-7X, the worlds largest stellara- tor under construction in Germany and planned to go into operation by 2010, will boost research on the topic of steady state operation for fusion power plants. 

 Progress in under- standing the physics in inertial fusion research has led to the design and fabrication of two megajoule laser facilities for fusion ignition experiments; the National Ignition Facility of the United States of America is being built at Livermore, and the Laser Megajoule facility near Bordeaux in France. They are expected to be ready for experiments in 20082010. A new approach to inertial fusion, called the fast ignition approach, is also under development, requiring the use of an ultraintense laser...

 A wide and comprehensive range of atomic and nuclear data is an essential pre-requisite for basic nuclear physics research and the successful planning, design and operation of nuclear power plants and associated reprocessing and waste handling facilities, as well as for applications such as nuclear medicine and specific nuclear-based analytical techniques. 

 Increasing interest in the use of accelerator driven systems (ADS) will lead to a higher demand for reliable nuclear data of high quality for both reactor physics/engineering purposes and radiation transport computations. 

 More reliable data have been generated to ensure improved confidence in fission and fusion assessments...Other advances in the compilation and evaluation of atomic and nuclear data continue, for example, to produce atomic and molecular data for plas- ma modelling and for heavy element impurities in fusion reactors. 

 The utilization of charged particle accelerators, in particular proton accelerators and electron accelerators, continues to provide significant developments in the fields of advanced materials, health care, and physical and life sciences...Interest is developing in non-standard material behaviour in the field of ion beam applications. For example, research is leading to improved know- ledge concerning the relationship between structure and properties of the next generation of insulating materials... 

 Radioisotope production, neutron beam appli- cations, silicon doping and material irradiation continue to be the main applications in many research reactor facilities... New research reactors are under construction, such as the OPAL Reactor in Australia, the China Advanced Research Reactor (CARR) in China and TRIGA-II in Morocco, or have been commissioned recently, such as FRM-II in Germany and the Mini- ature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) in Nige- ria. In Belgium, development of a new accelerator driven irradiation facility, MYRRHA, is at an advanced stage. MYRRHA is intended to serve as a European multipurpose research facility.

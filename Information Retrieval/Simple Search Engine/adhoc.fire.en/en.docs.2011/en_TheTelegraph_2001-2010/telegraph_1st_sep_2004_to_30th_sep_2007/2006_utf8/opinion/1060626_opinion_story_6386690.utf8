 Letters to Editor

 Forced to quit

 Sir ? One fails to understand why the Centre allowed the Calcutta police commissioner to contest the president?s post in the Cricket Association of Bengal (?Top cop on campaign?, June 21). Terrorists and ISI agents have become active in and around Calcutta, and this has made the job of the police chief more important. Apart from insurgency and terrorism, the Calcutta police have to deal with different kinds of crime, especially extortion racket. Worse, If Mukherjee manages to win the elections, he will have to devote more time to cricket than on matters of policing. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, should consider these factors and extend his support to a retired bureaucrat or an eminent citizen instead of backing Mukherjee. But if he persists with his choice, then he might as well start looking for a new top cop for Calcutta. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta

 Sir ? Prasun Mukherjee?s campaign to become the president of the CAB has all the makings of high drama. However, care should be taken to ensure that district magistrates are not coerced to vote for a particular contestant, as this would go against the principles of democracy. But it is heartening to note that the CAB has taken a sensible stand on this. In fact, Sourav Ganguly should take a leaf out of the CAB?s book and desist from switching sides just to earn his place back in the national cricket team. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Das,

 Sir ? It is true that in India the lure of cricket attracts politicians who try their best to take over the controls of various cricketing bodies. But Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee joining the bandwagon and making public his preference for the police commissioner, Prasun Mukherjee, is shocking to say the least. A chief minister is supposed to look after the welfare of the state and not decide who should preside over the state cricket board, which is, after all, an apolitical body. Nor should the police commissioner contend for the post of president of the CAB as his main duty is to maintain law and order in the city. Bhattacharjee must realize that some things work best when left out of the reach of politicians. Sports is definitely one of them.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Abhishek law,

 Sir ? It is sad to note that the chief minister is personally interfering in the selection of the CAB president. Worse still, his candidate is the present commissioner of police. Instead of fighting elections in sporting bodies, Mukherjee should busy himself in improving his own department, given the daily reports of police inaction and misbehaviour. Meanwhile, Bhattacharjee should relinquish his support for Mukherjee and nominate a former sportsperson like Sambaran Banerjee or Chuni Goswami to take over the CAB presidentship.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asim Kumar Bhattacharya, 

 Calcutta

 Sir ? The direct intervention of the West Bengal government in the affairs of the CAB is rather disappointing. One wonders why someone known to have wielded a baton instead of the willow is contesting for the post of CAB president. Jagmohan Dalmiya, in spite of the vilification campaign by some members of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, has been associated with Indian cricket for decades. He is very much an integral part of Bengal cricket as well. He has hardly taken a wrong step and has managed the affairs of the board quite well during his stint. Then why this sudden change of stance against a man who has done no wrong?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Debasish Chatterjee, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Not the best?, (June 22) puts the blame on Jagmohan Dalmiya for ?bringing politics and politicians...into the inner workings of cricket administration?. But Dalmiya cannot be blamed for this. In India, sports has always been associated with power and glamour. Even without Dalmiya at the helm, neither the CAB nor the BCCI would have been above petty politics. 

 Despite the allegations and court cases, it will be difficult to ignore the fact that it was during Dalmiya?s tenure that Indian cricket really blossomed. There was a marked improvement in quality and the Indian team went on to win many laurels on the field. Off it, it was Dalmiya who brought the BCCI unprecedented honours. Such was Dalmiya?s clout that he became a name to reckon with even in the International Cricket Council. One understands that the old order always has to make way for the new. But the on-going hate campaign against Dalmiya proves that it is difficult to bow out gracefully from positions of power in this part of the world. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 P.K. Bhattacharjee, 

 Calcutta

 Errata

 There was a printing error in the article by Rudrangshu Mukherjee (?Myth of empire?, June 25). June 20, 2006, marks the 250th anniversary of the Black Hole of Calcutta and not the 150th as was printed in the article. The error is regretted.

 BUILDING ON THE RUINS

Bona Fide -Malvika Singh

 The monsoon in Delhi has been weird to say the least. It rains every now and again but there has been no steady watering of this parched land, which needs to have its water table at a decent height for citizens to have an adequate supply of water. Unfortunately, the political and administrative bosses in India are clueless about the desperate need to keep certain parts of this Union Territory, let alone the rest of the country, untouched and untampered. Builders, in cahoots with the government, are relentless in their greed for grabbing land, even in catchment areas, to construct malls and multi-storeys. Land scams are the new enterprise and there is a vast amount of cash that changes hands. Everyone who makes it their business to know what is happening where and what the real deals are, know the truth well.

 The ridge in Delhi will soon be the victim of thoughtless and corrupt builders, politicians, administrators, planners and municipalities who have exploited urban and parts of rural India since independence. They have left for posterity the worst example of urban slums, of unacceptable conditions of living that citizens are forced to bear because the government has usurped their right to land and housing. With a new breed of builders entering the fray, the government agencies that lived on the extra income generated by such activity have made the rules such that they remain indispensible to the building boom. They are hanging on for dear life, and a rather dear income.

 Leaking roofs

 Political leaders know this and have done nothing to end the prevalent corruption. The housing problem has been one of the major failures of this democracy. Government-run urban development authorities have specialized in sub-standard construction, mastered bad taste and aesthetics in architectural design, and have acquired the skills to extract indecent rates for their faulty end products. Had the judiciary, particularly the lower courts, been a trifle more receptive to playing the role of a watchdog in civil society, Indians would not have to put up with this kind of corruption for decades. Every sector of the organized economy, even the service sector and the governing sector, have exploited the patience and goodwill of a tolerant nation. They are now beginning to pay a heavy price.

 The retaliation against years of humiliation and dictatorial assault on the citizenry by pliant, self-serving bureaucrats has reared its head. The government, instead of addressing the problem, invariably refers to these new realities as law-and-order problems, terming it as the rise of communal militancy. Perhaps, it will soon describe the unrest as a terrorist act. This is a classic example of a soft state, one that has buried its head in sinking sand. When the people take the law into their own hands, it is the start of the end of civility and dignified living.

 We are seeing this breakdown across the landscape from schools and colleges, to Vidhan Sabhas and the parliament. It is frightening primarily because the government and the political class are a part of this hooliganism. Civilized people would like to run away from this dreadful situation. 

 It is a great pity that the ruling class, the money makers, the land grabbers, and the administration are reaping rich harvests, within the secured walls of their fortresses, under the protection of guards because they know that what they are doing is wrong.In the process, they are inflicting a great insult on the nation. Guilt needs to be guarded till the puss squirts out and gangrene sets in. That is where we are at.

 Is it greed that stops wise politicians from speaking out at the cost of their jobs and chairs? How can leaders be so smug and callous?

 WHAT THE CHINESE THINK

 NEHA SAHAY

 India is the flavour of the month here actually of the week, because its already been overshadowed by Pakistan.

 Unfortunately, the English press here has carried bland accounts in officialese about President Hu Jintaos visit to India. No snippets, no sidelights. But thanks to Chinese TVs extensive coverage, ordinary Chinese are all abuzz with questions about the sari, Manmohan Singhs turban, L.K. Advanis bandgalla...

 The sari is glimpsed so rarely that it retains its exotic appeal. I wish our women would wear traditional outfits sometimes, sighed a 40-something manager in a multinational firm, looking at his wife, a school teacher, who thought nothing about wearing jeans even to formal dinners (there was obviously a serious communication gap there soon after, she left him). In fact, Chinese women do dress traditionally on occasion, their slim silhouettes flattered by the figure-hugging silk outfits, their flawless complexions set off by the rich colours. Otherwise, the sexy Qi Pao (the one-piece outfit slit at the side) is seen most often on leggy waitresses outside Chinese restaurants, and on Westerners bedazzled by it.

 On streets full of girls in jeans, slacks, shorts and skirts, the salwar-kameez also turns heads. So does the Lucknowi kurta-pyjama, which many Chinese recognize as the attire of the Indian PM who visited Beijing in 2003 (A.B. Vajpayee). However, what Chinese love most about Indian clothes are not just their colours and prints, but their comfort value: the softness and coolness of the cotton. Readymade Chinese cotton clothes have a synthetic feel about them.

 Letters to India

 The only light comment about President Hus trip came from a Chinese journalist who accompanied Hu: that both Chinese and Indian tourists talk so loudly in public that they create a nuisance. Interestingly, she also reported that the Chinese working and studying in India complained that the Indian press was very negative in its reportage about China, compared to the Chinese press positive reporting about India.

 Now thats a moot point. Disasters and poverty in India make news in China oftener than do the likes of Sania Mirza (included by the Chinese media in the list of the worlds 10 tennis beauties). A 19-year-old shop girl, who had studied only up to middle-school (similar to Std X here) in a village, when told that its common for middle-class Indian women to leave their jobs to look after their children, remarked: Okay, now I understand why people say that the status of women in India is very low.

 But even the bland photographs of Hu with Indian politicians prompted a rather enlightening exchange of letters in the press, on the relative prosperity of Chinese and Indian politicians. One reader observed that Chinese politicians were much better dressed, with expensive watches, pens, phones than their Indian counterparts. The latter, said the reader, must learn to likewise generate personal wealth in their careers by adjusting their attitudes... (towards) how laws should be treated, how the administration must dominate the courts and the legislature to get rules of the land the way it should be, and enforced the way it should be (sic.).

 He was promptly corrected by another who pointed out that Indian politicians invariably make HUGE (emphasis in the original) amounts of money through kickbacks...The amount of wealth they own is mind-boggling. For obvious reasons, they prefer not to advertise this ill-gotten wealth, and choose to dress up in traditional Indian clothing similar to what the poor people wear. Naming Manmohan Singh and Dr Abdul Kalam as the exceptions, the writer concluded: the next time you see a dirtily clothed Indian politician, be assured that you are looking at one of the richest guys in India. His only poverty lies in his character. Whew!

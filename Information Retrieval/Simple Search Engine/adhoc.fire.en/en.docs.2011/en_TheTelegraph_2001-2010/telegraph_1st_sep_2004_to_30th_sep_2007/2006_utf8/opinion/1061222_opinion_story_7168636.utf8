 Success story

 Sir Not even the most patriotic cricket fan would have imagined that India would outplay the Proteas on their home soil (India with attitude, Dec 19). It was a marvellous achievement for the Indian cricketers who have battled the odds and a massive defeat in the one-day internationals. India needs more aggressive players like S. Sreesanth, whose energy certainly has a positive effect on the others. Rahul Dravid was accurate with his field placements. The teams fielding was also superb. India, however, should not take its ability for granted. It has to plan ahead to keep this victory untarnished, especially since a backlash from South Africa is all too certain. The new team of selectors should be complimented for realizing the mistakes of their predecessor and bringing back Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman and Zaheer Khan. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Gokarn, Mumbai 

 Sir Indias win against South Africa in the Johannesburg test is one of the greatest achievements of Indian cricket. This victory tastes sweeter because of the battering India endured in the ODIs. Indias success was largely scripted by the five stars Ganguly, Laxman, Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan and Anil Kumble who were consistently left out of either the ODI or the test- squad by the selectors. A television channel rightly called them the paanch maharathis. The determined knock of 51 not out by Ganguly in the first innings, and his partnership with V.R.V. Singh, contributed the most to Indias first innings total of 249. This was followed by the accurate and aggressive bowling of Sreesanth and Khan, and, finally the clean up job by Kumble. Laxmans sparkling knock in the second innings ensured a handsome lead of over 400 runs. Gangulys body language, coupled with Sreeshanths aggression, brought about a sea change in Indias fielding. Lala Amarnaths saying, Catches win matches, was proven in this historic test match. Yet, amidst the celebrations, the Indian team management must decide on the right opening pair since the openers have largely failed the team so far. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir The thumping victory of India over South Africa in the first test at Johannesburg has come as a great relief to Indian cricket-lovers after a prolonged drought that resulted from the team managements experiments. In fact, Kiran More, Greg Chappell, Rahul Dravid and other key functionaries owe an explanation to the nation as to why they had kept Ganguly, Laxman, Kumble, Sreesanth and Zaheer Khan out of the team for the Champions Trophy while giving a long rope to a number of non-performers. While the first Indian test victory on South African soil will go a long way to restore some pride to Indian cricket, it will take a long time for cricket fans to regain their trust and confidence in the countrys cricket administrators. 

 Yours faithfully,

Vinayak Sharma, Guwahati

 Sir After Indias dismal performance in the ODIs, cricket fans in India and abroad had written off the team. Indias emphatic victory against South Africa in Johannesburg should now make critics of Ganguly and Chappell eat their words. The South Africans had prepared a bouncy green top, knowing full well Indian batsmens weaknesses. However, they also forgot that Indian pacers could bowl on bouncy pitches. In Sreesanth, India has a pacer who can rattle any side. Anil Kumble still has enough aggression left in him to confound any opposition. In Sachin Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman and Ganguly, India have a time-tested middle order. The teams only concern should be the opening pair. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Dasgupta, Burdwan

 Sir Indias 123-run victory in the Johannesburg is incredible. Sunil Gavaskar has rightly suggested that Rahul Dravid and his boys should aim to win the test series 3-0. Meanwhile, Greg Chappell-baiters should keep their mouth shut till the World Cup next year is over. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Guha, Calcutta

 Sir Two spinners have held the world of test cricket spellbound of late. The redoubtable Shane Warne and the warhorse Anil Kumble displayed their skills on the same day. Warne against perhaps the best all-rounder in the world, Andrew Flintoff; Kumble against the next best all-rounder, Shaun Pollock. Cricket fans will recall for long the two balls from their arsenal with which they clean-bowled these first-rate all-rounders. These deliveries were the handiwork of two tacticians who removed the obstacles to their teams victories. One might travel miles to see these absorbing battles but in tele-viewing, with action replays in slow motion, one does not come away a loser either.

 Yours faithfully,

R.C. Dey, Melbourne

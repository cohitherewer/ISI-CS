 EVERYBODY LOVES A GOOD CLICH?

 The odd man out

 Rhetorically speaking

 In every democracy, the essence of politics is discussion and debate. In our country, it is reduced to a clash of clich?s. One of the most frequently used and abused phrases in our political life must be the expression ?in the national interest?. Sometimes further refined as ?in the enlightened national interest? or ?in our essential national interest?, it is used as a clinching argument inside and outside parliament for a whole series of highly debatable policies. What does the national interest consist of and where is it to be found? Is it invariably in the custody of the government and the party in power? Is it some sacred text locked away in a dusty government almirah to be consulted when necessary? When a group of retired diplomats or a set of academicians from the Jawaharlal Nehru University appeal to the government to pursue, or refrain from, a particular course of action ?in our enlightened national interest?, does it imply that these groups are more acquainted with our ?national interest? than the prime minister and his advisers?

 In fact, this phrase means nothing at all. The national interest depends on the point of view of the observer. If the government is not functioning in what is considered to be the national interest, it should rightly be accused of treason. It has to be assumed that the executive branch is in fuller possession of all the relevant facts and factors than retired officials, academics or the members of parliament. If the phrase is to have any significance, it can only be used in connection with a majority vote in parliament as representing, however imperfectly, the people?s will. Accordingly, while the government enjoys majority support in parliament, it must be assumed that it is performing in the national interest. Though, of course, the parliament itself is not infallible. It has clearly neglected the national interest by failing to provide for an adequate representation for half our population ? the women ? for nearly six decades. India ranks among the lowest in the world league of democracies in this respect.

 Obviously, the national interest will not be immutable, but must change with the circumstances. Hence, looking back to a past when matters were thought to be much better ordered serves no purpose whatsoever. There is no point in invoking the age of Nehru, Indira Gandhi or Atal Bihari Vajpayee to chart today?s course of action. The media has reported that the new headquarters of the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi would be called the Jawaharlal Nehru Bhavan. This is unfortunate, since history in its usual merciless way will reveal that Nehru, despite his virtues, was guilty of many egregious blunders. It would have been better to name the new building after a theorist like Kautilya rather than a political practitioner.

 Critics and commentators, now invoking ?the national interest?, want the government to follow an ?independent policy? which they claim was practised in the past. Was India?s policy ever really independent of the then prevailing forces and factors? If it was, then Indian leaders of the time should have been taken severely to task for neglecting the national interest. Policy can never be made in a vacuum or on ideological grounds irrespective of the practical circumstances. If it is, it is doomed to fail. Globalization was always a factor in policy-making. The job of a statesman, whether in foreign or domestic policy, is to steer the best possible course between the obstacles and the opportunities, and with an eye on the future. Often, this becomes a navigation between a rock and a hard place, and the worst possible way to attempt this delicate manoeuvre is to pretend that obstacles and assets do not exist in the first place.

 Another meaningless, and much-repeated, phrase in our political life is ?in the best traditions? although there are no such ?best traditions? in evidence at present. It is believed that self-denial of position and privilege is associated with Indian tradition. When evidence of this occurs, it comes as such a surprise to the people that it is hailed to the skies. But after the applause has died down, it is usually found to be merely another example of opportunism ? a sacrifice today to reap a bigger profit tomorrow. Perhaps there were some ?best traditions? during the first and second Lok Sabhas, when the lawyer class, which then comprised a considerable proportion of members of parliament, had some knowledge of Erskine May and respect for what was considered appropriate in a representative democracy. Today, law-makers do not resign even if they incite assassins or even if there is proof that they are involved in bribery, drug-running and influence peddling. The traditions they have inherited and which, in turn, they will pass on to their successors are the worst rather than the best.

 The government has only to invoke the phrase ?the security of the country will never be sacrificed or compromised? to win thunderous applause. This banality is used as a definitive argument which cannot be contradicted. But what constitutes security? Security is an abstract concept which means different things to different people. There is physical security for the individual, for the community, for the state; food security, health security, employment security, social security, and security against terrorism. Are the dignitaries who bring traffic to a halt as they roar past in their motorcades full of armed operatives making themselves and the general public more or less secure? Is our concept of security based on numbers; more army divisions, more aircraft, more naval vessels? For a country which prides itself on its software skills, it seems paradoxical to postulate budget increases to justify ever more upgrades or acquisitions of defence systems. Is more less or is less more when it comes to security? We are never provided a coherent picture because the clich? will suffice for an unthinking endorsement.

 More examples of vacuous and contradictory expressions in common usage in our body politic are ?we are prepared to submit to the judgement of the people?, ?I am innocent of any wrong-doing. If I am found guilty I will quit politics?, ?we will support the government from outside?, and ?a cabinet position is not my priority. I am willing to serve my leader/ my party/ the nation in any capacity?. It seems that Gresham?s law rules the roost in the phrase-book of the political parties.

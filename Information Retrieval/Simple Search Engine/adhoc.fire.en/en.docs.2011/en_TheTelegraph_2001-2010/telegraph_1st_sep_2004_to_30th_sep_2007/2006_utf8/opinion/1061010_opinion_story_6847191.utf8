 SIGNS OF THE TIMES

Mala Fide -MALVIKA SINGH

 While some of us groan on about all that does not happen in India and the other daily horrors that afflict us because of gross malgovernance, the world has begun to look at this subcontinent differently. India is the buzzword abroad. It has, once again, become the magnet it was centuries ago when explorers and merchants sailed unfamiliar seas in search of wealth and trade. 

 It looks as though we have come full circle, through the many ups and downs. With the beginning of the decline of the single super power status of the United States of America, the social, economic and cultural assertions of India, China, the Middle East, the Far East and Europe have begun to take off as well. The great diversity of cultures and traditions, makes for a rich experience and triggers the imagination, leading to new intellectual and philosophical thought, fresh approaches, energetic music, painting, literature and more. This churning may well end up making the new millennium truly vibrant.

 In Europe, Bollywood has captured the imagination of the young, much like transcendental meditation had drawn a generation to India, looking for escape and salvation. A similar, but more active movement, is happening where the sense of abandon is more lively, with song and dance, without the shedding of social hang-ups that liberated my generation. Those who have the wherewithal are having their wedding extravaganzas in historic locations, recreating a fantasy world for themselves. 

 Caught in a bind

 Aspiration is what motivates the young, and India, as a venue for travel, leisure and business, has become appropriate. The seeming chaos, the human touch all of which the West had lost out as it marched into the realm of a different kind of materialism are what draw diverse people to this ancient land.

 Travel to Indian destinations is the new, big thing. Yet the pace of the change of attitude of those who regulate entrepreneurship in India is so faulty that we are missing out on the early days of this great exchange. As in Ireland, we should encourage the hospitality sector, compel it to grow rapidly, give it new freedoms and benefits. Alas, the government agencies that control leisure and entertainment, hotels and resorts, wild spaces, historical sites, museums and suchlike, are stuck in a strange time warp, which makes it impossible for others to enjoy and absorb our extraordinary heritage. They are able to make life hell for Indians in the larger hospitality trade, and for visitors as well. Their only success lies in their failure to deliver our civilization with style and grace to this new generation of world citizens.

 Shift gear

 India has become the hub of the IT industry and will soon lead in new technologies because it is the last bastion that nurtures human resource. UNESCO has recognized this and endorsed the truth, but the Indian government continues to live in the make-believe world of the last century. It is, once again, the bureaucracy, structured on colonial parameters left behind by the British Empire, which continues to exploit and rule India. 

 The British have adjusted, energized themselves and moved on. We, on the other hand, adhere rigidly and unthinkingly to systems alien to our culture. Our bureaucracy oppresses Indians in ways that are unacceptable. They attempt to control everything through a plethora of redundant regulations, censorship, bans, et al, signs of dictatorial regimes of the last century and bigoted regimes of today.

 Is it not time to shift gear radically and capture this moment for the future? Is it not time to engage actively with the world in all sectors of life and living, business and governance? We are poised for it.

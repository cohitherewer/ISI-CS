 THE PURIST 

 Pope Benedict XVI is cast in a different mould a steely one 

 Pope Benedict XVI dictates his own terms. He may not walk into a mosque in the name of peaceful co-existence or don a tilak on his intellectual forehead if he visits India, as his predecessor did. Benedict is cast in a different mould a steely one that clashes with anyone in his way. And he is not in the habit of backing off. 

 And that would explain why the Pope found it necessary to use the words of 14th century Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaeologus on Islam last week. The remark led to an unprecedented furore, forcing the Pope to voice a carefully-worded apology. 

 That came as a surprise to many, for the Pope is known to adamantly stick to his theological guns, aiming accurately at both dissenters within the Catholic world and questioners outside. Endowed with a sharp academic mind, he makes complex arguments via the long, meandering, arcane streets of canon law and philosophy but always arrives at the same truth His Truth. As the father of the worlds one billion Catholics, he is infallible. 

 B16 as he is known in Rome was born Joseph Alois Ratzinger in 1927 in rural Bavaria in Germany. As a boy he was a member of the Hitler Youth, a detail that still sparks deep suspicion among many. But today he is known as a purist, unforgiving of any deviation from the line. He had 18 years to set the line as the second most powerful Vatican official before rising to be the most powerful. Cardinal Ratzinger was chief of the Vaticans office of the Doctrine of Faith, a ministry charged with maintaining the orthodoxy of the church. 

 Under Ratzinger, the office slowly but surely quashed liberal strains within the church, intimidated, punished and excommunicated priests who dared to differ, blocked any movement towards allowing women to be ordained as priests and launched investigations against many erudite Catholic scholars simply because they differed from his hard line. He took the wind out of liberation theology, the activist strain in Latin America of siding with the poor. He even disciplined a Sri Lankan priest, Tissa Balasuriya, for trying to express his Catholicism through Eastern concepts. 

 In fact, Ratzingers long reign quashed all the optimism of the Second Vatican Council, the 1962-65 assembly of bishops that tried to open Catholicism to the world. There was talk of existing together, in love and harmony with other religions. Ratzinger had a completely different world view. He liked a dogmatic, strictly hierarchical church, undiluted by any eastern mumbo jumbo. The Catholic press, which follows these issues in great detail, has tracked Ratzingers rise, uncovering the many intrigues, rebellions and suppression of voices. 

 John Allen, a long-time commentator on the Vatican for the respected National Catholic Reporter wrote this in a long profile in April 1999: Whether necessary prophylaxis or a naked power play, his efforts to curb dissent have left the church more bruised, more divided, than at any point since the close of Vatican II. Those divisions have made Ratzinger a lightning rod. Indeed, it would be difficult to find a Catholic controversy in the past 20 years that did not somehow involve Joseph Ratzinger. Quite a summation but it gives a measure of the Popes mind. 

 In 2000, Ratzinger authored a highly controversial document known as Dominus Iesus, which defended the Churchs traditional teaching and proclaimed that only the Catholic Church can provide salvation. It was old line as old line could be. Hans Kung, a liberal theologian who has sparred with the Pope over the years and had his licence to teach revoked, called it offensive and arrogant because it considered Christianity an absolute and called other religions deficient. 

 As a matter of fact, you have deficiencies in all religions, but you have truth in all religions, said Kung, who represents the more inclusive strains in Catholicism. In a 1977 interview with French weekly LExpress, Ratzinger outraged many people when he characterised Hinduism as a religion of false hope that guaranteed salvation based on a morally cruel concept of reincarnation resembling a continuous circle of hell and Buddhism as autoerotic spirituality. 

 So Pope Benedicts recent clash with Islam is in character, you might say. To quote a Byzantine emperor as saying that Prophet Mohammad only brought evil and inhuman practices at a time when the Muslim world already feels demonised is to push the button. With his qualified apology he regretted the reaction around the world but not his choice of quotation came an offer for a frank and sincere dialogue. In Benedict speak, it means talking about Islamic terrorism and how it may find justification in selective reading of the Quran. 

 In his various public appearances and writings, the Pope has made it clear he wants reciprocity from Muslim countries. He wants Christians and other religious minorities to enjoy the same rights and religious freedom as Muslims do in the West. With that he has, in effect, put Saudi Arabia, a country that finances building of mosques with zest, and others on notice. It may be recalled that in May he sternly lectured the Indian ambassador on Indias lack of religious freedom and asked the government to reject anti-conversion bills. The language was unusually harsh and impolitic, the occasion inopportune. He has bluntly reminded ambassadors from east European countries of their Christian roots. 

 So why this zest? With falling birth rates and church attendance, Pope Benedict worries about the future of Christianity against a resurgent Islam. He has berated the West for its moral bankruptcy and written extensively about its obsession with secularism at the expense of faith. He says that Europes unity is based on its indispensable Christian roots. 

 Diplomacy doesnt seem to be his strong suit.

 DEAD, BUT NOT GONE

 Gwynne Dyer

 There is a lesson for us all in the sudden, violent death of terrorist leader, Musab al-Zarqawi, in Iraq. It is this ? never call a meeting.

 Osama bin Laden probably hasn?t called a single meeting since 9/11, so he?s still alive and kicking almost five years later. He sends out inspirational video or audio tapes from time to time, but he?s not actually running anything, because that would require him to be in touch with lots of people ? and if he were, he would be dead by now. They?d spot him using a satellite phone and drop a missile on him, like the Russians did to the Chechen rebel leader, Dzhokhar Dudayev, or somebody would just turn him in for the $25 million reward.

 Zarqawi had to hold meetings, however. He had to organize atrocities, coordinate logistics, talk on mobile phones, and thus expose himself to attack on a daily basis. So, eventually, he ran out of luck. He will not be missed, especially by the saner parts of the Iraqi resistance movement ? but he has probably already done the state of Iraq fatal damage.

 Zarqawi was a foreigner, and most of his fighters were foreigners too ? religious fanatics from all over the Arab world who cared no more about the lives of Iraqis than they did about their own lives. The more doctrinally pure among them believed that there should not even be an Iraqi state; like all Muslim countries, it should be absorbed into a single world-spanning Muslim state run according to strict Islamist principles.

 Violent ways

 It was the US invasion of Iraq that gave Zarqawi and his friends the chance to move in, but they never dominated the resistance movement. From the start, the great majority of the people fighting the American occupation were native Sunni Arabs. Some of them, mostly former Baathists, were nationalists who simply wanted the Americans out. Others were religiously motivated radicals, long repressed under Saddam Hussein, who also wanted to impose strict Islamic law on the country. But none of them wanted to abolish the country. Most of them did not even want a civil war.

 That was where Zarqawi?s influence was greatest, and worst. His gruesome enthusiasm for slowly beheading defenceless hostages and circulating the videos was bad enough. Indeed, although bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were eventually persuaded in 2004 to adopt ?al-Qaeda in Iraq,? as Zarqawi named his organization, they never had any control over him, and they worried that his obvious delight in cruelty would alienate people from the cause. But Zarqawi?s strategy of trying to trigger a civil war in Iraq by murdering Shia Arabs in large numbers was as infectious as it was effective.

 Like many religious fanatics, he hated people of his own religion whom he saw as heretics even more than he hated infidels, so he had no compunction about blowing Shia Arabs up in large numbers simply because they were Shia. He saw a Sunni-Shia civil war as the best way of destabilizing the government that the American occupation was trying to install in Baghdad, but also as the best way to ensuring the emergence of a permanent base for Islamist radicals in the Sunni Arab parts of Iraq, which would probably end up beyond Shia control even after an eventual American withdrawal.

 It was Zarqawi?s people who carried out all the early atrocities against Shias and they had the desired effect. Death squads from Shia militias began killing Sunnis in retaliation, the Sunni resistance started to fight back, and Iraq was trapped in the same spiral of violence that doomed Lebanon to 15 years of civil war.

 Zarqawi is dead, but he has achieved his purpose. Baghdad Central Mortuary is now receiving close to fifty mutilated bodies each day, almost all of them victims of sectarian killings. The situation in Iraq will probably get worse, but it is already past saving.

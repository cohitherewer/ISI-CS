The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOUD AND CLEAR

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Finally, Manmohan Singh has asserted himself and his position on the nuclear deal with America. He spoke in parliament and gave all the assurances that put to rest many of the reservations that various sections of decision-makers had about the arrangement. He spoke of his commitment to what he intends to do for India. He said that he was going to go ahead and he wanted the people to trust him and have faith. It worked. The prime minister is, once again, seen to be what he in fact is, and not merely as a head of government waiting for instructions! Hopefully, the rumours about him of not having a mind of his own and other similar accusations, have been put to rest, at least for the time being.

 If the prime minister were to act in this manner more often, it would take the wind out of the sails of many political dispensations which have played a detrimental role by stalling change and new initiatives. It is heartening to see fresh aggression. The constant buckling under superficial political and often bureaucratic pressure that we have witnessed over many months had made people less confident about the leadership at the Centre. Thankfully, that is beginning to change and will bode well for the Congress if it decides to go for an early election.

 Constituents are comfortable with strong-willed, confident and decisive leadership, but one that takes dissenting voices and views into account before formulating policy. They are uneasy with leaders who appear to be timid and confused as they bend with every growl from the opposition. That kind of soft stance is seen as opportunism to remain in power, and it proves ineptitude as far as governance is concerned. Such governments are thrown out at election time and, in the strange parlance of our times, this is described as an anti-incumbency vote. In his new avatar, Manmohan Singh may well surprise us by listening to the constant whine of the left and others as he gets on with the task at hand as he thinks it right, whatever the political consequences and subsequent fallout.

 In strong doses

 The time has come to deliver, and deliver for a new century motivated by new ideas of how to deal with and alleviate the horrors that have afflicted countries such as ours. Health, literacy, education, housing, food for all, equality and other basic human rights have to be addressed with dynamic methodologies and all the failed isms of the past have to be buried. A new generation must be absorbed in initiating and developing modern processes built on egalitarian grounds. Enough of seeing men on crutches devising education and management policies for millions of eager minds. It is laughable at one level and hugely sad at another.

 Will the Congress have the guts to call for a mid-term poll or are its members far too happy and content lording it over all that comes within their vision and reach, making sure that constant bickering and divisiveness keep the party in standstill mode, something that killed a great opportunity that came their way in the last election? Will it find excuses to maintain the destructive status quo and not look at the positive aspects of going to the people for a fuller and more substantial mandate? If they want to make an impact and change the course of Indias hitherto decline, they will have to activate themselves by pulling themselves out of the coma they are in.

 If they were to change tack and address India, not with promises but an appeal for a strong mandate that would allow for decision-making in all areas spelt out in their list of priorities, chances are that India would respond and participate in designing that much-needed change and move ahead. The tradition of manipulation endemic to the Congress would have to be put through severe doses of chemotherapy.

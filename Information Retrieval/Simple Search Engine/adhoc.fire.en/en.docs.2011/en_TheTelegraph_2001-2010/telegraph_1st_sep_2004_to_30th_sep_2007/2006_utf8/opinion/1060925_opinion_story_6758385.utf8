 PASSING THE BUCK AROUND

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 Releasing a cargo from the Calcutta Customs and Port Trust involves dealing with corruption in different forms

 Last week, a clearing agent (Mr A) called me to say that a cargo of books mostly I had shipped from the United Kingdom, had reached Calcutta. Without much preamble, he went about his business. I would have to pay around Rs 6,000, he declared brusquely, to release the goods from the ship itself, and a further Rs 2,000 as miscellaneous expenses for Customs clearance. Why on earth, I wondered, as I declined to pay. I had already paid a considerable sum for door to door delivery, which included every expense involved. Did this not sufficiently explain my refusal? Clearly, all explanations left him unimpressed. 

 A few days later, I had a call from Mr B, one of Mr As associates, trying out the same story. Since I would have to get my stuff out of the port in a weeks time, he added, Id better make up my mind quickly. His tone was intimidating, with a hint of a threat somewhere. It seemed I was somehow responsible for all this inconvenience, as if my responsibility did not end with paying for the shipping. 

 The following day, I went to see him in his office, which turned out to be a seedy little room in the third floor of a building on Fairlie Place. The place looked like a shrine to bureaucracy crumbling, monolithic, smelling of mouldy files, chewed paan spattered along the walls, and the occasional waft of piss. The office was located in a stifling little room, where an interminable haggling ensued. Sheaves of papers kept in battered files were thrust at me to sign. A veritable gang paan-chewing, tea-drinking, idle-gazing good-for-nothings kept insisting that the money be paid then and there, and in cash. Things were left unresolved for the moment.

 Mr B called later that day. In a voice reeking of false courtesy (permeable through the phone), he declared, quite suddenly, that the money was no longer needed. With my best interests in his mind he had spoken to the people concerned, after which things came together beautifully for him, and most importantly, for me. He confessed that he was not the authorized clearing agent of the shipping company, but just doing a favour for his friend, Mr A. 

 Next day, Mr A got back in touch, again quite abruptly, and confessed that Mr B had looked me up from the Customs list whatever that was and contacted me. He did not seem either surprised or mortified by this intrusion into what was supposed to be his own job and responsibility. Rather, he was petulant that I was back with him, on square one, after spurning his good samaritan, making things difficult. One could almost hear him muttering, How dare you upset our (his and Mr Bs) neat little swindle? After all, being the authorized agent, he could hardly venture into this all by himself. By this time, I had finally resigned myself to going to the port the following day. 

 My visit to the Calcutta Port Trust was another story altogether. In order to enter the precincts of the port, an entry permit is needed these days, for which hundreds queued outside a dilapidated, filthy little office. People waited, amidst unimaginable squalor, drinking tea, screaming, thrusting forms into the faces of irritable officials intensely reluctant to do their jobs. Two policemen sat at a table chatting amicably, while people ran around them offering bribes to get a piece of paper with their photographs embossed on it. I was asked to complete a form with my personal details, which nobody cared to verify against any other photo ID. Whoever handed in the forms with whatever information were photographed the time of waiting depending on the amount of bribe offered and given an entry permit. After a 40-minute wait, and some twenty-odd rupees handed around quite openly, Mr A emerged out of the crowd triumphantly holding my permit. Once the customs officer had officially cleared the cargo, it took over an hour to get the release orders. All that while I waited, agonizing, the sun beating down, Mr A chattering inanely, a group of stubbled middle aged men all clearing agents screaming, gesticulating, waving papers. Finally, after signing some documents, I earned my personal release along with those of my cartons.

 A DINNER, A WRITER AND A BOOK

 Great minds at work

 A night at the Majestic: Proust and the Great Modernist Dinner Party of 1922 By Richard Davenport-Hines, Faber, ? 10.50

 The title of this book is both misleading and significant. It is misleading because the book is not about the night at the Majestic Hotel in Paris that the title suggests. It is significant because the two principal words of the title are crucial for the understanding of Proust?s work which is what the book is about. Marcel Proust was a creature of the night, and majestic is just about the right word to describe his literary achievement embodied in the novel, ? la recherche du temps perdu.

 The night at the Majestic was a non-event which had the potential to be a cardinal episode in the history of modernism. On May 18, 1922, at the behest of Sydney and Violet Schiff, a rich couple known for their patronage of the arts and artists, a supper was organized at a private room of the Majestic. Among the guests were Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, Igor Stravinsky, Serge Diaghilev and Marcel Proust. It was a meeting of the founders, except for T.S. Eliot, of modernism. It would not be wrong to expect that matters of great pitch and moment were discussed in such a rare gathering of the modern greats. Nothing of the sort happened. 

 Joyce appeared as coffee was being served. He had no evening clothes and to hide his embarrassment had got himself drunk. Clive Bell, who was one of the guests, recalled that Joyce looked unwell. Around 2 o?clock in the morning, Proust made an appearance dressed in expensive black and looking very poised. This was to be the only meeting between two of the greatest writers of the 20th century. But they hardly spoke: Joyce spoke of his head, Proust of his stomach. Joyce was to say later, ?He was interested in duchesses, I in chambermaids.? Obviously, they had not hit it off. But when Proust died six months to the day, Joyce was there at the funeral.

 This supper party provides Richard Davenport-Hines with an opportunity to explore the life and work of Proust. This is where Davenport-Hines blossoms. His reading of Proust is as close as it is full of insight. He recreates for readers the world that Proust inhabited and how this came to influence the writing of the great novel, to the extent of being reflected in it.

 In the process of doing this, Davenport-Hines also brings alive Paris of that era. Into his narrative flits in aristocrats, French and English, and patrons of the arts like the Schiffs who had hosted the dinner at the Majestic, ?rich amateurs?, the author calls them.

 The theme of homosexuality ? or inversion as Proust and even Freud were prone to call it ? runs through the book. Proust was ever aware of ?the permanent possibility of danger? but this did not stop him from writing as he did in Sodome et Gomorrhe which got translated into English under the euphemistic title, The Cities of the Plain. ?This puny, reclusive neurasthenic,? Davenport-Hines writes, ?showed, in 1921-2, magnificent audacity: he proved himself what he always most desired to be, a brave and resolute man.?? This was what was majestic about Proust and his novel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FLYING IS A PAIN

 Some people are under the impression that the government in New Delhi is a pre-reform Congress government. Once this impression is formed, every action of unreformed ministers like Mr Arjun Singh will confirm it. This shadow of the past obscures the fact that the government has a few ministers who do live in the present and plan for the future. Amongst them is the aviation minister, Mr Praful Patel. He is seized with the urgent need to expand airport capacity, convinced that it should be done by the private sector, and is trying his best to expedite expansion and modernization, at any rate, of the metro city airports. The first results can be seen in the new private domestic terminal in Mumbai. Spacious and functional, it gives a glimpse of what air travel can be. Unfortunately, it will be long before the futuristic airports arrive. Meanwhile, almost all airport terminals have become nightmarish overcrowded, uncomfortable and dingy. This is not just due to underinvestment; it is also due to the grant of airline licences to all comers. The result is that there are not enough counters and airlines must often take turns to occupy them. There is not enough seating space; passengers hang disconsolately around the gates for announcement of their flights. And there is congestion in the air, planes have to queue up to take off and land, and time tables have become impossible to adhere to. Things rapidly go out of hand in winter when northern fogs delay morning flights. Airlines have a hard time flying passengers on the day of their choice, let alone hour.

 Mr Patel held a meeting with the airlines in the last week of September, but it was not to discuss passengers misery. It was to discuss the travails of the airlines. Some are in trouble because of the low fares they charge; others because they charge princely fares for royal treatment and cannot find enough princes to fly. However, this is not an issue about which Mr Patel should be talking to airlines. Competition causes discomfort; it should, and it is none of Mr Patels business to rescue airlines. At worst, some of them will go bankrupt, and will be sold to more able entrepreneurs.

 But the faster the traffic grows, the better the airlines chances of survival. Traffic capacity is entirely in the ministrys hands; it is what Mr Patel should be devoting his energies to. Luxury can wait: what is necessary is terminal capacity; the Airport Authority of India should be putting up temporary buildings as fast as possible. So is runway capacity; the ministry should order automatic landing facilities for all airports, and insist that no pilot not trained in using them can be employed in India. Airport investment is one thing on which the government should not stint. After all, it is intent on investing in infrastructure, and airports are infrastructure for tomorrows hoi polloi.

 YET TO REACH THE TARGET

 DOCUMENT

 Extract from the report of the UN secretary-general, August, 2006

 States...are the servants and instruments of human beings, and not the other way round. Once this fundamental principle is... accepted, it becomes easy to see why the three cardinal purposes of the Organization development, security and human rights are so indissolubly interconnected.

 In order to develop and prosper, human beings must be able to look to the State for security and protection and be able to exercise their individual rights not only civil and political but also economic, social and cultural under the rule of law. Likewise, human beings can feel truly secure only if...they can be confident that their basic rights and human dignity will not be violated.

 Human beings will enjoy meaningful human rights only if they can escape from grinding and degrading poverty and if they can rely on a strong and just State...to protect them from violence and crime.

 In carrying out its mission on all three fronts, one of the Organizations greatest assets is its idealistic and courageous staff, many of whom serve in situations of hardship and danger. During the past decade, United Nations personnel have been increasingly targeted in places of strife and conflict. Our mission to build a safer, better world for all people is no longer a guarantee of protection... Consequently, we have had to learn how best to advance our mission to help others without excessively endangering our own.

 But our commitment must never change. The United Nations...must be able to advance their interests effectively in all three areas development, security and human rights.... This report shows how the Organization has sought to do so in the past year and in the light of the past 10 years....There is much in it that we can be proud of. But I am also fully conscious of the alarming extent to which, on all three fronts, our capacities fall short of the challenges we face. That is why I am convinced that the task of strengthening the United Nations is...an imperative that directly concerns the interests of all Member States and should...engage their urgent attention.

 ...In the Millennium Declaration of 2000, world leaders set forth a bold and inclusive new vision for humanity....Leaders committed themselves to spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty. Since 2000, the United Nations, together with eminent voices from Government, civil society, business and science, has given spirit to this commitment...The result has been dramatically increased global attention for the full one-sixth of humanity who still live in the most extreme form of poverty, measured as income of less than one dollar per day.

 ...As highlighted in the statistical annex to the present report, from 1990 to 2002, the developing worlds proportion of people living in extreme poverty dropped from 28 per cent to 19 per cent, driven mostly by gains in eastern and southern Asia. Average child mortality rates in developing countries fell from 95 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 79 in 2004. More than 1.2 billion people gained access to improved sanitation over the same period...

 But progress has been uneven and the ongoing levels of human deprivation remain staggering. Each year, more than 10 million children die before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable causes. Women in the developing world are more than 45 times more likely...to die during pregnancy and childbirth than women in the developed world. More than 800 million people remain chronically undernourished. Half the developing world still lacks access to sanitation, a fifth has no access to safe water, and slum populations are growing steadily...The world missed the international goal for gender parity in education by 2005, and the epidemic of violence against women remains a scourge on humanity.

 TO BE CONCLUDED

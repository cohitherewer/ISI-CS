 A taxing business

 Sir ? Only those who do not wish to make a clean breast of their financial transactions would find the proposed income tax form complicated (?Very taxing?, June 8). An increase in the number of pages does not make a form difficult to fill in. One cannot understand why people need professional help to provide basic information like the investments made, loans obtained, gifts received and the opening and closing balances in bank accounts. The assessee goes through a complicated process while investing money under various heads, which may include purchasing property or investing in the stock market. He also goes through the formalities needed to obtain a loan from the bank. A professional tax expert, whose help he thinks he needs, cannot fill the form unless he is provided the relevant information by the assessee. But if one can furnish such information to a professional, why can?t one provide it to the tax authorities directly? The income tax department has good reasons to believe that many of our honourable citizens often forget to include vital details during tax payment and the filing of returns. The proposed form will help people suffering from selective amnesia to remember all such information. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Instead of creating more complications through a cumbersome four-page income tax form, the income tax department should go for a drastic cut in currency-circulation to bring people into the tax net. All sales and purchases exceeding, say Rs 20,000, even if paid in parts, must be done through banks. This will make financial deals more transparent and coax people to disclose their actual income. In case of cash payments, currency tax at the rate of 30 per cent may be imposed. Payments of bills for essential services like water supply, telephone, electricity and municipal taxes exceeding Rs 1,000 must be made through cheques or drafts only. All drafts, pay-orders and traveller?s cheques must carry the name, address and account numbers of purchasers with a reduced validity-period of around 45 days to prevent misuse. This would help keep a record of income as well as expenditure of people who fall under the tax bracket, thereby making the new income tax form unnecessary.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba 

 Sir ? Thanks to the Central Board of Direct Taxes, Form 2E does not remain saral or simple anymore, and shows promise to create more problems for the middle class (?Saral makes way for four-page tax form?, June 3). Although intended to lessen the anomalies between a person?s income and expenditure, the form may still fail to bring to book numerous small trade and real estate transactions in black money. Other than increasing the cost of collecting taxes, such reforms will further disillusion people about the income tax department. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? A new income tax form has been designed to target the blackmarket. But instead of catching the big fish, the form may end up discouraging tax-payers even further. When people are finding it difficult to make both ends meet, one wonders if such added problems are necessary. 

 Yours faithfully,

Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Sir ? The new four-page income tax form has provoked a lot of anger and criticism. It needed Sonia Gandhi to convince the government that the new form, seeking more income details, might offend the public. Although the form has been made optional for this year, the promise of a fresh form to be designed next year does not rule out similar problems. Another thing. Perhaps, the finance minister himself should have taken the decision instead of the Congress president. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

 Held in reserve

 Sir ? The report, ?OBC XI does IIT, quotaless? (June 1), shows that reservations are not the only way merit can be sustained. If 11 students belonging to other backward classes could clear the entrance examination for admission into the Indian Institutes of Technology without taking advantage of the quota system, then other OBCs can do the same. Instead of reserving seats for minority groups, the Indian government should seriously think of providing certain benefits to the economically backward so that their merit is not overlooked. This has to begin at the grassroots; primary education should be provided to them at a nominal charge. If the foundations are strong, higher education would not require any quotas.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The success of 11 students does not mean there is no need of the quota system. They received rigorous training from a coaching centre in Bihar which accommodates only 30. What will happen to thousands of others?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sridhar, Calcutta

 SIX VISITS, AND THE HINT OF A BREAKTHROUGH

 Unlike his predecessor, Manmohan Singh perhaps prefers the slow-and-steady initiative on Kashmir. It seems to be finally showing results, in spite of bureaucratic sloth, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Back to making friends

 The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, we are told, really and truly wants to solve the Kashmir problem. He wanted very much to have the Hurriyat Conference on board his Round Table Conference in Srinagar last week, and was extremely disappointed it did not happen. Mirwaiz Umer Farooq?s Hurriyat has already become the real interlocutor with the Pakistanis on Kashmir. Now it is Delhi?s turn, at least on the prime minister?s part, to acknowledge that that is the case.

 Note, too, the first direct references to Islamabad in Manmohan Singh?s speech, an admission that ?Kashmir? can hardly be resolved without Pakistan?s involvement in the process. In fact, the informal axis between Delhi-Srinagar-Islamabad finally converts the peace process so far on parallel tracks (between Delhi-Islamabad and Delhi-Srinagar) into a triangular relationship. 

 Manmohan Singh?s other concession to Pakistan, made on the banks of the Dal Lake in Srinagar, is equally significant. He indicated that India had put forward certain initiatives to Pakistan, and hinted that these were in the nature of ?institutional arrangements? that shared sovereignty between the two Kashmirs. He pointed out that New Delhi was awaiting an answer from Islamabad. 

 Indeed, one of the five joint working groups set up to take the Kashmir peace process forward, is all about promoting relations on both sides of the line of control. The prime minister?s advisers feel it may now be time to offer the ?sharing of sovereignty? on issues which directly affect the people, such as river waters, tourism, trade, and the environment. 

 And slowly, as people from both sides of Kashmir begin to participate in institutional arrangements of such a non-political nature, the very nature of that interaction will throw up ideas as to what is done with the political aspect of the problem. 

 For the first time, too, despite the overwhelming importance of the security establishment in the prime minister?s office and in the home ministry (the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, home secretary, V.K. Duggal, former intelligence bureau chief, A.K. Dullat), it seems as if Manmohan Singh may be beginning to assert himself on Kashmir. In the face of these security apparatchiks, the prime minister?s ?Track II friends? are responsible for the public formulation of these path-breaking ideas, such as shared sovereignty. 

 And so, despite having lost a number of battles on Kashmir ? including letting the Hurriyat stay away from Round Table II ? the prime minister may actually have had the Kashmiris sit up and take notice of the ideas he floated in the valley last week.

 The problem is, once the prime minister makes his wonderful speeches on the banks of the Dal Lake (?zero tolerance for custodial deaths? etc), and returns to Delhi, everything returns to normal in the valley. The Rashtriya Rifles unleash another rampage, the latest being the alleged rape of a 14-year-old girl returning from school in Baramulla. 

 The other problem is that when the prime minister is confronted with a major issue , instead of dealing with it politically, he goes and forms a committee. At last count, there were 48-49 groups of ministers at the Centre, on issues as varied as reservations, to the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the 1857 rising. 

 And so it was with Kashmir. With the Hurriyat refusal to attend, with the National Conference and the People?s Democratic Party repeating their interpretations on ?autonomy? and ?self-rule?, and with the pressure of showing success (after all, the media adviser, Sanjaya Baru, had declared that Manmohan Singh had now visited Kashmir six times, more than any prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru), Manmohan Singh went and did what he is most familiar with. By setting up five working groups to variously resolve the ?Kashmir? issue, the prime minister perhaps hoped he would turn this highly emotive problem into a faceless, bureaucratic procedure. Needless to say, he succeeded. 

 Instead, if the prime minister had announced a political pointperson on Kashmir, one who had the blessings of both himself and Sonia Gandhi, his Kashmir initiative would have received a major boost. Instead, there are task forces consisting of able academics, ideologues and out-of-the-box economists. It is a good idea that his real advisers remain in the shadows. That way they have the option to come up with interesting ideas, without having the responsibility of owning them. 

 Still, the working group that has been set up to delineate the limits of ?autonomy? under the rubric of ?Centre-state relations? should have far-reaching implications. For a start, the group could reflect on the autonomy report that the Jammu and Kashmir assembly passed in 1998, which was summarily thrown out by the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre a year later. 

 That report, of course, talks about maximum autonomy for the state, with the Centre?s powers restricted to defence, foreign affairs, communications and currency. The rest, including the power to elect the governor ? so far, a prerogative of the Centre, which often uses him against the party in power in the state ? must reside with the state. 

 Surely, then, a new beginning has been made. Unlike the big drama that accompanied Atal Bihari Vajpayee?s visit to Srinagar on April 15, 2003, where he announced his ?hand of friendship? initiative with Pakistan, which in turn set into motion the big breakthrough with Pervez Musharraf the next year, Manmohan Singh perhaps prefers the slow-and-steady initiative. 

 The latter has the dangerous disadvantage of getting lost in the maze of bureaucratic sloth, unless someone doggedly pursues the five files that make up the five working groups. The upside is that depoliticized committees also sometimes smack of thorough and unbiased analysis that is the real need of the moment in Kashmir. 

 Perhaps, though, the real gain from Srinagar was that Islamabad, which has been wandering around the terrain like a paler version of Banquo?s ghost, got a life last week. Perhaps when the prime minister finally visits Pakistan, and, in one fell blow, fixes a host of issues from Siachen to cross-LoC arrangements, the ghost could be laid to rest. For the time being, though, it is doing a pretty good job.

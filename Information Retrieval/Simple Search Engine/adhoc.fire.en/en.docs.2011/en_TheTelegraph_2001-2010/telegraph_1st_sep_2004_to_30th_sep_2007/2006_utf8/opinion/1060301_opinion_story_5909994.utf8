 WHY LESS HYPE IS MORE HEALTH

 Everything in this budget is consistent with what we want India to be in the next ten years, writes Shubhashis Gangopadhyay

 Always picked on

 I have always maintained that as the reform process unfolds, the budget will become progressively irrelevant. In other words, the hype surrounding the budget ? a hype that was first started in the mid-Eighties ? should slowly, but surely, die down. Judging by the lack of budget-hype this year, it seems that this has started to happen. This is a good omen for two reasons. First, it signals that the government is unable to affect, in any significant way, the daily operations of the economy. This is what was expected to happen in the first place ? take the government out of the economy?s hair. Second, it takes the more serious issues, like employment and grassroots development, away from any annual tinkering and towards a more coherent longer-term strategy. Given that we have systematically moved away from 3 per cent to an 8 per cent GDP growth, the reforms seem to be working.

 Not surprisingly, therefore, the finance minister was able to present a budget in parliament with no disruptions. There was so much camaraderie that even the normally stern speaker was heard making witty remarks directed at the opposition bench. The previous prime minister was a quiet back-bencher. Most importantly, the left was quiet even when the finance minister made a remark about the government?s expectation of support for foreign direct investment in infrastructure. Or, for that matter, no one uttered a word when, once again like in every year, there was a call for the rationalization of subsidies.

 It is not difficult to see why there was no major noise. Income taxes were not increased; customs and excise duties were reduced and rationalized; input taxes were reduced; fixed deposits will again qualify for tax exemptions, and so on. The collection of taxes was sought to be streamlined and it was announced that the process will become more e-enabled. This should help in reducing corruption and harassment by tax officials. For most of us, who have the time on a busy working day to catch the budget speech on television, all of this is excellent news.

 However, the finance minister also announced a number of schemes that are supposed to bring smiles on the faces of those who usually do not have the time, on a working day, to hear him speak. These are the people, who are casual labourers, or are in the unorganized sector and, almost always, get paid by the hour. Whether it is because of the left, or the prime minister himself, the finance minister started his speech with a list of initiatives, and corresponding increases in expenditure, covering what the government calls its Flagship Programmes.

 There is no point in having 8 per cent growth if its fruits are not shared by everyone in the economy. For a long time, most proponents of reform had thought that achieving high GDP growth rates was sufficient to solve India?s problems of poverty and backwardness. It will be foolish to think that we will be able to sustain such growth rates if the vast majority of our work force is ill-educated and in ill-health. Therefore, it was essential that the government spent resources on health, education, sanitation, water-supply, and so on. If the finance minister is to be believed, this has happened in the past year and will continue in the coming year. So far, this is good.

 The finance minister congratulated himself on maintaining the fiscal deficit below what was budgeted. Given that he had pressed the pause burden on ?fiscal responsibility? in the last budget, this is indeed commendable. Two things come to light when one looks at the figures. The revised estimates of revenue receipts are lower than budget estimates even though tax revenues were slightly higher. Both receipts and expenditures have come down when compared to budget estimates, but the fall in expenditure was a lot more than in receipts. Moreover, the expenditure reduction is in non-plan expenditure; indeed, total plan expenditure has been higher than was budgeted. What makes the fiscal deficit figure look even better is the fact that the GDP growth rate this year is expected to be higher than what was planned for in the last budget.

 So, what seems to be wrong with this budget? One small point is worth mentioning ? one that could become very important in the years to come. There is little, or no mention of what systems will be put in place to ensure that the huge amounts of expenditure that are being planned will go where they were intended. It is not a budgetary issue, but in a society where cheats are never caught, it is important to know how cheats will be kept away from the honey-pot. In fact, the opposition may argue that the government has taken the easy way out of most problems ? thrown money and wished that the problems will go away. It is up to the concerned ministries and the rest of the government to realize what the finance minister wants done.

 Indeed, this budget, in many places, sounds too good to be true. One gets the feeling that a budget exercise is an easy one, outside the calculation of fiscal deficit and all the other accounting activities. If this budget achieves everything it says it will, India will look a lot healthier next year. And, if it does happen, you will wonder why it was so difficult to do all these years. There can be only one answer ? economic growth. Higher GDP growth means more resources in the hands of the government, more resources means more investment in infrastructure and the social sectors, and all of these generate even more growth and hence, resources. The current government is not only on a virtuous cycle, but has shown great ability to identify it.

 The budget will now be analysed at length. People are already complaining about the increased service tax rate and base. Certain industries are pointing out that certain taxes have not been reduced (or increased, depending on which part of the production process they operate on) while some sectors feel slighted that other sectors have been given greater priority. But, if we are to consider the country as a whole, everything in this budget is consistent with what we want India to be in the next 10 years. In the process, traditional leaders and captains of the economy may have to make way for the younger and, often, new captains. However, the team as a whole will play better and be more competitive. It will be more competitive because it will be young, healthy and educated.

 But, I do have a big complaint. Why pick on cigarettes, year after year?

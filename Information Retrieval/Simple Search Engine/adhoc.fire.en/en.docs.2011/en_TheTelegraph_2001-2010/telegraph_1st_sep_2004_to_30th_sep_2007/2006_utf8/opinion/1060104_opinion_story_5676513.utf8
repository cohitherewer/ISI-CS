 CASTS OF MIND

 In the empowerment of the other backward classes, some political scientists have discerned a deepening of democracy. What in fact this empowerment has done is make the OBCs oppressors of those who are lower than them in the caste hierarchy. The recent act of killing carried out by Yadavs in Raghopur in Bihar made a family belonging to the extremely backward castes the target. The Yadavs, empowered by the rule of Mr Lalu Prasad over the last 15 years, are only replicating the violence perpetrated on them by the upper castes ? Brahmins, Bhumihars and Thakurs ? in the days before the Yadavs had become politically important. This show of muscle by the Yadavs was provoked by a very minor incident. Their victim was a family of Kahars who had complained to the police when the Yadavs had forcibly taken away a buffalo and land. The Yadavs obviously believe that the very poor and the downtrodden should not have any recourse to the rule of law. This is not a deepening of democracy but a deepening of oppression.

 From the vantage point of caste oppression and caste violence, very little has changed in Bihar. Only the perpetrators and victims have become different. If there is one thing that incidents like the one in Raghopur suggest, it is the futility of the project to eradicate caste inequalities through reservations. The recommendations of the Mandal commission have made OBCs more powerful but have failed to change their attitude towards caste and the inequalities that flow from it. Social engineering has, in fact, lost out to the hardy perennials of the caste system. This is the real challenge before the new political dispensation under the leadership of Mr Nitish Kumar. The problem lies embedded in the caste system. But nobody quite knows how to eradicate it. If Mr Kumar finds a way and has the political will to push it through, he will have initiated a social revolution in Bihar as important as the one started by the Buddha.

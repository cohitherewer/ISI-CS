The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BEFORE THE STORM

 Sudipta Bhattacharjee

 A major turbulence is brewing in Manipur. On Monday, the police foiled an attempt by protesters to march through the streets of Imphal over the detention of two human rights activists. The crackdown came a day after 10 elderly women stormed the Imphal West police station. Torchlit rallies were organized on Sunday night, while women took on the security forces as human shields on Saturday. 

 The flurry of activities apart, a special committee of the Conference of Non-Governmental Organisations, in consultative status with the United Nations, sent SOS emails to heads of state in India and conflict managers worldwide to help the duo. Leitangthem Umakanta and Yenkokpam Langamba, office-bearers of Threatened Indigenous Peoples Society, were arrested last month on charges of militant affiliation. While Umakanta is in judicial custody till Thursday, Langamba is in police custody. Both are members of the Apunba Lup, the powerful Manipur-based conglomeration of human rights organizations.

 The two, according to CONGO chairman Roberto Mucaro Borrero in New York, were tortured in police custody in Manipur province, close to the border with Myanmar. Their exact place of detention is unclear. Such myopic and ill-informed missives smack of the prejudice and gullibility to propaganda that co-exist with an insidious militant network in the North-east.

 The Apunba Lup, which spearheaded a violent uprising two years ago over the custodial death of Thangjam Manorama, alleges that these arrests were the Manipur governments attempt to wrongly project leaders of civil society organizations in the wake of the August 16 attack on the Iskcon temple in Imphal. It claimed that security forces had masterminded the blast to put Manipur on the global terrorism map. Their campaign is boosted by the fact that no breakthrough has been made in the investigation or any assailant identified till now. The activists have even pointed out that the blast was an attempt to seek reimposition of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act within Imphals municipal limits, which had been withdrawn two years ago by the Ibobi Singh government.

 Urgent action

 Excesses committed by security forces are not new to this conflict-ridden zone, so the global concern surrounding the arrest of the Meitei duo probably emanates from the fact that they had participated in the UN working group on indigenous peoples (2002-04) and the UN permanent forum on indigenous issues (2004-2006), thereby building a network of influential policymakers.

 Borreros missive was interestingly titled Urgent Action Needed in Manipur, with the subhead: Fear for safety/ torture. The letter addressed to the prime minister, the Manipur chief minister, the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil and the chief justice of India, Y.K. Sabharwal, among others ended with a recommendation that the place of detention be revealed immediately (as if the security personnel have spirited them away). It is a sad reflection on the efficacy of alert groups like the Apunba Lup that such uninformed opinion is requisitioned for a just cause.

 Where, one wonders, do these rights groups disappear when militants openly kill, assault and extort? Why is it left to Meira Paibis (women activists) to lead rallies, and sometimes resort to desperate acts such as the nude protest in 2004? How would they justify the death penalty threat sans trial issued by three major militant outfits in Manipur to drug traffickers and tobacco vendors from September 15? 

 Spare a thought, too, for others killed in recent encounters, like Longjam Surjit. Not having had the opportunity to sport UN connections, local residents can claim, at best, a posthumous vindication.

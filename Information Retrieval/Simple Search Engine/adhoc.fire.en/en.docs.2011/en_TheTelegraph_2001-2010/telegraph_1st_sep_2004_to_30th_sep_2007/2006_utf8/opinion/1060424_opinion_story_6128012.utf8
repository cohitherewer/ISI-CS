 Letters to Editor

 Sen and good sense

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha has conclusively argued that Amartya Sen is the best candidate for president (?A winner at the end?, April 15). India needs an apolitical person at the helm to steer it through the challenges of a new era. India?s economic aspirations will be fulfilled if Sen and Manmohan Singh combine their resourcefulness and use their expertise to design a perfect model of development. However, when it comes to being the first citizen of the country, one cannot talk of his regional identity. Sen will be good for all Indians, regardless of class, creed and community. After all, if regionalism had such a strong claim to the post, then who would stop the Lalu Prasads and Jayalalithaas from being nominated to the post?

 Yours faithfully,

Abdus Samad, Incheon, Korea

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s tongue-in-cheek article in support of Amartya Sen is replete with the author?s own idiosyncrasies. The fifth and last justification ? that Sen as president would be good for Bengal ? dilutes the article that was serious thus far. Given Guha?s apathy for Bengalis, displayed on earlier occasions, he need not take up Bengal?s cause. Sen owes nothing to politicians or columnists and one would be surprised if he stoops to become the first citizen of the country now.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I appreciate the contributions of Amartya Sen, but I do not agree with Ramachandra Guha that Sen?s academic background makes him eligible for the post of president. Considering the opportunism displayed by almost all political parties and the unwieldy coalitions today, India needs a leader with integrity who is in touch with the ground realities of Indian society. Such first-hand experience combined with scholarship would certainly augur well for India. At present, Jaswant Singh has the best credentials to be the head of the state. However, he could do with people like Sen among his advisors.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? While Ramachandra Guha strongly advocates the idea of Amartya Sen?s becoming the president of India, he tends to play to the gallery by appealing to Bengali sentiments in justifying Sen?s nomination. As a Bengali, I too believe that at times, Bengal has been discriminated against. However, Sen?s candidature should not have anything to do with this perception. Bengalis will not profit from clinging to the past. Sen deserves to be the president of India based solely on his credentials and not his regional identity. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There is nothing wrong in making a case for a Nobel laureate economist as the next president of India. Whoever be his rivals, Amartya Sen may be expected to win the race by a handsome margin. Sen?s credentials would make him the perfect successor to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. Besides, since globalization has come to stay, Sen?s resourcefulness would ensure both social justice and economic growth for the country. Nevertheless, one must take exception to Ramachandra Guha?s last reason in support of Sen?s candidature. The author is either unsure about Bengal?s history and politics, or must be quite out of his mind.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? No one is likely to contest Amartya Sen?s pedigree, merit and reputation when it comes to choosing a president for India. However, having Sen as president to avenge a long list of wronged Bengalis, all the way from Subhas Chandra Bose to Sourav Ganguly, is condemnable. Even if this rather juvenile chauvinism wins accolades from the Bengali readership, it also threatens to eclipse Sen?s genuine intellectual achievements. In the end, the image of a people already accused of being parochial can only be further tarnished. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Maiti, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s single parochial argument alone could dash whatever little chance there was of non-Bengali politicians from nominating Amartya Sen for president. Sen himself is above such regionalism, just like Rabindranath Tagore and Subhas Chandra Bose. Right-minded Bengalis, too, will certainly dissociate themselves from this bias. The author, who calls Gandhi a bania from Gujrat, ought to take a cue from Sen and broaden his mental horizons.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Chatterjee, London

 Sir ? An India that loves to hate Bengalis will ensure that Amartya Sen is not nominated for the Indian presidency. Ramachandra Guha is right, Bengalis do have a long history suffering discrimination. While independent India hails Lala Lajpat Rai and Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal remains an unsung hero. Surya Sen, Kshudiram Bose and Bagha Jatin are just a few among scores of Bengali freedom fighters who deserve but do not get even a fraction of the honour bestowed on Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad. Despite their brilliant careers, Tapan Sinha, Soumitra Chatterjee and Uttam Kumar have never been considered for the Dada Saheb Phalke award while lesser lights from Bollywood and the South have bagged it. And had it not been for the international community, Satyajit Ray and Sen himself would never have received the Bharat Ratna. It would, therefore, be a little unrealistic to imagine Sen in the Rashtrapati Bhavan someday.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

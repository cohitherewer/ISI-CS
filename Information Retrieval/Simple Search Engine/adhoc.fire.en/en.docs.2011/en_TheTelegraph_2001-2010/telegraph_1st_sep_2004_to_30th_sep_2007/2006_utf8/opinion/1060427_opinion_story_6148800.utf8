The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT PEACEFUL

 Setbacks are hardly sudden; they usually have a build-up. The ceasefire between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, mediated by Norwegian peacemakers in 2002, is suddenly looking shaky. The suicide bomber who blew herself up inside the army headquarters in Colombo, killing nine men and grievously injuring the army chief, represented perhaps the most daring strike in recent times. But trouble has been brewing off the north-eastern shores near Trincomalee between military boats and rebels for sometime now. The LTTE has not claimed responsibility for most of the action alleged to be theirs, including landmine attacks in the city centre, while police and military personnel are being blamed for inaction when mobs attack Tamil civilians. The air attacks by the government are raising questions: are they merely to frighten the rebels, or are they a signal of full-scale war once again? The situation in Trincomalee had already turned ugly, with deaths and terrified escapes painfully reminiscent of the recent past. The ceasefire has not been withdrawn, although that is difficult to believe. There was some hope that there would be an end to the years of bloodshed and destruction ? with the beginnings of negotiations for peace-talks, the ceasefire, the reopening of the road from Colombo to Jaffna initiated by the former prime minister, Mr Ranil Wickremesinghe, the post-tsunami accord for the distribution of aid, the withdrawal of the demand for an actual Tamil state by the rebels, and other signs of a meeting halfway. The fresh build-up of hostility in the north-east, culminating in a daring break into the army headquarters, bodes ill for the yet uncertain peace process.

 The atmosphere seems charged with the strong Buddhist-Sinhalese support for the new president, Mr Mahinda Rajapakse. The government?s failure to implement the terms of the post-tsunami accord, and then the supreme court?s ruling against its implementation, had revived bitterness and cynicism in the LTTE. Reportedly, aid failed to reach the north-eastern parts of the island, which were hard hit by the tsunami. The violence from both sides seems to be following an all-too-familiar pattern, yet new factors have entered into play. Bringing peace to Sri Lanka could never have been easy; it is urgent now to address these factors if progress is to be made.

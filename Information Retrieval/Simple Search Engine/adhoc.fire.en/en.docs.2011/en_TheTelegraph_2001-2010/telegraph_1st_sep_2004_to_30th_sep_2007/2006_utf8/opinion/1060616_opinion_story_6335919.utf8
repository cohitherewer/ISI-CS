 A LOOK INTO THE ANATOMY OF FAITH AND ITS DICTATES 

 Purging the soul

 God?s Little Soldier By Kiran Nagarkar, Harper-Collins, Rs 595

 Kiran Nagarkar?s God?s Little Soldier reflects the author?s bewilderment at cataclysmic episodes of violence and their frequent origins in religious bigotry. It is a painstakingly contemplated analysis of the mind and temperament of a fanatic; the author thinks aloud as he writes, does a man become a fanatic or is he born one ? God?s Little Soldier is as much an introspective philosophical probe into the modern phenomenon of terrorism as it is a work of fiction. Thus, the book becomes a long and complex journey, multi-layered and multi-dimensional, a breathless race to the end till the protagonist meets his nemesis.

 The story unfolds in a liberal Muslim family of Bombay where two brothers, Amanat and Zia, are born to refined and enlightened parents. There is, however, an aunt, Zubeidakhala, who convinces Zia that he is destined to be the saviour of his people. Zia?s father, Zafar, suffers a reversal of fortune and the family is forced to leave their luxurious bungalow at Nariman Point and take refuge in the heart of Bombay?s Bhendi Bazaar. The first half of the book, dealing with the boys? formative years, is delightful. Nagarkar uses words with casual abandon to paint a sensuously exuberant portrait of a vibrant city.

 As the plot progresses, there is a slow, sinister development of a certain intolerance in Zia, a tendency to extreme action, which is apparent when he stabs Bajrang?s dog or when he flagellates himself in a Muharram procession. It is the other members of the family who emerge as more endearing characters. Nagarkar seems to feel more comfortable writing about them, while with Zia, he sweats under the collar, for Zia has a will of his own.

 Amanat suffers from asthma and nurses an unspoken passion for the doctor?s daughter, Sagari. He is also an author, an industrial designer and finally, an architect. Extended excerpts from his book on Kabir, The Arsonist, form concentric rings inside the novel; his letters and fables reveal a deeply spiritual and eclectic being, one whose mind is as open as Zia?s is closed. He strains to communicate to Zia throughout the book and it ends with a letter from him. Amanat, is also in a sense, the precipitator of events, moving the book along its course.

 The lesser characters are even more finely etched. Abbajan?s preface to his will is touching, Ammijan?s love for gambling and racing and her eventual disappearance leaves behind the poignancy of rose petals dying in the wind. Zubeidakhala?s unrequited love for Dilip Kumar and her use of the enema in a ruthless purging of sins, are described with economy and perfection.

 Zia goes through troubled student years in Cambridge and learns, after his graduation ceremony, that he had been baptised when barely a week old. He survives various traumatic experiences during which visions of Jesus doggedly pursue him. He finally abandons Islam and becomes a novice in a Trappist monastry. The texture of the novel is so dense in this part that it is entirely a book in itself. The letter written to Zia by the Abbot perhaps contains Nagarkar?s own attempts to come to terms with the anatomy of faith and its dictates. It complements Amanat?s earlier letter in which he chastises Zia for his terrible indictment of their mother: ?...you can not have both mercy and retributive chastisement in the same breath.? When Amanat makes a heart-rending appeal to Zia, ?It?s not too late...Tell her that you love her as only Zia can love his mother. The light will be back in Ammi?s eyes...?, it is as if the author is pleading with extremists everywhere to regain their reason and not to confuse retribution with justice.

 The third part of the book, Tejas, fares poorly in comparison to the first two. Here, Zia discovers trapped energies within himself with the help of Shaktamuni and yoga, gets involved in anti-abortion campaigns and munition selling rackets. This part is tedious, lacking Nagarkar?s deftness, and makes you lose the umbilical connection you had built with the book.

 Parallel to Zia?s story runs the story of Amanat, equally self-destructive, but somehow less frightening, for the indulgences are not to redeem any god but are consciously committed and registered as acts of personal weakness. 

 There is no doubt that throughout the book there is the constant impact of well-considered and intense thought. Nagarkar describes eccentricities so succinctly that they immediately establish the image of a character firmly in the reader?s mind. Thus, he speaks not of Amanat?s obsession with his stationary, but his emotional upsets when he loses a pen. ?When he lost a cheap ballpoint, Amanat was bereft. He went around moping for days and turning the house upside down searching for it... After that he forbade Sagari from buying him pens. Soon he ruled out presents altogether?.

 God?s Little Soldier is one of those rare books which make you think, and as the characters get under your skin, they coax and cajole you into celebrating their lives. It is set in tragic times, but strangely enough there is nothing sad about the book. Instead, what echoes in your mind is the beguiling optimism in Amanat?s simple invitation. ?Come home, Zia. Let?s put up our feet and talk about old times.?

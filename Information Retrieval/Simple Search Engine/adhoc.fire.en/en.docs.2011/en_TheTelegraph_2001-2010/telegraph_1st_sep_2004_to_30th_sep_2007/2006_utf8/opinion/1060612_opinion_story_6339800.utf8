 NEW RELATIONS

 Aid has come to be accepted as part of international diplomacy. Given the special relationship between the two countries, India?s aid to Nepal has had more than a diplomatic context. New Delhi?s offer of a Rs 100-crore cash support and its commitment to provide another Rs 1000 crore over the next five years for the implementation of different development projects have come at a crucial time for Nepal. The Himalayan kingdom is clearly at a crossroads. Its old institutions, including the monarchy and the political system, are poised for major changes. That the prime minister, Mr Girija Prasad Koirala, chose to visit New Delhi first after being re-instated to power has its own significance. He presides over a crucial time of transition in Nepal and has to measure his steps carefully. There is no denying, though, that his immediate task is to restore the country?s economy to some semblance of order. Ten years of Maoist insurgency and King Gyanendra?s autocratic ways have all but crippled Nepal?s democratic political system. These two factors together have taken their toll on the economy of one of the poorest nations of the world. Mr Koirala needs a national reconstruction plan and should use international aid, including the Indian, to meet that larger goal.

 The economic aid is the easiest part of India?s new relationship with Nepal. What is more challenging is to come to terms with the political changes in Nepal. Despite its economic and military support to Nepal, the Indian role is viewed with suspicion in Kathmandu. True, India has a major stake in the stability and security of Nepal because of the latter?s geopolitical importance. But it is time to change some of the old attitudes. New Delhi cannot afford to be seen as a defender of a dictatorial monarchy or of a corrupt political system. It cannot do so even on the excuse of keeping the Maoists at bay. Fortunately, there are signs of attitudes changing in New Delhi, which helped to bring the Maoists and the democratic parties closer. India must play its role with caution in order to win friends in a new Nepal.

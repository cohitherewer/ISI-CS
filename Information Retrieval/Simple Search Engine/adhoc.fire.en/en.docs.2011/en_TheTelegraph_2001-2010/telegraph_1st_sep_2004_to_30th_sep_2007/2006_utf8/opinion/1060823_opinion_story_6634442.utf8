The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A BURDEN LONG SHED

STEPHEN HUGH-JONES 

 What do the names Macaulay and Kipling mean to you? Its an odd question to raise, you may think, as India enters its 60th year of independence. Yet it wasnt I but an Indian who raised it.

 To any educated Briton, Macaulay is the great 19th-century historian and essayist. Not one in a hundred of us has heard of his minute of 1835 arguing for English as the language of higher education in India; a minute that almost any Indian student knows of, may even have read a few lines of, and probably condemns. Kipling, in contrast, is shared by the two nations, as the author of Plain Tales from the Hills, Kim and much else, including countless poems, all vigorous, one or two brilliant, too many ranting. In my youth, Kipling was under a cloud, as a hyperpatriot and imperialist (both of which he was), a racist (which he was much less thoroughly) and generally second-rate. But since then his admirers, headed initially by T.S. Eliot, have worked overtime, and his very real merits are widely appreciated.

 So I was struck recently to see Ruchir Joshi, writing in The Telegraph on Indian English, argue that as a society we have finally exhumed and cremated the rotting skeletons of Macaulay and Kipling. My first reaction was: fine, provided those who fed the pyre knew what mammoths, however prehistoric, they were disposing of and can do better with an English of their own. But my next thought was: just what does he mean? Its 171 years since Macaulays minute, well over a century since Kipling was writing in or of India. Is it really only now that India has exorcised the two mens presumably baleful influence? And how exactly did India dispose of either skeleton if skeletons there were?

 Macaulays dream of creating a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect is certainly long dead, but it has hardly been awaiting final cremation: that was done in 1947. This was, anyway, an issue of socio-politics, not language. In contrast, English did indeed though not thanks only or even primarily to Macaulay colonize Indian universities; and todays India (let alone, short of mass suicide, its users of English, however Indiomatic) is no nearer disposing of this relic of Macaulay than of Mars. Some rotting skeleton! 

 Kipling, to borrow a phrase that he often used, is another story. He was a fine teller of tales and a superb journalist; happy the editor today, in India or Britain, whose reporters are as good. And he wrote about India. But what skeleton did he leave there to be exhumed? Have Indians ever since seen the Indian psyche or society through Kiplings eyes? Do they imagine their country full of young Anglo-Indians working for British intelligence, or of regimental water-carriers improbably named Gunga Din? Or do Indian writers perhaps imitate Kiplings style? Not that Ive noticed.

 For that matter, have Indians gone around parroting Kiplings notion of the white mans burden? That too had nothing to do with language, but, even if it had, surely no Indian since, maybe, the imperial durbar of 1911 has ever bought in to it. 

 I suspect all Ruchir Joshi meant was that he is glad India is free of British tutelage, and reckons Indian English is so too. Fine but how much simpler just to have said so.

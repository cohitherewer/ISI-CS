 IF MEN WEREN?T CORRUPT, TIGERS WOULD LIVE

 Gold legend

 Tigers in Red Weather By Ruth 

 Padel,

 Little, Brown, ? 17.99

 ?Everywhere tigers depend on political will.? Ruth Padel wakes up to this as her tiger trail comes full circle in the south of India. In Delhi, the first stop of her trail, Padel learns that ?estimating numbers from pugmarks is fallible; yet India?s annual tiger census is based on them?. It?s a puzzle, but it is easy to see how and why it came into being: ?When park administrators say they have lots of tigers, this makes the forest service feel secure, boosts a director?s career, stops scientists and other outsiders looking closer, interfering.?

 In the Sunderbans, tiger-widows must go through impossible official channels if they do not want middlemen to fleece them. ?But how can a widow who can?t read, with young children, get a form from Calcutta while crying for her husband?? In Nepal, where the army protects tigers, the twin evils of Maoism and monarchy have diverted troops away from the task ? ?and tiger numbers reflect political instability instantly?. In Russia, where everything is controlled by big business clans and mafias, rules are for the breaking. In China, there is an appalling lack of a central directive against poaching. In Jakarta, anything from leopard cubs to baby squirrels are sold for a good price in the wildlife markets. And then, back in India, a Sariska officer says, ?The reserve does not suffer from poaching, I am sure there are tigers?, when all tigers have vanished from the reserve. 

 Bureaucrats and political masters are clearly not the tiger?s best friends. But what about the traditional forest-dwellers? Padel plunges into the thick of the argument between human rights activists ? who feel that people who have long cohabited with animals should be allowed to do so ? and animal rights workers ? who would rather keep the natural habitat of wild animals free from people. Padel seems to tilt the human rights way: ?Who can tell a barefoot man it is in his grandchildren?s interest that he does not cut wood for cooking, or grass for his cows? If he doesn?t, there may not be any grandchildren.? If only there were less corruption, the forest and its dependants would be able to live happily ever after. George Schaller, Padel?s Dr Dolittle, says, quoting Gandhi, ?there is enough in the world for everyone?s need but not everyone?s greed.?

 To explore tigerland is to delve into the histories and lives of peoples and even entire civilizations. The tiger-goddess, Bonbibi, protecting honey in the Suderbans, becomes Amba in Korea-China, protecting ginseng for its gatherers. Durga (spelt Durgha by Padel) in east and north India and Ayappa in Kerala, woman and man, are both riders of the tiger. ?Hinduism and Buddhism, India and China, religion and human hierarchy all meet in the art of the tiger rug.? And in Shamanism, the old mountain religion, the tiger is sometimes San-Shin, Spirit of the Mountain, or San-Shin?s favoured beast. In Bhutan, the tiger-mask teaches that it is better to see a tiger alive than face it first in after-life.

 To know the tiger, one has to know its prey. From the sambar to the sika deer to the gaur to the water buffalo, Padel does a brilliant job of reconstructing the life of the tiger in relation to its prey. Here too, she detects the unholy presence of human corruption ? primarily over compensation, if a villager is able to prove that a tiger has killed his kin or a domestic animal. If compensation is denied, as it often is, the tiger must be punished. The proceeds of the punishment are far greater than any government compensation can ever promise.

 So how does one save the tiger? For Padel, all it needs is ?a state that tries to enforce laws despite poverty, greed, corruption?, a state where tiger activists are not charged with the very crimes they are fighting against, one where forest management is not for making money. Perhaps dreaming of such a state is like dreaming of perfect love. Only just before embarking on her journey did Padel find out that her own perfect love was not so after all. As she flits between London and the different stops of her tiger trail, she also charts out the progress of her disengagement with the man with whom ?the alchemy seemed endless?. The moving away happens in tandem with the discovery of the animal in Asia, and is exposed in snatches of some beautiful poetry: Donne, Macniece, Borges, Ezra Pound, Dickinson and Gerard Manley Hopkins.

 Padel is a poet herself. Not too many wildlife writers can imagine a ?black Escher ribbon? where others see a snake, or describe fiddler crabs thus: ?Each had a large salmon-pink front claw, which it waved like the bow arm of a gypsy violinist or drew tight over large yellow eyes, as if embarrassed.? Tigers in Red Weather has strengthened wildlife?s claim to be called literature.

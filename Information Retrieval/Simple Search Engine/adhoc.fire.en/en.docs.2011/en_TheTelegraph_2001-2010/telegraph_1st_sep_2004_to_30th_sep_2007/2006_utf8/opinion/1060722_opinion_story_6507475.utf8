 Letters to Editor

 Cold comfort

 Sir? A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s decision to hold a prayer meeting in memory of the victims of the Mumbai blasts during rush hour brought more misery to the daily commuter. Neither did the bereaved families find any solace in this show, which was nothing but a face-saving exercise to take the pressure off the administration. There is little doubt that the Indian state has a soft approach towards militancy and has singularly failed to counter the menace. Had politicians been less interested in their vote banks, they would probably have found more time to deal with terrorism.

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Equally guilty

 Sir ? The report, ?Battered men at women?s cell?(July 17), was a revelation. It is a pity that there are different laws in place to penalize men and women for committing the same crime. While a husband may be sent to jail for assaulting his wife, a woman who has battered her husband is merely asked to see a counsellor. In this age of gender equality, such a discriminatory attitude is disgusting. 

 Furthermore, the government has taken a number of legal steps to protect women from domestic violence. But it has done precious little to prevent the misuse of these laws. A modern, educated woman seems to care little about hurting men, secure in the belief that she will get away with it. In a so-called male dominated society, it is the men who seem to be suffering due to the absence of any legal protection for them. 

 All men and women who are in favour of a truly equal world should mobilize public opinion to break this status-quo. Perhaps, we can take a cue from the Violence Against Women Act in the United States of America, which has been renewed this year with a clause that the Act will also cover male victims of domestic violence.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There is nothing new about women making false allegations to harass their in-laws and husbands. The torture of married women for dowry continues as well, the anti-dowry laws notwithstanding. Unfortunately, Section 498A, which has been framed to protect women from domestic violence has proved counter-productive, as is evident from the fact that the CID women?s grievance cell is flooded with complaints from tortured husbands. It is shocking to see educated women misusing the law to instill fear in men. In the past, few men would admit that their wives dominated them at home. But more and more of them are now coming forward to lodge complaints against being tortured by their partners. This trend merits serious attention and a quick redressal. A law should be passed to punish such scheming women immediately. Sending women for counselling is a good idea but only those who have not abused existing laws to punish their husbands should be considered for it. The rest, however, should be taken to task for their devious ways. Significantly, many of these women are forced to spread canards against their husbands by other men in the family. The law-enforcing authorities should take this into consideration when they consider steps to check this crime.

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Kumar Sinha, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The death of former Indian football captain, V.P. Sathyan, came as a shock. In his lifetime, Sathyan had received little recognition for his achievements. His tragic death is a classic example of how former players often perish because of the lack of financial aid from both the government and the All India Football Federation.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

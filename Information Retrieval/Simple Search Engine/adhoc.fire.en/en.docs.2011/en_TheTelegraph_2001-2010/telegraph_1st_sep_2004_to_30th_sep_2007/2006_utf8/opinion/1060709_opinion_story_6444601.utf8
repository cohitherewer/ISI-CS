 For a better future

 Sir ? The report, ?Ten types of birds vanish each year?(July 5), reminds us of how irresponsible we have been towards our environment. More than 75 per cent of endangered birds are on the verge of extinction. Experts believe that each plant that becomes extinct may take away with it as many as 30 insects and animals that depend on it for food. The next generation needs to be more sensitive towards what is left of the wilderness. Our environmental awareness must also translate into pro-conservation efforts.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Out of reckoning

 Sir ? A few days after Susmita Chakraborthy committed suicide because she was frustrated with her job in the army, Lieutenant Colonel Priyamvada Mardikar was stripped of her rank in an unceremonious manner (?Army strips lady mascot of rank?, June 24). If a respected institution like the Indian army can openly discriminate against its women officers, smaller organizations can hardly be blamed for doing the same. The army till date is reluctant to give permanent commission to women and pay them salaries at par with their male counterparts. The National Commission for Women should stand up against such injustice and ensure that Mardikar is re-installed in her rank. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anjana Maitra, Rourkela

 Sir ? A needless controversy has been created regarding the suitability of women in the armed forces. Women seem to be under some kind of compulsion to prove themselves equal to men in all spheres of action. Yet, nature has designed the male and the female of the species for different, but complementary functions. Even in the West, large-scale induction of women in the army has taken place only in exceptional circumstances, as during World War II. There is still no such emergencies in India. Which means, there is no need for recruiting women in the army, especially in the combat units. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir ? The army stumped the defence minister?s order for a feasibility study to grant permanent commission to women because its core policy does not allow women to man combat units (?Pranab and army at variance?, June 28). But, as Mukherjee noted, women could use information technology to operate high-tech weapon systems. In other words, women can handle systems operations efficiently. But to increase the percentage of women in the army, the defence sector first needs to be more unbiased in attitude. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Sharma, Digboi

 Sir ? The army authorities? statements and actions following the death of Susmita Chakraborthy will further discourage women from joining the defence forces. If women are indeed not required in the army, then why are they being recruited? Treating women as inferior creatures who are ill-equipped to fight the enemy is an insult to their abilities. In a land where Rani Lakshmibai is considered to be an emblem of valour, women definitely deserve a more honourable position. 

Yours faithfully, 

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Erratum

In Raju Mukherji?s ?Time to pass the baton?(July 6), 

National Cricket Club was wrongly referred to as National Cadet Corps. The error 

is regretted.

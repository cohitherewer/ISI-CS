 GREAT WALL OF THOUGHT CONTROL

 CHINA DIARY

 A new media law in China aims at scanning every news report before it goes to print

 As if news was not bland enough in China, the authorities have decided to make it even more so. A draft of a new media law, called the ?emergency response law? has been put up to the highest law-making body. If approved, it would mean that news of any sudden crisis ? man made or natural ? would first have to be vetted by the government ? both central and local ? before it gets published. Anyone ?making bold to report on the handling of emergency situations in violation of regulations? or ?issuing false reports? would be fined a minimum of 50,000 yuan (US $ 6,250) and a maximum of 100,000 yuan. 

 These ?regulations? could be imposed by the local government, which means that not only would the local media be silenced, but also that reporters from Beijing would not be able to file accurate news from remote areas. In a country where disasters of all kinds strike all the time, this new law will ensure that effectively, no one will ever get to know anything more than the government wants them to. 

 This is exactly what happened when SARS struck in 2003. News of the mysterious new disease was prevented from coming out by the authorities for a long time. This resulted in a higher death toll, as preventive measures were put in place much later than they ought to have been. After the World Health Organization pulled up the Chinese government for this delay, it was assumed that the lesson had been learnt. Indeed, the government came in for praise by the WHO for its handling of the bird flu epidemic last year. 

 Reading reports of catastrophies in the Chinese press ? landslides, floods, mining accidents, you wonder at the need for a new media management law. The pictures in these cases literally tell the story, for the words say nothing. Wailing old villagers, their faces ravaged with grief, staring at the ruins of their homes, or women sitting silently, bowed with grief, outside mines where their husbands are trapped ? some of these photographs could win international prizes. The readers, however, get to know nothing about the lives of the individuals photographed. 

 Censorship is not always to blame for this lack of reportage. In a recent mining disaster, where 56 miners died, the top work safety official gave out the entire story: how local officials had allowed the mine management to violate mining rules, and also how the man in charge had fled immediately after the accident. A hundred stories could have been written based on all this; but most papers chose to rely on Xinhua, the official (and only) news agency, which simply reported the official?s utterances with no follow-up.

 Given such a lazy and obedient press, why bother to come up with a new law? Two factors make it necessary. First, the definition of ?emergency? in it. It covers natural disasters, health crises and social unrest. Second, the presence of foreign media in China, which has so far managed to report news of ?social unrest? in far greater detail than the Chinese press. This includes the Hong Kong papers that are accessible on the mainland. Now, the new rules will apply to the foreign press too. 

 The government is not unaware of the connotations of the draft. Indeed, the vice-minister introducing it took pains to emphasise that the intention was to ensure both officials? duty to disclose and journalists? duty to report ? ?accurately?. 

 Guangzhou?s Southern Metropolis Daily, known for its outspokenness, has already started calling the draft ?nonsense?, and ?a step backwards? (after the lessons of SARS). New Express, a commercial newspaper, again from Guangzhou, highlighted the dangers of news management by government in man-made disasters: ?In such situations, (it) would actually become a tool for corrupt local officials who want to cover up their dirty deeds.? Will the others follow suit?

 Letters to Editor

 Guarding turfs

 Sir ? It must be said, with regard to S.L. Rao?s article, ?Playing with resources? (May 22), that the artificial production of a few more professionals will not, in any way, uplift the other backward classes since even after decades of reservations, a majority of the OBCs still remain mired in poverty. With education and economic development, the social bane of the caste system will automatically wither away. Since there is no allegation of discrimination in schools and colleges, one is taken aback by the government?s argument for reservations as a bulwark against discrimination in professional examinations, higher education and employment opportunities. If caste-based discrimination exists at all, it is only so in the rural areas, where members of the lower castes are sometimes prevented from entering places of worship or drawing water from wells or tanks. Ironically, reservations in education and employment do nothing to eradicate social evils of this kind. The only solution is a broad-based policy to build infrastructure, improve elementary education and allow the backward classes to mature on a long-term and sustainable basis. Numerical quotas, on the other hand, have failed for decades and are sure to do this time round as well. That is why only affluent OBCs seem to support the recent move, since it sanctions a life of ease and indolence.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The flawed educational system of India is both the cause and the effect of reservations. A nation?s character is what its citizens make it. Citizens? actions are a function of their perception that is created largely by education. Education is not a synonym for literacy. Unfortunately, in India, education is a means to score political points, create vote bases and whitewash political misdeeds. Politicians like Arjun Singh are bribing certain sections of society and, at the same time, turning education into a commodity. In the long run, the system of reservations is going to backfire on India in social, economic and intellectual terms. 

 P. Chidambaram?s argument that reservation has helped Tamil Nadu is deceptive. Tamil Nadu has adapted to the crisis of reservation by enrolling almost 90 per cent of its population in the reserved category. Tamil Brahmins, who form a small percentile, have sought refuge in reservations based on money or authority. It must also be remembered that what works in Tamil politics may not work in the complex national scenario. 

 A young mind in the hands of unattached merchants shall shape into an indifferent adult. India needs to begin its focus on loving and sincere teachers and all the sections are responsible for losing the glories of a good teacher. The political classes are responsible for India losing good teachers.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? S.L. Rao rightly emphasizes the necessity of comfortable English while discussing the policy of reservation in education. I worked recently with a group of highly qualified engineers who lamented repeatedly that their lack of fluency in English ruled them out from being considered for certain tours and junkets. While proposing certain ideas for correcting the current imbalances in educational planning, Rao spills over into platitude and preachery. One felt a great idea or two coming, but what actually did come was of the calibre of ?Education must not become as politicized as it has?, or ?The fundamentals of education must improve and quality standards must rise?. For hard data, Rao?s article has been enlightening. But in matters to do with education, stark clear points have to be made, and that Rao fails to do.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Seats of power? (May 26), is right, numerical quotas have indeed not paid the expected dividends. But it is clear that the move is the crowning glory of populist politics. But politicians and the human resources ministry can do nothing about the fact that foreign universities and allied institutions, mostly private, will never show any regard, and rightly so, for a policy which does not prioritize merit above all else. This means that the more affluent gets a better chance to study and prosper. Here comes the role of the leftists, who can, in the present scenario, persuade the Centre to de-link jobs from degrees and put more emphasis on vocational education. This idea was, in fact, mooted by the former prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, when he had proposed a national education policy. This is the policy that needs to be revised and implemented.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? If UPA politicians read and understood editorials like ?Seats of power?, it may have prevented them from committing a grave political blunder. Most of the OBC voters do not know how new bill could affect their lives ? since they have always been kept outside the frame of political and social changes. So it is unlikely that plans to appease them will translate into votes for the Congress ? which perhaps defeats the party?s whole purpose.

 Yours faithfully

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

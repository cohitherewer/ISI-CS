 Letters to Editor

 Unfit for drinking

 Sir Who asked the Centre for Science and Environment to conduct its surveys, what are its credentials, what is the methodology of the surveys and who finances them? From fish to vegetables, virtually everything we eat or drink contains pesticides. If we can digest drinking water with arsenic, wheat with traces of rodent hair, what is so special about contaminated soft drinks? Is it that these are mainly consumed by rich people? Does the government feel that the lives of the rich are precious, and those of the poor less so? 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir The organization called CSE has once again found pesticides in soft drinks, this time at a level much higher than what was found in 2003 (Pesticides still in soft drinks, Aug 3). During the Nineties, the multinational companies took over our indigenous soft drink business and gradually spread their empire. They found us so ignorant and callous about food standards that they even stopped printing the expiry date and ingredients on the labels of their products, which is mandatory in all countries. When the first traces of pesticide were found in the sealed bottles, the MNCs were let off with only mild warnings. These companies are not only eating up our industries, but they are also killing people with their adulterated products. Indian celebrities should show greater social responsibility and stop endorsing these products. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Rishra

 Sir The fact that the soft drinks manufactured in the United States of America have no pesticide residues shows that the cola companies follow the standards set by the American government. If cola factories in the West have the technology required to maintain standards, can India not demand the same from them? How long do the consumers have to suffer before the government takes a stand and sets its own standards? The health ministry should see to it that the cola MNCs cannot dump their sub-standard products on the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir Rather than concentrating only on soft drinks, the CSE should also probe whether there are pesticides in municipal water and other water-based drinks such as milk and fruit juices. The cola companies, spending millions on advertisements, can easily set up plants for the purification of their drinks and the bottles. Also, mandatory printing of ingredients on the bottles will clear doubts about the presence of intoxicants or harmful substances in the drinks. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The director of CSE, Sunita Narain, has rightly said that the Union health ministry is more interested in industrial health than in the health of the citizens. But it remains to be seen whether the new series of tests carried out by the ministry reveals anything soon. One fears that the drinks will again be cleared by the Indian Soft Drinks Manufacturing Association. Even if it is otherwise, these drinks will work their poison on the people till the results are out. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir There have been heated debates in parliament over the cola MNCs slowly poisoning the people of India with pesticides in their drinks. But the consumers always have the choice of not drinking these cola drinks. Unfortunately, no such choice is available with contaminated water or adulterated food. Where are our legislators when the government fails to provide potable water to its citizens? Perhaps they are busy shirking responsibility.

 Yours faithfully,

Charubrata Ray, Pune

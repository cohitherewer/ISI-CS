 Might is right

 Sir ? The visit of Nicholas Burns, the undersecretary of state of the United States of America, had an agenda quite different from merely evincing the nature of India?s nuclear programme (?Bush trip on, deal in bush?, Jan 21). It is quite apparent that Burns wanted to force India to take an anti-Iran stand, which is now the first priority of the Bush administration. What India will get in return for falling in line with the US is still not clear. But let us keep in mind certain facts about the so-called Indo-US nuclear deal. One, the hoopla surrounding the US recognition of India as a nuclear state is a big hogwash. In future, the US can always use the plea that the US congress would not ratify the government?s position on India?s nuclear status. Two, once India starts taking an anti-Iran stand, the US will use all kinds of bait to push India down the slippery slope. In the end, India will be left high and dry while the US walks away, its immediate objective fulfilled. India has to remember that an anti-Iran stand is not in its interest. It has a lot to gain from Iran in terms of trade, especially oil, or for keeping the pressure on Pakistan, or for a more constructive policy with regard to Afghanistan. 

 There is absolutely no reason for India to hurry about getting a US stamp on its nuclear status. For one, it will not change the ground realities. Nuclear fuel from the US will not make a difference to the Indian power sector. Moreover, India has learned to live with nuclear sanctions for the last thirty years, and is well-adapted to the situation. So let India link US demands to counter-demands like putting pressure on Pakistan to vacate Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and a firm commitment for a seat in the security council.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The visits by the US undersecretary of state and the European Union?s special envoy, Michael Schaefer, have sharply underlined the need for India to have a clear policy on the issue of Iran?s nuclear programme. Both have left New Delhi in no doubt that the US and the EU3 countries want it to support their efforts to ensure that the emergency meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency?s board of governors in Vienna on February 2 not only refers the matter to the UN security council but also obtains a strong signal from the latter against Iran pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. 

 Several developments have occurred since India supported the US in the last IAEA meeting in September 2005 ? the EU3 dropping Iran?s suspension of uranium enrichment as a pre-condition for not referring the matter to the UN, Iran?s agreement to resume negotiations with the EU3 after Russia?s proposal to transfer its uranium enrichment programme to a facility there. Unfortunately, early in January, Iran unilaterally removed the seals put on by the IAEA on three of its nuclear facilities, making even Russia and China express their disapproval. 

 Given the circumstances, the UPA has to make up its mind about certain things. One, does it want an Iran with a nuclear arsenal? If not, what should be done to ensure that this does not happen? Has the US any right to ask India to support the reference to the UN security council without guaranteeing the implementation of the nuclear agreement it entered with this country on July 18, 2005? 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? So now everyone is ridiculing Iran for pointing out that countries like India are also into nuclear proliferation. Iran is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty like 180 other countries. India, Pakistan and Israel are not among them. One recent report mentioned an Indian politician saying that India is a responsible nation. Now if that is true, why hasn?t India signed the NPT as a responsible nation like Iran? Iran?s current prime minister is a belligerent man. But then the current US president is far ahead in these matters. Imperial domination of resources ? primarily oil ? is the real reason behind American belligerence. Iran and Syria are next on its hit list. Should India therefore cheer US or ask it to desist from playing the big brother?

 Yours faithfully,

Karen Garrett, Mumbai

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta in, ?Of faith and distrust? (Jan 13) would have done well to highlight the fact that the US has always been a fair-weather friend. Examples of American perfidy are galore ? Iran, Iraq, Latin America and so on. Washington?s game-plan is to charm its victim with goodies and then to betray it at an opportune moment. At the time of entering the White House, George W. Bush took a dim view of India, especially with regard to its nuclearization. Today he is all out to charm India. We must realize that Washington?s long-term intention is to utilize India in order to counter China?s growing influence in Eurasia. Therefore, New Delhi must not fall for the sweet talk by any of Uncle Sam?s emissaries, no matter how friendly they appear to be. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ??Bengal terracotta treasure fills stealth chest in West? (Jan 23) should be an eye opener for authorities in India, particularly in West Bengal. Enamul Haque?s crusade for priceless 3rd century terracotta figurines and plaques has showed up a pitiable aspect of artifact smuggling ? the authorities concerned in India officially have no information about these invaluable treasures nor are the people sensitive enough to give them their worth. All we do is gape at the terracotta in a Zurich or New York showcase, after having abandoned them at home. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

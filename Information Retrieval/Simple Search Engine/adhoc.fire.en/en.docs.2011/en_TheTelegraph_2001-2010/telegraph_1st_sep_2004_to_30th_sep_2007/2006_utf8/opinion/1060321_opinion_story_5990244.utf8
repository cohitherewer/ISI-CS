 HOW TO KILL THE MIND

 Malvika Singh

 Why has India neglected the education sector in such a manner? It is a mind-boggling question and no sensible answer can explain this absurd reality except reasons that would appear to be superficial and trivial ? reasons that do not merit mention, which is why the state has been able to get away with the murder of generations of minds. It is plain and simple exploitation of the state because it controls our lives. The rulers and their administrators have got used to calling the shots on everything on their own selfish terms and are not willing to let go, which is why India has wallowed in the poverty of education, information and learning. An unaccountable state is the worst enemy of the polity because it rules with a lazy, inept, uncompetitive, insular attitude and methodology. It commands and does not hear or listen. It is detrimental to the nurturing of the mind. It kills initiative and enterprise. 

 Since education is a state subject, government school teachers are not accountable to any superior intellectual authority. The ministers come and go as transient characters in search of personal political gains and the bureaucrats, also on stipulated terms, are mere file-pushing babus with no comprehension of learning needs and tools. With the opening up of this sector to private players, the statewallahs feel threatened by the possible disruption of their state-supported status quo. Who amongst them would want a demanding, questioning, thinking body of students? Why would they want to build a generation of thinking, reading, writing Indians, who would begin to call their bluff? With a dramatic rise in basic literacy skills, government officials would have to discard their present avatars and begin to do their job, something they have become unused to. The bureaucrat would have to be retrained.

 Wrong lessons

 We are all aware that in some states, state-employed school teachers are in fact card-holding party workers whose first priority is party work at the cost of their legitimate job. That in itself is wrong ? doing party work instead of teaching the children who are waiting in the school. It would inculcate wrong values in the child. Small wonder that India is as unruly as it is today. The other role these party-worker teachers play is manning polling booths at the time of elections. Nothing more needs to be said. Given the partisan political positions and alignments, all kinds of wrong practices become everyday truths. Those children in elementary schools are at an age when personalities are firmly entrenched. But these are years of supreme neglect by the state system. This must change and change radically. Learning must be endorsed not by words and mandates but by action, and parliament should make each member responsible for the schools, teachers and curricula in his/her constituency. Get them to do some real work and not look for cuts and commissions.

 We are creating generations of semi-morons who cannot get a job anywhere because they have been denied the right to learn properly. They have been made into robots who have been forced to stop using their mind. This is why those who could break loose went away from India to learn and live with dignity elsewhere. Why are governments determined to demean the vast majority of Indian citizens? Why is it all talk and crooked action? Why cannot party leaders whip members into delivering the goods where they were elected from? And why is there this over-reaction when the private player wants to enter the playing field? Why this supreme insecurity, this inability to take on the best and brightest? Are the men and women who make up the state apparatus convinced that they are incapable and have to keep all others out to protect themselves and their office? A telling commentary on the failure of the state in this critical area 59 years after independence.

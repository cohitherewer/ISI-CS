 ERODING DAM OF PATIENCE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Every crisis in India is followed by the instituting of a ?panel? comprising retired men and women who once served in government and failed to raise India out of the quagmire to look into the matter. It is a shame that the administration just does not do its job and the political class does not make its human machinery accountable. This reality has assumed the proportions of a tragic farce. Is it not possible for the prime minister to order that the compensation for those displaced by the Narmada dam be given in a timebound frame? Does it require a further waste of time and more resources to be spent by a ?panel? that will yet again cause delay? This old-fashioned manner of ?governance? ? of passing the buck, of not being able to take hard decisions, of pretending to be ?democratic? when having to stick the neck out and solve unpleasant issues will evoke criticism from some, of wanting to please all at the cost not moving forward ? has nurtured anarchy.

 And if the political leadership is in a time-warp, working in a system that has no place in modern societies, then why does it not do what leaders in the past did ? travel to the areas that will be submerged, talk to those who have been and will be affected to give them a a feeling of confidence? The leadership of today, with the exception of Sonia Gandhi, appears totally disconnected with troubled, struggling India. They have time for Davos, but no time for those who have been evicted from their homes, who have been denied dignity. When elections are announced, this same class will hand out sops, shamelessly, without embarrassment, only to woo the downtrodden because they intrinsically do not respect the poor. They treat them as untouchables. That is the harsh truth.

 Armed in disgust

 Instead of doing their jobs honestly and with integrity, a majority of ?administrators? spend their working hours lobbying for plum postings, neglecting their work. Their bosses, the top honchos in government, have unlearnt how to ?manage? and compel their tribe to deliver within the norms and framework of a civil society. The corrosion and disintegration of the steel frame portends disaster of unimaginable magnitude. Maybe the sheer enormity of the sickness forces fresh incumbents to turn away from this frightening reality because they do not want to admit the truth. They rapidly fall into the rut, live off the rot, close their eyes, ears and minds, living as they do, locked behind ?security?, vegetating, as they apply all the easy and failed options on this vibrant, young, betrayed society. They continue to belittle the possible renewal.

 This intellectual and physical lethargy has wreaked havoc in India. Murderers get away, hoodlums strut about exuding confidence, illegalities abound, bribery is the licence that permits you to work and function, rules and norms are thrown to the winds, honesty is spat upon, correctness is mocked, decency is punished. The prime minister and many in his cabinet are intelligent, honourable men and women, but where has their intelligence got buried? How have they fallen into this dreadful, all encompassing mire? Do they not feel any pangs of guilt? Are they not appalled by the complete lack of integrity around them?

 Can the rulers of India not see the writing on the wall? Are they not aware that nearly 30 per cent of India is involved in armed protest, intending to get their due at the point of a gun? Can our leadership not see how the ?public? is forcing many social issues, demanding justice? Can they not see that their days of exploitation are now numbered? Are the politicians and bureaucrats in the throes of a galloping cancer called denial?

 Will the Maoists force the issue? Will the fraying patience of the people of India change into militant combat? Will India be destabilized just when it is taking off economically?

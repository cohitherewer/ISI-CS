 SAY HELLO TO INDIAS FIRST WIREFREE CITY

 Mysore Palace

When Shankar Prasad decided to provide wireless Internet 

access to his customers, he had no clue that he had a path-breaking plan at hand. 

I was just solving the infrastructure problems of my cable Internet company, 

says the chief operating officer (COO) of the Mysore-based Internet Service Provider 

(ISP) firm Wifiynet. 

In 2004, Mysore became the first wi-fi-enabled city 

in India. Wifiynet installed three towers across the city which provide wireless 

Internet throughout the city. The company has also readied a pilot project for 

providing wi-fi services up to Kushalnagar, situated 108 km from Mysore. Wi-fi 

services in rural areas will assist in e-governance, says Prasad. 

Three years ago, Shankar Prasad who ran a cable 

television business in Mysore decided to provide Internet services to better 

his bottom line. But with cable Internet, I got into a last mile issue, 

recalls Prasad. Cables snapped, the Internet wouldnt connect and when it 

rained, the equipment often went bust. 

 Thats when Prasad joined forces with G. Saravanan, a dealer for Yaesu Communications, a Japanese wireless technology provider. The duo decided to provide wireless Internet connectivity across Mysore town which lies within a radius of seven km. 

 The timing was just right. The 802.11 b standard or wi-fi technology was gaining currency. The Indian government had recently made 2.4 gigahertz a free-use band. Things fell into place like a jigsaw. 

 Wifiynet now rechristened Aeroway opened operations in 2004, with one tower in Mysores Jayalaxmipuram area and 10 customers. Each end-user had a Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) an antenna-like devise attached to their laptop or PC. They could access the Internet in any street, caf or park bench in the colony. Aeroway charges Rs 4,000 to install the CPE. After this, customers have unlimited Internet access for Rs 750 a month. 

 Within six months, the company had three towers one atop Chamundi Hills providing wi-fi-enabled Internet access across Mysore. Except for three dark spots, Mysore is now fully wi-fi enabled, claims Saravanan. At present, the company has 150 customers. The company has not broken even as yet. We will need about 350 connections to break even, says G. Saravanan, chief technical officer (CTO), Aeroway. Says Shiva Kumar, an Aeroway customer whos been using the wi-fi services since the end of 2004, There were a lot of initial ups and downs like installation problems and breakdowns. But these have been ironed out. 

 This Dasara, Mysores regally-dressed elephants wont be hogging all the limelight. Wi-fi will be flaunted as Mysores big achievement. Tourists will be allowed wireless Internet access in Mysore Place and Chamundi Hills, says Prasad.

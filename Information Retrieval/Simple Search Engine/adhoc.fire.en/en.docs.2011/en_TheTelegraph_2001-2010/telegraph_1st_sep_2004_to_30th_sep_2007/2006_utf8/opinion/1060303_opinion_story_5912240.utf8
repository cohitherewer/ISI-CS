 History?s speaking tongues

 Partitions (Penguin, Rs 350) by Kamleshwar is Ameena Kazi Ansari?s excellent translation of the outstanding Hindi novel, Kitne Pakistan (2000). Born in 1932, Kamleshwar has been a journalist, and a scriptwriter for cinema (Aandhi, Mausam, Choti Si Baat, Mr Natwarlal) and television (Betaal). He has made documentary films on terrorisim in Kashmir, the Babri Masjid dispute and the suicide of the three sisters in Kanpur. This novel grew in the interstices of this work from 1990 onwards: ?Kitne Pakistan was intermittently written in the midst of these stories, articles, fictionalized histories and other impediments. From this variety of compositions, I was able to enhance my creative skills and learn the art of controlled expression?. Kamleshwar?s protagonists are none other than Time, and a sort of Everyman figure, a nameless adeeb or litt?rateur, creating between them an epic rendering of history, from a multiplicity of perspectives ? a people?s history of ?injustice, oppression and dislocation of various kinds?: ?He came from a desolate land, a world of silent allure, where nothing was ever said, aspirations tossed and turned within the mind, yearnings surfaced only to be eclisped, and dreams were gathered and taken away like garments from the clothes line at dusk. Obscure, discrete reflections often remained entangled in memories, neither crystallizing nor fading into oblivion. These thoughts left their imprint on the fabric of life in uneven patterns.? A rich and important modern work.

 Anthems of resistance: a celebration of progressive Urdu Poetry (IndiaInk amp; Roli, Rs 295) by Raza Mir and Ali Husain Mir is anthology, literary criticism, history and political project in one. It is two Urdu scholars? tribute to the Urdu poets of the Progressive Writers? Movement. ?Josh Malihabadi, Sahir Ludhianvi, Israr-ul-Haq Majaz, Kaifi Azmi, Ali Sardar Jafri. Faiz Ahmad Faiz, Majrooh Sultanpuri, and Makhdoom Mohiuddin were household names and we learnt to appreciate the spirit of their powerful verses. Their poetry ? critical, insightful, angry, passionate ? helped inculcate in us a sense of social justice, mediated our understanding of reality, and offered us a framework to interpret social and political conditions.? A line from Faiz?s ?Lahu Ka Suraagh? ? ?Nowhere, nowhere at all, is any trace of Blood? ? haunts this book, ?which grows out of a desire to reverse this ?wilful loss of memory? and to reclaim the legacy of the progressive poets in an age when their words, insights, and politics continue to be relevant.?

 The story of english in India (Foundation, Rs 150) by N. Krishnaswamy and Lalitha Krishnaswamy is a useful and concise account of how English became another Indian language. Its historical sweep, organized into short chapters with unpretentious headings, spans colonialism and globalization, and includes interesting reflections on the sociology of language in contemporary India. The appendix reprints key texts on the issue by Rammohun Roy, Macaulay, and extracts from, and a list of, important modern reports. 

 Jaipurnama: tales from the Pink city (Penguin, Rs 295) by Giles Tillotson is evocative history-writing, based on research and scolarship, but written primarily to piece together the complex stories that mesh together the peculiar life of this popular but enigmatic city. These are seen through the eyes of residents as well as visitors who witnessed and recorded different moments in the city?s history between the 18th and the 20th centuries.

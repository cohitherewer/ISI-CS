 THE LADY VANISHES

 Rajashri Dasgupta discusses how and why women still die during childbirth in India

 Fazila Bibi, from a remote West 

 Bengal village, defied tradition last month. She decided 

 to give birth in a hospital and not in her home. She had 

 been persuaded that institutional delivery in a clean environment 

 with emergency services, promoted by the government to reduce 

 maternal deaths, would ensure a safe delivery, which might 

 not be the case with a dai at home. The wife of a 

 peasant put her life at risk to travel in labour for 20 

 kilometres through fields and over dirt roads to the hospital. 

 But at the Behrampur Sadar Hospital in Murshidabad district, 

 the 22-year-old received a rude shock: she was forced to 

 give birth under a tree on the hospital premises in public 

 view, because her family was too poor to pay a bribe for 

 her admission to the hospital.

 If Fazila Bibi has been lucky 

 to escape with her life and that of her infant, other women 

 are not so fortunate. Maternal deaths have emerged as one 

 of the most daunting public health problems in India. Every 

 five minutes, one woman dies from complications related 

 to pregnancy and childbirth. In fact 25 per cent of the 

 500,000 maternal deaths in the world are from India, the 

 highest burden for any single country. According to a World 

 Health Organization official, the number of untimely deaths 

 can shoot up in the next 10 years if the government does 

 not act now. 

 India is a signatory to the United 

 Nations Millennium Development Goals and has resolved to 

 cut back maternal deaths by three-quarters by 2015. Other 

 policies like the national rural health mission a favourite 

 programme of the current Central government and the 2000 

 national population policy pledged to reduce maternal deaths 

 by more than half in the next few years. Since more than 

 50 per cent of the childbirths take place at home with the 

 aid of dais in villages, sometimes leading to complications 

 and even death, the government strategy is to promote and 

 advocate institutional delivery and delivery by trained 

 attendants.

 But doctors say that the kind 

 of treatment Fazila Bibi received in Behrampur Hospital, 

 for instance, can have an adverse effect and discourage 

 women from going to public hospitals. Healthcare experts 

 have identified, among other factors, the delay that occurs 

 in hospitals and health centres as deterrents. Health personnel 

 appear to be apathetic, and treatment is delayed, essential 

 drugs and equipment are often lacking. This can prove fatal 

 to pregnant women. A few years ago, in a well-known city 

 hospital, a pregnant girl from a nearby district bled to 

 death because the hospital blood bank had closed for the 

 day, the ward phone was out of order, the ambulance had 

 broken down and was unable to transfer the girl elsewhere.

 One would assume conditions would 

 be more sensitive to women in West Bengal. The state has 

 witnessed radical land reforms and has a stable left government. 

 In the decentralized loc- al governments, wom-en monopolize 

 more than 33 per cent of the seats. Moreover, the state 

 domestic pro-duct has grown faster than the national average. 

 During the 10 years ending in 2003, the SDP (constant prices) 

 expanded by 7.11 per cent per annum. But the overall health 

 of the people has neither improved with the regions economic 

 growth and political stability, nor is the majority of the 

 states women particularly healthy. 

 The health report card of women 

 in the state is among the most dismal in the country. There 

 is a high prevalence of anaemia: almost 63 per cent of women 

 suffer from it in some form. The body-mass index of women 

 in the state is among the lowest in the country, and the 

 calorie intake of young girls, pregnant women and lactating 

 mothers falls short by at least 500 calories. 

 With womens general health in 

 such a poor condition, it is not surprising that maternal 

 deaths have risen in the state. In 2005, more than 1,800 

 mothers died because of pregnancy-related complications. 

 This is an underestimated figure, says S. Mukherjee, the 

 president of the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological 

 Society of India. Since more than half the childbirths take 

 place at home, deaths of women remain unre- ported.

 The best index of a functioning 

 health system in a country is said to be the state of maternal 

 health services. But the public health delivery system lacks 

 infrastructure, health personnel and basic equipment for 

 maternal services. Even labour rooms, equipment to take 

 blood pressure and weight, and basic facilities, such as 

 toilets and drinking water, are absent in many health centres. 

 In the absence of these, the rural population was deprived 

 of basic minimum healthcare servicesto pregnant women and 

 ante-natal care of mothers, states the latest comptroller 

 and auditor general report.

 The health problems of pregnant 

 women and mothers in the state are exacerbated by a failing 

 and under-funded public health sector. Funds do not reflect 

 the intention of the policies to reduce maternal deaths. 

 The budget allocation for family welfare, in which mother-and-child 

 care is included, has been stagnant since the late Nineties. 

 Of the total outlay of about Rs 150 crore for family welfare, 

 maternal and child health receives less than one per cent; 

 family planning and fertility control absorb the bulk of 

 the resources.

 In spite of numerous policy decisions 

 and resolutions, one of the reasons that maternal deaths 

 in the country remain so high is because the security and 

 health of women have never been central to the programmes. 

 The control of womens sexuality and their reproductive 

 role has been the concern of policymakers in the last few 

 decades. This has led to Family Planning Programmes dominating 

 health and the direction of health policy. As a result there 

 are huge budget allocations for FPP, draining scarce resources 

 from the health sector, said Mohan Rao, professor, Centre 

 of Social Medicine and Community Health, Jawaharlal Nehru 

 University, New Delhi. 

 Since the mid-Seventies, abortion 

 was made a possible strategy for family planning. The post-partum 

 programme introduced for lactating mothers led to women 

 being forced to accept sterilization or intra-uterine devices 

 for birth control. In a similar vein, coercive family-planning 

 targets, incentives, disincentives and hazardous long-acting 

 contraceptives for women were introduced. The services 

 developed in the name of maternity care in fact benefits 

 FPP more than women themselves, said Rao.

 If women are to enjoy health and 

 safe motherhood, they must have access to employment opportunities 

 and fair wages. The links with poverty and malnutrition 

 are well established. What needs emphasis is that poverty 

 generates unhealthy living conditions, which damage health 

 and make pregnancy unsafe. In West Bengal, the marginalization 

 of female labour and gender-stereotyping go hand in hand. 

 Women workers in self-employed activities tend to be crowded 

 into sectors that are less remunerative and involve greater 

 drudgery. 

 A narrow focus on institutional 

 delivery for safe motherhood, instead of providing basic 

 nutrition, employment and healthcare, is not a solution 

 for redu- cing maternal deaths it is part of the problem. 

 The improved health status of women in the state is a precondition 

 for sustained economic growth. It can no longer be ignored.

 India has reduced crude birth rate from 40.8 (1951) 

 to 26.4 (1998); halved the infant mortality rate from 

 146 per 1,000 live births (1951) to 72 per 1,000 live 

 births (1998)

 As per census 1991-2001, Indias sex ratio is 

 now 933 women for 1,000 men, worse than Pakistan and Bangladesh

 July, 2006: The Haryana health minister, Kartar Devi, 

 stated that around 5 crore female foetuses were terminated 

 in the country last year

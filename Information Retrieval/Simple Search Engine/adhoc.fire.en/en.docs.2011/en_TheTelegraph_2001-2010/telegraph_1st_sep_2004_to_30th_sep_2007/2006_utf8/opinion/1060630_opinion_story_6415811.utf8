 INSIDE COLOUR

 - Sex, hunger, loneliness and fear

 The Red Room

 Red 

 By Irwin Allan Sealy 

 Picador, ?16.99

 ?Matisse paintings?, writes A.S. Byatt, are ?about power. And about sex, hunger, loneliness, and fear?. It is likely that Irwin Allan Sealy would agree. Red is presided over by two of Henri Matisse?s paintings, The Painter?s Family, and The Red Room (also called Harmony in Red). Sealy calls Matisse the patron saint of his book, the thread in a work of scant linear correlation.

 The Painter?s Family is how Matisse makes art out of ?a beautiful problem? ? his daughter born out of wedlock. Marguerite ? the painter?s daughter with the shop-girl, Caroline Joblaud (the subject of The Red Room) ? stands, if somewhat awkwardly, in the picture in which Matisse?s wife is sewing and his two sons are playing draughts. As in the picture, so in life, and vice versa. From life, Matisse had learnt that by putting its tensions into the painting, ?he can demolish distance and free time and set every last brown spot dancing.?

 In the world of mimetic art, reality is a problem ? like the drop of ink which fell from the artist?s pen on to his portrait of the queen and invited the wrath of the king. How could the artist know about the mole on his wife?s inner thigh? Art and life have difficult intersections. What does art do with characters from the artist?s own life? Is the relationship one of simple representation, or is it as uncomfortable as Marguerite?s poise in The Painter?s Family? And can representation remain unaffected by the feelings of impatience, jealousy, guilt, pain, uncertainty, loss, and also love?

 Red is written in the form of an abecedary. Letters of the alphabet are linked to words, and words to people, places and stories, to make the novel a lexicon of impressions. Zach Wilding (?Zaccheus, not Zachariah?) meets Aline Medlar (?Aline. Not Aileen.?) in the Matisse room at the Hermitage in St Petersburg. Aline fascinates Zach, but also makes him impatient with her stubborn lingering in front of The Red Room. The narrator, N, is a writer and Zach?s friend, who lives in a small town in the Himalayan foothills ? D for Dariya Dun. With Olivia Gutierrez, of yOGabydancing.com and New York, N has a daughter, Mandalay or Manda. Manda comes to Dariya Dun, as do Zach and Aline. In the sleepy little town there are also the Blackshorts, Phuljari, Nag, Gilgitan, Chhanga and other creatures from the fringes, whose lives, loves and anxieties provide a parallel to those of N and Zach and Aline.

 But as in Matisse, the woman must be foregrounded and studied: ?Neglect her at your own peril, attend to her and you?re lost.? Zach pays the price of neglect. First, Aline gets into Zach?s cyber-mailbox, and gets the taste of a forbidden epistolary novel, and then, in Dariya Dun, the tiler?s assistant becomes her lover, although she seems to flit between reverie and lucidity through the episode. The worldwide web can detect a small drop in temperature, but cannot erase physical distances. What had begun as a ritual of abolishing the distance between Russia, US and India falters within a few scores of square miles of Dariya Dun. Zach receives via email the farewell note, ?Access denied, username invalid?.

 N attempts to befriend the daughter he has never seen or had a chance to know, but soon realizes that he cannot hope to have access to the depths and crevices of her teenage mind which hide love-aches and death-pangs. Manda becomes Marguerite as N wonders what goes through the head of his child who is no longer a child ? ?love or pain? Or love and pain? Or the love of pain?? Not knowing whether he should wait at his daughter?s door, he goes away and dreams of her mother, although he never does manage to see her face in the dream. Not Matisse?s red, but Van Gogh?s red-black is the colour of anguish.

 The women in Byatt?s ?Matisse Stories? are preoccupied with physical ageing. But they are practical, a-romantic, unexoticized creatures ? even the anorexic art student in ?The Chinese Lobster?. None of the mystery and aura of Matisse?s women is carried over to Byatt?s. Sealy?s women, even the pig-girl Gilgitan is in love with, are all exotic in their own way, but the questions they raise are again connected with the process of artistic creation: ?Do you meet the same woman again and again or different women in the same guise? Do you write the same book over and over??

 The Red Room was not always red, but was also tried in blue. (It did not work.) And Caroline Joblaud?s light hair, too, was coloured black so as not to cause affront to Mrs Matisse of the jet black tresses. That is ?the habit of love, old love become custody?. Ditto for N and Olivia. But life, unlike art, does not let you live a moment twice. But the lived moment is an amalgam of instincts and impulses, some true, some not so true. Like the precise spot Matisse would mark out with a ribbon to mark where his easel stood, there is just a single original impulse. Like the first layer of colour whose quest drove Red Medlar to slash up The Red Room at the Hermitage. The web carries the news to Zach.

 Red is a colour of the mind whose shades range from passion to desire to jealousy to anger to hurt. Dark red is how Aline feels when she craves Zach?s attention but is also distracted by the tiler?s assistant. The optical mouse glows red, pain is red. Mrs Matisse suspected that red did not become her. Red is the colour of violation when Matisse paints Satyr Approaching Sleeping Nymph, but not when Picasso paints the same subject. Picasso thought it impossible to remove a spot of red from a Matisse ?without the picture instantly collapsing?. For Sealy, the thin red line ?kept me here not boxed no fear/ so I might drink sun crack open pomegranate eat rubies?. Red is also ?lastly sad lingerie lust small grist for novelist?. Red is a colour that becomes Sealy.

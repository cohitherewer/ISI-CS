 HOW TO SELL A WHISKY

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Contrary to predictions, globalization has been unable to limit the role of religion in the modern world

 Goddess Durga selling whisky? Silvio Berlusconi, the suffering Christ of Kalyug? An ongoing trial in Viterbo, Italy to prove the existence of Jesus? Do they sound outlandish? Trust me, all this is true. 

 Jyllands-Posten has managed to hog international limelight by toying with blasphemy. Others are following suit. Karl Marx?s assertion about religion sounds redundant today. The significance of religion to the post-modern world has been heightened by the identification of people with ethnicities. The first wave modernization theory?s speculation that globalization would end parochial identification with ethnic groups now stands discredited. The rigid identification of the first and even second generation diasporas with their traditions, in spite of their exposure to a different culture, is a case in point. Ethno-political conflicts are also at an all-time high. 

 So Hindus find it extremely offensive to see posters of Durga carrying a bottle of whisky at the Balon Oriental disco bar in Athens or the images of Ganesha on designer shoes and commode seats. The cartoon image of the Prophet is blasphemous for Muslims.

 In the Indian scenario, the Bharatiya Janata Party plank has always been Hindutva. In Italy, the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, finds it important to compare himself with Christ just before the general elections, thereby strategically positioning himself on the right against the centre-left Romano Prodi. 

 In this backdrop, look at the apocalyptic trial in Italy which is supposed to decide, once and for all, if Christ was a historical figure. A former priest-turned-militant atheist and the author of The Fable of Christ, Luigi Cascioli has filed a petition against a Enrico Righi, the Catholic parish priest in Bagnoregio, for ?abusing popular credulity? for teaching and spreading the gospel. Cascioli?s allegation is that the church is misleading people as there is no reliable basis, apart from the Gospel, to believe that Jesus Christ existed. 

 Whatever the merits of his case, it has the potential to strike a serious blow to Christianity. And it can simultaneously throw Berlusconi?s campaign off the track. If Christ did not exist, then Berlusconi?s ?suffering? is definitely more mortal in nature. But it is a pointer to the kind of passion that can be generated by religious matters, particularly in the media. More curiously, one is surprised at the force of intolerance, not only the sole weapon of the believer, but also that of the non-believer. 

 Contrary to the first wave modernization theory then, globalization has led to greater intolerance instead of greater inter-religion cohesion. Which is why a cartoon of the Prophet in a small publication can incite global violence, or a poster in Greece can galvanize Hindus in Britain. However, this is also why a new whisky can sell well, or Berlusconi can risk portraying himself as the Christ of politics and boost his campaign. 

 So no matter how much the atheists cry themselves hoarse at the irrelevance of religion, religion still sells like hot cake, as its clientele has now reached unimaginable proportions post- globalization. The media can either love it (Aastha and other godly channels) or attack it, but contrary to Nietzsche?s belief that rationalism and science has killed god, religion remains very much alive.

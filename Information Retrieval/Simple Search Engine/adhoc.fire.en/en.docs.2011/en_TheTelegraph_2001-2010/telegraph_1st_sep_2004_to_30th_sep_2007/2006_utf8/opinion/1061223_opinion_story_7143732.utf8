 Letters to Editor

 On a long holiday

 Sir Last Sunday, I visited the Victoria Memorial Hall musuem, where the entry fee for Indians is Rs 10 and for foreigners, Rs 150. This fee is meant for the maintenance of the place. However, there were dry leaves and dirt all around. Stray dogs were strolling within the museum premises. The bronze statue of Queen Victoria is in an awful condition. It has lost its shine and is smeared with bird droppings. There were graffiti on the walls as well. Victoria Memorial is supposed to be a heritage site. It is shameful that this is how we are taking care of it.

 Yours faithfully,

 A single world view

 Sir Mukul Kesavan is right in suggesting that Indians should not be hypocrites (View of the world, Dec 14). They should not laud traits in other countries which they do not value in their own. In spite of the setbacks and shortcomings in our system, Indian democracy is working. In fact, it works better than the system in most other countries. However, India, unlike the Western democracies, have never tried to impose its system on any other country. The United States of America and the United Kingdom not only do that, but go to any limits to achieve that. For example, instead of invading the erstwhile Soviet Union, they took advantage of the mistakes made by its leaders to hasten its disintegration. They did not feel the same hesitance in the case of Afghanistan or Iraq though. The strategic advantages and the mineral resources were enough to lure them into a direct attack. The ostensible reason, however, was to bring development to these countries. 

 And yet, there is hardly true equality or democracy in either the UK or the US. In the UK, for example, people of Asian and African origins are often targets of violence. Successive natural disasters have revealed the sub-human conditions in which the blacks live in the US. None of these however discourages the rulers of these two countries to champion the cause of democracy in other parts of the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Mukul Kesavans How pluralism goes bad (Dec 7), brought to mind the fact that since independence, Indias administrators have totally ignored Chanakyas axiom in the Arthashastra. In trans-border relations, Kautilya believed, there are no permanent friends or permanent enemies or even permanent borders. There are only permanent interests and everything must be done to secure these interests for the benefit of the nation. 

 Unfortunately, any issue concerning our borders has invariably been linked with vote bank politics. It is this attitude that has complicated matters in Kashmir. Jawaharlal Nehru made a crucial mistake by ordering ceasefire during the 1947-48 conflict. Subsequently, this line has acted as the de facto border between India and Pakistan. The objective of almost all governments in New Delhi has been to uphold this status quo, although this has never been to the nations interests. Now, India might as well declare the line of contorl to be the de jure border. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir There should not be any double standards where nationalist and religious questions are concerned. Mukul Kesavan has rightly pointed out that different yardsticks are used by people to assess different situations in different countries or groups. Once we acknowledge the need for a single yardstick to judge situations that are borne out of political or religious causes all over the world, many of our dilemmas will be sorted. This will also pave the way for a better harmonized pluralistic society. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Amitabh Thakur, Lucknow

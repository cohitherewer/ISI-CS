 LOOK AHEAD

 Unlike the budget, which projects the government?s finances over the next year, the Economic Survey is a review of how the economy fared in the past financial year. It is therefore rightly backward-looking; and the present moment happens to be a good one for looking back. For the economy is likely to grow by 8.1 per cent this year. Annual inflation rate in wholesale prices is only 4.1 per cent; and 40 per cent of it is on account of imported increases in fuel prices. Productive investment, reflected in the production and imports of capital equipment, is booming. Capital inflows in the first half of the financial year more than covered the current account deficit. Altogether, the year was excellent till a month ago, when the Economic Survey was put to sleep. 

 But the Survey is somewhat nonchalant about the growing payments deficit. The only argument it offers is that the flood of imports may find its way into exports and lead to an export boom in the coming months. This is not so much hope as wishful thinking, and not so much an argument as lazy thinking. The current account went from a surplus of $14.1 billion in 2003-04 to a deficit of $5.4 billion last year. This year may end up with a deficit of $25 billion, if the first six months are any guide. If the trend continues, the coming financial year may see a deficit of $50-60 billion. It is optimistic, to put it mildly, to expect that investors abroad will pour in that much. Foreign direct investment has been going down since its peak of $4.7 billion in 2001-02; so the gap must be filled by portfolio investment. If it does not, exchange reserves will decline. They look comfortable now. But their direction of change is more important than their level. They have fallen by $2 billion in this financial year; if they were to fall suddenly by $10-20 billion, investors could take fright, and capital would take flight.

 The Survey is at pains to point out that most of India?s capital imports are ?non-debt-creating?. The implication is that their reversal will not cause a balance of payments crisis. But instead, it will cause a crisis in the capital market. The Survey?s lack of concern is worrying enough, but it would be far more worrying if its complacency were seen to be shared by policy-makers. Policy measures are called for to correct the rapidly worsening BoP. Amongst them, tariffs would be the wrong instrument to use. So those in authority must concentrate on three primary instruments ? fiscal balance, the exchange rate and interest rates. Today?s budget will reveal how far the finance minister has been able to reduce fiscal deficit; however bold he may prove to have been, the use of the other two instruments will be unavoidable, and urgent.

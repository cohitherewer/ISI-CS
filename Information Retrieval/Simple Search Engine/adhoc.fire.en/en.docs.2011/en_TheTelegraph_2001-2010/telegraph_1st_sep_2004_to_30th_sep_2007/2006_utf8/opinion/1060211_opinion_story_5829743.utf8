The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SHARKS, DOLPHINS AND JOY

 Governance has often been a visionary affair for the chief minister of West Bengal. And his visions for Calcutta have been especially grand. If the airport happens to be on strike and overflowing with filth, the grounded tourist will soon be able to while away his time playing with state-of-the-art dolphins and turtles in the city. This is the latest dream ? an ?aggressively cheerful? underground aquarium in Rajarhat New Town, built by Singaporeans and costing Rs 500 crore. Calcuttans should have got used to such immortal imaginings by now. But the obscenity of this particular plan might knock down the less visionary citizen this time. The scale of the thing is Wagnerian. Atlantis and Noah?s Ark, stone, steel, glass, six million litres of salt water, 300 acres of land, 3,000 specimens of fish (including 250 sharks), 600 kinds of plants and coral reefs, birds and animals ? when a simple zoo, one of the most famous in India, is now in a state of pathetic decrepitude through mismanagement and neglect. And all this to ?put Bengal into an international league of tourist destinations?. 

 It is tempting to dismiss with a titter such a combination of wastefulness and tackiness trying to pass itself off as the development of tourism. But coming so unabashedly from none less than the chief minister himself, the matter becomes one of profound concern ? both the project itself, and what it says about the nature of governance in West Bengal. How exactly are decisions made, contracts signed and such enormous sums of money spent in this state and in this hapless city?

 A city becomes a tourist attraction because of the over-all experience it has to offer a visitor. This is as much a matter of heritage and history (and how these are preserved and projected), as one of practical and civic amenities at the most basic level. Such things as airports, railway stations, public transport, roads, hospitals, toilets, trees, parks and rivers are most often what memorable visits are made up of, apart from museums, galleries, theatres, cinemas, restaurants, shops and, more generally, beautiful architecture. Beauty and convenience must coexist with a sense of safety and well-being. Clean air and friendly, efficient policemen make a great deal of difference, for instance, as do proper facilities for the disabled, easy access to information and minimal bureaucracy. Intelligent, down-to-earth and meticulous planning, constantly monitored and accountable, is therefore essential for anything that aspires to call itself the development of tourism.

 Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s marine extravaganza is an evidence of cluelessness on all these fronts. It shows a lack of a sense of priorities, and therefore, of basic human scruple, that is perhaps more breathtaking than the submarine vistas with which it attempts to beguile ordinary Calcuttans and tourists.

 SPINNER TAKES ALL

 Aggressive and accurate, Shane Warne is the perfect leg-spinner cricket could have ever had

 Some 15 years ago, on a January morning in 1992, 22-year-old Shane Keith Warne walked out onto the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) sporting the Australian Baggy Green for the first time. The chubby youth, otherwise anonymous as a debutante in Test cricket, took a solitary wicket in return for 150 runs in that match against India. Frankly, it wasnt a feat that made the world sit up and take notice. 

 Yet, on Tuesday, when the last Test of the 2006-07 Ashes series between England and Australia gets underway, the cricketing world would remain glued to the television as Warne takes to the field for one last time. And its more than mere coincidence that it would be the same SCG where the 37-year-old spinner would take his last bow from the game. For in many ways, a great sporting career would be coming full circle, on the turf thats considered by many as one of the veritable Meccas of world cricket. 

 In the one-and-a-half decades that Warne has spent wristing out those lethal leg breaks mixed with the not-so-readable wrong uns, as some of his deliveries were called several men have come and gone, putting their skills to test in the game gentlemen play. And though Warne, in many ways, has been far from a gentleman, none have managed to get as far as the man from the state of Victoria, who scalped his 700th Test cricket victim last week, and then went on to add a few more to his tally that currently stands as the highest Test wicket haul in the world. 

 Naturally, accolades have come his way. Right arm spin bowling is an art that is extremely difficult to persevere, let alone perfect, says legendary former Indian spinner Bishen Singh Bedi. Over the years, Warne has managed to do just that. He is aggressive, he is accurate, and above all, he is the perfect leg-spinner cricket could have ever had. 

 Unlike several other greats of the game who have played out their careers with honour and dignity, Warnes sojourn has been fraught with scandal, controversy and the occasional fall from grace. Yet, on the other hand, his recognition as a master of the game remains unchallenged he was voted Wisden Cricketer of 1994, the one-day player of 2000, Test player of the current year, apart from figuring among the top five Wisden cricketers of the century. Somewhere down the line, the honours he accumulated worked to salvage much of his reputation that came undone, often a result of his own doing. At the end, however, its only the sweet aftertaste that lingers in the mouth. 

 Some cricket fans remember him for that one ball he sent down to Mike Gatting in 1993, that turned around the unsuspecting English batsmans leg like it had rebounded off an invisible wall to rattle his off stump. Statisticians mark out a special niche for him as not only the highest taker of Test wickets, but also for getting a Man-of-the-Match award in a World Cup final and for scoring the highest number of runs in Test cricket without managing to get a century. 

 The lawkeepers of the game single him out for his connections with bookmakers he admitted in 1998 that he and Mark Waugh had leaked pitch information to punters before the start of a match and for testing positive for a banned diuretic barely days before the beginning of the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, and being subsequently banned from the game for a year. Moral guardians, on the other hand, would snigger at him for his amorous escapades, an incident involving the text messages he allegedly sent a South African woman, and the notorious photographs of his standing scantily clad next to a pair of nubile female models. When he separated from his wife Simone in mid-2005, most critics thought he deserved it, and few admirers went the distance of justifying the break-up as a consequence of occasional waywardness that greatness often came packaged with. 

 Through it all, however, one thing if one were to discount his performance remained constant. The spinner who says he would still honour his two-year contract with English County side Hampshire despite calling it a day in international cricket never failed to make the headlines, for reasons good, bad or ugly. Its the one thing that has kept him in public memory through his career. 

 He is the perfect showman cricket has ever had, says cricket writer and scholar Boria Mazumdar. Hes been both a devil and an icon, and has turned even the worst of situations into making headlines in his favour. The media has been as dependent on him as he has been on the media, and at the end of the day, he has emerged as crickets greatest brand. 

 Add to that his fondness for cars he has owned a fleet of Ferrari Spiders, Mercedes and BMWs in the past and still drives a BMW or his flirtation with controversial endorsements he was once caught smoking in press photographs while endorsing a product that helped people kick cigarettes and the end product happens to be nothing short of stardom. And its something Warne has naturally come to make his own. 

 On Saturday, after the hurly burlys done, and the battle lost or won, Warne shall make his exit from cricket in a blaze of glory. An era will have come to an end; another will begin. In a few years time, it would spew forth a new star, who would rise from the ashes to seize the day as Warne had so convincingly done yet again. Presumably, the wizard himself would then be sitting in the commentary box its a profession he admitted to be looking forward to watching his records go with quiet unease. We wonder what he would be saying into the microphone then. And we hope hed have got over his wrong uns by then.

 Traditional British food, associated as it is with Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and oily fish and chips wrapped in last weeks Sun, does not quite water the taste buds of the food-lover. This mouth-watering compilation by Laura Mason and Catherine Brown dispels many of the accepted ideas about British food being stodgy and bland. It is a celebration of the varieties of the taste of Britain.

 The emphasis in this book is on the regional varieties of British food. The underlying argument is that the food available in supermarkets and ordinary restaurants, by standardizing British food, is reducing it to mediocrity. As a result, British food is never quite placed on the same table with French or Italian food. The authors demonstrate with well-chosen recipes from the various regions of Britain that British food has a variety of flavours and tastes. The description of every dish is very precisely and lucidly written. There is also a small history of the particular recipe. The authors aver to their readers that each of these recipes is alive and can be tasted only if one knows where to look for them. This is by no means an antiquarians handbook.

 One important reason, as the authors correctly point out, behind the fact that these recipes remain a part of peoples every day lives in the various regions is the fact that these dishes are part of the lives of communities. Many of the recipes have been handed down through generations within a family. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who contributes an evocative foreword to the book, narrates how he was treated to his first proper Yorkshire curd tart. This tarts filling is made from colostrum, the very rich milk produced by a cow for her new-born calf. It was baked for him by a farmers wife in her own kitchen, using the method passed down to her through her family. Fearnley-Whittingstall found it absolutely delicious very rich, curdy and slightly crumbly having a hint of cakiness without the flouriness.

 One of the great delights of British food is the variety of cheeses that are available. The cheeses are so different in taste and flavour that it is difficult to believe that they are all made from two basic ingredients milk and something that will make milk curdle. The latter varies from the usual rennet to more unusual coagulants, like nettle juice. Some of the cheeses carry signs of their local origins. Stilton, according to many the Rolls Royce of British cheeses, is produced in a handful of dairies in the Midlands. It is named after the place where it was sold, the Bell Inn in Stilton, Huntingdonshire, and has been known since the early 18th century.

 For the food buff, there is serendipity on every page. This reader didnt know that Wigs were light-textured white bread, raised with yeast and are traditionally connected with Lent. There are innumerable such gems here, making it an invaluable addition to a gourmets library and as a guide to his gastronomic adventures.

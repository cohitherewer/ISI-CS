 VEIL OF PEACE

 The second round-table on Jammu and Kashmir, held recently in Srinagar, seems to have turned out better than expected. Although there was limited participation in the round-table and heightened violence during the event, the discussions seem to have yielded concrete results. What, however, is now required is to inject greater dynamism and imagination into the peace process to prevent it from collapsing. The most remarkable part of the round-table was the time that the prime minister gave to the proceedings. Mr Manmohan Singh spent nearly two days listening to a number of prominent political and social activists from within the state. By doing so, the prime minister demonstrated not just the sincerity of the government of India in addressing the problems of the state, but also his personal determination to build a new relationship between New Delhi and Srinagar. The prime minister also seems to have reached out during his visit to the ordinary citizen of the state by addressing many of the day-to-day issues that affect the life of the people. For instance, Mr Manmohan Singh sought to ensure that the security forces demonstrate maximum restraint while carrying out counter-insurgency operations. He presided over a meeting of the unified headquarters of the security forces and issued personal instructions, in this context, to the top brass of the armed forces. Similarly, there was a promise to consider the rehabilitation of those young men who had crossed over to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, to join the ranks of the militants, became disillusioned, and now want to return. And the prime minister signaled that political detinues from Jammu and Kashmir, languishing in various jails in the country over the last decade, could be released within weeks. 

 The round-table has led to the formation of working groups on a variety of issues, including the possibility of developing linkages cross the line of control. All this seems to be rooted in the philosophy that peace in Jammu and Kashmir cannot be created through imported models of conflict resolution or packages from outside, but through ideas that are rooted in the people. The real challenge, in the days to come, will be to make the process and especially the working groups more inclusive. Clearly, a section of the separatists must be persuaded to join the groups to make them credible. No less important will be to ensure that the dialogue with Pakistan is sustained and that Islamabad has little incentive to sponsor violence in the state. This is a challenging task that requires political grit and imagination. Thus, the less the prime minister relies on his bureaucratic advisers the better it will be for the peace process.

 GLOBAL CAMPUS

 Sometimes, globalization creates the happiest confusions. Jawaharlal Nehru University students union now has an American, leftist vice-president. Mr Tyler Walker Williams is a Californian. He is also a student of Hindi (and speaks it fluently), opposes the American invasion of Iraq, supports the Indian governments pro-reservations policy, and has protested, on the JNU campus, against Indias vote against Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency and against the rise of Indian farmers suicides. Mr Williams is backed by the All India Students Association, affiliated to the Marxist-Leninist faction of the Communist Party of India. He celebrates his own victory as the triumph of the Left in a university in which the Hindu right had been gaining some ascendancy. And apart from his political agenda, he wants to bring about a sort of dietary reform on campus: he wants to make hostel food less spicy for the sake of the foreign students.

 Even though student-union elections in Indian universities are usually inseparable from the alignments of national politics, Mr Williamss election shows how student politics can carve out its own space within civil society. The Indian polity remains uncomfortable about foreign political leaders. Yet, most reassuringly, nothing of that sort seems to have bothered the JNU students. The radical Left in India and JNU has been no exception remains largely anti-American. But that too has not been an issue in Mr Williamss case. Mr Williams also embodies that other phenomenon which most Indians would find difficult to imagine: the American communist. That a substantial proportion of younger America represents an actively critical position with respect to its countrys political establishment is a fact that the world would do well to acknowledge. It is perverse to see a victory that has been hailed by the victors as the triumph of the Left as also a triumph of globalization. But that is yet another interesting paradox that Mr Williams embodies.

 NOOSE ON IRAQ

 The verdict of death sentence delivered upon Saddam Hussein needs to be separated from the rights and wrongs of the American invasion of Iraq. Hussein is an evil man who has on his hands the blood of hundreds of thousands of innocent Kurds and Shias. He can claim his place next to Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler and Idi Amin in the 20th century gallery of mass murderers. Hussein, when he ruled Iraq, believed that he was the state and his every whim was law. In fact, he asserted in his defence that whatever he perceived as a threat he destroyed in the manner he thought was best, without recourse to the niceties of law. Very few will regret the fact that such a man has been condemned to death, and the fact that he will not be permitted to have the honour of facing a firing squad. The death sentence was a fait accompli. The day the American military forces discovered the tyrant in his hideout and arrested him, Hussein was a dead man. Yet, there was a trial.

 The process of trying Hussein, however inadequate that process may have been, distinguishes the regime that Hussein led and the present dispensation under the auspices of a conquering army. Hussein did not believe in trying his enemies. But since the Nuremberg trials, held after World War II to try leading Nazis, there is a tradition in the West to make mass murderers and tyrants face a legal process. There can be no doubt that such courts represent victors justice. But the accused are at least allowed to make statements defending themselves. Hussein did not allow any accused such a luxury. It is also important to underline the context of the trial and its constraints. The trial was conducted in a war zone. The regime conducting the trial is struggling to establish itself as a democracy. The judicial system was thus a fledgling one: judges were moved and lawyers killed. These were not the ideal condition for holding a proper trial based on the rule of law. The execution of Hussein, when it takes place, will be the first step towards establishing the rule of law in Iraq. Iraq will finally and hopefully be rid of its tyrannical past. Iraqs present has other ghosts stalking it: the ghost of a misplaced invasion that ruined the country. It will be interesting to see if a military invasion can leave in its aftermath a thriving democracy. The people of Iraq have given the United States of America a long enough rope. Something more useful than Saddam Husseins corpse must dangle at the end of it.

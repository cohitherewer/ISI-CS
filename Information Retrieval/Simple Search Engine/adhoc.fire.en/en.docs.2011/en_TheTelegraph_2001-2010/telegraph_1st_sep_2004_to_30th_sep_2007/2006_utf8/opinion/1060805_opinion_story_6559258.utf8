 This Above All -Khushwant Singh

 Eye for an eye

 Parents send their sons and daughters after they have finished with school education to colleges in the hope that they will be better equipped to choose their careers and be able to earn their own livelihood and prosper. Most of them fulfil their parents ambitions, attend classes regularly, pass their final exams and find employment. However, there are some more interested in becoming Chaudharies. They spend a lot of their time in students union activities, and, when frustrated, call for strikes and force colleges to close down. Some educational institutions are more prone to student agitations than others. One of them is Jamia Millia Islamia of Delhi, which was set up by nationalist Muslims in answer to the pro-British raj Aligarh Muslim University.

 I have nothing against students unions, provided they confine their activities to issues related to their education and living conditions. I am in favour of students making annual assessments of the quality of teaching imparted to them; giving marks to professors and lecturers, the quality of computers and laboratory equipment, classrooms, playgrounds, hostel accommodation and food served to them. No more. They have no business meddling with admissions or selection of staff. And they have no right to call for strikes which adversely affect the studies of their fellow students.

 The recent strike in Jamia Millia breached these unwritten codes of conduct. The union demanded the resignation of the vice-chancellor, Mushirul Hasan, an eminent historian of national repute and the proctor. Students sat in dharna outside their offices to prevent them from discharging their duties. They went on relay fasts, whatever that means. My own guess is one fellow fasts from breakfast to lunch, the next from lunch to tea-time, the third from tea time to dinner and all of them fast from dinner to breakfast next morning. Having got nowhere besides bullying the university to close down, they approached the local MP, Vijay Kumar Malhotra of the BJP, for advice. As an academic in the past, he must have faced such problems in his time. As an active politician, he may have changed his way of thinking. I dont know what he told them. I think instead of seeking assistance from a politician, they should have gone to their parents for advice. I have no doubt they would have received tight slaps on their faces and been told, Is this what we sent you to college for?

 Pearls of wisdom

 Brits had a mania for creating emblems and mottos for institutions they built. So colleges like the London School of Economics had the bearded Phineas as its emblem and Kings College across the Strand had Leo a red lion. So had all other educational institutions in Great Britain. They also had mottos in Latin inscribed beneath the badges. None of our ancient institutions of learning like Nalanda or Taxila indulged in designing emblems to represent them or mottos to motivate them. No sooner the raj established itself, emblems and mottos became a must. Some kept the British tradition of having them in Latin; others opted for our ancient mother tongue, Sanskrit. Modern School, where I spent ten years of my life, had an emblem of a banyan tree spreading over a lake with a swan and lotus; the motto underneath was in Sanskrit Naim atma balheenan na labhya those without strength do not find their souls. St. Stephens College had it in Latin, Ad Die Gloriam to the glory of God.

 Quoting scriptures and sayings of eminent people has spread like a bush fire. Every one of our national dailies devote space to pander to the public taste for solemn, well-worded advice to be good and god-fearing.

 Edwin Lutyens, the chief architect of New Delhi, was a fervent believer in mottos: so were a succession of viceroys. When Lutyens got engaged to Emily, the daughter of Lord Lytton, he gave his finance a casket as a gift. On it he inscribed: As faith wills, fate fulfils. 

 The zest for inscribing mottos is evident in several buildings in New Delhi which not many visitors notice. When the Jaipur Column was installed in front of the Viceregal Palace (now Rashtrapati Bhawan), Viceroy Lord Irwin asked Lutyens to suggest a suitable motto. Lutyens, who had a puckish sense of humour, first suggested No dogs must be allowed on the ramp. Then in a more serious frame of mind he suggested, Endow your thought with faith/ Your deed with courage/ Your life with sacrifice/ So all men may know the greatness of India. Lord Irwin shortened it to read: In thought, faith/ In word, wisdom/ In deed courage/ In life, service/ So may India be great. The words are inscribed at the base of the column.

 Visitors do not get the chance to see the inscription beneath the throne chairs for the Viceroy and Vicereine (now the Rashtrapati and his Lady). It was suggested by Mrs Shoosmith, wife of one of the engineers, and taken from the Bible: Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding.

 Bread and butter issues

 With the advent of New Budget Era

 I cherish in mind a dainty dream

 If I dont get bread and butter

 I will go in for an ice-cream!

 Bitten by the travel bug

 I have an urge to speed afar

 I will sell away my old scooter

 And buy a new Maruti Car,

 Being a good-for-nothing fellow

 I dont do service, Y or X

 Why should I worry if the Finance Minister

 Has raised the rate of Service Tax?

 World in her pocket

 Q: What does a Kangaroo mother say when she finds her baby missing?

 A: Kisee ney mera pocket maar liya someone has picked my pocket.

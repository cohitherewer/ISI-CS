 Bending the rules

 Sir ? The president returning the controversial parliament (prevention of disqualification) amendment bill, 2006, for ?reconsideration? was a sharp reprimand to the United Progressive Alliance government (?Kalam kicks profit bill back?, May 31). A.P.J. Abdul Kalam?s gesture expresses the feelings of the common man and warns our politicians who had perhaps thought of him as a ?rubber stamp president?, always ready to sign on the dotted line. With the UPA already in trouble on the reservations issue, this move further damages its image. 

 Many of the positions mentioned in the ?exempted list? were created during and after the Nineties. Clearly, then, the bill cannot be implemented with retrospective effect from as early as 1959 ? as rightly pointed out by Kalam. The bill should have specified its implications, given that there are several ?office of profit? petitions pending before the Election Commission. Instead of harping on the president?s constitutional obligation to give his assent to a bill sent to him for the second time, our members of parliament should learn to respect the moral role of the Constitution. With many MPs wanting to push the bill through once again in the monsoon session of parliament, there is bound to be a confrontation between the head of state and the head of government. This will set a shameful precedent both before the citizens of India and the international community. The EC should disqualify people who hold offices of profit as was done with the Rajya Sabha MP, Jaya Bachchan. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? When it comes to saving their own skin, or increasing their own salaries and perquisites, our politicians are quick to pass bills. But bills like the women?s reservation bill, right to information bill or any other law that is meant to benefit the public, are discussed repeatedly and put in cold storage for years. If the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has the interests of the country in mind, he will surely agree with all the points put forward by the president for review on the return of the bill. However, each passing day is showing him in a poor light. He is being hindered by the political quagmire that people like human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, and the law minister, H.R. Bhardwaj, have created. The office of profit bill needs to be challenged in the Supreme Court to see whether it stands the court?s scrutiny.

 Yours faithfully, 

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? By exercising his privilege of legal consultation, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam has demonstrated that checks and balances are integral to India?s parliamentary system of governance. The Congress and the left, whose MPs stand to gain the most from the proposed law, should refrain from criticizing Kalam. That would reflect nothing but their contempt for the Constitution, and further blacken their reputation before the already disillusioned electorate. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Akshay, Secunderabad

 Sir ? The statement of Prakash Karat, asking the EC not to consider pending applications for the disqualification of MPs until the bill to retrospectively exclude offices of profit is passed is an infringement of the rights of a constitutional authority (?Left scorns Kalam query?, June 2). This is an example of an elected representatives trying to gain extra-constitutional power. The anxiety of the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in trying to protect the membership of a significant number of his party colleagues is understandable. But he must realize that until the bill receives presidential assent and is passed, the EC is bound to act according to the existing law. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.N. Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir ? Every president, before holding office, takes an oath in the presence of the chief justice of India. He vows to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. If our president feels that a particular bill is against the spirit of the Constitution, he may refer the same to the Supreme Court without signing it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Oishik Bagchi, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why are the MPs shy of facing the charges levelled against them? The petitions to the EC would need supporting evidence, and the investigations will take considerable time. Who knows, if the office of profit amendment bill is passed within that time, many of the MPs would escape enquiry. And even if some are disqualified, if and once the bill becomes law, their disqualifications might be reversed. If Jaya Bachchan and Sonia Gandhi can take the trouble to recontest their lost positions, there is no reason why others cannot do the same.

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 ENEMY WITHIN

 The Bengalis have long proved to be the worst enemies of Bengals promise. If there was an illusion of things changing, Ms Mamata Banerjees call for another bandh, this time for 48 hours, breaks it. But it actually goes beyond individual politicians or their parties and relates to the more fundamental issue of certain attributes of the Bengali mind. Ms Banerjee today does what the leftists had done for decades before they found themselves in a different role in the government. In another time, other groups of Bengalis let themselves be carried away by romantic notions of revolutionary change. What was common to all these was a death-wish that made Bengal a land of despair and desolation. Worse, the states politicians seemed to delight in competing for ruining Bengals hopes. Ms Banerjee, therefore, sees a recovery of Bengals economy only in terms of victory and defeat for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee or for herself. It is this mindset that sets the Bengali politicians apart from their compatriots elsewhere. The Congress may hate Mr Narendra Modi for his communal politics; but party rivalry is rarely allowed to harm Gujarats interests.

 This kind of politics is its own excuse. Any event is grist to these politicians mill. Ms Banerjee has called the latest bandh apparently in order to protest against the gruesome killing of a young woman in tragic circumstances in Singur. It is still not known what link, if any, the death has to the acquisition of land for the Tata groups automobile project in Singur. But the practitioners of the politics of shutdowns have no use for either facts or logic. Ms Banerjee has more reason not to wait for evidence of any kind. She has tried various means, including a fortnight-long fast, to force the government to retrace its steps on the project. The tragic event in Singur is, therefore, something that she can hope to exploit in order to give her unsuccessful campaign a fresh push. Once again, Ms Banerjees action is only a symptom of a certain mindset. In a different scenario, the leftists would probably have done the same thing or worse. In the Fifties and the Sixties, Bengali communists revelled in holding the states progress to ransom. In 1959, they called a 72-hour hartal in Bengal during their food movement. 

 The irony is that Ms Banerjee is trying to use the leftist weapons of yesteryears at a time when there are some early signs of an economic turnaround in Bengal. The chief minister is the most visible face in it, but it is also owing to the Marxists changing their ways. After several decades, investors are prepared to take their chances in Bengal. The Tata groups project in Singur captures that glimmer of hope. Once, destructive politics drove Bengals best minds away to other shores. Another spell of such politics may be the end of all hopes.

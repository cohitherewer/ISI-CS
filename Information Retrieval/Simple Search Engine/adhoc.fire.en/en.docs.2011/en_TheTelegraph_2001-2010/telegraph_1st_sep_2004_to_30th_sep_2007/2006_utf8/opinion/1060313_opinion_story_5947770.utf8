 Terror comes home

 Sir ? The blasts in Varanasi come as a shock (?Serial blasts in Varanasi?, March 8). The way in which a string of attacks has been carried out in different parts of India for the past year or so, points at well-organized terrorist groups who have all the necessary resources for large-scale operations. The government should strengthen internal security and devise ways to track down the masterminds behind the serial killings. The political parties too need to stop fighting among themselves and get united in the interest of the country and its people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The city of Varanasi, which epitomizes the intermingling of cultures that characterizes India, has come under threat following the bomb blasts. And now the shadow of communal riots hangs ominously over Varanasi as well as the entire country. But the conflagration of communal passions would only help terrorists achieve their desired end. It is time that the government and the citizens of India rise to the challenge and fight as one against the enemy of the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? No word can adequately condemn the dastardly killings of innocent people in Varanasi. What is the solution to this menace of terrorism? In a powder keg of communal tension like India, the Bharatiya Janata Party is ill-advised to politicize the blasts. Just because a few Muslims are suspected to be behind the attacks, the Muslims of India should not crawl back into their ghettoes and fight it out with the rest of the country. With the perpetrators of the Gujarat genocide still at large and the likes of Narendra Modi, Bal Thackeray and Praveen Togadia enjoying wide popularity, the Muslims have reason to feel cornered and powerless to change the negative image that has got stuck to them. But it is important that they do it in order to wipe out terrorism from India.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is disgusting to see our political parties turning this hour of crisis into yet another opportunity to engage in a wrangle. The governments, whether at the Centre or in the states, are always quick to react by ordering inquiries, rushing additional forces, and announcing compensations. The opposition parties call for bandhs, complaining about the incompetence of the ruling party. By doing so, they only display their insensitiveness to the sufferings of the dead and injured. These people deserve as much condemnation as the perpetrators of violence. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The motive behind the bomb attacks at the Sankat Mochan temple in Varanasi was not just to kill the devotees but to create panic among people and incite communal violence. The terrorists want to cash in on Muslim anger on the issue of the Babri Masjid by attacking Hindu temples. The Muslims must make sure that they do not fall for this evil design. The recent report of the U.C. Banerjee committee on the Godhra train fire ought to have revived the faith of the Indian Muslims in the Indian judicial system. The only way to foil the separatist plans of both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists is to put up a united resistance.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? After the Varanasi blast, the Congress has declared that all ?good secularists? should come together to ?fight? the BJP (?Bid to build secular force?, March 10) . It is easy to understand that the Congress is trying to enlist the support of the minorities by condemning the communal stand of the BJP. However, this can lead to a Hindu backlash, which is not at all desirable at this volatile juncture. As a pan-Indian party, the Congress must behave more responsibly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? Islamic terrorism has reared its ugly head once again. The attacks cannot have been caused merely by the negligence of the Central government, as claimed by the BJP. It is an instance of international terrorism spreading its tentacles in India. The government should respond to such brutal acts with matching ruthlessness whereby the terrorists and their sympathizers are eliminated completely. Otherwise, the menace of terrorism would shatter the Indian dream of becoming a military and economic superpower.

 Yours faithfully,

S.K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The bomb blasts in Varanasi might impel people to ask ?Does god protect?? Devotees were killed at the Sankat Mochan temple at the time of the ?auspicious? evening prayer. God seems unable to protect himself, let alone protect others. The belief that god saves is one of the pillars of all religions which is used to draw more and more followers. Although the Varanasi blasts have claimed so many lives, yet it can perhaps serve just one positive purpose, by proving the ineffectiveness of god and religion. If god has lost his power in the modern world, do human beings need to turn against each other in his name?

 Yours faithfully,

N. Narasimhan, Bangalore

 Sir ? It was reassuring to find that Sonia Gandhi and the Union home minister visited Varanasi immediately after the blasts. On the contrary, the BJP started planning a yatra. The people can see through these stale gimmicks. The yatra it is sure to end in a whimper even before it starts.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

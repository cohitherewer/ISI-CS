 More justice 

 Sir ? The conviction of former Mumbai police constable, Sunil More, for the rape of a 17-year-old college girl shows that that the Indian judicial system can deliver (?Police rapist gets 12 years, govt seeks life?, April 4). Trials of serious crimes like rape and murder should be completed within the minimum possible time while the evidence is still fresh and before witnesses have had time to turn hostile. But doubt remains whether the sentence of 12 years of rigorous imprisonment for More will serve as a sufficient deterrent in society. Even more important, will it be enough to restore public faith in the law enforcement authority whose representative, Sunil More, had committed the act within the precincts of a police outpost?

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Mumbai

 Sir ? The speedy deliverance of justice in the rape case in Mumbai is laudable, especially when one takes into account the severity of Sunil More?s crime ? the rape of a minor and that too while he was on duty. Other than the fast trial, the verdict has other positive aspects too. The sentence was given by an additional sessions court (and not by a fast track court), none of the witnesses turned hostile, and the court relied on the in-camera testimony of the victim. By convicting the guilty, the court has set a precedent and given a ray of hope to thousands of rape victims awaiting justice. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? The judge of the additional sessions court in the Sunil More case has noted that More is the sole earner in a family that includes his ailing mother, unmarried sister and seven-year-old child. A mercy petition on such grounds makes little sense as it pleads for the convicted criminal to be let off on considerations extraneous to the crime. If the man?s family really depends on him, then he should have been responsible enough to think of it before raping an innocent. The prosecution rightly argued before the additional sessions court judge that the cruel assault on a young girl by a supposed upholder of the law deserves the highest punishment in the book for rape: jail for life. However, life imprisonment in India often means parole after 14 years. The possibility of remission should be done away with. Only that will ensure that such criminals do not roam free in society and there is some fear of law.

 Yours faithfully,

Joyeeta Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that trials in India are often influenced by the culprit?s social standing, financial condition and political connections. The Jessica Lal case has proved that the rich and influential can commit any crime and get away with it. Had the case of Sunil More not met with public outrage and media glare, the accused could have escaped punishment, especially since he was on the side of the law-enforcers. An important feature of this trial was that it was held in-camera, which lent transparency to the judicial procedure. At the same time, the identity of the victim was kept under wraps, which is crucial since in most cases, the social stigma forces women to take back the charge. The trial should go down in the annals of law history for what it has achieved.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan 

 Battle zone

 Sir ? The hype over ?First sign of result in AIDS battle? (March 30) is aimed more at generating a mass euphoria than encountering the stark reality. The statistics pointing at infections in young women confined to some zones in north and south India cannot represent the red zones to the west and north-east of India. The negligible drop of 0.6 per cent in four years in a very specific age group of young women in the South cannot be a reason for complacence. That the epidemic is weakening is a remark that is too premature for good. Let?s not miss the point that AIDS is a dreaded disease that shows no signs of decline. Africa is already boiling in such a cauldron of research-based surveillance and statistics generation. India should try to fuel awareness than reel out data from intellectual scaffoldings.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The news of a decline in HIV infections in parts of India is bound to boost the confidence of the medical fraternity. Though the rate of decline is marginal, we should remain hopeful about a breakthrough in AIDS control in the future.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Moloy Bhattacharya, Sukur, Burdwan 

 Sir ? Despite positive pointers of the recent study on AIDS, there can be no doubt that in India a more vigorous publicity of the menace is required in red light areas of cities.

 Yours faithfully,

 Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

 ARMS LENGTH

 It would have been ironic if an actor who has come to be associated in the popular mind with the slogan of Gandhigiri were to be convicted of terrorism. Thus, it will be a relief to many that the actor, Sanjay Dutt, was acquitted of the serious charge of conspiracy in the 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai. The court, however, found him guilty of illegally possessing arms. This, on the face of it, is a minor offence. It is important to note, however, under which clauses of the Indian Arms Act Dutt was found guilty. He was found guilty under Section 3, for possessing a 9mm pistol, and under Section 7, for possessing an AK-56 rifle. The latter is bound to raise a few eyebrows: no one owns such a sophisticated gun for reasons of self-defence. An AK-56 is not an ordinary gun. It is also possible that Dutt possessed more than one AK-56. It was the submission of the Central Bureau of Investigation that another AK-56 had been destroyed by melting it in a foundry. Two of Dutts friends have been convicted, inter alia, of destroying evidence. These two pieces of information read together are rather suggestive. Dutt may not have been party to a terrorist plot but the nature of the arms he possessed leaves certain important questions unanswered.

 The judge accepted the stand taken by Dutts counsel that he had acquired and possessed these arms for self-defence. What the actor did wrong was that he did not get the necessary permission for owning the arms. The AK-56 rifle is a prohibited weapon, which means that no civilian can possess or own this gun under any circumstances. The plea that Dutt possessed an AK-56 for self-defence is thus a spurious one. The acquiring of such a gun and then the possession of it point to a trail of acts that are not permissible under the laws of the land. Thereby also hangs the question why Dutt possessed such a weapon and how he came to acquire it. The lightness of the verdict on Dutt a violation of the Arms Act carries a minimum prison term of five years must be seen in the light of these serious and unanswered questions. The entire legal process concerning the blasts in Mumbai highlights the question of time. From the event to the verdict, it has taken nearly 13 years; cases like Dutts can also go on to appeal in a higher court. There is cause to ponder what this length of time does to the legal process, to the accused, to the investigating agencies and to the counsels of both parties.

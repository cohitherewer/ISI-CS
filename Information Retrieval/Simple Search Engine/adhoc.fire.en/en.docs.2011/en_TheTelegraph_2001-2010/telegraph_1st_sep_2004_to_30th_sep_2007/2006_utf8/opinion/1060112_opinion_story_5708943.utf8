The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CHIEFS SAY YES

 Confused notions of censorship could result in measures that look outrageous in a modern democracy. Ms Sharmila Tagore inviting the chiefs of the army, navy and air force, together with the defence minister, to watch a feature film touching on the MiG 21 controversy, before the censors clear the film, does set a seriously lopsided precedent. Ms Tagore apparently ?just thought that they all should see it? because it is a ?good film?. And this too is a rather dodgy thing to do. Providing publicity for the film is not really her job, especially before the censor board has certified it. Besides, why get together such an audience and make it look like a casual preview when the obvious sighs of relief after it was ?passed? by the powerful points to a different sort of situation. The full military and political panoply around this screening, and the ?no objection? given by the air force seem to suggest the censor board?s, and its chief?s, nervousness about the controversial content of the film. The board had previously tried to push for ?self-regulation? by television channels, in order to cut down on violence and sex in their programmes, and at a more political level, a recent documentary on Jayaprakash Narayan had been asked to soften its critical perspective on the Emergency.

 Ms Tagore has publicly expressed her views on the problematic, indeed redundant, role of a censor board in a mature democracy. But India, she believes, is not as mature as Britain in this matter, and less ?homogeneous?, with its urban-rural divide. This calls for judicious censorship, something that her predecessor was deemed not to have been able to dispense in the previous political regime. Such an argument is nebulous, condescending and undemocratic. But getting Rang De Basanti ?passed? by the military chiefs and Central minister is more ominous, even sinister. The critical independence of the arts, the importance of the freedom of expression in civil society, is held in jeopardy here. And this is just as bad as getting religious films okayed by religious leaders, as suggested by the national commission for minorities after the controversy over Jo Bole So Nihaal. The Maharashtra government?s banning of a historical critique of Shivaji, and all the shameful palaver around it, is only a few degrees worse. Power, at its most insecure, is fundamentally inimical to adult freedoms.

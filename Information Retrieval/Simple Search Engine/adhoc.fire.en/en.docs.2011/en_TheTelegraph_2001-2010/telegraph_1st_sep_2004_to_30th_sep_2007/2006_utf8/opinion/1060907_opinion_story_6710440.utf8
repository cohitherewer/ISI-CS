The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Ticket to ride 

 Ruma Karmakar loves bus tickets. Even when she was a little 

 girl, Rumas first words to her father, after the poor man 

 had come back after yet another gruelling day at work, was 

 whether he had saved his bus ticket for her. Ruma had also 

 perfected the art of making a long face. It helped on the 

 days her father failed to bring her a ticket. The next day, 

 he would get her two. 

 Even as Ruma reminisced about her childhood, the Whiteliner bus stood purring in front of the Tollygunge Metro station before it began its long journey to the airport. It is early morning and, already, there is a hint of rain. There are a few passengers, reclining on comfortable, cushioned seats. Some sit reading the morning paper, others are sleeping with their mouths open.

 With a swift, smooth movement, the driver perches himself on his seat. A little jerk, a tinkle of a bell, and Ruma gets ready for her favourite time of the day. This wisp of a girl, who now works as a conductor, still loves bus tickets. Only now, she hands them over to others, instead of keeping them for herself.

 But for Ruma and others like her (there are a few women working as conductors on the Whiteliner routes -- two more girls had joined the fleet a few days back), it is not always a joyride. Often, they have to deal with irate passengers cribbing about fares (travelling on Whiteliners is a little expensive). The job is quite demanding too Ruma has to report to work at 6 in the morning and her shift stretches till late afternoon. 

 But then she loves her job. There are the tickets. And she gets to meet different kinds of people. She is also very happy with the ambience at work. And not all of it is drab or mindless. Gallant men often go out of their way to find her a seat, without realizing that she is the conductor.

 Would Ruma continue to work after her marriage? Surprisingly, the answer is no. With a job that involves long and often irregular hours, Ruma feels there will be very little time left for family life. 

 Debashish Das, the man who manages the small ticket counter at Tollygunge, feels that young women are now more aware of employment opportunities. Burgeoning unemployment has also forced them to explore unconventional job segments. They are also extremely professional and efficient workers, he added. So even if Ruma decides to leave her job, there will be others to take her place.

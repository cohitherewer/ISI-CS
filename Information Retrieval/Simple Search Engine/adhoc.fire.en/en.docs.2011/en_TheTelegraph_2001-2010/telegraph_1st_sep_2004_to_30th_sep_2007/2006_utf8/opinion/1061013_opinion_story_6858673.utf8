 All things bright and beautiful

Tenacious (Hodder amp; Stoughton, 8.15 ) by Julian Stockwin talks about the heroic deeds of lieutenant Thomas Paine Kydd and the brave crew of Tenacious. Kydd and his mates are busy putting their feet up and raising a toast to their beloved ship, when they are summoned on an urgent mission. It seems that a revolution is around the corner in neighbouring France, but Bonaparte s fleet has gone missing. The Tenacious is asked to join Nelsons task force to launch a desperate search. Kydds ambition sees him at the forefront of the mission, and he soon realizes that taking on responsibility has its own perils. Amidst the raging sea, lives are lost, loyalty is tested and war appears to last forever. This book would definitely inspire a sequel to Master and Commander.

 ANOTHER DOWN

 Bureaucrats are used to being shifted from one assignment to another. Whether that makes any difference to the administration is another question. But the change of the chief secretary in Jharkhand raises some questions about administrative stability in the state. The issue is not the administrative abilities of either the outgoing chief secretary, Mr P.P. Sharma, or his successor, Mr M.K. Mandal. The point about the change is that it has been happening far too frequently. Mr Sharma was the fourth chief secretary to have been abruptly removed from the post in almost as many years. The new state, that was carved out of Bihar, is still struggling with the problem of putting its own administrative and other infrastructure in place. It still has to depend on senior officers who are sent to Jharkhand from the Centre or other states on deputation. Too frequent changes at the top seem to have put the administration continually in a flux. An air of administrative instability cannot do much good to the morale of officials at different levels.

 There is a more important reason why the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, should avoid creating the impression of an administrative instability. He has been successful in attracting substantial investments to Jharkhand, especially in steel and mining. The investors like to see a stable administration as much as they hate political uncertainty. This clearly is the state?s time of promise and an unsure administration can be a spoiler. It can also be a time of new worries and tensions. New industries displacing people from their homes will throw up new administrative and political challenges. The recent tragedy in Orissa?s Kalinga Nagar, where the opposition by tribal people to the construction of a new industrial site led to the death of 12 of them in police firing, should be a warning to Jharkhand. Maoist rebels, already a major threat in the state, could lie in wait to foment similar troubles there. This actually is the time for Mr Munda to plug the holes in his administration. Shuffling senior officers at random is not the best way to do it.

 BRIDGING THE DIVIDE

 The time may be right for a merger between the CPI and the CPI(M), but the latter can hardly look beyond its nose, says Sumanta Sen

 For some support

 Among the callers at Jyoti Basus residence on his birthday last month was Manjukumar Majumdar, the West Bengal secretary of the Communist Party of India. Whether he had carried sweets for the veteran leader is not known but he did carry an important request. Please take the initiative for the unity of our two parties, he had said. Basu had reportedly smiled and made a general statement about the need for unity.

 A couple of weeks ago, another development took place. The CPI invited Benoy Konar, central committee member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), to speak on agrarian problems vis--vis the need for industrialization. This was not quite usual, particularly in the context of the CPIs stated reservations about the CPI(M)s stand that the need for industrialization was supreme and that even agricultural land could be acquired if need be. Konar, despite being a peasant movement leader, supports that policy. The CPIs explanation was, Comrade Benoy Konar is the seniormost leader in the peasant front and so we invited him to speak on the subject. No mention was made about policy differences.

 The two developments cannot be unrelated. Communists never do anything without a plan. Indeed, these were of a piece with the CPIs earlier urgings for unity. The other partys response so far has been lukewarm. It seems to favour greater united action short of a merger. The CPI, however, seems bent on pursuing its goal.

 And there is no reason why it should not. The ground reality today is far removed from that in the early Sixties which led to the split in 1964. The issue of National Democratic Front versus Peoples Democratic Front is no longer relevant. The successors of P. Sundarayya, B.T. Ranadive and others have no problems today supporting a Congress-led ministry, to even have covert electoral adjustments with the Congress as in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In a way it is the other way round now. The CPI in Bihar opposed an alliance of which the Congress was a part while the CPI(M) joined it.

 Together with the CPI, the CPI(M) now is also saying that its support to the United Progressive Alliance is to keep away the right from coming into power. Around fifty years ago, the CPI led by S.A. Dange had been viciously attacked by those who later formed the CPI(M) for advocating much the same line. Of course, the CPIs position has always been marked by ambivalence. While it saw progressives in the Congress, it had no hesitation in 1967 in participating, along with the then Jan Sangh, in non-Congress ministries. But all that is past. Today the two parties enjoy much greater unity of thought than ever before.

 There is also the international situation. The Soviet Union is no more there, hence no Sino-Soviet dispute. Hence the CPI can no longer be labelled as pro-Soviet or accused of viewing national developments through the eyes of Kremlin. 

 So what stands in the way of a merger? Various points on the basis of ideology may be cited but they will surely be more jargon than anything else. The problem is essentially personal. Long years of rivalry have created a bitterness so deep that today even the cadre at the lowest level cannot imagine being members of the same party. In Bengal, for instance, there are still CPI(M) members who remember clearly the raw deal they had received from CPI leaders who then controlled the organizing committee in the state. The late Saroj Mukherjee and others and been literally driven out of the partys mouthpiece, Swadhinata, when the revisionists took control.

 Such memories take time to die. It is a fact that at the Bhatinda congress, the CPI broke away from the Dange line and returned to the left-fold. But Bengeites remained in the party and continue do so. Some like Mohit Sen may have been got rid of but even those who stuck to the new party line retained their personal dislikes for those whom they had once termed the Ranadive gang. The late Indrajit Gupta, for instance, always had a few caustic comments to make about Jyoti Basu, albeit in private. 

 In Uttar Pradesh, when Mulayam Singh Yadav was gobbling up CPI leaders like Mitrasen Yadav and others, the party leadership had not only thundered at him but also blamed the much smaller CPI(M) for encouraging this in its own interest. The fact that in Bihar the two parties do not see eye to eye on any issue is common knowledge. In West Bengal, the CPI has always sought to create a mini-front with parties like the Revolutionary Socialist Party and the Forward Bloc.

 The CPIs discomfort is understandable. After the split, it had thought that those who had been expelled at Vijaywada would not amount to much. But over time it found the new party becoming the leading left force in West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura. Its position in the rest of the country also got eroded. 

 Take the recent Assam elections. The CPI(M) won three seats and the CPI only one. In UP, the CPI once had a fair base but all that is gone, largely because of its organizational weakness. The CPI(M), which was a party of no account in the state in 1964, has a presence in the house, albeit a small one.

 But the CPI has taken the reality into account. As a separate entity it will remain a force of no consequence. So it is better to come together by burying hatchets. There is another point to be considered. Running a party organization requires funds and it is no secret that after the collapse of the Soviet Union the party had faced an enormous financial crunch leading to the closing down of many journals. Making common cause with AKG Bhavan may help in that direction also.

 The CPI(M) also is not blind to the reality. But, naturally, the party views the situation from its own angle. It is today seeking to become the main driving force of the non-Congress, non-BJP camp and it needs the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Samajwadi Party in north India for that purpose. In its scheme of things, the present CPI leaders can only be a stumbling block in its midst. Also, it would like the CPI to be further diminished to a stage when a merger will actually be like accommodating some poor relations who have no place to go. 

 Yet a united communist party is certainly the need of the hour. The non-Congress, non-BJP space is considerable in size and today, for the most part, it is occupied by forces of casteism and regionalism. If the two communist parties come together as a single entity then, together with other left forces, including the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist), a healthy force can be built. Such a force did exist in the Fifties, and there is no reason why it cannot come into being today. It can also be a meaningful nucleus for the proposed third front. Till that happens, the nation will continue to see the unhappy spectacle of the CPI running towards Ram Vilas Paswan and V.P. Singh and the CPI(M) seeking to provide respectability to the two Yadavs in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 

 Such a spectacle is unhappy because, with the nation groaning under poverty, the two communist parties still have it in them to provide an united voice to the people. Unfortunately, the larger party in particular does not seem interested in looking beyond its nose.

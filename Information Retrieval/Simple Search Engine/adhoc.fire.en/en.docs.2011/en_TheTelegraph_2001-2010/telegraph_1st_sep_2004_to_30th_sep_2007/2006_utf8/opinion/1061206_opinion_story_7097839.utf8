 CASTE IN STONE

 There can be little doubt about the vulnerability of B.R. Ambedkar in stone. His statues, consecrated serially to mark the highpoints of the Dalit struggle, continue to take the major brunt of caste hatred. The reactions each desecration stir up in the Dalit community are almost always severe, although perhaps less far-reaching as now. Damage to an Ambedkar statue in Kanpur last week saw Maharashtra go up in flames. Trains and buses were torched, shops lit and the police heckled. The situation remains tense on the eve of Ambedkars death anniversary, which also coincides with the date of the Babri Masjid demolition. The news from Kanpur has no doubt come to Maharashtra at a crucial hour. Dalit passions have been simmering since caste attacks in September, and the Brihanmumbai Corporation elections round the corner have lent a particular poignancy to the trail of events. One wonders if the Dalit cause would have earned as much sympathy from the vote-hungry Shiv Sena or as much indulgence from the ruling Nationalist Congress Party-Congress coalition (of which the Dalit Republican Party of India is part) had it been more ordinary times.

 As for Uttar Pradesh, the centre of the storm, the timing of the attack could hardly have been more convenient. The state is about to witness another duel between two colossal leaders of the lower castes in the forthcoming assembly elections. And the statue of Ambedkar which is supposed to represent Dalit might, and thereby that of the Bahujan Samaj Party leader, Ms Mayavati has become relevant again. As expected, the attack has triggered mayhem in the state. Confusion now reigns supreme and there are already demands for the imposition of presidents rule. The Samajwadi Party, the alleged violator of Ambedkars statue, could hardly be inviting this on itself. This is not to say that the Samajwadi Party can absolve itself of all the charges that have been levelled against it. There have been scores of caste attacks led by the Yadavs against Dalits in the state. In their zeal to safeguard their political interests, neither Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav nor Ms Mayavati has paid attention to the welfare of the truly underprivileged in their communities. Be it in their politics or in their action, each leader has betrayed the ideals of the lower caste messiah they are now fighting over.

 THE SEARCH FOR INDEPENDENCE

 The politics of autonomy: Indian experiences Edited by Ranabir Samaddar, Sage, Rs 620

 If a nation?s existence is, as Ernest Renan wrote in What is a Nation, ?a daily plebiscite?, then the demands for autonomy within a nation-state represents a daily interrogation of that existence. In the Indian context, it results in frequent negotiations between the state and the seekers of autonomy, repeated revocations of the Constitution and frequent failures of peace accords. The Gramscian notion of the formation of ?a historic bloc? on the basis of ?a collective will? of the state and its people appears more of an illusion than a reality. This is so because the Indian citizen is almost always split between his dual loyalties to his community and to the state. The latter is also blatantly inconsistent in granting legitimacy to burgeoning autonomies. The paranoia which sets apart the parties involved in the bargain for autonomy reflects the paradoxes integral to the concept of autonomy itself.

 Most discourses on autonomy fail to recognize how autonomous institutions imbibe the authoritarian power politics of the state machinery and effectively silence minority voices. They also overlook the non-territorial forms of autonomy like those pertaining to gender or dispersed communities. The twin principles of freedom and self-regulation, so crucial to the concept of autonomy, as also the question of the resource-base necessary for the smooth functioning of autonomous bodies seldom receive adequate attention.These and other issues concerning the problematics of autonomy have been addressed in this book. The contributors have tried to lay bare different conflicting implications of this polymeric term. The first part of the book deals with the genealogy of the term ?autonomy?. Pradip K. Bose draws upon the Foucauldian concepts of ?governmentality? and ?versatile equilibrium? to discuss the gradual decentering of a modern subject while Paula Banerjee exposes the limitations of the movements for women?s autonomy.

 The second part underscores the absolute necessity of what Sanjay Chaturvedi so tellingly calls ?the autonomy of automies?. This acknowledges and upholds the democratic rights of ?the minority of minorities? represented by tribal communities like the Gujjars, the Lepchas, the Bhutias and the Chakmas of Mizoram. If, according to Homi K. Bhabha, ?nationalism? suffers from a ?minus in its origin?, so does the concept of autonomy. The book stresses on the need for an ethical base and a dialogic space for informing the discourses on autonomy. Otherwise, the concept will inevitably boil down to political quid pro quoism, calling for some ad hoc measures from the powers that be. The need of the hour is a different Constitution ? a Constitution of dialogism.

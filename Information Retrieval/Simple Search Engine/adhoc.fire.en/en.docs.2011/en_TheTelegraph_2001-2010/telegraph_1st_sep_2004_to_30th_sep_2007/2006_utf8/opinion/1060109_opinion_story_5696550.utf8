 WASTED RULES

 India?s general awareness levels are rather low, whether the subject be history or health. So the recent decision of a Supreme Court committee to bar a French battleship laden with toxic waste from arriving in Alang shipyard in Gujarat can be greeted with some relief. An understanding of the dangers of hazardous waste has dawned rather slowly in India. Even now, action on it within the country is fitful at best. Industries have got by for a long time with careless disposal, and efforts to implement the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 have been gathering impetus only in recent years. Notices for closure, for failing standards in treatment, storage and disposal, were issued to various industrial chains in Kerala and elsewhere in the country in September 2004. In 1990, India had signed the Basel Convention, which forbids trade in toxic waste. It also makes it mandatory for the signatories ? France is one ? to minimize the generation of hazardous waste, to reduce its degree of hazardousness and to dispose of it close to the source to limit movement across boundaries. In 2003, the high power committee set up by the Supreme Court estimated that India generates about 12,000 tonnes toxic waste every day.

 The recent court order must be seen within this unhappy context. The French ship is reportedly carrying a freight of asbestos. India?s perceptible laxity with regard to something potentially lethal to the welfare of thousands encourages even other signatories of the Basel Convention to treat it as a dumping-ground. The French battleship is coming in for ship-breaking, and, according to environmental activists, India should not be seen to be hand-in-glove with France in a blatant violation of the convention. This is apart from the primary concern of the danger that the unloaded asbestos would pose. The committee will take its final decision regarding the entry of the ship in two weeks? time and has been discussing the issue of detoxification with the French engineering company employed for the purpose. According to the activists, however, a sharp and clear refusal is what is needed, both for the sake of the environment as well as for an image of firmness. The problem, of course, is the laxity and corruption at home. Once that has been adequately addressed, India?s image as a dumping-ground of the world would change too.

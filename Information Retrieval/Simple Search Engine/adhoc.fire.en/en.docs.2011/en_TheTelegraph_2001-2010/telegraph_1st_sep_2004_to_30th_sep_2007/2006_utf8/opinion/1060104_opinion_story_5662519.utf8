 WHAT?S THE REAL IDEA?

 Gwynne Dyer

 One critic called it ?the common agricultural policy of the sky?, a reference to the European Union?s expensive and wasteful farm support programme, but the Galileo Project has been launched at last. On December 28, 2005 a Russian rocket boosted the Giove-A satellite into orbit from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.

 The small British-built satellite is the first of two designed to test the orbital components of the new European satellite navigation system. Another will follow early in 2006, and once the testing is complete, the launches of the operational satellites will come every couple of months until all thirty of them are in orbit by 2010. It is being touted as a technically superior rival to the quarter-century-old US Global Positioning System.

 There are no reliable estimates of the final cost of getting the Galileo system running: the working figure is $4 billion, but it could be much more. The projected revenues are even hazier, since they assume that it will lure large numbers of users away from the American GPS system. But the forthcoming upgrade of the GPS network should make it even more accurate than Galileo in the next ten years. Few of Galileo?s private investors would be risking their money if the EU?s prestige and its huge resources were not also committed to the project.

 On and off

 The real motives for the Galileo Project are not commercial or even political. It is fundamentally a strategic project, aimed at ensuring that the EU will have guaranteed access to satellite-nav information no matter what happens politically in the next thirty or forty years. Just as the Russians could have relied on receivers for the freely available GPS but put up their own Glonass system instead, so the Europeans do not want to be dependent on Washington?s goodwill.

 The major drawback of the free and universally available GPS system is that it comes with no guarantees whatsoever. At any time, the United States of America can choose to degrade the positioning data available to civil users, or even to switch the system off. It is unlikely to do such a thing except in a grave emergency, but remote contingencies are what strategic planning is all about. If, for example, there were to be a Chinese-US military confrontation in the Taiwan Strait, and the US decided to cut off the GPS service in case China used it, air traffic systems in Asia would collapse.

 Strategic device

 Such considerations convinced the old Soviet Union to go ahead with the rival Glonass system, and similar motives drive the EU to press ahead with Galileo now. Once Galileo is operational, the US will lose a valuable diplomatic lever that it has enjoyed for the past three decades. So the Bush administration mounted a major diplomatic campaign in 2004 to persuade the EU to drop the project. It was particularly insistent that Galileo?s positioning data not be made available to China, which it sees as its emerging strategic rival.

 Given the EU?s perception that Galileo is a key element in assuring its own long-term strategic independence, the American diplomatic offensive was bound to fail. So the US has now agreed to make the two sat-nav systems compatible and ?interoperable?. In other words, future receivers will be able to get a fix, using satellites from either system.

 That means that many users will use the free GPS system for most purposes, and only switch to the fee-based Galileo system when greater accuracy is required. A cynic might conclude that this is a cunning American strategy to ensure that the Galileo system never becomes commercially self-supporting, but the EU could not refuse such a generous and reasonable proposal, so it signed. And that is how the game is played these days.

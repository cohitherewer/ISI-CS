 FIRE WITHIN

 The inferno that claimed nine lives in one of the citys many sweatshops in Topsia has left behind dark, indelible marks. Some of them abound on the walls and floor of the hall in which the young men and children, ensnared workers in the citys leather industry, fought to escape death. The rest form murky patches on the reputation of the citys keepers, while tainting the larger image of the states progress that is being painstakingly created by the chief minister. However, this category of stains seem eminently washable. Previous fires, at an average rate of five every month in the heavily congested area, have not left any imprint on the conscience of the civic administration. Successive legislators, heads of the municipal corporation, the police or the fire services have felt no compulsion either to pull down or curb illegal constructions, to stop power-theft or put a basic infrastructure in place. Even now, despite the unanimous admission of guilt by the departments concerned, the agility with which the buck is being passed suggests that the offending signs of the fire are already beginning to fade from the administrators collective memory. 

 As for the lingering image of the children hard at work amid the combustible substances, it cannot be one unknown to a dispensation that invites a multinational leather company to make the most of the assured cheap labour in this part of the world. It is the assurance of better productivity at low cost (propped up with claims of an adequate infrastructure, of course) that also forms the basis of the governments confidence in wooing foreign investors to the IT sector. The leather industry, undoubtedly, is worse off. It neither attracts the educated city-bred, nor the attention of diehard unionists committed to safeguard workers rights at any cost. It engages the poorest of the poor (often children, for nothing seems to have changed with the child labour law) who sweat in cramped quarters without proper food, pay or safety for a handful of profiteers who showcase the success of the industry. It is this success that is branded as the states own to the world outside. There is hardly any indication of the state ever trying to alter this exploitative mechanism. And now, a government intent on outgrowing its image of one catering to the poor alone, has even less reason to meddle with the ungenerous ways of this industry. 

 Thus, despite the scarred walls next door, makeshift factories will continue to function in Topsias neighbourhood and beyond. The law against child labour will make many of them clandestine operations. This will further endanger the lives of those who work behind collapsible gates that refuse to open.

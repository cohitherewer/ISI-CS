 GETTING CLOSER TO THE FINISHING LINE

Westminster Gleanings -Anabel Loyd

 Read the signs on the wall

 Finally, the phoney war is over. The countdown to the prime ministers departure has begun in earnest with his announcement that he intends to step down during the next twelve months. Judging by his reception at the Trades Union Congress annual conference this week, he may have an uncomfortable few months ahead. The Labour Party conference in a couple of weeks is unlikely to be a softer touch although the delegates may be more mannerly. The unions behaved, en masse, as they have not for many sophisticated, New Labour years. Delegates walked out in assorted groups. They heckled and refused to remember any of the triumphs of Labour under Tony Blair, as they glumly denied even polite applause for his speech. Michael Leahy, the general secretary of Community, the union for workers mainly in the steel, clothing and betting industries, said I dont think people will appreciate the extent of what Tony Blair has done to improve the lives of working people until he is gone.

 Blair is not the man he was when New Labour offered a new vision for the country in 1997. He was an energetic young idealist, and the vision we all bought was one built on hopes and dreams as also on concrete policy. He believed he understood how to construct the foundations of a 21st century state and he could certainly talk the talk to sell people those beliefs. We aspired to his new way forward a successful country with a vibrant workforce and a social conscience; equitable society at home and a new standard of ethical practice abroad. 

 Blairs cabinets have had their fair share of good brains, but it appeared that the ideas in the prime ministers head could never be made into guidelines concrete enough for differing and independent intellects to follow. Robin Cook, for instance, should have been a good foreign secretary, if one of little international stature, but he got it wrong. While Blair has always had the ability to work some wheedling magic on his most intransigent foreign peers, Cook was disposed, in the baldest terms, to tell the leaders of other states how they should run their own countries.

 Other ministers have caused different problems. And without a crystal ball to show the obstacles on the path to the future, neither Blair nor his excited supporters of 1997 should have assumed that the dreams could be easily or swiftly realized. Leaving aside for a moment the real elephant in the room, the Iraq war, and the nauseous syrup of Blairs relationship with George Bush and his merry crew of neo-con extremists, what else has caused the disillusion among Blair lovers and New Labour supporters? Things arent so bad you know, our economy is in good shape under the less-than-enchanting Gordon Brown, prime minister and leadership heir and a damn good chancellor, like it or not. 

 As a fellow architect of the Blairite dream, he has kept his mouth dourly shut and got on with the job. It is only in the past year or so that we have had to watch him attempt a transformation into a touchy, feely Gordon, who willingly takes the ills of this poor world on his shoulders and its children on his knee, even as he privately sticks pins in effigies of his next-door neighbour and leader, the prime minister. Over the last few weeks, the pin-sticking has become unattractively public and has displayed the papered over cracks in the party to one and all.

 Probably the 1997 voters high expectations of so plausible and personable a young prime minister could never survive the storms of reality. We have continued to give Blairs government the benefit of the doubt, in part due to the lack of a viable opposition for much of its time. Over time, some of the measures designed to get the national health and education services on their feet might become effective, although at this moment of complete flux and conflicting planning, it is hard to see any light through the thicket of changing legislation. Changes in the legal services and a raft of new laws on crime and lawlessness seem not to have made anyone feel any safer or to have made the law any more comprehensible to the man in the street. In fact, as with health and education, constant change seems to have created an atmosphere in which no one feels the government is any more capable of following through public service reform than it has been with reforms to the House of Lords.

 Under Blairs presidential style of leadership, we have seen parliament reduced to the level of a talking shop with minimal real power as the peoples check and balance on government. We are newly regulated to within an inch of our lives by an executive which no longer appears either accountable or transparent to the country. This is not the sort of thing that works too well in the United Kingdom. In the end, however much we may have been caught up in the squeaky clean glamour of New Labour, we are a cussed, individualist group and we have woken up to our dislike of being told how to order every detail of our lives. Tony Blair is the leader of an overweeningly bossy government and now Old Labour, New Labour rank and file and the common lot of the rest of the country want him out. The question, of course, is whether his successor is any more likely to listen to us. If it is Gordon Brown, I rather doubt it.

 Brown may, in his grim puritan Scottish way, manage to put an end to the endless sneaking stream of sleaze that has also severely damaged the Blair image. Home Secretary David Blunkett had an affair which was hardly his leaders fault, but he could have been stopped from the emotional outpourings to the press that followed. The prime minister reinstated him with all despatch, only for him to take a second fall over a financial incident. Charles Clarke was sacked from the home office earlier this year over the deportation, or lack of it, of freed foreign prisoners. The home office was then said to be unfit for use by his successor, John Reid, a statement which left egg on everyones faces. Peter Mandelson, the silver-tongued and much-hated interpreter of the New Labour message, went early on in the Blair premiership on rather unfair grounds of financial irregularities. The responsibility for the murky side of ministers or those of many of the other lower forms of Labour Party life cannot be laid at the prime ministers door, but his apparently clumsy handling of men and issues has allowed him to be besmirched also. He has also lost many of his most trusted lieutenants and allies. The press have had axes to grind with Downing Street ever since Alistair Campbell orchestrated the press office there and often appeared to hold the prime minister in thrall as well.

 Closer home, Cherie Blair has got herself into grubby situations with unsavoury individuals and is now portrayed by the press, in spite of her position as an eminent queens counsel, as money-grabbing and lacking in judgment. She does seem to have enjoyed the role of prime ministerial consort rather too freely at times. All the chickens are now coming home to roost and, depressingly, the Blair dream is looking like a mirage. With hindsight and history books, he will be seen as a force for change in his own party and in the country. Blairism is a term already in standard use. In spite of a currently dim picture of achievements at home, we have at least dreamed the dream and it is still possible that a government of whatever colour may carry that forward into solid achievements. 

 Tragically, the ultimate consequences of his actions are still to come. Blair will be remembered most for carrying the country into war in Iraq in a show of solidarity with America and against the wishes of the majority in this country. His shameful personal attachment to the bigoted extreme right American regime may bring us all to perdition in the Middle East.

 BEAR THE HEAT WITH THE COLD

 MIND THE GAP

 What?s so surprising about Kajol facing the camera in a flimsy outfit in the freezing cold of Poland? 

 Just a few months ago, the Poles were treated to a curious spectacle. So I was told on my recent visit to Wroclaw in Poland. Aamir Khan and Kajol were in Zakopane in southern Poland to shoot for the much-hyped film, Fanaa, and a huge crowd had turned up. Not so much to get a glimpse of the actors but to see how the heroine, Kajol, dressed in a flimsy outfit, was coping with the biting cold. 

 ?Temperatures had dipped below minus 10 degrees and there she was prancing around without even as much as a jacket, while all those who had gathered there were shivering despite their huge overcoats, caps, gloves and mufflers. The newspapers here reported it was quite an intriguing sight, especially because the hero was equipped to brave the cold,? recounted Dorota Kolodziejczyk, assistant professor at the university of Wroclaw, in earnestness. 

 For Indians like us who are used to seeing heroines flaunting their curves, sometimes atop snow-capped mountains, this was hardly surprising. After all, baring all in freezing temperatures is now more a norm than an exception. 

 But for the Poles, it was enigmatic. Habituated to moving around in layers of warm clothes for the better part of the year, Dorota was, like many other Poles, eager to know how Indian heroines pull off such stunts, and that too so gracefully.

 It was hard for her to understand there wasn?t anything unusual about it. ?In India, the cold doesn?t get to a woman as much as it does to a man. Women there have a phenomenal capacity to endure and adjust to adverse circumstances,? I explained in a lighter vein. She remained unconvinced; more so because in Poland, women are required to work very hard in order to balance work and home. Only a privileged few can afford to bask in the warmth of their homes as the rest are forced to earn a pay cheque in order to maintain a decent standard of living. 

 The only bright spot, as Dorota pointed out, was that husbands there were also required to chip in on the domestic front ? look after the children, do domestic chores, run errands, even lay the table for lunch or dinner. All this apart from keeping a job. While that may be true for the entire West, in Poland it seemed more pronounced. Even huge billboards near Rynek, the market square, showed the man of the house reading bedtime stories to his child. 

 India, some would say, is slowly moving in that direction. Perhaps, the regressive prime-time serials that project women, but not men, as multi-taskers are a hindrance. From untying the shoelaces of a drunk husband to praying for his health to handling business deals, a woman?s plate is full as compared to the man?s, whose area of work is confined to handling business, at best a demanding boss, and buying soft toys for his child. 

 So, till such time that there is a change in the status quo and a significant shift in paradigm, heroines will be required to prance around in cold climes sporting chiffon sarees. And Indian men will continue to smile benignly as they reach out for that glass of water served by their overworked wives. Little wonder then, that in spite of the world having become smaller, the East and West remain poles apart.

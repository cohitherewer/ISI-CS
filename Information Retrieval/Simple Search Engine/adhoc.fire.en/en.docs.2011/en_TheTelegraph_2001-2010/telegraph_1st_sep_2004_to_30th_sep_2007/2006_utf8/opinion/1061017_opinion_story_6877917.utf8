 FEAR FACTOR

 Notwithstanding the pious pronouncements on their commitment to peace, the bickering gentlemen sitting over the fate of Nepal seem to be taking the nation further and further away from that exalted goal. A fourth round of talks between the ruling Seven Party Alliance and the Maoist rebels failed to go anywhere beyond the fixing of the date of the constituent assembly elections for June next year. The unfinished homework regarding arms management and the position of the monarchy in the new political structure has indefinitely held up all further deliberations on how the elections are to come about. But it is more the first problem that is proving to be the bane of democracy in Nepal. The Maoist reluctance to surrender arms despite the operational ceasefire has forestalled crucial decisions on the composition of the interim government, the constituent assembly and the modality of the polls that will decide the political future of the country. Although the Maoists have consented to arms monitoring by the United Nations both that of the rebels and of the Nepali army the modalities cannot be worked out unless there is a formal ceasefire agreement in place. And that, at any rate, the rebel leaders are unlikely to pledge. At the root of this unwillingness to lay down arms is the Maoists mistrust of the present political dispensation, which is seen to be betraying the peoples revolution by assuring the monarchy a continued hold over the state. There is also the fear of retribution from a people they have so long lorded over with the help of the gun. Despite the guerrillas greater intermingling with the communities at present, both the people and the rebels are yet to let their guards down. So long as the weapons continue to be wielded, this suspicion will last and stymie the expression of the popular political will.

 The Maoists are either truly blind to this fact or are pretending to be so for selfish gains. There might be disagreements among the parties concerned over the proposals of the draft constitution, but these cannot be used as an excuse to walk away from the dialogue. In the end, the people of Nepal, through a referendum, are supposed to choose a role for their monarch. It is the responsibility of both the SPA and Maoist leaders to see that they are able to exercise that choice, without fear or favour.

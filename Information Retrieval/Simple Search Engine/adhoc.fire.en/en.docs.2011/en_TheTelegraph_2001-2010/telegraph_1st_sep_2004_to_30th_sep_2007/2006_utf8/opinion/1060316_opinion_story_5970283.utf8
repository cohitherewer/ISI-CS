 MORAL FORCE

 The women of Manipur have a history of defying fear and violence. But their recent protest against ?mass rapes? by militants is an exceptional act of bravery. It is easier to admire the protest than to understand its true dimensions. The women?s action makes two very significant points. First, it goes a long way in demolishing some myths about the militants in Manipur and other states in the North-east. The militancy tries to thrive on the myth that the rebels are dedicated to the cause of the people?s freedoms. They are also projected as selfless warriors who sacrifice their lives for the cause. The women of Manipur have blown the myth to expose the venal side of the militancy. That the testimony comes from some of the twenty-one victims of the militants? outrageous act makes it particularly shocking. But it is the second message from the event that needs to be emphasized. It shows that a public protest can have a moral force that can face up to the gun. Manipur?s brave women made history sometime back by dropping their clothes in in public in order to protest against another alleged rape by some jawans of the army. That event shook the country and forced the authorities to mend their ways. 

 The women?s protest on the streets of Churachandpur may not end the insurgency; but it has been the strongest public condemnation so far of the rebels? vile ways. It is expected to have its impact on insurgency-related abuses in other states in the region. Militant groups have long forced the common people there to suffer many injustices and indignities. The forcible collection of taxes is only a minor problem compared to the gross violations of human rights inflicted on the people. The fear of the gun stifles the people?s will and all voices of dissent. Manipur?s example can thus help the victims of insurgency in Nagaland and Assam. And, it is no coincidence that women of Manipur have shown the way. Women pay heavy prices for the conflicts in the North-east, as men die and homes are destroyed. But they also play a leading role in rebuilding homes and lives. The Naga Mothers? Association does that in Nagaland like the women?s groups in Manipur. The important thing is the voice of protest, be it against the state?s excesses or against the militants? cruel ways. The least the state can do is listen to the voices and act on them. That will lend credibility to the state?s campaign against the militancy.

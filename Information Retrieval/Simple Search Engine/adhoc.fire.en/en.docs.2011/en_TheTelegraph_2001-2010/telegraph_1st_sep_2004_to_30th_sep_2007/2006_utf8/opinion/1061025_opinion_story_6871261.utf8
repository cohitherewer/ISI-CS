 THE BODY SPEAKS

 Uddalak Mukherjee

 There are many ways to make a point. But only a few gestures remain etched in the memory. Jasmeen Patheja managed to do just that when she organized a novel protest against harassment of women on Indias roads recently. A group of young women, dressed in clothes that they always wanted to wear but could not, took to the streets of Delhi late at night, spraying messages that recorded their experience of being heckled, groped, whistled at and touched up in public. Jasmeen, who runs Blanknoise, an online project to fight against this menace, believes that such night walks help raise awareness about the trauma that a woman faces, each time she leaves the safety of her home. 

 Jasmeen, however, is uncomfortable with the word protest. What we are trying to achieve is to evolve a language to communicate the experience of abuse. The language is aggressive, even confrontational, but it is not what I would call a protest, she says.

 Protest or social communication, call it whatever you like, Jasmeen is definitely not alone when it comes to getting a point across differently. Two years ago, about twelve Manipuri women gathered in front of the Kangla Fort, stripped naked, and raised slogans against the alleged rape and torture of Thangjam Manorama by the security forces, before a horrified nation. Acts of self-immolation have also become quite common among students and professionals, ever since the Mandal Commission came out with its recommendations. 

 The fact remains that these acts are largely symbolic by nature. But what needs to be asked is whether such symbolic action matters in a world, which is often indifferent to the plight of victims. Jasmeen thinks that symbols are powerful weapons. Whether it is a cluster of naked, screaming women in Manipur, or skimpily-clad girls spray-painting messages in Delhi, acts such as these repel, outrage and grip the senses. Most important, they make people sit up, take notice, and think.

 Make a mark

 The human body is not defenceless. It can even be used to take on the might of the State. And in so doing, it ceases to be a mere symbol. It transforms itself into a powerful tool, which can reverse power positions. The shocking use of nudity by the Manipuri women may have stunned the nation. But it was also an act of empowerment, especially for those who had been rendered voiceless, left without the means to express anger and betrayal.

 There is no universal language of protest though. It is tempered, and often restrained, by barriers such as class, culture and ethnicity. Jasmeen says that although her project generated a healthy response in villages, she is not ready to extend it to rural India yet. It is also quite impossible to imagine women from Indias cities, trying to replicate what their sisters did in Manipur, no matter how serious the offence. 

 The resistance to women trying to find a voice is absolute. A post on Jasmeens blog records how a group of boys, drink in hand, taunted a volunteer who was scrolling a message. At other times, the response is more brutal. A day after the protest at Kangla Fort, the police caned, tear-gassed and fired rubber bullets on women demonstrators in Imphal. Significantly, the resistance can stem from those who are supposed to be the target audience of these unique gestures. Many believe that the efforts of privileged women such as Jasmeen are just another attempt to garner publicity. As if the right to protest rests with the weak and the poor only, and not with educated, ordinary or even affluent Indians. 

 In the course of such an argument, what is often forgotten is that it is important to speak out against injustice, inequality and violence. The perpetrators survive by carefully weaving a culture of shame and quietism. And sometimes, it is necessary to shed clothes, as well as inhibitions, to break this oppressive silence.

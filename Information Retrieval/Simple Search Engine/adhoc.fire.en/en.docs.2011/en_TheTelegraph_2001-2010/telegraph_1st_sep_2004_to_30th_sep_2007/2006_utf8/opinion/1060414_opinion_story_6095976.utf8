The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT BARRED

 Dancing is not a fundamental right, but the women in Mumbai?s dance bars are not the only ones who dance. That would be, approximately, the gist of the Bombay high court?s ruling on the petition challenging the ban on women dancers in dance bars. The Maharashtra government has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court against the ruling. The relief of the jobless women and their employers is tempered by the fear of what the appeal might bring forth. The high court has not seen the women?s case from the perspective of fundamental rights. Instead, it has ruled that the ban on women dancing in bars is discriminatory, because dancers in places like theatres, sports clubs and hotels have not been banned. That is, were this discrimination to be removed in an amended ban, the women in the dance bars and their employers would be back to square one.

 There is more to the discrimination than the technical aspect that the court has pointed to. Moral policing, in which Maharashtra has become adept, necessarily targets the most vulnerable. And the dance bar girls are doubly so: they are poor and they are women, struggling to make a living in a profession that offers a modicum of choice in a ruthless world. Dancing in bars pays well; the sex work is optional. By emerging as their ?saviour? last August, the government pushed many of these women straight into prostitution and some into suicide. There is an alarming confusion that envelops champions of morality. As women?s organizations have asked, why should women who dance in bars be more exploited than those who serve in them? And if the government is so keen to save them from exploitation ? presumably less poor women dancing in well-heeled establishments are less exploitable ? why has it become the biggest exploiter of their helplessness? The legislation wants to prevent ?obscene, vulgar or immoral? dances, which are ?derogatory to the dignity of women?. The mysteries deepen. Who gives the government the right to decide what people should choose for their entertainment, or how professionals are supposed to view their own professions? Why should it impose its own ideas of propriety upon one particular gender? What is the point of such a law and who are its target? It is, of course, pointless to ask such questions of institutionalized hypocrisy. Hypocrisy thrives on confusion of thought, or the unhappy saga need not have begun.

 THE CYNICAL WAY

 gwynne dyer

 I used to know when I was being deeply cynical and when I wasnt, said a friend who made it into London before they closed Heathrow airport for the terrorist scare. Now, I dont. 

 Back in February 2003, when Tony Blair was trying to persuade a reluctant Britain that invading Iraq alongside the United States of America was a really neat idea, tanks suddenly appeared on the perimeter road around Heathrow to guard against an impending terrorist attack. It wasnt clear what they were supposed to do and no actual terrorists ever showed up, but it helped to shape public opinion. So how different is it this time? 

 Hundreds of flights delayed or cancelled. Twenty-four alleged conspirators arrested, many of them described by neighbours as bearded Muslims wearing traditional dress. Shocking revelations that they had a new technique for blowing up to ten aircraft out of the sky simultaneously by smuggling explosive liquids aboard. All cabin baggage banned on flights out of Britain. And in a classic case of panic envy, the US department of homeland security declares a red alert in the US, too.

 Maybe it is cynical, but there are strong grounds for suspecting that this is all a charade. If they infiltrated these terrorist cells many months ago and have now arrested most of the members, then why would they institute drastic new security measures on flights at this point? And did they really only realize in the last few days that explosives come in liquid form as well? 

 After the arrests in Britain, Peter Clarke, head of Scotland Yards anti-terrorist branch, assured the media that during the investigation an unprecedented level of surveillance has been undertaken...The investigation reached a critical point last night when the decision was made to take urgent action in order to disrupt what we believe was being planned. 

 Why now?

 Fair enough, although this is the same organization that took urgent action to kill an innocent Brazilian called Jean Charles de Menezes in July 2005 in order to disrupt what we believe was being planned, and earlier this year shot and wounded another innocent person in London in the course of a raid on a Muslim family in east London based on manifestly unreliable information. So maybe 24 terrorist plotters have been arrested in Britain, or maybe 24 innocent British Muslims with full beards, or more likely some combination of the two. But whatever the truth of that, why the panic? 

 British home secretary John Reid boldly asserted that the main players had been accounted for, and Scotland Yard deputy commissioner Paul Stephenson proudly announced that we are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and commit mass murder. Well done, lads but if you have them all locked up, why are you closing the airports and bringing in all these draconian security measures now? A couple of months ago, when you first uncovered this plot but didnt know all the main players, I could understand such drastic precautions, but why now? 

 Maybe it was those explosive liquid chemicals they were planning to smuggle aboard the planes. After all, its only 160 years since nitroglycerin was invented. Its a mere eleven years since al Qaida associate Ramzi Yousef plotted to blow up 12 airliners flying across the Pacific at the same time with nitro carried aboard in contact lens solution bottles. Who could have foreseen this? 

 They really arent that stupid. They have been checking liquids that people want to carry aboard flights at airport security checkpoints for years. This is all hype, designed to frighten the British and American publics into supporting the wars of their deeply unpopular governments. 

 Or am I being too cynical? Maybe theyre just stupid. I really dont know any more.

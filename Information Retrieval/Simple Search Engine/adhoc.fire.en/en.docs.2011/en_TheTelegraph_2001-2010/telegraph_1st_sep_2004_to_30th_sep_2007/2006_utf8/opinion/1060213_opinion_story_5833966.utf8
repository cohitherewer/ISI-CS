 BAD BOYS FINISH FIRST

 GWYNNE DYER

 ?I became a good man after I?d been a bad man for twenty years,? Uganda?s president, Yoweri Museveni, told the BBC last year, recalling the days when most people saw him as a dangerous rebel. ?When I was a guerilla fighting the regimes, I was always being called...all sorts of names, until my usefulness showed up much later. Therefore if I?m being reviled now, this is one of the phases of being misunderstood because the people have not seen what you?re trying to do.?

 Museveni, who once declared that no African leader should stay in power for more than ten years, is now in his twentieth year as president, and he changed the constitution last year so that he could run for election again. He faces a serious challenge from Kizza Besigye, his former personal physician, but most people assume that he will win another five-year term.

 There is a strong sense of disappointment with Museveni. He took power at the head of a rebel army in 1986, ending twenty years of nightmare rule by two dictators who had wrecked Uganda?s once-thriving economy and murdered thousands of their fellow citizens. Most foreigners had seen him as just another killer on the make during the years when he waged a guerilla struggle in south-western Uganda, but once in power, he convinced them that he was much more than that.

 Early promise

 He won their respect by running a relatively honest and competent government. He invited the Asians who had been expelled by Idi Amin to return to Uganda and reclaim their property. He waged the campaign against HIV/AIDS with an openness that few other African leaders have been able to match.

 Bill Clinton held him up as the leading example of a new breed of African leaders, and Britain started giving its foreign aid directly to his government to spend as he wished, abandoning the usual process of choosing specific projects to support and closely supervising how the money was spent. It seemed that Museveni could do no wrong ? and then he began to do wrong.

 It started with the genocide in Uganda?s southern neighbour,Rwanda. Museveni had given shelter and arms to the Rwanda Liberation Front whose invasion finally ended the killing. The defeated Hutu militia that led the massacres retreated into the eastern Congo, and when it began guerilla attacks from there in 1998 both Rwandan and Ugandan forces invaded the Congo to suppress it. But they stayed to loot the Congo?s mineral riches.

 Turn for the worse

 The result was a civil war that killed several million people. For Uganda it was a huge inflow of illicit funds from stolen Congolese mineral resources, and a huge rise in the wealth and power of the military. Museveni?s Presidential Guard Brigade grew to over ten thousand soldiers, and many of the senior soldiers who had been with him from the earliest days acquired major financial interests whose protection required that Museveni stayed in power.

 Kizza Besigye returned from South African exile in November to contest this month?s election, and was almost immediately arrested and charged with treason, rape, terrorism and illegal possession of firearms.But the high court freed him on bail despite Museveni?s best efforts, and he is campaigning vigorously for the presidency.

 Museveni, however, is expected to win, and much of the good he has done will probably be undone before he finally goes. Already half a dozen of Uganda?s leading foreign aid donors have suspended direct aid to his government.What went wrong was the war in the Congo. Museveni?s senior soldiers have grown too rich and powerful, and in a sense he has become their prisoner. It is a sad ending to his story.

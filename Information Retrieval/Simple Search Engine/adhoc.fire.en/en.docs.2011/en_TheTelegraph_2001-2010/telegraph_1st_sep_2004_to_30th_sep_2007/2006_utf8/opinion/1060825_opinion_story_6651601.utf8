 NO GAIN WITHOUT PAIN

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Why does Sania Mirza never make it beyond the second round? Why do all our sports people fail to reach the top? Why is there no killer instinct except when the police either shoot by mistake or brutalize a crowd of silent, non-violent protesters? From sports to law and order, why does it all seem to be going wrong across the board? Is it because there is a churning that will bring radical change in the future, a change that will take India into a more positive phase?

 Sania Mirza is celebrated before she has made it to the top internationally, which proves how low we are on the tennis ladder. To those following her story, it looks like she is being hounded by advertisers who distract her from the single-minded dedication essential to excel at the game. The belief that hard endeavour makes for an ace, seems to have got substantially diluted. And soon, age and time will pass her by and she will remain the one who, despite having the potential, never quite made it like so many others in the past! 

 Commitment to the task at hand, training the mind and the body for optimum performance, as well as unwavering discipline, are ingredients that are sorely lacking in our scheme of doing things. Tackiness and the absence of quality have become the hallmark of our achievement. What is sad is that we have, in the process of trying to get there, degraded the strengths that made this civilization special. After all, our people did build the Taj Mahal and other wonders of the world. They wove fabrics with extraordinary skill and created magnificent objects of daily use.

 Success story

 Excellence is a dying reality. When you turn on the television you see and hear young, pretty faces speaking badly, mispronouncing virtually every word, speaking as they smile mindlessly at the teleprompter and the camera! No one has tried to teach and train these young people, who are desperately looking for celebrity status without the hard work that true celebrities put in to get where they do, carrying within their person the vast experience. The superficiality that envelops us in all social activity today is suffocating and frightening at the same time.

 When will we get out of the make-a-quick-buck syndrome? We have ingeniously and creatively used our agile brains to beat the over-regulated system and also the hitherto uncompetitive marketplace. We filled the shelves with substandard products because there was neither any norm we needed to adhere to nor any quality goods to compete with at the same price till China came along and took the pants off our entrepreneurs. Competent largescale production of all imaginable products from Christmas tree decorations that have flooded Western markets, to bicycles, crockery and Banarasi silk saris, with unbeatable prices China left the Indian supplier stunned. As India struggled to extricate itself from the bondage of the command economy and find its place in the competitive commercial world of this century, it went through the pains of lifting itself to a basic minimum level of competence. That is where we are.

 There are those who still want to cut corners, make substandard cars, cycles, buses, three-wheelers and suchlike but happily, there are those who have become the patrons of excellence, sponsoring a renewal of the traditional skills for smaller markets. Thereby they keep the arts alive and growing, catering to the new-generation achievers. Consumer goods are taking on a fresh look and superior quality. Stores look different, people are dressing with panache, great weaves are surfacing again, crafts are being upgraded...it is all very positive.

 When will governance be of impeccable quality and when will the politician and the administrator stop letting India down?

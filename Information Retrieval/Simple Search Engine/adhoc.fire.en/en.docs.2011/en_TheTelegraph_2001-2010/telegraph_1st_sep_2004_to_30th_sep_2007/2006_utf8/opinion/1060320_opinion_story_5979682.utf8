 STILL AN UNEQUAL WORLD

 Sudipta Bhattacharjee

 When Wahida Prizm of Rajouri led the passing out parade at the Armed Forces Medical College in Pune, she made headlines for being the first woman officer to do so in the history of the defence medical services. 

 Wahida?s ?achievement? as a role model deserved to be highlighted. Yet such media attention is unwarranted, given the discriminatory attitude towards women in our armed forces. They are denied access to action zones and relegated to commanding parades and operating transport fleet. 

 In the early Nineties, for instance, flying officer Sangeeta Gupta and pilot officer Deepa Nihilwal, both from the first batch of women recruits of the Indian air force, voiced their regret at not being allowed to fly fighter planes or engage in combat. This despite the ability of these young commissioned officers to wield light machine guns, sten-guns and revolvers with the ease and competency of their male counterparts. Very little has changed in 15 years. Despite this, the government has now come up with the hare-brained proposal to induct women into the Border Security Force. 

 These facts came to mind at an international conference at a seaside resort this year. A professor of business management began exhorting the male scholars at the venue to chant ?Happy Women?s Day?. The reactions to her good-natured plea ranged from dour to defiance, and would have left even the eloquent Union minister, Renuka Chowdhury, who, at that very moment, was holding forth on the ?disappearing girl child as an endangered species?, at a loss for words. 

 Invisible faces

 In her annual ?women?s day? report, Chowdhury rued how female foeticide had led to an acute gender imbalance, but chose not to highlight issues such as trafficking, rape and torture. The government has done little to ameliorate the plight of women since infancy ? except ?dedicate? a decade to the girl child, do some gender budgeting and talk of empowerment. Even token sops, like the Centre?s new scheme exempting single girl children from paying fees in classes VI to XII in Kendriya Vidyalayas since this year, awaits implementation.

 In the international arena, United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, marked the day by picking out ?success stories?. The fact that women occupy only 37 per cent of the UN?s professional and senior posts went unreported though. In the 60 years of its existence, no woman has ever been elected to serve as secretary-general, and not for any lack of qualification.

 When Annan?s term comes to an end this year, his successor will be elected according to a tradition by which each geographical region gets a ?turn.? Women, not being geographical entities, never get a turn. Every year, the general assembly dutifully adopts a resolution on the ?Improvement of the Status of Women in the Secretariat,? in which it continues the charade of lamenting the lack of progress and calling for gender balance. We?ve heard it all before, ever since the Platform for Action was adopted at the UN?s world conference on women in Beijing in 1995.

 The US-based NGO, Equality Now, has listed 18 of the world?s competent women in a random sampling as candidates for the post of UN secretary general. In calling the upcoming election to the UN?s top post ?an opportunity to implement the commitment made in Beijing in a meaningful way,? Equality Now has channelized the aspirations of half the world?s population.

 Given the discord already brewing in the UN over Annan?s successor, the move is unlikely to reach fruition. Why can?t we simply dispense with inane annual rituals and allow capable individuals to make their mark irrespective of gender? Women can do without the concessions, thank you.

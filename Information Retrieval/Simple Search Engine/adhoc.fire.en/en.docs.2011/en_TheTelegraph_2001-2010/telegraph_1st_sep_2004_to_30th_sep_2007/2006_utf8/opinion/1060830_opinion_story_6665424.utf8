 Code of conduct

 Sir It is shameful that the Lok Sabha had to witness unruly scenes only a day after members of parliament had voted in unison for a salary increase (Hike in hand, time to hit out, August 25). The drama that followed Prabhunath Singhs remark against Lalu Prasad demonstrates the extent to which standards of behaviour have fallen among politicians. Members of the House not only exchanged abusive words but also came close to trading blows. A Rashtriya Janata Dal MP is even supposed to have hurled a speaker box at a colleague. The fisticuff is demeaning for the august body. Although the speaker expressed annoyance at the incident, the reprimand will do no good unless politicians realize how important it is to maintain the dignity of the house. If they persist with such conduct, they will end up destroying the credibility of the Indian democracy.

Yours faithfully, 

Mohd. Mudassir Alam,

 Sir The Lok Sabha clash on August 24 and earlier violent scenes in several state legislatures are signals that sooner rather than later, we might witness bloodbaths in the House. Stalling of proceedings in the legislature drains the public exchequer. Such waste of taxpayers hard-earned money should be considered a crime and fought in law courts. Only the abolition of the frequently-misused immunity clause that protects parliamentarians from the law of the land can drill some sense into our parliamentarians.

Yours faithfully,

 Sir The RJD show in parliament surpasses the histrionics of Mamata Banerjee who had hurled a sheaf of papers at the speaker last year and the pandemonium that has now become routine. The shocking incident must have reminded many of the free-for-all in the Uttar Pradesh assembly a few years ago, when members smashed tables and turned microphones into missiles which were hurled at opponents. There was a similar incident in the Jharkhand assembly a few months back. 

 It goes without saying that the conduct of the senior parliamentarians was most unbecoming. But what was most pathetic was the speakers performance. Instead of merely condemning the incident and warning the MPs, Somnath Chatterjee should have suspended them. Lalu Prasads apology, followed by the resignation drama of Prabhunath Singh, did not serve any purpose. Although several parliamentarians came forward to calm down those engaged in the brawl, there were several others who sat back and enjoyed the show. Thankfully, the television cameras were switched off when the commotion was at its peak. A batch of school children, meant to view parliamentary proceedings, was also reportedly prevented from entering the Lok Sabha. However, these children, as millions of others in the country, now know about the ugly incident. And expectedly, it must have left a bad impression on their minds about the way the Indian democracy functions.

Yours faithfully, 

S. Balakrishnan,

 Graceless

 Sir Sunanda K. Datta-Ray is right about Indians and new money in Cattle-class anguish (Aug 26). While low self-esteem used to be the hallmark of the urban middle class Indian before the Nineties, the loud confidence today has resulted in traits that are equally disturbing. Indians, for instance, are incapable of standing in a single file, be it at the airport ticket counter or at the bus stand. One often has the door of the movie hall slammed on ones face by the person right ahead. One rarely hears a Thank you from an Indian when the waiter serves food at a restaurant. 

 But the fundamental problem is the greed the new consumer culture has created. A deeper pocket today enables more Indians to enjoy comforts like air travel than was possible a decade back. It has, strangely, bred an arrogance which was not there before. Just the other day, on a flight from Mumbai to Calcutta, the person sitting next to me made a mobile call despite the air hostess having made repeated requests to him for switching off his mobile. The potential of the education system in imparting basic civic sense and decent manners should be looked at carefully. Otherwise, Indians will continue to disgrace themselves at home and abroad. 

Yours faithfully,

 Sir Many Indians who travel abroad, especially in the Singapore and Middle East sectors, lack civic sense. Many cannot even fill in the on-board forms in English. Once, while I was returning from Hong Kong by a Singapore Airlines flight, there was a Hindi announcement during take off, Jameen pe sona mana hai(Sleeping on the floor is prohibited). Perhaps it was meant to discourage overzealous Indians who quickly get drunk and squat or lie on the floor.

Yours faithfully, 

A.K. Ghosh, 

Calcutta

 Sir In his anguish, Sunanda K. Datta-Ray misreads the travelling Indian. Years of colour prejudice and discrimination are responsible for this somewhat rampant behaviour of the desi. Much like the newly-empowered Dalit, the nouveau riche Indian wants to set things right in the way the world looks at him. Why is Datta-Ray so surprised by it? 

Yours faithfully, 

J. Acharya, 

Calcutta

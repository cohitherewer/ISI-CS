The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT THE SAME

 Multiculturalism seems to have its privileged identities. A recent British survey has revealed that Hindus in Britain do not feel good about being lumped together with other ?brown-skinned? Britons as ?Asians?. Eighty per cent of British Hindus would prefer to be called ?Hindus?, ?Indians? or even ?desis?. The confusion of categories that is at the core of such a collective grouse is, at best, bizarre and at worst, dangerous. Asian, Indian, Hindu and desi are not exactly interchangeable categories. They function on different planes and define distinct identities based on criteria that cannot stand in for one another ? race, nationality, religion and nationalist sentiment respectively. The British Hindus who prefer being called Hindu ?or? Indian are therefore identifying the two categories to create a rather dubious identity.

 The report also makes evident that Hindus in Britain feel left out ? ?marginalized? is the proper term ? in relation to what they perceive to be the State?s recognition of Muslims and their politics of identity. (The report is government-funded and has been published in the Commons.) Hence, the defining characteristics of the British Hindu are put in terms that are the opposite of the British Muslim. An eminent and titled member of the former community has described it as ?invisible? because it makes ?few noises when confronted with injustices?, preferring to get on with the business of life ?quietly?. This quietism is perceived to be at the root of their marginalization, depriving them of their ?right? to proper cremation rituals and vegetarian food in hospitals. And this, in a country that is careful to provide halal meat in hospitals. This is a peculiar combination of feelings ? deprivation, resentment, difference and, occasionally, actual physical vulnerability ? that shows up the flip side of the British government?s politically correct anxieties regarding its current multicultural realities.

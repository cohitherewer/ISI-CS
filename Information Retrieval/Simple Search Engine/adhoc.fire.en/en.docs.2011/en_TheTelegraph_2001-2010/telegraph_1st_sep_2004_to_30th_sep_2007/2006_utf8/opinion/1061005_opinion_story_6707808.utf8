 MUSINGS ON THE FRAME

 Malavika Karlekar

 The caption to the photograph in a calendar on the tribes of Jharkhand reads, A Parhaiya man on a typical machaan. The presence of the woman sitting next to him is ignored. And it is also evident that the photographer asked the man to lean forward in his perch. The woman is seated a little behind, her inquiring look somewhat obscured by the fronds that she is weaving. She was obviously not asked to lower them, nor was she asked to sit forward. After all, she was merely incidental. What mattered was that the man, the perceived breadwinner, is in focus, and the caption invites the viewer to train her eyes on him. No matter that the woman is an equal contributor to the family pot, weaves more intricate baskets and works for hours in flooded fields, planting seedlings. A job that men shy away from, fearing the pincer-like teeth of leeches. 

 The patriarchal law of exclusion underlies the caption and hopes to direct our viewing. As it has done for many generations, ever since the camera arrived on the scene in 1849. Yet, today, the photographs many meanings are being unravelled as it is read many ways. It depends on whether the viewer is a feminist, an indifferent teenager or a macho, middle-aged voyeur. A few may be equipped to resist the patriarchal gaze, and others trained to read the micro-expressions caught on film. In 2005, the psychologist, Dacher Keltner, did a series entitled The Secret of the Sexes on BBC One. While on the face of it, his thesis that behind that sugarcoated smile is a story of pain sounds like old hat, another Freudian re-hash, his method of reaching the dark underside of emotions is unique. He believes that in the ubiquitous happy-family studio poses lies another story to be decoded by micro-expressions, those highly significant muscular movements that the camera captures in the twentieth of a second. College photographs of eager young women were often leading pointers to where they were to head to in life; the twitch caught by the camera said it all.

 Many of us will remember thumbing through faded old prints and nodding at the similarity between a favourite aunts downturned lips and her forlorn expression of today. Often these micro expressions are embedded in the rolls of the family camera, informality masking a subsoil of angst. In a startling example of early domestic photography, Vanessa Stephen (who was to marry Quentin Bell) photographed her parents, Leslie and Julia Stephen and her sister Virginia (later Woolf). With a hand cupping her chin, Virginia gazes at her parents, both intent on reading, their faces in profile, heads bent. And who can miss that Julia has tucked herself into the side of the sofa, away from her husband? Or that Virginia looks pensive, almost anxious? She continued to dwell on her parents after their death and they appear as Mr and Mrs Ramsey in To the Lighthouse. Viewing Vanessas insight in capturing her sister in the background corner of the frame and yet so powerfully centred in the intentness of her expression leads us to ask, would Leonard Woolf or Clive Bell have framed the photograph thus? Or, for that matter,, would Vanessa have relegated the Parhaiya woman to the margins? Finally, this brings us to the vexed question: do women read, write and photograph differently from men? Do they have a different aesthetic sensibility or is it just that we are aware today of many different ways of seeing? The woman as object has never failed to fascinate. And now that the engaged female viewers subject position is recognized, photographs reveal power relations, notions of inclusion and exclusion, and the human obsession with boundaries and limits.

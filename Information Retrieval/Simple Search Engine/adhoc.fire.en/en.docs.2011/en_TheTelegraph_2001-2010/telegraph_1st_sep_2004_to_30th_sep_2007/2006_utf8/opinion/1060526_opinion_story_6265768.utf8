 IDYLLIC CITY, WITH VISIONS OF PROGRESS

 GANDHINAGAR: BUILDING NATIONAL IDENTITY IN POST-COLONIAL INDIA, By Ravi Kalia, Oxford, Rs 495

 Architecture is a spatial treatment of time ? a distribution of space which can accommodate heterogeneous time-patterns within the same structure or in the same site. Architecture defines the topography of a place, reflects its history and lifestyle and constructs its collective memory. Yet, as an artistic concept, it has an urban ring to it. Hence the teasing paradox when it is called upon to project the idyllic past of an agricultural country like India in a modern context.

 Ravi Kalia?s book is not on architecture per se, but about the architectural representation of Gandhinagar, which became the capital of Gujarat over Ahmedabad. This is the last of Kalia?s trilogy on Indian capital cities, the others being on Chandigarh and Bhubaneswar.

 Kalia?s study is divided into five chapters. The first is on the making of the state of Gujarat ? the name deriving from Prakrit ?Gujjar-ratta?, or ?the land of Gujjars. The next chapter captures the debate around the choice of Gandhinagar over Ahmedabad because of the former?s ?open agricultural fields?. The main section of the study focuses on the clash of theories which went into the planning of the new capital, which was expected to rival Le Corbusier?s Chandigarh. The mill owners of Ahmedabad, with the support of the Indian architect, Balkrishna Doshi, approached Louis Kahn, an American architect, to build the city. But the negotiations between Kahn and the state government came a cropper. Eventually, H.K. Mewada, an Indian apprentice to Le Corbusier, was entrusted with the job.

 Mewada was a staunch Gandhian though he had the Corbusierian vision of modernism. He tried to syncretize Gandhian traditionalism and Nehruvian secular modernism. This involved a tussle of competing ideals to arrive at an acceptable version of an eclectic Indian modernism, dovetailing modern technology with indigenous methods. Kalia stresses the architectural dilemma to reconcile nostalgia with visions of progress. And it is here that Kalia touches on the problematic of the Indian construction a postcolonial ?self?.

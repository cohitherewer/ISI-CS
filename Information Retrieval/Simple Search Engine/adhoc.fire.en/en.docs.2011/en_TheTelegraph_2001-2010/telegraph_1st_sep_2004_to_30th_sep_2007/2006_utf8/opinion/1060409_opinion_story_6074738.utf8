 GOSPEL TRUTH

 The Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith, as Albert Schweitzer emphasized, are different and apart. Jesus Christ, who is worshipped by millions of Christians across the world, is a figure shaped by myths that originate in the gospels, all of which were written at least forty years after Christ is said to have died on the cross. There is no evidence that the four gospel writers ever knew Jesus in person. But this has never adversely affected the faith of Christians in the Jesus Christ who came to earth, was crucified and rose from the dead to save mankind. The pursuit of the historical Jesus has haunted scholars. Their task has not been helped by the fact that there is very little to go on in the gospels. Even the account of Jesus? last hours differ between the Synoptic Gospels and the Johannine one. Scholars have recognized that in the 150 years after Jesus? death, many accounts were written of his life. There may have been as many as 30 gospels. It was Father Irenaeus of Lyons in the second century who decreed that only the versions of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John would be the approved gospels. All others were relegated to Apocrypha. It was Irenaeus, again, who first mentioned in 180 AD that there was also a Gospel of Judas.

 Now a manuscript of that gospel has come to light. It was discovered in Egypt in the Seventies. The manuscript, in Coptic translation, has been dated to 300 AD. But Irenaeus? reference to it obviously places its provenance further back in time. The manuscript ? or the gospel of Judas ? is about Judas rather than by him. Its existence in the second century AD, as well as several other gospels proscribed by Irenaeus and others of his ilk, suggests that even a hundred years after Jesus? ministry on earth, Christianity had not emerged as a monolithic faith with a fixed set of canonical texts. The life of Jesus and his teachings were a site of intellectual debate in which differing versions and perspectives contested and had their own adherents. What is remarkable is that even Judas, the apostle who is said to have betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver and thus entered the hall of notoriety, had a version to himself.

 The manuscript?s story of Jesus? last hours dramatically varies from the authorized version. According to the manuscript, Judas, when he handed Jesus over to the authorities, only obeyed the latter?s order. An alleged act of betrayal becomes an act of obedience, which allowed Jesus to fulfil the biblical prophecies of saving mankind. This seems to echo the Hindu notion of birodha bhakti,according to which Ravana was Rama?s best devotee since his actions permitted Rama to shine forth in full glory. At one level, the discovery of the gospel of Judas is only of academic interest since it is unlikely to dislodge the faith of Christians. The canon will not be disturbed by a papyrus manuscript.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MOTHER INDIAS PRODIGAL SON

 Bill Clinton steals a chat with him. The British media are eager to adopt him. And his rivals are desperate to beat the steel out of him. Lakshmi Mittal is unquestionably the new knight in shining armour

 Lakshmi Mittals bid for Arcelor, the second biggest steel company in the world after his own Mittal Steel, has ensured that the 55-year-old tycoon is now just about the most celebrated Indian businessman in the world. That was apparent at the Chatwal wedding in New Delhi last week when his arrival provoked a near media riot. 

 The following evening when Bill Clinton made a grand entrance at the final reception of the week-long tamasha held to celebrate the marriage of Vikram Chatwal, son of the New York hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal, and Priya Sachdev, a Delhi model, everyone of the more than 1,000 guests present wanted to shake the former US president by the hand. Clinton, however, cornered Mittal and kept him engrossed in conversation for at least 10 minutes. These days even someone like Clinton recognises that Mittal is Indias rising star. 

 But just how Indian is Mittal? 

 For his part, Mittal has always maintained that he is proud to be an Indian and though his private jet may fly him to three different countries in the course of a routine days work, he is happy to continue travelling on as inconvenient a document as an Indian passport. If Mittals bid succeeds, it will be partly because of the support given to him by the Indian government ? especially by commerce minister Kamal Nath. This will be a little ironic because India has so far not figured large in Mittals plans to create a behemoth capable of producing 100 million tonnes of steel a year. 

 He was born in Rajasthan in 1950 and educated at St Xaviers College in Calcutta (the city which his late mother, Geeta, regarded as home). India is where his father, Mohan Lal Mittal, established Ispat, the familys steel business. 

 I was 26 when my father sent me to Indonesia in 1976 to set up Ispat International and it took 12-14 years of very hard work to build up the business, he has said. I went through great hardship and had to subsist on $ 250 a month. 

 The secret of turning round loss-making plants was once explained by Mittals father: We replaced 60 Germans with 60 Indians (in Mexico). On a particular day, all the Germans were out and the Indians took over. 

 Strictly speaking, India cannot get too entangled in Mittal Steels bid for Arcelor. The former is registered in Rotterdam, the latter in Luxembourg, and so it is one European conglomerate trying to buy another. But the reality is that Mittal Steel has been dismissed as an Indian company ? in the unfortunate words of his rival, Guy Dolle, Mittal Steel is cologne to Arcelors perfume. 

 Such comments have left a nasty smell and brought a whiff of racism. If Mittal was going to be stigmatised in Europe for being an Indian, some influential industrialists in India ? Rahul Bajaj, for one ? announced they were going to lend him at least their moral support. Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh raised the Mittal question with visiting French president Jacques Chirac. Perhaps for the first time in his life, Mittal is starting to realise that it may not be a disadvantage to be a son of Mother India. 

 It has to be said there is nothing Gandhian about Mittal. Not for him an ascetic lifestyle or false modesty about his wealth. Shortly after he shifted his companys headquarters to London at the end of 1995, he was touted by the British media as the the richest Asian in the UK (thereby pushing the Hindujas into second place and irritating Swraj Paul who considered the newcomer to be something of a parvenu). 

 Despite alleged disapproval from Paul, the Labour Party accepted a highly controversial ?125,000 donation from Mittal five years ago. Last year, Mittal gave Labour another ?2 million, inspiring reports that he would be rewarded with a peerage by Tony Blair. This hasnt happened ? yet. 

 By and by, Mittal graduated from richest Asian in the UK to the richest man in the UK to one of the richest in the world, with a personal fortune estimated at well over ?14 million. He attracted a huge amount of publicity when he spent an estimated ?30 million on the wedding of his daughter, Vanisha, in France, and another ?70 million on buying 18/19 Kensington Palace Gardens, London, apparently the most expensive private residence in the world with 12 bedrooms, a swimming pool in marble and space to park 20 limousines. It is here he popped the merger proposal to Dolle over dinner. 

 Since making his bid public, Mittal has handled himself with rather more ?lan than the enemy camp. Even the British media, which previously tended to call Mittal an Indian-born businessman, have now embraced him as a British steel tycoon. British journalists tend to agree with Mittal that a merger between Mittal Steel and Arcelor makes sense. And as for Mittal, he is greatly encouraged by the British backing as he is with that from India. 

 For a man who has long been at the top of his profession, Mittals press conference in London, announcing his bid for Arcelor, was, remarkably, his first in Britain. Compared with the shy Mittal who arrived in London in 1995, this was a seasoned performer who addressed individual journalists by their first names (Patrick, you always ask such difficult questions, he responded disarmingly to one). 

 Realising that the propaganda war is going to be critically important if he is finally to win Arcelor, Mittal also gave a round of interviews in New Delhi. 

 I am very focussed and I have a vision of what I want to do, Mittal once said. 

 In years to come, Mittal may repay his debt to Mother India by ensuring that the land of his birth, which came to his rescue in his hour of need, is never held back for lack of steel.

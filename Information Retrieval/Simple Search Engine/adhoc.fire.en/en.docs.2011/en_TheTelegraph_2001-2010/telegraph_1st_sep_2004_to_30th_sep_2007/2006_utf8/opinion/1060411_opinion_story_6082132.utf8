 OPENING SCORE

 Trade and industrial agreements rarely please all sides involved in them. But that cannot be any reason for not cheering them when they come. For the workers of Dunlop?s factory at Sahagunj, it must be the best time they have had in years. They had waited long enough for the factory to reopen. A number of workers had died tragically waiting for that moment of hope. The agreement on the factory?s reopening should thus be also a moment of introspection for both the trade unions and the new management. It is clear from the terms of the agreement that both sides had to make some compromises. But the details of the deal must not be allowed to cloud the big picture. The unions must accept that they cannot continue with their old practice of using the factory for a phoney class struggle. Industrial production is the result of an economic contract between the employers and the employed. And both must share the burden of the market. The factory?s past woes cannot be attributed wholly either to labour problems or to managerial inefficiency. The decline of Dunlop, once the country?s leading tyre-manufacturing unit, had much to do with its failure to reinvent itself in order to meet the new challenges of the market. A new beginning can be meaningful only if it reflects a new strategy to meet such challenges. 

 There is a larger message from the Dunlop episode that needs to be underscored. The state government played its part in facilitating the negotiations between the unions and the factory?s management. It is not difficult to see the Left Front government?s political compulsions in assuming such a role. It is time, though, that the unions discarded their political affiliations. For politicized unions bring in extraneous considerations to the working of an industrial unit. The contract that the workers have with the management must remain a matter between them. Political overtones to matters of production and productivity are bound to distort the economic character of the enterprise. Politicized labour militancy has been at the root of much of Bengal?s industrial decline. New economic realities have forced the unions to change their old ways. But the change has been slow and often half-hearted. This has been evident in Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s battle with the labour wing of his own party. But the market has no room for slow learners.

 Slip sliding away

 Sir ? Shivajirao Deshmukh, the Maharashtra legislative council chairman, probably thinks that the state government has no better job than to investigate into Carol Gracias?s top slipping at the fashion week in Mumbai last week (?Clothes falling off? Calls for a probe?, April 4). Maybe some other time, at some other place, the act could have been a stunt, but not at a fashion week filled with international buyers, where it would be counted as a serious discredit for the designer. The Union information and broadcasting ministry is better equipped to handle the crisis, since it can prevent the news channels from merrily showing the clips. Meanwhile, the state government can pay attention to the basic needs of the people, such as food, safety, education and healthcare. It is no use preaching morality to people who are hungry and ill. 

 Yours faithfully,

Somak Dutta, Kalyani

 Sir ? The outfits and postures of the female models at the India fashion week were far from dignified. It was evident that many of the bra-less dresses were designed with obscenity in mind. The dress worn by the model, Carol Gracias, which eventually slipped off and caused a furore, was also indecent and provocative otherwise. The way the models are made to exhibit their breasts ? either through transparent outfits or by carefully orchestrated wardrobe malfunctions ? are mostly deliberate. It is shameful how women are used as showpieces on the ramp. The Maharashtra government should look at video-clips of the show, and take action against the designers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? It is shocking that the much-hyped fashion week has turned into a week of sleaze. One wonders how such a big event, involving so many people and much monitoring and huge capital, could be so utterly mismanaged in crucial areas. The dresses ? the actual subjects of the show, have been poorly patched up, leading to humiliation for the models. There should have been proper arrangements for the models to change from one outfit into another. Though such moments of embarrassment are food for the media, using still and moving images of them is disgraceful. Giving front-page coverage to such events has a far-from-positive effect on young readers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recent ?wardrobe malfunctions? at the fashion week shows naturally brings to mind the infamous Janet Jackson bodice-ripping act at the Super Bowl in 2004, which was widely believed to be a publicity stunt. Our fashion designers tend to ape the West but adopt a holier-than-thou approach when a mishap occurs. There are some obvious questions. First, why were most of the models not wearing any undergarments? Second, how can the clothes come apart at the seams all of a sudden, exposing one?s breasts? And why are people blaming the media for the ruckus? No sane person would be caught dead wearing the dresses showcased. The sole aim of such shows is to attract attention, and partial nudity, provocative walks and well-orchestrated wardrobe malfunctions ensure that. The organizers must apologize and see to it that such mishaps do not recur. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Roy, Calcutta

 Sir ? Girls today are bolder than even a decade ago. They are also career-conscious. Glamour is nowadays associated with revealing dresses, which women wear these days with little inhibition. Hema Malini, in an interview sometime back, had pointed out that actresses in her time were careful about camera angles on their body parts. Not so any more. Just as some people have a problem with women wearing daring outfits, young girls too have a problem with those who make a hue and cry about what they should wear. Who is to decide who is right?

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? Sex was, is and will remain the biggest draw for people. No wonder those in the show business always try to cash in on this. Girls too are ready these days to walk topless in front of the camera to draw the attention of the media and public. The two incidents last week in Mumbai are not accidents, as claimed by the models, Carol Gracias and Gauhar Khan, and their designers. Television channels such as FTV are a corrupting influence on teenagers.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The fashion world today is ruled by the seduction- and sex appeal-quotients of the dresses rather than by aesthetic values (?Phew! Fashion slips through?, April 5). But what will happen if sex appeal ceases to hold any charm some day in the future (since clothes which used to be sensuous yesterday are already quite passe)? Can the fashion industry still think up ways to grab more eyeballs?

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? Doubts refuse to go away on whether the recent fashion fracas is an attempt to join the ?malfunctioners? hall of fame, already boasting names like Janet Jackson, Jennifer Hawkins and Lindsay Lohan. However, I would caution my friends against slipping into dresses, which, instead of providing comfort and confidence, slip down without warning, leaving their wearers scurrying for cover.

 Yours faithfully,

Pinaki Roy, Balurghat

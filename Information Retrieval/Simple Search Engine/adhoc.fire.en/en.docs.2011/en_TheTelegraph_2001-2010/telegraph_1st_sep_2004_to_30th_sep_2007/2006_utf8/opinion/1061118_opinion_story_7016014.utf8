The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PRIVATE WALL, PUBLIC SCRAWL

 A very simple point has escaped the authors of the new legislation that will legalize political graffiti on the walls of private houses. This is the fact that private individuals own the houses, and defacement of the walls or any part of the houses constitutes a straightforward infringement of the rights of private property. By the laws of the land, this right cannot be taken away or suspended by any political party or the State. Yet this is precisely what the new law proposes. It seeks to scrap the anti-defacement law as it exists today and replace it with a new legislation which will allow what is euphemistically being called, non-commercial advertisement. For that grandiose term read graffiti or, more elaborately, ugly scrawls propagating the ideology of one political party or the other. Graffiti is not the monopoly of one political party. All political parties merrily deface walls of public buildings and private properties. It is a shame that this violation of property rights will now be made legal by a statute.

 As a concession to property-owning citizens, the proposed law will allow them to complain to the local municipal authority who may then proceed to remove the defacement. Municipal bodies are maintained by taxes paid by property-owners; these taxes will be spent to clean up the walls. The absurdity of this is beneath contempt. It sounds like something in an Eugene Ionesco play. The license to lodge a complaint quietly glosses over another problem. There are areas in Calcutta and other parts of West Bengal which are completely dominated by political bosses and ruffians owing allegiance to one political party or another. Have the lawmakers paused to think what will happen to those who will be foolhardy enough to complain? They will be harassed and bullied; what is worse is that they will have their walls defaced all over again. This will make the entire process of lodging complaints utterly meaningless.

 It is often argued, even by people who should know better, that graffiti represent a publicly mobilized plebeian culture. It is the articulation of popular politics, sometimes gaudy, sometimes ugly, but always vibrant, and is, therefore, a testimony of the working of democracy in West Bengal. Making graffiti illegal is to demobilize this realm of popular politics and plebeian culture. What better evidence of this than the fact that the law against defacement of walls was enacted in 1976 during the Emergency? This argument is spurious, and the reference to the Emergency does not in any way add to its logic or credibility. In a democracy, plebeian/popular culture/politics does not have any privileged place, which is above the rights that have been given to individuals by the Constitution. Political parties are free to engage in any form of culture or politics. But that freedom must stop where the rights of other individuals begin. A law that allows a breach of private property is the first step towards dismantling democracy.

 MAKE FRIENDS WITH THE ENEMY

 India has to persuade the taliban, as well as other warlords in Afghanistan, that its only interest is the development of the nation, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 The death of K. Suryanarayana at the hands of the taliban has once again put a big question mark on the staying power of India in central Asia. But one thing is clear: India?s growing closeness to George Bush?s America means that Indians will increasingly become a target in Afghanistan.

 Considering India has been a centuries-old friend of the Afghans, this is a major irony. India is connected with Afghanistan in fundamental ways that go beyond the mere expression of interest by the two foreign offices. Afghanistan has forever been the gateway to India. Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan?s Pashtuns had wanted to throw in their lot with India rather than Pakistan in 1947, but were dissuaded from doing so by none other than Mahatma Gandhi. 

 So what has caused this cleavage in perception that persuades a section of Afghans ? the taliban ? to make innocent Indians their targets?

 The answer lies in the ?strategic depth? theory that Pakistan?s intelligence agency, the ISI, has continued to perpetrate even after the taliban was ousted from Kabul in November 2001. And despite Pervez Musharraf?s turnaround after 9/11 in favour of the Americans and against the taliban (Pakistan, besides the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, was the only country to publicly support the taliban in power before 9/11), a section of the Pakistani establishment has not been able to swallow the fact that it no longer controls Kabul.

 It is this section that has played a major role in the rise of the neo-taliban. Local Pashtun Afghans, spurred on by their al Qaida mentors and aided by this renegade section of the Pakistani establishment, commonly walk back and forth across the Durand Line. Meanwhile, Musharraf, under constant US pressure to prove his fidelity, sends troops into areas like Waziristan, but to no avail. The taliban has asserted itself so completely as to make life difficult for Hamid Karzai.

 This, then, is the source of Karzai?s anger against Islamabad. In recent weeks, Karzai and Musharraf have exchanged angry accusations ? and denials ? about the fact that Pakistan is ?supporting? the taliban. Since Karzai has been unable to extend his influence beyond Kabul, he remains naturally concerned that the taliban in southern Afghanistan derives its influence and power from a section of the Pakistani establishment. 

 In the middle of this mess, it seems as if the time has come for India to broaden its dialogue with all sections of the Afghan establishment. So far, New Delhi has preferred to speak only to one side, that is the Northern Alliance Afghans, those who fought the talibani Pashtuns when they were in power. The bitter truth is that although the Pashtuns have always been at the centre of power in Afghanistan ? and Hamid Karzai is a Pashtun ? the major levers of influence in today?s Kabul are still held by other tribes. 

 India is seen to be a friend of these ?others?. While that may have been very well during the anti-taliban years, when India, along with Russia and Iran, financially and militarily aided the Northern Alliance, the time has come for India to begin talking to all sides ? including the taliban. Unless the taliban changes its perception about India, innocent people like Raman Kutty ? and now Suryanarayana ? will continue to get killed. 

 India has to persuade the taliban, as well as the other warlords in Afghanistan, that its only interest is the development of a nation that has been ravaged by war over the last decades. It has to show the Afghans that it will continue to build schools (like the century-old Habibia school in Kabul) and roads and computer centres and electricity-generating units. At the same time, it must point out that its growing friendship with Bush?s America will never come at the cost of its brotherliness with Afghanistan.

 Clearly, this is a terrible time for New Delhi. It must show staying power in Afghanistan, the only thing a country with big power pretensions can do, since anything else will be construed as a sign of weakness. India?s return to the fulcrum of Asia after a gap of more than 20 years means that powers inimical to India will make the situation as difficult as possible for New Delhi. The beheading of Suryanarayana, and earlier of Raman Kutty, is an example of this. And yet, by reaching out to its ?enemy?, the taliban, India will have shown that it is willing to be friends with all Afghans, not only those who are of a certain ideological affiliation.

 In fact, New Delhi should explore a whole new Afghan strategy in which none other than Pakistan?s Pervez Musharraf plays a major role. Joining hands with Musharraf will not only strengthen him against those renegade officers who believe in maintaining instability on his northern flank, it may even generate confidence in him to make lasting peace with India on his eastern flank.

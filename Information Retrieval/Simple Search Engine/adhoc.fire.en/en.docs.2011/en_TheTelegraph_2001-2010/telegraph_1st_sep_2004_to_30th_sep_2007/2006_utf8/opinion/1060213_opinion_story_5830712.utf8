 Caught behind

 Sir ? While blaming the Indian team for violating the spirit of cricket, Inzamam-ul Haq conveniently forgets that it is he who, by criticizing his opponents for going by the rulebook, is undermining the spirit of the game (?Code of conduct has been breached: India?, Feb 9). He also forgets the many instances when Pakistanis have committed similar ?violations?. Even in the just-concluded test series, Shoaib Akhtar?s action has been under the scanner, but Inzamam-ul Haq has chosen to turn a blind eye to it. Rahul Dravid has shown great maturity by playing it low rather than blow the issue up into a major controversy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? Why is Inzamam-ul Haq making such a hue and cry about his dismissal in the first one-dayer against India in Peshawar? The fact is that he was out. If indeed certain actions can be said to go against the spirit of the game, then the use of abusive language ? given a veneer of respectability by the term ?sledging? ? by Shoaib Akhtar against Irfan Pathan is one such. And what about Shahid Afridi trying to break the stumps at the non-striker?s end when the batsman is still in the crease?

 Yours faithfully,

Shafqat Sayeed, Calcutta

 Sir ? The comments in the press by the Pakistani cricket captain, after being given out for ?obstructing the field? are surprising. How can appealing for a particular kind of dismissal be called ?unsportsmanlike? when the dismissal exists in the game?s rulebook? Inzamam should ask himself whether he would not have done the same if he were in Rahul Dravid?s place? Moreover, his concern that such ?unsportsmanlike? behaviour at a crucial stage of the game will not be good for the spirit of the series is unacceptable. If he is genuinely concerned, then he should have reprimanded Shoaib Akhtar in Faisalabad when the pacer did not even apologize after hurling a beamer at Mahendra Singh Dhoni which could have proved fatal had it hit the batsman on the head. Neither Dhoni nor the Indian captain had complained of unsportsmanlike behaviour then. Inzamam is not a bad sort, but his boys have a lot to learn about sportsmanship.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? When a controversial character like Moin Khan, who caught Sourav Ganguly off the ground in the Chennai test of 1998-99, writes that ?the Indian team was desperate to win the game [in Peshawar] by hook or crook?, it evokes more than a laugh (?I fear history may not forgive Dravid for unsporting attitude?, Feb 9). The former Pakistan wicketkeeper-captain has a reputation for speaking out of turn and making unsubstantiated allegations. The Indian media should not have given so much importance to his idle rants. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashit Luthra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The way Inzamam-ul Haq got out in Peshawar, and the incidents that followed, were unfortunate. But Moin Khan?s views are both cynical and biased. If he accepts that ?according to the laws of the game, Inzamam was out?, then was he expecting the Indians to stand by and watch in that crunch situation? 

 Yours faithfully,

Mohammad Anwar, Durgapur

 Sir ? Moin Khan clearly has a flair for controversy. But his outrageous statements are bringing the umpires into disrepute. Simon Taufel, who adjudged Inzamam-ul-Haq out in Peshawar, happens to be the winner of the International Cricket Council?s best umpire award last year. Khan?s earlier comment that Sachin Tendulkar?s end was near have also been proved wrong by the latter?s brilliant century in Peshawar. Khan evidently wants nothing more than an Indian team with a sagging morale. But attacks like these will only make our cricketers more determined to beat Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

Kushan Biswas, Calcutta 

 Club class

 Sir ? Calcutta Club has recently run into controversy for inviting the West Bengal governor, but not his wife, to a dinner where women are traditionally not invited. Having recently returned from Santiniketan in the unreserved ladies? compartment, I feel that if women can be granted the privilege of separate space, men deserve the same. A club is meant for relaxation, and if some men feel that they are better off for a few hours without the women in their lives breathing down their necks, I don?t see why there should be so much disagreement about it. It is not as if women are being deprived of educational or job opportunities. In fact, they could utilize the time their menfolk are spending together by making merry in their own club. And not all clubs in Calcutta shun women. 

 The practice of discouraging women from entering the club during the raj possibly stemmed from the fact that most of the officers had left their women behind when they travelled to a city so far away from home. In a volatile political atmosphere, sexist though it may sound, strategies discussed in the club leaked outside (through their partners who were quite close to their ayahs) could prove fatal for the administration. These factors no longer exist. New problems like stress and competition have replaced them. Surely the emancipated Calcutta woman is not dying to be invited by men who would rather be by themselves.

 Yours faithfully,

Arpa Ghosh, Calcutta

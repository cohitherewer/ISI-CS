The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FAST AND FURIOUS

 Kerala bowler Shanthakumaran 

Sreesanth has always been impulsive and 

a fierce competitor

 It was, everybody later agreed, the defining moment. Shanthakumaran Sreesanth who won the Man of the Match award for his eight-wicket haul, scripting resurgent Indias historic first-ever Test win in South Africa at the Wanderers did an extravagant war dance after clouting Andre Nel for a huge six. He twirled his bat frantically and contorted his torso in what was clearly his signature tune. 

 It was a riposte to the snarling Proteas pacers bouncer and verbal volley following his arrival at the crease, a statement of individual and collective intent that a small-town boy could retaliate for his team and that India would stand up and hit back after the drubbing in the preceding one-day international (ODI) series. Sreesanths exuberance even outdid Sourav Gangulys defiant shirt-waving spectacle after Indias sensational Natwest ODI win over England.

 Ironically, the 23-year-old Kerala bowlers greatest moment of glory was tinged with dishonour he was fined an aggregate 40 per cent of his match fee by referee Ranjan Madugulle for provocative behaviour and logo rule violation. It highlighted the chinks in his armour impetuosity and a tendency to be provoked and over react even as he ruthlessly exposed those in the Proteas batting and sent them hurtling to their doom. 

 Sreesanths impulsiveness is not a recent phenomenon. His elder brother Dibusanth, 32, who now runs his own music company, recalled in Kochi, He never liked it when I used to hit him for a four or six. He used to get wild. Dibu used to take a young Sree for his college matches and played a big role in his early development. Big brother was already in a celebratory mood: his wife had just delivered a baby boy.

 The son of Shanthakumaran Nair, a retired Life Insurance Corporation officer, and Savita Devi, a state treasury department employee, Sreesanth was born in Kothamangalam (in Ernakulam district). After a roving childhood, he settled in Kochi at 13 and honed his skills under cricketer Shiva Kumar at the Ernakulam Cricket Club. At 19, he joined the MRF Pace Academy, Chennai, and trained under former Australian pace bowler Dennis Lillee. 

 I knew he would go places from the very beginning. First, because of his action (which drew praise from the formidable South African bowler Allan Donald) and his outswinger, which is lethal, Shiva Kumar told The Telegraph from Dubai, where he is holidaying. Sreesanth, he revealed, showed early promise and began playing in senior club-level competitions featuring top state players, from the age of 15. And more importantly, he was also taking wickets. 

 Sree, it transpires, was hot-headed even then. He was always a fierce competitor, Shiva Kumar recalls. I remember an incident in an under-15 inter-district tournament. When his appeal was negated by the umpire, he snatched his cap back brusquely at the end of the over.

 Sreesanths rise in cricketing stature was meteoric. The student of psychology, who pysches himself up before each delivery, grabbed 22 wickets in his first seven games in his debut season (2002-03) in first class cricket. 

 In 2004, he earned the sobriquet Prince of Hat Tricks after recording the feat in a Ranji game, the first Kerala player to do so. He soon grabbed national attention when he snared the mighty Sachin Tendulkar in the 2005 Challenger tourney. His ODI debut against Sri Lanka in October 2005 and his Test debut versus England in March 2006, both incidentally at Nagpur, were a natural progression. Sreesanth had his moments in the sun in these series and also impressed on Indias tour to Pakistan in early 2006 and later in the West Indies. But in a macabre twist of fate, no sooner did he land an endorsement deal, courtesy Percept DMark, than he was out of the team for the recent Champions Trophy. 

 The ebullient character was also dogged by controversies. He was once accused of missing games for Kerala on the advice of an astrologer. Sreesanth clarified that he was recuperating from injury. His wanton aggressiveness in the Challenger Trophy at the start of the current season also irked some seniors. 

 Incidentally, Sreesanths life parallels as well as contrasts with that of his senior team mates. His mother had to play with her cricket-obsessed child after his brother and two sisters refused to play ball, just like Tendulkars maid used to bowl to him at home. He started off as a legspinner but metamorphosed into a medium pacer, unlike Anil Kumble whose career evolved in reverse. 

 Hes quite a character, he has lots of attitude. International cricket needs such guys around as we are often told that Test cricket is boring, the Mumbai mauler had said approvingly on TV after the Johannesburg Test. Sreesanths raw aggression, action, accuracy, steepling bounce and unflagging commitment also came in for praise from the pundits. 

 However, well-wishers have prescribed caution. Hes a great bowler, but he cannot carry on with his antics. Somebody in the team should take him under his wing and counsel him, advised Mumbai-based Bala Govind, a former Kerala Ranji Trophy player and athletics coach. But Dibu is not unduly concerned. Hes young, hes only playing his sixth Test. He doesnt mean any harm and will learn as he grows up, he countered. 

 Perhaps, the former break dance champions theatrics stem from his love of the big stage, his desire to gain instant recognition. Singing, dancing, acting it all runs in the family. Srees sister, a television actress, is married to playback singer Madhu Balakrishnan. 

 But in the rush of victory, nobodys complaining about his excesses. In Kerala, theyre in fact celebrating. Were all proud of him here, we salute his achievements, gushed his elder sibling. The state, noted for its Ushas, Anjus, Ancheris and Vijayans, now has its own cricketing icon the second native after Tinu Yohanan to play international cricket. Hopefully, young Malayalees will emulate his match-winning feats, not his histrionics.

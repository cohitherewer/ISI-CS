The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

The grand life in art deco 

 The interesting thing about Bindu Manchanda's FORTS amp; 

PALACES OF INDIA: SENTINELS OF HISTORY (Roli, Rs 695) is that it gives 

an idea of these heritage sites as lived places, in history and in modern times. 

Take the picture of the present- day Rathores of Jodhpur, taking a walk in the 

expansive lawns of the Umaid Bhawan palace or holding their birthday celebrations. 

Or that of the curious onlookers, standing amidst the giant green pillars of the 

Amba Vilas Palace to witness the marriage of the current Wodeyar of Mysore. The 

two pictures here are of the finely-crafted corridors of Samode palace (extreme 

left) and the art deco-style royal bedroom at New Palace, Morvi (left), which 

is still in use. The first is a reminder of the grand style in which Indian royalty 

lived, and the second, with its giant fresco by Stefan Norblin, of how self-indulgent 

they remain.

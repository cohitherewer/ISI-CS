 BEYOND THE BRIDGE TO INVISIBILITY

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Sane men and a sinister state get rid of their guilt by making fun of a mad man atop the Howrah Bridge

 Look out 

 A day later, the host of a popular FM radio station is heard asking a young man, a college student, the following question ? ?What should one do in order to become famous?? The student, without a moment?s hesitation, answers that one can win fame by climbing atop the Howrah Bridge. The student and the RJ burst out laughing as the next song starts on the airwaves.

 The two incidents may seem unrelated. Nothing can be farther from the truth though. They point to two different kinds of failure ? the first at the level of the state, the other at a more intimate, even personal, level. Significantly, these twin failures feed on each other. 

 Madmen, beggars and the destitute have always been an integral part of Calcutta, as of most cities around the world. They are a telling proof of the state?s inability to provide economic and social security to its citizens, particularly to those who are underprivileged. But what is worrying is the emergence of a sinister understanding between the state and the individual to rid each other of such deadweight. 

 The communist government here is doing its best to make the poor and the marginalized invisible. That the settlers on the Gobindapur railway colony were ?relocated? in Nonadanga, a site off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, and not in an area which is more centrally located, bears testimony to this fact. Those without a home are regularly picked up by the police before state visits, festivals and other important occasions. The mentally ill and street children are herded into asylums ? away from the public gaze ? that lack the most basic amenities.

 Turning away the attention of the citizens is not a difficult task. Most of us are only too willing to look at other, more attractive, sights: shopping malls, multiplexes and amusement parks that have come to take their place. And if a ?deranged? man manages to slip back into our consciousness ?looking for food on the top of a bridge?, we can always laugh away our guilt on the city?s airwaves, and pretend that we are not partners in a terrible crime.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ALL FOR A GOOD YARN

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Do you actually care ? I?d write give a damn, except that in these contexts one must choose one?s words with caution ? whether or not Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene were, as Britons these days put it, ?an item?? To be exact, since I?d hate to see The Telegraph?s office burnt by enraged mobs flourishing a fatwa from the Vatican, that a work of fiction says they were? The Western world, if you are to believe its media and the ?Da Vinci Code? tsunami that has engulfed them, cares deeply; and now the publishers and film-makers of that slice of airport pabulum hope Asia will care too.

 And Asia seems ready to help. Not just in the Christian Philippines, India, or Sri Lanka, whose government has rolled over to the church?s millennial zeal for censorship. No, even in Pakistan, we Westerners read with amazement, Islamist parties are jumping up and down on behalf of Issa bin Mariam (this Mary being his mother). 

 Peace be upon Him, says I, an outcome unlikely to be furthered by street demos or fasts unto death. But happily words, not business or religion, are this column?s beat, and it is free to regard a work of fiction as fiction, not bonfire material. So do you care? And if so, does this aspect of the book or film make it, for you, a worse one? Or, imaginably, a better one? (And if you know next to nothing about Mary M., rest easy: few Christians know more.)

 I hope your answer is no, and not only because mine is, and would be even if there were a mountain of evidence for the JC/MM theory that has so enriched Dan Brown, author of the Da Vinci taradiddle, and others before him. In reality, there?s not a grain of serious evidence for it, and a few against. But at least it?s not self-evidently barmy; as are other fantasies that inject the bloodline of Jesus into the Dark Ages kings of France, and parade a ludicrous ?Priory of Sion? (plus grandmasters ranging from Leonardo through Isaac Newton to Jean Cocteau!) that supposedly still exists ? in fact, it doesn?t, if it ever did ? and could reveal all, but strangely chooses not to.

 I confess the original fabricators of such pseudo-factual tosh do arouse my ire. But not Mr Brown. Granted, he too claims the supposed Priory as fact. But he?s perfectly entitled (Salman Rushdie should be so lucky) to put out any fiction he chooses and market it, as he has, with enthusiastic aid from the Vatican?s efforts to frustrate him. And how craftily ? here we return from religion to language ? he has done so!

 Look at his title. Da Vinci is a brilliant bait: artist, engineer, inventor, painter of the most enigmatic picture in the Western canon, the ?Mona Lisa?. Imagine a novel called ?The Gainsborough Code? and could anyone care less? But code is the real hook. No matter that the capital M and V supposedly to be found in Leonardo?s ?Last Supper? (a) aren?t there, and (b) might just as well stand for Michael Vaughan as for the meanings Mr Brown gives them. But as he knows, code is to humans what a half-opened carton of cream is to cats. It promises richness, magic ? and satisfaction: ?Read on and all shall be revealed, eventually?.

 Mankind loves whatever lies behind the screen, and authors and publishers love the words that evoke it. Mystery (as in ?...of Edwin Drood?, and endless detective novels) is one such. Riddle (?...of the Sands?) is another, unidentified (as in UFOs) a third. Each year produces some ?Wonders of the Unexplained? for those, like me, who prefer the oddities of nature that science cannot unravel to the routine miracles that it can.

 So let us forgive Dan Brown. He?s produced what any writer of pulp thrillers aims for: one that sells. And yes, in book form anyway it?s a rattling good yarn. Well, so I?m told: I use airports to fly from, or at least to wait in the check-in queue at, not to buy a load of codeswallop disguised as a novel.

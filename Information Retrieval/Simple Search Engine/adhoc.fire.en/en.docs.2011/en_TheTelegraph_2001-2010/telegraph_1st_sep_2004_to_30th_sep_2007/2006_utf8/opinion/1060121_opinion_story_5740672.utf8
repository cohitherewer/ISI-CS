 The other defaulters

 Sir ? The government has launched an advertisement blitz in the media by which children are supposed to make parents feel guilty for not paying their income tax. If the government is indeed serious about netting non-tax payers, it should launch another campaign wherein children of politicians should be made to ask their parents whether they are paying all the taxes, whether they are accepting bribes, encouraging illegal activities or secretly supporting terrorists. If the common people have a duty towards the country, political leaders too have a similar duty to perform. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Harischandra Parasuram, Mumbai 

 Prize performer

 Sir ? It was painful to see the Booker Prize winner writer, Arundhati Roy, turning down the award conferred on her by the Sahitya Akademi, which is known for its neutral assessment of artistic calibre (?Arundhati rejects Akademi award? Jan 15). It was, of course, a matter of personal choice on the part of Roy, but the reasons she offered for the refusal are not convincing enough. Her stand seems like a gimmick to earn some publicity. Would it not have been better had she accepted the award and donated the prize money to a social cause?

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? ?Akademi in rethink plea to Arundhati? (Jan 18) makes it obvious that the stand taken by the Akademi on the issue is more to please her than to honour an author of eminence. It is ridiculous that the Akademi should urge her to reconsider her decision and worse, even attempt to explain to her that the decision about giving her the award was unmotivated. The Sahitya Akademi is an eminent institution and Roy?s acceptance or rejection of the award does not alter that fact. Has the Nobel committee ever explained its choice to awardees? 

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Arundhati Roy has never desisted from raising her voice against social injustice, even at the cost of earning the ire of those in power. Though her detractors might term her refusal to accept the Sahitya Akademi award as a publicity stunt, she is justified in her decision. Writers and poets are often seen to do a volte-face by accepting awards from institutions they have previously spoken against. Such acts tend to erode people?s faith in a writer?s integrity. But Roy has the courage to stand by her values. 

 Yours faithfully,

Atreyee Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Closer look

 Sir ? It is good that questions are being raised about projects funded by Britain?s Department for International Development in West Bengal (?Bengal jobless trouble Britain?, Jan 16). DFID funds the Kolkata Urban Services for the Poor aimed at poverty reduction and infrastructure development in Calcutta?s slums. But recent evaluation of its work has found that not everything is all right with it. It is apparent that the project is being implemented de facto by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which lacks the capability to implement such a project. 

 The Howrah Municipal Corporation does not even have a proper list of the slums in Howrah. Land tenure in the slums of Howrah is governed by the archaic Thika Tenancy Act, which precludes any substantive improvement in the dwellers? living conditions. As a result, illegal constructions are taking place in the slums. Given the lack of political opposition and the absence of any civic concern, there is no public accountability. But the British taxpayers must know what is being done with their money and they should know that their money is being misappropriated.

 Yours faithfully,

 V. Ramaswamy, Howrah

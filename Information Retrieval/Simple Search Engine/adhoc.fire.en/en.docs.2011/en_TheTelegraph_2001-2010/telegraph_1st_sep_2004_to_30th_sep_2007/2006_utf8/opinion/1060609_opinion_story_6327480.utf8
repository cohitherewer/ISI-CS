 ANOTHER FACE

 It now seems possible to think of a Bengal without strikes, the leftist rule notwithstanding. The ruling Left Front?s decision not to call a strike in the state in order to protest against the hike in petrol and diesel prices is no small matter. That it is a significant political development is borne out by the fact that the same leftists have called a general strike in Kerala, where too they are in power, on June 13 on the same issue. In the rest of the country, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has planned agitations, including strikes, on that day. A different stroke for Bengal is thus a major strategic step for the party. It is reasonable to assume that the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had a vital role to play in the party?s decision not to call a strike in Bengal. He has just begun his new term after a resounding electoral victory. That mandate was largely due to his attempts to break free from his party?s old legacy of strikes and other forms of political negativism. The success of his reformist policies, especially regarding industrialization, depends on a changed perception of Bengal. A general strike at the start of his new term would have severely damaged the changing image of Bengal.

 Yet, there is no escaping the hint of doublespeak in the CPI(M)?s strategy. If a strike call dents the party?s image in Bengal, it cannot brighten it elsewhere. It cannot be the CPI(M)?s case that its responsible face should be presented only in Bengal. The decision to organize the strike in Kerala makes the party?s position even more confusing. If strikes are bad for governance, the Bengal example should have been followed in Kerala as well. Such confusions mark the left?s responses to the policies of the Manmohan Singh government. If strikes are bad for the image of Mr Bhattacharjee?s government, the left?s hurdles to Mr Singh?s economic reforms are equally bad for the country?s image. Investors at home and abroad would feel uneasy if the left is seen to hold Mr Singh?s reforms to ransom. More so because the United Progressive Alliance government survives on the left?s support. It is perhaps inevitable that the left would differ with some policies of the government. But the left?s new role at the Centre should bring with it a new sense of responsibility. Mr Bhattacharjee would do well to persuade his comrades that the party cannot carry on with two faces ? one for Bengal, another for India.

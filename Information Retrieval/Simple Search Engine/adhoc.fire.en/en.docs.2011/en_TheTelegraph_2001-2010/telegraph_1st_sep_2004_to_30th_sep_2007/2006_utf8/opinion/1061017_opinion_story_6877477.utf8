 RENEW THE PLEDGE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Delhi has been hugely respectful of the age-old oral tradition the native means of information distribution which modern-day communicators describe as gossip. The most delicious nugget this weekend was that Shashi Tharoor, who will have to give up his work at the UN having lost the race to be anointed secretary-general, is a serious contender for the post of foreign minister in the Indian cabinet. Smart move, if it happens, because it will end personal lobbying with immediate effect, and we can go back to weekly speculation about the next presidential nominee. 

 Our newspapers, meanwhile, can continue to dole out lazily-gathered information, much of it based on daily handouts from various institutions and skimpy investigations, without the fascinating background and data that should accompany such revelations. We have a press that is totally free despite the entertainment and cultural space which is often policed by the state. The press thus needs to take its freedom seriously. It has become deadly dull to find hoodlumgiri, murders and rape dominate the columns and the small screen when much else of consequence is happening around us. In most countries, such revelations are followed up in the city pages and in tabloids, not on the front pages of the mainline dailies. Our readership must be given wholesome and credible information about the metamorphosis that is happening, its consequences, the pluses and minuses, and not just about the shenanigans of the elected few. If the churning that is taking place across this land is written about with some compassion, and, in that context, the misdoings of the bureaucracy and the politicians are revealed, the impact will be great.

 Dishonesty rules

 Freedom of the press also means freedom from the stranglehold of the advertiser, whose interference in the editorial content could be devastating and could well lead to a bizarre kind of self-censorship in an effort to solicit revenue. We can already see how shades of this truth have insidiously crept into the media. Our only hope now is that a new-generation corporate boss will have the intellectual wherewithal and profound social conscience required for strengthening this polity and its ethics and values in an effort to build a powerful and vibrant society. We will be liberated from the stranglehold of government only when the leaders in the economic, cultural and social realms are fearless of the political and administrative bosses. This can only happen when the rules and regulations of normal functioning are rationalized and simplified, as they are elsewhere in the world where entrepreneurship is celebrated and generating wealth is respected.

 Adherence to rules can be effective only if those rules make sense, enhance production of wealth, support civil society and protect the citizenry from the stranglehold of government. Wherever there are addendas in a rule book, there is bound to be rampant corruption. The information in this area of economic activity is vast and replete with personal, real-life examples. Corruption has been a negative leveller but the leadership in this country, over the last two decades particularly, has not attempted to break through the mire in an effort to force the cleansing and the delivering of a better India an India that one is not ashamed of, an India where the greatness of its people is saluted, and its energy harnessed to overcome the humiliation of poverty and deprivation. 

 Honest governance, dispensed with integrity, is imperative , and yet there are no signs of that on the horizon. Will the government at the Centre make that renewal its tryst with destiny in the year in which India will celebrate its 60 years of freedom? The truth is that the capital does not have non-stop electricity except where politicians live!

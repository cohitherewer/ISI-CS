 Letters to Editor

 The argumentative reader

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra paints a doomsday scenario for India by selectively quoting Amartya Sen and combining it with his own loud rhetoric (?Impolite predictions?, Jan 23). While Sen may have criticized the gaping inequality emerging in many parts of the country, he has also gone on record praising India?s economic performance in the post-liberalization period. Sen is strongly supportive of a social safety net and improved public services, but he would allow the market to function, albeit with institutional checks and balances, as in most advanced countries today. Finally, what Mitra misses out about Sen is his staunch optimism about India?s democratic process. According to Sen, the problems of unemployment, corruption, environmental degradation, inequality and the like get more highlighted in India than in other countries because of our strong argumentative tradition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Coventry, England

 Sir ? Amartya Sen is quoted by Ashok Mitra as having said that if the economic trends in India continue in the manner they have lately, then half of India would resemble California, while the other half would be reduced to sub-Sahara. Mitra then goes on to say, ?One is tempted to have his statement slightly amended: the India of tomorrow would be only one-tenth California, nine-tenths would be sub-Sahara.? Mitra?s amendment is, however, not a slight one. Even if one assumes that Sen?s predictions are correct, turning half of India into California is no mean achievement for a country which had no infrastructure to speak of at the time of independence and which had been under foreign rule for hundreds of years. It is not possible to improve the living standards of all people at the same time. Development is a gradual process and some people all over the world will always continue to live in absolute poverty irrespective of the eco- nomic policies followed by their country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ashok Mitra is thoughtful and eloquent in ?Impolite predictions?, but in the land of the argumentative Indian, one need not necessarily agree with him. His amendment of Amartya Sen?s statement may be shocking, but it cannot be more than a conjecture. We still don?t know how things will eventually shape up, what with consolidation in insurance, banking, trade, and foreign ?control? of all these. We tried the path of quasi-socialism, and as Sen has pointed out again and again, we messed it up with the low emphasis on primary education and healthcare. So what is the harm in trying the other route? Maybe we will undergo the east Asian experience ? growth and poverty reduction at the same time. What Sen points out is relevant but instead of striking out at reforms, what we should focus on is reducing poverty and inequality. Mitra should lead the debate away from the same old ?socialism versus capitalism? and ?swadeshi vs videshi? track into more meaningful issues related to how the existing laws and patterns of governance (or non-governance) are leading towards greater inequality and marginalization of vast segments of the population. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jaikishan Desai, Bangalore 

 Helping hand

 Sir ? Dinesh Das, in reaching out to help a dying man on the city?s streets, has demonstrated that there are still some who are capable of carrying out a purely moral act (?Survival strategies?, Jan 15.) But in these days of highly developed communication technology, a person falling ill in a public place should get emergency medical services as early as possible even when conscientious people like Das are not on the scene. Ideally, there should be an easy-to-remember telephone number for requesting such services, and the government should ensure that help reaches at the earliest. We should also make a habit of carrying details about our identity and information about who should be contacted in such an emergency.

 Yours faithfully,

Moni Nag, New York

 Sir ? The way Dinesh Das stepped forward to help Amal Krishna Talukdar shows that the modern youth have the guts to defy the logic of the world and swim against the tide. Thanks to Das for not letting down the youth of Calcutta and for saving the face of the city. 

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? In helping Amal Talukdar, Dinesh Das undertook considerable risk of harassment from both the hospital authorities and the police. Das, in fact, performed the duty on behalf of the policemen who are supposed to take helpless patients lying on the road to hospitals. The police department needs an immediate image makeover. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is not that people on the streets of this state are entirely unhelpful. On October 27, 1993, I was returning home from my office by train from Dankuni, when I suddenly felt an unbearable pain in my chest. My colleague, Susil Chatterjee, took me to a local physician in Bally. I was eventually admitted to the ICCU of SSKM hospital with the help of a social worker from Liluah, Kedar Chatterjee. I am grateful to all of them for coming forward to help me.

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Kumar Das, Howarh

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 It is the Marxists job to say no to every yes. And so it was with the proposal for the MPs pay hike, which otherwise sailed through the House. Typically, CPI(M) members posed to be vehemently opposed to any such move. But the picture changed when the little-known Akali Dal MP from Ferozepur, Zora Singh Mann, came up with his own quaint suggestion. Mann asked for an amendment which would deny the proposed benefits to all members who had opposed the new salary and perquisites. But Marxists, we know, are also typically selective with logic. Which is probably why the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, a veteran leftist himself, found little use of Manns bright idea. Our man from Ferozepur was thus most ungracefully ignored and the bounty extended to the reds who had seen red over the deal.

 A residential welfare society in a posh South Delhi area recently met to discuss the security arrangements and other issues for residents. Its managing committee decided to put up four iron gates to strengthen security. When the proposal was almost passed, a lone voice protested. Heads turned to look at its owner, and its plea that madam may not like it. It was Aditya Soni, career diplomat and husband of Ambika Soni. Is he overhearing too much of his wifes conversation on the phone?

 Down but not out. Madanlal Khurana has been alleging for a while that he has a transcript of taped conversations between the imprisoned don, Romesh Sharma, and his former party colleague, Sushma Swaraj. He also says that the tapes were made available to the government, but the fact was suppressed by the then home minister, LK Advani. An angry Sushma has threatened to slap a defamation case on Khurana. The problem is that it has been more than a month since she issued the threat publicly. Khurana says he is waiting for the legal notice. Has she changed her mind then?

 Something that invariably makes it to the headlines is Sonia Gandhi spending time in the central hall of parliament. Congress leaders, irrespective of their stature, stand up to pay obeisance. And every word she speaks, mostly monosyllables, is lapped up hungrily by the media and the political hangers-on. Some superannuated journos often find it difficult to resist the temptation of giving their opinion on how the party should be run. That is when madam loses her cool and leaves, with a this is not a press conference. But there are also times when she stays back, despite all the jostling, to share a cup of coffee with the fortunate, like Mamata Banerjee the other day. Didi is supporting the Congress candidate in the bypolls in Malda, leaving the BJP to fend for itself. Making headlines, making history as well.

 Those who had thought sanghi M Venkaiah Naidu had got over his penchant for playing with words were in for a rude shock at a press conference on the TRS ministers walk-out. Ridiculing the Congress for its betrayal of the Telengana dream, he said, If there is a will, where is the bill? But he did not spare the Telengana Rashtra Samiti leaders either. They gave deadlines, which only made headlines, he alleged. Not without reason, the Naiduspeak itself made headlines the next day.

 We have another diplomat-turned-writer and international literary award winner in Vikas Swarup, Indias deputy high commissioner to South Africa. Swarup recently won the Boeke Prize for his novel, Q amp;A, which was regarded as a compelling story, yet highly accessible to all book lovers. Does he have plans for bigger things like another diplomat and writer, Shashi Tharoor? 

 All is not well with the South Asian Free Media Association. Journos from Nepal and Sri Lanka have been reportedly complaining to donor NGOs based in Scandinavian countries about SAFMAs preference for Indo-Pak issues and personalities. Critics also wonder why SAFMA office-bearers are not elected through the ballot when its journalists never stop criticizing countries for not practising democracy.

Footnote 

 Is the Congress top brass as obsessed with the K word as Ekta Kapoor? There could be a point there for all the names doing the rounds for the coveted post of the minister for external affairs start with K. There is the Maharashtra governor, SM Krishna, the science and technology minister, Kapil Sibal, the former maharajah of Kashmir, Karan Singh, and the commerce minister, Kamal Nath. The path for the K-guys dont seem to be rosy, however. Krishnas foes in his home state, Karnataka, are not keen to see him through. Besides, there is no Rajya Sabha seat that may fall vacant in the next six months, allowing Krishna to become an MP. Karan Singhs dynastic predispositions may create a problem in his workings as foreign minister, particularly in matters concerning Pakistan. Kamal Nath seems happy with his portfolio for now. That leaves Kapil. But his choice may not please K Natwar, with whom the Congress is unlikely to raise an issue again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Not funny

 Sir ? Considering the ongoing controversy over the Danish caricatures of Prophet Mohammad, there is one aspect of the scenario that has to be highlighted. Reports talked about a newspaper editor saying, ?Just because the Quran bans images of (Prophet) Mohammad doesn?t mean non-Muslims have to submit to this.? Fine, point taken: why should a non-Muslim go by the beliefs of the Muslim community? But can this editor answer a simple question: What public good were Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper under fire, and the other papers which reprinted the cartoons, doing by publishing the cartoons? Did they bring any kind of social benefit to the people or cause a public awakening? The answer, obviously, is no. On the other hand, the cartoons have hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims all around the world. Were the cartoons worth it? 

 And even if making a cartoon of Prophet Mohammed were not offence enough, portraying him as wearing a turban shaped like a bomb surely is? Could it be anything else but an intentional dig at the Muslim world by relating Islam with terrorism? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asad Rauf, Calcutta

 Sir ? Against the backdrop of the strong reactions in the Islamic world over cartoons appearing in a Danish paper, it would be interesting to watch the responses of the politically-sensitive community in this part of the country. Not so long ago, we have seen organized protests against attempts to curb an artist?s freedom to depict a Hindu goddess the way he wanted. With the assembly elections a few months away, will the so-called secular ruling dispensation of Bengal still stand up for artistic freedom, or will selective amnesia on themselves and resort to appeasing the minority community?

 Yours faithfully,

Rajat Chakravarty, Calcutta

 Sir ? Europeans and Americans waste no opportunity to humiliate the poor and non-Christian populations of the world. They like making fun of the latter?s faith as well as their poverty. While most Western countries have condemned this attempt of Danish cartoonists to make a mockery of the faith of billions of Muslims, they have also in a way defended the act by saying that they respect the freedom of expressions of their citizens (?Rift over Danish cartoons widens?, Feb 3). This amounts to rubbing salt on the existing wound of the Muslims all over the world. While a fresh debate may be invited on the issue, the media would still be required to practise self-restraint in their role as mass-communicators. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Freedom of expression should not be interpreted to mean giving people a license to hurt the religious sensibilities of others. The Danish newspaper, Jyllands-Posten, did not do the right thing by publishing cartoons of Prophet Mohammed. However, this shouldn?t have resulted in the kind of violent protests that we are witnessing, since such protests only help extremists consolidate their support. When M.F. Husain painted the goddess, Saraswati, he should also have been sensitive to the fact that Hindus might find his portrayal objectionable. Those who protested against him then should not criticize Muslims now of being fanatics and suddenly become champions of press/artistic freedom. Consistency is important. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 End of the road?

 Sir ? Not many cricketers agreed with the former Pakistan captain, Moin Khan, that Sachin Tendulkar was on his way out. But the fact remains that Tendulkar now makes it to the national side riding on his past glory. He is undoubtedly a great player and his records are proof of this. Unfortunately, age has slowed his reflexes, and affected his legendary hand-eye coordination. Playing international cricket for as long as Tendulkar has is an achievement in itself. But the cricketer should realize that it is now time to call it a day. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shanmugam Mudaliar, Pune 

 Sir ? Moin Khan?s remarks about Tendulkar?s inability to face the pace of Shoaib Akhtar is a sinister ploy to dent the confidence of the little master. It is more a psychological attack on Tendulkar and the Indian team rather than the opinion of an independent and expert commentator. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is time that the selectors relieve Sachin Tendulkar of the pressures of international cricket, and arrange for a fitting farewell for him.

 Yours faithfully,

Soumitra Mukherjee, Pune

 Working rules

 Sir ? Subir K. Kole argues against the legalization of prostitution in India (?To trade in pleasure?, Jan 25), but prostitution per se in not illegal in India. Unlike the United States of America (except Nevada state), one can practice prostitution in India legally, but it has to be done in accordance with the restrictions imposed on it by Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1986 and other relevant legislations. Some of these restrictions (for example, a poor mother living on the earning of her sex-worker daughter can be punished) are very unfair to the sex workers and their family members. 

 Perhaps the term ?legalization? in the context of prostitution has been inaccurately used by Kole and many others in the sense of mandatory possession of work license and periodical medical check-up certificate for practising prostitution, as is the case in Australia and some European countries. Sex workers? collectives in India are, in general, opposed to the introduction of mandatory licensing and medical check-up systems on the ground that it would open up new avenues for their exploitation by the police and medical personnel. 

 The vast majority of existing sex-workers in India were forced into prostitution or were victims of adverse circumstances which pushed them into sex-work. Efforts to rehabilitate them and their children by government and non-government agencies during the last few decades have had very little impact. The demands of sex-workers for the repeal of all legal provisions unfair to them and for their basic human rights deserve support. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moni Nag, New York

 HAPPINESS IS MORE THAN HUGGING A HOODIE

 The challenges of multiculturalism and a changing class system explain Britains investment in a science of happiness, writes Somak Ghoshal

 David Cameron in the House of Commons, 2006

 In the last week of October, a Battle of Ideas organized by the Institute of Ideas was held at the Royal College of Music in London. The topicality of such a battle in contemporary Britain is more than evident. Even last year, shortly after the 7/7 bombings in London, Tony Blair was calling for a battle of ideas that would address some of the challenges multiculturalism, social integration and ethnic diversity which Britain faces at present. Apart from the alarming rise in racial profiling and violence towards ethnic minorities, particularly since 7/7, there has been public discontent over the functioning of the National Health Service, increased taxation and changing government policy on pensions. And then, there was Jack Straw, former foreign secretary, complaining of his difficulty in communicating with Muslim women of his constituency who met him with their faces veiled. Straw unleashed a fresh outburst of angry allegations of racial discrimination. Undoubtedly, this is a grim and unhappy time for Britain.

 Quite pertinently then, among the various clashes that took place in the Battle of Ideas there was one on The happiness trap: promoting well-being or lowering horizons? This question has been around in Britain for quite some time. Richard Layard member of the House of Lords and director of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics had already arrived as the New Labours very own guru of happiness. 

 In his book, Happiness: Lessons From a New Science, Layard declared happiness to be the supreme end of governance. His economics put premium on the happy state rather than the welfare state as the ultimate goal for any government. The economist, Andrew Oswald, also showed in his research that happiness levels have remained flat, while incomes have been rising sharply, that although the majority of people within western societies have become infinitely richer over time, [they] havent become any happier. The pursuit of money, which puts people on a hedonic treadmill, is considered as detrimental to happiness, which is equated with positive psychology and mental health, and not simply with indices of poverty, growth or economic development. Tony Blairs New Labour had taken cognizance of this declining happiness as early as 2002, when the prime ministers Strategy Unit published similar findings in Life Satisfaction: The State of Knowledge and Implications for Government.

 David Halpern, advisor to the prime minister and the author of this document, had gone on to state that within the next 10 years, the success of a government would be measured against how happy it made the people. Further, the BBC, in a survey for the series, The Happiness Formula, televised earlier this year, discovered that the portion of people who considered themselves very happy has decreased sharply, from 52 per cent in 1952 to only 36 per cent in 2006.

 David Cameron, the leader of the Conservative Party, has taken note of these alarming premonitions as well. The public jeering that greeted his answer to the complex challenges of socialization hug a hoodie has not stopped him from correlating happiness with economic policy: We should be thinking not what is good for putting money in peoples pockets but what is good for putting joy in peoples hearts, he has declared. Cameron believes not only that the onus of making people happy lies with the government, but also that education is one of the keys to happiness. This line of thinking has precipitated an educational policy that is driven by the need to spread the science of happiness among the masses, especially among school-goers. Already there are several institutes, with distinctly Orwellian names, devoted to the cause of spreading happiness the Centre for Confidence and Well-Being in Glasgow, or the Institute of Well-Being run by the University of Cambridge. 

 And now, the good cheer is being spread in schools. Wellington College, in Berkshire, was the first school to introduce lessons in well-being and happiness for its pupils from September this year. Under Margaret Thatcher, the Cox Report had tried suggesting ways of teaching children between the ages of five and eleven to spell correctly, and ensuring that they grow up speaking and writing standard English. But David Cameron would rather have pupils between 14 and 16 receive one lesson per week on how to be happy, or in the arts of being positive, stoical, epicurean and philosophically buoyant.

 This radically feel-good curriculum aims to purge all the horrors associated with the institution of the British Public School, which has been historically associated, thanks to classics like Evelyn Waughs Decline and Fall, with pathologically gloomy children, rigorous lessons in Latin and Greek, cold baths, rugby, cricket and, most importantly, with the British class system. With the crises of multiculturalism and ethnic identity deepening in todays Britain, the move towards a democratized education system that would produce a generation of happy students, irrespective of their social standing, seems sensible. It is not just personal inadequacies such as failure to excel in sports that are dealt with in order to foster confidence and well-being. 

 The purpose of teaching happiness is also to ensure that individual aspiration and personal choice are not determined and conditioned by class sensibilities. As Anthony Seldon, headmaster of Wellington College, put it, the aim of this project is to produce young men and women who can go on to university who have worked out for themselves what it is they want to do in life, not what their parents want them to do. All this is particularly telling, since Cameron believes that Blairs government had obsessed about a handful of grammar schools rather than improving the overall quality of education. 

 Happiness is also supposed to liberate the young from the allure of material success, making them realize the pitfalls of human ambition. The yardstick of success must not be premised solely on gross domestic product or GDP but must give way to GWB General Well-Being, to quote Cameron. This compulsive emphasis on the relation between unhappiness and human ambition might eventually give rise to a populace with generally modest expectations. And such an electorate, easy to please, should be convenient for any government.

 And finally, for Cameron, well-being is informed by an individuals surroundings, culture and above all, the strength of our relationships. In concurrence with this latter criterion, social scientists have also concluded from their findings that conjugality is an important element of happiness. Apparently, marriage adds an average seven years to the life of a man and around four for a woman. 

 When marital bliss is turned into a founding element of being happy, and taught to children in schools, it certainly does not help them make up their minds about what they wish to do with their personal lives. Even more serious are the implications of such lessons for children of single parents, who grow up outside the utopian idyll of a happy family that marriage is expected to perpetuate. 

 For this reason, Camerons agenda of celebrating parenthood as part of the happiness formula appears to be unacceptably exclusionist. Undoubtedly, Cameron has had an ideal life so far. Born into a reasonably privileged and loving family, educated at Eton and Oxford, he is finally, after a bright career in government, on his way to the highest office in it. When the rest of the Conservative Party is full of members blighted by scandals, his married life is impeccably clear of any. No wonder that the science of happiness has found favour with a man of his background and social standing. 

 Ultimately, the happiness formula seeks to give rise to a society where people, irrespective of their financial condition, have to let go of aspirations of prospering economically, where chances of happiness are pre-empted for individuals coming from dysfunctional families, and where the state determines how people are to be happy rather than allowing for the individuals quest for meaning in life.

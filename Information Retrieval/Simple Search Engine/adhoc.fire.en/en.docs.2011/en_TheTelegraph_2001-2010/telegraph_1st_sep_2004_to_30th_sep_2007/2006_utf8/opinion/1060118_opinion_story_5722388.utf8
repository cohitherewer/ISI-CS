 HOW TO READ THE SIGNS

 Dipankar Bose

 Something is wrong with the Indian economy. Otherwise, how could the Sensex zoom from 700 to 8000 points in 55 days and then go over the 8800 mark in less than a month, ignoring major negative signs like the soaring oil price, the Mumbai floods, BSE?s warning in the press with its ?Investors watch out? message, and finally the all India bandh in September?

 All the three leading chambers of commerce and industry, the finance minister and the Securities and Exchange Board of India hailed the ?health? of the economy and ?investor confidence? in the market when the stock prices were soaring faster than ever before. The press, however, reported that share prices of some companies with weak fundamentals had risen by over 300 per cent in the last one month.

 Even the stocks of some non-banking finance companies, whose licences had been cancelled by the Reserve Bank of India, were traded and, by end-September, the Sebi cracked down on some Calcutta brokers and barred two BSE companies and 11 brokers from trading in shares.

 Then the inevitable happened. Sensex had a free fall of over 1000 points for three weeks, closing at below 7800 points on October 27 due to profit booking by the foreign institutional investors. The FIIs made a quick buck, thanks to the sharply reduced capital gains tax and the small depositors lost. Intriguingly enough, the authorities maintained a discreet silence throughout the crash. After the deluge, the finance minister advised the depositors to take the inflow and outflow of FII money in their stride. One wonders if he holds a brief for the FIIs.

 Once again, the Sensex is soaring to record levels and the same game is being repeated. Thus, the FIIs rule the market by pulling it up and dragging it down at opportune moments. In such a scenario of conflicting signals from the authorities and extreme volatility of the market, the ordinary depositors only have the mutual funds to put their money in.

 Promises to keep

 This is corroborated by the fact that in the first half of the current fiscal, the net inflow from mutual funds stands at Rs 9,019 crores in shares. This is much more than the total investment by them in the last five years. And even when the stock indices are at their peak, mutual funds are coming out with new schemes.

 But how safe are mutual funds? The Indian financial markets have seen the growth of complex instruments designed to spread risk and increase stability. However, in times of intense market fluctuations, this process could itself become a source of instability because almost all mutual funds offer more or less the same kind of products and they also use very similar probability models for valuation of assets, assessment of future market trends and pricing of products.

 So, they may be in a soup all together when the market goes through a downslide. It can cause the investors to rush to exit at the same time, leading to shortage of market liquidity. And this is exactly what happened in India between 2000 and 2003. In 2001, UTI defaulted its payments and Alpic Finance, the second largest mutual fund in India at one time, defaulted totally. Finally, the government bailed out UTI.

 Even though risk management has improved, the system continues to depend almost entirely on the financial institutions and the government which have ready access to liquidity in times of market stress. Further, most risk management models have not yet been subjected to a live test. So no one knows whether ?the anticipated counter-parties will stand ready to absorb the additional market and credit risks from those who would like to shed it?, to quote the IMF. This point is of crucial importance now that stock derivatives are going to be introduced. Will mutual funds deliver what they promise? That is the question.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Take stock of the forces arraigned against madam. There are already three Jayas Jaya Bachchan, Jaya Prada, J Jayalalithaa who have joined hands in a political confluence that could lead to the formation of the third front. While the modalities are yet to be formulated, a fourth Jaya Jaya Jaitley is said to be waiting in the wings. The ladies are dead serious about the job at hand. Jayalalithaa has already made a visit to the capital, her first since her defeat in the assembly polls in her state last year. But the past is past. Amma, in dead seriousness, is supposed to have informed her compatriots that she is in touch with the TDP leader, N Chandrababu Naidu, who might become a crucial element in the front. But as usual, the left is playing spoilsport. Otherwise, with such star performers, the third front would have been a blockbuster. 

 Together, they seem to be upholding the great Indian guru-shishya parampara. The Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, is supposed to have given his minister of state, Prakash Jaiswal, the right yoga tips. Prakashji, our man from Kanpur, is now happy that he has managed to lose several kilograms of weight with Patils help. According to some, the junior minister, who is undoubtedly a keen learner, is often seen trying to get his yoga postures corrected by his senior. There have been other exchanges. Jaiswal is a man of sartorial taste and, in all kindness, his guru has even lent him his tailor. The camaraderie is quite exceptional. If only the two had shown the same zeal when it came to the ministry they handle together.

 If the reopening of the Taj corridor litigation against Mayavati has soured the Dalit queens relations with the Congress, things may soon change for the better. The Congress-led UPA has set its heart on giving the Bharat Ratna posthumously to the Dalit supremo and founder of the BSP, Kanshi Ram. With Dalit pride propitiated, would Mayavati still have reasons to turn away from Congress overtures in UP?

 Indias growing relations with Vietnam could not make everyone happy. But not even the diehard pro-Vietnam communists of Kerala? Recently, the Kerala CM and the deputy chief of his planning board are supposed to have met the prime minister and expressed their deep disappointment with the growing proximity with Vietnam. What has got their goat is the import of coffee and pepper from Vietnam. Kerala, the red bastion, is the largest producer of these two products in the country, and its economy is naturally suffering as a result. In response to the left plea, the PM is supposed to have given it back to the left in its own language, We must express third world solidarity and improve fraternal relations with Vietnam. It left the commies from Kerala dumbfounded.

 The Rajya Sabha was debating the amendment to the Jallianwala Bagh national memorial trust, which stipulates that the Congress president would be the ex-officio member of the board. Predictably, the saffronites were up in arms, raking up Sonias foreign origins while questioning the wisdom of making her a trustee. Notably, during office-of-profit controversy, madam has resigned as head of the trust. Pandemonium ensued and a senior Samajwadi Party member asserted that if Sonia could be a member of the trust, the same privilege should be extended by rotation to other parties as well. The comment triggered something in the Congress MP, Rajiv Shukla. Interjecting loudly, he said that if an SP leader was appointed trustee, there was a likelihood of the historic bagh being parcelled out to dubious builders for pecuniary gains. The defending party, it goes without saying, did not take it lying down. There was further uproar till the chair managed to restore order.

 Parliamentarians specialize in doublespeak. Take Rahul Bajajs explanation of his stubble. To one fellow member he said that the marriage of the civil aviation ministers daughter had left him no time to groom himself. For another, he had a different answer. You come from Bombay, dont you? You should know that a stubble is the in-thing in Bollywood. The men were found doubling up in laughter.

 His foray into management schools seems to have brought about a profound change in the railway minister, Lalu Prasad. Never was this Bihari found so tongue-tied. Only the other day, a senior MP of his own party, Raghunath Jha, was heard abusing Lalu in the choicest language. The previous day, five companions of the RJD leader from Bettiah had been caught travelling without ticket by a special checking railway squad and were duly penalized. Jha was angry that Lalu had not ensured that his own party members were not set upon by the railways and humiliated openly. When Lalu tried to defend himself, Jha was raised his voice even louder. Apart from accusing Lalu of sending ticket collectors after him, he announced in a booming voice in the central hall of parliament that Lalu would become a cipher if he were to turn against him. There were several witnesses to the incident. But despite the barbs, the minister remained silent. Lalu ban gaya gentleman?

 NO IMPEDIMENTS

 Capital account convertibility is no longer the buzzword it used to be. In the early Nineties, during the heyday of the Washington Consensus, there was an assumption of a natural progression from trade liberalization to openness on the capital account. That was the context in which the first committee on capital account convertibility submitted its report in 1997. It submitted a road-map for full convertibility, with several pre-conditions, such as an acceptable level of fiscal deficit, lower bank non-performing assets and a lower inflation rate. But the Asian crisis intervened and the havoc wrought on Asian economies that had adopted open capital accounts led to a re-thinking among economists of the value of capital account convertibility. India and China were perceived to have escaped the Asian meltdown because they did not have open capital accounts. It was pointed out that China had managed to attract vast quantities of foreign direct investment without an open capital account. Freeing the capital account was no longer deemed to be so desirable.

 In the circumstances, the Reserve Bank of India adopted a pragmatic approach. Faced with a steady inflow of dollars from foreign institutional investment that threatened to push up the rupee, it slowly but surely started liberalizing the capital account. Not only do FIIs, for example, have full freedom to buy and sell Indian equities but Indian companies too can borrow and invest large sums abroad. Scarcely a week passes without the announcement of an overseas takeover by an Indian company. Even Indian residents can now invest up to $25,000 abroad. In short, there has already been a fair bit of progress down the path of opening up the current account, and all that is needed is to keep making these incremental changes. That is precisely what the new committee has suggested. Its approach has been to recommend loosening of the remaining capital controls in three phases ending 2010-11 while, at the same time, building up safeguards that take care of the higher risks arising from opening up the capital account. Towards that end it has recommended strengthening the banking sector on the one hand, and improving supervision and developing new instruments for hedging risks on the other. It has also called for fiscal tightening. In fact, in some instances, the recommendations are retrograde, such as the proposal to ban participatory notes. Based on the committees suggestions, the RBI has now set up a task force to remove operational impediments in the path of liberalization already in place. That is the right approach. While the committees recommendations can serve as a useful guide to the way forward, caution should be the watchword, and the pace of change should be guided by economic conditions and, above all, by pragmatism rather than ideology.

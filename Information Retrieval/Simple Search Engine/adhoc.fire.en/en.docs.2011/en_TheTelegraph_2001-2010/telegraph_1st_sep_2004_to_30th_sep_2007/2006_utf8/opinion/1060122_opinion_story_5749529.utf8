 AN UNHOLY MESS

 Morality in politics cannot be instilled through legislation. Morality becomes part of the political system through years of practice out of which emerges an unwritten code of conduct. This lies at the heart of the most unsavoury and ominous controversy that has erupted between the parliament and the judiciary. The parliament took swift action against the 11 members of parliament who were caught accepting money for questions. They were dismissed from parliament. Eight of the dismissed took the matter to the Delhi high court which has issued a notice to the legislature. The speaker of the Lok Sabha, Mr Somnath Chatterjee, announced on Friday that the high court?s notice would be returned with due respect. His decision was based on the consensus of all political parties. Mr Chatterjee made the claim that the parliament was ?supreme? so far members? behaviour was concerned and that ?no court of law had any jurisdiction in the matter?. This dispute between two pillars of the Indian state ? the legislature and the judiciary ? could have been avoided if, following the highest norms of public morality, the concerned MPs had resigned. But such an exacting standard of morality is woefully absent in Indian public life. This leads to confrontations that are best avoided.

 A number of issues lies beneath the surface of the unseemly controversy. Legislators are elected representatives of the people: they have been sent to the parliament by the people. It follows that they cannot be dismissed from the legislature without the consent of those who have sent them to the parliament. The speaker of the Lok Sabha and other MPs may have slightly overplayed their hand by dismissing the eleven who were caught accepting money for questions. In trying to preserve the probity of the parliament they may have transgressed a very fundamental principle of democracy. Elected representatives of the people are ultimately only accountable to the people who elect them. The question of whether they have broken the law of the land by accepting money for questions is something that can only be decided by the judiciary. The legislature makes laws, it does not judge if laws have been violated. That is the responsibility of the judiciary.

 Another aspect of the controversy is the Indian judiciary?s slow but steady assertion of its own sovereignty. The legislature, in its turn, has been somewhat exuberant in claiming its own supremacy and autonomy from the judiciary. The resultant conflict can only do grievous harm to the checks and balances built into the Indian polity.

 In the absence of a standard of public morality and a provision for the recall of MPs by voters, crass violation of propriety by legislators will have to be suffered. This gestation time may appear too generous but is unavoidable for curbing the activism of the judiciary and the exaggerated claims of the parliament.

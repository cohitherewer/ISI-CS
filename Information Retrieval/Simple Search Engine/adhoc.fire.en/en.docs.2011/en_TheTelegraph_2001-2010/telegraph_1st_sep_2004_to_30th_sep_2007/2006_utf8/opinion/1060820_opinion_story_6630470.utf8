The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Down but not out. And that isnt the only reason why the Congress will continue to worry its head over Natwar Singh. The humbling of the high-profile Jat means his place will have to be filled with another of his castemen, and soon. The AICC gen-sec and media chairperson, Janardhan Dwivedi, and Oscar Fernandes have started the legwork. They have reportedly been speaking to another Jat chieftain, the son of Chaudhary Charan Singh. Madam has apparently been convinced of his usefulness. Unfortunately, Ajit Singh is yet to swallow the bait, and is keeping his options open despite being allegedly offered a ministerial berth. There is even a buzz that he might end up having an alliance with Mayavati in UP. The other larger problem that stares the Congress in the face is to find Natwars replacement in the MEA itself. Among the several contenders for the post, the one sending out high-voltage feelers is the former petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar. And he seems to be using the tiniest cog in the wheel, an AICC secretary who looks after Madams appointments, to hit the goal. In the clash of titans, maybe it will be a persevering ant who will carry the day.

 The Madhya Pradesh CM, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, has gone back to Ram. It was him that Chauhan had turned to in June, when there seemed to be no sign of the rains visiting the land. Chauhan had then organized recitation of the Ramcharitmanas. His wish was more than fulfilled. There was more rain than necessary. Now that there is widespread death and devastation, Chauhan has sought Rams help again. At his 7, Shyamala Hills residence, there is now round-the-clock recitation of the Ramayana. Priests from the temple towns of Ujjain, Maihar, Maheshwar and Datia are taking turns to seek the lords intervention. May god help those who help themselves.

 When a delegation of journos went to Atal Bihari Vajpayee recently to press for a new wage board, AB candidly told them a woeful tale of neglect. Apparently, no one listens to this old man nowadays. Vajpayee went on to name top BJP leaders and then the chief ministers of party-ruled states. Having given vent to his anguish, Vajpayee made a long pause (his trademark now), and then promised the newsmen that he would take up the matter with the Congress president, Sonia Gandhi. Only she listens to me, said Vajpayee. Are the sanghis listening?

 As the elections get closer, the problems seem to be doubling for Mulayam Singh Yadav. At Mainpuri, only days ago, an all-female crowd of college students pelted stones at the CM. He escaped unhurt, but demanded an explanation from lieutenant Amar Singh. The latter comforted him by saying that it was a handiwork of the state Congress chief, Salman Khurshid. Mulayam, however, was unconvinced. If a non-resident chief could organize such a protest, what would his presence mean for the party? queried the CM.

 Not many would disagree that Somnath Chatterjees idea of a 24-hour Lok Sabha channel has been useful, particularly unemployed and retired scribes for whom it is god-sent. Although the Rajya Sabha channel goes off air when the house is in recess, the Lok Sabha one keeps telecasting old footage of proceedings even through the weekends and public holidays. The other day, the channel was frozen hours on end, showing a left member in mid-sentence. The shot gazed on viewers for more than eight hours. Not that live proceedings are any comfort for viewers. Last Thursday, when the Rajya Sabha debated the nuke deal, Kalraj Mishra was found dozing while cameras focussed on party colleague, Arun Shourie, who inconveniently picked holes in the opponents argument. 

 Although there is hardly any CM who could match Bhupinder Singh Hoodas frequency of visiting the capital, there are none like Amarinder Singh, who almost never comes calling. The Punjab CM depends on his finance minister, Surinder Singla, to pay obeisance at the Delhi durbar on his behalf. Not surprisingly, Singla an able politician who has developed the right contacts in the capital and has even gone abroad as Amarinders proxy was asked recently by Congressmen if he had been appointed Punjabs non-resident minister. Amarinder Singhji? 

 It even pays to be a politicians cook, provided 

of course that politico is no less than Lalu Prasad. Naseeruddin, who had spent 

most of his time making sattu paratha for the RJD royalty, recently decided 

to make a trip to Ajmer and duly informed his master, who, in turn, promised to 

make the necessary arrangements. But when Naseeruddin reached Ajmer, the railway 

station authorities refused to provide him any special privileges. No amount of 

flaunting connections did the trick for Naseeruddin. Dejected, our man quietly 

went about his way to the dargah. But by evening, a massive manhunt had 

been launched. There was a non-stop six hour announcement for Janab Naseeruddin 

Sahib, and rail officials despatched to hotels and lodges to find the pilgrim. 

Naseeruddin was finally located, humbly having his roti at a cheap outlet. 

The next instant, he was in AC accommodation at the rail station. Naseeruddin 

is supposed to have prayed hard, more for the Prasads than for himself.

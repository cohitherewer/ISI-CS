 BLASTING THROUGH PEACE

 MALVIKA SINGH

 A colonial power was dismissed from a fragmented subcontinent. The defeated colonial power, aliens with no understanding of the cultural strengths of akhand bharat, brought upon this subcontinent the worst holocaust by partitioning it on communal lines. Having overseen that ?criminal? act, they sailed home to peace, responsible for dividing families and friends. They managed to suck this country dry, exploit it, and left having reduced it to what they referred to as a ?third world? country. We as a nation have not recovered from the character trait that was ingrained in us over many centuries, that of standing to attention in front of the blackmailing bully. 

 Friendly with terror

 The post-World War ll invading power began operations in Hiroshima, went into Vietnam, ostensibly to contain communism, then propped up Saddam and other military dictators, moved to fresh playgrounds in Latin America and Afghanistan, then carpet bombed Iraq on the grounds that they were unearthing weapons of mass destruction. The US ?democracy? has, over the decades, shown itself to be utterly undemocratic in its abrasive military interventions across cultures it cannot even comprehend. It nurtured one part of divided India against the other larger democratic entity. That is the background of India?s new, mighty, rich and undemocratic partner. 

 With the rapidly changing realities of geopolitics, the US has worked hard at bringing the world?s largest democracy into its fold. That ?superpower? needs this country as its ally/partner. India too, needs to partner the US in some areas. India needs to influence, as a partner, the US attitude to diversity in thought and multiculturalism. We need to educate the US on west Asia, Islam, and our own historical and cultural realities. To stand with George W. Bush, hand in hand, with the world in desperate turmoil, and proclaim that ?we will fight terror together? is asking for trouble. What terror, whose terror? Let us not forget the decades of institutional terror that have caused the conflagration of suicide bombs and suchlike, that have disturbed and destroyed civil society, protest, dialogue, all tenets of true democracy. We should be mature enough to partner only what is in our economic interest and stay away from bad international politics. If we do not, India will be used as yet another ?playground? for inhuman assaults. 

 To alienate sections of Indians by endorsing US policy towards the rest of the world is to provoke disturbance of peace. By ?winning? out on the nuclear deal, albeit without the ratification of the US Congress, a gloating India can only make Pakistan uncomfortable, thus diluting the progress of the peace process initiated by both governments. For the US, to turn turtle and dissociate itself from being ?protector? of Pakistan following the ?India Accord? was like adding foreign fuel to a dying fire. India is seen as an accomplice in this. Whether correct or not, it is the perception that matters. Astute politics ? where has it gone?

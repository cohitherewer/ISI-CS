 Willow power

 Sir ? I cannot help agreeing with the views of Ramachandra Guha?s correspondent, Vimal Kumar, on soccer (?On the greater game?, June 24). As an Indian now living in South Korea, I can make a comparative analysis of the two games from an objective standpoint. A cricket match and the whole of India comes to a standstill. A one-day match jeopardizes the normal routine of the day while a test match can keep on hold activities for five days. The South Korean team is participating in the football World Cup. Although they could not make it after the second round, the madness of the enthusiasts during matches is no less remarkable than of their Indian counterparts. But their frenzy does not spill over to the workplace. They do not waste the day discussing the game. And they do not have anything to do with cricket mainly perhaps because of the time it takes to watch the game. Cricket is no doubt a graceful game and this very fact makes it necessary that one should have time enough to watch it unfold over by over. But those who value time cannot love cricket as much as football.

 Yours faithfully, 

Abdus Samad, Incheon, South Korea

 Sir ? Cricket, as we all know, evolved as a pastime of the idle rich in England, who wanted to while away the long summer days in the countryside. Even today it remains an idler?s game. A non-aficionado would wonder at a game that, after five long days of playing in a sun-baked field, can end in a draw. And a non-English-speaking man would find that the game has a strange vocabulary, with terms like ?long leg?, ?short leg? and ?square leg?. Cricket is played seriously only in a dozen or so countries of the world, and all in the former British colonies, while football is a truly universal game. Ramachandra Guha is an old cricket-lover and old loyalties die hard. Maybe a serious watching of this year?s football World Cup can make him change his opinions on the comparative merits of the two games. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha makes a valid point when he says that popularity is not the only criterion of quality. But tastes vary from person to person. One may come up with reasons as valid as those of Guha?s to justify his preference for football rather than cricket. There have been many ?refined? men who have loved football while cricket finds its lovers among many others. Ultimately the question is one of personal liking rather than that of the relative superiority of one game over the other 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I love to watch both football and cricket. But cricket occupies a very special place in my heart. Some of the reasons for this are close to Ramachandra Guha?s. While both cricket and soccer are team games, the former is more individualistic. The special character of the game lies in the fact that it tests the mettle of each person, be it the batsman, the bowler or the wicketkeeper. The person who is most consistent, patient and tenacious is the one who deserves the most accolades. To perform thus, the player needs time, which only cricket can provide. 

 In football, the striker just needs to push the ball, which someone else has steered in front of him, past the defenders into the goal to be an instant celebrity. This is a game that celebrates the moment, and thus would appeal to those who love to live in the here and now. At the same time, the fact that cricket takes a long time is also its greatest drawback. It becomes a bit of a bore when it goes on for five long days and then ends disappointingly. But then, the viewer always has the option of not watching the boring bits and returning when the action gets better. 

 Yours faithfully,

Basudev Roy, College Park, US 

 Sir ? It is indeed true, as Ramachandra Guha says, that the appreciation of cricket requires ?a degree of application and refinement beyond the reach of the ordinary fan?. For this reason, it is not and can never be the most popular sport except, of course, in India. Indians seem especially tuned to the rhythms of this particular game and football can never take the place of cricket in their heart. Friends are made and unmade over a match of cricket and Indians love the game with a passion that is quite unparalleled in other countries of the world. 

 Yours faithfully,

Susanta Ghosh, Calcutta

 Fruits of labour

 Sir ? The price of tomatoes might have risen steeply in the capital but the farmers who produce it hardly get to enjoy greater profits (?Sour taste of tomato economics?, June 26). Tomato growers suffer from perpetual anxiety. The growing season is limited to the months of milder weather. At this time the price of tomatoes plummets because of the sudden rush in supply, causing farmers to lower prices since tomatoes cannot be stored for a long time. 

 In most cases it is the farms producing derivatives from the vegetable that reap the maximum dividend and rural producers suffer from the lack of a fixed price. If the government does not control the price of tomatoes both urban consumers and farmers will continue to suffer as a result of fluctuating prices. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

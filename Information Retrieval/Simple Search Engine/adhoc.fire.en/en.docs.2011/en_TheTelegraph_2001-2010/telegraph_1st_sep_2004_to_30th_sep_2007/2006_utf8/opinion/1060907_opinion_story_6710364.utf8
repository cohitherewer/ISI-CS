The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MUCH WORK, MANY WORLDS 

 Her own tempo

 On the football field or behind a 

 toddy-shop counter, here are some women holding their own 

 against unusual odds

 I have been around since Indira 

 Gandhis time, declared Saleha Bibi, sitting with a natural 

 magnificence on the pavement in front of the Institute of 

 Child Health on Dr Biresh Guha Street. She is very large, 

 very round, and the mighty boom of her voice can be heard 

 almost as you turn the corner. And her beaming smile or 

 her sharp look-over will also be shot at you from that distance. 

 She always exudes a bustling, militant competence and seems 

 to be utterly comfortable in her workplace on the street. 

 She owns and runs the tea-stall on the right of the institute 

 as you enter. To the left is another stall, owned by her 

 husband, Shamsul, mainly selling childrens toys and other 

 things that parents and children might need while at the 

 hospital. Shamsul is a wizened little man, who often looks 

 rather cowed and abstracted. Together, they look like Jack 

 Sprat and his Wife. 

 Shamsul and Saleha Bibis five 

 children all help out their parents, but the centre of the 

 family - in energy, stature and vocal command - is Saleha. 

 Her right hand is her middle daughter, Rongila. In her 

 early twenties, Rongila has studied till class IX (her siblings 

 have all gone to school, but she has studied the longest), 

 and is married to a man who, she and her mother feel, is 

 quite useless at earning money. Every day, before coming 

 to work in her mothers shop at eight, she gives tuition 

 in English, Bengali and maths to a group of children in 

 her neighbourhood. She teaches another little class after 

 she gets back home around nine in the evening. She is confident 

 about being able to finish her Madhyamik in private, but 

 has not yet found the time. Rongila has two toddlers whom 

 she brings to the shop every day. Saleha Bibi looks after 

 them too, with a terrifying attentiveness. Although illiterate 

 herself, she makes sure that her older granddaughter does 

 her homework in the shop after school. Saleha was emphatic 

 about sending the young to school and about inoculating 

 them against polio.

When she says that she has been 

 around since Mrs Gandhis time, what she really means is 

 that they had set up their shops the year Mrs Gandhi was 

 killed, an event she remembers vividly. They are from Murshidabad. 

 She and Shamsul have never gone on holiday. (Her fantasy 

 destination is Rajshahi in Bangladesh, where most of her 

 relations have migrated.) It started to rain while I was 

 speaking to her, and she immediately called one of her sons 

 and asked for the family tempo to be brought over. A bright 

 blue tempo with an open carrier was dutifully pushed on 

 to the pavement by her boys, so that its back stood underneath 

 the shops rainproof roof of plastic sheets, under which 

 her customers sit on wooden planks placed on bricks. Saleha 

 rolled out a tattered madur on the now protected platform 

 formed by the carrier, briskly transferred all the vegetables 

 she was cutting, together with the bonti, and then made 

 herself comfortable on this improvised throne. She insisted 

 that I sit next to her on the tempo and talk to her. Both 

 she and her daughter were evidently much diverted by my 

 questions, and showed no trace of bashfulness or suspicion.

 During their working hours, this 

 entire pavement becomes a busy combination of shops, waiting-cum-refreshment 

 rooms for distressed parents and their squealing children, 

 a family home for the proprietors, a creche for their children, 

 and a communal kitchen in which Saleha and Rongila do the 

 chopping and cooking, and her boys the marketing and accounting. 

 But nothing escapes the eyes of the bibi. After our long 

 conversation, she remembered exactly how many little khuris 

 of tea I had drunk.

 Saleha is thus the hub of a veritable 

 eco-system, within which activities range from the dubious 

 to the indispensable taxi-, auto- and rickshaw-drivers 

 (Shamsul has a rickshaw which he uses to reach some of the 

 CHI doctors home during bandhs), thhelawallahs, Bihari istriwallahs, 

 roadside barbers all go about their work in this teeming 

 little world, but keep coming back from time to time during 

 the day to Saleha, as she keeps multiple transactions and 

 conversations going with all of them. She pays Rs 200 to 

 the police every month, and the whole family has resisted 

 robustly the institutes occasional plans to clear the pavement. 

 Saleha also feels secure for she can avail herself of the 

 medical faciltities of the institute for her brood. Not 

 only does she have the local police on her side, but she 

 also understands the value of political patronage. She told 

 me that she does CPI(M), while she has made her husband 

 do Trinamool, so that between the two of them all the 

 local goons are won over.

 Saleha Bibis sway was most spectacularly 

 proven when my colleague wanted a five-hundred rupee note 

 changed. She immediately took up the challenge, galvanized 

 the entire community on the street, and in no time the right 

 number of hundred and even fifty rupee notes (for the journey, 

 she mentioned) were marshalled, and all the while she had 

 kept up her work and her talk - sometimes raucous and full 

 of giggles, sometimes a vicious scold to her erring grandchildren.

 Saleha and Shamsul also run, at 

 a somewhat exorbitant rate, a mobile phone service for parents 

 without phones. I also noticed how harrowed-looking young 

 fathers and mothers gravitate towards Saleha Bibis indomitable 

 presence - her immense vitality, and her vital immensity. 

 She often lets her shop be used as a kind of cloakroom for 

 these parents, looking after their stuff just as she looks 

 after the cycles and motorcycles of the more powerful on 

 the street. There is something peculiarly comforting about 

 her strength and her comically unassailable confidence in 

 her own usefulness in that grim little world of sick children 

 and their forlorn parents. With her convertible tempo and 

 her devoted brood, she is like a cross between Mother Courage, 

 the Wife of Bath and one of those tremendous duennas in 

 the Arabian Nights. I was talking to a doctor at the institute 

 the other day, who told me about Saleha Bibis legendary 

 appetite for food. It is fabled in the neighbourhood that 

 she eats a whole, big broiler chicken for dinner quite regularly.

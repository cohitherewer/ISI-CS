 HIDE THE GAP

 Corruption and inefficiency in India are crippling hundreds of children in the country and in the rest of the world. So far, the shameful rebuke, from the United Nations and the World Health Organization to Indias health bureaucrats, for repeatedly missing the polio eradication deadline was confined to mismanagement. Western Uttar Pradesh has recently shown a steep and alarming increase in the number of polio cases, and the strains of the virus found there have now spread beyond India to other south Asian countries and to Africa. And India has been justifiably branded as the lone exporter of the polio virus. The causes of this disgrace are man-made, and it now appears that they are far more sinister than mere callousness (which is no less culpable, though, when it comes to crippling children incurably). The failings of the polio programme in many regions in India seem to be the result of a more cold-blooded and systematic suppression of truths and the deliberate disregarding of research findings or experts advice, possibly for the sake of material interests.

 Not only have health workers failed to meet their immunization targets, but fundamentally dubious decisions were also taken and maintained regarding the dosage and choice of vaccine. Many doctors and public-health researchers or workers had independently questioned these decisions, but their findings were suppressed and they were forced to retract their warnings. Of course, only an independent and impartial inquiry can ascertain the exact nature and extent of these practices. But who will conduct that inquiry? Covering up health-workers inefficiency by tampering with statistics has now been established as a common practice within the Indian programme. But if this is compounded with another level of conscious wrongdoing and covering of tracks, or even sheer denial of responsibility, then the situation becomes even more dangerous and disgraceful. Can the state and Central governments be trusted with such a programme, the monitoring of its results, and now a proper investigation of internal malpractice? Contesting claims and excuses abound, and nobody seems to be able to take a definitive and public stand, which either the people or the international regulatory bodies might depend on as reliable.

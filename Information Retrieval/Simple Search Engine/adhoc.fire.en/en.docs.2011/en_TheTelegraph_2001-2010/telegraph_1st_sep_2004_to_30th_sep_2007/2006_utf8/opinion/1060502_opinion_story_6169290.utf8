 HIGH RISK

 Fighting an evil has its costs, but that is no reason for giving up the fight. Four years after the taliban was defeated, Afghanistan remains a dangerous place both for its people and for outsiders working towards peace in the war-ravaged country and its reconstruction. The brutal killing of K. Suryanarayana shows how long and hard the fight against the taliban is. It also suggests that, no matter how risky the task in Afghanistan, it may be far more risky not to carry on with it. A narrowly military approach cannot win the battle against the taliban. A democratic political process and the reconstruction of the country are an integral part of the battle. An evil force such as the taliban can be defeated only if the benefits of the nation-building process reach the common people. The taliban?s dark presence notwithstanding, there are positive signs. In a public opinion poll conducted by the Asia Foundation two years ago, two-thirds of the Afghan respondents said their country was headed in the right direction. They cited three reasons for this ? the end to civil war, the beginning of the disarmament of ethnic militias and international efforts for the country?s economic reconstruction. There still are major problems such as the drug trade and the power of the warlords. But a new age has undoubtedly dawned on the country.

 India has a major stake in a new Afghanistan. If the country had been a breeding ground as well as a training centre for terrorists, its geographical proximity to India posed a major security threat to the latter. The fact that many of the Afghan mujahedin groups had been trained, financed and armed by Pakistan, added to India?s security concerns over Afghanistan. Peace and reconstruction of the country, therefore, are of vital interest to India?s security. The international efforts in Afghanistan provide an opportunity for New Delhi to minimize the security risk emanating from that country. The international community too has to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer allowed to become the theatre for Pakistan-backed jihads aimed at India or other countries. True, New Delhi has to engage in rebuilding Afghanistan and, at the same time, ensure security to Indians working there. Suryanarayana?s killing strengthens New Delhi?s case for increasing its security presence in Afghanistan. There is simply no question of bowing to the taliban?s threats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AYE, EVERY INCH A PM

 In the recent past, as well as earlier, The Telegraph, in these columns, had commented on the prime ministers failure to speak strongly on important matters as well as on his apparent tendency to allow matters to drift. This newspaper demanded that as Indias most erudite prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh should behave like a leader and leave his indelible mark on proceedings. After Mr Singhs intervention in the parliamentary debate on the Indo-US nuclear deal on Thursday, The Telegraph is happy to eat some of its words. For once, the prime minister spoke forcefully and with a scholars cogency. He countered with great effectiveness all irrelevant criticism. Mr Singh is incapable of being abrasive even to his enemies, thus his speech was informed by grace and charm. This mixture of force, logic and good manners made his speech a sure winner. At long last, Mr Singhs supporters and admirers felt proud.

 Nobody denies Mr Singhs abilities to provide proper direction to national life and public policy. He rightly recalled 1991-92 when, swimming against the tide, he rescued the Indian economy from a crisis by freeing it from its socialist shackles. The policy of liberalization backed by a political will turned around the countrys economy. The short- to middle-term benefits of that turn in economic policy are evident in the performance of the Indian economy over the last few years. In that phase too, Mr Singh was the victim of attack from self-styled leftists. This time the criticism came not only from the left that was only to be expected but also from Mr Singhs own constituency which had great expectations from him. There was the niggling fear that he was letting things slip, that his moral authority was being eroded, and there was the perception that he was not his own master. It has taken one strong speech from him to dispel many of these fears.

 There is no denying that Mr Singh is forced to function within certain restrictions. He heads a coalition government which is committed to a common minimum programme. The latter has embedded in it large doses of populism which run contrary to the economic reforms agenda that lies so close to Mr Singhs heart. He walks on a razors edge because his power to be effective can be held to ransom by myopic allies. But this is only one part of the story. Mr Singhs own party travels with a heavy baggage of socialism and populism, the natural camp follower of socialist economic policies. Within the Congress, and even within the Union cabinet, there are elements which are eager to damage Mr Singhs credibility by undermining his policies. These constraints make it imperative for Mr Singh to be more articulate, not less.

 In politics, as Mr Singh well knows, it is dangerous to be good. Nobody wants him to be bad, but only prime ministerial, always.

 SCRIPTED OUT

 If information is power, then the custodians of the Indian democracy are still deeply unsure about how much of both is good for its citizens. Should people be allowed to see their answer scripts, for instance, if they suspect the accuracy of their examination results? Sinisterly enough, the States answer might end up being a No. The Centre has been pondering a number of alarming amendments to the Right to Information Act, 2005. One of these seeks to exclude from scrutiny information concerning public examinations, which would include those held for promotion within public institutions, as well as everything from school tests to IIT or IAS entrance examinations. In a state like West Bengal, where the judiciarys ability to force an examining authority to produce answer scripts in court often brings about dramatic changes in an examinees marks and prospects, such oppressive amendments will certainly strike a special chord of alarm.

 But there is a longer story behind this amendment. A few months ago in Kerala, a postwoman and a railways stores superintendent had individually tried to use the RTI Act to appeal to see the scripts of their departmental examinations for selection and for promotion. The information commissioner had rejected both their appeals on the grounds that such scrutiny would violate the terms of a fiduciary relationship, has no relationship to any public activity or interest, and would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. Their appeals were dismissed as relating to purely personal information. Such a ruling has the potential of setting a rather dangerous precedence, making all kinds of exchanges between a citizen and the State or public institutions fiduciary that is, involving trust in nature. Apart from the absurdity of people invading their own privacy by wanting to see their own answer scripts, the judgment also redefines the distinction between the public and the personal. If the amendment is passed, then such contortions of logic would not be necessary any more. It would be easier then for an information commissioner to let examining authorities get away with inadequate standards and practices of transparency and accountability.

 DIFFICULT PEACE

 To the militants in the North-east, violence is both the message and the medium. The latest series of blasts triggered by the United Liberation Front of Asom carries a disturbing message for the fledgling peace process. The blasts are not just a major blow to the peace initiative; these raise serious doubts about the outfit?s desire for peace. It is morally wrong to argue, as the Assamese writer and chief initiator of the peace talks, Ms Indira Goswami, has done, that the violence reflects the Ulfa?s frustration with the delay in the progress of the talks. In fact, such justifications of the group?s violent methods would make things more difficult for the peacemakers. The latest violence would strengthen suspicions that the rebels actually want to use the peace talks as a ploy. And, such suspicions would lead the government to take a tougher position against them. Thus, New Delhi could read in the violence a very different message from the one intended by the Ulfa. 

 However, neither the Centre nor the state government should see the violence as the end of the peace process. To close the door on it would amount to submitting to the Ulfa?s blackmail. The governments must not be seen as capitulating to violence and threats. At the same time, New Delhi or Dispur cannot afford to let the violence derail the peace initiative. The consultative group that the Ulfa chose to talk to the Centre on its behalf has to play a crucial role in taking the initiative forward. The members of the group also represent the civil society in Assam. They cannot ignore their obligations to the Assamese society at large. Instead of justifying the militants? violent ways, they should speak up against such tactics. After all, the Ulfa is bleeding Assam much more than it is hurting the Indian state. Coming so soon after the Rs 500 crore extortion threat to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, the blasts make it almost impossible for New Delhi to consider a ceasefire in Assam. No responsible government can leave the people at the mercy of an outlawed group. The Ulfa?s mediators have to bring better bargains at the peace table.

 BLOOD WEDDING

 The Lebanese village of Qana is not a place of weddings, miracles and saviours any more. It has just buried 54 civilians, including 37 children, killed by a bomb dropped by an Israeli aircraft. Recently, it has also seen the Israeli bombing of two Lebanese Red Cross ambulances, and the death of a young Lebanese photo-journalist, Layal Nejib. Ten years ago, one of the worst single events of the entire Arab-Israeli conflict took place in the same village the shelling of a United Nations base, killing a hundred civilians. Israel had claimed that this had happened accidentally while targeting a Hizbollah unit. But UN investigators found strong reasons to believe otherwise. Today, four UN observers are already dead, and the existing 2,000-strong UN Unifil troops reduced to passive spectators. Israel has not only vetoed a ceasefire, with the implicit support of Messrs Bush and Blair, but has also widened its ground offensive most effectively, killing twenty Hizbollah guerrillas during fresh incursions in southern Lebanon. Moreover, the 48-hour truce negotiated by Ms Condoleezza Rice to let civilians move out of the war zones has been disrupted repeatedly, causing more civilian deaths. The situation in Lebanon is not just a stalemate, but it is marked now by an escalation of Israeli aggression that renders the possibility of an internationally orchestrated diplomatic settlement increasingly difficult to pull off.

 There are two aspects of the appalling disproportion and illegality of the Israeli offensive. First, the killing of civilians is more than purely collateral damage. Human Rights Watch is beginning to reveal that time after time, Israel strikes at civilian homes and civilian vehicles attempting to flee the besieged southern zone, killing families without any military objective in sight. The extreme endangering of civilians as a deliberate policy appears to be more an Israeli than a Hizbollah ploy. Second, Israel seems keen now to want to deploy the UNs international stabilization force as back-up and mopping-up troops, thereby indirectly co-opting the countries that send them into the war rather than honouring their humanitarian commitment to making peace. So the UN has decided to delay such intervention until it sees enough evidence of political clarity in Israel and the Hizbollah. This is in keeping with its role of watching, in ineffectual outrage, one brutal and unlawful war after another.

 JUST RESEARCH

 The recent decision by Iran to re-start experiments at the uranium-enrichment plant at Natanz will further accentuate Iran?s confrontation with the United States of America. India?s position on the latest move by Tehran should be guided solely by its national interest and not be swayed by ideological considerations. Iran?s decision to resume research work seems to be motivated by a number of ostensible reasons, articulated by Iran?s friends. First, Tehran believes that two years of negotiations with Britain, France and Germany have not brought it significant dividends. Second, Iran feels that it is within its right to conduct research and development work, even as a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and produce low-enriched uranium to be able to benefit from the civilian uses of nuclear energy. Finally, of course, the recently-elected president of Iran, Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, does not want to give the impression that he is buckling under American pressure. The West generally, and the US particularly, is skeptical of such reasoning. It views the decision to remove the seals at the uranium enrichment plant as the first step in a sinister decision to acquire nuclear weapons. It is also being suggested that Iran really does not need to conduct R amp;D for civilian nuclear purposes since Russia has guaranteed at least ten years of fuel for its single existing reactor at Bushehr. Instead, the US feels that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons to follow an adventurous foreign policy that would further destabilize the region and threaten American interests in West Asia. American officials point to the recent statements of Mr Ahmadinejad, denying the Holocaust and seeking the elimination of Israel. 

 The dominant American view clearly sees Iran as dangerous and unpredictable. The reality is probably somewhere in between. Iran does have nuclear ambitions, but more for the purposes of acquiring a deterrent. Moreover, Tehran is probably still a decade away from acquiring these weapons against Israel. An emergency meeting of the board of the International Atomic Energy Agency will, in all likelihood, be convened later this month, and the US is likely to press, as it had in the past, for a referral to the United Nations security council. As a member of the board, India will have to make a decision. This decision must be dictated by pragmatic considerations.

 HARD CHOICES

 When Reliance split, its gas discoveries in the Krishna-Godavari basin went to Mr Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries. It had, however, agreed to sell gas to the power plant that Mr Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources proposed to build in Dadri, Uttar Pradesh. That agreement has been vetoed by the petroleum ministry. Since the agreed price of $2.34 per million British thermal units is far below what Reliance Industries could get elsewhere, the ministrys decision has been seen to favour Mr Mukesh Ambani. Irked by this insinuation, Mr Murli Deora justified his decision that under the governments production-sharing contract with it, the more Reliance Industries charged for the gas, the more the government stood to gain. He evaded a question on whether the government would also reject Reliance Industries agreement to sell gas to the National Thermal Power Corporation at $2.97 per million BTU.

 Since it owns NTPC, the cheaper the gas, the more would the government gain; so Deora would have good reason to approve the agreement. This is only one instance of the conflicts of interest the government faces on account of its ownership of and controls on industries. It owns most of the urea manufacturing capacity and a good deal of power capacity. It subsidizes both; so it has an interest in paying as little as possible for the gas used to produce them. As long as the countrys hydrocarbon production was in public hands, paying less just transferred the cost from one pocket of the government to another basically, ONGC and GAIL subsidized fertilizer and power. Thus, ONGC gets a net price of only $1.81 per million BTU for its supplies to state-owned companies. This regime could not, however, attract private investment. So in its new exploration licensing policy of 1998 the first in a series the government allowed sales of newly discovered oil and gas at market prices. The partial liberalization has been hugely successful; apart from offshore gas discoveries, a number of companies have set up terminals on the west coast and begun to import liquefied natural gas. 

 By next year, private companies will be selling more gas than government ones. But private supplies have been unavailable to state-owned power and fertilizer units, which have faced growing shortage of feedstock. There is no way they can continue to grow under the current price control regimes. The previous government was mindful of this problem; in 2003, it changed fertilizer pricing policy and gave cost-based prices to groups of fertilizer plants based on their feedstock. That policy was a failure; it is up for revision now. If the government can get further feedstock only at market prices, any increase in production will entail mounting losses. Thus, at least partial liberalization of the power and fertilizer markets has become unavoidable. And yet, dual markets invariably lead to leakages and corruption. The government faces choices that become more difficult with every passing day.

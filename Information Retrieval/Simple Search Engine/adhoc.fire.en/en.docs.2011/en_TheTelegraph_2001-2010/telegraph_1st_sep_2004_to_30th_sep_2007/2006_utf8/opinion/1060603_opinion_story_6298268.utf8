 Family and other animals

 Sir The death of three elephants in the Buxa Tiger Reserve after being run over by a train is a pathetic reminder of human callousness to animals (Blood trail on killer tracks, May 29). Such deaths are particularly shameful for a state whose chief minister is a professed lover of nature and his daughter a wildlife enthusiast, who hosts film shows and photography exhibitions to promote the cause of wildlife. Couldnt Suchetana Bhattacharjee motivate her father to bring a law to make it mandatory for trains to slow down while passing through a reserve? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Complete picture

 Sir Ashok Mitra is too blinded by his ideology to understand the strength of capitalism and the weakness of Marxism. In his article, The part is not whole (May 29), he mentions Karl Marx as foreseeing the end of capitalism thus ...the rate of profit will keep declining in a capitalist state until it reaches zero, thereby providing a supplementary reason for the collapse of capitalism. History, however, has proved the contrary. While the much-maligned capitalism continues to flourish, the collapse of communism in Europe and Russia has been a testimony to its impracticable nature. The rigidity inherent in communist theory makes it fail repeatedly, while the flexibility of the capitalist system has enabled it to survive in the face of rapid changes. 

 Mitra makes a hollow claim when he contends that it is the obligation of a committed Marxist to optimize the interests of the working class. The former Soviet Union could not achieve the standard of living of the United States of America even after years of communist rule. South Koreas per capita GDP growth is more than that of communist North Korea. Mitra thinks, Once working men of all countries unite, they will rise in revolt and put a stop to capitalisms strutting on the global stage. This is a clich that has come to signify nothing. The proposed union remains only an ideal possibility, but who will tell this to our communists? Perhaps the greatest folly of Marx was to assume that the working class could grab and retain power. Since power is inextricably linked to knowledge, the uneducated can never be so organized as to lead a country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ashok Mitras defence of Marxism is becoming tiring. So-called communist countries like China nowadays encourage investments from the capitalist countries. In West Bengal too, the government is collaborating with capitalists, taking over agricultural land of the farmers. This, along with the recent modernizing initiatives, would indicate that the original Marxist ideology is much watered down. It would do Mitra good to look up from his moth-eaten books and make an unprejudiced assessment of the changing realities. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The decision of the Delhi government to make the mothers name compulsory in all official documents is a welcome step (Mothers name must, May 24). Though this is a significant step towards the empowerment of women, much more still needs to be done. Women do not expect to be treated specially, but equally. In spite of having an equal, if not greater, share in the upbringing of a child, a mothers name is omitted from most official papers. The child grows up knowing that the mothers position is secondary. Women too need to be more conscious of their rights and fight for them. One can ensure this by making the education of every girl-child the responsibility of the state.

 Yours faithfully,

 Nupur Bose, Calcutta

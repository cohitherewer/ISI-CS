The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letter of consent 

 The day has just started in a post-office in south Calcutta 

 and, surprisingly, the employees are already on their toes 

 because it is the day for distributing pensions. Seated 

 at the far end of a bench, a lady deftly sorts out letters. 

 Her colleagues have already left and she will presently 

 venture out on her daily mission of delivering letters to 

 the households falling within her allotted area. She looks 

 pleased when I ask her for an interview in her capacity 

 as a lady peon. But the next moment, she looks warily 

 around and mutters that she cannot talk unless her supervisor 

 gives her permission. The supervisor, a man, appears out 

 of nowhere and with a definitive wave of his hand rules 

 out any chance of a talk with the lady unless they are 

 prepared. Embarrassed, the lady pretends to be busy with 

 bunches of letters. When the man saunters off, she says 

 in hushed tones that being a lady-peon is not quite unusual, 

 since women are working at par with men in every field today. 

 The profession has its hassles, she concedes, but then, 

 no occupation can be entirely free of trouble. All this 

 time she keeps sorting her letters and suddenly stops mid-sentence 

 as her supervisor reappears. This time, he asks leeringly, 

 Would not an interview with a male peon serve the purpose? 

 The lady looks discomfited but continues with her work. 

 She has started stuffing the letters into her bag. She probably 

 has miles to traverse down the road less taken.

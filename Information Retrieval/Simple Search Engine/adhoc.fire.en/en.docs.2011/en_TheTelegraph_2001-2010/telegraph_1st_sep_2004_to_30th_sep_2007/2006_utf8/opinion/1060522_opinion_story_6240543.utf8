 DON?T SLAM KASHMIR ROUND TABLE

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Come closer

 Some societies excel in sharpening differences, some in suppressing dissent, and others in strict religious or tribal codification of individual and collective behaviour. Democracies must excel in dialogue ? in an open, free and fearless exchange of ideas.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s second round table on Kashmir, to be held in Srinagar on May 25, is a prime example of where India?s core strength lies ? in engaging its people. Critics might argue that the hype and anticipation over who would join the round table and who might boycott it are grossly misplaced because nothing will emerge at the end of it. However, the outcome is not important at this stage.

 The Kashmir issue lends itself to resolution within a very small band of options. No prime minister of India can change the limits of what is politically possible in Kashmir dramatically. Manmohan Singh has made amply clear what he perceives to be the limits of his mandate ? no redrawing of borders and no communal partition.

 The outcome of the process depends not only on the capability of New Delhi but also of the Kashmiris engaged in it. Just as the prime minister of India works within certain limits, there are constraints on what the participants of the round table can or cannot do.

 However, it is precisely this lack of manoeuvrability on the Kashmir issue, which makes the process more important than its outcome. The dialogue on Kashmir is important not because a concrete solution is imminent at the end of it. Its significance lies in heralding the beginning of a structured engagement of the Kashmiris.

 Those who attend it ? whether the Gujjars, the Kashmiri Pandits, the Ladakhi Buddhists, the Kargil Shias, the representatives of political parties or even the separatists -? bring to it their own sense of collective identity. Their political recognition and legitimation as political actors in Kashmir is a harbinger of a political process missing in the state up to now. From repositories of collective grievances, these identities are being transformed into instruments of political representation and redressal.

 Through the process of dialogue not only will the Kashmiris change, the minds of the policy makers in New Delhiwill also be impacted in a positive way. This is something that needs to be welcomed and not slammed.

 The psychological impact of this engagement in Jammu and Kashmir, however slow it might be, can only be positive. The accumulated venom of hatred, of being marginalized and of not being heard , that has been building up in the psyche of the people of the state now has the possibility of being extracted slowly.

 The voice of the Kashmiris will be heard directly by the prime minister, the home minister, the national security advisor and others in New Delhi?s political power structure. Even if nothing substantial comes of it ? and it might be too early to conclude even that ? the process itself will have a beneficial impact on the people of the state.

 The international community will welcome this process. This is what it had been arguing for ? the need to engage the Kashmiris. It would also have a salutary effect on Pakistan. The Kashmiris there ? whether in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir or in the Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan) ? have not been engaged by their establishment in this manner.

 In fact, Islamabad?s approach has been to suppress the voices of dissent in the Kashmir under its control. Whether it is the anti-Basha dam agitation, the massacre of shias, protests that blocked the Karakoram highway for days, the month-long curfew in Gilgit and the inadequacy of earthquake relief efforts in PoK, Islamabad has preferred to impose a media black-out on these developments.

 It is in stark contrast to such policies that the transparent engagement of the Kashmiris by the prime minister directly will have a positive impact even in PoK and in the Northern Areas. In the long-run, this may pave the way for India to get out of its valley-centric approach and engage Pakistan on Kashmir in its entirety.

 Pakistan itself may not oppose the process. Islamabad has realized, after three wars and several failed diplomatic engagements, that it cannot force a resolution of the Kashmir issue in its favour. The wishes of the Kashmiri people alone can provide an alibi to Pakistan to de-escalate domestic expectations about a solution and to dismount from its ?Kashmir banega Pakistan? high horse.

 The change in Islamabad?s attitude is evident. Islamabad used to oppose the Hurriyat engaging with India. For merely proposing a dialogue with New Delhi, moderate Hurriyat leader, Abdul Ghani Lone, was assassinated ? allegedly at the instigation of Islamabad in 2002. At that time, Pakistan?s perception was that such a dialogue would undermine its position with India.

 Contrast this with the present situation. Mirwaiz Omar Farooq and other Hurriyat leaders are meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with the consent of Pakistan. The hardliner anti-dialogue group led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani has fallen from grace. Pakistanis are keen on promoting a dialogue between the Kashmiri separatists and New Delhi while jettisoning their detractors. 

 The Hurriyat itself has changed dramatically. From emotionally charged meetings in martyrs? graveyards, talking of Islamic ideology and extolling the sacrifices of ?freedom fighters?, the Hurriyat today talks of the interests of the Kashmiri people. The gradual erosion of hardline positions and the movement towards a compromise is clear.

 India also stands to gain from the impact that the talks with the Hurriyat and other separatist leaders like Yasin Malik and Shabbir Shah might have on the militant umbrella organization, the Muttahida Jihad Council based in Pakistan. Already there are muted signals that some of the militant outfits want to join the dialogue process with India. The momentum of the Kashmiri engagement with the prime minister would act as additional pressure on them to do so. In a year or two, they too can join the dialogue process.

 If they refuse to talk at all, then there is all the more reason for India to continue the engagement with those who want to be a part of the solution in Kashmir. If the militants step up violence, in the present circumstances, this may end up alienating the local population thereby increasing the constituency for peace.

 It is true that the Kashmir dialogue is being carried out through two forums ? the round table and direct meetings with the prime minister. This has created some heartburn among the Kashmiris. There have been allegations of favouritism. However, at a time when it is not clear what an acceptable solution might be and what New Delhi is capable of giving, there is no need to bring Kashmiris of all political hues under a single umbrella.

 The different strands of the dialogue process can, in fact, offer an opportunity to evolve a consensus through competitive bidding for peace. This may be better than a single hard-line position emerging out of a single forum. The need to encourage a collective leadership will arise only when the broad contours of the solution on offer are clear. At that point it would make greater sense to have a single forum for dialogue.

 BEYOND CREDIT

 Much attention has been focused on the relief package that the prime minister has announced for the Vidarbha farmers after his visit to the region. The package includes complete interest waiver to farmers, fresh credit in the current sowing season and rescheduling of loans. But while these measures will do much to alleviate the immediate distress and stop the mounting suicide-count in the area, it is the other parts of the package that will be more effective in the longer term. These promises include a three-year programme to complete 82 pending irrigation projects, which will irrigate 1.59 lakh hectares of land. Mr Manmohan Singh also announced a series of measures to strengthen farmers financially by offering them incentives for taking up horticulture and poultry, dairy and fisheries businesses.

 The immediate problem that drives farmers to suicide is indebtedness. Allowing debt relief and giving them access to new loans will therefore take care of their most pressing needs. But once that is done, the reasons behind the rising indebtedness also need to be addressed. In Vidarbha, the problem is closely linked to low cotton prices, rising input costs, corruption, mismanagement and lack of funds in the government?s cotton procurement agency. Reports say, for instance, that the government does not pay immediately for the cotton bought and that traders take advantage of this to buy cotton at lower prices from the farmers and then sell it to the government procurement agency at the higher price. 

 The larger issue, however, is the under-investment in agriculture. Instead of making strategic investments in agriculture, the limited resources of the government are frittered away in subsidies. Investments in irrigation, for example, have been woefully inadequate. After the Green Revolution, the benefits of agricultural research too have tapered off. India invests about 0.5 per cent of its agricultural gross domestic product in agricultural research, compared with 0.7 per cent in developing countries and 2 to 3 per cent in the developed world. Marketing chains are highly fragmented, often including six to eight intermediaries. Rural road and transport infrastructure remains poor and relatively costly. And because markets are inefficient, farmers tend to receive a small share of the consumer price. The result is poor productivity. Indian farmers produce a little more than 2.9 metric tons of rice on a hectare of land ? lower than farmers in Bangladesh and Myanmar. In wheat, India?s crop yield is 29 percent lower than in China. Thus the key to resolving the crisis in agriculture lies not in more credit, but in improving agricultural productivity on the one hand and in creating non-agricultural jobs on the other.

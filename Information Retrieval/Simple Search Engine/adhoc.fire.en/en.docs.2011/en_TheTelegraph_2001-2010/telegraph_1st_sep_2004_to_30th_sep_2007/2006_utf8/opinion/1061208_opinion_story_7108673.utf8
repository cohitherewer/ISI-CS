 Stitch in 

time

 Malvika Singh

 The other day, a successful and accomplished young professional was asked which foreign university he had attended. His reply was quite remarkable. He said that he was not the son of a senior bureaucrat or a corporate honcho and, therefore, could not afford to pay for higher education overseas. The answer spoke volumes about the hypocrisies that dominate our lives. Honest, tax-paying citizens, who do not break the archaic and foolish rules and work within the ghastly constraints that tie them in knots, are forever made to face questions by the babu for all kinds of silly things why did they withdraw more than X amount of money from their legitimate and declared bank account for buying goods and services and so on. Those same babus need to be asked how their children are paying for their education abroad, how can they afford to pay rent, buy food and clothes, et al, in expensive continents where the rupee can get you next to nothing. It is time the government examined the activities of the babus first, before harassing straightforward citizens. This should be one of the resolutions of the prime minister as we move into another year of UPA rule.

 With the courts taking on a proactive role, it is imperative that corruption be prevented from entering the hallowed portals of the judiciary. It is time to ensure that only the squeaky clean, the best and the brightest make it to any exalted executive, judicial and political position. The United Progressive Alliance under Manmohan Singh and the single largest party in the coalition led by Sonia Gandhi, both immensely upright professionals, must not bow under bureaucratic and other pressures to accelerate the cleansing process. 

 Perform or perish

 Here is a scary proposition: we could be stuck with a chief justice, a revenue minister or secretary, a chief of the excise and tax department, a police chief people who are responsible for upholding the law lacking qualities such as probity and integrity. This could have terrible repercussions on the functioning of the institutions that govern us. It could trigger the worst and uncontainable slew of personal, political and professional vendettas. It has been known to happen with alarming regularity in recent decades, accelerating with every passing month. Therefore, the right person in the right place is critical to reform corrupt practices. We need the fearless men and women in the service, who are not motivated by greed and power but are excited by the challenge to bring change and growth at all levels. An overhaul of the key people including some self-serving babus, is imperative to ensure that the government is committed to bring in corrective measures.

 Without this primary agenda, India will slide even more rapidly into uncontrollable anarchy despite the much touted rate of growth. We are no longer a lazy, lethargic, unquestioning society. The fabric has changed and the young aspiring Indian will not be exploited any more. Demands will be made and if the structures do not change and become inclusive sans bribery and corruption, all hell would break loose. Societal upheavals would definitely diminish the hitherto marginal impact of the fast rate of growth, which has become the slogan of this particular government, much like the India Shining campaign of the National Democratic Alliance.

 When governments are unwilling to listen and absorb what the voices outside their security ridden and therefore isolated space are saying, it heralds the beginning of the end of a term. Today there is still time for the UPA to assess itself. The prime minister needs to assess his teams performance in a ruthless manner, without bothering to take notice of the personal predilections that tend to come into play.

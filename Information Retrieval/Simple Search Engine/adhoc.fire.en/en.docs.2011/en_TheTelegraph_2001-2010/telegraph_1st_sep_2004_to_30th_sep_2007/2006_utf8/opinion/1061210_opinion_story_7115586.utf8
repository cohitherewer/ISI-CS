 Letters to Editor

 Troubled by security

 Sir The city police throws a blanket of security around any dignitary visiting Calcutta. Because of resultant traffic diversions, patients cannot reach hospitals and students their schools and colleges. If the man on the street has to grapple with such harassment every other day, then well-meaning dignitaries should seriously consider transacting the bulk of their business via telephone or other modes of communication. Can we then blame students and IT professionals looking towards distant shores for a better quality of life?

 Yours faithfully,

 Abhijit Sen, 

 Calcutta

 Out of the dock

 Sir Those who had scripted Shoaib Akhtars obituary will now have to eat their words (Shoaib, Asif cleared of doping charges, Dec 6). It is true that the players are seldom cautioned against dietary supplements containing banned steroids. The Pakistani pacers must have fallen into a similar situation. The incident is a pointer to the lack of awareness about banned drugs in the Pakistan Cricket Board in particular, and the subcontinent in general. Why should players have to pay the price for such ignorance and mismanagement on the part of their countrys cricket administration? The return of Akhtar and Mohammed Asif should serve as a warning for the cricket boards to be more vigilant in future.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayajit Dash, 

 Dhenkanal, Orissa

 Sir It is great news that Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif have been cleared of the doping charges against them. Akhtar, whose bad boy image seems to have stuck to him, has clearly been made a scapegoat. If he chooses to lead a fast life off the field, it is entirely his business, as long as it does not affect his professionalism on the field. Asif too has already proved himself to be a promising cricketer. The earlier tribunal which pronounced life bans on the two cricketers was a bit too harsh, since the decision would have summarily ended two promising careers. Before taking such important decisions, the past record and future prospects of the player should be taken into consideration.

 Yours faithfully,

Mehnaaz Manawar, 

 Cuttack

 Sir With the lifting of the bans on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, the Pakistani pace attack is sure to get back its lost edge. The world cup is only a few months away, and the return of the duo will mean less worries for the coach, Bob Woolmer, and captain, Inzamam-ul Haq. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, 

 Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir I have long been suffering at the hands of the taxi services provided at various points in Calcutta under the aegis of trade unions. Most taxis in these stands refuse to take passengers if the destination is not to their liking. Neither do they like to travel short distances. Worst, they do not allow other taxis to pick up passengers from the area. Anyone can visit the Apollo Gleaneagles Hospital on the EM Bypass and see for himself the harassment of patients and their relatives at the hands of these uncooperative cab-drivers. The unions are a law unto themselves, and are plainly defiant against threats of police action. It is the same story around most hospitals in Salt Lake Susrut Eye Hospital, AMRI, Anandalok at Karunamoyee, and so on. What is needed is a strict and 24-hour police patrol in these areas. As an alternative, a responsible transport organization must be allowed to run pre-paid services here. This will also ease the taxi-related problems of the neighbouring areas.

 Yours faithfully,

Unmesh Guha, 

 Calcutta

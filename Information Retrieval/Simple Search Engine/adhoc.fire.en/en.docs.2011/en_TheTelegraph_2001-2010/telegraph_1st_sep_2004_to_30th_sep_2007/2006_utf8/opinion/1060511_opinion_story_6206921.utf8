 HOPES AND FEARS

 Religious rituals are part of public life in many areas in the North-east. The ?special prayers? in Manipur?s churches for the success of the Naga peace talks were a different matter though. The prayers reflected a hope. More important, they also signalled a fear. The talks which are to resume in Amsterdam next week have been somewhat clouded by uncertainties of late. The Naga leaders are known to have become rather restive. The point of the prayers, however, is that the people do not want the talks to fail. Their desire for peace outweighs the problems New Delhi and the Naga interlocutors face in resolving some of the complex issues. This clearly is the most important message from the prayers. No matter how intractable some issues may appear, the people in Manipur and in Nagaland would not like either side to walk out of the peace process. The peace initiative that began in 1997 is not simply a matter of extending the ceasefire every year. Its most significant contribution is the hope that Nagaland will not return to the tragic days of insurgency. Nothing should be allowed to destroy that hope. 

 The rebels? demand for the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas has long proved to be the most difficult challenge for the peacemakers. For the Nagas, the issue is central to their idea of an ethnic identity. They actually want this territorial question to determine the identity of the Naga ?nation?. From New Delhi?s point of view, this is the most difficult demand to meet because such a course would involve a reorganization of the boundaries of several states in the region. A tentative plan to this effect by the previous government at the Centre led to a violent protest in Manipur. New Delhi needs to be extremely careful in dealing with the issue. A solution will depend primarily on a spirit of mutual accommodation. Not only the Nagas but also other ethnic groups faced problems of territorial identities because of historical reasons. It is not easy for the state to rewrite either the history or the geography of the region. It is often necessary to right the wrongs of history in deference to the popular will. The task before New Delhi is to solve the territorial problem in a manner that would be acceptable to both the Nagas and the Meiteis of Manipur. The Naga leaders too cannot afford to ignore the sentiments of other ethnic groups. The main challenge in Amsterdam will be to revive the spirit of mutual trust.

 TRICKS OF AN OLD TRADE

Malvika Singh

 The Indian parliament has overruled the Supreme Court and stopped the sealing of illegal properties and encroachments for one year. How ingenious we are as a people! How well we manage to legitimize the illegitimate! We are a bundle of contradictions with no ?morality? whatsoever as we run about breaking all the rules we make, endorsing corruption and anarchy. It is a curious reality that boggles the minds of those who have been brought upon to believe in ?right? and ?wrong?. Ostensibly, we are waiting for a ?masterplan?. But what happened to the original masterplan? Who broke those rules and encroached? Who were the corrupt inspectors? Who took the bribes? Where was the ?authority?? Who were the corrupt in the ?authority?, in the political and administrative space? Why have they not been hauled over the coals? Or do only the honest get punished in India? And, how is this ?masterplan? going to be different? Or is it a question about raising the ?price? in keeping with the price of land? We have reduced this land to being truly sick. We have allowed governments to play havoc with us and with our lives. Legitimate is a dirty word. Corruption is clean.

 If a person wants to run his business legitimately, he is harassed for bribes and suchlike even when he is doing the right thing. If he pays his advance taxes on time, he is seen to be some strange animal that abides by the book and the tax officer summons him for questioning because he has met only a handful of honest people. If he complains to the authority that he is being harassed, he is tortured further. There is no reprieve at all except to be corrupt. The ingenuity of the Indian mind leads to extraordinary actions. For decades in a restricting economy, in a country where the rulers ruled like the colonial masters only allowing for their writ to run, people were exploited in different ways at all levels of society. With the opening of the economy, those same servants of the people, government babus and political leaders continue to bring their ?diktats? to bear, even though the parameters have changed, and harassment multiplies. There is no joy in working. Life becomes unbearable for all except the ?authority? that has lost its moral code.

 Steamrolling truth

 Limited minds talk of reservation and affirmative action in the same breath. They do not have the intellectual wherewithal for new ideas that will strengthen affirmative action and make life more inclusive for those who were exploited by the same guilty political and bureaucratic class of overprivileged people. From Arjun Singh to Kamal Nath, they are hogging time on television repeating the same failed populist platitudes about an inclusive social order. These same people are wholly responsible for the degradation of ethics and values, the unprecedented legitimization of corruption in all walks of life, the corrosion of the administration, for turning a blind eye to the machinations of city municipalities across the country, for silently, through their disabled governance, allowing India to become a broken down cesspool where there is no dignity left and where living a humane life, without fear, is near impossible. It makes one angry to repeatedly have to see the faces of those who failed India, spouting superficialities on affirmative action in the media. 

 Hopefully, the generation that is waiting in the wings will work towards creating a non-populist egalitarian society ? inclusive, proud and dignified. Alas, the present lot has lost it. The political space is fast becoming the theatre of the absurd.

 Maybe governments do not have the skill or the will to demolish corruption. Do they feel it will be simpler to legitimize what is wrong, allow all activities that break rules to pass muster, steamroll the few voices that speak a strange language called truth?

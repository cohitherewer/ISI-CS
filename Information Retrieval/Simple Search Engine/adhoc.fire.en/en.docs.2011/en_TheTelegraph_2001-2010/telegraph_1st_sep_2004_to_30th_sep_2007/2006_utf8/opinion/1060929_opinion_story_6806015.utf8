From idea to image on paper 

 MICHELANGELO DRAWINGS: CLOSER TO THE MASTER (The British Museum Press, 25) 

by Hugo Chapman was written to accompany a major exhibition of the work of Il 

Divino as draughtsman. It brings together the drawings in the British and 

Dutch collections, with a deeply learned chronological study. These drawings show 

the labour, intellectual and manual, that produced the sublimity of Michelangelos 

finished masterpieces. The disegno encompasses both the mental formulation 

of the idea, the design, and the drawing that was the result of this process. 

The drawings here are of grotesques in red chalk. Michelangelo believed that such 

whimsical grotteschi were a source of variation and relaxation of the 

senses. The old man on the right, with a goitre and a cap, has a figure suckling 

from one of his pendulous breasts.

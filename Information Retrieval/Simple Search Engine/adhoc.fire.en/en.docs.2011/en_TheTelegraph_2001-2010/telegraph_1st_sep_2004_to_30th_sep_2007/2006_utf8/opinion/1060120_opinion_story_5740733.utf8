The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A BLIND EYE TO WRONGS

 Malvika Singh

 It has now become a scandal of unfathomable magnitude ? the ceaseless killings on the streets and avenues of the Union territory of Delhi by the reckless driving of buses, trucks and cars. Men, women and children are being slaughtered as the traffic police, bus companies and yuppies in their souped-up cars run amuck. 

 Unlettered idiots are freely given licences, drunken drivers stalk macadamized tarmacs, drugged truckies just mow down and kill on city streets and on the highways, all vehicles like tractors, scooters, cars and trucks move in wrong directions, ignoring the road rules, only to cut corners. Cows, dogs and humans amble on the same roads and highways at all times, day and night. Humans tear down metal road dividers for their easy access. 

 The Indian mindset continues to wallow in the bullock-cart age, but equally it demands modern modes of transportation not knowing how to handle them. A corrupted law and order machinery turns a blind eye to all that is wrong, standing in uniform on duty at street corners, allowing the law to be broken every second. The rulers of India have lost their sight as roads are cleared of the citizenry for them to pass, worse than any despotic feudal from the pages of history. 

 We have become a cut-corner-country with no respect or regard for civilities, dignity, integrity and the law. Administrators of the law brazenly break it setting the norm for India. These are all symbols of a failed state. The babu continues to make life difficult, he questions change, development and innovation because he clearly sees, from his vantage point, his impending redundancy. He is terrified of being relegated to a position of no consequence and digs in his heels. It is easy to change this state of affairs if our leadership had the vision.

 Lions and tigers

 Following the killing and virtual extinction of tigers in the wild, we find now that lions too are on the verge of extinction in the last Indian habitat, the Gir in Gujarat. Chief ministers, clueless about wildlife preservation, are opposed to the relocation of the species for rather flimsy and egoistic reasons. The tiger, having been successfully eliminated from vast tracts and forests for reasons of failed and corrupt management as well as a lack of political will to conserve the natural habitat because trees and tigers do not get them votes, is already scarce and totally unprotected. Advice being given is that humans and wild cats must live in harmony. It is madness of this kind that has destroyed the balance of nature. There will soon be no adequate water to drink and water wars will ensue.

 The tragedy is that the executive in this country has proven to be wholly incompetent and detrimental to one and all. The rules and laws that are intended to govern our lives are so convoluted that no one can be sure of right and wrong. This ambiguity has nurtured corruption, on a scale that boggles the mind and insults and humiliates all dignified men, women and children who like a life of integrity. Those who rule and administer us have no qualms and are brazen about their all-pervasive power that was firmly entrenched in the operating system during the decades of the command economy.

 Today, in the changed and contemporary world, a population of young, enterprising and energetic people, well under the age of forty, will compel change. This generation will not tolerate the high-handed and corrupt ways of the authority if they act arbitrarily.

 The end of the first decade of the new millennium will most definitely witness the beginnings of the restoration and restructuring of the system of governance. There is no doubt that India will soon move into a fresh phase of renewal.

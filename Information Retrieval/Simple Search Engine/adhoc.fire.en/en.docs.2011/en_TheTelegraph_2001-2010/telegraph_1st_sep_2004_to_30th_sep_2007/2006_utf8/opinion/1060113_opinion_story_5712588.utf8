 JUST A PLOY

 Illegal migration of people is not a problem unique to India. But the way politicians exploit the issue before every election in Assam has a sinister ring to it. It is not that they offer any new ideas about how to solve the problem. All they want to do is use it for possible electoral gains. Little wonder then that the Congress has promised to amend the Foreigners? Act to supposedly save Assam?s Muslim population from being harassed as illegal settlers. It does not take much to see that the promise really is the party?s gamble to save its Muslim vote-bank. Assam?s Muslims have been restive ever since the Supreme Court struck down the contentious Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunals) Act last year. The tribunals, set up more than 20 years ago to identify illegal settlers, achieved nothing. The apex court ruled out that the Foreigners? Act, which applied all over the country, was the right legal instrument for identifying aliens living in Assam. Congress leaders hope to persuade the Muslims that the amendment to the act would give back to them the legal protection that they feared to have lost because of the Supreme Court verdict. The trouble is that the Bharatiya Janata Party and Asom Gana Parishad see in the Congress promise a design to bend the law for electoral gains. 

 Politicians may not see beyond the next elections, but minority politics of the cynical variety can have disastrous consequences for Assam. Its Muslim population is the highest for any state in India. At the same time, its problem of illegal migrants is perhaps the worst in the country, followed closely by Bengal?s. But, unlike Bengal?s, Assam?s majority population has lived long in the fear of being swamped by an ever-increasing number of aliens from Bangladesh. Such fears have ignited horrific communal and ethnic riots in Assam at regular intervals. All this suggests how important it is for the state to protect the Muslim residents who are genuine Indian citizens. By the same logic, it is absolutely necessary to devise a system that would lead to the identification and eventual deportation of the illegal settlers. The farcical exercises by tribunals do not add up to any such system. But then, no system is good enough if politicians do not allow it to work. Assam?s problem of aliens is already a huge one because of the numbers involved. Reducing it to just an electoral ploy is a dangerous gamble.

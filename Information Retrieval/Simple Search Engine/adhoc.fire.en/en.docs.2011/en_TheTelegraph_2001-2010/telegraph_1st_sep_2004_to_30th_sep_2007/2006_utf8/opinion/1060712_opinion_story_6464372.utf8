 A GLORIOUS 

 END TO A FAIRY TALE 

 The party may well and truly be over, 

 but the football World Cup revealed a Germany that no one 

 had seen before, writes Martin K?mpchen

 Pure magic 

 India and Germany have much in 

 common. They are united not only in appreciation for each 

 other?s culture, but also in the pain inflicted by their 

 tragic histories. The Partition and the Holocaust are now 

 being researched as parallel histories. Indians and Germans 

 continue to suffer from a trauma which results in feelings 

 of inadequacy. Germany has been able to overcome much of 

 it by its economic success and the peace it has been able 

 to cement with its former enemies ? the United States of 

 America, France, England and even Russia. But when Germany 

 organized the Olympics 1972, the dark shadows of the past 

 came revisiting: a number of Israeli sportsmen were assassinated 

 by terrorists. The fear that history would repeat itself 

 was palpable throughout the preparatory stage of the football 

 championship. It is one of the achievements of this global 

 event that politics was unable to mar it. 

 But there was more to it. To the 

 surprise of many Germans themselves, the championship evolved 

 into a one-month festival. It came to be called ?The Party?. 

 Germans revealed their sunny side which we normally associate 

 with people from the Mediterranean. The weather-gods favoured 

 the game. From the first to the last day, the sun was out 

 and pleasantly warm, sometimes even a bit too hot for central 

 Europeans. Germans wait for days like these when they are 

 able to go outdoors and sit in their gardens or at tables 

 in the street in front of restaurants and caf?s. Also, earlier, 

 the fussg?ngerzone did not exist. This is an area 

 in the centre of each town, big or small, which is reserved 

 for pedestrians. No cars and cycles are allowed. These streets 

 have metamorphosed into shopping malls, and a ?street culture? 

 has developed with street performers, small-time vendors 

 and the open air pubs. People stop and talk to each other, 

 children play, and old people sit and muse,.

 During the championship, entire 

 cities turned into pedestrian malls. We witnessed a veritable 

 carnival with people wearing fancy dresses and hats and 

 frolicking on the streets. The warm weather encouraged light 

 clothes baring a lot of skin, which many younger people 

 painted over. The national colours predominated, be they 

 the black-red-gold of Germany or the colours of visitors 

 from participating countries. This orgy of colours predominated 

 in the so-called fanmiles, areas in each city which 

 were cordoned-off. Giant screens were erected and thousands 

 of people gathered to witness each game. This, too, is a 

 new phenomenon in Germany and is called ?public viewing?. 

 Rather than watching the game in their homes, the followers 

 of football preferred to have the experience in a large 

 group. Once I entered a public viewing space in Koblenz. 

 We were first screened by the security personnel. These 

 public viewings were considered as the next best thing to 

 actually being with the crowd in the stadium. There were 

 drums and applause, demonstrations of anger and pep-songs 

 spiced with precious advise. The fanmile in Berlin collected 

 almost a million people during the games featuring Germany.

 Many enthusiasts took the national 

 flag to the stadia or the fanmiles to wave it frantically. 

 Formerly, the German flag could be seen only on national 

 holidays fluttering from government buildings. Still traumatized 

 by the abuse of national symbols perpetrated by the Nazi 

 rulers, West Germany was wary of exulting in symbols of 

 power and of the state. No flags in classrooms as in the 

 US, no flags in government buildings except on holidays. 

 After the reunification, the show of patriotism increased 

 slightly. People were actually willing to sing the national 

 anthem before international games. But, this year, German 

 flags were simply everywhere. Shops sold them freely. You 

 saw them in restaurants, hung from windows, stuck on cars, 

 and in the hands of millions. I was in Bonn before an important 

 game. Around the main station, people wore conal sorcerer?s 

 hats in the national colours, looking a bit like German 

 Harry Potters. Boys and girls had coloured their hair in 

 black, red and gold. They carried shopping bags with the 

 national colours stitched on them.

 Almost every item of daily use 

 had these colours pasted on them in different ways. The 

 more bizarre beatnik types draped their bodies in large 

 flags. Some commentators even saw the shadows of Nazi Germany 

 looming in the background. Then the flag had had the status 

 of a sacred symbol. But this time, the German flag was handled 

 with nonchalance. It was more colour than symbol.

 The championship had many heroes. 

 For me, the person I looked up to was J?rgen Klinsmann, 

 the trainer of the German team. Formerly, he himself was 

 the captain of the German football team and won a world 

 championship title for Germany. He later married an American 

 and emigrated to California. When the German team was in 

 the doldrums two years ago, Klinsmann was called and he 

 accepted the challenge. Within two years, he not only moulded 

 a world class team, he also revolutionized German football. 

 His no-nonsense attitude earned him more enemies than friends. 

 During the championship, he evolved into a passionate young 

 man who managed to unite his players. Everybody calls him 

 great now. But only a few months ago, he was harshly criticized 

 for not attending an important meeting. Even the mighty 

 Franz Beckenbauer did not spare him. Klinsmann then revealed 

 that he had returned to California to be with his mother 

 for his father?s first death anniversary. Everybody felt 

 ashamed. This man has got his priorities right and may serve 

 as an example to German youth. 

 I was in Koblenz sitting in an 

 Italian restaurant when Italy beat Ukraine. Within minutes, 

 the Italians started a car procession, jubilating wildly 

 and letting Italian flags flutter from their racing cars. 

 Our waiter raised his fist and shouted forza Italia. 

 Then it became clear to me that the population in Germany 

 were not only supporters of the German team. During the 

 economic boom in the Sixties and Seventies, the Italians 

 were among the first foreigners to arrive in Germany to 

 make the ?economic miracle? happen. They opened ice-cream 

 parlours, pizza pubs and snazzy Italian restaurants. They 

 worked in factories and succeeded in integrating themselves 

 with Germans. The second and third generation Italians speak 

 impeccable German and yet keep close links with their motherland. 

 We have immeasurably profited from Italian culture. Not 

 only from culinary culture, but also from their music, wine, 

 and the Italian art of living. Italy has, since the time 

 of Goethe, been a sehnsuchtsland for Germans. Italians? 

 wonderful lightness of being and their Mediterranean emotionality 

 have always been admired by Germans who tend to be too serious 

 and introvert. Well, until this championship, which has 

 witnessed an ?Italianization of Germans?. 

 With all the ?lan and energy displayed 

 by the German team, and the joyous support of the masses, 

 it would have been too much of a fairy-tale finish if the 

 Germans had actually won. To me it was precious to realize 

 that even in defeat, the spectators spontaneously feted 

 their team, and that there was no hunt for scapegoats. Klinsmann 

 went down nobly, and praised his team for their performance. 

 A radio commentator had said that the reunification was 

 a great surprise, nobody expected this. This football championship 

 is another surprise. Nobody expected it to happen the way 

 it did.

 UNITED FIGHT

 It is not often that a chief minister weeps uncontrollably in public. When one does, as Mr Okram Ibobi Singh did at the sight of the body of Manipur?s slain inspector general of police, T. Thanthuam, it is a sad statement of helplessness. The fact that the fallen officer headed the intelligence wing of the state police makes his death even more ominous. It is unrealistic to expect the police or other forces to know of every strike that the militants plan. Even so, there was obviously a major intelligence failure that caused the tragedy. Shocking as such incidents are, these should be used to mend the government?s ways. It is not a question of saving politicians or senior government functionaries from the murderous attacks by militant groups. The real issue is the government?s determination and ability to secure the lives of the people. No matter how many people they kill, the militants must not be allowed to feel that the state is powerless to meet their challenge.

 Militancy in India?s North-east thrives on the false premise that it is the effect of a cause. Unfortunately, some civil rights groups in Manipur tend to believe in this propaganda. They, therefore, argue that the militancy is a response to the excesses committed by the army or the police. It is such a misconception that prompts these groups to demand the scrapping of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, which has been used in Manipur for many years now. There is a case for restraint and better judgment on the part of the forces fighting the insurgency. But Thanthuam?s killing shows how much more dangerous the situation in the state could turn if the act were to be repealed anytime soon. The real fight against the militants must, however, be fought by the government, the political parties and the people together. After all, the militants want to destroy the people?s freedoms and democratic institutions. The loss of such freedoms would be infinitely more tragic than the loss of human lives.

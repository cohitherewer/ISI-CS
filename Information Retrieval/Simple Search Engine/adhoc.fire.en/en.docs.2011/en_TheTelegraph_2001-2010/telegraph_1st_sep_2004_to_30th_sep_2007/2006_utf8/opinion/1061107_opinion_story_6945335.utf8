 FIGHTING FOR SPORT

 JAMIE LOYD

 Has anybody noticed the increase in debilitating incidents in sports these days? It has never occurred in my living memory that one football player has bitten another. However, as the teeth marks on Javier Mascheranos arm testify, sport is becoming increasingly sinister. To make matters worse, certain sports are becoming synonymous with ingrained problems cycling and athletics, to name the main offenders.

 Of course, the biting of Mascherano by Jermain Defoe has not being the only incident of unprecedented violence in football. Recently, I witnessed probably the most hideous tackle (if it can be called that) I have ever seen Ben Thatcher of Manchester City thundering into Pedro Mendes, full speed, and planting his elbow firmly in Mendes temple. Mendes was knocked out, and looking at the tackle, was lucky to survive. There was the incident between Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer last season, where the two team mates turned on one another and commenced firing lefts and rights. 

 Football has often been criticized because of its violent, abusive and unsporting ways. But the cancer seems to be spreading to other more gentlemanly and clean sports. 

 The incident that stands out is the recent Pakistani rebellion. Granted, it was as much Darrell Hairs conniving manner as Inzamams stupidity. The Pakistanis are not exactly clean as a whistle, when it comes to cheating, as proved by the recent failed drug tests of Shaoib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, and of course Waqar Youniss ball-tampering case several years ago. I was always under the impression that cricket was as gentlemanly a sport as one could find, yet its name has been dragged into a lot of mud.

 Punish more

 Even Rugby Union is getting unsightly, with the exception of the line between raking and stamping, which has always been blurred. The racist remarks supposedly thrown by Northamptons Mark Robinson at Andrew Higgins of Bath are deeply worrying. Robinson was acquitted, but the fact that the matter was ever in question is disturbing. No sport which has been through racism, has ever quite recovered. I pray nightly that rugby does not go through the pain and abuse that football has suffered. Yet the lack of sportsmanship is becoming more acute, at least one player a week is cited for a dangerous tackle Paul Hodgson, Stuart Abbott and Carlos Spencer, to name a few. 

 The most horrendous incident of all these sport killers is the recent matter of Floyd Landis taking drugs during the Tour de France. Just when you thought cycling was getting out of its black shuck, along comes the most malignant problem ever to strike the sport, and lets face it, it has got some serious contenders to get to that top spot.

 The truly worrying part of these incidents consists of two things. First of all, Rugby League, the most aggressive of all ball sports, has not received any bad press about drugs, or any over-zealous violence. It escapes me how a sport with its roots in bodily harm can still remain clean, yet those like cricket, which are not renowned for their physicality or unsporting nature, are turning to violent ways. Clearly, there is a huge problem. 

 The final point is this: the sanctions imposed on people who break the rules in all the aforementioned sports are slowly getting smaller. The fines are not likely to damage anybody financially and the bans from matches are not nearly long enough. As it stands, only the most problem-riddled sport athletics has the right idea: it banned Justin Gatlin for life. Punishments need to become more stringent and damaging to root out this disease, which is spreading from one sport to another. Somebody better do something fast, otherwise in the future, a good game of football could become akin to a fighting match.

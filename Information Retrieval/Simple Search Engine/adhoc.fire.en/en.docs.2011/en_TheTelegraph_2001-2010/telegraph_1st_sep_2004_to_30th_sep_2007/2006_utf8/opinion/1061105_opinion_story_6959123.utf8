 STRUGGLE FOR REVIVAL

 It may be premature to forecast the Bengal of tomorrow by judging some of the new trends. But one cannot miss the signs of change that today hold the promise of transforming the states economy and, eventually, its society. After decades of decline, Bengals economy seems to be approaching a long-awaited take-off point. The reopening of Dunlop appears to symbolize that moment, just as its closure five years ago captured the time of decline and despair. The reopening of the factory coincided with a flurry of activities over a whole new array of industrial and other economic projects. After many years, entrepreneurs and the government are talking about reopening the Tyre Corporation of Indias unit and the Mining and Allied Machinery Corporations factory. These were long given up as lost cases. That their revival is even being considered speaks of the changing times. And the revival of Dunlop, once the pride of Bengal, has come at a time when new ventures are taking shape. The Tata groups automobile project at Singur now looks more than a possibility. The first moves for a clutch of industrial and urbanization projects by the Salim group of Indonesia re-affirm the new faith. 

 However, times of change are often also the times of confusion and conflict. Not even the worst critics of the Left Front can now say that the industrialization moves are empty promises. The proof before them and the people is incontrovertible. The debates and conflicts, therefore, are over the models of development. This is an acceptance of the fact that things are changing at last. But the confusions about the nature of the changes and their impact are not confined to the critics. There still are enough leftists who are uncomfortable with some of the changes. Their thinking is obviously too fossilized to make sense of anything new. The communication gap among the Front partners is actually a yawning divide between old and new mindsets.

 To Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the winds of change are both an opportunity and a challenge. True, the chief minister represents the face of change more forcefully than even his own party. But even he needs to seize the moment decisively. His party may still talk of the Leninist tactic of two steps forward and one step back. That simply is not an option for Mr Bhattacharjee if he has to take Bengal to the threshold of a real change. The case of the retail sector illustrates the challenge that he faces. There seems to be considerable opposition in the Left Front to large private investments in the retail trade. This can prove to be a major problem for an economy in which the retail trade is becoming increasingly important. But it is not so much the question of the governments attitude to one industry or another; the important thing is a holistic view of the role of capital and free enterprise in ushering in a new Bengal. False or hesitant steps can ruin the early promise.

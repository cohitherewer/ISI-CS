The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HOWS THAT

 Nothing succeeds like failure. The miserable performance of the Indian cricket team has made the coach, Greg Chappell, a sitting duck for everybodys target practice. And all and sundry are claiming success over kicking a man whose failures are now legion. Ms Brinda Karat who knew that she was an authority on cricket? has gone to the extent of suggesting that Sourav Ganguly be brought back to the Indian side. It would be unfair to her to say that there is a touch of regional chauvinism in this sudden advocacy of Ganguly on the part of Ms Karat, who seems to have discovered her Bengali roots after she was made a member of the Rajya Sabha from West Bengal. Perhaps Ms Karat is a supporter of Ganguly because he is a left-handed batsman. What is inexplicable, however, is Ms Karats enthusiasm for cricket unless she has discovered in the English summer game a potential to further the class struggle. There was a time when comrades all over the world considered all issues to be secondary to the class struggle. Even the womens question Ms Karats favourite cause was considered by V.I. Lenin to be subordinate to the class struggle. Indian communists see caste, feminism and now cricket as issues that further the revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Given Ms Karats powerful position in the hierarchy of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the inclusion of Ganguly in the Indian team could well feature in the CPI(M)s party programme.

 Chappell has not helped matters by saying that members of parliament are paid to talk. This piece of indiscretion has raised the hackles of legislators who, following hallowed Indian tradition, see their calling as one informed by the idea of tyag, sacrifice, and service. To suggest that they are paid to do something is infra dig. The ire of the legislators is rooted in this tradition and not in the ethic of professionalism, according to which one is monetarily compensated for competently doing ones appointed job. In a professional ambience, there is no shame attached to being rewarded for doing ones job or duty. One of the jobs of a legislator is to talk. Their choice of subjects to talk about could be debated, but that they are paid to talk (read discuss) cannot be denied. MPs, before they lose their shirts, could ponder on whether the performance of eleven flannelled fools is a worthy enough subject for them to deliberate upon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 POWER POINT

 Many important people were whizzing around Calcutta on Tuesday ? including the most important of them all. It was a busy day for the president in the city. Industry, business, energy, education, science: each of these spheres of national life needed a futuristic vision from the president, and most got one. Industry got more than it had bargained for ? a state-of-the-art presentation on the ?dynamics of leadership? lasting almost three quarters of an hour. And this, together with the early morning fog, threw the presidential schedule somewhat off-gear. There were other major rallies going on all over the city, with Central ministers, party leaders and cadre needing their paths cleared for a wide range of democratic activities. All of these were taking place illegally, without permission from the police. There was one particularly challenging moment for the police when the chief minister was heading home from the Writers? Buildings for his lunch, and the president was being driven towards Raj Bhavan for his. Many Calcuttans may have found something comic about the chaos created by this coincidence on the streets of their city. But citizens with less of a sense of comedy may have wondered about the nature of the ?democracy? all this adds up to.

 The serious citizen may also have wondered why a prominent school in south Calcutta had to close an hour before normal time because it happened to be on the president?s route. A dynamic leader does not necessarily have to be a disruptive one, and a president eager to ignite the minds of his nation?s young would least want to shut down schools in his wake. Symbolically, this is not only bad democratic practice, but also, at a more practical level, it is bad security management or policing. The police exist to protect the undisrupted flow of everyday life, and the mobility of important people is not important enough to provide an excuse for failing to do so.

 SCARE THE ROD

 How can the law protect children from getting beaten up and bullied? That would depend on how the law, and its keepers, imagine a ?child?, and the various situations and spaces in which such things could happen to it. In India, many of these situations and spaces ? in which children experience violence borne out of the abuse of power ? are beyond the pale of the respectable imagination. So a vast number of brutalized children fall through the juvenile justice system. The new draft bill on ?offences against children? has important sections on corporal punishment and bullying, apart from legislating on sexual offences. These sections have broad working definitions for the people who might commit these offences (persons in positions of ?trust? and of ?authority?) and for the places where they might be committed (?any place imparting formal or informal education, or institution for care and custody of the child?).

 Being beaten up and bullied, therefore, remains confined, in the eyes of the law, to commonly identifiable institutions, like schools and orphanages. It is, of course, urgently necessary to legislate these spaces, many of which are state-run. But it is just as crucial to render visible the brutalization of children, first, in their homes and families, and second, in a vast range of public spaces in which millions of Indian children invisibly live and work. Roadside tea-stalls, restaurant kitchens, railway platforms and construction sites are among the many spaces in which figures of authority exist in various guises, resulting in the abuse of such authority in ways that might be physically and psychologically damaging for children. There is also the largely uncharted terrain of rural and provincial India where the stipulated children?s courts, welfare boards and child-lines are virtually non-existent, as are the children?s awareness of and access to the justice system. At either end of the social axis, then, children remain at a disadvantage. Schools, governmental homes and families are self-enclosed spaces in which offences against children are hardly ever witnessed, or they are committed in the presence of other powerless children. And in the more public spaces, such offences are committed upon children whose less-than-human status render them invisible. Who would bother to protect streetchildren from getting beaten up or bullied by policemen? Or children who live on railway platforms from the Railway Protection Force?

 The problem is that Middle India, and its legal machinery, can imagine either urban classrooms or brothels as spaces in which children might need protection. But between these extremes, in the ordinary spaces of everyday life, and beyond, in the distant villages and small towns, there are children who continue to remain dangerously out of sight.

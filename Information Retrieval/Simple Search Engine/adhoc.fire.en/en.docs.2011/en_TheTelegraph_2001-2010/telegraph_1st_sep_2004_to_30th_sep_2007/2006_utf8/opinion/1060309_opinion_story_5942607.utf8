 HOLY TERROR

 The combination of holiness and terror is likely to be a dangerous one for India. Hence the choice of Varanasi as the site for a series of explosions on Tuesday becomes part of a sequence that includes attacks on religious places ? Amarnath, the Raghunath temple in Jammu and Akshardham in Gujarat. The Varanasi attacks also recall ? in their timing before Holi, and in targeting the railway station as well ? the pre-Diwali blasts in Delhi last year. The situation in Varanasi is, however, particularly precarious. Religious sentiments and associations are especially intense in the city, the population of which is significantly mixed in terms of religion. Besides, the political situation in Uttar Pradesh at the moment, compounded by general lawlessness, is largely founded on provocative and unscrupulous communally-motivated machinations, which might be taken up into such a crisis and lead to lethal instabilities. So the primary task for the state and Central governments is to avoid partisanship and stall the situation from getting out of hand. Clear messages from the country?s, and the state?s, political leadership, together with proper security and contingency arrangements, must be marshalled and sustained, and they must rise above local as well as national hostilities among the Samajwadi Party, the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress. The tendency to use the recent communal unrest in Lucknow for political ends does not bode well on this count.

 The possibility of Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav?s government in UP having ignored crucial intelligence alerts should therefore be investigated unsparingly, but without politicizing the matter in terms of Mr Yadav?s alleged appeasement of minorities. Inadequate security and alertness speak of administrative failure, and to keep the state?s law and order machinery up to facing crises of this nature would also mean keeping it free of politicized corruption. The Union home ministry?s idea of working out a special security and intelligence plan specifically for ?holy? cities like Varanasi, Ayodhya and Mathura is an excellent one, provided it is done efficiently and sensitively, keeping in mind local conditions. Part of the hideousness of terror attacks is the belatedness of the realizations that come afterwards. But preparedness is of absolute importance, and must be placed above politics.

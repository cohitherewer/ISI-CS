 Letters to Editor

 Family values

 Sir ? In his letter (?History of hate?, June 19), A.K. Biswas has suggested that my three-part article implies an ignorance on part of the minorities regarding the factors which jeopardize peace and harmony. Nowhere have I implied this. In fact, my plea is that everyone should be made permanently aware of the inhumanities committed by our people against one another over the last sixty years so that we are shamed into not repeating these. Where these are perpetrated by the majority community on our less fortunate fellow citizens, awareness is all the more important because the whip-hand is in the possession of the perpetrators. 

 Asok Dasgupta writes of the multiple record of communal hatred. True, I have focussed on one issue, because this is the one which most threatens the integrity of our state and society. But I would welcome any exploration of xenophobia so long as it does not degenerate into a one-sided tirade against Hindus. We have to look into our past for the seeds of hatred which has infected us all so that the poison can be eradicated. 

 The letters from D.P. Ghatak and Asoke C. Banerjee are of the type I most expected in response to my article. We have here the authentic voice of the parivar calling on Hindus to abstain from doing nothing when ?Hindus are being killed in cold blood?. I suggest Banerjee spend some time every morning seeking comfort from the photographs of the supremely un-Hindu Hindus of Gujarat killing ?yavana snakes? ( the words of a parivar guru ) in very hot blood with holy glee in their eyes. It would be an insult to beasts to describe those perpetrators of evil as beasts. Ghatak?s plea that all communities must share a pride in a common past is a highly debatable issue in a multi-ethnic society. The best we can hope for is an informed understanding of one another?s point of view, including our past conflicts, and a mutual tolerance based on that understanding. We have to understand that our actions today have to be based on our present needs, not on any real or imagined conflict in the past. Dialogue with the likes of Togadia and Advani ? Forget it. I doubt if these two characters know anything about Hinduism, so to call them fundamentalists is a fundamental error. They have brought shame on the Hindu name through their words and actions. If people do not see them for what they really are ? one a fanatical and ignorant Muslim-hater, the other a wily politician expert in the art of manipulating hatred ? their considerable power to inflict suffering on millions remains unaffected. I have focussed on them to highlight the nature of the evil they represent. Nazism was a widespread phenomenon, but it helps to focus on Hitler to understand its nature. It seems that the parivar has at last found its Hitler in Modi. Fanatics among us Hindus, accuse the liberal Indian of being soft on Muslims. If this is true (for most part it is not ) this is regrettable and should be questioned. There is no room for violent terrorists in a democracy. There is also no room for mullahs who offer the narrowest possible interpretation of the sharia, which historically is a broad tradition accommodating the needs of particular societies. And the Muslim intelligentsia must stand forth in their condemnation when the crimes are committed by their co-religionists. Hindus, however, have to make sure that their words and action do not provide a social basis for sympathy towards the Muslim terrorists. It is my firm belief that the vicious propaganda launched by the parivar has been a major factor in creating such a base. The Amnesty report on Gujarat should be widely circulated in our country. It provides a true insight into the nature of the parivar. If anyone has read my argument right, he/she will see that my plea is not for a soft policy towards Muslims but action to protect our state from the dangers of fanaticism and mutual hatred. The parivar is a threat in the same way as Hitler and the Nazis were a threat to Germany. This is not a body one can argue with, for they know their mind very well. The great admiration for Hitler and the Nazis since the days of Golwalkar is worth remembering.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Raychaudhuri, Oxford

 Let there be light

 Sir ? Abhijit Bhattacharyya?s remarks about the National Library are unwarranted (?In a state of neglect?, June 21). As a person using the library since 1960, I can vouchsafe that the institution is at its best state ever. The library premises have a refreshingly different look, the reading room and the toilets remain clean and the well-illuminated Bhasha Bhavan is doubtless a comfortable place for study. As for the partially illuminated hall, it is kept that way because the authorities believe that the reading room is too huge to be used fully. The portion mentioned will be illuminated as the number of readers goes up. The ?battery of sleuths? is there to maintain order inside the reading room, and to help readers. And the sporadic functions outside can never really disturb a diligent reader. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Ghosh, Calcutta

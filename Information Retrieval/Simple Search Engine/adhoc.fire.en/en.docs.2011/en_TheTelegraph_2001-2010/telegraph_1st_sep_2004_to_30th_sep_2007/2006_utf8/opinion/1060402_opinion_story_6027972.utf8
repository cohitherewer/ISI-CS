 Letters to Editor

 Showing the way again

 Sir ? Our ninety-plus comrade, Jyoti Basu, must be happy to see the French trade unions and student unions calling a strike against labour laws (?Fresh France strike called?, March 30). In the Gulf countries too, construction workers of Indian origin are agitating for better pay and job security. The French and the workers in the Gulf could also borrow the idea of gherao from Jyotibabu?s book of political tools. And then the saying, ?What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow? can be read as ?What Bengal thinks today, the world thinks tomorrow?.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Star performance

 Sir ? Samresh Jung deserves congratulations for being adjudged the best athlete of the 18th Commonwealth Games. He is the first Indian ever to bag the honour in the history of the games. Although he may have missed out on a record seven gold medals, he has made the country proud. Jung?s performance is also symbolic of India?s good showing on the whole. With 22 golds, 17 silvers and 11 bronzes, the Indian athletes managed to put up a spirited performance, taking India to the fourth spot. The shooters were the best of the lot, but for the first time, the table tennis team also bagged two golds. The performance in athletics and hockey were somewhat disappointing, particularly the failure of Anju Bobby George in long jump. From hosts Australia, which also emerged on top of the medals tally, India could draw the lesson that striving for excellence in cricket is all very well, but as long as it does not mean neglecting all the other sports. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The 18th Commonwealth Games have been a golden two weeks for India. The Indian shooters have taken the games by storm, but table tennis and boxing have also been happy hunting grounds for India. But doping scandals continue to plague our weightlifters. The organizational management has been disgraceful. The onus lies as much with the sporting bodies as with the athletes themselves. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why is it that India still participates in the Commonwealth Games, 59 years after breaking free of British rule? Why, for that matter, do the other countries? Isn?t it time the event, which stinks of a colonial hangover, was scrapped?

 Yours faithfully,

Saurabh Shukla, Cary, US

 Tongue twister

 Sir ? Indians have been writing English for a long time now and for many of them it was, and is, the only medium of serious expression. The so-called ?Indianness? that has crept into the language as it is spoken and written in India can be explained in terms of the language taking root in an altogether different milieu. But the lack of pedigree has never made Indian English a lesser language. Perhaps, as Stephen Hugh-Jones suggests (?Speaking an alien tongue?, March 22), Indian English has been evolving in a different path, but in the process, the language itself is becoming more diverse. The use of Indian words to describe an Indian situation is a necessity which also enriches the ever-expanding vocabulary of English. There might be levels of familiarity with the language, but the educated Indian?s sense of history makes him extremely faithful to the parent language. As for speaking, Indians, for natural reasons, find it difficult to speak the language with a British accent. But then, even Americans or New Zealanders have their own accents, totally different from the British one.

 Yours faithfully,

Debabrata Ghosh, Calcutta

 SEATS OF POWER

 The principle of dividing to integrate is a risky one. There is no other way to describe the United Progressive Alliance government?s decision to implement 27 per cent reservations for other backward classes in institutions of higher education. The spontaneous eruption of protests all over the country against this, by students without any particular party leadership, is the outward symptom of the sense of increasing divisions within society. Affirmative action aimed at the removal of traditional oppression is to be expected of a socially just dispensation. But such action must be carefully thought through and rigorously applied for positive and targeted change. It should not be unintelligent. Yet this last decision of the UPA government appears to be just that.

 The history of reservations in India holds a few lessons. Numerical quotas have not paid the expected dividends; instead, they have deepened divisions among underprivileged classes, by splitting up caste groups into smaller units and creating new power strata within existing groups. Ignoring economic criteria and time-bound goals, political parties, states and the Central government have simply expanded the purview of quotas and made them part of the expectation of large segments of people. This is the surest way to devalue application, ambition and excellence. Reservations have, paradoxically, nurtured a sense of injustice among both the general as well as the reserved categories. Yet had quotas not been used so nakedly in the service of vote bank politics, much could have been achieved by this time. A study of socially and economically backward groups ? in most cases the two coincide ? could have been made the basis for monitored, time-bound affirmative action, focussed first on primary and secondary education and on health. Modulating the quality and amount of positive discrimination according to need at different times in different regions would have gone much further in creating the desired level playing-field. 

 It is alarming that the pro- and anti- reservation demonstrators are young. Increasing the number of seats, which the government has offered as a palliative to general category students, would mean expanding infrastructure and engaging more teachers. Inevitably, this raises doubts about excellence. The money such expansion would require would have been better spent in upgrading the primary and secondary education of the children of backward groups. Merit and excellence cannot be extrapolated by reserving seats in specialized institutions. They must be allowed to develop. Politicians in a hurry to hijack backward votes from rivals have no time for simple rationality. Yet there can be no success if society is pulled back from excellence and split apart in order to attain it. Even as a political decision, it lacks sense.

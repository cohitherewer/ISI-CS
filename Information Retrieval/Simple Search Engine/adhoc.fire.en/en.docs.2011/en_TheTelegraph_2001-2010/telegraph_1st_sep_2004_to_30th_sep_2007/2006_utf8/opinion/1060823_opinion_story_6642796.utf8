 SEATS OF STRIFE

 Nowhere do the pitfalls of social justice make themselves as sharply felt in India as in the case of quotas in higher education. Yet this is also the sphere where the most definitive thinking and action are almost entirely politically or ideologically motivated. Very little of the current debate on the issue has been driven by a genuine and clearheaded engagement with, or vision of, social theory, pedagogy and the philosophy of higher education. With the cabinet clearing one of the two quota bills now for being tabled in parliament, the matter will be reopened again, possibly with all the protracted divisiveness and disruptions it had resulted in recently. This is the bill that would introduce 27 per cent reservations for students from the other backward classes in institutions of higher education aided by the government. The Indian institutes of management and of technology, together with the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, will fall within the scope of this bill. The private institutes are going to be kept out for now.

 Two immediate problems of implementation are cause for concern. First, as some of the left parties had demanded, the bill might introduce an economic criterion, excluding affluent OBCs from its programme of affirmative action. Inevitably, there is room in this for corruption, complicating redtape and strife within caste groups, and on a scale that might prove to be quite unmanageable and counter-productive. Second, the proposed phased introduction of quotas, opposed by some parties in the South, will create its own set of discriminations and administrative complications. This, quite apart from the realistic difficulties in enhancing infrastructure (faculty, premises and other facilities) in a severe shortage of Central funds. But the greatest problems remain those of principle, although their effects are entirely actual and profound. Keeping the general quota appeased by endlessly increasing the number of seats in the institutions is bound to affect the quality of teaching, research and over-all standards of excellence in these institutions, some of which happen to be the best in the country. The entire system remains, therefore, detrimental to merit and excellence, apart from being full of insurmountable difficulties from the administrative point of view, and, most crucially, productive of disparities, inequalities and injustices in the name of dispelling them. Only an intelligently thought through and carefully implemented, rather than politically manipulated and imposed, solution can work in such a complex social environment.

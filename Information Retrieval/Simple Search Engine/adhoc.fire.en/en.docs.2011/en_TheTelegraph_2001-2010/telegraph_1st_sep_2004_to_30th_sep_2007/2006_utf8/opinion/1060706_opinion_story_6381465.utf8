 TIME TO PASS THE BATON

 RAJU MUKHERJI

 Ever since Eden Gardens was bequeathed to the National Cadet Corps and the Cricket Association of Bengal in 1950, the politicians and the administrators have had a rollicking time on its lush green turf. In this theatre of cricket, the part played by cricketers was quite insignificant. Administrators and politicians were so engrossed with themselves that they did not quite find the time to think of cricket and cricketers.

 All over the world, the memory of eminent cricket personalities is honoured by having gates, stands, terraces and museums named after them. But, in Calcutta, it is the politicians and the administrators who are in the forefront of all publicity surrounding cricket. The club house is not named after Pankaj Roy, the renowned cricketer, but after the former chief minister, B.C. Roy. 

 Lately, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has asked the sports minister, Subhas Chakraborty, to request the present CAB president, Jagmohan Dalmiya, not to contest for the chair this year. Bhattacharjee has hinted that he would prefer the police commissioner, Prasun Mukherjee, at the helm of Bengal cricket.

 Even match

 Bhattacharjee does have a point. It is always an advantage to have the police in close proximity to scenes of crime. But then would a man as busy as Mukherjee have the time for cricket? This seems to be a matter of concern for the former chief minister, Jyoti Basu. who has a close rapport with Dalmiya. So the battlelines are clear. Who would sit on the throne? Will it be Jyoti babu?s man or will Bhattacharjee?s candidate succeed? 

 Now to come to the main combatants. Both are highly successful, intelligent, hardworking men. And there is another important similarity: both are determined to serve Bengal cricket. Mukherjee has replied to Basu?s anxiety by saying that he would delegate his responsibilities to the vice-presidents, secretaries and assistant secretaries. This is a pragmatic attitude. But one hopes that this will not become a homily as one has seen this happen earlier in the CAB.

 The organization has always had its share of vice-presidents, secretaries and assistant secretaries. But the choice of people was so mediocre that even the most petty decisions would have to have the sanction of someone behind the screen. Hopefully, Mukherjee, if he were to win, would have men of integrity surrounding him and not cronies as of yore. 

 Men of honour

 Dalmiya?s main problem was his over-reliance on mediocre men. These men treated those outside the charmed circle with disdain and contempt. They planted seeds of discontent within the CAB-affiliated units and handled issues such as team selection, appointment of coaches and so on. A fiefdom was created which led to the deterioration of cricket in the state. The money that the CAB earned was hardly ever used to help players in need or to nurture young talent.

 During Dalmiya?s tenure, Indian cricket took giant strides. Indian cricketers reaped huge monetary benefits and the game of cricket was extended to various parts of the globe. On the other hand, the state of cricket in Bengal took a turn for the worse, successful coaches were shown the door; players from other states represented Bengal depriving local talents, former cricketers never received their due recognition, and youth cricket languished. 

 Today if the police commissioner were to come to power, his wide experience with criminals and conmen will come in handy. Hopefully, he would not be misled by cliques and groups, which include self-seeking former cricketers in various guises. Mukherjee would do well to remember that though cricket is said to be a gentleman?s game, it is neither played nor governed by gentlemen.

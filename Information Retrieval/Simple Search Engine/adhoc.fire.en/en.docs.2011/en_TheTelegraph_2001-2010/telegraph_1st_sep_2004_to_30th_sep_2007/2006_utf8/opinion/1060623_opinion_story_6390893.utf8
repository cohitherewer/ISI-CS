 THE OTHER GODS OF THE SOUTH

 Cut-outs, Caste and Cine Stars: The World of Tamil Politics By Vaasanthi, Penguin, Rs 425

 Cut-outs, Caste and Cine Stars is a book on the shape of politics in Tamil Nadu. The author is a journalist and this book not only builds on her first-hand experience of Tamil politics, but also goes several decades back in order to contextualize incidents and trends that she writes about.

 Power has alternated in Tamil Nadu for almost forty years between the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, two parties that share the same ideological roots. While both parties emerged out of the Dravidian movement and were inspired by Periyar, neither of them has remained true to the ideals propagated by the founder of the Self-respect movement. Their actions have, in fact, frequently flown in the face of everything Periyar stood for, writes Vaasanthi. This contradiction is borne out by the fact that while Periyar declared priests irrelevant and fought the caste system, these parties have forged electoral alliances with casteist units like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Vaasanthi finds it ironical that J. Jayalalithaa has made it a habit of making a spectacle of her religiosity while K. Karunanidhi has prasad reaching his house regularly from a nearby temple. Vaasanthi also traces the emergence of new gods in the culture of cut-outs that swamps Tamil Nadu ? ?the projection of the political leaders as giants is a substitute for the gods that were destroyed?, she writes. The very fact that a Dravidian party like the AIADMK is led by a Brahmin like Jayalalithaa is another contradiction of Tamil politics.

 Vaasanthi?s book begins with Periyar and examines the emergence of Tamil nationalism and the Dravidian rhetoric in the context of his anti-Brahminism. After tracing the emergence of the DMK, the author goes on to examine the curious synergy between films and politics. Over the next several chapters, the author takes us through Tamil Nadu?s political history from 1967 to the present day, focusing on some of the most important events ? Karunanidhi?s ascendancy, Jayalalithaa?s usurpation of the MGR legacy, the emergence of the LTTE and the encouragement it received from Tamil political parties, the era of coalition politics, Jayalalithaa?s ostentatious wedding bash for her foster son which led to her downfall amidst allegations of corruption, her stay in jail, her stint in power in spite of having been disqualified from contesting elections, the emergence of caste-based parties like the Pattali Makkal Katchi, and Karunanidhi?s arrest on corruption charges. Politics in Tamil Nadu, the author finds, is highly personality-centric where dissent is not tolerated and sycophancy rewarded. The book has been written crisply and is punctuated with personal anecdotes. The analysis is mediocre and there are places where the narrative borders on the impressionistic. But Vaasanthi does a good job of capturing the essence of Tamil politics.

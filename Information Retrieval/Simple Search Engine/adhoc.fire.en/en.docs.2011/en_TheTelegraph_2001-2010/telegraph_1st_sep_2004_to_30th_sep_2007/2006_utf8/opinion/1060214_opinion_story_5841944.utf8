The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MUCH ADO

 Indians love ghosts and conspiracies, so they chase shadows. This is perhaps the best explanation for the attack that has been launched on Mr Manmohan Singh?s government by the left and the Bharatiya Janata Party for the nuclear deal that the prime minister struck with the government of the United States of America. The cry that Mr Singh sold out to the US and compromised India?s nuclear weapons programme is poised to reach a crescendo before the visit of Mr George W. Bush to India in early March. It is now clear that there was no agreement between the two parties in the course of the nuclear deal that India would put its fast-breeder programme, that is, its reactors, under international safeguards. There was no offer from the Indian side during the deal to put the reactors on the civilian nuclear list, which would be separate from the military one. Mr Anil Kakodkar, the secretary of the department of atomic energy, recently went public on this issue, thus guaranteeing that the reactors will remain part of India?s military nuclear programme. It is difficult to buy the story that Mr Kakodkar spoke out of class and that his statement did not carry prime ministerial endorsement. By allowing a mandarin to go public, the prime minister has left himself enough talking room when he has a pow-wow with Mr Bush. Whether the hard-nosed US negotiators will buy this is another question altogether.

 One thing to the advantage, or otherwise, of both sides is a unique feature of the deal: it has no substance, in the sense that there is no formal text with a seal and a signature. It is a gentlemen?s agreement in an area which has never seen a gentleman since the time Metternich equated diplomacy with realpolitik. There is a clear divergence of views between what the US would like India to accept and what the latter finds acceptable. The vagueness of the so-called deal is double-edged. It allows for a space for greater discussion between the prime minister and the president and even among the senior officials on both sides. But such a discussion could be hamstrung by the a priori revelation about the nature of the agreement. India?s discomfiture is evident from the fact that it has not fulfilled the initial conditions of last July?s agreement: voluntarily placing its civilian nuclear facilities with the International Atomic Energy Agency, filing a declaration about its nuclear facilities with the IAEA and signing a protocol with the latter. Thus, to call this a deal or an agreement is to stretch matters, and to shout against it is a meaningless exercise of the vocal chords. Nothingness cannot be opposed since it cannot be agreed upon.

 OVERRIDING TERROR

 A dazed Malegaon, which just saw two blasts inside and outside a mosque kill 38 and injure hundreds, can read the signals just as well as the rest of the nation. And yet their senders never tire of repeating them, for the target readers of these signals simply do not seem to be getting it right. The bombs for worshippers in mosques and temples, travellers in local trains, shoppers in markets and happy tourists in buses are meant not so much for the immediate bloodshed they lead to, but for the larger mayhem they can create. The visual impact of all that blood and torn flesh is supposed to goad victims, their grieving families and angry communities into some kind of joint action like engineering a communal backlash. But that does not seem to be happening with as much regularity as wished. Hence the string effect. Two bombs if not seven, a festive occasion if not the hour of dreary homeward travel. 

 It is not surprising that Malegaon has been chosen with such care by the mischiefmakers. This textile town of Maharashtra, with its predominant Muslim population, has been volatile and has seen successive riots, the last in 2001, shortly after 9/11. Interrogations of suspects connected with other blasts elsewhere have repeatedly indicated that Malegaon could become a problem spot like Aurangabad and Pune. Raids in this town earlier this year have also unearthed veritable signs of trouble RDX, AK-47s and hand grenades. But then, the Maharashtra government, found seriously floundering when the local trains in Mumbai blew up in its face two months back, has never been a careful observer of either signs or signals. As for Malegaons local government, such signs of trouble have always been welcome. There can be little doubt over the fact that social polarization following the riots in 2001 was a deciding factor in the outcome of the municipal elections of 2002. A similar event could have played an equally decisive role in the forthcoming Malegaon Municipal Corporation elections, due in another few months.

 The opposition, unlike the bewildered Vilasrao Deshmukh government, has not failed to pick up the right cues from Malegaon. It now has a stick to further beat the United Progressive Alliance government with. There will be the predictable demands for some stringent legislation as replacement for the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and, worse, a greater pressure on the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, to put the shifty general, Mr Pervez Musharraf, in place when he meets him in Havana.

 For the distraught in Malegaon, as for the other victims of terror in India, such shifts in power are unlikely to matter, at least immediately. For them what would matter is how rightly they manage to keep reading the warning signals, and decide to override them.

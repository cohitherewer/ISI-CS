 TO MAKE FRUITFUL USE OF WASTE

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 The worlds current 441 operating nuclear power plants generate over 10,000 tonnes of heavy metal (tHM) of spent fuel each year. Less than one third is reprocessed for recycling as mixed-oxide fuel. The remainder is placed into interim storage facilities. About 1,90,000 tHM are currently in storage. Most are stored in water, but an increasing amount is in dry storage, which has become the preferred method for new away-from-reactor interim storage. Dry storage has the advantage of being modular, which spreads capital investments over time, and in the longer term, the simpler passive cooling systems used in dry storage reduce operation and maintenance requirements and costs.

 Current global capacity for reprocessing civilian spent fuel is approximately 5000 tHM per year. A new facility under construction at Rokkashomura, Japan will add 800 tHM/a. Uranium commissioning at Rokkashomura began in 2004, active commissioning with actual spent fuel is scheduled to begin in 2006, and commercial operation is scheduled for 2007.

 Current global capacity for MOX fuel fabrication is approximately 200 tHM/a and is expected to grow to around 350 tHM/a by 2010. Current research to improve on the PUREX process used in all operating commercial reprocessing plants covers advanced PUREX processes, other aqueous processes and several non-aqueous processes.

 The most efficient way to use reprocessed fuel is in fast reactors. Fast reactors have been built and operated in France, Germany, India, Japan, the Russian Federation, the UK and the US.

 However, early economic incentives for reprocessing and recycling diminished after the 1970s, partly because of the slowdown in nuclear capacity growth... because uranium resource estimates continually rose and partly because of secondary sources. Only one fast reactor, BN-600 in the Russian Federation, currently operates as a power reactor, and it uses not reprocessed fuel, but fresh highly enriched uranium (HEU) fuel. India, however, began construction in 2004 of a 500 MW(e) prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam, and there is ongoing research in a number of countries

 Finland, Sweden and the US are furthest along in developing final high level waste repositories, although none is expected to be in operation much before 2020. Finland and the US have each chosen a single site, at which they are conducting the necessary research. A licence application for the repository at Yucca Mountain...was scheduled for submittal to NRC in 2004, but has been delayed...

 In November 2005, following a three-year nation-wide consultative process, Canadas Nuclear Waste Management Organization recommended an adaptive phased approach to managing Canadian spent fuel. During the next 30 years spent fuel would continue to be stored at reactor sites, a suitable site for a deep geological repository would be selected, and a decision would be made whether to also construct a centralized interim shallow underground storage facility to start receiving spent fuel in about 30 years....The deep repository would begin accepting spent fuel in about 60 years.

 In France, investigations at the underground research laboratory in Bure on disposal in clay have made good progress. Frances 1991 nuclear waste research and development act specifically requires further parliamentary action after 15 years, and a formal public debate began in 2005 as preparation...The debate is based on research since 1991 on three main approaches... and the new legislation is expected to clarify near-term and intermediate-term steps to be taken to move forward on all three.

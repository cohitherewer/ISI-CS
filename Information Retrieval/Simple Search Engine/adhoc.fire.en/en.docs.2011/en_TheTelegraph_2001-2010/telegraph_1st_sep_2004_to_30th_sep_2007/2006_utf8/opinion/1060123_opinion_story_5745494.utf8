 Out in the cold

 Sir ? The crisis in Karnataka, which has left Dharam Singh?s government tottering on the brink of a collapse, has no doubt come as a dampener for the Congress. Already facing flak over the Quattrocchi episode, the party was hoping to use the AICC session in Hyderabad to shore up its image. However, the celebrations are bound to be rather muted, considering the situation in Karnataka. Much as the Congress may try to put up a brave face, there is precious little it can do to turn the tide in its favour. The alliance that was cobbled together by the Congress with the Janata Dal (Secular) after the fractured verdict of the 2004 assembly elections has finally come unstuck, and the Congress is entirely responsible for political uncertainty which Karnataka now finds itself in. Had the Bharatiya Janata Party, which emerged as the single largest party in the last elections, been allowed to form the government, perhaps the present turmoil could have been avoided. But former prime minister and leader of the JD (S), H.D. Deve Gowda, was convinced that his party would be better off joining hands with the Congress to form a government. Nineteen months later, the tables have turned and the JD(S) has now decided to share power with the BJP. There can be no doubts about the fact that the BJP-JD(S)coalition has numbers on its side. What is, however, surprising is that the governor, T.N. Chaturvedi, has decided to give Dharam Singh a full eight days to prove his majority on the floor of the house. This would give the Congress ample time to indulge in horse-trading to win back power in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The political developments in Karnataka have come as a surprise to everyone. It seems that the Congress-led coalition government, headed by Dharam Singh, is about to make way for a JD (S)-BJP government. The failure of coalition politics is nothing new to India.The BJP-BSP government in Uttar Pradesh had also fallen after a short spell in office. Coalition governments fall when alliance partners scramble for the chief minister?s chair. H.D. Kumaraswamy, the leader of the rebel MLAs, has decided to share power with the BJP, saying that that he would be the chief minister for the first 20 months, followed by a BJP leader taking charge for the remaining tenure. There is nothing wrong with coalition politics per se but political parties need to ensure that coalition governments can serve their full terms. Otherwise, it is possible that the electorate will lose faith in coalition politics altogether. States run by coalition governments should take a leaf out of Jammu and Kashmir where the Congress-People?s Democratic Party coalition has been in power for over three years now.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is amazing to see tax payers in Karnataka patiently sitting through the theatre of the absurd going on in the state. Politicians in the state are wary of losing power because many of them fear that they may forfeit their deposit in the event of a re-election. It seems that politicians in our country have only one aim: to steal everything from a house on fire before moving into a new address.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The hunger for power among our politicians has cost the country dear in terms of economic development and welfare of its people. Corruption, poverty and violence have become a dime a dozen today. The JD(S)-BJP coalition must prove that they are different from their predecessors, and the only way to do it is to concentrate on serving the common people rather than themselves. One hopes that the new government cuts down on expenses and tries to weed out corruption from politics.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? A few days back, Bangalore hit the headlines because of the terrorist strike at the Indian Institute of Science. Now the city is back in the news because of the prevailing political uncertainty. In the last elections, the Congress, despite having fewer MLAs than the BJP, the single largest party at the time, went on to form the government. But now, the BJP seems to have exacted sweet revenge on the Congress and is about to form a new government with the help of the rebels from JD(U). This sudden change in affairs must have come as a shock to Congressmen, busy preparing for the plenary session in Hyderabad.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Why is Dharam Singh clinging on to the chief minister?s chair when he does not have the numbers required to save his government? Is he still waiting for a signal from the high command to quit or does he want to go only after unfurling the tricolour on Republic Day? Moreover, was there any need for the governor to give Singh so much time to prove his majority? Decisions such as these cast suspicion on the appointment of governors who are sympathetic to a particular dispensation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dhanakar Thakur, Ranchi

 Sir ? The sad truth about coalition politics in India is that a game of musical chairs is played out whenever party interests prevail over that of governance. It is precisely because of this that the breakaway faction of the JD (S) has been able to orchestrate the present crisis to teach a lesson to the Congress. That Kumaraswamy, son of former prime minister, H.D. Deve Gowda, will have little difficulty in forming the new government with the help of the BJP is a foregone conclusion. What remains to be seen is whether the state will continue moving on the path of development under the rule of a new government It is unfortunate that the progress of a state is being held to ransom by the machinations of a few wily politicians.

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

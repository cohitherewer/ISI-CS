 THE CHANGING NEEDS OF LABOUR

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Strengthening inspection of children?s working conditions is only possible if a rational distinction is made between ?hazardous? and ?non-hazardous? work, on the basis of clear guidelines which ensure that a child?s development needs are not prejudiced and that there is a real prospect of protection from abuse and exploitation. Using the guidelines on ?hazardous work? in the new Worst Forms of Child Labour Recommendation, 1999...can certainly help make the legislation more workable. Introducing a clear age limit...below which no child may work can also help rationalize child labour laws, and thus facilitate inspection and standard setting.

 Some countries prohibit work during school hours but do not have accompanying compulsory education regulations, or they have minimum ages for child labour and education that do not coincide. Others have compulsory education laws but still charge even low-income families school fees, or do not provide equitable access to schools. Consistency between law and policy is critical for effective child labour inspection, a requirement that some countries have not yet achieved.

 The commitment to eliminating child labour ...requires the political will to eradicate child labour and place it as a priority on the national agenda. States must establish comprehensive and clear bodies of legislation on child labour and labour inspection. The complexity and limitations of the law can be a serious barrier to effective law enforcement. The absence of a comprehensive and rational set of standards at the national level on both child labour and labour inspection makes the work of the labour inspectorate difficult, if not impossible.

 ...Given the political will, and clear and comprehensive regulations and standards...strict enforcement alone is unlikely to be successful. In addition to the practical problems of inspecting...it is self-evident that where child labour has proliferated without sanctions over a long time there are also educational and attitudinal approaches to be made. Employers, parents of the children themselves have to be educated and persuaded of the need for change.

 Companies often argue that the employment of children is necessary to enable them to remain competitive within their own country or internationally. Whilst those engaged in industry with a world-wide export market are sometimes susceptible to pressure from public opinion or organized purchasers...equitable compliance across purely domestic industries...is more difficult to achieve.

 The imposition of sanctions...might unintentionally drive the children into more dangerous or degrading forms of work....Preventive measures are also likely to achieve the aim of raising awareness throughout society....It is necessary to develop...a clear, considered, coherent and consistent policy establishing the balance needed to be struck between...labour inspectors? methods of intervention ? namely sanctioning and ?prevention?.

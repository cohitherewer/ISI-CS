 SAMOSAS AND ARSENIC

 Protect them from what they want. This is fast becoming the Union health ministers principle of governance when it comes to young consumers of junk food and drink. And the best form of protection is prohibition, according to the classic Rule of the Father. Bizarre as it may sound, forbidding youngsters to consume pizzas, chips, samosas, burgers and cola in school and on university campuses, coming from a Union minister, does amount to a form of governance. The question directly arises as to whether such a regulation of individual choice is at all the business of the State. Besides, not all these consumers are children. To not allow university students to eat a pizza and wash it down with a Coke reduces paternalism to something truly ridiculous. Moreover, this extreme and unrealistic culture of concerned prohibition has to be seen in the context of the other bans thought up by this minister smoking scenes in films, celebrities endorsing unhealthy drinks. The States concern for the young citizens physical well-being becomes another form of protectionism that confuses regulation with awareness-raising.

 This confusion will either further idiotize the young with regard to their bodily habits, or turn them into law-breakers when smuggling samosas into class suddenly becomes a richly alluring temptation. Such prohibitions actually end up trivializing certain important forms of consciousness that should be part of every young Indians education. Rather than snatching food away from under their noses, it might be more interesting and effective to teach young people how to see through, and thus resist, the markets manipulation of their appetites and desires. It is essential for young consumers to be taught about consumerism to learn how to read the language of advertising, for instance, and figure out how the link between drinking a particular fizzy drink and being cool is not necessarily natural, but has been cleverly manufactured with nothing but profit in mind. This kind of awareness is quite as important as knowing about calories and condoms. (In any case, slipping in HIV/AIDS awareness with yoga and health-and-lifestyle classes is to make a mockery of the gravity of the former, of the very special kind of education that sexual health necessitates.)

 Of course, teaching young people about the markets designs on their health is also to risk equipping them to think in a certain way about the designs and failings of the State. What if young people in West Bengal, for instance, actually started questioning, and then understanding, what the government is doing, or not doing, about the air they breathe and the water they drink? What if they suddenly became aware of auto-emissions and arsenic? Or the criminality of a government not bothered about letting people, young and old, be poisoned on a scale that is more dangerous than the damage done by the greasiest samosa?

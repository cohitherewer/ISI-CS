The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Without malice

 Sir The headline, BPO girl falls to 25 stabs (July 27), in connection with Tanya Banerjees brutal murder, is objectionable. The term BPO in the headline presents the BPO sector as unsafe for women and its employees as particularly given to immoral and reckless conduct. But the Bangalore call centre in question had no role whatsoever to play in the murder, the reasons for which were personal. The media should be careful not to tarnish the image of a sector, which provides employment to thousands of young people every year, by making such baseless connections.

 Yours faithfully,

Chiranjib Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Never say bye

 Sir The decision of the railways minister, Lalu Prasad, to allow no one other than passengers inside stations is a welcome move (Wave goodbye to a tradition, July 30). The platforms get unnecessarily crowded because there are always too many people to see off or receive passengers. Apart from the security angle, this makes the platforms messy and facilitates criminal activities like theft. Often bona fide passengers are unable to take their seats in a compartment because people who have come to see off their relatives occupy the seats until departure time. Allowing non-passengers only upto a point before the station would make train travel more secure and comfortable. Only those with tickets should be allowed entry into the platforms and there should also be routine security checks. This will also scare away ticketless travellers.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Lalu Prasads latest brainwave is absurd. He seems to have forgotten that women, children, sick and old people who travel alone need companions to help them board or get down from trains. If the entry of the companions of such passengers is restricted then they will inevitably end up being harassed by coolies and pickpockets who throng the platforms. 

 If Prasad thinks that barring the entry of non-passengers will stop miscreants from entering the platform, then he is mistaken. Who is stopping criminals from buying passenger tickets? One wonders whether this rule would apply to hundreds of Lalu Prasads supporters who descend on platforms in droves every time the railways minister travels by train or visits a station to attend some ceremony.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir Instead of taking any effective measures to combat terrorism, the ministers are bent on proposing useless steps that serve no purpose but only inconvenience the general public. Friends and relatives of passengers go to the railway stations not for fun but to ensure that the latter are properly accommodated in their seats. The railway minister should be reminded that the majority of terrorist attacks have taken place in local trains where his proposed plan will have no effect. Moreover, what will prevent terrorists from getting on to trains from wayside stations? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir If the security personnel inside the trains remain in their present state of inaction, then barring entry to non-passengers will not serve any purpose. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir In recent times, the railways ministry has introduced several moves to increase the safety of passengers. Apart from the recent announcement by the railways minister, close circuit cameras have been installed at major stations. Yet vendors and unauthorized passengers continue to enter sleeper coaches of trains by bribing the ticket checkers. This malpractise must be stopped immediately. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Shankar, Hyderabad

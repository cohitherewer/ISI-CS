 The man behind the mask

 THE ACT OF LIFE By Amrish Puri, Stellar, Rs 595

 T his book unveils the man behind the archetypal villain of Indian cinema, Amrish Puri. On the eve of his seventieth birthday, the actor takes a look back on his career spanning decades and records the engrossing vignettes. For Puri, if anything distinguishes him from other actors, it is not his talent but his dedication to the profession. What comes across in this candid autobiography is the simplicity of the man behind the legend. The actor, whose blood-curdling Mogambo khush hua was once used by mothers like the bogeyman song to instil fear in the mind of errant children, was also the awkward child who was bullied by his friends as the mota billi. Puris career becomes the journey from the Stage of Struggle to the mastering of the Art of Survival. The actors humility shines through every word he has penned. The photographs offer a glimpse of the breathtaking range of roles that Puri has played. Puris comment to the photograph of the mighty Mogambo sums up the tone of the book, Never did I think that Mogambo and Amrish would be like peas in a pod.

 Making sense of the city

 Urban Studies Edited by Sujata Patel and Kushal Deb, Oxford, Rs 595

 Ever since Max Webers The City, interest in urban sociology has grown to take into account the complexity of modern urban life and the diverse roads to urbanization taken by developed and underdeveloped nations. Urban Studies has a wide range of contributors from both India and the West and, as such, places the story of Indian urbanization in a global context. In a comprehensive introduction, Sujata Patel explains the evolution of the discipline. The scope of urban studies has always been a matter of debate among social scientists. Broadly, it focuses on the form of the city and its surface geography, the spatial growth of population, the impact of capitalism, colonialism and globalization, the way modernity transforms urbanization into a philosophy and so on. The essays in this volume take the raj as the critical benchmark. Colonial exploitation had led to a new political economy in India and thereby made the country dependent on the imperial economies. Post-independence, urbanization in India came to be defined by state policy and the market economy, thus exhibiting a complex pattern. It is to the editors credit that they at least make an effort to live up to Manuel Castellss call for a holistic approach to the urban experience.

 Our Indian Railway Edited by Roopa Srinivasan, Manish Tiwari and Sandeep Silas, Foundation, Rs 650

 This book is a celebration of 150 years of Indian Railways. Subtitled Themes in Indias Railway History, its articles examine the impact of the introduction of railways in India. In the preface, Sandeep Silas writes about the railways changing the face of India as the behemoths started plying over the length and breadth of the country. Besides bringing people closer, the railways also inspired songs, poetry and novels. In his essay, Peter Morey shows how the railways became a site of struggle for supremacy between the colonizer and the colonized. Perhaps the best part of the book is the concluding photo-essay entitled The Romance of the Steam. The photographs help one understand what Walt Whitman meant when he sang about the railways welding lands together.

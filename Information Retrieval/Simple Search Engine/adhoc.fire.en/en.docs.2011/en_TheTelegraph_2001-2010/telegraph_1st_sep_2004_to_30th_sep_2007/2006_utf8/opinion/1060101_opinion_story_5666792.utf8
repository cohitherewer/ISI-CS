 DIARY

 Imagine the amazement of a Delhi judge when he received an SMS in the middle of court proceedings recently: the text message was an Urdu couplet, obviously intended for a women, since it was all praise for the beauty and charm of the lady. The judge ignored it, but only to be pestered with two more amorous texts in the next one hour. Before lunch recess, the judge had been bombarded with seven such messages. During the break, the judge made a call to the number from which the messages had originated, and it emerged that the number had been disclosed to the message-sender by the owner of a neighbourhood provision store, which also sold pre-paid cards on the side. When confronted, the store-owner apologized profusely and admitted that he had parted with the number, confusing it with that of a stunner who had come to recharge her phone. Mistaking a three for an eight had landed the man in trouble. The Judgesahib decided to drop the matter, but not before good-humouredly warning the store-owner that he should remember his threes and eights before helping his friends land girlfriends.

 After the year-end sting operations and scams, the 2005 reviews of most parties are all about who has less members with their hands in the till. And the leftists can?t hide their glee at having come out unscathed. The Congressmen, as is their wont, have fallen back on nostalgia. In the Central Hall of parliament, a Congressman was heard narrating now Jawaharlal Nehru combatted mor-al turpitude within the party ? he had once asked people at an election meeting in Madhya Pradesh not to vote for his party?s candidate, after hearing about some charges against him. A section of the Congress believes that the tale is being circulated with malicious intent. The candidate Nehru pulled up in public happens to be Congress leader Arjun Singh?s father.

 Cell phones mean trouble most of the time. The Gujarat high court recently convicted the chief engineer of a state undertaking on the charge of failing to switch off his mobile phone in the court. The engineer pleaded helplessness ? he had only just bought the phone, and didn?t know all its functions yet, including the keys one needed to press to stop the phone from ringing. But the court was not to be fooled. It maintained that, ?A person who holds the sword must also know which side the sharp edge is.?

 You can?t fool the president either. Recently, a group of journalists from a leading newspaper were taken to meet the Prez. This was for a special edition they were planning, with a photo-shoot with A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and the works. Naturally, they had kept a special slot aside for a picture of Kalam with the paper in his hands. But that was not to be, since the Prez was, after all, neutral towards newspapers. Trust journos to work out a way. They posed with the Prez, holding the paper in front of him. Say cheeze!

 What is the best way to woo a Bihari bureaucrat or policeman? To serve him litti made with export-quality sattu and the best green chillies. And that is exactly what the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, was doing last week in Delhi. The aim: to get the worthies to fill up the 50-odd civil and police service posts lying vacant in the state. How tasty the litti was will only be known by how many officers take up the offer.

 A wannabe contestant of a popular quiz show has taken the channel to the MRTP commission, complaining that he was unfairly denied entry. He had apparently cleared every step, spending over Rs 10,000 on SMS-es and phone calls alone ? all for a chance to be on the hot seat. But he found he was shunted out at the last step without so much as an explanation. Last heard, the organizers have agreed to make a placatory offer, on condition that he withdraws his complaint.

 Oh when will our starlets learn... that no amount of chocolate can hide a black bustier? This is not to deny that Kareena Kapoor looks extremely fetching with chocolate all over her. What kind was it though? Milk chocolate, or the bitter variety?

 The award for the most happening jubilee celebrations of 2005 goes to...come on, you can?t go wrong on that. It has to be the BJP?s silver jubilee celebrations. If the Sanjay Joshi videotapes gave it a flying start, how could the buddhababas be far behind? And so, Vajpayee threw cryptic arrows with epic allusions, throwing the party into a huge literary confusion. (What happened to the poor chaps who hadn?t read the Ramayana well?) Not one to be sidelined so easily, Advani laid special stress on family planning, knowing that the RSS chief has asked Hindus to go forth and multiply. But missing in action was Arun Jaitley, who was nursing a viral fever in Delhi. Now, is that good or bad? Good, of course, because it means that Jaitley has managed to give another party crisis a slip. Remember, when Advani had announced his resignation in June, Jaitley was in hospital with a heart condition. Now that?s what we call a lucky escape.

 KISS, BUT PLEASE DON?T TELL

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 What is it about a kiss that makes adult Indians behave like naughty little children?

 There have been two kinds of reactions to the imbroglio. The first, and the more dangerous one, is that Sawant deserved such treatment. After all, isn?t she the one who cleverly combined sleaze and entertainment to make a name for herself? This line of thought is expected in a country where every attempt is made to thwart canny, confident women who are not afraid to use their sexuality. The second, and more sensible, reaction has been one of bewilderment and perplexity. It is funny to note what a kiss does to India, and the kind of idiocy it generates in the country?s institutions, among its intelligentsia and its media.

 The kiss has never been a kiss in this part of the world. It is much more than that. One of the simplest expressions of human affection is a rather complex act, with notions of shame, titillation, privacy and puritanical hysteria built into it. Earlier, Indian films preferred to show flowers, fresh mountain streams and clouds whenever the hero and the heroine threatened to lock lips. Nowadays, a director ensures that the lead pair kiss even when it is not required. But in the real world, things are still rather different. Some years ago, in Mumbai, arguably one of India?s most ?liberal? cities, the police instructed couples to sit facing the crowds on the Marine Drive, lest they start the dreaded act. Even the rich and the famous do not get away lightly when it comes to a kiss ? Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor realized this when they kissed in a disco. That act, unlike Mika?s, was consensual. Yet, it did nothing to stop our moral guardians from pontificating atop their perches.

 So what is it about the kiss that makes adult Indians behave like naughty little children? One suspects that it has a lot to do with a peculiar mix of hypocrisy and repression that makes Indians deny some of the most natural things (?Baki sab karta hoon par kiss nahi karta? is what Mika is reported to have said recently). This kind of denial and moral policing have other manifestations that are equally counterproductive. For instance, the West Bengal government has been pressing to drop words like condom and all references to the sexual act in the highly successful Buladi campaign. This, at a time when a UNAIDS report estimated that nearly 4 lakh people have died of HIV/AIDS in 2005 alone.

 The obsession with Singh, Sawant and their kiss only reflects the spirit of conservatism that dogs love, desire and sex in India. And unless the nation decides to adopt adult behaviour, it would be difficult to stop Mika and Rakhi from entering the country?s collective consciousness every time they decided upon a lip-lock.

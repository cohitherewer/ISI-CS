 Letters to Editor

 Virtual addiction

 Sir It is good that people have realized at last that internet addicts are no less sick than alcoholics (Drunk alert for Netizens, Oct 19). Those who use the internet excessively usually waste time in chatting, visiting pornographic sites or playing games. These habits, as the report says, have become forms of self-medication. Those addicted to alcohol also claim that liquor enlivens them. Any addiction is harmful since it creates a dangerous dependence among the addicted. It affects not only their health but jeopardizes their personal relationships as well. Addiction to the internet has become widespread today because of various reasons. The pressures of coping with a hectic work schedule leads people to turn to the net as a source of recreation. Even if some people are aware of the potential danger in spending too much time on the internet, they cannot give it up, as the internet almost becomes an extension of their consciousness. The attractiveness of the cyberspace lies in the fact that here one can spend as much time as one likes while being invisible. This anonymity makes the internet dangerous. People freely expose those sides of their personality in cyberspace which they would not normally reveal within the bounds of respectable society. This also increases the possibility of crime and violence among men. Some way must be found to curb the menace of the internet. 

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md. Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir Todays young men look upon the internet as a means of promoting love and friendship. Forgetting the need for human interaction, they spend most of their time in virtual space. And since pornographic sites can be accessed at the click of a mouse, young children readily spend their pocket money on visiting such sites on the internet. This not only corrupts their mind at an early age but also affects their studies adversely. Surfing the internet has become an addiction for which a remedy has not been found yet. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Not everything available on the internet is corrupting and most of the sites actually supply valuable information. If netizens spend more time in visiting the educational sites, they would actually do themselves good. People should learn to use technology responsibly rather than becoming slaves to it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sunanda De, Calcutta

 Sir It is absurd to compare alcoholism with addiction to the internet. While the consumption of alcohol has no positive effect whatsoever, browsing the internet does serve many useful purposes. Pressures of modern lifestyle have bred many insomniacs in the cities. If they utilize their nights in visiting informative sites, then they are sure to emerge the better for it. Besides, families and friends are generally spread all across the globe today. The internet is an effective tool which connects friends and relatives across distances. If people chat at night, it is mostly because of the time difference between countries.

 Yours faithfully,

Shounak Ghosal, Calcutta 

 Festival of doom

 Sir It is shameful that criminals have started using religion as a pretext for harassing people to their death (Puja sharks kill youth, Oct 22). The way in which the 20-year-old Bikram Jha of Kidderpore was beaten up by members of a puja committee after he refused to pay the amount they demanded as subscription for Kali Puja, proves how dangerous the puja organizers have become. The miscreants deserve to be arrested and imprisoned for life. If the police do not punish them, then the trend of forcible collection of subscription will only get a boost. All the pujas every year will spell doom, instead of being occasions for happiness. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahelaka Begum, Calcutta

 Sir Communal pujas have lost their religious significance today and have instead become an occasion for local hooligans to engage in revelry of all kinds. The occasion of the pujas seems to give them the licence to harass the common man in every possible way. The organizers forcibly collect subscriptions and when people refuse to pay the unjustified amount demanded, these anti-socials coerce and threaten them. They even follow up the threats with action, as proved by the death of Bikram Jha and the attack on Sandip Shaw of Shyampukur. Thousands of similar cases of forcible collection of puja subscriptions go unreported. Attempts to resist the demands and report to the police invariably result in further torture. The police remain their usual inactive self and take no action to redress the wrongs. 

 Quite a number of famous pujas are associated with political leaders. The leaders have their thugs who render invaluable service during elections. So the hooligans can get away with such crimes as extortion, threatening and even killing. One can only hope that the police give some thought to the laws they are meant to uphold. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

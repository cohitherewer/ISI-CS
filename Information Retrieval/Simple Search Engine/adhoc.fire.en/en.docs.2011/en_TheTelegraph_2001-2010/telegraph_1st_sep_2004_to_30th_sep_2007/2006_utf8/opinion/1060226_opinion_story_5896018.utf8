 LALU PRASAD EXPRESS

 Buffo turns reformer. Why not, the people of West Bengal might well ask, after having seen a Stalinist apparatchik become a reformist chief minister. Mr Lalu Prasad?s track record did not quite recommend him as independent India?s most successful railways minister. Yet this evaluation has the support of hard facts and numbers. Mr Prasad, till he decided that Indian Railways would run faster than ever before, was nothing more than a figure of ridicule among India?s Westernized elite. He was the chief minister of Bihar, India?s stateless state, who played the caste card with aplomb. Such was his nonchalance that when he was forced to relinquish his chief ministership under the shadow of corruption charges, he appointed his unlettered wife as his successor. He seemed to be the most unlikely candidate to mastermind a modern and efficient railway system. Yet this is precisely what he is in the process of accomplishing. He has demonstrated that it is possible for a huge public sector undertaking to be profitable and efficient.

 Mr Prasad?s transformation, and Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s reinvention of himself as a champion of private investment, would suggest that what is considered impossible in the natural world is a distinct possibility in the world of politics. Politicians can change their spots. Politicians in their present incarnation can become the exact opposite of what they were in a previous avatar. This should not be a surprise in a culture that celebrates virodh bhakti. Mr Prasad has worshipped so devoutly at the altar of populism that he has now become a reformist; and Mr Bhattacharjee?s antipathy to capital has made him a free marketeer. Mr Prasad?s change is more remarkable because his demeanour and his behaviour did not convey any impression of either sobriety or seriousness. He struck almost everybody as the kind of person who would take the railways for a ride and would make all trains go via Patna. Mr Prasad, by his performance as railways minister, has left all his detractors with chhatu on their faces.

 One example of Mr Prasad?s approach is the position he has taken towards passenger fares. His challenge was the lower fares being offered by airlines. He met this by slashing fares for air-conditioned travel on trains. This is unprecedented since conventional wisdom always advised in favour of raising fares. Mr Prasad?s bold decision was possible because of the financial buffer he has built. That buffer has been possible because of the increase in the loading limit per wagon, the opening up of freight traffic to private operators and other measures that have hiked up volume and revenue. Mr Prasad has increased productivity and this has worked wonders for the railways. Behind the buffoonery lies solid common sense. Rustic cunning doth a reformer make.

 GROWING UP

 The self-appointed head prefect of the world has rewarded a bad boy of the class. There may be a happy message in that but the reward has to be seen in a particular context. The last time the same head prefect decided to treat a bad boy with special distinction, the quantum of the reward was much greater than in the present case. China, in the early Seventies, was not only accorded the status of a superpower, but a seat in the security council of the United Nations with full veto powers also came with that recognition. The ending of India?s nuclear isolation comes with no added frills. It is at best a second prize which seems to have warmed the cockles of every one?s heart in the Indian foreign policy establishment. The president of the United States of America, Mr George W. Bush and his team came with a gift, India had to prepare the conditions which would make the granting of the gift possible. This may not be in keeping with India?s image of itself as a global superpower.

 This dimunition of stature is somewhat self-inflicted. India?s foreign policy since the middle Sixties has been myopic, with the focus on Pakistan. Before that, in the days of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indian foreign policy had a vision. Nehru thought like a world statesman and wanted India to be the key player in Asian geo-politics, and an important voice in international affairs. Not every one agreed with the way that Nehru went about winning international and Asian laurels for India but nobody denied the vision and its grand scope. After Nehru, there grew the obsession with Pakistan. India reduced itself to a south Asian player when the need of the time was for it to emerge as a counterweight to China. It did not behave like a global player and was thus not treated like one. The change in perceptions about India in the West is contingent on a conjuncture of circumstances.

 The US?s viewing of India as an important strategic ally in Asia has to be placed in the obvious context of China?s emergence as a superpower in military and economic terms. For Washington, it is uncomfortable to have the presence of one superpower in Asia. Its previous ally in Asia, Pakistan, is not big enough, is too close to China and under the shadow of US?s number one bogey, Islamic fundamentalism. The obvious choice for the US is India: increasingly powerful in economic terms, militarily responsible despite Pokhran II, and with a track record of combating terrorism. Within the framework of the ?clash of civlizations?? theory which informs the thinking of US mandarins, India occupies a safe middle ground. India, in spite of a few transgressions, can be trusted but not enough to be given the best honours.

 India no longer sits below the salt. It has been called to the high table. But India?s foreign policy and India?s outlook on the world have to grow into the stature to which India has been elevated. Only then can the champagne be uncorked.

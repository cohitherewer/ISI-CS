 IN THE CLAWS OF THE EAGLE

Twenty-Twenty / Bharat Bhushan

 Unequal ties

 While there is still cautious optimism about the Indo-US nuclear deal going through the US Congress by this July, things may no longer be too rosy from the Indian point of view.

 The foreign office spin doctors have been remarkably low-key about the Delhi round of talks held from June 12 to 14. Normally, they are over enthusiastic about putting a positive spin on such discussions.

 This may have something to do with the complexity of the issues involved and the less than expected progress made in this round. India had probably hoped that the draft of the bilateral Indo-US agreement (known as the ?123? agreement in popular parlance after Section 123 of the US Atomic Energy Act of 1954, which needs to be modified by the US Congress to allow nuclear cooperation with other countries) would be finalized in this round of discussions. But that has apparently not happened.

 It seems that there are two tricky issues involved in finalizing the agreement. The first relates to the formulation on nuclear testing. New Delhi has been reluctant to say anything more than reiterating its voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests.

 There is a provision in American law that triggers economic sanctions against any country that conducts nuclear tests. India?s case is that nuclear testing is not a bilateral issue and, therefore, should not be brought into a bilateral agreement. India thought that the Bush administration would agree to this reasonable argument. Perhaps it has not.

 India, it seems, also wanted a clear assurance of fuel supply for the lifespan of its safeguarded reactors in the ?123? agreement. Perhaps the United States of America has been reluctant to build this provision in the bilateral agreement because perpetual fuel supply is linked to the inspection regime (or ?India-specific safeguards?) that New Delhi negotiates with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 The US Congress is insistent on examining the details of the India-specific inspections regime negotiated with the IAEA before it acts to amend the law permitting civilian nuclear cooperation with India. This reflects its apprehension that the inspection regime may not meet the non-proliferation concerns of the US Congress and the powerful non-proliferation lobby in that country. Therefore, there is pressure on India to raise the level of safeguards (the intrusiveness of the inspections) to meet these concerns. 

 If New Delhi insists on a bilateral provision on assured lifetime fuel supply, then the US, in effect, becomes a negotiating party with the IAEA on India-specific safeguards. It will no longer be possible for New Delhi to negotiate with the IAEA without taking the US factor into account.

 In the early stages of the negotiations, New Delhi had only wanted ?facility-specific? safeguards ? if a nuclear plant or facility used imported fuel or technology then for the period of their use it would come under the inspections regime. However, some powerful countries in the Nuclear Suppliers Group insisted that the US ask for ?perpetual safeguards? ? subject Indian civilian nuclear plants and facilities to an inspections regime for their entire lifetime.

 Having agreed to this demand, India has to negotiate an India-specific inspections regime that is as close as possible to full-scope safeguards (intrusive inspections regime for countries with no nuclear weapons). This will obviously constrict India?s strategic nuclear programme.

 To balance this ?negative? in the deal a ?positive? spin was given saying that India would be allowed to stockpile fuel. Stockpiling of fuel for the lifetime of nuclear plants is a complex issue ? the capital locked up will be huge; uranium ore suppliers know that its price will not remain static and if there is a shift to nuclear power in any big way internationally, then the pricing will become a crucial negotiating issue. It makes no sense to lock ourselves into this kind of propaganda unnecessarily.

 The point is that the US should not have had any need to raise the issue of India?s agreement with the IAEA after a detailed plan separating civilian (under an inspections regime) and military facilities (with no international inspections) had been accepted by Washington and was placed in the Indian parliament. Yet, Washington wants to oversee the negotiations of the inspections regime.

 Washington clearly wants to be able to say that it is not changing the text of the joint statements of July 18, 2005 or of March 2, 2006 in any way. But it continues to push its agenda by putting pressure through the language of the ?123? agreement, the India-specific safeguards agreement with the IAEA and the proposed amendments to the NSG guidelines.

 New Delhi?s predicament is that it no longer has only one party to negotiate with. Behind the US administration are two parties that it cannot negotiate with directly ? the US Congress and the members of the NSG, some of whom like Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Japan and Germany are critical of the Indo-US deal in varying degrees. They are not negotiating with New Delhi but they continue to make demands on the Bush administration, which passes the pressure on to India.

 The bargain was that after India had fulfilled its obligations under the July 18 agreement, the US would then do three things: negotiate a formal ?123? agreement with India; persuade the US Congress to change American laws that currently bar nuclear cooperation with India; and convince the NSG to relax its rules that currently prevent nuclear trade with India.

 Instead the Bush administration not only wants India to placate the US Congress and the NSG but also to vote in a particular way on Iran, not build the pipeline from Iran via Pakistan to India, and so on. On the Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty, India supports international verification but has been forced to say that it will work with the US on a draft in the Conference on Disarmament which has no provision for verification.

 In effect, India is being pushed to yield space even in areas where it might not have had any intention of doing so. This is perhaps what those who claim that the deal does not need to be changed but only re-balanced mean.

 How then does the deal look from today?s vantage point? There is a realization that the Bush administration would have to put a lot of its political capital on line and pull its weight as much as possible to get the deal through the US Congress. The Democrats are still not satisfied with the present contours of the deal. Hillary Clinton is not on board on the Democrat side and this may pose a problem. The India Caucus has also not delivered on supporting the deal. While the India Caucus itself has nearly 170 members, there are only thirty-odd co-sponsors for amending the US law.

 In case the timeline for the agreement slips the June-July deadline, thereafter the focus shifts to Congressional elections due in October. Were this to happen, the Indo-US deal would then get pushed to the new Congressional cycle.

 So the situation no longer looks as good as it did earlier. India is trapped in an unequal relationship with the US and has little option but to placate it constantly.

 ALL IN THE FAMILY

 Cubans do not seem to know if they should hail it as a model of revolutionary brotherhood. Mr Fidel Castros proclamation was no surprise to them or to the world. That he had chosen his brother, Mr Raul Castro, to succeed him was well known. But it is impossible to miss the irony in Mr Fidel Castros proclamation. Here is a leader who set out to bring about revolutionary changes at home and abroad. Now, as a serious illness forces him to give up the power he wielded for nearly 50 years, the only person he can trust is his brother. For a communist leader like Mr Fidel Castro, there is more to it than dynastic ambition. At one level, it is an extreme form of a cabalistic rule that is distrustful of people outside the coterie. At another, Mr Fidel Castros decision betrays the sense of insecurity with which dictators live and rule. There have been other examples of family members of communist leaders usurping power. The infamous Gang of Four of China, led by Mao Zedongs wife, Jiang Qing, imposed its ruinous rule over China even before the death of the great helmsman. It is another matter that she and her group lost out in the power struggle in the Chinese communist party after Maos death. 

 Dynastic rule can flourish only in the absence of democracy. The Cuban exiles and dissidents in Miami who celebrated the news of Mr Fidel Castros decision to step aside may have done so a little too early. It would be unfair to deny the reign of Mr Fidel Castro some positive developments. The island nation, which has suffered enormously because of the economic sanctions imposed by the United States of America, has achieved some significant successes in social sectors such as health and education. But Cubans also have had to pay a heavy price for Mr Fidel Castros ideological confrontations with the US. Democracy at home and normal international relations could have made life easier and more secure for Cubans. In a curious coincidence, Mr Fidel Castros proclamation making his brother his successor came on a day that witnessed a historic change in another part of the world. In Nepal, the day saw the countrys parliament take away the last of the monarchs powers to choose his successor and draft a piece of legislation that would enable women to succeed to the throne. By contrast, the change in Cuba is from dictatorial to family rule.

 AN ACTRESS PREPARES 

- Konkona Sen Sharma represents the properly pan-Indian actor 

MUKUL KESAVAN

 Scene from Mr and Mrs Iyer 

Konkona Sen Sharma is the best young Indian actress 

there is. Or, not to be ageist, the best Indian actress around. And if these categories 

werent gendered by the Filmfare awards and the Oscars, it would be simpler 

and truer to say that Konkona Sen Sharma is the best Indian actor in the business.

She has acted in other movies, but I base this on 

the evidence of two films: Mr and Mrs Iyer and Omkara. In the first 

film, where the principal actors (Konkona Sen Sharma and Rahul Bose) speak English, 

she plays a young Tamil woman. In Omkara, a Hindi movie where the large 

cast speaks a western UP dialect with varying degrees of conviction, she plays 

a cameo role. Shes Saif Ali Khans woman, the mother of his child. Since Saif 

is playing Iago in Bharadwajs cover version of Othello, she has enough 

to do.

Opinions will vary on the quality of the two films. 

For what its worth, I think Mr and Mrs Iyer is several good films in one: 

its a great road movie (being a great Indian road movie it uses public transport), 

its a hill station film with a difference and along the way it manages to be 

an affecting drama about the communal traumas that afflict India, without being 

hectoring or worthy as parallel cinema in Hindi too often is. Omkara is 

an ambitious attempt to set Othello in north Indias badlands, but one 

thats hobbled and then defeated by the fact that its Desdemona (Kareena Kapoor) 

and Othello (Ajay Devgan) cant act at all. I suspect both these films will chiefly 

be remembered as vehicles for Konkonas early work.

Viewed separately, Konkona Sen Sharmas performances 

are remarkable. Taken together they suggest something even more formidable. Consider 

this: for the whole of Mr and Mrs Iyer, she speaks English in the way a 

middle-class Tamil girl educated in a missionary school would. I have Tamilian 

and Kannadiga relatives who have heard south Indian accents lampooned over a lifetime 

by comedians in Hindi films. Mehmood, for example, did the definitive Hindi movie 

Madrasi in Padosan. These are people who are thin-skinned about the way 

in which outsiders play south Indians, and they are agreed, down to the last Amma, 

that Konkona Sen Sharma was letter perfect.

In Omkara, she was so convincing as Desdemonas 

rustic, profane north Indian sakhi that I didnt recognize her at all and 

assumed right through the film that she was some new talent recruited from the 

Hindi theatre, possibly the National School of Dramas repertory company. She 

spoke the dialect with conviction, dispensed lewd folk wisdom as if she had grown 

up in Meerut or Rohilkhand and managed to look plausible through an absurd late 

scene where, made up like an avenging Durga, she kills Saifs Iago.

I cant think of any other Indian actor past or present, 

who has switched manner and accent so persuasively in two films that its hard 

to accept that its the same person and, further, someone who has done it across 

languages. Its instructive to try and think of one. Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri 

are great actors but I cant see them sounding plausibly Sylheti in some densely 

dialectal Bengali film. Shabana Azmi has acted wonderfully in the two languages 

of the north Indian middle-classes, Hindustani and English, but when you watch 

her play a south Indian singer in Morning Raga, speaking English inflected 

with a south Indian accent, you realize at once what a delicate and finely judged 

performance Konkona Sens is in Mr and Mrs Iyer.

One could argue in a generalizing way that she belongs 

to a generation of young metropolitan Indians whose speech isnt as conspicuously 

marked by their mother-tongues as that of an earlier generation of Indians was. 

Thus when Suchitra Sen plays a fictionalized Mrs Gandhi in Aandhi, her 

Hindi is essentially Bengali by other means. Uttam Kumar in Amanush must 

have thought he was speaking Hindi, but no one in the audience did. Similarly, 

Hema Malini and a whole generation of south Indian actresses in Hindi cinema let 

you know where they were from the moment they opened their mouths.

But even amongst her contemporaries, her virtuosity 

is striking. You could make a case for Vidya Balan, ancestrally south Indian, 

who played Lolita with great flair and charm in Parineeta while speaking 

standard received Hindi unmarked by any trace of an accent. Except that standard 

Hindi is the language of Bombay cinema so Vidya Balans fluency in it is commendable 

but not startling.

The modern, mobile, metropolitan Indian has, if anything, 

a linguistic disability. He/she is generally inexpressive in two languages. Within 

certain sections of the urban elite, English has so completely colonized the part 

of the brain that deals in language that the mother-tongue is only used for rudimentary 

transactions like buying cigarettes or thanking plebeians. Konkona Sens male 

lead in Mr and Mrs Iyer, Rahul Bose, has cornered the market on this sort 

of character ever since he played Agastya in English, August. He does what 

he does very well but the way in which he speaks English not just in this film, 

but every film, pretty much defines the neutral English accent of the great Indian 

metropolis. In Mr and Mrs Iyer he is Muslim, but in his manner he is the 

upwardly mobile Everyman. His careful impassiveness is the perfect foil for Konkonas 

virtuoso rendering of Tamil-ness.

In fact, Konkona has been well served by her fellow 

actors in both films. Kareena Kapoor and Ajay Devgan in Omkara have clearly 

been cast for their physical properties rather than their acting abilities. This 

being Othello, the hero has to be black or at least dark-skinned and not 

pretty. Ajay Devgan fills that bill better than any hero in Hindi cinema today. 

Conversely, Desdemona has to be light-skinned and conspicuously of the babalog 

and who better than Kareena Kapoor to represent that type? By choosing to cast 

his main characters in this way, Dark Machismo and Pale Poshness, Bhardwaj makes 

things clear but also so woodenly symbolic that not even Konkonas masterly cameo 

can keep the film from keeling over. Amid the wreckage, her performance and Saif 

Ali Khans stand out in stark contrast.

Konkona Sen Sharma represents within Indian cinema 

the prospect of properly pan-Indian actors, who have the intelligence, the linguistic 

ability and the mimetic genius to plausibly inhabit the skins of characters from 

parts of India that are not their own. The small body of work she has produced 

is a kind of precedent. To have done that in relative youth is a remarkable achievement.

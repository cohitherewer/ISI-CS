 OUT IN THE COLD

 Can these elections see a revival of the Congress?s fortunes in West Bengal? The answer to this question could determine the shape of the state?s politics beyond the polls. Bengal is not the only state where the Congress has been out in the cold for a long time. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, India?s oldest party does not fare any better. Unlike in those two states, though, the party?s decline in Bengal is primarily the handiwork of Ms Mamata Banerjee, who deserted it to float the Trinamool Congress. For long after the Congress lost power to the left in Bengal, it remained a strong and viable opposition. Actually, the Congress retained nearly 40 per cent of the popular votes ? much more than it secured in many other states ? until Ms Banerjee walked away with the major portion of the party?s vote share. The party has since sought to recover lost ground in alliance with her party. A similar attempt failed this time, thanks to her insistence on retaining her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party. But the failure of the alliance could be the Congress?s opportunity to try and rebuild the party in Bengal. The party now leads the ruling coalition at the Centre. The parliamentary polls of 2004 and the civic contests the following year have seen some signs of a turnaround in the Congress?s position in the state. The assembly polls now offer it another chance to build on those small successes. 

 However, much has to change in the party?s ways in Bengal before it can regain its lost territory. The squabbles in the party over the distribution of assembly tickets show how wrong things still are. This is not the first time that ugly shows of indiscipline and factionalism have accompanied the party?s poll campaigns. This may not be the right party spirit, but no party in India is completely free from such failings. The real problem for the party seems to be the lack of an active and purposeful leadership. It is not a question of the leadership qualities of Mr Pranab Mukherjee, Mr Priya Ranjan Das Munshi or any other senior Congressman of the state. The real question is whether the leadership has a vision for its role in Bengal. Several presidents of the party?s state unit have seen themselves more as caretakers than as leaders with a full-time job. The Congress high command too has to make a new beginning for reclaiming Bengal. But before it can regain the state, the party has to clean up its own house.

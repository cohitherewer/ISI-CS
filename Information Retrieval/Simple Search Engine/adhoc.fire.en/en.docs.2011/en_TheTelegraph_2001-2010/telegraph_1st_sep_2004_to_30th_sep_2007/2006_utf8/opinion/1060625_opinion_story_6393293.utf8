The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Whoever it was that pinned Rakhi Sawant back and kissed her hard, it couldn?t have been Mika Singh. For, when he was 16, his brother Daler had told him that kissing could give him a throat infection. And surely, a musical soul such as Mika cannot risk kissing after such a dire warning. Besides, Mika does not even know ?how to smooch?, and has ?never kissed anyone on the mouth?. No, not even one of his three girlfriends. Most men have machismo. Mika has true innocence: which other young man worth his boot-cuts would admit to not knowing how to kiss? The lips which are supposed to bear the imprint of Mika?s untutored art have twitched in reaction, formed the question, ?What was it if it wasn?t a kiss??, and gone on to smile that ice-melting smile at the chairman of the National Commission for Women, Girija Vyas. Mika, of course, has no time for NCW, which, he feels, is only interested in celebrity ?cases? so that ?its members are shown on television?. Watch out Mika, if you thought Rakhi was hot, the starched-sari brigade of NCW may prove to be hotter.

 Guess who?s been reading up on Rakhi Sawant these days? The leaders at the BJP headquarters. But only because they were bewildered by this skimpily-clad lady who had pushed all of them out of the front pages. Who is this Rakhi Sawant? Venkaiah Naidu was apparently asking anyone who would listen, while Prakash Javdekar, with his Mumbai links, was giving everyone the necessary details. Heard in the din: Sawant must have been planted by the UPA to divert the media?s attention from the BJP?s pro-people agitations.

 One does not have to be Yes Minister-literate to know that bureaucrats and ministers aren?t the best of friends. But going by the tradition in Indian states, the chief secretary usually shares a comfortable equation with the chief minister. Not in Maharashtra though. It is war between the CM, Vilas Rao Deshmukh, and the state chief secretary, T. Shankaran ? all because the latter is close to the Mumbai Congress chief, not one of Deshmukh?s favourites. Communication between CM and CS ? and, by extension, the administration ? has all but collapsed. Shankaran refuses to follow the CM?s orders, while Deshmukh strikes down all his suggestions. And who pays the price for this clash of egos? The people, of course.

 The people, better known as aam aadmi, are perpetually on the losing side. And now, the Congress has restricted their entry into the AICC headquarters. Party leaders have also been issued strict instructions not to write recommendations for their followers to this minister or that secretary. The air within and around 24 Akbar Road is heavy with apprehension. What if the aam aadmi decides to turn away from the party after this?

 With the streets of Indian cities glittering with hip and happening new cars, the duck-like Ambassador has become more of an embarrassment than a sign of prosperity. Its fadeout as the ?vehicle of governance? began three years ago, with the then PM, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, switching to BMW. The most recent states to desert Hindustan Motors? flagship car are Bihar and Rajasthan. Nitish Kumar?s ministers will go about their work henceforth on Scorpios, while Tata?s Indigo is the new preferred car for the ministers of Rajasthan. But the Rajasthan chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, will settle for nothing less than a Mercedes E 340. Thank god she?s not a communist!

 We?ve seen wooing of the Dalits, OBCs, minorities, and so on. But here comes the mother of all wooings ? that of the proletariat. With a little help from its communist friends, the UPA government is planning to gift the nation its first university for workers. There might be another one in the offing ? for the unorganized sector ? given that 70 per cent of India?s labour force work in this sector. These universities will produce skilled workers, who will come up to international standards. The INTUC chief, Sanjeeva Reddy, was going to submit his report on the matter in June. But this being a complicated and sensitive subject, he will only be able to do so in July. But if skill is going to be the new buzzword, hopefully jobs which truly demand skill, such as governance, will also get a few ?skilled? workers.

 Transparency in governance just got a new definition, thanks to Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister of state for commerce. Ramesh?s office at the Udyog Bhavan has recently been done up in glass so that the minister can be seen working at his laptop, looking at files, or meeting guests. Insiders reveal that Ramesh also tried to bring down all wooden doors in the department and replace them with glass ones. But he faced stiff resistance from the staff who were already annoyed since they could no longer flaunt their importance to visitors with the words ?Mantriji busy hai?. Ramesh, however, prefers to pass off the makeover as ?a matter of individual taste?. The ?taste? of another individual is also on show in the same building ? that of Kamal Nath, who has been having a running tiff with his deputy, Ramesh. No wonder then that Kamal Nath?s office is a solemn statement in teak. Between style and rivalry, the ministry is known to have been lighter by quite a few lakhs.

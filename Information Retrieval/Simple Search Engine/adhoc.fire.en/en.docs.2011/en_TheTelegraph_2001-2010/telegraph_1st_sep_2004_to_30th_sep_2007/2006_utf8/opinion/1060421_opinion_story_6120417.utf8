 Strange creatures everywhere

How Opal Mehta Got 

Kissed Got Wild and Got a Life (Time Warner, ? 2.99) by Kaavya 

Viswanathan is sure to grab attention by virtue of its name. Opal Mehta was 

six years old when her parents prepared a plan named HOWGIH, or How Opal Will 

Get Into Harvard: ?Cello lessons starting at five, four different foreign-language 

classes starting at six, leadership seminars, Math camp, even six months of welding 

classes and a year of mosaic arts courses that were offered at the Paramus Senior 

Citizens Center.? Just before she was whisked into the interview, her father whispered, 

?And Opal, don?t forget PISS.? Noting the confused look of the Dean, Opal explained, 

?It stands for Positivity, Intelligence, Sophistication, Success.? But when Opal 

was all geared up to talk about her writing clubs and foreign-language proficiency, 

the Dean decided to ask what she did for fun. After the sad interview episode 

begins Operation HOWGAL, How Opal Will Get A Life. Let?s say this much, she gets 

it in style.

Atrophy in Dalit Politics 

(Vikas Adhyayan Kendra, Rs 200) edited by Gopal Guru is the first 

in the Dalit Intellectual Collective?s series of ?interventions?. The provocative 

epigraph by Babasaheb Ambedkar criticizes the ?policy of least resistance? for 

not compelling thoughts, since it does not produce crisis. The politicization 

of the Dalit concerns have been explained, rather succinctly, through the metaphor 

of touch-me-not plants, which shrink the moment they are touched. Sharmila Rege 

attempts to assign a subaltern feminist position to Dalit women.

The Boastful Centipede 

and Other Creatures in Verse (Puffin, Rs 150) by Zai Whitaker 

has beautiful little poems on diverse subjects such as the cockroach?s regard 

for animal lovers, eating habits of mongooses and the ?ten-tackling? habits of 

sea-anemones, the comforts enjoyed by crapdoor spiders and so on. What makes the 

book perfect for young readers is that each poem is preceded by a little note 

on the creatures which is the subject of the poem. The cockroach?s address to 

the animal lover goes thus: ?Yes you love your own dog and cat/ But when it comes 

to me/ Your only comment is a screech ?/ A loud and frightened ?EEEEE?!

 ?You carefully water your noisy birds/ And carrot your ugly horse/ You purr so sweetly to the cat/ But do nothing for me, of course.

 ?Look at my wonderful varnished wings/ That gleam a golden red!/ But the only cockroach you seem to like/ Is one that?s thoroughly dead.?

Toward a New World 

(Rupa, Rs 295) by Dominique de Villepin brings together the French 

prime minister?s ?speeches, essays and interviews on the war in Iraq, the UN, 

and the changing face of Europe?. Explaining France?s position vis-a-vis 

the war, Villepin stressed at the UN in 2002 that ?France shares the US?s determination 

to resolve a crisis which threatens us all. But she refuses the risk of an intervention 

which would not take all the demands of collective security fully into account.? 

The true reward of the book is the additional debate and commentary by the likes 

of Norman Mailer, Mario Vargas Llosa and Susan Sontag.

A Photographic Guide 

to the Birds of India (Wisdom Tree, Rs 395) by Amano Samarpan, 

rather strangely, begins with a quote by Osho. The bird topography, and the Hindi 

names of the birds are useful. The photographs are of very good quality, but the 

text often fails to match them. The accompanying picture is of the Coppersmith 

Barbet, or the Thathera Basantha, a name that comes from its ?penetrating ?tok! 

tok? call?.

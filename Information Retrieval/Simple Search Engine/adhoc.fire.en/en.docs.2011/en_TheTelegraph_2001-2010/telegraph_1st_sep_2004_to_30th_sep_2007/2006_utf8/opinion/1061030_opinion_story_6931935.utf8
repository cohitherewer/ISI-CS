The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BREEDING TERROR

 Bangladeshs fledgling democracy is on trial once again. This is not the first time that the animosity between the two major political groups has spilled on to the streets. A complete lack of trust between the government and the opposition has long made the countrys democratic system almost dysfunctional, irrespective of which group has been in power. The latest chaos, though, is the handiwork more of the government of Ms Khaleda Zia, whose five-year term expired last week, than of the Awami League-led opposition. The changeover to an interim, non-partisan government is a constitutional provision. But Ms Zias choice of the head of the interim government betrayed a design to subvert the spirit of the constitution. Her nominee, although a retired chief justice of the supreme court, had once been an advisor to her own Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Worse, she insisted on her choice despite the oppositions firm and justified refusal to accept it. To choose a person with a partisan background is to interfere with free and fair elections.

 The world and India, in particular should worry about the developments in Bangladesh. Lawlessness creates space for terrorists to operate in. The tenure of Ms Zia had seen Bangladesh emerging as a major breeding ground of Islamist terrorists. What was even more worrying for both peace-loving Bangladeshis and the international community was the fact that elements within her government were suspected to have had links with some terrorist groups. It was also accused of using terrorist organizations in order to contain the oppositions political challenge. Even the large group of politicians who deserted her and formed the new Liberal Democratic Party made the same allegations. This has been the greatest damage her government seems to have caused to democracy and society in Bangladesh. The world has a stake in saving democracy in Bangladesh. It is not something that should worry New Delhi alone, although India suffers the worst from the collapse of order and the rise of terrorism in Bangladesh. But an Indian response to the events in Dhaka must be bolder and more imaginative than it has been in the recent past.

 SPLIT VALUE

 The split between the Ambani brothers has, in the end, proved to be a bonanza for shareholders of Reliance Industries Limited. With the listing of all the four demerged companies ? Reliance Capital Ventures, Reliance Energy Ventures, Reliance Natural Resources and Reliance Communications Ventures ? the total increase in market capitalization adds up to around Rs 35,000 crore, which is the difference between RIL?s listed price on the last day of trading prior to the demerger and the current market price of RIL and the four demerged companies. And if the initial date is pushed back to the day the settlement between the brothers was announced last June, then the increase in value will be much more. Clearly, splitting up the company has unlocked a lot of value. One reason is that conglomerates are generally valued at a lower price-earnings multiple compared to more focused companies because investors like pure sectoral plays. 

 There is no reason why, for example, an investor in petrochemicals should have to put his money in telecommunications as well. And if there is a need to diversify one?s portfolio, the investor can do it on his own, rather than by investing in a conglomerate. Further, there is now comfort that the two brothers will be free to pursue growth opportunities without any undercurrent of tension. For instance, Mr Mukesh Ambani?s group has been quick to announce its plans for entering the retail sector, dispelling all speculation about the group being stuck in cyclical commodity industries while his brother, Mr Anil Ambani, got the glamorous growth businesses. Also, the different companies are now free to enter into joint ventures, private equity deals and other partnerships.

 But there are many lessons to be learnt from the Reliance split. One of them is that it has, ironically, led to a vast increase in transparency for the group. The fight brought many secrets out into the open and let some sunshine in into the maze of cross-holdings and investment companies of the group. At the same time, the demerger process could have been handled better. Shareholders in the demerged entities, for instance, have had to wait for over a month before the stocks were listed. The market regulator should now overhaul the rules and regulations for demergers and plug the loopholes in corporate governance that were thrown up as a result of the split. But perhaps the most important point raised by the split and the subsequent impact on shareholders is that for all business families that do not yet have a clear-cut succession plan and a sharing of assets, the current market boom is the right time to put these in place.

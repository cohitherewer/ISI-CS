 Letters to Editor

 Not a jot of care

 Sir ? The photograph of the railway minister, Lalu Prasad, holding a garland at the wedding reception of his daughter, on the very day the kidnapped engineer, K. Suryanarayana, was beheaded in Afghanistan, is representative of the callousness that has become the identifying characteristic of Indian politicians (May 1). Almost all the Union ministers who attended the wedding, later uttered the usual words of regret over the death. But Suryanarayana died as a pawn in an international game of power. The least our politicians could have done by way of offering condolences was to stay away from festivities that day. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 On the contrary

 Sir ? The United States of America and the United Kingdom are always proclaiming how important it is to them that their people should enjoy freedom of speech and action. But when people started protesting against their policies in Iraq, both London and Washington DC were aggressive in their eagerness to suppress any voice of dissent. The news report ?Susan reveals cost of defiance? (April 30), is a testimony to the hypocrisy practised by the Big Brothers. The death threats received by Susan Sarandon for opposing the Iraq war raise fundamental questions about the limits of one?s freedom in a democratic country. It is a point to ponder that while countries like India are criticized by the First World as a place where the people have no respect for each other?s freedom of belief, intolerance is rampant in America itself, which projects itself as the land of the free. The situation is almost the same in the UK, as indicated by the fact that Tony Blair?s government started suspecting the British Muslims and questioning their loyalty to the state if they happened to oppose the attack on Iraq. The governments? control of people?s right to free- dom makes a mockery of democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is not surprising that the Hollywood actress, Susan Sarandon, should get death threats because of her protests against the US invasion of Iraq. People do get ostracized even in the democratic countries of the world for swimming against the tide. If artists and writers get into trouble because they believe in individual freedom, then it is unfortunate. Sarandon has always been known for her political activism and leftist views. Indeed, she stands out among other actor-turned-activists in upholding her views over the years. The death threats she got is the price she has to pay for daring to hold independent views in a country where the government uses its power to hush people into conformity. If, as Sarandon claims, even teachers and the media had targeted her because of her views, then one cannot help despairing at the extent to which even these mouthpieces of independent thought have been taken over by the government. This raises serious doubts about the future of the free-thinking individual in a world of universal surveillance.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The threats issued to Susan Sarandon should act as a warning to Indian celebrities who turn activist once their career begins to flag. The problem with these celebrities is that they hardly have any genuine interest in the causes they profess to uphold and are more interested in hogging the limelight. Sarandon?s defiant speeches against the US government are consistent with the upright roles she usually plays in her movies. She probably had not foreseen that her comments would meet such hostile reaction from the press and the public. Indian actors should learn from this and think twice before making comments that might just bring them more attention than they had bargained for, and that too of the unpleasant kind. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Flights of insecurity

 Sir A Kuwaiti airplane closely skirting the no-fly zone over the prime ministers residence exposes the lackadaisical attitude of the Indian air force (Chill of 9/11 as Kuwait plane heads for PM house, Nov 14). In spite of repeated threat mails from terrorist organizations, the emergency mechanism failed to react. What will happen to civilians security if the prime ministers residence is so poorly guarded? No matter what the officials think, the jihadis will never let go of any opportunity that comes their way. Such lapses might prove to be very costly.

 Yours faithfully,

 Death on the fast lane

 Sir Alistair Pareira and his inebriated friends should not be spared as their reckless conduct took seven innocent lives (Drunk youths run over 7, Nov 13). They mirror a sizeable section of todays youth who often indulge in unhealthy ways of merry-making and become ruthless, irresponsible and insensitive citizens. If the culprits are not punished this time, many spoilt youngsters might repeat the crime, thinking that they too will get away with it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahelaka Begum, Calcutta

 Sir There is nothing wrong in it, said the councillor of Bandra, Kavita Rodrigues, referring to the road accident that killed seven people sleeping on the pavements of Carter Road (Sympathy for Toyota Six, Nov 14). What was not wrong? Was it the drunken driving or the killing of innocent people? Alistair Pareiras father apparently criticized the police, saying that Salman Khan was not kept in custody for a similar crime. If the police made a mistake four years ago, it is only natural that they would not do so now. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.K. Anwar, Calcutta

 Sir With alcohol being indirectly responsible for the death of poor pavement-dwellers in Mumbai, it is time the Supreme Court directs the states to strictly enforce the ban on drinking while driving. Alistair Pareira and his friends may be behind bars, but they have been preceded by some so-called responsible citizens like Neel Chatterjee and Manish Khatau, both of whom were top corporate professionals. The youth of the country cannot be blamed for learning from the precedents set by their seniors. So we must set the right examples for our youngsters to follow. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Drunk youths run over 7 is neither the first news story of its kind nor, we fear, the last. What is surprising is that the rate of conviction in such cases is extremely poor, primarily because most of the accused are wards of the rich and famous. They can always hire lawyers like Ram Jethmalani, who can turn the case in their clients favour. Without a shade of remorse or guilt, these young men soon get back to their fast and reckless life.

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir Since the Carter road accident has had similar precedents, what will follow is predictable. First, by the time the case is placed in court, the car will have magically transformed itself into a truck, a tractor, a bulldozer anything but a car. Second, the eyewitnesses will suffer inexplicable failures of memory when it comes to identifying the accused. There will be no candle-lit processions for the pavement-dwelling victims as there were for Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo. For the Indian middle class, the culprits this time are from their ranks or higher while the victims are not. Therefore, little sympathy will go out to those whose deaths are of no consequence in any case.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong

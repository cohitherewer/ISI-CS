 REACTING TO THE PAST

 Muslims in the Deccan: A Historical Survey By Omar Khalidi, 

 Global Media, Rs 400

 Sometime back, Japan apologized for its aggression during World War II. Then there was the Indian prime minister who begged forgiveness for the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. And now Omar Khalidi, has sought apology from the Indian government to Muslims, especially those of the erstwhile Hyderabad state, ?for the excesses committed by the armed gangs under the control of its coercive agencies in September-December 1948?. According to him, over 2 lakh Muslims were eliminated following the Indian army?s invasion of Hyderabad. Though code-named Operation Polo, the Indian establishment calls the operation during the annexation of Hyderabad a ?police action?.

 Dubbing the massacre a ?hidden Holocaust? the author questions ?India?s stony silence on and denial? of the genocide. Khalidi says, ?It is reminiscent of the Nazi denial in the case of the Jews and the more recent Serb denial in the case of Bosnian Muslims?. According to the book, when the Indian military invasion ended in Hyderabad?s collapse on September 18, 1948, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru went on All India Radio to announce ?the end of police action?. Khalidi feels that Nehru wanted to hoodwink the world into believing that India, after the assassination of Gandhi, was still following the ideals of non-violence. 

 Quoting from the Deccan Chronicle (January 13, 1993) Khalidi writes: ?Congress militants burnt down railway stations, attacked police stations and looted their arms? Narasimha Rao (who later became the Prime Minister) indulged in gun-running from Chanda in the erstwhile Bombay province ? he shuttled between Chanda, Nagpur, Pune, Bombay and Bangalore to smuggle arms and ammunition which he procured from the cantonments and other sources.? The evidence of violence, he further writes, is becoming stronger.

 The book, which is a compilation of articles published in various newspapers and journals, makes several disclosures. It says that after Operation Polo 7,000 Arabs, neither born in Hyderabad nor married to a Hyderabadi, were placed in camps, registered and deported to Aden. In the same way, 200 Pathans were deported to Afghanistan. Arabs and Pathans used to serve in the armies of the Nizam and the Maratha Peshwas. 

 Khalidi says that about 700 Indian army personnel had deserted during the Operation Polo. The book has the potential to raise a serious controversy, nevertheless it is full of information hitherto unknown.

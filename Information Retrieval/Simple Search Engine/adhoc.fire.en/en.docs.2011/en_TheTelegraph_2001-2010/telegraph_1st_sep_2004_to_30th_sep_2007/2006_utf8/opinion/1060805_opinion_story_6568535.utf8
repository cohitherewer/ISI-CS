 CIRCLE OF PROTECTION

 It is easy to welcome amendments to the law: they bring the law up to date on means to address the newest practices evolved to abuse or evade it since the last time it was amended. So while welcoming the criminal law (amendment) bill, 2003, it is also necessary to ask what made the amendments necessary. The recommendations for change, based on the 154th, 177th and 178th reports of the law commission, seem to address chiefly those problems that spring from social inequalities. For example, protecting citizens against indiscriminate arrests is laudable, but how far is that possible? Too many arrests are driven by the dominant interests at play, political or social. Justice itself may be used as pretext, as in the allegations of the misuse of Section 498A of the criminal procedure code, by which a womans complaint of domestic violence is followed up immediately with the arrest of her husband and in-laws. Yet dowry deaths have been far from eradicated. It is a question of will, attention and professional ethics, not of loopholes in the law. That is why informing the family of a members arrest becomes part of the amendment, although the requirement was always there.

 Of the two most important amendments proposed, one is the right given to victims families to appeal against the verdict if they feel justice has not been done. This seems to be the best thing that has come out of the Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo cases. But taken in association with the other important proposal, that of witness protection, it must also be asked who is to protect this family should the balance of power be on the side of the accused. The changes recommended for the protection of witnesses and of their evidence, and the decision to admit video-recordings as direct evidence, show that the establishment has learnt a hard lesson from Zahira Sheikhs convolutions, and the frequency with which witnesses have turned hostile in recent trials. Such turnarounds are routine in the unspectacular world of the powerless witness, but the popular outrage against these in two back-to-back high-profile trials has stirred the establishment.

 The irony of trying to keep up with problems created by injustices built into the system is best shown in the recommendations regarding cases of sexual violence. In camera trials were recommended earlier for the social and psychological protection of the victim of rape. In actuality, that rendered her defenceless against merciless questioning and silent, even if unintended, intimidation of the justice establishment. So, this time, it has been recommended that her lawyer be present. Similarly, the wisdom of having only women as judges in rape cases can be questioned. This is likely to reverse the possibility of quick trials, given the number of women judges. And on a broader view, should justice be thus gendered, segmented?

 SELLING TUKARAM TO BUY SOME BREAD AND MINCE

 Telling Tales Amit Chaudhuri 

 II. The Kolhapuri

 Kolatkar was born in Kolhapur in Maharashtra (the Western Indian state of which Bombay, now Mumbai, is the capital) in 1932. Kolhapur is famous for its kolhapuris chappals, or slippers, that are designed for outside wear and can be found for sale on the streets, but also as exorbitantly finished and priced objects in shops for the rich. In its casualness, its air of classless elegance, and its itinerary through bewilderingly diverse locations, the kolhapuri is not unlike the bohemian, artistic set in the Fifties, Sixties, and Seventies, who indeed made of it a mark of its identity. Members of this set had an abhorrence of fixity; they could be found on the street, walking past hawkers, prostitutes and traffic lights, as well as in art galleries, seminar rooms, and drawing rooms and cafs with their rituals of food and drink. This was a peculiarly Bombay mixture of proximity and transcendence; Nissim Ezekiel who was the oldest, and also the chief spokesman, of the poets writing in English who began to emerge in the Fifties sought to compress it in these lines from In India: Always, in the suns eye,/ Here, among the beggars,/ Hawkers, pavement sleepers,/ Hutment dwellers, slums/I ride my elephant of thought,/ A Czanne slung around my neck. 

 The journey negotiated in Ezekiels lines physical and cultural between the teeming road in Bombay and Czanne, between recalcitrant, perspiring everydayness and the work of art or, more specifically, the art-world was a real journey to many of the Bombay poets. Ezekiel himself; Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, his MA student at Bombay University; Gieve Patel; Adil Jussawalla all these poet-critics poached and encroached upon the territory of painters (Patel became a considerable painter himself), especially the J.J. School of Art, which, at the time, was producing, in F.N. Souza, M.F. Husain, and others, a premier post-Independence generation (remarkably heterogeneous in class, religious, and regional backgrounds) of Indian painters. 

 The poets seemed to have realized, instinctively, the importance of the moment and of this proximity; for instance, Ezekiels and Jussawallas essays on the Baroda painter Bhupen Khakhar (whod later be taken up by Rushdie), written in the early Seventies, are extraordinarily shrewd readings of the then unremarked upon elements of kitsch and homoeroticism in Khakhars work. That this liaison between a dormant, semi-visible literary culture and a semi-visible tradition of modern art has a parallel in the now-publicized liaison between similar worlds in Fifties and Sixties New York is indisputable; so is the fact of the richness of the interaction. Its unlikely, though, that the Indian poets, despite their admiration for 20th-century American poetry, their enviable and intriguing up-to-dateness, would have known then of Frank O Hara or John Ashbery. Two comparable but not directly relatable metropolitan flirtations between artistic sub-cultures seem to have taken place in two continents within a few years of, and at some points overlapping with, each other. The literary history that might describe, in serious terms, the significance of what happened in that context in Bombay is still to be written, perhaps because the writer in English was, in India, till Rushdie came along accompanied by Booker-inspired fanfare, a sort of elite pariah, a missing person, in Jussawallas words, a figure marginal to the larger, and solemn, task of nation-building. 

 It was into this hybrid society that Kolatkar inserted himself; in 1949, he enrolled at the J.J. School of Art, after which it seems a mysterious phase of drifting and formal as well as spiritual education followed, which few people appear to be clear about. At any rate, he took his diploma as late as 1957; but by this time he was already a graphic artist for the vibrant and upwardly mobile advertising world in Bombay. He was, in advertising jargon, a visualiser; and was to become one of Bombays most successful art directors. All this seems very far away from Jejuri, both the place and the book. The place itself would have been fairly well-known to a certain kind of pilgrim-devotee and follower of the local Maharashtrian deity Khandoba (who began his career as a folk-god, a protector of cattle and sheep, and graduated slowly to Brahminical acceptance as an incarnation of Shiva); but it would probably have been obscure to Kolatkar and his friends. An interdisciplinary, but not disciplined, reader I read across disciplines, and dont necessarily read a book from beginning to end, he said to the poet, Eunice de Souza he claimed, in the same conversation, that he discovered Jejuri in a book on temples and legends of Maharashtra there was a chapter on Jejuri in it. It seemed an interesting place. He went there first in 1963, with his brother Makarand, and his friend, the Marathi novelist Manohar Oak, both of whom, indeed, make appearances in the poem, in laidback, deadpan incarnations that are variations of the narrator. 

 The Sixties, for him, was a time of reappraisal and ferment. After the break-up of his first marriage, he married his second wife, Soonoo (who survives him). The discovery of, and journey towards, places like Jejuri in a time of inner transition, and all that such journeys represent, from the redemptive to the terrifying, is described in Marathi poems like The Turnaround: Bombay made me a beggar./ Kalyan gave me a lump of jaggery to suck./ In a small village that had a waterfall/ but no name/ my blanket found a buyer/ and I feasted on plain ordinary water./ I arrived in Nasik with/ peepul leaves between my teeth./ There I sold my Tukaram/ to buy some bread and mince. (Kolatkars translation) He was writing extraordinary Marathi poems, about the extremities of urban and psychological experience, which seem to be the product of a social outcast whos been dabbling in mind-altering drugs while reading up on Surrealism, William Burroughs, Dashiell Hammett, Indian mythology, and Marathi devotional poets like Tukaram. 

 The last of these was a real enthusiasm, and Kolatkar was translating, into English, the medieval poets rather prickly, belligerent hymns to God. These were as much translations as occasionally tough-guy reworkings of some of the songs; an unsettling form of ventriloquizing. Machismo seemed to have interested him; not only its aura of power, but also its disorienting humour. The proximity between the disreputable, the culpable, and the religious a living strand in Indian devotional culture, and an everyday reality in places like Banaras and Jejuri becomes, in the act of translation, an aesthetic: It was a case/ Of God rob God./ No cleaner job/ Was ever done./ God left God/ Without a bean./ God left no trace/ No nail no track./The thief was lying/ Low in His flat./ When he moved/ He moved fast./ Tuka says:/ Nobody was / Nowhere. None/ Was plundered/ And lost nothing. 

 And so some of his own Marathi poems of the Fifties and Sixties are written in the Bombay argot of the migrant working classes and the underworld part Hindi, part Marathi which the Hindi film industry would make proper use of only decades later. These poems he then often translated into an Americanese which, at the time, would have made respectable Americans blush, maderchod rendered, for instance, as motherfucker. Bombay, in the Sixties, gave him these languages and also the passages of transition between these worlds, the movement from street to library to cinema hall. 

 There was also, at this time, a musical transformation, a musical moment. Kolatkar had learnt Western musical notation. Hed also taken lessons in playing the pakhawaj, the venerable Indian drum that predates the tabla; in the early Seventies, he began to compose his peculiar and compelling versions of rock music. He recorded a demo of four songs with a group of local musicians in a studio in 1973; he was forty-one years old. Though nothing came of that experiment, it sounds now, more than ever, like groundbreaking, astonishing stuff. The first song, I am a poor man from a poor land, has an ananda-lahari one of the instruments played by Baul singers, mendicant devotees of Krishna, in Bengal in the background. The first line is something Kolatkar read on a piece of paper of the sort that the semi-educated beggar in India used to hand out to people, often stating his profession and including a message in English, perhaps to keep some of his dignity intact. In the foreground is Kolatkars scolding but very musical vocalizing; a spin-off on the beggars plea that becomes a demand to the consumer, the singer asking his listener to pay up for his damn good song. 

 The genre, here and in the other songs, is metropolitan and immediate and hybrid; inescapably but complicatedly Indian, without any of the sentimental assumptions of world music. Its a style that hasnt occurred before or since. As in Jejuri, the devotional is inserted forcefully into the economic, where it always resided anyway in India, into the bread-and-butter transaction, the duty and slightly disreputable compulsion to earn a living.

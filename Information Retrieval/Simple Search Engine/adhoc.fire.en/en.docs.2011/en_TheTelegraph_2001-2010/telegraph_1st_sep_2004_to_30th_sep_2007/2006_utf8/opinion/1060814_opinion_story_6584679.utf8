 ONE FOR THE SEA

 ABHIJIT BHATTACHARYYA

 The Indian navy is all set to induct the first US built ship, Trenton, in its inventory. Understandably, this gives rise to a few queries: What sort of ship is this? What would be its role in a navy consisting of French, German and Russian submarines, British and Russian aircraft carriers and British, Indian and Russian surface vessels? To understand the Indian navys new acquisitions deployment and role, it may be useful to look into its history with the US flotilla.

 USS Trenton (LPD-14) is one of eleven Austin class ships, which was authorized in 1965, laid down on August 8, 1966 and commissioned on March 6, 1971. Constructed by the Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company, it has been part of the Active Atlantic Fleet. Interestingly, the ship belongs to a class the ranking of which is 9 out of 11 in the order of importance and role in the US navy. Clearly, therefore, it will be a support-cum-logistics ship in the Indian army, rendering back-up service to the forward deployment fleet of offensive operations.

 Since Trenton is the biggest Indian defence deal with the US in recent times, it may be interesting to explore the actual role, operation and interfacing with the rest of the Indian sea force, which, till date, did not have a single US machine in its fleet.

 Strong warrior

 With a full load of about 16,900 displacement tons, 7,700 miles range at a maximum speed of 21 knots, a complement of 420 men (both sailors and officers), four guns (of different calibre), counter measures, electronic support measures, combat data systems and radars, Trentons strength lies in its extended capability to make its presence felt in out-of-area operations through its on-board helicopters. The curious fact of the matter, however, is whether our navy would like to go for these US-made helicopters or resort to the typical Indian propensity to go for the diverse weapon systems of Western, Russian and Indian make.

 Critics may question the wisdom of going for a ship manufactured in 1971. In the present scenario, however, the role of Trenton will perhaps be in a sea denial mode while acting solo, and as a part of the sea control armadas logistics and support ship in a fleet operation. 

 The purchase of Trenton obviously matches the long term maritime vision of both India and the US. As the regional power, Indias interest lies around the Indian Ocean and as the global power, the US navy needs to coordinate with the navies of the volatile regions of the oil route.

 A good deal?

 Still, the niggling doubt remains. Why does one purchase a ship from a country which till recently did not appear to be a reliable defence partner and was openly distrusted ? The answer lies in realpolitik and real hardware availability. What India required was not readily available in the market. Russia or the United Kingdom, France or Germany, Japan or Italy, none could have met the Indian requirement and none had any to spare. Only the US had the ship and could provide one from its Atlantic fleet.

 Trenton is bound to strengthen the amphibious force of the Indian navy. With a full load of 5,655 tons, a range of 3,000 miles at 15 knots, 4 guns, 2 multibarrel rocket launchers and one Sea King 42C helicopter on board, the induction of Trenton is likely to be a force multiplier for the Indian navys strategic goal of blue water capability.

 The only matter of future concern for Trenton, however, is the age ( it was commissioned 37 years ago) and the future of refit, modernization and spare parts. It is said that as long as the ship sails, it is fine; but once it fails, one loses its line. The sea rarely forgives failures.

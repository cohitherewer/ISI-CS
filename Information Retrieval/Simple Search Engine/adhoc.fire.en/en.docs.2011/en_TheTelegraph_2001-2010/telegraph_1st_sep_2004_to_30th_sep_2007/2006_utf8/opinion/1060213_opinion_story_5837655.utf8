The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FEAR OF FORCE

 One of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s more enduring creations is proving to be the phrase, ?oasis of peace?. He had used it once to describe the law and order situation in Calcutta, and it keeps coming back to haunt his career as a chief minister who is also in charge of the state?s police. The latest incident brings out, yet again, the unpleasantly ironic nature of that phrase. A couple from Bangalore was held up recently by a sergeant in uniform in the middle of the night on Chittaranjan Avenue. The policeman ostensibly wanted the couple?s cash, but it has been alleged by the couple that his actual intentions were grosser and were focussed on the woman, who was subsequently subjected to verbal and physical abuse. What makes this incident particularly unfortunate is the help this policeman got from his junior colleagues who were with him, and who actively assisted their senior?s misdemeanours. The follow-up to this incident from Lalbazar has also been shocking. In spite of having been informed immediately, nobody came to inquire about the incident, and only a departmental inquiry has been ordered following the sergeant?s suspension, which seems to be the only punishment that he is deemed to have deserved. A tendency towards leniency ? even something like a hush-up ? seems to suggest itself here.

 Such an orchestrated offence, involving more than one policeman, calls for a far more immediate and unsparing response because it points towards a systemic problem within the police force. Nor can it be dismissed as a stray incident. To close the distance between the police and ordinary citizens through ?friendly? policing has supposedly been the intention of the government for some time now. That distance is largely the result of mistrust and fear, and the effect of an incident like this would go a long way in endorsing it significantly. Mr Bhattacharjee?s vision of Calcutta as a tourist destination has also been widely publicized. An incident like this, happening to visitors from another city, should also alert the chief minister to the basic work that needs to be done in the city in order to make it a place worth visiting. With its law-keepers breaking the law so flagrantly, there is very little chance of Calcutta being perceived yet as either an alluring tourist destination or an ?oasis of peace?.

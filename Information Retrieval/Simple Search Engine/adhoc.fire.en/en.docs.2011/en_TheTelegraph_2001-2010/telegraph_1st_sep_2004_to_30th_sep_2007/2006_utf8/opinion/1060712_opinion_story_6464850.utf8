The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOST CASE

 It is one more example of politics holding a country?s economy to ransom. But the Tata group?s decision to practically drop its first-ever investment proposal in Bangladesh is not exactly a surprise. The signals from Dhaka in recent weeks were far from encouraging. The manner in which the Bangladesh government forced the Tatas to revise the $3 billion project several times exposed its indecision and lack of will. Clearly, some of the issues raised by Dhaka, such as the price of gas to be supplied to the proposed steel, power and fertilizer plants, were only ruses meant to delay the finalization of the projects. That this was indeed so has now been confirmed by Dhaka?s explanation for the delay. It has been officially admitted that the government of Ms Khaleda Zia dithered over the deal as it was uncertain of its possible impact on the ruling coalition?s chances in the next general elections. What has not been stated as clearly is that pressures from other quarters may have tied Ms Zia?s hands. Whatever the real reasons for the collapse of the deal, it is not going to improve Bangladesh?s image as an investment destination. 

 Yet, Bangladesh is in desperate need of an image makeover. During the tenure of the present government, the country?s image has been tarnished in many ways. A dismal law and order situation, an erosion of democratic values and, above all, the rise of Islamist militancy have worried the international community about the failure of the state in Bangladesh. The Tata group?s decision to set up a 2.4 million tonne steel plant, two power plants, a coal mine and a fertilizer plant was seen as a bold move that could go a long way in repairing the country?s image. It could inspire other investors to shake off fears and inhibitions about Bangladesh and follow in the Tatas? footsteps. The biggest losers, though, are the common people in Bangladesh. The Tatas? proposed investments would have been the biggest the country has had in many years. They could have done much to change the economy of a country that is among the poorest in the world. But then, politicians in Dhaka seldom see beyond the next polls.

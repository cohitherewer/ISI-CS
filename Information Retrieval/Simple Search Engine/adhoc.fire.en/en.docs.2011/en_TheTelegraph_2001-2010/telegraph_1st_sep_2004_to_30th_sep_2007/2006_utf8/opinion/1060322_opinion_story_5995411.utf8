 MORE AN ADVISOR THAN AN ENFORCER

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 The ultimate aim of prevention...is to create a ?culture of prevention?, in which compliance with agreed standards is regarded as...an indicator of efficiency as well as social responsibility. And beyond that a culture of prevention requires commitment to a programme of continual improvement, both the costs and benefits of which become increasingly clear not only to employers and workers but also to governments and the general public.

 ...The emphasis on prevention is expressed not simply in the relationship between the inspector and the individual enterprise. The key to all preventive joint working lies in the increasingly close relationship between labour inspectorates, sectoral employer bodies and trade unions, with...inputs from technical, scientific and medical experts, which result in the agreement of standards and programmes of implementation. Such agreements...increasingly reveal those enterprises which have not participated or accepted the agreements, who seek perhaps short-term profit by cutting corners and allows the labour inspectorate economically to concentrate its enforcement resources on compelling defiant enterprises or sectors of activity to comply.

 ...As industrial and commercial sectors and individual enterprises increasingly adopt ?preventive policies?, labour inspectorate becomes part of the process of facilitating change and ?building in? prevention, rather than engaging simply in its traditional inspection and enforcement activities. Greater emphasis is now placed on the development of labour protection policies at the workplace and prevention rather than cure....This makes the work of inspectors more difficult and complex because they must have a knowledge of the business operations of the enterprise, social relations within it and its structure and procedures....Under the preventive approach inspectorates acquire legitimacy through their competence, efficiency, technical power and person power.

 A preventive approach to labour inspection requires the inspector to be more an advisor than an enforcer....Inspectors deal more with top management, they advise management rather than do management?s job and they are better trained to have a good understanding of the management process and labour relations. Under a preventive approach to labour inspection, inspection services rely on their technical knowledge and...the persuasiveness of the individual, rather than on the power confirmed by their position....

 ....Clear strategies are necessary to establish priorities in those situations which are...most hazardous to minors: define clear objectives for intervention; elimination of the illegal employment of children; establishment of preventive measures to improve the working conditions of young persons who are legally employed; extend intervention to all types of workplaces, urban and rural, registered and unregistered, visible and invisible; adopt concrete measures, bearing in mind that the purpose of inspection is to ensure compliance with the law and not just to apply sanctions.

 ....Provided there is both a clear policy...and the political will for action, the central inspection authority can organize inspection programmes that either include child labour among other aspects...or are dedicated specifically to combatting child labour. Sometimes inspection plans are based on campaigns or... programmes aimed at problems which are already serious, or may be expected to become serious ...Priority might be given to...eliminating the worst forms of child labour prevalent in a given country.

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Dispersed and visible child labour: children working singularly or self-employed or apparently working singularly but in fact working for large enterprises, such as delivery boys, messengers and errand runners, self-employed children providing services or goods on the street...caf? workers... entertainers and dancers...circus performers, professional beggars, conductors and helpers on long distance transport such as trucks, buses, rail, cargo steamers or passenger boats, children who guard fields against birds, monkeys, thieves, herders and guardians of plough animals and those engaged in livestock care, milking and fodder gathering.

 Dispersed and invisible child labour: these are the children most unknown and hardest to reach in remote areas, isolated and powerless, and often...the most seriously exploited: domestic servants and children working in family based industries, such as craftwork, apprentices and attendants to skilled craftsmen...children who assist with subsistence hunting... fishing and agriculture, children of refugees or recent immigrants to the city who are engaged in traditional occupations, and thi- eves, pickpockets, smugg- lers and those involved in the drug industry or pornography.

 ...In its Constitution, the ILO requires all member States to set up a system of labour inspection. Two of its very first international instruments were the Lab- our Inspection Recommendations, 1919...and 1923.... These first international standards on labour inspection...already contain a set of basic principles...for mo- dern labour inspection systems. In 1947, the ILO Conference adopted an ambitious set of standards: the Labour Inspection, Industry and Commerce Convention...and three associated Recommendations....These new standards were comprehensive and farsighted. The principles they laid down over 50 years ago are still...relevant today, in fact ever more so, in the face of globalization, deregulation, downsizing of public services, etc. In many ILO member States, they form the basis of existing labour inspection legislation, often transposed verbatim into national texts.

 ...These instruments... set forth the principle that labour inspection is a public function...and that it is best organized as a system, within the larger context of a State system to administer social and labour policy and to supervise compliance with all national... standards that give effect to it. Therefore, labour inspectors should have the status and independence of public officials, and exercise their powers and functions in an impartial manner...free of undue pressures and constraints from outside. As representatives of the State...labour inspectors are empowered with considerable executive rights, but also bound by a set of duties....The proper exercise of these rights and duties is fundamental to the authority of inspectors and the inspection system as a whole.

 ....A second principle concerns the need for close cooperation between labo- ur inspection and employers and workers....It often begins with the collaboration in the formulation of labour protection legislation and the general policies regarding its application at the workplace, not- ably a comprehensive, coherent and consistent nat- ional ?enforcement? policy ....The effectiveness of lab- our inspection is directly linked to the interest that management takes in lab- our protection issues, and the resources it devotes to solving them....It is also linked to the presence and action of trade unions.... Hence the difficulty of ensuring labour protection in small enterprises, or when workers are not represented, or, more generally, in countries where the trade union movement is weak. The purpose of inspection is to see to it.

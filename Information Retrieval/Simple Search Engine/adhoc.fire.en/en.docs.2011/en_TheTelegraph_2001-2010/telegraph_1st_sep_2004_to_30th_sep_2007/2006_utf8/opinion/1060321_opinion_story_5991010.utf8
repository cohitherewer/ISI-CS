The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ON FORM ALONE

 The temporariness of a class player?s form cannot be made a justification for double standards. Sachin Tendulkar, a genius with the bat, has not crossed thirty in the last five test matches. His last century in a test match was at the end of last year when he notched up his 35th test hundred.This may be taken as evidence of a loss of form that is transient. It can also be interpreted as a decline in ability as a result of too much cricket. Tendulkar could very well be the proverbial burnt-out case. Whatever be the gloss put on the statistics, it cannot be denied that the time has come to pose the question that was beyond anyone?s imagination a few weeks ago: should Tendulkar be dropped because of his failure to perform innings after innings? Players with a similar record of non-performance have been dropped recently from the Indian team. It can be argued that Tendulkar has greater talent than Sourav Ganguly or V.V.S. Laxman and so should be kept in the squad despite repeated failures. But how much leeway or indulgence should Tendulkar be allowed because of his prodigious talent? The simple answer is none, since all players are equal in a cricket team. Moreover, the coach of the Indian team, Greg Chappell, has declared that he does not believe in prima donnas, and that performance is his only yardstick for selection.

 Chappell?s intentions with the Indian team have become clear over the last few months. He wants a younger and fitter team which represents India?s tomorrow. An ageing and out-of-form Tendulkar does not easily fit into such a scheme. It remains to be seen if Chappell passes the litmus test of consistency with the standards he has himself set by recommending that Tendulkar be dropped till he has recovered his form. This is not a comment on Tendulkar?s sheer class as a batsman but it is related to performance and to an even more important issue, building a team for the future. Chappell, as a coach, has already displayed unusual courage. He seems to have convinced his team that short-term reverses are to be ignored in the process of building a team. Despite this, the very idea of dropping Tendulkar might call for more courage than what Chappell bargained for when he took on the job. It is possible, of course, that Tendulkar might make the coach?s job easier by scoring a hundred in the next innings.

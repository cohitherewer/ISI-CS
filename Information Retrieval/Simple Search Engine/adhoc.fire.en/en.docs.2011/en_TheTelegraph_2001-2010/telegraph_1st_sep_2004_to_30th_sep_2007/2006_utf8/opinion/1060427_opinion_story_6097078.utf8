The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IT IS STILL AN UPHILL TASK

 Amitava Banerjee

 During the first phase of the assembly elections in Assam, a news clipping on television showed how two adults, both physically challenged, were denied their right to exercise their franchise ? the polling booth was located on top of a hill. The arrangement defied the Election Commission?s order which specifically said that polling booths must be made accessible to all, including those on wheelchairs. The experience of these two first-time voters is not unexpected in our democratic environs.

 In India, no political party looks beyond its vote bank or the gains that can be made from it. People are left wallowing in poverty, and casteism and communal disharmony are used as trump cards. The situation for the challenged is perhaps more hopeless. Legislation is enacted merely as a stop gap arrangement to quell the anger of this section. There is no political will to implement the laws. Neither is there an intention or commitment to bring to book the people who are responsible for the challenged being denied their legitimate rights. The right to vote is constitutionally guaranteed. Why was no one held responsible for robbing the two physically challenged of the right to exercise a fundamental right?

 Sense of violation

 The challenged people have earned their right to lead a normal life through their arduous struggle over decades. And yet, it is because of government inaction that these hard-earned rights are being denied them. Why has the government never thought of a time-bound implementation of any programme? The situation has come to such a pass that the sense of justice is being violated. The psychological assault on the challenged, who are obviously a fragile section of our society, is so cruel that it numbs the mind. 

 Take for example the sight of a young girl being carried on a wheel chair through flights of steps in an airport, the confusion that ensues when she is boarding the flight, and worse, when she is accused of not paying the unjustified claim of service charge for the use of the ambulift. 

 The method of oppression is subtle and yet intrusive and complete. This was clearly reflected on the faces of the two dejected voters ? one on a wheel chair and the other on a crutch. Like physical assault, shouldn?t this mental assault be considered a criminal offence as well?

 More support

 People either react violently to such mental torture or withdraw into a shell. The challenged often opt for the last. And it is this psychology that is further exploited by the government and the authorities. Being repeatedly thwarted, the challenged people learn to give up hope and curtail their expectations from society. The human rights discourse here is anyway fragile.

 A visitor to India on a business tour recently noticed that no ATM kiosk of any bank, including the foreign banks, had any auditory attachment for the benefit of the visually challenged. This is mandatory in the West. Banks, especially the foreign ones, could have been easily instructed to follow the norms in India as well. But the government obviously do not think that is necessary. 

 Non-governmental organizations, which till the last decade were seen to be dedicated to the cause of the challenged, are now seen to spend more time gathering foreign funds than working in their chosen fields. Seminars for public awareness and other programmes are held in five-star hotels or clubs in the presence of celebrities who are hardly interested in the issue. 

 It is time we asked ourselves if we really want to bring the challenged into the mainstream. If we do, shouldn?t we provide them the technological and mental support which are their due?

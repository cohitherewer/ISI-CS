 Paperback Pickings

 City of laughter and tears

 Lahore: A sentimental journey 

 (Penguin, Rs 250) by Pran Nevile talks about 

 a journey that dates back to the Lahore of the Thirties 

 and the Forties, a city ?bustling with activity where people 

 coexisted harmoniously, unfettered by considerations of 

 religion, region or caste.? Nevile writes with a sense of 

 deep longing, bringing to life the myriad shades of life 

 spent in this ancient city ? gay festivities, kite-flying, 

 romance on rooftops, and evenings spent with the dancing 

 girls of Hira Mandi. But then, Lahore was not only about 

 pomp and gaiety. It also had its share of pain and violence 

 ? the bitter experience of Partition left an indelible mark 

 on most of its residents. Evocative and informative, the 

 book is at once a sociological and a historical account 

 of a city with a chequered past. 

 Swami Vivekananda: The living vedanta (Penguin, Rs 375) by Chaturvedi Badrinath includes sentences that are as mysterious as profound. Sample this: ?The truth is that providence had ensured for Swami Vivekananda a deathless life by making him ?so tender? as he complained.? Badrinath seeks to liberate Vivekananda from the mystical aura that surrounded him. But with sentences like these, it is likely that Chaturvedi has made Swamiji even more mysterious.

 Leaves of Blood (Wordhouse, 

 Rs 200) by Samares Mazumdar is a story that weaves 

 in elements of displacement, exploitation and tragedy. Set 

 in the days of the raj, it recounts the ?real life 

 experiences? of poor men and women working in a tea plantation. 

 While the men were made to toil like slaves, the women were 

 preyed upon by their lecherous masters. There is a lot of 

 sex, but the sex, like the translation, leaves a lot to 

 be desired.

 It?s called a breakup because 

 it?s broken (Harper Element, Rs 195) by Greg 

 Behrendt amp; Amiira Ruotola-Behrendt is ostensibly 

 ?the ultimate survival guide to getting over Mr Wrong? and 

 ?reclaiming your inner Superfox?, whatever that means. Some 

 of the tips offered by the duo are quite ingenious ? reorganizing 

 closets; refolding every piece of clothing; training pets 

 to become ?therapy dogs? and so on. Greg, who has co-authored 

 the book, is a comedian. But his tips to nurse broken hearts 

 are not even remotely funny.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 POINTLESS FEARS

 It is not surprising that apprehensions about the United States of America continue to inform sections of public opinion in India, even while bilateral relations are getting better. While it is important to address genuine domestic concerns, it is essential that the Manmohan Singh government not let a small but shrill group impact on its ties with Washington. Consider the landmark Indo-US agreement on nuclear issues, which is on the verge of being sealed. After the support received in the American House of Representatives, only the Senate endorsement and a presidential approval remain. By most accounts, the deal will benefit India in a number of tangible ways. More important, it signals recognition of India as a major player in the international system by the world?s only superpower. And yet there are voices, within parliament and outside it, convinced that the agreement is intended to contain and roll back India?s nuclear programme. 

 These concerns have little merit and must be ignored, but they reflect a larger contradiction. A section of India?s strategic elite continues to have a paradoxical view of the US, with suspicions of American policies towards south Asia. Notice the public outcry about the possibility of a CIA mole within the prime minister?s office, after the revelation made by Mr Jaswant Singh in his book. Some of this tension is a legacy of the Cold War, but this sentiment is kept alive by the US?s relationship with Pakistan and ? more generally ? by Washington?s perceived behaviour in international politics. Resentment at the way in which Pakistan seems to continue to be rewarded by the US despite its support for terrorism within India is palpable, as is the perception that the US has double standards in dealing with terrorism. 

 Similarly, there is a widespread feeling that Washington is not sufficiently sensitive to Indian security concerns or its aspirations of being a great power. The Indian elite is uncomfortable with the US?s hyper-power, a term popularized by the French, and which has gained intellectual currency within India. Similarly, the sparring between Indian and American negotiators in trade-related forums over the pace of liberalization in agriculture and services reinforces scepticism about the US. But, despite these apprehensions, it is essential to continue to build a strong, pragmatic partnership with the US. There is a long-term strategic convergence between the two countries. Economic and technological ties, educational and societal links, shared concern over China?s future, and the common battle against terrorism are key factors that bind the US and India together. The Manmohan Singh government would be well advised to view its ties with the US only through the prism of national interest. Na?ve scepticism or ideological posturing by the opposition or allies must be responded to, but not taken seriously.

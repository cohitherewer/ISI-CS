 What the rebels think today

 The Battle for Bastar

 United we stand 

 Part I: Revolutionaries

 In the early years of the 20th 

 century, Gopal Krishna Gokhale remarked that ?what Bengal 

 thinks today, India thinks tomorrow?. The claim soon turned 

 hollow as, in quick succession, the capital of British India 

 shifted to New Delhi; Mahatma Gandhi assumed control of 

 the national movement; and Bombay supplanted Calcutta as 

 the financial hub of modern India. In later decades, Bengal 

 and Bengalis collected a long series of laments as, in political 

 and economic terms, they fell further behind other parts 

 of the country.

 In the first years of the 21st 

 century, however, Gokhale?s prophecy seems to be coming 

 true, not in whole, but in good measure. I have in mind 

 the growing influence of armed Maoist revolutionaries. According 

 to the latest report of the ministry of home affairs, the 

 Communist Party of India (Maoist) is active in more than 

 one hundred districts. At least fifty-five are reckoned 

 to be ?seriously affected? by revolutionary violence. In 

 the considered view of the prime minister, this constitutes 

 the gravest internal security threat to the nation, surpassing 

 in its gravity the insurgencies in the North-east and in 

 Kashmir.

 The Maoist movement gathered force 

 after the merger, in 2004, of the Andhra-based Peoples War 

 Group and the Bihar-based Maoist Coordination Committee. 

 The name that this united force bestowed upon itself ? the 

 Communist Party of India (Maoist) ? was at once grand and 

 clever. Clever, because the abbreviated form mimicked that 

 of the most important left party in India. We are the real 

 inheritors of the legacy of revolutionary Marxism, the new 

 party was saying, whereas the fellows in Kerala and West 

 Bengal are merely a bunch of bourgeois reformists. Grand, 

 because by calling itself a party rather than a mere ?group? 

 or ?committee?, it could escape the stigma associated with 

 that dreaded word: ?Naxalites?.

 Which is where Bengal comes in. 

 For it was in the village of Naxalbari, in deepest north 

 Bengal, not far from India?s borders with Nepal, China and 

 (what was then) East Pakistan, that the movement first began 

 in the form of a popular peasant uprising against the state 

 government. Its leadership was assumed by the renegade cadre 

 of the original CPI(M), who disapproved of their party?s 

 first attempt ? this was 1967 ? to try and change the system 

 by working within and according to the Constitution of India. 

 A three-cornered battle ensued, between the Communist Party 

 of India (Marxist), the Naxalites, and the state. There 

 was much loss of life, and it took the better part of a 

 decade before peace returned to West Bengal.

 That story is well known to readers 

 of this newspaper. What is less well understood, perhaps, 

 is the subsequent spread of the Naxalite movement to other 

 parts of India. An early emulator was Andhra Pradesh, where 

 leading figures likewise left the CPI(M) to work among poor 

 peasants and tribal communities. In time, they were to form 

 the PWG, which has maintained a persistent presence in the 

 upland districts of the state. Meanwhile, armed conflict 

 broke out between upper and lower castes in Bihar, the former 

 represented by private armies, the latter by the cadre of 

 the MCC.

 Moving northwards from Andhra, 

 and westwards from Bihar, the PWG and the MCC steadily expanded 

 their influence across the heartland of India. They found 

 most support among the tribals, a group alternately condescended 

 to and treated with contempt by politicians and administrators. 

 Worse off than even the Dalits, and without effective leadership 

 of their own, many adivasis saw in the Naxalites 

 an agency somewhat more welcoming (or at any rate less oppressive) 

 than the state.

 In the last week of May, this 

 writer travelled with a group of colleagues through the 

 district of Dantewada, of whose 11 taluks the Maoists 

 control as many as five. Dantewada used to be part of the 

 princely state of Bastar, the name by which the region is 

 still generally known. Its hilly and wooded terrain is now 

 home to a brutal civil war played out away from the national 

 gaze and mostly unreported by the national press. It is, 

 however, a conflict of the gravest importance to the future 

 of India. For it is in this region that the Maoists have 

 dug their deepest roots. Parts of Bastar are under their 

 complete sway, safe havens from where they can make deadly 

 forays into areas controlled by the Chhattisgarh administration.

 Bastar forms part of a contiguous 

 forest belt that spills over from Chhattisgarh into Andhra 

 Pradesh and Maharashtra. This was the mythical region of 

 ?Dandakaranya?, a name the Maoists have integrated into 

 their lexicon. They have a special zonal committee for Dandakaranya, 

 under which operate several divisional committees. These, 

 in turn, have range committees reporting to them. The lowest 

 level of organization is at the village, where committees 

 are formed known as sangams. 

 We got a sharp insight into the 

 Maoist mind in an extended interview with one of their senior 

 leaders. He met our team, by arrangement, in a small wayside 

 dhaba along the road that runs from the state capital, 

 Raipur, to Jagdalpur, once the seat of the Maharaja of Bastar. 

 There he told us of his party?s strategies for Dantewada, 

 and for the country as a whole.

 Working under the pseudonym of 

 ?Sanjeev?, this revolutionary was slim and clean-shaven, 

 and soberly dressed, in dark trousers and a bush-shirt of 

 neutral colours. Now thirty-five, he has been in the movement 

 for two decades, dropping out of college in Hyderabad to 

 join it. (The profile was typical ? the leading Maoists 

 in Chhattisgarh are all Telugu speakers from Andhra.) He 

 now works in Abujmarh, an area so isolated that it remains 

 unsurveyed (apparently the only part of India which holds 

 this distinction), and where no official dare venture for 

 fear of being killed.

 Speaking in quiet, controlled 

 tones, Sanjeev soon showed himself to be both deeply committed 

 as well as highly sophisticated. Their sangams, he said, 

 worked to protect people?s rights in jal, jangal 

 zameen ? water, forest and land. At the same time, 

 they made targeted attacks on state officials, especially 

 the police. Raids on police stations were intended to stop 

 them from harassing ordinary folk. They were also necessary 

 to augment the weaponry of the guerrilla army. Through popular 

 mobilization and the intimidation of state officials, the 

 Maoists hoped to expand their authority over Dandakaranya. 

 Once the region was made a ?liberated zone?, it would be 

 used as a launching pad for the capture of state power in 

 India as a whole.

 Sanjeev?s belief in the efficacy 

 of armed struggle was complete. When asked about two land 

 mine blasts which had killed many innocent people ? in one 

 case members of a marriage party ? he said that these had 

 been mistakes, with the guerrillas believing that the police 

 had hired private vehicles to escape detention. The Maoists, 

 he said, would issue an apology and compensate the victims? 

 families. However, on other (and scarcely less brutal) killings, 

 he said these were ?deliberate incidents?; that is, intended 

 as such.

 We spoke to Sanjeev for close 

 to two hours. All the while his eyes continually scanned 

 the entrance to the tea-shop, taking in those who came in 

 and went out. It was dark by the time we recommenced our 

 journey to Jagdalpur, to proceed from there to Dantewada, 

 and study by what means this threat to the Republic of India 

 was being met. The agenda and actions of the Maoists have 

 been presented in this article; the next article will analyse 

 the major challenges to them.

 This is the first part

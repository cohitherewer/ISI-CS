 KAJAL SENGUPTA (1931-2006)

 Sometime in the late Sixties, during the Naxalite movement, Kajal Sengupta entered Presidency College to see a boy being beaten up by others while everyone stood watching. She seized the leader and ?pulled him off?. But a ?gate meeting? was held immediately and KSG, as she was figured on the class schedules, was threatened with ?dire consequences?. A little worried, she related this to her husband that evening. He said that as long as they referred to her as ?Kajaldi? at their gate meetings, she had nothing to worry about.

 He summed up, with humorous percipience, the essence of Kajaldi?s dynamic presence and the immutable quality of students? perceptions of her. In the varied memories of the students who passed through her classes for thirty-seven years, many of whom kept coming back to her affectionate welcome later, she was always uniquely Kajaldi. The first woman teacher in Presidency College, she joined its English department in February, 1959, and was at once faced with the peculiar innocence towards the female species characteristic of old-fashioned male bastions, presided over by legendary teachers. Although the college had become coeducational by then, it was puzzling to have a member of the staff unable to use the men?s ?cloak-room?, and she was asked kindly by the principal if a mirror above her desk would do. Kajaldi used the bathroom in the girls? common room for years until, through the patient and incremental changes she wrought, a ladies? bathroom for teachers was made. She was also asked to dress ?conservatively?, and the long blouse and white sari became Kajaldi?s unchanging apparel in college till her retirement.

 Undaunted spirit

 That she took all this in her stride with her undaunted spirit and humour seems all the more remarkable because she had been a student in Loreto House and Loreto College, at that time a world culturally far removed from Presidency. After her MA examinations from Calcutta University, she went to Oxford on a state scholarship. Upon her return in 1958, her first posting was in Presidency College, where she remained till her retirement in 1996, fighting unceasingly for the maintenance of excellence in an institution that she felt was endangered by the mechanical rules of the state government?s education system.

 No text, if Kajaldi taught it, either in college or at the Calcutta University where she also took classes, could be boring. Her earliest students recall with wonder how absorbing she made philology, given to her then as she was the youngest teacher in the department. She inspired an enthusiasm for texts and a desire to explore them, and discouraged shortcuts to excellence. She demanded respect for academic work; in this matter she was genuinely strict. But she never expected that youngsters would fall in line easily. She enjoyed their mischief, and would even chase, with determined agility, a truant student across the college green for a tutorial, if she thought he had promise. And never fail to retell the story affectionately to the sheepish adult when sharing Latin classes with him years later in the Eighties.

 In an age short on role models, Kajaldi was central to her women students, for whom she represented personal and professional loyalty, dedication to excellence and an undefeated independence of spirit. Her pride in her students? achievements and the new things that they did was integral to her personality. Kajaldi?s swiftly-moving figure in the corridors and her head poised over the steering wheel of the Standard 10 she drove into college are images inextricable from Presidency memories. Her withdrawal from all contact towards the end of her life pained her students and friends, but she was as determined about it as everything else she did. But as she said in her reminiscences, paraphrasing Eliot, ?it is not only the pastness of the past that matters; time present and time past both live in time future?.

 WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM NATURE

 The steep price of natural gas should make Indian companies look at solar and wind power to meet energy needs, writes Satrujit Banerjee

 New alternative

 At first glance, the Indo- US nuclear treaty, a slightly modified version of which was ratified by the US Senate and the Congress, appears to be beneficial to India.

 Under the treaty, India will be able to build more nuclear plants, with the United States of America supplying the fuel, have access to American technology for both civilian and military purposes (something that was denied to India since the imposition of US sanctions in 1974), subject only the civilian reactors to international supervision and not sign the non proliferation treaty. (That the government of India was ill-advised on the NPT issue and should have signed it is another matter.)

 This piece of news is understandably making headlines, but to consider this treaty as the solution to all our power needs is short-sightedness at its worst. To begin with, what if the coordinates of cooperation between the US and India change ten or thirty years hence, and the fuel is denied again? Also, more and bigger nuclear power plants mean disposing of more nuclear wastes, that can always be hazardous. Lastly, as a thumb rule, it takes at least a decade for power to reach the consumer from a plant which is to be newly constructed. Indeed, if the need of the hour is indigenous, clean, non-polluting, renewable energy, help is at hand if we turn to the wind and the sun.

 Among the policy-makers in India, wind power is seen to be an area of concern for environmentalists who are more interested in clean energy than in saving money. But wind power is fast emerging as a credible alternative wherever there is a demand for new energy sources at competitive prices. The policy of continued and increased usage of wind power must be actively pursued to serve expanding energy needs, without relying too much on coal, the fastest-growth fossil fuel and also the most polluting. To gauge how fast the producers of wind power in India are growing, one needs to look at Pune-based Suzlon Energy Ltd. The company was not listed in the top ten wind-turbine manufacturers in the world as recently as 2002. However, earlier this year, it surpassed Siemens of Germany to become the fifth largest producer by installed megawatts of capacity. Earlier this month, MSPL Ltd, a Mumbai-based company, inaugurated a 125-megawatts wind power project in Karnataka. While a minuscule power project is no earth-shattering news, the facts that the company is already registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and will reap considerable monetary benefits as a result of this, make it worth looking into. According to the Kyoto protocol, developed countries that are unable to curtail their greenhouse emissions have to purchase certified emission reductions through the clean development mechanism route. MSPLs green project activity is set to replace conventional energy. Therefore, its registration with UNFCCC will enable the company to generate CERs valued roughly at Rs 200 -250 crore over a ten-year period. The company is planning to ramp up its capacity to 300 megawatts at a cost of 750 crore by 2008.

 Wind-turbine manufacturers estimate they will remain competitive in the international market as long as the price of crude oil remains above $40 per barrel. With natural gas prices climbing as well, it is inevitable that other Indian companies would look into the field of wind power as well. And the latest entrant is the Essar Group of Mumbai, which is working on plans to set up a wind farm near Chennai. Experts feel that in Indias case, a little nudge from the government, by way of reduction of import duty or tax on capital equipment, will witness a string of windmills dotting the countryside. That more needs to be done in this field in India is borne out by the fact that four-fifths of the orders in Suzlons book come from abroad.

 That clean, non- polluting, renewable energy will be prominent in the shape of things to come is already evident. California, a trend setter in such matters, has banned the setting up of any power plant with harmful emissions, even though the state is reeling under an acute power shortage. In the last couple of years, a significant number of industries have relocated elsewhere, but the state has stuck to its guns. Forced to innovate, entrepreneurs have responded, and solar power is now playing a major role in augmenting the power supply. One immutable economic fact in the solar power equation is that for the end user, the upfront costs are simply too steep to justify the ultimate payoff. To overcome this, a solar developer called Developing Energy Efficient Roof Systems has introduced a business model in which it buys the equipment with money it raises from private financiers. Any company wishing to enter into a long-term contract for the supply of solar electricity has only to provide the roof. The parts warehouse of General Motors in Cucamonga, California, opted for it and ever since, its roof has been host to a photovoltaic array with the ability to generate as much as 1.5 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year.

 The installation, which will supply half of the buildings electricity, will cost the company nothing. The electricity rate charged in such cases depends on who accumulates the carbon credit, the customer or Deers. As it stands now, when Deers keeps the carbon credits, electricity charge to their customer is marginally lower than the prevailing market rate charged by traditional power companies. This should prove to be a harbinger of things to come. In case this business model is summarily dismissed as being unsuitable for India, because of the high electricity rates charged by public utilities in the US, it should be pointed out that commercial electricity charges are higher in India than in America. In real terms, the rate charged per unit of electricity used commercially in the US when converted to rupees is lower than the median commercial electricity charge in India.

 With the sun mercilessly beating down on the north, west and middle India for nine months of the year, all we need is a bit of innovative incentive, in addition to the carbon credits which will be accumulating, to augment the grossly inadequate power supply to these areas. Also, in this model, electricity would be available even after the sun sets, as power is stored in rechargeable batteries for distribution later in the evening.

 A peep into the future may already have been provided by the city of Boulder in Colorado. It is about to impose a carbon tax on the customer, based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity used by a household. With the aid of the wind and the sun, we in India will do well to get a headstart.

 SLOW TRAIN COMING ROUND THE BEND

 The Metro Rail in Calcutta might soon become a spent force unless steps are taken to change the way it functions, writes Sumit Mitra

 In 1984, when the Calcutta Metro was inaugurated, it was the first city in India and 85th in the world to give itself a rapid mass transport system. It took another 11 years for the 16.45 kilometre Dum Dum-to-Tollygunge corridor to take shape, and it may take another couple of years for the north-south line to stretch 8.45 km further to Garia. But the Metro is not quite the backbone of Calcutta?s public transportation, and its first mover advantage is decidedly lost to Delhi where, even with the completion of the 62.16 km first phase, the ?Metro effect? is felt in the spiralling of property prices along the lines.

 Take the Dwarka sub-city, written off by property developers for its distance from downtown Delhi. Prices began moving up when the Delhi Development Authority, the agency that ?developed? Dwarka, paid Rs 600 crore to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation to finance the extension of its lines to Dwarka. Land and house prices have witnessed a three-fold rise in Dwarka since 2003.

 And now, in expectation of the 51.7 km Phase-ll to be completed before the Commonwealth Games in 2010, and to extend to Noida and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh and Gurgaon in Haryana, a boom is visible all along the way. By 2021, when DMRC plans to fully unroll its extension plans in four phases, the Metro in the capital, with its 244.86 km spread, may still fall short of the massive 400 km of the London Underground. But it won?t be a minnow either, considering that the English capital began running steam locomotives under its roads for only three miles as far back as 1863, and the network is still growing.

 ?Metro everywhere? is the fulcrum of urban public transport, not a supplementary means of travel. Be it in London, Paris, Shanghai or increasingly in Delhi, once you?ve touched your ticket to the card-reader at the gate (in Delhi you need to just bring it close), you?ve entered an insulated system that takes you within walking distance of your destination. This could be across the river or in a far-off corner of the metropolis.

 This is the way it should be; for Calcutta, unfortunately, this is not the way it is. Nor does it promise to be in the foreseeable future. In 2004, the West Bengal government engaged DMRC to prepare a project report for an east-west line. This was proposed to extend 18.65 km from New Dasnagar to Salt Lake Sector V. It would touch Howrah Station, crossing the Hooghly, running across BBD Bag, intersecting the existing Metro at the Central station, surfacing at Sealdah and run along an elevated track to partially girdle the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and then roll into Salt Lake. 

 The project is a trigger for fundamental change, not only in urban transport scenario but also for a socio-economic transition. Integrated to the existing Metro, the east-west lines can shorten by half, if not more, the commuting time from the suburbs of Howrah and Hooghly. They can give a much-needed push to property prices on the river?s underdeveloped west bank, and the shanty town in the stretch between A.J.C. Bose Road and the EM bypass.

 For renewal of rust belts and urban slums, rising land value is a more potent instrument than the bulldozer. It gives the occupier the incentive to sell and get out. The price push translates itself into good compensation packages. There is no incentive to take recourse to litigation or the local mafia.

 This phenomenon was best seen when the Jubilee Line of the London Underground moved towards East End, creating spanking office buildings in Canary Wharf and inviting a generation of new and more demanding settlers to a locality regarded as down at heel (further up, Brick Lane, of course, remains the little Sylhet that it became, much before Monica Ali penned her novel). Even in Mumbai, the east-west suburban metro corridor project, inaugurated recently, has the potential to turn Dharavi, reputedly the world?s largest slum, into an upscale destination.

 The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was obviously impressed by the DMRC-designed project plan. He announced in 2004 that the government would approach the Japan Bank of International Cooperation for funds. Nothing much has happened since then, and expectedly so. The DMRC estimated the cost at Rs 4,000 crore in 2004. An investment of such a proportion is not possible without a credible institution in place. And Central participation in the project is a must because the lender will want a sovereign guarantee.

 The DMRC is a possible model in this regard. It is a Centre-state institution, with the Union government represented not by the Indian Railways but by the urban development ministry. It has been essential to de-politicize the institution with unequivocal allegiance to principles of corporate governance, and putting a respected technocrat like Elattuvalapil Sreedharan at the helm. Sreedharan, who served the Calcutta Metro in the Seventies, is now a legend among metro-makers worldwide. He has built one of the only five Metros among 135 that make an operating profit. The four others are Singapore, Hong Kong, Taipei and one of the lines in Tokyo.

 Moreover, for an integrated Metro system, a single authority is a sine qua non. Under the Indian Railways, the Calcutta Metro is crippled by an uneconomic fare structure. It charges Rs 4 for a single ride from Shyambazar to Chandni Chowk when a bus ride costs Rs 5.

 The Calcutta Metro?s customer service is just a shade better, if at all, than the Indian Railways. The frequency of trains is a long eight minutes, which goes up to 15 minutes in the morning. The last Metro leaves as early as 9:45 pm, and there is no train till afternoon on Sundays. Most stations don?t have escalators; there is no lift for the old and the infirm.

 Bereft of a modern Automatic Train Protection, its safety is suspect. It is unable to restrain potential suicides ? the number of casualties having reached close to a hundred. Besides, burdened with a 12-fold cost overrun, and overstaffed beyond capacity (147 employees per km against 43 per km in Delhi), it is destined to remain an ineffective showpiece. To bring it under a single authority, the railways ministry must cooperate by first corporatizing the Calcutta Metro.

 The fare structure in an integrated Metro shall be quantitatively different from the present one. Delhiites are paying Rs 6 for the shortest journey but Rs 21 for the longest and Rs 50 for a day?s travel. Cost must match return, and price must match benefit.

 The project report by DMRC calculates an internal rate of return of 13.43 per cent on the Rs 4,000-crore investment. It certainly cannot be fulfilled with a fare structure similar to what is prevalent. But it must bring in multiple benefits. In London, a ? 22.5 weekly ticket gives you not only a week?s right to use the zones 1 and 2 (over ? 40 for all the zones) of the Underground but free bus trips throughout the city and discounted ferry trips. The DMRC is tying up with feeder services and may soon issue similar bundled tickets.

 In Calcutta, the tramways, if realigned as feeder to the Metro, can make public transport a pleasure. But that needs further investment on elevated tracks and more modern cars. In Vienna, trams complement the Metro, also with bundled daily or monthly tickets. It is an example Calcutta may emulate. You could board a tram near your home on, say, Sarat Bose Road, change to the Metro at Rabindra Sarobar station, hop on to the east-west line to reach Howrah station and catch the Rajdhani Express to Delhi. 

 But it will be a patchwork remedy to run a ?corporate? Metro from Howrah to Salt Lake and a sarkari Metro across it, and a tram service, which is run by no government but a gaggle of unionized men in khaki uniforms. ?One nation, two systems? can work for Hong Kong and China. ?One metro, two systems? cannot work for Calcutta.

 The chief minister has no doubt put in admirable efforts to change the perception of Bengal being the best places for man and capital to exist. But for a lasting impression of a state, the quality of life in its main city counts. In the next 10 years, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and even Kochi will spend around Rs 32,000 crore to lay Metro lines in the hope that this investment would drive an urban upgrade. It will change the hick-town look of the outlying suburbs, decongest the central business districts, clean up the inner city, and, what is more important from a social perspective, give the urban poor the much needed monetary incentive to relocate. Calcutta should not miss the last Metro.

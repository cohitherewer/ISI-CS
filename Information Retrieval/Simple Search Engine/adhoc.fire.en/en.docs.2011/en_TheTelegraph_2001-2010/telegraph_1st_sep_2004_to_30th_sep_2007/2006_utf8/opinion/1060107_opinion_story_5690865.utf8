 THE MAN

 FROM

 LUCKNOW

 Rajnath Singh, the newly appointed BJP president, represents all that the partys young lieutenants have long buried 

 You can take a man out of Uttar Pradesh, but you cant take Uttar Pradesh out of him. Which is why Rajnath Singh made a minor geographical gaffe at a press conference in Mumbai last week. Asked a question, the new president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) replied that hed speak with the media later ? but in Lucknow. 

 The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh meant to say Delhi, for thats where the leader of the party sits. But, clearly, despite several stints in the Capital ? he was the agriculture minister in the erstwhile National Democratic Alliance government ? Singhs heart lies in his home state. And nobody in the BJP is complaining. 

 For the BJP, Singhs identity is his state, once a stronghold of the party. The party no longer rules Uttar Pradesh and UP no longer forms the core of the party. A UP-ite leading the party, ergo, could revive the partys fortunes in the state, the high command argues. There is a growing belief in the party that it needs a man from Uttar Pradesh to win back seats in the state, says a party watcher. 

 So at the partys national executive meeting in Mumbai over the year end, the farmers son from Uttar Pradesh was named the president of the party. The first among equals ? among the ones he bested were BJP second-rung leaders Arun Jaitley, Pramod Mahajan and Sushma Swaraj ? is a favourite of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which worked overtime to oust Lal Krishna Advani last year, soon after the then president commended the thoughts of Pakistan founder M.A. Jinnah. 

 Singhs elevation came after a frantic tussle for power. The young leaders of the party were all eyeing the top spot, but Advani had hoped that the post would go to his loyalist, M. Venkaiah Naidu. The RSS, however, had its own plans. Appointing Naidu to the post, the RSS believed, would be giving Advani space and scope for some backseat driving. And thats why Rajnath Singhs elevation marks a victory for the RSS and a defeat for Advani, says a source close to the former president. 

 For the RSS, Rajnath Singh is just the man for the job. For unlike Advani, Singh has no grand plans for the party. He does not, much to the glee of the RSS, seek to give it a new direction. Party insiders say that all he hopes to do is win more seats. 

 It is not a tall order, for Singh has been successful in earlier ventures. As general secretary, he was given some of the credit for electoral victories in Chhatisgarh in December 2003, and in Jharkhand in February last year. The RSS also sees Singh as a good administrator. And most importantly ? with the BJP and the RSS still embarrassed about a recent sting operation that showed its MPs holding out their palms for some greasing ? Rajnath Singh is widely seen as an honest man. 

 He has a good image ? chavi achchhi hai, says a BJP vice-president in Lucknow. Not surprisingly, our workers are quite enthused about Rajnath Singh taking up the post of the party president. There is a sense of expectation, he says. 

 Clearly, 54-year-old Rajnath Singh belongs to the old RSS school of BJP leaders. One of the few dhoti-clad men among the second-rung leaders, Singh represents all that the young lieutenants have long buried. 

 He is not a techno savvy, smooth-talking Pramod Mahajan, nor is he an articulate and urbane Arun Jaitley. And ? many believe that this is the trait that has worked the best for the new president ? nor is he Advani-branded, like M. Venkaiah Naidu. 

 He has another trait that the RSS is banking on. Singh is a Thakur in a state where the Thakur vote is not inconsiderable. The emergence of Amar Singh ? another Thakur ? as a key player in Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party has drawn Thakurs away from the BJP. And insiders hold that efforts are now on to bring the Thakur back into the BJP fold. 

 Thanks to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, we already have the Brahmins with us, says the vice-president. Rajnath Singhs leadership will get us the Thakurs, he says. 

 Singh ? whose claim to fame during his tenure as chief minister five years ago was an act against copying in examinations ? is, however, not going to find the going easy. There are factions in the state unit of the party that have never been greatly enamoured of him, and there are leaders in New Delhi who cant wait for his term to end. For instance, Jaitley and Swaraj ? who were, at some point of time, loyal lieutenants of Advani ? are no great friends of Rajnath Singh. And neither is the UP Lodh leader, Kalyan Singh. 

 For Singh, life will be a tightrope walk. Meanwhile, the new president will continue to add more chapters to his own Tale of Two Cities ? shuttling between Lucknow and Delhi. And while he does that, he will, as is his wont, continue to feed people in his Ashok Road Bungalow in Lutyenss Delhi. Singh has a reputation for treating his guests to sundry edibles which are brought in on numerous trays to be passed around during conversations. Many of the food items come with a one-line recommendation from the man of the house himself ? Yeh try kijiye, Lucknow ka hai. 

 Which is just what they are saying about the man himself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THINK AGAIN

 Sexual justice continues to elude Indian homosexuals. But the Supreme Court has now asked the Delhi high court to re-examine the constitutional validity of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in light of the changed social scenario in India. For those who believe that respect for, and protection of, fundamental human rights ought to be at the core of a modern democracy, this would be, perhaps, a cautiously optimistic moment. Section 377 ? criminalizing sexual intercourse ?against the order of nature? ? is used most often to exploit and abuse homosexuals in India. The petition to read down this section to exclude from its ambit sexual acts between consenting adults in private was filed in 2001 by an organization working on the prevention of HIV/AIDS. The National Democratic Alliance filed a reply to this petition saying that the ?floodgates of delinquency? would be opened if homosexuality were legalized in India; the nation?s unreadiness for such a thing was reason enough for the law to remain unchanged. The Delhi high court then dismissed the petition on technical grounds, and the United Progressive Alliance, while toning down the bigotry, had chickened out of any clear position for or against homosexuality. A special leave petition was filed again in the Supreme Court against the high court?s decision, and the apex court?s latest move is in response to this petition.

 The reason for hope lies in the fact that the additional solicitor-general, appearing for the Union of India, has told the court that the petition ?merits admission?; the matter cannot be dismissed outright without proper examination. And most significantly, the ASG also added that he did not think that the ?reasoning? behind the previous dismissal was ?sustainable?. If this is some sort of a turnaround, then this is not because the government is saying that homosexuality needs to be decriminalized, but because it wants Section 377 to be looked at again instead of meeting with a knee-jerk dismissal. The UPA, meanwhile, might wish to consider the fact that criminalizing homosexuality puts India in the company of such ?progressive democracies? as Angola, Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Iran, Libya, Chechnya, Somalia, Sudan, Swaziland, Togo, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

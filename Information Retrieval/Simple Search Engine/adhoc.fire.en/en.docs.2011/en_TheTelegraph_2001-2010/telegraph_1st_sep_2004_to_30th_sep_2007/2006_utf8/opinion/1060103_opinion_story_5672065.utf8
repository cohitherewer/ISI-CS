 Letters to Editor

 More risk, less gain

 Sir ? There was, and quite justifiably, a lot of hue and cry over the rape and murder of a Bangalore call centre employee (?BPO murder rings Calcutta alarm?, Dec 17). Citizens? groups and BPOs discussed at length the measures to ensure the security of women employees. But there was no bandh or any demand for the resignation of the chief minister. City life continued undisrupted. Perhaps this explains why Bangalore is now decades ahead of Calcutta. Even with poor infrastructure, electricity and water supply, and the emerging right-wing activism on the Shiv Sena model, Bangalore is being flooded with fresh investments, so much so that many of them have to be diverted to other cities in Karnataka. Talk of unionization of BPO workers, a la Bengal, following the incident, is alarming. One only hopes that the chief minister, Dharam Singh, does not relent.

 Yours faithfully,

D. Kanjilal, Bangalore

 Sir ? The gruesome rape and murder of Pratibha Murthy in Bangalore has sent shock waves through the BPO industry and its employees. The attack was well planned, which indicates that the rapist was keeping a watch on his victim. This also points to the neglect shown by BPO companies to the safety of their women employees. While Hewlett Packard is largely responsible for the tragedy that was entirely avoidable, we cannot deny the fact that sometimes provocative dress and behaviour on the part of women invite rapists. 

 The pragmatic measures adopted by the Karnataka director-general of police may go a long way in averting similar catastrophes. But BPOs also have to take responsibility. If call centres cannot provide proper security for their staff, it is time they wind up night shifts. After all, why should we allow multinationals to cash in on the precious lives of India?s youngsters?

 Yours faithfully,

U.S. Iyer, Bangalore

 Sir ? Pratibha Murthy?s rapist deserves capital punishment (?Murder shock for call centre?, Dec 17). This mishap should force BPOs to tighten security provisions for employees. The call centres should provide temporary accommodation close to the workplace for their women employees working on night shifts. This gruesome incident has brought to the open the unsafe conditions under which these women work and travel. The IT industry, which managed to influence the government to amend labour laws to permit women to work on night shifts, has to strengthen security arrangements for these women first.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? As ?Fear in the city? (Dec 25), makes amply clear, Indian cities are becoming increasingly unsafe, vulnerable and crime- prone. Both men and women are at tremendous risk. Women, naturally, feel more insecure, especially those who work in the IT sectors, media, BPO and the like. Eve-teasers, as well as those who take part in organized crime, roam the city without any fear of the law. Police vigil is inadequate, given the population of each city. More police outposts should be immediately set-up. Night vigil should be stepped up and the women?s cell in police stations should be more proactive.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?I don?t feel safe in Bangalore anymore? (Dec 25) depicts the fate of the Bangalore IT personnel. The brightest of them are being victimized in one way or the other, and the state law and order enforcing authority does not seem to be bothered. There are repeated cases of theft of moneybags, credit cards and mobiles. Bangalore today seems steeped in Kannada chauvinism and provincialism as outsiders get more and more victimized for being alien to the culture and language. One shudders to think what might become of this city when this chauvinism reaches fanatical proportions.

 Yours faithfully, 

Chandan Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? Pratibha Murthy?s murder should be an eye-opener for BPOs operating in Calcutta, especially in Salt Lake Sector V, which is away from the lights and sounds of the city proper. Many women engaged in this industry have had to quit their jobs, and not merely because of the tedious work-load during the nights. Some leave because they doubt their safety. The remuneration does not compensate for the risk such night shifts entails for a woman. The fairer sex, in any case, find themselves at the receiving end as many do not ultimately get the promised pay packet. The lack of organization among employees allow employers to take them for granted. It would perhaps be better if BPOs engage women for day shifts for less pay. This could solve part of the problem regarding their safety.

 Yours faithfully,

D. Ghosh, Calcutta

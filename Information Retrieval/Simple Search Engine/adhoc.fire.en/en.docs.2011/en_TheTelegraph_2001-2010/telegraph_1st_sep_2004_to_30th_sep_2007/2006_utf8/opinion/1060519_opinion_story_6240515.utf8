 NEW TROUBLE

 The Bharatiya Janata Party?s troubles show no signs of abating. After Mr Madan Lal Khurana and Ms Uma Bharati, it is now Mr Babulal Marandi who has cried foul over the state of the party before leaving it. Apart from the fact that Mr Marandi was a vice-president of the BJP and chief minister of Jharkhand, his departure could be a blow to the party. He was among the most important tribal leaders of a party that sought to expand its social base by bringing the tribal people to its fold. The BJP?s recent successes in states such as Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Orissa were partly because of this strategy. The sangh parivar?s persistent efforts to re-convert tribal Christians to Hinduism had thus more to do with politics than with religion. Also, Mr Marandi?s complaints about corruption in the government in Jharkhand could be just as damaging for the party. The state unit of the party has long been afflicted by factionalism. If the government of Mr Arjun Munda appears to be somewhat directionless, it is largely because of the state of his own party. 

 Clearly, Mr Marandi?s moves are a prelude to a realignment of political forces in Jharkhand. Even before he left the BJP, he had floated the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha along with some politicians from other parties. Their aim is to launch a regional party that may take up the old cause of the state?s tribal people. Mr Marandi will, however, need to compete with older parties such as the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and the Jharkhand Party for the support of the tribal people. At present, the political space in the state is divided between the Congress and the BJP, and the regional parties are allied with either of the two national parties. It is too early to judge if Mr Marandi?s moves can make any difference. But there is little doubt that he will be a source of uncertainty for Mr Munda?s government that survives on the support of half a dozen independent legislators.

 DIARY

 Somnath Chatterjee?s reign in the lower house of parliament can lay claim to many firsts. Never has a Lok Sabha speaker been found to speak as much as Chatterjee (LK Advani can vouch for that, after being repeatedly interrupted in his speech on the Quattrochhi affair recently) nor has there been any threatening to quit as many times (his latest was when he thought the verbal duel over MP?s development had gone too far). But it is also thanks to Somnath Chatterjee that the Lok Sabha got to celebrate the National Languages Day for the first time. It was the speaker himself who set the ball rolling in his chaste Bangla. Somnathda reminded the house of how Bangladesh resisted the imposition of Urdu by Pakistan. The mood he created soon had his Marxist brothers resorting to Bangla. Not to be outdone, Pranabda, too, joined in. And then followed the rest. There was Ananth Kumar pontificating in Kannada, and the DMK MPs spluttering in Tamil. But the Bihar MP, Prabhunath Jha, refused to join in. He said that though his language was Bhojpuri, he would not speak it. Not being a part of the Eighth Schedule, the Bhojpuri he spoke would not be recorded in the day?s minutes. Did his wisdom lessen the cacophony in the house? Perhaps no. But still, let?s thank god for small mercies. 

 When it comes to public speaking, the leftists take the cake. But, remember, it is a generation that divides Somnath Chatterjee and the Telemarxist Sitaram Yechuri, who, obviously, has more ideas up his sleeve. Tired of fielding questions from the TVwallahs about the Iran vote, the nuclear deal and so on, Yechuri made a bright suggestion, ?I would be speaking on all these in parliament. So why don?t you all cut live and take my speech?? The idea, evidently, had no takers for not a single channel other than the government-funded one, showed Yechuri holding forth.

 The Congress has a peculiar problem. The former external affairs minister, K Natwar Singh, refuses to come to terms with his diminished status. Much to the embarrassment of his senior colleagues, he continues to occupy the front row on the treasury benches in the Rajya Sabha which is almost exclusively reserved for senior ministers. In fact, he continues to occupy the same seat he sat on as the foreign minister. Meanwhile, Singh?s interrogation by the enforcement directorate has reportedly unearthed some new facts that may lead to the impounding of his passport. Will that finally unseat him?

 Looks like there are more ghosts bothering LK Advani than he can handle. After Jinnah, there is another from the past. The former Assam CM, Prafulla Mahanta, is said to have alleged at a press conference that the secret killings of Ulfa men between 1998-2001 were carried out at the behest of the then Union home minister, LK Advani. Mahanta?s ?confession? came after a PIL was filed at the Supreme Court charging Mahanta for the killings. Apparently, notices have been issued in this respect to the Union home and defence ministries. 

 Its a familiar pattern now. Everytime a politician turns minister, posters (funded, allegedly, by the men concerned themselves) crop up on walls congratulating this ?unique? achievement. The same thing happened when Ajay Maken and Ashwini Kumar got the post of junior ministers in urban development and industry respectively. Maken?s case was understandable. He represents New Delhi parliamentary constituency in the Lok Sabha and had reason to announce to his constituents his newly-acquired status. But Kumar being a Rajya Sabha member from Punjab, had little reason to plaster the walls in New Delhi. Wags soon got to work and there was speculation whether Kumar had set his gaze on contesting the next parliamentary elections from South Delhi. Over to Kumar now.

 Of the names announced by the government in the nominated category for the Rajya Sabha, two have run into controversy. The names of the ex-chairman of the finance commission, C Rangarajan, and ace journalist, N Ram, are doing the rounds, but pressure is mounting to give a seat to the minorities. There are suggestions to nominate AM Ahmadi, former chief justice of India, who is also supposed to be in the run for the chairmanship of the minority commission. But the left are gunning for Ram, and with some help from a Hindu reader like Sonia Gandhi, Ram could steal a march over Ahmadi. 

 Mani Shankar Aiyar may have lost his prized petroleum portfolio, but his sense of humour remains intact. The minister of panchayat and sports has been measuring his fall figuratively ? from a whopping Rs 800,000 crore-budget ministry to a Rs 80 crore budget. But he is making the most of it. His ministry is now busy building a massive sports complex in the capital to host the 2010 Commonwealth Games. The location is excellent except for the fact that it is bang next to the new Akshardham temple. The minister has apparently instructed that all rooms in the new structure be make sound-proof so that the incessant bells of the temple early in the morning do not wake up the less-religious-minded sportspersons. The Stephanian did not stop there. With a wink, he is said to have added that sound-proof rooms could be useful in other spheres as well. Suresh Kalmadi, organizer for the 2010 games, seems to agree with Aiyar, wholeheartedly.

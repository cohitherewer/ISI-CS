 BENGALIS FLAT EARTH 

 All rumours that Bengalis have undergone a radical transformation and are now eager to welcome new investments in West Bengal are untrue. The attitude of Bengalis remains what it was even though the world around them has completely changed. Bengalis seem to inhabit a mental space in which the earth is conceived of as being flat, with a monster waiting at one end to gobble up whoever falls off. The best example of this antediluvian attitude is the decision of the Left Front to stall the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, by despatching it to an all-party select committee of the Bidhan Sabha. The new bill proposes to relax the rural land ceiling to facilitate the setting up of manufacturing units by new investors. The new bill is a necessary complement to Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees grand plan to make West Bengal an attractive investment destination. But members of the flat earth society read the Left Front have decided to scupper the project because they do not want agricultural land to be transferred to industry.

 It will be simplistic to blame only one particular political formation for this perverse and retrogressive attitide. Even those who are opposed to the left inhabit the same intellectual space. Witness the opposition of the Trinamool Congress to the Tata Motors unit in Singur, and the Congress partys failure to come out strongly in favour of a policy of industrialization and economic reforms in West Bengal. And insofar as political parties reflect the opinions of the society in which they thrive, the views of all political parties on the subject and their unanimity on the issue suggest that Bengalis, as a people, are caught in a bizarre time warp. These opinions can be interpreted in two ways. One is that Bengalis believe that economic development of West Bengal is possible without a large-scale transfer of agricultural land to manufacturing units. The other is that Bengalis do not want economic development and love stagnancy. Both interpretations support the statement that Bengalis believe that the world is flat and that they can continue to survive by clinging on to views that are both absurd and backward-looking. No project of industrialization is possible without a movement of land and population from agriculture to industry. And legal steps like the new bill are needed to facilitate that transfer. Without industrialization there can be no economic development, and without the latter there is only spiralling poverty and deepening stagnation. These are elementary lessons from history if only Bengalis would learn them.

 Mr Bhattacharjees plan to invite investors is a glimmer of hope. And he, poor man, is trying valiantly to convince Bengalis that the world has changed and that it is indeed round, not flat. But his ship of hope will continue to flounder because his sailors are terrified of that monster that lurks at the end of the flat earth.

 MAJOR FALLOUT

 The nuclear test reportedly conducted by North Korea could have very serious implications for Asian security, and will have an impact on international relations even beyond the continent. Only a concert of great powers, driven by a common interest in regional and international stability, can prevent the test from generating arguably the most severe international crises of the post-Cold War era. It is well known that North Korea has been threatening to go nuclear for nearly a decade now, and was believed to have a well developed capacity for manufacturing nuclear weapons. And yet, it was widely believed, that Pyongyang was using its nuclear capability more as a bargaining chip for economic and political reasons. With the least developed economy in East Asia, North Korea clearly needed massive external assistance for its economic revival. But its quest for nuclear weapons was also linked to notions of nationalism, self-esteem and the more parochial interests of the authoritarian regime ruling the country. In this sense, the testing of nuclear weapons is a clear failure of American nuclear diplomacy as well as the multi-party talks that had earlier sought to find accommodation with the regime. 

 The consequences of the test are far-reaching. The Korean peninsula, after nearly half-a-century, will be the focus of international attention and will probably soon be described by international strategists as the most dangerous place in the international system. The regional implications are evident: the test may force Japan to revisit its no-nuclear stance. But the extra-regional implications could be grave too. The North Korean test could pave the way for a test by a country like Iran. Unfortunately, for policy-makers in the United States of America, the test will only suggest that negotiating with so-called rogue regimes is futile and the use of force is the only answer. All this could easily spiral into a major international crisis. One immediate casualty could be the India-US nuclear deal. It is most unlikely that American congressmen will vote to allow nuclear cooperation with India so soon after a nuclear test. 

 What is vital is to begin serious negotiations with North Korea immediately. The major responsibility rests on Russia, China, Japan and, of course, the US. The worst has happened, but it may still be possible to contain the damage and even persuade North Korea to roll back its nuclear programme if there are sufficient incentives on offer. It may be recalled that India played a major role in diffusing the Korean crisis of the Fifties. At a time when the stakes are much greater, New Delhi could do well to play a mediating role. This will not only help increase Indias stature, but also demonstrate its role as a responsible nuclear power.

 Sad and alert 

 lines 

 JOGEN CHOWDHURY: HIS LIFE AND TIMES (CIMA, price not mentioned) 

 reproduces the artist?s recent works on paper, with dry 

 pastels, pen and ink, together with some earlier paintings. 

 Most of the images are, in the artist?s own words, ?alert, 

 sad and disturbed?. The most disturbing are the human figures 

 with their air of being suspended in a grey and black world 

 of inner contortions, their eyes ? the ?conduit of tensions? 

 ? generating the peculiar psychological atmosphere of each 

 drawing. There is also a series of valuable interviews, taken 

 by Rita Datta, in which Chowdhury makes important pronouncements 

 on the role of distortion in his art, especially in his depictions 

 of human figures, gestures and expressions. Chowdhury?s art 

 is rooted in the human, and it is distortion that keeps the 

 drawings suspended between figuration and abstraction. This 

 is a pair of heads done on paper with dry pastel in 2005.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Always the fairest

 Sir It is surprising that scholars need to toil to find a truth as mundane as females are becoming better looking than men (Beautiful folks and lovely girls, July 1). We know it from the days of the Ramayana, where males south of the Vindhyas are banars, and those of Lanka rakshashas, while the females, la Tara or Mandodari, are perfect human females. Even today, belles from the South outsmart their male counterparts in Bollywood. And during the monsoon, one only has to see how much more colourful girls umbrellas are than those of the boys.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tapan Pal, 

 Batanagar

 Darkness at noon

 Sir The photograph with the caption, Artisans have lunch near unfinished idols of Durga in Kumartuli (Aug 8), gives the impression that these artisans still live and work in the middle ages. Durga idols from Calcutta are exported not only to various Indian states but also to countries around the globe. Quite obviously, artisans selling these idols earn quite a bit of money, sometimes even foreign exchange. And yet, the working conditions in Kumartuli remain primitive and unhealthy. The government ought to provide subsidies to these artisans so that Kumartuli gets a face-lift and the artisans get a comfortable environment to work in. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir Next week we are going to celebrate the 59th anniversary of our independence. From the ramparts of the Red Fort, the prime minister will list the achievements of the past year and will also solemnly promise better days ahead. His party, which swears by Mahatma Gandhi, claims to have done wonders for the people of the country in the years that it has been in power. West Bengal, which has been ruled by the party of the proletariat for the better part of the post-independence period, is also supposed to have prospered, if its rulers are to be believed. I am almost tempted to believe both of them but for the picture on August 8, which showed three skilled artisans having their lunch. One look at their plates says it all. There, you will find only rice and nothing else, not even a hint of dal or curry. The man on the left has the luxury of rubbing something on his outstretched tongue may be a piece of chilli. His colleagues have no such luck. But who says we are not progressing? What about the shopping malls, five-star hotels, restaurants, highrises an fly-overs? Who cares about a few poor artisans?

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.B. Gupta, 

 Calcutta 

 Brolly query

 Sir The article, Under the shade (Aug 6), informs that K.C. Paul and Sons has retail outlets in Ballygunge and Beadon Street. But we have no owned outlet at these places for retail sale. The article even got our address wrong. The correct address is 82, Pandit Purusottam Roy (not Rao) Street, Calcutta-7000007. Against the information that we sell more than 100 pieces of umbrella daily, I would like to mention that we usually manufacture 3,600 pieces daily in the monsoon season. On enquiry at our outlet, we found that no one from The Telegraph had visited the outlet to collect the information. In that case, most of the article has to be fictitious. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.N. Paul 

 (for K.C. Paul and Sons), Calcutta

 Our correspondent replies: I called up the K.C. Paul office repeatedly. A lady finally answered the phone and said that Anant Nath Paul heads K.C. Paul but was unavailable for comment. She declined to provide his cellphone number. On asking about outlets, she mentioned that the company has its own wholesale outlet at Burrabazar. At the outlet, an unidentified official said that K.C. Paul sells over 100 umbrellas a day.

 Letters to Editor

 Ill postino

 Sir ? At a time when fast information and communication systems are a necessity, the proposal to amend the Indian Post Office Act will only hinder the economic growth of the country and needlessly inconvenience countless ordinary citizens (?You?ve got only snail mail?, April 21). The department of posts is not a reliable alternative to the private courier services. On an average, a courier company takes less time to deliver letters and parcels than even the speed post service of the postal department. Moreover, the work culture of government offices does not inspire confidence in the customer. It is debatable whether the department of posts can commit itself to strict deadlines. Besides, by its own admission, the government cannot match the private services in terms of quality. After all, it was the failure of the public sector that had compelled the government to liberalize the Indian economy in the first place. It would be wrong to punish the people and the private couriers for the government?s own inefficiency. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debabrata Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The report on the proposed amendments to the Indian Post Office Act was irresponsible and prejudiced. The correspondent expressed doubts about the capability of the department of posts to match the value-added services offered by private couriers, such as home or office pick-ups and tracking on the internet. He is perhaps unaware that the movement and delivery status of the postal department?s speed post articles can be tracked on the website indiapost.gov.in. Post offices catering to the corporate sector offer pick-up services from offices. Besides, postal stationeries are sold at one?s doorstep in select neighbourhoods. The postal department is also introducing new-age services such as e-Post and instant money order. To lay to rest the doubts expressed about the postal department?s ability to handle bulk mails, such as mobile phone bills, it is enough to point out that the department has for a long time been delivering BSNL?s landline bills as well as the bills of many cellular service networks.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? To amend the Indian Post Office Act would be to do a gross injustice to the courier agencies and their employees. It will also be inconvenient for the public. Neither the ambience of the post office nor the attitude of its staff is customer-friendly. The average post office is not only cluttered but it also lacks basic facilities like toilets, seats and fans. To top it all, even additional charges do not ensure prompt service. To post an ordinary letter, one has to first stand in a queue to get it weighed and its stamp-value calculated at one counter. Then there is a second queue in which one must be ready to pay the exact amount, but the stamps of his required denominations may be out of stock. Often, the customer has to settle for stamps of a higher denomination. Then comes the hunt for glue (since stamps do not have adhesive at the back anymore). Needless to say, registered letters require greater perseverance and patience. There is always the possibility of employees being absent from their seats for long periods. These pampered postal employees can also hold the country to ransom with strikes. Whatever problems they may have, private couriers at least do not deny service.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Central government is bent on stifling the growth of the Indian economy. The move to restrict the services of private courier companies is a case in point. The growth of the internet, cheap telephone services, and private couriers has added to the woes of the government?s post and telegraph services. However, the postal department does have an enviable network. The government must utilize this strength creatively; it should introduce new and varied services and dispense with redundant activities. The United States of America, which re-invented its postal department a few years ago, provides a usable model. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The move to ban private couriers from carrying letters weighing less than 300 grams is a draconian step taken expressly to destroy the courier companies. Instead of such a brazen show of muscle power, the government should try to improve the efficiency of the postal department. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The government seeks to not only debar private couriers from carrying letters weighing less than 300 grams but to also ruin them financially through the hefty license fee. In addition, they will have to pay a service tax of 10 per cent. This amounts to the revival of licence-raj and monopoly. This move will lead to the loss of thousands of jobs since some of the private operators will have to shut shop. Undoubtedly, the ultimate victim is the customer. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V. Krishnamoorthy, Bangalore

 Sir ? Private courier services have ushered in an era of competitiveness, speedy deliveries and accountability. Customers are more than happy with them. The department of posts, on the other hand, is synonymous with irresponsibility. Granting it even a partial monopoly will be disastrous. Reviving a failed public utility service by suppressing its successful alternative will not make the public sector ?liberal and competitive?.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? Universal service obligation is a flimsy excuse used by the government to infringe on consumer rights guaranteed by the market economy. The proposed amendment would be unfair most of all to customers facing emergencies as well as those who can afford better service at a higher price. There is no reason why rural postal service has to be improved depriving those who can pay for efficient service by private operators. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Joy Mallick, Calcutta

 LEFT IN THE LURCH

 The left is clearly out of step with a changing India. Fortunately, as the failure of the left-sponsored airport strike showed, the forces of change are stronger than its obstructionist politics. Such was the absurdity of the left?s position that it had little option but to beat a retreat barely three days after it had backed the ill-conceived strike. The left leaders cannot even justify it as a strategy of going one step back in order to move two steps forward in future. The left?s fundamental positions on modernization and privatization are rooted in an outdated ideology. Only superficially, its protests were about protecting the jobs of the airport employees. That was why the protesters went ahead with their plan of ceasing work despite the assurance by the civil aviation minister, Mr Praful Patel, that the privatization of the airports would not involve major job losses. Its real intention was to stop the government from involving the private sector in the revamp of the airports. This reflects the old socialist faith in the imagined virtues of the public sector. India?s experience with the public sector, though, has been very different. The state sector has been marked by inefficiency, redundancy and the lack of accountability. The private sector, on the other hand, is associated with flexibility, diversity and competition. Its ideological blinkers prevent the left from seeing the plain truth.

 However, it is possible that the tussle over the modernization of airports would create fresh tensions between the United Progressive Alliance government and the left. There have been other issues causing occasional rifts, such as the question of allowing foreign direct investment in retail and labour reforms. It is a good omen that the Manmohan Singh government did not buckle under the left?s pressure on the airports issue. A retreat by the government would have sent out wrong signals about its political will to move ahead with the reforms programmes. The government had earlier backed down on its proposal on the divestment of Bhel in the face of the left?s opposition. The government?s recent decision on FDI in retail and now its resolve on the modernization of the two airports suggest that the Centre is ready to face up to the left?s pressure tactics. There is a big gap between the left?s old ways of agit-prop and the pro-reform policies of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Bengal. The more India espouses the mantra of change, the more the comrades would find themselves left in the lurch.

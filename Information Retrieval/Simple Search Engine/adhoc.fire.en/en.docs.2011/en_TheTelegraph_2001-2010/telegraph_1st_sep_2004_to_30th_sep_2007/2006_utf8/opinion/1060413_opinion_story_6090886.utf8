The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOO EASY

 There can be too much of a good thing. It is rather a pity that the Election Commission is beginning to tend towards that excess, because the thoroughness of its pre-election arrangements has provided cause for hope to many voters. But the EC has now taken up the censor?s scalpel, and busied itself with carving up campaign CDs that political parties have to submit to it before they can be released for public viewing. Neither images of the horrors in Gujarat in 2002 nor sights of police violence during the Emergency have made it past the scalpel. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has suffered the cuts in both cases, but that is immaterial. It has to be asked instead how the EC is defining its own duties. This is not an insignificant question; India represents a complicated and delicate balance of powers in its functioning, and moments when the balance seems to teeter on the edge of confusion are frequent enough.

 The EC is committed to free and fair elections, and so far it has not only been making that practical as far as is possible ? West Bengal this year is an example ? but also pushing for electoral reforms such as transparency in election funding for a long time. Its model code of conduct has been in place for many years, and campaign rules ? no graffiti, for example ? have been more than usually strictly enforced. The question is whether the EC can enforce limits even on what the contending parties are to say about themselves and their rivals. While communally inflammatory or personally insulting material is rightly disallowed, is it reasonable to insist that political parties talk only about their own achievements and programmes and not about their rivals? failures? Deleting sections on the Gujarat genocide in a campaign CD may be supported by the communal argument, but it has to be asked whether it is for the EC to snip them off. Scalpel in hand, it can then do anything. And it has: excising Emergency images while retaining the accompanying message. For good or ill, the Emergency is part of the history of the Congress and of the country, just as the Gujarat genocide is part of another kind of history ? of country, party and communities. In levelling the ground in the name of fairness, the EC, while monitoring restive political parties, seems to have stepped into the grey region of proscribing the voter?s powers of discrimination.

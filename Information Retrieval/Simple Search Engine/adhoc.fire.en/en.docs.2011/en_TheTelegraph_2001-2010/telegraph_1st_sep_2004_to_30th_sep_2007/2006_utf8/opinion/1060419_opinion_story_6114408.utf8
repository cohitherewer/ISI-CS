 CREDIT BONUS

 The Reserve Bank of India?s decision to hold interest rates steady at a time when asset prices are soaring, is, to say the least, intriguing. At the time of its third quarter review of monetary policy in January, the central bank had raised the policy rate by 25 basis points, citing the need to rein in high asset prices and the need to preserve credit quality. It had then said that inflationary expectations needed to be curbed, particularly because the pass-through impact of high crude oil prices had not yet been felt. The situation is no different now than in January. In spite of the hike in interest rates in January, rampant credit growth continues, industrial growth is very high, the housing market is red hot, crude oil prices are rising and the stock market is now one of the most expensive in the world. In other words, the rate hike in January has had little effect other than pushing up bond yields. In the circumstances, the least that the market expected was that the central bank would continue to raise rates. True, the inflation numbers have been very benign, but analysts have pointed out that the prices of items that make up almost a quarter of the index are not frequently updated. The growth in money supply continues to be high.

 In this context, it would have been prudent of the central bank to raise the policy rate. By not doing so, it has signalled that it is comfortable with the pace of credit expansion and with asset prices ? a signal diametrically opposite to the one it made in January. To be sure, it has made a few changes in the prudential norms. It has increased the risk weight on bank lending to commercial real estate, it has increased the provisioning on standard advances on personal loans, capital market exposures, residential housing beyond Rs 20 lakh and commercial real estate loans, and it has stipulated that exposure to venture capital funds be treated as part of capital market exposure and assigned a higher risk weight of 150 per cent. These are all areas in which credit growth has been very rapid and the central bank has done well to ensure that banks will now have to set aside more capital for lending to these sensitive sectors. Nevertheless, it is debatable whether increasing the risk weight by 25 basis points will seriously affect lending to the real estate sector. In short, the central bank has not done enough to dampen credit and asset price growth and it is likely that interest rates have merely paused in their upward journey.

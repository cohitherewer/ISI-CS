 VANISHING ACT

 It must be a bizarre government whose ministers go missing in dubious action. The story of three ministers in the Jharkhand government is even more curious. They have reportedly gone missing only to try and unmake their own government. But the episode may not really be as surprising as it appears to be. On the contrary, this was a farce waiting to be enacted. The stage for it had been set by none other than the chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, when he used patently immoral methods to put together his government. Ironically, the hide-and-seek game of his flock began with Mr Munda escorting his group to undisclosed locations in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan until he managed to form his government with their support. He cannot, therefore, take the moral high ground on the conduct of his disloyal ministers or of the opposition parties. That is not to say that the Congress or the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha does not have a hand in all this. Clearly, there are no innocents in the power games being played out in Ranchi. 

 Whether Mr Mundas government survives or falls is only incidental to the real story. That the developments in Ranchi once again expose the murky face of Indian politics is also not the most important thing about them. Ultimately, it is a sad story of the cynicism of a section of the Indian political class that will do anything to subvert the system for its own benefits. The worst sufferers of their unprincipled politics are the people who elect them to public office. Once elected, these politicians care nothing about either governance or the peoples interests. It is easy to see how damaging such conduct can be for a state like Jharkhand. It is not only one of the poorest states in the country, but also one of the worst affected by Maoist violence. The least that the state needs is a stable government. But too many Indian politicians would love to profit from instability.

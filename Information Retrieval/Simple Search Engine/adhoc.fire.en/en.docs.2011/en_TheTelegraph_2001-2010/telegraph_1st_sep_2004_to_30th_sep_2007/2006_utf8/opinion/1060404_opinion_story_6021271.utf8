The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 START AT THE BEGINNING 

The lowering of the age of entry by high schools is 

a response to the changing socio-economic realities in urban India, argues Devi 

Kar

 Growing up fast 

History has taught us that, like any mortal, no entity 

can be unchanging or permanent. Empire, nation, society, community, industrial 

house, institution, each has to go through ups and downs and all kinds of transformation. 

But when it comes to our immediate society we end up lamenting or condemning the 

changes that are taking place. Records show that every generation has done the 

same.

If we compare today?s urban middle and upper class 

children to those of yesteryear, the most significant change that we see is the 

frenetic pace of life they lead. And it is this pace that is governing much of 

their conduct and behaviour. They are far more ambitious, far more impatient, 

far more easily bored or frustrated. They are definitely more independent in many 

ways but surprisingly dependent in others.

To begin at the beginning, the age at which these 

children start going to school has come down considerably. Newspapers keep reporting 

the undesirable mushrooming of pre-schools while educationists keep talking about 

childhood being ?killed? by schools which are taking in younger and younger students 

each year and parents who are thoughtlessly contributing to this lethal trend. 

The motive of high schools that have recently lowered their age of entry to three 

years, has been attributed to a wish to ?eat into the share of pre-schools?. Incidentally, 

this author was admitted to one of the most reputed high schools in the city at 

the age of three, over fifty years ago. At that time there were hardly any pre-schools 

whose ?share could be eaten into?. So it stands to reason that there could be 

other less crass motives for having a nursery attached to a high school.

Those of us who have been around in the educational 

field for a length of time, tend to subscribe to the educational prescriptions 

and principles of our own times. However, it is important to recognize ground 

realities and respond to them intelligently. Yes, it is important for the child 

to be at home with its mother for the first few years. But the problem is that 

the mother herself is not at home for the child to be with. Socio-economic forces 

do not allow a choice today ? women have to contribute substantially to the family 

finances. And working mothers would much rather leave their children in school, 

where they spend time under supervision with other children, than at home alone 

or with unreliable domestic hands. Besides, where are live-in domestic staff to 

be found these days? As for grandparents, more often than not, they do not inhabit 

the same house, they may not be residing in the same city and many are preoccupied 

with their own careers. Thus the advent of the pre-school.

It has been said that the Montessori system originated 

from a need to look after the children of women who had been pressed into service 

during World War II. Today, a pre-school very often plays the role of a cr?che 

for children of working women. A disturbing trend is that the primary goal of 

the innumerable pre-schools that have sprung up is turning out to be preparing 

children for admission into high school. Needless to say, the primary goal of 

any school (distinct from coaching centres and crammers) should be to educate 

its students.

In this scenario, a high school with a nursery section, 

is, in fact, doing a great service to society by preventing or cutting short damaging 

and dubious educational practices with very young children. The advantage is felt 

only if the admission procedure is relatively stress-free, the nursery adequately 

equipped and the teachers appropriately trained. A good school, with the required 

resources, would surely want to be responsible for the care of its children right 

from the initial stages. And like it or not, the initial stage of schooling happens 

to be sooner today, just as completion of formal learning happens later. Moreover, 

happily, the concept of continuing education and lifelong learning is being warmly 

embraced everywhere.

Another reality that needs to be addressed is that 

our children (middle and upper class urban) are far more precocious, worldly-wise, 

street-smart, techno-savvy and sexually aware. Adolescence comes sooner, sometimes 

even before reaching middle school. Characteristics of adulthood are exhibited 

by high school students in various ways ? indeed many reach adulthood officially 

before they leave school. Sometimes it appears that they lead dual lives ? that 

of adults outside school and children inside of it. And at home? It depends wholly 

on the attitude of their parents. So let us not lament the loss of childhood ? 

we cannot stem the tide. The West recognizes that today?s tweenagers (nine to 

twelve-year olds) are yesterday?s teenagers; today?s teenagers have attained adult 

status earlier than their counterparts did some years ago.

Keeping these socio-economic realities in mind, we 

need to identify what can be changed or prevented instead of trying to turn the 

clock back. And something that can and should be changed is our examination-oriented 

system of assessment. A thorough overhaul will automatically lead to a vibrant 

school education. In other words, our children will not continue to lead dismal 

lives comprising school, textbook, private tutor, coaching centre and examination 

hall. This is certainly a cycle that must be broken. 

Hopefully, our children will develop the ability to 

study independently, rediscover the joys of learning and make it a lifelong pursuit.

 Letters to Editor

 The problem with language

 Sir My background is bilingual, comprising Urdu and Bengali. But I converse with my children in English in view of its importance in building a career in the modern global village. Urdu and Bengali came to them naturally. The renaming of Bangalore as Bengaluru, following the enforcement of Kannada in the citys schools, has set yet another example of regional chauvinism (Hi Bengaluru, bye Bangalore, Oct 17). This is sure to land the average student in trouble when he looks for jobs in front-offices and call-centres in this age of tourism and outsourcing.

 Yours faithfully,

 Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Chimes of freedom 

 Sir Ashok Mitra rightly 

 says, with reference to Vande Mataram, that those 

 who do not believe in the worship of idols have every right 

 to record their conscientious objection if asked to sing 

 the song (Mother fixation, Oct 13). However, 

 one cannot help asking, is it not stupid to equate the singing 

 of a song with idolatry? Even if Vande Mataram does address 

 Mother India, is it too much of a sacrilege to imagine ones 

 country as a mother? Muslims are proving themselves to be 

 overtly devoted to the letter of the law in condemning the 

 song. Besides, when Prophet Muhammad had laid down the rules 

 of Islam, the concepts of nation or motherland, as we know 

 them today, were non-existent. To adapt to a changing world, 

 people need to revise their ideas. While protecting their 

 identity, Muslims should also try to be more flexible in 

 their interaction with other communities.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir The mother in Bankim Chandra Chatterjees 

 Vande Mataram is admittedly not Mother India. But neither 

 is it Mother Bengal, as Ashok Mitra says. The concept of 

 the nation, in the modern sense of the term, was still in 

 an embryonic stage in the late 19th century when Bankim 

 was writing Anandamath. Nation was understood only as a 

 race, hardly, if ever, permeating immediate linguistic borders. 

 At the same time, writers and intellectuals were aware of 

 the narrowness in definition and tried to transcend it in 

 their writing. No matter how sectarian Chatterjees 

 composition might seem in retrospect today, he was trying 

 to equate what he understood by a nation with a wider idea 

 of Mother India to create an image of the Indian state in 

 the psyche of the emerging nation. In no way did he compose 

 a deliberate, parochial hosanna to Mother Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Maiti, Calcutta

 Sir Nineteenth century 

 Bengal was the hub of the British empire in India. Absence 

 of communicative facilities and the slow dissemination of 

 information created a nation within a nation in Bengal. 

 Hence Bengal became synonymous with the whole of India. 

 Bankim Chandra Chatterjees Vande Mataram was perhaps 

 not addressed to Mother India. But neither was Bankim concentrating 

 on Bengal.

 Muslims cannot indeed be forced 

 to sing Vande Mataram if it offends their religious 

 sentiments. But that does not mean that the song should 

 be banned. Though eating beef is sacrilegious for the Hindus, 

 cows are slaughtered in many parts of India. It seems that 

 Ashok Mitra, and not Vande Mataram, is trying to 

 divide India on parochial lines by stressing the regional 

 rather than the national importance of the song. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Susenjit Guha, Calcutta

 Sir Ashok Mitra is right: 

 does not the human resource development ministry have anything 

 more useful to do than waste its time on outdated issues? 

 Tagores Jana gana mana has long been accepted as our 

 national anthem. So why try to make Muslims sing a song 

 they have objections against? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Soma Datta, Siliguri

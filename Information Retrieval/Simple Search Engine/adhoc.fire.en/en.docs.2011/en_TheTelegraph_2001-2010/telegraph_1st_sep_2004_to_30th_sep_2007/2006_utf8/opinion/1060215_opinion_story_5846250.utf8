 RICE AND LENTILS

 The quickest way to stop little girls from being married off or trafficked is to give them free rice and lentils. This is what the government of West Bengal has worked out recently. The Central ?programme for adolescent girls? had already been distributing free rice to girls in the Jalpaiguri and Purulia districts. Now the state welfare department, probably with the help of Britain?s department for international development, will add a free ration of lentils to that. This would cost Rs 1,200 per girl annually, and Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has publicly declared this to be a reparation of sorts for having failed to prevent poor, adolescent girls marrying or getting into sex-work. The logic behind this is confused and simplistic, and such a solution only allows the government to avoid taking responsibility for its complex and systemic failures in this matter.

 Mr Bhattacharjee has linked child-marriage and trafficking with illiteracy and high drop-out rates. But, with bizarre illogic, his government?s scheme goes on to reward drop-outs with free rations. It is certainly true that poverty and illiteracy are at the root of these evils, apart from deeply entrenched discriminatory attitudes towards female children. But the solutions will therefore have to go to the root of the problem for them to be effective in the longer run. Improving the primary education system, with its built-in mid-day meal scheme, would be a better idea. Girls and their parents should be rewarded for attending school, rather than for dropping out. Improving healthcare infrastructure in the rural areas, together with vigilant and gender-sensitized policing, and reviewing the laws would also go a long way in ?protecting? girls. Trafficking of young girls or child-marriage are complex phenomena arising out of a web of social and economic factors, the totality of which has to be addressed when trying to deal with the problem. Providing free rations is an absurd form of evasion.

 The old ardour changeth

 Jyoti Malhotra wonders whether the peoples uprising in Balochistan will be used by the West to engineer a regime change in Pakistan 

 This way, or that?

 Coming in the wake of the Mumbai bomb blasts, the continuing interest in Pakistans Balochistan crisis seems to have tapped into a growing aggressive mood at home. For the first time since Indira Gandhi helped shape the destiny of the subcontinent by lopping off an unwieldy East Pakistan and actively aiding the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, India is watching with keen interest the new soft spot in Pakistans underbelly. 

 You do not need to be a rocket scientist to arrive at the following conclusion just as Pakistan has refused to stop stoking the Kashmir fire since 1947, thereby posing the greatest threat to Indias territorial, emotional and religious integrity since Partition, New Delhi believes it must return the compliment by pointing a finger at Balochistan. 

 You could argue that the barely concealed glee at the continuing unrest in Pakistan is, in fact, vindicated by the spirited criticism of General Pervez Musharraf by none other than the Pakistan press. 

 And therein lies the rub. The more free and independent and democratic-minded the Pakistani press shows itself to be, the more it exposes the generals regime, warts and all. The consequent impression that the head of your state, a top armyman to boot, is unable to establish control during a national crisis, can only add to the Wests (read, Americas) growing discomfort with Pervez Musharraf. 

 After all, how long can you expect a gent to do what you want him to do (capture Osama bin Laden, other members of al Qaida, provide a bulwark for Iran, etc etc), if he cannot even maintain a semblance of order? 

 None other than Pervez Musharraf knows this. Not for nothing, after Pakistan erupted in wave after wave of protest at the killing of the Baloch leader, Nawab Akbar Bugti, did he exhort the people to love Pakistan, above all else. 

 But werent the Pakistanis already doing so, loving their country that is? By gratuitously alluding to their patriotism, Musharraf seems to have irritated a few hundred more citizens, at least of the middle class. 

 There seem to be other straws in the wind that appear to be adding to the general glee over the generals travails. After all, far from becoming a possible wedge in the potential rejigging of the Pakistani state (even in 1971, it was the Cold War power play between the US and the erstwhile Soviet Union that helped Indira Gandhi achieve her hearts desire), Balochistans status as a constantly bleeding wound can only be achieved if the West has arrived at the conclusion that the general is getting increasingly damaged by events at home. 

 Some Indian foreign policy thinkers believe that that is what is, indeed, happening. That America, that great god of strength and realpolitik, is in the act of arriving at the conclusion that there could be life after Pervez Musharraf. 

 A survey of the worlds top ten dictators, dead and alive, commissioned by the British magazine, New Statesman, that is identified with the Tony Blairs Labour Party and we know whose handmaiden he is found that none other than Musharraf qualified. 

 Musharraf was clearly in not-so-august company. With people like Adolf Hitler and Augusto Pinochet and Stalin and Mussolini. Of the living, there was Kim Jong-Il of North Korea, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of Iran and Alexander Lukashenk of Belarus, a new-old Western axis of evil, the now deposed Saddam Hussein replaced by Lukashenko. 

 Clearly, in the grey, shadowy world of geopolitics, once captured in gripping prose by John le Carr, there are no limits to either ambition or despair. Question is, is the compact between Musharraf and the West, forged after 9/11, beginning to unravel? Will the peoples uprising in Balochistan be increasingly used by the West as the perfect democratic tool to engineer regime change? And finally, is Indias comfort level in lecturing Musharraf on Balochistan, a function of the way the wind is blowing in the West? 

 To be sure, New Delhi feels that the Musharraf establishment is getting what it deserves. The fact that the Pakistani media continues to speak about the killing of Bugti in the same breath as the hanging of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto shows that Bugtis cold-blooded murder by the Pakistani army is no mean event. 

 Even more significant, the fact that top former army generals and Inter-Services Intelligence chiefs the same gene-pool from which Musharraf draws his strength and power have openly criticized Musharraf for the same, must truly constitute a decisive moment for Pakistan. 

 It is widely acknowledged that the Pakistan state has always been run by the triumvirate of Allah, the Army and America. It is no ones case that one of these gods is withdrawing support from Musharraf. But it is equally true that the first signs are beginning to emerge, and it would be foolish not to understand what they mean. 

 Of course, in the run-up to general elections in America next year, it would be the perfect irony: George Bushs failing policies all over the world, especially in Iraq, Iran and the Middle East, will be coming full circle with what a number of WASP (white Anglo-Saxon Protestant) security analysts in America are beginning to call, the failing state of Pakistan. Five years after 9/11, following Musharrafs masterstroke in turning his country away from the taliban and assisting America in the fight against al Qaida, such a description would constitute the ultimate irony. 

 And what of India? The Pakistani accusation that Indias intelligence agencies are fomenting the disturbances in Balochistan, via its consulates in southern Afghanistan and on the Iranian side of the border with Pakistan, smacks of loss of control. New Delhi will vociferously deny the charge, of course. In any case, it is within Afghanistan and Irans sovereign right to allow India access to any part of its territory, so Pakistan can hardly complain about that. 

 Still, even as the government continues to piece together evidence of the perpetrators behind the Mumbai train blasts, one thing is certain: if Pakistans ISI, via the Lashkar-e-Toiba is guilty, the national mood will increasingly support a tough line on Pakistan. The criticisim of the uprising in Balochistan is an example.

 Letters to Editor

 Food for thought

 Sir ? One is used to hearing in India that there is surplus foodstock in the country, and the godowns are overflowing with hundreds of tonnes of rotting grains (?Pawar wangles wheat seal?, June 17). It is surprising, therefore, to learn suddenly that the stock of wheat in the country is so depleted that it has to be imported. To top it all, the minister for agriculture, Sharad Pawar, has proposed to relax the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and import 22 million tonnes of wheat which would not meet the PFA?s quality norms. Once the wheat is distributed through the ration shops, it will be consumed by millions of people across the country. Many will suffer from killer diseases as a consequence. Is the Union government trying to eliminate sections of the population, so that it has to spend on the development of fewer people? If the ministers who have passed the proposal believe that the wheat is not harmful, then why not issue this wheat for consumption in the parliament canteen? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The popular belief that the public distribution system gives away sub-standard edibles is getting reinforced. The memory of the PL 480 wheat, sold at ration shops at 62 paise per kg in 1956, is still fresh in people?s mind. The dreaded Parthenium or carrot weed came to India through the wheat sent by the United States of America. It seems that our parliamentarians are determined to import a few more deadly diseases into the country. Environmentalists are strangely silent on this issue. And what about the left? Perhaps they are willing to invite any harm as long as it is not from the US.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir ? It is quite frightening to know that a minister can be so unscrupulous as to import wheat with the potential of endangering the lives of the thousands who consume it. Perhaps nothing better should be expected from a minister more interested in cricket than in the duties of his ministerial office. Indians, by now, should have become accustomed to the ways of their politicians. The leaders of the opposition will probably wake up to their duties and self-righteously accuse the Union cabinet only when people start falling ill. Then, nothing more than a perfunctory inquiry will be ordered into the situation. And the poor people will continue to pay the price of the ministers? callousness. 

 Yours faithfully, 

R. Choudhuri, Calcutta 

 Unholy mess

 Sir ? The inquiry ordered by the chief mahant of the Amarnath yatra into reports of an artificial ice Shiva lingam is outrageous (?Demand for probe into Amarnath lingam?, June19). The lingam is one of nature?s miracles and it has held thousands of devotees in awe over the years. Both the media and the mahant have tried to interfere in the inexplicable workings of nature by first tampering with the lingam and then ordering a probe. The devotees should be left alone with their beliefs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Investigations in India are a means to buy time and allow the culprits to get away. The Amarnath pilgrims had braved inclement weather, terrorism, and other risks to their lives for a darshan of the deity. Whoever has played with their faith by offering them an artificially-created lingam, has committed a sacrilege and deserves to be punished. But the investigation should be fast, and the truth, however unpleasant, should be revealed in its entirety.

 Yours faithfully,

Nitin G. Gokarn, Mumbai 

 Sir ? It is amusing to read about the row over the creation of an ice lingam at Amarnath. Instead of ordering a probe into whether human hands were needed to create the lingam, more thought should be given to why it did not form as usual this year. If this is the result of global warming, then it is time to sit up and take notice of the damage being done to the environment. Nature?s ?miracles? will soon be a thing of the past.

 If the army had helped to make the artificial lingam, then they should be thanked, and not blamed, for helping to keep faith alive. They were only trying to save devotees a great disappointment. 

 Yours faithfully, 

M. Bose, Calcutta 

 Glory restored

 Sir ? It is important to note that a not-so-developed country like Thailand has decided to undertake the massive task of rebuilding the mutilated statues of the Buddha at Bamiyan (?Bamiyan offer?, June 19). Though the US claims to have rescued Afghanistan from the taliban, it has not once proposed any measure to restore the archaeological marvel that was blasted almost to ruins by the taliban. Perhaps this, more than anything else, proves that George W. Bush?s interest was more in flaunting his own power than in returning to the country its lost heritage. 

 The truth that the world is ruled by religious sentiments even today, is established by the fact that a Buddhist nation has proposed to undertake the job of restoring the Bamiyan Buddhas. It seems that even the importance of archaeological treasures has come to be determined today by the religion they are associated with.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur

 Heckled out

 Sir ? Former Indian captain, Dilip Vengsarkar, has expressed his disappointment with the Mumbai crowd after some spectators booed Sachin Tendulkar when the master batsman was dismissed cheaply in the first innings of the final test match against England (?Hometown shock for Sachin?, March 20). However, everyone, including former players like Vengsarkar, should remember that no individual is bigger than the team. It is the duty of every player to perform and try and win matches while playing for the Indian team at the international level. And if a player of even Tendulkar?s class fails, he is bound to face criticism. One also needs to remember that Tendulkar has often silenced his critics with the bat in the face of mounting criticism. Therefore, those who heckled him may have rendered a service to the nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anujit Sarkar, Dhanbad

 Sir ? It was indeed sad that Tendulkar managed to score just one run in his appearance as the mostcapped test player of the country. Tendulkar?s hunger for scoring runs seems to be on the wane. This is borne out by the fact that he has not managed to post a decent score in his last ten test innings. Maybe it would be a good idea if Tendulkar decides to sit out for a couple of games. This will help him stage a successful comeback. Needless to say, Tendulkar is a lion-hearted athlete, and his fans may rest assured that they will get to see him in prime form soon enough. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There have been many a slump with the bat in Tendulkar?s long and illustrious career, more so after his injuries to the back and the elbow. But the present slide in his batting graph, following his thirty-fifth test century, has been alarming. Tendulkar?s shot selection has been poor in recent times. He is either trying too many things at the start of an innings or retreating into a shell. It is apparent that the pressure to perform is telling on him. Moreover, despite playing at the highest level for close to two decades, Tendulkar has never quite managed to plug his weakness against incoming deliveries. Not just that, he also has a serious problem with his hand-to-eye coordination and feet movement. Little wonder then that Tendulkar is now looking jittery while wielding the willow. Perhaps Ramakant Achrekar, Tendulkar?s coach, should be called in to sort out the problems of his favourite disciple.

 Sir ? It is evident that Sachin Tendulkar, the favourite player of millions of cricket lovers all over the world, is now hopelessly out of form. In the first innings in the test match in Mumbai, Tendulkar took 22 minutes and 13 balls to get off the mark, but couldn?t add to his tally of one run. After Tendulkar?s dismissal of the bowling of James Anderson, a section of the crowd jeered him as he was making his way back to the pavilion. 

 Whether Tendulkar deserves to be booed off the field in his home ground is a different matter altogether. What is more important is to identify who is responsible for the current state of affairs in the Indian side. The fault surely lies with the coach, Greg Chappell and the present members of the selection committee. The former skipper, Sourav Ganguly, was dropped even after he played responsibly in both innings in the last test match against Pakistan. But no such action has been taken in the case of Tendulkar who has not managed to get past the fifty-mark for quite some time now. 

 The same can be said of Tendulkar-clone,Virender Sehwag, who has not exactly been in the best of form. He has been inconsistent with the bat, especially in the last few games. Can the selectors please explain why they are following two different policies, one for players like Tendulkar and Sehwag, and the other for the likes of Ganguly? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The spectators at the Wankhede stadium cannot be blamed for having booed at Tendulkar after his cheap dismissal. Tendulkar has often been called the best batsman of his time by experts of the game. But his current form and technique show that the Indian batsman is not doing justice to such fulsome praise. Tendulkar should realize that he is past his prime. Worse, his refusal to call it a day is jeopardizing the careers of many talented youngsters who are waiting in the wings. The team management?s decision to continue with an out-of-form Tendulkar defies all cricketing logic. Someone needs to tell the selectors that Tendulkar has to prove himself in the domestic circuit first, before he is given a chance to play for the national side. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? The reactions of some former cricketers to the booing episode at the Wankhede stadium was baffling. It appeared to be the most logical reaction to another failure from Sachin Tendulkar. The timing and the manner of his dismissal in the first innings were especially disappointing. After all, Tendulkar has been accorded the status of a demi-god in the country by his fans.Therefore, they have every right to give vent to their anger when their icon fails to come good. There is a message in this for Tendulkar. He would be better off planning his retirement now or suffer the ignominious fate that has befallen Sourav Ganguly. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.G. Haksi, Ranchi

 Unfair to the fair sex

 Sir ? I saw two government advertisements on TV recently. One uses children to ask their ?Papas? to pay service tax. Obviously, our government thinks it is unlikely for their mothers to be in a position to pay service tax. The other ad asks mothers to volunteer to supervise the feeding of children in the mid-day meal scheme of schools. Of course, since the fathers are busy in service-tax-generating activities, they cannot. Apart from their gross insensitivity and gender stereotyping, these ads show how little the government is in touch with the reality of the working lives of Indian women; especially the poorer ones whose children are likely to be enrolled in the midday-meal scheme.

 Yours faithfully,

 Vanita Populi, Calcutta

 On target

 Sir ? The Bombay Stock Exchange sensex has been steadily rising in the post-liberalization period. Of late, its rate of growth has been quite remarkable, culminating in the crossing of the psychological 10,000 mark (?Growth cheers to stock stunner?, Feb 8). Now that this milestone has been reached, some sort of public awareness programme should be undertaken by the Union finance ministry, to allow laymen to understand how this phenomenon may affect the different segments of society. Otherwise, most Indians having access to news media but unaware of the basics of the share market will continue to regard the event to be of benefit primarily to the moneyed few.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The sensex has reached an all time high, the foreign exchange kitty is overflowing, the GDP growth rate is expected to be 8.1 instead of the estimated 7.5 per cent. Inflation is under control. Car prices are sure to come down after the budget. All because we have a government steered by an the economist prime minister, Manmohan Singh. Unfortunately, while Singh and his finance minister, P. Chidambaram, do the hard work, the leftists take all the credit by their rabble-rousing tactics. No one is in any doubt that while talking about opposing liberalization in the name of the people, they are actually hand-in-glove with the government?s disinvestment moves. 

 After reading the news of the sensex?s new high, the first person I met was my maidservant . I sought her reaction. She said, ?Dadababu, we are very hard up. Sugar is selling at Rs 22 a kilo, bread has become costlier by one rupee, I have to buy kerosene in the black market at Rs 25 for a litre. Most of the time we don?t get cereals in the ration shop. If this is not enough, we have been evicted from our home of 40 years beside the Dhakuria lakes. Now I have to pay bus-fare to come to work where I would earlier walk.? I gave up and asked the boy who washes my car: ?Do you know car prices are coming down, isn?t it a good news??. He looked at me and said, ?Babu, you pay me Rs 60 per month. With what I earn every month, I can hardly afford one square meal for me and my family. Will my salary increase if cars become cheap?? Good Lord! Pessimists everywhere, I thought. I gave up because I could feel my old migraine coming back. It had disappeared after the new government came in.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The BSE sensex has crossed the 10000-point barrier. Critics say that the sensex is only the index of India?s top 30 companies, and besides, only a small percentage of Indians invest in the share market. But they are wrong. Because a soaring sensex signifies the belief of Indians as well as foreigners in the Indian economy. It also shows the eagerness of investors to put their money in the market. Now that the 10000 peak has been scaled, hopefully the sensex will touch the 15000 mark by the end of 2006.

 Yours faithfully,

Shaghil Bilali, New Delhi

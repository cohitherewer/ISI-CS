 IN ANSWER TO A BURNING QUESTION

 Immolating Women A Global History of Widow Burning from Ancient Times to the Present By J?rg Fisch, Permanent Black, Rs 795

 Neither the tragic heroine of Rammohun Roy, being marched to the raging pyre, nor hapless women in the face of fate?s cruel interference in matrimony form the only subjects of Fisch?s investigation into the ?global? history of ?widow burning?. Fisch?s widows, in fact, appear to be strangely confident creatures, who, he finds, are able to duck ?self-killing? at times by sending concubines to the grave in their own place, order for nobles to be sacrificed at rare times, and, more usually, give a weighed ?consent? to the ritual of sati, though wavering at the time of its execution.

 In this mammoth cross-continental, across-the-ages survey, the focus is not merely on the ?burning? of women, but the wider practice of ?following into death? that takes place, at different points of time, almost everywhere in the world ? in ancient Egypt and ancient Near East, in eastern Europe during the early Middle Ages, in pockets of North, central and South America, extensively in sub-Saharan Africa, in most groups of islands in Oceania, in different forms in both China and Japan, and in a similar vein in India and parts of southeast Asia.

 And the ?attendants? in death are as much men as women. For the idea behind the practice, carried out mostly among the ruling elite and upper classes in its institutional form, is to provide the ?accompanied? to the other world with all the creature comforts his life on earth assured him. Thus animals and slaves are buried, smothered, slaughtered with as much keenness as wives and concubines. If the numbers from within ?known? company or the community proved insufficient, expeditions were organized to bring living men or the heads of dead men. And the barbarity of the practice (the men were left to bleed to death after being cut up) triggers more sympathy in the reader for the hunted than the widows consenting to burn or be buried with their dead husbands.

 Sati in India and Bali, or the more nondescript surrenders of widows in China and Japan, according to Fisch, is the ?individual following into death?, that is borne out of inherent gender inequality in society, where it is the close personal relationship with the dead that decides the choice of the attendant. And it is through the voluntary nature of their act that the women raise the social significance, both of themselves and that of the dead.

 But how voluntary is ?voluntary?? Fisch tries to carefully weigh the matter of ?free choice and coercion?, since he believes that although existing inequalities and structures of power influence actions, following into death is after all a question of free choice. And Fisch suggests that the widow, by consenting to burn with the dead, exercised that choice in a way. By doing so, she almost entered into a pact with society, which in its turn was pledged to see that the ?irrevocable obligation? was carried to its legitimate end. Force or coercion entered the issue only if the widow revoked her decision. For the ?event?, Fisch says, ?was seen as a ritual, complete in itself, and could not be arbitrarily discontinued.? Thus, a struggling widow could be held back with bamboo poles, a fleeing nine-year-old mercilessly hacked when trying to escape the flames. It may be ?incorrect to say that widow burning as an institution was based on force?, but much as Fisch may try to play it down, coercion did play a part in it, and quite majorly.

 The anatomy of the custom in India and the complex politics revolving round it, especially as a cautious colonial administration tried to strike root in a culture it found difficult to comprehend, are discussed threadbare. But in the struggle over the abolition of widow-burning, Fisch?s victors are neither Rammohun and the reformists, whose influence he dismisses as being limited, or the missionaries and pamphleteers nor William Bentinck himself, who is seen as doubly cautious for his immediate experience down south. Fisch insists that ?the contact of civil servants with widow burning? was finally responsible for the abolition. But was this colonial experience and colonial discourse that evolved out of it as simple and homogeneous as Fisch would have us believe?

 Fisch?s alarming simplification is also evident in his holding the Europeanization of the world, the spread of European values in the form of Christianity and in a secularized moral code responsible for the suppression of the custom in large parts of the world. In the post-colonial world, it was the domination of the European views that made ruling groups abide by them. Hence the repeated legislations in independent India to prohibit the intermittent practice that continued. 

 But if the colonial influence had been so total, why did sati persist in modern India? Fisch tries to explain this by way of the modern Indian state?s adopting the same non-committal attitude of the colonial state, of the cult finding religious anchoring and its politicization by the rightwing. Another simplistic reading of the complex workings of the Indian society?

 LETTING GO

 Autonomy has always been a problem in West Bengal, especially when it comes to education. Letting go has never been easy for the state government. Hence educational institutions have to wage their own battles against the State to secure their rights to function independently. So state-aided primary schools run by Christian missionaries will welcome the governments decision to let them recruit their own teachers. It will not be mandatory for them to appoint teachers through the district primary school councils or the School Service Commission. As with the teaching of English at the primary level, there has already been a great deal of insecure and inconsistent dithering on the part of the state regarding the extent of autonomy to be given to missionary schools. The proposed West Bengal School Service Commission Act (Amendment) bill, had it been enacted, would have resulted in a considerable loss of autonomy for these schools. Fortunately, the bill has been withdrawn.

 There are, however, two ways of looking at the issue of the autonomy of missionary schools. First, the governments decision has been hailed by the Bangiya Christiya Pariseba as the restoration of certain minority rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Second, the decision might be regarded less politically that is, less as a matter of rights and more in terms of the maintenance of academic excellence. The argument for autonomy, in the case of educational institutions, must ultimately rest on the question of merit and excellence. Schools and colleges should employ the best available people to teach students in order to maintain their standards, and the criteria should be entirely academic. Both governmental control and minority rights might end up, in their very different ways, creating other kinds of criteria for recruitment that would fail to prioritize merit. West Bengal, especially in the sphere of higher education, is now waking up, at last, to the need for autonomy through the withdrawal of the State from matters of institutional policy, pedagogy and administration. It is therefore important to see this latest decision as a positive step from this point of view rather than foregrounding the more political, rights-oriented dimension, reassuring as the latter ought to be. The State deciding to meddle less with education, at what- ever level, is always a happy development. And this is what seems to have happened with these fortunate schools.

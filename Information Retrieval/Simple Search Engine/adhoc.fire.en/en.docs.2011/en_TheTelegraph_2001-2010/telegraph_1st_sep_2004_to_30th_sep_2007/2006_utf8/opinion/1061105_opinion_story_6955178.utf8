 Letters to Editor

 Bring forth men children only

 Sir The caption with Amitabh Bachchans photograph shows his religious inclinations (Rebirth and a birth wish, Oct 30). His wish for a grandson also shows his susceptibility to the blind beliefs his faith endorses. The preference for a male child is one of these. Bachchan is an icon in India; such blatantly biased comments from him can send wrong signals to an India which is trying hard to cope with an abnormal sex ratio and increasing female foeticide. One can only hope that he corrects his position soon and publicly announces it.

 Yours faithfully,

 Lands no more

 Sir Islands sinking in Sunderbans (Oct 30) is a subject of global concern. India has a rich heritage of wildlife and flora and fauna. Ironically, owing to mans technological pursuits and the extreme climatic changes resulting from it, both wildlife and their habitat are in tremendous danger. Which is why the declining population of big cats in Indias tiger reserves is no longer big news. 

 In the Sunderbans, weather changes have led to increasing salinity, making it difficult for humans as well as animals to survive. At the rate the islands are submerging, it will not be long before the whole of Sunderbans goes under water. The Union and the state governments have to take care of Protected areas together with Protected species. Along with the wildlife authorities, they should see that the remaining islands are protected and they remain fit for human and animal habitation. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It was frightening to know that two islands in the Sunderbans have sunk in the last three decades because of the rising sea level and displaced around 10,000 people. Scientists have reportedly said that a dozen more islands would disappear within the next decade, displacing another 70,000 inhabitants. 

 Certainly, global warming is a problem that has to be addressed by all countries. But even before that is done, the West Bengal government must rehabilitate the displaced population and resettle those who face imminent danger. If the sea level is rising by 3.5 mm per year, it will affect the other coasts of India and may even swallow some parts in the next few decades. This will, in turn, increase the height of rivers during high tide. If the rivers overflow, the entire population of the country will be threatened. West Bengal has already seen some of the worst floods in the last few years. A bigger calamity awaits it within a span of 30 years if immediate steps are not taken to rescue the Sunderbans.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The report, Giant crater puzzle in Kutch (Oct 24), creates more mysteries than it solves. Instances of heavenly bodies hitting the earth, land or sea are numerous. What makes the Luna crater in the Rann of Kutch unique is that it finds a mention in the Rig Veda, signifying that this giant circular depression must have preceded the Aryan civilization. Since the heavenly charcoal was absorbed by mud and marsh, it is quite natural that the shallow crater left in the Rann will not resemble the one amid the hard rocks at Lonar in Maharastra. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of the tektites found in Kutch are bound to differ, given the different nature of their impact. But the only proof of the event scientists seem to have till now is the mention of a meteorite impact in the tenth book of the Rig Veda. It is surprising that we still need Sanskrit texts to authenticate a scientific phenomenon in this age of technology.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

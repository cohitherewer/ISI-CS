 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE

 There has been no organized effort on the part of the government of India to restrict the spread of avian flu in the country, writes Saheli Mitra

 Killing fields

 They seemed like astronauts, their sterilized blue outfits and gas masks in place, who had suddenly landed over a taluka in a remote part of Maharashtra. Veterinary officials, sent to Nawapur to cull poultry feared to be infected with the deadly bird flu virus, certainly impressed onlookers in their hip-hop outfits. But are such photographs, splashed on newspapers across the country and flashed on news channels, enough to stop the avian influenza virus from making inroads into one of the most populous nations of the world? Guess not. Fresh outbreaks spreading from Nawapur to Jalgaon, and suspected outbreaks in other parts of Maharashtra and even tribal belts of Madhya Pradesh, show that the government?s tall claims have done little to contain the virus. And now with the avian flu virus showing signs of mutation, scientists believe that chances of the virus triggering a human pandemic is on the cards. But what about India? Doesn?t the ground reality here reflect a frustrating lack of an organized approach to stop the virus from spreading? 

 One does not doubt the government?s efforts at culling suspected stocks in poultry farms in and around Nawapur and its claim to track other outbreaks in the country. But a closer look will reveal a lot of loose ends that need to be taken care of immediately.

 First, the authorities seem to have no intention of tracing the source of the bird flu virus and how it suddenly affected poultry in a remote part of Maharashtra. If the virus hopped from migratory birds that crowd water bodies in India during winter, there was none to keep a tab on these birds when they came in. World Health Organization reports suggest that countries like India were warned repeatedly of the vulnerability of poultry farms close to water bodies frequented by migratory birds. Even a suggestion was made by the industry last November that poultry farms around water bodies be vaccinated, but the government did not bother. Despite knowing that most of the migratory flocks arrive from central Asia via China, where bird flu deaths have been on the rise over the past couple of years, nothing was done to detect if the flocks were carrying the virus or were dying of it.

 Second, animal husbandry officials claim that they have not sighted any dead wild bird in and around the farms infected. But by dead birds they mean ?large scale deaths?. Perhaps they are unaware that the death of a single swan in a lake in France had prompted the French government to carry out a test, which proved positive for H5N1. There is no rule that like poultry, wild birds will die in hordes when affected by the virus. In several instances, they have been carriers rather than victims. Months back, reports of dhabas along Delhi-Himachal Pradesh highway selling the meat of migratory birds as chicken were also never looked into. 

 The government is equally ignorant of the areas where suspect poultry from Nawapur could have made their way into. Birds were dying in Nawapur since January 20, but the government came to know of it only in the first week of February. Even after getting to know of suspected cases, it took another 96 hours for the officials to confirm that bird flu has finally arrived in India. The WHO points out that countries like France and Bulgaria took just a couple of days to swing into action after such cases were detected. In India, there was enough time for the transmission of the virus from one farm to another and even for the exposure of farm labourers to the infection. Same with Jalgaon, where the authorities showed great reluctance to contain the virus from spreading via the backyard poultry, a risk that was pointed out long back by the WHO. 

 Till date there is no confirmed information of where the Nawapur poultry were sent either as livestock or as poultry meat and eggs. Farm owners too are equally responsible for the delay as many of them tried to downplay the outbreak and even contested reports of the Bhopal laboratory. The chairperson of the National Egg Co-ordination Committee claimed that the poultry had died from Ranikhet disease and not bird flu. The reaction of farm owners was not surprising. A blow to the Rs 28,000 crore poultry industry would leave many penniless. Most of the small farms are not insured and there are several backyard poultry farms owned by small time farmers who are not aware of how to react to such a situation. To them, the government?s compensation of Rs 40 per bird culled might prove insufficient.

 Officials were sent to kill around 9 lakh birds in Nawapur, they killed only 2 lakh and have no clue as to where the rest have gone. This dismal picture itself is enough proof of the reckless manner in which the situation is being managed. The birds may have been killed by farm workers themselves, employing methods that are not foolproof, or worse, they may have been smuggled out of the farms. 

 Third, comes the risk to poor farm labourers in the affected areas. None of them have received the triple-layered gas mask or goggles prescribed by the WHO. The labourers are neither aware of the risk nor do they have means to protect themselves from the infection. Even those travelling down the Nawapur highway are at risk of airborne transmission as the farms are close to the highway. The wild birds in sanctuaries and other domesticated birds are also being overlooked. In fact, conservationists believe that migratory birds have been made scapegoats. It is much easier for poultry to have passed on the virus to wild birds. No steps have been taken to monitor the bird sanctuaries in India.

 Last, but not the least, why did not we try to develop a vaccine to be given to poultry in advance? Now that bird flu has arrived, the government says it has a million doses of vaccine imported for emergency use and will import more if required. But why are the authorities reluctant in allowing domestic manufacturers to develop low cost vaccines? It is government intervention that can save us from a health hazard. And yet, it seems more interested in politics and personal interests.

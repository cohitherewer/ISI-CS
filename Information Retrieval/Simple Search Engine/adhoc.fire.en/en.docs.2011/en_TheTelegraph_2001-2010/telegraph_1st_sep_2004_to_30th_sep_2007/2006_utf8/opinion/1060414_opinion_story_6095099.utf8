 NOSES UP IN THE AIR

 Malvika Singh

 The UPA government at the Centre has one thing to learn from the NDA, particularly the BJP. When they were ruling they had a set of critical and key bureaucrats committed to the then prime minister and his intentions. They were men and women who were ?for? and not silently ?against? their bosses. Today, in the present dispensation, some of those earlier ?loyalists? continue to hold key positions and are carrying forward the agenda of the past regime by the usual tricks of saying one thing and doing another. 

 The grapevine is replete with myriad incidents that reveal this sad reality, sad for the ruling coalition, particularly the Congress. And, the Congress, in their nose-up-in-the-air fashion, is oblivious of the quiet ?sabotage? that is happening under its nose. Some are brazen and wave letters about to prove their point when trying to spread stories. Others are like sieves, leaking information that serves the purpose of their personal stands on various issues. For those voyeurs watching this spectacle from outside, it is both disturbing and comical.

 It is disturbing because it is anti-national to manipulate the intentions and ideology of the incumbent political leader. It makes the ruling party appear chaotic and confused. Bureaucrats are known to play politics, keep truths away, hide some, expose others, create patterns that keep them in control. Hectic lobbying happens everywhere, even in some Delhi and Bombay living-rooms. Rules and policies are altered to meet the needs of those lobbyists who have more access than others. This game has intensified over the years and seems to be at a high point today. What it implies is that the political leaders have abdicated the controls of the government to babus who seem to be accountable only to themselves, and for themselves.

 For the babus

 The prime minister recently talked about the need for ?discussion? and ?consensus?, not polarised debate. He made this appeal to the media. Maybe he needs to address his administrators first. They are the ones who keep out points for discussion on various agendas that are serviced to the ministries by experts and ?outsiders? because the bureaucrat does not want discussion and consensus. He wants his agenda to go through without discussion. He has been so used to administering dictatorially, assuming his is the last word on every issue, a carry-over of colonial practices. The PM should take his salutary idea to his secretariat and then to all the ministries in the Central government and begin to force discussion and consensus. The press will have to follow. It cannot work the other way around. 

 Indians are looking to see the endless platitudes transform into realities on the ground. They do not want to know how difficult it may be to do something, but want to see it done. Here are some examples of the failure of governance, social stability, and law and order in the capital city. Drunken driving that mows down innocent citizens continues unabated. Nowhere in the world is it as rampant and commonplace as in New Delhi. Killers of men and women run amok, showing their muscle and oozing bravado as they strut the streets threatening all those who cross their path. More often than not, they hang about political leaders of all colour and description. The police know them and their identities. Is the authority running scared of these mafiosi or has it been co-opted by them?

 Is it not time to rectify the colonial laws that govern us long after we ceased to be a colony? Or do elected governments find it easier to rule with the strong-arm tactics used by colonizers when administering countries and cultures that they invade? The political class has been ?lucky? so far because Indians, by and large feudal in mindset, have not revol- ted against present-day exploitation.

 Letters to Editor

 Barren ground

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee recently accused the state?s agriculture universities of not doing enough research (?Buddha taunt at scientists?, Feb 1). He revealed how other states had left West Bengal behind in the production of oil seeds, eggs, fish and other agricultural products. But shouldn?t our well-informed chief minister also have been aware of the debilitating impact of the left ?work culture? on all things perishable in the state, including our scientists? If he wants them to be productive, then the atmosphere should be made conducive to growth.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Down and out

 Sir ? There is no need to feel humiliated by India?s defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the third and final test match at Karachi (?India in third spot after series loss?, Feb 3). The result was expected because Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid have only succeeded in politicizing the team. The manner in which Chappell changed and chopped the side to keep Sourav Ganguly out of the side was shocking.

 In India, cricketers play the game for the sake of personal glory and money. Take the case of India?s top cricketer, Sachin Tendulkar. He has failed to win any of the big matches for India, be it the World cup final or the test series against Pakistan. He may have won games against Bangladesh, Zimbabwe and Kenya but whether Indian cricket benefited by these innings is the big question. Why is then Tendulkar not told to perform or perish? This is only because Chappell, the shrewd man that he is, knows that sacking Tendulkar may cost him his job. The chief of the selection committee, Kiran More, and the Indian coach need to examine whether this is the best way to prepare for the World Cup in the West Indies. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The loss to Pakistan has exposed a few unsavoury facts. First, it has shown that Greg Chappell?s innovations work wonders only against weaker sides. Second, India?s much-vaunted batting line up, which includes the likes of Tendulkar, Dravid, Sehwag and Laxman, fail to come good on a true wicket. Finally, both Chappell and Dravid must take the blame for vitiating the dressing room atmosphere with their one-point agenda of humiliating Ganguly, so much so that it has dented the team spirit. Ganguly was dropped for the second test even though he did not get a chance to bat during the first test at Lahore. Worse, the former captain, despite his phenomenal record in onedayers, was dropped for the matches against Pakistan. The BCCI should ensure that selection to the team is not based on personal likes or dislikes to save Indian cricket from further trouble. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? Both Indian batsmen and bowlers should take the blame for the loss against Pakistan. While frontline batsmen like Tendulkar failed with the bat, Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble were rendered ineffective on the placid tracks. Pakistan was also lucky to have two phenomenal batsmen in Afridi and Akmal who pulverised the Indian attack. After the test matches, watching the rivals lock horns in the one-dayers should be equally exciting.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 nSir ? From a dream start that saw Pakistan lose six wickets for 39 runs on the first morning, to crashing to a shocking 341 runs defeat with a day to spare is astounding. The causes are not far to seek ? the lack of killer instinct, uninspiring captaincy and the unwillingness of old legends to make space for the young guns.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

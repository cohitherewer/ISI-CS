 MONEY PAWAR 

 - If Pawar had his way, hed get companies to brand the teams shoelaces

 Sharad Pawar is outgunning Jagmohan Dalmiya as the new BCCI team launches an unprecedented drive to raise revenue, report Debashis Bhattacharyya and Shuchi Bansal

 GAME POINT: Sharad 

 Pawar (top) and Jagmohan Dalmiya 

 Its no secret that Jagmohan Dalmiya, the former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), was virtually a money-making machine and was credited with transforming the game with his business vision. During his one-and-a-half decade stint at BCCI as president, treasurer and secretary, Dalmiya helped rake in substantial sums of cash for the cricket body. But theres a new mint in town ? and hes outgunning Dalmiya all the way. The man in question: Union agriculture minister and BCCIs newly elected president Sharad Pawar. 

 Over the last few weeks, Pawar and his team, including BCCI vice-president Lalit Kumar Modi, have been busy chalking out new marketing strategies. Cock an eye at BCCIs following plans. 

 For starters, the telecast rights for Indian cricket ? after the ongoing India-Pakistan series ? are up for grabs and Modi says he expects to raise at least Rs 1,000 crore from them any day now. Vying for the satellite TV rights will be channels such as ESPN-Star Sports, Ten Sports and Zee Sports. To maximise revenue, however, for the first time BCCI plans to split the rights among different delivery platforms: it will hawk them separately to channels on satellite cable as well as those on the direct-to-home (DTH) platform. 

 In fact, news channels that liberally borrowed match highlights from broadcasters till recently will now have to deal directly with BCCI. The board has made its intention clear. As the original content owner, it reserves the right to sell match highlights to news channels. The rights are the property of BCCI and only BCCI is authorised to license or sub-license them. By signing direct contracts with the news channels, the board will eliminate the need for middlemen, observes Lalit Modi. Aaj Tak executive director G. Krishnan, however, says that since pre-and post-match coverage and analysis by news channels also help in promoting an ongoing series, BCCI must provide news clips in lieu of credit. 

 Meanwhile, BCCI is also training its guns at private FM radio. BCCI will seek separate bids for FM and satellite radio. 

 With 57 million cellphone subscribers in India, BCCI is, not surprisingly, eyeing income from mobile phones as well. The board will tap the power of mobile telephony. The revenue from multi-media services (MMS), short messaging service (SMS) and video imagery on mobile phones is growing exponentially, says the BCCI vice-president, adding that DVDs, VCDs and CD ROMs are the new revenue generating opportunities that BCCI may exploit. 

 The broadband rights will also be sold separately and made available on a revenue sharing basis. Additionally, BCCI plans to set up its own portal to generate revenue from live matches, archival footage, interviews and merchandise. 

 Talking of merchandise, the cash-rich BCCI (with Rs 286.32 crore in bank fixed deposits, savings and current accounts, and another Rs 12 crore in cash) wants to model itself on Manchester United, confides a BCCI official. The soccer giant conducts joint promotional activities with other brands such as Vodafone and sells its merchandise through its website. However, unlike Manchester United which is listed, BCCI is a non-profit body and its income must be ploughed back into the game. Yet licensed merchandising is on the cards, with plans to create apparel, accessories and cricket equipment based on the calendar of events. 

 All this, of course, will top the mind-boggling deals BCCI has already sewn up. For a price of Rs 415 crore, BCCI has signed up Air Sahara, the Sahara group airline, for sponsoring the Indian cricket team. For another Rs 196.66 crore, BCCI has appointed Nike, the sports shoes and apparel brand, to be the teams official kit supplier. The board is now looking to appointing an official time keeper, official hotel and official airline. 

 The attempts to milk cricket commercially stems from the BCCI top brasss belief that the cricket body has, so far, been greatly undersold. Its quite evident from the last three deals alone, points out Modi. BCCI earned Rs 19.58 crore from the satellite rights alone for the Sri Lanka-India series while Modis predecessors forgot to sell the rights for four earlier series, resulting in a loss of income of about Rs 300 crore, he says. The team sponsorship was last sold for Rs 78 crore four years ago, and the official kit contract fetched BCCI a mere Rs 8 crore. I dont need to elaborate, smirks Modi. 

 When contacted, Dalmiya refused to be drawn into the issue. However, a close associate of his was livid. The present board is indulging in gimmicks and a jugglery of figures, he says. The market prices for team sponsorship have increased manifold in the last four years. It is only natural that these rights will fetch more money today. 

 Television rights, he stresses, could not be sold in 2004 as the BCCI was then embroiled in court cases. As far as TV rights go, we wanted quality coverage reaching the maximum number of people. We did not want to make money at the cost of cricket, he adds. 

 Thats why, perhaps, the overwhelming commercialisation of cricket by Pawar is already inviting flak. They are talking only money. They are bringing in a mandi culture into cricket, says a Dalmiya aide. The Mumbai-based head of a TV channel agrees. Sharad Pawar is scaling up the game and making it even more commercial. If he had his way, he would get companies to brand even the shoelaces of the team. 

 WHAT DALMIYA 

 DID 

 BCCI was 

 in the red when Jagmohan Dalmiya joined. Together 

 with I.S. Bindra, he decided to raise money by 

 marketing cricket.

 Opportunity came knocking when international 

 sports production company TWI asked BCCI for the 

 telecast rights of the India-England series in 

 1993. Doordarshan then had a stranglehold on all 

 cricket rights. Dalmiya sold the rights to TWI 

 for Rs 18 lakh. In 1996 BCCI sold the World Cup 

 rights for $10 million. 

 Dalmiya is credited with exploiting the 

 TV rights opportunity, starting the concept of 

 team sponsorship and attracting advertisers to 

 the game. He turned BCCI around and made it profitable.

 PAWAR PLAY 

 WHAT BCCI WILL DO

 BCCI hopes 

 to garner Rs 1,000 crore from telecast rights 

 for television. 

 The satellite TV rights, DTH, 

 Internet and mobile telephony rights will be hawked 

 separately. 

 For any match clips they use, news channels 

 will be asked to pay money directly to BCCI. 

 BCCI will set up its own portal which will 

 offer live matches, archival footage, memorabilia 

 and merchandise. 

 The board plans to foray into licensed 

 merchandising created for specific events. This 

 could include apparel, accessories and cricket 

 equipment.

 WHAT PAWAR HAS 

 DONE SO FAR

 BCCI has come 

 up with a vision document that chalks out its 

 initiatives to improve the game and raise more 

 money. 

 To maximise value, the board has identified 

 different sponsors for the Champions Trophy and 

 the World Cup to avoid conflict of interest with 

 companies that may have contracts with the International 

 Cricket Council. 

 BCCI has already sold the Indian team sponsorship 

 rights to the Sahara Group for Rs 415 crore 

 Nike has been appointed the official kit 

 supplier for a price of Rs 196.66 crore.

 BCCI has appointed TCS to help it professionalise 

 the cricket body.

Yet despite murmurs about exorbitant sponsorship and advertising rates, companies in India are nowhere near boycotting the game. On the contrary, they are spending huge sums on sponsorships ? on ground and on air, spot buys and other branding opportunities. To be sure, for the Indo-Pak series on Ten Sports, the going rate for a 10-second commercial is Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. 

 For the last few series the rates have gone up exponentially, says Gautam Rajgopal, buying head (all India) at Mudras media buying company OMS. I find them cost ineffective. He admits that cricket has a high viewership, yet the quantity does not justify the rates. 

 The sponsorship bids underline the fact that cricket is big business. Not only did Sahara commit to invest Rs 415 crore, the other bidders also upped the ante. The second highest bidder for the team sponsorship was Idea Cellular at Rs 286.13 crore, followed by Reliance Infocomm at Rs 257.4 crore. IOC and Airtel were also in the race with bid amounts of over Rs 250 crore. Explains events management company Percept DMarks joint managing director Shailendra Singh, who brokered the deal for Sahara: In an era when consumer markets (in terms of products or consumer demographics) and media opportunities (cinema, outdoor, entertainment TV, radio) are extremely fragmented, cricket, perhaps, remains the only consolidating factor across consumers and audiences. And it makes business sense for both sponsors and broadcasters to buy cricket. 

 Clearly, in the 61 million-strong cable and satellite market, only cricket can rival the television rating points delivered by popular soaps. Adds Manish Porwal, executive director at the media buying company Starcom Worldwide: Cricket is an ideal launch vehicle for a new brand or campaign when you want a build-up in a short time.

 Small wonder then, that companies in India spend between Rs 400 crore and Rs 480 crore a year on commercials during cricket matches and programmes. Another 50 per cent of this sum is spent on ground and on endorsements per year with another 30 to 35 per cent on other media but with Indian cricket and its stars in the foreground, says Porwal. In fact, brands such as LG, Samsung, Hero Honda and Pepsi that bet on cricket, spend between 15 and 30 per cent of their total advertising budgets on the game. 

 Cricket is a religion in this country and most sponsorships/buys are based on passion rather than real return for money. It is a statement you make with the brand association, feels Raj Nayak, chief executive office, NDTV Media, and former marketing head of Star Sports. Remarks Porwal: In the current situation, cricket is highly overrated on perception versus the cost. However, he still expects a compounded annual growth rate of 11 to 15 per cent for the next three years on cricket advertising. 

 In 2004, television channels had quoted up to Rs 1,400 crore for the telecast rights for four years of Indian cricket. Values will be determined by the tours BCCI fixes. If it is based on the present schedule, there should be no price escalation, says Percepts Singh. Indeed, several other TV channel executives feel that splitting rights for different media may also bring down cricket valuations. 

 For his part, though, Modi insists that the board is looking beyond the commercial angle. BCCI has put out a vision document on its plans. From an individually driven outfit to a team working for the betterment of cricket, there has been significant progress. The focus, as I said, is back on the game, he says. 

 BCCIs new chief has appointed Tata Consultancy Services to professionalise the board. Its report is expected shortly. In fact, the vision document spells out a road map to improve the standard and facilities for domestic cricket, an area Dalmiya was accused of neglecting. 

 The plan is to appoint a CEO to run the board in a professional manner. BCCI also plans to help state associations find sponsors for their teams and take up issues related to infrastructure development such as grounds and stadiums with state governments. To improve the status of domestic cricket, it will be mandatory for international cricketers to play the Duleep Trophy, Irani Cup and the Challenger series. Revising BCCIs 75- year-old constitution in line with the requirements of modern cricket is also on the cards. 

 Predictably, the Dalmiya camp says that Pawars marketing initiatives are all hogwash. It is a cheap publicity stunt. All the marketing initiatives were started by the previous regime, says former BCCI secretary S.K. Nair. Kunal Ghosh, a Dalmiya aide and cricket operations manager in the previous board, says that Dalmiya turned around the finances of the board and made it profitable. When he resigned as president of the board in 2004, BCCI had a surplus of Rs 40 crore. 

 From all indications, this match has just begun and it will be sometime before the winner is announced.

 Road to the Siwaliks

 In my youth, the road I most often travelled ran between New Delhi, the capital of India, and Dehradun, the town where I was born and raised. The distance was exactly 150 miles, this divided into four very symmetrical segments. It was 40 miles from Dehradun to the town of Roorkee; then 35 miles to Muzaffarnagar; another 35 to Meerut; and finally, 40 miles from there to Delhi.

 Between the ages of ten and twenty-five, I must have travelled that road half-a-dozen times a year. Whichever way I went, the journey never failed to thrill me. To get to Delhi was, after all, to leave the locality for the wider world beyond. It was in Delhi that I went to university and opened my mind; and it was from Delhi that I took trains to the other great cities of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. But to go back to Dehradun was no less pleasurable. Between Delhi and Roorkee, the terrain was as flat as the palm of one?s hand; although it got progressively greener, as one entered the lands watered by the Ganga and Jamuna canals. For a hundred odd miles one sat calmly, but as we began the home stretch the heart began to beat a little more quickly. From Roorkee the road ran to the hamlet of Chutmalpur, there to turn right and head for the hills. The Siwaliks appeared, greyish-blue and low on the horizon. Then one left the fields and entered a fine sal forest. At the village of Mohund we began to climb, up and over the Siwaliks into the gorgeous valley beyond. At the top of the Mohund Pass lay a little temple, the only shrine in all of India before which this agnostic would allow himself a little prayer, thanking the devi for allowing him one more sight of the promised land.

 My parents left Dehradun in 1984, to return to their roots in the South. I have since gone back once or twice a year, but mostly by overnight train. My last drive along that well-loved road had been sometime in the early Nineties. Last month, however, when the chance came to visit the Doon, I chose to hire a taxi rather than take the train.

 In the 15 years since I had last driven to Dehradun, India had changed dramatically, these changes reflected, sometimes subtly and at other times starkly, in the landscape we were to pass through. The first new landmark, just after we crossed the Jamuna at the Nizammudin Bridge, was the Akshardham temple, a single complex containing many structures in various stages of repair and renovation. As we drove on, we encountered other such signs of religiosity; several temples newly painted, a truck made into a chariot blaring devotional music just short of Meerut, then a railway crossing with a dhaba on either side, these named ?Jai Shiv Hotel? and ?Om Hotel? respectively.

 In northern India, a louder and more aggressive Hinduism is one manifestation of a new identity politics. A second, and usually opposed, manifestation is a louder and more aggressive proclamation of one?s caste. The town of Modinagar had a big red building that had come up since I was last there: it was called (in Hindi) ?Gujar Market?. In the past, such structures would have taken the name of a nationalist icon; now, they simply took on the name of a locally powerful caste. In this region, the Gujars jostle for dominance with the Jats, whose own sense of honour and pride is reflected in the new name of the old Meerut University, now called Choudhary Charan Singh University, to remember the Jat peasant leader who, very briefly, served as prime minister of India.

 As parties based on caste and religion have gained ground in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has lost out. To arrest what could otherwise become a terminal decline, the Grand Old Party has said it shall henceforth present itself as the party of the young. Between Meerut and Muzaffarnagar, I saw several posters put up by a Congress candidate for a forthcoming by-election. These had portraits of five people ? the candidate himself and, watching indulgently over him, Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. There was no space here for Mahatma Gandhi, for Jawaharlal Nehru and ? most remarkable of all ? for Indira Gandhi.

 The first 30 miles out of Delhi were all urban sprawl: houses and shops and apartments of people who live off the wealth of the capital itself. Then the countryside took over; sugarcane, and then more sugarcane, as far as the eye could see. This was as I knew it; the farmers of western UP have always favoured this crop, not least because the canals gave them the water to grow it. What was new, however, were the advertisements on the walls of farmhouses, many of them of a single brand ? Airtel. Among the 80 million mobile phone users in India there are, of course, many farmers ? besides, the owners of Airtel are from Meerut themselves.

 I stopped for breakfast at the Cheetal Restaurant, near Muzaffarnagar. When I first knew it, this was a modest shack by the canal, serving aloo tikiya and bread-butter-toast; now it is an opulent hotel, with fountains in the garden and imported chocolates on sale inside. After Muzaffarnagar, it became clearer that there were not just Hindus who dwelt in this land. There were signs indicating the branch roads to Deoband and Najibabad, and plenty of Muslims on this road itself ? on bicycles, on bullock carts, rarely, on a motor-bike.

 After Roorkee I sat up, and began observing the road more closely. I saw that an old milestone at the Chutmalpur junction had been taken down (or stolen); but noticed, to my relief, that the old inspection bungalow in Biharigarh still stood. The sal forests short of the Siwaliks were still fairly verdant. At Mohund itself I saw a group of Van Gujars at a wayside restaurant, drinking tea. This, too, was a relief; for I had heard that these vegetarian Muslims who herded buffaloes for a living had been turfed out of the forest. As we climbed, we passed more Gujars, this time on bicycles, milk cans strapped onto their sides.

 At the top of the hill I offered my prayer, and then braced myself for the drive downhill into the valley. One major change since I was last here was that what was one state was now two. For the first forty years of my life, Dehradun was a district town in UP; since 1998 it has become the capital of the state of Uttaranchal. The most dramatic consequence of this new status is a surge in the Valley?s population. In the past, between the Siwaliks and the town, lay the fabled rice fields of Majra, where grew the world?s best Basmati. Now, those fields had gone; in their stead were Ford and Chevrolet showrooms.

 One of my favourite historians, Marc Bloch, liked to tell his students that apart from fatter notebooks they also needed thicker boots. I would have certainly seen more and learnt more if I had walked all the way from Delhi to Dehradun. But summer was upon us, and I am middle-aged and overweight in any case. However, even from the window of a speeding car I saw a great deal, enough to confirm the truth of Bloch?s dictum. For while the written record is sometimes very revealing, changes in the land are imprinted most decisively on the land itself.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DAY OF CHOICE

 It used to be said at one time that the Left Front ruled West Bengal without controlling the capital of the state. This observation had some basis in fact because successive election results had shown that the left, in electoral terms, had very little support in Calcutta. The city remained a non-left bastion. A change in the situation became evident from the results of the last Lok Sabha election in 2004 and the results of the election of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 2005. It was clear from the Lok Sabha polls that in most of the assembly segments of the city?s parliamentary constituencies, the left had secured majority of the votes. This result was strengthened when the left won the KMC hustings. It is in this context that today?s voting in the city of Calcutta acquires a certain importance. Will the left improve upon the lead it established in 2004? Or will Calcutta revert to its position of being an anti-left island surrounded by an ocean of left voters? 

 Behind these questions lurks another question of even greater significance for West Bengal. The principal plank of the left?s election campaign in this election is the new industrial policy of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The left, especially the Communist Party of India (Marxist) can no longer be seen as a political force that is hostile to capital and investment. Quite the contrary. This should remove what has been the chief grouse of Calcutta?s middle and upper middle classes against the left. It should also placate the fears of the city?s urban poor and working class that the left is not creating avenues of urban employment. Through his entire term as chief minister, Mr Bhattacharjee has worked assiduously to make his government investor-friendly. West Bengal stands poised to embark on an industrial revival. It remains to be seen if Mr Bhattacharjee?s economic reform programme will receive an endorsement from the voters of Calcutta. Economic reforms have never been a vote winner. Calcutta can prove or disprove this generalization. Today?s elections may well be the litmus test for Mr Bhattacharjee?s policies. The latter cannot be separated from Mr Bhattacharjee?s personality and utterances. He has been honest enough to admit the past mistakes of his party, and has openly declared his commitment to break free of the past and to take West Bengal forward. It is upto the people of Calcutta to make a choice today.

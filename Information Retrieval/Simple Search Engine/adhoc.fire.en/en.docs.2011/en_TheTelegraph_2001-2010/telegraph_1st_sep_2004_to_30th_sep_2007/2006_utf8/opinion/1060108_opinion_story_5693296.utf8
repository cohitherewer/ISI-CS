 DIARY

 The Congress might be staging its own Mahabharata, but that is unlikely to undo the nation?s continuing fascination with the BJP?s Ram lila. Perhaps even the Congresswallahs know that (and may even be working feverishly at their own calculations), which is why there has been no major histrionics over the changes in the CWC. Meanwhile, days after the BJP concluded its silver jubilee celebrations in Mumbai, it has been the favourite pastime of the man on the street to try guessing which role in the Ramayana has been assigned to which saffronite. He invariably starts off with the hints already provided ? there is AB Vajpayee as Parashuram, LK Advani as Ram, Pramod Mahajan as Laxman. Rajnath Singh is the obvious Bharat, M Venkaiah Naidu Hanuman and Uma Bharti, undeniably, Surpanakha. Who then is Sita?

 Much as Vajpayee would dislike it, the actors in the play he seems to have so carefully scripted for the party already seem to be straying from the script. So instead of AB?s repeated reminders that Advani was there to ?guide? the new party president, it is Pramod Mahajan who seems to have usurped that role. On the day of Rajnath?s coronation, when he was asked when he would announce his new team, Singh turned to Pramod to provide him the answer. And he did. Pramod also seems to have coached Rajnath for his encounter with Ram, sorry, Advani. How would he reciprocate the offer of laddoos, of garlands? How will he run the party? Pramod, help!

 While the CPI(M) mulls over didi?s arrest, we have our thoughts going out for the ?arresting? looks of another ? Madan Mitra, who (with Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Subrata Mukherjee out of the way), styles himself as Mamata?s ?minder? (our heart goes out for his mind as well). Since Mitra, thanks to didi, is constantly in the limelight (squeezing into the view of television cameras and staging press meets), he had been advised, we are told, to pay some attention to his looks as well. That apparently inspired him to get himself a glistening, eye-catching, red punjabi, that is now his bane. Some spoilsports have advised Mamata to read into Madan?s choice of colour his political preferences also. Last heard, Mitra was still trying to find a way to dispose of his punjabi. 

 A couple of months ago, the PM had agreed to release Raghu Rai?s collection of photographs of Indira Gandhi. Invitation cards for the event to be held on the Race Course Road complex were sent out to the capital?s who?s who. Even a select group of people closely associated with Mrs Gandhi had agreed to be present. Two days before the function, the PMO, quite inexplicably, pleaded the PM?s inability to release the book for some last minute changes in schedule and promised that fresh dates would be announced. That was three months back. Rai, a favourite of Indira, still hasn?t heard from the PMO. Has Mrs G fallen from favour of the dispensation or Rai?

 India International Centre is back to work. The capital?s most happening place after 10, Janpath, was under a veritable siege ever since the management invited applications for admitting new members. Nearly 7,000 forms, each priced at Rs 200, were sold although the managing committee intends to admit only a hundred new entrants. Before the last day for submitting applications, total strangers were seen hovering around, looking for regular members to propose or second their nomination for membership. For IIC regulars, the procedure has been irksome. They want it the old way, whereby the IIC itself would shortlist potential members and invite them to fill in the application forms. 

 If you thought babudom was coming to an end, look at the heavy industries ministry, where, despite the heavyweight Santosh Mohan Dev, it is Surajit Mitra who apparently calls the shots. It was Ram Naik, then petroleum minister, who brought Mitra into prominence as his joint-sec, only to remove him within two years. Mitra, it is said, sought the help of a powerful bureaucrat in the Vajpayee?s PMO who got him posted in the department of development of the North-east. When there was a vacancy in heavy industries, Dev, also from Assam, sought him out. Three postings in a five-year term. For someone who could manage that, heavy industries is a cakewalk. Right?

 If its not a piece of land that you want, but merely some information, you?re likely to find Abdur Rezzaq Mollah, Bengal?s land and land reforms minister, disarmingly charming, as some scribes interviewing him about the impending elections just did. Mollah said the party would try its best to win, but the rest was ?up to god?. What? That wouldn?t go down well with the Marxists of Alimuddin Street, and Mollah knows it. But he insists that he is a believer. And, in a further no-holds-barred confession, Mollah went on to add that the other person he worshipped was his wife, who had put up with a terrible husband without ever attempting to poison him. If this isn?t proof of Rezzaq?s simplicity, there?s another. When the Sourav Ganguly controversy was at its peak, Mollah had asked advise from scribes on what position he should take. He had a condition though. It should garner him some votes. All for the party, god willing.

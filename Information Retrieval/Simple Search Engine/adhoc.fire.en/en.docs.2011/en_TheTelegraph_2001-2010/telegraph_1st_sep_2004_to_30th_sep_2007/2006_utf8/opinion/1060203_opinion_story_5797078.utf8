The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOST CAUSE

 Calcutta has lived up to its reputation as the city of left luggage. Its protests against the modernization of the airports in Delhi and Mumbai should set at rest any hope about the leopard changing its spots. In no other city, where similar protests took place, did the agitated airport employees take such cynical delight in stalling flights and harassing passengers as the comrades did in Calcutta. Such cynicism is known to be part of the left?s political culture. But the siege at Calcutta airport sends out disturbing signals. These are times of change. There is a growing consensus among policy-makers that only drastic changes can usher in the kind of economic growth that is necessary to reduce poverty. But the left?s resistance to change can slow down the pace of the country?s economic regeneration. Its opposition to the role of the private sector in the modernization of airports is rooted in its ideological fallacies about the virtues of the public sector. 

 The left?s show of strength at Calcutta airport must have come as a big embarrassment for Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. No wonder he was anxious to see the airport return to normal work. One such ugly display of union power can destroy weeks and months of work that he does in order to present a different image of Bengal. He has succeeded in earning the confidence of potential investors in Bengal. But what his party or its trade union does is also a burden he has to carry. It would not help Bengal?s cause if he is seen as a reformist chief minister constantly at war with his anti-reform party. The longer the left is locked in the past, the more uncertain Bengal?s future will be. For, there is no way the left can win this battle against modernity. The Bengal comrades? fight against computerization in the Eighties proved it beyond doubt. The sale of the Great Eastern Hotel to a private owner suggested that Bengal under Mr Bhattacharjee was also changing. But leftists seem to love lost causes too much.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PAUSE AND POISE

 It took scarcely a week for the euphoria that propelled the sensitive index to new highs to be replaced by bleak despair. Markets always overshoot, and the Indian market, in particular, had run up too far too fast. But it is far from being the only market gripped by panic. While the MSCI India index has fallen by 7.5 per cent this month, the commodity-heavy MSCI Russia index is down 11.7 per cent and some of the Latin American markets have had far worse falls. Nevertheless, the Indian market is one of the worst affected, simply because it was also among the most overvalued. Nor is it only the equity markets that have been hurt ? the commodity markets have also plunged sharply, with steep falls in copper and aluminium. The fact of the matter is that global markets across asset classes are all interconnected and a fall in any one market is rapidly passed on to the others. The trigger this time has been concerns about inflation and higher interest rates, which have led to fears that the global liquidity bubble is about to burst. The worry is that as interest rates go up, the ?carry trade? ? borrowing in cheap currencies such as the yen to fund asset buying ? will unwind, leading to lower asset prices. This is not the first time that these fears have surfaced in the course of this three-year bull run. Global equity markets have had periods of intense self-doubt in May 2004, March 2005 and October 2005 only to bounce back again. The question is: is it different this time? 

 The bull run in the Indian markets has been part and parcel of the surge in global liquidity that has resulted from central banks across the world reducing interest rates, with an added sheen because of the high rate of earnings growth for Indian companies and the lure of the India story. There have been two opposing views about the global rally. One so far unpopular view has been that the rally is unsustainable because it is based on cheap money and is fuelled by debt, and growth is therefore based on shaky foundations. As central banks raise interest rates to contain inflation, so goes the argument, risk appetite will diminish and there will be a flight from risky assets including emerging markets. The bullish view, the one that has been the consensus so far, is that the integration of India and China into the world economy has resulted in falling prices, cheaper labour and new sources of demand. There are, of course, elements of truth in both these views. It is entirely possible that the current bloodbath is a much-needed correction, a mere pause in the party. But it is important to remember that all parties get dull when the supply of liquidity runs out.

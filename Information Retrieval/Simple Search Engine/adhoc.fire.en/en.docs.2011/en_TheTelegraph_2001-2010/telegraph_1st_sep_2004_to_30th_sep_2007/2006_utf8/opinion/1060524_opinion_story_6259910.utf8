 TABLE TALK

 The peace process in Jammu and Kashmir seems to be floundering once again. The prime minister?s initiatives for the state are evidently not being backed up by enough groundwork or realism. Moreover, the recent escalation of violence in the state does not auger well for the return of normalcy, and Jammu and Kashmir may witness a turbulent summer this year. The round table of political leaders that the prime minister is hosting in Srinagar was intended to demonstrate New Delhi?s seriousness about solving the problems of the state. It was also intended to help develop a consensus among the various regional groups within the state regarding their vision of the future. This was an imaginative initiative, and the prime minister?s presence gives it the gravitas it needed. Three months ago, at the first round table, the separatist groups were missing. This needed to be corrected. Unfortunately, mandarins of the home ministry and various agencies operating in Jammu and Kashmir seem to have succeeded in almost reducing the round table to a farce. The separatists of the moderate wing of the All Party Hurriyat Conference are boycotting the event, and even the Bharatiya Janata Party has indicated that it may not participate. The National Conference has also signalled that it may not attend if the prime minister meets the separatists at the sidelines. Before invitations were sent out for the round table, there should have been a formal confirmation of attendance from the separatists and other parties.

 This clearly was not done. Moreover, an agenda for the meeting should have been provided to make participants aware that this was not just one more seminar on Kashmir. Few seem to be clear about what is going to be discussed at the round table and the format for the meeting. There have been occasions when separatists and mainstream groups have sat together and had a meaningful discussion. The Pugwash Conference in Pakistan was one such inclusive event. But the separatists are not willing to be part of any conference that could erode their credibility and give little in return. Part of New Delhi?s efforts should have gone into convincing the separatists that they will not appear to have ?sold out? by attending the conference. It is clear that the prime minister is serious about Jammu and Kashmir and wants a resolution of its problems during his tenure. But his bureaucrats are letting him down.

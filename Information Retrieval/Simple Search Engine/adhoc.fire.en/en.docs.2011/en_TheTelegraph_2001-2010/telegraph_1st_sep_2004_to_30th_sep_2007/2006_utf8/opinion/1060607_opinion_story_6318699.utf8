 PRICE OF GAS

 The agonizing process through which the decision to raise petrol and diesel prices is arrived at and the predictable hostile noises made by political parties have both become as tedious as an anecdote repeated many times over. This time is no different. One reason for the tediousness is the refusal to separate the price-fixing mechanism from politics. Such a separation was accepted a few years ago, but that decision is gathering dust in a file in some government department. The hostile noises are, and always have been, difficult to comprehend. Take the present situation. Estimates show that the state-owned oil companies are losing around Rs 1,500 crore every week. The political parties, especially the left, are unwilling to address this question. Another thorny issue is the revenue that the government exchequer earns from petroleum products. About 50 per cent of the retail price for petrol is made up of government levies. If this were reduced, the price of petrol would automatically come down. The minister for petroleum, Mr Murli Deora, has tried to convince the finance minister, Mr P. Chidambaram to reduce the Central duties on petroleum products. There were some reductions in the recent past. But Mr Deora has failed to persuade the finance minister to institute further reductions in the duties. Over and above the Central duties, there are the levies imposed on petroleum products by the state governments. The common man, the left?s hapless hero, is thus a victim of the State?s taxation policy, even in states where the left is in power.

 Neither the Central government nor the state governments are prepared to incur a loss in revenue by cutting down duties on petroleum products. A loss in revenue, the argument runs, would hamper welfare programmes that benefit the people. The left?s list of welfare schemes is ever-increasing. The employment guarantee scheme alone is going to cost Rs 40,000 crore annually. The bill for the proposed social security scheme might even be higher. The left and the other political parties cannot have it both ways: they cannot oppose the rise in petroleum and diesel prices and at the same time champion costly welfare schemes. Where the money is going to come from is a question very few leftists face. The price of petroleum products should be left to the market, and political pressure should not be used to roll back what are essentially economic decisions.

 FISSURES IN THE SOCIETY

 ARDHENDU CHATTERJEE

 The offer of help from the Union human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, to Balaram Tudu, a scheduled tribe candidate from Orissa, with his admission to the preparatory course for 2006-07 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, received rave notices in newspapers. Basking in the afterglow of pushing through the legislation to give constitutional sanction to 27 per cent additional quota for students of other backward classes in higher education, Singh finds a place in the pantheon of heroes fighting for the rights of the underprivileged. So far so good. But, instead of being national and liberal in their outlooks, most of our politicians are sectarian and parochial. They fan the flames of social tension, and go overboard over the deprivation of the backward classes. Even after the recent judgment of the Supreme Court bench headed by the judge, S.B. Sinha, upholding the policy of protective discrimination and affirmative action for the socially backward, reservation has not really empowered the marginalized. A few days ago the spectre of caste divide reared its ugly head at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The frisson of hostility between two socially divided groups of students was a syndrome of an ever-widening fissure in society. 

 But the apex courts counsel for a test of strict scrutiny before making any classification among people is a sound one. It finds echo in the interim report of the Veerappa Moily committee, which considers expansion, inclusion and excellence [to be] the moving spirit behind the new reservation policy. Though the committee opposes dilution of academic standards, it may prove to be an empty rhetoric unless the threshold marks for admission of OBC students applying to IITs, Indian Institute of Managements and the AIIMS remain almost the same as for general category students. It seems in the hullabaloo over social justice the real issue of qualitative improvement in education has been forgotten. 

 Threat to justice

 Justice denied to poor but meritorious non-OBC children will diminish justice to OBC children. Poverty being our main enemy, total disregard of the economic criteria would be a sort of reverse discrimination against a sizeable section of the student community. Moreover, unless we address the issue of removing the creamy layers, reservation facilities will never percolate down to the really backward. It is, therefore, imperative that the government sets a new benchmark for backwardness. But all national political parties except the Communist Party of Indian (Marxist) oppose the creamy layer theory. It would be a sacrilege for this party to oppose the present reservation policy as it might affect its poll prospects. So Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assurance that his government would try to protect the interests of all sections of students sounds hollow when even the Moily committees recommendations have been ignored. 

 Finally, the objectives of expansion, inclusion and excellence do not seem to be compatible with each other. Expansion of seats, infrastructure and faculty are closely related to inclusion. The idea of expansion has been mooted to ensure that the extra 27 per cent quota for the OBC students does not affect the interests of general category students. A whopping Rs 16,563.35 crore is needed to cope with the additional influx of students. The Union finance minister, P. Chidambaram, has categorically said that the government can raise the fund only through divestment of shares in public sector undertakings a proposition that is anathema to allies like the CPI(M). But the government seems to be ready to make economic development of the country the sacrificial lamb at the altar of populism.

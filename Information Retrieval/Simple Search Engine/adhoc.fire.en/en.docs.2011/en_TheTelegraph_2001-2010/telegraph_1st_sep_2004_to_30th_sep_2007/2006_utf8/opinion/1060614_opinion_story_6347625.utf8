 SHOCK TO PEACE

 The deaths in Assam once again show the tragic face of militancy in the North-east. The people who died in the explosion in a market in Guwahati had nothing to do with insurgency. The most shocking symbol of the Assamese tragedy was the death of a 13-year-old boy in the blast. The incident shows how the militants, who claim to fight the state, end up killing innocent people. The sudden bursts of violence must be particularly saddening because they come in the midst of the peace talks. After a long time, the people of Assam see some reasonable chances of peace. The Centre, the state government and the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom seem to be sincere about the peace negotiations. The people?s consultative committee ? which the Ulfa chose for speaking on its behalf in New Delhi ? represents the people?s desire for peace. A tenuous peace has prevailed since the talks began. The next round of the negotiations is scheduled to be held later this month. The violence threatens to undo all that and plunge the state yet again into chaos and despair. Obviously, the biggest losers would be the people who have suffered the worst from the insurgency-related violence. 

 The challenge, therefore, is not to let the peace process succumb to the violence or to the fears it has generated. Both New Delhi and Dispur must keep their cool and carry on with the peace initiative. That does not mean, however, that the state will remain inactive in the face of violence and threats to people?s lives. The chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi, should find out if the administration had done enough to prevent the tragedy in Guwahati. Until peace comes, the government cannot afford to relax its vigil against the militants. It cannot take too seriously the Ulfa?s disclaimer about its role in the violence. After all, the outfit has a history of derailing peace initiatives on flimsy grounds. It has always used violence and terror in order to promote its separatist agenda. If the current peace efforts fail, the responsibility will lie mainly with the Ulfa.

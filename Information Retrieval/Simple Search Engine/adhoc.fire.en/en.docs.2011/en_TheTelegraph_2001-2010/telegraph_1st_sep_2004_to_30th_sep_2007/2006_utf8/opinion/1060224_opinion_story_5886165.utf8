 Letters to Editor

 Killing fields

 Sir ? Daily news reports and contradictory advertisements show that the government and the poultry lobby are working overtime to spread confusion and panic (?Outbreak under wraps for 12 days?, Feb 22). How the dreaded H5N1 virus found its way to a remote place that is neither close to the international border nor located along the route of migratory birds, is unclear. The poultry industry insists that it is our native Ranikhet disease that is killing overage birds who have low immunity. On the other hand, the government, despite carrying out the nervous culling operations, is crying itself hoarse asking people to eat chicken and eggs as the virus is airborne and enters the human body only through the respiratory tract. Yet the premier government institutions ? railways, airlines, the army and navy are striking chicken off their menu. Chicken is not being consumed by politicians or foreign dignitaries. If the meat is safe, then why are the culled chicken being buried or burnt instead of being distributed for consumption? There is certainly a need for precaution and protection, but a panic response will only hurt the poultry industry and hit the Indian economy. If the spread of the H5N1 virus is indeed true, epidemiologists should locate its source. The nation needs to know whether it is an act of bioterrorism or the pharmaceutical industry?s ploy to offload stockpiled drugs before the expiry date. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? Killing chicken for human consumption is one thing, but the culling of 300,000 chickens because a few of them may be infected with the H5N1 virus is horrifying (?No human case so far?, Feb 19). What is worse, all bird- and animal-lovers seem to have disappeared all of a sudden. Could we ever think of meting out the same treatment to infected human beings? The number of those who are supposed to have died of the flu so far the world over is negligible, and yet the culling continues, turning small poultry farm-owners paupers overnight. The operation in Maharashtra will adversely affect the economy of the area and subsequently that of the country. It is the duty of the government to see that the poor farmers are amply compensated. The death toll is much too meagre to merit such an over-reaction.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? There can be no doubt that the bird flu has arrived in India. Given the fact that the virus could easily mutate and spread among humans, the threat of a pandemic, causing deaths on a much larger scale than the plague of the early 20th century, is quite serious. Other than the preventive measures being taken, the public have to be educated through the electronic media about the basic precautions that need to be taken. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It now seems that even vegetarians are not safe from the possibility of being infected with the avian flue. As a precautionary measure, the government should instruct restaurants and food parlours to use separate kitchenware to cook and serve vegetarian food. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The government should stock Tamiflu in sufficient quantities and ensure that the distributors of the drug do not sell it in the black market. 

 Yours faithfully,

Faruque Chowdhury, Burdwan

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Chickens again? (Feb 20), has justifiably stressed on the need to cull poultry in and around the affected zones. The Indian government has undoubtedly been napping. Despite knowing that the avian flu has been a concern for the entire world, it did precious little to prevent its occurrence. The need of the hour is not to create or spread undue panic and to find out solutions to protect human life. The government should also keep in mind the fact that its ability to deal with the outbreak will go a long way in assuring foreign investors in the country and help the resurgent economy of India. 

 Certain realities of the workings of the poultry industry has to be kept in mind while undertaking the operations. Poultry farmers are often compelled by the drop in demand to sell diseased chickens at a slashed rate, thus endangering the lives of the poor who might buy them. This could be happening right now. It is for the government to ensure that the lives and livelihood of poultry farmers are not endangered or that of the people they sell their products to. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tarakdas Majumdar, Calcutta

 Sir ? In a country where the worth of a chicken happens to be more than the worth of the man on the street, bird flu can spread with lightning speed in the country. The raging confusion within government departments and the uncoordinated efforts to stop the spread of the disease are hallmarks of a third world country. But the steps must have military precision and be widespread. Moreover, the source of the disease must be found out and the conspiracy and sabotage theories investigated. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

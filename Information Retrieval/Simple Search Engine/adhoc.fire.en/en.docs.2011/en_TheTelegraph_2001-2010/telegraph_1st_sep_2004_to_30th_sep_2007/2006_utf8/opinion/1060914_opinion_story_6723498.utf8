 THE TALE OF TWO WIDOWS

 The events following the death of K. Suryanarayana have exposed the ambiguities inherent in Indian legal and social structures, writes Somak Ghoshal

 The dearly departed

 On April 29 this year, taliban abducted Kasula Suryanarayana, a Hyderabadi telecom engineer working in Afghanistan, and killed him the next day. Back home, the government turned him into a martyr. The Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, sent a letter of condolence to the widow, Manjula, praising Suryanarayanas courage and sacrifice. The Central and state governments each announced compensations of Rs 5 lakh, while his Bahraini employer promised Rs 20 lakh, and a further Rs 25 lakh in insurance money. 

 On the same day as the compensations were announced, a young woman, G. Swapna, arrived in Hyderabad from Warangal, Suryanarayanas native village, claiming to have married him in August 2002 at the Ramappa temple. She brought their nine-month-old daughter, Nidisha, along with her, to claim a share of the promised compensations for the child. Swapnas appearance sparked off a series of sensational events: Manjula, Suryanarayanas first and lawfully wedded wife, attempted suicide; her father-in-law had to be admitted to a hospital after a heart attack; while Swapna herself launched into histrionics trying to gain public and political sympathy. She accused Manjula of preventing her from entering the house, and pleaded unsuccessfully with the family to let her see her husbands body for the last time. She even demanded a DNA test to prove Nidishas paternity. But whether this was eventually done is yet to be known.

 In the next few days, Swapna visited the chief minister, Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, and the governor, Rameswar Thakur, with Nidisha wailing in her arms. Reddy, who had condemned this barbaric incident earlier, calling it a personal tragedy for everybody in Andhra Pradesh, gave her assurance of help. Swapna even tried to see, unsuccessfully, the prime ministers wife, who had visited Manjula in the hospital. Swapnas presence in the media was strong. She told and re-told her story to the entire nation. In order to establish the legitimacy of her marriage, she showed her marriage photographs as evidence. Most of her neighbours in Warangal, who were favourably disposed towards the couple, wondered what was to become of her and Nidisha. 

 Legally, there is little ground for Swapna to fight for her rights either for recognition as one of Suryanarayanas family, or for a share of the compensation. Since the Hindu Marriage Act (1956) criminalizes bigamy, making it punishable by imprisonment up to seven years, Swapna has no chance of authenticating her marriage. The first, and the legal, wife has seldom evoked this penal provision, and even if she has had the courage to file a case for bigamy, the charge has been difficult to prove since the onus lies on the litigant to prove that both marriages were performed according to all the rituals. The accused husband can get away most of the time, claiming that the second marriage was not properly solemnized. But bigamy is of marginal importance in the Suryanarayana case, the accused being already dead. The central question here is, who owns the dead and, by extension, the financial remains of his life?

 Manjula being Suryanarayanas lawfully wedded wife, it is to her, and to her children, that the compensation should rightfully go, especially since Swapna has repeatedly admitted full knowledge of her husbands first wife and children before she had married him in 2002. She has never once accused her dead husband of misleading her at the time of marriage; he had kept no secrets from her, the first marriage did not matter to him, he had explained, because his wife was already ailing. How this reasoning fitted into Suryanarayanas justification for re-marriage cannot be conjectured. But the passion with which Swapna, despite her compliance in a legally void marriage, has persistently demanded that she and her daughter be accepted by her in-laws, suggests a fine line between being cheated and being wronged. Her sense of being wronged is not synonymous with, or even based upon, the revelation of her husbands double-life, of which she was, in any event, aware all the time. It is grounded upon something more fundamental. Swapnas demand for justice, her repeated evocation of her rights, goes on to show how the state has no redress for those without strictly legal rights. 

 One of the ways in which Swapna has sought to validate her marriage, however impossibly, has been through emotional appeal. Yet she has not resorted to self-pity or blackmail by pretending to be an unwitting victim of circumstances. She has spoken of her love marriage as unhesitatingly as she had admitted her complicity in Suryanarayanas bigamy. She has pitted emotion against legalism, which perhaps explains how she was provisionally accepted by her in-laws, however fleetingly. Suryanarayanas family, who were steadfastly against even letting Swapna see the body, allowed her to be present at the last rites, and later at the 13th-day ritual in place of Manjula, who was then hospitalized after her suicide attempt. 

 How does one read this provisional concession? On the one hand, it is formed out of feelings that must, apart from sheer legality, involve social justice morality, humanity, propriety and, most importantly, necessity. These constitute what might be described as the para-legal, concerned more with questions of entitlements rather than rights. On the other hand, for a pious Hindu family, everything, even an adulterous wife, is excusable if that ensures the correct observance of rituals. In case of the last rites of a married Hindu man, the presence of his wife, if she survives him, is indispensable. So what if she happens to be the second wife?

 Further concessions came from the family in the wake of the torrent of support for Swapna from various self-help groups when she sat on a dharna in front of Suryanarayanas house. She demanded not any share of the state governments ex-gratia payment, but that the family accept her and provide for her daughter. Suryanarayanas father, before his mild heart attack, had told the media that the details of the arrangement have to be worked out between the two wives, once Manjula returned home from the hospital. Suryanarayanas brother-in-law said that the family was ready to pay Swapna the money she might demand. Unlike his sisters persistent denial of any knowledge, or even possibility, of her husbands second wife, he said that he had seen Swapna before. Not only had Manjula been left in the dark, she was also, presumably, left outside the family decision-making regarding the giving away of Swapnas share.

 But what has transpired since then is uncertain. It was known that the Centre had withdrawn the offer of a state funeral, without explicitly stating the reasons for doing so. While media attention and public response to the case have been ambivalent, the government has been quite explicit in its disapproval of the bigamous element. More recently, it has emerged that Suryanarayanas children have had to drop out of school because the family has not received any of the promised Rs 20-lakh compensation. Manjula feels that the government, which had nearly conferred martyrdom upon her husband, became markedly indifferent ever since allegations of bigamy surfaced against him. Swapna has approached a family court for a stay on the payment of compensation to Manjula, but her petition has not been admitted yet. When she tried filing a police complaint earlier, staking a claim in Suryanarayanas property, she was asked to settle the matter in court. She was also told by the police that if her claim of being married to Suryanarayana is proved correct, both she and her husband were guilty of a criminal offence. 

 Why, despite all the promises of compensation to Manjula and her children, and despite the chief ministers and governors assurances of help to Swapna, should both these women and their children come to such a sticky end? Apart from creating an apparently insoluble legal impasse, Suryanarayanas case provides a fascinating insight into the doubleness of justice or injustice in Indian society. This is a case of not only two wives, and then two widows, two sets of children and claimants for compensation, but also of two parallel systems of judging and responding to human action. 

 Manjula has law on her side, Swapnas is an appeal to human feelings. And the little ground that Swapna had gained with Suryanarayanas family was because of the imperatives of custom. This bizarrely doubled world of the bereft nests within larger social structures the immediate communities of the two women, the State and the media. And here too, in the erratic swings between sympathy and condemnation, is a less theatrical version of the same doubleness.

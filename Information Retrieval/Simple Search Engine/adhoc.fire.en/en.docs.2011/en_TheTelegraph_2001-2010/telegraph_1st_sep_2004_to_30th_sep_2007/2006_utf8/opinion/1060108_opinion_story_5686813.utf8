 Letters to Editor

 Terror on the roads

 Sir ? ?Mother follows son in suicide path? (Jan 4) is a textbook example of how a road accident not only kills a person, but also ruins a family by pushing the victim?s immediate relatives to slow death. Yet our police and transport authorities are reluctant to enforce traffic rules. They allow illegal parking on the footpaths, allow cars to put metal fixtures in the front which can turn fatal for the accident victim, allow vehicles to pollute the air and blare their horns. And then they celebrate road safety week each year.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Left to die

 Sir ? There are no words to say about the death of Gudiya after prolonged suffering and humiliation. The report, ?Gudiya did not live happily ever after? (Jan 3), acknowledges that the media failed to understand the crisis in Gudiya?s life and only aggravated her problems further. Gudiya would probably have been better off with her second husband, Taufiq, who would have taken better care of her as she was carrying his child. Now that she is dead, we will never know what she went through after the Mundali panchayat pronounced that her first husband had a greater claim on her. Did the fear of being ostracized by society and of public embarrassment lead her to accept her fate without any resistance whatsoever? What use to her were the SMS-es sent by the people of the country? The television channel which telecast her story was merely working on the idea that the story of a victimized Muslim woman sells well. None of the newsmen made an attempt to understand her plight. Muslim organizations around the country remained mute spectators to the suffering of this Muslim woman ? perhaps because there was not much room for issuing a fatwa in this case (that is the only thing they do dutifully, ostensibly to protect the interests of Muslims). Instead of describing her as a victim of circumstances, we should rather say that we are the ones who used her to test our religious and social theories.

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? Gudiya has been killed by unwanted publicity ? of her conjugal life in a shambles. She was a pardanasheen woman who was mortified at the media?s interference in her personal affair in the name of public concern. She finally succumbed to the pain and humiliation she suffered when the miserable circumstances of her life were paraded before the public. Why is it so difficult to believe that no matter how Westernized some Indians have become, India still has more women like Gudiya who believe that their modesty is their wealth, and who cannot dream of being in the public eye. What could have done with an in camera hearing got dragged into a public trial to satisfy the voyeurism of educated urban Indians. Gudiya failed to recover from this ordeal. Each one of us who are the consumers of newspapers and news channels is complicit in her death.

 Yours faithfully,

Touseef Ahmed Khan, Calcutta

 Sir ? The trials and tribulations of Gudiya have been put to rest by death. But she has left behind some disturbing questions. It is evidently clear that had the television channels kept themselves away from her life, her pains would not have escalated to such grim heights. These channels seem to thrive on the breach of the individual?s privacy and their private agonies. They would do well to ponder on the impact their coverage has on those who are the object of it, instead of single-mindedly trying to increase their TRP ratings ? by hook or by crook. How long before people?s pain ceases to be our TV channels? fodder?

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

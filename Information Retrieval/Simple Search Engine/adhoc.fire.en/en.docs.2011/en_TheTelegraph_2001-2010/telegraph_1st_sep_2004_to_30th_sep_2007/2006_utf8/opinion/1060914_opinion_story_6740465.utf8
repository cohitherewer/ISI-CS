The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STILL ON TRIAL

 There seems to be no way in which this long story can be cut short. Like the blasts, which claimed their victims all over Mumbai at designated intervals 13 years ago, the verdict in the case will fell the accused in batches, and over what looks like a considerable period of time. But it is unlikely to leave in its wake as much shock and disbelief. In the first judgment delivered, Mr Pramod Kode, the judge of the specially constituted court, has convicted four while exonerating the rest of the seven members of the Memon family. For the Memons, now further divided, this is a personal tragedy. The anger and the tears at the court testify to this. But for the countless victims of the blasts, this is small consolation. They know, as does the rest of the country, that the masterminds and the key players of this deadly game have escaped the dragnet. No matter how severe and intense the subsequent judgments, those who have blood on their hands will go unpunished. Despite the overwhelming evidence, no legal case could be brought against those who have fled the country. Only decoys are now supposed to fill the jails.

 Who is to blame for the predicament of those who continue to suffer 13 years after the tragedy? The accusing finger will immediately point to systemic deficiencies, the tardy investigative process (a prime accused was allowed to go scot-free for the lack of fingerprints) and the long-winded legal procedure that involved 686 witnesses, 123 accused and about 11,000 pages of evidence. Between the police, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the changes in the law courts, valuable time has been lost and individual patience and grit subjected to enough trials. But none can discount the need for pointing beyond the immediate. The pugmarks of Pakistan have been clearly visible in the events of 1993 as in so many others subsequently. Trails of the Memon operations lead in and out of that country. Enough evidence has also been supplied by the United States of America of the presence of the mastermind of the blasts on neighbouring soil. And yet, Pakistan continues to deny having provided any of the criminals refuge or being involved in any way in the terror attacks. It is as necessary to nail this lie as to bring succour to the blast victims by hastening the judicial process.

 LOOK BEFORE AND AFTER

 It could be argued that the year 2005 partially fulfilled one of the promises of the era of liberalization. It saw the economy breaking free from the shackles of politics. Despite the left?s resistance to taking the economic reform process forward and the government?s refusal to step on the reform accelerator, the economy continued to grow. It is now clear that the so-called Hindu rate of growth is a thing of the past, and, for the Indian economy, a double digit rate of economic growth is no longer a distant dream. The stock market boomed like it has never done before. The shadow of political uncertainty brought about by the left?s rhetoric did not dampen the optimism of the stock market. The economy and the market thus seemed to be insulated from political processes, though it is undeniable that government policy remains the prime determinant of the market and the economy.

 For politicians, it was a bad year with many of them caught on camera with their hands in the till and noses in the trough. For the first time in the history of independent India, as many as eleven members of parliament have been expelled from parliament because of corruption. Similarly, a cabinet minister, Mr K. Natwar Singh, had to step down because there was the suspicion that he was involved in oil deals with Iraq which were not aboveboard. The protestations of innocence that came from the politicians only served to confirm the poor opinion of politicians that has become embedded in public perception. It was just as well, perhaps, that two politicians of a bygone era decided to bid adieu. Mr L.K. Advani stepped down as president of the Bharatiya Janata Party under circumstances that were not exactly savoury. His extolling of Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Pakistan made him singularly unpopular with the sanghis. His old colleague and rival, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, announced his retirement from electoral politics. But the retirement, characteristically for Mr Vajpayee, was expressed through so many allusions that it was not clear how many targets Mr Vajpayee had hit with one announcement.

 Closer home, public imagination was excited by the fall and rise of the local hero, Sourav Ganguly. The latter first lost his captaincy and then his place in the Indian side. This was followed by an outcry in Calcutta and parts of West Bengal in which even the chief minister of the state joined in. Ganguly?s inclusion in the squad for Pakistan has acted as a salve on nerves, but it is clear that regional passions had a role to play in Ganguly?s return.

 At the beginning of the year gone by, the tsunami was at the top of everyone?s concern in India and elsewhere in the world. Relief and rehabilitation are nowhere near what they should have been. But at the year-end, the concern had not disappeared and there was a note of optimism about reducing the scale of human suffering.

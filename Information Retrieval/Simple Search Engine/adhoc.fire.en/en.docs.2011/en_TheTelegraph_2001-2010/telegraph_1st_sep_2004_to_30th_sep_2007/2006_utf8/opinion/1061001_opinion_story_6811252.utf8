The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Maharashtra CM Vilasrao Deshmukh 

 is sailing in choppy waters. Madam is reported to be mightily 

 peeved over his inability to check farmers suicides in 

 the state. Worse, during the Congress chief ministers meet 

 in Nainital, Deshmukh came up with a rather fantastic explanation 

 for the deaths. Studies, Deshmukh said, have apparently 

 shown that poor farmers over the age of seventy were commiting 

 suicide so that their debt-ridden families would get the 

 Rs one lakh compensation. And, despite the relief package, 

 there have been over a hundred deaths every month, he added. 

 But then he was quick to point out that help was at hand. 

 His government is now planning to hold Art of Living courses 

 for these poor men, hoping that would help them reduce the 

 stress and stop them from taking their own lives, informed 

 Deshmukh rather cheerily. But his smile faded quickly, as 

 soon as he caught the cold glint in Madams eyes.

 Cold response

 Senior Congress leader AK Antony 

 has made it a habit to bunk important important political 

 engagements. Last time around, when Kerala went to polls, 

 the former chief minister had got himself admitted to hospital. 

 This time too, Antony was missing from the Nainital meet. 

 And the wily politician had a ready excuse. Antony, it seems, 

 is suffering from sinus and is allergic to cold climes. 

 When the host chief minister, Narain Dutt Tiwari, called 

 Antony up to assure him that it was bright and sunny in 

 the hills, Antony replied that the weather in the hills 

 can be a tricky customer, and hence cannot be trusted. Congressmen 

 were reportedly left busy trying to decipher the import 

 of Antonys words in the political context.

 A sardar may be heading the government, but it is the Malloos who call the shots. That is because the PMs principal secretary, the national security adviser, the foreign secretary, all hail from Gods own country. And some of them are not scared to show where they belong TK Nair, the principal secretary, has been lobbying hard to set up a container terminal in Kerala. The going, however, gets tough sometimes. Nairs efforts of gifting Kerala a port has been stubbornly resisted by T.R. Balu, the Union minister. Balu, allegedly, wants the project to go to Tamil Nadu, his home state. But Nair has found other ways to shower his love over Kerala. He recently led a Central team to look into the deaths of twenty farmers in Wynad. Even an accident was not enough to deter the man from doing his bit for his brethren. Already, Nairs legendary love for all things Malayali has been the talk of the town in babudom. We suspect that there might soon be a new face in the lot of Malloo MPs, the next time the state goes to the polls.

 Moving on to Ujjain, someone is as busy as Nair. Mauni baba, a tantrik, tops the popularity charts among netas. But the babas powers work best if his devotees turn up dressed as women. But then (womens) clothes can hardly throw a spanner in the works of politicians seeking divine blessings. After a MP minister called on the tantrik recently, it was the turn of a Central minister to hold a four-hour long yajna in the presence of his holiness. The ministers antics must have come as a shock to his friends in the left. But then, they might never find out, considering our man was in a brilliant disguise.

 Shivraj Singh Chauhan is surely a man of letters. And some of his dispatches are funny as well. Take for instance his correspondence with the Congressman, Digvijay Singh. When Singh wrote to Chauhan opposing the lifting of the ban on government workers attending RSS shakhas, the latter replied that a stint at one of the camps might work wonders for Singh himself. In another letter, after appreciating Diggy Rajas concern for corruption, he gently reminded him to use his clout to get the government cracking on cases that feature a fair share of Congressmen too.

 There cannot be a bigger nationalist than Rajiv Shukla. The man lives in the north (Delhi), is an MP from the west (Maharashtra), heads a cricket association of the Central Zone and has now become the vice president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India from the the east.

 Whatever his critics may say about his social skills, Manmohan Singh does know how to win friends and influence people. The communists are not an overtly friendly lot, and they certainly dont fancy the idea of tom-tomming their friendship with a party who they believe is in power at the Centre solely because of their support. But Singhs charm is such that it brought the Marxist CM of West Bengal to his residence on his birthday with a bouquet of roses (red, werent they?), and a coy grievance: You only advise the Congress chief ministers, you should advise me too. Net gain: the report of the Nainital conclave is supposed to be flying to Calcutta very soon. But not every Marxist gets as lucky as Buddhababu. One Comrade Yechury too got so close to the PM that the latter handpicked him for the Havana trip. But the idea was later dropped, much to the relief of the politburo, one hears. And so, it seems, red is not equally bright everywhere.

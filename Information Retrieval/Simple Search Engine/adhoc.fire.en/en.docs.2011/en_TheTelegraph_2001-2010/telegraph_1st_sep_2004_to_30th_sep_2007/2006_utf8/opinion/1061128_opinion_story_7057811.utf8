 GETTING ACROSS THE BORDER

 Trade, and not so much politics, formed the cornerstone of the Indian strategy during the visit of the Chinese president, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 No surprises

 In Hyderabad House last week, as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, supervised the signature of thirteen documents (long on hyperbole and short on the vision thing), an unseen presence seemed to hover over the proceedings the ghost of the 6th century BC Chinese philosopher, Sun Tzu, watching two modern-day pragmatists reinterpret his ancient treatise on the art of war into a race for space under the Asian sun. 

 It was a curious press conference, with each leader reading out a prepared speech and the cameras watching out for shifts in every muscle and sinew. Interestingly, the Chinese side had requested the Indian side not to allow journalists to ask questions to either of the two leaders. 

 More than any other expression of peace and brotherhood, it was this request that became a defining moment during President Hus visit to India. Perhaps Beijing was nervous that the Indian press, with its scant respect for propriety, would bluntly ask why China felt that Arunachal Pradesh was not a part of India, why the border talks were going so slowly, and whether cheap, Chinese goods were waiting to swallow up the Indian market. 

 Considering that the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, during his visit to New Delhi in the summer of 2005, had fielded every embarrassing query with the aplomb of a kung-fu artiste, Hu Jintaos exceeding shyness was somewhat of a surprise. In fact, Premier Wen, during his visit, had signed a document laying down the principles of a border settlement between the two sides. There would be no exchange of settled populations. A final settlement, give or take minor territorial concessions, would follow the internationally-recognized watershed principle. 

 In effect, both governments would retain control over the territory that they had today, that is, India would keep Arunachal Pradesh even if China claimed all of it and China would, largely, keep control over the swathe of Aksai Chin that India claimed but had lost control of since the 1962 war. Considering that Jawaharlal Nehru never fully recovered his health after the Indian debacle at the hands of the Chinese in 1962, the border agreement signed during Premier Wens visit could have become a political hot potato for the Congress. Instead, a year-and-a-half later, a public restatement of Chinas historical position by its ambassador, Sun Yuxi, over Arunachal Pradesh gave New Delhi the opportunity to diplomatically scold Beijing on the issue. In a sense, Hus visit had bombed even before it started. 

 Nevertheless, the sound and fury over Arunachal before the visit also gave India the chance to do some real work. Apart from the promotion of bilateral trade doubling the current figure of $20 billion to $40 billion by 2010 the success of Hus visit lay in the fact that both sides promised to explore trans-border linkages in the promotion of the relationship. That is, current border points, whether at Nathu-la or at Lipulekh pass, would be upgraded, while items for trade would be expanded. New Delhi had already decided that road conditions would be improved, whether at Lipulekh the current pilgrim route to Kailash Mansarovar or at Bum-la/Tawang, the popular crossing point for Tibetans into India. 

 The point is, if China was scoring a political point by claiming Tawang (because that was the birthplace of the mighty sixth dalai lama, and Beijing wanted to tell the world that all of Tibet was an integral part of China), then the line of actual control or even the border at Tawang could well be transformed into a soft border on the lines of the line of control between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. 

 At the bottom of the Indian strategy lay the Manmohan Singh thesis that India would be amenable to any compromise with any country on the condition that map-making in the Indian subcontinent should cease and that religion could not be the basis of any understanding. 

 If pilgrims on both sides of the Sino-Indian border, whether at Tawang or Nathu-la or at Lipulekh pass, could travel into adjoining regions, whether by bus or car or truck and if they could make good money in the bargain then a lot of the hangover from history could be obliterated. 

 The decision to hold a car rally from Calcutta to Kunming, a vibrant city in Chinas south, seems another master-stroke. Considering that both provinces on both sides of the border are politically red, the opportunity to revive the old World War II-era Stillwell road and to promote Calcutta as an entrept for eastern India and southern China could make bilateral trade a win-win for both sides. 

 Unfortunately, at the Hu visit, the atmospherics were so sombre that they more than overwhelmed the technocratic temperament of both the leaders. In Pakistan, on the other hand, Hu fared much better, with the flamboyant Pervez Musharraf on his side. The decision to turn large parts of Lahore into a special economic zone, besides waxing eloquent about the all-weather friendship between the two sides, was another huge contrast. 

 In this post-Cold War world and in the wake of the passage by the US senate of the Indo-US civil nuclear deal, perhaps Manmohan Singh felt that trade, not politics, was the need of the hour. With China, especially, it was imperative to dissolve the unhealthy sentiments left over from 1962. 

 If you did not want an entire nation weeping into their handkerchiefs when Lata Mangeshkar sang Ay mere watan ke logon, you needed to channelize their energies into creating the kind of wealth that casinos in nearby tinpot dictatorships could only dream of. The only thing to do in this case was to borrow the Chinese slogan and get rich quickly.

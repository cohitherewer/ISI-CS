 MOLE ON THE NOSE

 - A gentleman fallen among politicians

 A Call To Honour: In Service Of 

 Emergent India 

 By Jaswant Singh, Rupa, Rs 495

 Jaswant Singh is a gentleman fallen among politicians. We have been waiting for his memoirs ever since a south-east Asian summit when the post-banquet entertainment took the form of a skit that was a witty take-off of Lewis Carroll?s ?You are Old Father William?. Understandably, Jaswant?s prolonged dialogue with Strobe Talbott dominated jolly references to buses to Lahore, recaptured peaks (Kargil) and ?Hamlet sans the prince? (Pranab Mukherjee?s line when India was excluded from the Asia-Europe conference): ?Question: You are sharp, Mr Singh, and one must suppose/That your eye is steady as ever/For you balance Strobe on the end of your nose/What makes you so awfully clever? Minister: That?s because my nose is very long/In my youth, I used to butt and rebutt (sic)/But my book will tell of the lance,/Which I used on the good Mr Talbott./Could I sell you a copy in advance??

 No advance copy, but plenty of advance publicity that, alas, diminishes a very readable and moving tour d?horizon of India and its place in the world. But whether Jaswant balanced Talbott on the end of his nose or the butting, rebutting and balancing was the other way round is a moot point.

 Predictably, the first chapter, ?Memories of a sunlit land?, makes the most impression. The author is deeply traditionalist and profoundly romantic, and it is in discussing life, lineage and the land that his orotund elegance blossoms effusively. He loves his Rajasthan and feels intensely for the country of which it is a part. The failure of Jawaharlal Nehru?s China policy, India?s tortured relations with Pakistan, terrorist bloodshed, the trauma of Kandahar, the PMO mole, Pokhran II and the Agra fiasco lie beyond a still rosy horizon. Flashes of the same style do illumine some of the subsequent pages but seem wasted when describing humdrum affairs of state.

 The brilliance of his sunlit land is not darkened by shadows of being denied a ministry at all to start with, of the initial additional burden of the defence portfolio, or of being shifted from external affairs to finance. These are matters of politics and politicking that, one is given to understand and accepts too, play no part in the sanatan dharma of an armed crusader (ecumenically mixed metaphors can only honour the author?s sweeping vision) tilting his lance at his country?s enemies. As Jaswant suggests, he is seeking the lost elysium of his mythic ?village?; he is a mason sculpting our many tomorrows.

 More personal than Henry Kissinger?s White House Years and Years of Upheaval, A Call to Honour boasts something of the depth and breadth of Dean Acheson?s Present at the Creation, subtitled ?My Years at the State Department?. But, sadly, the genre in which the book falls will not allow it to be judged only on the basis of philosophical reflection. There is no doubting the diligence with which the author served his country in his three ministerial capacities. But Jaswant?s party is not just a distillation of his own benign nationalism; many also identify it with the murderous Bajrang Dal and the egregious Narendra Modi. Repeated use of ?humble? and ?humbling? cannot but recall Uriah Heep in David Copperfield. The journalist who ?tightened? the manuscript should have known there is no such word as ?uptil? and that ?at least? are two words.

 The more mundane level at which this book will unfortunately be read, because that is the level of political awareness in India, already bristles with questions. Was ransom paid in Kandahar? What exchanges did Jaswant have with the ?Swiss gentleman of dignity and reserve...[who] worked for the international community of finance? ? Roberto Giori (actually Italo-Swiss), the ?currency king? who controls 90 per cent of the world?s currency printing and was also a IC 814 hijack victim? Would India have signed the comprehensive test ban treaty but for cabinet resistance helped by a retired foreign secretary? Did India indeed offer the United States full military facilities for Operation Enduring Freedom? The saga of the mole who may or may not have been deserves separate treatment.

 This is not a book for definitive answers, which might disappoint those with an interest in the nitty-gritty of foreign policy. One would have liked to read something about the China threat that Arun Shourie finds so alarming. Agreed that Kashmir is ?only a symptom? of Pakistani hostility, Jaswant might have identified the cause. Jaswant is right to deplore the media breakfast during the Agra summit but there was also organizational miscalculation. Ironically, a TV series on the Crusades that very week showed the legendary Saladin refusing to see Richard the Lionheart because ?great kings should not meet face to face until they have settled all differences.? Atal Bihari Vajpayee should have heeded that.

 The end of sanctions is also contentious. Jaswant attributes it to India?s importance and the Bharatiya Janata Party?s astuteness. Pressure by US businessmen who were losing money, Pakistan?s near-bankruptcy, and surplus production in America?s wheat-growing northwest while world prices slumped were also factors. Pakistan had bought 37 per cent of US grain in 1997. It faced another famine and desperately needed the $40 million credit it was granted to buy 350,000 tonnes of American wheat as soon as Bill Clinton modified sanctions. That also rescued America?s own wheat-growing states from fiscal crisis. India was almost an accidental beneficiary.

 George W. Bush finally lifted sanctions ten days after 9/11 because Pakistan was indispensable to his military aims. It was American self-interest all the way, even to acknowledge ?India Shining?. This is something Jaswant cannot bring himself to admit. Indeed, he can barely say an unkind word about anyone. He calls the Zhou Enlai-Henry Kissinger pact ?an outstanding example? of trust when it was really an outstanding example of cynical expediency. But innocence adds to the pleasure of reading his book, irrespective of analyses and conclusions. The Proper Study of Mankind, after all, is Man. Not paltry politics.

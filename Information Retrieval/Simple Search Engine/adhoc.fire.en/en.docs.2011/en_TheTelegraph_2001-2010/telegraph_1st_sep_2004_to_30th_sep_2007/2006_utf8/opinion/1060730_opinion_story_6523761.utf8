 Letters to Editor

 Clean up the mess

 Sir ? The editorial, ?English again? (July 24), rightly notes that the shortsightedness of the Left Front in education has harmed Bengal irreparably. Having worked for over 30 years outside the state, I realize that the people of this state, once much sought after by both public and private sectors, are no longer considered for even clerical or junior management positions. Even if language laboratories are set up, prospective employers will continue to look for the right mindset and work ethos among employees, besides skill and proficiency. Is the government willing to do anything about that?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tapan Dutta, 

 Calcutta

 Guests of honour

 Sir ? The report, ?Karat for Castro 80th birthday party? (July 26), shows the bonhomie that still exists between the world?s communists. The leftist government of West Bengal had sent large quantities of food to Cuba when it was facing food shortages owing to sanctions imposed by the United States of America. However, given that Marxism is now much diluted and the pro-capitalist leanings of Indian Marxists are more than obvious, one wonders if communism would continue to be the binding factor among the Cuban and Indian leaders. Nevertheless, the Karats can enjoy the birthday bash and learn from the communist stalwart of Cuba.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta,

 Calcutta

 Sir ? News of the Karats? visit to Cuba on Fidel Castro?s birthday made amazing reading. Cuba?s indomitable president once shook hands with Nikita Krushchev and has been calling the shots in his country for decades now, despite the collapse of Marxism worldwide. Castro?s birthday party will be attended by icons and living legends from all around the world. Perhaps the Karats? presence on the grand occasion will take us closer to Cuba.

 Yours faithfully, 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir ? For the super rich featured in Fortune 500, it is usual to throw lavish parties. Only a few months back, Lakshmi Mittal threw a mother of all such extravaganzas at his daughter?s wedding. Fidel Castro, undoubtedly, is one among the super rich. The Cuban dictator?s fortunes are drawn from a cluster of state-owned companies, retail conglomerates, and companies which sell vaccines and other pharmaceuticals produced in Cuba. Castro?s estimated worth is about 10 per cent of Cuba?s GDP. Why should anyone be surprised that Castro should decide to throw a lavish party on his birthday?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Chameli Pal, 

 Batanagar 

 Mayhem in the wild 

 Sir ? ?Lab animals let off in jungle? (July 24) is a classic example of the callousness of the Indian Institute of Science. The authorities, obviously, take wildlife for granted. The IISc has shown very little responsibility towards the bonnet macaques and monkeys that were used in experiments. In what wisdom did the institution set these animals free in the wild? For one, these primates have been reared in captivity and can neither hunt for food nor survive in the wild. But more, important, they have been used for experiments and may carry in them germs that could destroy wildlife and threaten human habitation in the region. Worse, the institute now expects wildlife conservationists to pick up the tab for them. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Tuli Das,

 Calcutta

 Sir ? The IISc should be reprimanded and made to account for its irresponsibility. The released monkeys should be found and taken back by the institute. It should also pay for any damages done to the environment.

 Yours faithfully, 

 S. Sen, 

 Calcutta

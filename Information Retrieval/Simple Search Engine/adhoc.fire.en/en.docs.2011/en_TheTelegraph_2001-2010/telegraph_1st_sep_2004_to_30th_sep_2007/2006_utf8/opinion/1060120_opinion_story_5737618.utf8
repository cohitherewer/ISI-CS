 Reign of the red star

 Brute force

 Russia: War, peace amp; diplomacy, essays in honour of John Erickson Edited by Ljubica Erickson and Mark Erickson, Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, ? 14.50

 John Erickson?s trilogy of the Soviet military published during the Sixties set the stage for academic studies on the Red Army in the English- speaking world. At the height of Cold War, Erickson focused on the strategic d?tente between the former USSR and the West. The 20 essays in this book have been written by some of the most famous historians of the Western world and they reveal the respect with which Erickson is hailed within the circuit of war studies. Some of the contributors are also from the eastern side of the river Niemen which shows that Erickson?s fame also influenced Soviet historiography.

 Andrei Mertsalov argues that in contrast to the West, the Soviet Union regarded Antoine-Henri de Jomini and not Clausewitz as the foremost thinker of warfare. During the Napoleonic wars, Jomini served in the Czarist army. Besides this fact, the Soviets were fond of Jomini because he considered military studies as a science with rules. For Clausewitz warfare remained an art. Hence, Jomini?s writings were more attractive to the positivist Marxist theoreticians in the Red Army.

 In contrast to the views of popular writers like William L. Shirer and Paul Carell, Christopher Bellamy, who did his doctorate under Erickson, shows that from the late nineteenth century onwards, Russia developed a sophisticated theory of ?future warfare? and the Soviets carried this trend further forward. Both the Czarist and the Stalinist regimes concentrated on fighting and winning the next ?big war? with a big power. The ?big power?, for most of the time, was Germany. The limitation of Soviet military doctrine, according to Bellamy, was that inadequate attention was given to low-intensity operations. So, during the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in the Eighties, and during Russian peacekeeping operations in Chechnya in the Nineties, there was no theory to guide the military planners in Moscow.

 John W.M. Chapman, Paul Dukes, Norman Stone and Sally N. Cummings show the similarities between Czarist and Bolshevik foreign policies. From 1880 till 1990, Moscow was interested in dominating the Near East, Middle East and central Asia. Despite Marxist-Leninist principles, in terms of geopolitics, the Stalinist attitude towards Japan, China, Mongolia and Turkey did not differ much from that of the Czars. 

 Hew Strachan notes similarities between the Czarist and Soviet military policies. During the First World War, Russia had the largest army in the world. This remained the case during the Second World War too. In a way, such evidence indirectly strengthens the thesis that Stalin was preparing to end the bourgeois stage in history by military means.

 Whatever may be the motivation of the Stalinist regime, the Soviet neurosis with security continued till the last days of Cold War. James Cant asserts that the Soviet deployment of SS-20 medium range ballistic missiles in Warsaw Pact countries during the Seventies was due to the fear that the West was preparing for a nuclear showdown with the Soviet bloc.

 The essays compel the reader to reflect upon the continuities and discontinuities in Russian history. Rather than Marxist ideology, it was historical experience and the principles of power-politics that drove Soviet history in the twentieth century.

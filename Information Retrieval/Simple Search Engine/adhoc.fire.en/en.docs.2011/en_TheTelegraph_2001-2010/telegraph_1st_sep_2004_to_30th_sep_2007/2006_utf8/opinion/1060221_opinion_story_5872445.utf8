 PUBLIC CRIME

 There is only one country in which senior bureaucrats smile away public incitements to murder from ministers. This country does exist in reality, and not in cartoon-land. The haj and minority affairs minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mr Mohammed Yaqoob Qureshi, has taken it upon himself to destroy any notion that the world might have had of the maturity of the huge minority population living in India. It stood out in its restraint during the worldwide violence in reaction to the publication of cartoons of Prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper. Perhaps Mr Qureshi thought he would seize his moment of glory when he announced at a meeting that he would reward the executioner of the Danish cartoonist with Rs 51 crore and his weight in gold. Even at his most insane, he could not have imagined that he would ever be able to fulfil his promise. So he was out to do two things. He wanted to incite immediate ? and totally pointless ? violence. And he wanted to make murder seem legitimate. It is futile to comment on the barbarism of sensibility that can prompt this; the relevant point is his deliberate violation of responsibility and duty associated with the position of minister and leader of the people. 

 But it should cause no surprise that one individual, even if he be a minister, should number among the many excrescences on this earth. What is truly alarming is the belated and reluctant condemnation of Mr Qureshi from the Samajwadi Party. The principal secretary of the state has actually invoked democratic normalcy in Mr Qureshi?s defence, and has dismissed the threat to murder as inoffensive since it has been made against a person living in a distant country. The silence from the ?secular? parties has been deafening, and the Bharatiya Janata Party?s vociferousness in contrast has merely sharpened the communal edge. The political forces at play here ? the Samajwadi Party?s dependence on a large minority votebank, the Congress?s need for other parties? support in the state, the memory of Babri Masjid ? seem to have made cowards of political leaders instead of urging them to prompt and decisive action. Mr Qureshi should be relieved of his ministership and charged with the crime of incitement. The real criticism has come, tellingly, from minority institutions and parties anxious to dissociate themselves from Mr Qureshi?s disgraceful stance.

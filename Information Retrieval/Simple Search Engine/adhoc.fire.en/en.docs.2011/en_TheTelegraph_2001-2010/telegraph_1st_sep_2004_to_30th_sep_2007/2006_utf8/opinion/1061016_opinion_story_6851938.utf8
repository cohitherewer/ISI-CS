 PLAY THE NUCLEAR CARD

 Gwynne Dyer

 In psychobabble, what North Korea has just done would be characterized as a cry for help, like a teenage kid burning his parents house down because he is misunderstood. Granted, it is an unusually loud cry for help, but now that North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-Il, has got our attention, what are we going to do about him?

 North Koreas nuclear weapon test makes it the ninth nuclear power, and by far the least predictable. It probably has only a few nuclear weapons, and it certainly cannot deliver them to any targets beyond South Korea and Japan, but the notion of nuclear weapons in the hands of a crazy state frightens people.

 So relax: Kim Jong-Il is not crazy. The former US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, who has negotiated with him, says he is well-informed and not at all delusional. He pretends to be unstable because his regimes survival depends on blackmailing foreign countries into giving it the food and fuel that it cannot produce for itself. Rogue nukes are a big part of that image, but like any professional blackmailer, he would hand them over for the right price.

 Twist the arms

 Put yourself in Kims shoes. He inherited a country from his father, Kim Il-Sung, that was already in acute crisis. The centralized Stalinist economy had been failing for a decade, and, in 1991, post-Soviet Russia cut off the flow of subsidized oil, fertiliser and food, effectively halving North Koreas GDP.

 Yet Kim needed the support of the military and the party officials who controlled North Koreas command economy, and derived their power and privileges from it. Kims inheritance was far from secure, so he left the economy alone and used the threat of going nuclear to extort aid from foreign countries.

 The younger Kim had been put in charge of North Koreas nuclear weapons programme by his father in the late Eighties. By 1993, Washington was so concerned that it offered Pyongyang a deal: stop the programme, and the United States of America would give North Korea huge amounts of foreign aid. Kim Il-Sung died in July, 1994, and it was his son who approved the Framework Agreement with the US in which America promised to send Pyongyang half a million tonnes of oil a year and eventually build the North Koreans two nuclear reactors.

 Equally guilty

 China, South Korea and other neighbours chipped in, sending grain, other food, and medicines. Kim Jong-Il won some breathing space to consolidate his rule but then a series of floods and droughts overwhelmed the countrys inefficient collective farms, and up to a million North Koreans starved. By 2002, in desperation, Kim Jong-Il played the nuclear card again.

 This time, the US refused to yield to blackmail, so the past four years have seen North Korea withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, throw out IAEA inspectors, test-fire missiles near South Korea and Japan, and now test an actual nuclear weapon. Kim Jong-Il only has one card, and he keeps trying to play it.

 Kim would probably relinquish his nuclear weapons if he were offered enough food and oil aid, an end to trade embargoes, and a firm US promise not to try and overthrow him. Nor has Kim any intention of attacking anybody, especially with nuclear weapons: he would have no hope of surviving the instant and crushing retaliation by American nuclear weapons. So it is just a question of persuading him to stop the nonsense.

 But what about the principle of the thing? Wont other countries be tempted to follow North Koreas example if we dont punish it for developing nuclear weapons? You know, like we did when Israel, India and Pakistan developed their nuclear arsenal.

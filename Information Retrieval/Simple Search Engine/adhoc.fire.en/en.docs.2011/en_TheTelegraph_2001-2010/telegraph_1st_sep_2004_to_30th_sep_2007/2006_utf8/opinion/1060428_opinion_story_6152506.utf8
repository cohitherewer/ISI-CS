 FOR THE SAKE OF FREEDOM

 Understanding the Venezuelan Revolution By Marta Harnecker, Daanish, Rs 150

 A s American and British soldiers fight their distant war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the West seems to brace up for another clash of civilizations. For the US, there is Iran and the gradual left tilt in Latin America, all of which is making George W. Bush sit up and ponder.

 The clash can be traced back to the early 19th century. Simon Bolivar fought and won independence for six south American countries from centuries of Spanish rule. But he failed in his mission to form the United States of South America and died in 1830. The English-speaking US always tried to colonize and control the Spanish speaking America, right from Mexico down to Argentina. 

 South America produced a series of anti-US heroes. Che Guevara is one of them. He joined Cuba?s Fidel Castro to bring about revolution there and then moved on to fight in Africa. Former Chilean president, Salvador Allende was another of them. He was overthrown by a CIA backed coup in 1973. Cuba?s Castro survived many assassination and coup attempts, and the Bay of Pigs crisis in the Sixties.

 There is another Latin American leader, living dangerously since 1998. An unsuccessful military coup was staged against this man too, on April 11, 2002, but a massive protest and a sort of counter coup brought him back. The book under review tries to understand the ?revolution?, together with Hugo Chavez?s views on different issues. 

 Harnecker says that Chavez ?does not define himself as a Marxist, but rather as revolutionary and Bolivarian.? Chavez?s transformation from a military officer to an elected democrat is discussed at length ? his attempted coup in 1992, the elections in 1998, his re-election in 2000 and 2004. Chavez talks to Harnecker about his struggle, the resistance from the media, the big business houses and even the judiciary. There were attempts to destabilize him through strikes, especially in oil fields and refineries. He conceded that he had made mistakes and that he had not succeeded in wiping out corruption. He has also failed to form an alliance of South American countries. 

 Chavez wants a Bolivarian Alliance of Americas, a sort of defence and economic pact, to solve the problems of Latin America. This idea was first floated by Bolivar. Chavez quotes a letter which Simon Bolivar wrote in 1824-25: ?The United States of North America seems destined by providence to plague (Latin) America with misery in the name of liberty.? Bolivar had failed to wrest independence in the face of the campaign which saw the US support the Spanish army against the South Americans.

 It is interesting to see anti-imperialism gaining ground under the nose of the US, and that too after communism seems to have been buried in Russia and China.

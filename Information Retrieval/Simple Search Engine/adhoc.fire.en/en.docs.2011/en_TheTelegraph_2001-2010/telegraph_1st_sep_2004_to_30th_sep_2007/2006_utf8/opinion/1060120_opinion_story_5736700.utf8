 Paperback Pickings

 Wine, trivia and the uncanny 

 Rupa?s 

 supernatural omnibus (Rupa, Rs 95) edited 

 by Ruskin Bond is an anthology of what Edith Wharton, 

 one of the writers in it, calls ?queer and inexplicable?. 

 This is a collection of ?tales of the supernatural? from 

 all over the world, and with a wide historical sweep. It 

 was the Romantics, most notably Coleridge, who turned the 

 supernatural into a realm which might be described as an 

 extension of the human or the psychological and the natural, 

 rather than being a parallel universe existing outside them. 

 This collection is full of instances of the ?uncanny? that 

 make our everyday lives more interesting and ?tellable?. 

 There are separate sections on sorcery, apparitions, time-travel, 

 hauntings, vampires and werewolves. There are tales from 

 ancient Greece, Japan, Ireland and China, and by Wharton, 

 Stevenson, Lafcadio Hearn, and Bram Stoker.

 a 

 short history of myth (Penguin, Rs 225) by 

 Karen Armstrong heralds a major series of retellings 

 of ?international myths? by authors from around the world. 

 Armstrong had been a nun for seven years and written about 

 that experience in Through the Narrow Gate in the 

 early Eighties. She has, since then, written readable histories 

 of God, Jerusalem and Islam, and a short account of the 

 life and teachings of the Buddha. For Armstrong, human beings 

 are ?meaning-seeking creatures?, and myth-making springs 

 from this universal trait: ?Myth is about the unknown; it 

 is about that for which initially we have no words. Myth 

 therefore looks into the heart of a great silence.? Armstrong 

 takes us from the Palaeolithic period and the myths of the 

 hunters right up to the ?Great Western Transformation? of 

 the last five hundred years and the discrediting of myth 

 by science. 

 Wine 

 wisdom: buying and drinking wine in india (Penguin, 

 Rs 250) by Magandeep Singh is an interesting 

 little book, laying out the basics of wine for an Indian 

 readership. This includes the history of wine-drinking and 

 its changing trends, a comprehensive list of the major wine 

 brands, the basic rules of serving wine and a glossary of 

 wine-related terms. ?Nobody ever thought that we whisky-soaked 

 Indians would develop a palate for the intricate flavours 

 of wine, but given our rich cultural background and our 

 ability to incorporate and assimilate all things foreign 

 without needing to shake off our indigenous influences, 

 wine can be an easy one to swallow.?

 unforeseen 

 affection and other love poems (Penguin, Rs 250) 

 by Jayaprabha is a parallel text collecting this 

 Hyderabadi poet?s Telugu poems along side their English 

 translations by the late P.V. Narasimha Rao. Poet, critic 

 and journalist, Jayaprabha writes lushly sensuous love poetry, 

 and Rao?s enthusiasm for them does seem a bit difficult 

 to fathom. ?When you plant a kiss on my ear/ passionately.../ 

 my eardrum vibrates,/ cutting through my life?s ends,/ my 

 desire to sleep with you/ touch (sic) my very nerve-centre 

 ?/ Do you know??

 the 

 essential guide to bollywood (Roli Books, Rs 395) 

 by Subhash K. Jha is a useful and entertaining compendium 

 of information based on 200 Hindi films, chosen by Jha, 

 dating back to the Forties. There are trivia, anecdotes 

 and minimal datelines (most useful), together with basic 

 information. There could have been more though, particularly 

 a fuller chronology, connecting release dates with other 

 important events in India. This is a still from Vijaya Mehta?s 

 Pestonjee (1987) with Shabana Azmi, Anupam Kher and 

 Naseeruddin Shah.

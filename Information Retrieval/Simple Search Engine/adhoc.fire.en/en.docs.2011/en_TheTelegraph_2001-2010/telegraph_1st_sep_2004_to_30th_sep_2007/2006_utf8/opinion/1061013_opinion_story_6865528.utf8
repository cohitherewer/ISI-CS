 INTO THE HEART OF THE COMMUNITY

 INBRIEF

DURGA PUJA: CELEBRATING THE GODDESS THEN AND NOW 

 By Sudeshna Banerjee, 

 Rupa, Rs 395

 This is a concise, yet comprehensive history of Durga Puja in Bengal. Lavishly illustrated with colourful photographs, it gives an overview of the various aspects social, economic, religious and ritualistic of this festival. Instead of an account of the anthropological origins and evolution of the Puja, the attempt is to explore its cultural meanings. The emphasis is not on historicizing, but on trying to understand why this festival developed the way it did from colonial to postcolonial times, emerging out of private courtyards on to the streets. It also provides insight into what it means to have the goddess, signifying the triumph of good over evil, at the heart of a communitys moral life.

 EMPIRES OF THE MIND: A HISTORY OF THE OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS IN INDIA UNDER THE RAJ 

 By Rimi B. Chatterjee, 

 Oxford, Rs 795

 The scholarship and research that have gone into this work are deeply impressive. It tells the story of the foundation, development and institutionalization of OUP between 1880-1947. The history of the Press as OUP has always been called by its members is constructed out of numerous archival resources, involving relentless sleuthing for minutiae. This is not just a history of publishing. Rather, it interweaves multiple histories. The development of colonial education policies, politics of readership and an economic history of pre-independence India are concerns as central to the study as the mapping of the history of the book trade. It begins with an account of the modernization of OUP in the 1860s and how it developed, despite severe internal factions, across India. There is a parallel interest in the growth of the press in London, comparing it with the Indian counterparts. The second half of the book deals with histories of individual books, series, authors, publishers, the conception, sales and reception of major publishing ventures. The attempt is to understand the cultural-politics in colonial India through the history of OUP. Written admirably, this is history that makes facts and figures look interesting.

 Changing times

 ST. STEPHENS COLLEGE A HISTORY 

 By Ashok Jaitly, 

 Roli, Rs 395

 This is a history of an institution, noted for academic excellence since its inception, by one of its alumnus. Published to commemorate the 125th anniversary of its foundation, it is a veritable storehouse of anecdotal history alongside serious meditations on the way this college has influenced intellectual life in India. It traces the history of St Stephens from its conception by the Cambridge Mission in 1881, through the years of freedom struggle, Partition and Independence up to the present. The political and social excitements of the earlier years descend into brazen competitiveness generated by relentless academic pressure, striving for sporting excellence, and acquiring prestigious scholarships to study abroad. The tradition that celebrated iconoclasm and cosmopolita- nism seems to have declined imperceptibly, transformed by over-reaching ambition and materialism, the inevitable pitfalls of globalization.

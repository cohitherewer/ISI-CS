 THE MARKET, MEDIA AND MORE

 New tidings

 Book publishing became an integral part of the communications industry in 2006. That is, the dividing line between books and the media newspapers, magazines, supplements, TV channels and FM radio stations became more and more blurred with no clear hierarchy between them. The media borrowed ideas from books, and publishers, in turn, dipped heavily into the media to learn what interested the mass market. A convergence that had been on the cards for sometime was finally crystallized this year. 

 Part of the reason was the rapid development in print and communications, especially the internet, which led to a vast expansion and diversification of media outlets with simultaneous publications in different parts of the country. Quite apart from the fact that the growth of the media produced an inexhaustible appetite for raw material, the technology demanded that copy was short and sweet because timing was of crucial importance for the success of any publication.

 Who called the shots trends of the mass market as reflected in the media, or the traditional evaluation of what is a good copy? The market decided the kind of books that needed to be published.

 Books written for the common reader had to be a sub-division of the entertainment industry that would also spin off into films, sitcoms and so on. Or, books had to be targeted for niche markets. These could be anything from educational books, in the widest sense of the term, to DIY manuals, cookbooks, travel guides and so on. Anything and everything was on, as long as the market was clearly identified. To illustrate the recipe for the common reader, take the following English language bestsellers of 2006: Pervez Musharrafs In the Line of Fire, Kiran Desais The Inheritance of Loss, Pradip Kishens Trees of Delhi, Edward Luces In Spite of the Gods, Jaswant Singhs A Call to Honour, William Dalrymples The Last Mughal, Amartya Sens Identity and Violence and Vikram Chandras Sacred Games. These books were meant for the common reader, the middle class with a disposable income. Each of these has sold more than 10,000 copies and will remain on the shelves for a while which is pretty good for the Indian market.

 With the sole exception of Sens Identity and Violence, the non-fiction list can be described as faction: part fact, part fiction, or the artful mixing of both. We are anchored in historical fact but the factual references dont weigh too heavily on the mind or interrupt the flow of the narrative. Though we know there are facts and then there are facts, we let them pass because otherwise they would rob us of the fun. This is particularly true for Musharrafs memoir where a mix of facts and fantasy provides entertainment. Desais Inheritance of Loss is part autobiography, totally transformed (as all fiction is), and Chandras Bombay underworld tells us where the lice lurks, though it could have been cut to half and made twice as good.

 So what can we expect in 2007? More entertainment, more gossip, led by Rajmohan Gandhis Mohandas on the Mahatmas love affair with Tagores niece, Saraladevi.

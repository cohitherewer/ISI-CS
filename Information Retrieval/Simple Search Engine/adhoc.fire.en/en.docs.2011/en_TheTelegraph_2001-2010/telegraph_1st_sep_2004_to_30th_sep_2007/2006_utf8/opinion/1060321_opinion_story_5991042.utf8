The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WINSOME

 Elections are as much about winning friends as about confusing enemies. In Assam, Mr Tarun Gogoi seems to have done both with considerable success. Five years of his rule saw large sections of the people drifting away from the Congress. Two communities in particular ? the tribal people working in the tea gardens and the Muslims ? posed serious problems for the party. Both were traditional vote-banks of the Congress, but resented the government?s indifference to their grievances. The state?s tea industry has long been facing a crisis, which sometimes resulted in violence in the gardens. The Assam tea tribes students? association had threatened to oppose the Congress in the elections. Mr Gogoi has done well to woo the association back into the party?s fold. His attempts to win back the support of the Muslims have not been as successful though. And this despite the fact that the Centre?s recent amendment of the Foreigners? Act was clearly aimed at helping the Congress in the polls. But the division in the political loyalties of the Muslims should help the Congress to an extent. The chief minister?s other major worry should be the public perception about corruption in his government. He has clearly failed to keep his promise of acting firmly and decisively against corrupt ministers and officials. 

 However, Mr Gogoi?s biggest advantage is a confused and disunited opposition. The two main opposition parties ? the Asom Gana Parishad and the Bharatiya Janata Party ? which had made a common cause against the Congress in the past few elections, have drifted away from each other. The BJP is now forced to go it alone. That may not help it win many seats, but it will surely weaken the opposition?s chances of defeating the Congress. The AGP, too, has lost much of its credibility as a possible alternative to the Congress. The party is weakened by factional rivalries and a loss of direction. Its alliance with the two communist parties and an umbrella organization of the Muslims is too undefined to be a serious challenge to the Congress. It has some political significance though, as it is the left?s first experiment at forming a ?third front? to fight both the Congress and the BJP. It is possible that the people in Assam would give the Congress another term in office than suffer another stint of political instability. After all, peace is their biggest stake in the polls.

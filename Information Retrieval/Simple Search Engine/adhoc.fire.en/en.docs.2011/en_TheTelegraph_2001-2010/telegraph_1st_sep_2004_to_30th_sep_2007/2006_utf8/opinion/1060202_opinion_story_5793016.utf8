 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 A last principle to be mentioned here concerns the drive for universal coverage, that is, the need to extend labour inspection?s protective and preventive action to the largest possible number of working people in all areas of activity. In principle, society should not, and labour inspection cannot tolerate a situation where certain categories of workers are protected and others not.

 Labour inspection is also based on the notion of solidarity and respect for the collective values of society. That is why labour inspection systems in many countries have in recent times extended their coverage in various directions traditionally not under their responsibility, such as government administrations..., rural workpeople, the self-employed, the ?informal? sector, etc. Some systems even go beyond the confines of formal employment relationships, to include in their responsibilities the protection of any member of public affected by work activities.

 ...The sources of labour inspection authority are to be found in a comprehensive set of international labour standards. The concept of labour inspection as developed by the tripartite constituents of the ILO is that of a system embedded in a larger system of national labour administration. The ILO convention on labour administration, 1978, entrusts member states with the obligation to establish a system of labour administration, encompassing all aspects and institutions of national labour policy...Within this system, consultation, cooperation and negotiation with employers? and workers? organizations must be ensured.

 Convention No. 150 sets out the functions of labour administration: preparation, administration, coordination, checking and review of national labour policy, preparation and implementation of laws and regulations, tasks in relation to national employment policy, conditions of work and working life, terms of employment, services and advice to employers and workers and their organizations, etc. The staff of the labour administration system must be composed of persons who are suitably qualified and independent of improper external influences. The extension of labour administration services to workers who are not, in law, employed persons, is to be promoted.

 Three specific conventions and a protocol then deal exclusively with issues of labour inspection: ILO conventions Nos. 81 (1947) and 129 (1969), on labour inspection in industry and commerce (as well as mining and transport), and agriculture respectively. The protocol of 1995 to convention No. 81 covers the ?non-commercial services? sector. A special convention (No. 178, 1996) addresses labour inspection of seafarers? living and working conditions. Other ILO standards, such as the plantations Convention, 1958 (No. 110), have specific chapters on labour inspection, or make reference to the need for such a service to enforce relevant provisions.

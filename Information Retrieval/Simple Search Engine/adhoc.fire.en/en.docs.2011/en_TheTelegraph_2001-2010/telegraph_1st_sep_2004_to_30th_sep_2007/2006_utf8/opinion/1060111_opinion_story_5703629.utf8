 FROM BUTCHER TO PEACEMAKER

 Achin Vanaik looks at the mythification of Ariel Sharon from a once-ruthless warrior to one of the greatest statesman of the millennium

 Peace by piece

 We are now in the midst of the creation of an utterly false myth ? that of Ariel Sharon (possibly on his deathbed) as the once ruthless warrior-turned-statesman and peacemaker. It is a myth being assiduously cultivated by much of the Israeli media and public, by Western governments and their mainstream media. It will no doubt find its reflection here in India as well. Yes, Sharon was the ?Butcher of Beirut? whom the Israeli Kahane commission found responsible for the massacres in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila in Lebanon, and declared that he should not hold public office again.

 Yes, by taking armed troops to the al-Aqsa Mosque on September 28, 2000, Sharon, in effect, declared to Palestinians that not even their most holy shrines were exempt from the arrogance of military occupation, thus provoking the second intifada. But his major claim to statesmanship is supposed to be his ?courage? and ?farsightedness? in carrying out against extreme rightwing opposition the withdrawal of all Israeli settlers from the Gaza Strip thereby taking a crucial step towards a peace settlement.

 Before examining the real meaning of the Gaza withdrawal,we should remind ourselves that the day before his stroke, Sharon was formally accused by the police of taking a $3 million bribe from a casino owner. Now for the true significance of the Gaza withdrawal. During the same period that the Sharon government vacated 19 square kilometers of the Gaza Strip and evacuated around 8,000 settlers, it annexed another 23 sq km land in the West Bank and settled around 14,500 Israelis in the West Bank. During this period, the building of the Separation Wall, approximately 70 per cent of which is not on the Green Line (1967 border), was nearly completed. This wall has created a new ?fact on the ground? that Palestinians will be pressured to accept permanently. Sharon has also consolidated the takeover of East Jerusalem, despite its illegality, and has never wavered in declaring that East Jerusalem will never be returned.

 The Rafah crossing is indirectly controlled by Israel despite the presence of Egyptians. All other entry and exit points into Gaza are controlled by Israel, which can cut off electricity and water to Gaza whenever it wants. There is, of course, no compensation whatsoever for the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza caused by Israeli governments. On the other hand, the Israeli settlers were financially supported to settle in Gaza and also financially compensated for withdrawing. 

 What has happened in Gaza, of course, is not a reduction of colonial control or a diminution of the occupation. It has been a rearrangement of the occupation. In return for this rearrangement, Sharon?s government got powerful backing for its colonial control of the West Bank. The United States of America declared for the first time that an Israeli return to pre-1967 borders is unrealistic. Despite its international illegality, the US will not demand dismantlement of the Separation Wall. In short, the kudos Sharon has earned from the Gaza withdrawal have covered up his annexations in the West Bank and strengthened his hand regarding future plans for the West Bank.

 The only thing Sharon has given up through the Gaza withdrawal is his earlier ambition to have an Eretz or Greater Israel, which meant not only the permanent and total occupation of Gaza and the West Bank, but even the option of going beyond this to take over other lands. The fact that Sharon has done everything unilaterally, and with endorsement from other powerful countries, is also import. This marks the emergence of a new phase in the overall strategy of Israeli vis-?-vis the occupied territories. The first phase ? 1967 to the Oslo Accords of 1993 ? was the period of direct colonial occupation and rule. The second phase was from 1993 to the collapse of the Oslo Accords in 2001 and Sharon?s accession to power. This was the period of the subcontracting of colonial rule. The Palestinian Authority would now take on the responsibility for much of the policing and control functions in the occupied territories, allowing the Israelis to maintain overall control at reduced risk and cost. The PA would, in return, get money from the taxes on Palestinians working but not domiciled in Israel, as also from the European Union and other sources.

 It would also have opportunities to make money from corruption. And it would get deceitful promises of eventual freedom. The Taba and Camp David talks were always fundamentally fraudulent despite the hype about how close they came to a ?decent? settlement. In the third phase initiated by Sharon, the new strategy is unilateralism and separation. While in the previous phases Israelis and Palestinians could not but interact in numerous ways, the aim now is to separate Palestinians in the occupied territories, both socially and economically from Israelis. This is the attempted creation of an ?apartheid solution? in its most extreme form.

 If Abu Mazen was once seen by Israel and the US as ?their best bet?, given the pressures on him from within Palestinian society, he cannot be trusted to deliver a Bantustan solution through negotiation. So Israel under Sharon and his acolytes will try and create conditions for any future ?peace settlement?. Israel will annex even more territory for its major settlement blocs (sacrificing minor settlements) and leave 8 or 9 enclaves for the Palestinians in the West Bank possibly connected by bridges and tunnels. No East Jerusalem, no right of return for Palestinian refugees, no control over water supplies or air space, no army, no port. This is the Sharon legacy that eventually will be on offer to Palestinians and they can call this miserable farce a sovereign state if they so wish. That an increasing number of Israelis have seen Sharon as a potential peacemaker is a reflection of their desire for peace but on their own terms, and also of their moral insensitivity to Palestinians. But then only such a collective moral debasement can explain why leaders like Sharon could continue with what is now the longest illegal military occupation of the last 100 years.

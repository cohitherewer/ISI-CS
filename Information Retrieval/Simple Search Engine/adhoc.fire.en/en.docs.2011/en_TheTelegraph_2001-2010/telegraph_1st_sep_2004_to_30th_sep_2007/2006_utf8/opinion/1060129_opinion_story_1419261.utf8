 Letters to Editor

 All for show

 Sir ? The Padma Shri awarded to Sania Mirza is unwarranted. She has been on the circuit for barely two years and her achievements are far too meagre to justify the award. In the current Australian Open, she lost to a lower ranked player in the second round itself. For a youngster, she is far too injury-prone and she definitely lacks power play, a must in today?s tennis. Many of the current stars have won grand slams when they were younger than her. Sania Mirza?s fame is a media creation. The sooner it is destroyed, the better for her.

 Yours faithfully,

Shanmugam Mudaliar, Pune

 Speak out

 Sir ? That the speaker of the Lok Sabha, Somnath Chatterjee, had to take the help of the civic chief of Guskara, and that the municipality chairman himself had to call up the Government Railway Police to wrest back the reserved seat of the speaker?s daughter, say volumes about the state of affairs in West Bengal (?Train seat mafia in VIP misfire?, Jan 24). The presence of policemen alone did not seem to have helped. They had to be accompanied by the leftist cadre to defend Biswas and her troupe. 

 Chatterjee, obviously, does not have any confidence in the GRP personnel, nor does he have the courage to lodge a formal complaint for the fear that it would make a dent on his party?s vote bank. Incidentally, Chatterjee has not even bothered to formally protest against the regular travel of second-class ticket holders in first class compartments. He has thus accepted that lawlessness is the order of the day and that there is no help available for the ordinary people. The result is obvious ? the GRP officer-in-charge of Burdwan insists that such seat mafias do not exist. Passengers with reserved tickets will continue to be at the mercy of rowdies till a victim?s father turns out to be another influential man.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? When Anushila Biswas gets abused and heckled by daily passengers on the train, the administration immediately responds to a phone call from her father, the speaker of the Lok Sabha and a veteran Marxist. But when equally vulnerable passengers on the Coalfield Express, Black Diamond Express, Agnibeena Express, Santiniketan Express and some other trains are harassed day after day, the administration prefers to remain silent. Law-abiding citizens, despite having valid tickets, are intimidated by daily passengers into giving up seats they have paid for. It will be foolish to assume that an apology to the speaker?s daughter will end this menace for scores of other hapless travellers with no political connections.

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Sodepur

 Magic baton

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s description of the concert in New Delhi makes one want to belong to that city (?Zubin Mehta in concert?, Jan 1). In Calcutta one rarely gets a chance to listen to Western classical music conducted by a high-profile maestro like Mehta, although there is no dearth of music-lovers here. The last time Mehta performed in Delhi, a lady from the VIP enclosure is supposed to have asked why the man with the baton was only showing the audience his back.

Yours faithfully, 

Manojendu Majumdar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The performances by the Bavarian State Orchestra in Chennai and New Delhi have a special significance for a region passing through turbulent times. In both places Zubin Mehta left his audience filled with a sense of peace. If Mehta?s intention had been to provide solace to the people, then it was fulfilled. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.C. Bose, Calcutta

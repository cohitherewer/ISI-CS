 HOUSE PROUD

 There is something strange about the political centre of a republic being divided into upper and lower. And it was not quite in a republican spirit that Ms Jaya Bachchan lamented recently, ?It?s a shame that people like us are not allowed to sit in Parliament.? She is referring here to the Rajya Sabha, and the ?us? means herself, a Padma Shri, and her husband and father-in-law, both Padma Bhushans. In spite of such illustriousness, Ms Bachchan could lose her seat in the Rajya Sabha because she had continued to hold an office of profit after her election. This is the Election Commission?s recommendation to the president who is bound by this. And it would be difficult for Ms Bachchan to sustain her claim that the move is politically motivated. This is a breach of the rules and the EC is right to have pointed that out. It is quite pointless on the part of the Samajwadi Party, therefore, to try politicizing the issue. It would be equally a waste of time if Ms Bachchan decides to move the Supreme Court.

 As during the debates on the residence clause (which implicated none less than the prime minister) or modes of electing members so as to prevent cross-voting and other forms of corruption, what such incidents and issues seem to underline is the peculiar nature of the Rajya Sabha in relation to the Westminster parliamentary model as well as the American senate. The former aligns it with the House of Lords, which protects the interests of the Crown. So the idea of the Rajya Sabha representing the interests of the states was adopted from the American model. The rise of the regional parties in the states has also added a new and interesting dimension to the politics of representation in the upper house. There is always a risk of the Rajya Sabha becoming a space for the doling out of patronage to loyals. Given the prevalence of such abuse, and also the inherent anomalous nature in the very idea of a ?house of elders? for a republic, it would be a good idea to think of a different kind of a house altogether, election to which might be based on merit and not pedigree.

 Letters to Editor

 On the right track

 Sir ? St Xavier?s college has been able to achieve autonomy status at last (?It?s official, Xavier?s first to wrest autonomy stamp?, March 7). This positive move, on the part of the UGC, will keep the college authorities on their toes to ensure that the institution retains its eminent position. The precedent set should encourage other colleges to strive for similar rank. Perhaps the UGC should also do something to lessen the number of colleges affiliated to the Calcutta university so that the institution can impart quality education.

 Yours faithfully,

 Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Unfinished business

 Sir ? K.J. Rao, an advisor appointed by the Election Commission, who is credited with conducting free and fair elections in Jammu and Kashmir and Bihar has decided to quit (?Rao Quits?, March 5). People in West Bengal had hoped that Rao?s presence would help them rid the state of the communists. But his departure has now put paid to their hopes of a regime change in the state. Why can?t the EC appoint more officials like Rao who could have helped us win freedom from the misrule of communists? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ajay Kumar Mandhyan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Though K.J. Rao has decided to call it a day, he will be best remembered as the person who changed the face of elections in Bihar. Not only that, Rao also had the rare honour of being appointed as an international observer during the elections in the United States of America. During his rather short stint as the poll observer for West Bengal, Rao had tried his best to do away with the malpractices that were rampant in the state. We salute Rao whose commitment helped him stand out from the rest.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? The resignation of K.J. Rao signals the end of an era in the history of the commission. Rao?s legacy ? the methods and approaches to ensure peaceful elections ? needs to be carried forward. The Bihar elections were the biggest feather on Rao?s cap. During the elections in Bihar, Rao had shown the world, as well as Indian politicians, how to conduct elections that were not rigged. He was a fearless and hard-working individual and a role model who should be emulated by other government officers in the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sampath S. Chakravarti, Bangalore

 Sir ? That the Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary, Anil Biswas, is a relieved man after the resignation of K.J. Rao is apparent from the praise that he showered on the latter. However, what remains a mystery is why Rao decided to put in his papers in the first place even before Bengal went to polls. Rao?s resignation raises suspicions that the left leaders in the state have arrived at an understanding with those in power at the Centre. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Maitra, Agarpara 

 Sir ? According to one school of thought, K.J. Rao was finding the going tough in West Bengal due to the lack of cooperation from the left parties in the state. Isn?t it a pity that West Bengal has been ruled by the Left Front for close to three decades now? This is hardly good news for a democracy. One only hopes that a new party would come to power after elections are over. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shiv Shanker Almal, Calcutta

 Sir ? Honest government officials are not allowed to carry on their good work for long. Did Rao have to leave because he ended up stealing the thunder from his own bosses?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sen, Calcutta

 Fishing in troubled waters

 Sir ? The photograph of the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, holding a hilsa at a ceremony to felicitate the seventh Left Front government, was amusing (May 15). It would have been more apt if the organizers had gifted him a chara pona instead, as that is the only affordable fish for most Bengali households now ? with ponds being filled up by left-backed realtors and most of the state?s fish going out of the state. Before celebrating with a hilsa, Bhattacharjee should ensure that other Bengalis also get to see this fish occasionally on their plates. 

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Rule of the corrupt

 Sir ? In recent times, the authorities issuing passports have been heard to make tall claims about the speed and efficiency in the issuing of document. I, however, had a very different experience when I wanted to get myself a passport. I applied in November, 2005. My application number is 590658. I waited for months without getting any response from the issuing authorities. I did not even get an acknowledgement of receipt of my application, nor a key number which would enable me to check online the status of my passport. Finally, I got a call from the Asansol DIV office for the verification of documents. The clearance certificate was sent by the same office on March 5, 2006. Two months have passed after that and I am yet to get a passport. I sent a reminder to the Regional Passport Office in Calcutta on April 24, 2006, through registered post, so I know that it was received at the office. But even after all this, my wait continues and I wonder if I will get to see my passport in my lifetime. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mamta Sinha, Chittaranjan

 Sir ? I had applied for a passport on May 31, 2005 and had duly submitted all the required documents along with the stipulated fee. The police visited my residence for the verification of the documents and took away Rs 100 as bribe from me. Later, the police called me and said that they needed to verify my birthplace. This was difficult, since I no longer stayed at the place where I was born, and my parents, who could have testified to my statement, were no more. I told the police that I could prove my current residence in Uttarpara with a house rent receipt but the police maintained that unless I dole out more money, I would not get my passport. I was not in a position to pay the demanded price, and so the fate of my passport still hangs in balance. The officers at the passport office were rude when I inquired about the status of my passport, and told me that my application had been invalidated, so I would have to apply again.

 Clearly, the police and passport officials are there to make some quick money. This is disgraceful, given that passports are an essential document and people usually need to have them in time. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Bidya Ashok, Calcutta

 Sir ? The harassment that an average Indian tourist experiences in trying to obtain a Schengen visa is appalling. The officials at the visa office seem to think that all Indian applicants, irrespective of their age or previous travel history, are potential illegal immigrants, or terrorists ? and therefore, not fit for the basic forms of courtesy. In defence of their behaviour, the officials say that they have to restrict the number of Indians and south Asians trying to get into the European countries. This is a lame excuse. From the detailed personal data on the visa application form and from the travel pattern marked out in the passports, the officials can easily separate the genuine tourists from the rest. 

 Granting visas may be the discretion of countries, but that does not mean that the officials can be impolite with visa-seekers. The Indian government officials should take up this matter with their EU counterparts.

 Yours faithfully, 

 H.P. Mitra, Calcutta

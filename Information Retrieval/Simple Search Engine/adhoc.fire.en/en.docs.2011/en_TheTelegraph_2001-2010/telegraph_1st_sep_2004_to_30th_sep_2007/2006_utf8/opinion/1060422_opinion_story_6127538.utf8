 ITSY BITSY TEENIE WEENIE

 Historically speaking, the bikini is a bad joke. Sixty years after its invention, political correctness and the end of the Cold War have made that sort of humour all but impossible to carry off. In 1946, when Louis R?ard, a French engineer, strayed into designing a two-piece swimsuit out of 30 square inches of fabric, he looked around for a brand name. The Americans had just been testing nuclear nasties around the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. They had unceremoniously evacuated the inhabitants of one of the Micronesian reefs, called Bikini Atoll, and launched Operation Crossroads in March 1946 for ?the good of mankind and to end all world wars?. ?I am not an atomic playboy,? the commander of the operation assured the king of the Bikinians, who announced to his subjects, ?We will all go believing that everything is in the hands of God.? 

 As the Bikinians, exiled in another barren atoll, ran out of food and started starving to death, 42,000 US military and civilian personnel carried out two atomic bomb blasts in the ocean. Each was about the size of the Nagasaki bomb. They were followed by Bravo, the hydrogen bomb, in March 1954, releasing phenomenal quantities of radiation into the little world of the Bikinians. The rest is an ugly history of nuclear imperialism, the slow radiation of the Bikinians and their habitat, and their political struggle for reparation.

 The French swimsuit designer snatched at this glamorous catastrophe for his product, and the name caught on. ?The bikini isn?t a bikini,? R?ard declared, ?unless it can be pulled through a wedding ring.? Around the same time, another Frenchman, Jacques Heim, created his own two-piece design and described it as the ?world?s smallest bathing suit?. Bizarrely enough, he called it the ?Atome?. Quickly, the bikini became dernier cri on the Riviera, and crossed the Atlantic within a year. Vogue and the Vatican disapproved; Esther Williams thought it was ?a thoughtless act?; and it was banned at the 1951 Miss World pageant. But the Sixties and the Seventies made it iconic, with help from Brigitte Bardot in And God Created Woman, Ursula Andress in Dr No, Sharmila Tagore in An Evening in Paris and Dimple Kapadia in Bobby. Raquel Welch wore a fur bikini (and mascara) as a Stone Age cave-girl in One Million Years B.C. There were endless innovations: made entirely out of red hair or porcupine quills, or with propellers attached to the bra cups, and of course, the Brazilian ?dental-floss? thong and Chanel?s infamous ?eye-patch? bikini.

 But it was Brian Hyland?s 1960 song, ?Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini?, which perfectly captured the sexy distress and sublime silliness that characterize the bikini chic. It sings of a woman who has worn the eponymous bikini for the first time in her life: ?Now she?s afraid to come out of the water/ And I wonder what she?s gonna do/ Now she?s afraid to come out of the water/ And the poor little girl?s turning blue.?

 AROUND THE TABLE

 Gwynne Dyer

 When I came out of the house this morning, Jean-Baptiste was standing in the road gazing into the field opposite with a worried expression. He had lost two cows, he said. 

 Jean-Baptiste is what polite people no longer call a peasant. He lives in a big farmhouse in the Basque-speaking part of France. He is seventy years old, and has only seven cows. But they live well, and all their children and grandchildren still live within reach of them, mostly in very beautiful places.

 This is la France profonde ? deepest France ? and fifty years ago, it was desperately poor. Now it allows families like Jean-Baptiste?s a modest contentment, and in return they keep France looking like the dream of rural bliss that the urban multitudes expect. And how does he achieve all this with a couple of stony hillside pastures, seven cows, and some chickens? The common agricultural policy, of course.

 France has defended the CAP tooth and nail for many years, although it subsidizes the European Union?s farmers outrageously. But at the G8 summit in St. Petersburg earlier this month, the EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson, offered a 51 per cent cut in EU tariffs on agricultural imports in order to keep the faltering world trade talks alive. French President Jacques Chirac left the meeting fuming.

 America yielded some ground on agricultural protectionism too, offering to cap subsidies to its farmers at $15 billion compared to its previous offer of $22.5 billion. All this would theoretically help developing countries trade their way out of poverty by exporting food to the rich countries. In return, India and Brazil, representing the developing countries, said they would cut tariffs on imports of manufactured goods to 20 per cent from the current average of 30 per cent. So the Doha round stumbled on ? until last Monday.

 End game

 The six negotiators at Geneva ? from the US, the EU, Japan, Australia, Brazil and India ? had only a month to reach a deal. They would have then had to sell it to the WTO?s other 143 members, and President Bush?s authority to ?fast-track? a deal through the US Congress (thus avoiding death by a thousand amendments) expires next year. But they had barely sat down around the table again before it became clear that the promises made at St. Petersburg would not be kept. Predictably, it was agriculture that proved the stumbling block.

 At this point in articles on world trade, we are customarily told that the Uruguay round of talks, concluded in 1993, began the globalization that underpins our current prosperity, and that the Doha round, under negotiation since 2001, was vital to maintain the momentum. Or else we are told that globalization has hurt the poor, and that this round must come out differently or they are doomed. But this is mostly hot air.

 Easier access to European and North American markets would not have helped poor farmers in Africa or India; rather, it would have allowed rich farmers to buy up their land and turn them into urban poor. On the other hand, lowering the barriers against cheap food imports from the third world does not have to destroy the lifestyle of people like Jean-Baptiste. Just admit that you are really subsidizing lifestyle and countryside, not food, and find a different way of getting the money to them.

 As for the benefits of freer trade, it was beneficial for rich countries when they could set the terms in their own favour, but now that developing countries can hold their own at the bargaining table, they are less enthusiastic. The US has almost given up on multilateral trade deals, preferring bilateral deals where it can still use its size to shape the outcome. Many insist that the Doha round is not irrevocably dead, but it almost certainly is. The world isn?t necessarily heading for Thirties-style trade wars, but the golden age of multilateralism is past.

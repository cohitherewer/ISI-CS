 OF NATURE AND POETRY 

Telling Tales / Amit Chaudhuri

 Nature?s malignant forces 

Tagore?s deployment of nature in his politics and 

aesthetics is as ideological as Ted Hughes?s, and has equally to do with nationality; 

but it moves in the opposite direction, critiquing imperialism while overturning 

the verities that we?ve now come to associate with post-colonial writing and identity. 

If Tagore were to fit in with our stock idea of the post-colonial writer, he would 

have enlisted the wildness of nature, of the indigenous landscape, as a trope 

of resistance against European civilization and the Enlightenment. Instead, for 

Tagore, nature is the site of civilization, refinement, and of certain ideals 

of the secular enlightenment, such as the ideal of living in harmony with the 

world: and it?s a specifically Indian location for these things. Tagore, audaciously, 

not so much critiques the Western enlightenment and humanism, and the idea of 

?civilization? itself, but snatches them away from their expected location and 

gives to them another source and lineage in India and its antiquity; cheekily, 

he implies this lineage might be the more authentic one. Here, both nature and 

Kalidasa ? for him, the ur-poet of the physical world ? are crucial to his purposes. 

Tagore?s engagement with Kalidasa is all the more astonishing when we think of 

Chakrabarty?s honest, if remorseful, admission that modern Indian intellectuals 

are unable to enter into a fruitful dialogue with their forbears; for the dialogue 

Tagore has with Kalidasa is not just instinctive and emotional, but pressing and 

contemporary. We begin to understand, as we read him theorizing about nature and 

the Sanskrit poet, the radically revisionist nature of his project ? not only 

to insert the Orient into Western humanism, but to subsume the more true, the 

more humane, tradition of humanism under the Orient. 

 Towards the end of an essay, ?The Religion of the 

Forest? (not included in the OUP translations), Tagore reflects on two broad, 

and conflicting, civilizational impulses: ?When, in my recent voyage to Europe, 

our ship left Aden and sailed along the sea which lay between the two continents, 

we passed by the red and barren rocks of Arabia on our right side and the gleaming 

sands of Egypt on our left. They seemed to me like two giant brothers exchanging 

with each other burning glances of hatred, kept apart by the tearful entreaty 

of the sea from whose womb they had their birth.? 

For Tagore, ?the two shores spoke to me of two different 

historical dramas enacted?. In Egypt, he sees a civilization that grew around 

a ?noble river, which spread the festivities of life on its banks across the heart 

of the land. There man never raised the barrier of alienation between himself 

and the rest of the world.? On the other hand, on ?the opposite shore of the Red 

Sea the civilization which grew up in the inhospitable soil of Arabia had a contrary 

character to that of Egypt. There man felt himself isolated in hostile and bare 

surroundings.? And so, his mind ?naturally dwelt upon the principle of separateness. 

It roused in him the spirit of fight, and this spirit was a force that drove him 

far and wide?. For Tagore, these ?two civilizations represented two fundamental 

divisions of human nature. The one contained in it the spirit of conquest and 

the other the spirit of harmony.? Tagore concludes that ?both of these have their 

truth and purpose in human nature?. 

It?s clear, however, which side Tagore is on, and 

what the purpose of this elaborate meditation is. ?Egypt? is a trope for the Orient, 

?Arabia? for the colonizer, and, therefore, by extension, of the West. (Tagore 

is not the first Indian poet to view the Arab as a ?conqueror?; Henry Vivian Derozio, 

an important but comparatively minor figure of the early 19th century, does the 

same. It?s something they inherited from the work of the early British Orientalists; 

but since both Derozio and, here, Tagore, turned the Arab into a covert trope 

for the English colonizer, it?s something they also turn against the people they 

inherited it from.) That Tagore means the English colonizer is left in no doubt 

if one looks at the textual analysis that he undertakes in most of this essay, 

a comparison between literary responses to nature in English and in Sanskrit. 

The English works mainly comprise Shakespeare, who is found wanting: ?In The 

Tempest, through Prospero?s treatment of Ariel and Caliban we realize man?s 

struggle with Nature and his longing to sever connection with her.? In Macbeth, 

all we evidently get of the non-human world is a ?barren heath where the three 

witches appear as personifications of Nature?s malignant forces?; in King Lear, 

?the storm on the heath? is a symbol of the human tumult enacted in the play. 

Moreover, the ?tragic intensity of Hamlet and Othello is unrelieved 

by any touch of Nature?s eternity?. Tagore glances at play after play, before 

judiciously washing his hands of both the English poet and the culture he belongs 

to: ?I hope it is needless for me to say that these observations are not intended 

to minimize Shakespeare?s great power as a dramatic poet but to show in his works 

the gulf between Nature and human nature owing to the tradition of his race and 

time.? Not even Milton is exempt; although the ?very subject? of Paradise Lost 

? man dwelling in the garden of Paradise ? seems to afford a special opportunity 

for bringing out the true greatness of man?s relationship with nature, Tagore 

detects a disturbing element of mastery in Milton?s account of that relationship: 

?Bird, beast, insect or worm / Durst enter none, such was their awe of man.? 

As Tagore reads these poets, he seems to argue that 

Western humanism ? and its idea of ?civilization? ? is complicated, and compromised, 

by its compulsion to dominate and colonize nature. It?s a conclusion remarkably 

similar to D.H. Lawrence?s Etruscan Places; Lawrence?s metaphors for colonizer 

and colonized are the Romans and the Etruscans respectively, where the former?s 

civilization is marked by territorial conquest and the domination of nature, the 

latter?s by its investment in agricultural and spiritual regeneration. Extraordinarily, 

in his essay, Tagore notes a particular break in the English imagination after 

the Renaissance with the advent of Romanticism; the break is characterized by 

a new relationship to nature, a new definition of the human, and its source, Tagore 

claims, is the Orient: ?We observe a completely different attitude of mind in 

the later English poets like Wordsworth and Shelley, which can be attributed in 

the main to the great mental change in Europe, at that particular period through 

the influence of the newly discovered philosophy of India which stirred the soul 

of Germany and aroused the attention of other Western countries.? 

Tagore, in spite of his use of the word ?philosophy?, 

is not so much thinking of Max Mueller, Schiller, Schelling, and German Indology 

here, but of nature and poetry, of Kalidasa, and of Goethe?s enthusiasm for the 

Sakuntala. This is more than Tagore?s version of what Schwab called the 

?correction and expansion of the old humanism of the Mediterranean basin?; it?s 

a wresting of the humanist and civilizational initiative from the West. Tagore, 

then, is not as interested in critiquing the Western Enlightenment in the now-familiar 

post-colonial manner, as he is in relocating its original impetus in the Orient 

and in India. This relocation, of course, was an obsession with a branch of Orientalist 

scholarship, and with figures like William Jones; but, while the Orientalists 

were content to discern certain features of the Enlightenment in Indian antiquity, 

Tagore wants to trace a lineage from antiquity to modernity, from Kalidasa to, 

specifically, himself, and to use that lineage to rebuff the colonizer. For these 

purposes, Kalidasa and Shakespeare and their imaginative relationships with nature 

continue to be contrasted strategically by Tagore; his own advocacy of Kalidasa 

is also shrewd and strategic, besides being passionate.

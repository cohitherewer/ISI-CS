 TORCHLIGHT ON A BLINDFOLDED FACE 

By trying to keep the truth about missing militants 

and death squads under wraps, the defence establishment is seriously harming the 

cause of peace in Assam, writes Sanjib Baruah

 Information denied 

Citizens eager to see the return of peace and stability 

in Assam tend to pin their hopes on the likelihood of negotiations between the 

United Liberation Front of Asom and the government of India. However, in the long 

run, two sets of legal proceedings currently under way in Guwahati might prove 

more important for the prospects for peace in Assam.

A two-member bench of the Guwahati high court with 

the chief justice, B.S. Reddy, and the judge, B.P. Kotoky, has taken up the case 

of missing Ulfa militants turned over by the Bhutanese authorities to the Indian 

army after the Bhutanese armys operations in December, 2003. Simultaneously, 

a commission appointed by the Assam government and headed by the retired judge, 

K.N. Saikia, is holding hearings on the secret killings between 1998 and 2001 

that were ostensibly a part of the governments counter-insurgency operations. 

The judiciary should be congratulated for trying hard 

to create conditions conducive to the return of peace to Assam. Unfortunately, 

the same cannot be said of the executive branch especially the defence establishment 

and a senior Indian police service official. The defence ministry has asserted 

that the list of militants handed over to India by Bhutan is a privileged document 

that should not be made public, while the amicus curiae appointed by the 

court argues that not making that information public will lead to a denial of 

justice.

The most significant potential witness who has failed 

to show up before the Saikia commission so far is G.M. Srivastava Assams inspector 

general of police (operations) during the years when the secret killings took 

place. Now the director general of police in Tripura, he is apparently too busy 

to come to Guwahati and give his deposition. He has proposed a date for his deposition 

that coincides with end of the commissions term.

The potential role of public sentiments in bringing 

about sustainable peace tends to be forgotten when the focus is entirely on the 

prospect of negotiations between the Ulfa and the government. Few would dispute 

that it is important for the government to win the battle for hearts and minds. 

But there is little appreciation of the role that procedural justice could play 

in that battle.

The Guwahati high court has acted on the case of the 

missing militants as the result of a habeas corpus petition by Shyamoli 

Gogoi, wife of the Ulfa leader, Prakash Gogoi, who was taken captive by the Bhutanese 

army and handed over to the Indian army in December, 2003. 

In response to the high court, the ministry of defence 

has sent an affidavit signed by the defence secretary, Sekhar Dutt, citing Section 

123 of the Evidence Act to plead that the list should not be made public. No one 

is permitted under that section to give evidence derived from unpublished official 

records relating to any affairs of State without permission from the head of 

the department. Making that list public, says the defence ministry, would be detrimental 

to public interest and state security.

Yet in the battle for the truth, it is hard not to 

sympathize with the sufferings of families of the missing militants or of victims 

of death squads. Viewed against the image of sindur-wearing wives of missing 

militants attending the high court hearings, the defence departments claim that 

crucial information that could throw light on the fate of their husbands is privileged 

seems unjust and inhuman. That even the court-appointed amicus curiae, P.K. Goswami, 

is unconvinced makes the argument seem hollow.

Srivastavas disdain for the Saikia commission is 

equally unhelpful in efforts to reassert the legitimacy of the states institutions. 

Secret killings are widely believed to have been a tool of counter-insurgency 

in Assam they took place with complicity between some police cells and members 

of the Surrendered United Liberation Front of Asom. Peoples abhorrence of the 

terrifying practice led to the defeat in 2001 of the weak and compromised Asom 

Gana Parishad government led by Prafulla Mahanta under which the killings had 

taken place. They contributed to AGPs defeat even in the elections of this year. 

Yet, despite the popular mandate to find the truth, the Congress government so 

far has not succeeded in shedding much light on the secret killings. The Saikia 

commission is the third body appointed by the state government to investigate 

them the earlier two commissions failed to unearth much.

But to the Assamese public it is hard to ignore the 

living reminders of the terror of secret killings. Consider Ananta Kalita, who, 

with two gunshot wounds on his face, bears testimony to a murder attempt by a 

death squad. He was a member the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad some 

of whose members were seen as Ulfa sympathizers. 

Kalita remembers vividly what followed the dreaded 

midnight knock on the door of his village home on a fateful night in September, 

1999. Ten armed men dragged him to a vehicle. Even though he was blindfolded, 

he could reconstruct the route that took him from his village to Jorabat on the 

Assam-Meghalaya border. He even remembers feeling the torchlight on his face at 

an army checkpost. To the laughter of his drunk kidnappers, a soldier had asked: 

Murga mil gaya? After a short uphill drive he was dragged out and one 

of his captors fired a single shot on his cheek. Kalita fell over the side of 

the hill, but survived. He climbed up to the Guwahati-Shillong road, stopped a 

vehicle and got to the hospital and lived to tell his story.

More than a hundred people were victims of death squads 

during 1998-2001 many of them close relatives of top Ulfa leaders. Evidently 

some killings were aimed at putting pressure on the top Ulfa leadership at a time 

that the counter-insurgency establishment was frustrated by the Ulfas resilience 

and the fact that its leadership was out of its reach in camps in Bhutan and Bangladesh. 

Among the prominent victims of death squads were the brother of the Ulfa chief, 

Arabinda Rajkhowa, and four relatives of the Ulfas then publicity secretary, 

Mithinga Daimary.

The Sulfa leader, Jugal Kishore Mahanta, has told 

the Saikia commission that he learnt about secret killings with which his name 

is associated only from newspaper reports. But he did shed light on the murky 

world in which security officials pressured surrendered militants to assist in 

counter-insurgency operations. 

Northeast Indias insurgencies thrive in the political 

space created by the legitimacy deficit of state institutions. All over the world, 

reasserting the publics faith in the rule of law is now seen as a precondition 

for building sustainable peace. Post-conflict justice mechanisms for making 

the perpetrators of atrocities and crimes accountable is the principle behind 

the international crimi- nal court and a number of war crime tribunals and truth 

and reconciliation commissions.

For the public to rally around the state and its institutions, 

decisions by legal authorities do not have to favour the insurgents version of 

the truth. But the procedures for enforcing the law must be seen as just and fair. 

It should not appear as if state institutions and top officials have something 

to hide about the terrible crimes that the public remembers. Without the publics 

faith in the rule of law, it is hard to begin the process of peace-building 

the end of violence, the beginning of reconciliation and of economic development. 

Assam cannot be an exception to these elementary lessons about peace-building 

in post-conflict societies learnt by the rest of the world.

The hurdles to discovering the truth about missing 

militants and the death squads put up by the ministry of defence and a senior 

Indian police official could become more formidable obstacles to peace in Assam 

than the dilly-dallying on the parts of the Ulfa and the government of India about 

negotiations.

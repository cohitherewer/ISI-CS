The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OF TIGERS AND TRIBALS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The prime minister?s task force that was established to find innovative ways to protect the Bengal tiger in its natural habitat has failed miserably. It is silent. Tribal people were going to conserve the species as part of the ?return-the-forests-to-the-tribals? deal. In a classic dilution of the issue of animal protection, the task force sought to link the then newly drafted tribal rights bill with tiger conservation. It was a wrong move. Many said so, but the government paid zero attention. This is typical of the arrogance of governments that tailor policies primarily to grab votes from specific sections of the social strata in an effort to remain in power. The CPI(M) has won out on usurping the tribal rights bill, thereby handing the forests of India over to a single community. Another victory for the left, which sits outside of the UPA and has always been anti-Congress.

 And, because the executive has failed to protect tigers and forests, it is talking about bringing in the army to rectify an international scandal. Bringing in the army is a scandal in itself. Soldiers are trained to kill, not to conserve animals. Soon the government will be calling in the army to run the corrupt administration, which, in international parlance, is called military rule, like governance in Pakistan. At one level, the situation appears absurd, but at another, it is frightening. This seeming inability to govern with commitment, the seeming fear of abiding by the policy changes that it believes in, that it could initiate but doesn?t because it may be pushed out of the treasury benches, make this government appear incompetent for the ruling of a complicated and diverse nation.

 For a new system

 Recently the prime minister has been ?reprimanding? chief ministers for allowing municipalities to run amuck, for compelling their cities and towns to be reduced to glorified slums. But why has his government not presented a restructuring plan for municipalities? Why does he not enforce the radical change in Congress-ruled states and set an example of how rapidly change can ensue if properly constructed and honestly implemented where the agencies concerned are made accountable in a timebound initiative? If the Delhi metro could be delivered with efficiency by the same ?Indian nationals? who man the municipalities, there is no reason why other arms of the service sector cannot function with the same commitment, appropriateness, competence and integrity.

 The problem is that no one in government is accountable. That is what has to change first, followed by the private sector ethic of hire and fire. To explain why would be a waste of time. It is evident for all to see. From the portals of the National Museum, the Taj Mahal, the corridors of the South and North Blocks, Shastri Bhavan and other edifices that house the government and its servants, to police stations, district headquarters, courts, and government-controlled hospitals, all one encounters are nose-picking men, lounging about doing nothing except creating problems for normal human beings who are trying to work and be productive.

 As a start, free national cultural institutions from the bondage of the uninitiated, intellectually inexperienced babu. Allow private players in. This alone will attract the best to come and take charge of the dying museums, academies and learning institutes. Let the people of India grow their culture and minds instead of handing our legacy and future to a small bunch of disinterested bureaucrats. Compel joint initiatives, private and public sector, with a statutory, timebound mandate, to reconfigure the municipal structures of urban and rural India and put the new system into action. Ensure the structure is simple and does not allow for endless interpretation and misinterpretation. Do something.

 NUMBER GAME

 STEPHEN HUGH-JONES

 Its vulgar, its extrovert, indeed its done mainly to show off; three qualities that we British claim to dislike. Yet ever more of us are taking to a word-game that typifies them. It is played with British car number plates. Their format has altered often. The year 1963 brought a semi-standardized one: three letters, then any number from 1 to 999, then a final letter to show the year of registration EFG1A or EFG123B, the A meaning 1963, B 1964 and so on. When the years (in fact, soon, a 12-month period straddling two calendar years) had gone through the alphabet, this was reversed: the year-letter came first, to give, say, A1EFG, with A now meaning 1982-83. In 2001, came a new format, strictly standardized: two letters, two figures for the date, then three more letters AB04CDE, or AB54CDE, the 04 indicating March-August of 2004, and 54 the six months thereafter. In all these formats, the three-letter group is usually parted from the rest by a small gap. Hence the first, and still commonest, form of the game: to acquire a car, or the right to a number-plate, whereon those three letters are ones own initials. Or maybe suggest ones business: I live near a heart specialist whose plate ends ECG. But already free spirits in America, where some states let you choose your own plate and use letters as you pleased, were going further, to form whole words. Some 35 years ago I saw there, among the Detroit juggernauts of the era, a tiny Honda numbered NOTOY.

 Britons have got round our stricter rules by enrolling the figures as honorary letters. In the standard black sans-serif typeface on white or yellow, its easy to read 1 as I, (or, generously, L), 5 as S, 8 as B; 2 does duty for Z; 3 is by courtesy a backward-facing E; 4 is A or H; 6 is G (or, rarely, a lower-case b); 7, with some strategic siting of a black-headed bolt holding the plate, can become a T. Only 9 is a real problem.

 Those bolt-heads are useful. A black one can make two closely spaced 1s into H or U; a white one turns 8 (or indeed B) into R. Likewise E can be made into F (or vice versa), C into G, VV into W. And more; within limits of course, but ingenuity can stretch these far. As the game has spread, a trade has sprung up selling old numbers that are no longer on the road. Indeed, even the official vehicle-licensing office sells new ones. Most cost hundreds of pounds; really striking (or antique) ones fetch several thousand or even tens of thousands. Many short names come easily. A neighbour of mine drives J4COB. A giant Bentley in my area, ROB11E, is said (albeit the chauffeur denies it) to belong to the pop singer, Robbie Williams; ROB81E must have eluded him. Words are more fun. Another neighbour reveals his favourite sport with AG01FER. My oyster-farming nephew drives a near-miss OY51TER, and a group of London plumbers has W4TER, DRA1N, A801LER and more. Ive spotted 5XY, whose intention is obvious, and no doubt some young Don Juan drives 5EXY to make it explicit. K15SES are clear enough; is K15TOE, which also Ive seen, a foot-fetishist?

 Artificial spacing, though illegal, can help: theres probably another would-be Lothario cruising in H1 8ABE. Text-message conventions have been imported: the bloke driving LE04SUE is no doubt called Leo and his girl-friend Sue; 2 is used as to or as in the souped-up Mini that used to infest Pall Mall labelled FU2 and driven accordingly. Ok, its childish, but its fun. And Britains Asians have taken to it with gusto. Ive seen RAV1, also YA51N YA and B1NA K, both so spaced. I look forward to a RAJ1V and (suitably doctored) A11MED. One neighbour drives A4UJA, another a doctored SHA81F. Ive seen MAL1K, 5HAH and 5YAL, and await A1YAR, 51NGH, PAT1L or PAT3L and more. Maybe some policeman will brandish his LAT41 at us, or some sitar-player outdo Master Williams with U5TAD.

 Ive seen S1 JAT and a near-miss S1HKH (yes, he was one). There must be a TAM1L. But Im less sure about 80NG.

 LIFTING THE FILM

 Symbolic connections are always thrilling, and they become more so when layers of symbolism are uncovered. Perhaps that is part of the satisfaction generated by the screening of Mughal-e-Azam in Pakistan, where Indian films have been banned for years. The coming out of the Indian film in Pakistan, that is, its coming out of the closet of pirated videotapes and discs, has been welcomed on both sides of the border as an important step in mutually enjoying a shared cultural heritage. This had been a conspicuous lack: it would seem that the shared love of cricket, which has contributed to the lowering of barriers between the countries, is less substantial or enduring than a shared culture in literature, art and music. And the popular Hindi film is loved in Pakistan as it is in many unexpected corners of the world. The first film to break the ice was made in Bombay but set in Lahore in the time of the Mughals. But the symbolism does not end here. It is perhaps almost poetic that the film depicts the tragic history of the doomed love between Prince Salim and the slave-girl, Anarkali, played, again with almost poetic irony, by Dilip Kumar and Madhubala. The pleasure of claiming part in a common culture, of retrieving a shared memory made vivid and beautiful by a popular art, adds to the pure enjoyment of the film a dimension that is both emotional and political. 

 This dimension is evident even in the way the film came to be shown ? through the request of the director?s son. And it is even more evident in the permission given to the showing of a more recent film, Taj Mahal, soon to be released in Pakistan. The film?s sponsors donated generously to the relief fund for the victims of the October earthquake in Pakistan. There is hope that this initial thawing will result in breaking the ice completely. At the same time, it is interesting to speculate on the reasons for the bar. Aspirations to nationhood and to homogeneity in faith lead to a closing of the mind, while culture is inextricably tied to both. Hence a shared culture becomes a highly sensitive and fragile region to tread upon, once patriotism and enmity have acquired new connotations through a divisive history. That is why it is particularly heartening to find that things are changing, however slowly and unobtrusively. Sharing fun can be as significant as hard-nosed politics.

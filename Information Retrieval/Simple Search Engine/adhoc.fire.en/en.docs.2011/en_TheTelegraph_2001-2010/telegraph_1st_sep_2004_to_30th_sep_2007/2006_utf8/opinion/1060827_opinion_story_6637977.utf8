 Food for thought

 Sir Calcuttas restaurants are famous for their sumptuous spread on various festive occasions. But the Parsee Navroze largely goes unnoticed. Parsees, dwindling in Calcutta, have some well-known and delicious dishes like Dhansak and Patrani Machhi the latter is the equivalent of the famous Bengali fish paturi. It may be a good idea to hold an annual Parsee food festival during Navroze where authentic Parsee dishes can be sampled. The dishes will certainly titillate the taste buds of the gastronomic Calcuttans.

 Yours faithfully,

 House warming

 Sir The steep hike in the salaries and allowances of members of parliament means a bigger hole in taxpayers pockets (MPs now have a worthy cause to attend House, Aug, 19). It is a practice of the Union government to review the salaries of its employees and act on recommendations every ten years. But for the representatives of the people we notice a sharp departure from routine. MPs had their pay revised as recently as 2001. Like the regular public servants, MPs are milking the government. Why is the cabinet not considering a retirement age for MPs when a Central government employee is to retire at sixty? The joint committee on salaries should have recommended the induction of fresh blood in parliament. The existing payscale will be attractive to many educated and intelligent youths as well as retired and working academics. Ironically, the new pay packet will make no difference to Indias corrupt political class, given their known and unknown sources of income.

 Sir MPs are never known to bicker over legislation that 

 makes them richer. The argument is that since public expectations 

 are increasing, pay and perquisites of public servants should 

 also rise. It is time MPs resolve to raise their level of 

 performance in the house instead of creating pandemonium 

 there and clamouring for more freebies. They should also 

 stop devouring local area development funds.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir In a country like ours where public service is equated with generosity, the hike in the salaries and other allowances of MPs will tarnish the spirit and willingness to serve. It makes a mockery of the selfless acts of Indian freedom fighters and redefines the concept of a public servant, who now appears to be a brutal money-monger. Is the government trying to equate the services of MPs to those of professionals? If it is so, then there must be regular appraisals and accountability associated with their job. There should also be a provision for suspension from parliament on grounds of non-performance. Since the daily allowance of MPs will be doubled, it should be ensured that they do not play truant or disrupt the proceedings of the house. Parliament should be a platform for debates on important issues. Therefore, the idea of deriving satisfaction from the pay packet is antithetical to what is expected from public servants. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Arnab Sarkar,

 Sir When it comes to self-interest, all politicians think alike. Yet MPs from different parties are engaged at present in misleading the government, and harming our national interests. Their non-performance costs the country crores of rupees every year, all from taxpayers money. In a country with a high percentage of its population unemployed, the MPs do not deserve the raise they have shamelessly given themselves. What is most disheartening is that no political voice has been raised in protest.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, 

 Faridabad

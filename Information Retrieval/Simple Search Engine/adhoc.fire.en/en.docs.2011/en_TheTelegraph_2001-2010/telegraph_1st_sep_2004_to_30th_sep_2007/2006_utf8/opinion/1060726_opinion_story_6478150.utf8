 FOR THE SAKE 

 OF LASTING PEACE 

 India needs to find a way out of its 

 many pressing problems, be it terrorism, poverty or floods,

 No mercy 

 On the evening of July 11, we 

 went through agony worrying about our daughter who could 

 have been travelling in one of the trains that were the 

 targets of bomb blasts in Mumbai. Late in the evening, she 

 called us up to tell us that she had reached home safely. 

 We were relieved. And then my 

 thoughts turned to others. What about those whose dear ones 

 had not reached home safely? What about those who were dead 

 or in pain due to injuries? What had innocent people done 

 to deserve this punishment at the end of a hard day?s work? 

 I knew that just a few days earlier, there had been heavy 

 rains which had disrupted normal life in Mumbai, bringing 

 the fear of the deluge that took place last year. Mumbai 

 is known for the tenacity of its people. ?Life must go on? 

 seems to be the philosophy there. I asked myself how much 

 even a city like Mumbai could take by way of natural and 

 man-made disasters. 

 My thoughts turned to the new 

 image of the country that is now being projected abroad. 

 India is no longer viewed as a country of snake charmers, 

 sadhus and beggars, but, on the contrary, as the 

 country of software specialists, scientists and a growing 

 economy that is going to be a major presence in the global 

 market in the new century. Is this country going to play 

 that role on the strength of flooded roads? Is there nothing 

 that can be done about the poor physical condition of our 

 cities? 

 I think much can be done to improve 

 the condition of Indian cities. Indeed, on the occasion 

 of the flooding of Bangalore and the controversy that was 

 generated between Deve Gowda and Narayana Murthy on the 

 poor infrastructure of Bangalore, I wrote an article in 

 this paper in which I argued that they represent two faces 

 of India. While Deve Gowda shows what is holding the country 

 back by way of petty politics, Narayana Murthy shows what 

 the country can achieve with vision and hard work. If terrorism 

 and poor infrastructure, along with poverty and persisting 

 inequalities, are holding the country back, there is an 

 urgent need to address these problems in a systematic manner. 

 They need to be solved within a broader perspective of what 

 the country can achieve if roadblocks are removed.

 I wish to address the problem 

 of terrorism here. Even in my anxious moments, when I was 

 desperately waiting for news of my daughter, I could not 

 help noticing that five blasts had taken place in Srinagar 

 on the same day. I felt the pain of the continuing turmoil 

 in that state. I thought of how a paradise on earth had 

 been turned into a veritable hell. 

 Over the years, terrorists have 

 attacked not only the personnel of the armed forces but 

 also civilians. Thousands have died in this war on the country. 

 My fear is that this is becoming a part of the routine in 

 India. The news of an attack is read with some excitement, 

 pious statements are made, and then it is back to normal 

 life. The point that I wish to make is that just as there 

 is a way out of the flooding of our cities and the poverty 

 of our people, there should be a way out of the problem 

 of terrorism. This country needs to put its resources together 

 to find ways out of the problems that are holding it back. 

 While it is good to go on with normal life, this does not 

 mean that one has to live with terrorism forever in passive 

 submission. 

 One of the major failures is with 

 respect to the government?s handling of Pakistan. A country 

 like ours, which boasts of politicians of all colours and 

 from every corner of the land has failed to handle the rulers 

 of Pakistan politically. The climax of this failure is represented 

 by the manner in which those who have usurped power in Pakistan 

 in the most blatant manner have been able to play games 

 with this country. The person behind Kargil talks of peace 

 while training terrorists on his territory and gets away 

 with it. The strategy of the top brass of Pakistan?s armed 

 forces is simple. It can be summed up in the three following 

 ideas. Keep the trouble boiling in Kashmir so that India 

 can be projected as a perpetual enemy which is needed to 

 justify the privileges that have been cornered by them at 

 the cost of their own countrymen. Keep alive the threat 

 of nuclear retaliation to put a limit on the reaction of 

 India?s armed forces against Pakistan. And then infiltrate 

 Kashmir and the rest of the country with terrorists trained 

 and supported by Pakistani armed forces. This is a formula 

 that has worked successfully so far. Add to it double speak 

 and the picture is complete. 

 Back to Kashmir where the problem 

 is located. It needs to be clearly understood that the present 

 trouble there does not have the support of the Dogras or 

 the Ladakhis. Nor do all Kashmiris support it. Kashmiri 

 Hindus are exiled in their own country. They are scattered 

 all over India, and many of them have been living in refugee 

 camps in Jammu for years now. Do Kashmiri Muslims support 

 secession? No single established political party there which 

 believes in the democratic process has made such a demand. 

 Who are then the people who want to hold the state back 

 and bring tabahi (disaster) in the name of azadi 

 (independence)? These are mainly opportunistic politicians 

 who have stood to gain by the turmoil there. And there are 

 terrorists trained in Pakistan who are controlled from outside. 

 Common Kashmiri Muslims have paid heavily for the trouble. 

 All attempts have been made to change their syncretic culture 

 by indoctrination at all levels. These attempts have been 

 made without any systematic measures to counter them. Politicians 

 ? Kashmiri and non-Kashmiri ? have played politics. Pakistan 

 and Kashmir show the political failure of this country which 

 is full of supposedly astute politicians. Clear policies 

 need to be formulated and carried out resolutely. There 

 cannot be any hope for improvement unless this is done. 

 The best thing, of course, will be if Pakistani society 

 finds its emancipation from within and the common people 

 are able to live in freedom. Let us hope, in the words of 

 Faiz, we shall see the day. 

 Where is the hope at the level 

 of the common people? My thoughts go to Ustad Bismillah 

 Khan. His shehnai is the source of my comfort at 

 this troubled moment. As I hear his todi played in 

 teen taal, I think of what he did when serial blasts 

 shook his city, Varanasi, early this year. He did the only 

 thing that a decent person born in the land of Gandhi could 

 do. He asked Muslims to donate blood for the benefit of 

 the injured. Kartikeya Singh of the Indian Medical Association 

 who was in charge of its blood bank announced: ?We are not 

 taking any more blood donations now. Our refrigerators are 

 full because people lined up in scores to donate blood after 

 the blasts. Muslims and women were the main donors.? 

 Let the spirit of Ustad Bismillah 

 Khan who has marched in the Shia alam ka juloos in 

 the memory of the slain grandson of Prophet Mohammad and 

 had also been blessed by the spirit of Balaji early in his 

 musical career show the way out of carnage in Srinagar, 

 Mumbai or in other parts of the country.

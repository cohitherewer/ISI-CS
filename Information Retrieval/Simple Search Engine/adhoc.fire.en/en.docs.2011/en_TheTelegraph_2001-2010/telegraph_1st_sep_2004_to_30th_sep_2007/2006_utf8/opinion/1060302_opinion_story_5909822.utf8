 Letters to Editor

 Travesty of justice

 Sir ? The acquittal of all the accused in the Jessica Lal murder case, which apparently had numerous eyewitnesses, underscores the wretched condition of our judicial system and law-enforcing agencies (?Big guns free in model killing?, Feb 22). The ?not guilty? verdict, in fact, does not come as a surprise to a people used to injustice and the rampant corruption at all levels of the administration. The only solace is the presumed impartiality and efficiency of the apex court, which is still revered as the citadel of the country?s judicial system. One hopes Jessica gets justice there if the case is routed to it. But it needs to be said that conniving members of the judiciary are even worse than the culprits. For it is their blindness that fosters crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The current court verdict on the Jessica Lal murder case had been anticipated since the time the main culprit, Manu Sharma, was released on bail. It seems that our country has two sets of laws for its citizens ? one for the rich and influential and the other for commoners. Similar verdicts can be expected in the future since money and terror will prove to be more powerful than the arms of the law. The Jessica Lal case should be reassessed so that it becomes a lesson for high-and-mighty criminals like Sharma. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The shoddy work done by the investigating authorities in pinning down the culprits in the Jessica Lal murder case needs to be condemned. It is also shameful to find the key witness suddenly turning hostile, possibly in return for substantial benefits. The police should have had the confessions recorded and sealed at the earliest. Also, police protection would have discouraged them from flipping and encouraged others to come forward. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Jessica Lal murder verdict proves for the umpteenth time that in this country, anyone can commit crimes like rape and murder without fear of the law, provided, of course, the criminal is rich and politically powerful. While the police and politicians in all third world countries are notoriously corrupt, the judiciary?s attempts at dispensing justice in this country has been impaired by the lackadaisical attitude of the prosecution in collecting and preserving evidence, and preventing the witnesses from being threatened or bribed into silence. Given the proximity of the prime accused to the government, it is now imperative that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance prove that it does not shelter those who break the law. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir ? It has taken seven long years for the judiciary to pass a verdict on the Jessica Lal case, and that too a negative one. India?s criminal justice system is mired in corruption. We are expected to remain content with the knowledge that the government has been ?trying? to reform the system. Unless much stronger steps are taken to combat political interference at every step in a criminal investigation, Manu Sharmas will continue to walk freely in society.

 Yours faithfully,

Radhika Mitra, Texas, US

 Sir ? Top officials in the Delhi police now claim to have suspected that some officers had rigged the Jessica Lal murder investigation (?Jessica bullet cover-up?, Feb 27). They even carried out inquiries, and yet, nothing came of it. The delay in India?s judicial system is one of the main reasons for the subversion of justice. As recently pointed out by the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, judges should extend the hearings for an extra couple of hours to be able to deal with the backlog.

 Yours faithfully,

Faruque Md. Chowdhury, Burdwan

 Sir ? While the front page of The Telegraph listed Sayan Munshi as one of the witnesses in the Jessica Lal case who turned hostile, the next day a supplement of the newspaper carried a picture of Munshi as a celebrity visiting Calcutta. It is amusing to note the media?s double standards. Also look at our film directors. They strum their guitars to protest the mass killings in Gujarat or Iraq (for there is a safety in numbers), but choose to ignore the murder of an innocent girl. The rich and the powerful will get away when they have friends like these.

 Yours faithfully,

Manjira Majumdar, Calcutta

 The dark side

 Sir ? The report, ?Catch Howrah Bridge all aglow? (Feb 26), promises Calcutta the reflected glory of the soon-to-be-lit-up bridge. The Calcutta Port Trust deserves accolades for this. But it should also work on beautifying the riverbank across the Howrah station. It can be turned into a park after relocating the eateries that have blocked the view of the river. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Illuminating the Howrah bridge is all very well, but the city fathers must also care for the rest of Calcutta. I am a regular commuter between Nonapukur and St James Church on A.J.C. Bose Road. The street lights on both sides of this stretch have gone out of order for months and the entire area has been dug for restoration of the tram tracks. Pedestrians and motorists are at a high risk. Criminals take advantage of the darkness, snatching valuables and molesting girls. Incidentally, tourists regularly pass through this area to and from Mother Teresa?s house. Are the authorities waiting for an accident to take place? 

 Yours faithfully,

Sohail Anwar, Calcutta

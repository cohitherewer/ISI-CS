 DEFYING RULES

 This Above All 

/ Khushwant Singh

 In defence of artistic freedom

 An interesting contrast between Indians and their rulers and Pakistanis and their dictators is the way they treat their creative artists ? painters, poets, novelists and thinkers. In India, successive governments have been liberal in their attitude towards men and women of letters, the public in general has not. It is the other way round in Pakistan; successive rulers have been harsh towards their literary men while the common people have supported them. 

 In India, a few books have been banned because government minions felt they would offend people?s religious sensibilities: they include Agehanand Bharati?s The Ochre Robe, Aubrey Menon?s Rama Retold and Salman Rushdie?s The Satanic Verses. The government has left painters like M.F. Husain untouched and cleared film-scripts which were not allowed to be shot. The rabble led by the goons of the Shiv Sena and Bajrang Dal not only ransacked and burnt a sections of the Bhandarkar Institute archives but also vandalized Husain?s paintings and frustrated Mira Nair?s attempts to shoot films cleared by the film board. 

 In Pakistan, there have been no cases of destroying archival material or paintings. But the government has a black record of persecuting poets who raised their voices against dictatorial regimes. Faiz Ahmed Faiz was imprisoned a few times, as was the Punjabi poet Ustad Daman. Ahmed Faraz left the country a few times to avoid arrest and prosecution. So did Fahmida Riyaz. 

 The worst case was that of Habib Jalib who was jailed many times. He once said, ?Don?t ask me which government did not put me in jail! The only one which did not was Benazir Bhutto?s and that was only because she was too busy fighting for her survival as a leader.? Nevertheless, it has to be conceded that in every case the people of Pakistan stood behind their poets.

 Of the most persecuted of Pakistani poets, the least known in India, is Habib Jalib. He was born in Hoshiarpur, educated in the Anglo-Arabi school in Delhi and migrated to Pakistan in 1947. He got a poorly paid job as proof-reader of Imroze, published from Karachi. He shifted to Lahore and stayed there till his death except for the time he spent in different jails. Despite living in abject poverty, his spirit remained defiant till the very end. I quote the first two verses from his best known poem, ?Dastoor?:

 Deep jis ka mehlaat hee mein jaley

 Chand logon kee khushion ko lay kar chaley

 Voh jo saya mein har muslihat kay chaley

 Aisey dastoor ko subha-e-beynoor ko

 Main nahin manta, main nahin jaanta

 (A lamp only in palaces lit 

 Shed light for a chosen few

 Shade in which one has to fit

 Such rites and lightless dawns

 I will not accept; I refuse to know.)

 Main bhee khauf naheen takhtaa-e-dar say

 Main bhee Mansoor hoon keh do Aghyaar say

 Zulum kee baat ko, jail kee raat ko 

 Main nahin manta, main nahin jaanta

 (Of the scaffold I have no fear,

 I am like Mansoor, let everyone know

 Why do prison walls make you quail?

 Why cringe before cruelty 

 and lonely nights in jail?

 I will not accept, I refuse to know.)

 Secret lives

 Different people came into my life at different times and in different ways. The strangest was the way in which I got to know sociologist Kamla Chaudhury, who died on January 4. I had appeared as defence counsel for the man who had murdered her husband.

 It goes back to the early Forties. I was a briefless lawyer practising in the Lahore high court. I got my name put on a panel of lawyers who had to appear as defence counsels in appeals against death sentences passed by sessions courts when the appellant could not afford to pay fee. Among the earliest of such cases that came my way was one of a fanatical tribesman from the NWFP who, on a Diwali night, shot dead a young Hindu ICS officer sleeping in the dak bungalow alongside his newly-married wife. The fellow had no motive to commit the crime besides taking the life of a kafir who had done him no harm. Since it was Diwali and crackers were bursting in Hindu mohallas in the town, the wife did not wake up with the shot fired by her husband?s killer. It was much later, when the night became chilly and she decided to cover herself and her husband with a blanket, that she realized he was dead. For many months the police did not have a clue about the killer or the motive. Then by chance the man was captured with a gang of tribesmen. When interrogated, the fellow thought he was being questioned about his role in the murder of the young Hindu officer. He confessed to the crime and was sentenced to death. There was nothing I could say in his defence. The sentence of death was confirmed and he was hanged in Lahore Central Jail. I got a fee of Rs 16.

 Later in Lahore I got to know her sister who married Arjan Singh, my classmate in college. Kamla was living in Ahmedabad and had a teaching job with the Sarabhais. She was said to be very close to Vikram Sarabhai, who had made his name as a scientist. She had become a close companion and replaced his wife Mrinal, who was busy dancing round the world. After Vikram died, Kamla moved to Delhi. She was an attractive woman with a sad, winsome smile, which won many men?s hearts, including that of P.L. Tandon (author of Punjabi Century) and my close friend Prem Kirpal. She was often abroad on teaching assignments and was for some years with the Ford Foundation. I saw quite a bit of her in Kirpal?s house. He had her and me elected to the governing body of the Delhi Public Schools. She picked me from my home to take me to DPS meetings. My wife and I were often invited to dinner as she was to mine. Another link between us was her nephew, eminent psychiatrist Sudhir Kakar who I vastly admired. Throughout these years of friendship I could not bring myself to tell her that I had once defended her husband?s murderer.

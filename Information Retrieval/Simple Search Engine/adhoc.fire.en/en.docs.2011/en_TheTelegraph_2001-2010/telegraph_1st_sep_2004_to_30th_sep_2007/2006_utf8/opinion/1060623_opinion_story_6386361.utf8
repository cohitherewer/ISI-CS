 CATCH THE REAL THIEVES

Malvika Singh

 While this government, despite having the great reformer of the Indian economy at its helm, continues to make life more difficult by making saral income tax forms kathin, and discouraging people from using their credit cards for legitimate purchases by the constant questioning of the income tax department (queries that belong to dictatorial command economies), the people are being pushed into being corrupt once again. No one wants to have a constant barrage of ugly cyclostyled government forms invading one?s privacy every time one buys goods with a credit card. Should people start keeping money aside, undeclared, as was the habit before, so that they can avoid the questions? Is the tax department under-worked and needs to prick the citizen a bit more for some extra pocket money? 

 If shopkeepers are errant, find other solutions to catch them. Do not harass honest citizens by asking them to answer inane questions about what they have bought with their white money. Those with black money get away anyway because they use a percentage of that money to bribe the law- keeper! Why is the United Progressive Alliance trying to create more pools for corrupt practices, more avenues for the already corrupt officials to make more illegitimate money? Why are we moving back into feudal exploitation? Have those in financial policy run out of ideas to punish the wrongdoers? Why are we being compelled to regress as a nation? 

 The prime minister and the finance ministry should first ban all subsidies given to politicians and bureaucrats and set an example. Kill all subsidized housing except for fourth class employees. Kill all subsidies for electricity consumption, telephone calls, train tickets, airline tickets, staff help, free maintenance of homes et al, in one fell sweep. 

 The freebies

 Put these men and women, who have been responsible for the degradation of Indian society, out to pasture and let them fend for themselves. If they are so desperate for subsidized life support, let their constituents, who vote them to power, handle their expenses. The time has come to file a PIL against this kind of arbitrary use of government funds. Better to subsidize lentils and onions than politicians and bureaucrats. 

 It is scandalous that members of parliament who have more money than most of us, get a subsidized lunch in parliament. P.C. Chidambaran should question and kill this absurdity. Let us start there instead of asking ordinary, helpless citizens to furnish all information about what groceries they buy with their money, which they earn through hard work or which they inherit from their ancestors. That money is far more legit than the subsidies politicians and their babus live off. Those who want to live in Lutyens? Delhi must pay market rent, must refurbish their ?homes? with their own money and not use public money to ?decorate? their living space. Politicians come and go. Therefore, money spent on them is a complete waste. 

 If there have to be official residences, they should be official and only for cabinet ministers. Government houses, government furniture, government fittings... And the occupant has to move out within 24 hours of being dismissed from the ministry! Treat these residences like hotel accommodation and then watch the fun. Today, many who leave such residences shamelessly carry the government furniture with them, buying the pieces at ?book value?. It is a rip-off. 

 And Lalu Prasad can add more to his profits by discontinuing the most untenable rule ? that any and every elected member of parliament, since the initiation of parliament, is entitled to free train travel! If this is true, it is a complete and utter scandal. Yes, you can indulge in a different form of ticketless travel if you have won an election at some point in your life.

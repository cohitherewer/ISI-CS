 NEW FIGURES

 Exactly how grim is the HIV/AIDS scenario in India? Would the measure of this grimness be statistical and quantitative or more qualitative? Is the fact that India is next only to Africa in the gravity of the situation only a ?foreign? perception? And how would changes in the situation show? All these questions are touched upon by the latest findings of an Indo-Canadian study of HIV infection rates in India. It has shown that infection rates among women between 15 and 24 years of age in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have fallen by a third, while it has remained unchanged in the north. This certainly provides grounds for hope, especially in the efficacy of awareness-raising with regard to condom-use in these states. Ultimately, prevention by promoting safer sex remains perhaps the single most effective form of control.

 But interpretations of such findings have to be made with caution. First, statistics are not beyond the realm of global politics. The conflicts between HIV/AIDS figures declared by the Indian state and those by ?international? public health organizations remain alive as a clash of perceptions with its own story of vested interests. Second, findings within a specific group in just four states cannot be extrapolated to form a perception of what is happening in the whole of India. Just looking at Bengal and the North-East may result in a very different set of findings. All this ought to be grounds for not allowing complacence of any kind based on such upbeat findings. Radical and wide-ranging social and attitudinal changes need to be sustained in the spheres of sex, sexuality, public health, healthcare training and management. Human brutality, prejudice, ignorance and mismanagement at every level of society and in the health sector will have to be fought concertedly, and that battle is far from being won yet. An obsession with figures may be dangerous here, fostering the common tendency to find what one is looking for. The infernal state of the rural and suburban healthcare infrastructure could hardly inspire confidence in the government?s ability to handle not only HIV/AIDS, but also less catastrophic diseases like polio and tuberculosis. Besides, there is no reason to conclude that condom-use has become an established practice in, say, rural India, and among all socio-economic classes and other high-risk groups like men who have sex with men.

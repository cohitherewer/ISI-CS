 DEVELOPMENT 

 VERSUS DISPLACEMENT 

 To clear the air on Singur, the government 

 should let the people have their rightful share of all information 

 regarding the transaction, writes Abhirup Sarkar

 The unprecedented vandalism by 

 the Trinamool Congress in the assembly, atrocities by Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjees police in Singur and the consequent agitation 

 are gradually making investment in the proposed automobile 

 factory by the Tatas a convoluted and ruffled affair. The 

 Trinamool chief had never had a reputation for being levelheaded. 

 But the Communist Party of India (Marxist), always known 

 for its ruthlessly calculating moves, is posing the obvious 

 puzzle: why is the party and its government dealing with 

 the land acquisition question so high-handedly? 

 The administration is claiming 

 that the large concourse in Singur, to protest and prevent 

 the fencing of the agricultural land earmarked for the small 

 car factory, comprised mainly of outsiders. The protesters, 

 the claim goes, were an assorted lot, consisting of activists 

 of the Socialist Unity Centre of India, Naxalites and others, 

 who had assembled in Singur to enhance their own political 

 visibility. Very few actual farmers were present among the 

 demonstrators for the simple reason that most farmers had 

 voluntarily sold off their land to the government for an 

 adequate compensation. The opposite claim, of course, is 

 that the congregation consisted mostly of actual tillers 

 of the soil who were desperately trying to prevent the loss 

 of their livelihood, the forceful appropriation of their 

 only means of survival.

 We are confused. We, the citizens 

 of the country and residents of the state, have a right 

 to know what is actually going on, especially because the 

 land transactions in question are not private business dealings. 

 Here, land is being taken away from the farmers by the state 

 in public interest. So the public is perfectly entitled 

 to have full information of the happenings. But even if 

 the government had the good intention of providing information, 

 it is not easy to do so. Among counter-claims by the opposition, 

 how do we know if the government is telling the truth? How 

 do we know if the demonstrators in Singur are mostly sons 

 of the soil or politically ambitious outsiders? There are, 

 indeed, ways of knowing. If direct methods fail, there are 

 certain indirect methods of ascertaining whether the government 

 is fooling the people. But before we go into them, we have 

 to identify the issues, separate out facts from emotions, 

 and isolate long-term economic questions from short-term 

 political interests. 

 The basic issue is one of development 

 leading to displacement. No sensible person will deny that 

 agriculture in West Bengal has reached its frontier and 

 to provide a decent livelihood to the wretched lot, who 

 are still dependent on an overcrowded agriculture, it is 

 now imperative to develop the long- neglected industrial 

 sector. But industries cannot be built in thin air. Among 

 other things, one needs land to build factories, roads, 

 bridges, airports and other infrastructural necessities 

 that are essential to put together an industrial network 

 in the state. Where will the land come from?

 In a state like West Bengal, where 

 the man-land ratio is three times as high as that in the 

 rest of the country, almost every bit of land is already 

 in use in some form or the other. Out of this, a large chunk 

 63 per cent of the total available land to be exact 

 is put under cultivation. So, if an investor comes to the 

 state and picks up a piece of land at random for his factory, 

 the probability that the chosen piece is agricultural, is 

 indeed quite high.

 Investors are unlikely to choose 

 sites at random though. They usually have good reasons to 

 supplement their choice. The Tatas, for example, have chosen 

 Singur because of its proximity to Calcutta and its nearness 

 to the Durgapur Expressway, the only modern highway in the 

 state, and because plenty of water is available in the neighbourhood. 

 And it happens that the land they have chosen is fertile 

 agricultural land. If they are denied this land and asked 

 to build their factory in some other place which lacks the 

 essential facilities, they will probably pack up and invest 

 elsewhere in the country. 

 Indeed, quite a few competing 

 states would be much too eager to have their investment. 

 Industrialization, it seems, is a competitive business. 

 So it would be a disaster to deny the Tatas their chosen 

 land. The fact that the land is fertile or that it produces 

 two or three crops a year is of little macroeconomic consequence 

 because the land in question is minuscule compared to the 

 total cultivated land in the state. Its appropriation by 

 the Tatas cannot possibly affect aggregate food production 

 in West Bengal in any conceivable way. 

 The real problem is microeconomic; 

 it pertains to those who are losing their land and their 

 livelihood. It pertains to the tillers of the soil and to 

 others who depend on the appropriated land for their daily 

 bread, to owner-cultivators, sharecroppers, landless agricultural 

 labourers and even small local traders, whose economic existence 

 had so far been rooted in those tiny plots of land in Singur 

 that are proposed to be handed over to the Tatas. How are 

 these displaced people compensated?

 Indeed, the question of compensation 

 is of paramount importance. It is important not only because 

 the government, which is grabbing land in the name of public 

 interest, has a moral responsibility to compensate the loser, 

 but also because the loser is the least likely candidate 

 to get any employment in the factory to be set up by the 

 Tatas. Most important, the entire compensation package has 

 to be made public. 

 We have a right to know how land 

 is being evaluated, on what basis compensations are arrived 

 at and how they are distributed between owners and sharecroppers. 

 We have a right to know whether landless labourers and others, 

 whose livelihood depended on the soil but who did not have 

 any legal right over land, are being compensated at all. 

 If the whole package is made public and if by looking at 

 it we can convince ourselves that compensations are fair, 

 we can accept the governments claim that most people have 

 voluntarily handed over their plots of land to the authorities 

 and we can believe the official story that most agitators 

 in Singur are outsiders with political ambitions and axes 

 of their own to grind. We know how much income a plot of 

 land might fetch in Singur, we know the rates of interest 

 and can predict the rate of inflation. So, we can roughly 

 tell, if given full information about the compensation package, 

 whether the offered settlement money is enough to maintain 

 the living standard of the loser for a reasonable number 

 of years.

 The trouble is that the government 

 has been frightfully non-transparent as far as the compensation 

 package and other financial matters are concerned. What 

 we need instead is a white paper from the government documenting 

 the detailed calculations of the compensations. We also 

 need to know how much money is expected to come from the 

 Tatas as the price of the acquired land and how is the difference, 

 if any, between the payment made by the Tatas and the money 

 given out as compensation, proposed to be financed. We come 

 across all sorts of unofficial figures in the media, which 

 are often contradictory. We need to know the truth. Indeed, 

 the whole affair cannot be a trade secret of the government. 

 We believe that if the government were able to come up with 

 a healthy dose of transparency, most of its critiques would 

 be silenced. If, on the other hand, it continues to maintain 

 its current stance of furtiveness, there would be good reasons 

 to believe that it has indeed something vital to hide. The 

 leftists of West Bengal must realize that the authoritarian 

 Chinese model of development cannot be applied here. They 

 should understand that a minimum consensus among the citizens 

 is needed before any particular path of industrialization 

 can be embarked upon, because, however faulty, we do have 

 a democracy in our country which we all cherish.

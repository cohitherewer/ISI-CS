 TRUST THE LIES

 Is Hungary moving up or down the spiral of history? Its socialist prime minister, Mr Ferenc Gyurcsany, has outraged the people of his country into violent riots by acknowledging on a leaked recording of a party meeting that the government had lied day and night about the perilous state of the Hungarian economy in order to win a second term in office. Widespread anger had already been brewing in the country over a sharp rise in taxation and university fees and cuts in health benefits. The leaked tape was the last straw, plunging the country into what Mr Gyurcsany called its longest, darkest night. Yet, there has been a hard, upbeat edge to the prime ministers statements since the crisis. He has refused to step down, and it has even been alleged that he was not unaware of the possibility of a leak. Mr Gyurcsany has even provided a full transcript of the recording on his own blog. To some, it is as if the prime minister is saying to the people, Trust me. Im a liar.

 Since 1989, with the collapse of the Iron Curtain and the opening of Hungarys border with Austria, the countrys transition from communism to capitalism has meant that the electorate has been continually lied to. Promised west European standards of welfare and affluence if only they stand by the reformers, the ordinary people of the east have woken up the day after elections to the inevitability of austerity measures. Overseen by Washington and Brussels, these governments, anxious to meet the requirements of the International Monetary Fund and convergence criteria for the euro, have actually offered their electorate no choices. Through all this, Mr Gyurcsanys has been the classic post-communist success story a communist leader turning into a socialist millionaire by cannily exploiting the privatization of the state socialist economy in the Nineties. Yet, all the while, he had kept Hungarians in an economic fools paradise. His austerity package from September 1 was designed to bring the huge twin deficits in the current account and budget under control and put his plans for joining the euro in 2011 back on track. But history has its spiralling ironies. In 1956, fifty years ago, when Krushchevs secret speech revealing the truth about Stalins rule was leaked, the crisis that erupted across the communist bloc had culminated in the Hungarian national uprising, to be brutally crushed by Soviet forces.

 NEWER LOOK

 Celebrating his party?s victory in the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham last Friday morning, the Conservative Party leader, Mr David Cameron, noted that the last time the Tories had won here, he was just a one-year-old infant. While this confession is a pointer to his lack of vintage, it also indicates that the party which dominated British politics for 17 years has finally found an occasion to celebrate. The results of the May 4 election in England (there was no election in Scotland and Wales) suggest that Mr Cameron?s New Conservatism ? a curious mixture of Blue and Green ? is finding favour with an electorate that perceives New Labour to be jaded, incompetent and, increasingly, disreputable. The Conservatives did well in London in last year?s general election. A year later, it has consolidated its hold and also emerged as the number one party in England, with a 40 per cent popular vote share. Unfortunately, these gains remain largely confined to Greater London and the Home Counties. In Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle ? cities that bred Victorian Tory stalwarts like Joseph Chamberlain ? the Conservatives have not recovered from their post-Margaret Thatcher eclipse. Unless Mr Cameron makes inroads into the erstwhile rust belt, Britain could be heading for its first post-War coalition government in 2010.

 The possibility of a hung parliament the next time may have the Liberal Democrats ? the number three party whose performance remained static ? drooling, but it would be a cruel epitaph for Mr Tony Blair. As things stand, Mr Blair gives the growing impression of being a lame-duck prime minister. He has promised to relinquish office before the next election but has set no date for Mr Gordon Brown to move into Downing Street. This is understandable. With his government in tatters and stalwarts like the deputy prime minister, Mr John Prescott, an object of tabloid ridicule, Mr Blair is loath to abandon ship and bow out in disgrace. Yet, there is absolutely nothing in his cabinet reshuffle to suggest that New Labour is about to turn over a new leaf. On the contrary, the appointment of Ms Margaret Beckett as foreign secretary has been greeted with disbelief. Foreign policy was one area where Britain conducted itself with verve and dignity. By dispensing with the tried and tested Mr Jack Straw ? also a good friend of India ? in favour of an earnest and sanctimonious plodder, Mr Blair, in the words of a critic, has done the equivalent of Caligula appointing his horse as consul. What looks increasingly like Mr Blair?s last bow may yet turn out to be a grim farce.

 ALL PLAY AND NO WORK

 Neha Sahay

 The new academic year has barely started when it is holiday time again. Schooling for foreigners in China is fun in more ways than one, specially for Indian kids. Not only is the academic pressure non-existent, and the load far less, it also means having small stretches of studies between long stretches of holidays. 

 The new term begins in September, and then, on October 1 starts the week-long National Day holiday, which is on now. Back to school for about two months, then the three week-long Christmas break begins. Christmas holiday stories have not been fully exchanged, when school breaks again for 10 days for the Chinese New Year-Spring Festival holiday that falls between January-end and February-end. Classes last all of March and then in April, it is time for a short Easter break. May 1 sees the start of the Labour Day holiday week. Finally, the last stretch of school starts: from mid-May to end June. Then terms over. 

 Adding to this enjoyable school calendar, is the relatively easy curriculum in the so-called International schools that dot the smaller cities. Levels of Maths and Science are far lower than in Indian schools, specially in institutions run by Americans. 

 However, there is no doubt that the teaching methods in all these schools force students to think on their own. Older children are expected to read the chapters at home first. History texts are not only full of colour pictures, but they also discuss sources of history of the period being studied, include a literary excerpt about the period, and ask students to compare ways of life in different countries of the same period. In Science, though few schools have labs, hands-on experiments from making air balloons to monitoring air pollution levels in different areas of the city are the norm. 

 Wonder years

 Chinese students, too, have wonderfully long holidays: their new term also begins in September, ending in the first week of July. The only difference in their schedule and that of international schools is that they do not close for Christmas. But they make up for that with a months break for the Spring festival in January- February.

 However, studies for them arent half as much fun as they are for foreign students. When Indian kids meet Chinese students, it takes little time for them to become friends once the language barrier is crossed. Indian students can identify with the Chinese kids grouses: excessive homework and pressure to excel in all fields, not just in academics. It is not long before they sit down in front of the computer to play a football game; Indian and Chinese students prefer watching sports than playing them. 

 Rigid enforcement of rules for students is another common factor between Indian and Chinese school authorities. Sometimes, this leads to tragedies which Indians are quite familiar with. This year, a 16-year-old committed suicide in Shanghai because she was not allowed to give her school-leaving national exam. First she was turned away because she had left her hair open, when she was supposed to come with it tied up. When she came back with it tied up, they told her it was too late; the exam had started. She called up her mother and disappeared; they found her body in a lake. 

 More than 60 per cent of senior middle school and almost 50 per cent of middle school suffer from high blood pressure. A survey conducted by the China Youth and Children Research Centre showed that 83.6 per cent of parents expect their school leaving children to rank among the top 15 in the final examinations, so that they can choose the best universities. Fortunately, there is little chance of such traumas being faced by expat kids, busy enjoying their holidays, exploring China, and occasionally sitting down to two hours of homework.

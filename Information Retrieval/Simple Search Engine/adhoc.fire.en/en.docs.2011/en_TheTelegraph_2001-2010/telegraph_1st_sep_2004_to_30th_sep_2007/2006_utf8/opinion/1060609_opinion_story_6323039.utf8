 ISLANDS WITHIN THE ISLAND

 - Colourful vignettes of Indians in Britain

 Still from Bend it like Beckham

BRIDELESS IN WEMBLEY

By Sanjay Suri, 

Viking, Rs 495

His Indian-accented English was apparently a turn-off 

for pukka British-born Indian girls in the United Kingdom who would have 

discovered, had they taken the trouble, that Sanjay Suri was more English than 

he sounded. Consider, for instance, his explanation of how Brideless in Wembley 

came to be written: ?The way Indians were being Indian, someone had to take 

notes.? It is just as well that this London-based journalist undertook to do so, 

bringing more than a flair for British understatement to his ?book of stories? 

about Indians living in the UK today.

 Brideless in Wembley is primarily Suri?s account of his interactions with individuals, families and communities from England?s ethnic Indian pockets. The diehard reporter tails his subjects to Navratri programmes at various Gujarati community halls, observing parent-chaperoned meeting-and-mating rituals, to a Sikh gurdwara where the audience is subjected to a relentlessly argued lecture ? provoked by the perceived unfairness of British law ? on the advantages of the turban over the helmet even when intercepting bullets, to extra-curricular Islamic schools that teach British Muslim children to mechanically memorize verses from the Quran, and to a Hindu mela where a child innocently mentions David Beckham when asked to name a Hindu deity. Moving easily between Indian ?ghettos? like Belgrave Road, Leicester and Henley, ?the most England-like? part of England, the author even signs up for professional dating services to understand the difficulties of finding a mate in a foreign land and ends up discovering a few sobering facts about himself.

 The spectrum of humanity he comes across during his peregrinations is so colourful that Suri confesses he could not have ?thought up? the people he encountered. A few, however, like the ?holy celebrity?, who claims to have conducted a katha aboard a Jumbo jet in mid-air, are so outr? as to make you wonder, fleetingly, whether the writer isn?t having you on. Lending colour to his collection of cameos are men like Dhanjibhai Atwal who set out for Britain without bona fide travel papers soon after Independence and endured much hardship and humiliation in their efforts to make a life there. There is Kailash Puri, the no-holds-barred agony aunt to an entire population of Punjabis, with her ?snapshots from an unhappy album?, and a pot-pourri of Khalistanis, Krishna devotees, Bollywood hopefuls and male illegal immigrants like Shakti, whose desire to marry British citizens solely for the purpose of legalizing their status is, apparently, as ardently reciprocated by their prey who would rather be exploited in this manner than left on the shelf.

 Emerging from Suri?s survey is an intriguing portrait of a ?variously monocultural? community, as insular and segregated from the ?mainstream? as it is divided within itself. Going by the evidence he presents, there is something to be said for the siege mentality that spawns Indian ghettos. Consider the case of the elderly Barots, regular targets of racial violence and abuse in their white, working-class neighbourhood not far from the ?Indian heart of Leicester?. Before we turn indignant and judgmental, the author throws up another perspective on the situation. Referring to their hostile neighbours, the beleaguered couple says, ?They say we have a house, a car? Sometimes, they don?t have money in their pocket for a meal.?

 Racial discrimination is not, however, the sole reason for members of Indian communities in Britain to seek out their own kind. Tina, for instance, prefers the company of fellow Gujaratis because with them ?I don?t feel like I have to explain myself?. Perhaps, suggests Suri, it is partly the reason why Indian children in England, overwhelmed by the ?proximity of a wide species of alien cultures and colours?, are far more tradition-bound and closer to their parents than their counterparts back in India.

 The author demonstrates to what extremes the urge to enhance ?comfort? levels in this manner can take the Patels, for instance. Descended from tailors and barbers, leather workers and washermen, each group within the larger Gujarati Patel community practises its own form of apartheid. Its members have their designated community halls where they mingle and match-make, fiercely resisting intrusion by ?outsiders?? members of other Patel sects and sub-sects. The situation is no different for the other UK-based Indian communities which the writer explores. Caste distinctions are sacrosanct and homogeneity de rigueur for a people besieged by so grave an identity crisis that gathering together with their own flock ?brings familiarity...that becomes a reason to gather more, and then to marry within the gathering. In England, you need your own islands to live on? when an alien sea of hostility is perceived to lie beyond, ready to swallow up your sense of self.

 Suri?s natural curiosity, observant eye and talent for the absurd enliven his account of Indian life in not-so-good-ole Blighty. Lending it depth are his passion for investigation, his ability to balance involvement and objectivity, and his unerring instinct for getting to the heart of the matter. A minor irritant that cuts the pace of the narrative is the author?s tendency to get bogged down in details. Disconcerting too is the apparent lack of connection between his rather arbitrarily chosen areas of interest. Such shortcomings are easily forgiven, however, and not because of Suri?s careful disclaimer that Brideless is not ?a history book?. What disarms us is an irresistible package: a fascinating subject, an engaging prose style enlivened by wry humour and a candour that lends the narrative its endearing, part-confessional flavour.

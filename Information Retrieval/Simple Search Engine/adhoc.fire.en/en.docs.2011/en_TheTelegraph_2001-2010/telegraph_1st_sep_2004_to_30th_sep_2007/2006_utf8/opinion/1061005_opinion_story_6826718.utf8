 THREAT CALLS

 India is no longer selling itself cheap. The fledgling business process outsourcing sector of the country also seems to be extracting its pound of flesh now. And lobbyists abroad, trying hard to warn against the hidden costs of subcontracting work to low-cost countries like India, could not have been happier. A sting operation like last years, conducted by the Western media electronic this time has revealed how overseas customers could end up compromising their financial security through their interactions with call centre executives in India. The yet-to-be-beamed Channel 4 expos apparently nails middlemen who buy confidential personal information from BPO employees and pass it on to other players in the ring for a price. The investigation, apart from re-establishing a point already made, draws attention to the rapid consolidation of the network of nefarious dealers who are cashing in on the loopholes in the system. This is not unique to any business anywhere in the world. The reason the exploits of swashbuckling youngsters, in gangs with experienced swindlers, need more than a passing interest is because of the ways they can affect the future of an entire industry.

 It is undoubtedly injudicious to tar and feather the BPO sector in India for the indiscretions of a few. But the repeated exposures do send out a negative message. This, coupled with the knowledge that there is still no legislation in place in India to combat the menace, cannot be comforting to clients. The recently launched national skills registry, a voluntary database to keep a tab on employees in the sector, has had a poor record of entries so far. Even if made compulsory, personal details of employees can hardly be used to restrain their proclivities. The Information Technology Act needs an overhaul and soon. But it has been a while since the urgency was acknowledged. Perhaps the Channel 4 programme will send the government another reminder.

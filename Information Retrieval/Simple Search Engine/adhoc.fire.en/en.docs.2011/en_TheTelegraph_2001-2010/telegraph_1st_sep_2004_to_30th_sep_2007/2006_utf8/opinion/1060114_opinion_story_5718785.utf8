The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THE TAP DANCER

 Amar Singh has often been in the news. But more often than not, he makes the news as, for instance, when he alleges that his telephone has been tapped 

 You nearly didnt recognise Amar Singh on television the other day. The general secretary of the Samajwadi Party is always on TV, of course ? but is mostly to be seen smirking. But there he was this last week ? all blue in the face and desperately fumbling for words. 

 That was surprising, for Amar Singh is not exactly shy and retiring. Ask the man who talked his way up the political and social ladder a question on the weather, and he will connect it to subjects as varied as the dynasty (he is against it), the Samajwadi Party (he is for it) and the Congress (he is for it and against it). So it was quite a change to find Amar Singh for once at a loss for words. 

 The Rajya Sabha member had his reasons, though. Recordings of tapped telephonic conversations are supposedly doing the rounds of New Delhi along with a slew of whispers. Political circles are abuzz with rumours about the contents of conversations allegedly between the businessman-politician and sundry Bollywood actresses. Singh himself has moved court, calling for a probe into the tapping issue. He alleged that apart from his own telephone, the personal telephones of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav and his parliamentarian son Akhilesh Yadav had been tapped. 

 But Amar Singhs reactions have been surprisingly frantic. He first lammed the Central government. Then he took pot-shots at Congress MP Ambika Soni. He went on to cast aspersions on 10 Janpath and said dark things about the role of Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Then, in a sudden volte face on Thursday, he declared that the Samajwadi Party was not going to sever ties with the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government after all. 

 Actually, he needed to speak just three lines, says one of his former colleagues. One, he should have said it was illegal. Two, it was unethical and three, that he would take legal action. Instead, he points out, Amar Singh went around in circles, saying and unsaying things. 

 Amar Singh, of course, has often been in the news. But more often than not, he makes the news as a barker, commenting on a development featuring, not him, but the real movers and shakers. When Mulayam Singh muses on whether or not to support the UPA government, Amar Singh speaks out as his trusted lieutenant. When the Ambani brothers feud, Amar Singh is in the news as their anxious friend. And when Amitabh Bachchan ails, he is the younger brother who gives a daily health bulletin to the press. 

 Singhs friends ? and its a powerful lot ? will say its because Singh has a way with words. His detractors ? and they are quite a legion, too ? will have it that the man talks too much. But the two disparate lots will agree on one thing ? its not often that you see Amar Singh tying himself up in knots. He is a bit of a filmi character, but Amar Singh is essentially what you see, says one of Mulayam Singh Yadavs erstwhile aides. 

 There is some glee in former socialist circles, for Amar Singh has never been a favourite of Mulayams old friends. The old socialist group is very upset with Mulayam Singh for allowing Amar Singh to hijack the party, says a political analyst. Many believe that Amar Singh, a former Congressman who was made the general secretary of the Samajwadi Party in 1996, opened up a new world for Mulayam and changed the face of the party. Suddenly, the OBC leader was hobnobbing with Anil Ambani, the Bachchans and Sahara chief Subroto Roy ? all courtesy Amar Singh. 

 But even for Amar Singh, its quite a different world from the one that he grew up in. In the Seventies, as a nondescript young man, he toyed with politics while with the students wing of the Congress in Calcutta, a city that his locksmith father had moved to from his hometown Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh. That was when he came in touch with the partys then young leaders ? Priyaranjan Das Munshi, Subroto Mukherjee and others ? and went on to become the secretary of the district Congress committee. Singh later told journalists that he was banished from home after he refused to join his fathers business. He went to Uttar Pradesh to find his own fortunes ? and found Vir Bahadur Singh. 

 The late UP chief minister was his mentor, but it was the late Congress leader, Madhavrao Scindia, who helped Amar Singh find his place in politics. But not everybody in the party was happy with Singh, who was finally denied a Rajya Sabha seat ? apparently at the behest of an old Madhya Pradesh warhorse. Actually, Amar Singh has no political ambition, says an old socialist. And neither is he a vote catcher or a Thakur leader as is often claimed, he says. What he is is the quintessential party man. He likes to party with actors and actresses, and usually succeeds in roping in stars and starlets for political campaigns. He even did a cameo in a 2000 film called Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai, and is now said to be playing himself in Apne, starring Dharmendra and three other male Deols. 

 But Singh ? proud father of twin girls ? insists that politics is his first love. Unfortunately for him, politics and cinema got tangled up, leaving the poor man all wired up.

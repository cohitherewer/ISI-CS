The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PART OF DAILY LIFE

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Indias GDP is reported to be growing at more than 8 per cent, notwithstanding the inflation, the petrol price hike, the hazards of tsunami, drought and other natural disasters. That India is shining in patches, there is no doubt. Few, however, seem to notice that the pace of corruption is outshining all else. Ironically, Indians do not oppose, at least strongly, the injustice inflicted on them by corruption.

 Yet a revolution of sorts recently took place in Delhi when the Delhi government dismissed 31 officials of the VAT department summarily after a private television channel showed them taking bribe on camera. The clippings were sufficient enough for the state government to register cases, suspend and arrest 81 officials, and subsequently dismiss some of them.

 This bold action of the government deserves kudos from all and sundry as the decision to dismiss was taken despite the fact that an inquiry was not possible in this case. This is thus a landmark decision. Questions may be raised as to the legality and morality of the decision. As a counter-point one may argue that India today is perceived as one of the most corruption-ridden countries in the world. It is most visible in the corruption index although it is virtually invisible when it comes to winning an Olympic medal. India, however, could derive some satisfaction from the fact that it has beaten Pakistan and Bangladesh in the corruption index. 

 Pakistans leading daily, The Dawn, has recently made a startling revelation. According to it, petty corruption in the form of bribery at the lowest levels in government departments costs Pakistanis approximately Rs 45 billion annually. Since Pakistans GDP in 2005 was $ 110 billion, compared to Indias $ 761 billion, one could make a fair guess about the ratio of corruption in the two countries.

 New creed

 The Dawn further says that the estimated Rs 45 billion does not include the cost of corruption that is prevalent in the higher echelons in the form of commissions and omissions in the privatization deals, defence and construction contracts, the stock market crashes, the hoarding and black marketing by sugar, cement, oil and automobile cartels or rip offs like the dubious Daimler Chrysler, Black cabs and Mercedez deals. In the context, it would be worthwhile to remember Transparency Internationals observations. It notes that multinational companies belonging to leading industrial countries like America, Japan, Italy, Russia, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia are pursuing a criminal course to win contracts in the leading emerging market economies of the world.

 One of the most disastrous events for Pakistan, ever since its birth in 1947, has been its break-up into two nations. Though a speculative and unsubstantiated guess, did corruption have a role to play in the demise of a united Pakistan in 1971? In case it has, one can only say that the rising rate of bribery and lack of probity will only worsen the future of this nation in turmoil. 

 Mass-scale corruption can pose a threat not only to the economics of a country but also to political stability, thus causing incalculable damage to the unity and integrity of a nation. Pakistan, as seen from the perspective of The Dawn, may be an extreme case but the threat to India is no less. Corruption in the Fifties and Sixties may have been borne out of a need, but it subsequently turned to greed. Today, the all-pervading corruption in India is a powerful creed.

 Seen in this light, the sacking of 31 officials by the Delhi government deserves praise. It is time to implement a zero level tolerance of corruption, as was once loftily professed by a former prime minister of India on October 15, 1999 from the ramparts of the Raisina Hills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PASSES, GOALS AND CARDS

 The curtain will come down on the soccer World Cup on Sunday night-Monday morning. Of course, in Berlin, London, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires ? and one could say Calcutta ? the World Cup ended earlier on in the week. A final between France and Italy was not an encounter that many people expected. In a sense, one can see the final as the triumph of traditional Europe, which is devastated but still beautiful in places. The French and the Italians will derive some pleasure from the fact that Germany was eliminated before the finals. Germany not only represents the resurgent new Europe, it also plays a brand of football that is efficient and robot-like. It lacks the artistry and the soul of Latin American soccer. In the context of this polarity, the style of football played by France and Italy falls somewhere in between. It is not as artistic as Latin American football and not as disciplined and cold-blooded as the German version. It is also perhaps somewhat apposite that these two teams are fighting for the title. The football played by both Brazil and Argentina was on the whole lacklustre by their own high standards. They deserved not to be in the finals. Italy outplayed Germany; Portugal lost to France.

 A World Cup final is invariably a tension-ridden affair. This inevitably hampers the quality of football that is put on display. The real moments of magic always come early on in the tournament. This World Cup ? unless the final match throws up a real surprise ? was no exception. Football fans irrespective of who they were supporting will recall, till the next World Cup, those enchanting minutes when the Argentinian team wove a net through 24 passes before scoring a goal against Serbia-Montenegro. It was modern football and precision passing at their very best. Similarly, Zinedine Zidane?s curling free kick from the far left corner that sealed Brazil?s fate. The kick carried enough in the air to beat the defenders, it curled and fell at the right height in front of Thierry Henry?s boots. Even a babe could have scored from such a peach of a shot. This World Cup will also be remembered for the fine performance of teams from whom very little was expected: Ghana, Australia, Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, Croatia and so on.

 Football is the contact sport par excellence and therefore refereeing a football game at the highest level is always a challenge. Refereeing was on the strict side this World Cup, but this did not really appear to hamper the flow of play. The match between the Netherlands and Portugal in the pre-quarter stage was an exception. The match saw four red cards and 16 yellow ones. English fans will continue to claim that the sending off of Wayne Rooney in the match against Portugal was uncalled for.

 The month-long football bonanza comes to an end on a slight note of bathos, at least in Calcutta. But for lovers of football, it is not the team but the game that goes on forever.

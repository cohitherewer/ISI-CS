 BUDGET WITHOUT REFORMS 

 Is the trend of 8 per cent GDP growth on auto-pilot or have Central government policies contributed? And if the target growth is 10 per cent, as the finance minister told us, what should the budget do to enable this? This is the yardstick against which the budget for 2006-07 should be evaluated. Mr P. Chidambaram himself believes that there is a correlation between reforms and growth. Yet, reform components in this budget are hard to find. The peak manufacturing import duty will drop to 12.5 per cent, the countervailing duty of 4 per cent will extend to all products (4 per cent is not high enough) and aerated drinks and small cars will face a uniform Cenvat rate of 16 per cent. That is all. The deadline for the uniform goods and service tax is 2010, not now. Not only have reform issues like subsidy targeting, privatization, labour-market laws, improving efficiency of government expenditure and small-scale industry de-reservation not been addressed, the budget is retrograde in directing credit to agriculture at specified rates of interest. It is also retrograde within tax reform, since the logic of fringe benefit tax, securities transaction tax and banking cash transaction tax have all been questioned. Not only do these irrational elements continue, they have been compounded by increase in the minimum alternative tax. The test of deficits is not so much the fiscal deficit, but the revenue deficit. There is a target of a zero revenue deficit in 2008-09, under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. Last year, the finance minister pressed the pause button on fiscal consolidation and we are told that reforms have been resumed from 2006-07. The revenue estimate figures of 2005-06 show a revenue deficit to GDP ratio of 2.6 per cent and the budget estimate for 2006-07 has an estimate of 2.1 per cent.

 Even if this 2.1 per cent is attained, it will be impossible for future finance ministers to slash the revenue deficit by 1 percentage point of GDP a year. Moreover, with end-use excise notifications being discontinued and with additional service sector taxation (with hike in rates to 12 per cent), the tax revenue and growth projections seem too optimistic. Moving on to expenditure, Mr Chidambaram himself acknowledges that the best solution to poverty is growth. If that proposition is valid, why does the budget include a rash of new government expenditure programmes? On both expenditure and tax reform, Mr Chidambaram has not delivered. 

 These may appear to be bad tidings, but it is perhaps a misconception to expect major prescriptions for economic reforms in the budget. An accounting exercise by definition cannot be a policy statement. Mr Chidambaram?s latest budget carries signs of the government?s endeavour to step back from the economy and let the market determine the economy?s performance. This distancing of the government from the economy is one of the underlying principles of liberalization that the finance minister is trying to establish. In this profound sense, this is a reformist budget even though it lacks reform prescriptions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PAST AND FUTURE

 It is a measure of the confidence that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the chief minister of West Bengal, has been able to create among investors that Calcutta is being seen as the inaugurator of the Indian renaissance in the 21st century, just as it had pioneered an earlier one in the 19th century. A very senior member of Infosys, Mr T.V. Mohandas Pai, has made this reading of the future. Indeed, if a poll were to be taken among potential investors regarding the future of West Bengal, very few would disagree with the essence of Mr Pai?s assessment. This turnaround in perception about West Bengal, a state ruled by communists for nearly three decades, is a remarkable achievement for which Mr Bhattacharjee can with justification claim credit. Without gainsaying the optimism that is in the air, there is cause for worry when a parallel is drawn between the promised renaissance of the 21st century and the one that belongs to the history of the 19th century.

 It is undeniable that the spurt of creativity that Bengal experienced in the 19th century ? from poetry to novels, from drama to essays, and from social reform to religious reformation, from advances in education to the formulation of political ideas ? is somewhat unprecedented. This achievement inspired the famous comment of Gopal Krishna Gokhale: ?What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow.? The sheer sweep and grandeur of the 19th century achievement tempted many historians and commentators to compare Bengal to Italy in the 15th century. Bengal was seen as the harbinger of modernity, and even of freedom from foreign rule. But later historians of the Seventies showed that the great artistic achievements of the 19th century were bereft of solid economic underpinnings. The industrial economy remained under foreign control, agriculture languished as it fell into a vicious cycle of indebtedness and absentee landlordism and the traditional crafts were destroyed. The giants of the 19th century renaissance largely remained untouched by these conditions. There was thus the strange paradox: the world of letters and intellect was marked by a profound engagement with modern ideas but the economy was half-cocked in the movement to be modern. This is not an experience that is worth replicating.

 The 21st century offers a different prospect since the promised renaissance has begun by changes in the economy rather than in the realm of culture. The economy has been geared up to receive massive inputs of industrial capital. This holds the key to providing employment and improved standards of living. Such a transformation should provide a more solid basis for the encounter with the West in the world of ideas. The 21st-century renaissance, when it happens, will be radically different from its predecessor in the 19th century.

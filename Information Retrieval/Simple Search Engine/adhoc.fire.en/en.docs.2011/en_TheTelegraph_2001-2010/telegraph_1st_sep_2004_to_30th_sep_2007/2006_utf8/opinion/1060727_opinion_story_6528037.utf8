The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MORE VIGILANCE

 How a country defends its border is determined by its threat perceptions. New Delhi?s decision to strengthen the vigil on the India-Bangladesh border can, therefore, mean only one thing ? India?s perception of a worsening security threat from across that border. Such a step was clearly necessitated by recent skirmishes between the two sides. The present regime in Dhaka has pursued a strange policy with regard to India?s complaints. It simply denies that anyone or anything in Bangladesh poses a threat to India?s security. This despite India?s complaints about the infiltration of Bangladeshis into India, the activities of the northeastern militants based across the border and more recently, the growth of a network of terror there. The involvement of Bangladeshi terror groups in subversive activities in India is increasingly coming to the fore. The latest proof of this came after the blasts in Mumbai. But Dhaka?s denials fly in the face of all such evidence. The rise in the incidents of firing across the border is a result of the diplomatic stalemate over these issues. An increase in the deployment of forces on any border is seen by the other side as an unfriendly act. But Dhaka has left New Delhi with no choice. 

 However, borders are not just geographical lines; there are people living along them. Unquiet borders can be dangerous places for the people living near them. The tensions on the eastern border have led to deaths on both sides. The powers to take ?punitive? action that have now been given to the battalion commanders of the Border Security Force, therefore, have to be exercised with extreme caution. There have been complaints about the BSF?s ham-handed treatment of the people living on the border in West Bengal. Worse, BSF jawans have sometimes been found to have links with smugglers and other criminal groups in the border areas. It is for the BSF to ensure that its increased strength does not become a matter of concern for the local people.

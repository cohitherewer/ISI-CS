 Letters to Editor

 On the right track

 Sir ? The Indian Railways advertisements, with Lalu Prasad?s pictures emblazoned on them (?All it took to achieve this is few simple decisions of the ?man of the masses??, Dec 31 ) calls to mind an author?s dedication: ?To my wife, without whose absence this book could not have been written?. Prasad?s preoccupation with Bihar has no doubt enabled a competent technocracy to rescue the railways from the mess left by a series of former railway ministers. Moral: give the railways to someone whose priorities lie elsewhere.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bishan Sahai, Calcutta

 Name?s sake

 Sir ? In the context of the renaming of Bangalore as Bengaluru, it would be worthwhile to mention that renaming does allow a city to be in sync with its cultural past (Ramachandra Guha, ?A divided city?, Dec 24). However, one doubts if politicians favouring renaming are really interested in uplifting the cultural legacy of the city. More often than not, it is a calculated exercise to shore up the sagging careers of politicians. A name change can have significance only if it advances the cause of the marginalized in a more effective way. Can those behind the proposed re-christening of Bangalore assure us that the renamed city will be purged of vices or crimes like the one which led to the recent death of a BPO worker?

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? After Bombay, Madras and Calcutta were consigned to the graveyard of history, Bangalore remained the last symbol of India?s broadness and tolerance. That may change now. The next casualty is perhaps going to be New Delhi, and finally, India itself. Where is it all going to end? The Kannadiga proportion of Bangalore?s population is less than half. Bangalore is not only a Kannada city but also a major national metropolis and a cyber city. It belongs to India and the world. It is undemocratic of the Karnataka government to act only on the basis of the opinion of a group of Kannada writers. It has a moral obligation to seek a referendum before taking such a drastic decision. The name-changers should remember that ?Benda Kaal Ooru? was a cluster of villages; it acquired its urban personality as a cantonment city only under the British regime. Now it has become India?s Silicon Valley owing to the IT boom. Instead of pandering to populist demands, we should move with the times. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asiananda, Opeinde, The Netherlands

 Sir ? No tangible benefit seems to have accrued from changing the names of Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, and Trivandrum. The decision to rename Bangalore as Bengaluru will also be a futile exercise. There seems to be no limit to the absurdities that governments will indulge in while giving the short shrift to more important things like improving healthcare and education for the benefit of the common man to whom how the capital city is spelt hardly makes a difference. After Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, it was only a matter of time before the parochial contagion caught up with the Kannadigas. A deep sense of insecurity, both among the intellectuals and the media, seems to have spurred on this sentiment.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The politicians of Karnataka want to divert the attention of the public from important issues like poverty, corruption, law and order and so on, to the trivialities concerning the change of name. The change will not make any difference to the people, but a substantial amount of money will be spent in effecting it, and deplete precious state funds.The government of Karnataka needs to seriously re-assess its priorities.

 Yours faithfully, 

 B.S. Ganesh, Bangalore

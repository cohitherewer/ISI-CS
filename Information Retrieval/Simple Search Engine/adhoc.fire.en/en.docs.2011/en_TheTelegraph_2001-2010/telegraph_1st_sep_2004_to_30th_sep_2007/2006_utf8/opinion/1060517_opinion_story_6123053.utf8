 TO BRIDGE THE GREAT DIVIDE 

It is now time to think about how to use different means 

to deepen and widen social and economic equality in India, writes Achin Vanaik 

 Unwelcome change 

What should be the response to Arjun Singh?s proposal 

for 27 per cent OBC quotas in higher education by those who are deeply committed 

to promoting greater social equality through and beyond measures of affirmative 

action? One says ?beyond? because affirmative action in jobs and tertiary education, 

though politically necessary and practically helpful, is not the main pathway 

to the construction of a more egalitarian society. For that, far more foundational 

changes are required such as a major redistribution of income and wealth generating 

assets like land, structural reorganization of the public, primary and secondary 

education systems to ensure quality education, employment-generating policies, 

and so on.

But this does not mean that affirmative action, though 

basically a supplement to these far more fundamental measures, is not important. 

It widens the caste composition of the middle classes and elites, which is a good 

thing. Even more significantly, it is a constant symbolic reminder that we have 

gone nowhere far or deep enough in creating a more egalitarian society. Its persistence 

is a standing affront to right-wing conservatives who argue that the pursuit of 

equality has gone too far. Though lip service might be paid to the principle of 

affirmative action, such conservatives are for the weakening or even rapid abandonment 

of the principle of affirmative action in the name of efficiency and liberty.

There are then two levels at which one must engage 

with this issue of other backward classes reservations in higher education. There 

are the specific pros and cons of the proposal, the motives behind it, the effects 

it is likely to have, and possible superior alternative forms of affirmative action. 

Then, at a more fundamental level, there is the question of strongly resisting 

the systematic attack waged by powerful sections of the Indian elite against the 

sustained pursuit of social equality, which disguises itself behind the tirade 

against Arjun Singh?s proposal. In this regard, it is extraordinary that there 

are some who see no contradiction between claiming that they do endorse the principle 

of affirmative action (though not further reservations) to promote equality and 

their espousal of an Indian economic agenda clearly neoliberal in its overall 

thrust. 

Neoliberalism creates greater inequalities of income, 

wealth and power and is justified in the name of higher growth rates and ?prosperity 

for all?. It operates with a conception of ?efficiency-excellence? that ignores 

the skewed social distribution of financial material and cultural capital. In 

all societies, the three most crucial determinants of one?s social position, status 

and prospects are inheritance, birth, and then, lagging way behind, merit (in 

that order); where merit must never be measured by the end point reached ? how 

far up one has travelled economically, professionally or academically ? but by 

the distance travelled between one?s starting and end points.

When neoliberals oppose egalitarian measures in the 

name of ?defending liberty?, what they have in mind is ?freedom of choice? of 

the individual. But the rights elevated here as being primary are those of the 

individual as a consumer, not as a citizen or a producer, and they are to be exercised 

through the?neutral? market. It is a ?freedom? whose content is inextricably linked 

to wealth, which gives one the capacity to exercise greatest choice in the marketplace. 

Not surprisingly, neoliberals are among the strongest advocates of privatization, 

commodification and monetization of education and healthcare services. Since this 

Congress-led government is deeply committed to neoliberalism, the current proposal 

of OBC reservations can quite justifiably be seen as a political gimmick, a way 

of establishing false egalitarian credentials, and as a way of pushing more upper 

caste and better-off students into the private tertiary education sector. With 

some exceptions, entry into private colleges and institutions is not a function 

of excellence but of money. Even enrolment to public ?centres of excellence? such 

as the IITs and the IIMs and the best government engineering and medical colleges 

are now filled up by candidates who have taken expensive pre-exam courses in specialized 

training institutes that have cracked the entrance examination system.

There is an issue of quotas restricting ?merit-based? 

competitive access to good public institutions. But with an ever-expanding private 

education sector, it is not an argument that can be given anywhere near as much 

weight as claimed for it. Once it is clear where one stands ? against neoliberalism; 

for foundational changes in the redistribution of income, wealth, power and life 

chances; for the investment of greater resources in, and more egalitarian restructuring 

of, the public primary, secondary and tertiary education systems; for unequivocal 

defence of the principle of affirmative action ? then there is certainly a strong 

case to be made for alternative, more sophisticated forms of affirmative action 

than OBC quotas.

Mandal I was vital because the stakes then were much 

higher. It is often forgotten that at the time, influential voices were clamouring 

for an end to reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. Mandal I 

diverted upper caste attention away from this to the OBCs effectively, protecting 

affirmative action programmes for SCs and STs. Furthermore, it inaugurated the 

?politics of recognition? for other lower castes, highlighting the moral unacceptability 

of all-pervasive caste discrimination.

We now have to think more perceptively about how to 

use a variety of means to make constant and cumulative progress in deepening and 

widening social and economic equality. Quota reservations are the bluntest of 

instruments unable to cope with the considerable variations in power, wealth and 

suffering within the OBCs themselves and responsible for reproducing a creamy 

layer rather than for substantially expanding it. That most political parties 

today would not dare to oppose such quotas is testimony to the political resonance 

that lower caste resurgence now has in Indian politics. But these parties, including 

those that most strongly identify with OBCs, Dalits and adivasis, have 

done little or nothing to promote the more foundational changes required. In that 

respect the ?politics of recognition? has not led to, or promoted, or even seriously 

joined, a ?politics of redistribution?. 

This is the crucial strategic need of our times and 

utterly incompatible with the ideology or policies inspired by neoliberalism. 

As for affirmative action, we must move towards devising a range of more sophisticated 

and subtler forms of affirmative action that can be sufficiently sensitive to 

the complex specificities of the social, economic and educational terrains to 

which they are to be applied.

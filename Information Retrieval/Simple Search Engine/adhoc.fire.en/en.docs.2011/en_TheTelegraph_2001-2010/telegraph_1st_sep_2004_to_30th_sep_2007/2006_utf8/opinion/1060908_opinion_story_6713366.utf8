The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 HIGH AND LOW

 The stock market has rallied smartly from the lows it reached after the meltdown in mid-May, and is now within sight of its all-time highs. Are the fears that prompted the crash in May firmly behind us now? Or is the current rally a dead-cat bounce? These are the questions that are uppermost in the minds of investors. One thing that has changed since the May crash has been the outlook for corporates. The first quarter results have been much better than expected and that has proved to be a shot in the arm for the market. Although stock valuations are once again approaching elevated levels, higher earnings growth will help justify those high multiples. At bottom, however, the biggest difference has been made by the return of the foreign institutional investors. The simple fact is that the crash occurred because FIIs started selling and their return has sparked a rally. The big question is whether these inflows will continue. That will depend, not just on conditions in India, but also on global factors. As a matter of fact, the market crash in May was triggered by fears that inflation was getting out of hand in the United States of America and that the US Federal Reserve would have to hike interest rates more than earlier anticipated. Attention was also focused on tightening by central banks across the world. The Bank of Japan took steps to shrink its monetary base and raised interest rates. So did the European Central Bank. These measures to tighten liquidity were viewed by the markets with concern, because the markets had been riding on the wave of liquidity unleashed by central banks earlier. The prospects of a withdrawal of liquidity spooked the markets. 

 Since then, the US Federal Reserve has hit the pause button as has the Japanese central bank. That led to another bout of panic, with several economists warning that the US economy was in danger of a sharp slowdown. And since the US economy is a major engine of the world economy, markets throughout the globe tottered. Thankfully, however, recent data from the US indicates that while the economy is slowing it is all set to make a soft landing. Crude-oil prices too have been falling. In short, with interest rates on hold and with expectations that global growth will continue, albeit at a slower pace, the market has once again perked up. But the jury is still out on whether the not-too-hot, not-too-cold Goldilocks global economy is back. That is reflected in the low volumes in the market. Investors should accordingly be wary of momentum plays and look instead for long-term value.

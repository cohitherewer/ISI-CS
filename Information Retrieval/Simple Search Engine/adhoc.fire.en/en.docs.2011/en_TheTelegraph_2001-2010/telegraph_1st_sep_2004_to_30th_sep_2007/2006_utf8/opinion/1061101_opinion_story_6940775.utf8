 BANK ON IT

 The Reserve Bank of Indias mid-term review of monetary policy sprang a surprise on the bond markets by keeping the reverse repo rate (the rate at which the RBI borrows from banks) unchanged while increasing the repo rate (the rate at which it lends to banks) by 25 basis points. Liquidity is currently ample, which means that banks have not been borrowing from the RBI. In the circumstances, raising the repo rate does not carry much weight. On the contrary, since banks park their surplus funds with the RBI, it is the reverse repo rate that is more important to them at present. No wonder then that the policy statement had little impact on bond prices. The RBI is indicating that as long as current liquidity conditions continue, there is no need to raise interest rates. If, however, the economy overheats and credit growth is so strong that banks cannot fund it out of their deposits and have to borrow from the RBI, then they should be prepared to pay a higher price for those resources. The RBI is suggesting that if the economy overheats, interest rates will rise automatically, without the RBI having to come out with another policy statement. It is not true that the RBI has not tightened: by hiking the repo rate, it has increased the cost of funds for banks, which is a clear tightening signal. The only caveat is that interest rates need not rise immediately it is only when credit growth outstrips the growth in deposits that the interest rate increases will be necessary. Of course, banks may well seize the opportunity to hike rates even before that happens.

 The reason for the RBIs decision to send this half-signal is the RBIs lack of clarity about whether the Indian economy is overheated and, if it is, whether its earlier rate hikes will be sufficient to deal with it. The policy statement says that at the current juncture, for policy purposes, the two major issues that exert conflicting pulls are exploration of signs of overheating firming up to warrant a policy response, and, the impact of lagged effects of earlier policy action on the evolution of macroeconomic developments. It believes, however, that while there is no conclusive evidence of overheating, and though traditional indicators may overestimate demand pressures, it will be risky to ignore the prevalence and relevance of these factors. Hiking the repo rate while keeping the reverse repo rate unchanged is therefore the most prudent policy at the moment. 

 Besides the rate signal, the Central bank has also ushered in another major change by allowing banks to carry short positions for five trading days, while currently only intra-day short positions are allowed. This will increase depth in the debt markets and would ensure that the markets are less unidirectional. And finally, the prompt implementation of some of the recommendations on capital account convertibility is a pleasant surprise.

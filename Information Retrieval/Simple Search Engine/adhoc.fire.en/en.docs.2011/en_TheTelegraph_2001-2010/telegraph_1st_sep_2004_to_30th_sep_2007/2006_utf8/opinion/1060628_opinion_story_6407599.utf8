The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BOLD AND RISKY

 Calculated risks are part of peace initiatives everywhere. New Delhi?s decision to move towards a ceasefire with the United Liberation Front of Asom is a bold, if somewhat risky, move. It reflects the government?s resolve to go ahead with the peace process even in the face of risks and irritants. This is proved also by New Delhi?s other decision to consider the release of five jailed Ulfa leaders. Yet, the decisions, taken at last week?s meeting between the Centre and the Ulfa?s mediators, came at an uncertain time for the peace process. Only days before the meeting, Assam had been rocked by a series of bomb blasts that killed several people and injured many others. Although the Ulfa disowned any responsibility for the violence, the government was not so sure that the outfit had no hand in it. For many years, the Ulfa had used violence as a negotiating tool. New Delhi and Dispur must be complimented that they did not let the violence cloud the forthcoming talks. In fact, the progress at the talks is quite extraordinary in the given context. 

 It is now up to the Ulfa to prove worthy of the trust and pave the way for the next phase of the peace process. The people?s consultative committee, which the Ulfa had constituted to represent its case with the Centre, has played its role successfully. The committee, representing Assam?s civil society, has been able to convince the Centre that peace in Assam is a matter that involves not just the Ulfa, but all sections of the Assamese people. The real challenge, however, will come when the Ulfa leaders themselves join the talks. The substantive issues will have to be identified and differences over them narrowed. As with the Naga peace talks, the most sensitive of the issues could be the Ulfa?s demand for ?sovereignty?. But the Naga talks prove that no demand, however intractable, is stronger than a commitment to peace. Sceptics may still argue against a formal declaration of a ceasefire in Assam. But an overcautious approach has not worked in Assam. It is time to take bold chances for the sake of peace.

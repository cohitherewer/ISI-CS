 A WORLD LOST FOREVER

 On the prowl

 The Wild Animals 

 of India, Burma, 

 Malaya and Tibet 

 By R. Lydekker, 

 Natraj, Rs 450

 Those who have read The Man-eating Leopard of Rudraprayag by Jim Corbett are unlikely to forget the memorable passage in which a pensive Corbett is seen looking down at his fearful adversary, now lying dead at his feet, felled by a single bullet from his gun. This leopard, in a terrible reign of eight years, had killed 125 men, women and children in the hills of Garhwal. And all that Corbett has to say is that the poor beast?s only fault was that it had broken an inviolable law of nature. A love for the natural world is expressed in these simple words by an Englishman who was perhaps the finest raconteur of shikar tales. 

 Richard Lydekkar?s book on wild animals in India and its neighbouring countries during the raj is very different from Corbett?s tales. Thrilling accounts of tracking a man-eater, poignant descriptions of the beauty of the jungle in early light or glimpses of the simple life in Garhwal are not to be found here. Instead, it is a compendium of the rich variety of wildlife that existed in the country during the early half of the 20th century. The pedantic tone might disappoint those who are eager to savour exciting accounts of hunts in the forest. But Lydekker?s rich and detailed account of Indian wildlife would come across as invaluable to those who are interested in the natural history of the subcontinent and beyond. 

 Lydekker was an English naturalist of considerable repute. His book provides, in one great sweep, a list of the fauna belonging to two great zoological provinces ? the ?Oriental region? and the ?Eastern Holarctic region?. Some of the species that have been described in great detail are well known even to laymen ? the Asiatic elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, lion, leopard and the bear. However, there are others that have become rare or are on the verge of extinction today ? the musk deer, snow leopard and the wolf.

 A sportsman, Lydekker provides engaging anecdotes about these animals and the best ways to hunt some of them. Not many would know that in young elephants, tusks are preceded by a pair of milk teeth that are shed soon, or that the best method of hunting the Arna (the Indian buffalo) is by following the animal on foot to a poolside during the hot summer months. Lydekker?s excitement with the tiger is not surprising, given the Western fascination with the lord of the Indian jungle. The descriptions of the tiger ? its hunting skills, habits and even the different kinds of roar ? are illuminating. 

 There are excerpts from other accounts depicting the dangers that lurk in a forest. V. Ball recounts a wild buffalo charging the elephant, Anarkali, forcing the magnificent animal to beat a hasty retreat at a pace that astounded the author. Another writer describes how a pair of tigers brought down an adult elephant by opening up its jugular. 

 Lydekkar also locates species within their particular cultural contexts. For instance, in India, animals like the tiger and the elephant, writes Lydekker, are an integral part of the country?s myths, folklore and art.Unfortunately, these passages are few and far between, something that makes the book rather dull to read.

 There are lessons to be drawn from Lydekker?s book. His depiction of India?s wilderness, once so full of myriad shapes and forms of life, only reminds us of the world that we seem to have lost forever.

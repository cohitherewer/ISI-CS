 MYSTERY OF THE MISSING WOMEN

 AMARTYA SEN, More Than 100 Million 

 Women Are Missing, The New York Review of Books, 

 December 20, 1990: ...we can estimate the number of missing 

 women in a country, say, China or India, by calculating 

 the number of extra women who would have been in China or 

 India if these countries had the same ratio of women to 

 men as obtain in areas of the world in which they receive 

 similar care. If we could expect equal populations of the 

 two sexes, the low ratio of 0.94 women to men in South Asia, 

 West Asia, and China would indicate a 6 per cent deficit 

 of women; but since, in countries where men and women receive 

 similar care, the ratio is about 1.05, the real shortfall 

 is about 11 per cent. In China alone this amounts to 50 

 million missing women, taking 1.05 as the benchmark ratio. 

 When that number is added to those in South Asia, West Asia, 

 and North Africa, a great many more than 100 million women 

 are missing. These numbers tell us quietly, a terrible 

 story of inequality and neglect leading to the excess mortality 

 of women. [The Princeton demographer, Ansley J. Coale, 

 reduced Sens 100 million figure to 60 million.]

 Poverty alone cannot be the explanation, 

 says Sen: For example, the ratio of women to men in the 

 Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, which happen to be 

 among the countrys richest, is a remarkably low 0.86, while 

 the state of Kerala...has a ratio higher than 1.03, similar 

 to that in Europe, North America, and Japan.

 In Punjab, Akal Takht, the highest 

 religious body of the Sikhs, issued an edict in 2002 punishing 

 female foeticide by excommunication. That hardly helped. 

 In August, 2006, 35 female foetuses were found in a well 

 behind a nursing home near Patiala.

 Sen had said, If this situation 

 is to be corrected by political action and public policy, 

 the reasons why there are so many missing women must be 

 better understood.

 EMILY OSTER, Hepatitis B and 

 the Case of the Missing Women, Journal of Political 

 Economy, 2005, vol. 113: I present new evidence, consistent 

 with an existing scientific literature, that carriers of 

 the Hepatitis B virus have offspring sex ratios around 1.50 

 boys for each girl....Since many of the countries with missing 

 women also have a relatively high prevalence of hepatitis 

 B carriers, the naturally occurring higher sex ratio at 

 birth could produce a higher population sex ratio even in 

 the absence of excess female mortality....after one adjusts 

 for differences in the sex ratio at birth caused by Hepatitis 

 B, the number of missing women (based on population estimates 

 from 1980-90) drops to 32 million from the 60 million calculated 

 by Coale (1991) and the 107 million suggested by Sen (1992). 

 There is significant variation among countries in the share 

 of the gender bias that is accounted for: I find that Hepatitis 

 B can explain 75 percent of the missing women in China but 

 less than 20 per cent in India, Pakistan, and Nepal.

 Going by this thesis, 33 million 

 girls were never born. But that does not solve the entire 

 mystery.

 Oster, in a later article, writes, 

 ...there is evidence that women in these regions have less 

 access to education than men, have low levels of bargaining 

 power in the household and are generally limited in their 

 choices....evidence in support of cultural explanations 

 by no means rules out biological ones.

 FADING OUT SLOWLY

 NEHA SAHAY

 The Peoples Daily had, two days back, a picture of President Hu Jintao visiting an exhibition in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the end of the Long March. More interesting than the premiers unsmiling face was the report that accompanied the picture. Not once did it mention the architect of the Long March, Mao Zedong, who was then one of the leaders of the communist party. 

 The history of modern China is incomplete without the Long March. And the Long March without Mao is like satyagraha without Gandhi. Yet, so great seems to be the hostility of the current Chinese government towards Mao, that their newspapers can actually write that the Long March was a famous military manoeuvre carried out by the Workers and Peasants Red Army led by the Communist Party of China, and pretend that the man who conceived and led it had no role to play in it. 

 This year, Maos 30th death anniversary, which fell on September 9, was made into a non-event. It was not observed officially at all. Xinhua, the official news agency, interviewed private citizens paying homage to Mao in Beijing and in his hometown, but preferred to release pictures only of his relatives observing the anniversary. There was no mention of any homage being paid by anyone in the communist party or in the government. Significantly, China Daily interviewed foreigners about their opinions on Mao, but not the Chinese themselves. As expected, the former had little positive to say. 

 Fond memories

 Earlier this year, new senior high school history textbooks introduced in Shanghai also minimized references to Mao to exactly one mention, though he gets fuller coverage in junior schools. Interestingly, Deng Xiao Ping features extensively in both junior and senior school texts. It is to make the study of history more mainstream and prepare our students for a new era, said Zhou Chunsheng, one of the authors. 

 Whatever the reasons for the Chinese governments dislike for Mao, respect for the Chairman is more widespread among the people than it appears. Some senior citizens, now living comfortably in new cities, prefer not to talk to foreigners about the days when these cities were poor villages. Others, however, will hear absolutely no criticism of him by their sceptical children. 

 It is the latter, aged between 40 and 50, who have surprisingly positive opinions about him, though they dislike his megalomania and ridicule the way they were taught to worship him. Children of the Cultural Revolution many of them have chosen to work for foreign companies are convinced that Maos successor, Deng, was absolutely right in turning his back on Maoist thought and opening up China. But they are convinced that their education during the Sixties and the Seventies, designed by Mao, a mix of academics taught by poorly paid teachers, and work in the fields, has made them what they are today. 

 Even those 30-somethings, whose only memory of life under Mao is that of regimented lives controlled by the party and rationed out food and clothes, take his role in the liberation of their country and its transformation as an unquestioned fact. Hearing stories about life in Indian villages, one such multinational employee, formerly the son of poor peasants, exclaimed, I understand. That was what Old China was. But Chairman Mao was very tough with the landlords. 

 Perhaps that is why 80-year-old Ge travelled two hours from Beijings suburbs and stood another two hours in a queue outside the Mao Mausoleum on September 9. Every year on this date I have lots of words that I want to tell Chairman Mao, so I left home before dawn for this hall, said Ge. I wanted to tell Chairman Mao that all my four sons had found jobs after graduating from college, and I, a farmer, have nothing to worry about in my late years.

 The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth By Benjamin Friedman, Knopf, Rs 1,299

 This sprawling and learned book has one simple thesis: economic growth has enormous social and political ramifications that are, for the most part, good. Economic growth is an enormous catalyst for creating a society that is open, generous and tolerant. The absence of growth, on the other hand, is likely to produce a society that is closed, mean to its fellow citizens and likely to succumb to intolerance and hate. Promoting growth is not just about creating material wealth, it is about creating conditions for a healthy political society. At one level, this thesis seems intuitively obvious. People are more likely to turn upon each other, more likely to succumb to irrational forces, when the future looks bleaker than the past. The experience of economic growth is one necessary (though not sufficient) component of the idea that the future will be better than the past. It is the most material manifestation of a profound human hope. If growth vanishes, so does hope; and as hope vanishes, so do all the things that make societies better: generosity, openness, reciprocity.

 Friedman marshals a huge amount of historical evidence to prove this thesis. His methodology is simple. He shows that in America and western Europe, periods of economic growth are accompanied by more liberal policies: expansion of civil liberties, openness to immigration, and substantial increases in social security and other provisions. Contrary to expectations, the civic consequences of growth are entirely beneficial. On the other hand, periods of economic slowdown are largely correlated with a closed politics. The case studies of America, Britain, France and Germany, and countries in the developing world examine their histories over a two hundred period and are models of learning and erudition. The chapters on American economic history are particularly well done. 

 But Friedman?s work is remarkable for its honesty in admitting where the evidence does not fit. For instance, while his thesis seems to be broadly true, there are two big counter examples he has to contend with. The first is the Great Depression in America, which, unlike in Europe during the Thirties, led to the New Deal rather than Fascism, and Friedman spends a lot of time wondering why this spectacular slowdown in growth led to a progressive politics rather than its reverse. The second great exception is, of course, China, which has seen the most spectacular growth rates without seeming liberalization of its politics.

 But here the jury might still be out. China has certainly seen a greater openness in its receptivity to the outside world, and political liberalism may indeed follow. But these exceptions do not detract from the central argument. As Friedman himself quotes Gerschenkron, ?Historical hypotheses are not universal propositions. They cannot be falsified by a single exception. Testing them largely means trying to discover the boundaries of the area in which they seem reasonably valid.?

 At any rate, what is clear is that no society is able to sustain liberal institutions if it experiences protracted periods of stagnation. In a way Friedman?s thesis both supports and contradicts the great Enlightenment hope. It supports Enlightenment hopes to the extent that growth has beneficial civic consequences; the bad news is that all economies need to keep growing. The economy is like a bicycle which you need to keep peddling, or you fall off. The moral psychology through which growth works is making us feel better off than we were in the past. So the crucial element is not an adequate level of material wellbeing but the possibility of improvement. In this sense there will never be enough. And it is precisely because it is the moral psychology that growth produces that matters that the distribution of growth will matter too. Enough people have to believe that they are better off for growth to work. Second, as Friedman points out, steady economic growth has more beneficial consequences than would the same average growth rate with higher volatility. Volatility seems as politically disastrous as stagnation.

 Friedman?s economic analysis is interesting for they reveal what many have suspected: that there is no single key to unlocking the mystery of growth. Time and again, one is struck by Friedman?s admission that economists don?t really have a good explanation for a particular episode of growth or stagnation. For instance, why did productivity decline to the extent it did in the US in the Seventies and Eighties? In that sense, this book demonstrates the value of large- scale comparative work, and stands as a reminder that most patterns of growth have defied orthodox economic theory rather than confirmed it. But this lack of theoretical clarity over growth gives Friedman?s policy prescriptions the character of eclecticism: they range from investment in education to moral values, organizational culture to tariff policy.

 For all his allegiances to the Enlightenment, Friedman, however, does duck one question. Is a simultaneous expansion of growth in all parts of the world forever possible? There is certainly no period of human history where this has happened for a sustained period; some countries do better at some moments and other countries at other times. Friedman is too much of an Enlightenment optimist to take the full force of this question seriously, he assumes that this must be possible. But whether growth will generate new horizons of peace is another matter.

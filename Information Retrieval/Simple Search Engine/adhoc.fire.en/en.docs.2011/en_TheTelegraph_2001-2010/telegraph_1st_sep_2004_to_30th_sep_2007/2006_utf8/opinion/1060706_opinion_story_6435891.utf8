 FRIENDSHIP IS A NUMBERS GAME

 A third front is again the buzz, with the left sounding out Chandrababu Naidu and Mulayam Singh Yadav. Sumanta Sen explores the possibilities

 Hyderabad blues? Not yet

 Once again the idea of forming a third front is floating around in the offices of political parties which are neither close to the Congress nor the Bharatiya Janata Party. The timing is interesting. With the left gradually distancing itself from the United Progressive Alliance, the feeling is growing that even if it does not pull the carpet from under the UPA?s feet, it would not like to be associated with the combine in the next Lok Sabha polls. Hence both the left and parties it hopes it can do business with are seeking to forge some kind of an alliance which will be able to take on both the UPA and the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.

 Officially the left, particularly the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is saying that it does not believe in an alliance or front just for the sake of winning elections. It wants to build up a force that can project the ?alternative economic path? that it always talks about. But that the exercise is actually all about votes becomes clear when one considers the CPI(M)?s eager response to N. Chandrababu Naidu?s overtures in Andhra Pradesh or Prakash Karat?s talk of a third front in Lucknow in the company of Mulayam Singh Yadav. Uttar Pradesh is going to the polls early next year and in Hyderabad, Naidu can only have in mind the elections in his state. So a third front will basically have the electoral struggle uppermost in its mind.

 And that is only natural. Chandrababu Naidu may talk about addressing the grievances of his people, but he still believes that the path is through reforms with a capital R. The CPI(M), or any other left party, cannot go along such a path, yet they will need each other to dislodge the Congress from office. So the alliance will again be essentially a seat adjustment arrangement, which is also what the UPA or the NDA is all about. In Uttar Pradesh too, what ideological common ground can the Marxists have with Mulayam Singh Yadav who wants to perpetuate the feudal social structure without which there can be no caste-based equation? Yet both are wary of the Congress as well as the BJP and though the Marxists are not much of a force, Mulayam Singh needs them for gaining credibility as well as for avoiding vote splits in even a few constituencies. That arrangement was there five years ago and can be arrived at again without resorting to agitations which the CPI(M) insists is the only way of forming a meaningful front. So whatever the public posturings may be, it is actually looking for a way of winning more seats.

 At the state level, things are simple. But a third front builds up images of a politically cohesive combination which will be able to win around 300 of the 540 Lok Sabha seats and form the government. Mathematically it is a hard call.

 What is the present scenario like? There are the four left parties, Naidu, Mulayam Singh, the Brindaban Goswami group of the Asom Gana Parishad, and not many others. Statewise we have West Bengal, Tripura, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Assam and even if a third front wins all the seats in these states, its number will be far short of the magic figure of 270.

 Also, for a front to succeed at the national level, it requires one major party with an all-India presence, like the Congress or the BJP. No party outside the influence of these two has such a presence, they are all regional forces. The two communist parties will of course never agree with this, but the fact remains that for all practical purposes they are confined to only three states. Yes, they have had electoral success in states like Tamil Naidu and Andhra Pradesh, but these have been almost wholly courtesy others. And if a front cannot garner votes from all parts of the country, then three years later (that is, if the Lok Sabha polls are not held earlier), it can emerge only as a major opposition block or as a support system to be taken more seriously than the left is under the present dispensation.

 That is what the existing scenario offers. But tarry a while; quietly, another force seems to be emerging. The various Janata Dals, the United, the Secular and the Biju, are holding talks aimed at a coming together. Writing in these columns a few weeks ago, when Sharad Yadav had shunted out George Fernandes, this contributor had spoken of just such a possibility. If a new Janata Dal does emerge, sans Fernandes and his erstwhile Samata Party, then it may well inject a bit of new life into the kind of front already spoken about. Yes, it is a fact that the JD(U) is still a part of the NDA, but if it breaks out and joins others, then the left should have no problems as it is already willing to sup with Naidu, who was the convener of the former secular United Front and then ditched it to throw his weight behind the BJP and its friends.

 The key state, of course, once again is Bihar. If a new Janata Dal does emerge, what does the CPI(M) do with Lalu Prasad in that state? For Lalu Prasad will continue to be out of any scheme that Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav may have in mind because the duo hate him and vice versa. Here, the Communist Party of India is in a better position as it had never lost any love for the present railway minister. Of course, since it is all about seats, the CPI(M) may also leave Lalu Prasad, for staying with him has not been of much help. Perhaps anticipating such a future, Lalu Prasad has begun his own quiet moves of drawing the two parties, as well as Ram Vilas Paswan, closely back to him. He is also trying to stay in the good books of the Congress as far as possible. So below the surface politics, Bihar seems to be once again in a state of flux. What happens to the state government if the Janata Dal parts company with BJP?

 But even a new Janata Dal does not really solve the numbers problem. To win the polls, the proposed front will have to make inroads into BJP strongholds like Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. None of the third front constituents can do that because they simply do not exist in those states. If the anti-incumbency factor in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh works against the BJP, then it will be the Congress which will gain. This can only leave the third front seeking consolation from the defeat of ?communalism?. But election is a numbers game.

 And polls being a numbers game, leaders are actually thinking statewise even as they talk of grabbing power at the Centre. H.D. Deve Gowda wants to keep the Congress away in Karnataka, Naidu wants it in Andhra and Mulayam Singh in UP. And the CPI(M) wants a bit of a toehold in these states to get rid of its identity as a three-state party.

 There is another point to ponder over. If the Congress fails again in UP, as it well may despite the supposed charisma of Rahul Gandhi, may it not change tracks and decide to be chummy with Mulayam Singh, keeping the Lok Sabha elections and the noises over the third front in mind? If that happens, Mulayam Singh may well respond, for that will mean one less enemy to deal with. It may be recalled that at one point he was a little soft towards the BJP also. So if Mulayam Singh also does a Lalu Prasad, what happens to the proposed front? A parallel may also be drawn with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu which was with the United Front, then the NDA and now the UPA. The party?s name is also being mentioned in connection with the third front. Is it a reliable ally?

 The CPI(M) was right initially when it rejected any idea of another electoral adjustment as serving no political purpose. Even now it had not wholly moved away from that position, but the parleys in Hyderabad and Lucknow indicate that it is prepared to do so. Actually, the alternative of building up a support base through a sustained and programmatic political activity has, for some reasons, turned out to be impossible outside the three states and the Karats and Yechuris are perhaps also more interested in grabbing what they can and in whatever way. And if, in the process, the numbers go up, there is nothing like it. So the possibility of a third front posing any real challenge to the UPA is remote as its constituents are not showing any signs of veering away. Yet that is essential for any success of an alternative secular front.

 As for the BJP, it is in a bit of a shambles right now. On top of this, if an important ally like the JD(U) dissolves its identity in a larger formation and obviously is not part of the NDA any longer, then the saffron brigade will be in real trouble. Its leaders may actually welcome a third front to split as much of the secular votes as possible. Karat and company will surely have to keep this in mind.

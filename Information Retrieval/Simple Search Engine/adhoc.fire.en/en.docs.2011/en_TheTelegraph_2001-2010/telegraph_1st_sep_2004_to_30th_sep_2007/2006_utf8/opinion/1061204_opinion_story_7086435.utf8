 WHAT AILS NAGA PEACE TALKS?

 Twenty-Twenty Bharat Bhushan

 Task cut out

 When the Indian and Naga negotiators meet in Amsterdam today and tomorrow, they will find that several things have gone wrong with the Naga peace talks since the ceasefire extension in July. At that time, it seemed as if a major breakthrough had occurred with the two sides agreeing to a non-paper entitled, Framework for a new relationship. This was meant to be a roadmap for negotiating a federal relationship between the Nagas and New Delhi. It used broadly acceptable language on how to proceed with deciding on the competencies that would fall within the purview of the Nagas, those that would be under the purview of Delhi and those that would be managed jointly.

 The non-paper also dealt with where and how a separate Naga constitution, if agreed to, could be placed within the framework of the Indian Constitution. It committed the two sides to study the Indian Constitution to see which portions would apply, not apply or would need modification with respect to Nagaland. It was a good proposition and a practical way of moving forward.

 However, precious time has been wasted since then on quibbling over the non-paper itself. Wisdom would have demanded that the two sides make some movement forward on the basis of the agreed roadmap rather than trying to modify it in minute detail. A series of statements from the leaders of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) suggested that the Nagas were backtracking in public to what they had agreed in private. This put the non-paper itself in question.

 This was partly because the NSCN (I-M) does not seem to have understood fully that neither party has to agree to everything in the non-paper. Or else it would become an official paper which, then, cannot be easily disowned. Even if Thuingaleng Muivah, the general secretary of the NSCN (I-M), and its chairman, Isak Chishi Swu, understood this, they gave little indication of it in public. Overall, the NSCN (I-M) showed an unusual penchant for issuing press statements about contentious issues in the non-paper. This harmed the process as these statements seemed to modify the non-paper in public. Yet another reason for strident public statements by the NSCN (IM) was that its opponents the NSCN (Khaplang) and remnants of the Naga National Council were on their tail. Anything they agreed to was bound to be described as a sell-out by people waiting to jump onto the gravy train should Muivahs negotiations with New Delhi fail. There is suspicion that these groups are being supported by sections of the Indian establishment. For example, the Khaplang group and the NNC are not fighting the government of India. Their target is the NSCN (I-M). This helps New Delhi in trying to weaken or at least condition the NSCN (I-M) leadership by constantly questioning its legitimacy to represent all Nagas.

 New Delhis complicity with the groups trying to disrupt the peace process is indicated in more ways than one. No criminal action has been initiated against NSCN (K), which has claimed responsibility for killing several people. It has also publicly served notice on the Thangkul Nagas who predominate in the cadre of the NSCN (I-M) to vacate Nagaland. In fact, if sources in the government are to be believed, officials in Delhi wanted to take action against the newspapers which published such statements rather than proceeding against the Khaplang group.

 The NSCN (I-M) leadership has also made grave errors of judgment. They have facilitators whose experience is that of western democracies and of conflicts in the Far East. Consequently, their expectations of what is possible in the complex societies of south Asia are quite unrealistic. For example, in the last round of talks in Amsterdam, in offering clarifications about their statements on the non-paper, the NSCN (I-M) leaders ended up proposing rewriting the Indian Constitution in a new framework. Apparently, this impractical piece of advice was drafted by an Australian expert assisting them and this proposal had to be withdrawn when the Indian negotiators threatened to walk out. 

 The advice being offered by the facilitators to the two sides is peremptory and in the tone of addressing two errant children. If this is facilitation, then how would one define third party interference? A time may come when such facilitators may rule themselves out because the negotiation would not proceed anywhere with them.

 Yet, should the peace talks fail, the conflict experts from the Netherlands, Australia and Hong Kong will not be blamed. Ultimately, it is up to Muivah and Swu to accept the advice being proffered. Not only should they engage in some creative thinking themselves, they would also do well to seek advice of legal experts from India, including Naga jurists. These people, rather than those foreign to the complexities of the Indian Constitution and polity, can best provide the kind of handholding that the NSCN (I-M) needs on constitutional matters.

 Today there are only three choices before New Delhi: One, to settle with NSCN (I-M); two, to settle with the Khaplang faction and three, to settle with the two Naga factions together. The NSCN (I-M) and its advisors seem to be ruling out the first option in the pursuit of the ideal rather than the pragmatic. The Khaplang faction is very keen for a settlement. It does not want an integration of Naga areas and will always settle for less than the NSCN (I-M). Muivah should resuscitate the first option and see that an honourable settlement is reached between NSCN (I-M) and New Delhi. Or else, he should start a peace dialogue with Khaplang, settle his differences with him, and then deal with New Delhi jointly. 

 On its part, New Delhi has not been able to mobilize the supporters of the NSCN (I-M) in favour of a practical, honourable and mutually acceptable negotiated settlement. It has not held structured dialogues with Naga civil society and NGOs. It has not leveraged the media in support of peace by making the dialogue process transparent. Instead the media have been used to orchestrate undue publicity for those opposed to the peace process. There has been no attempt by the government to create public support for the peace process either in the Naga areas or in the rest of India. Consequently, New Delhi has not been able to convince anybody, not the Naga NGOs or civil society, not the media or even the people, that it is sincere about the peace process. The Naga talks today are going on only formally. Peace can never come through this kind of shadow boxing.

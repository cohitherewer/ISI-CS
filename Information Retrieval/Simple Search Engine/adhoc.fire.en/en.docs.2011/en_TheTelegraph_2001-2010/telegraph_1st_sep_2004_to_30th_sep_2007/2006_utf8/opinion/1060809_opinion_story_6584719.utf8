The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 VERY CROSS

 Art, in its engagement with religion, has always relished hell-brink blasphemy. And Madonna is one contemporary artist whose appetite for it remains insatiable. Her Italian-American Roman Catholic origins have turned out to be an asset, furnishing her with enough orthodoxies to subvert in the course of a long and resilient career. (In this, she might be compared to Sinad OConnor.) This time, Madonna has enraged both the Vatican and the American religious right. In her latest concert in Rome, held just a stones throw away from the Vatican on Sunday, she sang an entire number in a crown of fake thorns, hanging from a giant mirrored cross. A Vatican bishop has denounced the show, to which Madonna had invited the pope, as represent[ing] the rotten fruit of secularism and the absurdity of evil. Many of the bishops senior colleagues have also suggested excommunication.

 Such a position will not surprise those who have been following the career of the current head of the Vatican, Joseph Ratzinger or Pope Benedict XVI. After his half-hearted stint as a Hitler Youth, this theologically liberal Bavarian Catholic was turned a hardcore conservative by the 1968 student movement. In 1981, Pope John Paul II appointed him prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, better known in history as the Holy Inquisition. Since then, Benedict XVI has been one of the staunchest defenders of Catholic orthodoxy. His self-professed adversaries are the spirit of modern secularism and the dictatorship of relativism. This adult faith denies the effectiveness of condoms for the prevention of AIDS, threatens with excommunication Catholic stem-cell researchers and doctors who perform abortions, describes other Christian faiths and world religions as deficient or not quite real churches, disciplines the advocates of liberation theology in Latin America, opposes the ordination of women and denounces homosexuality as evil. Nicknamed Gods Rottweiler and Cardinal No by progressive Catholics, he regards rock music as a counter-cult of elemental passions and therefore opposed to Christian worship. Madonnas Roman spectacle, called Confessions, mixes it all up. During her mock-crucifixion, there was projected video footage of the pope juxtaposed with images of Mussolini, and the song was part of an appeal to the audience to donate to AIDS charities.

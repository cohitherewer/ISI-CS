 THE FUTURE IS BLACK

 JAMIE LOYD

 It is now confirmed that the All Blacks are, without any doubt,the best team in the world. Having handed out a beating of record proportions to England, the All Blacks then crossed the channel to Paris. Not only did they decimate France, but they also killed off any hope of another nation winning the Webb Ellis trophy next year.

 I had sincerely believed that the French had the measure of the Kiwis. I was convinced that they will be able to beat New Zealand on home soil. Well they couldnt and now I have to eat my words. New Zealand are the best team in the world, and to make matters worse, Graham Henry, the Kiwi coach, claims that he has not fielded his best side yet. Why have the Kiwis emerged as the dominant force in rugby? And why is it that other international teams have now fallen off the pace so horrendously? 

 England cannot quite grasp the fact that the person with the most tries wins a game. So, frankly, they havent got any hope of retaining their champion status. A lack of experience, an all or nothing attacking strategy and poor defending have cost the team dearly. So cross them off the list. Australia, winners of the World Cup, have experience and pace but are not quite refined enough to beat the Kiwis. South Africa, the only team to have beaten the All Blacks in recent times, have been too inconsistent to consider them as serious contenders for the trophy. Ireland would be the dark horse of the tournament, but it is doubtful whether they can match up to the physical strength of New Zealand. And finally France, the host nation, are a class act, but nowhere near as consistent as New Zealand.

 Top gear

 The question that needs to be asked is how have the All Blacks managed to succeed when the other teams have failed. According to Anton Oliver, the All Blacks hooker, the Kiwis followed the blueprint of Englands World Cup success to get themselves back on track. The fact is that New Zealand have taken the blueprint and turned it into a blackprint. By rotating the players in his squad, Henry has helped the new players in the side gain plenty of experience. This means that the members of the All Black squad have all played against four or five top rugby playing nations.

 Not just experience but the depth of talent available to Henry is incredible. Against France, Luke McAlister and Conrad Smith took on two of the best centres in the world and ripped them apart. Many people believed that New Zealands weakness was the outside centre, but the timely return of Smith helped in sorting this problem. 

 Henrys team now boasts of the most mobile pack in the world. Add to this Richie McCaw, one of the best flankers in the game, and Jerry Collins, arguably the most intimidating rugby player in the world, and you have a solid platform that provides good passes for their backs. The New Zealand side can also depend on the skills of Dan Carter, who is one of the best in the business, Mils Muliaina, the most elusive fullback in the world and three out of the four best wingers in the world, Joe Rokocoko, Sitiveni Sivivatu and Rico Gear. The availability of these combinations mean that the All Blacks can strike from anywhere on the pitch and they can launch such raids constantly. 

 The fact is that unless the Kiwis suffer a huge dip in form before the World Cup, the fans could be looking at record scores in the finals. If all goes well for the All Blacks, the sport would see a kind of dominance by one team, which has not happened before. What sums up the reality best is the image of Luke McAlister literally running over Ronan O Gara to score a try during an international last year. This could be a precursor to what will happen to the world of rugby in the next few years. The future is, undoubtedly, black.

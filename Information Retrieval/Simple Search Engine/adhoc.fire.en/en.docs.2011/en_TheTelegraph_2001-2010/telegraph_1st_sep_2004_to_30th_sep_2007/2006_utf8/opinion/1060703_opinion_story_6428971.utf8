 FAREWELL TO ARMS

 Arms and democracy do not go together. An end to the cult of arms is, therefore, the first prerequisite for a political settlement in Nepal. The Maoist rebels have to accept this in order to prove the genuineness of their commitment to democracy. The prime minister, Mr Girija Prasad Koirala, has accepted the Maoists? demand for the dissolution of parliament and the setting up of an interim government. The rebels too have indicated their willingness to join the interim government that will hold elections to a constituent assembly with the aim of drafting a new constitution. But Nepal?s journey along this political roadmap may be stalled if the Maoists hold on to their guns. The suggestion by the country?s home minister, Mr Krishna Prasad Sitaula, that the United Nations monitor the weapons in the possession of both the Maoists and the Nepalese army ahead of the elections is a valid one. Given the air of mistrust between the rebels and the government, a UN role seems to be the best option. 

 What road Nepal takes next has a context larger than the elections and other issues of its domestic politics. Any political settlement that does not acquire international legitimacy is bound to fail. That this will be the case has been indicated by the ambassador of the United States of America in Kathmandu, Mr James Moriarty. The position of New Delhi, which took much pains to bring the Maoists closer to the democratic parties, may not be any different. The international community cannot accept a government which has, among its constituents, a party or group whose members carry and use arms. For a country so dependent on foreign aid, it is absolutely crucial to gain international recognition for its new political set-up. In one of its first proclamations, the new government in Nepal withdrew the ?terrorist? label from the Maoists. The sooner the rebels surrender arms and submit to an international supervision of them, the better will be the chances for peace and democracy in Nepal.

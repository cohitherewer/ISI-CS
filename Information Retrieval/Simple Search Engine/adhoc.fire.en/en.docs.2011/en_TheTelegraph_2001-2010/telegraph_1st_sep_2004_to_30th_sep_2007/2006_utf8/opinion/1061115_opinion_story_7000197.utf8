The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOOKING IN

 Surveillance is a cold and untrusting word. It belongs to an entirely different universe from words like classroom, playground, or even something more abstract like learning. But there are disturbing signs of these two ideally distinct worlds of policing and of education coming together in Calcutta. Some international schools and Kendriya Vidyalayas in the city have fitted closed-circuit cameras in their classrooms for the sake of improved teaching and discipline. The purpose of these cameras is twofold: to monitor student discipline as well as standards of teaching. The assumption behind this could be called the shopping-mall mentality: the higher the technology, the better the quality of the services one is paying for. Parents are paying for their childrens education, according to this logic, and the schools must ensure their moneys worth. Besides, the world has become a nastier place. Idyllic notions of the Child in Nature growing up on freedom and trust must give way to the changing realities of the Age of Terror. 

 This mix of state-of-the-art pedagogy, cutting-age consumerism and institutionalized paranoia is both wrongheaded and obscene. It installs at the heart of education a system of vigilance that is founded on a brazenly unequal relationship of power. This system undermines the fundamental principles of humanistic education of trust, respect for an individuals dignity and privacy, and of a self-regulating sense of right and wrong. American classrooms have long had cameras fitted in them. The pioneer was Biloxi, Mississippi, where, since 2003, the same cameras used for catching thieves in Wal-Mart stores keep watch over students and teachers in classrooms, some of these bought with federal funds. The principal of one such school calls this a truth serum. The context, of course, is the rising number of school shootings in America. A few British schools now offer parents an internet-based service that allows them to log into websites and watch their children in school in real time. Admittedly, the well-being of children is a serious responsibility for schools. But school authorities must also know where to draw the line in this matter, a line that is both sensible and respectful of human dignity. It remains desirable that schools and prisons have somewhat different stakes in discipline, and therefore different means of maintaining it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FUTURE BECKONS

 Conventional wisdom quite rightly sees a bandh as a hangover from West Bengals past. Yesterdays bandh may well turn out to be a sign for the future. The important feature of Mondays bandh was not the usual deserted look of Calcutta. What was of profound significance for West Bengals future was the fact that the IT sector remained untouched by the bandh and thus did not lose a day. This cocooning of the IT sector is the direct result of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees determination to demonstrate to all investors that West Bengal under his leadership has not turned, and will not turn, its back on capital, investment and work. Mr Bhattacharjee served a public notice that he will not allow the culture of bandh to disrupt his project to build a new and industrialized West Bengal. It would be nave to assume that the notice was directed at the Trinamool Congress, which had spearheaded Mondays bandh. On the contrary, Mr Bhattacharjees target audience was the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, one of the front organizations of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) which has already given a bandh call for December 14 to protest against the alleged anti-labour policy of the Centre.

 The Citu, it will be recalled, has been trying valiantly to bring workers in the IT sector under its ambit and to force them to participate in bandhs. By keeping this sector free of the pernicious bandh culture during a strike called by the Trinamool Congress, Mr Bhattacharjee has announced implicitly but firmly that a bandh called by the Citu will also have no impact on that particular sector. The Citu, unless it wants to precipitate a face-off with the chief minister, should heed the warning and draw a line before sector V in Salt Lake. The IT sector is thus a beacon of the future in more ways than one. It leads West Bengals drive towards modernity and it stands forth as the barrier against bandhs. Mr Bhattacharjee is aware that West Bengals progress is impeded not by his political rivals but by weeds in his own garden.

 FOR THE SAKE OF JUSTICE

 India should ratify the international convention on enforced disappearances if it is adopted by the UN, writes Warisha Farasat

 Towards collective action

 Blank faces stare at us. White scarves inscribed with faceless silhouettes and names are tied around the foreheads of the family members of the disappeared. The day is August 30, the International Day of the Disappeared, and the occasion is a non-violent protest organized by a victims group (Association for Parents of Disappeared Persons) in Srinagar. The barbed wire entrance to the local park is flanked by security personnel. It is almost noon, but the majestic chinar tress shield the sun. These trees have stood testimony to many incidents and moments, both political and religious.

 The muffled cries of a woman, whose son disappeared almost ten years ago, are heard. Immediately, cameras, which do not want to lose the image, surround her. The cries become louder. They merge with the noise of the traffic traversing the main road outside the park. The circle gradually grows in size; the total number of persons is around fifty. The people at the gathering, from different villages and towns, are drawn from varying age groups. A cluster of men, sitting at a distance, appear disinterested in the protest. A few stragglers curiously look into the park. Posters are distributed. They read: Stop Disappearances, Stop Crimes against Humanity. Even though some do not grasp the exact meaning of what they are holding, they are aware of the deep injustice they have suffered.

 On June 29, 2006, the newly formed United Nations Human Rights Council approved the International Convention on Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. In September, the UN general assembly will deliberate on its adoption. With the present international convention, the setting of norms for the crime of disappearances has come a long way since the establishment of the UN working group on enforced and involuntary disappearances in 1980. Article 2 of the convention defines enforced disappearance as the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty committed by agents of the state or by persons or groups or groups of persons acting with authorization, support or acquiescence of the state. This could be followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which places such a person outside the protection of law.

 Article 6 further provides that state parties shall take necessary measures to hold criminally responsible any person who commits, orders, solicits or induces the commission of enforced disappearance. Additionally, a superior officer who knew and failed to stop subordinates under his effective authority and control from committing an enforced disappearance is criminally liable. If implemented, it obliges state parties to prosecute perpetrators within their jurisdiction unless they are extradited to an international tribunal.

 During the negotiation of the treaty, the official response from the Indian government was tepid. If adopted by the general assembly, India should ratify this important convention. Given the unwillingness of the Indian state to provide justice to families of the disappeared in Punjab, human rights groups must lobby hard with the Indian government. This will ensure greater accountability for abuses committed by security and police forces, especially in the conflict areas of the North-east and Jammu and Kashmir.

 Disappearances which constitute a crime against humanity came to international attention during the Seventies. Military dictatorships in Latin American countries like Chile and Argentina employed torture, imprisonment, murder and disappearances to combat political opposition.

 After years of struggle by victim groups such as the Mothers of the Disappeared in Argentina, President Raul Alfonsin formed a national commission for the disappeared to investigate and establish the truth. Similar commissions were created around the world, including the presidential commission to investigate disappearances in Sri Lanka in 1994.

 The demands of an inquiry commission investigating the alleged disappearances in Jammu and Kashmir have been continually ignored by the Indian government. The official account is that these persons have crossed over the Line of Control and gone into Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, family narratives of victims replete with names of perpetrators, first information report numbers, descriptions of harassment at army camps and police stations seem convincing. The mother of Shafqat Ahmad Rashi from Srinagar relates the incident in 1995, when her son was allegedly picked up by the security forces. Eleven years ago, he left for a wedding feast to Baramullah, after which his whereabouts are unknown. On receiving information about his imprisonment at Kotbilwal jail in Jammu, she travelled there, spending her limited resources, only to return disappointed.

 Refusing the ex gratia relief of one lakh rupees, provided by the state, was an easy decision. For this old woman, justice implies disclosure of details by the authorities of what happened to her son. Victim families have often returned or refused state compensation, claiming the right to know the whereabouts of their family members.

 The wife of Manzoor Ahmad Baba from Bandipore has been waiting for her husband to return. She says, Sometimes I wish that when I close my eyes and open them, he will be standing at the door. Conscious that this whim will not come true unless families of victims collectively demand justice, she sits patiently at the protest meet, thinking of her five children. Everyone in the circle has a story to tell, a painful experience to recount and an uncertain wait for a loved ones return. The official figures of the disappeared released by the Jammu and Kashmir state government stands at 3,931. The unofficial count by the victims group is higher, with estimates of around 8,000.

 Contestation over figures is futile and the truth of these cases must be recognized. While India has been trumpeting its efforts towards achieving peace in the region, it must realize that justice and truth are no longer tradeable commodities.

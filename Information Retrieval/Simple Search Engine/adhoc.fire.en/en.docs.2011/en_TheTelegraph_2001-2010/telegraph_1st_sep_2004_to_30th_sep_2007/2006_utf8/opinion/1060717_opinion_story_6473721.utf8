The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BROKEN CITY

 Uddalak Mukherjee

 As I started my run to catch the Andheri-bound local at Churchgate, I knew that I had got my timing horribly wrong. Somehow, the train kept gathering pace, and the carriage doorway, though tantalizingly close, remained just out of reach. There was still time for one desperate lunge, and suddenly, out of nowhere, a rush of hands from inside the carriage, and a brief air-borne moment later, I landed safely inside. Even as I thanked my benefactors, they turned away with a shrug, as if they made a living out of pulling woefully slow strangers into speeding trains. The man next to me was less reticent. ?Kadji karu naka, ashi ahe Mumbaichi atmashakti (Don?t worry, this is the spirit of Mumbai)?, he said with a smile.

 It was this ?enduring spirit?, which became the focus of attention, as Mumbai battled yet another terror strike ? the fifth since 1993. People rushed the injured and the dead to hospitals, gave food and water to stranded passengers and even dropped some of them home. The media gushed about how you can never ?break Mumbai?s back?. The governments (both at the state and the Centre) went into overdrive, saluting Mumbai?s ?undying spirit?.

 But this praise is about all that they could manage. The security continues to be lax, making Mumbai a soft target. That nothing was done to upgrade the security of one of the most vulnerable points of the city ? the suburban railways ? pointed at something worse: the lack of political will to confront the continuing threat. Not a single person has been convicted for the serial blasts in 1993. And despite ominous signs that Mumbai could be targeted once again ? a raid in Aurangabad resulted in the seizure of 43 kgs of RDX, while the arrest of four militants in Mumbai in January had revealed that there were plans to rebuild terror modules in the city ? the government and the intelligence agencies sat and dozed. 

 Alone and afraid

 Worse, after the blasts, the administrative machinery ground to a halt. Cellular services were jammed (again, after the deluge last year), the transport system broke down and, in some cases, security officials were slow to respond to the emergency. A man was reportedly told to go to the anti-terror unit by the Matunga police when he went to tell them about three individuals carrying suspicious looking boxes in Churchgate on the evening of the blasts. 

 In other places, commuters, pedestrians and vendors were the first to start the rescue work; the police arrived much later. One rescue worker recounted how the police had chased him away while he was trying to get an injured man to hospital. So much for Mumbai?s much-vaunted disaster management system. It cannot stop the city from flooding every monsoon. It is equally helpless in times of terror.

 As if on cue, the Centre put on an equally spineless show. The prime minister dragged his feet to the city two days after the incident, and gently reminded a neighbour that abetting terrorism would endanger peace talks. But he could not quite explain how calling off peace talks would help in thwarting future strikes.

 However weird, it seems the prime minister needs to be told that a government which has failed to secure the life of its citizens cannot make any claims on the people. It does not even have the right to praise their courage. Especially so, because it is government apathy that drives them to perform heroics everywhere ? in Kashmir, in the North-east or in Mumbai. It is a pity that Mumbai has to show it can ?bounce back? after paying such a heavy price every time.

 The prime minister declared that ?no one can make India kneel?. He is both right and wrong. Indians have not cowered before terror despite the bloody decade they have endured. But it would be very difficult for them to remain on their feet after being abandoned, time and again, by those who are supposed to protect them in the first place.

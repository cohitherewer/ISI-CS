 TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE

 GYAN PATHAK

 With the spiralling prices of essential commodities and the rising discontent among the public, the United Progressive Alliance government is resorting to expediency to mollify the peoples resentment. The government even tried to play down the price rise through its consumer affairs secretary, L. Mansingh, who brazenly claimed that the prices of essential commodities had stabilized. He also refuted the charges that hoarding or future trading was the cause of a steep rise in prices. The major reason for the price hike, according to Mansingh, was the gap between demand and supply. The Centre has been reiterating that it is sensitive to the price situation and is committed to contain it. Yet no follow-up action has been taken thus far.

 The real intention of the government is to put in place a reform-oriented regime. One example of this was the decision of the ministry of food and civil supplies, consumer affairs and public distribution to restore power to state governments for undertaking dehoarding operations under the Essential Commodities Act 1955 with respect to wheat and pulses. This decision followed the scuttling of the Essential Commodities (Amendment) bill 2005 by the Union minister of agriculture, Sharad Pawar, who informed the Lok Sabha that the bill passed last month by the Rajya Sabha could not be taken up in the house as he wanted further amendments in the same to strengthen the legislation against hoarding.

 It is clear that this decision falls short of the mark. There is no law to support it. The government has rescinded all control orders by 2004, despite the recommendations of the parliamentary standing committee to fine-tune the Act. The UPA followed the National Democratic Alliance governments policies until voices of discontent came to the fore. That is when it tried to hoodwink the people by coming up with the amendment bill. 

 Full of loopholes

 The amendment bill is being systematically scuttled on one pretext or the other. The government is contradicting itself by empowering states to look into dehoarding and price control on the one hand, and insisting that future trading did not impact the price rise on the other. Yet, the proposed empowerment will have no impact on the prices in the absence of a control order. Besides it covers only wheat and pulses and that too for a period of only six months. By the time rabi crops would enter the market, the six-month deadline will be over and private traders and multinationals will be free to purchase any quantity of the crops. Another loophole is that the government has not proposed any restrictions on the movement of stocks in other states. So a state cannot effectively exercise its power without an all-India control.

 It is worth mentioning here that the government had given a free hand to private traders and multinationals after the introduction of the bill in the parliament. In the first quarter of this year, farmers were being given a minimum support price of Rs 650 per quintal for wheat. Private players like Reliance, ITC and Cargill started purchasing wheat at slightly higher prices. 

 As a result, the government purchase dropped to a new low and by the time the Centre realized this, it was too late. Private traders and multinationals had already purchased 60 lakh tonnes of wheat. The government then announced an additional bonus of Rs 50 per quintal. Despite that, government agencies could purchase only 92 lakh tonnes which was 40 per cent lower than what is required to operate the public distribution system. 

 At present wheat is selling at a high price but the government claims that the prices have now stabilized. Is this not a dishonest measure? The market forces and our ruling class have formed a vicious circle that needs to be broken.

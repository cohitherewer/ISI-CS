 PROVEN GUILT

 For exactly two months now, judicial convictions have made pleasant news in this country. The enthusiasm with which the Delhi high court verdict against Manu Sharma in the Jessica Lal murder case has been greeted is not much different from that which was evoked by the courts judgment in the Priyadarshini Mattoo case. This is partly because of the striking similarity in the trajectory of the two cases. They involved a similar play of money and muscle on the part of the offenders and a similar display of corruption among the investigative authorities. But the most important link in public memory will be the judiciarys own role. In both cases, the higher court slammed the verdict arrived at by the lower court as perverse. And, in both, the same body of evidence available to the judiciary was used to arrive at such judgment. The cases have raised serious questions about the reliability of judgments in the lower courts. Since the Indian judicial system allows verdicts to be challenged at the highest level, that is in the Supreme Court, the high courts themselves, ultimately, are also not immune to reviews.

 There is another reason for the enthusiasm. The convictions that followed a retrial in both the cases are seen as a vindication of the role the public can play in bringing the guilty to book. Nation-wide media campaigns and candlelight vigils immediately preceded the trials in the high court. They all speak of a public awareness and interest that have been rare so far. The groundswell, however, should not blot out the reality. Both Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo were high profile cases. For each successful case, there will continue to remain thousands of other inconclusive ones which will neither draw such public interest nor reach the portals of the higher courts.

 BRUTE FORCE

 Even a minor incident involving violence in Gujarat rings alarm bells. This is related to the track record of Mr Narendra Modi?s government in quelling violence through effective administrative action. The violence that is being witnessed in Vadodara is by no means minor, and the fact that it persisted unabated for over two days by no means alters the adverse impression that exists about Mr Modi and his administration. Mr Modi has never been particularly sensitive about Muslim feelings and sentiments. His callousness is indicated by the man who has been appointed as director-general of the state police. This officer failed in his duty to provide protection to the Muslims during the pogrom in 2002. It is no point denying that Muslims in Gujarat have innumerable and solid reasons to distrust Mr Modi. The latter and the state administration should thus be extra careful in handling issues that have a direct bearing on Muslim feelings. The violence in Vadodara should be seen in this context of indifference and suspicion.

 The priorities of development demanded that a 300-year-old dargah be pulled down. Without even questioning the priorities, it does not need a great deal of imagination or intelligence to foresee that the demolition would hurt Muslim sentiments and rouse passion. The matter needed careful handling: meeting with the leaders of the Muslim community in the area, offers of relocation and a lot of gentle persuasion. It was not a matter that could be resolved by sticking a demolition notice on the walls of the dargah. There are also allegations that the administration went back on a compromise formula according to which only a part of the shrine was to be demolished. The entire building has been pulled down. The violence in Vadodara does the Gujarat government no credit. In fact, it shows it up to be indifferent and incompetent. Mr Modi will have a lot to answer for when he faces the electorate the next time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A glorious past and present THE GREAT GLORY: SIKHISM (Rupa, 

Rs 1,950) does not quite believe that pictures can speak for themselves. Malkiat 

Singhs poignant shots of Sikh life and religion are thus accompanied by some 

very jarring captions that try to unnecessarily sentimentalize the faith and the 

figure of the faithful. An effort to understand the worlds youngest religion 

could not have been possible without a discussion of its history, tenets, traditions 

and practices. Sandeep Goswamis text tries to live up to that need, but perhaps 

a bit too earnestly. Most of the pictures here are of Sikhs in association with 

their faith the kar sewa at the Golden Temple or the Hemkunt Sahib (picture). 

But there are also vignettes of Sikh life, old and young. These two young girls 

have been shot in a gurdwara in Pakistan. In fact, there are shots of everything 

Sikh except the bhangra.

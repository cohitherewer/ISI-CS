 Rediscovering the Mahatma

 Sir Mahatma Gandhi is once again taking the centre-stage in popular culture, thanks to movie directors. After Richard Attenborough and Shyam Benegal, it is now the turn of Rajkumar Hirani to bring back the man in Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Getting under Gandhis skin is a challenge that film-makers seem to love. Gandhi had a dramatic and complex personal life, as well as a tumultuous political career. It is no surprise then that he makes for interesting films and theatre. What is surprising though is the fact that very few people care to follow his path in real life.

 Yours faithfully,

 S. Das, Calcutta

 Forever young

 Sir In the business of politics, there is no need for an entrance test or basic qualifications, and there is no age for retirement either (Waiting to grow old, Sep 24). Therefore, ideally, politics should be open to all and sundry. However, despite the trappings of power, in India, most young people were cynical about pursuing a career in politics. In the West, a student might consider himself extremely fortunate to land an internship with a political party. However, in our country, politics has been seen as the exclusive domain of a few families so far. India has also had its share of professionals-turned-politicians legal experts like Arun Jaitley and Kapil Sibal, film stars such as Govinda and Vinod Khanna, bureaucrats, police officers, criminals and so on. However, things are definitely changing in Indian politics. Young Turks like Rahul Gandhi, Milind Deora, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot and Navin Jindal emerged winners in the last parliamentary polls. It is refreshing to note that the country now expects young leaders to take up the reins. Given that 70 per cent of Indias population is now under 35, the need for young politicians is being felt rather strongly. However, being young does not guarantee success. A young person has to be groomed properly if he were to win an election. There are now institutions which provide young men and women with such training. For instance, the Rambhau Mhalgi Prabodhini institute in Thane has devised leadership programmes for aspiring student leaders and women activists.Such institutions play a crucial role because the party system cannot respond to changing times in the absence of student activism. So far, Indian politics has largely hinged on dynastic equations. However, there is still a chance for the youth of the country to make a difference.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir An individuals performance should be the sole criterion for election to an office. Therefore, one should not complain if it is still party-time for Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani and Jyoti Basu. There should be no retirement age in literature and arts either. The concept of retirement in old age would then deprive us of Khushwant Singhs sharp pen and M.F. Hussains brilliance with the brush.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Mohun Bagans successive victories against arch rivals, East Bengal, in the Calcutta league proves that the team is on the right track. Even if Mohun Bagan doesnt win the title, the supporters and officials need not fret. Biswajit Bhattacharjees team will surely deliver the goods in the National league. The return of Jose Barretto will surely add to the worries of rival coaches. Biswajit Bhattacharjee should also continue as the coach, even as Bhaichung and his team mates prepare to give their best against their fancied opponents. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Soumya Mukherjee, Naihati

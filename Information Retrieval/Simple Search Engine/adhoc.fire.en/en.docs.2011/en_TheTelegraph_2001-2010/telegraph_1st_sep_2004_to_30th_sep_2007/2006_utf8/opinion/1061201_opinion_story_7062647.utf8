 PLEASE, NOT AGAIN

 The Holocaust of Indian Partition: An Inquest 

 By Madhav Godbole 

 Rupa, Price not mentioned

 It is strange that even decades after the Partition, the event still generates interest in the reading public. Or, perhaps, some people try to keep the interest alive for reasons of their own. Madhav Godbole might be counted as one belonging to this group. He has taken upon himself the responsibility of examining the reasons behind the massacre that took place before and after the Partition of India. Godbole has made use of a sizeable amount of source material in writing the book. Yet, his intentions in producing the work remain unclear. 

 What made Godbole take up the much-discussed subject of the Partition after years, when time has healed the wounds it inflicted? His endeavour seems all the more redundant as volumes have already been written on the topic. Given the proliferation of works on the Partition, only a truly exceptional account could have held the readers attention. But Godboles work has nothing that can induce readers to take it up. 

 The book is divided into six parts from the Prelude to the Partition in retrospect and in between there is a chapter about some of the central figures who played a key role in the tragedy. Godbole fails to make a proper critical assesssment of these historical figures. The quality of Godboles account is severely compromised by its lack of objectivity, on the one had, and by his inability to go beyond the statistics, on the other. Sometimes he quotes from books without acknowledging the source and even adds comments of his own. The work is neither a narration of historical events nor can it be rightfully termed an inquest, since that would have demanded much more than the mere marshalling of facts. 

 But what is truly shocking is Godboles view that the Partition was in the interest of the country. Unpartitioned India would have presented a frightening picture of a country torn asunder by internal dissensions, political instability and social and communal tensions, he writes. Godbole contradicts this in the next line by saying that communal parties could not hold sway in present-day India: It is important to note in this context that even with a fractious polity as it obtains in India, only two rightist Hindu political parties Bharatiya Janata Party and Shiv Sena have emerged in India so far. If that is so, then what makes him think that unpartitioned India would have been ungovernable, unlivable?

 Godbole shows little understanding of even the well-known theories about the Partition. His failure is unfortunate, since, with the amount of material at hand, he could easily have produced a successful work if he only had his perspectives about the Partition right.

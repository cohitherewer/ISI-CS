The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MAKE A FRESH START

 Malvika Singh

 The prime minister has earned some more brownie points, as revealed in the recent poll conducted across the country. People seem satisfied with him and, therefore, with the United Progressive Alliance government. The media, once again, have not been able to reflect much of this positive response because they seem to be obsessed with the happenings in some select pockets of urban India, ignoring the impact of policy on the country at large. Just as India Shining became the peg for celebratory stories that hid the reality on the ground, the lack of information from across this land may well throw up another political surprise. Here is another opportunity for the Congress to shun the traditional squabbling and back-biting to take charge of Uttar Pradesh, which will lead it towards a more consolidated victory in the national elections. The time is right to wield a whip and compel Congressmen and women to get out there in the field and deliver the goods. This is the moment to make them all accountable. 

 The Bharatiya Janata Party is making inroads, quietly, in eastern Uttar Pradesh, something that should activate the Congress in that area. With a large number of independents having won seats, the signal is that the electorate is sick and tired of predictable politics and politicians. They have had enough and want change. Also, the majority of voters belong to a new generation and want to bury the horrors of the exploitative past. Who is going to grab the bull by its horns, take the risk of breaking out of the box to follow a fresh trend? All parties need to energize their body politic, be proactive and inclusive, to make India a vibrant democracy. 

 Disgraceful conduct

 When compared to the United States of America, our electorate, despite being illiterate, is astute, politically and culturally. The voters connect with the community, they have strong views and, therefore, sooner or later, they will force the change. Invasions over centuries have brought varied ideas and cultures to our shores, have forced integration and have made us a tolerant and sensitive society. The average American voter, outside of a handful of cities, is disconnected with the world and is concerned only with his immediate environment. Most have not ventured out of their states and only 10 per cent hold passports, if that can be a symbol of a society that looks inwards! It is scary to know that international policy is determined by men and women elected to do so by those who are isolated from the reality. 

 We will soon be in election mode. Energy levels will be high, the adrenalin will flow, debates will ensue and live entertainment will happen. Let us hope that there has been a shifting of gears and that India will make many new demands and compel action. 

 This weeks horror has been the Ram Jethmalani intervention in the Jessica Lal murder case, not so much in his role as a lawyer fighting for his client, but as a man of dignity. The manner in which he has cast aspersions on a woman is unacceptable. As a father of girl children, as a father-in-law, as a husband, as a friend, it is appalling that he has managed to get away with this kind of gutter speak. If these are the standards of argument that senior, respected lawyers are setting for our country, small wonder we are in such a mess, socially. Frankly, Jethmalanis statement is an assault on all women, a virtual rape and he should be put through the rigours of a public interest litigation for having insulted fifty per cent of India, if not more. 

 We make a huge issue about elected representatives holding offices of profit, being chairpersons of family trusts and educational, cultural institutions, but we merrily allow uncouth statements to be made about women by a Rajya Sabha member. The only saving grace is that India is beginning to reject the filth.

 ODE TO FEAR

 There is some irony in celebrating Independence Day with the capital of the country under virtual siege. New Delhi for the last few days has been gripped by fear and has been brought under a high security cover. Thus on a day of freedom residents of the capital will find themselves under all sorts of restrictions and will have to endure some harassment. Some solace can be drawn from the clich about eternal vigilance being the price of freedom. But these overarching security concerns inevitably raise questions about the state of the nation. When the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, speaks to the people of the country this morning, he will be acutely conscious of the fact that without a security cordon, the celebration of Independence Day may not have been possible. What aggravates the concern is that over the years the threat perception has multiplied. This year, events in the United Kingdom have heightened the fear and the level of security but every year, over the last few years, the shadow of a terrorist attack on Independence Day has fallen on the celebrations. This shadow is the direct consequence of the cloud of religious fundamentalism which stands in the way of reason and enlightened discourse in public life. The voice of Mr Singh this morning will be the voice of reason and sanity but in the gathering gloom it might appear like a cry in the wilderness.

 Apart from the obvious threat of terrorism, there exist features which are corroding the functioning of democracy and democratic institutions. Take the example of what is happening in the hallowed halls of parliament. There has already taken place a most unseemly stand-off between members of the National Democratic Alliance, the principal opposition force, and the speaker of the Lok Sabha. This was a controversy which had no winners or losers but served only to lower the dignity of the house. A functioning democracy is based on respect for certain conventions. In Indian public life, conventions are being flouted without any consideration of the grave implications of such transgressions. The fragility of Indian democracy has never been as apparent, since the Emergency, as it is at the moment. Mr Singhs personal example and his good intentions may not be strong enough to immunize the system against the spreading cancer. A booming economy and a floundering state appear to be the wages of 59 years of freedom.

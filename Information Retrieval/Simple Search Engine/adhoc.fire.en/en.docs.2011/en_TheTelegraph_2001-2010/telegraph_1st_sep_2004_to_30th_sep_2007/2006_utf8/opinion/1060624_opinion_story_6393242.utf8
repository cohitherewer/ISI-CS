 COPS AND ROBBERS

 Can Calcutta police commissioner Prasun 

 Mukherjee straddle the world of cricket too?

 A new broom sweeps clean. An old cop, some believe, does it even better. Take away his baton and give him a broom ? and before you know it, your Augean Stables will be squeaky clean. 

 Calcuttas police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, seems to think so. Not content with coping with the menace of crime, he wants to clean up the murky world of Indian cricket. 

 Cynics would say that there is not much of a difference between the worlds of sports and crime. Both have their share of honourable people who follow the rule book and both have to deal with criminals wreaking havoc on an orderly life. And, for this, both need a stern boss. 

 Enter the cop. The 56-year-old officer is going to contest against cricket czar Jagmohan Dalmiya for the post of the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) in mid-July. Rumour has it that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted him to fight for the post ? but Mukherjee, understandably, is tight-lipped on the issue. I am contesting for this post since I think that there is a need for change at the CAB for the betterment of cricket in Bengal, is all that he is willing to say. 

 For sports enthusiast Mukherjee, the job would be like any other. His supporters, in fact, are quite convinced that he can revive the sports body. He has always had a keen interest in sports and has been instrumental in assisting several players across the spectrum, says old friend, former cricketer and selector Sambaran Banerjee. He would usher a new era for the CAB if elected. 

 Jagmohan Dalmiya wasnt quite a sportsman either ? but Mukherjees decision to contest has kicked up a debate on his links, or lack of links, with sports. Banerjee maintains that he played cricket in school, and has close ties with sportsmen. His supporters point out that he likes to encourage people with a flair for sports in his department. Recently, he sponsored a couple of athletes for training from the police department. 

 Quite a few people seem to think that Mukherjee is just right for the job. Apart from the chief minister, mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly are said to be supporting him. In fact, the government is so keen to bring in Mukherjee that the chief minister even urged Dalmiya to relinquish his post. Dalmiyas reaction to his opponents rising popularity is uncharacteristically terse. The collective views of the Cricket Association of Bengal regarding the chief ministers request will be presented at a meeting within the next fortnight, he says. 

 Dalmiya, it cannot be denied, gave Indian cricket a new profile. What Mukherjee does to the state board will be worth watching. Many, of course, hold that Mukherjee will do a good job because he is a competent officer. They cite a 2005 survey which said Calcutta was better off than other cities when it came to law and order. 

 Some believe that traffic conditions have improved since he took over as commissioner in December, 2004. His move to instal CCTV to monitor police stations from Lalbazar has also been hailed. Our aim is to change the Calcutta Police from being a mere law-enforcing authority to a force committed to the people ? more friendly and approachable, says Mukherjee. 

 But some others, such as football coach Amal Dutta, are not convinced that Mukherjee is the answer to the citys cricketing woes. Can you tell me what a policeman has to do with cricket, asks an agitated Dutta, a coach for 20 years. Dutta mocks Mukherjees promise to bring Sourav back to the Indian team. A player, he underlines, has to be chosen on the basis of merit ? and not on the canvassing of a police commissioner backed by a chief minister. Today we are seeing the chief minister interfering in cricket administration. Tomorrow he will try to do the same for football and then for other sports. The signs are ominous, Dutta says. 

 Mukherjees supporters are not worried, for they hold that he has always managed to straddle different worlds without much of a problem. Mukherjee, for instance, is a lifelong Mohun Bagan supporter ? unlike his wife, Sutapa, who roots for East Bengal. 

 The officer, clearly, has a finger in every pie. Born in Patna, he is also an environment lover. Family members recall that he often brought stray puppies home and sat enraptured by the sound of bird song. Not surprisingly, he is the president of the Nature Environment and Wildlife Society in Calcutta. 

 Belonging to a family of civil servants, Mukherjee ? the youngest of nine siblings ? graduated in mathematics from Patna College, following which he joined the Indian Police Service as an assistant superintendent in 1973. Sutapa ? his wife of 21 years ? believes that he was first noticed for rescuing flood victims in 1978. With bodies floating in the water and an awful stench pervading the whole area, I was witness to his extraordinary sensitivity. He understood the helplessness of man in the face of natures wrath and I found him weeping on several occasions, unable even to eat, she recalls. 

 A few are worried whether a busy police commissioner will be able to devote adequate time to the CAB. Although Prasun Mukherjee is a sports enthusiast, it is going to be a tough job for him to carry on his duties here considering that CAB members commit five-six hours every day without pay, says Saradindu Pal, secretary of the CAB. 

 Former chief minister Jyoti Basu has expressed reservations about Mukherjees ability to tackle two important posts simultaneously. Chuni Goswami, an Olympian with a long association with the CAB and a personal friend of 20 years, is concerned, too. He is competent and intelligent but I doubt he will be able to do justice to the CAB in view of his role as a police commissioner, says Goswami. 

 But no job, says the Mukherjee camp, is too tough for the man. Sutapa recalls he once told her that, as a child, he wanted to be President of India. Sometime soon, he may just realise half of his dream. If all goes well, hell be president. Maybe not of India yet ? but of a body that, in some circles at least, is not any less important.

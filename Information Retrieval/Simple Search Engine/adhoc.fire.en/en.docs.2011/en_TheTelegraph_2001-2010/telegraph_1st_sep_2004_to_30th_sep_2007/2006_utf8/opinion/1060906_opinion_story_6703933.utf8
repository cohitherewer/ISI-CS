 DESIGNS FOR THE FUTURE

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 Thorium is three times as abundant in the earths crust as uranium. Although existing estimates of thorium reserves plus additional resources total more than 4.5 Mt, such estimates are considered still conservative. They do not cover all regions of the world, and the historically weak market demand has limited thorium exploration...

 Uranium production in 2004 totalled 40 263 tU, only about 60 per cent of the worlds reactor requirements (67 320 tU). The remainder was covered by five secondary sources: stockpiles of natural uranium, stockpiles of enriched uranium, reprocessed uranium from spent fuel, MOX fuel with 235U partially replaced by 239Pu from reprocessed spent fuel and re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails...

 Of these five secondary sources, the largest contributions come from stockpiles built up from the beginning of commercial exploitation of nuclear power in the late-1950s through to about 1990. Throughout this period uranium production consistently exceeded commercial requirements due mainly to slower than expected growth in nuclear electricity generation plus high production for military purposes. Since 1990 the situation has been reversed, and stockpiles have been drawn down. However, precise information is not readily available, and possible future political decisions on releasing military material for commercial purposes add an additional element of uncertainty. 

 Recycling of spent fuel as MOX fuel has not significantly altered uranium requirements, given the relatively small number of reactors using MOX and the limited number of recycles possible using current reprocessing and reactor technology. Uranium recovered through reprocessing of spent fuel, known as reprocessed uranium, is currently recycled only in France and the Russian Federation...

 Depleted uranium stocks are substantial, estimated at about 1.5 MtU at the beginning of 2005. Re-enrichment, however, is currently only economical in centrifuge enrichment plants that have spare capacity and low operating costs...

 Uranium prices generally declined from the early-1980s until 1994 due to over-production and the availability of secondary sources, and between 1990 and 1994 low prices led to significant reductions in many sectors of the world uranium industry. Beginning in 2001, however, the price of uranium has rebounded to levels not seen since the 1980s, with the spot price increasing more than six-fold from 2001 to 2006. 

 In the near term most new nuclear plants will likely be evolutionary improvements on existing designs. In the longer term, more innovative designs that incorporate radical changes and promise significantly shorter construction times and lower capital costs could help to promote a new era of nuclear power...

 Advanced designs seek improvements in three principal areas: cost reductions, safety enhancements, and proliferation resistance. For cost reductions, some designs emphasize further developing proven strategies, i.e. economies of scale through larger units; shorter construction schedules through modular systems and addressing licensing issues early; standardization and construction in series; multiple unit construction; and enhancing local participation, while other designs emphasize new cost reduction strategies including economies of series production; sharpening the accuracy of codes and databases to eliminate overdesign; developing smart components to detect incipient failures and reduce dependence on costly redundancy and diversity; passive safety systems; further development of probabilistic safety analysis to support plant simplification and risk-informed regulatory decision making; fewer components requiring nuclear grade standards; and higher ther- mal efficiencies.

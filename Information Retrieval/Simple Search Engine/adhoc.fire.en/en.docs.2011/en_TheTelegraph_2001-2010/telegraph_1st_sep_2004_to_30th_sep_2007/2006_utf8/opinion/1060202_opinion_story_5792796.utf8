The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 VIENNESE WOODS

 Comrades love conspiracy theories. Spokesmen of the Indian left, over the last few months, have been vociferous in their criticism of the government of India?s decision to vote against Iran in the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. This decision was the proof, according to the comrades, of Mr Manmohan Singh?s complete sell-out to the United States of America. The left is convinced that India is sacrificing its friendship with Iran to curry favour with Washington, and that the priorities of India?s foreign policy is changing under pressure from the US. Unfortunately, what the left in India proposes, world opinion disposes. Both Russia and China announced on Tuesday that they would vote with the US and other Western powers against Iran. Following the thinking of the left, it would follow that both Russia and China have at best been influenced by Washington, or at worst have succumbed to US pressure. Such an argument is ridiculous, and if the left did articulate its position thus, it would make itself look more absurd than it does at the moment. The decision of Russia and China to vote with the US against Iran only vindicates India?s position, and should make the comrades, if they are honest, distinctly uncomfortable.

 The left?s position on Iran and on foreign policy in general is intellectually grounded in Cold War realities. It believes that foreign policy should be driven by ideology, and for the left, ideology, after the collapse of communism, means a visceral anti-Americanism. It is nobody?s case that US policies stand for the good and are wrapped in a sacred halo. But support, and opposition, to them must be determined by national interests and a sense of global priorities. Poised as India is now to sit at the international high table, it can ill afford to alienate the US over Iran. India?s alleged friendship with Iran is an item of the past. At the present juncture, Iran?s nuclear programme is a threat to world peace. This perception has been compounded by the irresponsible utterances of Iran?s president, Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Even those who are sympathetic to Iran?s fears, surrounded as it is by US military presence, agree that his pronouncements have only hardened suspicions and made dialogue impossible. A strong vote in Vienna will serve to mount the pressure of international opinion on Tehran. The left should stop looking for Uncle Sam under the bed.

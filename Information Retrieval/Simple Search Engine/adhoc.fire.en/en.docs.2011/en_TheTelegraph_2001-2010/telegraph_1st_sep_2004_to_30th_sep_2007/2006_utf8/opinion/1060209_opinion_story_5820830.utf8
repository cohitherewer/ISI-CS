 RICH MAN?S GAME

 Mr Lakshmi Mittal is a rich man. And he likes not just to count his mohurs but to flaunt them too. He rented a chateau for the wedding of his daughter; more recently, he bought a 12-bedroom residence in Kensington Palace Gardens, arguably the world?s most exclusive street. Having become the world?s biggest steel producer in 2004, he has now made a hostile bid for Arcelor, the largest steel company next only to his own, after Mr Guy Doll?, its chief executive, rebuffed his friendly overture. Those who have watched his style will wonder if this is another spectacle. Those who look for his economic logic will wonder how he can add value to Arcelor, which is a well run company. The takeover would be good for him; it would turn Mittal Steel, now a family business, into a widely held European company. But what would it do to Arcelor? This consideration is foremost in the minds of those members of European governments who are concerned about his bid. Whilst their opposition has been portrayed as parochial and small-minded, it is no secret that one way of adding value to acquisitions is by downsizing the labour force. Even before bidding for Arcelor, Mr Mittal had planned to relieve a quarter of his workers worldwide by 2010. The trade unions of Arcelor in France, Spain and Luxembourg have vehemently opposed Mr Mittal?s bid; their concern about employment would be shared by their governments. 

 The other concern, especially amongst shareholders, will be the debt Mr Mittal would incur to buy Arcelor. The present count is that he will borrow $14 billion to bid $22 billion; if the price goes up, so will the debt. Shareholders will ask what they will get after the creditors are looked after. Their gain would, of course, be immediate if they accepted Mr Mittal?s offer now, which is 27 per cent above the pre-bid share quote. It is possible that financial institutions will cash out and give Mr Mittal the necessary shares to take control. But to date, Mr Mittal has only succeeded in raising hackles. He must also have some supporters, but he has to acquire some more, in the right quarters, and fast. He has been busy calling on the people in power in Paris and Brussels. But besides this lobbying, he will have to build up a stronger case for the merger. His acquisitions hitherto have been in eastern Europe, central Asia, China, south-east Asia and the United States of America; Arcelor would fill a gap in Europe and fit well into his global empire. There will no doubt be economies in administration and marketing. He must prove that what is good for Mr Mittal is good for Europe. Although Mr Mittal left India long ago, Indians love success even of distant Indians, and will watch with fascination how he plays his latest and biggest game.

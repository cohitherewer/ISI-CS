 PLAYING POLITICS

 The 12th finance commission cautioned against a pay commission once every ten years. States petitioned the TFC that the 6th pay commission should not be announced without consulting them. On the face of it, the states have been consulted, but before the cabinet decision, not before the prime minister announced the SPC at a press conference in February. Ostensibly, only Maharashtra and Gujarat have objected. But other states must also have reservations and must have been assured compensation. The 5th pay commission left states bankrupt, unable to pay salaries and pensions in 2000 and it is only now that some rehabilitation has occurred. It is facetious of the prime minister to suggest that the states are flush with funds and can afford salary hikes. Rehabilitation is primarily because of the debt swap scheme, impossible to replicate. Once the Centre implements pay commission recommendations, it is impossible for the states, local bodies and quasi-government not to follow. At the time of the FPC, Delhi?s Super Bazar implemented the recommendations even before the Centre did and subsequently went bankrupt. 

 Pay commission recommendations about linking hikes to productivity, downsizing and abolition of posts are never implemented. The FPC is testimony to that. All that is ever implemented is wage/salary and pension hikes. An economist prime minister should not have advanced the argument about an economy growing at 8 per cent being in a position to pay more to civil servants. Is the growth rate of 8 per cent certain, or is it already under threat, thanks to the United Progressive Alliance?s policies and non-policies? The approach paper to the 11th five year plan (2007-12) does not think 8 per cent will continue under a business-as-usual scenario. Without the SPC?s recommendations, we do not know how much this will cost ? but if the FPC is any indication, something between 1 and 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product. Even if one forgets deficit reduction targets at the Centre and in the states, where will this money come from? Will that not spell fiscal disaster and adversely affect growth rates? 

 It is not very surprising that this year?s Economic Survey and the June 2005 committee headed by Mr B.K. Chaturvedi was dead against the SPC. Fiscal rectitude apart, there will be a regressive transfer towards relatively richer sections of society through opportunity costs of squandered resources borne by the rural poor (about whom the UPA heart bleeds), and towards the 30 million who live in urban India. But then, this is a cynical attempt to play politics, as was the reservation bogey. Give the SPC 18 months. Announce general elections with a promise of implementing the recommendations if voted back. All signs point towards general elections in 2007. As for problems associated with implementing the SPC recommendations, there will be a different prime minister and finance minister then.

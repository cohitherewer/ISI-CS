 QUELLING THE RED STORM TOGETHER

 A CPI(M) victory over the Maoists in West Bengal will be a shot in the arm for states fighting the rebels elsewhere in India, writes Sumanta Sen 

 The rising

 In an earlier article, I had written about the danger of a tribal upheaval hanging like the proverbial sword of Damocles over the nation?s head. Now the question that arises is, what is the nation doing about this or is the country in a position to do anything at all? An answer is not easy to find as there is no single entity as implied by the term ?nation? to deal with the problem. A nation can decide only if the states involved agree on a way to deal with the situation. No such agreement seems to exist as of now.

 The nation, as represented by the Centre, is looking at the issue as one pertaining to law and order which, of course it is, at one level. But, for the Centre, it is also convenient to treat the entire tribal issue in the context of Maoist activities, and hence one of law and order which is a state subject. So New Delhi insists that police chiefs of the different states meet regularly under the aegis of the home ministry and chalk out joint strategies. There have been many such meetings, followed by inevitable rumblings in individual states that they are not receiving cooperation from others. For instance, after the Purulia killings, West Bengal complained, perhaps not without justification, that had Jharkhand been a little more alert, the incident could have been averted. In other words, even if there is a common strategy, it is yet to be put into practice.

 Admittedly, the task is not easy. In Andhra Pradesh, the Congress had tried to open a dialogue with what was then the Peoples? War Group immediately on assuming office. It was an act of gamesmanship ? under the Telugu Desam Party, the state had witnessed widespread violence by the PWG, and the Congress wanted to tell the people that it was seeking to get at the ?root? of the problem through talks rather than by depending on the police. Perhaps it had thought that such talks would earn the state a breather and the PWG would look for newer pastures. The Maoists, in keeping with their own plan, did spread elsewhere but not by giving up their base areas in Andhra Pradesh.

 In West Bengal, on the other hand, the Marxists are clearly not interested in any talks and they cannot be really faulted on this score. Here the Naxalites or Maoists, call them by whatever name you will, have always made it clear that their main purpose is to eliminate the Communist Party of India (Marxist). This is not surprising because it is only in West Bengal that they encounter an ideological opposition which is more dangerous than a physical one. There is thus no meeting ground and the CPI(M) does not see why it should take the initiative to create one.

 The two other concerned parties in power are the Bharatiya Janata Party in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh and the Biju Janata Dal in Orissa. What they think of the Maoists is not known but it can be safely assumed that their ideas on the subject will be influenced by their political opposition to both the Congress and the CPI(M). In such a situation, working out a common strategy can be easy but making it work is difficult. Why should Jharkhand feel uneasy if Maoists bump off some Marxists in West Bengal or why should Andhra Pradesh get worried about the BJD being at the receiving end in Orissa? 

 So right now, it is not clear how the Maoist problem can be tackled unitedly. Here it may also be asked if a band of armed guerrillas can be tackled with the help of the state machinery effectively ? in neighbouring Nepal, the palace has not been able to do it. Also, if at some point of time, the Centre decides to launch a full scale offensive, the first to object would be the CPI(M) as that would ultimately lead to further alienation of the entire tribal society and help the Maoists. This once again raises the question of what is to be done about the menace?

 To a large extent, the answer needs to be provided by the leftists for among all the political forces, they are ideologically more equipped to deal with elements who have interpreted the same ideology in a different manner. Anil Biswas, a member of the CPI(M) politburo, has said that the party will meet the situation politically and that the state government will take administrative measures. This sounds sensible but actually there is a contradiction inherent in this two-pronged approach.

 Tackling the situation politically means ensuring greater interaction with the tribals and standing up for their legitimate rights so that the Maoists cannot make inroads into their minds. These days, this is becoming more difficult because of the hit-and-run tactics of the other side, which has the further advantage of being armed. And if administrative measures are also taken, as they have to be, then to the ordinary tribal, the distinction between the ruling party worker and the ruling party police fades away with the former being seen as an appendage of the latter.

 There is another problem which seems to have grown over the last many years. There is a hiatus today between some of the leaders of the tribal community and the rest. This happens among all sections of society but stands out more in a community that has poverty and backwardness as its only identifying feature. The natural outcome is a weakening of the party?s links with the masses. This may be one of the reasons why tribals in the state have not benefited from the panchayati raj, which monitors the implementation of various poverty amelioration schemes. Calcutta?s attention is drawn only when there is an incident and the impression can gain ground that to remain peaceful is to remain forgotten.

 A disturbing trend is being noticed right now with the CPI(M) cadre in these areas wondering whether they should not also be allowed to take to arms for self-defence. That cannot be the path of a party practising constitutional politics. Yet they may just do that if the attacks mount and a large number of tribals are drawn into the Maoist net. 

 So, for the CPI(M), it is a bit of a catch-22 situation. But the party has to succeed, for if the Maoists are held at bay in the state, then that will have a dampening effect on the guerrillas in the rest of the country as well. It should also be remembered that the Maoists do not exist in far-flung villages only, they have a support base in Calcutta and elsewhere which is out to create confusion. But these armchair ?revolutionaries? need not be taken seriously. It is in the distant hamlets of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore that the CPI(M) is facing a challenge from the Maoists. How and to what extent the party will be able to keep the Maoists at bay with little logistical support from the larger administrative setup remains to be seen. The test is serious enough but then a communist party should not complain about that.

 TO BRING THE OFFENDER TO BOOK

 DOCUMENT

 From the US Supreme Court?s June 2006 ruling on the Guant?namo trials

 The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of Art. 36(a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern ?the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts? to Hamdan?s commission. The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial. And even if subsection (b)?s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsection?s requirements are not satisfied here. 

 Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules here. There is no suggestion, e.g., of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility. It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan?s trial, any variance from the courts-martial rules. The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present...

 Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as ?practicable,? the courts-martial rules must apply. Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b)...

 6. HAMDAN V. RUMSFELD

 Syllabus

 (d) The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions. The D.C. Circuit dismissed Hamdan?s challenge in this regard on the grounds, inter alia, that the Conventions are not judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections. Neither of these grounds is persuasive. Pp. 62 ? 68.

 (i) The appeals court relied on a statement in Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 US 763, 789, n.14, suggesting that this Court lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for observing and enforcing prisoners? rights under the Convention.However, Eisentrager does not control here because, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan...they are indisputably part of the law of war... compliance with which is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted. Pp. 63?65.

 (ii) Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signatory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan.

 The Court need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signatories. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, provides that, in a ?conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [ i.e., signatories],each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,? certain provisions protecting ?[p]ersons... placed hors de combat by ...detention,? including a prohibition on ?the passing of sentences...without previous judgment...by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees...recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.?

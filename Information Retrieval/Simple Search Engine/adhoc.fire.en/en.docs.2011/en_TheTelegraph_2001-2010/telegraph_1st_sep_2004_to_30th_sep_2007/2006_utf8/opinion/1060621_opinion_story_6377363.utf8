The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COSTLY AFFAIR

 Marriages may be made in heaven, but their packaging, thankfully, is left for mortals to accomplish. The villagers of Dimbudih in Tamar ? where the grand wedding of the Jharkhand home minister, Mr Sudesh Mahto, was held recently ? already realize the meaning of such divine mercies. The hamlet, only a short distance from the state capital but without electricity and good roads so far, now has it all by virtue of the bonds of matrimony. To this connection the village also owes the rarely witnessed spectacle of the state machinery in action. There were police and paramilitary forces in full gear, guarding every nook and corner against Naxalite attacks. The state electricity board and public works department were also hard at work and there were medical posts staffed with doctors and nurses. Over and above all this was the sheer pleasure of watching live an extravagance that is now the stuff of telly-inspired dreams.

 ?At what cost?? one may ask. It goes without saying that neither the villagers, nor the much-educated family of the bride, nor Mr Mahto himself are particularly bothered with the question. That politicians inherit the right to spend public money at will the moment they get the mandate is received wisdom, and now probably an established truth as well. The shameless display of wealth may sometimes take Indian politicians, like Ms J. Jayalalithaa, into international record books. But then, the income tax department may step in to confirm that the expenses are not disproportionate to the known assets of the spender (as with Mr Lalu Prasad), or a state department under the chief minister may put its official seal on lavish birthdays (Ms Mayavati). And what about the millions of rupees spent on projects that are inaugurated with much fanfare and never completed? It is not just private ceremonies, but also public occasions that stand as evidence of the politician?s complete disregard for the state coffer.

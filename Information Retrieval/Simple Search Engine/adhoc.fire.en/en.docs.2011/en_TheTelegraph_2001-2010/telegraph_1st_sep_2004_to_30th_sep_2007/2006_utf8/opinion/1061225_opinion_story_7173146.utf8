 Letters to Editor

 Later than expected 

Better late than never

 Sir The conviction of Manu Sharma and his associates in the Jessica Lal murder trial will go a long way in re-establishing peoples faith in the judiciary (Jessica finds justice at last, Dec 19). Crimes against women are on the rise in the country. But the verdict against Sharma shows that the courts are willing to mete out harsh punishment to the perpetrators to arrest this disturbing trend. 

 It is also encouraging to note that many individuals and institutions are making attempts to empower women in their own ways. Moreover, in a democracy such as ours, where the people have the right to free speech, it is easier to raise ones voice in protest against the discrimination suffered by women. This has also compelled the judiciary to sit up and take notice of such incidents. The public and the media, two pillars of a democracy, have succeeded in delivering justice to the victims and their families. The judgment delivered in the Jessica Lal case will provide a new ray of hope and deter men from committing such crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir Manu Sharma has now been found guilty by the courts for the murder of Jessica Lal. However, one has to keep in mind that justice was delivered to Jessica and her family after seven long years, a fact that sheds light on the limitations of our judicial system. Sharma, incidentally, had been set free earlier by a lower court after some key witnesses turned hostile. Now that Sharma has been convicted in the same case, the judiciary should think of taking stern action against those very men who had helped Sharma escape punishment earlier. One also needs to mention the commendable role played by the media in this affair. The verdict in this particular case bears testimony to the fact that public sympathy and pressure exerted by the media can be potent weapons in bringing criminals to book irrespective of their social status. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The law moves at a snails pace in India. It is not as if people are denied justice all the time, but the courts take a long time to give their verdict in most cases. By then, people forget what had actually taken place. This may not have been true in the Jessica Lal case, thanks to the media which kept the facts fresh in peoples minds. But there have been many instances in which justice has eluded victims due to inordinate delays.This has encouraged criminals to go about their business without any fear of the law . If we are really serious about eliminating crime, our courts must be more active and pass speedier judgments.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The verdict passed by the Delhi high court in the Jessica Lal case has come as a breath of fresh air. But it is doubtful whether the verdict will be able to restore the faith of the people in the legal system. But for the strong public protests and the outcry in the media, there would certainly have been a miscarriage of justice on this occasion. It is a shame that the Delhi high court had to quash the verdict of a lower court in order to deliver justice. This shows that no court is infallible and thus cannot be trusted completely. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Much has been spoken and written on the need for amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code. There is a need to bring in some drastic changes in the law to ensure speedy and effective justice. There has also been much talk about the witness protection system but nothing has been done about it yet. The recent amendments and the ones that have been proposed are examples of knee-jerk reaction on the part of the concerned authorities. There has to be a proper analysis of the problems and the determination to do away with them as quickly as possible. Otherwise, there can only be cosmetic changes in the field of law. That would do more harm than good to Indias faltering criminal justice system.

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Ribandar, Goa

 Sir Manu Sharma has been let off lightly. Was the brutal murder of Jessica Lal not a rarest of rare crime, deserving a death penalty? However, the courts at least handed Sharma a life-term, unlike the last time. Another positive outcome is that the courts have now decided to serve notice to the witnesses who turned hostile. But, along with these measures, the courts should also look into the fact that witnesses do not turn hostile because of fear or external pressure. This would help the judicial system solve cases faster. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta

 Sir After a long wait of seven years, Jessica Lals family finally got justice. In fact, the verdict of the court can be interpreted as a victory not only for the victims family, but also for the people of India. The culprits were brought to justice due to the sincere efforts of the people who protested against the earlier judgment of the lower court. With the Delhi high courts declaration, Manu Sharma surrendered to the police, thereby ending a long and tortuous affair. But what the courts have to ensure is that the verdict does not turn out to be a mere flash in the pan. There have been several cases where the culprits have given the law a slip due to the absence of proper evidence. The resolution of this case raises hopes that those days may be over. If the courts maintain the same momentum, we will surely get fair judgment in the future.

 Yours faithfully, 

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

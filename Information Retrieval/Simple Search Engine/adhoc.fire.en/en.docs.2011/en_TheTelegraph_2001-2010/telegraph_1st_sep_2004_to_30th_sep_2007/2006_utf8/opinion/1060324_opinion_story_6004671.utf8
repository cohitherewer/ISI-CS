The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FROM THE MEAN STREETS 

Malvika Singh

 It is deemed ?politically incorrect? to address, criticize or confront many realities that plague us all in some measure, in an attempt to appease one set of people as against another and thereby create anarchic situations in various spaces of this polity. Beggary is one such. Delhi has become the capital of the beggars union, if I am allowed to call it that. They are all over the place. India is enveloped in poverty ? human poverty, poverty of ideas, poverty of solutions, poverty of committed administrators. We seem to be at our lowest ever ebb.

 However, poverty does not necessarily equal beggary and a limited survey in the capital shows us that those men, women and children who bang at car windows with maimed babies in their arms spend their late evenings in their makeshift homes under flyovers, gambling with rather high stakes. When offered free shelters for the night they suggest their kids be taken while they themselves prefer to play cards, or with drugs and spirits and all else that goes with such activity. The police and the administration are aware of this. Yet, no one is prepared to call for their removal from public spaces as they carry on obstructing traffic, pedestrians, pavements, breaking many a law as they carry on their lives.

 There are many reasons for this. The authority that is meant to maintain law and order and protect the citizen against law breakers must be in cahoots with the ?beggars? since they are multiplying rapidly. Selling drugs is a major problem on the streets of Delhi and these beggars are used as conduits. They are drug users as well. Why does the administration permit this when it knows better than us that these people are making the city unsafe with trafficking in all manner of nefarious products, as their nightly profession. What point is there in the demolition of shops where people work for a living when the worst kind of crime is being protected on the wide-open streets for all to see? This double-edged hypocrisy stares us in the face day in and day out.

 Bane of knowledge

 Needless to say, when the prime minister and other such ?dignitaries? move about in their fancy limousines, the roads are ?cleared? of such types and they pretend they know not the truth about this city where basic rules of civil behaviour are flouted by law makers and law breakers alike. Travel across Uttaranchal, Himachal, Punjab or Tamilnadu and you will not find this overwhelming population of beggars. You never see a Sikh begging and there are Sikhs who are poor, below the poverty line. The fact is that the beggars of Delhi are by no means ?poor?. It is just easy to hang about on the streets eating, drinking, sleeping, excreting, bathing, as they hassle and harass all and sundry, use drugs, are bought for sex, and have no responsibility at all, while the authority shares in the loot, turns a blind eye because it does not have the intellectual wherewithal to find appropriate economically viable solutions for this problem.

 There was a time, not that long ago, when there was no beggar at any traffic light. There were no maimed men crawling in front of a car on Lodhi Road. Today, driving at 10 kilometres per hour you could inadvertently injure or even kill someone crawling on the street in front of your car, because for love or money, they cannot be seen at night. The police will then haul you off, extort from you, take his hafta. The streets of this ancient and celebrated city have become a dangerous nightmare at all times of day and night. If only the prime minister could traverse the streets one evening from sunset to dawn he would realize what chaos and criminality prevail. It is the lieutenant governor who controls the police force and law and order. He and his officers must be made accountable to the city of Delhi and its citizenry.

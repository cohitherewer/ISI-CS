 FIRING LINE

 Life on the border between unfriendly nations can be full of uncertainties. The people living along the Ichhamati river in the Hasnabad area of West Bengal have known this for long. But what they experienced last week was nothing short of a nightmare. The villagers had to flee their homes. Even schools had to be closed for a couple of days. All this because the men of the Border Security Force and the Bangladesh Rifles fired intermittently across the border. Things turned especially grim one day when the two sides fired 10,000 rounds of ammunition over six hours. The tension may have eased since the two sides held a flag meeting, but the problem needs a more comprehensive solution acceptable to both. Similar hostilities elsewhere along the border have made lives and livelihoods uncertain for large numbers of people. Recently, in Assam, four villagers were killed during a battle between the two sides over a small piece of land. The saddest thing is that deaths of innocent people do not move hearts or minds either in New Delhi or in Dhaka.

 Worse still, the two governments use the deaths on the border in order to score political and diplomatic points. In Dhaka, the deaths are used by the ruling coalition to whip up jingoistic sentiments. It helps Bangladesh?s ruling combine to project an anti-Indian image because the Awami League, the main opposition party, is projected as a pro-Indian force. As the next general elections in Bangladesh draw closer, the ?India factor? is likely to figure more in its domestic politics. Even these deaths will be grist to the political mill. But incidents like the ones at Hasnabad are proof also of a hardened stand in New Delhi. The border in the east does not pose the kind of security threat for India as the border with Pakistan does. The people killed by the BSF or BDR are mostly civilians and not terrorists or infiltrators who die in Jammu and Kashmir. Even if New Delhi has some justification for seeing an increasing security threat in the east, it has more to do with the recent rise of Islamist terror groups in Bangladesh. New Delhi also has old complaints about Bangladeshis illegally entering India and about militants from the North-east using some places across the border for arms training and as shelters. Dhaka?s persistent refusal to accept or act on these complaints has toughened India?s position on border-related issues. Instead of making any attempt to resolve the disputes, the two sides seem to have allowed a hostile attitude to replace foreign policy initiatives. But this stand-off between governments is proving costly for the security of ordinary people.

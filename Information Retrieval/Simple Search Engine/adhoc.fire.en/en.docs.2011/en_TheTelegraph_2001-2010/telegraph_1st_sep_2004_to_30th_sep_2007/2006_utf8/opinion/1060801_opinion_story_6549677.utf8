 TRAGIC OR COMIC?

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Life in India is like a tragicomic farce, where corruption and all the horrors of bad living blend easily with helpless, nervous laughter because there is nothing anyone can do to alleviate wrong and replace it with integrity and dignity. You have to pinch yourself hard to believe what you read in the newspapers and you feel nauseated with the lack of action from the government. Here is the funniest story of them all. A successful builder in New Delhi had constructed Asia?s first certified eco-friendly five-star hotel on the road to the international airport in the capital. He owned this hotel that had violated all land-use provisions and was therefore slated to be demolished. A fake demolition was conducted where the owner paid the demolition fee and had all the papers to prove that his property had been razed to the ground. However, the hotel still stands and is conducting regular business. 

 Every day, there are real life stories that enter our television screens revealing vignettes of corruption. Recently there was a delightful programme on how three lakh in cash can get a child admitted into a prestigious school in Delhi. The school was named, the film showed the campus and the offices where the conversation and transaction happened, the people concerned are all on film speaking the truth of their corrupt racket, and life carries on happily for these men and women who have made breaking the law a fine and fool-proof habit. 

 In both the cases mentioned here, indulging in this kind of blatant illegality makes sense because it will take a minimum of twenty years for the courts, from lower, high to upper, in appeals and counter-appeals, to come up with a verdict. By that point, most of the characters concerned will be either dead of infirm, but most definitely, far more prosperous. Those many years later, it will suit them to have the property demolished since by that point it will have fallen apart anyway.

 Weak spine

 Inane and ridiculous laws, rules, regulations and norms, many of which belong to our colonial past when we were the exploited, continue to rule us even though we have liberated ourselves from that demeaning yolk. Archaic and unchanged, these laws that affect ordinary citizens such as building laws, laws pertaining to commercial practices, tax laws and suchlike, have suffocated honesty and forced illegality and corruption to overwhelm our lives. Bureaucrats and politicians, administrators of all description from the law-and-order brigades to municipalities, have fed on this great weakness of our fledgling democracy, destroyed the fabric of our civilization, made a complete mockery of integrity and other such human values and have reduced us to a soft state with a weak and supine spine. 

 Our leadership seems incapacitated and does not respond. The people recognize this failure and have taken the responsibility for their betterment, into their own, individual hands. They have made their own rules and wherever a hurdle appears, accompanied by a babu, bribes are paid and life carries on.

 And then, from amidst this dirt and mire, comes the draft of the Right to Information Act, one that will enforce transparency and accountability and hopefully, the beginning of the cleansing of a disease-infested system. This glimmer of hope rapidly descends into bureaucratic sniggers. The babu has had his way and scuttled the one act that would have been the watchdog of government, for the people. These men and women who operate the machine of governance panicked when they saw the possibility of their hitherto protected and unilaterally operated fiefdom being brought within the purview of democratic rules and norms. Hectic lobbying with their political masters ensured that the tenets of the act be diluted to yet another farce. End of Empire.

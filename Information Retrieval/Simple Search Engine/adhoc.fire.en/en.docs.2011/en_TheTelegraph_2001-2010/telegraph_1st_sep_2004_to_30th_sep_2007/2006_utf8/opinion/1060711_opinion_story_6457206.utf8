 PLAYING PRIVATE GAMES

 MALVIKA SINGH

 To constantly demean the prime minister of India is just not on. The misuse of his non-combative trait of personality is making the UPA look like an incompetent bunch unable to bring dignity and professionalism to the office the members hold, the people and country that they represent. It is the sad truth, whether those in the Congress or in government believe it or not. The largest single party in this coalition is being blackmailed by some of its partners and at the same time, being betrayed by its own men and women who continue to jockey for power and position and are unable to work as a collective. The moment rulers and their bureaucrats cease to hear, find excuses and longwinded explanations to cover up their many follies, we know that their end is near. It is so typical and predictable that it does not require a political pundit to prophesy what is in store for the UPA and the Congress in particular, when it goes to the polls three years from now.

 However, if office-holders of the Congress were truly committed to their party and leader, they would stop playing their insidious and often consciously destructive games where they manipulate half-truths and lies as they make good their personal ambitions at the cost of their office and nation. It is there for all to see and more often than not, hear. Delhi is a city where the oral tradition of this ancient civilization is alive and kicking. Everyone knows who is saying what to whom and who is doing what to whom. It is the Indian way of being ?transparent?. The stories that abound in the corridors of the capital make one squirm and feel scared at the same time. The mind boggles to think that, in their greed, key individuals in government and the party are fast losing the historic opportunity they got to shift gears and move forward. These past masters at political intrigue, with the technique of playing one against another, have used the walled-in headquarters of the Congress high command to their advantage, negating all the inherent strengths of the past and the future.

 Driving a wedge

 Some, who are seen to be ?close? to the highest seat of power in the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, tom-tom it around, speaking out of context, deliberately debasing their leader and her office. They encourage the worst form of infighting and this time they have anchored their negativism and internal attack on Manmohan Singh. Many are jockeying for his job and hope that as the insults mount this honourable man will throw in his resignation and walk into oblivion. If only one could tell the stories, name the people, expose the betrayal of both Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi by their very own ?trusted lieutenants? and party people! This party does not respect Sonia Gandhi, they merely use her in the field, to win votes. In Delhi they spread canards about her lack of political understanding, her ?shyness? and therefore her isolation from people at large and realities on the ground, her favourites, her likes and dislikes that they make up to suit their little games. They talk ?authoritatively? about whom she trusts, whom she mistrusts, and how she is holding the exalted space for her son, Rahul Gandhi, and therefore they have to find ways of getting into the inner circle of the young man. They have verbal diarrhoea about how she and the prime minister have drifted apart, and so it goes on.

 Even if some of this is true, the senior office-holders of the Congress should not be indulging in this kind of claptrap. They should be hauled over the coals and most definitely removed from their pedestals. A radical purging of the old-fashioned, scheming and utterly incompetent lot should be put into immediate action. There should be a full stop on the real offices of profit, on what the ordinary person calls ?corruption?. Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh should take the risk and call their bluff.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ROLE CALL

 Stealing the vote can take many forms. Violence during elections is the crudest of them. In Bengal, electoral frauds seem to have struck deep roots, thanks to the ruling Marxists? well-entrenched organizational network and their stranglehold on the administration. The ?bogus? voters that the Election Commission?s adviser, Mr K.J. Rao, identified in Nadia represent a malaise that plagues elections all over the state. He may not find it difficult either to identify the perpetrators of the fraud. True, this is not the first time that the EC is trying to cleanse the vote in Bengal. Opposition parties have routinely accused the Marxists of stuffing the lists with bogus voters and of playing other tricks to win elections. What is new this time is the rather unusual admission by the leftists themselves that the names of ?false? voters abound in the rolls. But there is enough reason to suspect that the admission is more a political ploy than anything else. Why else would the Left Front chairman, Mr Biman Bose, seek to put the onus of faulty voters? lists on the EC? To most analysts, the left?s own role in the manipulations is Bengal?s worst kept secret. 

 A clean-up of the elections in Bengal has a much wider significance than is understood even by opposition politicians. The fraud on the electoral rolls does not simply make the elections unfair. It distorts the state?s demography and thereby can make public life susceptible to all kinds of dangers. If hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis figure in the voters? lists by virtue of the ration cards they managed to get fraudulently, it is a matter of serious concern for the country?s security. Also, more and more people would lose their faith in democratic institutions if they are robbed of their right to a free and fair vote. Such scepticism can only help anarchists. But cynical politicians would not be bothered by such concerns. It is up to the EC, therefore, to do all it can to retain the people?s faith in the vote. It is time that the EC was given wider powers to put an errant state administration in its place.

 Paperback Pickings

 We all meet strange people

 the 

 patiala quartet (Penguin, Rs 225) by Neel 

 Kamal Puri is a ?first novel? set in the Patiala of 

 the Eighties, in the shadow of terrorism. Four young people 

 ? the siblings Monty and Minnie, and Michael and Karuna 

 ? play out their respective destinies in this town. This 

 is a lively and wistful novel about fear and hope, heartache 

 and choices, holding on and letting go. This novel needed 

 a stricter editor to pare down the over-writing: ?In the 

 golden-turning-into-brown evening, Balwinder had been walking 

 back to the village with a friend. This was a land where, 

 at one time, the only ominous things about darkness were 

 the shapes conjured up from innocuous trees and bushes by 

 the willing imagination of childhood. But this was no childhood. 

 This was a world in which shapes materialized into reality.?

 the 

 moonlit cage (Headline Review, ? 2.99) by 

 Linda Holeman is another ?sweeping saga? full of ?wickedly? 

 courageous women, singing Rumi and cutting open pomegranates 

 and reliving exotic memories. (Her other novel is called 

 Linnet Bird.) The protagonist here is Darya, a young Afghan 

 girl, ?cursed, worthless and despised by her husband?, who 

 embarks on ?the journey of a lifetime? from her rugged and 

 repressive homeland to the London of the 1850s. The first 

 part is set ?in the shadow of the Hindukush?, in 1845, the 

 second ?under the Blade of the Indian Sun?, and the third 

 is called ?Land of the Dirty Sky?. ?Please read my story,? 

 Darya pleads in the prologue, ?and as you do, ponder this 

 question: Am I truly wicked? And when it is over, you can 

 be the judge.?

 the 

 old man and his god: discovering the spirit of india 

 (Penguin, Rs 150) by Sudha Murty is an astonishingly 

 self-congratulatory book about the ?real-life experiences? 

 of a writer, social worker and teacher, as she goes about 

 her work among villagers, slum-dwellers and the common men 

 and women of India: ?People often ask me how it is that 

 so many interesting things happen only to me. To them I 

 reply that in life?s journey we all meet strange people 

 and undergo so many experiences that touch us and sometimes 

 even change us. If you have a sensitive mind and record 

 your observations regularly, you will see your life too 

 is a vast storehouse of stories.? The writing is mostly 

 rather unremarkable.

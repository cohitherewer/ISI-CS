The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LATE TO SCHOOL

 Children do not go to school to die. This may not be among the greatest of discoveries ? or revelations ? but it has taken a while to dawn on the administrators who run the country and, presumably, also look after the education of its children. The Centre has submitted to the Supreme Court a set of draft guidelines for safe school-buildings, and a proposal to set up boards for educational buildings at the national, state and district levels to ensure safety measures in existing and future schools. All this came as a response to a public interest litigation questioning safety arrangements for students and referring to the hideous school-building fire at Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu almost two years ago. It has really taken a very long time ? and a PIL ? for administrators to come to an official recognition ? still in danger of fizzling out ? that school-buildings need to be safe places. They should, ideally, have built-in safeguards against fire, proper exits and playing areas, drinking water and bathrooms and a protected approach when surrounded by busy streets. A successful midday meal scheme, however encouraging, cannot make up for the lack of these.

 But to blame administrators alone is to take the easy way out. Administrators are part of a society, a society that habitually forgets to take care of its children. For years, established schools in cities have forgotten to provide fire safety measures and playgrounds ? crowding pupils into their classrooms with a casual forgetfulness that children are persons and need a bit of physical space ? and gotten away with it. Education is dispensed at a high price, as a favour. In contrast, schools in villages lack teachers and walls, bathrooms, boards and drinking-water, and four different classes can be crowded into a tiny room for there is no other. It is not that education is devalued: there is a callousness still about education of the less pri- vileged on the one hand, and a total unconsciousness about the rights of all children on the other.

 Boards for school-buildings may be good things, if they do come about. But real commitment will be needed to undo the long history of callousness, and such a sudden change of heart seems unlikely. Buildings ? or the lack of them ? are not the only issue. A serious reason for alarm that has been building up through numerous surveys is the poor level of ability being acquired by schooling, even after enrolment rates are showing an increase. Neither has the drop-out rate improved remarkably. The route to change is not through occasional administrative stirrings and new spools of red-tape, though the former is necessary, but through awareness among parents and the community about what is best for their children and what should be demanded for them. Without this pressure, another Kumbakonam would be waiting to happen.

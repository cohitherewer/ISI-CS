 NUKES TO NEW AGE MEDICINE

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 The FRM-II in Germany is designed for neutron beam utilization and has features that include a secondary neutron source, and accessories such as neutron guides for special experiments. These features are useful in studies of soft matter-polymers, biological species and liquids and disordered materials. The MNSR research reactor in Nigeria, on the other hand, will extensively be used for activation analysis for applications in areas such as environment, food and agriculture. 

 Multipurpose research reactors, such as the OPAL reactor in Australia and CARR in China, are expected to become operational in 2006 with radioisotope production, silicon doping and neutron beam applications as major activities. 

 The Reduced Enrichment for Research and Test Reactors Programme seeks to convert research reactors using highly enriched uranium fuel to low enriched uranium fuel. Continuing support for the development and qualification of high density LEU fuels and for fostering fission molybdenum-99 production using LEU targets are other activities under the RERTR Programme. 

 There are concerns about the future reliability of radioisotope availability, if due attention is not paid now to meet future research reactor irradiation needs. There are only four major industrial producers of molybdenum-99, but many more research reactors are used for irradiating HEU/LEU targets.

 There is no discernible trend for the industrial companies considering a switch to use of LEU targets, and RERTR Programme participants have focussed additional attention on this issue. The successful demonstration by the National Atomic Energy Commission, in Argentina, of medium scale regular production of molybdenum-99 using locally produced LEU targets, is a notable advance in this regard... 

 More than 150 different radioisotopes in various forms are in use for diverse applications in many sectors of economic significance, including medicine, food processing, industry, agriculture, structural safety and research. The potential for expanding radioisotope applications and spreading the benefits to developing countries continues to be high. Radioisotopes are produced in at least 25 countries, while more than thirty additional countries are likely producers of isotopes... 

 The medical field accounts for the majority of isotope applications, followed by industry and research. Radionuclide generator systems continue to play a key role in providing both diagnostic and therapeutic radioisotopes for various applications in nuclear medicine, oncology and interventional cardiology. The use of yttrium-90 for radionuclide therapy is favoured because the parent radionuclide, strontium-90, is available in large quantities from spent-fuel reprocessing. The recovery of strontium-90, followed by large-scale centralized separation of yttrium-90 or production of radionuclide generators, could become a major radiochemical process in countries possessing fuel reprocessing facilities. Interest in establishing medical cyclotrons for radioisotope production is growing in many developing countries... 

 Macroscopic polymer gels are now well-established biomaterials typically used as soft contact lenses, hydrogel wound dressings and devices for controlled drug delivery. There is a growing interest in synthesis, properties and applications of microscopic polymer gels, i.e. microgels and nanogels... 

 Such gels have potent- ial applications as drug and gene carriers, polymeric drugs, biomarkers, also as substrates for separation and adsorption of bio-molecules. Nanogels are mostly obtained by emulsion polymerization.

 Intra-molecular cross-linking of single polymer coils by short pulse electron irradiation of dilute solutions has been proposed by a group in Poland and has the advantages of absence of monomers, cross-linking agents and other potentially toxic compounds, which are needed in conventional processes. 

 Electron beam lithography for direct writing technology has been in extensive use for the fabrication of nano-scale integrated circuit devices. An electron beam lithographic tool was used by university researchers in Glasgow to fabricate features as small as 20 nm diameter on 100 nm pitch which provide arrays of nano-dots for use in cellular engineering.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MUTUAL FAITH

 Mutual trust between countries is not simply a matter of bargains. If India?s relations with Bangladesh have been clouded by suspicions, the prime reason is not the trade imbalance between the countries or the unequal distribution of river waters. The relations have soured over the threats to India?s security from different groups operating from Bangladesh. Not that Dhaka did not know about this Indian concern. What really upset New Delhi was the persistent refusal by the government of Ms Khaleda Zia to accept the Indian complaint and act on it. It would be unrealistic to expect that her visit to New Delhi signalled any substantive change in Dhaka?s position. The joint statement of good intentions notwithstanding, the perceptions do not seem to have changed much. The evidence of this comes from the denial by Bangladesh?s finance minister, Mr Saifur Rahman, that his country harboured Islamist terrorists or militants from India?s North-east. Not only India but also the rest of the world think differently. The rise of Islamist terrorism in Bangladesh and its threat to India?s security are not matters of opinion; they are now accepted as facts by the international community. The same is true of the illegal migration of Bangladeshis to India. 

 However, there are issues on which the two countries can strike meaningful bargains. Some of Dhaka?s complaints on trade have some validity. It has been pleading for the withdrawal of tariff and non-tariff barriers on exports of Bangladeshi goods to India. New Delhi can ? and should ? do more in order to reduce the trade imbalance that hurts Dhaka. It is a good omen that Ms Zia?s visit resulted in the two countries renewing the existing agreement on bilateral trade. The agreement on expanding and improving transport facilities between the two is another positive outcome of the visit. Despite the air of mutual misunderstanding, a beginning was made in this area by previous governments in Dhaka and New Delhi. It is possible to argue that Dhaka has a point in demanding a right of passage to Nepal or Bhutan through Indian territory in exchange for giving similar rights to India. But, Ms Zia should know that these smaller problems can be sorted out once Dhaka acts on India?s main concerns. It is for Bangladesh to ensure that it will not allow terrorist and other subversive groups to use the country as a base for their anti-India operations.

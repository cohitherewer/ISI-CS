 MILLION-CAR YEAR

 For the first time in India?s history, the passenger car industry produced over a million cars in 2005 ? 1,012,673 to be precise. In addition to the million cars, the industry produced 266,000 utility and medium passenger vehicles. And it is not just the numbers that gratify. From four undistinguished models of the early Nineties, the choice for buyers has expanded to over two dozen. The industry has not yet realized Mr Ratan Tata?s dream of a Rs 100,000 car, but it offers plenty of choice between Rs 200,000 and Rs 300,000. Whilst that is a creditable achievement, there are signs that the pace of growth is slowing down. Annual output growth came down from 30 per cent in 2004 to 9 per cent in 2005. The increase in output in 2005 was a mere 16,000 over the previous year?s rise of 202,000. The slackening growth can be attributed to demand. Last year, cars were selling so fast that sales bit into inventories; this year, supply and demand balanced better. The middle class is still squeezing itself into cars, but not so fast. 

 It may look as if prosperity is trickling down, for output of two-wheelers grew at almost the same rate in 2004 and 2005 ? 17 per cent ? to reach 7.3 million. But there too, domestic sales have slowed down; growth has been maintained by exports. Mopeds, going out of fashion at home, are finding markets abroad. Two-wheelers are yet to be exported on the scale of cars, a sixth of whose output is going abroad; but they are getting there. The slowing growth of domestic demand for personal vehicles probably reflects a slackening of the general boom conditions in the economy. But it may be that some potential buyers are daunted by the prospect of driving on our roads. It is not just the accident rates that put people off. As the danger of being killed by a speeding vehicle has receded, the fear of being immobilized in a traffic jam, far from the nearest pissoir, has multiplied. Even where traffic moves, the irritation of having to endure screaming motorcycles, lurching three-wheelers, uncivilized minibuses and reckless taxis is enough to make people take buses, which are comparatively safe havens but for a stray pickpocket. 

 The areas being developed towards the airport, east of Calcutta, are an exception to this universal Indian bedlam. In fact, there are roads feeding the EM bypass where drivers long to see a passing vehicle. This is an asset that West Bengal could usefully advertise. It is not just Mr Deve Gowda who has dimmed Bangalore?s lustre; it is the long and dreary trek to its outskirts along perennially jammed roads. A picture of our uncluttered highways would whet the appetite of IT entrepreneurs. That the heroic trade unions of Calcutta do not clog those eastern roads is an added bonus ? as long as it lasts.

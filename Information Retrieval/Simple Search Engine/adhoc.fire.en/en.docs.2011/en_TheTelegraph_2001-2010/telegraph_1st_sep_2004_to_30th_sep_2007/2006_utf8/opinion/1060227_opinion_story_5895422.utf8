 Sweet revenge

 Sir ? The Indian cricket team should be congratulated for their emphatic series win over Pakistan in the onedayers (?Yuvraj, Dhoni bulldoze Pakistan?, Feb 20). There is no doubt that the Indians outclassed their rivals in all departments of the game. And the credit for this goes to the much-maligned coach, Greg Chappell. Cricket is a mind game, and the wily Chappell out-thought the Pakistanis by shuffling the team?s batting line-up frequently. The manner in which he groomed youngsters like Suresh Raina, R.P. Singh, M.S. Dhoni and Irfan Pathan into potential match winners reminds us of the legendary Matt Busby who turned Manchester United into a winning machine in the late fifties. With Sachin Tendulkar rediscovering his touch and captain Rahul Dravid playing a stellar role, the Indian oneday side looks like a formidable unit. However, it was sad to see that the celebrations were rather subdued in Calcutta, as its favourite son is now out of the Indian team. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? After their shameful capitulation in the test series, the Indian cricketers settled scores with their rivals by winning the oneday series against Pakistan in a handsome manner. Both Rudra Pratap Singh and S. Sreesanth proved to be quite a handful for the Pakistanis who were on a high after beating England at home. It was encouraging to see the Indians playing four medium pacers on pitches tailor-made for batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Mahendra Singh Dhoni also chipped in with their batting but the real discovery of the series was Yuvraj Singh who showed an amazing consistency with the bat, something he had failed to do earlier. However, not everything went according to plan for the Indians. Both Gautam Gambhir and Mohammad Kaif failed to score and perhaps it would be a good idea to try out players like Gaurav Dhiman and Cheteshwar Pujara who played well in the under-19 world cup. One more thing. Maybe Rahul Dravid needs to be told to make Suresh Raina bowl during the matches as this lad from Uttar Pradesh has all the potential to become a match-winning supersub. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The oneday series win against Pakistan is commendable for two reasons. First, this was the second successive oneday series that the Indians have won on Pakistani soil. Second, with this series win, Rahul Dravid and his boys avenged their defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the onedayers played at home last year. What is truly remarkable about this Indian team is the fact that the Indians now win matches by playing as a team, rather than with the help of a few brilliant individuals. Thus, players like Tendulkar, Yuvraj, Dhoni and Pathan stood up to be counted when it really mattered. Another gain from the series was the contribution of India?s young guns who deserve every bit of the accolades that are being showered on them. However, Indians should not be carried away by their success as they still need to work on a few things before the World cup. The team still lacks a genuine fast bowler who can make an impression on a quality opposition like Australia. Moreover, while Indians have been good chasers of late, they are yet to master the art of defending totals. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There was no Tendulkar or Sehwag in the fifth and final onedayer against Pakistan and yet, the Indians managed to make a target of 287 runs appear paltry. The facile victory over Pakistan shows that the days when the team?s fortunes would depend only on the genius of Sachin Tendulkar are well and truly over. This is a new, resurgent Indian side that is capable of putting it across to their more-fancied rivals. If this team continues to play like this, the dream of winning the next World Cup may soon become a reality. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Indian players deserve to be praised for their splendid performance in the onedayers against Pakistan. However, Rahul Dravid needs to remember that the work is just half done. The Indian captain must realize that the team needs to show the same zeal in order to win test matches in the future. Is the Indian coach, Greg Chappell, listening?

 Yours faithfully,

Ajit Guha, Nashik

 nSir ? The result of the oneday series in Pakistan bodes well for India?s chances of success in the forthcoming World Cup. It is heartening to see that the Indian team?s dependence on senior players is on the wane. The young players have taken the responsibility of the team on their youthful shoulders. With star players like Tendulkar, Dravid and Laxman now on the wrong side of thirties, it is time that the young turks take up the mantle of the team and try and emulate the feat of Kapil?s Devils in the forthcoming World Cup.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ram, Calcutta

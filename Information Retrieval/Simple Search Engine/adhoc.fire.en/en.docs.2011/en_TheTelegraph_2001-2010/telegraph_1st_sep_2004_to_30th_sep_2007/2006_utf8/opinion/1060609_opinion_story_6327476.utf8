 NATURAL CHOICE

 There are few things that money cannot buy. And, as proven, it can even get one that most ?divine? of all gifts ? children ? through frighteningly expensive fertility treatments, and now through a more sure-fire way of hiring a womb. Which is why the search for a surrogate mother was perhaps a ?natural? choice for an infertile couple from suburban West Bengal when other kinds of medical intervention had not borne fruit. The idea was suggested to the Dases in Habra by a television serial and, like the other harbingers of silent change in deeper India that the media transmit, the thought was captivating. The Dases are not alone. There are other Indians thinking along the same lines. India recorded a 150 per cent rise in such applications only two years ago ? that is, before the Indian Council of Medical Research decided to put some strictures in place regarding surrogacy. According to its guidelines, the surrogate mother has to be a married woman with children, a detailed contract has to be signed between the parties and the payment for the service fixed. There are, however, still no laws on such dealings, although a Centrally-appointed 15-member committee is supposed to have submitted its report on the matter. 

 For a subject as emotionally charged as surrogacy, the transactional nature of the business is obviously disconcerting, doubly so for India which, as reports suggest, is fast emerging as a haven for foreign couples in search of surrogate wombs at lower prices. There is no doubt that those willing to lend their wombs do not always do so for money. There are instances in India where grandmothers and sisters have borne surrogate children. But familial ties are not the only spur to the desire to bear a child for another. It would be na?ve to ignore its commercial underpinnings. This, together with other unresolved issues like parental rights, both genetic and surrogate, the possible medical complications during childbirth, the legal, and more important, the social identity of the surrogate mother, have complicated things. Couples who opt for surrogacy do so by rejecting adoption as a way of parenting. Since they have the option, a transparent legal guideline should be placed before them so that they can exercise their choice conscientiously, and surrogate mothers can bear children for others without any attendant stigma.

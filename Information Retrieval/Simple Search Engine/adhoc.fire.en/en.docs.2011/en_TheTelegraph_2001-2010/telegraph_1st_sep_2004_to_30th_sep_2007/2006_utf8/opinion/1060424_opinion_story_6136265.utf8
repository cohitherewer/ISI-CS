 RIDE TO REFORM

 Politics can be a great leveller. Today?s protesters become tomorrow?s conformists. The rules of the game can force the transformation on one and all, irrespective of political and ideological differences. That is the moral of the story about Ms Mamata Banerjee finally using helicopters for electioneering. Ms Banerjee?s image of the woman next door ? of one living in humble circumstances, wearing ordinary clothes, and keeping away from displays of wealth and power ? has been the unique selling point of her brand of politics. It is not to be mistaken for the so-called creed of plain living and high thinking. Politicians in India take great pains to cultivate ordinariness. They have been groomed in a political culture that breeds in them a belief that a display of such an image, at least in public life, can win votes during the elections. Ms Banerjee had obviously learnt the art from others, but sometimes overdid it to absurd proportions. That this image did not help her beyond a point proves that substance, not style, is the important thing in politics as much as in other matters.

 However, Ms Banerjee?s helicopter rides also show how the demands of times can change perceptions. In Bengal, the leftists once cried foul of things that were associated with the rich and the upper classes. Not very long ago, leftist leaders would try and do everything to keep away from the business community. Chambers of commerce and industry were out of bounds for most of them even after they had come to power in 1977. It did not occur to these leaders that once they had accepted the responsibilities of governance, their pretensions of political correctness would simply look deceptive. This aversion to business added to other factors that were responsible for the state?s economic slowdown. Besides, the left?s business-unfriendly image did not help promote the investors? interest in Bengal. Much of that has changed, especially during the last five years of Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s reign. The Communist Party of India (Marxist), once known for its obstructionist and anti-development image, has also changed. As the most popular opposition leader, Ms Banerjee has pursued the same old politics of street-fights. The agenda for all parties in India are increasingly being shaped by economic reforms. But before they accept such reforms, the politicians would do well to change their old mindset. If Ms Banerjee?s new image means a real change in her politics, it is good news for Bengal.

 A FEW MORE MYTHS CRACKED

 Following Muhammad: Re-thinking Islam in the Contemporary World By Carl W. Ernst, Yoda, Rs 450

 To the post 9/11 Western world, Islam has almost become synonymous with terrorism. Islamic terrorist outfits have done their bit to perpetuate the notion. If this attitude is in some ways symptomatic of what Eric Hobsbawm calls the age of extremism, there are moderates like Tony Blair who believe that such atrocities are never sanctioned by true Islamic tradition.

 In The Clash of Civilizations: The Remaking of the World Order, Samuel P. Huntington traces the root of religious bigotry and other forms of jingoism in the uneasy acceptance of Western modernism by the non-Western world. Amartya Sen repudiates this confrontational view in Identity and Violence, demonstrating that an individual, irrespective of race and culture, has multiple identities and glorifying only one of them, ignoring others, is gross reductionism. Being a Muslim, Sen holds, means a lot more than a solitarist affiliation to Islam.

 Carl W. Ernst too, upholds Sens view, but somewhat differently. He is not concerned with the Muslim as an individual, but with Islam. He is keen to debunk the myth that Islam is a monolithic, changeless religion, with an inviolable, rigid set of rules. He highlights the dynamic structures of Islam which the myopic Western vision has always failed to spot. Ernst attacks the hypocrisy, superciliousness and the audacious claim of universality which, to his mind, characterize Western discourses on religion.

 Ernst begins with the inadequacy of the term religion for an unqualified application to a faith like Islam. He feels that the colonial masters and Christian missionaries encouraged religious dogmatism a charge Christians often bring on Muslims. Ernst goes further to say that Christians neither acknowledge the idea of pluralism in Islamic law, nor do they appreciate the reforms that have taken place within the faith.

 In the chapter, The sacred sources of Islam, Ernst discusses the calligraphic representations of the Prophet since medieval times. In Ethics and life in the world, the author stresses that different systems of religious ethics inform Islam, as they do other religions a fact which is overlooked by the West. Spirituality in practice charts the long, eventful career of Sufism and also delves into the syncretic nature of Islamicate art.

 Ernst has produced an impressive scholastic work, unravelling the folds of an ancient faith and carrying on the Saidian project of exploding European myths about the mystic East. In its sweep, Following Muhammad is comparable to Benjamin Walkers Foundations of Islam.

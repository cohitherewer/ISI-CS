 SPEED AWAY

 Late night parties seem to be ending in nightmares more and more frequently in Indias big cities, particularly for those who have no reason to join the fun. The seven left dead in the ugly accident in Mumbai last weekend are victims of the crass irresponsibility of a set of people who brook no limits to their enjoyment of life. Mr Alistair Pareira (and his friends), who ran his car over labourers and their families sleeping on the street, belongs to this set. Their recklessness is matched by that of many among their peers. They see no harm in taking the wheel when they can scarcely stand on their feet. There are others of their kind who cannot lay claim to the exuberance of youth. A film star nearing middle age and a senior executive of a multinational company have shown the same behavioural traits, as have several others. Their confidence in their own power and influence seems to have doubled their contempt for ordinary lives. They have fatally injured people and left them to die on the road, and have also refused to take the blame. The evidence pointing to their wrongdoing has often been manipulated, witnesses threatened and legal jargon used to escape culpability. This is why the conviction rate in hit-and-run cases remains abysmal. Eight years after a BMW mowed down six labourers in the capital, the killer is still roaming free. And freedom has perhaps come at a price less than the designer car. 

 What messages are being sent to the youth of this country? What will they learn when the legal machinery is shown to be malleable enough to bend to the whims of a privileged few? The son of an influential officer had succeeded in evading punishment for rape and murder till recently. In two other cases of gruesome killing, the sons of politicians continue to escape the long arm of the law with the help of their fathers money and muscle. It is the larger society that is paying the price of this parental indulgence. Mr Pareira and his friends have committed a crime, and they deserve to be punished for that. It goes without saying that there will be the invariable attempts to tamper with the evidence, browbeat the witnesses (who are poor and therefore especially vulnerable), and to pass off the matter as another instance of rash driving. But if the crime is allowed to remain sitting lightly on the offenders youthful shoulder, then there will always be others wanting to risk it too.

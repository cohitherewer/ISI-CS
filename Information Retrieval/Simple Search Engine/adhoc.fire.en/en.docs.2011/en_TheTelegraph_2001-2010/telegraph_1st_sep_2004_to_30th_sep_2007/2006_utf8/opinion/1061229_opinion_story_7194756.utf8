 PAST TENSE

 History is about yesterday, but life is not. So it follows that life cannot be lived looking backwards. Yet this is what those who run Indian cricket seem intent on doing. After a series of reverses in the one-day internationals in South Africa, the selectors decided that they had no other option save recalling Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman. Without deriding, in any way, the talent and the achievements of both these players, it should be admitted that neither quite represents the future of Indian cricket. Both are well into their thirties and have only a few years of topclass cricket left in them. Their recall can only be interpreted as a retreat from the future. The future of Indian cricket lies in nurturing younger talent. This will obviously entail a certain amount of experimentation and even of failure. But, for the sake of the future, it is necessary not to lose nerve. 

 There are other manifestations of the same propensity. Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya, who has made himself into a kind of legend in cricket administration in India and in West Bengal, has been forced to step down as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal. This no doubt brings an era to an end. But Mr Dalmiya refuses to free the CAB from the past. According to reports, he has requested Mr Biswanath Dutt to be a candidate in the succession race. Mr Dutt, in his time, has been a president of the CAB and Board of Control for Cricket in India. But that was a long time ago. He is an octogenarian who has retired from cricket administration. He cannot be the architect of the CABs future. It is difficult to understand why his name is being proposed for the post of president unless Mr Dalmiya sees it as a move to maintain continuity, if not control. Thus, both at the level of the playing field and in the back rooms, where some of the crucial decisions affecting cricket are taken, the past seems to be making a comeback. Both Mr Dalmiya and Mr Dutt have made notable contributions to the CAB. They should now step aside to allow new people and ideas to influence cricket in West Bengal. The parallels between the recall of Ganguly and Laxman, and the new-found friendship between Messrs Dalmiya and Dutt are striking. Both represent the beckoning of the past and not a reckoning with the future. They also reveal a particular mindset, which refuses to see anything except what is in the immediate future.

 Letters to Editor

 Little time left

 Sir The former president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, has been sentenced to death for his crimes against humanity (Saddam to hang but Bush on trial, Nov 6). Saddam may now be out of Americas way but those who have been following the developments in Iraq would agree that there are other problems that remain. For instance, the puppet Iraq government. The reins of the administration remain in the hands of the United States of America. One has to admit that Iraq was relatively more peaceful during Saddams reign and that matters have taken a turn for the worse since the war. The US and the allied powers had professed to restore democracy in Iraq. In reality, they have only unleashed widespread terror that has ravaged the nation. 

 Saddams trial, moreover, was far from a smooth affair, what with the killing of two defence lawyers, and the resignation of a judge. It would not be wrong to say that the trial had been unfair. In fact, the chief judge, Raouf Abdel Rahman, who pronounced the death sentence, is an ethnic Kurd, a sect that has traditionally opposed Saddam and his Sunni supporters. If Saddam has been sentenced to death for killing thousands of people, then a similar judgment should also be passed against George W. Bush who is guilty of the same crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir The death sentence against Saddam Hussein did not come as a surprise. But what needs to be asked is whether death by hanging is a fitting punishment for a tyrant. A better way of punishing the man would have been to keep him alive and torture him in the same manner that he had tormented those who had the misfortune to cross his path. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Bush administrations 

 fight against terrorism has at last tasted some success, 

 now that Saddam is set to go to the gallows. However, the 

 death of the dictator is unlikely to restore law and order 

 in Iraq. The death sentence can easily come back to haunt 

 the US since death invariably brings glory, especially in 

 these volatile times. It is possible that Saddam will be 

 hailed as a martyr by his supporters after his death. The 

 execution will surely raise the possibility of further bloodshed 

 in a country in which hundreds of people are becoming victims 

 of sectarian violence everyday. One will not be surprised 

 if the political condition in the Middle East worsens as 

 a result of the judgment passed on the former Iraqi president. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arup Roychoudhury, Bangalore 

 Sir Saddam Husseins fate has now been sealed. This should not come as a surprise as Saddam had always been a thorn in the USs side. Bush and the coalition forces have already devastated Iraq, one of Americas sworn enemies. And with Saddam set to die, one of the largest oil-producing countries in the world will now pass into the USs hands. Like all imperialist powers, the US is following a divide and rule policy in Iraq. Saddam is a Sunni Muslim. Hence his death would make the Shias happy, all the more so since Dujail, the village which was allegedly ravaged during Saddams rule, was a Shiite stronghold. The Shias should now rise above sectarian interests in order to get a clear perspective on the evil designs of America. Instead of celebrating, they should raise their voices against a country that is responsible for destroying their ancient land.

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The US has been calling Saddam Hussein a dictator. He has also been convicted of ordering the massacre of members of an entire village, which led the judges to pronounce the death sentence on him. Even if one were to accept all this for the sake of argument, a crucial question still remains unanswered. How is that America is silent about the warlords who are still happily ruling over countries in many parts of the world ? 

 The US has always found it convenient to deal with dictators who owe their allegiance to America. But Bush and his colleagues should realize that the death of a secular leader of the Muslim world will jeopardize their hold over west Asia. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shivaji K. Moitra, Kharagpur

 Sir The fact that Saddams Husseins trial has been rigged by the US is borne out by the fact that the death sentence was passed just two days before the mid-term elections in America. It is evident that George W. Bush was trying to enlist support for his Republican Party by self-righteously condemning a dictator to death. One hopes that people around the world will have the courage to stand up and protest against the machinations of the Bush administration. Hopefully, such an act would lead to a review of the death sentence.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Saddam Husseins death is a victory for Bush and Blair two men who have been plotting his eradication for a while now. But both leaders should know that this is not a time for resting on laurels. They should now work overtime to ensure that American and British interests are not compromised by Saddams death, an event which would have terrifying consequences for this part of the world.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Md. Mudassir Alam,New Delhi

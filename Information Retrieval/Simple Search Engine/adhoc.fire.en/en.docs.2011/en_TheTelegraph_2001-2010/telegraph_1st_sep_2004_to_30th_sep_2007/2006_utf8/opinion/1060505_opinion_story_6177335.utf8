 RULE OF THE CORRUPT 

 MALVIKA SINGH

 It is so predictable, so typical as a behaviour pattern when out of the blue, brutal killings take place as in Doda, just because there is a growing sense of peace and dignity. Byelections in Kashmir have shown that there is a growing faith in political solutions to the problem. Extremists find that they may well lose their sway over the state?s people, who have been battered over decades and who may well want no more of this kind of exploitation. The clock seems to be turning, new faith in peace processes seems to be more evident, and armed militants are feeling threatened by their possible isolation in the near future, which is why they are firing at innocents randomly. Little do they realize that the more they do of all this, the faster the people will revolt against them. Once the threshold of such protest is crossed, citizens tire of this violence, of killings, bloodshed and deep anguish. They want to be normal humans again. That is when democratic forces win out and are seen, even as hitherto failed governments, to be the better of the two evils, and this even though the Central minister for home affairs, dropped out of visiting Doda. Why? Is he fearful? The chief minister was there immediately, without fear.

 The other side is the madness of individuals shooting out of jealous pique. Pramod Mahajan was shot, at point blank range, by his younger brother. Speculation has been rife about why he did it. No one seems to be aghast about how ?shooting to kill? has become a virtual norm in urban India when polarized positions are taken, a normal way of dealing with a losing argument. It is sick. This escalation has to do with a failed law and order machine, one that is perceived to be corrupt and buyable, and therefore incompetent to take immediate action, forcing conviction of the criminal. 

 Role model

 Public reception is also that the authority is part of the nexus of criminality, that when authorities are ordered to find the criminals, they do, but otherwise they are ?compensated? to destroy evidence and drag their feet. This is the tragedy of modern India. It has made our lives sad and difficult, amoral and undignified, inhuman and devoid of ethics. This has been the single largest contribution of the governments of free and independent India to its people. Corruption and anarchy have been embedded in the earth of India by the political and administrative class. 

 The bits and pieces of civil society that show up periodically, are supported, conserved and nurtured by citizens, who in turn are protected by the Supreme Court because much of the lower court level is suspect too. Governance has failed the ordinary, nameless millions. In Gujarat this week, a dargah was demolished because it sat on a road. It had sat on that road long before the ?road? came to be. Riots erupted, people were killed, cars set on fire. Another case of failed administration. Once again communalism is rearing its head in Gujarat. Another shame for this subcontinent that has absorbed, over centuries, the best of all that came to its shores. This polarization that some political entities indulge in, based on neo-nationalism, is eating away at the fabric of a once great civilization. Will we ever regain our place on the planet of being a magnet for all those who want to attain peace and nirvana?

 In this new millennium, India is positioned to be a leader at the societal front. Our philosophies, faiths, communities, languages, traditions and cultures, respecting each other, can help set the parameters for sane and intelligent structures for countries across the world. We have, as a society, dealt with diverse layers and multiple levels, often despite insensitive governance, and have been able to keep the peace except in pockets ruled by extremism of one kind or another. If we lead in this realm, Indians will see the positive dimensions of our ?culture? and pride will weed out the negative.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 GENTLE WORDS

 The prime minister?s words on ?good road manners? are rather extraordinary in many ways. The ordinary Indian driver or pedestrian might well ask, as an initial response, ?But what would a prime minister know about road rage?? An Indian political leader is more often the unwitting creator of road rage than a concerned commentator on it. For the ordinary citizen, a VIP?s trail through the city ? with security cavalcade, siren and flashing lights ? is usually an occasion for annoying disruptions of traffic and a great deal else. Nobody, it would seem to such a citizen, could be more distant from the common man?s experience of transport and travel than an Indian prime minister. So it must have been an extraordinary act of the sympathetic imagination on the part of Mr Manmohan Singh to remind Indians to be well-mannered on the road while laying the foundation stone for the metro rail in Bangalore.

 The wider implications of what Mr Singh said are surely worth a serious thought. The importance of courtesy, and its relationship with economic and technological progress, are not matters that figure in Indian political discourse. That liberalization and politeness may be discussed in the same forum is, in itself, an idea that might infuse a somewhat novel order of civilized provocativeness into Indian political oratory. Civil behaviour ought to lie at the heart of a modern democratic polity and society. And this might solve many of its ongoing problems of aggression and intolerance. A few days before this, Mr Singh had talked about corruption and the land mafia to a Mumbai audience, and the political import of such a reminder is also worth pondering. The ordinary Indian would, quite rightly, resent being sermonized at on human values and good manners from most of the people who govern the country. But when an usually quiet prime minister comes up with something like this, it might be a little more than merely anodyne.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A hoax called terror 

Gwynne Dyer

?You?re allowed to lie for jihad. You?re allowed any 

technique to defeat your enemy,? Zacarias Moussaoui told the Virginia court room, 

trying to explain why he had changed his story about not being directly involved 

in the 9/11 plot. Now he wants to die a martyr, not rot in an American prison 

for the rest of his life. So now he claims that he and the pathetically incompetent 

British shoe-bomber, Richard Reid, were scheduled to fly a fifth hijacked plane 

into the White House on 11 September, 2001. That?s not what he said before, but 

you?re allowed to lie for jihad.

Moussaoui initially denied knowledge of the 9/11 plot, 

but subsequently signed a confession that he was the missing ?20th hijacker?. 

Then he repudiated his confession, explaining that it was only a joke, and now 

he has repudiated that repudiation, insisting that he was indeed part of the plot. 

You have to lie a lot for jihad.

The main reason Moussaoui keeps changing his story 

is that he is a seriously disturbed individual: his court appearances have been 

incoherent, abusive and even hysterical. To qualify for the death penalty, he 

must show that he had foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks and deliberately withheld 

it. Otherwise he wasn?t responsible for any deaths, and cannot be executed under 

US law.

Pulp fiction

Moussaoui?s testimony is worthless. Yet, his trial 

does tell us some important things about 9/11. It reminds us of the spectacular 

incompetence of the FBI: they did not seriously interrogate Moussaoui for almost 

a month after his arrest on immigration charges in August 2001, so he was under 

minimal pressure to spill the beans about 9/11. It also reminds us that the White 

House wasn?t paying attention to intelligence about terrorist threats, so focussed 

was it on building a case for invading Iraq.

Above all, it reminds us of what sad sacks the terrorists 

were. Over the past four and a half years, the Bush administration has constructed 

its entire foreign policy on a ?war against terror? which presupposes a serious 

opponent on the other side. The imagery is straight out of an old James Bond movie: 

super-villains in caves with plans for world conquest sending out legions of fanatical, 

high-tech Islamist terrorists to murder innocent Americans. The reality, as Moussaoui 

amply demonstrates, is a bit less impressive.

In an alternate universe where they had not come under 

the influence of Osama bin Laden, Moussaoui and his colleagues could have been 

the subjects of an Arabic-language sitcom about hopeless losers adrift in the 

West. The only reason they managed to pull off the 9/11 attacks, despite scattering 

clues around like confetti, was that nobody was looking. 

Not dark yet 

Nobody has been killed by terrorists in North America 

since 9/11, the longest completely terrorism-free period since the Sixties. And 

none of the terrorist attacks elsewhere during this time were at all innovative 

or high-tech. It?s back to truck-bombs and backpacks stuffed with explosives.

In all the terrorist attacks since 9/11 by people 

who are in some way linked with al-Qaeda and its various clones and affiliates, 

the total fatalities all around the world are well under a thousand people. Less 

than one person a day worldwide is being killed in so-called Islamist terrorist 

attacks. More people than that are dying of dogbites.

This is not a global crisis, however much President 

Bush strives to define it as such. From the start, the ?war on terror? has served 

as a cover for various plans for asserting US military and political hegemony 

around the world that were already on the agenda of the neo-conservatives for 

years. It has been one of the longest and most successful hoaxes in history, but 

the strategies that hide behind it are still doomed to end in failure.

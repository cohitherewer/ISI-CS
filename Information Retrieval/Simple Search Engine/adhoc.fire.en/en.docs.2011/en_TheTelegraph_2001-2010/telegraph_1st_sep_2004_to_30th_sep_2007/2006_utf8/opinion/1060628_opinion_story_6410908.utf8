 Poor thinking

 Sir ? In ?Who are the poor??, (June 21), Bibek Debroy quotes from Arun Shourie?s book and states that if the individual, and not the social group, is targeted by state development policies, it would put an end to the debate surrounding the issue of caste-based reservations. Debroy contends that families living below the poverty line should be identified and reservations made on that basis to solve the problem of poverty and backwardness. However questions remain about the efficacy of such a strategy. People belonging to the upper castes often get themselves false certificates concealing their caste to take advantage of the existent quota system. But it is easy to find out the truth in the case of a complaint as it is not impossible to ascertain the caste of an individual. But it may not be that easy to find out how poor or rich one is. After all, our income tax officials are forever chasing people who hide their true incomes to avoid paying tax. If the government decides to measure poverty levels of individuals in order to find out whether or not they should enjoy the benefits of reservations, it would surely heighten the chances of corruption as the not-really-poor with ?poor tags? will elbow out the really poor in most cases.

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Bibek Debroy makes a mistake when he says that the unorganized sector accounts for only 7 per cent of the total labour force. The 55th round of the National Sample Survey data (July 1999 ? June 2000) estimates that as much as 92 per cent of the total workforce in the country is in the unorganized sector. This is the figure that forms the basis of all the discussions on the subject concerned. If the author suspects the authenticity of the statistic, he could have stated his difference instead of misinforming the reader. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? While attempting to find out the causes of poverty, Bibek Debroy lists some of the main causes of deprivation in India. These include the lack of access to physical as well as social infrastructure like health, education, land, credit and so on. However, I am certain that these are not the causes but rather the effects of poverty. The progress or the degradation of a country depends upon its people. Poor nations such as Thailand and South Korea have made spectacular progress within a short time because of their people?s vision and determination to achieve progress. Indians, however, try to cover up their lack of initiative by putting the blame on corrupt politicians. The few who are serious about their duty towards the nation are too small in number to make a difference. As a result, the condition of India has remained unchanged even after nearly six decades of independence.

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The questions raised by Bibek Debroy remain relevant for a country such as ours. Politicians, bureaucrats and administrators earn millions in the name of undertaking poverty alleviation programmes. As a result, the condition of the poor are going from bad to worse. Unless something is done to root out corruption from our country, the condition of the poor will not improve. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Law and its loopholes

 Sir ? It is heartening to note that the Centre is planning to make changes in the Indian Penal Code and redefine the term rape to include cases of marital sex abuse (?Marital rape on draft bill radar?, June 24). However, it is doubtful whether such a measure will stop such crimes from taking place. The recent proliferation of rape cases throughout the country makes one wonder whether there is a need to adopt a different approach other than that of meting out stringent punishment to stop rapes from taking place. It would be a good idea to set up special cells, which will provide specialized medical and psychological help to the people suffering from the urge to commit rape. This might prevent rapes from taking place in the first place.

 However, there are other problems as well. The police seem hardly inclined to follow the rules regarding identification and arrest of the accused. Worse, justice is also slow in coming for the victim in most cases.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? Certain small but important measures can effectively bring down the number of rape cases in India. Speedy trials should be the order of the day while dealing with rape cases. It is often the case that the accused or the defence lawyer tries to hog the limelight even when the case is under way. This is inhuman and insensitive from the victim?s point of view. Care should be taken to ensure that no one exploits the situation for petty interest and personal gain. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Cup addiction 

 Sir ? Ever since the football World Cup started, the media have been covering the tournament as if there is nothing else to report. India does not play in the World Cup; then why this excitement over other nations fighting for a trophy? Indians would not dream of supporting other countries in cricket. But they come up with all kinds of excuses to support other nations when it comes to football. Most of the matches are being played late at night, forcing people to stay up late and watch the games.Their performance at work has suffered consequently. The soccer fever, I fear, has definitely taking a heavy toll on our lives.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Letters to Editor

 Out of control

 Sir The rampage carried out inside the Bidhan Sabha by members of the legislative assembly belonging to the Trinamool Congress will be counted as one of the most condemnable acts in the history of the house (Berserk in House, bandh outside, Nov 30). The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has reasons to be happy with the incident as it clearly exposes the true nature of the largest opposition party in the state. Even supporters of the Trinamool Congress will find it difficult to defend the behaviour of their partymen. If the opposition ever had a chance of stalling the land acquisition process at Singur, all such prospects now stand dashed after the mayhem at the legislative assembly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Mamata Banerjee has always been a source of irritation in West Bengal politics. Ever since her party failed to win the assembly elections, Banerjee had been trying to draw attention to herself by resorting to all kinds of unacceptable behaviour. The act of vandalism carried out by her party members in the state assembly is yet another reminder of this fact. If members of the Trinamool Congress had really wanted their point to be made, they should have resorted to a more civilized way of protest. 

 Further, the bandh called by Banerjee the next day was even more absurd. The Trinamool chief stated that she was forced to call the bandh after the police stopped her from reaching Singur. Is this reason enough to call a bandh? Banerjees reasoning is yet another evidence of her political immaturity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The manner in which members of the Trinamool Congress vandalized the Bidhan Sabha, is unforgivable. This kind of despicable behaviour shows that the party does not have any respect for institutions and ideals of democracy. Will Mamata Banerjee ever realize that her whimsical attitude would get her nowhere, as is already evident from the dwindling support base of her party? Taking recourse to disruptive manoeuvres will make Banerjee and her party even more unpopular in the eyes of the voter. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir When legislators, who are supposed to be law-makers, break them instead, then the result is chaos of the kind that was recently witnessed in the Bidhan Sabha. There is no doubt about the fact that Mamata Banerjee and her partymen are to be blamed for the bedlam that took place in the legislature. But this does not mean that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party have been entirely blameless in their conduct over the Singur issue. 

 The overwhelming majority achieved by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bengal in the last assembly elections has made Bhattacharjee overconfident. It has led him to believe that he can enforce any decision on the people of the state and on his political opponents. So much so that he is now adamant about handing over precious agricultural land to the Tatas simply because the latter is keen to build a car factory in that area. Bhattacharjee could have reasoned with the Tatas and provided them with an alternative site. He should have also been more transparent in his dealings and asked the opposition to be a part of the discussion with the Tatas. 

 But, then, the chief minister did none of this, which compelled the opposition to organize a show of strength inside the premises of the Bidhan Sabha. The incident at the assembly was a pointer to the growing frustration in the minds of the opposition leaders. And the chief minister should also share a part of the blame for the flare-up. Bhattacharjee should have defused the tension that was building up over months instead of pointing fingers at the culprits after the incident took place. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir The atrocities committed by the police in Singur pale in comparison to the conduct of the Trinamool MLAs. The members of the opposition broke furniture in the assembly. But the police destroyed property and beat up hapless villagers after dragging them out of their homes in Singur. Have the communists forgotten the ideals that they are supposed to follow? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee dismissed the police action as retaliation to trouble created by outsiders. But the nature of the injuries suffered by the poor villagers tells a story that is completely different from what Bhattacharjee has said. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Das, Panihati

 Sir The controversy over the takeover of agricultural land in Singur has continued for too long and is now getting out of hand. If the Tatas still go forward with their plans, then they should be ready to face a backlash from irate villagers. Perhaps, it would be better if the Tatas decided to make a fresh start elsewhere. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dev Gupta, Scottsdale, US

 Sir The editorial, Violence And Democracy (Dec 3), takes a rather one-sided view of the recent political events in Bengal. It is true that the conduct of Trinamool MLAs deserve to be censured. But members of the ruling party have also resorted to similar disruptive tactics when they were in the opposition. This should make Bhattacharjee stop and think before deciding to adopt a holier-than-thou attitude before the people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debasish Chatterjee, Calcutta

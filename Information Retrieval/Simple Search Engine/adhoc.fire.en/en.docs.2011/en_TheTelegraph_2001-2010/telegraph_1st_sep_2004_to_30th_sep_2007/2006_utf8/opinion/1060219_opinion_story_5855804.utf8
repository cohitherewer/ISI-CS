 Letters to Editor

 A coach of their own

 Sir ? The February 16 notice about the splitting of the ladies? coach to have one for each end of local trains in the Sealdah division, is surprising. Why should a compartment be reserved for women in a society where they now work alongside men in cramped offices? Besides, there is no guarantee that all commuting women will use the reserved compartment. Plenty of them seldom do. Carrying on with the policy of reservation will only widen the gender divide rather than closing it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Under Bush fire

 Sir ? I was aghast but not altogether surprised at the protest of the US ambassador, David Mulford, against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s alleged reference to George W. Bush as the leader of an ?organized pack of killers? (?Mulford missive fire?, Feb 11). What the West Bengal chief minister has said is true, but the truth is often unpalatable to those it talks about. People all over the world, including most in the United States of America, would say the same thing if they were allowed to speak their mind. Bhattacharjee has in fact been extremely kind to the US president, for he did not say that Bush is a bully who uses power to force nations into submission and has prospered with the help of illegal deals. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, has made a career out of throwing insults at Bush, but the US ambassador to the United Kingdom, unlike Mulford, never criticizes Livingstone publicly. This is perhaps because it is much easier to browbeat a third world chief minister into apologizing than to stir a hornet?s nest by protesting against the opinions of a leader of another powerful nation. Mulford is said to have made cheap threats regarding prospective US investment in West Bengal following Bhattacharjee?s comment. Let the US know that Bengal can do very well without its help. The people of the state would happily live without US burgers, doughnuts and Bible bashers sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency. 

 Yours faithfully

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s remarks about George Bush was totally out of place at the Brigade rally, which was meant to be a prelude to the campaign for the state assembly election. The participants at the rally were more interested in the chief minister?s views on health, education, roads, electricity and other infrastructural facilities in their villages, towns and cities. The US is not a presence in their lives. Bhattacharjee, while addressing rallies in future, had better limit himself to the achievements of his government. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? A diplomat is not supposed to meddle in the internal affairs of the country of his posting (?Mulford letter annoys govt? Feb 12). The opinion of the chief minister of an Indian state cannot possibly hurt a mighty nation like the US, especially since the comment was not made at any international forum, where the prestige of the two countries may be at stake. The Centre should take appropriate diplomatic action against the envoy.

 Yours faithfully,

Guru Shankar GS, Agarpara

 Sir ? Will Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee now stop wooing US investors to his state since he believes the Americans are an organized pack of killers? Just like his party, which keeps barking around to terrorize people without daring to bite, Bhattacharjee makes statements like this just because he has to say something. It does not become the leftist leaders to indulge in such cheap publicity.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Ranganathan, Calcutta

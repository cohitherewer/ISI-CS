 NOT TO CARE

 The worst crimes are committed when the carers do not care. People like Mr Govind Sarda are not hard to come by in a corrupt society driven by greed and deprivation. But they flourish in a state like West Bengal because of an entire system made up of relatively innocent people, the exact nature of whose culpability in situations like the latest blood scam is conveniently overlooked by the official inquirers. A whole chain of guilt and responsibility links the person who tampered with the expiry dates of the blood-test kits and the unsuspecting people who ended up with terminal illnesses as a result of this tampering. And this chain connects the highest to the lowest from the state health minister, Mr Surya Kanta Mishra, as slippery and silent now as he is on every issue of the gravest accountability in the health sector (and just as silently covered by his seniors in office), to those numerous technicians who tested sample after sample of blood, year after year, without bothering to check the expiry dates. 

 The chain of accountability also implicates crucial public health organizations like the West Bengal AIDS Prevention Society, which acquired the faulty kits on some sort of peculiar good faith, again without checking their expiry dates, together with the heads of important hospitals and blood banks, who routinely recruit inadequately trained and fundamentally unscrupulous laboratory technicians and put them in charge of something as crucial as testing blood samples for HIV and hepatitis. This systemic lack of scruple is the most shocking and frightening thing a state of brutal uncaring that tries to pass itself off, under pressure, as charmingly unsuspecting carelessness, as good faith. For such systems of criminal negligence, the existence of people like Mr Sarda is terribly convenient, and at several levels. Not only do the Govind Sardas of this world supply, quite literally, the stuff for such crime, but they also become scapegoat figures for a collective inhumanity, the thorough uncovering of which would endanger too many heads in too many high places.

 STANDING TOGETHER IN TIMES OF TROUBLE

 If there were no riots after the blasts in Malegaon, it was because the population had not been divided on communal lines, writes Jyoti Punwani

 Help in hand

 Defying all expectations, there was no riot in Malegaon, despite the bomb blasts which killed 38 Muslims who had gathered to pray. In 2001, a state reserve police constable snatched an Urdu leaflet from a Muslim outside a mosque after namaz and, within minutes, sparked off a riot which resulted in the death of 13 persons and the loss of property worth crores not just in Malegaon but also in its adjoining villages. This time too, the simultaneous blasts took place in the town after prayers on a Friday. On the earlier occasion, elections to the municipal council were just months away; the same situation holds good today.

 Why did Malegaon not erupt on this particular occasion? The answer lies in what commissions of inquiry into riots have been telling us for a long time: that riots dont just happen, they are the outcome of the building up of communal tension over a long period of time.

 In 2001, Muslims and Hindus were inundated with hate-filled propaganda for months before the clash took place. The Bajrang Dal had begun its long campaign which was to culminate in March 2002, in Ayodhya, where reconstruction of the Ram temple on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid was to start. The thrust of the campaign, aimed at recruiting fresh volunteers from villages, was that Hindus had to fight a dharamyudh against Islamic and Christian terrorism by joining the Ayodhya movement. In the campaign, mosques were described as storehouses of arms.

 This propaganda made Maharashtras predominantly Hindu villagers suspicious of the bearded, topi-kurta-pyjama-clad Tableeghi Jamaat preachers, who had been visiting villages for the past 15 years as part of their mission to teach Islam to Muslims.

 Muslims have for years coexisted peacefully with Hindus in these villages, participating in their festivals and cultural activities, while attending namaz in the local mosque.

 Under the influence of the Tableeghi Jamaat, a few of them became born-again Muslims in every village, both in appearance as well as in conduct: they started sporting beards and caps, stopped accepting prasad and participating in jatras, preferring instead to spend time constructing mosques that were being financed by Malegaons Jamaats. Significantly, till then, the Tableeghis had faced no hostility; in fact, local Hindus used to point out Muslim neighbours to them, saying : Here, take him, he never offers namaz.

 But all through 2001, Maharashtras villages saw violent incidents, which culminated in attacks against these outsiders. Two months before riots broke out at Malegaon, Tableeghi Jamaat preachers had been assaulted in a nearby village. The same thing happened during riots in another village. The local doctor refused to treat the bleeding Tableeghis, and the sarpanch and police asked them to leave, saying: Why do you come here? Our village has got a bad name because of you. 

 Complimenting the Bajrang Dal was the Shiv Sena and a breakaway group called Jaanta Raja, which communalized every private dispute between Hindus and Muslims in the villages around Malegaon. 

 Waiting to take advantage of these incidents was Nihal Ahmed, president of the Janata Dal (S). A Lohiaite, the khadi-clad Ahmed had been the towns MLA for more than two decades. His chief contribution to the town has been the regularization of slums and the issuing of ration cards to slum dwellers. Despite his political ideology, he had done nothing to change the living conditions of Malegaons Muslim majority. Not surprisingly, in 1999, the voters had elected the Congress candidate, Shaikh Rashid.

 From then onwards, desperate to regain his base, Ahmed had begun a cynical exploitation of Muslim sentiment. In the weeks before the 2001 riots, Ahmed had addressed public meetings of Muslims on the communal incidents taking place in the adjoining villages, ridiculing the Congress legislature (who had downplayed them) for having sold out to the Hindus. A month after 9/11, he led an all-Muslim morcha ignoring the advice of the Hindu councillors of the party against the American invasion of Afghanistan. Flanking him were youth carrying portraits of Osama bin Laden. This visual made television headlines in and around Malegaon.

 The clash between the Muslim youth and the SRP constable took place a week after this morcha. The lathi-charge that followed inflamed the Muslims who ran out to attack a Hindu shop; but the simultaneous attacks on Muslim properties on the other side of the town, and the swiftness with which the violence spread all over, indicated that the riot wasnt entirely spontaneous.

 This time, there has been no such build up. Malegaons municipal council is now a corporation. Jaanta Raja chief, Dada Bhuse, accused of murder in the 2001 riots, is now a Sena legislator; many of those who lost mills and godowns in 2001 are corporators.

 When the blasts took place on September 8, Muslims did attack the few policemen they saw. But immediately, local elders, especially Mufti Mohammad Ismail of the Jama Masjid, came out to calm them. There was no immediate lathi-charge to aggravate the situation. Neither was there a known enemy in sight. 

 As Muslims rushed their injured to hospitals in the Hindu area, they saw Hindus clearing the roads, lining up to donate blood, and even getting medicines for them. Foremost among these was Dada Bhuse.

 Where was Nihal Ahmed, who had become Malegaons first mayor? True to type, he did nothing to help. At a meeting with the administration, Ahmed declared that he had informed the police that the blasts would take place. A week after the blasts, he observed Black Friday, taking out a rally with the few supporters he still has. Coincidentally, JD (S) president, H.D. Deve Gowda, visited Malegaon on that very day.

 After 2001, the Samajwadi Party became a force in the town. The state president, Abu Asim Azmi, rushed to Malegaon after the blasts, and criticized the police for their failure to provide security. He also warned against indiscriminate arrests of Muslims.

 The Congress-NCP government also played their usual role doling out relief. The same government has refused to table the report prepared by the K.N. Patil Commission of Inquiry, which was set up after the riots in 2001. That report had been submitted two years ago. One factor investigated by the judge was the role of the police in that particular incident. Of the 13 killed in the violence, only one was a Hindu (a Shiv Sainik killed by a mob). Four Muslims were killed by Hindu mobs, and eight died due to police firing. The police had not fired at the Hindu rioters.

 This time, after the blasts, most politicians acted with care. But it was the ordinary residents of Malegaon who surprised everyone. Special mention must be made of the four Muslims who returned the rupees one lakh relief cheques to Sonia Gandhi, and instead offered to donate rupees 10 lakh if the towns long-standing demand of a proper hospital was fulfilled. If preparations for the hospital are now on full swing, its due to them, say the residents.

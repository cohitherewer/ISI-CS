The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 INDIA HAS HAD ENOUGH

Malvika Singh

 Much has been said about Sonia Gandhi over the last week. She did what she believed was right. She also put an immediate stop to the high-pitched tirade orchestrated by the BJP leadership. She exposed the poisonous double standards mushrooming in the political space. A signature on a letter of resignation, and the farce was over. You put in your papers if you have nothing to lose, nothing to hide. Unfortunately, international correspondents who have not bothered to comprehend the complex Indian mind, who have more often than not got Indian politics wrong, presented one of the most warped interpretations of the events. They too damned Sonia Gandhi and heralded her decline. The Indian press were plain stumped, having forgotten how to react to simple acts of probity and appropriate actions, so used to convoluted stances.

 The Opposition managed to reiterate their lack of the ability to address and fight for real issues that affect the vast majority and not merely the few in politics. It is always good for the Congress, itself a moribund party at this moment in its history, to have the BJP rave and rant and prioritize endless non-issues as their hatred for Sonia pours out into the streets. India rejects this outpouring of venom. Such hysterical behaviour gives the Congress an upper hand in the eyes of the aam aadmi despite the fact that most of the fossils in the Congress are relentlessly betraying their top leadership and the party by continuing their corrupt practices, by playing one against the other, and by using their well-honed skills of lazy sycophancy, an old dying trick, to survive. The only difference is that at the helm of the Congress on the one hand, and leading the government on the other, are Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh, both of whom represent and emanate integrity, dignity and probity in public space as well as a deep respect for and adherence to secular pluralism. They never descend to the abysmal level of abusive, unwarranted public political behaviour. The majority trust them.

 In a time warp

 It is that basic trust which will bolster the Congress for a short while longer. If the party continues to wallow much like a fat water-buffalo in a mired pool, with unwarranted confidence and complacency, they will have lost yet another historic opportunity to consolidate. It is time for those at the helm to wield a whip and force party leaders and members to deliver and be accountable. Those who defy the work ethic must be summarily purged to allow for a new cadre. India has had enough. This country is frustrated by decades of failed leadership and an exploitation of goodwill, patience and decency. It is becoming increasingly clear that regional parties will garner support in the states, in their linguistic and cultural spaces and the voting patterns will be based on local issues and specific needs. 

 India will soon be sixty years of age, a matured nation state. It probably recognizes the need for a two party system, to use a clich?, at the Centre, only to protect the defence, fiscal and foreign policy needs of the country. To have coalition parties pulling in all directions on all issues can only set this nation back in a fast-moving world with new aspirations and more dynamic tools to achieve them. Living in a time warp, carrying the baggage of a failed ideology where the poor have remained poor will not be acceptable to a generation that is raring to go. States should be encouraged to compete with one another. Development will most definitely ensue. Sonia Gandhi could well take the risk of asking the people for a fresh and secure mandate, preferably within the year, that would enable her to break loose from the constraints of the UPA coalition and win because she worked for Bharat, ensuring Manmohan Singh deliver for India.

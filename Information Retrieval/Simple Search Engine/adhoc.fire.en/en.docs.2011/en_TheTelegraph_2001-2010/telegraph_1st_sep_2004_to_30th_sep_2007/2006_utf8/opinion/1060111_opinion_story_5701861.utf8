 Ringing true

 Sir ? Political leaders, who feel that their popularity is on the wane, are conveniently using the phone tapping allegation to come back to centre stage (?Amar reels out tape tirade?, Jan 7). This, however, is likely to prove a futile endeavour. A bunch of people, frequently caught on camera extracting illegal remuneration for what is supposed to be their constitutional obligation, cannot use this moral rhetoric to fool people. Even if the people were to believe these men were speaking the truth, they would have much to thank phone-tapping for. It, after all, exposed a lot of wrongdoers. And, for a long time to come, the possibility of being tapped will continue to scare the men who use their telephones to seal their deals, and that too with taxpayers? money. If, as Amar Singh would have us believe, he has nothing to be embarrassed about his telephone conversations, why make such a noise and drag the matter to the highest court of the country?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Subhankar Mukherjee, Borehat 

 Sir ? After Amar Singh?s allegations of phone-tapping, a host of politicians like J. Jayalalithaa, N. Chandrababu Naidu and L.K. Advani have joined in the fray. Several apparently want a team of three chief ministers, consisting of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Nitish Kumar and Jayalalithaa to hold an inquiry. But if Jayalalithaa is also screaming from the rooftops about phone-tapping, how will she hold an impartial inquiry? Also, is it likely that the phone-tapping issue will help in political realignments for the next elections?

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The phone-tapping incident detected by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, and endorsed by the Tamil Nadu chief minister, J. Jayalalithaa, involving the ruling Congress party at the Centre is nothing unusual or new. Ruling parties in India assume that they have a god-given right to tap the telephones of their adversaries and thereby blackmail people?s representatives. When one party replaces another, it does exactly the same. The media are aware of this unconstitutional behaviour. The sting operations conducted by the media get legitimacy because of the corruption in the higher echelons of governance. The main question is whether anyone has the legal right to hear and watch what others do privately. Needless to say, such activities do encourage crime, terrorism and other anti-social activities in the country. Perhaps Mulayam Singh Yadav should stand up for people?s right to privacy instead of fighting a political battle against the Centre. The public has the right to know if the government at the Centre is at fault.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Abdulruff Colachal, New Delhi 

 Sir ? Amar Singh?s statements about the phone-tapping issue must not be taken lightly. It raises a debatable question. How much privacy does a member of parliament enjoy and does he have the right to socialize and entertain himself? One cannot charge an MP for showing interest in entertainment-related events, especially someone as close to Bollywood as Amar Singh has been. Singh is rightly in pointing out that he is not a pracharak and that he has the right to entertain himself and to speak freely, so long as he is not responsible for creating communal unrest in the country. The demand made by Lalu Prasad to make the tapes available to the public is unjustified. Would he have similarly argued for his conversations with his wife on the phone to be made public? It is not Singh who should be questioned, but the people who invaded his privacy and why. If there is no political reason behind the act, then we might conclude that the virus of sting operation is spreading fast and is possibly taking a dangerous shape in this country.

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? The reaction of the Congress leader, Ambika Soni, to the phone-tapping charge is surprising. Does she mean to say that if one has no secrets to worry about, one should not bother if one?s phone is tapped? Scandals have been unfolding with alarming regularity. First came the Mitrokhin allegations, then the Volcker report, then the cash-for-questions scam, then the MP?s local area development fund scandal. And now the phone-tapping issue. Amar Singh?s complaint is not a new allegation. But it is a serious problem which requires thorough investigation. Phone tapping, except in matters of national security, is unconstitutional and should not be allowed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? A telephone company?s lineman can tap a landline connection just by connecting the instrument to the overhead telephone line. Now with the advancement of technology cordless telephones and mobile phones can be tapped from the respective exchanges. Although the Indian legislation has very strict guidelines for tapping telephones, what can be done if a telephone is privately tapped by an employee of the service provider without the knowledge of the company or the police against a hefty bribe? It is bewildering that a telephone can be tapped only in the interest of public safety and the nation. But the security of the nation is itself in danger if petty criminals can tap a telephone so easily. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 PAINTINGS IN PROSE

 What lies frozen in time

 Hang-Ups: Essays on Paintings 

 (Mostly)

 By Simon Schama, BBC, pound; 12.99

 It is difficult to ignore anything 

 that Simon Schama writes. His prose scintillates. This book 

 of essays on art begins with the following sentence: ?Art 

 begins with resistance to loss.? He explicates this with 

 the suggestion that art is driven, principally, by the yearning 

 to capture the fleeting vision and sensation before routine, 

 time and distance dull them.

 The essays not only have many similar brilliantly constructed but profound sentences, they are also underpinned by a particular philosophical approach to art. This runs against the common notion that art not only imitates life but seeks to replace it. Schama?s position is that art replaces reality instead of reproducing it. The greatest works of art are, indeed, announcements of a failure to duplicate the world. The world is constantly changing and art fails to arrest this mutability. The turn of the head of Vermeer?s turbaned girl with the pearl earrings continues to enchant because we are only too conscious that in life she can at anytime turn away her head but in the painting she cannot, she is frozen forever in time.

 Schama further argues that great paintings are haunted by their own instability. There is inevitably and irrevocably an ?unbridgeable distance between technical bravura and the world it ostensibly doubles.? He elaborates, ?It is precisely the unattainable serenity of Vermeer?s Delft, fictitiously repaired as a civic paradise from the blackened ruins of its gunpowder explosion, which makes it lodge in our imagination. The Delft is forever barred to us, not just by a breadth of water and an array of towers, gates and walls, but by the distance between a shimmering vision projected on a back wall by a camera obscura, and the mundane reality of a small provincial Dutch town past its prime. The image cast by the lens on the wall is sharp but trapped in the unforgiving brilliance of a dream. It is also upside down.?

 Yet, as Schama admits, part of art?s allure lies in the alternative existence that it so tantalizingly offers: ?a fictitious world in which the sprawling tangle of existence has been tidied, its chaos drilled into shape; its patches of raw ugliness edited; its hang-ups well and truly hung-up.? Art, Schama says provocatively, is ?life under New Management? that seeks to manage the resident conventions of picturing: coherence, harmony, tonal balance.

 Guided by this set of beliefs about art, Schama looks at, in separate essays, some of the paintings of Rembrandt, Vermeer, Hogarth, Cezanne, Mondrian and some contemporary painters. The essays are polished and witty. This is certainly not art history nor is it art criticism at its most profound, but it is by far the best attempt to make high art accessible to the populace.

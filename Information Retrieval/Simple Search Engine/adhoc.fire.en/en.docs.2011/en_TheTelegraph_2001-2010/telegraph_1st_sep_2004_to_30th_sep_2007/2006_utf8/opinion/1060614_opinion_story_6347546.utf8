 IN ITS OWN MESS

 While an increase in global crude oil prices should be transmitted in the form of increases in domestic petroleum product prices, the Centre has itself to blame for the economic and political mess it has got into. For a start, the administered price mechanism has never been completely disbanded and there is lack of transparency in how crude prices are linked to petroleum product prices. That apart, increases in product prices have been continuously postponed. Consequently, when the increases of Rs 4 per litre for petrol and Rs 2 per litre for diesel were announced, they seemed like large shocks and there has been little attempt to target petroleum-product subsidies also, relevant for both LPG and kerosene. In addition, the Centre must have been happy enough at the increase in global crude prices, because of its revenue (customs and excise) implications. The big-ticket expenditure items of the United Progressive Alliance government would have been impossible had crude prices been $20 a barrel. But having faced pressure from oil companies and having increased petrol and diesel prices, the Centre must have been worried about inflation, with the wholesale price index inching up. Agro product prices have increased and any petroleum-product hike eventually stokes the manufacturing component of inflation.

 Retail prices are functions of state-level sales tax, and these are highest in states like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and West Bengal. Since sales tax is ad valorem, there is the implication of greater tax revenue. For instance, West Bengal has 27.78 per cent sales tax on petrol and 20.73 per cent on diesel, and per litre, petrol will therefore fetch an additional 77 paise, while diesel will fetch 36 paise, as a result of the price hike. It is worth mentioning that buoyant sales tax revenue in recent months has largely been because of this petroleum effect. Had the so-called Maharashtra model of reducing sales tax to cushion consumers been a voluntary one, one could have objected less, although the Nationalist Congress Party is now reluctant. But the petroleum minister?s exhortation to states sounded more like a command, with neither economic nor moral backing. It is not surprising that a quid pro quo has now been established between states reducing sales tax and a rollback in price hikes, with both the left and the National Democratic Alliance fishing in troubled waters, not to speak of other opposition parties. This is a sad commentary on the state of fiscal reform, where both Central and state finances and attainment of fiscal targets become functions of one single product. Why, if there is a value-added tax, is petroleum treated differently?

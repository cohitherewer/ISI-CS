 DIARY

 Will the great Indian gambit of filling the impermanent but most important seat in the UN succeed? A senior minister in the UPA government says no. The ailing man in fact is beside himself with grief at India?s having lost the chance of sending its best man to the secretary-general?s post. The minister, who prides himself as a patron of art and literature, says that he bears no grudge against the civil servant and writer, Shashi Tharoor. But Tharoor, he believes, lacks the stature that would make him a readily acceptable face on the world stage. Who then does the minister have in mind? He gives us no names, but the more politically aware know that he is pointing to an academic-turned-bureaucrat-turned-politician who has the best CV in New Delhi. Pity that nobody thought of considering the good doctor for the prized UN post, our minister rues. And now it is too late. But wait, maybe not!

 Rahul Mahajan?s fall from grace has been more than a bit of a bother for the BJP, especially given the fact that discussions on his entry into the party were still going on. Given the continuing saga, it could not have been a mere coincidence that the party president, Rajnath Singh, felicitated 50 wrestlers and sportspersons in New Delhi recently, complimenting them on their discipline and fitness. The bronze demigods were on display at the party office, and evoked quite a sharp contrast with the memory of Rahul being carried out of the courtroom. ?A healthy body leads to a healthy mind,? said Singh, ?I believe one should take care of one?s body.? Strong words, but did they hit where they were supposed to?

 Stargazing should be an unlikely habit with election commissioners, especially their chief. But a course in astrology at a private institute near JNU campus in the capital and the approaching final examinations on July 3 must make it incumbent on the new CEC, N Gopalaswami. These days, the man is said to be often spotted wearing a long tilak on his forehead and scribbling planetary charts. The question is, would Gopalaswami have persevered so much had he been less sure that the skills would come in handy in his latest assignment?

 Where there is a will, there is usually a way. But not always. Mani Shankar Aiyar still remains committed to panchayati raj, but there are other factors which have slowed down his work in that sector. When the minister lately expressed his desire to tour the remote areas of Madhya Pradesh to assess the impact of his pet project among the Baiga tribals, the MP CM, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, promptly agreed to play host. But then Mani made a request for an uran khatola to visit the areas. The quality of roads, which has got nowhere since the time the BJP took over, seems to be the cause. At his age, Mani is unwilling to undertake the back-breaking journey on MP?s roads. And not even his love for tribals can change his mind.

 The jury is still out on it, but the predominant view in the PMO is veering round to appointing our man in Islamabad, Shiv Shankar Menon, as the next foreign secretary after Shyam Saran retires later this year. Saran is likely to be drafted in the PMO as an adviser on external affairs to the PM. At one stage, the name of Ronen Sen, India?s ambassador to the US, had been proposed, but was seemingly scrapped. Sen may get an extension in Washington while the baton passes to Menon.

 There is a man behind every successful man. Behind Pramod Mahajan there was Bibek Moitra, who once acted gatekeeper to the supreme boss. LK Advani?s PA, Deepak Chopra supposedly decides who has access to Advani. Rajiv Gandhi?s personal secretary, Vincent George, is reputed to have often anticipated his boss?s needs even before they were articulated. Another such man is RK Mriglani, secretary to Kamal Nath. Together, they hold the key to success.

 There were some 60 mobiles stolen during the NDA dharna against the fuel price hike. Supporters reportedly were heard saying that they picked up phones because they were not paid the amount they were promised for joining the dharna. 

 As Brinda Karat must have realized by now, Ramdev may be a semi-literate, but he has already become an icon through his barter of yoga and indigenous medicine. His camps in various north Indian towns draws an enormous crowd (although entry is not free), in front of which he mixes his yoga lessons with homilies on ?clean living?. Ramdev?s prescriptions seem to have benefited more people other than the target crowd. Now even thieves swear by him. Here is why. During his week-long camp in Gurgaon recently, there was a marked increase in incidents of burglaries. A leading lawyer found his house ransacked while he was imbibing lessons at the feet of Ramdev. On comparing notes with others who had attended, he was horrified to learn that at least five others in his sector had had their houses broken into while they were at the camp. Clearly, burglars knew that it was alright to get their hands on some worldly goods while the masters of the house gained their spiritual wealth.

 GUNS DOWN

 Democratic power does not flow from the barrel of a gun. The guns, therefore, have to fall silent before democracy can return to Nepal. It was a matter of time before both the new government in Kathmandu and the Maoist rebels accepted this. But their acceptance of the United Nations role in managing the weapons of both the Nepali army and the Maoist guerrillas is only a first step towards the emerging democratic process. How successfully the UN team manages the arms will determine if the subsequent elections in Nepal can be free and fair. A decade of the Maoist rebellion has eroded the authority of the government in Kathmandu in most parts of the country. Worse, it has created a gun culture that has penetrated the remotest parts of the mountainous country. Gun-wielding Maoists banished not only the governmental authority but also democratic politics from their areas of influence. The success of the UNs weapons management team will, therefore, depend primarily on the Maoists cooperation. It would be far easier to manage the weapons at the Nepali armys barracks than those in the hideouts of the guerrillas. The Maoists have agreed to the UNs job in Nepal; they now have to prove the sincerity of their commitment to democracy by helping the UN team. 

 There would be other things, though, that the government and the Maoists have to do in the run-up to the elections. It is possible that there would be differences along the way. The role or even the existence of the monarchy could be a major area of disagreement. The interim government and the draft of a new constitution are also possible bones of contention. The hints of such discords were evident in the Maoists demand for the dissolution of parliament. The rebels also resented the suggestion by the prime minister, Mr Girija Prasad Koirala, that there should be some space for the monarchy in Nepals new democracy. The important thing, however, is to ensure that the fear of weapons does not overshadow the dialogue. It should be a hopeful sign that the UN team has a mandate that goes far beyond the management of weapons. It is almost certain that the UN will respond positively to the request by both sides to appoint observers to oversee the conduct of the elections. The UNs success in Nepal can have its impact on peace missions elsewhere in the region, especially Sri Lanka.

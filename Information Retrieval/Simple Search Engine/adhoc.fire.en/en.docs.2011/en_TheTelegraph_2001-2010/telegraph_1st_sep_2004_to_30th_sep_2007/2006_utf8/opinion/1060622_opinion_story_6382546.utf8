 MODES OF ACTION

 How does one take action against the police? Among various mundane possibilities, there are two that demand special attention: a reprimand from the chief minister, and a slap from a furious citizen. There is, of course, the easiest resolution of all ? the bribe. All three have been in the news recently in West Bengal, and expose different facets of the relationships among the police, ordinary (and less than ordinary) citizens and political leaders. First, the slap ? or rather, the alleged slap. A curious indeterminacy dogs the situation. Ms Sonia Karwalia was knocked down from her scooter and almost killed by a speeding bus. When she went immediately afterwards to a traffic constable standing nearby, he rudely refused to take down the number of the bus. She then claims to have slapped the constable in rage. Technically, she could be arrested for assaulting an officer on duty. But for some reason, the constable has no memory of being slapped by her. This absurdist twist in the tale does not take away from the glee most Calcuttans would feel at Karwalia?s alleged ?offence?. Both the rage and the glee are significant, and should figure in the chief minister?s reflections on the matter. 

 There are less empowered or more helplessly distressed women who regularly face more brutal indifference and even harassment when they go for help to a police station, rural or urban. Social inequality is at its crudest in police stations. Nothing works better than wealth and influence. Bribing, the commonest form of corruption with the police, is the most blatant form taken by the power of money, although for the truck-drivers who have to pay the bribe, empowerment is certainly not the predominant feeling. The elaborately organized mechanism of extortion, involving a large section of the police hierarchy, that has been evolved over the years is a model of institutionalized corruption. There seems to be a system of cards and stamps that indicates to officers on duty the status of drivers with regard to the paying of bribes. This is not only a question of corruption, but also of numerous fatalities on the roads, from trucks knocking people down while speeding away from extorting constables. Slaps and more formal reprimands can only be crisis measures. A greater system of internal vigilance, and a more unsparing citizenry would go a long way towards making such extreme measures unnecessary.

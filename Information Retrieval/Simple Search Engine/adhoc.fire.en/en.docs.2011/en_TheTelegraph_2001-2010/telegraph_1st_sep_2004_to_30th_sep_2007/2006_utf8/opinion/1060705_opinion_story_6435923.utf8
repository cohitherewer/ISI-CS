 NEGLECT AND APATHY

Gyan Pathak

 Unseen and unheard, almost 7 to 10 per cent of India?s population lives in the worst conditions possible. These are the denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes which number around 500 but are not enumerated separately in the census. Development has snatched away their traditional jobs like snake-charming, acrobatics, puppetry, hunting, fortune-telling, healing and so on. They are landless, homeless and practically illiterate. They have no voting rights, caste certificates, ration cards and below-poverty-line certificates. Most of them are not even classified as scheduled tribes, scheduled castes or socially and educationally backward classes. These people came into focus recently when the National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes sought appropriate monetary provisions in the next five year plan, together with territorial rights for them. 

 Rehabilitation of these tribes has always been a challenge for our planners, mainly because they are wandering communities. But this is also because they carry the stigma of being categorized as ?criminals? as per the British India government enacted Criminal Tribes Act 1871. The government of India repealed the act in 1952, but the stigma continues to haunt them. 

 Criminal tribes

 In September 2003, the ministry of social justice and empowerment decided to set up a national commission in order to bring these people into the mainstream. The commission was given a brief to identify these communities, study their problems and recommend to the government specific interventions required for their overall development.

 The commission observed in its report that the denotified tribes or communities had been wrongly stigmatized as crime-prone and subjected to high-handed treatment and exploitation by the representatives of law and order as well as by society. It also noted that the special approach to their development had been delineated in the reports of the working groups for the development of STs, SCs and backward classes in successive plans and annual reports. The ministry of social justice and empowerment and the ministry of tribal affairs were asked to collate all this material to chalk out programmes for the socio-economic and educational development of these people, to promote employment generation and social liberation for them. 

 The wanderers

 To these communities, called the khanabadoshes, wandering is a way of life. The most numerous among them are the Koravans. Then there are the Gadia Lohars, Gujjars, Kalbeliajogis, Kanjars, Sansis and so on. The advisory committee on the revision of the lists of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, 1965, had observed, ?We are inclined to feel that it would be in the best interest of these communities if they are taken out from the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and treated exclusively as a distinctive group, with development schemes specially designed to suit their dominant characteristics?.

 According to the earlier government version, which contradicts the findings of the present national commission, a few of the denotified, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes have been specified as SCs or STs while almost all the remaining communities have been categorized as OBCs. 

 But there is a problem more serious than the controversy over their categorization. The national commission has never been allowed to work properly. Despite the decision to form the commission in 2003, it became functional only in 2005. It has been reconstituted again recently. Despite the delay and the confusion, let us hope that the commission manages to do something concrete for the welfare of these people.

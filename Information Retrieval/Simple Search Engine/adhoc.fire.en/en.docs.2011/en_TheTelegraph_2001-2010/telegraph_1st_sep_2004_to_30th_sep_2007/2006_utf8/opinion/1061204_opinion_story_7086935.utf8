 ACT FOR PEACE

 It cannot be a happy situation for a people to live continually under the armys shadow. It is understandable, therefore, why the people of Manipur want New Delhi to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, cannot be unaware of the peoples feelings about the act. In one of his first visits to the North-east after assuming office, he had promised to deal with the problem. His promise last week to amend the law is a welcome move forward on the governments part. Anyone familiar with the situation would hardly deny that there is a need to replace the AFSP Act with a more human law, as Mr Singh put it. The armys anti-insurgency operations in Manipur, as in other areas in the region, result in excesses of various kinds. Worse, the law itself gives the army powers to infringe on the peoples civil rights. Not just the rebels, large sections of the common people have long suffered because of the law.

 However, the armys role in maintaining peace and the rule of law in Manipur can hardly be overemphasized. But for the army, the rebels would have had a free run of the state and made things unbearable for the people. If the AFSP Act is a burden that the people would like to be rid of, they cannot be happy either to live under the shadow of the rebels gun. And, there is no dispute over the fact that the state administration is simply incapable of tackling the rebels on its own. It is instructive to compare Manipurs situation with that in Nagaland, where too the AFSP Act has long been in force. The peoples complaints about the act and the armys excesses in Nagaland have decreased dramatically since the Naga rebels and the army declared a ceasefire in 1997, leading to the peace talks. If the Manipuri rebels drop their guns and talk to the government, the controversial act would cease to overshadow the peoples lives. Peace is the best guarantee for a life of freedom.

 BACK TO THE PAVILION

 Quite a few of last years stars are likely to spend this year in the wings. THE TELEGRAPH lists some of them

 All the world may or may not be a stage, but some people certainly have their dramatic entries and exits. They come under the spotlights, deliver their lines ? and exit. So for them, if 2005 was the year of action on many fronts, 2006 will be the year of retirement. Quite a few of the players of the previous year are ready for their last bows. Some may come back with a curtain call. For the others, though, its goodbye. 

 L.K. Advani 

 Lal Krishna Advani likes his self-help 

 books. Tomes that give useful tips on ways to turn adversity 

 into advantage interest the man who shaped the Bharatiya 

 Janata Party (BJP). So, in July last year, when his party 

 erupted over his remarks on Pakistan founder M.A. Jinnah, 

 the astute politician thought the debate would help steer 

 his party in a new direction. 

 But, then, he hadnt accounted for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) which decided that it had had enough of the man it had, in turn, patronised for long years. The RSS wanted the BJP to go back to its roots and Hindutva plank, and ? with some help from the young turks of the BJP ? worked for Advanis ouster as the leader of the party. 

 So Advani ? these days in natty trousers instead of his trade-mark kurta-pyjamas ? has all the time to go back to his books. He will continue to be a centre of power, no doubt, but will no longer steer the party into its 26th year. People like Advaniji dont need to be in power to set the tone for the party, says an RSS leader. But his importance will continue.

 The score-board for 2006, though, would read: RSS 1, Advani 0. 

 Subroto Roy 

 He is one man who made headlines 

 for not being in the news in 2005. Meet Subroto Roy, chairman 

 and managing worker of the Rs 50,000-crore Sahara group, 

 who sent the media into a tizzy by his lack of public appearances 

 in the summer of 2005. The media speculated on his ill-health 

 and on challenges his public deposits business faced with 

 the Congress in power. 

 In June last year, Roy, however, hit the headlines again when he declared himself disease free. Since then, though hes been spotted off and on at social dos, hes been keeping a low profile. There is no agenda for him to go and stand in the public, says a close business associate who saw him rocking at a private birthday bash in Mumbai a few days ago. 

 Not all his businesses are rocking, though. Neither his airline nor the media and entertainment (newspapers and TV channels) business is profitable. The company is not averse to finding partners or buyers for the two. 

 While Saharashree, as Subroto Roy is popularly known, may keep to himself in 2006, expect the Sahara group to be in the news. After all, the company has won the Indian cricket team sponsorship rights for another four years and paid a hefty Rs 313 crore for getting its name and logo inscribed on cricketers shirts! 

 Uma Bharti 

 The sanyasin is on a long 

 journey ? literally and metaphorically. After being expelled 

 from the Bharatiya Janata Party, Uma Bharti, once seen as 

 the mascot for the party, is on a padayatra to Ayodhya. 

 But, quite like the road she is on, the former central minister and chief minister of Madhya Pradesh has difficult times ahead of her. There is some talk about her starting a new party ? as former Uttar Pradesh chief Kalyan Singh did once ? and then joining the fledgling party with the BJP ? as Kalyan Singh did later. 

 But the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which quite doted on her, believes that all is not lost on the Bharti front. An RSS ideologue points out that if her foe, M. Venkaiah Naidu, led the BJP in 2006, Bharti would have found it difficult to return to its fold. But she will not have a problem with (former UP chief minister) Rajnath Singh, says the RSS leader. So we are keeping a door open for her, even though we are not rolling out the red carpet.

 Jagmohan Dalmiya

 Just when we thought that Indian 

 cricket was Jagmohan Dalmiya and Jagmohan Dalmiya was Indian 

 cricket, the man was clean bowled. The hands-down defeat 

 in the BCCI elections came as the last nail in his coffin. 

 His vice-like grip on the countrys richest and most powerful sports body had already been loosening. With Sharad Pawar now entrenched in the board presidents chair and his prot?g? Sourav Ganguly on his way out, Dalmiyas return to prominence now seems as improbable as Ganguly scoring a triple-century against Pakistan. 

 The wide margin of defeat in the board polls last year has proved that the former cricket supremos clout has sharply declined. His opponents, growing in number by the day, were long waiting for this moment. Outside the board, Ganguly fans are peeved that he couldnt ensure honourable treatment to the former captain. The former ICC chiefs wings have been clipped. 

 But thats for the time being. Next year, he might have to lie low but a comeback is not ruled out, according to some. Says former national selector Sambaran Banerjee: Everything depends on how the Indian team performs. If it does well, the new dispensation will have it easy and things will be difficult for Mr Dalmiya. If it doesnt, who knows? But till such time, Dalmiya returns to the pavilion. 

 Harkishen Singh Surjeet 

 Once the best-known turbaned politician 

 in Delhi (before an economist took centre-stage, that is), 

 the old man of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is 

 not going to be seen ? not too often, anyway ? hobnobbing 

 with leaders of the so-called Third Front this year. That 

 the ailing Surjeet was bowing out became clear last year 

 when Prakash Karat replaced him as the new general secretary 

 of the party. Surjeet, often called the king maker, or sometimes 

 a political broker, is no longer what he was. A kidney has 

 been removed and the old war horse can hardly see or hear. 

 CPI(M) sources hold that while he will continue to attend the partys politburo meetings in 2006, his presence at the conclaves ? as well as his contribution to party policy or programme ? will be minimal. The man who used to get leaders of warring political factions together on the same platform ? all for building an anti-saffron forum (he even forced Amar Singh to gate-crash a Congress party in 2004) is all ready to hang up his hammer and sickle. 

 Govinda 

 The smile that can put the Cheshire 

 cats grin to shame didnt entice lady luck for 

 too long for Govinda in the year 2005 ? and, unfortunately 

 for the actor-turned-MP, he is expected to fare no better 

 in the coming year. 

 The last two years have been bad for the actor who made history with his multi-coloured trousers. The jump to politics did silence critics who had written his acting career off in 2004, after all his films got a lukewarm response at the box office. But the downswing continued. First came a string of flops (his first home production didnt find buyers for a year) and then family misfortunes (a near fatal road accident his family met with). 

 Then, just when the actor was trying to make up for his alleged links with Dawood Ibrahim by distributing free blankets to the homeless in his constituency, the actor fell into another row. Late last month, he was accused of man-handling and abusing a television reporter. No wonder Govinda looks set for an early retirement. 

 But one cant say hasta manana to the Virar ka chokra yet, for there are at least four new films slated for release in 2006. His political career, however, appears to have flopped, and shows little signs of reviving. Itll take some time for him to get out of the mess hes got into or learn to avoid it too, says a politician. And itll be sometime before you hear someone sing: Govinda aala rey...

 Jayendra Saraswati 

 His case may have been shifted 

 out of the Supreme Court of India and into his own backyard 

 in Pondicherry upon his plea, but critics believe its 

 the last headline that Jayendra Saraswati will make for 

 some time to come. 

 Just over a year ago, the Kanchi priest was widely perceived as a holy man. But arrested in the Shankara Raman murder case in November 2004, Saraswati is no longer another word for piety. Instead of leading religious discourses, he spent 2005 in and out of court rooms, demanding special treatment. 

 It was the undiplomatic way in which he presented himself under fire that took a toll on the very image he had built over the years, says Arya Samaj president Swami Agnivesh. Clearly, he will never regain that platform again. 

 K. Natwar Singh 

 There are exits and there are 

 exits. K. Natwar Singhs journey out of South Block, 

 however, is one that the much-travelled former diplomat 

 and foreign minister will regret. Singh ? in the news for 

 most of 2005 ? was ignominiously dropped from the Cabinet 

 last month soon after the Volcker committee report named 

 him as someone who had benefited from Iraqi oil sales in 

 2001. The new year is not going to be a happy one for the 

 old Stephanian. There are not many in his Congress party 

 who are going to mourn the exit of Natwar Singh, perceived 

 by many in the party as arrogant and brusque. So the 74-year-old 

 former minister says, hell spend his time writing 

 books ? he is, after all, one of the few bibliophiles in 

 the Congress. Whats clear, though, is that he is in 

 a political cul-de-sac with no way out. And that Singh has 

 sung his swan song.

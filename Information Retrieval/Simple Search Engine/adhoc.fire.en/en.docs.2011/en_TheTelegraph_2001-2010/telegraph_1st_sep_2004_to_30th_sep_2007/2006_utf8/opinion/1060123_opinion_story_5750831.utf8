 BIG TROUBLE FOR THE LITTLE ONES

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 The concern is with children who are denied their childhood and a future, who work at too young an age, who work long hours for low wages, who work under conditions harmful to their health and to their physical and mental development, who are often separated from their families and who are frequently deprived of education. Such child labour is invariably carried out to the detriment of the child and is in violation of international law and usually, national legislation.

 According to ILO estimates, about 250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 are working full or part time in developing countries. Almost half, some 120 million work full time, every day, all year round. Some 50-60 million are between 5 and 11 years old. Available data suggests that more boys than girls are economically active, but girls who are denied educational opportunities because of their role in household tasks and sibling childcare may not be accounted for in these statistics. Working in the early childhood years may indeed have a more significant impact on girls, reinforcing gender discrimination and resulting in a denial of life chances. Girls, moreover, are often engaged in work that exposes them to sexual and other forms of exploitation.

 The nature of child labour: child labour is basically a symptom of the underlying problem of widespread poverty and inequality in society. It is also cause of poverty, and in this context it becomes self-perpetuating. Poverty is deep-rooted and natural calamities, disasters, illiteracy, powerlessness and the lack of viable options further exacerbate the deprivations confronting poor parents who feel compelled to put a child to work. Poverty is not however the only factor in child labour and cannot justify all types of employment and servitude.

 Poorly educated parents do not understand the long-term significance and value of education over the short-term economic gain of child work and the acquisition of skills. A familys dependence on a girls labour at home and in the field may deny her access to educational and other opportunities. Education for poor children may be costly, inaccessible, of low quality and irrelevant. Children may decide to work to help increase the family income and there may be peer influence encouraging children to join working friends on the streetsor elsewhere.

 There is a market demand for child labour since children are generally docile, obedient, hired at cheaper rates than adults and dispensed of easily if labour demands fluctuate. They involve no long-term investment on the part of industry in terms of insurance or social security and low paid child labour may be a significant element for industries wishing to maintain a competitive edge in national and international markets...Children are often preferred in industries that are labour intensive, function with rudimentary technology and require laborious/repetitive work for long hours. It is suggested that in certain industries, like carpet making or electronics assembly, children are employed because of the dexterity of their small fingers. 

 Child labour persists because such laws as exist are not strictly enforced and political commitment is weak and there is no urge to comply. Many children work in extremely hazardous occupations and in dangerous industries such as construction, mining, quarrying and agriculture. A large number of children are trapped in virtual slavery in many parts of the world. They are bought and sold across national borders, and commercial sexual exploitation of children is on the rise. The employment of very young children and girls is a particularly alarming problem. The younger the children, the more vulnerable they are to hazards at the workplace and to economic exploitation. ILO surveys show that in some areas up to 20 per cent of child workers are under the age of 10.

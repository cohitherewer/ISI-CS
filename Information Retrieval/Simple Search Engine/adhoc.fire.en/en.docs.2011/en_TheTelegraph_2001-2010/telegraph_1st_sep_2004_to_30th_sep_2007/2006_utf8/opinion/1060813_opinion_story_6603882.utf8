 REFUSAL TO SAY GOODBYE

 An actor is often judged on the way he says his exit lines. What is true for the stage is true for life also. The art of saying goodbye is a fine art not cultivated by many. In India, many do not learn it at all or are oblivious that such an art exists. This is not the case elsewhere in the world. Compare to take examples from the field of sport the cases of David Beckham and Sourav Ganguly. The former announced his resignation as captain of the English football team immediately after Englands reversals in the World Cup. Now he has been dropped from the squad and has accepted his exit as par for the course in the context of the new coachs attempts to build a new team for the Euro 2008 and the next World Cup. This is in stark contrast with Gangulys refusal to step down despite poor performances as batsman and as captain. He not only sulked when he was removed but also tried to use political influence to expedite his return. There is a refusal on Gangulys part to accept the age factor he is nearing 35 which is probably one thing that explains his failure to get runs even at the second division county level in England. Even Sachin Tendulkar, a far greater batsman than Ganguly, seems to be afflicted by the same delusions as Ganguly. Age is against Tendulkar too, he has been playing cricket at the top level since he was 15, he has been forced to get his elbow and shoulder treated and he has not been able to play too many first-class games in recent memory. Yet he refuses, like Ganguly, to hang up his boots and say goodbye.

 Indian cricket stars seem to have learnt from Indian politicians. Politics is the geriatric ward. Mr Jyoti Basu, the leader of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), was born a few years before the Russian Revolution which inspired him. But he continues to be active in politics, firing away homilies on all aspects of life and politics, and takes special pleasure at sniping at his successor to the chief ministership of West Bengal. Mr Basu complains about his ill health, but retirement from politics has obviously not crossed his mind. He is by no means alone. His political opponents, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr L.K. Advani of the Bharatiya Janata Party, have both crossed the Biblical quota of three score and ten. Politicians have no retirement age, so even those who are over eighty continue, even though the era in which they first came into politics is now lost in the aeons of history.

 It would appear that in spheres like politics and sports, where voluntary retirement is the obvious norm, careers are more prolonged than is necessary. It would not be unfair to say that power and wealth influence the deferment of retirement. The impact of this may not be altogether healthy for sports and politics. Sportsmen must acknowledge that with age physical abilities decline, and ageing politicians have to be aware that their mental faculties are on the slippery slope of senility.

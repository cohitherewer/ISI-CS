 DEVOTED TO DEATH

 THIS ABOVE ALL - 

Khushwant Singh

 Road to perdition

 A couple of weeks ago a ship carrying over 1,300 passengers was overtaken by a storm in the Red Sea and sank off the Egyptian coast. Many of those drowned were Hajis, returning from pilgrimage in Mecca. The name of the ship was Al Salaam, which means both peace and safety. Some days before, over 50 pilgrims were killed in a stampede at Mina, close to Mecca. As usual, I asked myself ?Have I got the concept of Allah being almighty as well as just and merciful all wrong? How do believers explain such happenings??

 The same sort of thing happens at Kumbh Melas, pilgrimages to Vaishno Devi, Paonta Sahib, around the country on special religious festivals. Without exception, all the victims are devout believers, come to pay homage to their deities. I ask myself the same question, substituting bhagwan or Wahguru for Allah: ?Why do you kill devotees who came to worship you?? No answer; neither from ishwar or Wahguru, nor from any of their mureeds (disciples).

 Most people do not bother to think about such matters, they regard it as a waste of time. ?What ishwar-Allah or the ooperwallah (the bloke above) does is beyond our comprehension ? take life as it comes and don?t ask too many questions,? they say. It creates duvidha (doubts) in peoples? minds. I hit back: ?Then who do you pray to? Why are you constantly singing his praises?? No answers. I drive my point home by quoting Freud: ?When a man is freed of religion he has a better chance to live a normal and wholesome life.?

 The argument usually ends with pro-religion people denouncing me as a mischief-maker and order me to stop this buk buk. I will not. Give me the answers or admit you do not know. Let your answers be in simple language which I and others doubters can understand.

 Fourth-time lucky

 She came to see me 25 years ago when I was the editor of the Hindustan Times. She had just finished college and was looking for a job. Despite her looks, I put her off by saying I had nothing to offer. I forgot what she looked like.

 Years later, she came to see me in Kasauli. She was then teaching English in some college in Chandigarh and writing pieces for The Indian Express. I don?t recall my second meeting. She came a third time with her husband, who was working for The Asian Age, along with K.P.S. Gill. I remember Gill?s visit because he came over an hour late, and was very high. My wife ticked him off, forced him to have his dinner at once and depart. I don?t recall people he had brought uninvited with him. 

 She came a fourth time with my wife?s nephew, Baljit Malik, who had warned her that I had become old and cranky and often told my guests to leave because I was tired. I have no recollection of this visit either.

 Than I saw her photograph alongside my review of her novel Patiala Quartet. I could not recognize her face but was infatuated. I had given her a very favourable review and expected a word of thanks from her. 

 As I expected, she sent me a short note saying she would like to drop in when she came to Delhi the next time. I was excited by the prospect. I prepared a long speech to tell her not to waste her time teaching but to take up writing. Her next book should be a definite novel on resurgent Punjab. It should be set in Ludhiana, Punjab?s largest and most prosperous city. It had more Mercedes Benzes than any other city in India; two men had their private aircraft, it was full of parvenu newly rich with pots of money but little culture, it was a squalid urban waste; it had more people defecating along its railway lines than any other city I have visited. It is the birthplace of Green Revolution: its seeds were sown in its Agricultural University. It has history, Chandigarh has neither a soul nor history. Amritsar has nothing besides the Golden Temple, and has been much written about. I continued at a breathless pace about her being a gifted story-seller and the only one who could put Punjab on the literary map of the world through writing a fictional profile of Ludhiana where she was born. I ended with oblique reference to my infatuation quoting a Punjabi Sufi poet:

 Pehlee pauri prem dee/Pulsaratey dyera

 Haji Makkey haj karan/Main much deykhaan teyra 

 Ai Inayat Qadri/Hath pakreen meyra

 (I take the first step of love

 On Pulsarat I await my fate.

 Hajis go to Mecca for pilgrimage

 I turn my gaze on your face.

 O Inayat Qadri, hold me by my hand.)

 I explained the concept of Pulsarat, the bridge between heaven and hell where souls await their destiny.

 She listened patiently to my torrent of words with a bemused smile. When I finished gushing, she told me that it was not the first but the fourth time I was seeing her. Her name is Neel Kamal Puri. But I could use her nickname, Neeloo, as a reward.

 Choose your bird wisely

 Banta: ?If you were offered a chicken from the Congress party and one from the American president, which one would you select??

 Santa: ?The one from the Congress party.?

 Banta: ?Because you are a nationalist??

 Santa: ?No, because a bird from the ?Hand? is worth two from Bush.?

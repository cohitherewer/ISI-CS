The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Manmohan Singh ko gussa kyon aata hai? Because the left ? and more significantly, a section of the Congress ? just won?t stop saying that he is bent on selling the country to the US. Who?s going to convince them that it is a little difficult for a man to do all on his own? But the allegations have hurt and angered the prime minister so much that he has expressed his desire (to a few cabinet colleagues and confidantes in the party) to quit the top job right after the budget session. As the left protests gathered momentum, Congress leaders from West Bengal started blaming the PM for timing the Bush visit just before the assembly elections in Bengal, thus giving the CPI(M) and its allies a rather strong stick to flog the Congress with. The PM has tired of explaining that he is doing what is in the best interests of the country, but no one seems to be listening. Hence the extreme step. Since Singh is generally known to be a man not given to impulse or frivolity, the threat has been taken very seriously. In fact, the decision to get the finance bill passed in the first half of the budget session itself may not have been prompted by the upcoming assembly polls after all.

 If Bush has made life difficult for the prime minister, those in charge of the US president?s security had the same effect on the Indian bureaucracy and security establishment. When they were not letting sniffer-dogs loose in Raj Ghat, they were either demanding their own aerial recce over Purana Qila, or seats in the enclosure marked out for the Indian media. Thanks to those television cameras which caught the American canines at the Gandhi samadhi, we now know what lies behind the American president?s ?easy mingling with the masses?.

 N.D. Tiwari has been in politics long enough to be able to read the signs. He has offered to resign as the Uttaranchal chief minister, sensing that the lady from 10 Janpath may have plans to replace him. By thus acting gracefully, Tiwari expects to earn for himself a seat in the Rajya Sabha ? and proceed gradually towards next year?s presidential and vice-presidential polls. Although Tiwari is a master at showing loyalty ? he once offered to pick up Sanjay Gandhi?s chappals ? two gentlemen are not impressed: Rajiv Shukla is thinking of going to the upper house from Uttaranchal, and Arjun Singh has been eyeing the vice-president?s chair.

 Ever since the cabinet reshuffle, the allotment of rooms to the new ministers in the parliament building has been much talked about, largely because of the spat between Jairam Ramesh and Ashwini Kumar. Some time has passed after that, and most of the new ministers, including minor ones, have managed to grab a room for themselves. Not Murli Deora, the new petroleum minister. Nor is he in a hurry to be allotted one. May his patience be rewarded.

 All those who were invited to the king?s ball went home with a prize ? from the first lady. Laura Bush had come to India bearing a gift wrapped with gold paper for everyone. It was a small crystal ball with a lithograph of the White House and the first lady?s signature embossed underneath. Two men who are not going to be able to show off the White House crystal (more famous than Swarovski?) are Mani Shankar Aiyar and Natwar Singh. But Aiyar was quick to point out that there was a ?qualitative? difference between him and Natwar.

 The first lady of Congress politics, too, had thrown a ball for all the Lok Sabha MPs and their spouses. A sumptuous meal ? with juicy kebabs of different varieties, except chicken, of course ? was laid out in the back lawns of 10 Janpath. Sonia Gandhi played the perfect host, discussing with Priya Dutt her first-born?s teething problems, and learning new facts about diabetes from the doctor husband of Madhu Gowd Yakshi, a first-timer from Andhra Pradesh. But the younger MPs got special attention from Madam. She asked Milind Deora when he planned to get married. The young man replied that he was waiting for Rahul Gandhi to lead the way. The cheeky response went down well with Sonia, who went on to repeat the query to Jitin Prasada. Even this youngster claimed that it all depended on when Rahul would tie the knot. Lest this turned into a movement of sorts, Madam decided not to take the question to the other young bachelors at the party.

 This lady takes herself seriously and expects others to do the same. You can?t hand Mallika Sherawat and her entourage economy class tickets and expect her to attend your show, no matter how many big names came to it. The organizers of a film awards ceremony found this to their cost recently. They tried to make amends by offering her a seat on a private aircraft with none other than Shah Rukh Khan. Little did they know that they had handed her a perfect opportunity to get even with Shah Rukh. A month back, Mallika had wished to accompany him on a trip back to Mumbai from a party organized by Praful Patel. The matinee idol of Bollywood potboilers had reportedly discouraged her on account of the low neckline of her dress ? which left little about her bustline to the imagination. And now, here was Mallika, with the organizers pleading her to be Shah Rukh?s co-passenger. The gentle lady that she is, she merely asked them to tell King Khan that she still had the same bustline.

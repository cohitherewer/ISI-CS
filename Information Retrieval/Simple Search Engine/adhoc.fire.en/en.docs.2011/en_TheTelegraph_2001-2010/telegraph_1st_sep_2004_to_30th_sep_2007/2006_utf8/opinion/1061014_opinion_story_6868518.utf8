 THE DECLINE AND FALL OF A DRAGON SLAYER

 George Fernandes, against whom the CBI filed a case for alleged irregularities in the purchase of the Barak missile system, is a man of great contradictions

 The world according to George Fernandes has no greys. There is a lot of black, though, and quite a lot of white and all at the same time. Fernandes once hailed for his integrity and now accused of corruption is, without doubt, a man of contradictions. 

 For one, he is hated as much as he is loved. Old socialists, who stuck on to the middle path when he veered right, cant stand him. But some die-hard associates believe he can do no wrong. He is one of the rarest and most honest politicians the country has ever had, says old friend Mahabal Shetty, general secretary of the Municipal Mazdoor Union in Mumbai and chairman of the minimum wages advisory committee. For honesty I would give him 101 per cent marks. 

 Some describe him as politically shrewd, and some see him as gullible. The supporters point out that it was he who kept the National Democratic Alliance government going for six troublesome years. Detractors like to underline the fact that the man who built the Samata Party has been, for quite some time now, allowing his politics to be scripted by his long-time partner, Jaya Jaitly. 

 I personally feel that his connection with Jaya Jaitly did him in, says Sharad Rao, president of the Municipal Mazdoor Union and chairman of the labour cell, Nationalist Congress Party. Rao, another old associate, believes that Fernandes erred in letting Jaitly rule the roost in the Samata Party, which later merged with the Janata Dal (United). 

 There is, likewise, a school that holds he was a great defence minister who cared for Indian jawans. Another lot will have you believe that he upset a well-oiled machinery in the army by upstaging the military brass. Some would say that he belonged to the old school of incorruptible socialists. Others point to the Tehelka episode, in which the news organisation ran a sting operation in Fernandess office and caught his colleagues taking money from journalists posing as defence deal brokers. 

 There is, clearly, a Dr Jekyll and a Mr Hyde in Fernandes. I have never seen a more honest man than George Fernandes in my entire lifetime, avers an associate of 40 years, Digambar Satav, working president of the Mumbai Mazdoor Union. Others are not so sure. Rao complains that a flat that workers unions bought in a tony neighbourhood in New Delhi has been taken over by Jaitly. She is holding the property as her fiefdom, says Rao. 

 Which is why, with stories ricocheting around the corridors of power on Fernandes, nobody was really surprised when earlier this week the Central Bureau of Investigation filed a case against him, Jaitly and former Navy chief Sushil Kumar for alleged irregularities in the purchase of the Barak missile system from Israel in 2000. The supporters see it as political vendetta; the detractors as come-uppance. 

 But the man who would have been a priest if he hadnt left a seminary because of its regimented structure reacted with characteristic aplomb. He dragged president Abdul Kalam Azad into the controversy, saying that the president, as an advisor to the government, had approved of the missile system. And then he zoomed off to Bihar, pausing once to say that he would campaign for his old friend Mulayam Singh Yadav. There are some brave voices that have been defending Fernandes, but his former mentors in the Bharatiya Janata Party are suitably red faced. 

 For a man who came into politics as a dragon slayer he defeated Congress strongman S.K. Patil in an election in Mumbai nearly 40 years ago the fall has been a tragic one. Politically sidelined last April when he lost his position in his own party after an internal election, things have not been the same for him since the Tehelka expose. There was a Fernandes before Tehelka who used to make people follow him, says a bureaucrat. And then there is a Fernandes after Tehelka, diffident and apathetic. 

 To make matters worse, a brain surgery has taken a lot of steam out of the man. He forgets what he is saying, and sometimes jumps from one topic to another, says a former aide. 

 The last time he raised eyebrows was a little over 10 years ago, when Fernandes first started making noises in support of the BJP. He later told a friend in jest that a road accident had brought about the change in him. It turned my brain a bit to the right, he said. 

 His sudden move from the socialist plank to the BJPs stable rattled his old friends, but the member of Parliament from Muzaffarpur in Bihar did not regret the move. If I have to play a role, I have to be in the centre of politics, he told a friend. Look at Madhu Limayejee he couldnt play a role because he was not holding power.

 Fernandes did play a role during the NDA days, but there are some who believe that his glorious era was during his trade union period, when he was organising hotel workers, taxi drivers and port workers. Old timers recall how he fought Indira Gandhi during the Emergency and booted Coca Cola out of India in the Janata regime. 

 But that was then. His son now works for Goldman Sachs in New York, and Fernandes is not the old firebrand that he was. 

 When the NDA lost power two years ago, an associate asked him what he wanted to do. The two things that I do best, he replied. I am going to read, and I am going to do politics.

 Well, there are always books.

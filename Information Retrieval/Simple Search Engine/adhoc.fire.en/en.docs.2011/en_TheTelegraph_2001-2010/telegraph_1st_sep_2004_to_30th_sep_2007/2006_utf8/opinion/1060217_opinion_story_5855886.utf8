 MILITARY LIST

 The Indian army moves with an enormous amount of baggage. This baggage is colonial, and pertains not only to the various rituals that govern army life but also to the patterns of recruitment. The British Indian army was recruited on the basis of selected castes. In the early 19th century, the sepoys of the Bengal Native Infantry, for example, were largely drawn from the upper castes of Awadh. After the revolt of 1857-58, when recruitment into the army became more methodical and streamlined, the British invented the tradition of the martial races of India. One motive behind the creation of this myth was the reward for loyalty: Rajputs, loyal to the raj during the uprising, and the Sikhs who had helped in quelling it, were declared the martial races. The army of independent India has not succeeded in ridding itself of this utterly spurious stereotype. It is an undeniable fact that the Indian army has a very large proportion of Sikhs. This preponderance is particularly noticeable in the upper echelons. The Indian army ? if the adjective denoting nationality has to have any relevance ? must reflect Indian society. The recruitment to the Indian army should be so directed as to include all sections of Indian society, cutting across caste and religion. There are reasons to doubt that this is not happening in the Indian army. The top brass of the army should be told by their political masters to forget the old myths and to recruit those who are fit to join the army, irrespective of their background.

 The response to a recent query from the prime minister?s office to find out how many Muslims there are in the army and what positions they hold shows how touchy the military establishment is about such questions. Why should such figures be kept under a shroud of secrecy? The Indian army is not above society and the democratic norms that govern it. This is an information that should be easily and readily available. If the figures point to any prejudice and bias, they should immediately be corrected. The Indian army cannot afford to forget that its upkeep is paid for from the public exchequer and therefore it must be open to some norms of accountability. Indian society is discriminatory and plagued by inequalities. As one of the biggest employers, the army should stand forth as an example of open and fair recruitment. Only then can the Indian soldiers wear the medals they so richly deserve.

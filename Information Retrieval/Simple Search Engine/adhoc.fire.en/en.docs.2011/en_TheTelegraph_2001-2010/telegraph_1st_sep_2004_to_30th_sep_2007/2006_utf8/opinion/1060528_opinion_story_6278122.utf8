 Letters to Editor

 All that trash

 Sir ? During my visit to the US, I hardly saw anything mentioned in regard to India in the American media. And to think that the media here are so enamoured of trivial incidents in America. Our newspapers are often full of stories on the love life of the rich and the famous in Hollywood. Such stories do not have any recreational value and deprive our newspapers from devoting space to more important stories. Isn?t it time our media get a little more careful about the choice of foreign news? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Kapoor, Noida

 No fear

 Sir ? In reference to the reports ?Ticking-bomb tag 

on bridge? and ?Flaws many in the making of bridge: Expert? on May 21 and 22, 

Larsen amp; Toubro would like to state that it has built many projects that stand 

testimony to its skill, capability and commitment. The accident on May 19 has 

been unfortunately linked to some internal documents supposedly provided by Jurgen 

H.H. Dorbecker, the erstwhile supervisor of the Second Vivekananda bridge in your 

reports. Dorbecker has been positioned as an ?expert? and quoted as saying that 

the bridge is not being built to the right design and quality and will, therefore, 

have a short lifespan. Kindly note that Dorbecker cannot be considered an expert 

for this type of a bridge. He could not explain the reasons for his apprehension 

in any report while in service. His comments have come only after his removal. 

We believe that the bridge is shaping up as a world-class project in design and 

quality of construction. This has been acknowledged by a number of expert visitors 

to the project. L amp;T is a shareholder in the special purpose vehicle set up 

for the project and its stake is much higher than just construction. We have completed 

70 per cent of the construction in 26 months, which is an international record. 

In a project of such magnitude and complexity, being done for the first time in 

India using the latest technique that is intensively mechanized, a few incidents 

of equipment failure have taken place. All efforts have been made to set right 

the damages and put in place additional safeguards. L amp;T invites you to nominate 

an expert to discuss and evaluate the project to ensure justice to the image of 

the parties involved in constructing the bridge, which will be a new landmark 

for Calcutta. 

 Yours faithfully,

J. Ganguly, Executive vice-president, Larsen amp; Toubro, ECC Division

 Our correspondent replies: Dorbecker was hired by the project presumably because he was an expert, which was why his fears about the bridge?s safety were highlighted, because, after all, it?s a public property.

 Hungry hearts 

 Sir ? With Greg Chappell wielding the cane and Rahul Dravid acting like a class monitor, the fun has gone out of the lives of our cricketers. The players will now have to let go of their beloved parathas, dosas and vadas under the instruction of Guru Greg. Accepting dinner invitations from locals is prohibited too. One wonders what will be the next item on Chappell?s ban-list. Whistling on the team bus may be? Would someone tell Chappell that Kapil?s Devils won the World Cup after surviving on Indian food? Still better, the Indian coach should ask his brother, Ian, how he managed to score runs after tucking in those chicken tandooris in India. Our poor cricketers don?t seem to have lives to call their own anymore. Why not let the poor boys be and allow them to eat what they want?

 Yours faithfully,

Partha De Sarkar, Calcutta

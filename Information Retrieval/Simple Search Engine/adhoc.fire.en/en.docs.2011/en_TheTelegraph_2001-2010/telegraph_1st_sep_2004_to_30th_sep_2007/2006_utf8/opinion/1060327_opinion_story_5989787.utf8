 UNDER THE RED SKY

 Gwynne Dyer

 The Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, has a basic problem. He came to power forty years too late. If his Democratic Progressive Party had won power in 1960, not 2000, he could probably have got away with his project for an independent Taiwan. But back then Taiwan was ruled with an iron hand by the Kuomintang, refugees from a lost civil war who dreamed of reconquering the mainland and rejected any thought of a separate Taiwan. Now it?s too late.

 Chen?s supporters marched through Taipei last Saturday to mark the tenth anniversary of the Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis when China ?test-fired? missiles into the waters off Taiwan to warn voters not to back the pro-independence party in the island?s first free election, and the first anniversary of Beijing?s Anti-Secession Law, which threatens to use ?non-peaceful means? to block Taiwan?s independence. 

 The marchers carried banners declaring ?Anti-annexation? and ?Terminate the National Unification Council,? the latter referring to Chen?s decision to do just that. Chen led the crowd in a chant of ?Protect Taiwan, no to annexation,? as if China planned to annex Taiwan against the democratic will of the Taiwanese people. But not one in the crowd was naive enough to believe that that was really the issue.

 The status quo since the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949 has been no annexation, but no independence for Taiwan either. Both sides agreed that there was only one China; they disagreed about who should be running it, but they weren?t going to have another war about it. This was the deal formalized in 1972, when President Richard Nixon shifted American diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, and it was ratified by the two Chinese sides in negotiations in Hong Kong in 1992. What has changed since then is not Beijing?s position; it is Taipei?s.

 Motherland rules

 Taiwan?s aboriginal inhabitants are related to ethnic groups in the northern Philippines, but by 400 years ago, Chinese settlers were already a majority. They were refugees from the stifling hierarchy of imperial China and their heirs have spent less than half of the time between then and now under direct Chinese rule. The arrival of millions of defeated KMT officials, troops and their families, and the subsequent four decades of brutally authoritarian KMT rule, did not make them fonder of the ?mainlanders?.

 Once the KMT ended martial law and began the transition to democracy, identity issues began to play a big role in Taiwan?s politics. Many people who saw themselves as historically Taiwanese wanted a decisive break with the mainland. There was potential voter support for a policy of outright independence, and since the DPP won the presidency in 2000, Chen Shui-bian has been unremitting in his assertions of Taiwan?s right to choose its own course.Yet there has always been an element of make-believe about the independence movement. The basic fact is that there are only 23 million people in Taiwan, while there are 1,330 million people in China ? and they almost all believe that there must be only one China.

 Most Taiwanese understand this. So the independence movement is largely a charade. Chen came close to admitting that when he pointed out that there was no need to panic over his demands for a new name, a new constitution, and ultimately formal independence for Taiwan, since the opposition controls the legislature and will block all his demands. 

 And in another two years, the DPP will lose the presidency too, for the Taiwanese economy has suffered due to the deliberate roadblocks that the party has placed in the way of easier relations with China. The 2008 election is likely to restore the ?pan-blue? coalition centred on the KMT to power. Unless there is some cross-Strait crisis first, of course, but nobody would deliberately seek that.

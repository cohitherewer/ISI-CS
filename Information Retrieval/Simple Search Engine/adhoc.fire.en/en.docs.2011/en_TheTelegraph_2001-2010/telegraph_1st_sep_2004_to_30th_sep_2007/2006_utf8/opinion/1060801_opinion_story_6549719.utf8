The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOO STERN

 The freedom to be silly is also a kind of freedom. And to know the difference between the silly and the serious is a kind of maturity. The two young women who drove gaily into 7, Race Course Road to ?see? the prime minister, one of them claiming to be a niece, were being thoroughly silly. But it could also be said that their employers as well as the Indian State, in the severity and belated fluster of their punitive response, have not been entirely mature either. It did not take very long to establish the fact that Ms Bina Chowdhury and Ms Yogita Khatwani were acting on an impulse that intended no harm to the prime minister or his men. So, first to raise an alarm that reached parliament and the party head-office, then to submit them to the rigours of the law, and finally to summarily dismiss them from employment will appear to most sensible people as anxious damage-control by an establishment that has itself been made to look rather silly.

 The two women had driven up to the reception of the prime minister?s residence. Technically, this was not a breach of security, as the security men themselves have claimed. If this is deemed risky, then it is the fault of those who have devised these measures and not of the two women. To charge them with ?criminal trespass? and ?impersonation? is also to apply the letter of law to a situation whose banality makes rather a mockery of such sternness. The disproportionate aftermath of the incident is also a measure of the solemn distance that now separates innocuous, ordinary Indians from their political leaders. This, and the lack of humour with which the occasional bridging of that distance is dealt with, are unfortunate for any modern democracy. A prime minister known for his lack of pomposity could even allow himself to wonder if two young people wanting to drop in to say hello to him, however recklessly, might be a nice thing after all.

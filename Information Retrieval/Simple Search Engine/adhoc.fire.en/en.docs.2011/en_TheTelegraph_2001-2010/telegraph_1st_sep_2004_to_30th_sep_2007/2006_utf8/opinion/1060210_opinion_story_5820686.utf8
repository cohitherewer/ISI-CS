 Contract killers and cows at play

 Long spoon lane (Headline, ?2.99) by Anne Perry is a period thriller with lurching hansom cabs and women called Vespasia and Charlotte. This is Victorian London and Perry?s Thomas Pitt of the Special Branch is on a bombing and police corruption trail in East London. Anxieties roused by the bombings are being fanned by the press, and a bill to arm the London police is about to be rushed through parliament. Against this backdrop, Pitt agrees to join forces with his most deadly enemy, Sir Charles Voisey, to prevent a corrupt policeman from becoming the most powerful man in England.

 Translating india (Foundation, Rs 195) by Rita Kothari is an interesting monograph that starts with the question, ?How does a common ?idea of India? make itself available to a Bengali, a Kannadiga, or a speaker of Metei?? ?Only through translation,? seems to be Kothari?s answer. Her study is centred on the production of the corpus referred to as Indian Literature in English Translation, and concerns itself with this industry and what goes into feeding it. She looks at the changing cultural and professional universe of urban, English-speaking middle-class India, and examines in detail readership patterns, attitudes to English, as well as academic and publishing trends. Her special case study is Gujarat where she lives and writes on postcolonialism and communalization.

 Citizen vince (Hodder, ?3.50) by Jess Walter starts with the deadpan profundity, ?One day you know more dead people than live ones.? Citizen Vince is not exactly a model citizen. His real name is Marty Hagen and is a career criminal from New Jersey, given a new identity by the Witness Protection Program, with all his rights restored, including his right to vote, something he has never done. For Vince, voting in the coming presidential election suddenly becomes a matter of great importance, providing him with an opportunity of self-transformation. But while Vince is busy remaking himself, his past arrives in town in the form of a contract killer whom he recognizes from his old life. Has he come to kill Vince? With three days left for the election, Vince must duck crooks, policemen and an implacable killer, as he tries to figure out a way to save himself and his dreams of a future.

 The Raja is dead (HarperCollins, Rs 295) by Shivani Singh is a lushly over-written family intrigue, set in the ?corridors of Sirikot palace? just before Independence, its air heavy with adjectives and pedigree (the writer is a descendant of the royal family of Madhupur, we are informed). There is decadence, debauchery and imperial whim, concubinage, kinship and primogeniture. The Raja of Sirikot is dead, and his thirteen-year-old granddaughter is determined to investigate. Prose sample: ?The Toyota Qualis waddles like a fat-bottomed woman over the bumpy turnoff to the entrance gate... As the motorcar reaches the gate it leaves a chocolate wake of muddy sludge. Discarded polythene bags of many dirty colours lace the road; the virulent filth of the Indian countryside.?

 Gandhi?s tiger and sita?s smile (Yoda, Rs 350) by Ruth Vanita is subtitled ?Essays on Gender, Sexuality and Culture?. It is another wide-ranging and eclectic collection of essays that combines scholarship with queerness. Her subjects span from Vedic and medieval literature to Hindi fiction and cinema, from Radclyffe Hall to cows at play, from the lesbian subject as tragic hero to god as sakhi.

 LINE OF CONTROL

 The more things change in Bengal, the more they remain the same. If the graffiti artists are about to be called back from hibernation, there is no reason to hold back the welcome note to the citys hawkers, the Marxists friends in need. A bit of the banner was already on display prior to the assembly polls earlier this year, when electoral needs made the left-run municipal corporation allow hawkers to stay put on pavements. The reformist chief minister of the state, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had justified the sudden benevolence by citing his concern for the unemployed. The citys mayor, Mr Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has merely lent more substance to such emotions by taking up the chalk to demarcate a permanent space for the men. The estimated 2.75 lakh hawkers, together with their helpers and bountiful ware, are about to take up precisely one-third of the citys ever-shrinking pavements. A good-character certificate will be handed over to them in the form of identity cards at the end of six months. As of now, it is still not clear who is to monitor the hawkers obedience to the rules the mayor has laid down for them with much-feigned strictness. The police (who have received their share of the spoils and turned a blind eye to the menace) or the long-suffering residents of the city, or the Left Front, watching over as the big brother? There is confusion in the minds of the beneficiaries as well, but perhaps that is for their own good.

 It goes without saying that the rights of the citizens have been given a short shrift. But then, under no circumstances, could these have outweighed the political concerns of the establishment. The chief minister, by going back on his own word about the citys much-needed facelift, has already shown that his pious wishes cannot survive the anti-reform blizzards that emanate from within his own party, time and again. If the need for votes demanded tolerance to encroaching hawkers, it is the need to retain a semblance of a status quo in a rapidly-changing Bengal, post-Singur, that perhaps now requires a backward drive. What it does to the image of the chief minister is, of course, a question that does not seem to bother anyone in particular. There are other programmes to reaffirm that the drive against the hand-drawn-rickshaw-pullers for example. Their 18,000 votes are, clearly, no match for the hawkers 2.75 lakh.

 Letters to Editor

 Harsh notes

 Sir ? The transport minister, Subhas Chakraborty, has once again stepped out of line and spoiled his party?s image by making disparaging remarks against the Election Commission (?One minister in the dock...?, April 5). The leaders of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) are trying their best to suppress the matter in the interest of the ensuing election but they will not succeed in achieving their objective. The minister should be severely reprimanded for his comments and the party might also think of suspending him for this irresponsible act. Unfortunately, Chakraborty wields considerable clout in the upper echelons of the party, and this might help him go unpunished despite his misdemeanours. 

 Yours faithfully,

Joyeeta Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? Subhas Chakraborty?s outburst against poll officials and the police did not come as a surprise. Chakraborty, along with other leaders of the CPI(M), have made it a habit of threatening election officials to make them do their bidding. Little wonder then that the party has been fretting over the EC?s decision to engage workers from other states to do poll duty in West Bengal. On most occasions, the EC calls upon the service of the state police ? which is under the influence of the ruling party ? to ensure that the polls are not rigged. Raising a separate force for elections duty may prove to be an expensive affair. Therefore, the EC would be better of seeking the army?s help to ensure free and fair elections in the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.S. Sharma, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the communists are really the people?s favourite, then why are they unhappy with the directives that have been issued by the EC? Hopefully, the FIR lodged against Chakraborty will deter other party leaders from acting in an irresponsible manner in the future. The world may have already realized that Communism does not work, but it seems that the people of West Bengal are not yet ready to accept this fact. 

 Yours faithfully,

Debu Sen, Cambridge, US

 Sir ? The manner in which the transport minister intimidated election officials tells us why the left has been winning the polls since the late Seventies. Left leaders routinely threaten election officials before every election. This time though, they are worried about the EC?s pledge to hold ?free and fair? elections in the state. The EC is still a toothless entity as our politicians have ensured that it is divested of the power to conduct fair elections . The fact that it has still managed to hold free elections on some occasions, for instance in Bihar, is due to the courage and integrity of a few officials. However, this is a fragile arrangement. Politicians may still transform the EC into a corrupt institution by appointing people of their choice at the helm. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? The unceremonious remark against the EC has put Subhas Chakraborty at a spot. Chakraborty?s comment goes to show that he has very little respect for the guidelines issued by his party. The chief minister may have conceded that Chakraborty should not have made such a comment. Yet the present dispensation did not dare to show-cause the errant minister. If a veteran comrade violates the party line time and again, tarnishing its image in the process, should he not be told off in a harsh tone?

 Yours faithfully,

Mihir Kanungo, Calcutta

 Sir ? Subhas Chakraborty seems to have learnt nothing during his long stint in the legislative assembly. His acerbic comments against the EC may actually cost the Left Front a few votes in the coming elections. The chief electoral officer, Debasish Sen, should have lodged an FIR on his own accord instead of waiting for orders from New Delhi. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Where the urban educated class have failed, the rebels have succeeded (?First The Kid, then message for adults: don?t vote?, April 17). The rebels, it seems, are a truly enlightened lot, considering the fact that they arranged a screening of The Kid so that poor villagers along the Bengal-Jharkhand border could catch a glimpse of Chaplin?s versatile genius. The urban elite, despite their education and affluence, have never been able to do something of this kind. Chaplin?s film deals with poverty and corruption, which is why the rebels chose to screen it in the first place. This step might intensify their anger against a government that cares very little for the poor and needy in the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sengupta, Durgapur

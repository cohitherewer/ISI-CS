 Letters to Editor

 United we stand

 Sir ? The crude bomb explosions inside the Jama Masjid, while prayers were going on, left 13 people injured, one of them seriously (?Theme of unity pierces blast?, April 15). The enemies of peace are at work again, and disruptions now seem more easy to effect than before. What is particularly damaging is the way the police operate in such situations. It is now common practice to pick up anyone from the street and label him as member of some militant organization without any detailed investigation to confirm such suspicion. Such an attitude will achieve nothing and damage many innocents. 

 In this case, what needs to be seen is whether the blasts were really masterminded by militants or some other vested interest groups who want to capitalize on the mayhem. In other words, the police should not rest complacent by passing the buck to ?militants?. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mukesh Meshram, Nagpur 

 Sir ?The choice of Jama Masjid as the target of the recent spate of blasts makes the intentions of the terrorists quite clear. They wish to divide the people of India on communal lines. As the bomb blasts at Benaras a month ago failed to trigger any major communal dissent in the country, the other option ? bombing of an important Muslim place of worship ? was tried out. Full credit goes to the people of India who, despite bearing the brunt of the violence, have shown remarkable courage and enough maturity to stand by the ideals of non-violence and amity. 

 It is not important whether Pakistan-based terrorists or sangh parivar outfits are behind this blast. What is important to know is that the perpetrators of this violence are unscrupulous people who can go to any extent to achieve their end. The best way to defeat these evil forces is to stand united against in the face of all such provocations.

Yours faithfully, 

Touseef Ahmed Khan, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The equanimity shown by Hindus and Muslims after the blasts at Benaras and now at Jama Masjid is remarkable, and increases the responsibility of the government ? both Centre and state ? in maintaining the peace. If victims are paid adequate attention, compensated properly, and enough effort is made to apprehend the culprits, the people will find it easier to retain the brave front they have managed to put up amid such adversity.

 Shehnai maestro Bismillah Khan and the Muslim community in Benaras showed exemplary solidarity with the Hindus after the gruesome attack on the Sankat Mochan temple. The precedent deserves to be emulated in other parts of the country as well. Although the blasts in Jama Masjid were of low intensity and, fortunately, caused no death, Hindus would have done well had they extended a helping hand to the victims.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The blasts at Jama Masjid seem to be an attempt to show that Muslims are a persecuted lot in Hindu India. If this is the aim behind it, Indians need to be extra cautious of malevolent forces which want to drive a wedge between Hindus and Muslims of the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? The Central government must draw a lesson from the bomb blasts, which have occurred at regular intervals over the last two years, and bring pressure on neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan, which might be involved in the militant attacks. India?s peace talks with Pakistan and the starting of a bus service between the two countries must have made Pakistan feel that India continues to be a soft target. To salvage its image, the government at the Centre must rethink its decision on the abolition of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, without which terrorism cannot be tackled.

 Yours faithfully,

K.G. Acharya, Mumbai 

 Sir ? The bomb attack inside Jama Masjid once again raises questions about India?s security. The reason why India has become so vulnerable is because it has refused to stand up to its enemies. Before it is too late, India should send a clear message to those who perform such diabolic deeds that they will be paid back in their own coin. India should follow in the footsteps of the powerful nations of the world, hunt down the terrorists, ?smoke them out?, and give them no further chance to disturb the peace of the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

Joyeeta Dey, Calcutta

 Sir ? While we were assuring ourselves by saying that Muslims are the only menace to world peace, the prayers of the religious at Jama Masjid were cruelly disrupted by the twin bomb blasts. Unfortunate as these blasts undoubtedly are, they should help convince people that all terrorists are not Muslims. For it is unlikely that Muslims would bomb a place sacred to them.

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Memories by the river

Shakuntala : The play of memory (Penguin, 

Rs 200) by Namita Gokhale tells the story of a woman who is visited 

by memories of her previous life on the ghats of Benaras. In her remembered 

life, she is Shakuntala, a near incarnation of Kalidasas legendary heroine. Like 

her namesake, she too is made to suffer the samskaras of abandonment 

for loving unwisely. Hungry for adventure, she runs away with a Greek horse merchant 

she meets by the Ganga. Together, the couple travel extensively, giving in to 

lascivious pleasures. Shakuntala turns into Yaduri, the fallen woman, and her 

story ends tragically. The writing is languid, if not somewhat mushily titillating: 

There were no barriers between us, no boundaries to our joy... Playing hide-and-seek 

with our kisses, we would find ourselves lost in our reflections, each in the 

other, and then in the reflections of the reflections.

Satyr of the subway (Penguin, Rs 200) 

by Anita Nair is a re-issue of the authors collection of short stories 

first published in 1997, with three new stories added. The revised edition includes 

occasional alterations of characters and plots of the previous stories. The end-product 

is a recycle of an already published volume, one which had been critically acclaimed 

on its first publication. Set almost exclusively in New York, particularly in 

the Manhattan subway, the stories are charmingly written, bristling with suppressed 

giggles, which burst into wild laughter from time to time. The subtitle Urban 

tales captures the ambience perfectly.

 HINDUTVA (Penguin, Rs 200) by Jyotirmaya Sharma is subtitled Exploring the Idea of Hindu Nationalism. Looking at four influential thinkers Dayanand Saraswati, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Aurobindo and V.D. Savarkar the book tries to understand: Who is a Hindu? What is Hinduism? Sharma summarizes difficult philosophical ideas lucidly, and concludes that the need is to devise an alternative metaphysics by generating a rethinking of the premises upon which Hinduism ought to confront modernity.

Exploring speech amp; language (National 

Book Trust, Rs 55) by Medha S. Rajadhyaksha is a popular science 

book, examining how and why speech and language are generated by the human brain. 

Using diagrams and experiments, the author shows how the brain processes the language 

we use in various situations.

 LEGENDS, DEAD AND LIVING

 Rukmini Devi

 Freeing the Spirit The Iconic Women of Modern India Edited by Malvika Singh

 Penguin, Rs 295

 This is a mixed bag of delights and disappointments. The constellation of icons in Freeing the Spirit is truly remarkable. It includes as many past legends as those living, and takes its pick from the world of music, art, social welfare, industry and politics. But the book fails to escape the killjoy predictability that haunts such lofty projects. Most of the biographies turn out to be hagiographies. Besides, there is the usual preponderance of the Nehru-Gandhis (Sonia and Indira Gandhi in consecutive chapters), which appears to have become an inescapable affliction where Indias modernity is concerned.

 Most of the essays are by those who knew the women in their personal capacities as close relatives, disciples, co-workers or admirers. In this league, there is Subhashini Ali Sahgal tracing her mother Lakshmi Sahgals remarkable life from a carefree student of medical science to commander of the womens wing of the Indian National Army. There is Jaya Jaitly reconstructing the life and hardships of Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay. Malvika Singh celebrates Pupul Jayakar, Reeta Devi Mother Teresa, Leela Samson Rukmini Devi Arundale and Nitin Bhayana the enigma that is Amrita Sher-Gil. The writers have either worked closely with the path-breakers or followed diligently in their footsteps. The proximity tells on their accounts, which often become salutary notes expounding at length on the greatness of the women. It is Reeta Devis quirky humour that somehow lifts her write-up on Mother Teresa from the ordinariness of the others. 

 The other category of writers consists of critics and journalists who recount their encounters with their famous subjects or give an overview of their lives. There is S. Kalidas on Begum Akhtar. Piecing together anecdotes and first person accounts of the singers acquaintances, Kalidas presents a rare picture of the fibbing, languorous Akhtari Bai, who depended on her sorrow to provide her talent the full ballast. T.J.S. George views Nargis as the key behind R.K. Films success, the bearer of the true Fifties spirit, who served her art and family with the same commitment she showed to other worthy causes. Bhawana Somaaya pays Lata Mangeshkar as much homage possible within the confines of a small chapter. 

 In the same category are the accounts of Amma, Mayavati and Sonia Gandhi. They are written by a crop of journalists who are supposed to specialize in all manners of circumspection. But Shikha Trivedys study of Mayavati alone makes the mark. Sushila Ravindranaths article on Jayalalithaa sounds distinctly adulatory despite pretending to be otherwise. The one that takes the cake is Tarun J. Tejpal on Sonia Gandhi. Sample this: Does she mean well? Does she have fortitude? Can she lead her party? Do the people back her? Has she earned our respect? 

 Yes. Yes. Yes.

 Naazneen Karmali on Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw will satisfy the curiosity of all those wanting to know the secret behind the ladys phenomenal success. Apart from their business acumen, entrepreneurs like Mazumdar-Shaw owe a lot to their mothers and their luck. The two most remarkable essays in this collection are those by Ganesh N. Devy on Mahasweta Devi and Sunil Khilnani on Indira Gandhi. Devy scores because of the personal touch which swamps many of the other biographers, and Khilnani because of his unique insight into the politics of this country and the politics of biographical writing.

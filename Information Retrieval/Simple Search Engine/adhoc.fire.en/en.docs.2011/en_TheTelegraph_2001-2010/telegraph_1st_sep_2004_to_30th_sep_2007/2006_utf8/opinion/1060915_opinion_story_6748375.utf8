An eye on the inner world

 Opening scene: Early memoirs of a dramatist amp; a play (Penguin, Rs 200) by Adya Rangacharya brings the spotlight back on a man who devoted his life to theatre. Rangacharya, Shriranga, as he came to be known, was a brilliant dramatist who is credited with bringing women to the stage, and lending a touch of dignity to the profession. Shriranga also had a life outside the stage. He was one of the colossal figures in Kannada literature, producing a vast body of work that touched upon numerous genres. Shashi Deshpandes lucid translation manages to capture the enchanting moments of an eventful life quite effectively. 

 Night of the Dark Trees (Penguin, Rs 325)by Abraham Eraly is yet another literary attempt to untangle complex human relationships. Biochemist-turned-artist, Zerubbabel is not just struggling with a preposterous name. He battles other inner demons too, even as he flees the oppresive confines of his dilapidated ancestral home to lead the life of a recluse on a Madras beach. Zerubbabels woes are heightened by the women who flit in and out of his life. There is Lakshmi, an intelligent girl from the slums who becomes his companion, Aditi, the wild, rich heiress, with whom he has a turbulent marriage and finally Anjali who brings a semblance of stability to his life. The plot is tiringly repetitive, much like Zerubbabels dalliances.

Tiger! (Hodder/Headline, 3.50) by Geoffrey Malone takes us to the forests of central India where the tigress, Kuma is busy teaching the art of survival to her cubs. The jungle is a dangerous place for the babies and Kuma keeps an eye on pythons, wild dogs and male tigers. But then, her most dangerous adversory is no animal. He walks on two legs and carries a gun. Thankfully Kuma is not alone. There is Anji, Himal and their father, Inspector Singh, who are on a mission to rid the forests of poachers. Unfortunately, Malone is no Jim Corbett and his book fails to capture the magic of the Indian forest. This only shows that Malone has a long way to go before he earns his stripes.

 Gulabi talkies and other stories (Penguin, Rs 250) by Vaidehi lifts the veil off a secret world of women. The stories depict the societal oppression with a dose of wry humour and are compassionate accounts of ordinary women battling heavy odds to survive among people who have stopped caring.

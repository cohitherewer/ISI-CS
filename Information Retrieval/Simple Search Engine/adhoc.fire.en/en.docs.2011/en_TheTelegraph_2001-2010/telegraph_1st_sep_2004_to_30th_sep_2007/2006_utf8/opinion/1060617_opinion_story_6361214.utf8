 Letters to Editor

 Madness and cruelty

 Sir ? Lunatics on the streets are treated abominably by the so-called ?sane? people of our city. They are often subject to mental and physical torture. We have no right to hurt them just because they cannot retaliate. The number of such people is increasing alarmingly. Measures are yet to be taken by either the Central or state government or any other charitable organization to rehabilitate them. The ministries concerned should spare them some attention and arrange for their treatment since they, like any of us, have fundamental rights to food and shelter.

 Yours faithfully,

 Dipankar Das, Calcutta

 Drink to health

 Sir ? The report, ?Don?t fatten the nation, minister tells stars?(June 10), is an ironic dig at a nation, half of which continues to starve. Making celebrities responsible for cardiac problems and obesity in affluent urban families consuming junk food and soft drinks is stretching the argument too far. One does not deny that spicy food and aerated drinks raise sugar levels and kill appetite. But can the government prevent such ailments by dissuading celebrities from endorsing products? If the products are harmful for society, then the government can enforce laws and launch awareness campaigns to persuade consumers to stop buying these goods. Just as the anti-tobacco campaign has not succeeded in reducing oral cancer in India, making stars quit endorsing chips and fizzy drinks will hardly help in creating a healthier nation.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, has been very practical in asking screen idols and cricketers not to campaign for soft drinks because of their hazardous effects on youngsters. Earlier too, Ramadoss had invited Shah Rukh Khan for a media drive against smoking when the star had quit the habit. It is senseless to exempt cola drinks from printing their ingredients on the bottles in the name of protecting their trade secret. All packaged foods have ingredients printed on their packs. So why not soft drinks? The government and soft drink manufacturers should revive Indian traditional beverages to not only replace colas but also dominate the global market. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 Sir ? It seems that our health minister needs to get some facts right about soft drinks and their harmful effects. The sugar content of these drinks is what makes the consumers prone to diabetes and obesity. But diet drinks are free from sugar and contain negligible calories. Thus, the consumption of diet soft drinks cannot cause such ailments. Maybe, A. Ramadoss should revise his biochemistry lessons and appeal to the Indian stars only to promote diet soft drinks. He should also try to ensure that the people get to consume better-quality food. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kunal Saha, Columbus, US 

 Not poetic justice

 Sir ? Banning English nursery rhymes in government schools by the Madhya Pradesh government can only make lessons dull for little children (?Bye-bye black sheep in MP?, June 14). For years, children have loved ?Twinkle, twinkle, little stars? and Mother Goose poems. Teaching Indian folklore by force to those just initiated into learning will never work. Though written by foreign poets, the rhymes have become an integral part of education in urban as well as rural schools of India. After all, young children love nature, which is beautifully depicted in the simple stanzas. The self-styled authorities have no business prohibiting these poems from being included in kindergarten school curricula. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Das, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STAY TOUGH

 Hell hath no fury like a mild-mannered man whose anger is underestimated. Mr Manmohan Singh is not known to lose either his shirt or his temper. But clearly he is at the end of his tether so far as Pakistan is concerned. After the blasts in Srinagar and Mumbai, Mr Singh made clear his belief that Pakistan was sponsoring terrorist violence against India, and was protecting terrorists. He followed up these allegations by calling off the scheduled talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries. The message from the prime minister to Islamabad is thus loud and clear. India will have nothing to do with a country that refuses to take action against terrorist groups operating from its territory. This strong position of the prime minister is welcome because it was long overdue. Pakistan has been allowed for too long to cock a snook at all gestures of goodwill made by India. The utter indifference of the Pakistan government to the attacks on innocent people in Mumbai was evident from the comments of Pakistan?s foreign minister, Mr Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, who said that the Mumbai blasts were an inevitable outcome of the unresolved dispute over Jammu and Kashmir. This statement was rightly interpreted by the government of India as a very thinly-veiled justification of the attacks. The subsequent attempts to backtrack only made matters worse.

 Every single terrorist attack in India carries Pakistan?s fingerprints. Official denials from the capital of Pakistan pale into irrelevance in the context of Dawood Ibrahim?s presence in Pakistan, and the links that groups like Lashkar-i Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad have with that country. India has not ceased to point this out, nor has it failed to draw attention to the fact that terrorist training camps continue to flourish on Pakistan?s soil. The government of Pakistan, whatever its public posture, has either failed to stop these camps or refuses to do so. This is not a situation that India can continue to tolerate. In the G-8 summit being held in St Petersburg, Mr Singh must continue to push the hard line he has adopted. He must make it clear to the G-8 countries, especially the United States of America, that Mr Pervez Musharraf has been less than sincere in his battle against terrorism. Faced with Mr Musharraf?s insincerity, Mr Singh must convince the world that he is sincere in his tough stand against Pakistan.

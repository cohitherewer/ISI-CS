 RULERS IN THEIR BOXES

 Mala Fide - Malvika Singh

 The forest rights bill, as it is called, has passed muster in the Lok Sabha but needs to be ratified by the upper house before it is notified to become an act. All the other existing acts of parliament that have desperately tried to protect a fast-diminishing natural habitat will be totally negated once this new and utterly populist replacement act comes into play. Fading politicians with their failed and predictable political norms and ethics have managed to put the final nail in the coffin of our rapidly degrading environment. Their progeny will suffer at the hands of natural calamities that will envelop and destroy future generations of Indians. That is the legacy they will have left behind because of their short-term greed for political gains based on half-baked knowledge which is far more dangerous than no knowledge at all.

 Suddenly, over the last few days, sleepy and silent environmentalists, who never joined the debate or the battle over the last year from the time the bill was initiated to the day it was tabled, are now up in arms. Those weak and wimp-like self-styled environmentalists, who curry favour by remaining quiet when their colleagues take up the cudgels and initiate debate, only wake up when the damage is done, joining the chorus of the correct voices. What a terrible blow to the natural environment, said one such celebrity. We must fight to stop this from being ratified as an act of parliament because it will spell the death knell of the green cover of our land. Sick. These people are true renegades, victims of selfish public posturing and kowtowing to governmental authority from whom they could possibly get future largesse, post or position.

 Immune to criticism

 The all-pervasive, superficial and limited information syndrome, along with an abdication of open and energetic debate, has reduced governance and policy-making to an abysmal level, a level that, more often than not, is embarrassing and shameful. Inexperienced, unread, behind-the-times, unable-to-comprehend new methodologies and systems, Indian bureaucrats and politicians are damaging the polity with their simplistic comprehension of the realities around them. That class of people has become immune to criticism and ruthless appraisal because they have learned well how to manipulate a corroded system to meet their selfish and parochial ends. Poverty, not caste, is the leveller in India. The poor need to pull themselves out of the mire of 60 years of sheer neglect. They will clutch on to anything that has the potential of generating income for them and for their children. Therefore, once the forest is returned to communities that were once forest-dwellers, the new generation tribal will be able to sell the timber on his patta of land for a good price, using a small percentage to silence the supervising authority as has been the norm over decades. It has torn the fabric of our polity.

 This corrupting of the system that rules us, and regulates our lives, has taken its toll and is compelling the violence and anarchy that we are forced to live with. It has set India back by decades. If this trend is permitted to continue, India will soon become a modern and frightening banana republic. The edges have frayed, the weave has loosened and the best of our traditions, ethics and values are disappearing through this sieve. Insular and isolated rulers with their advisors seem oblivious to the breakdown as they choose not to look at anything outside of their enclosed and protected spaces. But, if history is anything to go by, such ivory-tower politics stem from weakness of purpose and action, never from commitment and strength.

 As we leave behind another year,we should ask: do our leaders have a passion to fulfil their obligations to the people? Do they have the ability to step out of their rusted frame and think anew? Are they able?

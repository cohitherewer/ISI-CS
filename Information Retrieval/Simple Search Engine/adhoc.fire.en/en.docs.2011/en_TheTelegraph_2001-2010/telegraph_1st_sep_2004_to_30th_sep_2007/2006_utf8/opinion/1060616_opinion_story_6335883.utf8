 WONDER-KID

 - The boy from Bauru speaks his mind 

 High priest

Pel eacute;: The Autobiography With Orlando Duarte 

and Alex Bellos, Simon amp; Schuster, $ 11.25

 ?The greatest goal I scored was a one-two with Celeste: we named him Edson Arantes do Nascimento: Pel??

 ? Dondinho, Pel??s father

 Pel? ? at least, the narratorial voice in The Autobiography ? oscillates between self-abnegation and self-glorification. After attributing a goal to god, Pel? points out how it was he, and he alone, who possessed the special skill that put the ball in the net. This is a pattern that more or less repeats itself throughout the book, only changing scale after the wonder-kid had become famous. 

 Leaving aside the legendary rags-to-riches story of the thin black kid who worked as a shoeshine boy, this ?autobiography?, in its most readable bits, offers a curious insight into the life and times of the part of Brazil Pel? hails from. Unfortunately, as the narrative progresses and football takes centre-stage, the richness of context weakens. The very second sentence of the opening chapter says, ?Memory is like a film which we alone can watch.? Three histories are woven together as Pel? talks about his childhood: his personal history, the local history of the towns in which he lived, and the history of Brazil. The mystery surrounding the name of the place ? Tr?s Cora??es ? where Pel? was born bears an analogy, albeit forced, to the confusing and conflicting theories pertaining to the coining of the name the world would come to know him by. 

 Autobiography is a dishonest genre. This one, too, must be read with an eye to precisely what it does not say. Pel? seems quite certain that he would not have been Pel? had he not been born in Brazil. Indeed, it is impossible to separate the man from the larger context of the land. Brazil made him. And yet, at the end of it all, one comes away with the feeling that Pel? is Brazil. 

 It helps to resist the temptation of exegesis, and lap up the football and the childhood anecdotes. Pel? tells us how, on the train journey to Bauru, where the family moved when Pel? was four, he nearly fell out of a carriage window trying to see the front of the train and its plume of smoke. He philosophizes such close shaves by saying that god was keeping an eye on him and preserving him for a very different destiny. 

 Among the relationships poignantly and lovingly portrayed, there is the one between father and son. Jo?o Ramos do Nascimento (Dondinho), Pel??s father, was a footballer of no meagre talent. Familial responsibilities, ill luck and a nasty accident put paid to his dreams of making it big in the domestic league. He knew his football and in the gallery of star trainers and players who helped Pel? hone his skills, he deserves a place of honour. It was the dream which the father had come so close to realizing that the son would make his own. Pel??s mother, Celeste, comes across as an interesting character who did not get her own plans for her son?s future right. The psychological and pecuniary trauma, which Dondinho?s pursuit of the then insecure profession of football had caused the family, would not give her any comfort in Pel??s growing stature and prospects. 

 The loss to Uruguay in the 1950 World Cup had left Brazil a devastated and desperate nation, and the 1958 victory in Sweden would complete a cycle begun at the Maracan? eight years back. Pel? came to embody the hopes, the trials and the triumphs of his nation. The title of the chapter following the Sweden episode ? ?Joy and Pain? ? catches this radical metamorphosis in his life. Pel? had become an international celebrity set on a trajectory that would make him the ?target man? in the next two World Cups, seal his legend in 1970 and land him among the high and mighty. On September 27, 1977, the United Nations made him a ?Citizen of the World?. This is an honour that befits the greatest footballer on earth if one keeps in mind the popular opinion that football, along with sex, is one of the two universal languages. But the man?s own reactions to the changes in his life come from the lexicon of clich?s.

 Born in a Catholic country and a rather religious family, Pel? admits at the start that he is a very religious person. But, given his own experience, particularly his flamboyant carnal career, he summarily dismisses moralizing on sex as life-denying. 

 Two other relationships that get significant space are those Pel? had with Waldemar de Brito and Garrincha. The on-pitch football stories offer little that is new, but one could justifiably expect a freshness of perspective offered by the man himself. The perspective is there but not the power and precision of expression. Language and style invariably slip every couple of paragraphs, and incidents of consequence are rushed through while banalities are repeatedly worked into the reader?s head. Perhaps there is a hint of poetry, after all (apart from the poetry of football), in the associative logic the narrator constantly uses to connect disparate things.

 In his preface, Pel? affirms his conviction that football would have been different without Brazil ? ?the Brazil teams of 1958, ?62 and ?70 brought football to the whole world, made people fall in love with it.? It is this sense of an amorphous community of players and spectators, the blend of brotherhood and self-seeking, that makes football a religion. And the priest must sincerely perform the service with an eye to aesthetics but not the outcome. ?The ambition should always be to play the elegant game? and ?to know how to lose?.

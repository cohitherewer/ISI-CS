The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Be afraid, be very very afraid ? because the Big B is angry. But then, you would be too, if your wife were lured into politics ? against her, and your, wish ? only to be dragged into unnecessary controversies, ending in her disqualification as an MP. If sources are to be believed, Amitabh Bachchan blames Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh for Jaya Bachchan?s parliamentary stint being a resounding flop. The superstar is also opposed to his wife continuing in politics, and nothing could have revealed this better than Amar Singh?s own comment, ?Amitji to nahin chahte hain, par hum Jayaji ko phir wapas layenge?. As if this were not enough, rumours are flying thick and fast that Amitabh in hindsight is also upset with his Samajwadi friend over his family?s rift with 10 Janpath. Over the last few years, Amar Singh has been most photographed in the company of Anil Ambani and Bachchan senior. Ambani is already known to be distancing himself from the Samajwadi Party no. 2. Is a bigger rift in the offing too?

 Talking of rifts, here?s another one. The BJP and the JD(U) are no longer happy together in Bihar. Proof? The JD(U) chief minister, Nitish Kumar, is not planning to host a reception for the BJP big boss, LK Advani, when he comes atop his rath to Bihar. There is, of course, a shrewd political calculation behind Nitish Kumar?s move. To endorse the rath yatra would be to hand over a huge advantage ? and perhaps a substantial chunk of the JD(U)?s minority vote bank ? to Lalu Prasad on a platter. Nitish has gone a step further and hosted a dinner recently for the Bihar Pradesh Congress chief, Sadanand Singh. Just one little move, and Nitish has probably ensured a few extra sops from the Centre and also driven a wedge between Lalu and the Congress. 

 Dear old Advaniji will not only miss out on a hero?s welcome in Bihar, but there might be a few other irritants ? of the RSS kind ? waiting for him. A rather evocative email message sent by an old Vishwa Hindu Parishad activist begins with the question, ?Are you a secularist?? And goes on to ask the following: There are 52 Muslim countries but show one which provides the Haj subsidy; Show one Muslim country where Hindus are extended special rights that Muslims are granted in India; Show one country where the 85 per cent majority craves for the indulgence of the 15 per cent minority; Show one Muslim country which has a non-Muslim as its president or prime minister; When Christian and Muslim schools can teach the Bible and the Quran, why cannot Hindus teach the Gita and the Ramayana; If Muslims and Christians can enjoy minority rights in Maharashtra, UP, Bihar, why cannot Hindus enjoy minority status in Jammu and Kashmir, Mizoram, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya? Would Advani, what with his new-found love for Jinnah, please explain to the VHP ideologues that the comparison just does not work, because India is not a ?Hindu? country that can be pitted against ?Muslim? countries, and that it is a secular state?

 Abhishek Manu Singhvi is a man who could do justice to the famous Dickensian opening line: ?It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.? On the one hand, the Congress spokesman has bagged a prestigious Rajya Sabha berth, but on the other, his role during the office-of-profit crisis has not exactly been salutary. To make matters worse, only the prime minister was spotted at the recent launch of Singhvi?s book. On being prodded, Singhvi explained Sonia Gandhi?s absence by saying that madam had other pressing engagements. If he had jogged his memory a bit, Singhvi would have remembered how Arjun Singh held his 75th birthday celebrations in April instead of October just so madam could attend. Tut, tut, lessons not learnt, Mr Singhvi!

 How absurd of people to keep connecting every other Bollywood controversy to the Congress-Samajwadi Party feud! When Dia Mirza?s imported Lexus was impounded recently by the enforcement agencies, even that was attributed to her closeness to a Samajwadi Party leader. But what about Suneil Shetty, Sushmita Sen, Salman Khan and all the rest whose imported beauties have landed them in trouble with the authorities? Surely the whole of Bollywood is not the Samajwadi oyster?

 Will Big B fight madam in Rae Bareilly, as some wags speculate? Now that?s called a clash of the titans.

 If Sonia Gandhi?s resignation had come a year ago, who would be the first person to get wind of it, or to rush to 10 Janpath? Ambika Soni, of course. And where was Soni when the drama actually took place? Believe it or not, in Australia. Of course, Soni made amends as soon as she came back, and tried to score a few brownie points in the process too. She met a few of her favourite journos, and reminded them that had Ghulam Nabi Azad (one of Soni?s b?te noires) not floated the idea of according ministerial status to Sonia in 2004, there would have been no crisis in 2006. Not that it reinstated Soni in madam?s good books. That place has already been taken by the veteran Mohsina Kidwai, the only person allowed to accompany Sonia to Rae Bareilly right after the resignation (a privilege denied to both Salman Khurshid and Arjun Singh). Poor Soni, no wonder she is spotted more frequently at the India Fashion Week these days.

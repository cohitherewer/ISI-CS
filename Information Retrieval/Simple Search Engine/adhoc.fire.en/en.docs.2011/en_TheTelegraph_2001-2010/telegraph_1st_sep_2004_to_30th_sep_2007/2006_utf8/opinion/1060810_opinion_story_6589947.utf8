The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DO NOT LOOK

 In a democracy, policemen should not have to enter art galleries unless they like looking at pictures. But galleries in cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Vadodara often have uniformed visitors who are not particularly interested in art. They come in to shut down exhibitions because of complaints from people who react oddly to representations of the naked human body. The Colaba police in Mumbai have asked Mr Sanjeev Khandekar and Ms Vaishali Narkar, who are showing their work at the Jehangir Art Gallery, to cover their nude paintings and sculptures. The artists have done so, but with black cloth as a mark of protest. A viewer had found some of their exhibits offensive, and had complained to the police. The terms of her objection are significant. Art, she claims, can come from either heaven or hell, and she minds having to look at the latter. Besides, she had gone to a convent school where she was hit on the knuckles for using slang.

 To think of a democracy as a vengeful classroom is to miss, profoundly, the point of the former. Art galleries are public spaces, which not only celebrate the freedom of expression, but also allow people to choose not to visit them, or to leave if they do not like what they see. The need to deprive adults of this right to choose and decide stems from a kind of self-important prudishness that overturns some vitally important aspects of an enlightened society. More than half a century ago, Mr Akbar Padamsee was subjected to the same sort of nonsense because of his erotic paintings. But an Indian court had ruled then that art shown in a gallery cannot be deemed pornographic. Viewers have a right to be offended, and to express their objections publicly, but they have no right to demand that the rest of the public be barred from viewing the exhibition. To help art maintain its unhindered traffic with heaven as well as hell is essential to human civilization.

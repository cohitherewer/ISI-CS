 UNDER A NEW BOSS

Rabindra Sen

 As this year draws to a close, one of the critical issues doing the rounds in the international arena is the election of the new United Nations secretary-general who will succeed Kofi Annan, whose second term expires at the end of 2006. Indians are particularly interested in the matter since one of the high-profile contenders for the coveted post is an Indian. 

 But more important than the question of succession is what the role of the new secretary-general will be. The future of the UN being the subject of an intense debate, this election assumes greater importance than it would otherwise have. The crucial question is whether Annans successor will be able to take the UN along the desired path of reform and restore faith in the world body. The UN had once been described as the best hope for mankind. Today, some question its very utility. So this is a moment when one must hope that the newcomer will fulfil not only the aspirations that lay behind the UNs formation, but also those arising out of current challenges.

 The secretary-general is appointed by the UN general assembly by a two-thirds vote on the recommendation of the UN security council. The greatest hurdle is agreement on a candidate by all the five permanent members of the security council. Stalemates are an usual threat and the term of the first secretary-general had to be extended by the general assembly without concurrence by the security council. 

 Being the only official who represents all the organs and members of the UN, the secretary-general has special responsibility in safeguarding the principles of the UN charter.Compared to the League of Nations, the UN secretary-general has been given far wider powers. In practise, the role of the secretary-general has expanded beyond the anticipations of the architects of the charter.

 The road ahead

 The sixth secretary-general, Boutros-Boutros Ghali was perhaps the most independent minded in the history of the organization. So much so that he refused to play lame duck to the United States of America. Hence, he was the target of a US veto and the first sitting secretary-general to be denied a second term. Kofi Annan, who succeeded Boutros Ghali, is the first black African in the prestigious post. Annans first major initiative as the secretary-general was an attempt at reforming the UN, and this has since been pursued. In April 2000, he issued a Millennium Report, calling on member states to commit themselves to an action plan for ending poverty and inequality, improving education, reducing HIV/AIDS, safeguarding the environment and protecting people from deadly conflict and violence. The Millennium Report formed the basis of the Millennium Declaration adopted by heads of state and government at the Millennium Summit, held at the UN headquarters in September 2000. Conferring the Nobel Peace Prize on the UN and its secretary-general in December 2001, the Nobel Committee said that Annan had been pre-eminent in bringing new life to the organization. 

 Whoever becomes the next secretary-general has to steer the organization through the turbulence of the times. It is for him to strive for the best, under all constraints, and make the UN work toward world peace and for the betterment of man. While conferring the Nobel Prize on the world body, the Nobel Committee said that it wished to proclaim that the only negotiable road to global peace and cooperation goes by way of the United Nations. The UN can succeed only if there is a strong commitment and desire in member states to use its services. Annans successor will be responsible for making the world body more relevant, useful and effective, an organization which is strengthened by the willingness of member countries to stand by it, rather than allow it to descend into insignificance.

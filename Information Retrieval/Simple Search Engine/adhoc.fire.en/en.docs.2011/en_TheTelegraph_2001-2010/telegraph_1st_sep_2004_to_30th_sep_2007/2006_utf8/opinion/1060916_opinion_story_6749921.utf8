The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WRONG GOAL

 One of the remaining illusions of an illusionless age is the belief that when prime ministers meet, they discuss matters of great pitch and moment. That illusion is set to dissolve in the cold light of reality. Reports coming out of Brasilia bring the tidings that when the heads of the governments of Brazil and India met, they spent some time discussing football. It seemed to have been common ground between the leaders that one of the things India could learn from Brazil was football, and an agreement was signed between the two countries on greater cooperation in that particular sphere. There are no indications that when the agreement was signed, the leaders of the two countries had their tongues close to their cheeks. On the contrary, the discussions were informed by a degree of seriousness. Indeed, the matter should not be taken lightly.

 There can be two very serious objections to the proposal of seeking the cooperation of the Brazilian government to improve the condition of football in India. Assuming for the sake of argument that improving the standard of football should be one of the priorities of the government, it should be noted that the best football coaches do not come from Brazil. Brazil makes top-class ball players but not the best coaches. It has been held by most soccer experts that the excellence of Brazillian football is rooted in native talent. The real strength of Brazillian football lies in the incredible natural skills that the players have. This is where the type of football played by Brazil differs from the football played by European teams. The latter excel in discipline and team work, Brazil in natural talent. Thus, it is not surprising that European football is more coach-dependent, and the best coaches come from Europe. If the government of India wants to go coach-hunting, its representatives should visit the European capitals. The more important issue relates to whether the government should at all be involved in looking for football coaches. Football across the globe has become highly professionalized and market forces prevail. Those looking after football in India should, if they so desire and if they have the resources, go out and hire the best coach.

 The above discussion underscores an even more fundamental discomfort. Mr Manmohan Singh, as a proud and sensitive Indian, should accept that there is something unbecoming about his signing an agreement with his Brazillian counterpart on cooperation in the realm of football. Indians expect something better from their prime minister, especially from someone like Mr Singh. Given the precedence set in Brasilia, it will not be unreasonable to expect that when the Indian prime minister meets the president of Pakistan, Mr Pervez Musharraf, in Havana, he might request the general for some help in swing bowling in cricket. The general is an acknowledged expert on reverse swing.

 TIME TO LIFT THE VEIL

 THIS ABOVE ALL KHUSHWANT SINGH

 It must be over 60 years ago when I was living in Lahore that the lady principal of the Government College for Women invited me to address her students. I accepted the invitation readily without realizing what I was letting myself in for. I was escorted to the principals office. She happened to be Christian. She introduced me to the members of her staff, some of whom happened to be men. She approached the subject very gently. Many of our students come from highly conservative Muslim families where purdah is strictly observed. Girls come in burqas, leave them in the cloak room and after classes get over, they put them on to return home. I was slow in the uptake. But you have men teachers as well. Do girls then put on their burqas? She smiled and replied, No, we put male teachers in purdah. Thats what we will do to you. I was taken aback. I was shown a classroom meant for male teachers. In front of the teachers chair was stretched a thin grey curtain. So the teacher could not see his students, nor could the students see their teacher. I came back to the principals office and told her as firmly as I could, I am sorry Madam, I will not speak to your students. Please forgive me. And took my leave.

 I see in the papers that Jack Straw, member of the cabinet in the British government, was in the same predicament. A part of his constituency has a sizeable population of Pakistani, Indian and Bangladeshi Muslims. When he went to speak to them, he saw lot of women in burqas. He refused to speak, saying that he was unable to talk to people he could not see. The mullah-taliban were up in arms protesting against his anti-Muslim attitude. It was nothing of the sort. A vast majority of my friends happen to be Muslims: Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshis. Not one of their women wears a burqa. Ive been to Pakistan many times and have noticed that burqas are becoming rarer and rarer. This is true of most Muslim countries. Working-class women never veiled themselves, the upper and middle class did (as did Hindus and Sikhs). They discarded their veils almost overnight after Independence in 1947. Today, only the lower, the illiterate or semi-literate, or the lower middle class cling on to it with the backing of bigoted mullahs. In fact, the burqa has become an outward symbol of jehaalat ignorance. It has no religious sanctity. If Muslims really mean to catch up with the modern world, the sooner they liberate their women of the restraints of the purdah, the better.

 Monkeys are a nuisance

 Ive been on good terms with monkeys in past years. They are of two kinds langoors and bunders (rhesus). They take turns in taking over my roof and garden. I am often woken up by one or the other when they scamper over my corrugated tin roof. I can tell which kind it is: langoors, though bigger in size, are nimble and make less noise: bunders are fat and clumsy and shake the roof as they thunder over it. They take turns over my garden too; when langoors are around, they keep away. Bunders are more numerous at times almost three dozens of them around my house. The tough ones keep guard while their harems and babalog with big heads and round eyes camper round their mamas as they pick grass seeds. I watch them, they watch me. It is only when they try to walk over a tin pipe which channels rain water from the roof to two storage tanks that I shoo them off. They are also too heavy for the fragile tin conduit. I have had to replace it a few times. They growl at me, bare their teeth and make menacing noises. I should abuses at them, O ulloo kay patthey bhaag idhar se. I usually win these unfought battles and peace is restored. This year our equations changed. For reasons unknown to me both species have become aggressive. One evening I saw three hefty bunders sitting on the stone bench in my garden. That was unusual as there were no females or baby monkeys around. They were evidently outsiders. I proceeded to stroll up and down outside my verandah. I noticed the toughest of the three jauntily walk towards my kitchen like a wrestler and go up on the roof. As I was passing by the entrance door to my verandah I saw him a couple of feet above my head growling and ready to pounce on me. I ran indoors in the nick of time and shut the wire-gauze door on its face. I hurled all the vile abuses I know in Punjabi; it continued to growl and challenged me to come out and fight like a man or a monkey. I noticed he had one paw missing.

 Since then I have noticed several other bunders with one or the other arm missing. Dr Santosh Kutty, chief medical officer of the Central Research Institute, explained the phenomenon to me. Monkeys are trapped in Shimla, bound with wires and deposited in Sebathu. In their turn, authorities in Sebathu trap them, bind them and offload them in Kasauli. Likewise, Kasauliwalas catch them and deposit them somewhere in the plains. In due course, the entire lot finds its way back to their original habitats. They bear a grudge against human beings for the callous and cruel treatment they receive and try to settle scores with them. Langoors, though more peace-loving, have also become bellicose. How should we tackle this bunder-langoor problem? We cant sterilize the lot. Many people, including our Nagas, eat them as they eat dogs. But no Hindu, Muslim or Sikh will make them a part of his diet. Has anyone any idea of what we can do besides shifting them from one place to another? Proliferation of monkeys has become an all-India problem.

 Ramadan riddle

 Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib, besides being a great poet, was also known for his ready wit haazir jawaabee. He was known to hit the bottle every evening, gamble and patronize courtesans. Nevertheless, he made it a point to be seen offering namaaz every Friday at the Royal mosque, Jama Masjid. During one Ramadan, the month of fasting, someone asked him caustically: Mirza sahib, aap nay kitney rozey rakhey hain how many days did you observe the fast? Ghalib replied cryptically: Ek din nahin which can mean both not a single day, as well as I missed only one day.

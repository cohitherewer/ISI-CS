 THEIR MASTERS LEGACY

 GANDHI, GANDHISM AND THE GANDHIANS 

 By Thomas Weber, 

 Roli, Rs 395

 While dialectic is the key-word in Marxist social philosophy, harmony is the basis of the Gandhian scheme of things. Truth, for Gandhi, is a ubiquitous concept which has the ability to harmonize apparently conflicting notions. Thomas Webers book, a survey of Gandhis synthetic truth, is the latest of his well-researched treatises on Gandhi. In the first section, he deals with the salt march. Weber traces out the lacunae in historical records with regard to that momentous event, showing how and why myth comes to surround it, and also cautioning that attempts at demythification should not undermine the historical importance of the event itself.

 An interesting chapter is the one on Kharag Bahadur Singh, a Gurkha who was jailed for murder and later became a staunch Gandhian and walked the Dandi march as the 80th marcher. Gandhi had insisted on this in the face of strong opposition from some of his followers. Weber discusses Singhs eventful life, the end of which is still unknown. Weber also scrutinizes the turn of events in international politics that led to Gandhis not being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

 However, the most important aspect of the book is the analysis of Gandhis theory of conflict re- solution. Weber has already published Conflict Resolution and Gandhian Ethics on the subject. In the section, Gandhism, he studies that specific strand of Gandhism which offers strategies to resolve inter-personal and communal conflicts. Webers view is that the role of the mediator is to strengthen the bilateral relationship between the contending parties so that each develops a clear, unbiased perception of the others problem and proceeds accordingly.

 The section, The Gandhians, is about Gandhism after Gandhi, focussing on the differences between two stalwart Gandhians, Vinoba Bhabe and Jayprakash Narayan. Their debate centred mainly on the issue of the role of the Shanti Sainik and its agenda. Bhabe insisted on the bhudan and gramdan movements as the yardstick for building a non-violent society, whereas Narayan additionally recommending direct involvement in political matters like war, especially when the war with China broke out. 

 This difference resulted from forcibly harmonized antinomies that Gandhism incorporates and that even the staunchest Gandhians cannot always interpret properly. Webers book is thus a chronicle of an inner crisis of Gandhism that stalled the movement significantly after Gandhis assassination.

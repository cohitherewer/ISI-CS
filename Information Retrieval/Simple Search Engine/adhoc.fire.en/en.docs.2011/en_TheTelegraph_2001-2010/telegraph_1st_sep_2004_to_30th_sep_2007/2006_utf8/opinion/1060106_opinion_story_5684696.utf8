 ROOM FOR WONDER

 Malvika Singh

 Driving through India, and in this instance through Rajasthan, one connects with the unusual greatness of the fabric of this society, embroidered with the myriad wonders of this very special land, enriched by its resilient people who are the embodiment of many tried and tested traditions. Babar, as he entered Hindustan, proclaimed that there was ?room for wonder? here. He went on to conquer large areas and build an empire that created some of the finest man-made environments in the world, embellished with the workmanship and skills of the people, skills that continue to live and grow even today. 

 The British added their stamp and also set up institutions such as the Asiatic Society, the Archaelogical Survey of India and others to study, preserve and conserve all the many manifestations of a vibrant and layered history. They combed the countryside by foot and on horseback, fell upon spectacular ruins, removed the undergrowth, catalogued what they had discovered, spruced up the space and put endless monuments into conservation by protecting them by charter and law. The bits and pieces scattered around that we see today and that represent hundreds of centuries, other than places of worship, owe their survival to those heroic men and women who cared passionately about the past and used it as a base from which to build for the future without losing the intrinsic strengths and ethos of a multi dimensional society. The British understood well the importance of history. Indians took it for granted. 

 Then came independence and, instead of reconnecting with our varied history and energetic past, we put culture and all that went with it on the back-burner as we tried desperately to become a clone of the world beyond our borders. Our governments tried to impose on this culture, ?contemporary? alien values, ideologies, methods of governance that were not part of the Indian psyche or tradition. These never really worked and slowly the governance of this diverse land descended into the morass of malfunction and corruption that faces us today. 

 For a young nation

 We had ceased to respect the best in our culture, in our philosophies or life patterns, in everything. As clones of the ?other world?, we attained the status of second best. Twenty five years later, as the wheel turned, and as those ideologies that were thrust upon us became rapidly redundant, we were unable to discard them even when the world flung them aside. A great civilization and culture had been mutilated by what it could not stomach. Anarchy captured the space. Then, as a new generation came of age and began to assert itself, the economy started to boom despite the remains of archaic norms that had manipulated a command economy. Those in their fifties and sixties, midnight?s children, damned the rising sensex as an artificial bubble that would most definitely burst. It has not and it will not because it is a symbol of India pushing hard to break the shackles and grow on its own terms. 

 India is one of the youngest nations in the world. The majority of Indians are under 40 years of age. They are raring to rule, to evolve fresh parameters, to carry all economic levels into the future, a future that is theirs, not ours. And we, the first post-independence generation, are not willing to pass the baton as we destruct only to control. We need to rewrite the octopus-like, intrusive, colonial laws that we inherited and were too lazy to change. We need to respect the young, learn from them what their aspirations. We need to energize India and remove all those bureaucratic restrictions that strangulate endeavour and enterprise. We need to pattern a warp that represents India today, and weave into it the colours that have survived, to create an extraordinary fabric ? a contemporary space that leaves ?room for wonder? again.

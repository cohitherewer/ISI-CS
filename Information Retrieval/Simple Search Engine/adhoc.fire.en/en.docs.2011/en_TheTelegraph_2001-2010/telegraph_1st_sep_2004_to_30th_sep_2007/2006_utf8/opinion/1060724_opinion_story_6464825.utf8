 THEIR STORY ON A PLACARD

 Posters used by women?s groups should be archived so that they remain as expressions of social change, writes Rajashri Dasgupta 

 Talking pictures

 For students of political and cultural history, the contemporary Indian women?s movement is a nightmare. Engrossed in street-level protests or in launching aggressive campaigns, the one thing activists tend to overlook is documenting and preserving their own history. They neglect or discard posters and pamphlets, the very tools they use and depend on to mobilize people?s support. Most are consigned to oblivion in rusty trunks, dark corners or even garbage once the events are over, and with these are lost important testimonials to the social history of our times.

 This ephemeral art, in fact, represents an irreplaceable political and cultural heritage. The impact of a bygone period on popular and political culture can still be felt as in the Second World War posters by the German sculptor, Kathe Kollwitz. The posters convey her views in a compelling and aesthetic way, with a signature style that is her very own.

 Since the Seventies, women?s activists chose posters ? an expressive form of visual art ? as a medium for voicing opposing views. At every street corner meeting, demonstration or morcha, activists hung posters on strings or pasted them on walls to motivate and educate the public. Some were irate and confrontational, expressing their anger at an indifferent society; some posters startled viewers with bare statistics, and most involved stunning, bold images with pithy, sharp slogans or demands. The overwhelming imagery that took the centre stage in all these posters was that of women ? women either working, struggling, abused or empowered.

 If women activists raised invaluable and timeless issues, natural elements, on the other hand, conspired to limit the lifespan of these posters. Since most of the early posters of the movement in particular were hand-drawn on used chart paper, old newspapers or the backs of calendars, they were tattered and faded not only from human neglect but also due to the poor quality of the materials used. The posters painted by these early activists-cum-amateur painters were spontaneous and disturbing with piercing political slogans. Later, as the nature of many groups changed, they acquired the help of professionals to design posters and have them mass-printed. While some posters are tedious in comparison to earlier ones, resembling government texts, quite a few them are aesthetic and attractive, combining the symbolism of the streets.

 The damage and loss of these historical records have now been curbed to some extent. Recently, Zubaan, a feminist publishing house, stepped forward to locate, collect and archive posters of the contemporary women?s movement. The outcome of the initiative is Poster Women, an archive of over 1,500 posters, unique in its dynamism and variety, spanning a period of more than three decades of the movement. Though the collection is uneven with the absence of some key campaigns and the lukewarm response of groups from the south, more than 200 groups participated and contributed their work in this effort. Within a span of 18 months, posters of campaigns on issues such as violence, political participation, literacy, health and communalism were retrieved and photographed. While the original prints of the posters will be housed in Sound and Picture for Women, Mumbai, the ?Poster Women? series will be a travelling exhibition across the country for women?s groups to trace their history. ?We hope that as the various groups view and trace their own history through these posters, more material will trickle in and we can salvage and paint a richer history of the movement,? said Urvashi Butalia of Zubaan.

 One of the major concerns of the women?s movement, born out of leftist and peasant struggles, has been violence against women; it is not surprising that most of the posters reflect the theme in a hard-hitting and stark manner. A poster from the Eighties in West Bengal focuses on a real incident of acid attack. Disfiguring women?s faces by throwing acid at them is one of the most common responses from men who have been rejected in love. The poster is poignant with the photograph of the young victim, 14 year-old Chandrani, who died of severe burns. A recent poster by Nistha on child marriage is both comical and sombre. It shows a young village bride fleeing, with the groom shedding copious tears, while the caption reads, ?I want to play and be free as a bird...? Once again, the poster reflects the ground reality ? two teenaged girls in South 24-Parganas fleeing their homes on the day of their marriage. Their friends helped to paint the poster. A printed poster from Maharashtra shows a woman being abused by a man with the caption, ?My parents. This has to change.? The prize-winning entry by a student for a poster competition was put up in various public places and received an overwhelming response.

 One poster on literacy from Uttar Pradesh remains etched in memory, both for its novelty and imagery. It has turned the symbols of women?s oppression on their head. It shows the rolling pin ? as a pen ? and the round base as weapons of literacy with a caption, ?I am no longer feeble. The pen has made me strong and able?. A series of posters on literacy in Hindi with a young peasant girl at the centre stage is effective with thought-provoking slogans. One has a larger-than-life pen in the girl?s hand with a caption, ?I am learning how to write so that I can write my own destiny?. Another has the peasant girl weighing hay with the caption reading, ?I?m learning how to count so that I can keep an account of my own rights.?

 Activists have used the varied imageries of goddesses as another prism through which one can view the struggles of women. A recurring imagery used as a metaphor in many posters is the goddess Durga or Kali, considered by many as a source of strength. However, the metaphor of the many arms of the goddess, that is used to convey the image of the multi-tasking woman, is a familiar sight today. One of the oldest posters in this category by Sachetana shows a woman juggling multiple tasks, stating ?I work for free with my ten hands.? Another poster that has reached iconic status throughout the country and is used widely by women?s groups is that of a goddess with one set of hands lopped off while another set holds weapons, with the cryptic message: ?Empowered, enslaved.?

 Women activists in India can take heart, perhaps, in the knowledge that they are not the only ones to disregard their own history. Revolutionaries in Cuba, China or the Soviet Union lacked the necessary energy when it came to preserving the mass posters of resistance. It is only in the last few decades that museums and universities are feverishly trying to locate and preserve them. Women?s groups should perhaps work on developing a method of archiving their posters in such a way so that they remain as expressions of social advancement and change.

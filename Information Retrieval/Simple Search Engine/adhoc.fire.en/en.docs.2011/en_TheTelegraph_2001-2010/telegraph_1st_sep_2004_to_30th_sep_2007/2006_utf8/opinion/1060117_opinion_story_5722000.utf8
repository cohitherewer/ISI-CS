 Letters to Editor

 Man with a heart

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Survival strategies? (Jan 15), reminds the city of the deaths of Anil Kanti Basu and Pashupati Ghosh while it congratulates itself for having saved Amal Krishna Talukdar. But instead of depending on the whims of the crowd the government should perhaps strengthen its emergency services so that such mishaps are not repeated. There should be a telephone number for people to call up (with a request for an ambulance for example) in cases of such emergency. The ambulance can then go straight to the patient and give him initial resuscitation before taking him to the nearest hospital. What we need is a team of trained paramedical staff, cooperating hospitals and nursing homes, and an authority willing to establish a streamlined service to treat such people. Surely, the government, the police and the medical services can provide these minimum services to its citizens.

 Yours faithfully, 

Arabinda Pal, London, UK

 Sir ? The story of Dinesh Chandra Das makes the youth of India proud (?College student saves man who lay dying on street?, Jan 14). His action was in striking contrast to the recent insensitivity shown by the people of Calcutta. The city either found curious onlookers watching men slowly die on pavements or in telephone booths, or saw those who dared to save the lives of others falsely implicated in police cases. That Dinesh Das?s sense of duty overcame all odds in his bid to save the dying man, sends a powerful signal to the residents of Calcutta as well as to citizens of the country. It is a relief to see that youths, who are the torch-bearers of the country, still retain some moral values and principles despite the fast-deteriorating moral standards in present-day India.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Dinesh Das?s noble gesture deserves to be applauded and it will go a long way in encouraging others to emulate him. The people on the street are always afraid of police harassment and political workers, who were among the onlookers in Talukdar?s case, can hardly be trusted with social service of any serious kind. There are obviously there when it is time to conduct rallies and election campaigns. But when it comes to saving the life of a person, their courage always fails them. 

Yours faithfully, 

S.A. Rahman Barkati, Calcutta 

Sir ? The incident of Amal Krishna Talukdar once again highlights the fact that the laws have to be changed so that the public does not hesitate to help a dying man. There also needs to be a change in the attitude of the police, who inspire no trust in the common man, and for very good reasons. Dinesh Das deserves praise for his actions, but we cannot really blame the others for refusing help as they were mortally afraid of the police. The law-enforcers of the state need to be more approachable if Calcutta is to become a city of benevolent citizens. 

Yours faithfully, 

Nivedita Roy Chowdhury, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Dinesh Chandra Das proves a flicker of hope in this concrete jungle called Calcutta. Had he not come forward to help, Talukdar would have died on the streets. Das reminds us of our duties which we are steadfastly trying to forget. Harassment by the police is one factor partly responsible for the apathy. But the fact that Dinesh Das was allowed to do his work without being thwarted by the police may encourage people to come forward to help others. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Looking back at the recent deaths of two elderly gentlemen because of the callousness of the crowd, one cannot but admire Dinesh Das. This young student has certainly taught a lesson to the people of the city by emphasizing that humanism or fellow-feeling does not come from formal education or urban sophistication, but emerges from within.

 Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 No bar

 Sir ? A judgment of the division bench of the Delhi high court allowing women to serve liquor in bars and pubs in the capital will be welcomed by the right-minded (?High court nod to bar girls?, Jan 13). Section 30 of the Punjab Excise Act, passed in 1914, was imposed at a time when social attitudes towards women were very different. Fortunately, the world has changed. Far from being ?dens of evil?, as they were once supposed to be, bars are now recognized as places where people gather to socialize and do business. Also, except in countries ruled by the cousins of the taliban, women are no longer confined behind the purdah. There is no reason why women cannot share an equal space with men in the hospitality industry as in other professionally competitive areas. The high court has also ensured that women working in hotels are not asked to serve liquor against their wishes. This sends out a warning to all misogynists.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? Allowing women to serve at bars will not only attract more women to bars but the combined charm of both wine and women will lure more men. The entry of women into pubs and bars should actually be prohibited, keeping in mind the recent rape of a drunken woman on the roads of New Delhi. However foreign women may be allowed entry in groups so as not to affect tourism. All professions are not suitable for women. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agarwal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Women have gradually attained prominence in many male-dominated professions. We can now see taxis and autos being driven by women in New Delhi. The high court order only proves that our society is shedding its conservative garb.

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kapasi, New Delhi

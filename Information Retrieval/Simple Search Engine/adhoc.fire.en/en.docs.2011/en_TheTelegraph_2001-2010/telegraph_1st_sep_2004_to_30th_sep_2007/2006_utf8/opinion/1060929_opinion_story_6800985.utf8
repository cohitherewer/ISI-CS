 Crime, cricket and the Buddha

Crime and urbanization: Calcutta in the nineteenth century (Tulika, Rs 295) by Sumanta Banerjee unravels Calcuttas shimmering underbelly during the days of the raj. The citys dank, dark alleys were the lair of a bunch of diabolical characters who alternately attracted and repelled the collective imagination of the population. There was Gobinda Kumar Mitra, fondly described by his English bosses as the dark zamindar, who prayed at the citys tallest temple and hatched nefarious plots at the same time. His namesake, Gobindaram Chakravarty, mastered the art of breaking into the houses of the rich and the famous, while the crafty Shyamacharan Mukhopadhyay forged coins in the shelter of his makeshift mint. There were even two gora chores Warner and Healey who had jumped off the walls of the Harinbari jail. Significantly, Banerjee also traces the changes in theories on crime and punishment in colonial India. For example, he refers to the transition from a socio-economic analysis of crime to a framework which depended largely on biological determinism. Banerjee also shows how a particular approach to criminality also influenced the prevalent forms of punishment. This is an interesting book which brings to light the racy and dangerous side of a city teeming with bhadraloks.

 Dr Johnsons dictionary (John Murray, 5) by Henry Hitchings is the extraordinary story of the book that defined the world. In this book, Hitchings embarks upon recounting Dr Johnsons attempt to create the first great dictionary of the world. Undertaking such a mammoth task was far from easy. It involved putting in long hours of research, moments of utter despair and several costly errors. But then at the end of it, there was the ultimate triumph of accomplishing a literary achievement equivalent of climbing the Everest or walking to the pole.

 The Essence of Buddhism (Arcturus, Rs 200) by Jo Durden Smith is meant for all those who skipped their lectures on world religion. Smith introduces the life of Buddha, his teachings and the ideological foundations of his faith in a style that is lucid and easy to follow. The book should definitely be tucked into the rucksack on a journey in search of the middlepath.

The Indian Masters (Roli, Rs 295) by Bill Ricquier has been written by a lifelong cricket devotee who teaches law for a living. That could explain the meticulous manner with which Ricquier goes about compiling the facts. The book has a perfect blend of statistics, anecdotes and illustrations, which makes reading about Indias finest fifteen cricketers a pleasure. Some may throw a fit at Ricquiers selection though. For instance, Ricquier has no place for the stylish Jaisimha, the ever graceful Hazare or the magic of Chandrasekhar. Yet he has plucked enough courage to include a mediocre player like Ravi Shastri. But then the author has a ready explanation for such glaring omissions. Ricquires XV only includes those players who have played at the highest level (For England or, later, India), performed exceptionally in county cricket and are regarded as rare exponents of the game.

 BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 There is little chance of Israel getting the world to endorse its new border with Palestine

 ?We have a very tight timetable (for drawing Israel?s final borders), because we seek the support of the US administration and President Bush. It has to be done by November 2008,? said Yoram Turbowicz in an interview with the Yediot Ahronot newspaper in April. Turbowicz, who will be chief of staff to Ehud Olmert when the latter takes over as prime minister of Israel?s new government, was only saying publicly what most members of the Kadima party think in private, but it?s interesting how foolish it looks when you see it in cold print.

 Kadima was created only months ago by former prime minister, Ariel Sharon, now in a coma due to a massive stroke, to seize control of the centre of Israeli politics and impose a permanent ?peace? settlement on the Palestinians. In Sharon?s vision, Israel would decide which parts of the occupied territories to keep and draw the new borders unilaterally, marking them out with the huge security fences that are currently carving their way through the West Bank ?- and the Bush administration would ratify the outcome and get the rest of the world to accept it.

 Kadima emerged as the biggest party in last month?s elections and Sharon?s successor, Olmert, who will lead the new coalition government once the usual deals are struck, imagines that he can then carry out Sharon?s grand plan. After all, he has President Bush?s letter of last year to Sharon that drastically changed American policy, declaring that Israel could not be expected to return to its pre-1967 borders ?in light of new realities on the ground, including already existing major Israeli population centers.? Since the United States of America is the world?s sole superpower, surely it can make everybody else accept that outcome too. Just get it all done in the next 32 months, as Turbowicz pointed out, before President Bush leaves office at the end of 2008. 

 But Turbowicz is dead wrong in assuming that US support will be enough to make the change in Israel?s borders legal, permanent, and widely accepted. The world does not work like that, and even if America?s power were as great as Olmert seems to think it is, Washington could not make other countries accept such a gross breach of international law.

 The new international law, written into the United Nations Charter, states that territorial changes imposed by force will not be recognized by UN members. Full stop. It?s about taking the profit out of war and thereby reducing the temptation to go to war, and over sixty years, it is the one UN rule that has almost never been broken. Indonesia conquered East Timor and held it for a quarter of a century, for example, but nobody ever recognized East Timor?s annexation as legal and finally Indonesia had to leave.

 Israel conquered East Jerusalem (together with the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights) in the Six-Day War and immediately proclaimed that a unified Jerusalem was its new capital forever. The Israeli foreign ministry and all the other government departments moved up from Tel Aviv, and since 1967 Israeli domestic law has treated East Jerusalem as just another part of Israel. But no foreign government recognized the annexation of East Jerusalem as legal, and no foreign embassies moved up from Tel Aviv. Not even the US embassy.

 It is possible that the Bush administration might yet browbeat the state department into ?recognizing? not only Israel?s annexation of East Jerusalem but the far greater expansion of Israel?s borders that Olmert now has in mind. But it is simply inconceivable that President Bush could persuade other countries to accept such a gross violation of international law.

 He cannot deliver; the deadline is meaningless. Olmert?s government can build walls, dig ditches, move settlers around, proclaim that Israel?s eternal borders are now some distance to the east of where they were last week, maybe even get the Bush administration to agree to the change, but none of it will have any legal force. The whole exercise will take up enormous amounts of time, effort and newsprint over the next few years, but it is in the end only a charade.

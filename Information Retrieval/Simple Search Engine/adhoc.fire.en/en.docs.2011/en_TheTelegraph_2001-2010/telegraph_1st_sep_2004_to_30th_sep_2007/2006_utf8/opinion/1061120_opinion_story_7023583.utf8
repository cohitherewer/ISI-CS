The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT NICE

 Little diversions are always welcome in India. Stopping on the way to work in order to watch, for a while, some relatively unusual spectacle a film being shot, an accident or a fight and then moving on with a sort of light, passing amusement is part of the texture of everyday Indian life. But perhaps it is time to cultivate a degree of robust uncuriosity, a healthy lack of inquisitiveness that lets people get on with their own work even if they happen to be Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. That might be the only way to put celebrity hubris firmly in place as Pitt and Jolies thoroughly deserve. This Hollywood couples public profile in India is becoming increasingly unsavoury. The harassment of the cooperative-society residents at Pune during shooting, the cultural segregation of the foreign and Indian film crew at mealtimes, the roughness of Jolies British security men towards parents at the Anjuman-E-Islam school in Mumbai every reported incident involving the couple has an element of unpleasantness that speaks of a certain kind of attitudinal problem on the part of the visiting contingent towards local forms of behaviour. It is perhaps not entirely fair to identify the alleged terms of the bodyguards abuse with Jolie and Pitts cultural assumptions, but it is difficult to let the couple off altogether in the matter.

 Yet, in spite of the guards being arrested, there is always room in India to get away with such behaviour if it happens to come from visiting celebrities. The star-struck silliness is pervasive. From ordinary citizens to the administration, school authorities and, most importantly, the media, all are willing to let go of discrimination and restraint, and make every sort of compromise with rules, laws and basic human decency in order to accommodate the celebrities inflated sense of their own importance. The bedazzled eagerness with which allowances and arrangements are made by the highest authorities to cater to arbitrary demands and whims speaks of a deep-rooted VIP mentality, which is pegged up a few notches in the case of non-native VIP. To justify the fuss over security at the shooting of The Mighty Heart by saying that this is an anti-terrorist film is not only disingenuous, but also objectionable. It is sometimes heart-warming to be unselfconsciously inquisitive and accommodating. But it is never nice to be told, however implicitly, that some people deserve rude, self-important and highhanded behaviour.

 GOING AGAINST THE TIDE

 Sumanta Sen dwells on the memories of that rare breed of gentleman politicians who left their mark by their honesty and integrity

 Atulya Ghosh (middle): follow the leader

 The former chief minister of Assam, Sarat Sinha, died recently. At 92, he was no longer actively involved in politics, though his association with the Nationalist Congress Party, formed only a few years ago, was evidence enough that till the last, he had remained a political person. His death was briefly reported in a section of the Calcutta newspapers, which was natural. He was neither a bigwig in the ruling party nor was he scam-tainted, and so, greater media attention was not his due.

 So why write about him? Because he was a gentleman, a breed fast disappearing from the nation?s political life. Also because some personal tributes need to be paid to people like Sinha who, tucked away in the North-east, always remained largely unnoticed by the country at large. A pity, for given the opportunity, they perhaps could also have done the Indian state some service. But of Sinha first.

 I first met Saratbabu in the late Seventies. Chief minister during the Emergency, he was no longer with the Congress of Indira Gandhi and sat alone in the spacious office room in a huge building which had been the Congress Bhavan of yore. The anti-foreigner agitation was raging in the state and politicians of different hues were wondering what to do. Even the left was divided with the Communist Party of India in the state choosing to be populist. In that period of turmoil, only a few had remained true to principles and Saratbabu was one of them.

 Introductions over, with typical old world charm he ordered tea and sweets to be brought and with a mischievous twinkle in his eye said, ?some of us have chosen to remain bhadralok.? Then began a long analysis of the agitation and why it was wrong. ?Many times in the past also have we been parochial, forgetting our culture. The ordinary man is not parochial but, as elsewhere, he has always been misled by people with ulterior motives?. One could guess why he was sitting alone. He had refused to swim with the tide. So had the Marxists, but they had done as a party. In an entirely different political world, Sarat Sinha was in the position of a minority of one. And he stood firm.

 That visit was followed over the years by many others, one even to his home. He lay sick during that bizarre election which saw the Nellie massacre, and one could see that he was sick more because of the goings-on than of his ailment. Yet his sickness did not stand in the way of making sure that his visitor was looked after.

 Every time one spoke to the man, one was struck by his Indianness. In a region where the tendency is to remain within narrow confines, Sarat Sinha made it clear that his love for his own state never made him lose sight of the larger national context. He would laugh at the slogan, ?We shall die but not give our oil,? and say, ?since when have natural resources been the property of a particular people?? In the North-east these words were, and remain, important. It required guts to utter such words, just as it requires guts even now. And guts go hand in hand with honesty.

 Brigadier Sailo in Mizoram was another gentleman. Being so, he was shocked when, as the chief minister, he found Indira Gandhi?s government keeping him in the dark while negotiating with Laldenga. ?This is not done,? he kept on repeating on a wet afternoon in Aizawl, his army training obviously disapproving such backstage manoeuvres, a culture which grew during the regime of Mrs Gandhi. What made him particularly unhappy was his suspicion that while the Centre spoke of national interests, it was really seeking to bring back the rebel to put him in a spot. Events proved him right. With the return of Laldenga, not only did he suffer, but also did the Congress.

 His political setback did not, however, affect the man personally. On a later visit, as the plane touched down at Silchar, I found the brigadier along with some others. They had come to receive the dead body of a relative. The occasion was sad but the former chief minister insisted that I get into one of the cars for the long drive to Aizwal. He was aware of the problems of transport and clearly thought it was his responsibility to help one, even though he was not more than an acquaintance. It can be said from personal experience that such men have almost disappeared. Today?s politicians would also help but perhaps not before working out the mileage to be earned from such gestures. During the nearly seven-hour journey, Sailo never for a moment sought to ?sell? his politics or himself.

 From Mizoram to Manipur. Rishang Keishing has never been above controversies, but there could never have been any contrary opinion about his sense of courtesy. Which chief minister would take personal interest in finding accommodation for a visiting newsman? And not once but twice. Soon after he had seen that I got a room at the circuit house, another newsman arrived, and, on a Sunday, the chief minister had to be requested to intervene once again, which he did. 

 At one level, these are isolated personal experiences, but seen in today?s environment, such experiences do seem to have greater significance, they speak of a different social attitude. Such men also displayed their administrative abilities and it does appear strange that they never performed on the national stage, where, very often, men of a lesser breed have danced around.

 Talking of gentlemanly conduct, nearer home the example of the retirement of Atulya Ghosh will always remain a shining one. It is not always easy to know when to quit, but Atulyababu knew it and that makes him an exception even today. Even when he was at the height of power, he had kept his family far away from public glare, which also made him an exception; sons, daughters, nephews of centrist and right-of-centre politicians seeking to succeed fathers and uncles. This has always been a feature of life in this country. Ghosh saw things differently, as a gentleman.

 In this context, another personal note may not be out of order. In the early Eighties I was working for a news magazine when Ghosh rang one afternoon. The reason: ?I like reading your magazine but it is so expensive, can you organize a complementary copy for me?? The request brought to mind those stories of the Sixties, according to which Atulya Ghosh had purchased a huge commercial property in the city and even acted for the Pakistan government. Obviously, the culture to which he belonged was alien to many others. Today, of course, it has almost disappeared.

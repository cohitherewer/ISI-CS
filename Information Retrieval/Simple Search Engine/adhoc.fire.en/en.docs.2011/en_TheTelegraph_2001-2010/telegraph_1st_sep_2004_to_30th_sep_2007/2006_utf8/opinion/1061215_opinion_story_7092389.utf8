 By Mukhtar Mai

 Penguin

 This is the story that hit the headlines across the globe. This is the story that probably left the Pakistani government jittery before the whole world. And most of all, this is the story where a tribal woman from a remote area of Pakistan showed the courage to break free from male subjugation and become a survivor in a world ruled by men.

 Spoken in her own words, Mukhtar Mais In the Name of Honor: A Memoir not only depicts the heart-wrenching story of a woman gang-raped at the order of a tribal council to appease a group of avenging tribal lords, but also throws open an entire debate on the so-called laws of Pakistan that are used by the rich and powerful to dominate others. 

 The backdrop of Mukhtars story is well-known. On June 22, 2002, her 12-year-old younger brother, Shakur, was wrongly accused by the powerful Mastoi clan of having spoken to Salma, a woman of their clan. So, a tribal council passed a barbaric verdict in the name of honour to punish Shakurs family by ordering one of its women to be raped. 

 Mukhtar was the one to go, for she was 28 and divorced. She taught local children verses from the Quran and her family somehow thought that that made her more respectable and strong. So there was an even chance of her being pardoned. 

 However, the sentence was carried out then and there. After being raped by four to five men continuously in a dark room, Mukhtar was forced to walk home naked before a jeering crowd. She was meant to commit suicide. Instead, she prosecuted her attackers and told her story to the entire world. From Mukhtaran Bibi, she became Mukhtar Mai (respected big sister) a symbol of courage and hope for all Pakistani women.

 What emerges from this point is the saga of how innumerable Pakistani women, irrespective of their social status and wealth, simply become objects of possession, honour or revenge. As Mukhtar herself puts in: A woman is nothing more than an object of exchange, from birth to marriage. Men know that a woman humiliated by rape has no other recourse except suicide. They dont even need to use their weapons. Rape is the ultimate weapon: it kills a woman and shames the other clan forever. Men have the monopoly on vengeance, which passes through violence inflicted upon women. When sexuality is taboo, when a mans honour in Pakistani society is centred around a woman, the only solution is marriage or rape.

 Then the story takes on the Pakistani police, the judiciary as well as the authorities who had tried their best to guard the criminals instead of punishing them. In Pakistan, it is difficult for a woman to prove that she has been raped, since she is legally required to produce four male eye-witnesses to the crime. This is to ensure that the law and punishment for rape is not misused. In Mukhtars case the only eye witnesses were the criminals themselves. 

 Still Mukhtar stood up in the face of constant harassment by the authorities and fear of the Mastois hitting back. She was lucky to have a judge who listened to her patiently and gave her the courage that no government official, including the police, did. Yet, she wonders: How many will be lucky like me to have a journalist report the facts, to have human rights organisations take up the cause so strongly that the government had to intervene? In fear of giving the nation a bad image abroad, things changed in her favour. The Lahore high court verdict that acquitted the criminals was reversed and her rapists were once again put behind bars. 

 The book ends on a positive note, speaking of the success of Mukhtars school run by donations from abroad. Mukhtar wants to educate girls and give them a chance to reach out to the world through literacy. Now, almost 200 girls and 160 boys study there. And she is always there to help women who are victims of male atrocities. The book leaves us thinking, ...if the honour of Muslim men lie in women, why do men want to rape or kill that honour?

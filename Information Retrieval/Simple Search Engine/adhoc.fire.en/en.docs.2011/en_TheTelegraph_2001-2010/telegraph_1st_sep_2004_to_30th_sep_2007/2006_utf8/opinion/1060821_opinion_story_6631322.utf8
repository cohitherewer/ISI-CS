 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 Both for power generation and all other applications of nuclear energy, progress and improvements are underpinned by continuing basic nuclear research. The realisation of fusion as a viable energy source requires research in many areas, together with reliable atomic and nuclear data.

 Research reactor applications support most areas of nuclear technology and uses of new research reactors, for example, in isotope production, neutron beam utilization and activation analyses for environment and food and agriculture...

 Developments in accelerator based techniques, production of radioisotopes and some novel uses of nanotechnology are also reported. Nuclear technologies continue to play key and often unique roles in food production and safety, in human and animal health, in water resource management and in the environment. Mutation breeding of crops, for example, has led to the use of previously unusable land in many countries for rice production. In human health, the use of stable isotopes is becoming an accepted tool for the development of nutrition programmes. Nuclear medicine is benefiting from technological advances in computing. Sustainable water management and desalination remain high on the international agenda.

 New developments in isotopic analysis of hydrological samples hold promise for increasing the use of isotopes in water resources management. Advances in sampling and analytical techniques have assisted in better understanding of the environment...

 ...Worldwide there were 441 nuclear power plants operating at the end of 2005, totalling 368 GW(e) of generating capacity, and supplying about 16 per cent of the worlds electricity. This percentage has been roughly stable since 1986, indicating that nuclear power has grown at the same rate as total global electricity for 19 years.

 Four new NPPs were connected to the grid in 2005 (two in Japan and one each in India and the Republic of Korea), and one laid-up plant was reconnected in Canada. This compares to five new grid connections (and one reconnection) in 2004 and two new grid connections (and two reconnections) in 2003. There were two NPP retirements in 2005, compared to five retirements in 2004 and six in 2003.

 The net increase in global nuclear generating capacity during 2005 was 3259 MW(e)....there were three construction starts in 2005: Lingao-3 in China (1000 MW(e)), Olkiluoto-3 in Finland (1600 MW(e)) and Chasnupp-2 in Pakistan (300 MW(e)). In addition, active construction resumed at two NPPs in Bulgaria...In 2004 there were two construction starts plus the resumption of active construction at two NPPs in the Russian Federation. There had been one construction start in 2003.

 Current expansion, as well as near-term and long-term growth prospects, are centred in Asia....of 27 reactors under construction worldwide at the end of 2005, 16 were in Asia. Twenty-four of the last 34 reactors to have been connected to the grid were in Asia.

 Japan has the largest nuclear power programme in Asia...Japan now has 55 reactors in operation and one under construction... Altogether Japan plans to add ten units to the grid by 2014, increasing nuclear powers share of Japanese electricity to more than 40 per cent.

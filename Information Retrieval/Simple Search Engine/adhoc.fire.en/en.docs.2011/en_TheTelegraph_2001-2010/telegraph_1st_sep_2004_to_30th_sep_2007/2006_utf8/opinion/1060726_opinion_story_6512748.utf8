 TERROR TACTICS

 Stephen Hugh-Jones

 Who are the terrorists now? That is a question most Arabs and many others have been asking as we watched the Israeli trashing of Lebanon this month. To most Americans and nearly all Israelis, the answer is self-evident: those uglies called Hamas or Islamic Jihad or Hizbollah, who else could it be? Both question and answer suggest a closer look at the word. Just what do we mean by terrorism? 

 One man?s terrorist, we all know, is another man?s freedom fighter. What rather fewer of us recognize is that both views may be right. That was obviously true in early 20th-century Bengal. It is no less true of those who hope to help liberate the West Bank by blowing up some discos in Tel Aviv. The political aim is one thing, the method used is another. 

 Terrorism is as old as the hills, and terrorism, as a term, not as new as you may think. It came into English, after the French Revolution, to describe the methods (notably the guillotine) of the Jacobin terror. Note a difference from modern usage: the guillotine-users and their agents ? ?those hell-hounds called terrorists?, in Burke?s words ? were not a band of conspirators, but the French government. Only later did the word get the restricted use that it has today, when it was applied to the Russian extremists of the 1860s and on.

 Yet they too were not terrorists in the modern sense. Their chosen tool was not terror. They preferred a private-sector version of what Israelis now euphemize as targeted assassination; not just setting off bombs to cause public panic, but to kill the emperor (as they did to Alexander II in 1881) or some high official specifically. And these early ?terrorists? tried, most often, to avoid killing ordinary people while they were doing it. The same was truer still in British-ruled Bengal. 

 Civilian targets

 So the word has changed sense more than once. Perhaps it is time to restore it, by going back to its root: the word terror. The best definition I?ve met came, paradoxically, from a hyper-patriotic former Israeli journalist: attacking civilians to spread terror, for military/ political ends. I?ve paraphrased him, but that is the essence. 

 That definition, as applicable, on occasion, to official armed forces as to Osama bin Laden, is an embarrassing one for Israelis today. But not only for them. By this standard, the worst terrorists of the 20th century were not the PLO, the IRA, Italy?s Red Brigades, Germany?s Baader-Meinhof gang or the Naxalites. They were first the German, then the British and American air forces in World War II, whose area bombing of cities was aimed, above all, at civilian morale; in the Allies? case with mass-murderous results but, until August 1945, no great success. 

 Then came Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They proved, as Genghis Khan had seven centuries earlier, that terror can work: here?s a demonstration of what we can do, now surrender or else.

 Mass-murder isn?t in fact needed, but it for sure helps: the prospect of death concentrates a man?s mind wonderfully, as Dr Johnson wrote of hanging, and it can be just as true of an air-strike. 

 My point isn?t political; it?s a plea that we use words for what they say, not merely as portmanteau terms of abuse. Use force against civilians to spread terror, and the honest word for what you are doing is terrorism, be your aims good or bad, and whether you are one or many, official or unofficial, and your weapon a suicide belt, a helicopter rocket or an A-bomb from a Superfortress. 

 The originator of the definition I?ve borrowed would never have dreamed of applying it to his own country?s armed forces. But honesty in language carries no national flag. Both sides ? the Israelis far more bloodily ? have been using terrorism in the Lebanese war; a war, curiously, that was sparked off by attacks aimed specifically at soldiers, that is not by acts of terrorism at all.

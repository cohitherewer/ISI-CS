 SPECTRUM BLUES

 In May 2005, Mr Ratan Tata wrote to the minister of communications. He suggested that spectrum for 3G services broadband services permitting faster transmission, including that of films and television should be allocated to all current cellular telephone operators after charging them Rs 1,500 crore, and the department of telecommunications should fix the share of revenue they should pay to the government by means of an auction. Almost instantly, the Cellular Operators Association of India opposed it, saying that its members should continue to get spectrum free. Mr Tata wrote another letter last week, suggesting Rs 750 crore entry fee and an auction-based revenue share for the 2G services which cellular operators are currently providing, and got another immediate riposte from COAI opposing him.

 It is understandable that COAI is against paying for spectrum; which businessman would pay the government unless he has to? That, however, raises the question: what has got into Mr Ratan Tata? Why is he offering money on a plate to the government? The answer lies in the regime the government operates. At the moment, an operator whose spectrum allocation is getting strained has to go to the DoT, tell them that he has got so many subscribers, and beg for more spectrum; DoT then ladles it out to him in dribbles of 1.25 megahertz. Except that DoT does not verify whether the operator has really got the subscribers he claims. So operators have been giving fictitious numbers; whoever tells the biggest lie gets most spectrum. It does not have to be an out-and-out lie; an operator can hand out a number with a handset or give out a lifetime connection for Rs 999, and claim a subscriber. Mr Tata seeks an end to these tricks; COAI hopes they can continue for a while longer. DoT has simply received the letters and filed them. That too is understandable. Any minister would love it if businessmen queue outside his office begging for spectrum; and the current minister is no exception. But is what is good for businessmen and the minister good for the country? 

 As Mr Tata pointed out, spectrum is a scarce resource. If the government keeps giving it to those that take its fancy, they will squat on it and hoard it; spectrum will be inefficiently used, while efficient users will not get enough spectrum. Besides, wireless services are a dynamic industry; an industrial house like the Tatas would like to make long-term plans on what services it would offer and how it would market them, and hence would like to be given substantial spectrum. Earlier, in 1998, when an arbitrary minister had faced impecunious and selfish operators, the prime minister then, Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee had appointed a spectrum management committee to which we owe the present rationing mechanism. It is time the present prime minister intervened and arbitrated between the warring interests in the arena of spectrum allocation.

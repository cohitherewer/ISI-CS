 Letters to Editor

 Landed in trouble

 Sir The government of Indias reaction to the detention of 12 passengers of Indian origin by the Dutch authorities is not only unjustified but also betrays an attempt to exploit a non-issue to appease a particular community (Delhi stirs, turns heat on Dutch, Aug 26). Regular fliers who travel in groups, especially if they are from the same family, tend to be boisterous. Their manner sometimes does inconvenience other passengers. Considering the heightened threat perception these days, passengers are expected to cooperate with the enhanced security measures of the airlines and airport authorities. In blatant defiance of the safety rules, the 12 passengers in question did not fasten their safety belts, continued to use cell phones inside the aircraft, exchanged the instruments and kept talking so loudly that it amounted to shouting all in spite of repeated warnings from the air crew. They immediately invited suspicion. The Dutch authorities must be praised for the way they handled the situation and finally released the passengers. Instead of condoning the passengers actions, the government should use this incident as a lesson for unruly travellers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir The Indian air passengers who were detained and interrogated in Amsterdam were actually the victims of the Wests paranoid fear of terrorist attacks. Yet, one cannot blame the airport officials as hardly a fortnight ago, a conspiracy to blast at least 10 British aircraft had been foiled. Whatever be the justification in this case, India did the right thing by giving the Dutch government a piece of its mind. The travellers did not brook the harassment they had to endure, though they would be well advised to temper their behaviour while flying in future. They could have been in far greater trouble if they were in an American airport. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir India should not protest too much about the detention of 12 Muslims at the Amsterdam airport and their subsequent release. It must be noted that there was no ethnic bias in the incident; it was a clear case of extra precaution taken as a result of the spread of Islamic terrorism all over the world. It is unfortunate that the government is treating the issue as an instance of racial discrimination. Everyone knows that it is better to be safe than sorry. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.G. Acharya, Mumbai 

 Sir The Dutch government is reputed to be one of the most liberal in the comity of nations. So, it is wrong to suggest that the incident on board the Northwest flight was triggered by any racial or religious bias on the part of the authorities. If at all anyone has overreacted to the incident, it was the Indian government, by going to the extent of summoning the Dutch ambassador to express discontent. One suspects that there were domestic compulsions behind the action, but it does compromise Indias position in the international effort to combat terrorism. The absence of a full-fledged external affairs minister leaves such sensitive matters in the hands of bureaucrats.

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

 Sir The report, Freedom for dozen on flight of fiasco (Aug 25) brings to light an extremely highhanded intrusion into the rights and liberties of international passengers. Also, the manner in which the sleeping passengers were handcuffed speaks volumes of the hollow cries for civil liberties in the West. Further, by identifying Muslims and people with beard with terrorists, the authorities have exposed their professional incompetence and their ignorance of the international protocol of civil aviation. Northwest airlines should face both legal and financial consequences for this imprudent act. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir When every instance of international terrorism in the recent past has had its roots in Islamic fundamentalism, what is the use of flaying the Dutch authorities for ordering Flight NW 42 back on grounds of suspicion? If every American or Englishman is held responsible for the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq, why should not every Muslim be held accountable for the actions of a few of their brethren? Yogesh Devpade, who was worried that his 73-year-old father was on Flight NW42, should rejoice that he is now much more likely to live to see his 74th birthday. And all because the Dutch authorities chose to err on the side of caution by not putting innocent lives at risk. 

 Yours faithfully,

V.K. Tankha, Calcutta

 Sir With air travel becoming extremely bothersome in this age of terrorist threats, it would be prudent to look for other means of travel to safely reach our destinations. The recent fiasco involving Northwest Airlines Flight 42 does call for flak. Reports mentioned an ailing 73-year-old man, who was subjected to much harassment for no fault of his own. The airline should be made to pay for this. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir It may seem unpleasant at first that 12 Indian passengers were suspected of being terrorists. But in the current scenario of global terror, the Dutch authorities reaction is quite justified. Indians are often found lacking when it comes to following air travel etiquette. However, it is sad that the Indian passengers were detained for over 24 hours and were not treated with respect and dignity.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

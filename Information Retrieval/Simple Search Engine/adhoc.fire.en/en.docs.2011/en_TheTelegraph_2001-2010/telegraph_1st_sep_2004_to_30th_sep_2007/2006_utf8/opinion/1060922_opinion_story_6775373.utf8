 ALL THINGS ROTTEN 

Malvika Singh

Bona Fide

It is a Delhi phenomenon, one that is in the news, 

but symptomatic of the appalling urban planning, norms and regulations across 

urban India. Rampant corruption in this sector has destroyed the best of our cities 

and towns, setting the standards for all new habitations that are sprouting in 

every state as the country begins to boom economically. Inhuman conditions of 

streets and tarmac, abysmal drainage and maintenance facilities, overwhelming 

encroachments and illegal additions to floor-space indices, gross municipal architecture, 

no public amenities or wooded spaces in our towns, have made India a veritable 

hellhole. 

In their desperation to make money by taking bribes 

from all those unthinking elements who want to break rules to extend onto public 

areas or go beyond the stipulated height of a building and much else, municipalities 

have reduced urban India to a huge and unmanageable slum except for Lutyenss 

Delhi, where the political and bureaucratic class hide in their isolated, comfortable 

cocoon, where electricity hardly ever goes out and where cleaner water is in full 

supply with the new mem sahibs using it to water their roses! It is these men 

and women who formulate the laws, who silently turn their face when they are being 

ruthlessly and transparently broken, who then hold a brief for the offenders because 

their vote bank is important for the next election. They will never rock the municipal 

boat because they themselves have endless skeletons in their personal as well 

as professional cupboards. And so, they suffocate and kill off all those who are 

honest, civilized and abide by the law. It makes one want to bury ones head in 

shame. 

Vanishing integrity

In this great and many-layered ancient capital city, 

the municipality, with the support of the political masters, has mauled and massacred 

the living and working habitats. In most colonies of south Delhi, for example, 

if there is a fire in one of the houses, no fire engine would be able to enter 

to douse the flames. Garbage collection is pathetic, a tangle of open electric 

wires make for an overhead mesh that is a ticking time bomb, cable wires add 

to the ugliness and the stench of stale, congealed male piss bounces off the walls 

of builders flats. It is offensive and repugnant. The lure of rural India has 

begun to enter the thoughts of the fast-diminishing group of men and women who 

live by their honest values and integrity. 

Traders are up in arms protesting the sealing of illegal 

operations that are being conducted in Delhi, based on the orders of the Supreme 

Court. The Central minister for urban affairs has promised this constituency of 

people who have regularly defied and broken the existing laws, that he will try 

and convene a special session of the parliament to pass a law that will overrule 

the court and establish a precedent to break all laws. What a weird and bizarre 

development! It is unimaginable in this day and age, particularly in cities where 

one minor rainfall wreaks havoc because of encroachments, there are no facilities 

to cope with illegal activities happening. To condone the wrong and fight against 

what is correct is criminal. The prime minister must intervene and tell us whether 

his government believes in supporting, officially, all that is wrong and illegal. 

Equally, the men and women serving in the municipality 

who have permitted gross violations must be suspended and publicly shamed. Politicians 

who have encroached must be removed from their official posts. A standard of how 

citizens are expected to operate must be set. A masterplan of dos and donts, 

with inputs from the great cities of the world, must be laid down and adhered 

to meticulously. The honest must be rewarded and those who indulge in illegalities 

must be punished. This nonsense of protecting law-breakers is madness.

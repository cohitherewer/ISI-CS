 ROLE CALL

 The conviction expressed in the recent Unicef report on the leadership abilities of women is not dependent on Ms Nancy Pelosis yet-to-be-proven success in taming the Republicans in the United States of America. The hunch about the effectiveness of women in promoting welfare, particularly at the local level, informs the UNs Millennium Project in a major way. It has also goaded the security council to welcome an increased participation of women in peace-making through its Resolution 1325. It goes without saying that much of this confidence in women is inspired by some of the remarkable successes they have wrought in the face of adversities, especially in war-ravaged nations. The empirical data gathered over the years about the swiftness with which women participants in community welfare have cleared roadblocks to development also promote this idea. But the hypothesis should, in no way, encourage the belief that women are genetically predisposed to problem-solving or leading the way. Women, like men, have managed to motivate people by being a clever judge of events, their own strengths, weaknesses and priorities. And they, like men, have often taken full advantage of these. Both the past and present histories of south Asia amply prove this point. This part of the world has seen a high incidence of woman leaders, most of whom have assumed political office by way of their lineage. But as women, they have shown no exceptional ability to stay away from either greed or corruption. In Bangladesh, the bickering between the two women leaders Begum Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wajed which takes the country increasingly towards ruin, shows that they are no better leaders than the men. In India, the opportunist politics of Ms Mayavati, Ms J. Jayalalithaa, or Ms Mamata Banerjee equally prove that they are in no way inferior to men in politicking. 

 This evidence might fly in the face of the sincerity women have shown in promoting peace and welfare. Often it is their own suffering and experience that force them to affect change in their immediate set-up. This explains the success womens local participation has engendered. There is no reason why this success cannot be replicated in the larger political sphere. But a larger female representation in the elected bodies and legislatures alone cannot guarantee this. Strength in numbers has to be buttressed by commitment.

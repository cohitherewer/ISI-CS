 PEACE BY PIECE

 Even a short spell of peace is better than none at all. The extension of the ceasefire in Nagaland by another year is, therefore, a welcome development. True, it would have been better if the Naga peace talks in Bangkok broke new ground by doing away with the annual review of the ceasefire agreement. But the fact that the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Thuingaleng Muivah and Mr Isak Chishi Swu, had thought of a truce without a time limit is a positive sign for the peace talks. It would be realistic to make the ceasefire co-terminus with the peace process. This could ease tensions on the ground and reduce the scope for violations of the truce by either side. Mr Muivah would do well to persuade his comrades in Nagaland that the time has come to free the ceasefire from its time limit and from the need for its annual extensions. But this was only a small disappointment from the Bangkok talks. The way both sides hailed the negotiations this time is a good omen for lasting peace in Nagaland. The two sides still have a long way to go, especially over complicated issues such as sovereignty of the Nagas and the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas. But the important thing is that each side now seems to trust the other.

 By contrast, this mutual trust is clearly lacking in New Delhis negotiations with the Assamese rebels. The fault lies more with the United Liberation Front of Asom than with the Centre. Since last October, when the Ulfa appointed a peoples consultative group to talk to the Centre on its behalf, there have been thirteen meetings between the two sides. But the situation in Assam has not improved to warrant a ceasefire. Yet, the Ulfa continues to insist on a ceasefire and on the release of five of its leaders from jails. In fact, it has made the governments acceptance of these demands a condition for its direct talks with New Delhi. The Ulfas mediators blame the Centre more for the stalemate. But they should ask the rebel groups leaders whether they have done enough to justify a truce. The rebels show no signs of giving up violence. If some rebels have been killed in recent months, that shows the deep mistrust between the two sides. The Ulfa leaders themselves should join the talks soon in order to end the stalemate. The Assamese rebels once learnt from their Naga mentors how to make war; they could now learn from them how to make peace.

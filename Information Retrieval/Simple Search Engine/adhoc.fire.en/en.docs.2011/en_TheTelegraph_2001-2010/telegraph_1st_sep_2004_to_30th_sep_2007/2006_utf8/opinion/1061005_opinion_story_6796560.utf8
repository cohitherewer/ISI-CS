 Letters to Editor

 Unbearable thinness

 Sir The recent uproar over the banning of underweight models by the local government of Madrid brings to focus a phenomenon that has become pervasive today (Twiggys girls, Sept 23). Women today have become obsessed with body-weight and leave no stone unturned to get rid of the extra pounds. As pointed out in the editorial, this obsession is linked not only to how a woman perceives her body, but also to deep-rooted questions of the self. A number of factors are responsible for creating a lower self-worth in women. Matrimonial columns in newspapers continue to measure the brides desirability in terms of how slim or fair she is. Attitudes such as this create a psychological pressure on women who have a few extra kilos on their body. Eating disorders like anorexia or bulimia result from the dissatisfaction with ones appearance and the efforts to emulate the malnourished models splashed all over the media. The ban on ultra-thin women walking the ramp at the Madrid Fashion Week could be a positive step towards bringing about a change in the way society constructs feminine beauty. 

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md. Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir Whether girls look attractive after shedding every inch of excess fat from their body is a debatable issue. But starving the body for days creates physical and psychological disorders with long-term consequences. Much of the credit for promoting the fad of dieting among women goes to the fashion designers. They come up with the weirdest dresses that do not at all seem suitable for wearing in public. The bodies and faces required for displaying their creations have to be as unreal as the creations themselves. The authorities in Madrid have taken a commendable stand by putting their foot down on the participation of emaciated models in fashion shows there. If other countries follow suit, many girls may just be able to eat and drink freely, without the nagging fear of getting fat. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The Union health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, has taken a right step by endorsing the decision of the Madrid local government to ban skinny models from the citys fashion week. One of the basic requirements of fashion is health. No dress will suit one unless one looks healthy. How can an under-nourished and unfit body be called beautiful?

 Yours faithfully,

Chandreyee Paul, Calcutta

 Sir The former Miss India, Yukta Mookhey, once went public on how the strict diet regime that helped her shed the extra kilos also made her bones brittle. If one loses the right to lead a healthy life in the bid to look good, then is it not better to live with a less-than-perfect body? Women willingly go under the scalpel to change their physical features. And they go on fasts to make their bodies attractive to the male eye. The advertisements that encourage the emaciated look should be banned immediately. It is a pity that when many women in India have to starve because they cannot get one square meal, their affluent sisters enjoy the luxury of making the famished look their fashion statement. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sujit De, Sodepur

 Sir The government of India should follow in the footsteps of Madrids local government and put a ban on gaunt models. It is strange that the cult equating thinness with beauty should find a place in a country like India, where goddesses have always been depicted as well rounded, even voluptuous. The film heroines of yesteryear were anything but skinny. But were they any less beautiful than the starlets of today? Indian women should stop running after impossible ideals and go back to tradition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soma Datta, Siliguri

 In deep waters

 Sir It is a matter of shame that after spending huge sums of money on constructing the Bhasha Bhavan of the National Library, its floors get flooded at the first heavy shower of the season and the roofs start leaking (National Library at natures mercy, Sept 26). This is truly appalling since the annexe is just two years old. There are a number of heritage buildings in Calcutta that are not plagued by leaking roofs in spite of having weathered decades of rain and shower. It seems that whenever the Central Public Works Department undertakes any project, the fate of the project is sealed. The building will be constructed with the cheapest materials available and is sure to fall apart at the slightest blow. Why not invite tenders globally and award contracts to reputed civil engineering firms?

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir Leaving the rare books of Bhasha Bhavan at the mercy of the rains is a testimony to societys apathy towards the invaluable legacy of the country. If rain can harm the priceless documents of the National Library for the second successive year, then it is clear that the authorities are least bothered about the librarys possessions. What was the CPWD doing after rainwaters seeped into the building last year? One year should have been enough for the necessary repairs. The CPWD should be penalized for criminal negligence.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 KICKING

 Brazilian footballer Ronaldo faced flak for his initial lacklustre performance at the World Cup. But he has more than proved that he doesnt need to hang up his boots

 He used to be called El Phenomeno ? the Phenomenon ? in Brazils soccer club circuit when he was a teenager. But a fortnight ago, Brazilian football giant Ronaldo looked in danger of relinquishing that honorific forever. Jeered at for resembling more a football than a footballer, reviled for his lacklustre performance in Brazils World Cup opening match against Croatia and again in the match with Australia, the lumbering Ronaldo looked like a hero who needed to hang up his boots. 

 But just when everybody was writing him off as a World Cup washout, Ronaldo flashed fire. Two brilliant goals against Japan and a dextrous dribble and tap that took a 1-0 lead against feisty Ghana, and Ronaldo is once again back in the reckoning, once again being acknowledged as a huge talent who could spearhead Brazil to an unprecedented sixth World Cup title. Suddenly, his weight is no longer such a big issue either. As Brazils press manager put it sarcastically last week, When he doesnt score, he is fat! 

 But overweight or not, the media and the fans should have known better than to have dismissed Ronaldo so easily. FIFA Player of the Year in 1996, 1997, and 2002, the winner of the Golden Boot in World Cup 2002, and with as many as 71 goals in 109 international matches, the Brazilian was never going to go out with a whimper. In fact, in these last two World Cup matches, he has raced past German striker Gerd Muellers record of the highest number of World Cup goals. With 15 goals, that record now lies snug in Ronaldos kitty. Though he recently went on record to say that he doesnt need to prove anything, Ronaldo has just given proof of his genius once more. 

 That Ronaldo is a fighter who knows how to battle the odds and claw his way back on top was never more evident than when he fell to injury at the height of his career in 1999. He had to undergo surgery and was out of action for months. Then, while he was playing his comeback match in the 2000 Italian Cup final, he twisted his right knee once again. A devastated Ronaldo wept as he was carried off in a stretcher. This time, his rehabilitation took 17 months and many people thought that it was curtains for him. But he proved everybody wrong and powered Brazil to a fifth World Cup victory in 2002. He became the tournaments top scorer and netted the ball eight times in seven matches. Clearly, it was Ronaldos finest hour. 

 That hour took a long time in coming. Ronaldo Lu?z Naz?rio de Lima was born on September 22, 1976, in Bento Ribeiro, a working class neighbourhood in Rio de Janeiro. His father, who worked in a telephone company, was passionate about football. Son Ronaldo caught his passion and rather than spend time at school got a kick out of kicking the ball around with his friends in the backstreets of Rio. 

 When he was 14, he was spotted by Jairzinho, a Brazilian World Cup player, who signed him up for a football club in the city of Belo Horizonte. Young Ronaldo pleased his mentor by scoring 12 goals in the Brazilian National Championships. From there on it was just a hop, tap and dribble to Brazils international squad in 1994. Though he didnt get to toe the ball in the US World Cup in 1994, the world was waking up to the arrival of a soccer superstar. Fans swooned over his ability to snatch the ball from opponents and find the net as if by magic, the media went into raptures over his spectacular goals and Europes clubs clamoured to sign him up. In fact, former British coach Bobby Robson was so impressed with the youngster that he prophesied, He will become the best ever. 

 He certainly has lived up to that promise. Whichever club he played for ? and he has played for heavyweights like PSV Eindhoven, FC Barcelona, Inter Milan, and currently, Real Madrid ? he has been a prolific scorer. At FC Barcelona he scored 34 goals in 37 matches in the 1996-1997 season. At Inter Milan, he scored 68 goals in 113 matches and at Real Madrid he has netted the ball 114 times in 181 appearances. 

 However, as his fame soared, his personal life looked like getting stuck in typical rockstar mode ? crowded with beautiful women, booze-ups at nightclubs and a string of broken relationships. After his divorce from Milene Domingues, his wife of four years, Ronaldo married Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniella Cicarelli in 2005. That relationship lasted just three months. His current girlfriend is the leggy Brazilian model Raica Oliviera. 

 If Ronaldo has been struggling to find the perfect mate, of late, he has also been struggling to find his footwork with his fans. Some desultory performances for Real Madrid this season together with his expanding waistline have seen fans whistling at him cruelly. Ronaldo himself has been so upset with the way he was treated at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid that he said recently, I have never felt loved here. I have never felt at home at the Bernabeu. 

 Some say that Ronaldos slightly laid-back attitude towards the beautiful game these days is the reason his fans have cooled towards him. Is it because they expect more from him that their disappointment is huge when he fails them? No doubt, the sight of a diminished Ronaldo is hard to bear for those who love him. 

 But if the last couple of matches were any indication, Ronaldo will dazzle us yet. As Brazil readies to take on France in the quarter-finals today, fans of samba football the world over will say a collective prayer: let Ronaldo shine!

 LOVE IN THE TIME OF CAMERAS

 - It certainly looks like the Times-AOL merger

 The Abhishek Bachchan-Ash love story ? real, make-belief or arranged ? has got Mumbais film industry abuzz with speculation. Some in the industry swear that the romantic link is strategic in nature, reports Shuchi Bansal

 STAGE ACT: Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan

You could say its a marriage made to order. Or you could describe it as a true meeting of the hearts. Call it what you will, but you just cant ignore the love story ?real, make-belief or arranged ? thats got Mumbais film industry abuzz with speculation. 

 The script is a bloggers delight, with everybody writing his own version of the story. But the real life characters in the drama ? beauteous Aishwarya Rai and smouldering Abhishek Bachchan ? are not saying a word about their alleged fairy tale romance. Nearly everybody else, however, has a take on the subject. 

 Legend has it that the romance was triggered on the sets of J.P. Dattas Umrao Jaan ? a film starring the two protagonists. And it was at Abhishek Bachchans 30th birthday bash at Jalsa, his home in Mumbai, on February 5 that the invitees noticed the sparks between the two. And it was no coincidence that Rai was among the first to arrive and the last to leave. Equally significant was the absence of her two former beaux ? Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi. 

 In Bollywood, stories of leading ladies and heroes falling in love are a dime a dozen. The difference this time, though, is in the high ratings of the Michelin-starred couple. For starters, Abhishek belongs to the first family of Bollywood and is the son of Amitabh Bachchan, arguably the most popular star of Hindi cinema. Rai, on the other hand, is a former Miss World and is regarded by many not just as the most beautiful face in the country but one that is internationally recognised as well. In another age, an envoy would have gone atop a canopied elephant, carrying a proposal for marriage. 

 In Mumbai, the jury is still out on what kind of a romance, if any at all, is on the cards. Several notable names in the entertainment industry, including film trade analyst Taran Adarsh and image management agency Matrix Indias promoter Reshma Shetty, find it hard to believe that the media can devote so much space to an alleged love affair. Yet others in the industry swear that the romantic link is strategic in nature. 

 It certainly looks like the Times-AOL merger, says a Bollywood director who does not wish to be named. Basically, it is an exploitative, manipulative alliance between two power houses wanting to increase their hold, clout and contacts in the industry. Amitabh Bachchan is well connected politically. And Aishwarya Rai is looking beyond Bollywood. 

 The consequences of the alliance, if it happens, may or may not be as dramatic as the director makes them sound. But the industry is divided on who is going to benefit the most out of the alliance ? the hero just about to turn into a star, or the heroine who, many believe, has already reached her pinnacle. A small section maintains that a Rai-Bachchan Jr alliance will help boost the latters image. After a series of flops, Bachchan Jr last year delivered a few hits ? including Dhoom, Bunty aur Babli and Sarkar ? but is nowhere near the number one slot. Some argue that her international celebrity status ? Rai got some world press as a member of the jury at Cannes three years ago ?can only enhance his image. 

 Bachchans supporters, however, strongly disagree that the actor needs Rai to shore up his image. Abhishek is such a big star today that he does not require anyone to prop up his image. He is bigger than his films, observes Komal Nahata, editor of trade magazine Film Information. He hasnt had runaway successes like the films of Shah Rukh, Aamir or Salman Khan, but girls are mad about him. So the alliance with Ash is doing nothing for his image, he holds. 

 A top executive of a celebrity management company agrees with Nahata. The era of the 40-year-old heroes ? such as the Khan ? is drawing to a close. Abhishek is the next generation star. Film industrywallahs also point to his 2006 film line-up to buttress their argument. The actor is working for the Yash Raj Films banner once again with Yash Chopra mounting the Dhoom sequel on a much bigger scale. The film is being shot in Brazil. 

 Besides, Yash Chopra is open to working with Abhishek Bachchan again. He has evolved as an actor and is very confident. Will we work with him again? Of course, why not? he says. Karan Johars company, Dharma Production, is also going to release Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna ? starring Abhishek Bachchan ? this year. 

 Purely on the basis of data, the three hits last year, and his forthcoming big-budget, big-banner films, wed say that Abhisheks career is on an upswing, says Matrixs Reshma Shetty. Thanks to Alliance Media amp; Entertainment, the agency that bagged the Ford Fiesta deal for him, his career as a brand ambassador is also looking up. 

 But then, Rai has not been sitting idle either. Shes already well established as a brand ambassador ? her face sells a host of products including diamonds from De Beers and LOreal cosmetics ? and has tasted success in films such as Devdas and Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.Yet some feel that back home, its Bachchan who is the bigger star. Aishwarya has been exploring the West for some time now. But while Abhishek may not be a super star like his father, he is very popular, says Taran Adarsh. 

 Not surprisingly, there is a vocal section that believes it is Rai who is likely to benefit from a close association with the Bachchans, if the match does work out. Critics argue that despite best efforts, her career in Hollywood hasnt really taken off. Her presence is restricted to crossover films with Gurinder Chaddha and Jagmohan Mundhra. But big Hollywood banners seemed to have skipped her, says a film industry source. And I dont remember her last Hindi film hit.You think she is popular because she manoeuvres to stay in news, especially internationally, be it through the Oprah Winfrey show or (Chaddhas) Bride and Prejudice. 

 In fact, the times havent been easy for 32-year-old Rai. For one, her Hindi film industry support system is crumbling. The actor has fallen out with the Khans. Stories of her failed ? and reportedly violent ? affair with Salman Khan are well known. Shah Rukh Khan replaced her with Rani Mukherjee in his film Chalte Chalte and Rai walked out of Aamir Khans The Rising. She also backed out of Hrithik Roshans Krrish, though now she is working with him in Dhoom 2. Some observers point out that while she was trying to break into Hollywood, Rani Mukherjee and Preity Zinta walked away with Hindi cinemas plum roles. 

 There is a belief that an alliance with Abhishek Bachchan ? who is fast turning into a national heart throb ? will give her career the much-needed impetus. She is already acting with him in Dhoom 2 and Umrao Jaan, and the industry buzz has it that the duo has also been signed up by Mani Ratnam for his next film. 

 Some, like film trade analyst Adarsh, believe that marriage is immaterial to film stars careers. The bottom line is the content of the film, says Adarsh. Adds Anirban Das Blah, vice-president, Globosport, an image management company for stars like Saif Ali Khan: Relationships do not affect a stars brand equity as far as endorsements are concerned. Look at Saif. His relationship does not affect his career. His endorsement price keeps going up. 

 Yet there are others who know the two stars and air a different point of view. Aishwarya Rai sucks energy out of the man she is with. She will pull him down, says the head of a celebrity management company. Filmmaker Prahlad Kakker also feels that the alliance, if anything, will put Abhishek Bachchan under pressure. He is such a huge star and shes going to be such a huge international star. If marriage happens, nothing will happen to her career. She has her momentum. Nothing can touch her career except a bad marriage. 

 There is an element of concern, too, for the industry is superstitious by nature. The observers point out that the pair has not clicked in two of the films they featured in earlier. Neither Dhai Akshar Prem Ke by Raj Kanwar nor Kuch Na Kaho by Rohan Sippy was a hit. 

 But Raj Kanwar disagrees. There is magic in the pair. I noticed they shared a special chemistry when they did emotional scenes. And I noticed they laughed like people in love, he says. Kanwar stresses that the two look great together. I would like to go further and say they are like Raj Kapoor and Nargis. 

 The Raj Kapoor-Nargis relationship, even Kanwar would agree, was an unhappy one. In Bollywood, in fact, there have been only a few successful marriages or relationships between stars. 

 But then, not all marriages are made in heaven. Some, clearly, are made on the drawing board. 

 How star couples have fared

 Ties that bind: Ajay Devgan and Kajol

 Is marriage the kiss of death for a bride in the Mumbai film world? Usually, when stars marry each other, the woman fades out. Neetu Singh and Rishi Kapoor, Bollywoods popular romantic pair of the late 1970s, tied the knot when they were at the peak of their career. But Neetu Singh opted out and Rishi Kapoor continued mdash; till late last year, in fact mdash; with his share of hits and flops. 

 Amitabh Bachchans story is similar, though his super hits really happened after he married Jaya Bhaduri. Bachchan is still going strong and the immensely-talented Bhaduri does the occasional mothers role. 

 On the other hand, the careers of both Dharmendra and Hema Malini had already peaked when they got married mdash; his second, her first. Malini brought up her daughters and focused on a dance career. Just about two years ago did she start acting again. Kajol, one of the top actors of her time, retired for a few years after her marriage to Ajay Devgan, but is making a come back this year. 

 The industry believes that its not the audience that rejects a married woman star. It is women themselves who take a back seat and focus on the home front, says Reshma Shetty of Matrix, an image management agency. 

 Will Aishwarya Rai follow suit?

 Is Ash a Jonah? 

 Vivek and Aishwarya

Is Aishwarya Rai bad news for the men in her life? That rsquo;s an uncharitable question but is nonetheless posed by some in Bollywood.

 Salman Khan and Aishwarya started dating in January 1999 while shooting for Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. The film was released in July 1999 and was a big hit. But after Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, Khan rsquo;s career hit a rocky patch. All his films flopped. Take a look at the list: Chal Mere Bhai, Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge, Kahin Pyar Na Ho Jaye, Dil Ne Jise Apna Kaha, Garv, Yeh Hai Jalwa, Tumko Na Bhool Payenge, Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam. 

 It rsquo;s ironic now that the handsome Khan made a guest appearance in the Ash-Abhishek starrer Dhai Akshar Prem Ke. While his film career was not sizzling, his real-life antics made news. If he was not being Rai rsquo;s bodyguard, he was storming into her sets and creating a scene. They broke up in the fall of 2002 and Rai started dating Vivek Oberoi. Actor Suresh Oberoi rsquo;s son seemed to have a promising career after having been discovered by Ram Gopal Varma. However, soon Oberoi Jr had a string of flops mdash; Kyun Ho Gaya Na, Darna Mana Hai, Kisna, Kaal, Home Delivery. Rai started dating Abhishek in November 2005 while shooting for Umrao Jaan. When Bachchan senior fell ill, Rai apparently offered Bachchan junior her slender shoulders to lean on during the crisis. What happens next? Bollywood which is steeped in superstition is keeping its fingers crossed for Bachchan rsquo;s sake.

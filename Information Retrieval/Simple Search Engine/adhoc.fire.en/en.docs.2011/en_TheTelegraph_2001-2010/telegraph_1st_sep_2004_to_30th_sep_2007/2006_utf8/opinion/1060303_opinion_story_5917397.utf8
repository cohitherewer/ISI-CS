 HIGH STAKES 

 The greater the stakes the more frenzied the game. The stakes have always been very high in Uttar Pradesh, and now there are more players there than ever before. Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav?s triumphant entry into the breach ? and the chief ministership ? after the break-up between the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003 has lost its sheen. The status of the 40 legislators, who had defected from the BSP to form an independent group and had then thrown in their lot with Mr Yadav?s Samajwadi Party, has now been undermined by the Allahabad high court?s decision that the BSP split in 2003 was illegal. Apart from raising again the thorny question of the speaker?s role ? Mr Kesrinath Tripathi, the speaker then, had allowed the smooth movement of the defectors from the BSP to the Samajwadi Party ? this is bad news for Mr Yadav. He might have been feeling a bit wary in the context of his relationship with the Congress, in rapid decline since 2004. It would seem that the court?s interest in the matter has taken a while to fructify, and the interim has been taken up with a furtive confidence vote, now rendered pointless, and other self-serving operations on the part of the dominant party. 

 The confusion now has been compounded by some resignations among the defecting legislators, who have been told by the present speaker that their status has reverted to pre-defection conditions. Mr Yadav?s options are rather limited, especially since any recommendation he might offer the governor would tend to be looked at sceptically. Mr Yadav?s credibility has suffered more than once recently in the governor?s eyes. The Congress, which would like to see the last of Mr Yadav at the moment, would obviously not like a BJP partnership government to come in either. Ms Mayawati, meanwhile, has girded up her loins to win back her defectors. But no politician really pays the price for the instability their class creates, the people are there to pay it. They alone are not players on the scene.

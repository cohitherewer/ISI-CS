The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 INITIAL MESS

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India?s most recent revelations indicate that almost every institution involved in the initial public offering process had thrown away the rule-book in its zeal to grab a share of the business. Depository participants encouraged multiple applications, banks had no qualms about ignoring the ?Know Your Customer? norms while depositories conducted their inspections in a perfunctory manner. Hundreds of savings bank accounts have been opened by the same person, thousands of account holders have furnished identical addresses, the signatures of different account holders have been found to be the same and many such accounts have the same introducer. It is clear that there has been collusion on a massive scale, although some of it could have been done under the pressure of gaining a share of the lucrative IPO business. With cut-throat competition in the banking system, it is clear that a blind eye has been turned to risk-containment measures that prove restrictive in attracting business. Given the ease with which the system can be abused, it is a miracle that the size of the scandal has not been bigger.

 But while the market regulator?s dogged pursuit of the IPO scandal deserves commendation, it is also true that it could have gone about the issue in a less ham-handed manner. The announcement that it was keeping its decision against Indiabulls Securities in abeyance a day after the report was made public, for instance, is another dent on the regulator?s reputation. If it could have made a mistake in Indiabulls?s case, so goes the logic, perhaps it could be mistaken in other instances too. In the circumstances, it is a mystery why Sebi did not think it fit to get the views of the parties it has accused in its report before rushing ahead with its order. It will be recalled that when the earlier interim order had been passed a few months ago, the National Securities Depository Limited had complained that it was denied natural justice because its side of the story had not been heard before Sebi passed the order. The regulator?s dismal record in having its orders overturned on appeal should have made it more cautious.

 Nevertheless, the point is that the system has been abused and glaring loopholes have been discovered. The question is: how to fix it? The key issue is to weed out benami and fictitious accounts. This can be done by a unique identification system ? PAN cards are now being touted as the panacea. But even if a fool proof system of identification is introduced, it would not take much to induce slum-dwellers to lend their names to create dummy accounts. In the circumstances, perhaps the best solution would be to remove the special reservation for the so-called small investor.

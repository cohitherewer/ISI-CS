 SIACHEN SOLUTION STILL ELUSIVE

 TWENTY-TWENTY

 BHARAT BHUSHAN

 Waiting for the ice to melt 

 When the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan met last week, there was an expectation that there might be some positive movement forward on the eminently resolvable issue of Siachen. When the foreign secretary of Pakistan, Riaz Mohammad Khan, said that his country was not averse to authentication of troop positions in the Siachen dispute, there was a flicker of hope that the conflict might finally be heading towards resolution.

 That flicker died quickly. Pakistans position in essence was that if India wanted to record the troop positions in Siachen on a particular date, it was fine with Islamabad provided such a recording of positions would not be used to make territorial or other claims in the future; and that it was part of a comprehensive package to resolve the dispute. The package, Pakistan proposed, should include the delineation of the border in the area. This was perhaps seen by India as a new twist.

 The Indian foreign secretary had proposed a three-step plan for resolving Siachen: authentication of ground positions by recording them; agreeing on positions to which the troops of the two sides would withdraw and thereby defining a demilitarized zone; and lastly, agreeing on a verification regime to ensure that neither side moves to capture the area again.

 The Indian proposal was to move one step at a time. Pakistan, suspicious of New Delhis commitment to move forward after the first step, wanted the acceptance of a comprehensive package including the delineation of the undefined border.

 The Siachen dispute has its origins in the cease-fire line of 1949, which marked troop positions after the Karachi agreement. The cease-fire line went northwards till a map position referred to as NJ9842 on the southern end of the Soltoro ridge. This was the last point where troops had been deployed when fighting ended in 1948.The boundary beyond NJ9842 was described in the Karachi agreement as thence north to the glaciers. This phrase has been a major source of confusion since then.

 This cease-fire line was renamed the line of control after the Shimla agreement, but its endpoints remained the same. Indias position is that the boundary north to the glaciers means that it goes through the nearest watershed, the Soltoro ridge. Pakistan draws a line from NJ9842 going northeast to the Karakoram pass.

 The Indian interpretation gives it the control of the Siachen glacier. The Pakistani interpretation claims the entire area up to the Karakoram pass. This includes 4,500 square kilometres of the Shaksgam Valley of Jammu and Kashmir, which Pakistan ceded to China in 1963. The Aksai Chin Highway passes through this area, which India claims was not Islamabads to give away. It is another matter that India was blissfully unaware of the construction of the highway till a decade after it became operational.

 The history of the Indian and Pakistani military misadventures in Siachen is long and tortuous beginning with cartographic aggression by Pakistan in 1978 to show the border going up to the Karakoram pass to the Indian army pre-empting Pakistan in April 1984 by airlifting troops to two of the key passes on the Soltoro ridge Bilafond La and Sia La. Today, all passes on the ridge, except one, are with Indian troops. The Soltoro ridge is to the west of the Siachen glacier which is fully under Indian control.

 The Indian army sees little reason to give up its dominant position on the Soltoro ridge. The military operations have been smoothened and routinized. The presence of troops on the Soltoro ridge allows monitoring of activities not only of the Pakistanis but also in sub-sector North abutting the eastern Karakorams and contiguous to the Shaksgam valley so that India will never be surprised again as happened with the Aksai Chin highway. The army is opposed to withdrawal that leads to asymmetrical deployment of troops there is no glacier to traverse on the Pakistani side and were they to attempt to reoccupy the passes even from Skardu it would take only ten days. If the Indian troops were to withdraw to Turtuk or Leh, it would take them a couple of months to do that.

 India and Pakistan came close to resolving the Siachen dispute twice in 1989 and 1992. In its 1989 proposals, Pakistan wanted troop withdrawal to pre-Shimla positions that would entail India vacating the Soltoro ridge while Pakistan would retain its present positions claiming that they were pre-1971. To maintain the myth that its troops were on Siachen, Pakistan refused to authenticate maps and exchange them because they would show that they were nowhere near the glacier. India wanted a delimitation of the border beyond NJ9842 towards China based on ground realities while Pakistan wanted withdrawal to pre-Shimla positions first and delimitation later. India was not willing to accept demilitarization if it meant only an Indian pullout with the Pakistan troops staying put.

 There could possibly have been a settlement in 1992 around creating a zone of disengagement on either side of the Soltoro ridge, even though Pakistan was still unwilling to record positions on a map, the idea did not find acceptance with the P.V. Narasimha Rao government. Today, once again, a solution to the Siachen dispute seems to be in the offing. But the two sides are caught in an argument of sequential versus simultaneity of approach. Yet, both sides are agreed that troops should be withdrawn from Siachen; both are agreed on creating a demilitarized zone in the area; they also agree that the troops of both sides have to withdraw to mutually agreed positions, and that, finally, there should be a verification mechanism to prevent either side from reoccupying the area. It is also clear that there would have to be delineation of area beyond NJ9842 because it is the undefined nature of the border which has led to the conflict.

 Delineation of the border is not going to be easy considering the claims of the two sides. However, both sides have proposed delineation of the border at different times. India did so in 1989 and Pakistan is proposing delineation now. The principles the two sides propose for delineation may differ. But that should be no reason to continue the unnecessary military engagement at 16,000 feet and above.

 The creation of a demilitarized zone with as symmetric a withdrawal on the two sides as possible and cooperative verification mechanisms to prevent violations are not contradictory to delineation of the border beyond NJ9842. All these issues can be discussed simultaneously. As confidence builds up on both sides, it would become apparent that progress on each front is not going to be the same. However, that should not prevent them from starting the process of military disengagement.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is believed to be personally keen on resolving this unnecessary and wasteful conflict, but not so the Indian security estab- lishment which does not want to give up its position of advantage over Pakistan. 

 If the bureaucracies of the external affairs ministry and the defence ministry on both sides continue to be obdurate rather than coming up with peaceful solutions, then they would have to be overruled by the political leadership. This has already happened in the case of Kashmir which is being discussed through political emissaries.

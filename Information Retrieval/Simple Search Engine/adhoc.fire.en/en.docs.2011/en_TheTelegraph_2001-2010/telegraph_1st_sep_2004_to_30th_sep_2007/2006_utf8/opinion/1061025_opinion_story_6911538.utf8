 DIRE THREAT

 A spectre has come to haunt the information technology sector in Bengal the spectre of union power. To make it especially ominous, it is the Centre of Indian Trade Unions that has taken the lead in this matter. Only the nave would draw solace from the Citus clarification that it is set to form an association, and not a union, of IT employees in the state. Nor should anyone be duped by the assurance given by the Citu president of Bengal, Mr Shyamal Chakraborty, that its union is not to be used for enforcing strikes in the IT sector. Given the Citus record, there are reasons to think quite the opposite. The fact that the Citus decision to form the association comes on the eve of its proposed general strike in December, should be a cause for concern for the IT industry in the state. Also, the Citu and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) refuse to recognize the special nature of the services in the IT industry. They seem to have an inadequate understanding of the global links of the industry, which cannot afford to suffer any disruptions. A Citu-sponsored agitation in the industry can trigger a chain of disruptions in services in different parts of the world. Should that happen, Bengal would again be seen as the original sinner. 

 Ironically, the Citus move is expected to upset Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as much as the employers. The chief minister has made the burgeoning IT sector a symbol of Bengals new industrial culture. He has used the states recent success in the sector in order to woo investments to West Bengal. It is to be seen how Mr Bhattacharjee prepares to face the challenge that his comrades might pose in this area. So far, he has steadfastly insisted on keeping the IT sector free from strikes and any other disruptions. Any sign of a compromise on this approach will send out wrong signals, not only to IT employers and professionals but also to other potential investors. Ultimately, though, the important thing is not a confrontation between the chief minister and the labour wing of his party. The real question is whether Bengals economic interests would be allowed to suffer yet again because of a sectarian ideology. The Citus move also reflects its bondage to discredited ideas about trade unions. That is why CPI(M) leaders will head the association of IT employees. This underscores once again the importance of delinking trade unions from political parties.

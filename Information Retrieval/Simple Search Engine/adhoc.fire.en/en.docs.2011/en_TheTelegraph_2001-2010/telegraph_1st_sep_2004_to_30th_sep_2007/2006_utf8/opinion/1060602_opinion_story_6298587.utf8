 Divided world

 Fluid Bonds: Views on Gender and 

 Water Edited by Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt, 

 Stree, Rs 650

 In today?s globalized world, water is a scarce resource, which is being privatized, marketed and sold. Water is, in fact, ?produced? like any other commodity. This natural element is an integral part of human civilization and shares an intrinsic relationship with the concept of femininity. Water, like gender, is known for its fluidity, for changing its shape and form. Water reflects and mirrors realities. In this book, Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt has tried to show how gender inequality is reflected in the ways water is perceived, represented, managed and controlled. Divided into four broad themes, the articles examine imbalances in the distribution of power, entitlement and decision-making regarding the uses of water. The articles touch upon general discourses on gender and water. They also highlight specific case studies of water projects in countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Australia and South Africa. Finally, the role of women?s agency in water management has also been addressed in these essays.

 M. Zwarteveen and R. Boelens state that in most parts of the world, the formal division of property rights over land and water is extremely skewed in favour of men. While talking about the implications of water management in Australia, M. Alston argues that agricultural policy in the country has been largely gender insensitive. F. Sultana?s article on arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh points out how the existent patriarchal norms identify appropriate gendered relations to water, while Lahiri-Dutt explores the ways in which rivers have been traditionally constructed as feminine entities in Bengal. Folk literature has often compared rivers to women and cited both as nourishing, benevolent, yet fearsome creatures. Some of the articles reveal that women sometimes play a crucial role in the management and distribution of water. J. Davidson and E. Stratford state that when it comes to water sustainability, women are actively involved in community-based approaches. B. Koppen, T. Khumbana, M. Lange and N. Mohapi have referred to a case study, which shows that agricultural relations are more gender equitable in South Africa than anywhere else in the world. N. Raby, in her article, has analysed the role of Stella Mendoza, the first woman to be elected to the board of directors of the Imperial Irrigation Valley, California. 

 A few articles also talk about gender and water management in rural India. A. Shah examines the public irrigation system and its relationship with poor women in rural Gujarat. Shah is of the view that the involvement of women in irrigation management through active participation is imperative for improving canal management in rural communities. P. Banerjee and S. Chandrasekhar study a large data set covering households from all over India and find that families are interested in contributing to water and sanitation improvement projects. Water-resource management is a major issue facing India but community-based, demand-driven programmes are yet to evolve in the country.

 This book uses a gender lens to look at water and thus talks about issues such as equal rights and entitlements. A hitherto unexplored area, this volume throws light on some critical areas and should interest scholars of development studies, gender relations as well as policy-makers all around the world.

 Letters to Editor

 Surviving hunger

 Sir ? Malvika Singh probably wishes to revive Indira Gandhi?s most controversial and politically incorrect dictums ? ?Beggary hatao? (?From the mean streets?, March 24). Unfortunately, today the job might prove to be more difficult than it was during Mrs Gandhi?s time. And for that Singh needs to thank Manmohan Singh, in whom she seems to have a great deal of faith. For Singh should realize that it is the reformist policies of this man that has sharpened the rich-poor divide and has given Delhi its increasing number of beggars.

 Yours faithfully, 

A. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Terror trail

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Train of terror? (March 17), is right in noting that the Maoist upsurge is a revolt mainly of the tribal people, and that the regional underdevelopment shows the ?dark underbelly of India?s brave economy?. All this obviously indicates the complete failure of the welfare state. Add to this government efficiency, particularly in checking Maoist ruthlessness being directed towards the ordinary people, and you have a recipe for disaster. The latest incident where a train full of passengers were taken captive for hours in Jharkhand, only indicates that the rebels are growing bold. To check the menace certain basic questions have to be asked. If the problem is lack of economic development, what is being done about it? And do tribals really lose out in the nation?s march towards development and progress? But before the answers are provided, the government should become more vigilant about security, particularly at the transit points. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut K. Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? By attacking the Jehanabad jail in November 2005, the Maoists had already given us a hint of their growing aggression. But the government had wishfully ignored it. Then followed a slew of killings and finally the train hijack. The Maoists have not only thrown a challenge to the security of the country, but are also sending us a warning about any possible uprising. West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand and Chattisgarh have become Maoist bastions now. It is time the Central and state governments launched a concerted drive to tackle the Maoist insurgency.

Yours faithfully, 

Abhishek Law, Calcutta 

Sir ? The Maoist militants are getting out of hand. Bihar has for long been deemed unsafe for train travel. But this time the way an entire train has been hijacked shows that something needs to be done immediately about the country?s internal security mechanism. The number of Railway Protection Force personnel attending to trains passing through Bihar at night has to be increased. Railways are the lifeline of the country and part of our national heritage. The country?s administration has to be more pro-active in dealing with the Maoists. 

Yours faithfully, 

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta 

 Forgotten

 Sir ? Krishnan Srinivasan bemoans the decline of National Library (?In a state of ruin?, March 8). The Commercial Library at 1, Council House Street, has fallen into evil days as well. Established in the prime days of the raj, it has a collection of rare H.H. Wilson?s gazetteers, old chronicles of economic and commercial activities, the Birdwood collection, the Wealth of India series, old census reports and a host of economic and statistical journals. P.B. Roy, its first technically qualified librarian, had put in an adorable effort. Today, there is no qualified librarian, no new purchases are being made and a public library is being transformed into a departmental library. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manojendu Majumdar, Calcutta

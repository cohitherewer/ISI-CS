 Letters to Editor

 A hard nut to crack

 Sir It is hard to understand why a person of Natwar Singhs stature had to get involved in the petty oil-for-food scandal (Jaya melts Natwar, Aug 8). Even more surprising was his behaviour once his name was inextricably linked to the scandal. Instead of lying low and letting the issue die, he started making defiant noises in and outside parliament. The role of the National Democratic Alliance, Samajwadi Party and the left in siding with Natwar Singh shows up these parties in very poor light. Do they support Singhs act and want to prevent the government from taking steps against him and his son? 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir A lot has been said about the former external affairs minister, Natwar Singh, and his culpability in the oil quota scam. It is surprising, however, that there is not a word about how the country is functioning without a full-time foreign minister of cabinet rank. The prime minister and the Congress should not have allowed Indias foreign affairs to be run by a handful of bureaucrats since last October, when Singh resigned. It was as if he had been asked to go on a sabbatical like some university professor awaiting the final verdict of the Pathak committee. With an able foreign minister, India could have played a more active role in the current west Asia crisis. The spats with Pakistan are taking a turn for the worse. The prime minister should no more be saddled with the responsibility of managing this crucial portfolio on a part-time basis, especially since the country is one of the prime targets of terrorist attacks.

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

 Sir Natwar Singh has issued a privilege notice regarding the alleged leak of the Pathak inquiry report before the media. His allegation is justified; such a confidential report must not be disclosed to the public before it is tabled in parliament. At the same time, Singh should not have sided with the opposition against the governments stand on the nuclear deal with the United States of America. Singhs behaviour goes against the norms of parliamentary practice. But the Congress-led government is not really bothered with that, it is only angry with Singhs recent closeness to the opposition. Instead of taking Singhs actions personally, the government should order an investigatiom into all the oil coupon holders, including the Reliance group. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi

 Sir The headline, Leak helps Natwar, heat on PM (Aug 5), may carry an impression that Natwar Singh, now cornered by the findings of the Pathak probe, is in desperate need of help. But has he really been found guilty by the Pathak committee? Most people had already started believing that the committee would find Singh guiltyof all the charges. But in reality, the probe report clearly states that Natwar Singh and his son have derived no financial benefit from the oil-for-food deal. Yet, the Congress has not fully exonerated them. According to the report, Singh and his son, Jagat, have misused their posts to acquire oil coupons. But both have pointed out that they did not hold any positions of power that could be misused at that point of time. The fact that R.S. Pathak, the head of the probe committee, had given a letter of recommendation to Jagat Singh for admission into a British law college is also an interesting revelation in this context. Who exactly is trying to hide here?

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir Since politics makes strange bedfellows, the new-found intimacy between the Samajwadi Party leader, Amar Singh, and the cornered Natwar Singh does not prove anything (Amar angles for lonely Natwar, Aug 6). But it is true that the Congress needs to be more wary of the oppositions designs. The kind of unease and indecisiveness Manmohan Singh is showing on almost every issue, it seems that the United Progressive Alliance will soon be in trouble. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Natwar Singhs threat to disclose uncomfortable secrets of the top brass if he is made to bear the brunt of the Volcker report amounts to little other than blackmailing the government. But it will not help in lifting the charges against him. Neither does such behaviour become a former cabinet minister. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir Strange are the ways of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition party in the Lok Sabha. In the aftermath of the Volcker report, the party, with its allies, was baying for Natwar Singhs blood and had even demanded his arrest. Now, after the Pathak Report, the same party is rallying behind him. Whether the report was leaked or not is a non-issue for the common man, who is only interested in the findings. But the BJPs aim is to distract the government. The previous BJP-led regime had begun the process of nuclear cooperation with the US but now condemns the UPA for carrying on with it. Few parties care about national security, but the BJP and the Samajwadi Party less than the rest. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Hashim Kidwai, New Delhi

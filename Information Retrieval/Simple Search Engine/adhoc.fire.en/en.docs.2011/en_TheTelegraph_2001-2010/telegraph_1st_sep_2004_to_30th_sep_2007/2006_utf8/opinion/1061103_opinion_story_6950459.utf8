The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BATTLE GROUND

 Calcutta, as its keepers often like to remind themselves, is a city of traditions. One of the most important among these is certainly the Book Fair. It happens every year a celebration of not only the love of books, but also of the citys robust unconcern for the preservation of its own resources. This combination of intellectualism and callousness is uniquely Calcuttan. And if one must invoke tradition here, then it has surely become, by now, an essential element of Bengali culture. With ridiculous predictability, the feud between the army and the state government has flared up again over the Book Fairs venue. The army, as custodian of the Maidan, has refused to give a no-objection certificate for its conversion into a fairground. The state government is trying to make it change its mind. The army, in response, has cited the high courts original objection to such an abuse of the environment. But when have the courts objections and rulings mattered in West Bengal? Last year, the Central defence minister pressured the army officers here to retract their objections. The court agreed to relax its stand for the last time, and the government gave its word to shift the venue of the next years fair, by which time the other fairground on the Bypass would be completed. 

 Nothing of the sort has happened, of course, and now, the government has cunningly shifted its stance. Its latest excuse is not that the new grounds are still incomplete, but that even if they were complete, they would be too small to accommodate this traditionally immense Book Fair. This is the bureaucratic shiftiness by which several other atrocities are routinely carried out in the city. It is this tendency that has made it impossible for Calcutta to reduce its murderous levels of air pollution caused by vehicular emission. The governments much-vaunted love of books, and of culture, merrily coexists with such brazen forms of destructive lawlessness. However, the post-fair filth and ravage on the Maidan every year bother very few citizens. Largely illiterate tribal communities treat their public festive spaces with far more hygiene and respect than Calcuttas famously book-loving aesthetes.

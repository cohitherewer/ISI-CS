 STILL READING

 The link between private pleasures and technology has always been ambivalent. Reading is traditionally cherished as a solitary activity, the pleasure of which is seen to be as much in the actual physical handling of the book as in the intellectual and imaginative stimuli it provides. Similarly, the history of ?Literature? has also been the history of the book ? of paper, ink, typefaces, bindings and other material aspects of the book as a physical object. Hence the advent of electronic books and of increasingly sophisticated e-reading devices is surely an important moment in the history of reading. And understandably, it is a moment of anxiety. Will the latest technology somehow devalue the experience of reading? At a more commercial level, should traditional publishers feel threatened by such gadgetry? 

 The new Sony Reader ? a hand-held, paperback-sized device for reading e-books ? is the new peg on which such old fears are now being hung. Interestingly, its electronic paper and ink seek to replicate as closely as possible the physical experience of reading a book. Turning a page is the only old pleasure that the reader will have to forfeit. But his access to texts, and the range of operations he can perform with and upon them, have been considerably enhanced by such a device. Not only portability and access, but also working with the texts themselves becomes part of the everyday activity of reading. The Sony Reader also necessitates the coming together of electronic companies and the leading publishing houses. Random House and HarperCollins, for instance, might offer most of their front- and back-lists on sale for users of the Sony Reader. All this suggests a revolution in the consumption of texts comparable to the profound changes in the experience of listening to ? and therefore the marketing of ? music brought about by the iPod in affluent societies or sections of society. After all, e-books accounted for only 0.1 per cent of the 2.3 billion books American publishers sold worldwide in 2004. It is paradoxical that a device that hugely facilitates access to books is, in itself, still out of reach for immense swathes of the world?s reading population. For these people, the experience of sitting down to read War and Peace remains inextricable from feeling the actual physical weight and thickness of the classic.

 Onion curry for the soul

 Brand Bollywood (Sage, Rs 325) by Derek Bose is a celebration of a new global entertainment order brought in by filmmakers like Karan Johar and Aditya Chopra, who are credited as the inspiration behind the book. The Hindi film industry today is significantly different from what it used to be. The song-and-dance routines, garish spectacles and fainting heroines have given way to a cinema that realistically depicts the lives of post-globalized Indians. For Bose, the credit for this change goes to the new batch of producer-directors who have combined the art of film-making with the business of entertainment. He backs his contentions with detailed market research to prove that in a world in which the various kinds of media are converging fast, it is no longer possible to produce a flop. 

 Inner strength (Exhibit Media, Rs 150) by Purnima Vasudeva is a narrative about the authors fight with cancer, her recovery and discovery thereof the hidden reserves of the mind. Subtitled A true story of a cancer patients battle against all odds in life, it reads like an account straight out of the pages of Readers Digest. There are chapters entitled Succor from the superpower, and Dos and donts for the soul and body. While none will doubt the seriousness of Vasudevas ordeal, one hopes to have been spared of the clichs of supportive family members, the edifying vignettes of family life and the profusion of gratitude for the Supreme Power.

Onion Curry amp; the nine times table (Women Unlimited, Rs 175) edited by G.S Jayasree and Sreedevi K. Nair is a part of the Samyukta Anthology of Malayalam Stories. The lived life of contemporary Malayalam women is woven into tales in which mundane chores and dreams intersperse. Women take pleasure in the beauty of their bodies and break free of the men who exploit them. And in writing about their experience they create a language that defies the patriarchal norms encoded in it.

 So, you mean, this is not the real world? (Frog, Rs 200) by John Kelly ends with a poem entitled To live in hope is life renewed, which marks the authors emergence from the dark night of the soul. Recommended for those who know that they possess the divine spark but have lost the technique to rekindle it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Devils advocate

 Sir The judiciary must award the strictest possible punishment to rape and murder convicts. Ram Jethmalani, perhaps the best-known lawyer in the country, has recently agreed to defend Manu Sharma, the accused in the Jessica Lal murder case (Jessica case, Nov 4). He should not forget that the case has been reopened owing to public pressure. And if the people of the country put their will in one place, then all Ram Jethmalanis shrewd legal sense cannot save Manu Sharma. 

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Roy, Calcutta

 Sir The fact that the veteran criminal lawyer, Ram Jethmalani, has agreed to fight Manu Sharmas case illustrates in one sweep why there is no let up in the crime-rate in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ram Jethmalani has a dubious record of criticizing judges and trying to bend the law to suit his clients purpose. He was forced out of the National Democratic Alliance cabinet in July 2002 after he criticized the chief justice of India, A.S. Anand. He also wanted the Delhi high court to transfer the Jessica Lal case. Earlier, Jethmalani was also moved from the urban development ministry following charges of irregularity. Finally, he was booted out as the law minister too. An old case comes to mind. One lieutenant-general, posted in Pune, was to be court-martialled for corruption, and was forbidden to leave Pune without permission from the commandant of the National Defence Academy, Pune. Whom did this lieutenant-general hire as his lawyer? Ram Jethmalani, of course. The lawyer asked his client to leave Pune and not come back till the date of his retirement. Needless to say, the client retired without being court-martialled. The same lawyer now claims that public criticism does not bother him. What more could we expect?

 Yours faithfully,

Ravindra Rao, Pune

 Sir To establish himself as the top criminal lawyer of the country, one has to prove that he can win cases even for those notorious criminals who commit murder before hundreds of witnesses. Ram Jethmalani has placed himself among the countrys best criminal lawyers by fighting the cases of the accused in Indira Gandhis assassination, the Hinduja Brothers, aides of Dawood Ibrahim, S.A.R. Geelani and many others. For such invaluable service to the nation, he was welcomed into the Rajya Sabha. 

 In trying to defend Manu Sharma, Jethmalani is trying to convince the court and everyone else that Sharma was the victim of a trial by the media. Ironically, he talks more on television about his cases than journalists talk about them. What happens if he loses the case, which has shaken the conscience of the whole country? And what if he wins? Will it shake the nations faith in the judicial system?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The sudden contention of Ram Jethmalani that some tall Sikh man, and not Manu Sharma, killed Jessica Lal is astounding (Sikh shocker in Jessica case, Nov 8). The lawyers confident statement would make one feel that he was present at the place and time of the crime. But the real intention of Jethmalani is to let the case drag on for another decade or so. Such devious attempts should be nipped in the bud. The tall Sikh must be, to rephrase a comment from the famous Madame Bovary trial, a monstrous creation of the degenerated imagination of Ram Jethmalani. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Wrong prescription

 Sir Ashok Mitra is well-known for venting his private anger in public forum, notably in this page. But Poison as prescription (Oct 30) has a touch of the comic. He takes a dig at the West Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, but would not name him. Call him A, he says, much like the Victorian custom among old Bengalis of describing the wife as the sons mother, for instance Bholar ma. Mitra disapproves of the chief minister seeking the prime ministers help in persuading Jharkhand to supply iron ore (not crude iron as he describes it) to a steel plant that the Jindal Group had otherwise agreed to set up in West Bengal. In arguing his case, he presumes that the West Bengal chief minister is an ignoramus who is unfamiliar with the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that lays down the powers under Union, State and Concurrent lists. Its pure humbug.

 In the process, Mitra has betrayed how slipshod he is. He says Entry 18 on the State List gives states the power to hold on to their mineral resources. But this power is under Entry 23, about the regulation of mines and mineral development, Entry 18 being on the entirely different subject of land, land tenures and collection of rents. It is good for Bhattacharjee that he hasnt consulted the unique copy of the Constitution of India that must be in Mitras possession!

 If Bhattacharjee, instead of raising this matter before the prime minister, had gone to Ranchi to talk to the chief minister of the BJP-ruled state, as Mitra has sagely advised, the same Mitra would have accused the chief minister of supping with the devil. That surely would have led to another hec- toring piece on ideological dereliction. Mitras Constitution-thumping is getting curiouser after the election to the Rajya Sabha from the West Bengal assembly of two non-residents, Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat. Maybe he is upset with the state leaders for an exclusion.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumit Mitra, New Delhi

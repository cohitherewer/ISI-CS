 DRIVE WITH 

 CAUTION 

 The government must wake up to the 

 pitfalls that lie on the road to full capital account convertibility, 

 writes Sunanda Sen 

 Colour green 

 Recent announcements by high offices 

 in the country that India will soon be in league with the 

 club of nations having full capital account convertibility 

 fulfils a long-awaited promise, as was officially endorsed 

 in the Tarapore committee?s recommendations in 1977. The 

 crisis in south-east Asia came up within months during the 

 same year, reversing the direction of policy-making in India. 

 The announcements on full convertibility point to some positive 

 signals in the economy which seem to have prepared the ground 

 for the development which would permit the resident Indian 

 to convert rupee into any foreign currency and in any country 

 without any restrictions. The other restrictions on capital 

 flows, by foreigners and non-residents, had been scrapped 

 earlier.

 The official stance relies on 

 the ?strong fundamentals? in the economy ? stable prices, 

 GDP growth exceeding 8 per cent, the surpluses in trade 

 balance over the last few years and the unprecedentedly 

 high stock of official reserves at nearly $140 billion. 

 Finally the steady inflow of capital with a pro-active management 

 of exchange rate, monetary policy as well as inflation targets 

 provide additional grounds for the optimism to prompt the 

 proposal. 

 It is thus time to celebrate, 

 not only for the moneyed elite in India who had been justifiably 

 waiting to reorganize their portfolio, but also for the 

 ruling elite who can now seek membership, like Mexico or 

 Turkey, in rich country clubs like the Organization for 

 Economic Cooperation and Development. In addition, the expected 

 reductions in the capital account surpluses may help the 

 government achieve a corresponding cut in the fiscal deficit 

 and the goal of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management 

 Act by lowering the current account deficit. 

 There remain, however, a few pointers 

 which dispel the optimism surrounding the endorsement of 

 full convertibility at the moment. One of them is the possibility 

 of opening the floodgates of legalized capital transfers 

 abroad by domestic residents in order to avail of the lower 

 tax rates abroad, or even parking such funds in tax havens 

 like Mauritius. The requisite legal hurdles are likely to 

 be overcome without much difficulty, and the process may 

 soon turn out to be a bonanza for changing the colour of 

 money owned by the rich . 

 Monetary and fiscal surveillance 

 of the economy, which till now has been successfully guided 

 by national exigencies, would have to face additional hurdles 

 in terms of the newly achieved mobility of domestic capital 

 following full covertibility. This would entail the ?trilemma? 

 faced by countries in managing the exchange rate while following 

 an autonomous monetary policy with full capital account 

 convertibility. Would the country?s central bank be able 

 to avoid a run on the exchange rate if the tools of national 

 monetary management (say the market stabilization scheme 

 and the liquidity adjustment facility, which are currently 

 used to sterilize the expansions in money supply resulting 

 from the augmented official reserves) are rendered ineffective? 

 Possibilities of money transfers 

 by residents on a legal basis would also make it obligatory, 

 if not mandatory, on part of the monetary authorities to 

 maintain a parity between domestic and foreign interest 

 rates. The added responsibility would further erode the 

 social priorities for credit disbursements in the economy 

 which are being steadily dismantled in terms of financial 

 de-regulation. To identify the market-oriented priorities 

 of credit today, the respective flows of loans towards housing 

 and real estates moved up by 44.6 per cent and 90.3 per 

 cent during 2004-05, which contrasts with the moderate increases 

 of around 35 per cent and 15 per cent respectively for agriculture 

 and small sector industry during the year, notwithstanding 

 the fact that these provide a major share of employment 

 in the country. 

 Stock exchanges have been experiencing 

 a bull run for some time. These are well funded, both with 

 domestic credit and net inflows of foreign institutional 

 investors? funds. The latter speaks for closer integration 

 with major international capital markets, as can be observed 

 from the rising correlations of equity indices. While the 

 continuity of these flows of portfolio finance, as in any 

 other international financial centre, is subject to the 

 expected movements in the relative rates of risk-adjusted 

 returns, these inflows count heavily in India, both with 

 their weight in net inflows of foreign finance as in additions 

 to the stock of officially held reserves. 

 Net inflows of FII at $8.2 billion 

 during 2004-05 was more than two-thirds of the aggregate 

 net inflow of foreign capital at $12.1 billion during 2004-05. 

 During the same year, FII flows added $12.7 billion to India?s 

 official reserves out of $31.6 billion contributed by aggregate 

 net flows of capital. The remaining part of net capital 

 inflows are accounted for by the current increase in debt-creating 

 flows of capital, largely due to the recent spurts in imports 

 and the related trade deficit which has re-surfaced. Would 

 the government be able to manage the exchange rate and avoid 

 a financial crisis if the domestic residents too join the 

 bandwagon along with the FIIs in time of a crisis? 

 The rather reckless recommendations 

 of the ruling elite in support of a quick implementation 

 of full convertibility for the country is being contested. 

 The arguments provided here need serious consideration. 

 These facts do not stem from a blind adherence to controls 

 and state-craft as may be alleged, but from a careful scrutiny 

 of facts documented in official statistics. The analysis 

 alerts the policy-makers to the possible pitfalls which 

 the country cannot ignore .

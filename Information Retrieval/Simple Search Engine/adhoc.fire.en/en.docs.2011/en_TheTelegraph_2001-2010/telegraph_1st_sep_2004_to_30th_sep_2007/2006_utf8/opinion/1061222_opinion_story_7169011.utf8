 Telling Tales

 VILLAGE OF PAINTERS: NARRATIVE SCROLLS FROM WEST BENGAL (Museum of New Mexico, $29.95) is a masterly work. Frank J. Korom rsquo;s text and the photographs by Paul J. Smutko present the remarkable history of this unique art-form, its rich traditions and changing facets through the voices of the painters themselves. Patuas in Naya, a village in Midnapore, reveal the secrets of their survival in the face of the challenges that communalism and globalization have thrown up in rural Bengal. To keep pace, the chitrakars have not only changed the subjects of their stories mdash; they tell tales of the ldquo;Oil Trade Centre rdquo; attack with as much eacute;lan as those on demons and wicked daughters-in-law. They have also taken their art to the cities, even those across the seas. Their stories still have a high moral content. Far left (above) is a take on Calcutta, and on the left is a portrayal of the goings-on aboard the Titanic, which, the artist feels, sank it.

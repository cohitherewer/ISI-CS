 ALL THAT IS 

 IN THE NAME 

 What North-east India needs is a change 

 in the way of thinking that will integrate international and 

 domestic politics, writes Sanjib Baruah 

 Under watch 

 The phrase ?North-east India? 

 entered the Indian lexicon only in 1971. Until 2003, the 

 phrase referred to the seven states, separated from the 

 Indian landmass by Bhutan and Bangladesh except for the 

 37-kilometre Siliguri corridor. The phrase, it bears repeating, 

 originates in changes made to the architecture of governance 

 of the region, including the creation of a number of small 

 states that culminated in the North Eastern Council in 1971. 

 National security considerations 

 were pre-eminent in the advent of the category ?North-east 

 India?. It is perhaps not accidental that 1971 saw another 

 dramatic change in the region?s political geography. Pakistan 

 was split and Bangladesh became independent. The Sixties 

 were tumultuous years. India and China fought a war in 1962, 

 the movement for Naga independence got into full swing and 

 the Mizo armed insurgency began in 1966. After the humiliating 

 defeat in the war with China, Indian policymakers began 

 to fear that external and domestic enemies could come together 

 in the region and mount a formidable threat to national 

 security. By intervening in the Bangladesh war, India, to 

 some extent, took advantage of an opportunity that arose 

 to change that geopolitical ground reality. But the fact 

 that the category ?North-east? too had its roots in the 

 same set of national security considerations has escaped 

 public memory. 

 Even though the North Eastern 

 Council has had to gradually adapt to the reality of democracy, 

 that is not how it began. It was envisaged as an institution 

 to promote security and development. Initially, it did not 

 even include the chief ministers of the states. It was made 

 up of the governors. A military man, the inspector-general 

 of the Assam Rifles, was its security adviser.

 B.P. Singh, who had held key positions 

 both in the region and in the Indian home ministry, has 

 written about having to struggle with the challenge of making 

 the NEC fit into the constitutional framework of federalism 

 in The Problem of Change: A Study of Northeast 

 India. The NEC was technically made an advisory body 

 so that ?it would not infringe upon the political autonomy 

 of the constituent units?, but this came into conflict with 

 autonomy. From a security perspective, however, such tensions 

 were seen as inevitable, given the constraints of ?nation 

 building? in a border region. The best the NEC could do 

 was conduct itself in a way that would not ?hurt the sensitivities 

 of member units and make them feel like second class states 

 in India?s federal structure.? As it became more democratic, 

 its security function became weaker. But that does not mean 

 that the security function devolved to the state governments. 

 It shifted directly to the Union home ministry. 

 With the advent of the phrase 

 ?North-east India?, the area became a ?border area? and 

 a security space in a way that it wasn?t till then. The 

 very naming of the region carries with it the burden of 

 that legacy. After all, directional names reflect an external 

 and not a local point of view. 

 While Pakistan after 1971 became 

 a smaller country, Bangladesh did not stay India-friendly 

 for long. Indian officials even believe that in recent years, 

 it has become hospitable to Pakistani intelligence operations 

 in India. While Bangladesh is ?India-locked,? says Bangladesh?s 

 foreign minister, India must remember that North-east India 

 is ?Bangladesh locked.? This could be a wake up call for 

 Indian policy-makers, but not in the sense that the security 

 establishment might interpret it. 

 Ninety-nine per cent of North-east 

 India?s borders is with foreign countries, making it impossible 

 to separate domestic and foreign policy. To transform the 

 region from a ?political, economic and cultural hinterland? 

 into a vital zone of activities, it is not enough to build 

 roads to India. The region?s international borders would 

 have to become spaces of cooperation instead of confrontation. 

 A small example would illustrate this. The distance between 

 Calcutta and Agartala before Partition was about 300 kms. 

 It became 1,700 kms after Partition. Even the best roads 

 in the world cannot make up for this difference. 

 It is not surprising, therefore, 

 that while enormous amount of money has been spent to bring 

 about development here, especially since the Nineties, by 

 the end of that decade the economies of the entire region 

 had decelerated. Not being able to take the transnational 

 dimension into account has been the bane of Indian policy 

 vis-?-vis the North-east. Of course, in its own way, 

 the security establishment does take the transnational dimension 

 into account. But transnationalism from its vantage point 

 has little meaning beyond wanting India?s neighbours to 

 cooperate in counter-insurgency strategy. 

 Meanwhile, our security obsession 

 has put real limits on what we could and could not do for 

 development. The contradictions are perhaps the sharpest 

 in the smaller hill states. Development policy there amounts 

 to trying to create an elite to support the pan-Indian dispensation. 

 In the make-believe world of formal rules, the ?traditional? 

 economies and political structures of the hills are being 

 protected: for tribal lands, in theory, are owned by the 

 community. But in reality, there has been a capture of community 

 resources by local elites and a massive transformation of 

 the de facto ownership of land and natural resources 

 that eludes government land records. Indeed there is no 

 cadastral survey of most tribal lands because they are supposedly 

 community-owned. While a small elite may have developed 

 a financial stake in the pan-Indian dispensation, one cannot 

 say that about hearts and minds. Ideas about independence 

 and autonomy remain attractive to both the educated youth 

 and to losers in the transformation of property relations 

 taking place outside the make-believe world. 

 In the meantime, as economists 

 like Atul Sarma has pointed out, the absence of a land market 

 has meant that neither formal credit nor investments can 

 enter the rural economy, especially from outside. Even though 

 the contradictions are apparent, our style of policy-making, 

 that prioritizes (but does not achieve) political stability 

 in a ?sensitive border region?, has meant postponing all 

 hard policy choices to an indefinite future. Without borders 

 becoming spaces of cooperation, policy debates about the 

 region can never address those fundamental dilemmas. 

 North-east India needs a major 

 shift towards a way of thinking that integrates international 

 and domestic politics. India?s foreign policy towards its 

 neighbours and domestic policy towards the North-east have 

 to come together, and in doing so, it has to come out of 

 the iron-grip of our security-wallahs.

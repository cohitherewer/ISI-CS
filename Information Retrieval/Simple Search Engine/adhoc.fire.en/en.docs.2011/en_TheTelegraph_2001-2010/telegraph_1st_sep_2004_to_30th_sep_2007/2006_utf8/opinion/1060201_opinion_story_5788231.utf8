 LOCAL WRONGS

 The stigma against HIV/AIDS in rural Bengal remains a complicated phenomenon. A young man and his wife, living with AIDS in a village in east Midnapore, have been ordered to vacate the man?s familial home within six months. This ?sentence? has been passed by none other than the panchayat pradhan of the village ? a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) ? at the end of a shalishi session in the panchayat office. There is another dimension to this. The pradhan was acting here on behalf of the parents of the patient who appealed to the village leader to help them evict their son and daughter-in-law. What the parents wanted to spare themselves was not so much the ?risk? of contamination, as social opprobrium, although some other inhabitants of the village have publicly expressed their approval of the couple living in the family home. What is the cause of this sense of shame? The man had gone away from his farmers? family to Mumbai as a goldsmith, got infected there, and had come back home to infect his wife, who has now been packed off to her parents? home. The husband has now moved out of his home and lives on his own in the village.

 Brutal stigma, born largely out of ignorance, has found here a shocking endorsement from the local political system. The shalishi courts are a particularly oppressive manifestation of the abuse of power ? party-political as well as feudal and patriarchal ? within the system of local governance in rural Bengal. These are often the courts that order rapists to marry their victims, or the criminal?s family to work out financial settlements with the woman?s family. It is also significant that the patient is part of an HIV/AIDS support group, some of the members of which were present during the proceedings, but watched helplessly as the verdict was pushed through. A man in need of medical and community support was brought into public confrontation with the family, the panchayat and the party in order to be pushed into further vulnerability. And his wife?s predicament is probably worse, typically rendered invisible and with even less of a voice than her husband. While the government quibbles over whether leprosy ? another savagely stigmatized but perfectly curable illness ? has been ?eliminated? or ?eradicated? in India, the challenges of HIV/AIDS continue to meet with inhuman cluelessness.

 COUNSEL TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL

 The International Struggle over Iraq: Politics in the UN Security Council, 1980-2005 By David M. Malone, Oxford, Rs 595

 The subject and the author of this book are both remarkable. The UN Security Council and the struggle over Iraq have occupied the centre stage of international relations longer than most people would care to remember. The author David Malone is currently Canadas high commissioner in New Delhi. He is diplomat, academic, writer and policy-maker all rolled into one. He has known the workings of the United Nations from the inside since he was the Canadian ambassador to the UN in New York. He brings to this book his learning, his wisdom and his experience.

 That the question of Iraq created a crisis of sorts within the Security Council goes without saying. The sense of crisis and the aftermath of the fall in confidence continue to haunt the worlds most important international forum. But this crisis or perhaps crises is the better word was predicated on the tortuous and complex history of Iraq under the tyrannical rule of Saddam Hussein.

 The Security Council has been compelled to engage with Iraq for over 25 years. The engagement has never been either smooth or easy. According to Malone himself, this volume traces four major trends: (i) the instrumental multilateralism of all the five permanent members on the Council; (ii) the emergence of new threats, and questions of legality and legitimacy, representation and democracy; (iii) the underlying revolutionary trajectory of Council practice, away from a politico-military mode in which it mediated between warring states, to a mode in which it sits at the apex of a global legal-regulatory architecture; and (d) the emergence of a comprehensive approach to peace, justice, security and development.

 The Iraq crisis of 2002-03 and the Councils inability to deal with it successfully opened up two contending forms of instrumentalism for the P-5. One was to treat the Council as the only available legitimizing resource; the other was to treat it as a long-term player in international stability. The P-5 failed to make up its mind on either of the two options. This was aggravated by the Security Councils acquiescence in, and later inability to stop, US military enforcement of Council resolutions. This eroded the UNs and the Councils credibility. It created for the Security Council, what Malone tellingly calls, a legitimacy deficit.

 Through its engagement with Iraq, the role and the vision of the Security Council have changed. It has moved to functioning through the legal-regulatory mode whereby it establishes detailed rules governing the behaviour of States, individuals or other subject entities. This somewhat begs the question whether the Council remains an effective body to manage conflict in the world. Will this effectiveness increase if the Council was made more representative by expanding the P-5 to P-6 or P-7? This pertains to the overall relevance of a body like the Security Council in a world dominated by one super power.

 By charting a clear path for the Security Councils functioning over Iraq and by offering a compelling analysis of the Iraq problem and the role of the Council, Malone makes readers ask difficult questions. His own tone is measured and almost detached. But it is easy to discern that behind the cool analysis and the clear prose, there is a mind at work, a mind that is as sharp as it is penetrating.

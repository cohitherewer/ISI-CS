The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 REFINED AND CLEAN

Malvika Singh

 The Punjabi suit has taken over the dress code in south India. Sad but true. Those wonderful woven saris that typify Tamil Nadu are now rarely seen on the streets of its cities and small towns except on special occasions like a wedding. But at one such wedding, it was evident that there has been a rather splendid revival of the great weaving techniques and skills of India. Women were draped in ?fine works of art?, celebrating the master skills of India, ranging from Banarasi saris to Paithanis and Kanjeevarams. It was difficult to spot an indifferent piece of unstitched cloth. That was the difference ? acute sensitivity in the unstitched cottons and silks juxtaposed with the rather flashy and unaesthetically put-together salwar-kameez suits. We knew how to create style that was intrinsic to our life and culture, but were unable to give the same vitality to what is alien. And so it should be. 

 Driving from Coimbatore to Guruvayoor in Kerala, it was a joy to see how prosperous and civilized the countryside is. It was much like what you see when driving through Uttaranchal. With the exception of some pools of plastic disposals in the corner of urban marketplaces, Kerala is clean and confident, unlike most north Indian states. Guruvayoor was spotless. The road leading up to the temple was spotless. The shops on either side did their business with quiet dignity. No beggars, no pimps. People walking to the shrine to offer their prayers did so with a sense of spirituality. This was in contrast to Varanasi where the streets are filthy, where vendors virtually compel you into their shops, where beggars and pimps harass you. Only Hindus are allowed to enter both. 

 In the broader context, we are the same people. We belong to the same culture. We share the same traditions, the same history. Why is one part of India unable to dispel dirt and filth from its immediate environment and the other able with ease to give dignity to its public spaces? In the private space, in the kitchen and the home, all of India is clean. 

 Culture at its best

 Indians are allowed into the great temples of Brihadeshwara and Chidambaram. Indians are not allowed into Guruvayoor, only Hindus are. I had to leave my husband, a Sikh, outside the entrance when I went in to witness the lighting of the countless lamps that happens each day ? lit with concentrated devotion ? and to light one myself. It was indescribable. First, the two enormous diyas came alive with devotees using a lit stick to light the topmost wicks, and then, as the hour progressed, all the endless small diyas wrapped around the length and breadth of the outer wall of the sanctum twinkled into the dark of the night. Devotees, waiting silently in queues to get a darshan, thronged the courtyard without any pushing. It was, for me, the strongest symbol of austere faith and true spiritual devotion.

 This was followed by dance recitals in the public auditorium outside the entrance. The final dance was one that will be etched in my memory for all time. Mrinalini Sarabhai danced here at Guruvayoor with her daughter, Mallika, her granddaughter and grandson. Three generations all together. There were hundreds of people, who watched the performance, mesmerized by particularly Mrinalini who, at the age of 88 was as graceful as she was decades ago, and as agile as when she played the older Mirabai, with Mallika as the young Mira. It was a dedication to Guruvayoor, at the time of the marriage of Rajshree Pathy?s daughter.

 It was a wonderful experience. No one was a VIP ? that dreadful ?Delhi? reality that puts a damper on all civility and happiness. Everyone was equal, together wherever they could find place to either sit or stand and the ovation brought tears to the eyes. The show was on a proscenium stage but there were no barriers. It was culture at its best.

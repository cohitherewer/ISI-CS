The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 When big brothers fail to take on their responsibilities, sisters have to step in. That is what seems to be happening in Maharashtra, where daughters of politicians, dead and alive, suddenly appear to have grown up. After Supriya Sule, it is probably time for Poonam Mahajan to take over the mantle. And if recent events are any indication, she seems well-equipped to handle the job. As the grapevine has it, if the right alliance has managed to survive in the state, it is entirely to Poonams credit. When the Shiv Sena and the BJP fell out over arrangements concerning the byelection and all hell broke lose, the lady calmly picked up the phone, as her dad would have done, and within a few hours the crisis had blown over. Poonam apparently first spoke to Uddhav Thackeray, gently reminding him that things would not have come to such a pass had her father been alive. Having pulled the right sentimental strings, she called up her dear Gopiya uncle, Gopinath Munde that is. Mahajans memory must have come in a deluge because soon both parties were at the negotiating table. Poonam, however, is modest about her success, and would still rather have brother Rahul do the hard work.

 Meanwhile, despite all the hard work, Feroze Varun Gandhi has been denied a BJP ticket from the Vidisha parliamentary constituency, the best wishes of K Sudarshan, LK Advani and even AB Vajpayee notwithstanding. The middle rung of leadership is reported to be behind this coup de disgrace. But mother and son are keeping a brave face, and are said to have sent feelers to the party that other options will be considered unless there are efforts to mollify Varun. Rumours are afloat that there have been overtures from the Congress. But senior leaders have slammed these down for proprietorial rights would never be shared with the wrong Gandhi. Is it time for Varun to go back to poetry then?

 There might soon be demands for a counselling cell for the capitals simian population if the government goes ahead with the apex court order to shift some 300 monkeys captured from the city to the forests of Madhya Pradesh. Monkey-lovers say the creatures, used to the good life in the city, may have maladjustment problems in the wild. Yet there is no doubt that something needs to be done about the monkeys who stalk the capital, particularly the South and the North Blocs, where some have even ventured to rip up secret defence documents. 

 The IIC has seen giant stirrings of late. Karan Singh, a lifetime trustee, is reported to have made a strong pitch for the acceptance of Lalu Prasad as member. But he was overruled by an overwhelming majority of the screening committee, which decided that the criminal allegations in different courts of Bihar against the railway minister could not be ignored. For Singh, Prasad is important since in any contest for the vice-presidents post, the RJD votes would be of immense value. The IIC selectors are, however, under no such compulsions. 

 Bureaucrats, who consider themselves demigods, do not take kindly to criticism. Which is why the petroleum sector regulatory authority is still to be formed, almost a year after parliament passed the enabling act. Only a couple of weeks ago, a selection panel was constituted to shortlist the names of the chairman and members of the regulatory authority, but before it could hold its first meeting, bureaucrats in the petroleum ministry had put it off on some flimsy excuse. Given the tendency of the petroleum minister, Murli Deora, not to push things too hard, babus seem to have a free run of his ministry.

 Everything other than sportsmanship was on display at the Doha Asian Games torch relay function in New Delhi recently. Three of the capitals VVIPs were there the Lieutenant Governor BL Joshi, CM Sheila Dikshit and the chairperson of the Indian Olympic Association, Suresh Kalmadi along with the international athletic delegation. But the audience were more familiar with the last two, and what followed ruined the gubernatorial mood further. The compere announced the felicitation for the CM instead of the Lt Governors first. Dikshit quickly corrected her, but the damage was done. Joshi is supposed to have voiced his displeasure to Kalmadi. But the befuddled chairman is yet to figure out how to soothe ruffled feathers.

 The Congresswallahs are a more practical set of people than the saffronites. So the principles of power, and not vaastu, rule arrangements in the party headquarters. Powerful gen-secs like Janardhan Dwivedi, Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot and Margaret Alva have their rooms inside the main building. Behind them, along the courtyard, are the offices of the moderate-profile men like BK Hariprasad and Mukul Wasnik. Explaining the science behind it all, a party worker said, Its like Connaught Place. We have the outer circle and an inner circle. 24, Akbar Road also has its own time zone. Wasnik reaches office around seven in the evening; Oscar Fernandes drives in at nine after work; Ahmad Patel, who prefers to work from home, makes his call at two in the morning. The hours are supposed to be a reflection of the schedule in 10, Janpath. Unlike Mrs Gandhi, the present incumbent seems to like working late.

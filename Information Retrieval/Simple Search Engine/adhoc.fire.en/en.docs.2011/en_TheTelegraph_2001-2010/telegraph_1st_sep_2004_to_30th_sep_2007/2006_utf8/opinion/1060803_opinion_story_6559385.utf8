 MAKE IT WORK

 Most laws seem to exist for a perfect world. And those that seek to protect children in India especially so. Hence, the Centres decision to extend the scope of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act to make domestic work a hazardous occupation for children under 14 is unimpeachable. It will soon become a punishable offence to employ children under 14 to work not only in homes but also in dhabas, teashops, restaurants, hotels and resorts. Such a law, if properly implemented, ought to go a long way in preventing the physical, psychological and sexual abuse of some of the countrys most vulnerable children. But the realities of child labour in India are dauntingly varied and complex. They call for a highly nuanced understanding of the particular circumstances in which children live and work, and of the alternatives available to them in these circumstances.

 If UNICEF is right in estimating that one out of every five children working outside the family in India is a domestic worker, then suddenly outlawing them all, even if it were possible to do so, would send them back to families or situations, which, in most cases, are far from being the havens of nurture and protection they are ideally assumed to be. Extreme poverty brings basic deprivations in education, nutrition, healthcare in comparison to which the conditions in which some child labourers, including domestic workers, live and work might be the less damaging and exploitative option. This is a brutal fact that will have to be confronted when assessing what is good or bad for a child. Sending a child back to a family that is too poor to feed its children, or too eager to use them as a source of income might end up ignoring the childs best interests for the sake of an ideally imagined solution. Yet, in such cases, if the child is allowed to carry on working, it becomes imperative to be able to monitor the nature and quality of care being provided by the employer. Also, for the rehabilitation of such children to be effective, there have to be more and better maintained institutions of care other than the family, and a way must be found to link this care with free and universal elementary education. The effectiveness of this expanded law will depend not only on enhanced vigilance, but also on the extent to which the State is successful in sending all children to school and making sure that they remain in school no matter how poor their families are.

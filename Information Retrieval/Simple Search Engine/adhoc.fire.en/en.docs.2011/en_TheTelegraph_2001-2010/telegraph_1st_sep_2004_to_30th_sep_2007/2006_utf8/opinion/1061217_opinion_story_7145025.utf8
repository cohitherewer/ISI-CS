 Letters to Editor

 Mark of a bad boy

 Sir It is indeed shameful for a national level cricketer to lose his temper and get involved in a brawl in a public place (Yuvi amp; Yuvi in birthday bash, Dec 14). Yuvraj Singh is not playing the tests against South Africa because of an injury all the more reason to maintain a low profile now. Discipline is a must for players of all games. They are required to be decorous even when they are not playing. Yuvraj Singh has a fair chance of being Indias future captain. But if he behaves so irresponsibly, the selectors may have to think twice. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Bitter pill

 Sir In addition to cancer and AIDS, vancomycin resistant staphylococcus aureus is going to be a challenge to mankind in the years to come (Deadly bug defying antibiotics pops up, Dec 11). Also, the VRSA strain, in combination with the AIDS virus, can wreak havoc in patients lives. Although it is too early to determine the actual origin of this strain, there is no denying the fact that random use and abuse of antibiotics is one of the reasons for the breeding of such bacteria. The countrys health problems, over almost six decades of Independence, have sadly remained at the lowest rung of the priority ladder. The suggestion by the Varanasi doctors for a nationwide surveillance programme is going to be one more proverbial straw off the camels back. In reality, most pharmaceutical companies, medical professionals, and greedy businessmen are bracing up for yet another opportunity to draw blood.

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir With deadly bacteria steadily decreasing the mortality rates of the people of India, it is time for serious thinking. Scientists have revealed that VRSA defies even the most potent antibiotic, vancomycin. This is alarming for a nation attacked from time to time by diseases like dengue, malaria and polio, not to mention terminal diseases. Still, one feels relieved that researchers have taken up the issue. Hopefully, our doctors will be able to prevent another epidemic. 

 Yours faithfully,

 T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Have the authorities been able to prevent the many deaths caused by the use of defective blood test kits in West Bengal? The new bacteria is unlikely to be detected by the corrupt medical networks in the country. Researchers have indicated that an indiscriminate use of antibiotics on people who do not really need them has triggered off this resistance to drugs. Here, one cannot ignore the role played by doctors who often tend to prescribe strong medicines to patients. At a time we are desperately looking for ways to combat existing diseases, man-made maladies can surely be avoided.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir As is widely known among agriculture economists, the basic reason behind unregulated use of pesticides, groundwater and fertilizers is our inability to treat agriculture as a commercial activity (UK sees health risk in Indian fruit, Dec 9). Free or high subsidy on agricultural inputs like power, fertilizers, diesel and seeds often lead to their irresponsible overuse. The government is yet to come up with a national potable water policy to provide safe drinking water for the people. Arsenic contamination is already playing havoc with the lives of people in the Gangetic plain. However, public awareness about this silent killer is very low. Non-governmental organizations only manage to raise a ruckus over pesticide residues in soft drinks. Perhaps, in their perception too, the lives of poor people are less important than those of the rich.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

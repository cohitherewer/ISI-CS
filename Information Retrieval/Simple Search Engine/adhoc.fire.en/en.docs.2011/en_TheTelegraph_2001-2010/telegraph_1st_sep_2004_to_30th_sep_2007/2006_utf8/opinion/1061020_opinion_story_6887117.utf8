 Stories of our restless times

Forms of Collective Violence (Three Essays, Rs 250) by Paul R. Brass is about Riots, Pogroms, and Genocide in Modern India, but does not include Gujarat within the discussion. This is strange, since the book came out in 2006, four years after the pogrom in Indias western state. Brass steers clear of too much theorization when handling events in contemporary Indian history. This is immensely conducive to reading and understanding his works. The most insightful essay in the book is on the Meerut riots, of 1961 and 1982. Brass offers that there exists now in India an institutionalized system of riot documentation...that comes into play after each riot, that embraces a range of civil liberties organizations, secular intellectuals, retired supreme court judges, English-language press journalists, and others, who go to the sites of these riots, pogroms and massacres, record..., and create a body of truths to counter the mendacities of the perpetrators and the blame-displacing claims of their apologists.

Stairway to Nowhere and Other Stories 

(Rupa, Price not mentioned) Edited by Ruskin Bond collects sixteen 

award-winning stories from the Classmate Young Authors contest. Four stories bear 

the title Stairway to Nowhere, three are called Chain Reaction, and two others 

Dream Factory. This is too much of a coincidence. Could it be that the students 

were given a set of working titles to choose from? The stories reveal a great 

deal about the issues which preoccupy young adults today. Terrorism is certainly 

one of them, and two of the authors, Afarah Saleem and Shreya Maheshwari, use 

it as the theme of their stories. There are a few science fiction stories, but 

none, except Siraj Moopens Chain Reaction deserves serious mention. Perhaps 

the most stunning revelation from the book is that the world of imagination of 

Indian youngsters is a very globalized one: more than half the stories have characters 

such as Mark, Sophie, Jack and Alice, who are located in settings which are not 

exactly Indian. The world is indeed a shrinking sphere.

 Water Birds (Rupa, Rs 195) by Ranjit Lal is a beautiful book on the birds which make their homes in our neighbourhood ponds as well as near the salty seas. From terns to wildfowls to herons to ducks, every identifiable water-bird has been introduced with delightful notes, both informative and humorous, and illustrations. One wishes the illustrator were mentioned.

The Penguin Companion to The Ramayana (Rs 250), written by Bishnupada Charaborty and translated here by Debjani Banerjee, first cuts the long story short following the sequence of the original. But this comes with a touch of humour. For instance, about Shatrughnas knowledge of the birth of Lav and Kush, the narrator cannot help commenting: Shatrughnas self-control is admirable. How could he suppress the significant news for so long? One must take ones hat off to such reticence. Then there is an interesting section called Known and Little-known Facts of the Ramayana, which lists who lived for how long, the route of the Pushpak, besides some questions and answers on ancient aircraft. The final section is a ready-reference to the characters of the epic, which is useful and thorough.

 No Cook Cookbook (Rupa, Rs 195) by Satarupa Banerjee proves that there is more to cooking than stirring in a pot over the fire. And so you have Papri Chaat, chilled avocado soup, pinwheel sandwich and so on. Who would have thought that one could make Long Island cheesecake and even vanilla ice cream without cooking?

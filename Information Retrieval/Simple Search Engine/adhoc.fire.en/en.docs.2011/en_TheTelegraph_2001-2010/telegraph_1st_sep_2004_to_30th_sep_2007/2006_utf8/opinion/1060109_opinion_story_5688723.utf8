 PLAYING FOR PRIDE

 Raju Mukherji

 When Rahul Dravid and Sharad Pawar say that the parliament has other important issues to discuss than cricket, any intelligent man would be stumped for words. Yes, cricket is certainly not among the national priorities. But then why should cricket not be raised in the parliament? For that matter, what?s so sacrosanct about the parliament? If the primary job of the members of parliament is to debate national issues, why should cricket or any other sport not figure in the debates?

 If parliamentarians can play at cricket among themselves, then why should they feel shy to talk about the game inside the hallowed walls of the house? If politicians can send congratulatory messages to cricket captains, why can?t cricket enter their political agendas? If politicians can use strong-arm tactics to acquire posts in cricket associations, why should they act coy when cricket enters the Lok Sabha?

 The issue under contention was the gross injustice meted out to an internationally acclaimed sportsperson of India. The whole nation, especially the common man on the street, spontaneously went up in arms. Cricket fans around the country had very good reasons to feel that they were being short-changed by a scheming group of individuals. Hence, they raised a storm through the media and were also out on the streets in the best tradition of democratic rights.

 Unsporting house

 For a cricketer to feel that cricket does not deserve to be discussed in the parliament amounts to not only depreciating the game but also to insulting the millions who love the game. Most sportsmen have so little pride in their profession that by such ridiculous comments, they devalue the status of their own sports discipline. 

 In India, where we have a full-time sports minister and a sports ministry with budget resources, there is every reason that sports should be discussed in parliament. Since sport does not get the importance it deserves, there is such a lack of transparency in everything to do with sports. Sports lovers do not know how sponsorships in millions are raised, how those millions are wasted and how little is productively utilized. 

 And there is no accountability whatsoever. Sports federations are run on totally corrupt lines; millions are pocketed by a few unscrupulous administrators and a whole lot of middlemen have cropped up to do the dirty jobs and to share the spoils. If a serious and honest appraisal is made of the various sports administrators in the country, it is doubtful how many would actually pass the most basic of tests.

 No prejudice, please

 It is for all these reasons that our parliament needs to address itself more and more on the sporting activities in the country. It is important that corruption and injustice in sports are debated by parliamentarians. The nation needs honest MPs to come forward to save sports from the hands of charlatans and commission agents.

 Anything of national level importance has to be debated in parliament. Sponsors have realized the power of sports among the people. They are willing to pour in funds. The media too have understood the interest that sports generates and are keen to devote additional space to it. For a healthy focus towards sports, we need accountability at all levels.

 For far too long, we have regarded sports as an activity of the dim-witted. So much so that even educated sportspersons like Rahul Dravid and matured politicians like Sharad Pawar still feel that sport does not deserve mention in the houses of parliament. This is indeed unfortunate. The sooner we remove the prejudice against sports,the better it is for the country. But then our sportsmen themselves must first learn to have pride in their profession. And our politicians must learn to respect sports and sportsmen.

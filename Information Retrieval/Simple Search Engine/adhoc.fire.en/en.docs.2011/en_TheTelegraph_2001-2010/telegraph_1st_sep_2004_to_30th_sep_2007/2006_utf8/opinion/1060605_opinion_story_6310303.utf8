 REMAIN WARY

 The gross domestic product growth numbers have been very encouraging with the economy growing by 9.3 per cent during January to March 2006 ? just a percentage point below China?s 10.3 per cent. Growth has been broad-based with manufacturing growing by 8.9 per cent while agricultural growth was a much-better-than-expected 5.5 per cent. The construction industry ? together with hotels, trade, transport and communications ? logged a growth of over 12 per cent. Moreover, there has been an acceleration, with growth in the fourth quarter of 2005-06 being the highest in any quarter during the year. Nor is the improvement because of agriculture alone ? manufacturing has got over the deceleration in growth rate seen during the second and third quarters, while the momentum in the services sector too has improved. The laggards have been the mining sector, which grew at a mere 3 per cent during January to March, and, to some extent, the power sector. These are vital infrastructure sectors and their relatively tepid performance underlines the importance of carrying forward the reforms process in these areas.

 Do the GDP estimates show that the bloodbath in the markets is completely unconnected to the underlying performance of the economy? The numbers undoubtedly prove that the fundamentals of the economy are sound. The sell-off in the market has more to do with worries about liquidity in global markets and the overvaluation of Indian stocks than with any concerns about the Indian economy. That said, if foreign fund flows continue to be negative, then that could have adverse repercussions not only for the market but for the real economy as well. In fact, short-term capital inflows have become rather critical to the Indian economy over the last few years. These inflows have led to lots of liquidity; they have resulted in low interest rates and their beneficial effect on the stock market has also led to a wealth effect and improved business sentiment. The upshot has been a debt-fuelled consumption boom on the one hand and rising corporate profitability on the other. 

 True, there are other underlying factors, such as outsourcing or capital expenditure, that also provide a solid basis to the current economic boom. At the same time, unlike our east Asian neighbours, we run a current account deficit and our economy is based more on domestic consumption than on exports. Our economy is comparatively more vulnerable to a reversal in liquidity flows. In the circumstances, while the GDP numbers look very rosy at the moment, the government would do well to keep a wary eye on the markets.

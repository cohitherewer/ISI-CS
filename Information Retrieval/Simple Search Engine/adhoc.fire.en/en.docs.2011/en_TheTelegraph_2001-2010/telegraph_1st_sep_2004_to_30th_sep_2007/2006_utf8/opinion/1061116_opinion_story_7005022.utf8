 ABSURD QUOTA

 Contradictions are of no consequence to Indian politicians. It has not yet struck them that the term, Dalit Muslim, is an absurd phrase. According to the tenets of Islam, there cannot be a caste system in any Muslim society. In India, many who converted to Islam did so to avoid the oppressions of the caste system that dominated Hindu society. By embracing Islam, these people gave up their caste identity. It is one of the distinguishing features of Islam in India that it has no caste system and does not believe in one. Thus, the claim being made by some politicians that there should be reservations for Dalit Muslims is a ridiculous one since such people do not exist. There are people who were Dalits before they or their forefathers became Muslims. They are no longer Dalits for the simple reason that their faith Islam does not recognize the caste system. The very poor Muslims suffer from the same exploitation that poor Hindus suffer from. This is not because they were Dalits once upon a time, but because they are poor. In the clamour of reservations for all and sundry, it is being forgotten that by labelling some people as Dalit Muslims, a fundamental tenet of Islam is being transgressed.

 The argument being offered by the advocates of reservation for Dalit Muslims is that since Dalit Sikhs and neo-Buddhist converts have got reservations and other privileges enjoyed by members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, Dalit Muslims should also enjoy the same. The assumption seems to be that if the state has once made a mistake, it should be perpetuated. Like Islam, neither Sikhism nor Buddhism recognizes the caste system. Indeed, these religions were conceived and developed as protests against the caste system. Three wrongs will not make a right. The many spurious claims being made for reservations only make the oft-repeated point that reservations have nothing to do with right or wrong, but with politics and vote-banks. The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution had introduced time-bound reservations for scheduled tribes and castes. This schedule was not drawn up on the basis of religion. Politicians, since the late Eighties, have completely distorted the original assumptions that determined reservations. Steps should be taken to remove poverty and to help those who are the victims of poverty. Religion cannot be the basis of deciding who needs welfare.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Paperback Pickings

 Reality is outside the textbooks

UNTOUCHABILITY IN RURAL INDIA (Sage, Rs 295) by Ghanashyam Shah, Harsh Mander, Sukhadeo Thorat, Satish Deshpande and Amita Baviskar is an important text for the times, particularly in the light of the recent violence involving Dalits. The introduction sets out the primary concerns in straight, precise terms. The observations are acute: the caste-class correlation has remained remarkably stable, while those between caste and economic status, and caste and occupation have become less rigid or weaker. The three main dimensions of untouchability exclusion, humiliation-subordination and exploitation are covered adequately, often through statistics, although the most recent figures date back to 1999-2000. Updating the statistics might make room for new insights and observations. Extracts from works of fiction and poetry are a bonus for the reader. A couplet by Chandrashekhar Gokhale goes: Outside every village is a small Dalit hamlet/ Yet the fourth standard textbook includes a lesson on equality.

 THE TOP OF THE RAINTREE (IndiaInk, Rs 295) by Kamalini Sengupta has been praised (on the cover itself) by Nadine Gordimer for its penetration of a new stage in our human history. Naturally, one enters the novel with rather high expectations. Much of them are unmet. The novel is set in Calcutta, spanning a huge period between the Raj and the Eighties. But the feel is somewhat alien, the characters being at odds with the milieu in which they are placed. Sengupta is evidently not in favour of italicizing vernacular words and phrases, but one wishes her prose were able to carry off the brave style.

FROM THE SEAS TO THE STARS (Frog, Rs 250) by Michael Merson is the story of a freelance photographer who returns to Cyprus where he had last been as a little boy. Little does he know that the trauma of being trapped under a reef would revisit him from his boyhood days, only this time involving his son. The novel is vivid and emotionally gripping.

 COUNSELLING: WHAT,WHEN,HOW (Viva, Rs 100) by MEERA RAVI lists empathy, sincerity, integrity, resilience, respect, humility, competence and courage as the qualities a counsellor must aspire to. Ravi also provides sets of questions for readers to evaluate whether they need counselling. The little bit of feel-good at the end is excusable.

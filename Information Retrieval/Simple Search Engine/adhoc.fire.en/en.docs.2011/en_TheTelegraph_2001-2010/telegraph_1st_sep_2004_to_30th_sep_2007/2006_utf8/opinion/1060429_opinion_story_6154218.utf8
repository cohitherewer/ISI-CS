 Letters to Editor

 Some real help

 Sir ? Kavita Gadgil has succeeded where Aamir Khan failed (?Mother?s birthday gift to MiG martyr?, April 27). Setting up a flying institute in real life (as Gadgil has done) is a better idea than killing corrupt politicians in reel life ? something that Khan does in his last film. A political assassination will create unrest and add to social tensions, but a training institute for pilots may actually help curb air accidents. Yet while Khan hogged the limelight for Rang de Basanti, Gadgil?s contribution went largely unnoticed.

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur

 Food for thought

 Sir ? At a time when the state exchequer is practically empty, the administration really cannot afford to pamper government officials with five star comfort. People like Singh, who have come to serve as a poll observer in the state, should have been put up in state-run guest houses or MLA hostels that offer boarding and lodging facilities at reasonable rates. I remember my father, who served as an ICS officer before independence, making sure that he did not exceed the limits that were set on his lodging and travel expenses. It appears that the current crop of bureaucrats do not bother about such niceties. All they are interested in is leading expensive lives at the cost of the hapless taxpayer. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The diet chart of Ajay Pal Singh, who served as a poll observer in the recent elections in Bengal, was shocking. This is especially so since Singh?s exorbitant food bills are being borne by the taxpayer. It is interesting to note that officials like Singh who are supposed to serve the citizens of the country follow a lifestyle that the man on the street can only dream of. However, we should not blame Singh for his excesses. He was simply following the examples set by some of our judges and doctors, who even refuse to take up postings in remote areas, fearing the loss of the comforts of life in a city. 

 Singh?s behaviour can be traced back to our feudal past, during which the vulgar display of one?s wealth and power was very much a part of life. Independence, however, has changed our institutions drastically and our ways of thinking. Those in positions of power must realize that they can no longer play god to the masses since everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. Singh?s conduct may force the Election Commission to impose a code of conduct for poll officials as well.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar 

 Sir ? Ajay Pal Singh?s food bills indicate that elections were the farthest from his mind during his stint as a poll observer. All he was bothered about was sampling the dishes that were on offer. Going by his performance, Singh should be kept 200 metres away from polling booths the next time he goes to monitor polls.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Anil Basu, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? As a school student, I am concerned about the fact that none of the parties have promised to address the issue of child labour in their manifestos. Most of our politicians are more concerned about making Calcutta beautiful. They have promised us more malls, better roads and cutting-edge technology in the name of progress. This at a time when a large number of children still reside in slums. They are deprived of education and many of them are exploited sexually. Often, these children grow up and join the underworld, or are recruited by politicians to serve as party cadre. Little wonder then that our leaders are not interested in rooting out the problem of child labour.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Dutta, Calcutta

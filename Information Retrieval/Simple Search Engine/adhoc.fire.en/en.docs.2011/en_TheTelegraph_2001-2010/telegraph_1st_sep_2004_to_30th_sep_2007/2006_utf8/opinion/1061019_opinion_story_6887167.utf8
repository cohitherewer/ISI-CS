 POINTS TO PONDER

 There is something hideously wrong with a society that has to be constantly reminded about childrens welfare, and that too through court strictures. The fear of a judicial reprimand is expected to drive as much sense into business-minded sweatshop-owners as into over-zealous parents and educationists who see no ill will in subjecting children to an abusive system for the sake of assuring them a superlative future. The Delhi high court has come up with its own set of guidelines for nursery admissions while banning interviews of toddlers as routine procedure for admitting them. It has recommended a points-based programme for admission that is expected to promote the concept of neighbourhood schooling while encouraging the education of girls and mainstream-schooling for children with special needs. Although the programmes efficacy in realizing the last two intended goals is debatable, there is no doubt that the formal ban on interviews is a blessing. It will definitely save children from the traumatic experience of facing an interview board even before they have begun to understand their immediate worlds and the rigours of living up to parental expectations. The importance attached to the distance from home to school only shows how keenly the needs of the child have been kept in mind. Apart from lessening the physical strain of commuting, neighbourhood schools will reduce the pressure on the select schools pursued relentlessly by parents.

 However, the court order alone cannot guarantee the well-being of children. Parents and school authorities have to restrain their over-reaching ambitions to make it work. For that to happen, parents have to guarantee that the information provided to schools regarding their address and educational background is genuine. In the absence of a method of verification, much will depend on scruples. Schools, for their part, have to ensure that the leverage they have retained, despite the limitations imposed, are not misused. The administration also has to do its bit by seeing to it that there are enough schools in the locality for parents to choose from. Otherwise, despite the guidelines, there is no way children can be rescued from the torture that goes in the name of learning.

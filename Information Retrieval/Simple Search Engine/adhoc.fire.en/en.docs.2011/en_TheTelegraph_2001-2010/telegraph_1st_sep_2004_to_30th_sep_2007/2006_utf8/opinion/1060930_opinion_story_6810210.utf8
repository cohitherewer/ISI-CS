 PROF THINKS ITS BAD

 It is just as well that great artists seldom live to witness some of the banal critical debates inspired by their works from time to time. After the invention of Eng Lit, writers have had it particularly bad. And Shakespeare, being the greatest of them, has possibly had it the worst especially in his own country. A few important Britons seem to have been struck with the clever idea that Shakespeare sometimes wrote rather badly. The artistic director of the Globe Theatre in London, Mr Dominic Dromgoole, has devoted an entire chapter of his memoir, Will amp; Me, to elaborating this idea with examples from many of the plays. He admits to have been told of this first by none less than Mr Peter Hall, the near-legendary theatre director. And never has Mr Hall been more English than when he attributed Shakespeares bad lines to bad hangovers. Messrs Hall and Dromgooles theory has recently found approval in the British media from Mr John Sutherland. Mr Sutherland is now Emeritus Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College, London, apart from being a columnist and the writer of at least 17 popular books on English fiction. He has also been involved in the Dot Mobile project of translating summaries of, and quotations from, literary classics into text-messaging shorthand.

 There is an important cultural thread connecting the irreverent over-familiarity of Will amp; Me, the idea of a hungover Shakespeare, and classics turned into SMS-speak. This thread is contemporary Britains profound discomfort with greatness. In a country committed to making Art accessible, it is far more important to make the point that Shakespeare was one of us, getting drunk and writing badly, than to celebrate something as elitist as literary greatness. Hence, trashing Shakespeare becomes a form of subversive activity that is both politically correct and critically liberating. There is a deliciously infantile thrill to a Lord Northcliffe Professor suggesting in his column that Crap Shakespeare will probably be a fashionable parlour game over the next few weeks: What, it will be mischievously asked, are your candidates for the worst ever lines in our nations best ever plays? Mr Sutherlands favourite crap lines, like his argument that Macbeth is feebly plotted, illustrate the perils of populist criticism more than Shakespeares badness. Shakespeare delighted in writing badly, and was perfectly aware of doing it when he did it. He enjoyed creating characters who spoke what Messrs Hall, Dromgoole and Sutherland would call turgid verse or prose. Think of Polonius in Hamlet, or Don Armado in Loves Labours Lost. In each case, the bad writing served brilliant social observation or psychological insight. 

 Shakespeares was an unanxiously impure art, with something in it for everybody and plenty of mistakes to boot. And although he worked amidst fierce competition, perhaps the last thing he worried about, or needed to worry about, was greatness.

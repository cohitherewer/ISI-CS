 OL MAN RIVER

 A communist, well into his nineties, wants to resign from the politburo, but his party will not let him. If this situation had not been true, there would be occasion to laugh at it. Mr Jyoti Basu, the former chief minister of West Bengal, has been a loyal communist all his adult life, and he has been a member of the politburo of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) since it was formed. This record alone entitles him to some rest at the twilight of his life. Mr Basu wants to step down from the politburo because of his age. The irony is that it is precisely for the same reason that the party does not want to let him go. Mr Basus comrades feel that given his vast experience and his invaluable contribution to the cause of the party, he deserves to remain on the politburo, enjoying a sort of emeritus status. Mr Basus actions would suggest that he does not believe in that special status. He feels that as an old communist and a member of the partys highest body, he should engage fully in its deliberations. His sense of involvement conveys the impression that he actually does not want to step down. This is a classic catch-22 situation. Mr Basu could break the impasse by not attending politburo meetings in the future. This might convince his comrades that he genuinely wants to step down, and that he is a tired and unwell man.

 The story of Mr Basu and his party is by no means unique in Indian politics. The Bharatiya Janata Party also has ageing leaders who refuse to relinquish the reins of leadership. Thus the Vajpayee-Advani duo continues even though their ages add up to over 150 years. The world of Indian politics has become the domain of old men. One obvious reason for this is that there is no retirement age for politicians. This is related to the peculiar phenomenon of politics becoming a profession without an iota of professionalization. Thus politicians carry on, and take special pride in dying in harness. Challenges to an established leadership within a political party are practically unknown in India. This is perhaps in keeping with the Indian tradition of showing respect to age. Even under these circumstances, the plight of Mr Basu is a bit special. He wants to go but he is not allowed to go. The partys decision which, given communist practice, must prevail may not be a historic blunder, but it is not entirely free from a touch of cruelty.

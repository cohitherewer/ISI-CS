 Letters to Editor

 When the fair are foul

 Sir It may be painful, but it is painfully true. Notwithstanding Indias growth rate and potential to become a global power, Indians are still regularly humiliated by Westerners. First, the BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, was unceremoniously asked to leave the podium by the Australian cricketers. A few weeks later, Angelina Jolies bodyguards roughed up parents in a Mumbai school, calling them bloody Indians. Yes, this reflects badly on the so-called civilized citizens of the West. But arent we Indians at fault too, being too starry-eyed about people with fair skin? 

 Yours faithfully,

 K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Legal violations

 Sir It is unfortunate that most of the victims of rape in India are poor Muslim women (Shamed and shut out, Nov 14). While Islam makes it mandatory to have the consent of women (qubool) for marriage and decrees capital punishment for rapists, it is sad that an imam in todays Bengal has pronounced fatwa on a victim to marry her rapist father-in-law. Not only this, imams have also discharged rapists after extracting a nominal fine. It is necessary that Muslim intellectuals register their protest against those clerics who go against the tenets of Islam.

 Yours faithfully,

 Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Sir Nothing in this world is absolutely good or absolutely evil. The same applies to the news report, Now, rape court in panchayat office (Nov 17). On the negative side, one wonders what is the use of maintaining a police force with the taxpayers money when the cops can do nothing more than advise the aggrieved to settle the issue through a shalishi. But there is a positive angle to the story too. It reveals the symbiotic relationship between the police and the ruling left. So long as the relationship works well, both parties are happy. But mutual distrust and malice come to surface when it fails, as we have seen recently in the western districts of the state. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir Pervez Musharraf, after assuming power in June 2001, has now started working on his reformist dreams. This is probably just another election gimmick. Archaic laws such as the Hudood Ordinance Act put the burden of proof of rape on the accused. The fact that four witnesses are required to prove a rape under the law is indication enough that it thinks nothing of people watching the spectacle of rape. Instead of the offenders being punished, it is the victims who are stoned to death on charges of adultery. 

 Instead of waging a proxy war against India, Musharraf should have waged war against the religious fundamentalists in his own country. But, perhaps, he had all along supported their views. Why else did he look so exasperated with Mukhtaran Mai, who was gang-raped at the command of her village head? 

 There are enough holes in Indian laws too. The only solution seems to be the empowerment of women. Seats were sought to be reserved for women in the Indian parliament as a way of empowering women. But it has not been possible, after a decade of effort, to get it passed by the majority of the members. The United Nations should come forward and scrap all religious laws in all countries, and replace them with a uniform law, to be applied globally, so that equal rights and opportunity may be ensured for women. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Panchayats are hardly the place to judge rape cases, since rapists usually hail from the powerful sections of society. And panchayat members wield the greatest power in our villages.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Dey, Calcutta

 THUS SPOKE IRAN

 Nobody can say that the United States was not generous towards Iran. The two countries have had no diplomatic relations for the last 26 years. Despite this, the US suggested that existing differences on Iran?s nuclear programme could be resolved through dialogue and discussion. But this offer came with a condition. Washington was willing to talk only if Teheran stopped enriching its uranium. Iran spurned this offer saying that it was not willing to surrender its natural right to enrichment and that this right was not negotiable. Iran?s rejection stops a major policy initiative in its tracks. The US offer marked a radical shift in Washington?s attitude to Iran and had enthused Russia, China and the powerful countries of the European Union. The door has now been shut on the possibility of a negotiated settlement. Iran stands in danger of having sanctions imposed upon it since Russia and China had both implicitly consented to sanctions if Iran refused the carrot. The stick might extend well beyond sanctions to US aggression. Neither Russia nor China or for that matter anyone else, except the hawks in the Bush administration, would want military action but Iran?s intransigence might close other options.

 While on the one hand the fear of an Islamic nuclear bomb in Iran?s hands looms large over the Western powers and Russia and China, there is also the dark shadow of the US-led invasion of Iraq. In Iraq, the imaginary weapons of mass destruction led to an invasion whose consequences have been disastrous. There are few takers for a repeat of an Iraq in Iran. This was perhaps the context of the offer the US made to Teheran. It cannot be denied that the attitude of the US and Western powers towards Iran is informed by a profound distrust of Teheran?s complex structure of decision-making in which the ultimate power rests with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This suspicion has now been fortified by Iran?s rejection of a negotiated settlement. The rejection is being read as a sign of Iran?s intentions. Even without accepting Mr Samuel Huntingdon?s thesis about an ongoing clash of civilizations, it cannot be denied that for various reasons, west Asia has emerged as the world?s conflict point. If a conflict is perpetrated, its impact may not be confined to a particular theatre. Iran?s spurning of the US offer will cause sleepless nights in capitals of the world.

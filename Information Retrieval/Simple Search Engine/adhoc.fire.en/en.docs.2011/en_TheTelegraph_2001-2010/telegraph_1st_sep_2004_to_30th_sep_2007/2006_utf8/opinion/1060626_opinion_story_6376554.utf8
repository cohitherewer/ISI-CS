 Blood on water again

 Gwynne Dyer

 ?The moratorium [on whaling], which was clearly intended as a temporary measure, is no longer necessary,? says the St. Kitt?s Declaration, which passed by just one vote at the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission. It doesn?t mean that the world will go back to full-scale commercial whaling this year after a twenty-year moratorium, but the door is certainly now open. As New Zealand?s conservation minister, Chris Carter, admitted afterwards, ?It has been a significant diplomatic victory for Japan.?

 For years, Tokyo has been bribing small, poor countries with generous offers of foreign aid if they will join the IWC and vote to resume whaling. The strategy came within a hair?s breadth of success last year, and with three new pro-Japanese members this year (Guatemala, Cambodia and the Marshall Islands) versus only one new anti-whaling member (Israel), it looked like Japan would have its majority at last.

 Then, a reprieve. Guatemala didn?t show up in St. Kitts and Nevis, the site of this year?s meeting, and several other small countries were late paying their dues and renewing their credentials.Japan and its pro-whaling allies lost two key votes, though the anti-whaling coalition?s margin of victory was only two or three countries. But the dues eventually got paid (by somebody), the arms of a couple of waverers got twisted, and Japan got the resolution it has been seeking for years. The IWC has declared that the moratorium on whaling is not permanent ? indeed, it is no longer necessary.

 For the nation

 It doesn?t mean that commercial whaling will resume tomorrow. It would take the votes of three-quarters of the IWC?s members to end the moratorium, and Japan is nowhere near that number of supporters. Moreover, the anti-whalers are promising to go out and recruit new members to the IWC who will back their position and perhaps restore their majority. But the Japanese have worked at this issue with amazing determination over many years ? and the question is: why? Japan?s policy is really driven not by a national hunger for whale-meat but by perceived racism and historic resentment against the West. The whales just got caught in the middle.

 Since most large whale species were clearly dwindling fast by the Eighties (and some were nearing extinction), the IWC agreed in 1982 on a moratorium on all commercial whaling until the stocks had recovered. It came into effect in 1986, and at the time it just seemed to be a sensible temporary measure to preserve a valuable resource. So Japan and the few other countries that still hunted whales went along with it ? but by the Nineties a large majority of the then-members of the IWC had decided that the moratorium should be turned into a permanent ban on whale-hunting.

 As time passed and whale stocks began to recover, the few pro-whaling countries proposed the resumption of whaling ? and realized that they had been had. They were all unhappy about it, but none of the others was as big or as angry as the Japanese.

 A lot of Japanese nationalism was driven by the fact that Japan was the only non-white great power, and felt despised and patronized by the others. The love of whales had not caught on in popular Japanese culture and being treated as unfeeling brutes by the (mostly white) anti-whaling countries ignited a profound resentment in Japan. So returning IWC to its original purpose of preserving whale stocks for the whalers became a high priority for Japan and it started buying up small-country allies.

 The small countries are mostly in it for the money that Japan provides. But some of them are also resentful that the fat, rich West seems to care more for the poor whales than about poor people. This ugly little struggle will go on for years yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WINTER OF THE PATRIARCH

 Jyoti Basu, those who know him say, is full of wisdom. And that possibly explains why his party has been reluctant to let him hang up his boots

 Sougata Roy will never forget the day. The Trinamool Congress leader had run into Jyoti Basu, then chief minister of West Bengal, at a wedding reception in Calcutta. Basu was chatting with a few guests, including Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, when Roy walked up. 

 Spotting Roy, Basu stopped in mid-sentence and, with a smile on his face, asked the former Congress man to join what seemed like an animated discussion on roads in Salt Lake, the upscale Calcutta locality where both Basu and Dasgupta live. Roy a leader of an opposition party led by Mamata Banerjee, then Basus main detractor in Bengal politics could not believe his ears as the chief minister, in his own Bengali bhadralok way, openly railed against the state of the roads. 

 In a way, that is quintessential Jyoti Basu: an open, amiable personality behind a steely, grave exterior. In private, he is a completely different person, warm and affectionate, Roy says. More than anything else, those who know him say that Basu is full of wisdom. And that possibly explains why his party has been reluctant to let him hang up his boots. 

 At 60, N.R. Narayana Murthy can retire as chairman of Infosys. Yet, at 93, Jyoti Basu must stay on. Or so the CPM says. The party leadership, in the just-concluded Politburo meeting in Calcutta, turned down Basus renewed request to be allowed to step down from the partys highest decision-making body owing to ill health. His advice and guidance are too invaluable for the party to let him go, a CPM leader says. 

 Basus legacy, of course, has been a mixed one. Many, some even outside the party, see him as one of the architects of land reform and agricultural growth in the state. But his report card at the end of the tenure had its share of Es and Fs in areas such as employment and industry, though it was he who had started the process of ushering in investment in the state. For the party, though, he is still the last monarch. He is the leader of leaders, says Bengal transport minister Subhas Chakroborty, an ardent disciple of the countrys longest-running chief minister who stepped down on November 6, 2000. Who cannot benefit from his words? 

 Still, having missed the bus to become the countrys first Marxist prime minister in 1996 by a whisker following his partys decision not to join a Third Front government at the Centre, something Basu had mournfully called a historic blunder, the grand old man of Indian politics has few peaks left to climb in the twilight of his life. 

 Suffering from an irritable bowel syndrome, Basu, who also complains of insomnia, injured his hip in a fall in late August at Indira Bhavan, his home for over one-and-a-half decades in Salt Lake. Yet Basu soldiers on not so much for himself but for the Communist party (then undivided) he had flung himself into as a wholetimer on his return from Britain as a barrister in 1940. It was an unusual decision for the son of a physician in whose family politics had never been a hot subject even though it had sympathy for the countrys freedom struggle, as Basu recalls in a 1999 political autobiography. But then, Basu, in some ways, always knew what he wanted to do. 

 Wearing homespun clothes, he and a cousin, determined to hear Subhas Chandra Bose speak at the foot of what is now Calcuttas Shahid Minar, braved police canes in 1930. They refused to run from the scene, for that would have indicated we were scared, said Basu. As a young boy, he protested when priests in his Calcutta school, St Xaviers, distributed leaflets condemning the Chittagong armoury raid of 1930. Several years later, he said to Jawaharlal Nehru, on being introduced in London, we believe in socialism, only to be told that their first task was to earn freedom for India an argument Basu said he instantly agreed with. 

 In his life, Basu has always done and said what he believes in. Yet his friends hold that he is not dogmatic. He is practical and is keenly aware of the ground reality. He knows more than anyone else what to say or what to do in a given situation, a CPM leader says. 

 And if Subhas Chakroborty is to be believed, Basus stature as a politician once saved his life. On June 26, 1972 Bengal was then under Congress rule Chakroborty was at the Howrah station when a mob of armed youths from a rival organisation tried to drag him out of a crowded coach, threatening to kill him. 

 Chakroborty was sitting next to a Kharagpur-bound army officer who had fidgeted but done nothing when he was being manhandled. But then some of the youths started abusing Jyoti Basu in the choicest words. Suddenly, the army man got up, seized one of the men by the collar, lifted him and tossed him out of the coach. Encouraged, the other passengers got up and chased the gang. They fled, the transport minister says. Later, the army officer told Chakroborty he could not take it when the youths started abusing the politician he held in high esteem.

 Such are the stuff legends are possibly made of. But Sougata Roy feels that in trying to cling to Basu, the CPM has revealed an inherent flaw in its seemingly iron-clad party structure. They cannot do without a 93-year-old leader even though they say that the party is above any individual, the Trinamool leader says. Jyoti Basu, however, could do with a well-deserved rest.

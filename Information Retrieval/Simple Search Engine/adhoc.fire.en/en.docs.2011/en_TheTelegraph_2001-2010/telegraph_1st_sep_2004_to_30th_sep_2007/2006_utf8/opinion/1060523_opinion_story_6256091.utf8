The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TWO MANY

 It may well be a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. Two new players appear from nowhere to cast a shadow over the Naga peace talks. The National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, has caused a flutter in New Delhi by taking up the Naga issue with China and the London-based Parliamentarians for National Self-Determination. It is not difficult to see why India is upset over this unexpected move by the NSCN. The PNSD is known to have used its platform for brazen anti-India campaigns. It was no different this time when it likened the situation in Nagaland with those in Kashmir and ?Khalistan?. The forum?s credentials cannot have been unknown to the NSCN. Mr Muivah?s defence of his outfit?s action does not appear to be above board. It is one thing to send his representatives ?anywhere in the world? and quite another to send them to fora that are known to be India-baiters. The timing of the NSCN delegations? visits to China and London was also not particularly well- advised. The visits took place on the eve of the peace meeting in Amsterdam and thereby clouded the talks between the NSCN and the Indian side. This was unnecessary and could have been avoided. 

 However, Mr Muivah?s complaint that New Delhi is trying to ?undermine? his organization by helping other outfits is a serious one. The Centre should do nothing to even leave such an impression on any of the Naga groups. The NSCN, led by Mr Swu and Mr Muivah, remains the most powerful and influential of these outfits. The fate of not only the ceasefire but also the peace process depends on New Delhi?s engagement with it. It would be a serious mistake on the government?s part to promote any other group at the NSCN?s cost. At the same time, Mr Muivah?s threat of picking up arms again is disappointing. The peace process that has survived many odds over the past eight years is no mere official business. It has touched and changed lives in Nagaland. Peace has become a reality in the state after decades of violence and despair. Mr Muivah and his comrades have done much to create this new climate of hope. A call to return to the jungles and to the guns would be seen by the people of Nagaland as a surrender to despair. Whatever the odds, the collapse of the talks is not an option for either side.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 History?s warp and weft 

 IN THE KASHMIRI SHAWL: FROM JAMAVAR TO PAISLEY (Mapin, Rs 3,000), Sherry Rehman and Naheed Jafri combine visual sumptuousness and meticulous historical research to document a complex tradition that is over 500 years old. This tradition is inextricable from the history of the valley it was nurtured in, and many layers of narrative and symbolism are preserved in the shawls? warp and weft. On the left is a classic example of an early Sikh period palladar (first quarter of the 19th century), next to which is a mid-19th-century amli rumal on twill pashmina, the outcome of perhaps a couple of years of constant labour. Above this, Ingres? Madame Leblanc sits on her First Empire ?long shawl? (made fashionable by the Empress Josephine), and next to her is an albumen print of Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy wearing a kani Dogra-style shawl.

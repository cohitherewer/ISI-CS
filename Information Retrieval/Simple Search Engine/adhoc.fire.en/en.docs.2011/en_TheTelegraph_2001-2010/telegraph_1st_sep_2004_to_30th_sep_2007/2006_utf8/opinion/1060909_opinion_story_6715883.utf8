 ON AN EGO TRIP

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Nobel Prize winners: almost there

 All of us have problems coping with our egos. Those who rely on others for praise have them vastly exaggerated. The three professions which top my list of egoists are film stars, politicians and writers, including poets, novelists and journalists. If people dont praise them on their faces, they do so themselves. Of self-praisers, Sheikh Saadi wrote a nasty put-downer in Persian:

 Sana-e-khud bakhud guftan

 Na zebad mard-e-daana ra

 Choon zan pistaan-e-khud maalad

 Kuja lazzat shavad baqee

 (It does not behove a man of wisdom

 To use his tongue in praise of 

 himself;

 A woman who uses her own hands 

 to rub her breasts

 What pleasure does the exercise 

 beget?)

 Film stars are as vain as peacocks and expect everyone to recognize and admire them. Politicians expect people to praise them for what they are doing for the poor and their country. Writers go one rung higher; poets have a hotline with god and believe whatever they pen in verse is divinely inspired; novelists believe they are messiahs conveying messages of the Almighty; journalists think they are caretakers of society (one boasted of doing the second most important job in India after the prime minister). 

 It is ironic that while paanbidi-cigarette sellers make a better living than writers because there are more takers for these products than for books, writers have bigger egos. However, writers egos are easier to massage. All one has to do is ask one to autograph his book for you, or, if he happens to visit you, have one of his books lying on the table for him to see. And you will have an admirer for life. You dont have to read it, just have it lying around.

 Indian writers have bigger egos than writers of any other country. One has a letterhead printed with his name and his lifes ambition to be the first winner of the Nobel Prize for Urdu literature. He lives in a remote village in Himachal. Another living in Uttarkhand describes himself as a thinker, philosopher and poet. The Nobel Prize committee in Norway receives more applications for the award from India than from any other country of the world. In recent years, three Indians claimed to have won the prize and many more had it announced to the media that they were shortlisted for the award. None of them got anywhere near winning it but that did not deter them from saying maybe next year. Ego springs eternal in writers breasts.

 Before verse comes to worst

 Having tried my hand at translating poetry and prose from Punjabi, Urdu and Hindi into English, I have my own yardstick to measure their merit. First and most important is that while knowledge of the language of the original is essential, it is more important to have full command over English. Very often scholars of regional languages translate their own works, and make a mess of them, or they get someone who has been teaching English literature in a college to do it. This also turns out to be second rate. Teachers of English in our colleges may be familiar with the classics but are rarely aware of the subtle nuances of the language as it is spoken today. That is why translations of Indian languages by British or American scholars read better than those done by Indians.

 Secondly, verse should be translated into verse; otherwise translations will read flat and prosaic.

 Thirdly, before translating religious texts, the translator must familiarize himself with the language of the Bible the Old and New Testament. Both have been translated and polished many times over. They deal with almost the same themes as the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagwad Gita, the Quran, compositions of bhaktas and Sufi Saints and the Gurbani. Biblical language is the best.

 And finally, a translator should consult earlier translations of the text he is about to work on and only make the attempt if he feels he can do a better job in accuracy and readability. I make no claim of having done so in my translations, but I did the best I could.

 Having said all this, I come to Jaswant Singh Nekis five daily prayers, Divine Intimations Nitnem. Neki is an acknowledged scholar of Sikhism with a good command of the English language. He is accurate but despite translating verse into verse, he is not always as poetic as he could have been. He is at his best translating Guru Gobind Singhs writings, which few people have done before. I produce one example which Hindi-knowing people will understand despite Punjabified Sanskrit words like rakhsha (protection) into rachha.

 Hamree karo haath dai rachha// Pooran hoi chit kee ichha

 With your hand protect me sire// And fulfil my hearts desire

 Tav charnan man rahey hamaara// Apna jaan karo pratipaara

 By your feet Lord, let me dwell// Make me yours, protect me well.

 Nekis book is as good an introduction to Sikh religion as you will find in any library.

 A polite exchange

 Natwar and Jaswant met at a party

 And locked each other in a tight 

 embrace;

 They kissed each other on forehead 

 and face

 Kindred souls are we, they said, 

 I hawk my book, said one

 I fight to get back to regain my 

 eminent place, replied the other.

 Have a double Patiala, said Natwar, 

 I married one of them, you know.

 Yes, replied Jaswant, You will 

 also need a lot of luck as things go.

 As they drank and smiled and smiled

 Avoiding all other company 

 meanwhile

 They exchanged a few notes silently

 And after a warm handshake

 As the party was about to break

 They left quietly.

 It was a unique meeting

 A successful one on the whole

 In which not even once they 

 mentioned

 Either the Iraqi oil deal or the Indian 

 Mole.

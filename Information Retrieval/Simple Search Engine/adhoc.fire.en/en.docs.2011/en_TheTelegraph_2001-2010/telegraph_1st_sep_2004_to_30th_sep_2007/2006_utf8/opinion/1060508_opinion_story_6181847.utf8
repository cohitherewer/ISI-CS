 WAITING FOR THE BIG FIGHT

 Gwynne Dyer

 They are not necessary, but this resolution burns the bridges. If George W. Bush follows the same path that he took into Iraq, a ?failure to act? by the security council is the necessary preliminary to an attack on Iran. Such an attack would make no military sense, but American foreign policy is still in the hands of neo-conservatives whose mantra used to be that ?the boys go to Baghdad, the men go to Tehran.?

 Even if Iran does intend to build nuclear weapons eventually, there is no urgency. As Robert Joseph, US undersecretary of state for arms control, said in March, the US intelligence community believes that Iran is ?five to ten years away from a nuclear weapons capability.? Attacking Iran is also a military nightmare for American strategic planners: former White House counter-terrorism chief, Richard Clarke, pointed out that the Clinton administration had also contemplated a bombing campaign but ?after a long debate, the highest levels of the military could not forecast a way in which things would end favourably for the United States.?

 Not outside the law

 Even massive US air strikes that killed thousands of Iranian nuclear specialists would only set Iran?s programme back by a couple of years, and a land invasion is out of question: the US army is already stretched too thin by Iraq. Iran might be able to close the Gulf to oil traffic ? its sea-skimming and underwater anti-ship missiles are good enough to give the US navy a run for its money. It could tip the world?s oil markets into turmoil just by withholding its own oil exports. And it could set southern Iraq on fire by mobilizing its Shia allies there.

 Iran will not back down, and neither will the US. The clash is probably still many months away, but these two countries are on a collision course. So it might be a good time to reconsider the question of what capabilities Iran is really seeking with its nuclear programmes.

 Iran?s nuclear weapons programme was started by the Shah, but cancelled by Ayatollah Khomeini after the 1979 revolution because weapons of mass destruction were ?un-Islamic?. It is not known when it started up again, but it certainly didn?t go into high gear until the late Nineties, probably in response to the Pakistani nuclear weapons tests. 

 Iran?s activities nevertheless remained legal under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, since all the early steps towards a nuclear weapons capability are identical to those you would take if you just wanted to have the full fuel cycle for civilian nuclear power generation under your own national control. And if Iran?s major goal is the ability to deter attack if Pakistani nuclear weapons fall into the wrong hands, it is probably only seeking a ?threshold? nuclear weapons capability for now: that is, to get to the point where it could build the actual weapons in six months or so, if the strategic situation suddenly went really bad.

 There are many other counties with this kind of ?threshold? capacity, from Japan and Brazil to Sweden and South Africa. It?s a perfectly legal position to occupy, and given that Iran lives under the shadow of Israeli, American, Russian, Indian and Pakistani nuclear weapons, it?s not unreasonable for Tehran to want to get there. There is obviously a diplomatic deal to be made here, if anybody?s interested.

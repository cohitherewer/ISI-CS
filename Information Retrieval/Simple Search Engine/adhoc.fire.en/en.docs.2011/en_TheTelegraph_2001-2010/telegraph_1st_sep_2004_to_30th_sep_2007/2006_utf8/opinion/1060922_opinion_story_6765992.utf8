 Neon coloured ice cream

THE LIFE AND TIMES OF THE THUNDERBOLT KID By Bill Bryson 

Doubleday, pound; 9.75

Bill Bryson is renowned as a writer of travel memoirs. 

His new book, The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid, is an exploration 

of the lost continent of childhood. In going back to his boyhood days, Bryson 

also reconstructs the idiosyncrasies of the times in which he grew up. This was 

America in the Fifties and for him there has never been a more gratifying time 

or place to be alive in. People were happy because they had more than enough 

to spend and to consume. 

Brysons native town of Des Moines, Iowa, had just 

begun to savour, in the Fifties, the benefits of the newly introduced supermarkets, 

shopping malls and atomic toilets at Bishops cafeteria. Children spent their 

time playing outside from dawn to dusk, having neon-coloured ice creams at Reeds 

or beheading the prized flowers of Mrs Van Pelt. For them it was a joyous world 

that refused to be clouded over even by the threat of Dr. D.K. Brewster, the spooky, 

cadaverous dentist.

The adult world was almost equally impervious to dangers. 

Medical journals spoke effusively about the advantages of smoking. And people 

were actually captivated by the might of the atom bomb. Centres of nuclear tests 

became tourist attractions. Visitors could stay at the Atomic View Motel outside 

Las Vegas, ogle at Miss Atom Bomb or enjoy the gyrations of a stripper who called 

herself the Atomic Blast. Americans revelled in their indestructibility. Never 

have people looked so ridiculous and so happy at the same time.

The other side of this brash confidence could be found 

in the paranoia about Communists. Communism became a byword for anything that 

was unacceptable in society. But this general fear failed to touch the Bryson 

family. The frugal and cautious disposition of Brysons parents resulted in them 

walking in directions quite opposed to those of the age. So the Brysons remained 

a Bolshevik household.

Bryson Senior worked as a sports journalist for the 

Des Moines Register and some of Brysons fondest memories are those of 

the times spent with his father. Bryson records the strange quirks of his parents 

with an affectionate tolerance. Brysons mothers amiable dementia frequently 

resulted in a smoking oven and charred food. While the mother merrily forgot things, 

the father wandered through the household for a midnight snack wearing nothing 

from waist downwards. 

To such talented parents was born the superhero called 

the Thunderbolt Kid, a childhood alter ego of the author. His extraordinary powers 

included ThunderVision, a laser-like gaze that could strip away undergarments 

and, as an incidental benefit, vapourize morons in split seconds. Though this 

superkid initially suspected that he was born to King Volton of Planet Electro, 

he concedes later that he could have been born only to such exceptional earthlings 

as his parents.

Brysons book ends on a note of sadness for a world 

that is fast disappearing. Des Moines is no longer the place it used to be in 

his childhood. This transformation was happening even as Bryson was growing up. 

With chain stores, restaurants and multi-storeyed buildings replacing the old 

landmarks, Des Moines was becoming just like any other place. And on the national 

level, the wide-eyed euphoria of the Fifties was almost over. Satiated with consumption, 

people were beginning to discover that joyous consumerism is a world of diminishing 

returns. In this outr world, the Thunderbolt Kid lost his sacred powers 

and this might just explain the profusion of morons all over the world today.

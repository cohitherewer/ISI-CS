 SEEKING GUIDANCE

 With some help

 If you put aside all the hype about Indian writing in English that springs up every now and then because of the huge advances given, the vast bulk of Indian publishing still deals with educational books for schools and colleges, professional examinations and career advancements. Educational books are the bread-and-butter line that provides the surplus for fiction and general entertainment because books, too, have become a sub-division of the entertainment industry. Hence the questions: first, what is the linkage between our educational institutions and the publishing industry? Second, what are the prospects of an improvement in the editorial standards of our books?

 To teachers, students and increasingly parents what matters are the syllabus and what is expected from the student to get top grades. Since March/April is the examination season, any of the three ?stakeholders? would tell you that only books that cater to the specific requirements of the annual examination matter; all else is irrelevant. Publishers who have fine-tuned the examination system make books that meet these needs, replete with intensive practice drills and ?tips? on how to answer questions within the time limit and space. 

 There is no attempt at understanding the fundamentals or the philosophical presuppositions behind the subject. Only the instrumentalities are mastered. The net result is that even top grade school leavers are innocent of fundamentals and their applications, quite apart from being functionally illiterate without simple communications skills.

 All this is old hat and the government?s response is to continue with the model NCERT textbooks that emphasize fundamentals and their working in real-life situations. But they invariably suffer from one weakness: they are written by a team of college teachers, with school teachers acting as consultants or advisers. This means that there is no uniformity of style and language and the concepts are beyond the comprehension of the average student. The key word is average because a text is always written for the largest common denominator. So the NCERT books are always supplemented by other textbooks.

 The model of what is provided in school textbooks is carried further, in a slightly more sophisticated form, in books for entrance examinations for professional courses in engineering, medicine, civil services, banking and insurance, and so on. The mushrooming of coaching institutes is a clear indication of the popularity of crash courses in every subject.

 These are a clear indication of two trends. First, the failure of the formal institutions to provide the qualified manpower for different sectors of the market, which means basic communication skills and the training to work together. Increasingly, even among the bright students, there is a lack of confidence in formal institutions being able to provide all that is required for the highly competitive job market. Second, although the private and public sectors are expected to work in tandem, the private publishing houses cannot and will not see anything beyond accounts. Students must figure it out themselves with a little help from friends.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DANGEROUS CITY

 Where there is a will, there is usually a way. West Bengal owes it to the boundless enthusiasm of the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, that it has almost found the way in some matters. But the concern, (and some will definitely be shown) over the Institute of Child Healths report that 24 per cent of the citys schoolchildren are being unable to attend classes for a week every month owing to childhood asthma is unlikely to inspire such efforts. This can be put down to the governments failure to see children as a category deserving equal attention as the poor and the neo-rich. It is also a refusal to see the dangers that arise from the governments own evasion of the pollution norms. Had it been otherwise, the government would not have shown such determination to bypass the rules and standards set by the judiciary, time and again, in order to make the state administration see sense. It now appears shameful that West Bengal had been the first to submit an alternative fuel-based plan to the Supreme Court. The other metros New Delhi, Chennai and Mumbai have not only taken up Bengals plan, but also acted on it to drastically reduce their air-pollution levels. Meanwhile, Calcutta, together with its unmatched political record, continues to hold up its neglect of public health as a trophy. The Central Pollution Board ranks this city the first among all other metros in air pollution, and experts promise that its unchecked emissions will turn it into a gas chamber by 2014. Enough reason for children to remain at home throughout the year. 

 Why does the government miss the obvious connection between ill health and its own callousness? There are the political compulsions, of course. The dates, often set by the court, for implementing the alternative fuel, BS-II engine and tail-pipe emission standards have been repeatedly missed, largely dictated by electoral stakes. Where muscle-flexing local politicians are allowed to take upon themselves the protection of bus and auto-rickshaw syndicates, such difficulties are natural. But is the collusion and corruption among the government agencies solely responsible for the children falling ill? Should parents not share the blame for what is happening? The charade being played out in the name of controlling pollution also involves, to a considerable extent, a profound civic indifference to the way life is being lived in this city.

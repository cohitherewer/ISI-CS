 THE OLD ONES

 Old age brings special privileges to politicians in India. It gives them the license to become and remain ministers. When Ms Sonia Gandhi was asked about the induction of young Congress members into the council of ministers, she replied that they should wait and gain more experience. In other words, they should become ministers when they are older. This is amazing coming from the widow of a man who became the prime minister of India when he was just forty. Ms Gandhis mother-in-law, the redoubtable Indira Gandhi, was sworn in for the countrys top job before she had turned fifty. And Jawaharlal Nehru became president of the Congress just after he had crossed forty. Going by precedence, there is very little to support Ms Gandhis contention that ministerial and other kinds of important office should only come to those with experience and age on their side. Unless it can be argued that Ms Gandhi considers those of her immediate family her husband, her mother-in-law, and her grandfather-in-law to be the exceptions that prove the rule. But such an argument falls because Ms Gandhi believes that her son, Mr Rahul Gandhi, would rather wait before taking on positions of responsibility.

 The deference to age and experience that Ms Gandhi has expressed is, of course, a reflection of a very strong tradition that cuts across all sections of Indian society. Disrespect to age is one of the worst transgressions of Indian societal norms. The extrapolation of this into the world of politics has not been entirely beneficial for the Congress and the government that it now heads. It has kept away talent and sapped energy. Another consequence is a mindset that is caught in a time warp. It is a biological fact that old age presents obstacles to change and adaptability; and the familiar is comforting and thus an opiate to the imagination. Thus there are Congress ministers in the present Union cabinet who cannot transcend the rhetoric of populism and socialism with which they are familiar. The old march to an antique drum. The Congress thus has not had a new idea since an old man thought of liberalization as a response to an extreme economic crisis.

 This is not a situation that bodes well for the Congress. In fact, it makes the Congress look like the erstwhile Communist Party of the Soviet Union which resembled a geriatric ward. The last thing the Congress needs for its image and for its future are men hobbling on walking sticks and falling asleep in important meetings. There is an old saying that a man is as old as he feels. Most Congress leaders are not only old, they feel old and act old. It is an irony indeed that a relatively young president of the Congress, by advocating age and experience, is prescribing the petrification of the party. There is only one silver lining to this cloud. The obsolescence in the Congress will only facilitate the take-over of the party by somebody young were he to make the bid.

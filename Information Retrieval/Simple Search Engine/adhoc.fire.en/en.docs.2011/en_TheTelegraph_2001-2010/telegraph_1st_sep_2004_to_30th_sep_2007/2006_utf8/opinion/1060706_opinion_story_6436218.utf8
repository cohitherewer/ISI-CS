 Letters to Editor

 Against all odds

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha?s four-part article, ?The Battle for Bastar? (June 26, 27, 28, 29) was vastly informative, insightful, and humane. The government, in wanton disregard of the opinion of the majority, decides to increase reservations for the backward classes. On the other hand, it allows the lives of the tribal communities in Chhattisgarh to become increasingly unbearable under the twin pressures of Naxalism and the government-sponsored Salwa Judum?s hooliganism ? all the while either feigning ignorance or mouthing diplomatic inanities. When will our politicians start acting on issues that need real attention?

 Yours faithfully,

Paroma Maiti, Calcutta

 Sir ? Not many of us are acquainted with Bastar, even though we are familiar with its ancient name, Dandakaranya, through the Ramayana. Guha refers to a particular area called Abujmarh, which, he says, is the only part of India that is unsurveyed, in spite of being inside the country and not in some distant island. This speaks volumes of the government?s neglect of the tribal areas. 

 On the one hand, the Naxalites are actively opposed by the state-bred Salwa Judum, and on the other, the backward castes and the tribes, called the ?Kallars? and the ?Murias? respectively are warring among themselves. Guha mentions that this civil war is ?played out away from the national gaze and mostly unreported by the national press?, so that no one is bothered about stopping this bloodbath. 

 Whether the Maoists can be brought back to the mainstream, and whether the present arrangement of outsourcing the state?s task of maintaining law and order to an anti-Maoist organization should continue, are debatable issues. But the first job of the administration should be to make the tribals feel that they too are part of mainstream India. Perhaps then they would be able to repose their faith in the government and stop engaging in armed conflict. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The government?s contention that the problem of Maoist unrest is one of law and order shows how casually the administration has chosen to approach what is probably the greatest threat to our democracy today. The fundamental issue here is a socio-economic one in which the citizens of the affected districts of India have been ruthlessly deprived ? sixty years into independence ? of the basic necessities of life courtesy an administrative system that only functions through corruption. There are two ways of addressing the problem in Bastar: one is to immediately cancel the Salwa Judum scheme, and the other is to initiate a dialogue with the Maoists with the objective of resuming the development projects in these districts. The key is to give the Maoists the responsibility for the region?s development, while the state provides the resources. The Maoists will, therefore, be accountable to the people of Bastar on the question of development. Deploying security forces, which seems to be the only solution the government can suggest for every non-security-related matter, can never solve problems related to development. Guha?s analysis of the problem is correct, but the Centre seems reluctant to share his view.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Basking in the glory

 Sir ? While ?Mulling over Mittal? (June 30), Swapan Dasgupta has done a reality check for all Indians who consider Lakshmi Mittal?s takeover of Arcelor as their personal achievement. Mittal?s feat is of an Indian?s rather than India?s. However, Dasgupta does not condemn the people as much as he rebukes the system that governs them. Not just business, almost all the policies of the ruling parties are aimed at garnering narrow political gains. It is all the more disgusting when semi-literate leaders talk about caste-based reservations in premier engineering and medical institutes and the economist prime minister has to heed their wishes. Those who cannot help talent flourish in their own country have no right to express solidarity with their countrymen who prove their mettle abroad.

 Yours faithfully,

Biswaroop Maiti, Calcutta

 Sir ? India seems to have ?its own xenophobic instincts?, much like Europe, as pointed out by Swapan Dasgupta. He is probably right when he says that ?India will be clutching at the wrong end of the stick?, if it shows any pride in Lakshmi Mittal?s accomplishments, for not even a minuscule part of his gains will be invested in India. 

 India may not be the ideal breeding ground for excellence, but Indians who make it good abroad hardly ever try to make things better back home. We may accept Dasgupta?s contention that India is not a place where businessmen can hope to emulate Mittal?s success. But is there any chance of a businessman?s paradise flourishing in a place where entire communities of people are demonized on the basis of their faith or on fanciful notions of ancient India? Can those who have excelled abroad change things around? If not, there is no reason to celebrate. 

 Yours faithfully,

Meher Engineer, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WAITING TO GROW OLD

 Age is an advantage in India. That odious term ageist, a neologism coined by the champions of political correctness, is irrelevant in India. The most visible manifestation of this is in the realm of politics where people do not retire. If senility did not get politicians, there would be no serious harm in describing Indian politics as Peter Pans land. The veneration that old men receive is obvious from the influence wielded by the two grand old men of Hindutva politics Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Mr L.K.Advani. The Bharatiya Janata Party, whatever be its official organizational structure and hierarchy, is actually run according to the decisions of these two men, and this has been the state of affairs for quite some time. One immediate result of this has been the growing frustration of the second rung of the partys leadership. Leaders like Ms Sushma Swaraj and Mr Arun Jaitley have been waiting in the wings for a number of years, but their upward mobility and ambitions have been stymied because senior politicians in India never retire. What is worse is that often and this is happening now when candidates for the byelections in Vidisha and Bhagalpur are being chosen the opinions and arguments of the younger leaders are not taken into account. One explanation for this pre-eminent position of Messrs Vajpayee and Advani can be that the next generation of BJP leaders have not yet proved their mettle. This view can be countered by the argument that the younger generation has never been allowed to function to their full potential because of the presence of the two older leaders. Like two giant banyan trees, Mr Vajpayee and Mr Advani have not allowed anyone to grow in their shade.

 It would be a mistake, of course, to say that the BJP is the only political party facing the age factor. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) a political entity that is ideologically poles apart from the BJP, and also a party that does not subscribe to the view that individuals make history is also affected by the symptom of respect to age. At the meeting of the politburo in Calcutta, a few weeks ago, Mr Jyoti Basu, who is well past 90, offered to step down from the politburo. His offer was rejected. Mr Basu, despite his offer to resign and his poor health, remains fully engaged in party affairs; if he was serious about his intentions, Mr Basu would withdraw from the party. Thus, both at the organizational level and at the individual level, there is a strange reluctance to let go.

 In one sense, there is nothing surprising in all this. A political party, whatever be its orientation, cannot remain unaffected by the beliefs and practices of the society in which it functions. Indian tradition is more respectful towards age than most others. Political parties only reflect this. But deference has come to be seen as a permit to atrophy.

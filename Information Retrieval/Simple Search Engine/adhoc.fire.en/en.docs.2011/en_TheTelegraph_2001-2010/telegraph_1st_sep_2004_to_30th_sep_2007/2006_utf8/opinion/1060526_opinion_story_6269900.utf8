Mummy behind the camera 

Top: Nehru?s 1948 Cabinet at a lunch 

hosted by Sardar Patel after Rajagopalachari became Governor-General; A game at 

a social event at Delhi?s Gymkhana Club, organized by General Cariappa after he 

became Army Chief following Independence; Bottom: A rare picture taken 

when both Homai and Nehru were aboard India?s first BOAC jet plane (which crashed 

on its second flight): ?he gallantly lit up a cigarette for the wife of the Deputy 

High Commissioner of Britain.? 

 INDIA IN FOCUS: CAMERA CHRONICLES OF HOMAI VYARAWALLA (Parzor Foundation and 

Mapin, Rs 2,750) by Sabeena Gadihoke is an invaluable book about a remarkable 

woman. Homai Vyarawalla is India?s first woman press photographer. Her work chronicles 

the last years of the Raj in Bombay and Delhi, the first euphoric years after 

Independence, and then the relatively more complex tones of the Sixties and Seventies. 

Born in 1913 into a middle-class Parsi family in Gujarat, Homai grew up in Bombay, 

was the only girl in her class to complete her matriculation examination, and 

was trained in photography largely by herself, by Maneckshaw (whom she married 

later), and at the J.J. School of Arts. Her career included working for The 

Illustrated Weekly and then with the British Information Services. She is 

seen here (third from top) at a photo session with Mrs Gandhi (then prime 

minister), the subject? together with Nehru ? of what are now iconic photographs 

by Homai. Distinctive, indomitable and endearingly funny, Homai was nicknamed 

?Princess? by Radhakrishnan, ?Energy? by General Cariappa, and ?Mummy? by her 

colleagues. When she photographed the Mahatma with a flash, he snapped at her, 

?Yeh ladki mujhe andha nahi banaige tab tak nahi jayegi [This girl will 

not rest until she makes me blind].?

 ?With no one to guide me in my formative years,? Homai writes in 2005, ?I 

had to depend solely on my own instinct to plan out my future. The credit for 

all that I was able to achieve goes to my very supportive mother, who despite 

criticism from the orthodox, as well as financial constraints, allowed me all 

freedom to do what I thought was best for me. Another very important person in 

my life ? my husband ? not only encouraged me to take on the exclusive male dominated 

profession of press photography, but also shared, on an equal basis, the burden 

of balancing family with professional life to our entire satisfaction.? 

 Gadihoke?s work brings together excellent reproductions of Homai?s photographs, 

thorough curating, nuanced and readable biographical documentation, and a well-researched 

grasp of Homai?s social and historical context, especially the history of the 

Parsi community that is embodied in her life and career. 

 One also gets to hear Homai?s voice vividly in this book: ?It was fifty years 

of having taken these pictures that I started to see the value of my work.? And 

her reasons for giving up photography after the Seventies: ?I had shot important 

people from all over the world. You do not want to go for small things then, for 

people who are not gracious, dignified and sincere. I missed that graciousness 

and when it was gone, my interest in photography was gone as well.?

 The mass organizations that make for the CPI(M)?s strength are also becoming a major problem for it, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Helping hand

 Anil Biswas, secretary of the Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), is not much of a public speaker. He is better known as a backroom boy who plans the party games, identifies and sorts out problems, sets targets and devises strategies to achieve them. In other words, he is the quintessential organization man. 

 At the rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds that launched the CPI(M)?s campaign for the coming assembly elections in Bengal, Biswas set out the target for party workers ? they must ensure that the Left Front candidates get at least 50 per cent of the votes in each booth. (In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, the state had 48,775 booths.) The Left Front must not only increase its share of seats in the assembly, he said, but also ensure that the opposition?s share goes down to the level of 1987, when the undivided Congress could manage to win only 40 of the 294 seats ? a daunting task by any standards for a party that has ruled the state for nearly 30 years. 

 One could argue that Biswas set the party the seemingly impossible target only in order to enthuse the activists. Opposition parties would see it as yet another example of the CPI(M)?s scheme to rig the elections. But Biswas?s campaign call actually brings the focus back to the CPI(M)?s organizational might and its role in Bengal?s elections. 

 Barring those who attribute the CPI(M)?s electoral successes to rigging alone, most political observers agree that the party?s organization makes all the difference. But not all such observers have an idea of the depth and the reach of the party?s organization. 

 At the last count, the CPI(M) had 2.84 lakh full-time members. Even though this makes it the biggest political party in the state, the number does not quite capture the scale of the party?s organizational strength. It is only when you add up the numbers of the members of the party?s mass organizations that you get an idea of the colossal machinery that is available to the CPI(M) during the elections. 

 Of the party?s numerous mass organizations, the biggest is the Krishak Sabha, the peasants? wing, which alone has 1.4 crore members in Bengal. Its student and youth wings together account for close to another crore of members. The trade union unit, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, has about 29 lakh members and the women?s wing, the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, 36.62 lakh members. Add to these the powerful school teachers? unions with memberships running to over 2.3 lakh and you have a fair idea of the force that opposition parties have to contend with in the elections. In the Lok Sabha elections in 2004, total voters in the state numbered a little over 4.74 crore and 3.69 crore of them actually voted. It is easy to see how the huge membership of its mass organizations gives the CPI(M) a big advantage over its rivals. 

 Other parties too have their mass organizations. But two things make the organizational advantage different for the CPI(M). First, the numbers. All opposition parties and their affiliated unions together do not count for even 10 per cent of the membership of the Marxist mass units. Second and far more important, the CPI(M)?s organizations are patronized by the government and are therefore capable of buying the poor people?s loyalty ? and votes ? in the manner that the opposition parties cannot. 

 But there are indications that these organizations that make for the CPI(M)?s strength are also becoming its major problem. Increasingly, these organizations are seen as the government?s collaborators rather than as independent tools of mass mobilization. Worse still, these are even turning into instruments of coercion. 

 One gets to know of the Citu?s strong-arm tactics because labour unrest makes news. What is not so frequently reported in newspapers is the way local party bosses control practically every aspect of life. In the villages, the party?s leaders and panchayat functionaries decide on every little thing. Neither the poor nor the affluent farmers can do without the Krishak Sabha. They cannot get anything done without the party?s intervention. 

 The terror that the Students? Federation of India recently unleashed to try and turn its defeat in the elections to the Presidency College students? union into a fraudulent victory leaves little doubt about what more it does to capture students? bodies in colleges in the districts. 

 Ask any school teacher and you will be told that everything about schools and teachers depends on the All Bengal Teachers? Association. Any independent college or university teacher will tell you how the West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association lords it over higher education in Bengal. In fact, leaders of the WBCUTA and the West Bengal Government College Teachers? Association are said to be no better than militant Citu leaders in small towns when it comes to browbeating not only anti-left teachers but also politically unattached ones among them. 

 One could argue that activists of various mass units attached to the Trinamool Congress or the Congress are no angels either. But everyone knows that these parties? capacity for mischief is small in comparison to that of the ruling party. Mamata Banerjee has shown time and again her powers to trigger violence on the streets. But even her shows of strength bear no comparison with the all-pervasive grip of the CPI(M) on people?s lives and minds. 

 If there is an increasing impatience among a wide cross-section of people with the CPI(M)?s ways, it may not be over the policies of the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. Much of it is due to the overbearing and even oppressive ways of the so-called ?organization men? within the CPI(M). 

 Leninist ideas of the importance of the organization have always been the cornerstone of any Marxist party. Earlier generations of Bengal?s leftists were also groomed on Joe Hill?s famous last words before he was executed in Utah in America in 1915: ?Don?t mourn for me. Organize.? Pete Seeger?s song, ?Talking Union? (?It aint quite this simple, so I better explain/ Just why I got to ride on the union train?), was popular among young comrades on leftist cultural fronts.

 But that was in another time when joining leftist organizations meant sacrifices. Today, leftist organizations look pretty much like any other centres of vested interests and pressure groups. But if the people are so disgusted with the CPI(M)?s ways, one could ask, why do its mass units still get so many members? The answer is that they do because the people cannot do without them, no matter whether they love them or hate them. 

 If that sounds somewhat contradictory, that is precisely the point about public responses to the CPI(M)?s organizational prowess. Its organizational superiority over other parties still wins the party the elections, but if the people?s disgust with it turns into anger, the same organization can be the Marxists? nemesis.

 A LIFELINE FOR TROUBLED WORKERS

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 Convention No. 81... provides for a system of labour inspection to secure the enforcement of the legal provisions relating to conditions of work and the protection of workers in industrial workplaces, as well as in commercial workplaces if the ratifying State accepts this extension...

 It deals with the organization and functioning of inspection services, the responsibilities of a central authority, their cooperation with other public and private services and with employers and workers or their organizations, the recruitment of qualified staff in sufficient numbers (including women) and with appropriate status, material means and facilities (offices and transport) the thorough regular inspection of workplaces, and the publication of reports and annual statistics on the work of the inspection services.

 The Convention defines the functions of labour inspectors and their powers, i.e.: the power to enter freely any workplace liable to inspection, to carry out inquiries freely and in particular to interrogate persons alone, to examine documents and take samples; the powers to make orders with a view to remedying defects and to decide whether it is appropriate to give warning and advice or to institute or recommend proceedings. In return, inspectors are required to respect certain obligations: they are prohibited from having any direct or indirect interest in the undertakings under their supervision and shall not reveal manufacturing or commercial secrets of the workplaces they inspect, or the source of any complaint.

 ....Convention No. 129 applies to agricultural undertakings with salaried employees or apprentices, or ? subject to a declaration by the ratifying State ? also to tenants, sharecroppers and similar categories of agricultural ?workers?, members of cooperatives or even of the family of the operator. Regarding the organization, the functions and the staff of the system of inspection, as well as the duties, powers and obligations of the inspectors, its provisions are, to a large extent, based on those of Convention No. 81.

 Convention No.129 contains certain innovations which take into account special characteristics of agriculture and experiences gained since Convention No.81 was adopted twenty years earlier.

 These take the form of provisions on the organizational flexibility and structure of inspection services, the extension of inspectors? advisory or enforcement functions regarding conditions of life of workers and their families, the possibility of including in the system of labour inspection officials or representatives of occupational organizations, and of entrusting certain inspection functions at the regional or local level to other appropriate government services or public institutions.

 ....Finally, the Protocol to Convention No. 81, which is open to ratification by all Members having ratified that Convention, reaffirms the principles of the basic standard and promotes its application to ?non-commercial services?...while at the same time providing the necessary element of flexibility to ensure that legitimate concerns...do not stand in the way of applying the Convention to that sector.

 These standards provide the indispensable, indeed universal framework for the status and functioning of labour inspection. As such they are a source of strength and authority to the inspection system, the inspectors and the clients they are to serve.

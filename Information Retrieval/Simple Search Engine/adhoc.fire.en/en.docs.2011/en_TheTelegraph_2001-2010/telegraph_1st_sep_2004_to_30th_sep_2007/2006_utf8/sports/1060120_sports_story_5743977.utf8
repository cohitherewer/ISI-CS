 Scratchy Sania crashes out

Melbourne: Sania Mirza crashed out of the Australian Open after a straight sets loss to Michaella Krajicek of The Netherlands in the second round on Thursday. 

The Indian star recovered from a sluggish start to put up a tougher challenge in the latter part of the match, but committed far too many unforced errors to go down 3-6, 5-7. 

The 19-year-old, seeded 32nd, was broken four times in the first set. She picked up some momentum in the second set as she bounced back from a break and saved two match points in the 10th game. 

Sania struggled with her timing throughout and even her ever-reliable forehand kept misfiring. As it were, she hit a forehand long to concede the match after an hour and 21 minutes, committing five double-faults and 35 unforced errors along the way. 

Bad luck continued for Sania as she lost her doubles first round match as well. Sania, who teamed up with Corina Morariu of the US, lost 2-6, 1-6 to Amelie Mauresmo and Svetlana Kuznetsova, seeded 14th, in just an hour. 

Bhupathi up 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Wesley Moodie advanced to the second round of mens doubles with a straight set victory over unseeded Daniele Bracciali of Italy and Australias Oliver Marach. 

The Indo-South African pair, seeded eleventh, won their first round match 7-5, 6-3 in one hour and 16 minutes. 

The eleventh seeds will now take on Arnaud Clement and Michael Llodra. (PTI)

Karachi: Pakistan won the third and final Test against the West Indies by 199 runs after leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and pacer Abdul Razzaq took the last four wickets for 17 runs after tea on Friday. 

The West Indies, set an improbable victory target of 444, were dismissed for 244 in 76 overs with Kaneria (3/69) and Razzaq (2/23) cleaning up the lower order in 69 balls. 

The win gave Pakistan a 2-0 victory in the three-match series after they took the first match in Lahore by nine wickets and the second in Multan ended in a high-scoring draw. 

The Test was dominated by scoring-machine Mohammed Yousuf who had innings of 102 and 124 and notched up his ninth hundred of the year while setting a record for most runs in a calendar year, 1,788. 

Pakistan made 304 in the first innings and bowled out West Indies for 260 and then set them difficult target by declaring on 399 for six in their second outing on Thursday. 

The visitors suffered major setbacks in the second over after tea after resuming on 226 for five. 

Kaneria first trapped Shivnarine Chanderpaul leg before for a well-grafted 69 and next ball had Daren Powell caught at forward short leg by Younis Khan. 

Razzaq then took the last two wickets, trapping Jerome Taylor and Corey Collymore leg before to complete his 100 wickets in Tests. 

Meanwhile, West Indian vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan was on Friday ruled out of the five-match one-day series after suffering a hairline fracture on his right foot. 

Sarwan was hit by a delivery from Pakistani fast bowler Umer Gul and the X-ray shows a hairline fracture on the instep of his right foot which is now placed in a cast, West Indian media manager Imran Khan told reporters. 

Pakistan and the West Indies play the first of five one-day matches in Rawalpindi on December 5. 

The 26-year-old Guyanese will fly back to the West Indies in the next couple of days, said Imran. Sarwan only returned to the West Indies team in the third Test after being left out of the second Test in Multan due to poor batting form. 

He was on 35 in the pre-lunch session on Friday when Guls yorker hit him on the foot. He returned to the pavilion and went to hospital for an X-ray.

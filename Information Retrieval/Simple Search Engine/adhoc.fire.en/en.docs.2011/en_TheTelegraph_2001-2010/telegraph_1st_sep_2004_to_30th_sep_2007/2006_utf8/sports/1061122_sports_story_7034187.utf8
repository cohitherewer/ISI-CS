 - FIRST ASHES TEST 

 Injured Ian Bell a doubtful starter 

 Watson 

Melbourne: Australia allrounder Shane Watson has been ruled out of the first Test against England starting in Brisbane on Thursday after failing to recover from a hamstring injury, Cricket Australia said on Tuesday. 

The 25-year-old injured the hamstring while bowling for Queensland last week and was ruled out after he was unable to bowl during practice on Tuesday, his training restricted to a few laps of the outfield with physio Alex Kountouris. 

Ive done everything I can over the last three days to give it a shot but unfortunately I was only a few days away, Watson told reporters at the Gabba. 

Its not a good feeling, its something Ive been working towards over the past six months. I feel my game has really improved and that I have earned this spot in the Australian cricket team. 

Watson, who will be replaced by batsman Michael Clarke in the starting XI, said he hoped to be fit in time for the second Test starting in Adelaide on December 1. 

Meanwhile, England batsman Ian Bell remains in doubt for the Brisbane Test despite being cleared of any fractures after injuring his wrist during practice on Tuesday. 

Bell, 24, was taken to a Brisbane hospital for precautionary X-rays after being struck in the Gabba nets by paceman James Anderson, throwing a scare into the camp two days before the first Ashes test in Brisbane. 

England released a statement saying the scans had cleared Bell of any breaks but his hand was heavily bruised and the injury would be reassessed on Wednesday.

 Younis move a breach of discipline: PCB

 - Abdul Razzaq named vice-captain 

 Younis Khan 

Karachi: Following Younis Khans shock refusal to lead Pakistan in upcoming Champions Trophy, a statement from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) claimed they had been caught by surprise. 

The PCB deeply regrets that Younis Khan chose to announce his withdrawal from the captaincy of the Pakistan team for the Champions Trophy. He did so without prior consultation with the board, it said. 

The statement described Younis actions as a breach of discipline and said the long-time vice-captain may now face action, but would retain his place in the side. 

Younis has since expressed his regret to the chairman, Shaharyar Khan, for the unsavoury incident, the statement read. 

(He) has reconfirmed to the chairman that he does not wish to be considered for captaincy and has conveyed to us that he is prepared to continue playing as a member. 

PCB has taken note of the incident, and the matter will be dealt with in accordance with the rules and regulations of the board. Younis will step down from the captaincy on his own accord but will continue to play, it said. 

Abdul Razzaq was named as vice-captain to Mohammed Yousuf, who was chosen as the captain.

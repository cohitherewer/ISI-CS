Calcutta: Shatrunjoy Gaekwad will be missing Sourav Ganguly when Baroda take on Bengal in the Ranji Trophy semi-final from Friday. 

The son of ex-India opener and coach Aunshuman, Shatrunjoy is a big fan of the former Team India captain. I am a left-handed batsman and his (Souravs) exquisite drives through the off-side are a treat to watch. He is a role model for any left-hander, said Shatrunjoy, who is in the Baroda XV for the first time this season. 

Two years ago, the left-handed middle order batsman got two precious gifts which he still cherishes: one of Souravs bats with which he made his Ranji debut and a pair of gloves. Shatrunjoy is not carrying that bat on this trip as he uses a lighter willow now. 

When my father (Anshuman) took over as Team India coach in 1997, it became easy for me to interact with Sourav frequently. His tips benefited me a lot. I was hoping to meet him on this visit? 

As a fan, of course, I am happy to see him back in the side and hopefully he will play a big knock in the next Test, added Shatrumjoy. 

The Baroda squad has another high-profile name ? Yusuf Pathan, the elder brother of Irfan. And he has no doubts that life has changed a lot following Irfans exploits for Team India. 

We have moved to a big house in Baroda and there is this recognition of being the brother of a young cricket star. I dont have a problem in being known as the brother of Irfan Pathan, admitted Yusuf. 

There is a competition between us but it is only restricted to the field. When we are bowling to each other in the nets, it is a challenge for both which we really relish, added Yusuf.

 Provisional ban on Shailaja

New Delhi: Weighlifter Pujari Shailaja was on Wednesday provisionally suspended for testing positive for a banned drug. The 22-year-old Shailaja was found to have traces of a banned substance stanozol during a random out-of-competition test by world anti-doping agency officials dur-ing their recent visit to Patiala. 

Report has been received from International Weightlifting Federation that her sample has returned adverse analytical findings such as stanozol, a metabolite of stanozolol which is anabolic steroid. We are shocked to receive the report, IWF general secretary Balbir Singh Bhatia said on Wednesday. 

Shailaja has been provisionally suspended by the IWF. We are requesting the world body to testing her B sample, he added. 

Immediately after receiving the communication from the world body, the Indian weightlifting federation decided to pull her out of the squad for the Commonwealth Games. 

The federation has also pulled her out of the team for the Commonwealth Games. SAI has been requested to remove her from the on-going camp at NIS, Patiala, he said.

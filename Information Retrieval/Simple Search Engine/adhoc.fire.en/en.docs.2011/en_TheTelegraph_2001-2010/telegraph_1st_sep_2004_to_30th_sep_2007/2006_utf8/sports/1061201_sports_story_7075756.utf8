 Paddlers, shuttlers out of team events 

JAYDEEP BASU 

Doha: She has won hearts even before the Games have begun. Sania Mirza, it seems, has become a big hit at the Asian Games so far. 

On Thursday, when the last batch of Indian contingent arrived here for the Games, the media hype could have left even the top sporting personalities from countries like China or Japan green with envy. 

While top Indian Olympic Association (IOA) officials, including a union minister, walked away unnoticed through the exit, Sania Mirza found herself mobbed by mediapersons, TV crew and youngsters. 

Always a big draw in the Gulf countries, Sania, wearing faded-blue jeans, off-white T-shirt and sporting sparkling sunglasses, had some interesting comments on her plans for the Games. 

This is one event where my world ranking really doesnt matter, said the Hyderabad girl. Here I have come to play for India and do well. We all feel inspired to play for India and with someone like Leander Paes around there is no doubt that we can take India to the top. 

Another member of the Indian team, Shikha Uberoi also had to answer a few queries, but her presence was completely overshadowed by the popularity of her more famous teammate. 

It is always like that, said Shikha smilingly. With so many top players like Sania, Paes and Bhupathi around, we do have a fantastic chance of winning four gold medals. 

Shikha herself is optimistic about three gold medals for India . I might not take part in the doubles, but will play in singles, team event and the mixed doubles with Mahesh Bhupathi. 

While the tennis stars raised hopes of boosting Indias medals tally in the Games, the paddlers and shuttlers bid good bye in the team event even before the opening ceremony could be held. 

In womens table tennis, India went down 0-3 to South Korea in the quarter finals. While Bengal girl Poulami Ghatak managed to win one game against Kim Kyung Ah, the other two Mouma Das and Shamini Kumaresan bowed out tamely. In badminton, Indians lost to hot favourites Indonesia. 

The table tennis mens team won an inconsequential match against Yemen 3-0 in the morning. 

 It was good to win, but we are already out of the competition after losing to China and Japan in the other group matches, said Soumyadeep Roy. Roy, however, feels that he has a chance to make the last 16 round in the individual event. 

For the shooting team, it was a rather disturbing beginning at the Games Village on Wednesday. Top medal contender and double trap shooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore got involved in a heated exchange with the security staff when the shooter was asked to open his bag. Rathore is believed to have got irritated by the behaviour of the securitymen. 

The security people were rude with one of our most respected athletes, said Indian coach Sunny Thomas. This is an unfortunate incident. But we do not want to drag it further.

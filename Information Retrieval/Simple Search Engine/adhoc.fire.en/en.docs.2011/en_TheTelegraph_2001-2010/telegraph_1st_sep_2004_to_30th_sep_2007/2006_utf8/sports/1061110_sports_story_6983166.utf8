Madrid: Justine Henin-Hardenne secured a place in the semi-finals of the WTA Championship with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Russias Nadia Petrova on Thursday. 

Its a great feeling to qualify for the semis, the Belgian said after the match. I missed the last two editions because of injury... so its great to be back at the top of the tree. 

Henin-Hardennes win means that Maria Sharapova will now have to win the tournament and hope the Belgian does not make the final if she is to deprive her of ending the year as No.1. 

On Wednesday, Sharapova racked up her 18th win in a row with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Kim Clijsters. 

Swiss Martina Hingis bounced back after her opening day defeat to Henin-Hardenne with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 victory over Petrova. 

Svetlana Kuznetsova, No. 4 in the world, started with a 7-5, 6-3 victory.

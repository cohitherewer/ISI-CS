The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal squad on Monday

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB will pick the squad for the national one-day meet on Monday. 

The squad will be announced after CAB officials speak to Sourav Ganguly on whether he will take part in the competition. The East Zone meet begins in Dhanbad on Saturday. 

According to a source, the former India captain is unlikely to make himself available for the national one-dayers, but may play for East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy which will be hosted by Central Zone from February 25.

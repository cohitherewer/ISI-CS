The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India a point behind Pak

 - Dravid holds on to 2nd spot 

 Dubai: Pakistans 

 forfeiture of the fourth and final Test and their series 

 loss against England left them just one rating point clear 

 of India in the latest ICC Test rankings.

 Pakistan, with 111 and India at 

 112 have, however, maintained their third and fourth spots, 

 respectively, behind leaders Australia and England.

 England will need to win this 

 summers Ashes series by three clear Tests to upstage 

 Australia from the top of the table as their series win 

 over Pakistan left them 11 rating points adrift of Ricky 

 Pontings side.

 But that would be a tough task 

 as Australia are yet to lose a series on home turf since 

 1992-93 when the West Indies won 2-1. And the last time 

 England won a series there by three clear Tests was way 

 back in 1978-79 when they won 5-1.

 Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf 

 shot up to his best-ever third place in the ICC Test players 

 rankings after scoring 631 runs in four matches against 

 England.

 He is now the highest-placed Pakistan 

 batsman behind Ponting and Team India captain Rahul Dravid. 

 Yousuf and Younis Khan, now fourth, have swapped places.

 Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq 

 held on to his seventh spot, completing a hattrick of Pakistan 

 players with top-10.

 Englands leading batsman 

 in the table remains Kevin Pietersen, in 11th, although 

 captain Andrew Strauss is hot on heels, up one place to 

 12th, equalling his best placing this year.

 There has been little change in 

 the rankings for bowlers following the fourth Test between 

 England and Pakistan.

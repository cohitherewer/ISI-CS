 I will be happy with No. 5 spot: Yuvraj

Colombo: Flamboyant left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh said on Thursday that he would be happy to play at his favourite No. 5 spot in Team Indias batting line-up. 

With captain Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Irfan Pathan and Virender Sehwag likely to occupy the top four positions in the batting order, there is every likelihood that the Punjab batsman may get back his favourite No. 5 spot. 

As a No. 5 batsman, Yuvraj has scored 1161 runs in 29 one-dayers at an average of 58.05, hitting four centuries and six half-centuries last season. 

Obviously, when you do well you want to remain there. I was a bit down but I practised well and had a good training camp. I am happy that I got it back, he said. 

Yuvraj said it did not bother him that he was going into the series after an ordinary tour of the West Indies. 

Pressure is there in any series you play. Obviously, I want to get back to my best and try to do well, he said. 

Yuvraj said performances were dependent on the preparations one made.

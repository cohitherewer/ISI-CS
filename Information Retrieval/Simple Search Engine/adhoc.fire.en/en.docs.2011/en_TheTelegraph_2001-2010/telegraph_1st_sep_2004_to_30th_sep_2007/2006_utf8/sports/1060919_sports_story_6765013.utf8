The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 West Indies win pushes India to a sticky position

 - Australians missed Ponting, McGrath: Brian Lara 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Brian Lara, who 

 made 87, in Kuala Lumpur on Monday 

 Kuala Lumpur: For the umpteenth 

 time in a tri-series, the Indians are on a sticky wicket. 

 The most simple calculation for making Sundays final 

 is that theyve got to beat both the West Indies and 

 Australia in the last two league matches. 

 May be simple on paper, but quite 

 daunting otherwise.

 While the West Indies are best 

 placed to make the DLF Cups title-round captain 

 Brian Lara got carried away somewhat, after beating Australia 

 on Monday, and said his team is already there the possibility 

 of a three-way tie cant be ruled out.

 After all, if India thrash the 

 West Indies (with a bonus point) and the match against Australia 

 gets abandoned, then all three will each be on nine points. 

 The run rate is then going to come into the picture. At 

 the moment, the Indians are poorly placed.

 For now, however, Lara and his 

 men will be uncorking champagne. 

 After strangling themselves in 

 their first match versus the world champions, they managed 

 to overcome hiccups and won by three wickets. At one time, 

 it seemed dashing opener Chris Gayle and Lara, who was batting 

 beautifully, would themselves complete the job. Yet, both 

 departed and others also followed, but Dwayne Bravo kept 

 cool.

 Oh no... I wasnt hassled... 

 It was comfortable as wed been ahead (on the run rate) 

 throughout... Wasnt tough at all, Bravo told 

 The Telegraph on returning to the teams hotel. 

 He wont, among other things, forget the six he slammed 

 off Nathan Bracken in a hurry.

 Lara top-scored (87), while Gayle 

 contributed 79. Bravo, who is emerging a finisher, stayed 

 unbeaten on 37 when the target (273) was reached in the 

 48th over. The top two added 151 for the third-wicket, with 

 the bulk of the runs coming off first-change Stuart Clark.

 Clark bowled seven no balls and 

 three wides and went for 87 in a mere seven overs. No, 

 I didnt think of bringing him back, confessed 

 stand-in captain Michael Hussey, trying hard not to grin. 

 Only somebody insane would have risked a faster finish by 

 throwing the ball at the New South Welshman one more time.

 For a disciplined unit, Australia 

 conceded 33 extras, which included 11 no balls and 16 wides. 

 Too many sundries... Cost us the match, moaned 

 the captain-for-the-day. He felt 272 had been a winning 

 score. 

 One felt sorry for Hussey, for 

 he did everything possible. First, he authored his maiden 

 ODI hundred when the team was struggling. Then, he collaborated 

 a world record 165 for the sixth-wicket with Brad Haddin, 

 who got his first fifty... In the second session, Hussey 

 tried keeping spirits high, but Lara and Gayle were much 

 too hot.

 Adjudged MoM for his unbeaten 

 109, the third highest score by a captain on debut, Hussey 

 remarked he would reflect on his innings with 

 pride for the time being, though, the day had been very 

 disappointing. Even regular captain Ricky Pontings 

 presence during the drinks breaks made no difference. 

 The Australians effected seven 

 changes from the XI which played against India on Saturday, 

 but Lara insisted that wasnt much of a factor. The 

 Australians missed Ponting and (Glenn) McGrath with him 

 around you feel as if its a 40-over match but they 

 still had some big names on the park... Kudos to my team...

 According to Hussey, despite the 

 defeat, the rotation-principle wont be 

 done away with. 

 If Lara paid McGrath such a high 

 compliment, Hussey had very nice things to say of him: Lara 

 manipulated the ball brilliantly... I tried playing mind 

 games, with field placements, but he was superb.

 Lara, of course, made the point 

 that his team was very humble about being in 

 the current position. He added: We didnt turn 

 up just to see some matches... Only, say, to watch the final... 

 Weve come to win... I have faith in my players and 

 their confidence is going to grow (after the win over Australia).

 Gayle, who has been having a smashing 

 tournament, pointed out he had a ball by ball 

 approach and would go for it if the ball landed in 

 the slot. If hes a lot more consistent, nowadays, 

 its thanks to long hours at nets. Pity 

 the bowlers there. 

 Australias New South Wales 

 players, incidentally, wore black armbands to mourn the 

 passing away of a very young fan who was suffering from 

 leukaemia.

 Styris cleared to play

Wellington: New Zealand allrounder Scott Styris has been cleared to take part in the Champions Trophy after coming through a training camp unscathed over the last week. 

Styris injured his back playing for Middlesex in the County championship last month and was in doubt. 

Styris pulled out of his last County game on September 10, a week after the back pain first flared. 

I wasnt too sure when I came down to this camp how it would go but I have been bowling for five to six days at 100 per cent intensity and havent felt it at all, Styris said. 

Team manager said Styris had been given the all-clear along with several other bowlers returning from injury. (AFP)

 Prince plays the saviour

 - 3rd Test vs Australia

 Ashwell Prince in Johannesburg on Friday 

Johannesburg: Ashwell Prince led South Africas recovery with an unbeaten 79 after wickets tumbled on the first day of the third Test against Australia on Friday. 

South Africa, who elected to bat, were on 238 for six when bad light ended play 11 overs early. 

The patient Prince batted for 182 minutes, faced 128 balls and hit 10 fours. 

Prince shared partnerships of 55 for the fifth wicket with Jacques Rudolph and 72 for the sixth wicket with Mark Boucher. 

Fast bowler Stuart Clark led Australias disciplined attack with figures of two for 61 from 20 overs. Australia lead the three-match series 2-0. 

Brett Lee and Clark shared the new ball and found the line and length immediately. 

The first boundary followed in the 10th over when Herschelle Gibbs, opening in place of injured captain Graeme Smith, drove Clark handsomely through the covers. 

South Africas troubles started four overs later when De Villiers lifted a drive off Clark and was neatly caught low down by Damien Martyn at cover for 12. 

Three overs later, the home side were reduced to 38 for two when Gibbs left a delivery from fast bowler Michael Kasprowicz and was bowled for 16. 

Jacques Kallis and Boeta Dippenaar batted solidly for the rest of the morning session to nurse South Africa to lunch on 67 for two. 

They were separated in the 10th over after lunch when Dippenaar, who hit seven fours during his 32, drove expansively at a delivery from Clark and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist to end a partnership of 59. 

Lee bowled Kallis for 37 with an in-swinger that nipped through the gate, reducing South Africa to 106 for four in the ninth over before tea. 

 Prince and Rudolph turned the 

 tide in South Africas favour with their positive approach.

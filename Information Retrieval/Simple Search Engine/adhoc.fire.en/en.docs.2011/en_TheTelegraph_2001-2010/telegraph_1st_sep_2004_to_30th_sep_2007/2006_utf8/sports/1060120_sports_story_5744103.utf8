 Lions victorious

Chandigarh: Bangalore Lions registered a convincing 3-1 victory over Maratha Warriors in a Premier Hockey League match played at the Sector 42 stadium here on Thursday. 

Lions attack consisting of Sandeep Michael, Tushar Khandekar and Rehan Butt combined well and found their bearings to exploit the disorganised defence of Warriors. 

Warriors tended to attack from the right but Prabodh Tirkey was rock solid in the defence shutting. (PTI)

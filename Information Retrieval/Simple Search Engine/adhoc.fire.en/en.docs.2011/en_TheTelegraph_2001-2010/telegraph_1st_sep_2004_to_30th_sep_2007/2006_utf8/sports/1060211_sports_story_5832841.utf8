 Shiv makes the cut

 - Perth golf 

Perth: It was not as big a day for Indias Shiv Kapur but he was the only Indian to make the cut at five-under on the second day at the Johnnie Walker Classic Golf Tournament here on Friday. 

From 11th, he dropped to tied 24th place after adding a 71 to his opening 68. While he was disappointed with a stuttering finish with one double bogey and a bogey, his playing partner Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters winner, predicted a rosy future for the 23-year-old. 

Shiv knows how to play golf, said Couples. Hes got his future ahead of him. I like his temperament. He hits the ball really solid. Hes not long, hes not short. Hes like Justin Leonard. He is really, really good. I like the way he plays. I think he will do really well, he said adding that the Indian will eventually play his way into the US PGA Tour. 

 Koreas Choi Kyung-Ju charged 

 into a two-shot halfway lead as he took a giant step towards 

 delivering Asias first winner in the prestigious tournament. 

 Indias other two players, Gaurav Ghei (72-74) and 

 Jeev Milkha Singh (73-78) missed the cut which came at one-under.

 Focus on team, not Shoaib alone

 - We no longer depend on individual shows: Dravid 

Bangalore: Indian skipper Rahul Dravid on Monday said Pakistans ploy of targeting individuals would not work, as his team no longer depended on any one player to pull off victories. 

Speaking in context of Indias trip to Pakistan this week, Dravid felt it would be a fallacy if Inzamam-ul Haqs men depended too much on Shoaib Akhtar and targeted just a couple of batsmen in the Indian team. 

Dravid said as far as India were concerned, they would focus on the entire Pakistani team. 

Pakistan have got some good players. I think if we focus on just one or two players, we will be making a mistake, and I think if they focus on one or two players in our team, they will be making a mistake because we have shown over the last month that a lot of our guys are performing, he said. 

It is not just one or two players who do well. So, we are not going to focus on one or two individuals. It is going to be about the team, he said. 

Asked whether Shoaibwould be a factor, Dravid said: Well, no. The whole team is a factor. You can make a mistake if you focus on one or two individuals. 

Shoaib has reportedly said on TV that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid were scared of his bowling. 

Dravid also said he did not believe in all the talk about being favourites or underdogs. 

I dont believe in someone being favourites and someone being underdogs. Both teams start even. Whichever team plays well, wins. 

He said the fact that Pakistan performed well against England and India did well against Sri Lanka is insignificant. 

It does not matter what you have done in the past. The series starts 0-0. Its irrelevant really. You can get confidence from it, and see positives. But once the match starts, it does not matter. It is really all about what you do on that particular day. 

Dravid said Indias last tour of Pakistan had been fantastic and the team has learnt that one has to play tough to win in the neighbouring country. 

He also said the morale of the Indian team was high after recent good performances. 

The last couple of months have been really good. There have been good performances from all the players.

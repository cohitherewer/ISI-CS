 Alonso grabs pole

Silverstone: Renaults world champion Fernando Alonso swept to his fourth pole position in a row with a last-gasp flying lap at the British Grand Prix on Saturday. 

The Spaniard, 21 points clear of Ferraris Michael Schumacher after seven of 18 races, will have McLarens Kimi Raikkonen alongside him. Four in a row boys, the 24-year-old champion whooped on the team radio as he crossed the line. 

He nearly spoke too soon, with Raikkonen nailing the other front row slot, and relegating seven-time champion Schumacher to third, with the chequered flag already out to end the session. Alonsos lap of 1:20.253 compared to Raikkonens 1:20.397 and Schumachers 1:20.574. 

The 37-year-old German, who caused uproar in Monaco two weeks ago when he impeded rivals by stopping on track, avoided further controversy to fill an all-Ferrari second row with Brazilian team mate Felipe Massa. 

Alonso had predicted another Renault-Ferrari duel on Friday but he changed his tune after seeing Raikkonen re-awaken McLarens hopes. McLaren can be a problem for us tomorrow, said the 24-year-old. 

Pole position is more and more important because we know how difficult it is to overtake in Formula One these days, added the Spaniard. (Reuters)

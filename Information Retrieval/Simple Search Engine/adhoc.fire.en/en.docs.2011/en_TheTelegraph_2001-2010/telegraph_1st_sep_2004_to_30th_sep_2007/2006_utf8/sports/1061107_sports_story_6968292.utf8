Madrid: Sevilla knocked Barcelona off the top of the Primera Liga after goals from Frederic Kanoute and Adriano Correia earned a 2-0 home win over Osasuna on Sunday. 

The Uefa Cup holders have 21 points, one ahead of Barca who were held to a 1-1 draw at Deportivo Coruna on Saturday. 

Real Zaragoza climbed to third on 19 points with a 3-1 home win over Getafe, and Real Madrid slipped to fourth on 17 after losing 2-1 at home to Celta Vigo. 

Sevillas Kanoute scored from the penalty spot early in the second half, taking his tally for the season to eight. Two minutes from time he fed Brazilian Adriano to finish a swift counter-attack and wrap up the win. 

Real Madrid failed to capitalise on Barcas slip-up as Fabio Capello suffered his first defeat at the Bernabeu in two spells as coach of the nine-time European champions. 

Capello gave Ronaldo his first start of the season but it was Celta who struck first. Nene put them in front after 36 minutes, but Real levelled just before the break when Emerson headed home from Rauls corner. 

Eight minutes from time, however, the visitors pounced on a stray pass from Jose Antonio Reyes and Angels cross to the edge of the area was swept inside the far post by Jorge for the winner. 

In Serie A action, AC Milan slumped to a third defeat in four matches when they lost 0-2 at Atalanta after second-half goals by Nicola Ventola and Andrea Soncin on Sunday. 

The result left Milan 16th with seven points from 10 matches, 17 points behind joint leaders Inter Milan and Palermo, who enjoyed 2-0 victories over Ascoli and Sampdoria respectively. 

AS Roma stayed third on 20 points after coming from behind to beat visitors Fiorentina 3-1. 

Milans failure to capitalise on good first-half possession was punished in the 50th minute, when home keeper Alex Calderoni pumped the ball upfield for Massimo Donati to nod on to Ventola, who volleyed crisply past Dida. 

Atalanta made sure of the points in the second minute of stoppage time, when Soncins shot deflected off Dario Simic into the net. 

Inter had few problems overcoming Ascoli. Zlatan Ibrahimovic created their opening goal just before halftime, when he dribbled into the area and cut the ball back to Hernan Crespo. 

The Argentine striker scuffed a weak shot goalwards but Inter captain Javier Zanetti was ready just inside the box to make sure it crossed the line. 

Eight minutes after the restart, Ascoli defender Mirko Cudini turned Luis Figos low cross into his own net to extend Inters lead. 

In England, substitute Marlon Harewood struck two minutes from time to hand West Ham United a 1-0 win over Arsenal as tempers flared at Upton Park, while Aston Villa beat Blackburn Rovers 2-0 at home. 

Harewood converted Matthew Etheringtons cross to secure a second successive league win for West Ham, who moved out of the bottom three and up to 15th.

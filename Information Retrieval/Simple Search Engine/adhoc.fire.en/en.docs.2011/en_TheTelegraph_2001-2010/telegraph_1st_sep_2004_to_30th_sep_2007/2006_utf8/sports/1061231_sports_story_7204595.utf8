 PCB doubts Wada jurisdiction

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has questioned the jurisdiction of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) in challenging the exoneration of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, saying it was an internal matter of the board. 

While confirming the receipt of a letter from CAS on the appeal filed by Wada against the lifting of bans on the fast bowlers, a PCB official maintained the board had done no wrong in clearing the duo. 

We have already sent our replies to the Wada. We have questioned their jurisdiction and right to take up a case which is purely an internal matter of the PCB, the official said. 

CAS, he said, had asked the board to send all documents so that it could take action on the Wada appeal. (PTI)

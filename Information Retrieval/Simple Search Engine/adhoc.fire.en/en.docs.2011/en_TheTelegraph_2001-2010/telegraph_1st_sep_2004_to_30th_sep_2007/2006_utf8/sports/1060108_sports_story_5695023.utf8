Chennai: Leander Paes got eliminated two nights ago, Mahesh Bhupathi was miles away from the action and yet, two Indians booked a Sunday date at the Chennai Open. And how! 

Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna literally escaped from the jaws of death to oust second seeds Rainer Schuettler and Alexander Waske 6-1, 3-6, 11-9. Down four match-points in the super tie-break, the wild cards stunned the Germans by reeling off six points on the trot to seal a memorable win. 

Such is the magical chemistry between the Nungambakkam Stadium and Indian doubles players. 

Paes and Bhupathi pioneered that trend in 1997, capturing the title in the inaugural year of the ATP event in this southern metropolis and repeated that performance in 1998, 1999 and 2002. 

Rank outsiders Prahlad Srinath and Saurav Panja surprised one and sundry by featuring in the 2000 final. 

On Saturday, it was Amritraj and Bopannas turn to add one more chapter to that glorious tradition. 

Wild cards Amritraj and Bopanna, who had whipped No. 3 seeds Yves Allegro and Michael Kohlmann in the first round, will on Sunday face Michal Mertinak (Slovakia) and Petr Pala (Czech Republic) who brushed aside Hyung-Taik Lee and Bjorn Phau 6-2, 6-1. 

The way Amritraj and Bopanna played in the first set, it didnt seem they were teaming up in a tournament for only the third time. 

They dominated an experienced pair which reached the Wimbledon quarter finals, breaking Waske and Schuettler once each to go a set up in 22 minutes. 

One loose service game by Amritraj cost the Indians the second set. The deciding tie-break also looked like going the German way as both Amritraj and Bopanna made a couple of errors at the net. 

The Indian turnaround started with a double-fault by Waske at 9-5. Three terrific points ? an Amritraj volley and two blinding service returns by Bopanna ? helped the underdogs pull ahead 10-9. 

And as Schuettler tamely drove a return into the net, Amritraj and Bopanna were celebrating the biggest moment in their career. 

We didnt think we were out of it even at 5-9, a couple of points and we were back in the hunt, said Amritraj. 

The two biggest points were at 8-9 and 9-9 when we managed to get everything right. 

Bopanna said if they could reproduce the level of tennis they showed in the first set of both matches here, they had a good chance on Sunday. 

They (Mertinak and Pala) are a good team, but I think we have an even chance of winning the final, Bopanna said.

Calcutta: First the bad news. Sania Mirza is in world No. 9 Martina Hingis half. The good news, however, is that the Indian ace wont meet her celebrated Swiss rival before the semi-finals of the $175,000 WTA Sunfeast Open. Of course, both women have to win three matches each to set up a showdown at the Netaji Indoor Stadium. 

The draw, which took place at 4 pm on Saturday, wasnt unkind to Sania. The Indian, who is on a downhill journey which has pushed her ranking to 70, will kick off against a qualifier. 

Sania, who of late has been going to town saying she doesnt believe in rankings, will face her first big test in the quarter finals against fourth seed Aravane Rezai. The French girl of Iranian descent had a good run at the US Open, while Sania got knocked out in Round 2. 

The Swiss Miss was drawn to open against Hungarian Melinda Czink, who broke Indian hearts last year by ousting Sania. Czink is unseeded here, but her current ranking (No. 84) is misleading because the Hungarian, on her day, can prove a handful for anyone. The top seeds possible quarter-final foe will be No. 6 Kaia Kanepi of Estonia. 

 Croatian Karolina Sprem, ranked No. 50 and seeded 

 No. 2 here, has a relatively easy draw till the quarter 

 finals, where she could face Anastassia Rodionova of Russia. 

 Third seed Yuliana Fedak, too, shouldnt have a problem 

 till the quarters, where she may draw the unpredictable 

 Australian, seventh seed Nicole Pratt.

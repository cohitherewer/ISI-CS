Mumbai: India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be rested for the final one-dayer against England to be played in Indore on Saturday. 

Dhoni, who made a valiant 96 in the sixth one-dayer in Jamshedpur on Wednesday, has been replaced by K. Dinesh Karthik, a former regular in the Test side. 

It will be the first one-dayer that Dhoni will miss since his debut in Bangladesh in December 2004. 

Rahul Dravid, who was rested for two matches, returns to lead the team. Ajit Agarkar has been dropped. 

The hosts are 4-1 up in the series, with the fifth game washed out.

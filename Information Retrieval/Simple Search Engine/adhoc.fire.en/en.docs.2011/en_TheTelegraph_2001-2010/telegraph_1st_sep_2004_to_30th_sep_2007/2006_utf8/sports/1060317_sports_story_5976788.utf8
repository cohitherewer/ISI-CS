The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jaiswals pull off priced double 

 STAR RACER

 Trainer Vikash Jaiswal leading in Sovereign 

 Music (Afzal-up)

Calcutta: Trainers, Tarak 

 Nath and his son Vikash reeled off a priced double while 

 making a clean sweep of the two trophy events in Thursdays 

 race card. If father was lucky to see his ward Pipsqueak 

 winning the Arisen Cup, the son pulled off a master gamble 

 on Sovereign Music in the Sabre Dance Cup.

 In the Arisen Cup, favourite Local Thriller was taken miles wide by Grand Ceremony at the final turn. The former, a Javed Khan-trainee, however, covered much ground in the stretch-run but fell short by half-a-length at the wire. Sovereign Music, on the other hand, shot into a distance lead from the start to return a facile winner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are outsiders now, says Robson

[+uc('DAVID BOND 

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH')+]

Sir Bobby Robson added to the gloom surrounding Englands World Cup hopes on Sunday when he wrote off Sven-Goran Erikssons side as outsiders following the devastating news of Wayne Rooneys injury. 

Rooney broke the fourth metatarsal bone in his right foot during Manchester Uniteds 3-0 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . He will be out for at least six weeks and is certain to miss Englands opening group game against Paraguay on June 10. 

Former England manager Robson said: The news about Wayne is depressingly sad. Without him weve gone from possible World Cup winners to outsiders. You cant replace Rooney. I dont think theres another player like him in the country or in Europe. 

People who win World Cups are top individuals. Who won the World Cup for Argentina in 1986? Ill tell you ? it was Diego Maradona. 

But Robson insisted Rooney must be taken to Germany if there was a chance he might be fit for the knockout phase. 

He added: If hes playing within six weeks, then you take him. We have enough quality to beat the teams well face in the group matches without him. What you need is your top players for the quarters, semis and final.

 Consolation victory for India

Faisalabad: A late resurgence helped India register a 2-1 win over Pakistan in the fifth match of the bilateral hockey series on Friday. With their maiden win after three home losses and a draw, the visitors managed to close the series score to 3-1. 

The Indians were in control of proceedings as the hosts were guilty of an insipid performance. Despite adopting a cautious approach, the Indians looked the better side in terms of co-ordination and ball possession. 

Imran Warsi drew first blood for Pakistan in the 28th minute by converting a penalty corner. India came roaring back in the final 15 minutes with Rajpal Singh (55th) and Kanwalpreet Singh (61st) shooting home to earn a morale-boosting victory.

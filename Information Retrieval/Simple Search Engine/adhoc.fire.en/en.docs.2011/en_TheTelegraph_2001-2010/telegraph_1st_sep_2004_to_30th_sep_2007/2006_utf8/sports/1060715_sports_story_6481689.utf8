 Cincinnati to mark Serena return

New York: Serena Williams will make her return to competitive tennis following a lengthy injury layoff in Cincinnati next week, saying she hopes to blow the joint up, and return to the top of the world rankings. 

Sidelined with a chronic left knee injury, Williams has seen her ranking slip to 140, but the ex-world No. 1 is confident she can again become a dominating force on the WTA Tour. 

I definitely think so, if I didnt I wouldnt be trying to play, Williams said during a tele-conference on Thursday. There is definitely some potential there. 

I hope to get a lot of satisfaction out of my game. I hope to go out there and blow the joint up. 

Williams, however, was making no predictions for her comeback next week at the low-key $175,000 Tier III hard court event in Cincinnati. 

The seven-time Grand Slam winner has played just three matches this year, posting a record of 2-1, and has not seen any action since a third-round loss to Slovakias Daniela Hantuchova at the Australian Open in January. 

I am really excited to just get out there and do my thing, said Williams. I hope Im in good shape. 

My goals, Ive always never said them out loud. I just expect to do what I do best and I think I play tennis best. And its what I like to do best as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Emotions ran high on the track 

 STAR RACER

 Mumbai: Trainer Vinayak spoiled his fellow-professionals ? S. Padmanabhan and S. Ganapathys ? party, and he had done in the past, too, when his another longshot, Noble Eagle, won him the Derby two seasons ago. 

 The trainer now has three Derby wins to his credit, Indictment being his first winner, nearly a decade ago. Vinayak, though very excited, was totally dumb stuck when asked for his instant reaction seconds after winning the Derby. I really dont know what to say. You can write it, said Vinayak.

 Emotions ran high during the lead-in of Velvet Rope on the track. The part-owner Shiven Surendranath and party had finished the photo session and were on their way back to the stands when wife, Aditi, was spotted running and panting. A long hug between the man and wife kept the horse and jockey waiting. The security team, too, insisted on clearing the track but mellowed down on a plea from the lady that she may not ever win the Derby again. 

 Rajan Bajaj, the other part-owner of the winner, was not present in the city. Fate had delivered him a cruel blow as his wife died on Friday in a car accident.

 Mysticals owner, MAM Ramaswamy, has always been a man of few words. Asked for his reaction on the outcome of the Derby, he said: Its a sport. The better horse on the day won. Asked about the next target of Mystical, the racing baron said: The Invitation Cup, of course.

 The Derby day crowd was massive, almost double the number, 32,000 compared to Saturdays 17,000. Long queues were witnessed at the totalisator windows and the bookmakers area was crammed for space.

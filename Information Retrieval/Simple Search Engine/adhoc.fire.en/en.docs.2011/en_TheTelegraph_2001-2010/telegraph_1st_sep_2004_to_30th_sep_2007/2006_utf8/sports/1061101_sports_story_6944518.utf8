 SHARP SINGLES 

 Bravo apology

 Jaipur: Dwayne Bravo said he apologised to Michael Yardy immediately after realising that he had claimed the catch on a half-volley in their last league match of the ICC Champions Trophy in Ahmedabad. I thought I had it (the catch) clean, but after coming back to the dressing room and seeing the replay I saw the ball bounced before it got to my hands, Bravo said. I immediately went to the England dressing room and apologised to Yardy, he was quoted as saying on the WICBs official website. 

We care about ODIs: Graveney 

London: England do place an equal priority upon ODIs as they do Tests, ECB chairman of selectors David Graveney has insisted. England great Geoffrey Boycott said results proved what little the current team thought of one-day cricket. But Graveney said: Nobody is sitting on their hands and not rating one-day cricket as important as Test cricket. For me, it is equally important.

E-tickets

Jaipur: A state-of-the-art ticketing technology which aims at checking counterfeiting and ensures fast, hassle-free access to the stadium will be deployed for the semi-final between South Africa and the West Indies on Thursday.

 Dunga is Brazil coach

 - I want to bring the same determination I had as a player 

 Rio de Janeiro: Former 

 Brazil midfielder and captain Dunga was surprisingly named 

 as the countrys new national team coach on Monday.

 The 42-year-old, with no previous 

 coaching experience, replaced Carlos Alberto Parreira, who 

 resigned last Wednesday following Brazils disappointing 

 performance at the World Cup. The five-time champions were 

 surprisingly knocked out in the quarter-finals by France 

 after beginning the tournament in Germany as hot favourites.

 The Brazilian Football Confederation 

 (CBF) said on its official website that Dunga agreed terms 

 after a two-hour meeting with its president Ricardo Teixeira.

 The CBF did not say how long Dunga 

 would be in charge but he said his appointment was part 

 of a restructuring of the national team set-up that had 

 the 2010 and 2014 World Cups as targets.

 The midfielder, famous for his 

 fighting spirit, captained the Brazil team that won the 

 1994 World Cup and wore the armband again four years later 

 when they were runners-up to France. He was also in the 

 1990 team.

 I want to bring the same 

 determination I had as a player, Dunga told the CBFs 

 website.

 Motivation and will to win 

 are fundamental for anyone who wants to wear the shirt of 

 the Brazilian national team.

 The favourites to replace Parreira 

 had been ex-Real Madrid coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo and former 

 Peru coach Paulo Autuori.

 First-choice Luiz Felipe Scolari, 

 who led Brazil to the 2002 world title, preferred to stay 

 with Portugal until 2008.

 Dungas first game in charge 

 will be a friendly against Norway in Oslo on August 16. 

 Brazil are not due to play any competitive games until next 

 years Copa America in Venezuela.

 Dunga faces a tough rebuilding 

 job and one of his first decisions will be the international 

 future of forward Ronaldo, who looked out of sorts at the 

 World Cup. 

 It is believed that Brazil took 

 a leaf out of Germanys book by putting a man with 

 no previous coaching experience in charge of their national 

 side.

 Juergen Klinsmanns success 

 at leading Germany to third place in the World Cup, two 

 years after a humiliating first-round exit in Euro 2004, 

 has inspired the five-time world champions to put the untested 

 Dunga into the hot seat. It is Brazils second such 

 experiment in recent times and Dunga will be hoping to fare 

 better than Paulo Roberto Falcao who lasted one unhappy 

 year in 1990-91.

 Parreiras reliance on his 

 ageing group effectively turned the national team into a 

 closed shop in the last 18 months, barring the way to the 

 countrys up-and-coming talent.

 Many of the players who looked 

 promising one year ago have since departed Brazil, disappearing 

 into relative obscurity with middle-ranking European clubs.

 Dunga experienced both the joy 

 and pain of representing the worlds most successful 

 international team during his playing days. In 1990, he 

 was made the scapegoat after Brazil crashed out of the World 

 Cup in Italy in the second round.

 It became known as the Dunga 

 Era after commentators accused Brazil of replacing 

 their traditional flair with the hard-tackling approach 

 symbolised by Dunga. 

 ALL ABOUT THE 

 MAN IN THE HOT SEAT 

 Real name Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri. His nickname 

 is the Portuguese translation of the Dopey character in 

 the film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

 He was made the scapegoat after Brazil were knocked 

 out of the 1990 World Cup in the second round by Argentina. 

 It was known as the Dunga Era, supposedly 

 because Brazil replaced traditional flair with the hard-tackling 

 game he symbolised.

 Four years later, he returned in style to captain the 

 team that won Brazils fourth World Cup.

 Dunga also led Brazil at his third World Cup in 1998 

 but this time the adventure ended in disappointment as 

 they lost 0-3 to France in the final, his last international. 

 By this time, however, Dunga was recognised as a tackler, 

 distributor of the ball and inspirational leader.

 He returned to Internacional in 1999, the club where 

 he started his career, and despite being dropped several 

 times by coach Emerson Leao, scored the goal that saved 

 them from relegation.

 Dunga also played in the Brazil team that won the Copa 

 America in 1999.

 His club career also took him to Italy, Germany and 

 Japan.

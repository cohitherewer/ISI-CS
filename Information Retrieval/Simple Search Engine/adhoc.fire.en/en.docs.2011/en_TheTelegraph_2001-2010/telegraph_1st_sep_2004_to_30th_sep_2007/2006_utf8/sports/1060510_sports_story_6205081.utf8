 Ibrahimovic, Larsson among six strikers

Stockholm: Juventus Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Barcelonas Henrik Larsson were named among the six strikers in Swedens World Cup squad on Tuesday while right back Alexander Ostlund was dropped in a defensive shake-up. 

Ostlund, who plays for Southampton, was heavily criticised after Sweden lost 0-3 to Ireland in a friendly match in March. 

Lars Lagerback brought in IFK Gothenburgs Karl Svensson and Fredrik Stenman who has had a strong first season with Bayer Leverkusen but never played for Sweden. 

Another surprise was Fredriksborgs Rami Shaaban as one of three goalkeepers, with Eddie Gustafsson of Ham-Kam left out. 

Shaaban played three games for Arsenal in 2002 before breaking his leg during training later that year and he never played for the London side again.

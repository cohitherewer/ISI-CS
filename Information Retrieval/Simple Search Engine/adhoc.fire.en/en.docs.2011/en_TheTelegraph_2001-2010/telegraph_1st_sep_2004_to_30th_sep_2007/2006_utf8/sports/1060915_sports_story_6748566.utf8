 Prasanta is a satisfied man 

Faridabad: On Thursday morning, rain ensured no match. When it was finally played in the evening, the match proved to be a total mismatch. 

Bengal, who have come here with a near third string team, looked as formidable as ever as they massacred Rajasthan 8-1 in Cluster III of the Santosh Trophy opener at the makeshift venue of the Nahar Singh Stadium here on Thursday. The 29-time champions could have added many more but a slushy ground condition and some good saves by custodian Sunil Prasad came to Rajasthans rescue. 

While the team management at the Bengal bench heaved a sigh of relief after watching their bunch of mostly untested youngsters dish out a creditable show in the tournament opener, one was pained to see the dipping standard of football in the state of Rajasthan. Watching Rajasthan footballers play who looked nothing more than a group of part timers one would have never imagined that this state had once produced players like Magan Singh and Chain Singh and a great side like RAC from Bikaner. 

But that can not take the credit away from Bengal players, especially Vimal Pariyar. The 20-year-old boy scored four goals, including a hattrick and once again proved that he has been receiving a raw deal from the national coaches. He did a fine job with the senior national team in the tour of Fiji, but never got a call thereafter. Now, the under-20 team coach Islam Akhmedov also expressed his disappointment over Pariyars performance in the recent SAF Games. 

On Thursday, however, the Tata Football Academy pass-out was in fine nick. Out of his four goals, two were delightful strikes. The one he headed in nine minutes after half time was perfectly timed and was the result of a good spot jump. Ten minutes later, he flicked in a goal off a Ratan Das cross from the right. It was not easy to execute on a slippery ground. 

The match was scheduled for 8.30am, but could not be played on a waterlogged ground at Sector 12 Stadium after heavy rain in the morning. The organisers shifted the match to an open ground at the Nahar Singh Stadium. It could only be started at 3.30pm. 

The change in venue and time and the prevailing confusion did not affect Bengals performance. They started with a bang to race to a 3-0 lead by the 26th minute and led 5-1 at the breather. Sasthi Duley opened the scoring when he made most of a defensive lapse. His goal was followed by one from Suman Dutta and a double striker by Tarif Ahmed. Shakir Ahmed pulled one back for Rajasthan with a rising shot that had Sandeep Nandy stranded. 

In Cluster II, Haryana beat Pondicherry 3-0 at Gurgaon. Habeeb Khan, Sunit Mishra and Praveen Arora were the scorers.

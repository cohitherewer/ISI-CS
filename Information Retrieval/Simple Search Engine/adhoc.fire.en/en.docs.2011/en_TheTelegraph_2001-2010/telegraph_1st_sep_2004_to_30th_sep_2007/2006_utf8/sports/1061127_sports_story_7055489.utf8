 WI to go all out to stop Yousuf

Karachi: West Indies will play positively against Pakistan in the third and final Test to stop Mohammed Yousuf from breaking Vivian Richards 30-year-old record for the highest number of runs scored in a calendar year. 

Yousuf, who made 193, 56 and 191 in the first two Tests, is 149 runs short of breaking Richards record of 1710 runs in 11 matches in 1976. 

He has already equalled the record of Richards and Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silva in making seven hundreds this year. 

We know Yousuf is challenging this record and hes been batting very well, West Indies skipper Brian Lara said on Sunday. But we will be doing our homework and would like Viv Richards to continue holding the most runs in a calendar year and we will be coming really hard at them, he said. 

We are very optimistic about our chances in this Test. We need a very good plan for every single batsmen to nullify the impact they have, particularly Yousuf, said Lara. 

Yousuf, who has scored 1562 runs this year, said he would be happy to break the record, but he was more interested in contributing towards a team win.

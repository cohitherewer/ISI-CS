 No need to panic, says Flintoff

 - England crash to 166-run loss in opener

Canberra: There is no reason for England to panic after an embarrassing 166-run loss to the PMs XI in Fridays tour-opener, captain Andrew Flintoff said. 

The tourists have been in a prolonged slump since their epic series win over Australia last year and Fridays defeat was not the sort of performance to instantly restore confidence with the first Ashes Test starting in just 13 days. 

Flintoff, however, put on a brave face. 

Were not going to get too despondent about it, he said. We know we have to improve and well do that before the first Test in Brisbane. Weve had a defeat today but it doesnt turn us into a bad side. 

The PMs XI, a scratch team made up of fringe Test players, demolished Englands wayward bowlers to pile on 347 for five from their 50 overs with opener Phil Jaques blasting a century. 

Englands reply was a modest 181 with the innings coming to an abrupt end in the 39th over. Only Andrew Strauss (67) and Paul Collingwood (35) made meaningful contributions with the bat. 

Flintoff, clean bowled by Shaun Tait for one after conceding 55 runs from his 10 overs, said it was clear his team needed to quickly improve but was confident they would. 

Weve still got talented players and weve got to express ourselves in the weeks to come, he said. 

While Fridays was only a warm-up game, there were still a number of worrying signs for the English with just two more practice games before the Test series. 

Their bowling was loose and fielding sloppy, while the top-order batsmen wasted the chance for some much-needed practice on a pitch that was tailor-made for heavy scoring. 

The only encouraging signs were the batting of Strauss and the successful return from injury of left-arm spinner Ashley Giles. 

From my own personal point, I was pleased with my 10 overs, Flintoff said. I started well, bowled three spells, came back strong and the body felt good and the ankles pulled up nicely. 

Giles, playing his first match in almost a year, claimed a wicket in the first of his eight overs but went for 53 as the young Australians punished all the England bowlers, particularly Sajid Mahmood who conceded 97 from his nine overs. 

Jaques was the main destroyer, smashing 112 off 110 balls to get the innings off to a flying start before Shaun Marsh, the son of former Test batsman Geoff, cracked an unbeaten 78 at the end to ensure his team posted an imposing total. 

Englands chances of winning the match disappeared almost as soon as their innings started with Marcus Trescothick (1) falling to Tait in the first over, and then Alastair Cook (4), Kevin Pietersen (7) and Flintoff (1) all departing cheaply.

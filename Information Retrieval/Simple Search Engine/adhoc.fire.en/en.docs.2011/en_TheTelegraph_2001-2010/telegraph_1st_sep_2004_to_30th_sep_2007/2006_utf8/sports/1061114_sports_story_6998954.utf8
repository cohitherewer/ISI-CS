New Delhi: A few hours after the Indian footballers left for Yemen to play the concluding Asian Cup qualifier, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Monday has decided to send in midfielder Climax Lawrence to join the squad in Dubai. 

The Indian team, after playing against Yemen, will go to Dubai to play a couple of practice matches before proceeding to Doha for the Asian Games. Lawrence has been directed to join the squad in Dubai on Thursday. 

It may be recalled that Lawrence joined the national camp in Goa only for the last two days and was not considered for the Yemen-bound team. 

According to AIFF sources, the Dempo midfielder has been called in for the Dubai trip since defender Deepak Mondal will return to India after the Yemen match (on Wednesday). The Mohun Bagan defender, who is getting married on November 23, is supposed to join back the squad in Doha on November 27. In case Mondal fails to make the trip back, there is a strong possibility that Lawrence could be inducted into the squad as one of the three senior (over-23) players. 

At the moment, Mondal, along with skipper Bhaichung Bhutia and goalkeeper Sandip Nandy are the three over-23 footballers in the squad. 

The chief coach, Bob Houghton, however, is hopeful that his relatively inexperienced bunch of players will produce good football in Doha. Speaking to The Telegraph a few hours before the squads departure from Mumbai, Houghton said his side stands a good chance of qualifying for the quarter finals. 

This team has quite a few newcomers, said Houghton. Some of them like Gourmangi Singh, Bungo Singh and Tarif Ahmed have talent, skills and the required heights to play in international matches. 

The British coach said a little more time would have helped him in preparing the team better for the Asian Games. The camp should have been held at least three weeks before. But the domestic engagements here is so pressing that I didnt get time to train the boys for a longer period. 

In Asian Games, 24 teams have been equally divided into six groups. The other three teams in Indias group are Hong Kong, the Maldives and defending champions Iran. While six group winners will make the quarter final round, two best losers from six groups will complete the last eight line-up. 

Houghton admitted that India have slim chances of emerging as group winners. Iran won the gold medal in the last two Asian Games. They are in line for a hattrick and likely to field a strong side, the Indian coach said. But we too have a chance to make it if we do well against Hong Kong and the Maldives. 

The opening match against Hong Kong on November 29, according to Houghton, will be the most important. We need six points from the first two matches and then only we can plan our strategies against Iran.

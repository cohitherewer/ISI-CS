The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Testing time for coaches Mhambrey and Pandit

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its Christmas but for Paras Mhambrey and Chandrakant Pandit the two Mumbaikars, now coaching rival camps Bengal and Maharashtra, respectively its no time to make merry. Rather, its redemption time for the two coaches. 

Heading for their crucial Round IV Ranji Super League encounter at Eden Gardens from Monday, both teams cant take it easy. Neck and neck at six and five points, respectively, in the Group B ladder led by Hyderabad with eight points Bengal and Maharashtra in fact should find themselves in the same boat. A win can definitely change the equation. 

Consider the journey so far: Bengal began on a high (with an outright win against Punjab), though with Sourav Gangulys presence. 

Maharashtra, on the other hand, took some time to settle down (conceding two points against a VVS Laxman-inspired Hyderabad in a drawn tie). Then in Round II, Bengal snatched two points (with double century from C.K. Nayudu-winning skipper Manoj Tewari and century from Abhishek Jhunjhunwala) from once-champions Mumbai, while Maharashtra came into the limelight with a bonus point win over Rajasthan (with centuries from Dheeraj Jadhav, Tamil Nadu-recruit S. Sriram and 97 from Hrishikesh Kanitkar). 

However, it was a reality check in the next round with both teams giving away two easy points. 

It was time to look back (and ahead), if the match-eve practice session-cum-team selection on Sunday was any indication. 

Bengal selectors brought in under-22 seamer Sourav Sarkar who had an excellent run in the C.K. Nayudu Trophy, claiming 30 wickets in place of Eklak Ahmed. The reason: Being a natural in-swinger he (Sourav) could be effective against the visitors who boast of five southpaws said chief selector Arup Bhattacharya. If played, Sourav will make his Ranji debut for Bengal. 

At the other side, Maharashtras chief selector Pandurang Salgaonkar indicated that they may give a chance to Mansingh Nigde (untested so far in this Ranji season). 

We have dropped middle order batsman (Nikhil) Paradkar and seamer (Aditya) Dole and replaced them with Pratik Desai and Prashant Bhoir. Out of the three, any two will get a chance on Monday, he told The Telegraph. 

Maharashtras regular opener Harshad Khadiwale, it may be noted, is yet to fire with scores of 40 (versus Hyderabad), 23 (Rajasthan) and 5 (Punjab), while his partner Dheeraj Jadhav is a study in contrast with scores of 66, 171 and 72 in those matches. But, Khadiwale doubles up as a seam bowler, Salgaonkar added. 

Salgaonkar, by the way, is Maharashtras team manager a so-called Australian theory inducted when Darren Holder was at the helm last season. 

Though Bengal had prevailed over Punjab whereas Maharashtra have found them difficult to handle, both the coaches feel its time to start afresh. 

You win some and lose some, youve to start it afresh learning from mistakes, said Mhambrey. 

The wicket, according to him, with grass rolled on it wont be that bouncy as expected. As a matter of fact, this is the same wicket used for the Bengal-Punjab match. 

For the visitors, their biggest plus point, unlike last season, has been their batting with the old guns firing on all cylinders something even Mhambrey concedes: Batting is their main advantage weve to be watchful. 

If opener Dheeraj has been consistent as ever, the middle-order (Kanitkar, Sriram and Yogesh Takawale) has not let the team down. Skipper Sairaj Bahutule, too, has contributed with his all-round performances. 

But, those were all at homeBy the way, the Eden match will be Maharashtras first away match of the season.

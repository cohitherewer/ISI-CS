 Zaheer Abbas blames it on PCB politics

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas feels that his contract as team manager after the England series has not been extended owing to politics within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and not because of what happened during the infamous Oval Test. 

The reason my contract was not renewed (had) nothing to do with what happened at The Oval, its because (PCB director of operations) Saleem Altaf was totally against me and for no rhyme or reason, Abbas was quoted as saying in a daily newspaper on Monday. 

He had wanted to make Talat Ali manager for so long and he saw this as the right time to make the change. 

This came so suddenly, though I knew that the change would happen one day because a team manager is appointed on a tour by tour basis, the former Test captain added. 

Earlier, reports had claimed said Abbas was discontinued as a manager for his handling of the proceedings in The Oval Test against England last month. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq was subsequently charged with ball tampering and bringing the game to disrepute. 

Abbas was seen talking on his mobile phone in the players balcony while the team and coach Bob Woolmer were dealing with Hairs decision to penalise the team five runs on the fourth day of the match.

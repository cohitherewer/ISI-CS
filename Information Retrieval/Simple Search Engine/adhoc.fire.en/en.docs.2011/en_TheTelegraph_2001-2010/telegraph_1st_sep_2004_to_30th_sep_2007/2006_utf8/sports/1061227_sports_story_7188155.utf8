 Gurgaon to host Calcutta leg

 NATIONAL LEAGUE 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has chosen the Devi Lal Sports Complex in Gurgaon as the alternative venue for Calcutta s Salt Lake Stadium to host matches in the first four rounds of the National Football League (NFL) beginning on January 5. 

According to federation sources, Gurgaon became the latest addition to the NFL map after IFA expressed its inability to host home matches of the Calcutta teams at the Salt Lake Stadium for various reasons. Now all the three Calcutta teams will have to play their home matches till January 23 either in Delhi or Gurgaon. 

While Delhi will play host to the NFL opener between Mohammedan Sporting and JCT on January 5, the focus then will shift to Gurgaon. The Haryana township, which recently hosted the Santosh Trophy, may be asked to stage four matches East Bengal versus Mohammedan Sporting (January 18), Mohun Bagan versus Air India (January 20), East Bengal versus Churchill Brothers (January 21) and Mohammedan Sporting versus HAL (January 22). 

Haryana Football Association secretary Sunil Bhardwaj said the AIFF has asked him whether the ground and other facilities at the Devi Lal Sports Complex would be available between January 17 and 23 for hosting NFL matches. We have written to the federation indicating all arrangements could be made for NFL matches. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said he would release the final draw for the first four rounds on December 30. He, however, refused to confirm whether Gurgaon would be given the responsibility of staging some matches. 

The following is the NFL draw for the Calcutta teams (four rounds): 

Round I Jan. 7: JCT vs Md. Sp. (Delhi ); HAL vs Mohun Bagan (Bangalore ), Air India vs East Bengal (Mumbai). Round II Jan. 11: HAL vs East Bengal (Bangalore ); JCT vs Mohun Bagan ( Ludhiana ). Jan. 12: Dempo vs Mohammedan Sporting (Mapusa, Goa ). Round III Jan. 15: Mahindra United vs Mohun Bagan (Mumbai). Jan. 18: Mohammedan Sporting vs East Bengal (Calcutta ). Round IV Jan. 20: Mohun Bagan vs Air India (Gurgaon). Jan. 21: East Bengal vs Churchill Brothers (Gurgaon). Jan. 22: Md. Sp. vs HAL (Gurgaon).

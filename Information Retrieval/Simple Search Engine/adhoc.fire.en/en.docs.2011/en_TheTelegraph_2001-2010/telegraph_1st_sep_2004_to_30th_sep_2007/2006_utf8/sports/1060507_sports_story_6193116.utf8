 Hidalgo yet to quote price, not in list

 - NATIONAL COACH AIFF names 11 candidates 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF has named a list of 11 from which the next Indian coach will be chosen. The legendary Michel Hidalgo is the most prominent name missing from that list. 

According to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, the list ? which includes some top European coaches like Ian Porterfield, Brian Kerr, Bob Houghton and Clemence Westerhof ? has been sent to the technical committee members along with the detailed resume of each applicant. 

Each technical committee member has been asked to choose six names on preferential basis by the end of next week, Colaco told The Telegraph. After receiving the members recommendations, we will call five-six coaches for interviews which may be held on May 24 and 25. 

Asked why Hidalgo, the most well-known name among the 70-odd applicants, was not in the list of 11, Colaco said he was still awaiting communication from the Frenchman. Initially, Hidalgos agent had been writing to us quite frequently. We wrote back enquiring about his exact demands, but are yet to receive a reply. We had to release this list since we cannot wait indefinitely. 

Colaco did, however, say that Hidalgo ? who guided the Platini-led France to the Euro 1984 title ? could still be called if the AIFF hears from his agent in the next few days. There cannot be a deadline for a man of Hidalgos stature. The only relevant thing is, we hope he quotes a price that fits into our budget. 

Colaco said while the financial factor was one of the criteria for naming the 11, reputation and background of all were also carefully scrutinised as well. 

The likes of Englands Bob Houghton (former national coach of China and Uzbekistan), Colwyn Rowe (former technical director of England Youth teams), Clemence Westerhof (former PSV Eindhoven coach), Ian Porterfield (former Chelsea coach) and Brian Kerr (former Republic of Ireland coach) are known for their coaching prowess. 

The new national coach is supposed to take charge in June. Indias next campaign is a four-nation tournament in Canada for which the camp is likely to begin on June 15.

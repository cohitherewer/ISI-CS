 Sharapova loses suit

Miami: A federal judge ruled against tennis 

 star Maria Sharapova on Wednesday, saying a Florida production 

 company was entitled to market a documentary on her, despite 

 her agents attempts to halt distribution. 

 US district judge Donald Middlebrooks said Byzantium 

 Productions Inc. was lawful in its production of two films, 

 Annas Army and Russian Womens Tennis. 

 The documentaries did not violate trademark laws, the judge 

 found. 

Jonathan Koch, a Tampa attorney representing Sharapova, said he initially believed there was potential for confusion among consumers that the films were official documentaries. As the litigation progressed, though, he said he changed his mind. 

As we investigated and the controversy developed we concluded that the commercial significance of the matter did not justify being involved in a lawsuit, Koch said. 

 The decision means Byzantium, a two-man operation 

 in West Palm Beach, can move forward with plans to distribute 

 its work in Japan and elsewhere, though the filmmakers said 

 the damage had already been done. (AP)

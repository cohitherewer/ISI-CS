The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Patel makes cut

 - 1st 3 ODIs 

 - Gambhir, Rao among XV 

 Munaf Patel 

Mumbai: Mediumpacer Munaf Patel was on Tuesday rewarded for his fine bowling in the Test series and included in the squad for the first three ODIs versus England. 

[That he was tipped to get a berth in the ODI squad was reported by The Telegraph in Tuesdays edition.] 

Sachin Tendulkar was ruled out of the entire seven-match series due to a shoulder injury for which he will undergo a surgery in London. 

Despite an experienced player like Sachin being unavailable, Sourav Gangulys name was not discussed in the meeting and the inexperienced Venugopal Rao named as the maestros replacement in the 15-member squad. 

Gautam Gambhir, who was axed from the Test party, regained his place. Besides Sachin, Zaheer Khan and Murali Kartik are the ones from the 16-man ODI squad which did duty in Pakistan to have missed out. Rao and Munaf have been included. 

Gambhir was selected because he did well in the Deodhar Trophy and the three-day game in Vadodara, so we decided to give him another chance, chairman of selectors Kiran More said. 

On omitting Zaheer Khan, More said, He was not up to the mark in the Pakistan series. 

He (Kartik) got his left shoulder operated in Australia and would be out of cricket for four months. 

Off-spinner Ramesh Powar, who was flown in to replace Harbhajan Singh in Pakistan, took the left-arm spinners place. Sehwag, who was suffering from a back spasm in the ongoing third and final Test, has been named.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paes to play in Doha, not Chennai

 - Bhupathi picks Stepanek as Slam partner 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi will be back after a one-year hiatus, but Leander Paes wont be there at the Chennai Open beginning on New Years Day. 

Paes has opted to play in Doha, one of the two other events which will kick off the 2007 ATP season. 

My partner (Martin Damm) will be playing in Doha, so I have decided to enter that event, Paes told The Telegraph from Mumbai. We did very well at the Australian Open last year, reaching the final in our maiden event Its important to prepare well and have two tournaments with Martin before going to Melbourne. 

Paes decision may have nothing to do with Bhupathi playing in Chennai this time, but its good the two warring stars wont be together at their home event. No well-wisher of Indian tennis would want a repeat of what happened in Doha earlier this month. 

Neither Paes nor Bhupathi wants to add another word on the Doha episode, but who doesnt know that there are enough people to provoke them to a fresh round of fireworks! 

That Paes is extremely serious about doing well at the Australian Open comes through from his decision to skip mixed doubles at the years first Grand Slam. 

Ive played too much tennis just want to concentrate on mens doubles this time, Paes explained. 

Bhupathi had skipped the 2006 Chennai Open as his partner Wesley Moodie wasnt granted a doubles wild card. 

Im playing Chennai this time with Simon Aspelin, Bhupathi said from London, where he is training to get in shape for 2007. 

Bhupathi, whose fitness was questioned by Paes in Doha, said he was feeling good. I have been working out daily with my coach (Robbie Koenig), who is based in London Feeling quite good and looking forward to 2007, said Bhupathi. 

He will have different partners for the first two weeks Swede Aspelin in Chennai and Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in Sydney. Come the Australian Open, Bhupathi will pair up with Czech Radek Stepanek. 

Ill be playing the Grand Slams and the other big events with Stepanek, said Bhupathi. 

The Indian had a rough time with getting good partners after falling out with Moodie in May, resulting in a sharp drop in form and ranking. He hopes to turn the tide with Stepanek, better known as Martina Hingis boyfriend.

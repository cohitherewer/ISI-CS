Potchefstroom: Another surrender by Indias top-order took the joy out of the good work on the field on the second day of their tour match against Rest of South Africa here Friday. 

Openers Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer and Sachin Tendulkar, in particular, did little to ease the creases on the forehead of the team management as the Indians tumbled to 93 for seven in their second essay at the Sedgars Park. 

The abject surrender by the batsmen came after the bowlers had shot out the hosts for 138 in the first innings and given the visitors a 178-run advantage. 

Sehwag (10), Jaffer (0) and Tendulkar (12) continued with their sorry ways on the tour and even though the lead had swelled to 271 by close, the scoreboard brought very little cheers in the dressing room. 

Their dismissals reflected the form they are in: Jaffer and Sehwag showed no movement of feet as they came a cropper against the new ball. And Tendulkar, keen to grind out a long stay at the crease, fell leg before to a delivery which swung in and hit him in front of the stumps. 

First innings hero Sourav Ganguly lasted a mere two balls, both bouncers, but the second more lethal as it climbed on to him and looped off his bat to wicketkeeper Van Jaarsveld for a simple catch. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni was no different to what has been his dismal show of the tour, making 16 sketchy runs before edging Alfonso Thomas to second slip. 

Harbhajan Singh became Albert Thomas fifth victim before bad light brought a premature end to the days proceedings. 

Earlier, Sreesanth scalped four and was well-supported by Zaheer Khan and VRV Singh as the tourists bundled out the hosts for 138. But as the rest of the day unfolded, the joy was short-lived. 

Both Sehwag and Jaffer were dismissed by swing bowler Thomas. Jaffer had come out to bat with a runner, Harbhajan Singh. 

Jaffer was apparently hit on his left foot during practice Thursday and did not field this morning. Gautam Gambhir fielded in his place. 

Jaffer was the first one to leave when he fell leg before to Thomas and Sehwag departed in similar fashion two overs later. 

India now have a real concern at hand since Sehwag and Jaffer have been a regular pair of late. 

India would now have to decide on whether to pick one of them and bring in Gambhir for the first game at the Wanderers starting next Friday. 

Later, Zaheer made the oft-repeated excuse in defence of Indias yet another batting debacle. Its not been for lack of effort. We have been trying our best. We are just a match away from striking form, he said. 

Zaheer also denied that the bowlers had been losing heart because of the continued failure of the batsmen. 

In the morning, Rest of South Africas tail wagged a bit to stretch the teams score to 138 after being 106 for 9 . 

Sreesanth was the most successful bowler with four for 53 while VRV picked three for 35. Even Irfan Pathan, in his four overs, had a chance to lay claim on one wicket as the Indian pacers scythed through the home batting.

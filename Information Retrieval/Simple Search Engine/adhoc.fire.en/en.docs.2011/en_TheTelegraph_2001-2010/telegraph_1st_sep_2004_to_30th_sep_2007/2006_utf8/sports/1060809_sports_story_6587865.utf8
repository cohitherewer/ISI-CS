 Barua stuns Russian GM

 -Holland Meet

Vlissingen: Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua scored an impressive victory over higher-rated GM Konstantin Landa of Russia to remain in joint lead after the fourth round of the Hogeschool Zeeland International chess tournament here. 

With four wins on the trot and first against a GM, Barua has maintained a clean slate and is now sharing the lead with GMs Sergey Erenburg of Israel and Chinas Li Shilong. 

Worlds youngest GM Parimarjan Negi drew with third seed GM Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova, while IM Roktim Bandyopadhyay and IM-in-waiting Saptarshi Roy recorded fine victories over their lower-ranked opponents. 

The other Indian in the fray, IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury, was held by Dutchman Frans Wolferink. 

With five more rounds to go, Negi is now in joint fourth spot on 3.5 points with top seed Mikhail Gurevich of Turkey and GM Michal Krasenkow of Poland besides 16 others. Other Indian players are in joint 23rd spot with identical three points apiece. 

Barua put up a brave front against Landa and even though he struggled in the early phase of the game. The typical manoeuvres were soon to follow and Landa didnt know what hit him. 

Negi drew with Viorel Iordachescu after a keenly-contested game. 

Roy and Bandyopadhyay won with ease against Dutchmen Rens Carlo and Gert van Rij, respectively, but Chowdhurys draw was an upset, more so as it came soon after he held Gurevich. (PTI)

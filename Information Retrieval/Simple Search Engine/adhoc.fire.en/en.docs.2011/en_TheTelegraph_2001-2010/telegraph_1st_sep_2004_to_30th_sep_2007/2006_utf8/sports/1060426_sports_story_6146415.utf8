 Knew Ponting the guy to watch out for

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar on Tuesday sounded unconcerned about Australian captain Ricky Ponting fast catching up with him in the number of Test tons scored (35). 

Records are not something Ive thought about, not even that of (Sunil) Gavaskar who set benchmarks and it was up to us to improve on them, said the champion batsman who shot past Gavaskars tally of 34 tons in the Kotla Test against Sri Lanka late last year. 

It doesnt matter now if Ponting betters (the record) or Lara does it. These records are meant to be broken. 

Sunil Gavaskars record of 34 Test hundreds stood for 22 years and such benchmarks help the next generation ? whether it is Ponting, Lara or myself. That is the best thing about records, he said. 

Sachin said he had first set his eyes on Ponting in an exhibition event in the Gulf and was told to look out for the player in the future. 

I played against Ponting in a few exhibition games in 1991-92, and knew he would be the guy to watch out for, he said. 

When asked about how his shoulder felt, Sachin said he was making progress gradually. He underwent an operation on the right shoulder in London at the end of March, at the end of the three Test series against England. 

Sachin also said that the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should work out a balanced schedule which takes into account the interests of players as well as the spectators. 

It is important that the ICC and the BCCI strike a balance between too much cricket and too less, the maestro said.

 Batsmen hold the key: Inzy

 Series vs England

 Inzy says conditions 

 will suit pacers 

 Karachi: The conditions 

 in England may suit the fast bowlers to the hilt, but Pakistan 

 captain Inzamam-ul Haq Saturday said it would be the batsmen 

 who would decide the fate of the series.

 Both the teams have geniune 

 fast bowlers and the conditions in England would definitely 

 suit the bowlers more than the batsmen. Therefore, I am 

 convinced that the team batting better and succeeding in 

 putting substantial runs on the scoreboard will have the 

 advantage, Inzamam said from Lahore.

 Pakistan leave for England on 

 June 24 on a two-and-a-half month tour where they will play 

 four Tests and five one-day Internationals. The first Test 

 begins at Lords from July 13. Pakistan have not lost 

 a series in England since 1982 when David Gowers men 

 defeated Imran Khans side 2-1.

 Inzamam was hopeful that fast 

 bowler Shoaib Akhtar and the other pacers would recover 

 in time for the series.

 I agree that the quickies 

 from both sides are either struggling for fitness or form 

 but we still have two months before the first Test. It is 

 ample time for any fast bowler to regroup, recompose and 

 regain complete fitness, he said.

 Pakistan have named injury-prone 

 Shoaib and Mohammed Sami in a provisional 21-man squad. 

 Shoaib has not played any international cricket for three 

 months while Sami stages a comeback.

 Likewise, Englands Steve 

 Harmison, Simon Jones and James Anderson have missed most 

 of international cricket this year and are also unlikely 

 against Sri Lanka. 

 Pakistan are expected to name 

 a three-pronged pace attack comprising Shoaib, Sami and 

 Asif for the tour, with Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Abdul Razzaq 

 being included as fast bowling allrounders.

 Inzamam said despite the injuries 

 to key England bowlers, he would not make the mistake of 

 underestimating the rival attack.I am still not under-estimating 

 the current England bowling attack. 

 Stating that picking the final 

 XI would be difficult, he said, I think picking 16 

 boys for the tour will not be a difficult decision as most 

 of the players select themselves automatically.

 The Multan-born batsman said he 

 was under no pressure and knew what was required to do. 

 I know I am in a stage of 

 my career where I need to perform to maintain my position 

 in the team. 

 I also know that if I fail 

 in one or two series and the teams performance is 

 also not up to the mark, the call for my sacking would intensify. 

 But this has not put any pressure on me but only motivated 

 me to strive harder to prove my critics wrong.

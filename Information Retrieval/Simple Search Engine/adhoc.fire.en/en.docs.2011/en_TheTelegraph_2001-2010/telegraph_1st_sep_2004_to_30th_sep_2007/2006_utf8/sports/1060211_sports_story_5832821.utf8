Adelaide: Sri Lankas Tillekeratne Dilshan ran out four Australian batsmen on Friday to spark a 22-run victory in the first final of the tri-series limited overs series. The Australians, a strong 1-4 favourite before the start, suffered five run outs in all at Adelaide Oval, including captain Ricky Ponting without facing a ball. 

They will have to come back from 0-1 down for only the third time in 26 years to claim the best-of-three series. 

We were clearly underdogs before the series and people thought it was a two horse race (between Australia and South Africa) but here we are, said Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu. We believe in ourselves and back ourselves and we played almost as well as we can today. 

Sri Lanka batted first and set a formidable target as Kumar Sangakkaras 83 led it to 274 for eight off its 50 overs. 

Atapattu also scored a half-century (53) but the game shifted on a late burst from Chamara Kapudegara (38 off 21 balls) and Dilshan (26 off 20 balls).

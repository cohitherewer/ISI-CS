 Shoaib in ODI squad

Karachi: Pakistan selectors have included fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar and uncapped batsman Shahid Yousuf in the squad to play five one-day Internationals against England. 

We have decided to retain Shoaib for the one-day series as he has recovered well from his ankle injury, chief selector Wasim Bari said on Sunday. Yousuf is a fine batting prospect who has done well for the A side in recent months in two major tournaments. 

Yousuf, 21, scored consistently for the A side in the Eurasia Cup in Abu Dhabi and the Top End series in Australia this year and also played against England in Pakistan. 

Shoaib, who has not played international cricket since February, had knee surgery in Australia and then broke down with a stress fracture of the ankle. Efforts were made to play him in the final Test at The Oval but Bari said the consensus was that it would be better for him to wait for the one-day series. 

The decision when to play Shoaib would be up to the team management, who are monitoring his fitness, he added. Yousuf and Shoaib Malik, who also missed the Test series due to an elbow injury, will join the team this week. 

Faisal Iqbal, Shahid Nazir and Mohammed Sami will return to Pakistan after the Test series. Salman Butt, Taufiq Umar and Samiullah Niazi were released from the squad before The Oval Test. 

The one-day series starts in Cardiff on August 30 and ends on September 10 at Edgbaston.

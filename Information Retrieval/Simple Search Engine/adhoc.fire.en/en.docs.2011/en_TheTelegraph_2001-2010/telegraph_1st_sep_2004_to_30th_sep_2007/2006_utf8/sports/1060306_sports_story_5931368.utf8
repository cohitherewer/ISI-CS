Jaipur: The performance of former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly will be watched keenly when hosts Central Zone take on East in the Deodhar Trophy limited overs league match on Sunday. 

The clash of the two teams, who are at the bottom of the table, otherwise has little interest because both have gone out of reckoning. 

Central have lost all three of their matches and have minus one point while East too have lost both their matches although narrowly. 

Batsmen of both teams have struggled in the tournament so far but Souravs presence should provide the necessary spark for East. 

When asked if he will be short of practice, captain Deep Dasgupta said that Sourav had been practising back home.

 Recovery on track: Sachin

Silverstone: Sachin Tendulkar said his recovery from a shoulder injury was on track as he aimed to get fit for a triangular series in Sri Lanka in August. 

Sachin was forced to miss Indias current series in the West Indies after he ruptured a tendon in his left shoulder in a freak incident in March. 

Its much better now, the doctors are happy with my progress and hopefully by the Sri Lanka series I should be fit, Sachin said on Sunday at the British Formula One Grand Prix. 

Im trying to build up strength and am planning to play a few exhibition games here (in England) where theres not too much pressure to have a nice introduction back into cricket. 

Sachin has not played since the final Test defeat against England in Mumbai in March. (Reuters)

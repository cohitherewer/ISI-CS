The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Boro make last four

 UEFA Cup

 London: Middlesbrough pulled 

 off an astonishing fight back to rival Liverpools 

 Champions League resurrection last season to stun Basel 

 and reach the Uefa Cup semi-finals on Thursday.

 Italian substitute Massimo Maccarones 

 strike a minute from time gave the Premier League side the 

 goal they needed to progress, sealing a 4-1 victory and 

 putting them through 4-3 on aggregate and into a meeting 

 with Steaua Bucharest.

 Basel, 2-0 up from the first leg, 

 went further ahead with Eduardos goal on 23 minutes 

 to leave Boro needing to score four. Mark Viduka got two 

 back and then after the Basel defender Daniel Majstorovic 

 was sent off, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink rifled in a third 

 before Maccarone hit the winner. 

 Steaua edged past city rivals 

 Rapid on away goals after a goalless draw at the Liu Manoliu 

 Stadium left the tie all-square at 1-1 on aggregate.

 Competition favourites Schalke 

 04 will meet Spains Sevilla in the other semi-final.

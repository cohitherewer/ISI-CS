 Kimi takes pole, Alonso penalised

Monza: McLarens Kimi Raikkonen dashed Michael Schumachers hopes of pole position on Saturday for what could be the Ferrari greats Italian Grand Prix farewell. 

The Finn, widely expected to be announced as Schumachers successor at the Italian glamour team after Sundays race, pipped the seven-time champion by just 0.002 seconds in the Monza sunshine. 

Fernando Alonso was dropped from fifth to 10th place on the starting grid for impeding Felipe Massa in Saturdays qualifying. 

Race stewards ordered that the Spaniard, 12 points clear of Schumacher with four races remaining, be stripped of his three best qualifying laps from the final session. 

BMW Saubers Nick Heidfeld was third and shares the second row with Massa, winner of the last race in Turkey.

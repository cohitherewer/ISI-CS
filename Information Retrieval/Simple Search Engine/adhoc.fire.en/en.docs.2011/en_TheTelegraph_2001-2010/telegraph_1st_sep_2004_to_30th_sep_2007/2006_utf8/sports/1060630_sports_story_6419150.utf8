The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A different attachment

Berlin: Germany want to beat Argentina and stay in the World Cup because the players have become attached to their five-star hotel and do not want to leave it, goalkeeper Jens Lehmann joked on Thursday. 

Lehmann said the pampering they are getting at the exclusive hotel built in a luxurious 95-year-old villa in Berlins poshest quarter was a small but important motivating factor. 

Its just a great hotel, Lehmann told a news conference before Fridays quarter final match less than five km from Olypiastadion, a smile flashing across his face. 

Even if we have a free day to go where ever we want, a majority of us, or many of us anyhow, feel so comfortable at the hotel that we decide to stay there. Its just fantastic. 

Its another reason we have to make it to the final so we can stay in there, said Lehmann. 

The Schlosshotel in Grunewald is one of the most expensive in Germany with suites costing up to 3,000 euros per night.

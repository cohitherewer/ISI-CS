 Botham backs Flintoff 

Leeds: Ian Botham has insisted Andrew Flintoff should captain England during their Ashes defence in Australia later this year, saying there was no-one else for the job if Michael Vaughan is unfit. 

Vaughan, who led England to a memorable Ashes triumph on home soil last year, is to undergo a fourth operation on his longstanding knee injury on Monday which means he will miss the upcoming Test series against Pakistan. (AFP)

 Japan aim to break jinx

 - North Koreans hoping to cash in on fitness

Calcutta: There is a world of difference between what is happening and might have been. This universal truth struck those present at the SAI complex where the North and South Korean (South Korea will be playing their third-place play-off match on the same day) under-20 football squads were sweating it out on the eve of the AFC Youth Championships final day. 

Had the stubborn Japanese not stood in the way, the Salt Lake Stadium would have witnessed a Korean battle on Sunday evening. 

The Japanese not only spoilt a potential high-voltage clash, they have emerged strong title contenders after a spirited show helped them nudge out South Korea the team everyone thought would walk away with the crown for the third straight time in the semi-finals. 

High on spirit and confidence, Japan will start as favourites on another account: they won their last two clashes against North Korea (1-0 in Japan last November and 2-0 in group league play in Bangalore last week). 

The Japanese, though, have a problem in the heart of defence. The sending-off of Makino Tomaoki in Thursdays semis has put coach Yashushi Yoshida in a fix. Having been asked to send Masaki Yanagawa home by the national federation (for club duty), the team management is now left with just one specialist central defender. 

The coach now has to convert one of his defensive midfielders into a stopper-back. The North Koreans will be as tough as the South Koreans. They have similar styles and operate at a very fast pace. Our defence has to be on its guard, said the Japanese coach. 

He refused to give much importance to the recent win over North Korea in Bangalore. That is history. Sunday is another day and we have to win that game. We want to play well and take home the trophy, said Yoshida. 

Strange as it may sound, Japan have never won this under-20 championship. They have featured in five title-round contests and lost every time. Sunday could present them the best opportunity to break that anomaly. 

The North Koreans, on the other hand, will be wanting to go one better than in 1976 when they won the title jointly with Iran. Keen to brush off their Bangalore defeat, coach Tong-sop Jo said his team would be striving to take advantage of the physical fitness factor.

 Unprecedented public apology by Ponting 

 - CODE OF CONDUCT VIOLATION 

 - Aussie captain needs to watch out over the next 12 months 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ponting 

Kuala Lumpur: Ricky Ponting has to watch out. 

Late on Tuesday, the Australian captain was fined his entire match fee for showing dissent at umpire Asad Raufs decision to call a Shane Watson wide in the tri-series opener against the West Indies. 

Ponting has chosen not to appeal the punishment handed out by Match Referee Chris Broad. Instead, he issued an unprecedented public apology after first apologising to teammates at a meeting on the morning-after. 

The (1.3) Code of Conduct breach got raised to Level 2, automatically, as Ponting had been guilty of the same offence during the Chittagong Test in April. A repeat, in the next 12 months, will lead to a ban as spelt out for Level 3 breaches. 

The Australian captain may be leading a great team, but he cant take liberties... He has to set an example by respecting what must be adhered to, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

Broad said pretty much the same thing in a Media release issued by the International Cricket Council: A captain should set an example for his players to follow and it is not acceptable for any player, let alone a captain, to question an umpires decision... 

The relevant Code reads: Showing dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse. It has been listed as a Level 1 offence, which invites the least penalties, but a repeat within 12 months makes it a Level 2 violation. 

Broad could have banned Ponting for two ODIs (or one Test), but didnt. However, if he steps out of line in the next 12 months, hes going to be kept out for between two and four Tests or between four and eight ODIs. 

 Clearly, Ponting wouldnt like being upgraded.

 THE RICKY PONTING APOLOGY 

Last night, I was disciplined by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad for a breach of the ICCs Code of Conduct during a one-day International against the West Indies. Having had the opportunity to sleep on the incident, I know I made a serious error of judgement. I regret the approach I made to umpire Asad Rauf and realise I shouldnt have behaved the way I did. 

International cricket matches are passionate affairs, but as the captain of the Australian cricket team, I understand its my responsibility to uphold the spirit of the game and I know that through my actions last night I let myself and my team down. 

The Spirit of Cricket is very important to the Australian cricket team. We had the opportunity to discuss its importance at our team camp in Queensland last month. At the camp, the whole squad reaffirmed their commitment to the Spirit of Cricket and Im disappointed that I fell short of the standards I expected of myself and my teammates last night. 

Ill be personally apologising to umpire Rauf at the first opportunity and, this morning, I called a team meeting to apologise to the players and to discuss our ongoing support for the Spirit of Cricket. 

Ive also spoken to Cricket Australias acting chief executive officer, Michael Brown, and apologised to him and, through him, to the Cricket Australia board of directors and Australian cricket fans for my behaviour. 

The Australian cricket team fully supports the ICC dedicating the ICC Champions Trophy to the Spirit of Cricket and we all look forward to playing the game within the laws and the spirit of those laws over the coming season of international cricket.

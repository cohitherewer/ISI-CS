 Priyanka back in sole lead

 National U-11 Chess 

Chennai: Priyanka Kumari of Jharkand got back into sole lead with seven points at the end of the eighth round of the National Under-11 Chess Championship here on Thursday. 

Priyanka got the lead after Srinidhi Nagarajan was beaten by her statemate J Vaishnavi. Priyanka has seven points and is half a point ahead of Vaishnavi and a Gouthami (Andhra Pradesh). 

Mahaswetha Kumar of Assam displayed his lack of theoretical knowledge in the way she handled the white side of the Sicilian defence against Priyanka. A 14th move combination netted a pawn for the Jharkhand player who made no mistake in converting the advantage into a full point. 

In the boys section, Delhis Sahaj Grover continued to lead with 7.5 points despite being held to a draw by Karnatakas Vian DCunha who is in second place. (PTI)

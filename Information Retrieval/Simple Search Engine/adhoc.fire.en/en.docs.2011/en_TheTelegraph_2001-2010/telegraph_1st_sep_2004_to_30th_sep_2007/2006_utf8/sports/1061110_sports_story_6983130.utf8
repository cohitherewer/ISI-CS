 Sehwag gets golfing tips from Kapil

Gurgaon: Bogged by indifferent form of late, Virender Sehwag has turned to golf to improve his concentration and focus. 

 The opener spent time learning a thing or two about irons and clubs from former Indian captain Kapil Dev, who has taken to the sport in a big way, at the DLF Club Course on Thursday. 

Sehwag admitted to frequenting the golf courses in the last six months and said it helped him improve his concentration skills. 

I play golf as a hobby. Cricket is my first love and I am totally focused on it. Golf is a good sport and helps in improving your concentration, the batsman said. 

The hand and eye co-ordination is important for good results in both the sports. But in golf you dont have the pressure of expectations weighing you down, said the cricketer who was here for an invitational golf event. (PTI)

 Daljit Punjab coach

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES

Calcutta: Cricketer-turned-curator Daljit Singh has been appointed coach of the Punjab team for the upcoming Ranji Trophy season. 

Daljit will replace former Pakistan captain and coach Intikhab Alam who was in charge for the last two years. 

Intikhab opted out on personal grounds. Apparently, the delay in the processing of his papers contributed in a big way to his not coming back for a third year. 

According to the terms of the original contract, Intikhab was to have been working with the Punjab team from the first week of September. However, the Punjab Cricket Association could get his work permit cleared only in the second half of October. 

I am still preparing for the new job. As you know, till a few days back I was involved with the preparation of the Champions Trophy wicket here Let us see how things work out. The good thing is that first three games are in Mohali, which should be good for us, Daljit said.

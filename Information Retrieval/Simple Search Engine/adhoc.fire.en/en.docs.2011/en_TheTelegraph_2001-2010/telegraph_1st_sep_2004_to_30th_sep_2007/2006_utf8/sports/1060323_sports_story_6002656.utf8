 Sotherton overcomes cramps to gold

Melbourne: Englands Kelly Sotherton overcame a series of aches and pains to win her first major title on Wednesday, Day VII of the Commonwealth Games. 

World champion Dorcus Inzikuru won the inaugural womens steeplechase to provide Uganda with their first medal of the Games and Australia won gold in athletics, diving and lawn bowls to extend their massive lead at the top of the standings. 

Heptathlete Sotherton had won a bronze at the Athens Olympics two years ago but upgraded to gold this time, tallying 6396 points in the multi-discipline event despite struggling with cramps, rib pain and sore knees. 

Im sore all over but I got the medal and thats what counts, she said. Im a bit disappointed with my performance today but I gave it everything I had. 

Australias Melissa Rollison matched Sothertons effort but not the result, going stride for stride with Inzikuru in the 3000m steeplechase and was still challenging her as they were approaching the final bend when she made her only mistake. 

The former junior world record holder stumbled on a hurdle and gave the Ugandan the break she needed to open up a decisive gap and dash away to the gold. 

Australia did win an unexpected gold when John Steffensen rode a wave of local support to win the 400m with world record holder Michael Johnson looking on from the commentary box. 

The former amateur boxer had brashly predicted he would beat Grenadas world indoor champion Alleyne Francique and promptly delivered the knockout blow with a personal best time of 44.73. 

Australia won a pair of golds in the diving while Canadian Alexandre Despatie took the one-metre springboard title as expected, although none of the winners could snatch the limelight from silver medallist Melissa Wu, a 13-year-old Australian schoolgirl who is just 135cm tall. 

Wu shared silver with Alex Croak in womens 10 metres synchronised platform.

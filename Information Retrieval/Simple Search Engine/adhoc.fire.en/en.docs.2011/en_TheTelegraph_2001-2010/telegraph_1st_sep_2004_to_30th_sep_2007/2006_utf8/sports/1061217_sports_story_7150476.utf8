 Liverpool win 3-0

London: An early penalty from Xabi Alonso and late goals by Craig Bellamy and Steven Gerrard gave Liverpool an easy 3-0 win at Charlton Athletic and third place in the Premier League on Saturday. Spanish midfielder Alonso converted a penalty to put Liverpool in front against a side battling relegation. Liverpool soon came close to adding more before goals from Bellamy and captain Gerrard in the last 10 minutes rounded off a convincing performance by Rafael Benitezs men. (Reuters)

 No shift in final venue: ICC

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday scotched speculation that the Champions Trophy final might be shifted from the Brabourne Stadium following criticism over the wicket. 

We want to put all this in perspective that the Brabourne Stadium is scheduled to host the final on November 5 and the ICC has no plans to change it, a spokesman for the games world governing body said here. 

People can analyse the outcome of a match from different standpoints, but we dont find pitches helping bowlers more than batsmen the reason enough to shift the venue, he added. 

During the Australia-West Indies match on Wednesday, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed did have a one-to-one with Raj Singh Dungarpur, the president of CCI, and discussed the issue. Both parties, however, refused to make any comment.

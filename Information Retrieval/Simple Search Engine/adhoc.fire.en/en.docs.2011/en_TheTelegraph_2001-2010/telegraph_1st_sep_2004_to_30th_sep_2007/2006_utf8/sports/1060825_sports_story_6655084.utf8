The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injury is not serious, Kumble informs Board

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Veteran leggie Anil Kumble has informed Board secretary Niranjan Shah that his injury isnt serious. 

Kumble, whod signed a contract with Surrey for the summers second half, has been diagnosed with tendinitis in his bowling shoulder. 

I spoke to Anil and he said the injury isnt serious, Shah told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

He added: Physio John Gloster is going to London and, so, he will examine Anil there Lets see what he has to say. 

The tendinitis, though, has put a question mark over Kumbles ODI comeback. Hes one of the 30 probables for the forthcoming Champions Trophy. 

Meanwhile, Shah remarked that the venue for practice matches before Team Indias departure (September 9, in all probability) for the tri-series in Kuala Lumpur would be finalised in a day or two. 

The Board doesnt have much of a choice its either going to be Chennai or Bangalore.

 Laras plea to board, union

Port of Spain: The West Indies cricket captain Brian Lara urged West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and the players union to end their face-off and come together for the sake of the sport in the Caribbean. 

Hopefully WIPA who represents the players and the WICB, our father figure, can come together, not just on this issue, but on issues in the future, Lara said here. 

For the West Indies cricket to move forward, everybody has to be under one roof. Everybody has got to be moving forward in one direction and be happy with each other. 

Lara said the tug of war between WIPA and the WICB was distracting the players from their task. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He is the best Indian spinner ever: Kapil 

 - Former greats hail leggie on reaching the 500-mark 

OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES

The accolades flowed thick and fast. Everyone was willing to stand up and say something for Anil Kumble here on Saturday. The following is what they had to say about the leg-spinner on his reaching the 500-wicket landmark: 

 BISHAN SINGH BEDI: Getting 

 to 500 wickets is no joke. People often say he doesnt 

 turn the ball enough, but then, how did he manage all these 

 wickets! Its not that he has played at home right 

 through his career. The achievement is just amazing. 

I think its sheer perseverance that has kept him going. There has been no cribbing? he fought to keep his place intact. You cant compare him with Shane Warne. Both may be leg-spinners, but are in different moulds. 

That he is not playing the ODIs will only prolong his career. I can only hope he gets much better treatment than some others. 

KAPIL DEV: He has achieved what others only dream of. You cannot draw any parallels with this landmark. When he started I never dreamt he would reach this far. It has all been about focus, commitment and dedication. 

I have no doubts that he is the best Indian spinner ever? If not now, then when? He deserves all the credit. Going strong for 16 long years is not easy. You should also remember that an individual is important, but at the end of the day, cricket is a team game. 

SANDEEP PATIL: Over the last 15 years hes shown what commitment and determination can achieve. Its not easy to comeback from a shoulder injury and performing like hes done. 

I have seen cricketers lose the way midway. Apart from his bowling hes also a very likeable man. Hes always had his feet planted firmly on the ground. Hes easily among the best spinners we have produced. 

Every spinner is different and its difficult to compare. Its a tremendous achievement. 

 ERAPALLI PRASANNA: It is a commendable 

 feat and it will remain for many more years in his name. 

 He is one of the few Indian spinners who has shown wicket-taking 

 ability in great measure, bowling with the same venom as 

 when he made his debut. 

The game itself has grown and proven to be more competitive and Kumble, I am sure, will be able to assist India for few more years. He has many years of services to the nation. 

JAWAGAL SRINATH: He has been our spearhead for more than a decade and we are all proud of him for what he has achieved. It has been his perseverance which today has helped him reach the 500 wicket club. He still exudes the same enthusiasm he showed during the days when he started his career. 

AJIT WADEKAR: He is one bowler who never grumbles about a wicket and is ready to bowl on any wicket. And when the wicket helps him a bit, hes deadly. People dont play him for the turn on such wickets and pay the price. And to have come back from his shoulder injury (in 2000) is no mean feat.

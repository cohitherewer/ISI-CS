 I didnt insult his mother: Materazzi

Rome: Italian defender Marco Materazzi, who was head-butted by Zinedine Zidane during the World Cup final, has denied insulting the France captains mother. 

I said nothing to him about race, religion or politics. I did not talk about his mother either, the defender was quoted as saying in an Italian sports daily. 

I lost my mother when I was 15 and it still upsets me to talk about it. Of course I didnt know that his mother was in hospital. I send her my best wishes. 

Materazzi also said Zidane was his footballing hero. Zidane was always my hero. I admire him greatly. 

Materazzi disagreed with Fifa president Sepp Blatters suggestion that the 34-year-old Zidane could be stripped of the title. He won it for what he did on the pitch, Materazzi said. He was the best. 

Materazzi gave the interview before Zidane appeared on French television (live) to talk about the attack which resulted in a red card in his last international game. 

Zidane was sent off in the second half of extra-time and the teams were tied at 1-1 after 120 minutes. In the penalty shootout, France lost 3-5.

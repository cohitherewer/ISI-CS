 Ronaldo is shaping up well: Trainer

Weggis: Ronaldo is recovering from an injury-hit season and has improved considerably during Brazils pre-World Cup preparations, Brazils physical trainer said on Saturday. 

Ronaldo was sidelined for most of April and May owing to a muscle injury suffered in the Spanish league. Hes not having problems with his leg anymore, hes already feeling stronger, SantAnna said before Brazils last training session before moving to Germany. 

Many said Ronaldo was overweight when he reported to Brazils training camp two weeks ago, but the striker insisted such comments were coming from people who were not well-informed.

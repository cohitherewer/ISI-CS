The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I was denied a chance: Mongia 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India stumper Nayan Mongia has started a new innings. He is doing commentary for the ongoing Duleep Trophy final. But the premature end to his cricket career still hurts him. 

Now I am 35 and could have at least played for another four years for the country. I was denied that chance and when I start thinking it hurts me a lot, Mongia rued at the Eden on Monday. 

But the ouster from cricket hasnt taken away the zeal from him to serve the game. If I am required by the Board for any help, I am always there to help out, Mongia stated. 

Speaking on the present day keepers, Mongia was full praise of Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Adam Gilchrist. Smashing any bowling attack like Gilchrist or Dhoni comes naturally. You cannot develop that ability through practice, it comes naturally, Mongia remarked.

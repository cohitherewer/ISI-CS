The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 1950s: Birth of a legend

 BRAZIL 1950

 Throughout the Second World War 

 the Italian vice-president of Fifa, Dr. Ottorino Barassi, 

 hid the World Cup trophy in a shoe-box under his bed and 

 thus saved it from falling into the hands of occupying troops.

In the first post-war Fifa congress 

 meeting, held on July 25, 1946 in Luxembourg, it was decided 

 that the World Cup trophy was henceforth to be known as 

 the Jules Rimet Cup. The congress also heralded the return 

 of the British associations, absent since 1929. It was to 

 be the Brazilian Sports Confederation, however, whose team 

 had made such an impact on the 1938 World Cup, that was 

 granted the responsibility of hosting the next meet. 

 The qualifying competition turned 

 into something of a farce with teams qualifying then withdrawing 

 and teams already eliminated being offered places. Eventually, 

 only 13 teams participated in the finals. As a result, while 

 two groups consisted of four teams each, Uruguay had only 

 Bolivia to beat to advance. 

 Brazil presented the biggest stadium 

 Maracana for the World Cup. Incidentally, on the first 

 of the meet, it wasnt ready. 

 Did You Know? 

 After an easy victory over Mexico (4-0), the Brazilians, 

 to everybodys surprise, were held to a draw (2-2) 

 by the Swiss. Yugoslavia, having won their first two matches, 

 needed only a draw against the Brazilians to qualify for 

 the next round. But in front of a fervent 150,000-strong 

 crowd at the Maracana, Brazil ran out winners (2-0). Brazil 

 thus qualified with three other teams, Spain, Uruguay 

 and Sweden, not for the semi-finals, but for a final series 

 of matches in round-robin format, in which England and 

 Italy were surprising absentees. 

 After a weeks rest, the Brazilians ran riot, 

 thrashing Sweden (7-1) and then Spain (6-1). Nobody doubted 

 for a minute that this impressive string of results would 

 continue against Uruguay, who, having drawn against Spain, 

 had just three points to their credit. The Brazilians 

 therefore needed only a draw to become World champions.

 In front of a capacity crowd, Brazil opened the score 

 just after half-time, but seemed tense and never displayed 

 their characteristic samba-style football. The Uruguayans 

 equalised far from being overawed by the partisan crowd 

 and then, with just 11 minutes to go, scored the winners. 

 Off-side 

 With already-eliminated teams being offered places 

 in the finals following a string of pull-outs, India were 

 given a chance to make debut. But they had to withdraw 

 because Fifa did not let India play in bare feet. 

 After the final match, the Brazilian officials 

 were so deeply shocked that they even forgot to present 

 the Uruguayans with the World Cup trophy. And it was left 

 to Jules Rimet himself to go down onto the pitch in search 

 of the Uruguayan captain to perform the ceremony. 

 A total that is not likely to be equalled ever again 

 is the 174,000 crowd in the Maracana stadium in Rio on 

 16 July (unofficial sources quote the figure as over 200,000), 

 when the final was staged. 

 Apart from 1958, it was the only World Cup in which 

 the home team reached the final and failed to win the 

 title. 

 A unique record was created by Mexicos goalkeeper 

 Antonio Carbajal in terms of World Cup final appearances. 

 He represented his country at five World Cups between 

 1950 and 1966. Eight players have made it four times, 

 but Germanys Lothar Matthus went one better at 

 France 98 and equalled Carbajals record. Matthus 

 has also played in a total of 25 World Cup final round 

 matches another record. 

 SWITZERLAND 

 1954

 Four years after the frenzy of 

 the Maracana Stadium, the Jules Rimet Trophy returned to 

 Europe to a calmer atmosphere in Switzerland. The field 

 of play, however, produced breathtaking entertainment. This 

 fifth World Cup was unforgettable for its sensational high-scoring 

 games, and a surprise win for the German Federal Republic.

 Hungary the Magical Magyars 

 were the favourites with a team including Puskas, Bozsik, 

 Kocsis and Hidegkuti, unbeaten in 28 internationals and 

 Olympic champions. But after the infamous Battle of 

 Berne with Brazil three players were sent off and 

 the teams fought afterwards in the dressing rooms the 

 Hungarians were rattled. 

 In the final, after leading 2-0 

 against West Germany, whom they had beaten 3-8 in the opening 

 round, they went down 2-3. 

 Following their wins in 1930 and 

 1950, Uruguay were back for their third appearance and still 

 unbeaten. Playing in the old continent for the 

 first time, they had the chance of carrying off the trophy 

 permanently with a third win. That would not come to pass, 

 however.

 Did You Know?

 The qualifying rounds featured a higher number of nations 

 than ever before, with the AFC founded in 1954 also including 

 several teams from Asia (Japan and Korea) and Africa (Egypt), 

 giving the event a truly global dimension. Sixteen teams 

 took part in the finals, three more than in Brazil four 

 years earlier. South America was represented by Uruguay, 

 Brazil and Mexico; the Asian qualifier was Korea (the 

 first Asian team having been the Dutch East Indies in 

 1938), and the Europeans were Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, 

 England, France, Hungary, Italy, Scotland, Switzerland, 

 Turkey, West Germany and Yugoslavia. This figure remained 

 constant until the 1982 World Cup in Spain, when it rose 

 to 24. 

 The quality of football in the games at Basle, Berne, 

 Lausanne, Zurich and Geneva, the five host cities, reached 

 dizzying heights in 1954. In 26 matches, an incredible 

 total of 140 goals was scored, making an average of 5.38 

 goals per game. Needless to say, this is still the record 

 for the number of goals scored in a World Cup final competition. 

 Off-side 

 On 26 June 1954, the quarter-final match in Lausanne 

 produced more goals than any match before or since, Austria 

 beating Switzerland 7-5, despite the Swiss 

 being 3-0 ahead at one stage. But the extreme heat took 

 its toll of the home team. 

 Gaston Barreau became the oldest coach in World Cup 

 history when he took his team to the tournament at 70. 

 Another school of statisticians suggested that Barreau 

 was one of France selectors, not the coach proper. 

 Kocsis scored two hattricks in the tournament, a feat 

 which was later equalled by Fontaine of France (1958), 

 Muller of Germany (1970) and Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina 

 (1994 and 1998). 

 SWEDEN 1958

 After Switzerland, Sweden was 

 named host country for the 1958 World Cup a Cup which, 

 on 16 October 1956, lost its founding father, when Jules 

 Rimet died in Paris at the age of 83. Brazil, inspired by 

 a 17-year-old youngster called Pel, won the trophy for 

 the first time. Pel scored against Wales, hit a hattrick 

 in a 5-2 win over France in the semi-finals and struck two 

 more in the final, a 5-2 triumph over the hosts. 

 Frenchman Just Fontaine scored 

 13 goals in the tournament, a record which still stands. 

 It was also the first World Cup in which a match ended in 

 a 0-0 draw: the first round game between England and Brazil. 

 For the first time the Fifa World 

 Cup received international television coverage and the world 

 could watch the mastery of the stars of modern football: 

 Kopa, Fontaine, Charlton, Yashin, Garrincha, Vava and Pel, 

 who at 17 scored six goals, including two in the final when 

 the Brazilians, at last, were crowned world champions. 

 Did You Know?

 Though Brazil lifted the coveted trophy for the first 

 time, it was the team from France which caught the publics 

 eye with their incisive attacking trio of Kopa, Piantoni 

 and Fontaine. They were to garner a string of honours: 

 Best goal-scorer (Just Fontaine 13 goals); best attack 

 (23 goals) and best player, elected by an international 

 panel, Raymond Kopa. 

 France finished top of their group in the first round, 

 scoring 11 goals in three games. The fairy-tale ended 

 in the semi-finals, however, against the favourites Brazil. 

 After consecutive disappointments in 1950 and 1954, 

 the Brazilians set out to make amends. They finished on 

 top of a difficult group, which included Austria (3-0), 

 England (0-0) and the USSR (2-0). Incidentally, Pele made 

 his World Cup debut in that 2-0 win against the Soviet 

 Union in Gothenburg on June 15. Garrincha, the Little 

 Bird with the deformed legs and incredible dribbling 

 ability, also made his first appearance in the same match 

 and bamboozled the Soviets as Vava scored twice.

 In the quarter-finals against Wales, Brazil pegged 

 away for an hour before a stroke of brilliance by a young 

 17-year old made the difference. This was the first Fifa 

 World Cup goal scored by Pel a star was born. 

 The Swedes presence in the final was astonishing 

 in that it was a side built from scratch for the tournament, 

 a great deal of debate having gone on before deciding 

 whether to make professional players in the Italian league 

 eligible for the World Cup. 

 Fifa president Arthur Drewry presented the gold statuette 

 to the Brazilian captain Bellini.

 Off-side 

 It was the first time a team had won the World Cup outside 

 its own hemisphere, a record that remained intact until 

 Brazil equalled it themselves by winning in Asia in 2002.

 The sixth World Cup was also to be marked by a record 

 number of countries taking part (55). The qualifying rounds 

 threw up some startling surprises: Belgium, The Netherlands, 

 Switzerland, Spain, Uruguay and, most unexpectedly, Italy, 

 all failed to qualify. The first round of the finals offered 

 the public the chance to discover new footballing nations 

 such as Wales, Northern Ireland, the USSR and Sweden. 

 England and Scotland were heavily affected by the Munich 

 air crash which killed more than half of the Manchester 

 United squad. Scotlands part-time manager Matt Busby 

 the Manchester coach was badly injured in the accident 

 and couldnt serve his motherland in Sweden. 

 When Pele scored the hattrick against France, he became 

 the youngest to achieve the feat in World Cup history, 

 at 17 years and 244 days.

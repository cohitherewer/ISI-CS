 Quick Takes

 Bhutia: No chance of Greece-like upset 

 New Delhi: Bhaichung Bhutia 

 thinks there is no chance of a major upset in the World 

 Cup. Its not going to be like Euro 2004 when 

 Greece stunned the favourites to claim the title, 

 he said on Friday. If you ask me who will win, I cant 

 pinpoint.

 As for the Asian teams, he said: 

 I dont see them going far. They have been clubbed 

 in tough groups and only Saudi Arabia stand a chance because 

 they are in a relatively easy pool.

 Marcello Lippi Questioned

 Milan: Magistrates questioned 

 Italy coach Marcello Lippi on Friday in a soccer scandal 

 swirling around champions Juventus which Prime Minister 

 Romano Prodi called a symbol of a crisis of ethics 

 in the country.

 Juventus shares tumbled 11 per 

 cent to a record low in the wake of investigations into 

 transfer deals and allegations of match-fixing at the club.

 Ive been questioned 

 as a witness... From now on Ill think only about leading 

 the national team, Lippi said.

 Flag-bearers

 New Delhi: ESPN-STAR Sports 

 and Adidas, will begin a search for four kids to represent 

 India as Fifa Fair Play flag-bearers in Germany. The four, 

 selected from among 1,200 students, will get an all-expense 

 paid trip to Germany to watch one match during the World 

 Cup.

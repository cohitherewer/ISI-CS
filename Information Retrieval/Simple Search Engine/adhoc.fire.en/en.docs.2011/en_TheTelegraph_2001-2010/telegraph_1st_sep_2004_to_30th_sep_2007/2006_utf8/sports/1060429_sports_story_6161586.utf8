 Quick Takes

 Lionel Messi recovering well

 Buenos Aires: Barcelona 

 and Argentina forward Lionel Messi is recovering well from 

 a thigh injury sustained in training on Wednesday, the Argentina 

 team doctor said on Thursday.

 Weve followed all 

 the steps that Barcelona have instructed, Donato Villani 

 told reporters outside the clinic where Messi had undergone 

 a routine check. 

 The injury is improving 

 well in the way we had predicted.

 Messi, 18, has been out of action 

 since early March when he tore a thigh muscle in his right 

 leg during the second leg of a 3-2 aggregate victory over 

 Chelsea in the first knockout round of the Champions League.

 He returned to Argentina last 

 week to continue his recovery and has been training at a 

 private club near his hometown of Rosario accompanied by 

 a Barcelona physiotherapist. 

 Meanwhile, Spain midfielder Xavi 

 returned to the Barcelona squad on Friday five months after 

 suffering a serious knee injury. It is a major boost to 

 his chances of making Luis Aragoness Spain squad for 

 the World Cup finals in Germany.

 He tore the cruciate ligament 

 in his right knee during training at the beginning of December.

 Streakers liable for fines

 Rostock (Germany): A German 

 court ruled that stadium operators can claim damages from 

 streakers at matches ? a decision that could affect the 

 World Cup.

 The high regional court in Rostock 

 ruled on Friday in favour of local second-division club 

 Hansa Rostock, which filed compensation claims against three 

 streakers after being fined euro20,000 by the German soccer 

 federation (DFB).

 The court ruled the club could 

 seek full compensation for the fine against the trio, who 

 had climbed over the fence and onto the field during an 

 October 2003 match.

 Patent dispute

 Karlsruhe: A German federal 

 court ruled against Fifa in a copyright dispute on Thursday 

 and said the soccers world governing body could not 

 prevent German firms from using the term Soccer World 

 Cup 2006 in adverts.

 Fifa argued it held the copyright 

 to the slogan and was trying to protect its official World 

 Cup sponsors.

 But the court ruled Fussball 

 WM 2006 (Soccer World Cup 2006) was a 

 generic term and should not be protected by a patent.

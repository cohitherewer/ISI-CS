The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flat track irks both camps 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With his team within sniffing distance of the Duleep Trophy, North Zone captain Mithun Manhas was a satisfied man at the end of Day III of the final versus Sri Lanka A. But he also made it clear that the pitch was responsible for such a one-sided affair. 

On this kind of a track, it is impossible for bowlers to trouble the batsmen. With the outfield so fast, any batsman can score at will, Manhas said. 

Manhas and his team will be eyeing an outright win, rather than triumph on first-innings lead, to further boost confidence before the Ranji Trophy gets underway next week. All of us will be representing their states after this game and a win will help us be fully charged up when we don state colours, the North Zone captain stated. 

Mahesh Rawat, who will resume on Wednesday needing a boundary to reach 100, wasnt too excited. Its good that I have got runs again as it will help motivate me for the Ranji Trophy, he said. 

Sri Lanka A coach Don Anurasiri voiced his misgivings about the pitch. If you want the development of cricket, this sort of wicket wont serve the purpose, he remarked. 

Meanwhile, both sides have been denied the use of kookaburra balls during practice and, instead, given SG balls. The North bowlers had no choice, but the visitors had some SG balls with them. Its another matter that didnt help the Lankans check the North run-flow.

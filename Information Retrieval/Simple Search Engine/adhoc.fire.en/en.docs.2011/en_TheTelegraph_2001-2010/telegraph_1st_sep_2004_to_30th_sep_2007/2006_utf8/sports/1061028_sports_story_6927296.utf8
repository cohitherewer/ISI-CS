 Bindra: MPA issue can still be settled on table

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Despite the tough stand taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on signing the Members Participation Agreement (MPA) for International Cricket Council (ICC) events from after the 2007 World Cup till 2015, former president Inderjit Singh Bindra feels a settlement could still be reached. 

Bindra, who heads the BCCI committee formed to look into the MPA issue, told The Telegraph Friday: We cant sign the MPA in its present form, but things can be settled across the table... We want our pre-existing contracts to be protected... The primacy cant be that of our contract with the ICC. 

Former Union minister Arun Jaitley, Lalit Modi, Shashank Manohar, Niranjan Shah and N. Srinivasan are the other members of the committee which meets here Saturday. 

Weve called for the MPA to be modified and the ICC has responded by deputing a committee to interact with us in a couple of days... As Ive said, a settlement is possible... In fact, I dont see why it cant come about as both the ICC and the BCCI are working for the benefit of the game. However, its a fact that the ICCs sponsors are either Indian companies or they operate big in India... We have the money, Bindra added. 

The ICC, of course, is peeved that the BCCI expressed its reservations as late as last month, when the draft of the MPA was circulated back in April. The other nine Test-playing nations have agreed to sign it in its present form. 

Incidentally, ICC president Percy Sonn and chief executive Malcolm Speed are here and watched the South Africa versus Pakistan match in neighbouring Mohali. Sonns predecessor, Ehsan Mani, has also come.

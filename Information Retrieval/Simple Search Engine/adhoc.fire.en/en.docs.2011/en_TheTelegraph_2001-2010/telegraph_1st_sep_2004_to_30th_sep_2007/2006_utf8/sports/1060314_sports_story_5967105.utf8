The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Still a long way to go, says Munaf

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Even as Anil Kumble was named Man of the Match, Munaf Patel grabbed the limelight on the final day in neighbouring Mohali. The dressing room celebrations centred much around him and he seemed to bask in the glory. 

Not even in his wildest dreams had he imagined that such a dream debut was in store for him. With seven wickets in the match, he has announced his arrival on the international scene. 

 I am happy to have fulfilled expectations? I just concentrated on bowling in the right areas and have been rewarded. But theres still a long way to go, he told The Telegraph before boarding the team bus to the hotel. 

Dravid couldnt hide his excitement. His bowling today was fantastic. He bowled really well, he got good reverse and bowled at a good pace. If you are quick, accurate and can swing the ball around, you always pose problems. His three wickets in the morning proved crucial, the Team India captain said. 

The sight of batsmen flinching in the face of pace was satisfying even for Dravid. We have faced the music all these years, so its nice to have someone who can give it back.

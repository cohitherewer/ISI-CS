 Captaincy not a burden: Flintoff

London: England allrounder Andrew Flintoff says he did not find captaincy a burden but will be happy to hand the reins back to Michael Vaughan. 

I am just keeping Michaels seat warm until he comes back. I have enjoyed captaining the side but Michael is our captain and I am looking forward to him captaining again, Flintoff was quoted as saying in an English daily. 

Vaughan, back in Sheffield where medical staff are mulling over the best way to treat a knee complaint that puts at risk his long-term future, kept in touch with Flintoff by text message, congratulating him for drawing such a committed performance in adversity from one of the youngest sides England have fielded in 40 years. 

Flintoff, on his part, said he was proud of the way his players responded to the challenge. 

Im proud of the lads. Coming into this Test match there were a few things that went against us. People said that we had no chance but the lads fought and they scrapped. 

He made light of fears the captaincy might prove too burdensome, as it did for another great England allrounder, Ian Botham, a generation ago. 

When Ive not been captain Im always involved in the game and thinking about the game. I never switch off. I wasnt going into it worrying about how much it was going to take out of me. I have enjoyed doing it. At no point did I feel that it was too much, he said. 

According to the daily, Flintoff hoped his captaincy inexperience will persuade the Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle to ignore Englands slow over-rate ? which fell during Indias late flurry to 11 an hour ? and his pointing of Irfan Pathan to the pavilion. 

I was just telling him how well he played, Flintoff said. He played some great shots. 

Writing in another daily under his byline, Alastair Cook, who scored a century on his debut, said, the mood in the camp was very upbeat on Sunday and that had it been a boxing match, we would have won on points. 

Ill never forget that moment on Saturday when the ball crossed the boundary rope to bring up my century, he wrote. 

That hundred was the realisation of all those dreams you have as a young lad making your first strides in the game. And there were several fairytale moments in this match: both Paul Collingwoods hundred and Monty Panesars dismissal of Sachin Tendulkar had that same quality of a dream come true. 

We had a tough last hour in the field on Sunday, but after the game the mood in the camp was extremely positive. As Freddie Flintoff said, this is a very young England side.

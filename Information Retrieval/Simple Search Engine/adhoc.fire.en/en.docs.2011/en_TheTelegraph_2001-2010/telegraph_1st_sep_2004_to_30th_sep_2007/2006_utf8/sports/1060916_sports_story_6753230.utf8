 Muthiah chairman 

Chennai: Former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) Dr A. C. Muthiah has been elected chairman of the six-member committee which will choose the next president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2007. 

Muthiah has been elected chairman of the ICC committee, who will oversee the nominations to be received by the world body and then suggest a suitable person as successor of Percy Sonn next year, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said Friday. 

The others on the committee are Bob Merriman, Mueen Afzal, John Blair, Stephen Camacho and Imran Khwaja. 

The existing formula of electing the ICC president on a rotation basis has been dispensed with and this committee will select the successor to Sonn from among the nominations received, Shah said.

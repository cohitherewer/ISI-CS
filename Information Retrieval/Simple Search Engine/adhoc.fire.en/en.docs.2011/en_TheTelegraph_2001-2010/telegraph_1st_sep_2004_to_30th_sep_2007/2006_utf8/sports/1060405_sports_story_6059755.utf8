 No excuses if team fails to deliver, says Beckham

 - England captain optimistic about Owens recovery in time for World Cup 

 Michael Owen and David Beckham 

England captain David Beckham has said he will not offer excuses if the team fails to perform at this summers World Cup. 

Beckham is confident striker Michael Owen will overcome injury to be fit for the tournament in Germany, and feels the squad will be fitter than ever before. 

We cant keep making excuses going into competitions because with the talent we have in our country we have to go into this competition with the aim of going as far as we can, Beckham said. 

No excuses and no regrets. If we are not good enough we are not good enough, but we know we have got the players. 

The England team will be fresher than going into previous World Cups. We have gone into tournaments before with players carrying injuries and others missing. Hopefully we can avoid that and have everyone fit ? that will give us a great chance. 

Owens fitness is Englands main concern, but Beckham is optimistic the Newcastle striker will recover from a fractured metatarsal in time. 

Beckham overcame a similar injury before the 2002 World Cup, and said: I have heard Michael say he will be on that plane and that he will be fit, and fingers crossed he will. 

Its difficult but I think Michael will be fine. He has been through injuries before and he knows what he has to do. 

Hes young, quick and athletic and when hes recovered from injuries before he has come straight back into the team and scored goals straight away. He will be hungry when he returns, he has had a rest over the last few weeks and he will be fresh going into the World Cup. 

However, Owen could go to Germany having played hardly any competitive football. He is currently working his way back to fitness after undergoing a second operation on a metatarsal injury last month. 

Im hoping I can play again for Newcastle this season, he said on Monday. Hopefully I will get one or two games. I would be a miracle worker if it was any more than that. 

Newcastles season ends with the visit of Chelsea on May 7, just eight days before the England squad is announced. 

If he is not fit for that match, he could ask the FA for special permission to play in Alan Shearers testimonial on May 11 and there are also a couple of England friendlies before the opening World Cup match with Paraguay on June 10 in Frankfurt. 

Owen has played just 10 games for Newcastle since his ?17-million move from Real Madrid last summer.

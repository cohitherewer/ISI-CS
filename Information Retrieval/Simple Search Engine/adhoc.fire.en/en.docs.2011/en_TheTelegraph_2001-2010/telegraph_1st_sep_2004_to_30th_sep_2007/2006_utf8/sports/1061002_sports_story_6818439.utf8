 Chopra up to 3rd, Atwal 40th

Madison: Daniel Chopra carded a four-under 68 to be placed joint third after the third round in the Southern Farm Bureau Classicon Saturday. 

The Indo-Swede fired four birdies and no bogeys to come to nine-under 207 and three behind the leader, D. vJ. Trahan (71), who is at 12-under. 

Arjun Atwal, who is battling to keep his card for next season on the US PGA Tour, also shot a 68 and moved up from tied 70th to 40th after three rounds. 

Atwal began from the tenth and parred eight holes in a row before holing his first birdie on the ninth. Then on his second nine he went into the overdrive with birdies on first, fifth, sixth and eighth at which point he was five-under. Then he missed a short par putt and dropped his only bogey of the day for four-under. 

Leader Trahan, desperately in need of a good finish if not the title, shrugged off a double bogey to maintain a two-stroke lead after 54 holes. 

He birdied the final two holes for a one-under 71 on the Annandale Golf Club Course. 

Trahan, who has led after all three rounds, has a 12-under 204 total after opening with rounds of 65 and 68. Two-time US Open champion Lee Janzen (67) is second, and Chopra (68) and Brad Faxon (72) follow at nine-under.

 Gold for Sunil

New Delhi: Sunil Kumar asserted his supremacy by winning only the second gold medal ever for the country at the World Cadet Boxing Championships in Istanbul on Monday. 

Sunil upset Agayev Ilkin of Azerbaijan, the bronze medal winner of European Championships held in June, by RSC (OS) in the final of the 50kg class in the tournament that concluded on Sunday. 

Balbir Singh had last won the gold in the 48kg division in 2001 in the second edition of the tournament. Indian colts have not won a medal at world level since then. (PTI)

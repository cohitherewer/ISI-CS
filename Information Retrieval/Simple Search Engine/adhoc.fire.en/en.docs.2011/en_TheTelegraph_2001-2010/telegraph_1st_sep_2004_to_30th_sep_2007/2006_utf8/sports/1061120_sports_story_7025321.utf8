Miyazaki: Shiv Kapurs putting magic returned at the right time as he birdied three of the last five holes to finish with his first under-par card of the week and finish tied 13th at the Dunlop Phoenix tournament. 

Kapur, who has had a great year, carded a final round of two-under 68 to total one-over 281. 

The young Indian had a birdie on the second after which he three-putted on fourth for a bogey. He had another bogey on seventh and then suddenly his putting touch seemed to have returned on the 14th as he single putted for birdies on 14th, 16th and 18th to climb to two-under 68 for tied 13th. 

Irelands Padraig Harrington upset Tiger Woods to win the crown after an astonishing birdie on the second play-off hole. 

Harrington, the 2006 European Order of Merit winner, courageously blasted his second shot through a perilously narrow gap in a Y-shaped tree after hooking his tee shot left. 

His ball caught the base of the gap and ricocheted upwards, advancing the Irishman 120 yards. Harrington then produced a superb pitch to within two feet to set up an easy birdie. 

Woods, who was bidding for a hattrick of titles in Miyazaki, missed a 12-foot birdie putt and Harrington completed a simple tap-in to win the $1.7 million tournament. 

When you come up against Tiger, youve got to take whatever opportunities are presented, Harrington said of his risky second through the split trunks of the tree. 

I saw it as a great chance of hitting a spectacular shot to win the play-off and it came off. I definitely got lucky but sometimes fortune favours the brave. 

World No. 1 Woods began the final round tied with Harrington for the lead, but the American looked to be cruising to his 10th victory of the year after three early birdies. 

However, the momentum shifted suddenly when Harrington holed a long birdie putt on the par-four 16th and then Woods amazingly missed a three-foot par putt to leave them level. 

Both men holed parred 17 and sank short birdie putts on the 18th to card rounds of three-under-par 67 and finish at nine-under 271. 

After matching birdies on the last at the first play-off hole, the golfers returned to the 18th where Harrington went for broke after a poor tee shot to triumph against the odds.

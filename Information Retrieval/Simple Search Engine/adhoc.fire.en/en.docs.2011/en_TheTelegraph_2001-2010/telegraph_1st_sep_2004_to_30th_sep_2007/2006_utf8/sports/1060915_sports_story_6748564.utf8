The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pariyar happy to be back among goals

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Prasanta Banerjee has always been known for his deceptive left foot on the ground and a pleasant smile. But he rarely looked as relaxed as he was on Thursday after Bengals 8-1 triumph over Rajasthan in the Santosh Trophy. 

I have been given a team that is certainly not the best from the state, but my boys did a good job today, was his first reaction after the match. The first match is always difficult, whosoever the rivals be. I am happy that these youngsters showed that they were willing to prove themselves in the middle. 

The Bengal coach said he was satisfied with the performance of his midfielders and strikers and hoped the defenders would improve further. While a senior player like Sasthi (Duley) played his heart out, juniors like Bijoy (Basfore), Suman (Dutta), Ratan (Das) and Vimal (Pariyar) made me proud. 

Goalkeepers coach Tanumoy Bose said he was confident that this team would qualify for the last eight round. I am sure these boys would do a better job in the next few matches, he said. 

Pariyar said he was happy to be back among goals. The ground condition was not the best, but I never lost my concentration. Scoring a hattrick is always a pleasure and doing it for Bengal gives you extra satisfaction.

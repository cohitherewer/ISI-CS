The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rahul, Priyanka wont make it to Karachi 

 - A formal letter of regret (to the PCB) has gone, says Rajeev Shukla

Calcutta: With Gandhi siblings Rahul and Priyanka not making it to Mondays ODI in Lahore, there was speculation they would do a repeat of 2004 and at least watch the Karachi face-off, on Sunday. 

However, that wont happen as theyve conveyed their regrets to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which invited them last month itself. 

On the last tour, too, the invitation had gone from the PCB. Once it was accepted, Islamabad accorded them the status of state guests. 

A formal letter of regret has gone? Owing to other engagements, neither Rahul nor Priyanka can go even to Karachi, MP Rajeev Shukla told The Telegraph on Wednesday. 

The PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan, had routed the invitation through Shukla during his trip to New Delhi ahead of Team Indias tour. 

Realistically, though, the PCB was only expecting the siblings (as also Priyankas husband Robert Vadra) to watch either the third ODI or the final one, in Karachi. 

Pakistans commercial capital had, of course, hosted the first ODI on the last tour. While Team India scored on the field (at the National Stadium), the charming Priyanka was a huge hit off it. 

Anybody who was a somebody queued up outside the Chairmans Box and one remembers security personnel (including our own SPG) having a tough time as everybody wanted a glimpse of Priyanka. 

She spoke little, but that didnt matter. 

Rahul (who became an MP soon after the last tour) and Priyanka, by the way, are fans of Sachin Tendulkar.

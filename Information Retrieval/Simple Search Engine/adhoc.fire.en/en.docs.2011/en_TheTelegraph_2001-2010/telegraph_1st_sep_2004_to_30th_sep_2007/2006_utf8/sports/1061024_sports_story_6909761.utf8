 I have plans for Lara: Harbhajan 

Ahmedabad: Ace off-spinner Harbhajan Singh on Monday threw a challenge to the West Indies captain Brian Lara, saying he had a plan up his sleeve to unsettle the Trinidadian during their Champions Trophy match on Thursday. 

Every team and bowler will have some plans to get Lara out. Definitely, I have some plans for him, Harbhajan said after a practice match on Monday. I am really looking forward to bowl to the Caribbean batsmen, particularly Lara, he added. 

If I can get him out that will be great. Lets see what happens, the 26-year-old offie said. 

Harbhajan has so far plotted the dismissal of 18 West Indies batsmen in one-day games and Lara has been his victim on two occasions.

 Argentina clear favourites

 - Borgetti fitness a big boost for Mexico 

Leipzig: Argentina need to rediscover their goal power when they take on Latin American rivals Mexico in the second round of the World Cup at the Zentralstadion on Saturday. 

The twice former champions were held 0-0 by the Netherlands in their final Group C match on Wednesday and will be looking to find the net again with the ease of their 6-0 rout of Serbia amp; Montenegro a week ago. 

Argentina, with an 8-1 goal record in three group games and two players on two goals apiece in striker Hernan Crespo and Maxi Rodriguez, are favourites to reach the last eight. 

Mexico have only reached the quarter finals in the two World Cups they hosted and came to Germany expecting to improve their record abroad. But their finishing has been so poor they only scraped into the knockout phase. 

We will continue to insist on working on our finishing (in practice), Mexicos Argentine coach Ricardo La Volpe said after they lost their last Group D match 1-2 to Portugal. 

Captain Rafael Marquez said: The team continue to show poise and character...we have a new opportunity now and we cant let it slip. 

The two Latin American nations have only met once before in the World Cup when Argentina won 6-3 in the inaugural tournament in Uruguay in 1930. 

They have, however, played each other in numerous friendlies and in the Copa America, to which Mexico have been invited regularly since 1993. Argentina beat Mexico in the 1993 Copa America final in Ecuador but lost 0-1 to them in the group stage in the last tournament in Peru in 2004. 

Mexico will not be at all easy opponents, defender Roberto Ayala said.They have the same chances as us. Well try to prevent them from being comfortable on the ball and when we attack, attempt the variety of options we have showed up to now. 

La Volpes team had a good Confederations Cup in Germany a year ago when they reached the semi-finals and only went out to Argentina on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time. 

Argentina will have to bring in Fabricio Coloccini after right back Nicolas Burdisso was injured on Wednesday. 

Mexico got a huge boost when leading all-time scorer Jared Borgetti was passed fit. The 32-year-old Bolton Wanderers striker suffered a left calf injury which saw him forced off early in the second-half of the opening 3-1 victory over Iran. 

Brazilian-born Antonio Naelson Zinha should replace the suspended Luis Perez, who was sent off on Wednesday. Ayala complained on Thursday about the short time Argentina had to prepare for their second-round match with Mexico on Saturday. 

Probable teams 

Argentina: 1-Roberto Abbondanzieri; 4-Fabricio Coloccini, 2-Roberto Ayala, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 3-Juan Pablo Sorin; 18-Maxi Rodriguez, 8-Javier Mascherano, 5-Esteban Cambiasso, 10-Juan Roman Riquelme; 7-Javier Saviola, 9-Hernan Crespo 

Mexico: 1-Oswaldo Sanchez; 16-Mario Mendez, 4-Rafael Marquez, 5-Ricardo Osorio, 3-Carlos Salcido, 14-Gonzalo Pineda; 6-Gerardo Torrado, 7-Antonio Naelson Zinha, 8-Pavel Pardo; 9-Jared Borgetti, 17-Jose Francisco Fonseca

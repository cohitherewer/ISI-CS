 Chelsea edge Spurs 2-1

London: France defender William Gallas smashed a superb stoppage-time winner to give champions Chelsea a 2-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur in London derby at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. 

Chelsea, knocked out of the Champions Leagues last 16 by Barcelona in midweek, took a deserved lead through Ghana midfielder Michael Essien after 14 minutes. 

Midfielder Jermaine Jenas equalised just before halftime before Gallas blasted in a curling shot from 25 metres in the second minute of stoppage time for the Premier League leaders. 

Victory moved Jose Mourinhos side ever closer to retaining their title. They have 75 points and an 18-point lead over Manchester United, who have two games in hand before hosting Newcastle United on Sunday. 

Chelsea are also bidding for a domestic double with an FA Cup quarter final against Newcastle on March 22. 

Looking back to their European exit at the Nou Camp, Chelsea captain John Terry said a news channel: Everyone was disappointed, but weve all picked ourselves up in training in the week.

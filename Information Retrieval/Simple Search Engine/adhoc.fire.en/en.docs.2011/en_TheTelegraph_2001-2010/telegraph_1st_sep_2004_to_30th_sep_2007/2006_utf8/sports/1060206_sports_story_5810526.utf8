 Aussies whip SA by 57 runs

Sydney: Australia crushed South Africa by 57 runs on Sunday in another lop-sided tri-series one-day International at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The Australians, rapidly approaching the peak of their powers with the finals about to start next week, plundered a record total of 344 for six against the Proteas, and then restricted the visitors to 287 for six in reply. 

Adam Gilchrist (88), Damien Martyn (79) and Ricky Ponting (72) each smashed half-centuries as the World Champions went on a batting rampage, registering the highest score by any country against South Africa and the second-highest total by any team in a ODI at Sydney. 

When we get those sort of totals were always going to be hard to chase down, Ponting said at the post-match presentation. 

All our batters are looking good and the bowling and fielding has improved as well... so were in really good shape going into the finals.

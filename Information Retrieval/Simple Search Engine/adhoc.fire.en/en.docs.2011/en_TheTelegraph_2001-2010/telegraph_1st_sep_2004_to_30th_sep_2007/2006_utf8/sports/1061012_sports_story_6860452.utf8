Jaipur: The West Indies opener Chris Gayle lashed 104 not out as the defending champions crushed Bangladesh by 10 wickets to ease into the main round of the Champions Trophy on Wednesday. 

The 27-year-old left-hander neatly paced his innings to reach his 13th one-day hundred and spur the West Indies to 164 without loss with 13.2 overs remaining after Bangladesh had been dismissed for 161. 

Jamaican Gayle struck 11 fours and three huge sixes from 118 deliveries, racing past fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who made 52 not out. 

The West Indies, who beat Zimbabwe by nine wickets in their first game of the four-team qualifying league, joined Sri Lanka in the eight-team main round with a game to spare. 

The two teams meet in their final game in Mumbai on Saturday. Bangladesh and Zimbabwe play an inconsequential tie on Friday. Definitely there was certain difference of a class (between the two teams) and we showed that, Brian Lara later said. 

The West Indies captain also praised Gayles allround contribution and predicted a good run for the West Indies and Sri Lanka in the tournament. 

Chris is a tremendous player, he said. He is one of the best all rounders of the world. 

Gayle won the man-of-the-match award for the second game in a row, after scoring 41 and taking three wickets against Zimbabwe. 

Gayle showed a glimpse of his hard-hitting soon after completing his half century off 78 balls and completed his 13th ODI century consuming further 38 deliveries and hitting 11 fours and three sixes in his undefeated knock. 

Earlier, after electing to bat first, Bangladesh failed to capitalise on a blazing 85-run second wicket partnership off 93 balls between Aftab Ahmed (59) and Shahriar Nafees (38) as eight of their batsmen failed to score in double figures. 

It was a bad game for us, conceded Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar. 

I feel it was a mixture of good bowling and bad batting from us which is really not acceptable as we were 95 for one at one stage, he added. 

Medium fast Dwayne Bravo ran through the Bangladesh tail-end and took career best 3-14 off his disciplined 10-over unchanged spell. It included an athletic, low one-handed catch off his follow through that dismissed Mashrafe Mortaza (7). 

Ahmed had an opportunity when Marlon Samuels could not judge the hook shot and dropped him on 15 in the deep. Ahmed hit the aggrieved bowler paceman Jerome Taylor for a six and then flicked left-arm seamer Ian Bradshaw for maximum runs at square leg. 

Ahmed took 40 balls to complete his half century with seven boundaries and two sixes before Bangladesh lost their way and four wickets tumbled in as many overs. 

Nafees was smartly caught by Chris Gayle in the lone slip position off Samuels gentle off-spin in the 20th over and Corey Collymore struck twice in the next over. 

Collymore the only change into the West Indies side that crushed Zimbabwe by nine wickets on Sunday uprooted Saqibul Hasans off-stump and Bashar was out lbw off the next delivery to record his second successive duck of the tournament. 

Ahmed attempted to hit Samuels for a six over long on, only to see Shivnarine Chanderpaul take a well judged catch that gave Samuels his second wicket of the innings as Bangladesh lost five wickets for 107 by the half way mark. 

 Bangladesh retained the same playing XI that went 

 down by 37 runs in their opening qualifier against Sri Lanka 

 last Saturday.

 HIGHS AND LOWS

 Following are a few statistical 

 highlights of the ICC Champions Trophy qualifier between 

 the West Indies and Bangladesh at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium 

 on Wednesday:

 The West Indies became the first team to record a 10-wicket 

 win in the event.

 The Caribbeans registered their seventh successive win in 

 the meet the first team to do so.

 Chris Gayles 13th century is his first in the Champions 

 Trophy. His previous highest in this competition was 99 

 against Bangladesh at Rose Bowl in September 2004.

 Gayle is the third West Indian to post a hundred in the 

 tournament, joining Phil Wallace and Brian Lara.

 Shivnarine Chanderpaul posted his 40th fifty. His aggregate 

 is now 328 in nine matches, equalling the previous best 

 for the West Indies in the tournament, held by Ricardo Powell.

 Habibul Bashars first-ball duck is his second successive 

 one. Against Sri Lanka at Mohali in October this year, he 

 had recorded a second-ball duck.

 Bashars tally of 16 ducks is a record for Bangladesh. 

 Mohammed Rafique is second with 13.

 Bashars seven ducks as captain, are however, less 

 than Arjuna Ranatunga (14), Stephen Fleming (11), Sourav 

 Ganguly (9), Wasim Akram (8), Steve Waugh (8), Sanath Jayasuriya 

 (8) and Shaun Pollock (8).

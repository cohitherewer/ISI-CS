The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 A brilliant 124 by Manoj Tewari helped Kalighat pile up 351 for eight, six runs short of Sporting Union?s first innings total, on the Day II of the A.N. Ghosh final at the Eden on Wednesday.

 Manoj was ably supported by Deep Dasgupta (44) and Soham Ghosh (43). Sporting Union ?keeper Manoj Shaw suffered an injury after the ball bounced awkwardly and hit just below his right eye. Avishek Jhunjhunwala then replaced Shaw behind the stumps.

 With a day still to go, the match is evenly poised, as both the teams would have to play 40 overs each on the final day. 

 BRIEF SCORES

 Sporting Union 357/9. Kalighat 351/8 (Manoj Tewari 124, Deep Dasgupta 44, Soham Ghosh 43).

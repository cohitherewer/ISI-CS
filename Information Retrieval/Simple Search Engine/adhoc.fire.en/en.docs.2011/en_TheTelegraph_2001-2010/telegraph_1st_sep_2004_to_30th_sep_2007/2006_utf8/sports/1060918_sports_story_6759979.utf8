 BCCI not in favour of ACC shift to Dubai

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) isnt in favour of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) headquarters being shifted from here to Dubai. The International Cricket Council has already moved to the Emirate. 

Were aware of the offer from Dubai Sports City, but arent in favour of shifting from Kuala Lumpur, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Sunday afternoon, before returning home, he added: No matter how good the offer, nobody should forget that Dubai is very expensive... The ACC is doing fine here... 

The BCCI, it may be noted, carries the maximum clout within the ACC.

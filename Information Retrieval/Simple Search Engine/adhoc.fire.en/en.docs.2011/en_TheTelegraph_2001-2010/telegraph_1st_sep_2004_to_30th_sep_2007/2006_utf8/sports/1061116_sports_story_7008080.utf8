The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting to start as underdogs today

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Durand Cup 

 Okoros availability is uncertain 

New Delhi: Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick is upset with too many things at the moment. Having arrived in the capital late on Tuesday night, the seasoned coach said there are quite a few factors that might handicap his teams chances in the Durand Cup. 

The fixture is completely against our interest, said Bhowmick. On Thursday, we play Air India. Next day, we have again been drawn to play Assam Rifles. And if we make the quarter finals, then we will have to take the field on Sunday again. This is ridiculous and against the interest of the game. 

Bhowmick has a point as Mohammedan Sporting are the only team in the tournament who have been asked to play on consecutive days. But he has no one to blame when it comes to the weak composition of his own team. 

Yes, I am likely to go into tomorrows match against Air India without a foreign footballer, he said. I have been told that Mike Okoro might join the team here. I know nothing more than that. Let us see what happens, he said. Incidentally, Air India have recruited three Nigerians, who have been playing regularly in the Mumbai league. 

To add to Bhowmicks woe, two of his key players K. Kulothungan and Farooq Haider were arrested by police in Calcutta and released on bail only a couple of days ago for causing trouble in the residential area under drunken state. Both players were eventually dropped from the squad, but the coach felt the incident was blown out of proportion by the media. The reporting was one sided and nobody highlighted the players cause, he rued. 

All said and done, Mohammedan will take the field on Thursday as underdogs. The team has a good support base at the Ambedkar Stadium, but a poor track in Durand Cup. The only time they could win the trophy was way back in 1940. Given the circumstances, the famous black and white brigade are unlikely to write a new chapter this time.

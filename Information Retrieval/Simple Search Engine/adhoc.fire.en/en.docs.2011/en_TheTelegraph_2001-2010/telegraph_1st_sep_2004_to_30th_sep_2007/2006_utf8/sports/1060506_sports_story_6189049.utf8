 Dont repeat Beckham error, warns Ferguson 

 TIM RICH

Manchester United have been here before. Four years ago, the nation held its breath as its iconic footballer struggled to overcome a broken metatarsal, and to this day Sir Alex Ferguson is convinced David Beckham should not have gone to the 2002 World Cup. 

In the fifth day of impassioned debate on whether Wayne Rooney could or should play any part in Germany , the Manchester United manager argued it was important England did not repeat past mistakes of rushing a player back too quickly. 

Beckham, whose metatarsal was broken by Deportivo La Corunas Aldo Duscher in a European Cup quarter final in early April, resumed full training just five days before Eng-lands opening group game against Sweden ? 48 days after the original challenge. 

Ferguson said Beckhams decision to fly to Dubai for a pre-tournament get-together only harmed the England captains cause. 

Englands opening World Cup fixture is 36 days away, and Ferguson added: We must not rush Wayne back too early. The boy wouldnt do himself justice, and that would be an even bigger disappointment for England fans.

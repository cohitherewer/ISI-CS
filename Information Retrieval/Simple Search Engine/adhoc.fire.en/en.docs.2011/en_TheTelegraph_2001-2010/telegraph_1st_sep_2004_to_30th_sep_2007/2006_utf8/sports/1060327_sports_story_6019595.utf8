 Wind-blown Tiger battles brutal course

 Tuger Woods 

Ponte Vedra Beach: Tiger Woods battled to a one-over-par 73 in tough conditions at the Players Championship in Saturdays third round. 

The world No. 1, five off the pace at the start of the day, rattled up four birdies and five bogeys on a blustery Stadium Course to finish at two-under 214. 

Club selection was difficult in swirling winds at the TPC at Sawgrass and virtually every time Woods picked up a shot, he gave it back at the next hole. 

It was a lot harder today, the wind was blowing and swirling in the trees, the 30-year-old American told reporters after ending the round seven strokes behind leader Stephen Ames of Canada. 

On top of that, the greens are really inconsistent out there because the low spots are soft and the high spots are really firm. It depends where you land it. 

Woods, who has won three times in six tournaments this year, believes he has a chance of clinching a second Players title. Without a doubt, but a lot depends on the course conditions, he said. I need it to blow like this tomorrow and hopefully I can play a great round of golf. 

The 2001 champion had considered pulling out of the tournament earlier in the week because of his fathers failing health. The 74-year-old Earl Woods has been battling prostate cancer since 1998. 

Maybe I can sneak in there, Woods added. If you miss fairways here, youre going to make bogeys. The rough is six or eight inches (high) in spots. Its brutal. 

Canadas Stephen Ames recovered from an early double-bogey to edge one shot clear. Ames, who three-putted from 14 feet at the par-four fifth, fired a two-under-par 70 in the third round at the TPC at Sawgrass to finish at nine-under 207. 

That left him a stroke in front of world No. 2 Vijai Singh and sixth-ranked Sergio Garcia, who carded matching 70s.

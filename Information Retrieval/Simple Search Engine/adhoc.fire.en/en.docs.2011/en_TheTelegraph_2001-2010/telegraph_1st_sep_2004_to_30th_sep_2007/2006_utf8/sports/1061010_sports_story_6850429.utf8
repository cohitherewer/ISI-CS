 Harrington edges Dredge

St Andrews: Padraig Harrington capitalised on errors from overnight leader Bradley Dredge to win the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews Old Course on Sunday (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

Harrington is now in with a chance to win the European Tour Order of Merit as he lies second and with one tournament to go. The leader is Paul Casey. 

Harrington won as he birdied the 13th, which Dredge double-bogeyed to swung the momentum in the Irishmans favour. The Dubliner signed for 68 and an impressive aggregate of 16-under 271. 

Edward Loar ended his steady run in joint second place after firing a two-under-par 70. Loar, 28, blasted five birdies against three bogeys and claimed joint second spot alongside Englishman Anthony Wall and Welshman Dredge after a total of 11-under-par 276. He finished one stroke ahead of Ernie Els of South Africa, who shot a similar score in the final round.

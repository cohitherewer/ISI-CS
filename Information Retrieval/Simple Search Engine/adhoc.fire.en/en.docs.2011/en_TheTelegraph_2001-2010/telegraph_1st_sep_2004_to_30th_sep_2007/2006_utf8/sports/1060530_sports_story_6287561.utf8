 Rooney scan now on June 7

Wayne Rooney will have a second scan on his broken foot on June 7, rather than June 14, so that England can still pick a replacement if he is ruled out of the World Cup. 

Rooney was due to fly out to Germany with the England squad next Monday before returning to Manchester ten days later to have the CT scan, which would determine whether or not he will be able to take any part in the competition. 

However, following a meeting between Sir Alex Ferguson, Sven-Goran Eriksson and the medical teams of both England and Manchester United at the Premiership teams Carrington training complex on Monday morning it has been decided to bring the scan forward by seven days. 

The move, which means Rooney will not now travel to Englands training base in Baden-Baden next Monday, offers Eriksson the flexibility to bring in a replacement. 

Following a meeting today (Monday) between Englands medical team and Manchester Uniteds medical team with both managers present it has been agreed to obtain a further precautionary CT scan on June 7 in order to help the England management to make a decision (on Rooneys fitness) before the deadline of June 9, a United statement said. Both parties agree that everything possible is being done to aid recovery of a fracture that involves the joint.

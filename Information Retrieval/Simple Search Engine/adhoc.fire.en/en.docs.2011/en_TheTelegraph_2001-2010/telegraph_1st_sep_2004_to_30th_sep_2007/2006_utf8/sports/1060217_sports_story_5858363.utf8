Bangalore: Indian Challenge ended in the singles event of the $175,000 Bangalore Open with wild-card Isha Lakhani losing to Ukraines Yuliana Fedak 3-6, 3-6 in the second round. 

Fedak, world No. 117, played a consistent game at the centre court of the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association courts and outplayed the world No. 480 to advance to the quarter finals of the WTA Tier-III event. 

Lakhani came back strongly after being down 0-2 in the opener and then levelled it 3-3 before running out of steam. She played well in patches but her opponent was more aggressive and played a more powerful game forcing the Indian on the backfoot. 

Its nice playing here, Fedak said. It was a tough match than the scoreline suggests. 

Fedak now takes on third seed and world No. 59 Mara Santengelo of Italy for a place in the semi-final. 

Santengelo and unseeded Maria Elena Camerin also moved into the quarter finals on this day. 

Twenty-four-year-old Santengelo, came from behind to sideline Tzipora Obziler of Israel 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at the Tier-III event at the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association courts. 

Giant-killer Camerin, who packed off second seed Shahar Peer of Israel on Wednesday, continued her good run to post a 6-1, 7-5 win over qualifier Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia. 

Sixth seeded Jelena Kostanic of Croatia also booked a quarter final berth with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Kaia Kanepi of Estonia, who had ousted Indias Ankita Bhambri in the first round. 

Indias Sania Mirza, Rushmi Chakravarthi and Ankita Bhambri have already lost. 

In other quarter finals, Camille Pin (France) will take on Vania King (US), Melinda Czink (Hungary) will meet Alona Bondarenko (Ukraine) and Jelena Kostanic (Croatia) will clash with Maria Elena Camerin.

 Federer, Ljubicic in summit clash

 - Miami Masters

 Miami: World No. 1 Roger Federer swept aside Spains David Ferrer 6-1, 6-4 in the semi-finals of the Miami Open on Friday, setting up a final clash with Ivan Ljubicic. 

Croatian Ljubicic reached his third final in six ATP events this season by routing third seed David Nalbandian 6-1, 6-2. 

Top seed Federer was in majestic form against Ferrer, claiming the opening set in less than 20 minutes and losing only four points on serve. 

The Swiss was tested briefly in the second, but powered back effortlessly from a break down, reaching 4-3 on a Ferrer double-fault and claiming victory three games later. 

I played well, in the first set I didnt give him any chances, Federer told reporters after improving to 27-1 in 2006. 

The second set was tighter, but his game suits me on hardcourt. Im playing so well that it was tough for him from the start. 

The final will mark the second meeting between Federer and Ljubicic in the space of a fortnight after the Swiss beat the 26-year-old Croat in the semi-finals at Indian Wells. 

Sixth seed Ljubicic clinched victory over Nalbandian with two successive aces, his 11th and 12th of the match. 

The loss will have sounded the alarm bells for Nalbandian with Argentina due in Zagreb next week for their Davis Cup quarter final. 

Everything went my way, Im serving fantastic and Im playing well, Ljubicic told reporters. Im moving well, I see the ball fantastically. Its really happening all positive for me. 

Ljubicic, who won trophies last year in Chennai and Zagreb, has been in sparkling form this season, registering 25 wins and three defeats. The Croat conceded only five points on serve against Nalbandian. 

Ive been serving well in my last two matches, Ljubicic said. He was in trouble all through the match. He had some kind of problem, he wasnt moving well. 

 Meanwhile, Frances Tatiana Golovin will be out for six weeks with torn ankle ligaments. The injury means Golovin will miss Frances April 22-23 Fed Cup first round tie against Italy in Nancy. 

Golovin went to the hospital to have her injured left ankle examined after being forced to retire from the Miami Open semi-final against Russian Maria Sharapova on Thursday. (Reuters)

 Johl finishes tied third

 - Korea Golf 

 - Suk Jong-Ryul lifts title 

 Johl had a final round of five-under par 67 

Seoul: Indias Amandeep Johl finished with a hattrick of birdies to take a share of the third place in the $ 600,000 GS Caltex Maekyung Open Golf Championship at the Lakeside Country Club here on Sunday. 

Johl ended three short of Koreas Suk Jong-Ryul who emerged as the winner with a final round of five-under par 67. 

The Indian, tied eighth overnight, shot a bogey-free six-under 66 that saw him go up the leaderboard and finish at 14-under 274 for the week. He picked up $ 34,375 for his effort. 

The 38-year-old Suk, who came through the qualifying school this year, fired a near flawless final round to pip American Bryan Saltus, who also closed with a 67. 

Suk, who amassed a four-day total of 17-under-par 271, took home a cheque of $ 125,000. Jong-Ryul (67) birdied the final hole to avoid a play-off and beat Saltus by one shot. 

Overnight leader Lee Sung of Korea faded on the back nine for a closing 72 to share third place with Johl and local amateur Noh Seung-Yul, who carded matching 66. 

Gaurav Ghei made a brave recovery after a disastrous 10 on the par-four fourth hole to shoot a 72 that saw him finish tied 25th. 

Ghei, who went out of bounds and also into the water on the hole, made no other mistakes during the day, which before that nightmarish hole had produced one birdie and five after that for a total of five-under 283. 

Rahil Gangjee (75) had just one birdie and four bogeys and ended tied 69th at four-over 292. 

Johl hit the ball extremely well, but his putting was a bit of a let down. He needed 29 putts, despite getting to 83 per cent greens in regulation. 

He missed birdies on both par-fives on the back nine after a fine front nine in which he had three birdies. Coming to the 16th tee, he was barely squeezing into top-10 at 11-under. Then he went on a birdie spree with three in a row on his last three holes. 

Johl opened with a birdie on the par-four first hole and then added two more on the par-five sixth and ninth holes to turn in three-under. Then the birdies ran out despite him getting to the greens in regulation. He was not able to get the putts to fall for birdies before the final rush of three birdies. 

Ghei, placed 19th overnight, seemed set for a good charge when he opened with a birdie on first hole. But his whole tournament seemed to have gone for a toss when he came out with a dreaded double digit 10 on the fourth. 

Still he showed great courage to fight back and get five birdies, one each on all four par-fives and one on par-3 15th for a 72 that gave him a card of 72 and tied 25th place. 

Gangjee, going fine for the first two days, once again succumbed to the weekend blues and disappeared down the leaderboard with 76 and 75 on final two days.

Sydney: The Australian and English teams were both hit by injury scares on Friday, just six days before the start of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane. 

England fast bowler Steve Harmison pulled out of the tourists three-day match against South Australia in Adelaide because of a side-strain. 

Australian middle-order batsman Damien Martyn then withdrew from Western Australias one-day match against Queensland in Perth with an elbow problem, while allrounder Shane Watson limped off the field in the same match after injuring his hamstring while bowling. 

Western Australian team officials said Martyn would definitely be available for the Brisbane Test, but there were some concerns about Harmison and Watson. 

Harmison complained of feeling stiffness in his side when he woke up in the morning. He bowled in the nets before the match in Adelaide but was told to play it safe and was replaced by Sajid Mahmood. 

England coach Duncan Fletcher said later that Harmison was taken to hospital for scans and a painkilling injection, and there were fears he could miss the series opener. 

Hes not guaranteed for Brisbane with that problem hes had before, Fletcher said in Adelaide. So well just have too see how this injection goes and what effect it has on him. 

Were not going to guarantee it, but were planning if hes fine tomorrow (Saturday) and its not as bad as it was, well give him a bowl and see how he feels with it. 

Watson will be assessed by the Australian teams medical staff when he arrives in Brisbane on Saturday. The 25-year-old was bowling the first ball of his sixth over for Queensland when he pulled up sharply, clutching the back of his right leg.

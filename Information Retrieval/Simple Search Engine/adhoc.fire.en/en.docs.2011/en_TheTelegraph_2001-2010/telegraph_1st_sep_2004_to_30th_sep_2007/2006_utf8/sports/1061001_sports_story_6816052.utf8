 Gangjee keeps lead

Taipei: Rahil Gangjee scored a battling even par round of 72 to keep a one shot lead over the rest of the field after the third round of the $500,000 Mercuries Masters golf tournament at the Tamsui Golf Club here on Saturday. 

Gangjee has been consistent in the last few starts and last week he finished third despite a bogey-bogey finish in the final round. 

In the second round here, he was thrust as the leader after compatriot S.S.P. Chowrasia was disqualified for not signing his scorecard when leading by five shots after two rounds. 

The Indian is now eight-under and one shot ahead of local man Liang Wen Hong, who sizzled the course with an eight-under 64 on third day. In the third place was another Taipei player Lin Wen Tang (67) at six-under for 54 holes. He was tied for third with Ted Oh (72). (PTI)

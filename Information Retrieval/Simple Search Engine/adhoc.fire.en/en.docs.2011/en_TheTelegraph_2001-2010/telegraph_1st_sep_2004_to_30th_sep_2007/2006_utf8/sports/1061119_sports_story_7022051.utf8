Multan: West Indies skipper Brian Lara is hoping his side can help Shivnarine Chanderpaul celebrate his 100th m atch with a win over Pakistan in the second Test starting on Sunday. 

It is a big achievement to play 100 Tests for your country. Hopefully we can make it a special one for Shiv by beating Pakistan and levelling the (three-match) series, Lara said on Saturday. 

Lara said his players fully understood they had not been competitive in Lahore and wanted to put that behind them and make amends in the second match. Pakistan have always been a very good side at home and we are under no illusions what we have to do to come back in the series. 

West Indies have not won a Test series in Pakistan since 1981. They are not expected to make any changes in their line-up but Pakistan are looking at playing uncapped left-arm pacer Samiullah Niazi in place of Abdul Razzaq on a pitch which the home sides bowling coach Waqar Younis said had juice in it.

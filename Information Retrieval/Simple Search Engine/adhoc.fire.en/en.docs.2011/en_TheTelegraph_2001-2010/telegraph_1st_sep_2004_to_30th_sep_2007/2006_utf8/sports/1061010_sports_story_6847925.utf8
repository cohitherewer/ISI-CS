The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Debrecen (Hungary): Lornah Kiplagat of The Netherlands will receive a bonus of $50,000 (euro 40,000) for setting a world record in the womens 20km road race.

 Kiplagat, who moved to The Netherlands from Kenya in 2003, finished in 1::3:21.00 to win Sundays inaugural IAAF World Road Running Championships. She broke the record of 1:03:26, set by Paula Radcliffe of Britain on October 6, 2001, in Bristol.

 Kiplagat will receive the bonus even though Sundays race was not part of the IAAFs World Record Program, the IAAF said on Monday.

 San Jose: Kenyas Duncan Kibet won the Rock n Roll half-marathon on Sunday in 1::00:22 seconds, the second-fastest time in the 21.1km (13.1 mile) event ever in the US. The 28-year-olds time is second only to Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia, who set the world record of 58:55 on January 15 in Tempe, Arizona.

 Russias Silvia Skvortsova won the womens race, pulling away over the final mile to edge Edna Kiplagat of Kenya in a personal best 1::09:17.

Sainsbury, a lecturer in geriatric health at the Christchurch School of Medicine, was expected to make a full recovery, Pearcy said.

 Sao Paulo: Striker Souza scored his league-leading 15th goal to lead Goias 3-1 over defending champion Corinthians, who dropped into the relegation zone in the Brazilian championship on Sunday.

 Jhulan: We wanted to prove ourselves

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Jhulan Goswami had a 10-wicket match haul 

Calcutta: Jhulan Goswami, whose 10-wicket match haul helped India script history in womens cricket in Taunton on Friday winning their first-ever Test series against England (as reported in Saturdays late City edition) has attributed the success to proper planning. 

According to the Bengal pacer, who was adjudged both Woman of the Match and Woman of the Series, the team was determined to come back after a humiliating loss in ODIs. 

We had prepared well at the camp at Infosys Mysore it helped us. We planned well for the matches, she was quoted as saying in a WCAI release on Saturday. 

Every time I was given the ball, I wanted to provide a breakthrough to the team. Also, the ODI loss was humiliating and we wanted to prove ourselves, she added. 

England began the final day of the second Test in a fairly strong position at 207 for 2. But like the first innings (five for 33), Jhulan once again proved the wrecker-in-chief, taking five more wickets for 45. England eventually were bundled out for 305 runs. Chasing a target of 98 in 31 overs, India started badly, losing Rumeli Dhar for 4. But Karuna Jain (34) and Mithali Raj (22 not out) ensured Indias five-wicket victory after the initial hiccups. 

Jhulan, who was nursing an injury, ended up with 15 wickets in two Tests and this was the third consecutive Test in which she got the Woman of the Match award.

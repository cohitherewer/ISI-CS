New York: Indian ace Jeev Milkha Singh shot a steady three-over-par 73 as he was in joint 28th position after the first round at the US Open on Thursday. 

Jyoti Randhawa, the other Indian in the fray, frittered away a solid start and stumbled to a 77 for a tied 90th position. 

Scottish sensation Colin Montgomerie was all smiles after firing four birdies against three bogeys as he led the first round with a 69. 

Defending champion Michael Campbell was in tied 52nd spot after a 75. 

Former Asian Tour regular Ted Purdy, however, struggled with a 78 as he was in joint 112th position. 

Korean star Choi Kyung-ju was three strokes behind Jeev when he shot a 76 in joint 68th spot alongside 21 other players that included world No. 1 Tiger Woods. 

Jeev, the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit leader, fired one birdie, two bogeys and was tied alongside local talent Kent Jones, Fred Couples, Zach Johnson, Skip Kendal and Tim Herron, Aussies Mark Hensby, Rod Pampling and Robert Allenby, Irishman Padraig Harrington, and Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland. 

The Indian stalwart earned his spot in the years second major when he qualified in England earlier this month. 

Jeev kept his cool under the challenging conditions at Mamaroneck when he teed off on the 10th hole. He shot a double bogey at the lengthy par five 12th hole and dropped a shot on the 16th hole. 

The 34-year-old struck another bogey on the third hole but returned with a birdie on the fifth hole. His solid putts on the greens saw him par the remaining four holes. 

 Woods looked likely to end his record streak of making 

 cuts at the major championships when he shot a six-over-par 

 76 in Round II on Friday. Woods posted two double bogeys 

 and three bogeys against a lone birdie for a second successive 

 76 that put him at 12-over-par 152, 13 strokes behind co-leaders 

 Steve Stricker and Colin Montgomerie. 

I am happy with the way I played as I putted really well today, said Jeev on Thursday. The course is tough, even the greens are difficult but it is the same for everybody playing here. 

My first round was a bit edgy but the highlight for me today was how well I chipped and putted, he said. 

Apart from his fans, Jeev has been made to feel right at home by his parents who flew into New York together with his two sisters who live in the Big Apple. 

I am feeling good. I am definitely happy with my first round performance, said Jeev. 

Montgomerie, still chasing his first major victory, upstaged Masters champion Phil Mickelson by taking a one-shot lead. 

The 42-year-old Scot birdied three of the last 10 holes to complete a one-under-par 69 on a difficult, blustery day at Winged Foot Golf Club where the average score was 75.98. 

Mickelson, bidding for a third consecutive major title, had to settle for a five-way share of second place after scrambling to a 70 that included two birdies and two bogeys. 

Level with the American left-hander were compatriots Jim Furyk and Steve Stricker, Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez and Britains David Howell, who got to four under with four holes to play before slipping back. 

Making his tournament return after a nine-week break following the death of his father, Woods struggled with his putting and accuracy off the tee, setting the tone for his day by bogeying the first three holes. 

Twenty-two players carded 80 or worse and the first-round scoring average was the highest at a US Open since the 77.8 at Shinnecock Hills in 1986.

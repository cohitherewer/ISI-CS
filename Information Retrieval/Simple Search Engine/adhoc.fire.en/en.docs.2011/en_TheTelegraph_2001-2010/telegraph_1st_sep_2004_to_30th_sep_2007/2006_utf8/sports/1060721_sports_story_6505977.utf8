Hoylake: British qualifier Graeme McDowell fired a flawless six-under-par 66 to take a one-shot lead after a calm day of low scoring at the 135th British Open on Thursday. 

The Northern Irishman reeled off three consecutive birdies from the ninth, where he holed out from a bunker, before overhauling early pacesetters Greg Owen and Anthony Wall of Britain and Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez. 

Former champions Ernie Els and Tom Lehman, plus Spaniard Sergio Garcia were among a group of nine tied for second place. 

Determined to shake off a loss of form following a knee injury last season, South African Els wasted a chance to birdie the par-five last after being bunkered off the tee and had to settle for a 68. 

Masters champion Phil Mickelson, eager to banish memories of his final-hole meltdown at last months US Open, mixed four birdies with an eagle and three bogeys to finish a further stroke back, along with eight others. 

Overnight rain took some of the sting out of a Royal Liverpool layout baked rock-hard after weeks of unrelenting sunshine. 

Defending champion Tiger Woods, starting later when the most of the moisture had gone, was one-under at the turn having dropped a shot at the first but found birdies on five and nine. 

Els, champion at Muirfield in 2002, rattled up six birdies and two bogeys to make his best Open start since shooting a 66 at St Andrews in 2000. 

I didnt play the last hole very well but its always nice to make a par-saving putt, the South African said. 

Ill settle for four under. Im swinging well and today was a pretty good score for me. 

Its the first round of a major championship and you definitely dont want to shoot yourself out of it the first day. 

Its not the hardest course weve ever played because of the weather but theres enough trouble out there, added the world No.8, who was sidelined for four months at the end of last year after twisting his knee on a sailing holiday. 

Els finished level with Garcia, Lehman, Jim Furyk, Australians Marcus Fraser and Mark Hensby, South Koreas SK Ho, Canadas Mike Weir and Mikko Ilonen of Finland. 

Englishman Owen, who led the 2001 Open at Royal Lytham after 35 holes, reeled off six birdies and a bogey to set the initial pace with a round that looked better the longer the day went on. 

I was very calm out there and played really well, he said after picking up shots on four of the last six holes. 

I think Ive learned to stay patient and just trust what I do. If the golf gods are in my favour, then Ill be good enough to win. 

Wall, whose father is a London taxi cab driver, joined Owen at five under after being boosted by eagles at the 10th and 16th. 

The key here is to hit the fairways because there are birdie shots there, he said. But the bunkering here is as good as anywhere in the world and I think if you start to be too greedy, you will come a cropper. 

Spaniard Garcia, who tied for fifth in last years Open championship at St Andrews, was in upbeat mood after matching his lowest opening round at the Open. 

Im pretty happy with it, he said after collecting two birdies over the last three holes. I feel that my putting is starting to come back and I putted nicely on the front nine. 

My game is not quite where I want it to be but its getting there. It was a pretty comfortable day out there. 

The scheduled start of the 135th Open championship was put back by half an hour because of thunderstorms. 

Lehman, who captured the coveted Claret Jug at Royal Lytham 10 years ago, said: Any round with no bogeys is always pleasing and today was that way with four birdies. 

I drove the ball great all day long. From the very beginning until the very end I put the ball in the right spot, the 47-year-old American told reporters. 

But Lehman knows he needs a good week on the greens to keep flying high on the leaderboard. 

It all hinges on the putter, he said.I hit the ball quite consistently but the putting has made me somewhat average at times. 

I feel confident over them, it is just they dont go in, said Lehman, whose last individual victory was at the 2000 Phoenix Open. 

Lehman is competing in his sixth tournament of the season in Europe but, whatever he does as a player, thoughts inevitably turn to Septembers Ryder Cup match at the K Club in Ireland. 

That is almost all I hear about, he said. Nearly every person over here is saying we wish you luck this week...but not in September. 

Thats the standard comment I get, 100 a day, 200 a day, maybe more. 

Some of it goes back and forth too and I will come back with something like at least youll get a top-two finish. It is all in good fun. quot;

 Federer in semi-finals

Basel: Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka dumped Argentine second seed David Nalbandian out of the Swiss Indoor tournament with a deserved 7-6, 6-2 quarter-final victory on Friday. 

Having spent much of the week in the shadow of world No. and Basel countryman Roger Federer, Wawrinka grabbed a share of the limelight with a blistering performance against the world No. 3. 

The win puts Wawrinka on course for a possible final meeting with Federer, who beat Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer 6-3, 7-6 (16-14) in the quarters. 

In the second round on Thursday, Federer crushed Spains Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-2, 6-0. 

Garcia-Lopez elected to concentrate on Federers backhand but the tactic was ruthlessly exploited as the Swiss sprayed the ball around the court at will to seal victory in 52 minutes. 

Its unbelievable how Im playing at the moment, Federer told reporters after clinching his 21st win in a row. I was surprised myself about how quickly the match went. 

World No. 15 Ferrer advanced with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory over Czech Jiri Novak, the 2004 champion. 

The Spaniard has lost all four previous meetings with Federer.

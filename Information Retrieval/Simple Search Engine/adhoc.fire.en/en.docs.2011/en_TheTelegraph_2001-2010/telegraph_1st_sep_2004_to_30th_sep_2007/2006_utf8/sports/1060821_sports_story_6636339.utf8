London: Wayne Rooney scored twice as Manchester United crushed Fulham 5-1 on Sunday while champions Chelsea began their Premier League title defence with a 3-0 home win over Manchester City. 

The two other probable title contenders, Arsenal and Liverpool, were both held 1-1 on Saturday. Villa spoilt Arsenals first match at their new Emirates Stadium and Liverpool needed a penalty equaliser to deny promoted Sheffield United a first-day win at Bramall Lane. 

On Sunday, Citys Italian striker Bernardo Corradi was sent off just past the hour for a late tackle on Michael Essien, having earlier been booked for a late challenge on Paulo Ferreira. 

Defender John Terry followed his first goal as England captain in midweek by heading home Arjen Robbens curling left-footed free kick from the right to put Chelsea ahead in the 11th minute. 

Terrys England colleague Frank Lampard, who also scored in the 4-0 win over Greece, struck the second in the 25th, taking a square ball from Essien and hitting a low shot that took a slight deflection off Richard Dunne. 

Striker Didier Drogba added a late third for Chelsea with a diving header from Wayne Bridges low cross from the left. 

Rooney, putting to the back of his mind the three-match suspension hanging over him, scored Uniteds third in the 16th minute and rounded off the scoring just past the hour from defender Wes Browns cross. 

The England striker will start a three-match ban on August 23 after being sent off during a pre-season tournament in Amsterdam. 

The young pairs embrace after Ronaldos goal showed they had put behind them the controversy over the Portuguese players alleged involvement in Rooneys sending off during Englands loss to Portugal on penalties in the World Cup quarter finals. 

Its proved that people who have been saying things about us dont know either of us, Rooney later said. We let our football do the talking and I thought Cristiano was brilliant and he scored a great goal.

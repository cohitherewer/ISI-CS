 Tough travel schedule for India

Kingston: Rahul Dravids men will arrive here Thursday with hopes of a rare win in the West Indies but a booby trap awaits them at the very first bend down the road. 

The team will have to travel to the extreme end of Jamaica to play a practice game on May 16. The distance from Kingston to Montego Bay, where the match is scheduled, is 200 km. 

That the Jamaican squad has eight Test players would be of little consolation to India as they would have to scoop itself out from Kingston and be marooned in Montego Bay for three days and then within 24 hours of arriving back in Kingston on Wednesday, they will take on the West Indies in the first ODI. 

It is a travel schedule which had been a secret to the Indian players. And it is nothing new. Its a goof-up which is common with the BCCI. In Zimbabwe last year, the team was left stranded in Harare when it should have been in Bulawayo and later, in Bulawayo when it should have been in Harare. (PTI)

 Exit for Agassi, Roddick 

 Los Angeles Open

 Los Angeles: Four-time 

 champion Andre Agassi bade an emotional farewell and fellow 

 American Andy Roddick, the top-seed, made a premature exit 

 from the Los Angeles Open on Friday.

 Agassi, who has said he will retire 

 after the US Open starting on August 28, lost his quarter 

 final match with Chiles Fernando Gonzalez, going out 

 4-6, 6-3, 5-7. Roddick, the world number 10 and highest-ranked 

 player in the draw, was forced to pull out of the hard court 

 event because of a muscle strain on his left side.

 The 2003 US Open champion incurred 

 the injury in his second-round match with fellow American 

 Scott Oudsema on Thursday. (Reuters)

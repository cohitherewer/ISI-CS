 Zaheer to try out new action 

 - I am a bit anxious... 

New Delhi: Having been recalled into the national squad, Zaheer Khan is banking on his new bowling style to deliver the goods during the gruelling tour of Pakistan which he admits could be the turning point of his career. 

The left-arm Baroda pacer said he would try out his remodelled bowling action for the first time in the international arena. 

I have reduced my run up... This tour will be the first international stage where I will bowl with a new action. I am a bit anxious and nervous but hope it will be okay, Zaheer said over the phone on Tuesday. 

My aim was to utilise the time to work on my skills. I needed to bowl a lot of overs because I was trying a few new things, said Zaheer, who was ignored for the home series against Sri Lanka and South Africa. 

Those fine tunings saw Zaheer emerge as the highest wicket-taker in Duleep Trophy this season, with 23 wickets from three matches at 12.52. 

He was also at his destructive best in Ranji Trophy where from four matches he picked up 20 wickets at 15.85 with a 10-wicket match haul against Punjab in the fifth round. 

Zaheer admitted that he was under pressure, but said he was confident of doing well Obviously it is a big tour. It is going to be tough. But I am confident, he said. (PTI)

 This has probably been my biggest injury

New Delhi: A decision on when Sachin Tendulkar would undergo a fitness test for the tri-series in Sri Lanka is likely to be made on Friday after the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials meet physio John Gloster. 

We will discuss Tendulkars fitness test with Gloster. A decision may be made tomorrow, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

The squad for the tri-series is slated to be picked in Mumbai on July 20 and it is speculated that Sachin may be included in the squad subject to his passing the fitness test at a later date. The tri-series, also involving South Africa, will be held during August 14 to 29. 

Captain Rahul Dravid will fly to Mumbai for the meeting of the five-member selection committee headed by former wicketkeeper Kiran More. 

However, coach Greg Chappell would not be able to attend the meeting as he is on a vacation following the tour of the West Indies where India lost the one-day series 1-4 but won the four-match Test series 1-0. 

However, the ace batsman looks to be fast on the road to recovery following a rehabilitation programme in the UK where he also turned out in five matches for a celebrity club. 

But Sachin himself refused to put a date to his return to action and said he would first undergo a fitness test to ascertain whether he could make the trip to Sri Lanka. 

I was in England for six weeks, undergoing a training programme and even played practice matches... I am feeling quite good, but cannot say now whether I will go or not (to Sri Lanka). There is a fitness test to be done, Sachin said at a press conference. 

He also pointed out that the current injury was the most challenging of all he had suffered in his 16-year career but denied he was rushing back from it. 

Thats why I did not go to the West Indies. Certain injuries need x-number of days to recover and you have to respect that, he said. 

I think probably this one (injury) is the biggest of all I have had. It has been tough, and taken a long time to fix it and get back into action. 

Sachin, who was here for a promotional event, said India played extremely well in the Caribbean. 

The one-dayers were disappointing but we made it up for it in Tests. We had couple of chances earlier (to win the series, in 1997 and 2002), but finally we have won, Sachin said. 

In the first and second Tests, we were a bit unlucky. But we showed in the fourth Test that perseverance pays off. 

He also didnt wish to go with the West Indies captain Brian Laras opinion that the Indians missed Sachin. 

Eventually 11 players play the game. An individual is not going to win the game on his own, but the team can, he said. 

Sachin, however, was all praise for Anil Kumble. Anil is a great player. He doesnt need to prove anything. He has shown great determination to be where he is now, with more than 500 wickets. He will walk into any team, he said.

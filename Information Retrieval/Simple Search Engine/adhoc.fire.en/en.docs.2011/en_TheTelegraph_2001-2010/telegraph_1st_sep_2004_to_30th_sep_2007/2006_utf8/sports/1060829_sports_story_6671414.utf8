Calcutta: Bengal boys won their opening match 37-29 against Assam in the 33rd Sub-Junior National Basketball Championship that got underway at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Monday. Ravi Swami and S. Chakraborty both scored eight points apiece for the winners while U.K. Sharma score 17 points for Assam. 

In another match of the boys section, Madhya Pradesh thrashed Chandigarh 82-6 with Kiriti Goswami scoring 24 points for the winners. 

Meanwhile, the participants from the other states, who reached the city on Monday morning, underwent a medical test, but eyebrows were still raised regarding the ages of some of them. We dont have the opportunity of fool-proof test and by doing these tests you cannot determine the age, an official, who chose to remain anonymous, said. 

 OTHER RESULTS 

Boys: Punjab bt Tamil Nadu 74-49, (Prabhjot Singh of Punjab was the top scorer with 20 points); Uttar Pradesh bt Maharashtra 80-31. Girls: Uttar Pradesh bt Jharkhand 44-41 (Disha Alok of Jharkhand was the top scorer with 14 points); Madhya Pradesh bt Delhi 32-13 (Meenakshi of MP was the top scorer with 14 points).

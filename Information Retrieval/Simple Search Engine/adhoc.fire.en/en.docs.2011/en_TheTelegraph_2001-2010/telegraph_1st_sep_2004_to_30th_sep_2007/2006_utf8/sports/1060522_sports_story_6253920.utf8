 Bravo West Indies, its 1-1

 - Hosts make Chappell eat his words; Team Indias run of successful chases comes to an end 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kingston:Sponsors Digicels 

 promotional Cricket? Its a West Indian thing 

 received a terrific boost when the hosts scripted a billion 

 watts music generating one-run win in the second ODI, 

 at Sabina Park, on Saturday. 

That ended Team Indias run of (17) successful chases and made it 1-1 in the five-match series. It was almost as close as on Thursday, with victory coming on the third-last ball. It confirmed that one-day cricket indeed is all about making the most of resources within the 100 overs. 

By defending 198, the West Indies made Greg Chappell eat his words on a day he completed one year as coach. After India took a 1-0 lead, hed said the hosts had forgotten to win... Had they been having little more success, they would have made it tougher... 

Credit to Brian Lara and his team, but the Indians batted very poorly. Whether the target is 299 or 199, a solid start is imperative. The visitors struggled from the first over ? a maiden from Fidel Edwards to captain Rahul Dravid ? and Yuvraj Singhs brilliant 93 (121 balls, 8x4, 1x6) became futile. 

The match could have gone the other way... God smiled on us, but weve got to keep improving, Lara remarked emotionally after his team completed a lap of honour in front of a frenzied crowd. It was as if the West Indies had regained the World Cup and some actually had tears of joy. 

While Ramnaresh Sarwan received the MoM award for his under-pressure unbeaten 98 (138 balls, 7x4, 1x6), quick Dwayne Bravo is the one who pulled it off. But for his slower one, Yuvraj could have forced at least a tie. The last over began with India requiring 11. 

Lara admitted hed resigned himself to hoping for no more than a tie when Bravo executed to perfection a suggestion from senior pro Chris Gayle, whod been wonderful with his brand of spin. Lara didnt have to reveal who suggested what, but did. 

Its a team effort and each one contributed... Bravo himself had done nothing till he bowled that slower one... Its neither a big nor a huge win, its an important one, but we didnt bat well... From 250-plus in 45 overs the other day to under 200 in 50... Thats not good batting, he pointed out. 

Asked to comment on Chappells strong observation, Lara said: Wed been getting into winning positions, but were giving it away... Today, we didnt relax and didnt throw the opportunity... Of course, I would like us to win easier. 

The West Indies intensity on the field had been exceptional, contributing no doubt to a much-improved performance both in the air and on the ground. 

Dravids body language and his reaction, by the way, didnt suggest his team had taken a killer punch. Defeats hurt, but worrying doesnt help... The (record) run probably had to end somewhere... We arent disheartened and were not going to panic... 

We got the combination right (picking Ramesh Powar), but lacked execution... We didnt chase cleverly and theres lots to play for in the next three matches... Despite the slowness of the wicket, it was a 235-240 one and the bowlers on both sides did a great job. 

Dravid praised Yuvraj in the appropriate manner: He has taken his batting to another level and played so many good innings in the past few months that its difficult placing this one in a category... The quality of Yuvrajs innings deserved that he finish it off... He almost did... 

Defending the move to again send Irfan Pathan at No.3, Dravid asked for patience. Then, backing Mahendra Singh Dhoni, he emphasised the dressing room hadnt put him under pressure. Dhoni has an able head on his shoulders... If theres pressure, its from the Media, not within... 

 The somewhat smaller targets do 

 pose a problem of pacing, but good teams are expected to 

 overcome hiccups. Certainly one ranked in the top three. 

 Chappell told The Telegraph there were lessons 

 to learn and that the early realisation would be handy. 

Meanwhile, Sarwan (who was in the running to succeed Shivnarine Chanderpaul) insisted he wouldnt mind remaining unbeaten on 98 as long as the West Indies kept winning. Weve got such a legacy, but havent been doing well in recent years... It hurts and my goal is to help restore former glory. 

 Lara, who is looking at his job holistically, 

 has much the same agenda. For now, prepare for a cracker 

 at St Kitts, on Tuesday. 

 Footnote: Marlon Samuels 

 may have helped the West Indies cause in a big way 

 (two for 30), but his action is being monitored 

 by the men who matter.

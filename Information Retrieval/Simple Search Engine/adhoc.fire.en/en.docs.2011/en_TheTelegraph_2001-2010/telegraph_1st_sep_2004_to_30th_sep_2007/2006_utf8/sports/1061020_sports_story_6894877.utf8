 Special adhesive for Brabourne pitches

- Atkinson lsquo;treatment rsquo; to 

 restore firmness

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai: The uncertainty over the Brabourne Stadium hosting the Champions Trophy final on November 5 may have blown over, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) is leaving no stones unturned to ensure that there are no further controversies. 

Andy Atkinson, the ICC Pitches Committee consultant, has thus been summoned and he will provide special treatment to the much-maligned strips used for matches here. 

The Englishmans first action will on Friday morning, just a few hours before Sri Lanka take on New Zealand here. He will be applying a special adhesive to restore firmness on Fridays track. 

Due to late monsoons, the soil under the strips could not be bound together, leading to a lack of firmness. So, a special adhesive called PVA (poly vinyl acetate) will be applied. Its a common glue used in building-making, said Atkinson, who landed here from London on Thursday morning. 

A mixture of 10 litres of PVA and 5 litres of water would be sprayed on the tracks, followed by light rolling. 

The process takes just about 25 minutes. It has been applied in England and New Zealand, but we havent tried it out in India before, informed Atkinson, who had inspected the pitches earlier with an ICC team. 

Atkinson admitted there are a few cracks on the strip where Fridays game will be played, but hoped that the application of PVA will offer fair chances to both batsmen and bowlers.

 Graphite bats to be withdrawn by October

London: The graphite bat favoured by Australian captain Ricky Ponting will be withdrawn from first class cricket by October, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Thursday. 

Six weeks after the product was scrapped from international cricket, Australian manufacturer Kookaburra has agreed voluntarily to withdraw its graphite-reinforced bat from all first-class cricket by October 1. 

Kookaburras proposal has been supported by the ICC member countries who have agreed to allow the use of the bats at levels below first-class domestic competition for the duration of the natural life-span of the bats, the ICC said in a statement. 

The bat was launched in December 2004 and had been regularly used by Australias Justin Langer and Damien Martyn, and Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya. (Reuters)

 Hossain hattrick in vain

Harare: Shahadat Hossain took Bangladeshs first one-day International hattrick but could not prevent a two-wicket defeat to Zimbabwe on Wednesday. 

Needing five runs to win off the final ball, Zimbabwes Brendan Taylor smashed a full toss from fast bowler Mashrafe Mortaza over the midwicket boundary for six to usher the home side to a dramatic victory. 

Bangladesh, who were put in to bat, were dismissed for 236 in 49 overs. Zimbabwe replied with 238 for eight to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series. 

Taylor watched Shahadats hattrick in the 39th over unfold from the non-strikers end as Zimbabwe crashed from 151-4 to 151-7, but he stood firm for an unbeaten 79 off 72 balls with six fours and three sixes.

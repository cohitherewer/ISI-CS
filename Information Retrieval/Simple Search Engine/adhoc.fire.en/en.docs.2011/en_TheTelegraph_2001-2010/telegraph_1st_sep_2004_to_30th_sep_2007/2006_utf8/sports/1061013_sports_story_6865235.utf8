 Afridi: Not easy to return as opener 

 - After the turmoil, Pakistan look to rally around Younis 

 Afridi 

Jaipur: Hard-hitting batsman Shahid Afridi called on his senior teammates Thursday to fill the gap in the Pakistan team left by the absence of experienced captain Inzamam-ul-Haq ahead of the Champions Trophy. 

All the senior players like me have to shoulder the responsibility and rally around new captain Younis Khan, Afridi said. 

We have left all the off-field incidents behind us and now all the boys are focussed on the Champions Trophy, said Afridi, who holds the record of scoring the fastest limited-overs century. 

Afridi has dropped down the order after starting his career as an opening batsman, but the shift in the line-up has not affected his focus. 

I have adjusted myself according to the requirement of the team, Afridi said. I would have loved to open on subcontinent wickets, but its not easy now after playing down in the order for quite some time now. 

My job is to play for the team and contribute in the teams success. 

Afridi did not single any team as his favourites to win the tournament. 

You cant single out one team because any team can win on the day, he said. Its a very big tournament for every team because whosoever wins it, it will be a big plus for it ahead of next years World Cup. 

Despite scoring 4860 runs in 230 limited-overs matches with four centuries and 26 half centuries, Afridi thinks its his fastish leg-breaks that earned him 192 wickets is the main component of his game. 

Batting has always been a plus point for me because, for me, its more important that I give the team crucial breakthroughs through my bowling, he said.

 Bagan need a Mahindra win

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: On Thursday, when Mohun Bagan take on Air India in their concluding group I quarter final league match of the Durand Cup, it could, by that time, well turn out to be a match of no consequence. 

With both Mohun Bagan and Mahindra United are having four points each from two matches, Thursdays first match between Mahindra and Sporting Clube de Goa holds the possibility of killing all interest in the group. 

A victory for Mahindra over their Goan rivals would ensure an automatic spot for Mohun Bagan in the semi-finals. 

As it is, Mohun Bagan now only need a draw to make the grade. 

Keeping this in mind, Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya may prefer to keep skipper Jose Barreto and Gautam Debnath at the bench in case Mahindra beat Sporting. 

Both are having a yellow card each and we might not take any risk, he said. 

It is almost certain that a new-look midfield will play against Air India, who are still without a point. 

Mehtab Hussain, who has arrived on Tuesday after resigning his job from the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC), will make the first eleven. 

His partners in the midfield could be Lalkamal Bhowmick, Suman Dutta and Dulal Biswas. Lalkamal will replace Chinmoy Sarkar.

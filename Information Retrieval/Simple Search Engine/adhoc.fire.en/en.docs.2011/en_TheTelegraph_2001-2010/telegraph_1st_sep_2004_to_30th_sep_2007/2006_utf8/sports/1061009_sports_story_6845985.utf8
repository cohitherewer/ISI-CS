Calcutta: Apart from one chance apiece for Mike Okoro and Surojit Roy and a goalline save from Naru Gopal Hait, the less one speaks about Sundays Mohammedan Sporting-Chirag United Sports Club match at Barasat, the better. On expected lines, the 90-minute affair of the Sahara CFL Premier Division ended in a bland, boring goalless draw. 

Another chance for Mohammedan Sporting came in the 14th minute when Surojit got a ball inside the box. With only goalkeeper Shibram Dey to beat, Surojit failed to convert the opportunity. 

Okoro ruined what could have been his moment of glory in the 50th minute when the Nigerian shot at the rival goalie Shibram. The latter, however, should be credited for that save since he had anticipated Okoros right footer. 

In the first-half, another Surojit header towards the goal was put out of danger by Hait from the goalline. 

Truth to tell, the less-fancied Chirag United players with orange shirts couldnt score a goal, but they were visibly the better side. Subhas Bhowmicks boys had no clue as to what they were doing in the middle. And in the end, Mohammedan Sporting had to make peace with Amal Duttas wards. 

Though Dutta claimed later that they wanted to win the match, it wasnt evident from their display in the ground. They looked more than happy to share points with the black-and-white brigade. 

Bhowmick, who called it quits as Mohammedan Sporting coach before reversing the decision within a day in a dramatic fashion, left the venue without making any comments. Add to this the Douglas episode and Mohammedan Sporting woes appeared more home-bred than being inflicted by the opponents. Perhaps Bhowmicks players will need a match or two to get over such moments of uncertainty. 

Mohammedan Sporting, who were once cruising along and looking favourites to lift the title, have thus receded farther in the race. 

With 20 points from 12 matches, they are, however, almost assured of a third-place finish, a far, far cry from their initial optimism. Chirag United, fighting for the fourth slot, are level with Calcutta Port Trust with 14 points from 12 outings. Port Trust, though, have played a match less.

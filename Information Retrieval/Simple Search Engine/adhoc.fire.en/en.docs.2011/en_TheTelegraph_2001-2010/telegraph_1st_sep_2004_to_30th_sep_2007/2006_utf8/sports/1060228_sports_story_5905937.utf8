I am not at all disappointed or surprised by Sanias defeat against Martina Hingis in the first round of the Dubai Open. Playing against a rejuvenated five-time Grand Slam singles champion, known for her consistency, is by no means an easy task. Sania played a fine match. She fought back with spirit and spunk when she was down by a set and 5-3 in the second set. 

When Sania levelled the score 5-5 with some splendid rallies from the baseline, Hingis was visibly concerned since Sania with her penchant for hitting winners would have been dangerous in a tie-breaker shootout. 

Since I saw her last, Sania has changed her service action and seems to have improved her fitness and movement on the court. Her new truncated service action eliminates the circular swing and she now strikes the ball with a hammerlike blow leveraged by the elbow. 

The short action will improve accuracy and consistency, but there will be a loss of power.

It will require more muscle strength, which will have to be built up gradually or else it could damage her elbow. 

I was most concerned to see the heavy strapping both above and below Sanias elbow. A recent photograph happily shows her playing the doubles without any strapping. Besides her forehand winners, Sania hit several splendid sharply angled double-handed backhand winners, which left Hingis standing. 

The shot missing in Sanias armoury is down the line backhand. 

Justine Henin-Hardenne and Mauresmo reap a rich harvest with their single-handed down the line backhand shots. 

For double handers, the extra step n6 

ecessary to get to the ball requires them to be faster. 

The backhand down the line is a match winning shot in modern tennis as it dislodges the opponent from the position near the backhand corner from where most players control the long rallies and play the inside out forehand to the opponents backhand. 

Another very important aspect, specially for Sania, is to get a higher percentage of deep first serves and develop a well-placed deeper second service. 

This will help her to get better control of the rallies and unleash her powerful groundshots. 

Currently her opponents attack her after a weak second serve putting her on the defensive and she loses control of the rally. 

Also, if she can become quicker she will be able to run around her backhand more, especially on her opponents second serve and put pressure on their service on important points. 

Next time you watch Henin-Hardenne play, watch her do this ? she moves like lightning. 

Sania put up a good show and had she played any of the other top notchers who do not have the consistency or experience of Hingis, it may have been a very close match. 

Sania seems to be on track but will her body stand up to the punishing training schedules and tough matches? 

This morning the papers have stated that Sania has withdrawn from the Doha tournament. 

At 19 years of age her limbs have already taken a beating. First she had an ankle injury, then her lower back and now it is her elbow. 

Sometimes western training schedules are too severe for Indian physiques and there are no trainers with experience of training Indian women at the highest levels. 

Unlike western women, Indians need patient and very careful handling. 

Though blessed with a beautiful timing, Sania is not a natural athlete. 

The tempo of physical training has to be built up gradually. Practice workouts should be reduced and tournament participation curtailed to surfaces that suit Sanias style of play. 

Jimmy Connors, one of the greats of the game, never practised for more than 30-45 minutes at a time. He played with such intense concentration that this was enough time. 

The system of training and coaching should be carefully tailored for Sania or else her potential will never be achieved. 

At this point of her career, staying injury free even at the expense of losing points and consequent lower ranking is of paramount importance.

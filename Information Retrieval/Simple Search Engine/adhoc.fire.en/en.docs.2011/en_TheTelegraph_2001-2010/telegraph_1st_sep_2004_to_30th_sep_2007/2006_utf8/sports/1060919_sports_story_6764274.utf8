 Wake-up call for Indians before Asian 

 Games 

 - Somebody needs to take the blame for a dismal show 

 Expert View

The Indian hockey teams performance in the World Cup is bitter to swallow. Far from fighting to be the best in Asia, the team has now finished fourth among the continents challengers. While Korea, who made the semi-finals are now the standard bearers for Asia, Pakistan managed to stay in top-six. 

Japan finished ahead of India, as they first beat South Africa and then Argentina in the minor placings to finish ninth. India lost to Argentina, but in the clash for 11th and 12th, India barely managed to avoid the last position embarrassment by beating South Africa 1-0. 

Falling behind South Korea and Pakistan was bad enough and now it is even Japan. And there will also be Malaysia to contend with in Asian Games. The Indians must wake up now. While this is a wake-up call for the whole fraternity, there should be somebody up there ready to take the blame for this pathetic fall. 

Now, all eyes will be on Indias show in Doha Asian Games. This pathetic performance, coming less than three months before the Asian Games, will keep the Indian players under intense pressure. 

Averting the wooden spoon, India just managed to ensure that they were not eliminated from the Champions Challenge competition. Who would have thought that there would indeed be a time, when India would feel relieved at being pushed out of even international hockey federations second-rung event, the Champions Challenge. This lone win in Indias entire World Cup campaign cannot make up for the terrible blow to our standing in international hockey that has plunged over the years. 

A defeat on Sunday in the playoff for the 11th and 12th positions would not just have eliminated India from the champions challenge line-up next year, but also pushed it into oblivion. In that context, this 1-0 victory over South Africa was a minor consolation. 

The Indian strikers continued to be erratic in the match against South Africa. It reflected the jitters prevailing in the Indian camp that the only goal of the match came in the 54th minute despite their extended domination of the contest. 

Eventually, Rajpal Singhs deflection off a penalty corner shot by Dilip Tirkey saved India from the humiliation of a bottom-place finish among the 12 countries. 

But India remained on the tenterhooks as they failed to convert several more chances and hung on to the slim lead, something that they had not been able to do earlier during this tournament. 

Tejbir Singh came close to sealing the victory two minutes from the hooter, but he shot wide and fortunately the Indians did not succumb to their last-stage blues. 

Im rather surprised to see the jitters that the Indian defence has been experiencing during the World Cup. One would have thought that their international exposure ought to make them used to such situations. 

On a different occasion, the same team might give a more composed display. One thing that stood out in their last match was the way the players made some good interceptions and created space up front. But the strikers wasted the good work by hanging on to the ball for too long.

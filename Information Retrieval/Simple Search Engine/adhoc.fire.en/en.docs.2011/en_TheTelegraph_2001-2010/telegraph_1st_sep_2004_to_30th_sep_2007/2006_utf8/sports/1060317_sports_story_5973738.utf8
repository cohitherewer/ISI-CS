Indian Wells: Third seed Maria Sharapova overpowered Germanys Anna-Lena Groenefeld 6-1, 6-3 on Wednesday to reach a mouth-watering semi-final with Martina Hingis at the Pacific Life Open. 

Former Swiss world number one Hingis earlier eclipsed another Russian Dinara Safina 6-3, 6-4 to reach the last four. 

In the mens field, Andy Roddicks slump in form continued when he was knocked out in the fourth round by 24th-seeded Russian Igor Andreev. 

The world No. 3 went down 4-6, 7-6, 1-6 and his conqueror will next face American James Blake, who advanced when Germanys Tommy Haas retired with food poisoning while trailing 3-6, 0-3. 

Top seed Roger Federer raced past Frances Richard Gasquet 6-3, 6-4 to book his place in the last eight, while number two Rafael Nadal of Spain overcame a twisted ankle to beat 20th seed Sebastien Grosjean of France 6-4, 6-2. Federer will face sixth seed Ivan Ljubicic after the Croatian out-classed compatriot and 21st seed Mario Ancic 6-3, 6-4. 

Nadal ? who pulled out of the doubles because of his injury ? will face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, who continued his fine form, defeating Tomas Berdych of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-1 to reach the quarter finals. 

In another upset, Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan upended fourth seed David Nalbandian of Argentina 6-7, 6-3, 6-2. Paradorn will face 22nd seed Jarkko Nieminen of Finland, who ended former world number one Marat Safins run with a 6-4, 6-3 victory. 

Hingis secured her 20th win since her comeback from a three-year absence from the tour with a polished display against Safina. Sharapova and Hingis have already played twice this year, with Hingis taking the Russian down in the semi-finals of Tokyo and Sharapova getting revenge with a semi-final win in Dubai. (Reuters)

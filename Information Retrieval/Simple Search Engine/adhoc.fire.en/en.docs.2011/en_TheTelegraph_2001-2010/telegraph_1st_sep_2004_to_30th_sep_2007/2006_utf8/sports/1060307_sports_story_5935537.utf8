 Simon Jones ruled out

Nagpur: Simon Jones has been ruled out of the rest of the three-Test series with India. 

An ECB statement said the injured England paceman underwent an arthroscopy last Friday after sustaining an injury to his left knee before the first Test in Nagpur. 

Simon has been ruled out of the current Test series in India and at this stage it is thought unlikely that he will be available for the seven-match ODI series. 

Meanwhile, Ashish Nehra expects to regain full fitness in the next six weeks but says the stiff competition for pace-bowling slots will make it difficult for him to return to the national team. 

Nehra, who has just started light practice sessions after a three-month rehabilitation programme in Australia, said he is planning to play in England to prove his fitness.

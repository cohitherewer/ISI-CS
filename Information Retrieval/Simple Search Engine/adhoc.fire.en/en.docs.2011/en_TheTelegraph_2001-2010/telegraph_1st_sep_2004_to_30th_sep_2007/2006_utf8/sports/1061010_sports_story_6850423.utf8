 Arjun Atwal tied 22nd

 - Love III ends title drought 

 Davis Love III with the Sam Snead Cup on Sunday 

Greensboro: Arjun Atwal kept his hopes of squeezing into the top-125 alive with a tied 22nd place at the USPGA Chrysler Classic on Sunday. 

That finish pushed him to 138th on the money list, up four places from 142nd last week. Atwal had a final round of 68 with five birdies and one bogey. 

Atwal had birdies on the first, fourth, seventh, 14th and 17th and his only blemish of the day came on the 11th. He has $527,758 and has made only 13 cuts in 30 starts, struggling with his putting all season. 

Daniel Chopra, a Swede of Indian descent, registered his fifth top-10 finish of the season with a tie for sixth. His total of 11-under 277 was five shots shy of winner Davis Love III, who shot a 66 to end a three-year title drought. 

Love won by two strokes over fellow-American Jason Bohn, who fired a 66 and finished tied second with Eric Axley and Steve Flesch a further shot back at 13-under-par. 

Loves last Tour victory came at the 2003 International. It was his 19th career title on the worlds most lucrative circuit and his second at Forest Oaks where he first triumphed in 1992. 

Chopra who earned $151,250, had just one bogey on the third. His birdies came on the fourth and seventh and he had an eagle on the par-5 13th for his second of the week. 

Chopra, 77th last week, moved eight places up to 69th and by being inside the top-70 he will also get into bigger events next season. He now has $1,162,812 from 30 starts of which he has made the cut in 20 and finished in the top-10 five times. 

Love felt his blinkered approach in the final round at Forest Oaks paved the way for success. 

If I would have been staring at that leaderboard and found out that I was three shots behind, I probably wouldnt have won, he said after posting a 72-hole total of 16-under 272. 

I was committed to just playing my own game and keeping my head down. Through the middle of that round, I didnt know what was going on.

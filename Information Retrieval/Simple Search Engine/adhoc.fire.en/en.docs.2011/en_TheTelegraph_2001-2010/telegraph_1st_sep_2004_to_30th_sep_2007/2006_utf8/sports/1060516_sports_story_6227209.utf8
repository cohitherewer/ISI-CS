 More justifies decisions

Vadodara: Merit and performance were the only criteria for selection to the Indian squad, national selection committee chairman Kiran More said Monday, while rubbishing charges that rank youngsters were making it into the team at the cost of experienced players. 

More also sought to scotch speculation that former India captain Sourav Gangulys ouster from the team had to do with politics and pressures from outside. 

The decision (to drop Sourav) was based on merit. It was a unanimous decision of the five-member selection committee, More said. 

He said their (Sourav and others who have been dropped) exclusion did not mean that the door was closed on them forever and they could come back to the team provided they gave better performances. (PTI)

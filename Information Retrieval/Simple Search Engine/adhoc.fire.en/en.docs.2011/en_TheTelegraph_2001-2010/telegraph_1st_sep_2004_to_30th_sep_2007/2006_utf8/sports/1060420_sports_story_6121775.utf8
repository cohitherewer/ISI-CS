 Chikmagalur: Prakash Amritraj failed to capitalise on an early lead and lost to Jan Masik of the Czech Republic 5-7, 1-6 in the second round of the $25,000 Cafe Cup ATP Challenger tournament here on Wednesday.

Masik advanced to the quarter finals, where he was joined by second seeded Danai Udomchoke of Thailand.

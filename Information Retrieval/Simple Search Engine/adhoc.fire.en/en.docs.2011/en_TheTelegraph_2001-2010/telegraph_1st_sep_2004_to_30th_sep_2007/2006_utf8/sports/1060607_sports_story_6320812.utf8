 Roberts session with Pathan

 - I think he had a problem with final two strides 

 Pathan 

St. Johns: Andy Roberts took it upon himself to haul Irfan Pathan out of his bowling blues after the fourth days play in the first Test here on Monday. 

Roberts worked with the Indian left-arm bowler after the end of play at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

I think he had a problem with the final two strides of his run-up. I tried to sort it out, said Roberts adding if you dont have your run-up right, you will have problems with your action. 

Roberts said he had not observed Pathan closely before and watched him practising only this morning. 

There was just something I observed this morning and I explained it to the coach (Greg Chappell). He said he would he happy if I had a word with him which I did. 

In order to straighten out Pathans action, Roberts asked him to get away from the bowling stumps and just try to bowl without measuring his run-up. 

After Pathan had thus bowled one ball, Roberts made him measure that distance which turned out to be 23 steps. 

Roberts then asked him to replicate the run-up, bowling at the stumps now. 

Pathan seemed to be coming good as he fired in his deliveries with Chappell doing the wicketkeeping for him. 

He started trying too hard in order to get more pace during the one-dayers, said Chappell. But he has to remember he is a swing bowler, not a pace bowler. 

Pathans pace has dipped further on this tour in which he has been a shadow of his own self because of the slowness of the tracks in the Caribbean. 

Chappell said the answer for a swing bowler to bowl on such kind of wickets was to just try and maintain a good line and length. 

A swing bowler has to do what Ian Bradshaw has shown on the fourth day ? if you dont have the pace, just concentrate to bowl in good areas. (PTI)

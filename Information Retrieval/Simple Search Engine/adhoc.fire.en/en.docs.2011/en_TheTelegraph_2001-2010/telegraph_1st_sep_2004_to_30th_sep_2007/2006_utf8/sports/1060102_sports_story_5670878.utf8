Sydney: South Africa are considering playing uncapped spinner Johan Botha in the final Test against Australia in a last-ditch gamble to salvage a drawn series. 

The tourists need to win the final match, starting at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Monday, to square the three-match series after drawing in Perth and then losing in Melbourne. 

Proteas captain Graeme Smith told a news conference on Sunday that the tourists were still undecided about their line-up but changes had to be made and Botha was under serious consideration after being rushed into the squad this week when injured fast bowler Makhaya Ntini was sent home. 

Obviously Makhayas absence is a big loss but weve got guys capable of coming in, Smith said. 

Its up to the selectors but weve got to go with guys who will give us the best chance of winning the game. 

Smith said South Africa were unlikely to play two spinners despite Sydneys reputation for assisting slow bowlers, leaving the selectors to choose between the untried Botha and Nicky Boje, who failed to take a wicket in Melbourne. 

I think as a team weve got to take more risks and hes (Botha) a guy who wants to bowl in the tough situations, he wants to bowl at the death and be in the mix of things, Smith said. Hes a much more aggressive character, hes a wicket-taker and hopefully thatll produce results down the line. 

But its not like hes got to produce a miracle for us. Its about us giving him an exposure and saying go and make an opportunity of it. Its not going to be only his chance. 

The Australians also delayed the announcement of their starting XI but captain Ricky Ponting said the world champions were certain to stick with the twin-spin combination of Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill. The only change to the side that won in Melbourne is the inclusion of opening batsman Justin Langer, who missed the last game with a groin strain but came through a gruelling net session in 43 degree Celsius on Sunday to prove his fitness. 

It does look like a good wicket. I think itll be a fairly traditional Sydney cricket wicket. Itll be unlikely that well make any other changes, Ponting said. I am really happy with the way weve played in the last two games. 

A lot of our guys are in good form, theres a good feeling around the team and if we get out there and start the test match well Im sure South Africa will find it hard to beat us. 

Ponting said Australias 184-run victory in Melbourne had given his team a huge psychological lift heading into Sydney. 

I felt we dominated the Perth Test without being able to win and although we had some sticky moments in Melbourne we managed to win the game fairly comprehensively, he said. 

I think Melbourne was good for us, in that we won very convincingly and probably gave South Africa a few other things to think about. 

Smith said his team had shown they were good enough to beat the Australians but had paid a heavy price for some untimely errors, including 11 dropped catches in the first two Tests. 

Weve certainly had opportunities to get ourselves 1-0 up in the series but we didnt take them and thats the most disappointing thing for us because weve put a lot of work in, he said. 

But whether we are 1-0 down or 2-0 it doesnt make any difference, weve still lost the series so weve got to give it everything. 

Sometimes when youre 1-0 up and youre holding on to a lead it can create more pressure on you so were just going to relax and play our natural game.

 Argentina, Mexico 1-1 after 90 minutes

 Leipzig: Argentina and 

 Mexico were level 1-1 after regulation time on Saturday 

 and were headed for 30 minutes of extra time in the second 

 round of the World Cup. 

Rafael Marquez put Mexico ahead in the sixth minute and Hernan Crespo equalised in the 10th. 

The winners will face hosts Germany in the quarter finals in Berlin on Friday. 

Marquezs goal put Argentina behind for the first time in the tournament. Pavel Pardo sent in a free kick from the right side, which Mario Mendez headed across the goalmouth to a sliding Marquez, who knocked the ball over diving goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri. 

Argentina drew level four minutes later. Juan Roman Riquelme curled in a corner from the right, which Crespo appeared to flick into the net. 

Crespos goal settled Argentina, with the game developing a pattern. Mexico, with their heavily-packed defence, worked to score on the counter-attack, with Argentina probing and trying to keep possession. 

Crespo had another great chance in the 23rd, chipping the ball over Mexico goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez, but wide. 

In the 25th, Borgetti, who started after sitting out two games with a thigh injury, sent a shot from 20 metres that Abbondanzieri leaped high to deflect over the crossbar. 

Mexico had back luck in the 38th when Pavel Pardo ? the teams dead-ball specialist ? went off with a right thigh injury and was replaced by Gerardo Torrado. 

Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze picked up a yellow card a minute into injury time when he lost control of a pass from Abbondanzieri, and then went feet first into Jose Fonseca. 

Mexico had their first clear chance in the second half, but Borgetti was stopped close in by Abbondanzieri in the 54th. 

Argentina had two clear chances to score early in the second half, but Sanchez came up with key saves each time. In the 57th, he tipped Maxi Rodriguezs shot over the bar. In the 60th, he stopped Javier Saviolas point-blank shot. 

Mexico had another injury blow in the 64th when Andres Guardado limped off and was replaced a few minutes later by Gonzalo Pineda. 

Argentina made their first substitution in the 76th, with Carlos Tevez coming in for Crespo. A minute later, Pablo Aimar replaced Esteban Cambiasso. 

 Lionel Messi, who turned 19 on Saturday, went in the 

 84th for Javier Saviola.

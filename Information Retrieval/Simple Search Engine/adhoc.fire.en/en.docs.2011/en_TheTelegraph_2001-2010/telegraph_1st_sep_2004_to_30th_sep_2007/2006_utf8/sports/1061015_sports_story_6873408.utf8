 Palmer quits competitive golf

 Arnold Palmer 

Spring (Texas): An aching back and too many bad shots finally convinced Arnold Palmer to end his competitive career. 

Palmer withdrew after playing only four holes of the Administaff Small Business Classic on Friday, then told his loyal fans at the end of the round that he was retiring from tournament play. 

Palmer made the tearful announcement with a large group of Arnies Army huddled around. 

I made every move in the bag today to make a good shot and I wasnt very successful, Palmer said. Thats not surprising. It just didnt come today. Its been working its way into my repertoire. Its tough and its emotional for me because its my life. 

Palmer, 77, has played less frequently in recent years. He had played in only one other Champions Tour event this year. He hit two balls into the water on the par 4, 440-yard No. 4 hole Friday, playing in a threesome with Lee Trevino and John Mahaffey. He played the rest of the round but did not keep score. 

Ive been doing this for a long time and, first of all, to stand out there and not be able to make something happen is very traumatic in my mind, Palmer said. The people, they all want to see a good shot and you know it and you cant give them that good shot. Thats when its time. 

Palmer played his final PGA Tour event at the 2004 Masters, a record 50th consecutive start at Augusta National. His first victory at the Masters in 1958 is where Arnies Army was created, a time when television began to take an interest in golf and had the charismatic Palmer to bring the masses to the game.

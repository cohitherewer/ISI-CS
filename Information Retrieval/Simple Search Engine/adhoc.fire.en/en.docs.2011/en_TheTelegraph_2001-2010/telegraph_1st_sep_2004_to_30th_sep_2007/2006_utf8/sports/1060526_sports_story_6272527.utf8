Port-of-Spain: The Queens Park Oval has seen historic Test wins for India, but this is Brian Lara territory. If theres a doubt, it gets cleared when one disembarks at the First World airport: A bmobile billboard, with a smiling mug of The King, welcomes you to Trinidad and Tobago. 

The West Indies captain, though, doesnt want to act the perfect host. Rather, he wishes to wrap up the Digicel series on Friday itself, to enable him sit back and relax on Sunday, when the fifth and final ODI will be played here itself. 

For India, match No.4 has become yet another do-or-die affair. For, being 1-2 down, they cant afford to suffer a third straight loss to the West Indies. Actually, it has been quite a while ? six months ? since the Rahul Dravids last faced such an equation. 

As reported by The Telegraph, Yuvraj Singh is going to return ? he has recovered from back spasms. Yalaka Venugopal Rao, therefore, will have to go out. 

The West Indies are set to make two changes. 

Former captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul has been ruled out of the last two ODIs. He has a slight tear on his left hamstring and Wavell Hinds has got a call-up. Then, Runako Morton has been dropped and promising opener Sewnarine Chattergoon recalled. 

According to a team spokesman, Chanderpaul (an architect of Tuesdays win in Basseterre) remains with the squad to ensure continuity with treatment. Its not clear, however, whether hes also going to miss the first Test, in Antigua, from June 2. 

While there are Little Indias across Port-of-Spain, Lara felt crowd support wouldnt be a factor. Dravid recognised Indias excellent record here, but maintained it wouldnt guarantee anything. 

Weve had a stop-start tour and its time we settled down, he said, adding I knew the series would be close, but didnt expect three last-over finishes in succession... The momentum isnt with any team, but they can afford one more mistake... 

Lara, who has announced the two matches over three days will probably be his last at the Queens Park Oval, pointed out that the West Indies approach wouldnt change. Its quite a simple game, getting one more than the opposition... 

Aware that the attention must not move away from the job at hand (winning the series), Lara remarked: The boys are buoyant... Yet, instead of one batsman (Ramnaresh Sarwan) playing the lead role, we need more of an all-round effort... I need to score... 

In Laras opinion, neither Hinds (hes experienced to take off straightaway) nor Chattergoon should have a problem adjusting to a tight series. 

As it was in Kingston, fingers are crossed over the weather. It rained on Thursday and was overcast till one filed this report.

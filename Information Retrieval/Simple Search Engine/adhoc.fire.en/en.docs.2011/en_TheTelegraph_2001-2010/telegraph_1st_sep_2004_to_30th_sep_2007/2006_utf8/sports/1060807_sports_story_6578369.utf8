 Surrey win as Kumble bags 8

 - COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP 

 Kumble had a match-haul of 11 wkts 

London: Anil Kumble bagged eight wickets in the second innings to spin Surrey to a seven-wicket victory against Northamptonshire in a County Championship Division II match at The Oval. 

Kumbles eight for 100, his best figures in County appearances, helped the Division II leaders notch up their seventh championship win of the season. The 35-year-old, who took just one wicket in his previous outing for Surrey, proved too good for his former colleagues to finish with match figures of 11 for 183. 

But Surrey were made to wait until the final hour as Matthew Nicholson (53 not out) and David Wigley (28) put on 78 for the ninth wicket. 

Kumble wrapped up the innings when the match looked like heading for a draw, and Surrey knocked off the requisite 65 runs off 16 overs 12 balls to spare. Surrey played three specialist spinners in this match, but Kumble was head and shoulders above his colleagues. 

Quite inexplicably, though, Kumble was held back by captain Mark Butcher till the 18th over of the first session. Once he got a bowl, Kumble struck with his third ball when he had Chris Rogers (75) stumped. 

Kumble also dismissed Afzaal leg-before just before lunch for 142 but it was after the break he really came into his own. He got rid of David Sales and, off the next ball, had Lance Klusener caught. Among his other victims were Bilal Shafayat, who top-scored with 91 in the first innings. (PTI)

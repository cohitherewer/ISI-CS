Colombo: India continued their golden march on the second day of the 10th SAF Games here on Sunday. 

The contingent dominated the pool, picking up six gold medals, while two more came from the shooting range and another from the table tennis hall, as the gulf between india and its regional opponents widened. 

As the day wore on, Indias tally stood at 24 gold, 10 silver and three bronze. 

The swimmers were denied a clean sweep by the Sri Lankas Andrew Abeysinghe, who surprised the fancied Rehan Poncha in the 200m backstroke. 

That apart, India claimed all the other golds on offer at the Sugathadasa Stadium pool where Fariah Zaman set a new Games mark on way to clinching the gold in womens 100m backstroke clocking 1:09.05. 

Indias Varun Divigikar became the fastest swimmer of the meet by winning the mens 50m freestyle in 23.97, while the mens 100m breaststroke saw Sandeep Sejwal victorious with a timing of 1:07.73. 

In womens 800m freestyle, Surabhi Tipri swam to glory clocking 9:39.60, while compatriot Pooja Alva claimed the silver with 9:41.93. 

The gold in womens 200m individual medley went to V. Tejaswini who completed the race in 2:28.78 seconds. Indias 4x100m womens freestyle relay team combined well to scoop up the gold in 4:8:72. 

The fancied Indian women paddlers kept their reputation intact by cornering glory in the team event, but not before a ding-dong battle with the hosts. 

The troika of Poulami Ghatak, Mouma Das and Nandita Saha pipped the Lankans 3-2 to register a top podium finish. 

In shooting, Indians launched their medal count in style winning both the team and individual golds in womens 25 metre sports pistol. 

Anisa Syed claimed the individual top honours with a cumulative score of 749.6, while the Indians registered a total of 1643 in the team championship to take home the gold.

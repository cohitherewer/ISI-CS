 Shevchenko: We have nothing to lose 

Cologne: Ukraines players are hoping their outsider status sticks despite their progress to the World Cup quarter finals. That should mean the pressure is on their opponents, the next of whom is Italy on Friday. 

 It should be easier for us because nobody will expect us to win. Weve done well to have got this far. There are no more expectations on us. We are liberated and unburdened, striker Andriy Shevchenko said. 

Having made it to the second round in their first World Cup, Ukraine secured a 0-0 extra-time draw against Switzerland on Monday and then won a penalty shootout 3-0. 

 The match against Italy wont be easy as we are getting more and more tired with each game, said Shevchenko, who will be up against several teammates from his former club AC Milan. I saw Italys game and they still did well even with only 10 men. 

Italy has a good team and great players. They are always favourites. But all the pressure will be on them. We have nothing to lose and Italy does. 

Shevchenko warned that his teams spirit will also make Ukraine increasingly tough to beat. And Ukraine left Switzerland goalkeeper Pascal Zuberbuehler unimpressed. 

Its hard to take because I hadnt conceded during the whole tournament, and Ukraine didnt play well, Zuberbuehler said. I didnt have to make many good saves because there were no shots on goal. 

While Ukraine reached their goal of getting past the group stage, Italy will not be content without at least getting close to a first title since 1982. At the last edition, the Azzurri suffered an embarrassing second-round exit. 

Italy will be tough opponents and theyll be the favourites, but that could well be a burden for them and an opportunity for us, Milevskiy said. 

Ukraine coach Oleg Blokhin was so nervous about his teams penalty shootout against Switzerland on Monday that he retreated to the dressing room and did not even know that his best player had missed one. 

I went into the changing room, I couldnt take it anymore, Blokhin told reporters. Blokhin was blissfully unaware of Shevchenko missing the penalty even after the game. Its not important who scored the goals. It is the team that is playing. Shevchenko is getting better game-by-game. 

Meanwhile, Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko phoned Blokhin on Tuesday to congratulate the national team and said he might come to support them in the quarter finals.

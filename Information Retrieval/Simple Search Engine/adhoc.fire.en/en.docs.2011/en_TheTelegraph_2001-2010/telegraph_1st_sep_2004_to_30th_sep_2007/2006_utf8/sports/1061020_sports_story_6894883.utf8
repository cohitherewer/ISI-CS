 Protect the innocent: Musharraf 

 - PCB chief says Inzamam to blame for forfeiture 

 Inzamam 

Islamabad: In the backdrop of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif testing positive for a banned steroid, President Pervez Musharraf has asked the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to enforce discipline in the teams ranks but not at the cost of punishing an innocent player. 

No innocent player should be punished and players should be protected, Musharraf told PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf. 

Musharraf telephoned Ashraf to congratulate him over Pakistans victory over Sri Lanka and also asked him to ensure discipline was enforced in the team, a local daily reported Thursday. 

Ashraf may meet the players in India this weekend and convey Musharrafs message. 

[Contacted by The Telegraph in Mohali, manager Talat Ali said he had no idea about the chairmans visit.] 

Meanwhile, Inzamam-ul Haqs conduct during The Oval Test has come in for sharp criticism from Ashraf who has squarely blamed him for the forfeiture. Ashrafs attack on the captain comes amid a compensation claim of 80,000 being slapped on the PCB by its England counterpart, which he said was unjustified. 

Inzamam is to be blamed for the forfeiture of The Oval Test because he refused to return to the field. It is because of his way of protesting the ball-tampering charges that we are being asked for a substantial compensation by the ECB, Ashraf was quoted as saying. (AGencies)

 Advocaat holds rare secret session

Leverkusen: South Korea took preparations for their World Cup opener against Togo to a new level, as coach Dick Advocaat ordered a closed-doors morning training session and swore his players to secrecy. 

South Korea, the 2002 World Cup semi-finalists, have never had a closed doors session since Advocaat took over from Jo Bonfrere at the end of September last year. 

The Koreans face Togo on Tuesday, France five days later and what could be a crunch match with Switzerland on June 23. I cant tell you a thing about what went on behind the closed doors, said midfielder Lee Eul-yong. It was a time for us to work on our set-plays and the kind of thing were going to do in the match.

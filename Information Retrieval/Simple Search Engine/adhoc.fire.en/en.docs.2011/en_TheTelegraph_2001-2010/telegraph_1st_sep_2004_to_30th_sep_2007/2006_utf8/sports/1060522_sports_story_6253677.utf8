The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan earn third place 

 - National Football League Dempo pip Sporting Clube de Goa to fourth spot 

 Biswajit Bhattacharya 

Ludhiana: A team that once looked in danger of being relegated, Mohun Bagan staged a remarkable comeback and finished third in the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup when they edged past JCT 1-0 at the Guru Nanak Stadium on Sunday. 

With this victory, Mohun Bagan accumulated 30 points ? five points clear of Dempo and Sporting Clube de Goa ? that helped the Calcutta side pocket Rs 6 lakh. Both Goan clubs finished on 25, but Dempo pipped Sporting to the fourth place by virtue of a better goal difference. 

In their respective final-round engagements, Dempo played out a goalless draw in Margao with Mahindra United ? who have already emerged champions and finished with 36 points ? while Sporting were held to a 1-1 truce with Air India in Mumbai. 

East Bengal with 31 points were the runners-up. 

In Ludhiana, Eduardo Coelho ? who was declared the Man of the Match ? hit the winner against JCT in the 31st minute of the match. 

Mohun Bagan exhibited excellent ball control as the hosts failed to cope up with their rivals performance. 

The hosts earned as many as nine corners but failed to translate the chances into goals. 

 It was truly a great feat by the team under Biswajit Bhattacharyas guidance. The new coach took over when the team was reeling under the relegation threat. But he inspired them to a stunning five-match winning run, which helped them sniff at the title for a while. 

In Mumbai, Sporting notched a late equaliser to hold Air India 1-1 at the Cooperage. Paresh Shivalkar put Air India ahead in the fifth minute of the match before Joe Rodrigues struck the equaliser for the Goans eight minutes from the end. 

Air India custodian Raju Ekka was declared the Man-of-the-Match for his sterling display under the bar. 

Air India concluded their engagements with 19 points. 

In Margao, Dempos Stanley Colaco, who hung his boots at the end of the league, was given warm send-off by his teammates after the end of the match. Dempos Joaquim Abrances was named MoM. 

Dempos Ranty Martins, who scored 14 goals, got the Golden Boot award with a cash prize of Rs 50,000. 

Both Dempo and Mahindra matched evenly in the first-half. The hosts who created a couple of chances with a Joaquim header collected by keeper Sandip Nandy and Johnny DCruz shot missing the target narrowly. 

The change of ends saw Dempo holding the edge over their rival and came close to scoring twice but Sandip again rose to the occasion to deny Roberto Silva. 

Meanwhile, the Super Cup match between Mahindra United and East Bengal will be played at Cooperage on May 27.

 Quick Takes

 Brazils security beefed up

 Weggis: Additional security 

 guards have been employed for Brazils training camp 

 on Saturday after five fans invaded the teams practice 

 on Friday. Guards stood on the sidelines of the 5,000-seat 

 arena after three men and two women got on the field on 

 Friday and ran towards the players. One of the women hugged 

 Ronaldinho.

 A small seating section behind 

 one of the goals was also closed to keep fans from getting 

 too close to the players.

 The Brazilian squad spent most 

 of Saturdays morning session working out in the gym 

 and only briefly made it onto the practice field.

 Dida: Forgive Barbosa

 Weggis: Brazils World 

 Cup goalkeeper Dida has preached forgiveness for Moacir 

 Barbosa who was vilified after Brazil lost the 1950 final 

 to Uruguay. Barbosa was in goal when Brazil, hosting the 

 1950 edition and hot favourites to win, were beaten 1-2 

 in front of a shocked crowd of nearly 200,000 people at 

 the Maracana Stadium.

 Barbosa was crucified for 

 that final and its sad that we remember him just for 

 that moment, Dida said on Saturday. In fact, 

 he made a lot of great saves and he did a lot to help the 

 Brazilian team and he should also be remembered for that, 

 not just for one game which marked his life for ever.

 Lippi calm, but embittered

 Rome: Italy coach Marcello 

 Lippi said on Saturday that he was calm but 

 embittered after his son was placed under investigation 

 in the wide-ranging scandal engulfing Italian soccer.

 Ive spoken to him, 

 hes calm and embittered ? exactly like me, Marcello 

 Lippi said at Italys training camp in Florence.

 Serbia blow

 Belgrade: Serbia and Montenegro 

 striker Mirko Vucinic will miss the World Cup with a knee 

 injury and manager Ilija Petkovic will name a replacement 

 in the next few days. We will call up a player we 

 need as we have five fit strikers at the moment, Petkovic 

 said on Saturday. 

 Santos for Bruno

 Lisbon: Portugals 

 third choice goalkeeper Bruno Vale has pulled out of the 

 World Cup squad because of injury, his football federation 

 said on Saturday. Coach Luiz Felipe Scolari named Paulo 

 Santos, 33, as his replacement. Bruno Vale fractured his 

 right foot on Thursday in an under-21 match against Serbia 

 and Montenegro at the European championship in Portugal.

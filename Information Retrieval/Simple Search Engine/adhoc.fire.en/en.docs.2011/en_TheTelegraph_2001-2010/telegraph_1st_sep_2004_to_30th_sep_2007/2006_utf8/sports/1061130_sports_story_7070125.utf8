A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Meghna Bal, Sharmila Nicollet and Vaishavi Sinha have been selected to represent India in the womens golf competition at the Doha Asian Games. All three are junior golfers Meghna is 17, while Sharmila and Vaishavi are 15. With a number of seniors turning pro in recent times, this trio is the best India has to offer. 

Announcing the names on Wednesday, non-playing captain Anu Bindra said the realistic target in Doha is to finish among the top four. Vikram Sethi will be the coach. 

The ladies section of the Indian Golf Union arranged a preparatory camp in Delhi earlier this month. The girls were also sent to Doha to get a feel of the course, said Bindra. 

Team and individual golds will be up for grabs during the three-day strokeplay event from December 8-10. The Indian team, being sponsored by the DCM Group, leaves on Tuesday.

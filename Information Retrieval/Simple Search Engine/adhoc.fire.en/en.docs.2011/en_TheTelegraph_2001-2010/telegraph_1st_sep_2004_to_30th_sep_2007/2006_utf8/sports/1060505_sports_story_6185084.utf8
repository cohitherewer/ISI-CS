The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC meeting today

Dubai: The ICC Cricket Committee, headed by Sunil Gavaskar, will meet here on Friday and Saturday. Among other things, the members will debate whether or not to allow players a certain number of appeals per innings if they feel a decision made by the on-field umpire is incorrect. 

If the committee supports the idea and it is accepted by the chief executives committee and the ICC board, it would be adopted at the Champions Trophy in India. If the trial proves successful, it would be repeated at next years World Cup.

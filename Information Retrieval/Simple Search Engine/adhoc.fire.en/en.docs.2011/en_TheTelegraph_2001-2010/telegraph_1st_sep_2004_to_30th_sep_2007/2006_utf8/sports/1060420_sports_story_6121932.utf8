 Concerned CA seeks Ponting version

Melbourne: Expressing concern over Ricky Pontings behaviour in the second Test against Bangladesh, Cricket Australia (CA) chief executive James Sutherland has sought the skippers version of the story for a better understanding of the issue. 

I am intending to talk to him. I want to get Rickys perspective on that to get a better understanding of what happened, Sutherland said. When Australian players are reported and are found guilty, Ive got concerns about that. 

Ponting was fined 25 per cent of his match fee after being found guilty of showing dissent following a complaint by the Bangladesh team. 

Ponting had objected to a third umpires decision, which ruled Bangladesh batsman Aftab Ahmed not out after TV replays proved inconclusive. 

 Gavaskar support 

There was welcome support for Ponting and his team from Dave Richardson and Sunil Gavaskar. 

Richardson, the ICCs general manager, has called for a right be given to ODI captains to challenge umpires decisions. 

Gavaskar, chairman of ICCs Cricket Committee spoke in defence of Ponting. 

Gavaskar said Ponting was aware of his responsibilities and dismissed the episode as just one of those things. 

 I dont think there 

 is any problem with Ricky at all. What happened was just 

 one of those things, he said. (Agencies)

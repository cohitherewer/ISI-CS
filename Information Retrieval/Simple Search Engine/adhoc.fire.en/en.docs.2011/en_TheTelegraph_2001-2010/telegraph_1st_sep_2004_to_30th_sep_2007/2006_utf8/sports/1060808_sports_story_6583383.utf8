 Villeneuve, BMW Sauber part ways

Budapest: BMW Sauber parted company with Jacques Villeneuve on Monday after replacing the 1997 Formula One world champion with Polands Robert Kubica in Sundays Hungarian Grand Prix. 

The team said that the Canadian would not drive for them again this season, a decision that looks sure to end the 35-year-olds Grand Prix career after 163 races and 11 victories. 

Following discussions last week, Jacques Villeneuve and the BMW Sauber F1 team agreed to terminate their current contract with immediate effect five races ahead of schedule, the statement said. 

Villeneuve said the team had told him last week that they wanted to try out Kubica and could offer him no assurances of a drive after Hungary. 

This is really disappointing as I was looking forward to working with BMW on longer terms going into next season, he said on his personal website. (Reuters)

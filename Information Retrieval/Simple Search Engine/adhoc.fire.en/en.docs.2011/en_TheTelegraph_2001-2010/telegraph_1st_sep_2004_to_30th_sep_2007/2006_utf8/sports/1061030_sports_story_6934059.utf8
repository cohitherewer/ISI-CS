 New AIFF rule set to affect age-group meets 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: On Sunday, India kicked off their campaign with a 1-1 draw against Kyrgyzstan in search of a possible place in the semi-finals of the Asian Youth (under-20) Championships which will automatically qualify them for the World Youth Cup in Canada. But, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has brought in a kind of change in the eligibility rule of the age group tournaments that might jeopardise the chances of a host of youngsters from playing in different national championships. 

In the under-19 national championships for the B.C. Roy Trophy last year, players born on and after January 1, 1987 were eligible to play. This year, it was naturally expected to be a tournament for boys born after January, 1988, but the AIFF has suddenly made it a tournament for players born on and after January 1, 1989. 

The new rule, in fact, has affected all the age group tournaments. In under-16 for the Mir Iqbal Qasim Trophy, the new eligibility is for boys, born on and after January 1, 1992 compared to 1990 last year. 

The under-21 tourney for M Dutta Roy Trophy is now for footballers born on and after January 1, 1987. Last year it was played with 1985-born players. 

The AIFF says that the new rule is in conformity with the Asian championships, but is silent over the fate of the boys, who will miss out playing in their respective age group tourneys because of the sudden two-year jump in the eligibility rules. 

In March 2006, we informed the state associations about the change of rules and asked for their suggestions, said an AIFF official. As we did not receive any adverse remark, we went ahead with our plans. 

Since our target is to raise the national teams for the Asian age group meets, which are played once in two years, we raised the eligibility bar by two years. The official, however, could not explain why the rule has also been changed for the under-21 tournament, which is not a part of the Asian meets. 

The problem, however, does not end here. Despite being written to by some of the state associations, the AIFF is yet to come out with a clear-cut policy on this subject and itself not sure what will be the cut-off dates for next years tournaments. 

In any other country like Japan and South Korea, the federations have already laid down age group policies till the 2012 Olympics. All the federation official could say on the subject is that a comprehensive policy will soon be announced.

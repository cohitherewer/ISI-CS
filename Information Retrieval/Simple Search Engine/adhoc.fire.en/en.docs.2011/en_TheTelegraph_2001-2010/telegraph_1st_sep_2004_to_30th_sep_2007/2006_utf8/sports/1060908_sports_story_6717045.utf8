 Kumble wants to sign off in style

 2007 World Cup

 Bangalore: Indias 

 most successful bowler Anil Kumble is determined to make 

 it to the 2007 World Cup and sign off in style.

 Left out of the team for the ICC 

 Champions Trophy to be played on his home turf in October-November 

 due to fitness issues, Kumble is hopeful of being a part 

 of the World Cup squad.

 The 35-year-old engineer, one 

 of the games greatest spinners with 533 Test wickets 

 and 329 ODI scalps, said on Thursday: I will have 

 to make it to the World Cup squad to sign off in style.

 The Bangalore bowler is banking 

 on matches slated after the Champions Trophy to make the 

 World Cup squad.

 Im hopeful that I 

 will be a part of the set up (for World Cup). Some more 

 international matches are coming up after the Champions 

 Trophy. It all depends on that, he said.

 I dont think age has 

 got anything to do with cricket. Its all about your 

 fitness, about how you feel and how you are bowling.

 In terms of fitness, I am 

 really feeling good. There is a little bit of tendonitis 

 problem in my shoulder but the rest of the body is absolutely 

 fine. Its just a matter of couple of weeks before 

 I should be back to bowling properly.

 I was looking forward to 

 being a part of the Champions Trophy. But you cannot help 

 injuries when you play so much of cricket. Sometimes you 

 need a bit of luck too. I was doing well but then this tendonitis 

 (happened). But it is not serious, theres a lot of 

 cricket coming up and Im really looking forward to 

 that. (PTI)

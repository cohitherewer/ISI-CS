The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The master faces the apprentice today

Melbourne: Sundays Australian Open final between Roger Federer and Marcos Baghdatis is looming as a classic battle between the master and his apprentice. 

Baghdatis is the sentimental favourite, an unlikely but charismatic figure who has defied the odds to reach his first Grand Slam final. 

His incredible odyssey has captured the imagination of tennis fans the world over, drawing huge support from Melbournes large Greek community and putting his homeland of Cyprus in the sporting spotlight. 

He has already beaten some of the biggest names in the sport including Andy Roddick and David Nalbandian, but knows that Federer is an entirely different proposition. 

The Swiss is on way to tennis immortality. The 24-year-old Swiss has already won six Grand Slam titles and a seventh will take him halfway to Pete Sampras record tally of 14. 

Federer doesnt like talking about history, but seems to have no problems rewriting it. 

He already has 34 career titles, including the 2004 Australian Open, is on a 51-match winning streak on hardcourts and victory over Baghdatis will give him a third Grand Slam in a row. 

Only the French Open has eluded him. 

Ive always got to keep on performing, Federer told a news conference. I only think about what I have to do in my next match, not about what I still have to achieve to be a legend... Federer has beaten Baghdatis in all of their three previous meetings, including the quarters at Doha earlier this month. (Reuters)

 Parreira names line-up for opening match

Rio de Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira confidently named his starting line-up on Wednesday for his teams opening World Cup match against Croatia next month. 

Parreira, whose side play Croatia on June 13 and face Australia and Japan in their first round group, will field his so-called magic quartet of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Adriano and Kaka. 

Injury and fitness-permitting, the world champions team will be the one that started the World Cup qualifier against Venezuela in October, Brazils last competitive match. 

To start the Cup, it will be the quartet, Parreira said. The team which starts the Cup will be the same one which finished the qualifiers, we have to be coherent. 

Parreira also said that Ronaldinho would be allowed to play with the same freedom he enjoys at Barcelona. 

Its absurd to say that he plays differently in the national team and Barcelona because of his positioning, Parreira said. He has complete freedom in the Brazil team. The difference is that, when he plays for his club, he has the stage to himself and in the national team he has to divide it with other stars. 

Parreira declined to comment further about who else would be included in the 23-man squad.

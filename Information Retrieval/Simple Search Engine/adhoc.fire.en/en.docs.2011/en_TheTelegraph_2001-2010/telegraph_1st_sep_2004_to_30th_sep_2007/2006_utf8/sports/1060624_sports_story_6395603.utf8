 Quick Takes

 Reyna quits international stage

 Hamburg: United States 

 captain Claudio Reyna retired from international soccer 

 Friday, a day after his final World Cup game ended with 

 a disappointing loss and injury. Reyna, who has been the 

 US captain for almost eight years, playing a key role in 

 the teams surprising run to the 2002 quarter finals. 

 But his final World Cup proved disappointing. The US finished 

 last in group E with one point after losing 1-2 to Ghana 

 on Thursday in a game the Americans needed to win to advance 

 to the second round. He sprained a ligament in his left 

 knee about midway through the first half. 

 Reyna, who will continue to play 

 club soccer with Manchester City in England, had eight goals 

 in 112 appearances with the US team.

 Not favourites vs Ecuador: 

 Lampard

 Freiburg: England fans 

 were relieved when the team drew Ecuador rather than Germany 

 in the second round. Frank Lampard warned that doesnt 

 make England the favourites for the match on Sunday in Stuttgart, 

 however.

 People will call us favourites 

 but we have to take no notice of that and make sure were 

 at it from the start, the England midfielder said. 

 Its a game we are desperate to win and you get 

 the stage now that if you dont perform you are out 

 of it. 

 50,000 England fans expected

 Stuttgart: About 50,000 

 England fans are expected to travel to Stuttgart for the 

 teams second-round match against Ecuador on Sunday, 

 British and German police said Friday.

 Stuttgart police chief Siegfried 

 Stumpf said 1,800 of his officers would be on patrol, along 

 with a contingent of British police.

 For us, the game is not 

 something out of the ordinary, Stumpf said. But 

 if the situation requires it, well have a visible 

 uniformed presence. 

 3 SA fans suffocate

 Cape Town: Three South 

 African men have suffocated to death watching a Soccer World 

 Cup match, succumbing to fumes from a petrol generator they 

 used to power a TV, a South African newspaper reported on 

 Friday.

 The men were staying in a partly-completed 

 house in Cape Town on Wednesday night to guard it during 

 construction when they died, the paper said. The house was 

 still not connected to electricity. They were discovered 

 by the builders when they arrived for work on Thursday. 

 Draw enough for Dutch royals

 Freiburg: The House of 

 Orange survived. The 0-0 draw between The Netherlands and 

 Argentina was a good result for the family of Dutch Crown 

 Prince Willem Alexander and his Argentine-born wife, Princess 

 Maxima.

 It was a beautiful result, 

 the Crown Prince said after watching the game. The draw 

 allowed Argentina to advance from group C as winners and 

 The Netherlands remained unbeaten in what was considered 

 the toughest first-round group.

 The prince said his wife had made 

 a commitment to back her adopted nation if it plays her 

 South American country of birth. For all other games, 

 she can back Argentina, the Crown Prince said. 

 Ghanaian casualties

 Accra: A Ghanaian man and 

 two children were killed by speeding cars during raucous 

 street parties after the West African country won soccer 

 matches that clinched them a place in the World Cup last 

 16, police said on Friday.

 Ghana became the only African 

 team to make it to the second round prompting big celebrations 

 as fans jumped on car bonnets, danced in the street and 

 even lay on the ground in front of traffic. 

 Betting ring busted

 Kuala Lumpur: Malaysian 

 police have arrested seven people who ran illegal soccer 

 betting rings set up especially for the World Cup, the official 

 Bernama news agency reported.

 Three men were arrested Tuesday 

 and four others were seized on Wednesday, Bernama said.

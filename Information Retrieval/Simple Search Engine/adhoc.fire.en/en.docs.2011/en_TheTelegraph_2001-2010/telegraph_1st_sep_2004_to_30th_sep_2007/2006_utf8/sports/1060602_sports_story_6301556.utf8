St Johns: Their reputation in tatters, India will rely on their experienced campaigners to restore their pride when they take on the West Indies in the four-Test series starting here on Friday. 

Rahul Dravids men have a point or two to prove after the humiliating 1-4 loss in the one-day series, but they will have to contend with a home team that is on a high and seems to have rediscovered its old glory and winning ways. 

The Caribbean pitches have proved to be, surprisingly, too slow even to the players of subcontinent. Patience is the key on such tracks, and neither the batsmen nor the bowlers displayed this virtue in the limited-overs series. India, however, are bracing themselves for a lively pitch at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

And, thanks to some strange selection policies, India will be without their best bowler on view, Ajit Agarkar. 

Irfan Pathans form also has been a concern and Greg Chappell said as much the other day. Pathan has lost his sting and in an effort to bowl faster, he is even sacrificing line and length and the movement he gets in early overs. 

Still, most likely he will be played, as dropping him would mean going into the game with four bowlers. Both Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble are likely to occupy the spinners slot while the remaining two bowling spots would go to Munaf Patel and Sreesanth. 

The two spinners are quality spinners, but even though the wickets are slow here, they dont spin as much as it does in India, Dravid said. 

Going by our experience, they start getting slower and slower. Even for a spinner, its a challenge because a lot of time bat and pad edges dont carry. 

We realise that you dont win till you get 20 wickets. If you play five bowlers then it puts a certain pressure on your batting. You want your wicketkeeper and others to contribute with the bat, he said. 

Going by our experience in Pakistan, slow wickets put a lot of pressure on your bowlers because it is a lot of hard work. 

West Indies captain Brian Lara, whose two world record Test scores of 375 and 400 not out were made at St Johns, said the venue had been a good for him and his team. I dont think weve lost too many Test matches here, Lara said. 

West Indies coach Bennett King said fast bowler Corey Collymore (right ankle) and batsmen Shivnarine Chanderpaul (left hamstring) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (right wrist) were available for selection. 

Dravid maintained that the loss in the one-day series wouldnt make much difference because the requirements of Test cricket were greatly different. 

When we analysed the one-day series we realise that two or three critical areas were different to what we experience in Tests. 

Fielding of course is one area which we carry in both forms of the game and catching is going to be very important in the Tests. 

Dravid said his side had identified the men who would be standing in the close-in cordon, an area which cost his team heavily in the Mumbai Test against England in March. 

We havent had much time to put it in practice but we have spoken about it and the guys are looking to stand in that position.

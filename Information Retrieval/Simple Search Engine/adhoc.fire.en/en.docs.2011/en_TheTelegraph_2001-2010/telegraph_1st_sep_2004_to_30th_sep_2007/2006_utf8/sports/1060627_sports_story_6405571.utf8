The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I have proved myself: Totti

Kaiserslautern: Italian playmaker Francesco Totti said he had proved himself by scoring a stoppage-time penalty that gave 10-man Italy a 1-0 win over Australia in the World Cup second round on Monday. 

So far the critics have really laid into me, but Ive always said Id prove myself on the pitch, Totti told reporters after keeping his nerve to score with the very last kick of the game. 

We suffered for long periods of the match, but in the end it was the whole team that won this match because Australia were a strong side. Now I think we can go a long way in this tournament, he added. 

The important thing (when we went down to 10 men) was to keep our heads. 

Italy were reduced to 10 men in the 50th minute when Marco Materazzi was given a straight red card for a foul. 

The controversial penalty came when defender Fabio Grosso tumbled over a challenge by Lucas Neill. 

Italian coach Marcello Lippi had nothing but praise for his team. 

Its an indescribable joy. Im really delighted, he told reporters. These lads showed great heart, great character and also great quality. 

In the second half, down to 10 men against 11 we suffered ? but still gave very little away. At the end, there was this superb move by Grosso who went into the area ... And it was a clear penalty. 

Australia coach Guus Hiddink was less convinced about the decision to award a penalty. 

Overall you can have doubts about the penalty, Hiddink told reporters. 

We are very disappointed because we were so close, but I can be very proud of the team. I think the only thing we can blame ourselves for is that we did not get a goal. 

Defeat left a bitter taste for Australias players. 

I think we dominated the match for many parts and with an extra player it made it easier for us, but its a really bad way to go out, said Australian captain Mark Viduka. 

Were obviously happy weve got this far, but (it was) so disappointing to go out in the fashion we did. 

Australian midfielder Tim Cahill was also very down. 

Its a feeling of disbelief. Were trying to break them down and then they get a lucky break, he falls over in the box and gets a penalty, he said.

Hong Kong: The International team defied the odds to beat a combined Europe-US side and capture the inaugural Goodwill Trophy on Tuesday. 

Holding a one-point lead from the Mondays foursomes, Retief Goosens side split the singles matches 4-4 to win 6-and-a-half to 5-and-a-half overall. 

We beat a great team and a lot of strong players, said South African Goosen. We knew it was going to be a close match and it all came down to the final hole in the last match. 

The clincher for the International team came from Australian veteran Peter Senior, 47, the oldest player on the field, who held off Welshman Bradley Dredge to win the 18th hole. 

South Korean K.J. Choi also showed grit to carve out a one-shot victory over Briton Paul Casey on the Jack Nicklaus-designed Mission Hills Golf Club in Shenzhen. 

We came up just short and are disappointed. But all credit to Retief and his team on winning the inaugural Goodwill Trophy, said losing captain Colin Montgomerie, who beat Goosen in the singles. 

In other matches, Swede Henrik Stenson beat Jeev Milkha Singh of India 3 amp; 2, whilst Chinas Zhang Lian-wei faltered against Spaniard Alejandro Canizares, throwing away his one-shot lead at the 15th hole and losing the match by a stroke. 

The Goodwill Trophy has been developed as a collaborative event between Mission Hills and the Celtic Manor Resort, host of the 2010 Ryder Cup, to enhance trade, tourism and cultural exchange between the UK and China through golf. Next years tournament will be held at the Celtic Manor course in Wales.

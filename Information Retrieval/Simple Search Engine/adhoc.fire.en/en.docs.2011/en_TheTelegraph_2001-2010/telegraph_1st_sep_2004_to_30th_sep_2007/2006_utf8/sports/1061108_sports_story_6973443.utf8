Calcutta: Former India captain Sourav is a victim of cricket politics, feels former New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns. 

India could face problems in next years World Cup in the West Indies for the lack of experience in the team. I feel there is internal politics working against Ganguly, Cairns said here on Tuesday. He and New Zealand left-arm spinner were in the city for a promotional event. 

Cairns felt that a player of Souravs calibre should walk into the Indian squad any day. With such a record in both forms of the game, he naturally gets in. He should be an asset for any team. 

Veteran Anil Kumbles prolonged exclusion from the shorter version also surprised Cairns. I dont know why experienced guys like Anil, Zaheer (Khan) were out of the squad so long.... They have performed excellently in the past and are in good nick. India will need the experienced guys for the World Cup. 

Both Kumble and Zaheer have been recently recalled for the ODI series in South Africa. 

Cairns also felt that more time should be given to Greg Chappell to produce results. His manner of doing things is quite different from others.... There have been ups and downs for Chappell. I would suggest he be given some more time. 

Asked whether coaching was on his agenda, Cairns said he was not cut out for it. Coaching is not for me. I really dont like coaching as I dont have the patience, Cairns signed off.

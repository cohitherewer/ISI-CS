 Pak forced to abandon victory charge

Cardiff: The first ODI between England and Pakistan was abandoned because of the weather (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). 

Pakistan were set 159 runs to win from 32 overs, according to the Duckworth-Lewis calculation. The original target was 203 before a 95-minute rain interruption. 

The tourists faced only seven overs before the rain came down again when they were on 46 for one. 

Stuart Broad trapped Shoaib Malik lbw but Mohammad Hafeez and Younis Khan batted aggressively as England struggled to cope with a slippery ball and wet outfield. 

Earlier, Mohammed Asif claimed three for 28 to help restrict England to 202 from 49.2 overs. England lost their last six batsmen for 36 as Asif and Shoaib Akhtar wreaked havoc. (Reuters)

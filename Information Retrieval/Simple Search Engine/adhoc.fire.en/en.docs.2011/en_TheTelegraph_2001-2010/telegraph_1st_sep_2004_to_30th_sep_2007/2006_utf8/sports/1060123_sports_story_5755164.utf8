Faisalabad: Opener Rahul Dravid played another dogged innings as he led Indias reply following Pakistans mammoth 588, built around Shahid Afridis blazing century, in the second Test here on Sunday. 

Dravid was batting on 46 as the Indians reached 110 for one in their first innings at stumps on Day II, still 279 shy of follow-on. V.V.S. Laxman, batting on 28, was accompanying the Indian captain. 

Dravids resolute knock came after his bowlers took a hammering from Afridi who recorded a career-best 156, his second successive century in the series. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq was the other century maker with 119 as he battled back spasms to register his 25th Test hundred. 

The Indian reposte began on a confident note before Virender Sehwag, who cracked a belligerent double hundred in the first Test, perished after a cameo 31. 

But with the pitch at the Iqbal Stadium so lifeless as it was at the Gaddafi Stadium at Lahore, it was not beyond Dravid to steer his team clear of any early loss of wickets. 

The flamboyant Afridi bludgeoned his way to his fifth century in 22 Tests and third against India. 

Afridi slammed 20 fours and six sixes in his blistering 128-ball knock, his second century in successive Tests against the visitors after his 80-ball 103 at Lahore in the drawn opening Test, to lead the run-charge on Day II. 

The 25-year-old Karachi-based swashbuckler fell when he skied Kumble to Yuvraj Singh, running in from the deep to accept the catch at square leg. 

Afridi reached his century with a pulled six off left arm pacer Irfan Pathan in 96 balls. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan will consult a specialist to find out if a niggling shoulder problem will keep him out of the third Test from January 29.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jaitley suggestion accepted by Pawar

 - Tenure of office-bearers and selectors

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Sharad Pawar and Arun Jaitley are rivals in politics, but that didnt stop the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president from accepting his suggestion that the tenure of the office-bearers (and selectors) be two and not three years. 

Jaitleys suggestion had merit and the ruling group accepted what he said on condition that the amendments to the constitution be unanimous. Thats what happened, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Thursday evening. 

A former Union law minister, Jaitley heads the Delhi and District Cricket Association. 

Agencies add: The Boards special general meeting in Mumbai decided that the term of office-bearers and selectors, which was for one year till now, would be for two years henceforth with the provision they can be re-elected for an additional year. However, the current set of office-bearers will be liable to only two more years after their term ends this September, provided they are re-elected. 

It was also decided that each one of the Boards affiliated units would start a womens wing to take care of womens cricket. 

It also authorised Pawar, who chaired the meeting, to decide on the formation of various committees for holding the 2011 World Cup jointly with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. All these decisions were taken unanimously and no voting took place, BCCI vice-president Shashank Manohar confirmed at a press conference. 

It has also been decided that the candidate standing for presidentship and vice-presidentship should be proposed by a member from the same zone which he represents though the seconder could be from outside the zone, Manohar said. If their performance is not satisfactory another person from the same zone can be elected for the third year. 

It has also been decided that the chairman would have an additional vote during elections as at present. This has been mired in controversy over the last four or five years, he pointed out. 

The meeting also decided to change the provisions of its constitution to give effect to its working committees decision to help talented young sportspersons in disciplines other than cricket to train overseas. 

Manohar made it clear that the BCCI would not have a womens wing but the units affiliated to it will have one each to run womens cricket after one year.

Dhanbad: Bengal started their East Zone One-day meet on a scintillating note when they demolished Tripura by seven wickets and ensured a bonus point here on Saturday. 

Tripura made a mess of their decision to bat first at the Tata Digwadih Stadium and were skittled out for just 157 runs in 49.1 overs. Sourashish Lahiri emerged as the most successful bowler for Bengal returning the figures of 10-2-27-3. 

To get a bonus point, Bengal needed to reach the target at a run rate 1.25 times more than that of Tripura. They eventually did it with utter ease, having completed the job in 32.4 overs. 

Deep Dasgupta later hailed the victory as a team effort. I should not want to give credit to any individual, it was a victory of the team, the Bengal captain maintained. Everybody played their part to help us get a nice win, he added. 

Sanjib Sanyal and Subhamoy Das opened the run chase, which required a bit of aggression and alacrity at the outset. The duo put on 46 runs off 57 balls before Sanyal was caught by Avijit Dey of Manoj Singh. His score of 16 contained two boundaries off 20 balls. 

Avishek Jhunjhunwala joined Subhamoy at the crease. The latter was playing well and hit the solitary overboundary of the match. He made 43 (which also included 6 hits to the fence) before castled by Manoj Singh. Jhunjhunwala (35) then perished with the teams score reading at 124 for three. Manoj Tewari and super sub Subhajit Paul (who substituted Shib Shankar Paul) coasted Bengal to the victory mark. Tewari hit the winning run, a boundary through square. 

Earlier, Tripura started well, but once Bappa Das departed ? being caught behind off Sanyal ? they could not withstand the pressure of the Bengal attack. 

Next to go was Angshu Lamba, beaten all ends up by Ranadeb Bose. Rajesh Banik and Timir Chand followed the suit in quick succession as Bengal went for the jugular. Sourashish then lopped off the tail. 

Meanwhile, Deep hinted after the match former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who is expected to join the squad and play in the second match on Monday, will open the innings. He is a senior player and has been opening for India? so I will definitely expect him to open against Jharkhand, Deep said.

 Eriksson must plan for life without Rooney

 - Medical reality mocks the England coachs words about the strikers chances 

 HENRY WINTER

 Rooney 

One by one the fans came up outside Stamford Bridge on Saturday, mournfully seeking news about Manchester Uniteds beloved Wayne Rooney. How is he? they asked, their eyes touched with fear. They had seen him fall at speed, seen him clutch his right foot in agony. Hope hes all right, the fans said. And these were Chelsea diehards. 

I love England as well, one of the blue-clad fraternity explained. They understand that Rooney represents one club, United, but he also represents Englands best chance of winning the World Cup this summer. 

The sight of Rooney being borne from the fray on a stretcher may be viewed retrospectively as a metaphor for Englands World Cup dream. 

Chelsea fans knew the dismay that was enveloping England. When one of their number uttered a tasteless joke about a passing ambulance being Rooneys taxi he was roundly condemned. Rooney, for all his association with United, is a special talent who belongs to the nation. No other players injury would so chill the blood of rival fans. 

No wonder Chelsea players sought to enter the away dressing room. John Terry and Joe Cole were turned away by Uniteds security. When I saw the stretcher come on for Wayne, I thought, Oh s***, Cole said. Hes a mate. But however long they say hell be injured for, Im sure it will be half or three-quarters that because he has a winning character. 

Rooney does, but he fights nature. Only a miracle will heal his metatarsal in time. Those who chronicle the national obsession are too often too free and easy with words like tragedy and disaster yet it was impossible not to feel a sense of utter frustration as Rooney hit the floor and stayed there. Frustration for a likeable lad and for England. The split-second of silence that seized the Bridge encapsulated the immense respect Rooney engenders. 

Englands head coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, talks optimistically about Rooneys chances but medical reality mocks his words. 

Underneath, Eriksson knows. The look of thunder on the Swedes usually glacial face as he left the ground said it all. Jose Mourinho might not have been the only manager to throw away a winners medal at the Bridge on Saturday. Lets get real. The World Cup is almost upon England, scarcely 38 days away. 

Eriksson must plan for life without Rooney. Englands head coach has many faults but he is utterly correct on one point: the English play too much intense, speed-obsessed, physical football. As he marched from the Bridge, almost dragging Nancy with him, Eriksson could have been forgiven for reflecting on Michel Platinis verdict on the damage the marathon English season inflicts on England internationals: You are lions in the autumn but lambs in the summer. 

Just look at the number of absent friends from past World Cups. Steven Gerrard and Gary Neville missed South Korea and Japan in 2002 while David Beckham, like Neville brought low by a metatarsal, was a shadow of his dynamic self. Why? The Rollerball nature of the Premiership and the FA Cup hardly allows players time to breathe. 

So is Englands dream over? Eriksson faces two decisions, beginning with the gamble on selecting Rooney in his World Cup 23, as he surely will despite knowing that tournament rules mean those players carrying injuries sustained before May 15 cannot then be replaced. 

Touching all the wood in the hunting forests outside Englands Black Forest retreat, Michael Owen should be fit, so Eriksson can introduce Plan B: step forward Peter Crouch. If Owen remains hors de combat, Eriksson could start Jermain Defoe alongside Crouch or go 4-1-4-1, with Michael Carrick holding and Gerrard and Frank Lampard bombing forward towards Crouch. 

Rooneys injury effectively guarantees Darren Bents inclusion, possibly Darius Vassells, as Eriksson will have to select five strikers. 

What a devastating weekend.

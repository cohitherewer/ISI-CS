 Schumi hopes go up in smoke

 - Alonso needs just one point to retain world championship crown 

Suzuka: Renaults Fernando Alonso had a second successive Formula One title in his grasp on Sunday after Michael Schumachers hopes went up in smoke at the Japanese Grand Prix. 

The 25-year-old Spaniard punched the air in delight and then cruised to a stunning victory as his Ferrari rival pulled over with a blown engine 17 laps from the end of a race he had dominated. 

Alonso is now 10 points clear, and needing only one more from the final race in Brazil to be sure of retaining the crown he won last year. 

Schumacher, who had hoped to end his career with an unprecedented and remarkable eighth title after being 25 points behind the reigning champion in June, recognised that the dream was effectively over. 

To be honest, I dont think theres any chance left for the championship, Schumacher told Germanys RTL television. 

While Alonso has 126 points to the Ferrari greats 116, Renault stretched their lead over the Italian glamour team to nine points. 

Both men have seven wins each, meaning that the only way that Schumacher can walk away from Formula One on top is by winning in Brazil while Alonso fails to score a point. 

Until the fateful plume of smoke, the most successful driver the sport has ever seen appeared to have taken the upper hand in a knife-edge championship battle. 

Winner of five of the preceding seven races, he slipped easily past obliging teammate Felipe Massa on the third lap and was cruising to a predictable 92nd career victory when the engine failure occurred. 

Schumacher climbed out of his car, waved to the crowd and then waited calmly for marshals to unlock an exit gate before walking slowly back to the pits, where he hugged team boss Jean Todt and technical director Ross Brawn. 

Massa finished second, 16.1 seconds behind with Renaults Giancarlo Fisichella in third place. 

Alonso had started in fifth place but he threw caution to the wind when the lights went out. 

 He then overtook Ralf Schumachers Toyota for 

 third place on lap 13 as Massa pitted and came out ahead 

 of the Brazilian after his own first stop two laps later.

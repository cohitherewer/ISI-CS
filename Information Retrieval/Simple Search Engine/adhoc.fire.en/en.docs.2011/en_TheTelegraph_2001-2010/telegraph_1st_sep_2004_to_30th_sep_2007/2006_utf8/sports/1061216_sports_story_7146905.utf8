 England under hammer again

 - England fall for 215, Aussies 148 ahead 

Perth: Ricky Ponting and Matthew Hayden scored half-centuries to help Australia seize control of the third Ashes Test against England at the WACA on Friday. 

Ponting continued his insatiable run-feast with an unbeaten 57 and Hayden posted his best score of the series so far (57 batting) with Australia on 119 for one in their second innings, ahead by 148 runs. 

Seamer Matthew Hoggard bowled Justin Langer with the first ball of the Australian innings but Englands joy was short-lived as Ponting and Haydens unbroken partnership lifted Australia further after they had dismissed England out for 215. 

England started the day in a strong position at 51 for two in reply to Australias modest first-innings total of 244. 

Kevin Pietersen top-scored with an adventurous 70 and opener Andrew Strauss made a patient 42 but none of Englands other recognised batsman made more than 15. 

Englands dismal total would have been even worse had tail-enders Steve Harmison and Monty Panesar not added 40 for the last wicket after coming to the crease with the tourists in disarray at 175 for nine. 

The pair smacked three boundaries each before Harmison skied a catch to Brett Lee on 23, leaving the charismatic Panesar unbeaten on 16 in his first appearance of the series. 

Stuart Clark picked up three wickets to overtake Hoggard as the leading wicket-taker in the series with 14 victims. 

Any hopes England had of grabbing a first-innings lead evaporated in the morning when they lost Strauss, Paul Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff and Geraint Jones before lunch. 

England slumped to 128 for seven when Sajid Mahmood departed for 10 shortly after lunch before Englands lower-order staged a fightback.

 16 players for rolling camp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Malaysia Tri-Series

 Calcutta: The Board of 

 Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will organise a rolling 

 camp for players in Bangalore from Wednesday to September 

 6. 

 A total of 16 players all 15 

 members of the squad that visited Sri Lanka plus pace bowler 

 Vikram Rajvir Singh have been shortlisted ahead of the 

 tri-series in Kuala Lumpur.

 The national selectors will choose 

 the squads for both the tri-series and the Champions Trophy 

 in Mumbai on September 3.

 That VRV has been called and not 

 someone like Sourav Ganguly confirms that the former India 

 captain is not in the reckoning.

 BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, 

 however, said: The selectors can pick someone outside 

 these 16 players if they so feel. These players were picked 

 as suggested by the coach, captain and the selection committee 

 chairman. Moreover, you cannot throw anyone out from the 

 Lanka squad since they didnt even get to play a single 

 match.

 The rolling camp will 

 be held in batches of five/six players. The Kuala Lumpur-bound 

 players will then go to Chennai for practice matches on 

 September 8 and 9. 

 The tri-series featuring India, 

 Australia and the West Indies will be played between September 

 12 and 24.

 The rolling camp schedule 

 for the players is the following:

 Aug. 30-31: Ajit Agarkar, 

 Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan, Ramesh Powar and Mohammed Kaif.

 Sept. 2-4: Munaf Patel, 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Rudra Pratap Singh, Suresh Raina and 

 Sreesanth.

 Sept. 5-6: Rahul Dravid, 

 Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Harbhajan Singh, Dinesh 

 Mongia and Vikram Rajvir Singh.

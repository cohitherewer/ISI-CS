 Akram: Upset by the way Sourav has been treated

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: Pakistan legend Wasim Akram feels that Sourav Ganguly has got the rough end of the stick and that it is upsetting to see how shoddily the sub-continent treats its heroes. 

At a diabetes awareness programme at a city hotel on Tuesday, Akram said: I am upset by the way he was treated. It has become part of our (Indian and Pakistani) culture to throw away heroes and drop the icons, Akram said. 

According to him, the selectors should have kept in mind Souravs contribution. 

Sourav is Indias most successful captain and one of the finest batsmen in the world with averaging more than 40 in both forms of the game, he stated. 

The former left-arm fast bowler recalled the case of Steve Waugh in 2004. 

Steve was told by Cricket Australia that he would have to make way for the youngsters and in every Test, he was given a standing ovation from the crowd as well as the officials. Thats the way it should be, he said. 

On whether it was time for Sourav to retire, Akram said, it depends on him. But I can tell you if I were in his place, I would have ended my career after such treatment.

 1980s ? MARADONA MAGIC

Spain 1982 

After a laborious start to the tournament, the Italians came alive ? thanks to their star striker Paolo Rossi finding his best form ? to win their third World Cup. But this World Cup is also remembered for two games that have passed into football lore: Brazil vs Italy and, above all, a certain France vs West Germany semi-final. No nation has ever had so much time to prepare a World Cup tournament. Fifa appointed Spain as the host nation to the 12th World Cup, which would play host to 24 teams rather than 16, as had been the case previously. 

Under the new rules, 13 teams qualified from Europe, three from South America, two from Africa, two from Asia/Oceania, two from CONCACAF (Central and North America), and the list was completed by Spain as the hosts and Argentina the World Cup holders. Certain alterations were also made in how the tournament was organised, the new format incorporating three distinct phases: a first round with six groups of four teams from which the top two teams qualified for the second round; a second round with four groups of three teams from which the top team qualified from each group; and finally the semi-finals and the final. 

 Did You Know? 

 Although 24 teams now qualified for the finals, The Netherlands, runners-up in 74 and 78, were not among them? the Dutch having been knocked out in the qualifiers by an impressive French side coached by Michel Hidalgo, which, in turn, only qualified for the second round under duress. 

 The same first-round difficulties were encountered by two other tournament favourites: the West Germans ? beaten 1-2 by Algeria ? sneaked into the second round following a victory over their Austrian neighbours; and the Italians only made it past Cameroon on goal difference. 

 But after shaky starts, France, Germany and Italy really came into their own, winning all their second round matches, while England and Brazil foundered ? the latter knocked out by the Italians in a stupendous game. 

 In the first semi-final, the Italians (thanks to two goals by a revitalised Paolo Rossi), proved too strong for Poland in a one-sided game. The other semi-final, however, was a completely different story. This fabulously dramatic but ultimately cruel game has become one of the most talked-about encounters of all time and one, which will be eternally regretted by the French. The Germans took the lead through Littbarski, before Platini brought France level with a penalty. In extra-time France led 3 -1 but Germany fought back to equalise and then won the game on a penalty shoot-out. 

 The multi-talented Squadra Azzurra comfortably beat West Germany in the final (3-1), helped by another goal from their inspiration, Paolo Rossi. Dino Zoff, the 40-year-old Italian captain, was presented with the trophy by the King of Spain, Juan Carlos. And so Italy became, after Brazil, the second country to win three World Cups. 

 Off-side 

 On June 16, the El Molinon stadium in Gijon was the 

 scene of one of the biggest upsets of all time: rank outsiders 

 Algeria, a total newcomer, took the lead against Germany, 

 saw the ever-competitive northern Europeans draw level, 

 and then, instead of collapsing, pulled out some extra resources 

 and finally won 2-1. Belloumis goal brought the African 

 team a thoroughly deserved win over the double world champions. 

 No sign of any age limits in World Cup football. At 

 just 17 years and 42 days, Northern Ireland forward Norman 

 Whiteside made his World Cup debut in the match against 

 Yugoslavia in Saragossa, and he remains the youngest ever 

 player to take part. At the other end of the range, when 

 the Cameroon legend Roger Milla came on for part of the 

 match against Russia in the 1994 tournament, he was 42 years 

 and 39 days of age ? almost exactly a quarter of a century 

 older than Whiteside. 

 Overwhelming victories are not common and one might 

 think that the biggest wins would be way back in the past. 

 Yet this is not the case ? the record win dates from 1982 

 when Hungary beat El Salvador 10-1. The Hungarians brake 

 their own record, their 9-0 whitewash over Korea in 1954, 

 equalled only by Yugoslavias 9-0 against Zaire in 

 1974.

Mexico 1986 

The next World Cup was awarded to Mexico, who thus became the first country to host the competition on two occasions. However, the Mexicans were selected only as replacement hosts after the original choice, Colombia, announced in 1983 that it could no longer afford to stage footballs greatest tournament. Terrible earthquakes were the prelude to the tournament, but the stadiums were not affected and it was decided to go ahead with the preparations. 

Brazil fell in the quarter-finals on penalties to France, who were in turn muscled out by the West Germans in the semi-finals. 

Maradona, with two goals against both England ? one a handball he proudly dubbed scored by the Hand of God, the other one of the greatest goals ever scored ? and Belgium, led Argentina through and in the final they overcame West Germany 3-2 in front of 115,000 at the Aztec Stadium. 

 Did You Know? 

 Twenty-four teams took part in the finals, as had been the case four years earlier in Spain. This World Cup was different, however, in that all the second round games were played on a knock-out basis. With only eight teams not making it through, the first round threw up very few surprises. A first, however, was Morocco becoming the first African nation to qualify for the second round in a World Cup finals. 

France showed their class in ousting Italy, the world champion, in their second round game, 2-0, before overcoming Brazil in Guadalajara ? rather fortuitously but with a great deal of flair-in one of the greatest matches of all time. Tele Santanas Brazilians twice hit the woodwork and frequently overran Michel Platini and his French side, who eventually won the day largely due to the performance of their goalkeeper Jo? Bats ? amongst other feats, he managed to save a Zico penalty 12 minutes from time. After winning a nail-biting penalty shoot-out (1-1 at full time, then 4-3 on penalties), the French reached the semis. But here, just as in Spain four years earlier, their dreams of World Cup glory were foiled by a fresher German side. 

The Germans, ever-present in the final, once again stumbled at the last step. Beaten by Italy and Paolo Rossi in 1982, this time they were pipped at the post (2-3) by the Argentineans, led by Diego Maradona, fresh from their 2-0 victory over a plucky Belgian side in the semis. 

 Off-side 

 Four years after the very first penalty shoot-out 

 in World Cup history ? France losing to Germany in the semi-final 

 in Seville ? fate would have it that the same two teams 

 would be involved in penalty decisions again. On July 21, 

 the French had the luck this time and beat Brazil: Platinis 

 miss did not matter since Socrates and Julio Cesar both 

 missed for Brazil. On the same day Germany played out a 

 goal-less draw against Mexico, but won the match on penalties, 

 thus ending the home teams dreams of winning the title. 

 Rudi Voellers goal against Argentina was the 

 last by a losing side in the World Cup final. 

 Rummenigge remains the only player to captain the 

 losing team in two finals.

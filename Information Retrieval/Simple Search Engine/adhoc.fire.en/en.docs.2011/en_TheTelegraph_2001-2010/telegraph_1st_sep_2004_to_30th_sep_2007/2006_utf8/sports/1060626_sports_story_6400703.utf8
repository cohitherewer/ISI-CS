 Jeev tied 6th

 Golf round-up 

 Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh 

 failed to qualify for next months British Open after 

 finishing tied sixth in the Mizuno Open Golf Championship 

 here on Sunday.

 Jeev managed to fire three birdies 

 in the last four holes, but it still left him short of a 

 top-four finish he needed to make it to the British Open.

 Koreas S. K. Ho was a comfortable 

 winner as he carded a final round of 71 and a total of 14-under 

 274 to win by three shots over Japans Tatsu Ichihara 

 (69) and David Smail (71).

 Jeev was in the bunch for tied 

 sixth at eight-under 280 alongwith Thai Thammannoon Srirot 

 (70) and two Japanese players ? Tomhiro Kondo (70) and Tohsinori 

 Muto (70).

 In Edinburgh, Jyoti Randhawa overcame 

 a poor front nine to close with a birdie and a card of 74 

 to be in tied 37th place after three rounds in the Johnnie 

 Walker Golf Championship at the PGA Centenary Course at 

 Gleneagles.

 Randhawa had bogeys on the first, 

 seventh and ninth before he recovered with birdies on the 

 10th and 12th. A bogey on the 13th and a closing birdie 

 on the 18th saw him finish at 74.

 In Potomac, a fine round of five 

 birdies saw Daniel Chopra card a four-under 67 and leap 

 from tied eighth to tied third after three rounds at the 

 Booz Allen Classic on the US PGA Tour.

 Arjun Atwal missed the cut after 

 second round.

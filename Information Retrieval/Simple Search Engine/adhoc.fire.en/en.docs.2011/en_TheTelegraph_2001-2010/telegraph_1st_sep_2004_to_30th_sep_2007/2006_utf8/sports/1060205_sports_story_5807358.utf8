Tokyo: Martina Hingis stunned top seed Maria Sharapova 6-3, 6-1 at the Pan Pacific Open on Saturday to reach her first final since coming out of a retirement. 

The former world number one, a Tokyo winner in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2002, outclassed defending champion Sharapova in every department to earn a place in her seventh Pan Pacific final. 

Wildcard Hingis will face another Russian, Elena Dementieva in Sundays championship match after the second seeds 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 win over compatriot Anastasia Myskina. 

It feels like being back in time, said a grinning Hingis. I knew I still had some game in me. You just have to start believing. I believe I still can play really good tennis. 

It took me three years to recharge my body and my brain. This week Ive shown a better game than at the Australian Open. Im improving with every tournament. 

Sharapova, who was just 15 when ankle injuries forced the Swiss into premature retirement in 2002, simply had no answer to Hingis guile and precision, surrendering in just 66 minutes. 

Hingis returned to the game last month, reaching the Australian Open quarter finals and winning the mixed doubles title with Indias Mahesh Bhupathi. 

The Swiss Miss, who won five grand slam singles titles between 1997 and 1999, rolled back the years, mixing power with sublime touch and making Sharapova look ordinary at times. 

Sharapova resorted to delaying tactics, turning her back several times as Hingis, playing in her 99th career semi final, prepared to serve ?? but to no avail. 

Hingis secured the crucial break to go 4-3 up in the first set when her backhand clipped the top of the net and stopped dead. 

The second set was one-way traffic. Hingis broke in the third game when Sharapova netted a backhand and again to go ahead 4-1 after a wild forehand from the world number four. 

She still has a lot of experience and feel for the game, shrugged Sharapova. In the second set I didnt really have that fighting spirit I usually have. 

You know, couldve, wouldve, shouldve but didnt. 

The 25-year-old Hingis was unranked three weeks ago but climbed to 117th after her strong run in Melbourne. Her win over Sharapova will lift Hingis to just outside the top 50. 

In the later match, Dementieva outlasted fourth seed Myskina in a fiercely contested encounter to set up a fifth career meeting with Hingis. 

For me Martina is the best player in the world, said Dementieva, who won her last two matches against Hingis in 2001 and 2002. 

Im so excited to play her. But that doesnt mean Im not going to play tomorrow. I do everything I can to beat her.

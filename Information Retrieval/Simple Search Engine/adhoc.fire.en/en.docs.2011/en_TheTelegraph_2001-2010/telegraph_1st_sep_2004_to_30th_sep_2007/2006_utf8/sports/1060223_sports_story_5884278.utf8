Lahore: After three defeats on the trot, India managed to hold Pakistan to a 1-1 draw in the first Test of the second leg of the hockey series at the National Hockey Stadium here Wednesday. 

The result was enough to help Pakistan clinch the series, having taken an unassailable 3-0 lead in the Indian leg of the six-match rubber. 

The hosts squandered a number of chances and allowed India to snatch the draw through a Tejbir Singh Goal (65th minute) in the final stages of the match. Earlier, penalty corner specialist Mohammed Imran (16th) had given Pakistan the lead in the first half. 

Pakistan strikers threw away several chances in the second half. Shabbir Ahmed, specially, was guilty of missing out on four golden opportunities. 

Also, Indian goalkeeper Bharat Chhetris anticipation and efforts thwarted dangerous attempts by Rehan Butt, Shakeel Abassi and Mudassar Ali Khan. 

Just five minutes before the hooter, an unmarked Tejbir took the Pakistani defence by surprise as he moved with ease to his left inside the D and hit an accurate reverse flick, leaving the rival goalie Salman Akbar and skipper Mohammed Saqlain rooted to their place. 

Shivinder Singh then failed to bank on a good Rajpal Singh cross from the left as the visitors seemed happy to draw the match. 

In the first half, Pakistan drew first blood after getting a penalty corner in the 15th minute. Imrans ground shot beat Chhetri comprehensively to give the hosts the early lead. 

The teams now move to Faisalabad for the next match on Friday.

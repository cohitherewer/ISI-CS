 Snedden to wear new hat

Wellington: The chief executive of New Zealand Cricket is switching sports to head the company that will run the 2011 Rugby World Cup, its chairman said on Tuesday. 

Former Test player and lawyer Martin Snedden will head Rugby New Zealand 2011 Ltd, said Jock Hobbs, the chairman of New Zealand Rugby Union and of the tournament company. 

Martin brings all of the right qualities to this role, Hobbs said. As a New Zealander he also shares our passion to make rugby World Cup 2011 the best ever tournament and a showcase for New Zealand on the world stage. 

Snedden, who will take up the job in May next year, said he was looking forward to the challenge. He added he was sad to be leaving cricket after a long association as a player, board member and chief executive. (AFP)

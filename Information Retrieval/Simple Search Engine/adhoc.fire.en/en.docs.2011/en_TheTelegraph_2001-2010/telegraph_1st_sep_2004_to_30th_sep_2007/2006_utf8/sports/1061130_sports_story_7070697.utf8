 Indian eves virtually in quarter finals

Doha: Indias women paddlers had a mixed day in the team event of the 15th Asian Games but their victory against Uzbekistan has virtually assured them a berth in the quarter finals. 

The Indians trounced the Uzbeks 3-0 in their group A league match but received a similar thrashing against North Korea in the second match. 

Mi Yong-kim gave the Koreans the lead when she prevailed over Mouma Das 11-2, 11-5, 11-9 while Won Ok-ryom consolidated the position by demolishing Poulami Ghatak 11-2, 11-7, 11-7 in another lop-sided contest. Shamini Kumaresan went down quite tamely too. 

Earlier, against Uzbeks Poulami lost the first game to Aliye Ismailova 7-11 but bounced back brilliantly to wrap the next three games 11-6, 13-11, 11-6. 

Mouma beat Ekaterina Levina 11-4, 12-14, 17-15. Shamini routed Madina Ayubova 11-6, 11-6, 11-2 to give India a rousing 3-0 triumph. 

The Indian men went down 1-3 to Japan. (PTI)

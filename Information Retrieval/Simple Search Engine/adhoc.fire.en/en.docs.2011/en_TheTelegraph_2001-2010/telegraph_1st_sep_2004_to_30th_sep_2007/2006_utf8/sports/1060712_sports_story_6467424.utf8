London: Rahul Dravid has thrown his weight behind Twenty20 cricket, saying there was space for the instant version of the game in domestic cricket. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has constantly opposed the latest version of the game, which was introduced among the first-class teams in England two years ago. 

But Dravid believes the latest concept was welcome provided it was played without diluting the conventional 50-overs limited-overs game. For an event like this to play for the victims of the earthquake was fantastic. But weve got to be careful? Twenty20 doesnt dilute 50-over cricket, Dravid said. 

We dont have a domestic competition and I think it (Twenty20) has a place in domestic cricket, he added. The Indian captain played a Twenty20, which was reduced to 10-overs a side due to inclement weather, alongside international stars including teammates Sachin Tendulkar and Mahendra Singh Dhoni and West Indian genius Brian Lara for charity at The Oval on Monday. 

The International XI lost to touring Pakistan. 

Meanwhile, Inzamam-ul Haq says he contemplated retirement after being dropped from the national side soon after the 2003 World Cup. 

Inzamam said his career was in a shambles around the time of last World Cup in South Africa as he struggled to make runs, and compounding his poor form was a lack of fitness.But a strict fitness regimen and diet programme brought about the turnaround, he said. 

Just before the World Cup I worked harder than I ever did. I lost a lot of weight, 17 kg. Can you believe it, Inzamam was quoted as saying in a daily. 

And thats when I got dropped from the Test team. It hurt me so much that I [was] not willing to play again. But three months after, I realized that I was only 33 and have many years (of cricket) ahead of me. So I decided to come back. 

Inzamam is infamous for his slow movements on the field and frequent run outs. His fat figure has earned him the nickname of aloo. Those jokes hurt me ... It is not easy when people laugh at you. I dont mind positive criticism, but when it is negative and personal, it is quite hard, he said. 

Inzamam credited coach Bob Woolmer with the improved fitness of the Pakistani team. 

Bob has come from outside, but he is very good for us, he said. 

He understands us and so he does not try to change us in one day. He also makes us think about our diet even though we all love Pakistani food ? especially the curries. We now know that during a series we cannot eat any curry. We have to go for pasta and light food... 

Inzamam said he also has come to terms with leading the team of a country where cricket is more than a sport. It is difficult because we have 150 million critics in Pakistan and whenever we play a series there are may be five TV channels that cover the cricket. (PTI)

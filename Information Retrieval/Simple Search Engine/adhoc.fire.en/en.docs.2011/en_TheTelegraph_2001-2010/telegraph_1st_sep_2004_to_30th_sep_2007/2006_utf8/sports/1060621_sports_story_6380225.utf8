 Arena: Ghana turnaround miraculous

Hamburg: US coach Bruce Arena said Ghanas change of fortune was miraculous and expected Thursdays pivotal World Cup group E final game against the West Africans to be a huge challenge. 

As well as we turned our team around from game one to game two, Ghana has been miraculous, Arena said. 

The US were rocked by the Czech Republic 0-3 in their opening fixture and Italy made short work of Ghana, 2-0. In their second games, the US gained a 1-1 draw with Italy, and Ghana beat the Czechs 2-0. 

Meanwhile, Ghana are getting to know America. At least soccer, American style. We have to watch tapes of the last United States matches, make our analysis, talk to scouts, develop our strategy, and practice it for the coming match, Ghana coach Ratomir Dujkovic said.

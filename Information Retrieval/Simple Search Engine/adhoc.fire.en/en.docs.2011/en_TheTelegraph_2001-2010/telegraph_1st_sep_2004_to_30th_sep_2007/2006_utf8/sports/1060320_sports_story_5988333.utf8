 Smith fined

Cape Town: South African captain Graeme Smith has been fined 30 per cent of his match fee for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the first Test against Australia which concluded here on Saturday. Smith was found guilty of showing dissent at the umpires decision by ICC Match Referee Chris Broad in a hearing after the end of play. 

The ICC in a statement on Sunday said that Smith had breached the code, which relates to showing serious dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse after he was given out leg before in the second innings. 

As captain of his side Smith needs to lead by example, said Broad. His actions on his dismissal were not acceptable. He is aware of this and has apologised for his actions. I hope that we will not see this sort of behaviour from him again, Broad added. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan slump with draw vs George

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Either Mohun Bagan took George Telegraph for granted, or Biswajit Bhattacharya loves swimming against the tide. Its otherwise difficult to explain Fridays goalless draw in the CFL Premier Division. 

Mohun Bagan thus fell further behind in title race, having dropped 12 points in 10 ties. 

The Mohun Bagan coach anyway missing key players like Dharamjit Singh, Sanjiv Maria and Ndem Guy Herves started off with Bhaichung Bhutia on the bench. 

With Dipendu Biswas amp; Co. failing to do the needful, Biswajit pressed the panic button. Bhaichung came in for Surajit Bose (expectedly), Lolendra Singh replaced Bijay Basfore (for no rhyme or reason) and Lalkamal Bhowmick took Basudeb Mondals place. 

Bhaichung and Lalkamal brought in a sense of urgency, but still couldnt break the deadlock. Bhaichung once turned and fired from the edge of the penalty box only to hit the side-netting. 

The three early second-half substitutions meant Mohun Bagan couldnt get in any more fresh players even if there was an injury. Manas Das did get hurt and was off the field for about five minutes, but still had to carry on. 

Mohun Bagan had drawn their first leg game against George Telegraph, too.

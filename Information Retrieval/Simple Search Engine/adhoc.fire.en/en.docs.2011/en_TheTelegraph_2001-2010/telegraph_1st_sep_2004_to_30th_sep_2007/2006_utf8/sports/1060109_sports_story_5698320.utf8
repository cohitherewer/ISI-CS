The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India favourites because of experience: Inzy 

 - Pak set to opt for 3-1 attack Asif very much in the reckoning 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Lahore: Rahul Dravid hasnt paid attention 

 to Inzamam-ul Haqs labelling of India as favourites 

 for the three-Test series, but the Pakistan captain remains 

 convinced that the edge is with the visitors.

 I havent said anything 

 to create pressure (on India)... I genuinely believe theyre 

 the favourites... Acchi team hai and, then, 

 look at the experience of the seasoned players... Experience 

 badi baat hoti hai, quot; Inzamam told The 

 Telegraph after an extended nets session at the Gaddafi 

 on Sunday. 

The workout apart, Inzamam had a nearly half-hour meeting with coach Bob Woolmer and chief selector Wasim Bari. Bari and his colleagues are scheduled to pick the squad for the first Test on Monday, after the tour opener concludes at the Bagh-e-Jinnah. 

Much of the debate here is over who should open with Salman Butt. Sources have indicated that Imran Farhats century for Pakistan A notwithstanding, Shoaib Malik is still favoured. He definitely has Woolmers backing, but... 

Farhat, incidentally, isnt among the probables. However, nothing stops Bari and Co. from selecting him straightaway. 

The middle-order (Mohammed Yousuf, Inzamam, Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi) picks itself. Theres no doubt over wicketkeeper Kamran Akram either. As of now, a 3-1 attack is to be fielded ? Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami/Mohammed Asif, Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Danish Kaneria. 

The pacy Asif, who idolises Waqar Younis, played in the last ODI against England. He has one appearance at the highest level, too. 

Abdul Razzaq, who was recently hospitalised for four days, and Arshad Khan are expected to make the squad. Perhaps, Farhat will also be there. Out of the reckoning are openers Yasir Hameed (owing to typhoid) and Rifatullah, Asim Kamal and Umar Gul. 

Meanwhile, manager Raj Singh Dungarpur is in the dark about a proposal for a Twenty20 match to raise funds for the victims of last Octobers earthquake. The PCB chairman (Shaharyar Khan) may have discussed something with our president, Sharad Pawar, but nothing has been conveyed to me, he maintained. 

Captain Dravid has, of course, already declared the players are going to do whatever is officially desired.

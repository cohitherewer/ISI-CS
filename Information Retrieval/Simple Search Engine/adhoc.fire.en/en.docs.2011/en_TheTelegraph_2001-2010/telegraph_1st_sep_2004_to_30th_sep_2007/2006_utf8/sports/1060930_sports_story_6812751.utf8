 Harbhajan: No need to panic 

New Delhi: Harbhajan Singh admitted on Friday that Team India didnt play well in Malaysia, but stressed that there is no need to panic. 

We are disappointed (for our show in Kuala Lumpur) but you cant just keep thinking about it. We have a good side and weve done well in the past, Harbhajan said on the sidelines of a promotional event here. 

There is no need to panic the mood in the team is positive, he added. 

The off-spinner also denied suggestions that the star value of some players was helping them retain their place in the Indian team despite poor form. 

Talking about the upcoming Challenger Trophy, he said: Its a very important tournament before Champions Trophy. There will be competitive cricket in which one cant relax. Obviously, it will be very beneficial before Champions Trophy. (PTI)

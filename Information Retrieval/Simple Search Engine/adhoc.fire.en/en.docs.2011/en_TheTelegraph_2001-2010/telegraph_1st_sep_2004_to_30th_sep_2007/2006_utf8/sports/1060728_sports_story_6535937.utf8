Manchester: Steve Harmison took six for 19 from 13 overs on Thursday to help England rout Pakistan for 119 on the Day I of the second Test on Thursday. 

At close, England were 168 for two after 49 overs in reply to Pakistans 119. Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen were at the crease, on 65 and 38, respectively. 

The home side, in reply, reached 49 for one by tea, Marcus Trescothick caught behind for five off Mohammed Sami. Andrew Strauss was unbeaten on 29 with Alastair Cook on five at the other end. 

Pakistans total was the second lowest first-innings total in a Test at Old Trafford since the very first game at the ground in 1884, when England made 95 against Australia. 

Relishing a fast, rock-hard surface and pitching the ball up, Harmison removed both openers with just nine runs on the board to start the rot. 

But the touring side, who had tried to prepare for Harmison by using a slab of marble in the nets to try and replicate his bounce, played almost as big a role in their own demise, continuing to go for extravagant shots on a pitch offering some sideways movement. 

The last eight wickets fell in 14 overs, and for 29 runs, in a performance that bore no resemblance to Pakistans defiant batting in the drawn first Test at Lords. 

They capitulated in 38.4 overs, allowing England to begin their reply midway through the afternoon session. 

The key phase of play came in four overs either side of lunch, during which four wickets ? including those of vice-captain Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf and captain Inzamam-ul Haq ? fell for three runs. 

One minute it was 90 for two and suddenly it was 93 for six. 

Yousufs dismissal, for a silky 38, sparked the collapse after he and Younis had put on 81 for the third wicket. 

Yousuf, who made a double century of the highest quality in the opening Test, had hit six fours when he looked to glide left-arm spinner Monty Panesars fourth ball towards third man, instead feathering a catch behind to Geraint Jones. 

Three balls later, and in the final over of the session, Younis slashed wildly and inexplicably at a short ball from Harmison and was caught in the gully by Paul Collingwood after making 44. 

That made it 93 for four at lunch and Panesar struck again five balls after lunch when Faisal Iqbal (3) was caught behind, rashly attempting to cut off a ball which bounced. Panesar finished with three for 21.

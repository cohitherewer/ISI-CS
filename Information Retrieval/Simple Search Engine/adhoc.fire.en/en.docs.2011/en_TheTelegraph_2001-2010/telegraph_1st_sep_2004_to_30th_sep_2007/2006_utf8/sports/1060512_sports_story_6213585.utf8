 Raina not worrying about Test berth

 - UP batsman ready for Caribbean challenge 

 Suresh Raina 

Mumbai: Suresh Raina has prepared for the West Indies tour by practising on cement pitches and plastic balls. 

I want to play well on the quicker Caribbean tracks and have practised on cement pitches with plastic balls at the Lucknow Sports Hostel, Raina said before leaving for Mumbai to catch the West Indies-bound plane. 

The UP batsman said the Minor County experience in England as well as the tour to Zimbabwe last year will hold him in good stead during the Caribbean sojourn. 

I am playing well right now and hope my form holds good in the West Indies as well, he said. 

The left-hander, who has matured with every game, said he is more concerned about his performance in ODIs rather than gaining a place in the Test side. 

Right now, I am concentrating only on the ODIs in the West Indies? If I perform well, I know I will get a chance in Tests as well, he said. 

Raina, who was described as the Michael Bevan of the Indian team by Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq, said he loved challenges in life which showed in his cricket too. 

I love challenges and while batting, I try to finish a game for India. The England series has made me more confident, specially as my knocks came at crucial stages, he said. 

I think of one match and one ball at a time, and dont have any long-term plan. I want to enjoy my game and want to perform well everytime I take the field, Raina said. 

 RPs special exam 

Meanwhile, Rainas UP teammate Rudra Pratap Singh was given special permission to sit for BA second year examination as per his convenience by the Lucknow University authorities. The left-arm seamer wrote his paper on political science on Wednesday after appearing in economics and sociology exams earlier. 

The University had provided similar facilities to Raina and India U-19 skipper Ravikant Shukla earlier.

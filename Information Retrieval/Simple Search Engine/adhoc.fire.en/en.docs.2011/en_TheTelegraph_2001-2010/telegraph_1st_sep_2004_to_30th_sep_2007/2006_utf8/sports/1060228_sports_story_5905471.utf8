The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Athletes fate still in balance

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The fate of 17 missing athletes remained undecided on the eve of the Federation Cup athletics meet as the disciplinary committee of the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has not yet reached a conclusion. 

While top AFI officials agreed that the Fed Cup will lose much of its sheen without these athletes, the chairman of the disciplinary committee, Sushil Salwan, said he needs more time to arrive at a decision. 

The committee met and discussed the issue for a few hours, Salwan told The Telegraph. We will meet again to take stock of the situation. 

It may be recalled that AFI has called for explanations from 17 athletes, who are under suspension for either not reporting to the camp at Patiala after returning from South Africa, or for abstaining from the camp in the wake of the visit by the World Anti Doping Agency team in the first week of February. 

Without these athletes it would be difficult for AFI to announce the team for Melbourne. Among the suspended athletes are the 4x400m womens relay team and prominent names like long jumper Maha Singh, javelin thrower Jagdish Bishnoi and heptathlist J.J. Sobha. 

As it is, the Federation Cup is unlikely to throw up too many sparkling performances. Very few like Anju Bobby George and Vikas Gowda are likely to qualify for Melbourne on their own merit. 

 In 20km walk, PS Jalan and Gurmeet Singh in the mens 

 section and Deepmala Devi in womens should make it 

 as all three have better timings than the third place finishers 

 in the last Commonwealth Games. Others who have a strong 

 chance of making the team are Ghamanda Ram (800m), Sushmita 

 Sinha Roy and Soma Biswas (heptathlon).

 THE SUSPENDED 

 ATHLETES

 Men: Anil Kumar and Vishal Saxena (100m), Sreejith, 

 P.S. Bhupinder Singh, Satbir Singh and P Shankar (400m),

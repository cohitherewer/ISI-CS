New Delhi: Considered perennial strugglers in the National Football League (NFL), Air India have finally decided to hit back and build up a side that would give their rivals a run for their money from the next season. 

And if the team management is to be believed, then some of the leading footballers like Venkatesh, Mahesh Gawli, Steven Dias, Covan Lawrence, Rajat Ghosh Dastidar and Naseem Akthar are already vying to don the Air India jersey next season. 

According to Air India coach Bimal Ghosh, the Mumbai institutional side have brought a total change in their recruitment policy to attract the top players of the country to join Air India, who are currently placed seventh in the 10-team NFL. 

At present, the Air India footballers are on seasonal contracts, and are paid between Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000. 

Under the new policy, Air India will recruit footballers either as officers or as flight pursers, said Ghosh, who has been coaching Air India for more than a decade now. 

While as officers the footballers will receive a minimum salary of Rs 35,000 per month, flight pursers mostly earn between Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000 per month. This a kind of offer that will last till the age of 58 and not for the next two or three seasons. 

While Ghosh confirmed that his HR department has already received a host of applications from some of the top players in the country, he added that not more than half a dozen players would be recruited. 

Among the six, four will be top rankers, and the other two will be middle level players. Stopper back Santosh Kohli has already been recruited in the traffic department. 

One more youngster from our present team will be absorbed. The other four will be from different NFL clubs, Ghosh said.

 NZC cautious 

Christchurch: New Zealand Cricket (NZC) have reacted cautiously to their Indian counterparts request to be on standby to play the proposed tri-series in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur next month. 

India, Australia and the West Indies are to play the series tentatively from September 15 to 29 in the lead up to the Champions Trophy. 

The West Indies participation is yet to be confirmed though, with their board (WICB) discussing the proposal with the players representatives. (PTI)

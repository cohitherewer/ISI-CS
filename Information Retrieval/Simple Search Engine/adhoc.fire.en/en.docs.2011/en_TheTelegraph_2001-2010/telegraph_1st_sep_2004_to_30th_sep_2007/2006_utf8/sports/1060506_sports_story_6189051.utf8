 Aragones cuts down list to 27

Madrid: Spain coach Luis Aragones has named a 27-man provisional squad for a World Cup get-together on May 8, leaving out Vicente, Guti and Ivan de la Pena. 

Aragones has stood by captain Raul and Xavi. Raul has not been in top form for Real since returning from a knee injury in February while Xavi made his first appearance for Barca, after five months out with a knee injury, last week. 

Vicente has been struggling to recover from a long-term ankle injury and has not returned to action with his club yet. 

Guti and De la Pena have paid for inconsistent form.

Carlsbad: Tiger Woods dominated the opening round of the WGC-Accenture Match-Play Championship with a record 9 amp; 8 win over Canadian Stephen Ames on Wednesday. 

The world No. 1, who withdrew from the Nissan Open four days ago because of flu, reeled off birdies at the first six holes before sealing victory with a regulation par at the 10th hole. 

His victory margin eclipsed the previous mark of 7 amp; 6 achieved by six players, including himself when he beat Australias Stephen Leaney in the third round in 2003. 

Its been a while since I played one like that, Woods said. I hit a bunch of good golf shots today, and basically it was an extension of (practice) yesterday. 

I just wanted to continue it and actually use it in competition, and I finally did. 

Champion at La Costa Resort and Spa in 2003 and 2004, Woods was smarting after comments by Ames about the accuracy of his driving and he launched his red-hot run with a superb approach to five feet at the par-four first. 

He rolled in a 17-footer at the par-three second, reached the green in two at the par-five third and coolly sank a 12-footer on four to tighten his grip on the match. 

The 10-time major winner then struck his tee shot at the par-three fifth to within three feet of the flag before making an eight-footer at the par-four sixth to secure his six birdie. 

First blood of the day was drawn by Australias Adam Scott with a 2 amp; 1 victory over American Lucas Glover, playing in his first WGC event. 

World No. 8 Scott had been two up with seven holes remaining, but bogeyed the 14th and 15th after hitting poor wedges into both greens. 

I was really mad with myself, said the 25-year-old, a losing semi-finalist at La Costa in 2003. I gave it right back on 14 and 15. We shouldnt have even stepped on to the 17th tee. 

US Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman beat Australian Stuart Appleby 3 amp; 2 in the second match out after reeling off three birdies in the last six holes. 

World No. 4 Ernie Els, back at La Costa for the first time in three years, lost to 2004 European Ryder Cup captain Bernhard Langer by a hole in the days biggest upset, and Vijai Singh outclassed Northern Irelands Graeme McDowell 5 amp; 4. 

Davis Love III beat Australian Mark Hensby 2 amp; 1 and Briton David Howell finally edged Australian Steve Elkington in a 22-hole marathon at a sun-drenched La Costa. 

That was not the only encounter which went into extra time. 

American Scott Verplank beat Britains Lee Westwood after 26 holes to equal the longest match in the tournaments history. 

Im very happy I won, Verplank said. I got to two up with two to play and was never down in the match. I totally choked it on 17. I should have won it right there but I bogeyed the hole. (Reuters)

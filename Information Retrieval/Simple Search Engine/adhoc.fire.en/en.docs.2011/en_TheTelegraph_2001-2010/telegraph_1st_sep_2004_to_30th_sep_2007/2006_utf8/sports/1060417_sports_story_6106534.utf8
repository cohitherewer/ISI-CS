The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Beijing: Internationally acclaimed Chinese film maker Zhang Yimou will direct the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, organisers announced on Sunday. Multi-Oscar winning Hollywood director Steven Spielberg, who was also present at Sunday?s announcement in Beijing, will be part of Zhang?s team as an artistic adviser. A member of China?s ?Fifth generation? of directors, Zhang is best known in the west for his 1991 film Raise the Red Lantern and his 2004 title House of Flying Daggers, both of which were nominated for Oscars.

 Dhaka: Tajikistan lifted the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup with a 4-0 win over Sri Lanka in the final on Sunday. Striker Dzhomikhon Mukhidinov scored twice, while Khurshed Makhmudov and Numondzhon Hakimov completed the rout. Sri Lanka were awarded the fair play trophy.

 Madrid: Barcelona striker Henrik Larsson will miss Tuesday?s first leg of the Champions League semi-final against AC Milan because of a thigh injury, the Primera Liga club said on Saturday. 

 The Swedish international limped off the pitch just nine minutes into a 1-0 victory over Villarreal at the Nou Camp on Friday.

 Larsson?s replacement Santi Ezquerro followed him down the tunnel 25 minutes later after suffering bruising to his right knee and is doubtful for Tuesday?s match at the San Siro. 

 Sofia: Champions CSKA Sofia moved back to the top of the Bulgarian Premier League on Saturday after a 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Pirin 1922.

 CSKA moved above bitter-city rivals Levski, who have a game in hand, on goal difference with 51 points. Portuguese Jose Furtado put the Reds ahead after only 22 seconds when he beat Pirin keeper Luchezar Sotirov with a delightful shot.

 Glasgow: Hearts and Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon has been voted Player of the Year by the Scottish Football Writers? Association.

 The 22-year-old is the first Hearts player to win the trophy since Sandy Jardine 20 years ago. Gordon is also the first player outside Rangers and Celtic to collect the award since 1991 when Dundee United?s Maurice Malpas triumphed.

 Gordon told reporters: ?There are obviously 

 not too many goalkeepers that have won it and not too many 

 Hearts players, so on both these counts it?s a very big 

 honour for me and the club.?

 Shiv looks for encore in Bangkok

Bangkok: A recharged Shiv Kapur is gunning for a repeat victory at next weeks Volvo Masters of Asia where he hopes lessons learnt from Tiger Woods would produce another golden week of golf for him. 

The young Indian star is feeling upbeat ahead of the Asian Tours season finale after taking an unscheduled two-week break to focus on his title defence at the Thai Country Club from December 14-17. 

Ive had a hectic year with no substantial time off. There was a temptation to play on in Australia and New Zealand in the last two weeks as I was playing well. But I had to force myself to take a break and take time off to prepare for the Volvo Masters of Asia, said Kapur. 

Its an important event for me, its a big one on our tour and the first time that Im defending a professional title. I wanted to get sharper on certain aspects of my game and switch off mentally before heading to Bangkok. I didnt want to get there feeling tired. 

Kapur, who won last years title with an impressive 20-under-par 268 winning total, feels his game is peaking at the right time, very much in the same vein as last year where he posted five top-10s in the weeks leading up to his maiden Asian Tour triumph. 

In recent months, he has finished fifth in the Barclays Singapore Open, Asias richest national open, 18th in the star-studded HSBC Champions in Shanghai and 13th in the Dunlop Phoenix Open in Japan before taking a three-week sabbatical. 

Kapur is hoping to take a leaf out of world No. 1 Woods book. Im hoping to learn from Tiger who says he only plays when hes ready to win. Thats the difference between him and the other top guys. 

Ive had a full week of not touching my clubs which is the longest that Ive not played in my career. Sometimes when you keep playing, you make continual adjustments to try and make things work but it may not be the right thing to do. 

The sharpness has not been there in my short game and iron play. Over the last few weeks, Ive had a chance to really work on some parts of my game, said Kapur. 

A return to the impressive Thai Country Club is an exciting prospect for Kapur, whose career turned dramatically with last years triumph. (PTI)

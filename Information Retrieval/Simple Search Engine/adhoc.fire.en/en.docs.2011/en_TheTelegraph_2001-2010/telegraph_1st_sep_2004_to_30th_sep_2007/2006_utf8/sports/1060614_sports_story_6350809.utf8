The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC clarifies protocol after fiasco

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta: The ICC has clarified 

 the protocol regarding situations where a boundary decision 

 and a catch decision or a boundary decision and a run out 

 are components of the same incident, according to an ICC 

 release. 

 [The Telegraph had reported 

 on June 10 that the ICC was set to make changes following 

 the fiasco involving Brian Lara, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and 

 Daren Ganga in St Johns.]

 The protocol will apply as follows: 

 Where a batsman hits the ball in the air to a fielder 

 near the boundary and the on-field umpires are uncertain 

 whether a catch has been completed or a boundary scored, 

 the on-field umpires are entitled to refer the boundary 

 decision to the TV umpire in accordance with Clause 3.2.4 

 of the ICC Playing Conditions. 

 Once the boundary decision request has been referred 

 to him, the TV umpire has the responsibility to make a 

 decision solely on whether a boundary has been scored. 

 If the TV replay evidence is inconclusive, the TV umpire 

 must still make a boundary decision. His decision must 

 be made using the existing convention in cricket which 

 dictates that the status quo prevails i.e. because no 

 evidence exists of a boundary being scored, no boundary 

 is awarded. 

 This decision is conveyed back to the on-field umpires. 

 In these circumstances, as no boundary has been scored, 

 the only decision left is for the on-field umpire at the 

 bowlers end to give the batsman out ? caught. 

 The same protocol would apply to a run out decision 

 in circumstances where it is questionable whether a boundary 

 has been scored. In such circumstances, the TV umpire 

 must first make a decision on that boundary. Once this 

 decision has been made the on-field umpires can then decide 

 whether or not to refer the run out appeal to the TV umpire.

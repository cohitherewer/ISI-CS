Mohali: Bengal started their Ranji Trophy season on a perfect note when Ashok Dinda guided his team to a thrilling 14-run victory over Punjab at the PCA Stadium on Saturday. 

Dinda took five for 57 as the hosts Punjab chasing a modest target of 148 were bundled out for 133 in the second innings on Day III itself. 

Sourav Ganguly, thus, also made a winning return to Bengal as captain. 

If Dinda provided the spark in Bengals push for victory, there were other men for various occasions as well. Sourav led from the front with both bat and ball, Ranadeb Bose rose to the occasion when needed, last seasons captain Deep Dasgupta made invaluable 78 in the first innings, which remained the top-score for both teams in this low-scoring thriller. 

But in the end, it was Dindas day as he produced the gem of a bowling to shock and awe the hosts. His captain Sourav and Ranadeb also backed his efforts with two key wickets apiece. 

Having resumed at the overnight score of 112 for 4, Bengal couldnt survive the Day III morning session and were bowled out for 148 in 50 ovs, thanks to a scorching Vikram Rajvir Singh spell. While Avishek Jhunjhunwala top-scored with 46, VRV returned the second-innings figures of 14-1-53-4. 

For Punjab, L Ablash picked up three and Gagandeep Singh took two wickets. 

Dinda and Ranadeb, however, nipped the Punjab ambitions in the bud. The duo struck twice early reducing the hosts to 54 for four. Sourav, who came as the first-change bowler, bowled Reetinder Singh Sodhi for 23 to pile more agony on the hosts. 

The sole resistance for Punjab came from Gaurav Gupta who made 41 runs and fought till the end before falling to Dinda. Dindas second innings figures were 19.3-3-57-5.

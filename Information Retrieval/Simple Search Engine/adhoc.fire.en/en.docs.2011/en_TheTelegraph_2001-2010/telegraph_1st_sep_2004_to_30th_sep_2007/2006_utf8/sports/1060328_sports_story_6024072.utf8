 Third spot up for grabs 

 Dubai: A third place in the LG ICC ODI championship table is the potential prize for both India and England when they start their seven-match ODI series in New Delhi on Tuesday. 

India and England, currently in fifth and sixth places on the table, respectively, are separated by five rating points but resounding success for either line-up will see them surge up the rankings. 

A 5-2 victory for India will see them rise from their current mark of 113 rating points to 115, which would be enough for them to leapfrog both fourth-placed New Zealand (113) and Pakistan, in third with 114 points. 

That would leave Rahul Dravids side just four rating points behind second-placed South Africa, currently on 119, and they can get even closer to the Proteas if they win the series 6-1 or 7-0. 

A 6-1 success would leave them on 116 points while a clean sweep would give them 118 points, just one behind Graeme Smiths team. 

England will start the series with 108 rating points but they, too, have the chance to make major strides up the table. 

A 5-2 success will lift them to 113 points and take them past India as the home side would drop to 110, while a 6-1 series win for England will give them 116 rating points (India 108) and a 7-0 clean sweep would draw them level with South Africa. 

World champions Australia are the runaway leaders with 132 points.

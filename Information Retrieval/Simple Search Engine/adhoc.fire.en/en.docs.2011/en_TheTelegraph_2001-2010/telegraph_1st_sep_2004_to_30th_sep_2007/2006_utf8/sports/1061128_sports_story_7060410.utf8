 Shoaib lawyers demand 

Karachi: The lawyer defending banned paceman Shoaib Akhtar in his doping appeal has demanded that the first hearing conducted by a dope tribunal be declared null and void as it had taken into consideration some irrelevant facts relating to the bowlers personal life. 

The original three-man doping tribunal, that included former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam, had commented on Shoaibs lifestyle in their final report after banning the bowler for two years. 

Shoaibs lawyer Abid Hasan Manto has objected to the damaging observations made on the bowlers lifestyle. 

Encouragingly enough for Shoaib, the new three-member panel comprising former Test off-spinner Haseeb Ahsan, has agreed that such details were irrelevant but has requested more details on the dietary supplements he is said to have taken. 

Mohammed Asif, who was banned for a year, is also contesting his ban. (PTI)

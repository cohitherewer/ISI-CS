 Now, ICC set to make changes

 - Fiasco involving Dhoni in St Johns

Calcutta: Embarrassed by the fiasco involving Brian Lara, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Daren Ganga in St Johns, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is about to amend the standard Test playing conditions. 

Weve realised theres ambiguity (in Boundary Decisions under 3.2.4-a) and we intend clearing that at the earliest, a top ICC official told The Telegraph on Friday. 

He added: Reports from the Match Referee (Jeff Crowe) and the on-field umpires (Simon Taufel, Asad Rauf) have already been received and the views of all ten Elite Panel umpires will probably be taken into account before the amendment is made. 

The relevant bit, as of now, reads: The on-field umpire shall be entitled to refer to the third umpire for a decision about whether the fieldsman had any part of his person in contact with the ball when he touched or crossed the boundary line or whether a four or six had been scored. A decision is to be made immediately and cannot be changed thereafter. 

The top official indicated that the ICCs manager for Match Referees and umpires, New Zealander Doug Cowie, had spoken not just to Crowe and the on-field umpires, but Billy Doctrove as well. 

Elevated to the Elite Panel this year, the West Indian was the TV umpire in the first Test which ended in a thrilling draw. 

According to the top official, Doctrove was (going by what is currently spelt out) technically right in not giving a ruling on Dhoni, saying it was beyond his jurisdiction. 

The appeal had been for a catch by Ganga off Dave Mohammed. 

Actually, theres ambiguity over responsibility? Its not clear in the standard playing conditions as to who should be making the decision (on a catch) in a boundary-line referral? 

Its this ambiguity which led to total disaster that afternoon? Were in the process of ensuring theres no repeat? That the umpires dont leave it to the players to sort things out, he said. 

The top official pointed out that if the TV footage isnt conclusive, the benefit in boundary-line referrals usually goes to the fielder. 

What if the dispute is over a catch? 

In case of a doubt, the benefit ought to go the batsmans way. However (in internal discussions), there has been no unanimity on whether the benefit should go to batters. I cant say which way the ICC is going to go, he replied. 

The top official remarked that the West Indies captain escaped censure as his actions (for example, snatching the ball from Rauf) didnt amount to dissent. 

Lara showed his frustration, not dissent? After all, the umpires hadnt made a decision! Whats surprising is that such a situation was reached despite the presence of Taufel, adjudged the No.1 umpire in 2004 and 2005, he said. 

The Australians bid for a hattrick has taken a beating.

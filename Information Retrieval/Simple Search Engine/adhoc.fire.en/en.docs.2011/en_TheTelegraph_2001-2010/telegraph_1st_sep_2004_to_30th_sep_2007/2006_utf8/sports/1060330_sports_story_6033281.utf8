 A Ronaldinho-inspired Barcelona 

 have left the Catalonians favourites to move into the Champions 

 League semi-finals after Tuesday nights quarter final 

 first leg in the Stadium of Light. 

 However, Benficas coach, 

 Ronald Koeman, could be content with his well-organised 

 defence which managed not to concede an away goal. 

 Benficas Brazilian keeper 

 Moretto was in marvellous form for the home team, making 

 several fine saves from Ronaldinho, Henrik Larsson and Cameroon 

 international Samuel Eto. 

 Koeman, a Barcelona hero after 

 scoring an extra-time free kick against Sampdoria to win 

 the European Cup in 1992, could still complete a giant-killing 

 act against his former club. 

 Barcelona had several chances 

 in the first half, with Ronaldinho living up to his reputation. 

 The best came three minutes before the break when Ronaldinho 

 fed Eto but his turn and shot was blocked by Moretto. 

 Then came embarrassment for Moretto 

 when an attempted pass to a defender was intercepted by 

 midfielder Mark van Bommel but his shot across goal from 

 the left went wide of the target. 

 Barcelona kept up the pressure 

 after the break and hit the woodwork twice within a minute, 

 with Larsson shooting on to the right-hand post after being 

 fed by Ronaldinho. Then, from a Ronaldinho corner, Thiago 

 Motta rose to head on to the left-hand post. 

 On the hour, Ronaldinho was crowded 

 off the ball on the edge of Benficas box and then 

 Benfica had a chance through Geovanni on the counterattack 

 but his shot was blocked away. 

 Ronaldinho then shot over the 

 bar from a free-kick after Larsson was fouled just outside 

 the area. 

 Barcelona made changes with 15 

 minutes left, bringing on Frenchman Ludovic Giuly for Larsson 

 and Gabri Garcia for midfielder Deco but the away goal proved 

 elusive.

 ICC: Microbetting a major threat

 - Annual report reveals phenomenal rise over last 12 months 

 Melbourne: Match-fixing 

 may not be a threat any longer, but players are still susceptible 

 to accepting bribes for under-performing during a particular 

 phase of a match owing to a rise in microbetting, 

 the International Cricket Council (ICC) has observed. ICCs anti-corruption chief Lord Paul Condon 

 said that although it was less likely that players would 

 throw a match which required significant influence over 

 events and multiple players microbetting, or betting on 

 incidents or a particular session within a match, was rampant. 

There has been a phenomenal increase in the level of betting on cricket in both the legal and illegal markets over the last 12 months, Condon said in ICCs yet-to-be released annual report. 

The incidents covered by microbetting, including session betting, will often have little impact on the outcome of a match, he was quoted as saying in a local daily on Sunday. 

Against this backdrop, the risk of a player accepting substantial sums to under-perform during a particular phase of a match cannot be ignored. 

Following ICCs observation, Australias 25 contracted players will be subjected to a new education programme, warning of the risks of corruption. 

Condon said the ICC education programme would apply to all international players and officials. 

This lesson has been tailored to re-emphasise the threat of corruption and highlight the means by which potential corrupters will seek to influence players and match officials, he said. 

A Cricket Australia spokesman confirmed the players would have two days of education and lectures at their pre-season camp outside Brisbane this month. 

It will be one of the headings covered as part of the education process at the camp, he was quoted as saying in the daily. 

The ICC is apprehensive that the 2007 World Cup may be a target for illegal bookmakers, much as the last edition in South Africa in 2003 when it was estimated that Indian bookies took more than $1 billion in bets.

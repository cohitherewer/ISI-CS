 Second defeat for Indian eves

New Delhi: Indian eves suffered their second successive defeat against New Zealand, going down by five wickets in the second one-day International at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval on Monday. 

According to information received here, New Zealand achieved the target in 28.2 overs after restricting India to a paltry 157 for seven to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Openers Karu Jain and Jaya Sharma put on 57 runs to give a steady start to the visitors, but after Sharmas dismissal for a well-made 30, India lost wickets at regular intervals and were unable to step up the run-rate. 

Off spinner Anna Dodd bowled a tight spell, returning with economical figures of 2 for 19 from 10 overs. 

In reply, Haidee Tiffen slammed a quickfire 66. Tiffen, who also struck six fours, missed her chance to score the winning runs, stepping down the track only to be stumped by Jain off Devika Palshikar when the scores were level. 

India had lost the first match by 7 wickets.

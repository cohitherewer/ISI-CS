 Arjuna: Murali shouldnt play in Australia

Colombo: Former Sri Lankan skipper Arjuna Ranatunga on Sunday said that ace spinner Muttiah Muralidharan should stop playing in Australia because of crowd taunts over his action in the ongoing tri-series. 

If I had been the captain or manager, I would have asked Murali to pack his bags and go home and take some rest as there is a limit to everything, Ranatunga said. 

If the Australians cant respect good cricket, they dont deserve to see the best in action, said Ranatunga, a World Cup winning captain who is now a deputy minister in Sri Lanka.

Koenigstein: Brazil are already thinking beyond their below-average World Cup debut against Croatia, hoping to improve in their last two group matches and the remainder of the competition. 

The defending champions remained confident of their chances of a record sixth world title despite having to work hard to beat the Croats 1-0 on Tuesday in Berlin. 

Its everything under control, Ronaldinho told the Brazilian football confederation (CBF)s website on Wednesday. 

Considering it was a World Cup opener, when theres a lot of tension, we were certain it would be a complicated match. But we also are certain that we will improve, and a lot, in the next matches. 

Brazil got the win ? a record eighth consecutive in World Cups ? with a goal by midfielder Kaka in the 44th minute. Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira called the result exceptional, but admitted the teams performance wasnt ideal. The national team needs to improve ? and it can, Parreira told the CBF site. 

Brazilian players got the day off Wednesday before returning to practice for the teams second group F match against Australia on Sunday in Munich. It will then face Japan on June 22 in Dortmund. 

It wasnt an easy game. Were very happy with the win, but we know that we can play much better, defender Juan said after the match. Everybody knew that today would be a real challenge for us. Now its all about getting ready for Australia. 

Parreira noted that the performance of Brazils defence was crucial for the teams victory on Tuesday. 

If it werent for the stability of our defensive sector, the win certainly would have been in jeopardy, he said. Croatia knew how to attack dangerously.. Some people might be disappointed that we only won 1-0, Brazil captain Cafu said. But thats the way the game went. 

Meanwhile, Australias enthusiasm ahead of their clash with Brazil is tinged with a healthy dose of caution. 

Theres no pressure on us because everyone expects Brazil to win, but why not (be optimistic)? asked defender Lucas Neill. We believe we can get something, he added. 

Were not going to be star-struck or anything, said midfielder Jason Culina. 

However, Australia are considering fielding a weakened team to avoid the risk of losing key players to suspension for their final group game with Croatia. 

Australians arent taking much notice of Ronaldos early World Cup reviews. The Brazil striker has been criticised for being overweight and unproductive, while a bout of dizziness also prompted a visit to a hospital. But the Socceroos are still wary of the two-time World Player of the Year. 

For years now, hes been one of the most popular names in football, Neill said. Him and his buddy with the inho on the end of it (Ronaldinho). You cant give them a seconds peace. Culina also thinks Ronaldo will have something to prove Sunday. Hes always dangerous, Culina said. All the (Brazil) players on their day, they can do anything. Ronaldos no different. Were going to give him the respect he deserves, but not too much.

Karachi: Pakistan batsman Mohammed Yousuf hit a record eighth Test century in a calendar year before the West Indies fought back hard on the first day of the third and final Test. 

Yousuf smashed 15 elegant fours in his four-hour knock of 102 runs, but the West Indies claimed four wickets in the last session to restrict Pakistan to 257 for seven 7 at stumps on a low bouncy National Stadium wicket. 

Kamran Akmal was batting on 18 while Shahid Nazir was yet to score when poor light ended the days play two overs before the scheduled close. 

Fast bowler Corey Collymore trapped Yousuf leg before off a delivery that kept low as he attempted a pull shot and completely missed the line. 

The brilliant form of Yousuf this year saw the right-hander score two centuries against India in the home series before registering another three against England in summer. His prolific form continued against the West Indies when he compiled centuries in the first two Tests in Lahore and Multan. 

Yousuf drove Daren Powell to mid on for three runs to complete his 22nd Test century off 155 balls and became the first batsman in Test history to score eight centuries in a year. 

Viv Richards (West Indies) and Aravinda de Silva (Sri Lanka) jointly held the previous record when they scored seven centuries in 1976 and 1997 respectively from 11 Test matches each. 

Yousuf also closed in on Richards 30-year-old record of most Test runs in a calendar year. Richards made 1,710 runs in 11 Test matches and Yousuf needs another 47 in the second innings to break the mark. 

The rest of the Pakistan batsmen struggled to negotiate the tricky bounce of the wicket and build big partnerships with Yousuf. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq and Shoaib Malik both scored 18 runs each before they fell in the last session. Inzamam gave part-time off-spinner Daren Ganga his first Test wicket when he played a reckless shot and was caught at mid-off, while Malik fell leg-before to paceman Jerome Taylor. 

Yousuf had a reprieve on 63 just before tea when wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin failed to catch a thin edge from a Chris Gayle ball as Pakistan progressed to 174 for three. 

The West Indies bowlers could get only one wicket in the second session when Dwayne Bravo enticed Imran Farhat (47) to drive a wide delivery and edged to Ramdin. 

Earlier, Collymore bowled Mohammed Hafeez (18) in his fifth over with a good length delivery that nipped back into the right-handed opener to leave Pakistan at 26 for one.

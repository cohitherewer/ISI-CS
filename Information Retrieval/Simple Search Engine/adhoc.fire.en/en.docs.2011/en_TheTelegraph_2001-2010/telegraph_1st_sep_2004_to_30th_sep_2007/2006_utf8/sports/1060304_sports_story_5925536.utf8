The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont rock the boat, Bhaichung

 FREE-KICK

 P. K. Banerjee

It was a depressing fortnight for Indian football. Losing by a big margin to the much superior Japanese on their turf can still be explained, but we had no business surrendering to Yemen. That too at home.

 We did well to keep Japan in check for an hour or so in Yokohama. But the pace at which Zicos team was operating was just too much for our boys to handle for 90 minutes. The pitch was generously watered, making it a lightning fast surface. Even the Japanese had problems controlling the ball in the first half. Once they got a hang of it, they just overran our inexperienced defence.

 The Yemen team was no great shakes, but the fare we dished out against them was one of the most pathetic displays ever by an Indian team. Yes, we were missing three key players in defence and midfield, but even then we shouldnt have gone down by three goals.

 I dont want to sound as if I am reeling off excuses, but the fact remains that there were a couple of factors ? beyond the team managements control ? which affected us badly. Injuries to several players who played key roles in our SAFF Cup triumph in Pakistan meant we had a number of inexperienced boys for these two games. And then, our preparation was anything but the best.

 I can understand the widespread despondency over the Indian teams performance in the two Asian Cup qualifying games. There have been calls for the head of coach Nayeem. I would only appeal to the critics and fans to show some patience. The federation as well as the coach have some plans, keeping the Doha Asian Games in mind. So please dont press the panic button and give them some time.

 I have a piece of advice for the players as well. Some of them have been critical of the coach over the last few days, with captain Bhaichung Bhutia being the most vocal of the lot. If they think whatever the team management is doing is all wrong, they should either turn coaches or stop playing in the national team.

 I treat Bhaichung like my son, so when I see hes doing something wrong, I will have to point it out to him. He must realise that the coach has to be respected, even if you dont like some of his ideas. Discipline has to be maintained at all cost and, being the captain, he has an even bigger responsibility. This is not the time to rock the boat, Bhaichung.

 As I have said before, Nayeems dedication and commitment to the job cannot be questioned. How else do you explain the coach giving massages to Bhaichung and other players till 2-3 am? I have seen this not once but several times.

 Some of Nayeems methods can be modified, all the more because he is fully conversant with modern coaching techniques. The players think some of his theories are archaic, not suitable in this age and time. But that doesnt mean they will go to the media and criticise the coach.

 If I am to point out one lesson learnt from this twin debacle, it would be to take a fresh look at the players yearly schedule. 

 I remember a panel of ex-footballers (including yours truly) recommending to the AIFF just before the inaugural National League 10 years ago that our players appearances for club, office and state should be restricted to 45 matches per year so that they have the energy to play about 10-15 games for the national team. 

 Unfortunately, that has never been followed and, consequently, an East Bengal or a Mohun Bagan footballer ends up playing 60 matches minus the India assignments.

 Unless the AIFF gets strict about the number of matches a footballer can play in a year, we are not going to get fit enough players all the time. The clubs will suffer, so will the country.

 The way forward

 Players have no right to criticise coach, discipline 

 is of utmost importance

 Don't press the panic button, give the team management 

 some time

 Matches a footballer can play per year must be fixed. 

 That should be strictly followed

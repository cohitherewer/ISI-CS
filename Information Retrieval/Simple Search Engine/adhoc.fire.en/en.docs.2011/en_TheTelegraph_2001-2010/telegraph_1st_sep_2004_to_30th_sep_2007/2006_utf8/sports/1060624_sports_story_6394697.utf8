 Kakas Milan deal extended

Rome: Brazilian midfielder Kaka has extended his contract with AC Milan until 2011. 

Kaka and Milan are both celebrating after the midfielder extended his contract with the Rossoneri until 2011, the club, owned by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, said in a statement on their website. 

Kaka, 24, joined Milan from Sao Paolo in 2003. (Kaka) has been one of the leading lights in the competition so far, scoring against Croatia and hitting the bar in the match against Australia, the club said. 

He can now look forward to plenty more successful seasons in a Milan shirt.

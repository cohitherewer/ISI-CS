 Italians advice for Thuram

Rome: Marco Materazzi has said Lilian Thuram should not make excuses for Zinedine Zidanes head-butt after the French defender described the Italian as an illness that should not exist. 

France captain Zidane was sent off towards the end of extra-time in the World Cup final in Berlin on July 9, when Italy won on penalties. 

Materazzi told a news agency: Thuram would have done better to point out that it was not the first time that Zidane has made certain errors, rather than make excuses for him at any price, presumably referring to the 12 red cards Zidane has received during his career. 

Thuram had told a weekly, a player like Materazzi is an illness which should not exist. 

Materazzi has given a negative image of football and he does not need this type of attitude because he is really a very good player. Football is a game where the rules need to be observed. Whats the point of winning if you have cheated? It means nothing. 

Thuram did also say that Zidanes head-butt into the chest of Materazzi was unfortunate. 

Materazzi, known for his rugged play, added: In the past, I have also been the first to make errors and theres no point defending someone just for the principle. 

Zidane has since explained the incident by saying Materazzi insulted his mother and sister. The Italian, however, denied he insulted Zidanes mother. 

The disciplinary commission of Fifa has opened an inquiry into the incident. The French captain will be heard on Thursday in Zurich.

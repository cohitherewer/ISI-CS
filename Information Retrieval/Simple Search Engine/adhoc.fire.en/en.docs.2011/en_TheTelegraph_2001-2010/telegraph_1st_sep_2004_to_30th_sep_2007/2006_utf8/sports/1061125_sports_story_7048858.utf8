 Kirsten faults technique

Cape Town: Gary Kirsten has identified technical flaws in Indian batsmen and advised them to work on their defensive tactics if they were to succeed in the rest of their tour. 

The former opening batsman said the Indians tended to play away from their body on faster pitches rather than showing the courage to get behind the rising deliveries. 

Most of them dont get behind the line of the ball. One of the things which successful batsmen do on such surfaces is to get behind the line rather than play away from the body. You can get away with such a faulty technique in India where the edges fall short of slip cordon, but here Indians must learn to get behind the line of the ball. 

Kirsten also said the Indian batsmen would have to come on the front foot more often than they have been doing on this tour. 

I watched them on Wednesday and most of them seemed to play from inside the crease. It simply wont do on such surfaces. You need to be on the lookout to come on to the front foot. The more you stay on the backfoot and inside the crease, the lesser are your options of scoring. 

Kirsten, though, sees a silver lining for India in the way he perceives the tour would pan out from now onwards. The rest of the pitches wouldnt be quite as difficult as it was in Kingsmead So in that respect they would have far easier batting conditions.

 Jaffer available for selection

Mumbai: While Sachin Tendulkar ruled himself out of the Test series in the West Indies on Tuesday, opener Wasim Jaffer, who underwent a fitness test following a shin surgery, was declared fit and available for selection. The squad will be picked here Wednesday. 

Andrew Leipus, who supervised Sachins rehabilitation since Team India physio John Gloster is currently in the West Indies, said the damage was important to prevent damage to Sachins shoulder. 

We dont want to do any further damage to his shoulder. We are looking at the bigger picture in order to prolong his career. (Agencies)

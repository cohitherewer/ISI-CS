 Cannavaros recipe for success...

 Duisburg: Italy 

 captain Fabio Cannavaro has put his excellent World Cup 

 form down to a good diet, plenty of sleep and a healthy 

 sex life. 

For an athlete its as important how you behave off the pitch as you do on it, Cannavaro said at Tuesday press conference. Eating well, getting plenty of sleep and having sex ? all of these things are important. 

Your body needs the right fuel to keep going. I dont smoke and I dont drink alcohol, Ive never liked it. I live a normal, healthy life. Ive been disciplined for many years and that has served me well.

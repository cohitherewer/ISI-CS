 2-0 win for Warriors 

Chandigarh: An attacking Shivendra Singh helped Maratha Warriors register their second consecutive win by beating Sher-E-Jalandhar 2-0 in a Tier I match of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) at the Sector 42 Hockey Stadium here on Saturday. 

The Warriors, who earned three points from Saturdays win to top the table with six points, were charged up right from the beginning. The first quarter was a high-voltage one with both teams trying desperately to achieve the first breakthrough. For the Warriors, L. de Bruijn (of the Netherlands) got a chance early on, but could not position himself well for a precise hit. 

Shivendra made an excellent move from the right flank in the 22nd minute to feed 20-year-old Pakistani Adnan Zakir. 

The player from Karachi positioned himself well to hit the ball past goalkeeper Maninder Singh. 

In the fourth quarter, Shivendra struck a spectacular shot to take his team to victory. However, the Warriors failed to score from the two penalty corners which came their way. 

Sher-E-Jalandhar could not utilise any of the five penalty corners they earned. One of their sure shot chances to score off a penalty corner was brilliantly foiled by Warriors skipper Viren Rasquinha. 

Their woes increased after Pak recruit Mohammed Saqlain was shown the red card by umpire Satendra Sharma when he threw his stick expressing dissent over a decision. (PTI)

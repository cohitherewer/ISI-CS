Paris: The outcome of what promises to be a classic Champions League final between Arsenal and Barcelona is likely to be decided in one key area at the Stade de France on Wednesday. 

Barcelona, with their formidable strike force of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto, come up against an Arsenal defence which has not been breached in 10 European matches. 

Arsenals back line has been outstanding in Europe, largely thanks to the brilliance of keeper Jens Lehmann. 

Manager Arsene Wenger is likely to re-format his defence because Philippe Senderos is battling for fitness while Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole have returned from injury. Cole will take Matthieu Flaminis place at left back while Campbell will retain his place at the expense of Senderos in central defence. 

Although Campbell is still regarded as the more senior player to Senderos, the young shaven-headed Swiss man-mountain has looked far better than the ageing England centre-back when he has played this season. 

Arsenal will be unwise to pack their midfield as they do occasionally against teams they perceive can threaten them. They will also need to play far better than they did against Villarreal in the second leg of the semi-final in Spain. 

In effect, Arsenal have to be at their absolute best for 90 minutes or else Barcelona could profit with a counter-attacking game even faster than their English rivals. 

Barcelona were also too good for Chelsea, beating the English champions 3-2 on aggregate in the second round, and Chelsea have been a far better team than Arsenal this season. 

But the match is finely balanced. Arsenals own world class maestro, Thierry Henry, could hand The Gunners the European Cup for the first time in their history. 

Henry is second only to Ronaldinho as the best player in the world today and, like the Brazilian, is capable of scoring brilliant goals. 

Henry could well prove to be Arsenals match winner, but Frank Rijkaards defence is superbly organised and Henry will need plenty of support from his teammates. 

Man for man, Barcelona look better equipped and more experienced ? but this very fact makes Arsenal dangerous. For once there is no pressure on them. 

Arsenal rarely go into any match as underdogs, but they will on Wednesday and this could allow them to play their exciting free-flowing game and batter Barcelona into submission. 

Barcelona received a boost to their preparations on Monday when Argentina forward Lionel Messi was included in their squad. The 18-year-old trained with the team on Monday but has not been given all-clear by club medical staff after two months on the sidelines. 

Messi tore a thigh muscle during the second leg of his sides Champions League knockout tie against Chelsea on March 7.

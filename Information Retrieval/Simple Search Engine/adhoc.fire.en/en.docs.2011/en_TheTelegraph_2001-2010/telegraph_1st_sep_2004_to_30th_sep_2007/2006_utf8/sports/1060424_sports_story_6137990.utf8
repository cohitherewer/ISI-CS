 Whoevers coach, itll be 

 a gamble

 - Its bizarre that FA did not even seek to interview 

 Wenger

It is beginning to look as though 

 Steve McClaren has won the race to become England manager, 

 though it is hardly inspiring to hear that he is the favourite 

 only because he is the candidate no one particularly opposes. 

 To be fair to him, he is the one English manager with experience 

 of international football and if he gets the job, he might 

 turn out to be very good at it. 

But if he has pipped rivals Alan Curbishley and Sam Allardyce at the post, one has to suspect that the Football Association selection panel has been operating on a flavour of the month basis. The FA said they would not be swayed by weekly Premiership results when choosing Sven-Goran Erikssons successor and if McClaren is appointed, they will deny that it has anything to do with his efforts at Middlesbrough. Yet in my mind, there is no question that if he gets the job, it will be because he has turned round Boros season in the past few weeks. 

No one was even talking about him when his team were thrashed 0-7 by Arsenal in January. Then it was all Allardyce and Curbishley, who have ceased to be favourites since their clubs started to go into reverse gear. McClaren, however, now looks as though he might win a couple of trophies and therefore will probably be seen as the safe option. 

If England have a disastrous World Cup, McClaren would hardly start with a ringing endorsement, though if we do well, the FA would be kicking themselves if they had not promoted him. 

What is depressing is the way the FA have gone about it. You really cant pick an England manager by committee. You know what they say a camel is a horse built by a committee and you wonder what qualifies the people sitting on the selection panel to make the choice. Brian Barwick, the FA chief executive, was supposed to be the key man in shaping the decision but he clearly hasnt got the power to force through his choice. 

Yet in the FA, youve got a man like Trevor Brooking, who has been in football all his life and understands the people in football better than anyone. Why couldnt the FA have told him to get on with finding a manager, possibly under Barwicks supervision? 

Could that man really be Big Phil Scolari? Do me a favour. He has absolutely no experience of English football and if it took Eriksson a long time to adjust to the game here after his time in Italy, how much harder would it be for someone even further removed? OK, he did well with Brazil but then a goldfish could probably run up a good record as Brazils manager. 

If the FA wanted a foreign manager, there should have been only one man they wanted to interview ? Arsene Wenger. He understands the game here, would have dealt with all the off-pitch stuff brilliantly and been respected by all the players. He probably would have had too much sense to take the job, yet I still think it bizarre that the FA did not even seek to interview him. 

 I can understand, however, the reasoning behind wanting someone with an English passport because we are a big international nation and you could not imagine Germany or Brazil appointing a foreigner to run their national team, even if the Germans played a cruel trick on the Scots by allowing Berti Vogts to manage them. The problem is that the English candidates are all much of a muchness. 

None of them has had the sort of success that Sir Alex Ferguson, Wenger and now Jose Mourinho are having at Chelsea. Allardyce, McClaren and Curbishley are not at clubs where they could hope to win the Premiership and challenge for Champions League titles but, if an Englishman is wanted, it will have to come from one of those three. 

As much as the FA deserve criticism for dillying and dallying, I can understand how awkward it has been for them. Ideally, they would have waited until after the World Cup but had they done so, the new man would have had almost no time to prepare for the Euro 2008 qualifiers, which begin right at the start of next season. 

Whoever gets the job, one thing is certain. It will be a gamble. Perhaps not of Wayne Rooney proportions, but a gamble all the same.

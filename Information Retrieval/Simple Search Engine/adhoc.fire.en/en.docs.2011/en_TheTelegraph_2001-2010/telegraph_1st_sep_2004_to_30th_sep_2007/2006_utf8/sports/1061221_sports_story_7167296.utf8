 Pawar to file nomination

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar has found support from the other three Asian Test playing countries to succeed South Africas Percy Sonn as the chief of the International Cricket Council. 

Yes, it has been decided that Mr Pawar will be the candidate to take over as the new ICC president once Percy Sonns two-year term is over. Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are in favour of Mr Pawar and we hope to elicit the support of the West Indies too, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said from Rajkot. 

We have to move fast as the nomination needs to be sent to the ICC by January 1, 2007 and AC Muthiah (former BCCI chief) is the head of the ICCs nomination committee, informed Shah, adding the issue would be discussed at the Boards working committee meeting here on Saturday. 

Voting on the nominations will take place at the ICCs annual meeting in London in July, 2007. 

The move to nominate the Union agriculture minister to the top administrative post of the ICC was taken when he hosted a dinner for the representatives of the four World Cup co-hosts at his residence in Delhi on December 11 to finalise plans for the mega event. 

According to sources, the support from ICCs associate members would also be crucial for Pawar. (PTI)

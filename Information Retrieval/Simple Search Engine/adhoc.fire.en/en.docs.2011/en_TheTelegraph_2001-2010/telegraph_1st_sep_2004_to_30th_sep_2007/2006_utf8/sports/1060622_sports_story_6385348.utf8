 Fifa honours Das Munshi again

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: India may be placed 117th in the Fifa rankings, but the All India Football Federation (AIFF) president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has already set a kind of record in the ongoing World Cup. 

On Wednesday, the AIFF president was selected the match commissioner for the second time in the World Cup when he was asked to take charge of the crucial Group F match between Croatia and Australia in Stuttgart. On Monday, Das Munshi had made his debut as a match commissioner in the Spain-Tunisia encounter. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Stuttgart, an elated Das Munshi said: While I was thrilled on the first occasion, this second assignment came as a surprise to me. Generally, such important posts are only given to Fifa executive committee members. Perhaps, Fifa was impressed by my performance in the first match. 

In the Spain-Tunisia match, the AIFF president said, he had to face a storm, literally. A day before the match, the local meteorological department predicted a high velocity storm during the course of the encounter. There was a chance of the match getting washed away midway through, but the storm changed course at the last moment and went towards Nuremberg. 

To conduct a World Cup tie as a match commissioner is always a big headache, Das Munshi said. 

Calling it a lifetime experience, Das Munshi said he was amazed to see how the Spanish fans were rooting for Raul at the start of the match.

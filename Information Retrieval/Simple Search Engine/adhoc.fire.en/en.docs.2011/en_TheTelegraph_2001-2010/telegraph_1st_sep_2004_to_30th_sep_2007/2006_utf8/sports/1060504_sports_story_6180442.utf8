Bangalore: Australian speedster Brett Lee on Wednesday praised Team Indian coach Greg Chappell, saying his experimentation with a mix of young and experienced players is fetching good results. 

Chappell revamped the batting order, got some fresh young quicks and retained experienced players, Lee said. 

You need experience too, and India has got its correct mix. I think they (India) will be a big presence in the World Cup. We look forward to tackling them at the Champions Trophy, he said. 

On criticism in some quarters against batting ace Sachin Tendulkars performance in recent matches, he said that one cannot write off Sachin on the basis of recent perfromances. 

To average consistently over 50 in Tests is a tremendous achievement and I am sure once Sachin recovers, he will score more centuries. I hope it wont be against us. He has raised the bar so much that people expect him to slam centuries all the time, Lee added.

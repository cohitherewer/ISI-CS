 Eriksson makes Real shortlist

Real Madrid president Fernando Martin has said that England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is one of seven men targeted to become the clubs new coach. 

In an interview with Spanish television station Antena 3, Martin also said that the Spanish giants were interested in Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho, Liverpools Rafael Benitez and Arsenals Arsene Wenger. 

Italian trio Carlo Ancelotti, Fabio Capello and Marcello Lippi complete the shortlist. 

It is going to come from one of seven coaches, Martin said. We are clear about what type of coach we want and we want one of the ones that you all know. 

I am not going to say them in order of preference, but they are Mourinho, Capello, Benitez, Wenger, Ancelotti, Lippi and Eriksson. Reals current coach, Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, has been given a contract to the summer and Eriksson finishes as England coach after the World Cup. 

But Martin was unwilling to give anything more away about Reals potential new coach. No other thing can be said because I believe I have to be prudent, he said. 

What I can say is that we have to try to build a team possible of the best for next year and a basic element of a better team is the coach. Real failed to make the quarter finals of this seasons Champions League after being knocked out by Arsenal and trail Barcelona by 11 points in the Primera Liga, although they face the league leaders this weekend.

 PSG fan dies from gunshot wound

Paris: The race to reach the last 32 of Uefa Cup was overshadowed by the death of a French fan who died from gunshot wound after a clash with police on Thursday. 

The tragedy happened outside the Parc Des Princes Stadium following Paris Saint Germains 2-4 defeat to Hapoel Tel-Aviv of Israel. 

Police sources said that a police officer had gone to the aid of a Hapoel fan who had been set upon by a gang of around 150 PSG supporters outside the ground. 

The officer fired tear gas to disperse the mob before firing two shots. Two PSG fans were hit. One died at the scene while the extent of the others wound was not known. 

The death put the nights action into sombre perspective after all four British teams Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers and Rangers had made the knockout round.

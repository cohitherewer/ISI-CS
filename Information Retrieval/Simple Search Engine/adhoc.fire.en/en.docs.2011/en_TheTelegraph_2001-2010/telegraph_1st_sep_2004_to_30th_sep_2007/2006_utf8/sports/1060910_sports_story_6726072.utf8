The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Necessary to build on this win, says Strauss

 Andrew Strauss sweeps en route to his 78 on Friday 

Nottingham: England captain Andrew Strauss told his players not to drop their level after a rare ODI victory which gave them a chance of squaring the series against Pakistan. 

An eight-wicket win under the Trent Bridge floodlights left England 1-2 down heading into Sundays finale at Edgbaston. It was their first success in any form of limited overs cricket against a major nation this home season and their fifth limited overs success in 25 matches, a worrying record ahead of next years World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Weve worked very hard to get this first win and now its really necessary we build on it, said England captain Andrew Strauss. 

Weve got to do the things we did well again at Edgbaston. I certainly dont think anyone will be taking their foot off the accelerator, Strauss added. 

With the exception of our last few overs, it was excellent. We put them under pressure and were able to take wickets in the middle which is very important in one-day cricket. And then a clinical performance at the end there, keeping up with the rate and not losing early wickets. When you win it all seems quite simple. 

The captain himself made 78 at the top of the order. Ian Bell (86 not out) and Kevin Pietersen (41 not out) guided the home team home with an unbeaten 89-run stand. 

Strauss said it was vital for the teams future success that they didnt just rely in their established stars. 

Tres (Marcus Tresiscothick) a very important one-day player for England but, as weve found with all the injuries weve had over the last 12 months, you cant rely on one or two players, said Strauss. 

Youve got to be able to get performances from all round the team. Hopefully we can do that in India and hopefully, this win will give us a bit of momentum. 

Yardy, who took a miserly three for 24 from 10 overs a haul which included Mohammed Yousuf, Shoaib Malik and Kamran Akmal was understandably pleased. 

Im loving it, said Yardy who also played in Englands five-wicket Twenty20 defeat against Pakistan in Bristol last month. 

The Sussex stars haul was all the more impressive as he had only been bowling spin for under two years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Resignation not being accepted

 - Arjuna Ranatunga stays away from tourism ministry despite... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Arjuna Ranatungas 

 resignation as Sri Lankas deputy minister for tourism 

 hasnt been accepted, but the island-nations 

 solitary World Cup-winning captain isnt attending 

 office.

 I havent gone to work 

 after putting in my papers before the President (Mahinda 

 Rajapakse) more than a fortnight ago That it hasnt 

 yet been accepted makes no difference I dont see 

 myself as a minister any more, Ranatunga told The 

 Telegraph. 

 He quit after being made the target of a whisper campaign, 

 which projected him as greedy for multiple posts in the 

 government and outside. 

Speaking from Colombo on Saturday, Ranatunga added: In fact, we (the former cricketers) are extremely unhappy that despite a directive from the President, sports minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga hasnt reconstituted Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) 

That order was issued over three weeks ago, when Rajapakse intervened and scrapped elections to the body following an acrimonious build-up. 

Infighting, sadly, has been a feature of SLC for years. 

As part of a compromise formula, suggested by Rajapakse himself, the two candidates for the presidents post incumbent Jayanta Dharmadasa and challenger Mohan de Silva were to work together as co-chairmen and the new SLC would have five former cricketers on its all-important committee for administration. 

The sports minister, however, has retained Dharmadasa and his team. 

I cant understand why the Presidents directive hasnt been implemented Its obvious that some dont want former cricketers, particularly myself, to get involved in administration After all, our style will be different and we wont have an agenda outside the game, Ranatunga remarked. 

The former cricketers had nominated Sidath Wettimuny, Aravinda de Silva, Kapila Wijegunawardene, Pramodaya Wickramasinghe and Ranatunga to serve on SLC once it got reconstituted. 

It has turned out to be a futile exercise. 

Now, of course, weve decided not to approach anybody for anything Let SLC be run the way the sports minister wants it. If something goes wrong, though, he has to be held responsible Even the President Thats it, Ranatunga maintained. 

 Very strong words, but then Ranatunga hasnt 

 ever been too concerned about niceties. Hes just not 

 the type to mellow down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Musharraf may watch ODI No.3 too

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: On Friday, President Pervez Musharraf played the perfect host at his official residence in Rawalpindi. Then, the next day, spent more than an hour watching ODI No.2 there. Come Monday and he may just turn up at the Gaddafi, too. 

For reasons of security, the Presidents programs are almost always tentative. However, weve been given to understand that he intends being present ? for sometime, at least ? during the third ODI, a top Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) source told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Lahore late on Sunday, the source added: Well, of course, be ready to host the President from the first ball (to be bowled at 11.30 am IST)? If he doesnt come then, well, theres bound to be a next time? 

President Musharraf, who is also chief patron of the PCB, had watched parts of the Rawalpindi ODI and the decisive second one at the Gaddafi on Team Indias last tour two years ago. 

Pakistan had then won in Rawalpindi, but lost in Lahore. This time, the visitors excelled in the Presidents backyard and should be high on confidence at the Gaddafi ? the uncertainty over Virender Sehwag notwithstanding.

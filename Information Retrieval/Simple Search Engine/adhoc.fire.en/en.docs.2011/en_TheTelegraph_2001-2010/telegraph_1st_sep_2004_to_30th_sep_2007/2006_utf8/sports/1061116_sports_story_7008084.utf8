The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Davids trio set to rule 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: All eyes, on Thursday, are going to be on trainer Daniel Davids three runners Right Again, Moon Forest and Best Of The Blues. Right Again and Moon Forest are migrants from Bangalore where they have performed creditably during the summer season. Best Of The Blues, on the other hand, is citys champion sprinter and is poised to score a hattrick of wins.

 However, it may not be a cakewalk for Best Of The Blues in the 1,200m R.W.I.T.C. Cup, since horses in top Class will be in fray. Though the Warrshan-Briar Creek son gave jockey, Imran Chisty, an armchair ride in his previous start, he is taking on a much stiffer bunch on this occasion. Yet, with the Blues being the youngest horse in the 12-horse field, Chisty is expected to cash in on the three-year-olds rousing form.

 Right Again and Moon Forest are, however, up against poor oppositions in their respective events the 2,000m Adelina Handicap and the Bol Publication Cup over 1,600 metres.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

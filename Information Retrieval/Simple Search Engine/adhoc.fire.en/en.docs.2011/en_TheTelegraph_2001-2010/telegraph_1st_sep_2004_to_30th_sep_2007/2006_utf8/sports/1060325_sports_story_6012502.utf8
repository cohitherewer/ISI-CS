 Botham Flintoffs No.1 fan

 - Im probably enjoying his success more than he is 

 Flintoff 

London: Ian Botham says it is time English cricket stopped talked about finding the new Beefy and started concentrating on discovering another Andrew Flintoff. 

For over a decade, every promising English allrounder has been compared to Botham, whose single-handed destruction of Australia during the home Ashes tour of 1981 has gone down in the annals of the game. 

But Flintoff has established himself as the worlds top allrounder after helping beat Australia to reclaim the Ashes in 2005 and then finishing Man of the Series in the 1-1 draw in India this month. 

For years, every allrounder England picked was burdened with the task of becoming the next Ian Botham, Botham wrote in his column for a British tabloid on Friday. But the Beefy show is now defunct: England can now start looking for the new Andrew Flintoff. 

Weve had to wait a while for Freddie to fulfil his potential but hes getting better all the time. Im his No. 1 fan and Im probably enjoying his success more than he is. 

Flintoff was hastily made captain for the Indian tour this month after Michael Vaughan was forced out through injury. 

After losing the second match, Flintoff led from the front with bat and ball to help England square the series with a 212-run win in Mumbai on Wednesday. 

Flintoff was rightly named Player of the Series in India for his dynamic leadership, selfless bowling and consistency with the bat after being thrown in the deep end as caretaker captain, wrote Botham. 

His stock is higher than ever and he was exemplary in every respect. Even if Michael Vaughan is not fit by the start of the home series against Sri Lanka in May, England have a ready-made replacement. (PTI)

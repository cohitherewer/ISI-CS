The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Two officials suspended 

 - Race to control UPCA

Lucknow: The tussle among the politicians to capture the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) had its fallout with joint director in the state sports directorate Vijay Singh and the regional sports officer of Green Park Stadium, Kanpur, Brijendra Kureel, being suspended, sources said on Tuesday. 

The action comes a day after the National One-Day final between Uttar Pradesh and Railways ? which was to be held here on Tuesday ? was rescheduled to be held on April 2 in Mumbai. 

Sources attributed the venue change to bickering among politicians belonging to two different parties to capture the UPCA. 

Leaders belonging to the Samajwadi Party were eyeing the UPCA where the post of secretary was currently held by Rajeev Shukla, a congress MP, sources added. 

When contacted, the state sports minister R.K. Chaudhary said that he was unaware of the circumstances leading to cancellation of the venue and added that an inquiry would be conducted to ascertain the facts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India must ensure the basics are right

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 - Im surprised two specialist spinners were played in 

 Cape Town and Centurion: Bacher 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ali Bacher 

Johannesburg: For over a decade after the countrys readmission into international cricket, former captain Dr Ali Bacher was the face of South Africa. Today, the one-time managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa (now Cricket South Africa) is recovering from a second bypass. The 64-year-old, though, spoke to The Telegraph from his residence on Thursday morning. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q Did the Indians much below par 

 performance in the ODIs surprise you? 

 A Indeed, yes... Ideally, tours 

 shouldnt begin with a one-day series and it didnt 

 help that the Indians ran into foul weather early on... 

 Its best to start with three or four-day fixtures, 

 which allow batsmen in particular to settle down... Im 

 surprised there were matches (Cape Town and Centurion) where 

 the Indians played two specialist spinners. In South Africa, 

 it has to be one and no more. Anil Kumble and Harbhajan 

 Singh are very fine bowlers, but both have to be played 

 together in the sub-continent. 

 [Incidentally, Pakistan begin their tour of South 

 Africa with a three-day match in Kimberley. The three Tests 

 will be played first, followed by the ODIs.] 

 What made the biggest difference for South 

 Africa? 

 Sticking to line and length by 

 the bowlers... They didnt bowl loose deliveries and 

 that increased the pressure on the Indian batsmen... The 

 South Africans fielding, too, was much better... The 

 Indians didnt run between the wickets well either. 

 If I may add, the Indians have mediumpacers, not anybody 

 with real pace. 

 So, what must the Indians do in the Test 

 series?

 Ensure that the basics are right... 

 Ive always believed that cricket is a simple game 

 and should be kept simple... The more you try and complicate, 

 the more the problems... The Indians did well in Potchefstroom 

 and their confidence is bound to be better. 

 Are the wickets actually going to be a 

 huge factor? 

 Youve got to be prepared 

 for bounce... The Indians coped with it on their last tour 

 (2003-04) of Australia and theres no reason why they 

 cant in South Africa... If the batsmen do have a problem, 

 then the good thing is that they know what the problem is. 

 Once thats known, finding a solution cant be 

 that much of an issue. Except the Test specialists, the 

 other batsmen have been in South Africa for a month now... 

 When in South Africa, is the adjustment 

 as much in the mind as, perhaps, technical? 

 Youve got to ready yourself 

 for certain wickets, certain conditions... After all, much 

 of cricket is mental. 

 How much of an impact can Sourav Ganguly 

 make? 

 Experience is a big thing and 

 Im sure his presence will have an effect in the dressing 

 room and outside. 

 Youve always been a big admirer 

 of Sachin Tendulkar... 

 The Indians need him to be in 

 form... Not for the first time, Sachins batting is 

 going to be critical... Even now, he has the ability to 

 change a match in one session... If hes in form then, 

 well, the Indians could spring a surprise. 

 Have you any comments on Rahul Dravids 

 captaincy?

 Hes still new to the job... 

 Hes happy leading from the front. 

 Do you have anything to say about Greg 

 Chappell as coach?

 Look, no matter what the coachs 

 profile, the captain is the boss and a coach must only act 

 as facilitator. 

 Despi te a fine record as captain, Graeme Smith seems 

 to have a number of critics in South Africa... 

 Im not one of them... He 

 hasnt got many runs in recent times, but Graeme is 

 passionate... He wants to lead from the front and likes 

 being aggressive... Hes taking the team in the right 

 direction. 

 South Africas policy of low profile 

 coaches after Bob Woolmer seems to be working... 

 The profile, as Ive said, 

 doesnt matter. 

 Its amazing that Shaun Pollock is 

 still hungry...

 Oh, yes... Hes one of South 

 Africas greatest cricketers... He may not always show 

 it, but is very passionate... He figures in my all-time 

 great South African XI, which has been listed in my biography 

 (Ali)... Shauns 33 and is comfortable with 

 his role... Its terrific to have somebody like him 

 in the dressing room. 

 Do bilateral series records mean much? 

 Well, its a fact that the 

 Indians have never won a Test in South Africa... Thats 

 there in the record books... They havent won a one-day 

 series either. 

 The final one: Smith and Co., therefore, 

 take to the three Tests as favourites... 

 (Laughs) Thats the 

 belief... One never knows, though, the Indians could surprise. 

 BACHERS ALL-TIME GREAT SA XI 

(In batting order) 

Eddie Barlow (captain), Barry Richards, Jacques Kallis, Graeme Pollock, Clive Rice, Mike Procter, Johnny Waite (wicketkeeper), Shaun Pollock, Hugh Tayfield, Allan Donald and Neil Adcock. 12th men: Jonty Rhodes, Colin Bland.

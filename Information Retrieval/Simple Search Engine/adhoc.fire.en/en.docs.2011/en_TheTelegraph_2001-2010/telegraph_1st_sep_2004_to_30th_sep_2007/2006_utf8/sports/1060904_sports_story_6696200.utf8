The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jhulan returns unnoticed

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Jhulan Goswami, who fashioned the Indian womens historic Test series victory over England in Taunton, landed in the city unnoticed on Sunday night. She even had to arrange transport to travel to her Chakdah home, some 70 km from the airport. 

We landed in Mumbai in the afternoon, but did not get any message from the Union government. This is disappointing, but certainly not big enough to overshadow the joy of scripting history in England, she told The Telegraph before heading for Chakdah. 

Jhulan, who took 10 wickets in the match, dedicated the performance to her family. 

According to the Bengal player, this was a much-needed win, as it was the first time the BCCI had financed the trip. 

After losing the ODI series 0-4 against England, we were all desperate to fight back in the Test series. The win in Taunton will give us confidence in the upcoming tournaments, the 23-year-old right-arm medium pacer said. 

Jhulan said she had focused on swing in English conditions and it paid dividends. Once I started swinging the ball, the English batswomen got nervous, she added. 

But in the end, it was team spirit which carried us through. Im extremely happy that my contribution helped us win, she maintained. 

Jhulan will rest for a few days before starting to practise. We will now go into the Asia Cup (in India) on a confident note, she said.

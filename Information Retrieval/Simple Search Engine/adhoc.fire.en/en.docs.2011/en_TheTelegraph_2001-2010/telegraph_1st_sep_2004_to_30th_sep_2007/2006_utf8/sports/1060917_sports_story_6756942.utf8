The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Geet Sethi targets gold in Doha

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: IBSF World Snooker Team champion Geet Sethi, who recently bagged the title in San Jose, finds one extra motivation for an Asian Games gold. 

The moment you see the Tricolour rising up and hear the national anthem, it is an incomparable feeling. The sole reason, too, why I feel more enthused to go all out for an Asian Games medal, Sethi said at the sidelines of a Billiards and Snooker Federation of India (BSFI) function here on Friday. 

The veteran cueist, who even after spending more than 30 years on the circuit is putting in a two-hour practice session daily in medal quest, admitted that he was under a little more pressure than usual. 

Even after thriving under pressure and profiting from it all these years, there is a wee bit more at the Asian Games, knowing that I am a medal contender to begin with. 

Meanwhile, the BSFI would announce the final Asian Games squad on Monday, newly-elected president Captain P.V.K. Mohan said. The BSFI may also rope in a Philippine coach for the Asian Games squad, Mohan added.

 QUICKSCAN: Group F 

BRAZIL (BRA) 

 Founded: 1914 

 Affiliated: 1923 

 Defending champions set 

 to crush opposition 

 The problems experienced in qualifying 

 for Korea-Japan 2002 soon became a distant memory for mighty 

 Brazil as they powered to their fifth World Cup triumph. 

 The Sele ccedil; atilde;o followed that up with success 

 in the 2004 Copa America and the 2005 Confederations Cup, 

 and also came out on top in the South American qualifying 

 group for the finals. That clean sweep sees the Brazilians 

 rightly installed as favourites. Brazil are the only team 

 to have qualified for every single World Cup. 

 Despite having to come through 

 qualifying to defend their crown the first holders 

 to enjoy this dubious distinction Brazil amassed 

 some very impressive statistics. They finished with 34 points 

 four more than they picked up last time around 

 recording nine wins, seven draws and just two defeats. 

 With appearances in the last three 

 finals and five world titles to their name, the Sele ccedil; atilde;o 

 are the most successful team in the competitions 

 history. Dida provides security between the posts, and Parreira 

 can call on the likes of Cafu, Cicinho, Juan, Lucio and 

 Roberto Carlos to shape a defence that is uncompromising, 

 rapid and resourceful. The side boasts an almost priceless 

 array of thoroughbred talent in the form of Juninho Pernambucano, 

 Robinho, Ronaldinho, Kaka, Adriano and Ronaldo, who will 

 have his sights set on becoming the leading scorer in the 

 history of the World Cup when he goes to Germany.

CROATIA (CRO)

 Quest for success under 

 Kranjcar 

 Croatia reached their third successive 

 World Cup finals by finishing top of European qualifying 

 group VIII, undefeated and with seven wins in ten matches. 

 The most notable of these victories 

 came against Sweden, their main rivals in the section who 

 achieved the same points total but lost home and away to 

 Zlatko Kranjcars side. Croatia played their first 

 World Cup finals in France. The result was a thrilling run 

 to the semi-finals which included a 3-0 quarter 

 final victory over Germany before where they lost 

 to France. There was some consolation with a 2-1 win against 

 the Netherlands in the play-off for third place, where Suker 

 struck his seventh goal to secure the Golden Shoe. 

 Four years later, the Croatians 

 second finals adventure was not so successful, resulting 

 in a first-round exit. Under Jozics successor, Otto 

 Baric, Croatia reached the Euro 2004 finals, but again exited 

 at the group stage. Hence the appointment of Kranjcar. 

 The likes of Igor Tudor and brothers 

 Niko and Robert Kovac bring experience while wing-backs 

 Srna who scored four goals in qualifying 

 and Marko Babic provide a genuine attacking threat, delivering 

 a quality service to star striker Dado Prso, Croatias 

 five-goal top scorer in their campaign.

AUSTRALIA (AUS) 

 Founded: 1961 

 Affiliated: 1963 

 Hiddinks magic works 

 again for Australia 

 For Australia, the long wait is 

 over. After 32 years, the Socceroos will return to Germany 

 scene of their one previous World Cup finals appearance 

 in 1974 for the 2006 edition of the tournament after 

 beating Uruguay 4-2 on penalties in the second leg of the 

 intercontinental play-off at Sydneys Telstra Stadium. 

 Substitute John Aloisi converted 

 the decisive spot-kick to send them through after goalkeeper 

 Mark Schwarzer had produced superb saves to deny Dario Rodriguez 

 and Marcelo Zalayeta, as Australia finally savoured success 

 in a play-off after four previous failures. 

 Trailing 0-1 from the first leg, 

 Marco Bresciano had drawn Australia level on aggregate with 

 a 34th-minute goal before Guus Hiddinks side held 

 their nerve in the climactic shoot-out to book their ticket 

 to Germany. 

 The play-off to decide who would 

 meet South Americas fourth-placed side for a place 

 in Germany was also a formality as they defeated the Solomon 

 Islands 9-1 over two legs to set up the decisive match with 

 Uruguay. 

 Australias qualification 

 triumph is another landmark for their Dutch coach Hiddink. 

 Brought on board last summer, following the departure of 

 Frank Farina, the man who led Korea Republic to the semi-finals 

 of the last World Cup has produced another act of alchemy, 

 helping Australian football erase the pain of previous play-off 

 defeats in 1985, 1993, 1997 and 2001. 

 England is the preferred destination 

 for the vast majority of the stars of the Socceroos 

 qualifying campaign with Schwarzer, Lucas Neill, Tim Cahill, 

 Mark Viduka, Craig Moore, Harry Kewell and Brett Emerton 

 all currently playing in the Premier League. Aloisi and 

 Bresciano are in Spain and Italy, respectively. 

 For the fans, bittersweet memories 

 of 1974 will be evoked. On that occasion Australia met Chile, 

 East German and West Germany in the group stages 

 and failed to score a single goal. With Hiddink at the helm, 

 hopes are high. With one dream already realised, another 

 is just beginning for Australia.

JAPAN (JPN) 

 Founded: 1921 

 Affiliated: 1929 

 Japans future is 

 now 

 Despite some inconsistent performances 

 along the way, Japan ultimately showed their class as Asian 

 champions when they became the first team to book their 

 passage to the World Cup aside from hosts Germany. 

 Germany will be Japans 

 third successive World Cup finals. They missed out on USA 

 94 through a dramatic last-minute Iraqi equaliser 

 in Doha, before finally making their World Cup finals debut 

 at France 98. Eliminated in the first round there, 

 they reached the second round on home soil in 2002 under 

 Frenchman Philippe Troussier. 

 After replacing Troussier in 2002, 

 Zico guided an under-strength Japan side to the AFC Asian 

 Cup in 2004, beating hosts China 3-1 in the final. Japan 

 have arguably Asias most formidable midfield line-up 

 in the Europe-based trio of Hidetoshi Nakata, Shunsuke Nakamura 

 and Shinji Ono, and Kashima Antlers set-piece specialist 

 Mitsuo Ogasawara. 

 Two-time Asian Player of the Year 

 Nakata is probably the best footballer Japan have ever produced, 

 but Nakamura is now considered the player to pull the strings. 

 Comparing their midfield options, Japan have limited power 

 in attack although Gamba Osaka marksman Oguro emerged last 

 year to score some vital goals in qualifying and at the 

 Confederations Cup.

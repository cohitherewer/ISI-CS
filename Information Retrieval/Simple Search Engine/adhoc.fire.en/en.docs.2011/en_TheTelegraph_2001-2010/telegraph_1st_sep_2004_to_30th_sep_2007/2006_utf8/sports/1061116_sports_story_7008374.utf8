Calcutta: As expected North Zone, who are set to lift the Duleep Trophy, put Sri Lanka A under intense pressure after declaring the innings at 636 for seven and then reducing the visitors to 259 for four at close on Day IV on Wednesday. Only a miracle can now tilt the match in favour of the Sri Lankans. 

North set the visitors a target of 340 at the Eden. The Sri Lankans are still 81 runs behind and a day to go. The highlight of the day was Mahesh Rawats unbeaten century followed by some good and accurate off-spin bowling by Rajesh Sharma. His doosras really looked dangerous on several occasions. 

The wicket offered virtually no help to the bowlers and the Sri Lankans had to toil hard to claim the wickets. But Sharma extracted some turn and bounce and was rewarded with three for 81. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 627 for seven, North batted for three more overs allowing Rawat to complete his second first-class ton. 

In the second essay, Sri Lanka obviously batted better than the first innings but that was not enough to prevent North Zone take a firm grip on the match. 

Its a pity to see the mediumpacers bowling on this wicket as there is little reward for all the hard work put in. The perfect example was former India seamer Ashish Nehra, who tried his heart out for some success, but failed to do so, courtesy the pitch. 

North Zone started on a positive note with Rawat completing his century with a boundary in a flash and following it up another hit to the fence to finish at 104. When North captain Mithun Manhas signalled the declaration, Gagandeep was batting at the other end on 2 adding one run to his previous days score. 

Sri Lanka A, after having collapsed in the first innings seemed more determined in the second. Former international Michael Vandort and Mahela Udawatte opened the innings and stitched together a 71-run partnership before Vandort was castled by Rajesh Sharma at his individual score of 37. The dismissal perhaps affected Udawattes concentration. 

Fishing outside the off-stump, Udawatte chased a wide Joginder Sharma delivery to be caught by wicketkeeper Rawat for 28. Joginder must thank Udawatte for the gift. 

The visitors first innings star Malintha Warnapura again got into the resurrection act along with captain Thilan Samaraweera (31) for the third wicket. They added 68 runs before Samaraweera was shown the door by Sharmas off-break that went through his gate. 

Warnapura and Mubarak then got together to registered their highest partnership in the match. They batted smoothly adding 90 runs for the fourth wicket, but the stand was again broken by Sharma. Mubarak was adjudged leg before at his individual score of 36. 

Warnapura is still batting on 82 off 160 balls, including 13 hits to the fences. Warnapura, who also top-scored with 65 in the first essay is holding the fort at one end while Chamara Silva has assisted him well so far with 26 off 19 including five boundaries.

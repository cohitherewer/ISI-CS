 A new theory on Smith injury

Johannesburg: How did Graeme Smith actually sustain his ankle injury? Well, it could have been at a stag party. 

It was stated that the dashing South Africa captain had got injured while running, but a caller to a Johannesburg private radio station said he was amazed to read such reports. 

I was in the area where Smith and some of his teammates were having a party. It appeared to be a stag party and they were having a jolly good time, said the caller. I am surprised that claims are being made that he was injured while running. Its one of the dumbest excuses. 

Smith himself said in an interview that he had suffered the injury to his left ankle when he was trying to get into his car while talking on the cell phone. I guess I wasnt concentrating. I was running to get into a car when my foot slipped and my shoe caught in the gap between the pavement and the road. 

He said it was a bad way to end a relaxed weekend with family and friends, including some teammates and a mate who is getting married. Fortunately my parents were there and they drove me back to Cape Town. 

Smith was examined in Cape Town and transferred to Pretoria where he underwent surgery. He has been ruled out of the two-Test tour and tri-series in Sri Lanka. (PTI)

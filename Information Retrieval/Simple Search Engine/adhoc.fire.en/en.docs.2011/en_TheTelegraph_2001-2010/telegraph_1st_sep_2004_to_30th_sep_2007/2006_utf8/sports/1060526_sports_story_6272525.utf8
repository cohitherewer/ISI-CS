 Souravs 1st tie for Northants on June 25

London: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly will play in the English season for third time after he signed up for Northamptonshire Cricket Club for a two-month stint. 

Sourav, who played for Lancashire in 2000 and Glamorgan last summer, would be a replacement for Chris Rogers, who has been called up to play for Australia A. 

Indias most successful captain will play his first match for Northants on June 25 in the C amp;G Trophy limited-overs tie against Nottinghamshire. 

Sourav is a very exciting player to watch. He is a tremendous batsman and will be highly motivated as he is keen to win back his place in the Indian team, said Kepler Wessels, Northamptonshires coach and former South African captain. 

Sourav, who has scored 5221 runs in 88 Tests and 10123 in 279 one-dayers, will also have a taste of Twenty20 competition. 

We are delighted that Sourav has signed. It took a while to finalise but we were never worried as we had had verbal confirmation. He will be a very exciting player, particularly in the Twenty20 Cup matches, chief executive Mark Tagg said. 

Ticket sales for all the Twenty20 matches are already selling well, added Tagg, And now with the added bonus of watching a world-class cricketer, we expect to sell out well in advance.

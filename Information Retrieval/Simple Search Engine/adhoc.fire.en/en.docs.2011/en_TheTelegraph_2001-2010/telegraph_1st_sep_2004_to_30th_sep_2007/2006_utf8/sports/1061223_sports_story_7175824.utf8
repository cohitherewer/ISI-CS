 Wada challenges lifting of ban

 Shoaib-Asif Issue 

Karachi: The World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) has challenged the exoneration of Pakistani fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif from doping charges in the Court of Arbitration for Sports in Lausanne. 

Wada media relations manager Fridiric Donzi said the agency on Thursday filed the appeal, exercising its right as given in the Wada code. 

Wada has exercised its independent right to appeal, provided in the World Anti-Doping Code, to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against the Pakistani Cricket Boards appeals panel decision to overturn the sports sanctions of two athletes who recently tested positive for performance- enhancing drugs, Donze said. 

As Wada believes that the decision to overturn the sports sanctions is not in conformity with the World Anti-Doping Code, Wada has exercised its responsibility to ensure proper implementation of and compliance with the code, he said. 

The Wada appeal comes after the International Cricket Council (ICC) also announced few days back it would support any such move by the agency. 

Shoaib and Asif were banned for two years and one year, respectively, by a PCB-appointed drug tribunal after the duo tested positive for nandrolone in out-of-competition dope tests conducted by the board ahead of the Champions Trophy in India. 

But an appeals panel lifted their bans, saying the pacemen did not take the banned drug intentionally. 

Sources said the dissenting report on the exoneration by one of the members of the appeals panel, Dr Danish Zaheer, would be used by Wada to strengthen their case.

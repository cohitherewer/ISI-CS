 Prithwi, Koustav sole leaders

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Prithwi Sinha and Koustav Kundu emerged as sole leaders in their respective age-groups with five points at the fifth round in the 18th State Age-Group Chess Championships at the Bhowanipur Gujarati Education Society on Monday. 

Prithwi, playing against Supradip Maity with the black pieces in the U-9 group, defended well against the F7 attack by Supradip. Prithwi exchanged the queens on the 17th move after which white was left with a weak e-pawn. 

Supradip made Prithwis task easier by losing his rook for the bishop after which the latter had little difficulty in wrapping up the game in 42 moves. 

In the U-7 category, Kaustav Kundu finally prevailed against Avigyan Das in a game of fluctuating fortunes to win the game in 42 moves.

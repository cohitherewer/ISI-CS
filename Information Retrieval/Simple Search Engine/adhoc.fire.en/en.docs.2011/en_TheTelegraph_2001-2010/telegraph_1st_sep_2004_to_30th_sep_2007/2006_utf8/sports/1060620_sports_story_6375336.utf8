 Ghana success not a surprise, says Chima

New Delhi: Chima Okerie has a dream to realise and for that he is ready to go to any extent. Standing alone in the VIP enclosure of the empty Ambedkar Stadium Monday morning, the former Nigerian striker, whose booming shots and dazzling goals once set the stands of this very stadium on fire, waited patiently with a pen and diary in his hands. 

I am waiting for a group of local boys who would be coming here to appear for Bengal Mumbai Football Club (BMFC) trials, Chima told The Telegraph with the patent smile on his face. I have recently been appointed the coach of BMFC. I plan to recruit young, talented boys from all over India, rather than signing some known faces from a handful of clubs. 

Believe me, I am not doing it for the purpose of any publicity, Chima remarked in a low, but confident voice. For the last few days I am, like any other African, following the progress of the African teams in the World Cup. And after watching them do so well against the best in the world, I felt that I could also help Indian football progress in the same manner. Given a chance, I am ready to go to the nook and corner of India to find talented boys. 

To Chima, the stunning success of Ghana against Czech Republic did not come as a surprise. It was expected. If there was anyone who underestimated Ghanas strength on the eve of the World Cup, it was simply their problem, Chima said, waving hands in his typical style. 

Chima, who top scored in the Calcutta Football League six times, feels one among three Ghanaian footballers ? Michael Essien (Chelsea), Sulley Ali Muntari (Udinese) and Stephen Appiah (Fenerbache) ? have the ability to emerge the best player in the World Cup. 

Essien, of course, turned famous even before the World Cup when he joined Chelsea. But look at Muntari or Appiah. They are highly skilful and accomplished footballers. They are better than any of those big names in the market. 

While Chima is confident that Ghana would definitely make the second round, he is hopeful that others, too, will not give up without a fight. One can spot class even in Togo or Angola. They may crash out in the end, but not before putting up a fight. 

Unlike in India, players in Africa play club football all over the world. That makes them better footballers, Chima said. Here there is no supply line for upcoming players. I have full sympathy for Bhaichung (Bhutia), who recently said that he wont like to play for India anymore. I dont blame him. How long is he supposed to carry the team on his shoulders? 

Asked whether he would like Fifa to increase quota for Asia and Africa in the World Cup, Chima said the nature of groupings should be changed. 

Why make it like Africa, European or Asian Zones? Let there be different groups where teams like India, Spain, Mexico or Uruguay get into one group in the qualifiers. 

But will not India get thrashed in such groups? So what? India will be thrashed once or twice. Thereafter, they will gain in confidence. As it is India are getting thrashed by Japan and Yemen. Whats the harm in giving it a try, he signed off.

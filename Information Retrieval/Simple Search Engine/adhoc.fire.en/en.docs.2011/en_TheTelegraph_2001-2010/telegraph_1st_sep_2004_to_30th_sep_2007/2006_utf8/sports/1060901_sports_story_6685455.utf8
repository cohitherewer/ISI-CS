 Dhoni expects tough tri-series in Malaysia

Chennai: Team India are looking for a positive start to the forthcoming tri-series in Kuala Lumpur, wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Thursday. 

According to the Indian wicketkeeper, the series also involving Australia and the West Indies will be a tough one. Australia is a very challenging team. They are the world leaders. We are expecting a tough series, but will like to start on a positive note, Dhoni said. 

Dhoni, however, advocated the team managements move of experimenting with positions of players in order to have the best team fielded for the World Cup. 

Experiments are in tune to get a final composition of players for the World Cup. In fact, we are also planning to prepare on slower wickets, which will be close to those in the West Indies and Sri Lanka, for the Champions Trophy, he said. 

Dhoni said it was better to undertake various experiments now. We cant wait for the World Cup and then start experimenting, he said. 

In the West Indies, wickets were slow and the ball was not coming to the bat. It was not easy to play big shots. I hope it will hold us in good stead in the World Cup, he added. 

On the ongoing camp in Bangalore, Dhoni said it was mainly to improve individual skills. Its a one-to-one camp for specific training. Everyone (support staff) is there for the individual. 

Describing the camp as very different, Dhoni said it helped the players speak out. Even the earlier commando training camp was to encourage team work, he said. 

Dhoni said the dual roles of batsman and wicketkeeper were physically very challenging. Even in domestic cricket, it is tough, but you get used to it, he said. 

He said it was tough keeping to Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble but he found Virender Sewhag more difficult to deal as some of his deliveries turned considerably.

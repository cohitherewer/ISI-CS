 Sethi shocked by Siddarth

Chennai: Former world champion Geet Sethi started off well but failed miserably, losing his first round match to Siddarth Parekh of Railways 440-384 in a group C round robin league match of the BSNL National Senior Billiards Championship here on Monday. 

In the first round, among the nine best of two hour matches that were gone through in two sessions, former Asian and national champion Ashok Shandilya displayed excellent form to come up with an elegant break of 237 in his 16th visit to take the score from 250-192 to 487-192, before winning the match with a tally of 574-215. 

World IBSF champion Pankaj Advani returned the highest score for the day with a total of 724 in 21 visits, with breaks of 147 (first) and 131 (11th), beating Bengals Brijesh, who tallied 323. 

Sethi, representing Gujarat, began with a century break, but was inconsistent, while Parekh came up with six fifty-plus breaks in a methodical manner for a win. 

PSPBs Alok Kumar defeated Antim Singhvi of Railways 561-301, Rupesh Shah of Gujarat beat Tamil Nadus M. C. Manoj 394-369, B. Bhaskar of Karnataka won against Uttar Pradeshs I. S. Malik 541-240 and Dhruv Sitawala of PSCB scored over V. Subramaniam of Maharashtra.

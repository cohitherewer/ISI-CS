 Ponting shocked and saddened

 - Winning last Two Tests would be a fitting end for him 

 Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting 

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting admitted on Friday he was shocked and saddened after Shane Warne decided to quit. 

In his first comments since Warne stunned the cricket world with his announcement he was retiring from international cricket, Ponting however revealed that he did not try to change his teammates mind. 

Ponting said he was saddened to lose such a good teammate but respected the spin kings decision, and vowed that it would not change the teams determination to complete a 5-0 Ashes whitewash. 

I think I was a bit shocked, a bit saddened like everybody else was not that he made the decision because hed obviously thought long and hard about wanting to retire... But because of the fact I played with him for so long and hes a really good friend of mine and Ive learned a lot from him about the game. 

Whenever you lose someone youve been close to for a long period of time, its sad. But hes obviously made that decision on other things he wanted to do in his life, so I didnt at any stage ever try to talk him out of it, Ponting said. 

Warne on Thursday revealed that he had broken the news to Ponting as the team celebrated clinching the series by winning the third Test in Perth this week. 

Ponting said he had impressed on the team the need to win the remaining two Tests in Melbourne and Sydney as a testament to Warne. 

We want to win the next two games. It would be a fitting end for Shane if we did that and thats the way weve got to approach these next two, he said. 

Ponting also stressed that Australia could not afford to rest on their laurels after reclaiming the Ashes from England. 

 CA mulls offer

 Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) is considering offering Warne an ldquo;attractive proposition rdquo; as mentor and technician to the country rsquo;s emerging spinners after the end of his international career.

 CA chief executive James Sutherland said the new role would be offered provided there is enough time between his commitments with Hampshire and a likely seat in the commentary box. (Agencies)

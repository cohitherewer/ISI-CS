 India fall prey to D/L method

 - Sachins 40th century goes in vain 

Kuala Lumpur: Sachin Tendulkars sizzling unbeaten 141 on comeback went in vain as the West Indies won the rain-hit second one-dayer of the DLF Cup tri-series by 29 runs on Duckworth-Lewis method here on Thursday. 

Sachin seemed to have put India in the box seat with his scintillating knock, propelling the team to 309 for five in the day-night encounter at the Kinrara Oval. 

But the Windies ran away with the victory after making 141 for two in 20 overs, which was more than the required par score of 112 for two at that stage, before showers disrupted the proceedings. 

Opener Chris Gayle set up the chase with a 35-ball 45 and the momentum was sustained by Ramnaresh Sarwan, 37 off 49 balls, and captain Brian Lara, 27 off 30 balls. 

The West Indies had lost the opening match of the series by 78 runs against Australia on Tuesday. 

India take on the three-time world champions at the same venue on Saturday. 

Sachin announced his return to international cricket in style by carrying his bat for his 40th one-day hundred. 

The 33-year-old, who had been out of action since March after undergoing a shoulder surgery, smashed 13 fours and five sixes in his 148-ball knock. 

On a pitch of unreliable bounce, Sachin played an innings of high technical excellence that showed him at his batting. The 41 singles and nine twos he ran proved his fitness beyond doubt. 

It was Sachins first full innings for India after the third and final Test against England earlier this year in Mumbai. 

The champion batsman had batted a handful of deliveries in the rained out one-dayer against Sri Lanka in Colombo which lasted only 16 minutes and 22 balls in all. 

Irfan Pathan yet again showcased his batting prowess with a 64 that dominated the middle overs while Suresh Rainas 34, in combination with Sachins improvisation, provided thrust in the final overs. 

Jerome Taylor, who took four wickets against Australia in the first match, once again was the best bowler with three for 64. The last time Sachin played a triple-figure innings was against Pakistan in Peshawar earlier this year.

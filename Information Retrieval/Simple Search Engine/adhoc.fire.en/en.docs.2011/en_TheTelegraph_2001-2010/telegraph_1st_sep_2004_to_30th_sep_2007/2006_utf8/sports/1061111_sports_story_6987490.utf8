 Chowrasia tops again

 Jamshedpur Golf 

Jamshedpur: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasias brilliant final-day charge brought him a six-under 64 and helped him annex the Rs 20 lakh Tata Open title for the third time in four years. 

The 2003 and 2005 champion, who missed the 2004 edition due to an injury, showed why he is a golfer to worth watching. Chowrasia blazed the course despite the early morning rain, which delayed play by 90 minutes. Chowrasias Friday card included eighth birdies and two bogeys, which gave him a tournament total of 15-under. He finished four strokes clear of overnight leader Naman Dawar and Vivek Bhandari. 

Chowrasia, who had finished second in the Indian Open and third in the Bilt Open, received a cheque for Rs 3,24,000. 

I had been coming close to a title in recent weeks. It feels good to finally win one. Also, the Tata Open is surely my favourite tournament as I have now won it three times, said a beaming Chowrasia, who will next play in the $ 2 million Hong Kong Open. 

I was surprised how easily I won. Things fell in place for me today. The greens were fantastic at Beldih, said Chowrasia.

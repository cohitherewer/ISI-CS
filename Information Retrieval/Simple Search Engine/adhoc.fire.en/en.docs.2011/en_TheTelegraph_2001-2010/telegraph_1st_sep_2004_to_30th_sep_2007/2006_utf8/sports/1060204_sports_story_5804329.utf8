The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Daniel holds the key 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: There are seven in the line-up for Saturdays star event, the 2,800m Queen Elizabeth II Cup, but the race appears to be a straight contest between the Daniel Davids duo of Rasalas and Supreme Princess. Both are upcoming youngsters and are sure to relish the slated trip. 

 However, going by Rasalas courageous performance against Aperitivo in the Indian Champion Cup, the Storm Trooper-Ruddles son is expected to triumph in the hands of jockey G. Ross.

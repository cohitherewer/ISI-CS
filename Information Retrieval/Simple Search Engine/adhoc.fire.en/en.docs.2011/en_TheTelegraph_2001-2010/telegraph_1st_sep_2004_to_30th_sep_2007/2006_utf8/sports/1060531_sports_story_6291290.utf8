 Ill play through pain: Ljungberg

 - Hopes high that midfielder will shake off fitness problems 

Fredrik Ljungbergs club season may have ended in crushing disappointment in Paris, but hopes are high in his home country that the injury-plagued midfielder can cast off his fitness problems to spearhead Swedens challenge at the World Cup. 

Ljungbergs performance for Arsenal, along with Henrik Larssons for Barcelona, in that Champions League final would certainly have been greeted by a huge sigh of relief by their watching countrymen. After another interrupted and inconsistent season with Arsenal, the 29-year-old produced a sparkling display, matched only by Larssons ? now familiar ? cameo role for Barcelona, rising from the bench to provide the killer passes for victory. 

It was great to have two Swedes playing in the final, the midfielder, who has hit a rich vein of form in the past few months, told fifaworldcup.com. Im happier now because I prefer to play centrally, where Im more involved and can break through from deeper positions. 

Following injuries to hip, calf, shoulder, rib, hand and toe, Ljungberg revealed last month that he was once again playing through the pain barrier, this time requiring to drain blood from his foot after every match. 

It swells up with blood and we have to leak it out, he says. It hurts during a match but the pain doesnt prevent me from running. 

A grisly account, and one that will worry expectant Swedish fans already concerned by the loss of form suffered by the third part of Swedens star forward line, Zlatan Ibrahimovic. 

The new year has not smiled kindly on Ibrahimovic, whose outstanding performances for club and country in 2005 won him Swedens Player of the Year award, and he arrives in Germany having scored just seven times in Serie A this season. 

I cant comment on Zlatan because I havent seem him play recently but I can understand Swedish people being worried about it, Ljungberg admits. 

Form, though, can be an unreliable barometer of success when it comes to World Cup finals. Few players arrived in Korea-Japan in hotter form, after all, than Ljungberg, then sporting a shock of red hair, but a much-publicised training ground bust-up with defender Olof Mellberg and more injury woe ensured that he left Asia with bitter-sweet memories. 

Approaching his second finals, the midfielder, now shaven-headed, is taking a more judicious view of Swedens chances. 

Emerging from a group comprised by Paraguay, Trinidad and Tobago and, once again, England ? a team Sweden have not lost to in 38 years ? may appear none too difficult for some, Ljungberg remains cautious. Everyone thought we would beat Senegal last time, he said. The trouble was they thought that was an easy game ? but it was only easy in theory. That has been our main problem, winning when people expect it. 

As Scandinavias sole representatives this time, Sweden are nevertheless hopeful of performing well once the quadrennial showpiece begins. 

We know that on a good day we can beat anyone, said the teams coach, Lars Lagerback. If you want to go far in the World Cup, then you must play 100 per cent in each match and you have to do that in seven games, which is very, very hard. 

For Ljungberg, meanwhile, the tournament motto will be no pain, no gain. Its pain I am willing to take, he adds. Im going to have to cope with this.

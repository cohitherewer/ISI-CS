 Sourav has been mistreated: Amarnath

 Jalandhar: Former India 

 cricketer Mohinder Amarnath pitched in for Sourav Ganguly, 

 saying that the former skipper had not received the treatment 

 commensurate with his contribution to the game. 

The former allrounder, who lost out in the race for the post of Indias coach to Greg Chappell, said that Sourav was not given enough chance to prove his mettle before he was left out of the squad for the first Test against England starting on Wednesday. 

 In Pakistan also, Sourav was included only in 

 two Test matches, and was later kept out (of the ODI series) 

 without any specific reason for the same, Amarnath 

 said. 

 He also advised Sourav to keep playing in the domestic 

 matches as he had the ability to make a comeback.

 Amarnath also said that the Board 

 of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) should have more 

 former players in its ranks as currently politicians and 

 industrialists have been dominating the board, which was 

 not good for cricket.

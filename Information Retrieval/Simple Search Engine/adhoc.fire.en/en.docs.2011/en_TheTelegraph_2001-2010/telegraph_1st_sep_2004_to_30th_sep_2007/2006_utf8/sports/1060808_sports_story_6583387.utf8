 Arsenal in tricky tie vs Zagreb

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE 

 Arsene Wenger 

Paris: The long road to Champions League glory begins for some of the most famous names in European football on Tuesday as the final qualifiying rounds of the worlds most prestigious club competition kicks off. 

Last seasons beaten finalists Arsenal and two-time winners Benfica are the first of the glamour clubs to enter the fray when they meet Croatias Dinamo Zagreb and Austria Vienna in their respective first-leg matches. 

At stake is a place in the lucrative group stages, a prize which is worth millions of dollars in prize money, gate receipts and television revenues for the clubs taking part. 

Failure to negotiate their tricky tie with Zagreb would be nothing short of a disaster for Arsenal, who are desperate to start recouping the cost of their gleaming new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium. 

The English giants will travel to the Croatian capital without a host of first-choice players including captain Thierry Henry, suspended Jens Lehmann, Ashley Cole and Freddie Ljungberg. 

Wenger is furious that he faces losing Henry on international duty for France next week so soon after the World Cup, and says Fifas fixture scheduling has disrupted the Gunners pre-season preparations. 

We are physically behind the level we would like but thats down to the fact that Fifa is not changing international games for the start of the season, Wenger said. 

That causes congestion before the start of the Champions League, but we just have to get on with it. 

I cannot get Thierry Henry ready because he played in the World Cup and then I have to give him away again for a friendly international before he plays for us. That shows how ridiculous the whole situation is.

 D-Day looms for Giles

PAUL BOLTON 

 Giles may play in latter stages of India tour 

England are likely to decide on Tuesday what part, if any, Ashley Giles will play in their forthcoming tour to India. Giles, still to resume bowling after surgery on the hip injury which forced him to return home early from the pre-Christmas tour of Pakistan, will not be fit when the tour party leave next week. 

The Warwickshire slow left-armer would like to be given time to continue his rehabilitation in Droitwich and join the tour at a later date. Englands medical staff will debate his prospects at a meeting in Loughborough next week. 

Warwickshire fitness coach Simon Hollyhead, who has been actively involved in Giles rehabilitation, will present an up-to-date fitness report to Kirk Russell, Englands physiotherapist, and Nigel Stockill, Englands physiologist. 

We hope that Ashley will be able to play a part in the latter stages of the tour, Hollyhead said. England have put the Somerset allrounder Ian Blackwell on standby as a replacement. 

Mark Garaway, Blackwells former county coach, will be joining England in India following his appointment as team analyst and assistant coach. 

Garaway, 32, replaces Tim Boon, who resigned last month to become Leicestershires new senior coach. 

Garaway played only four first-class matches during his career as Hampshires reserve wicketkeeper, but he is an ECB level four coach.

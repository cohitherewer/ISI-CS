 Kaiser slams play-actors

Berlin: World Cup organiser Franz Beckenbauer on Thursday criticised players for trying to get their opponents sent off by play-acting, a practice known as simulation. 

Players are simulating and doing whatever they can to make it difficult for the referee, Beckenbauer told a press conference. This is something we need to look at after the World Cup. 

Beckenbauer, who led West Germany to World Cup glory in 1974 and guided his nation to the 1990 title as coach, also criticised Russian referee Valentin Ivanovs handling of Portugals stormy last 16 game against The Netherlands.

 Jeev slips three spots to 144

New Delhi: It turned out to be an ordinary week for Indian golfers as they slipped southwards in the world rankings released on Monday. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, who saw his streak of top-10 finishes come to an end at the Sun Chlorella Classic in Hokkaido, Japan, dropped three places and was placed at 144. 

The Chandigarh golfer, who had managed six top-10 finishes going into the tournament, finished tied-21st at the Japanese Tour event. 

But Jyoti Randhawa was the worst performer as he fell down four places to 164th. 

Randhawa had a horrendous outing at the Scandinavian Masters at Malmo, Sweden, where he missed the cut following a 116th placing on the second day. 

Arjun Atwal and Shiv Kapur, who stayed off the course, retained their previous weeks ranking of 194 and 175, respectively. 

 Daniel Chopra was another loser, slipping down 10 

 places to 187, thanks to a forgettable outing at the Buick 

 Open on the USPGA Tour where he missed the cut.

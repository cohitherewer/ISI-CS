 Im hoping for a big score: Sanath

 Jayasuriya at practice in Kandy on Sunday

Kandy: Sri Lanka cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya plans to end his 15-year Test career on a high with a big score and an historic home series win against Pakistan. 

Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka highest run scorer in Tests and one-dayers, has announced that he will be retiring after the second Test against Pakistan that starts on Monday in Kandy. 

The opening Test in the two-match series in Colombo was drawn after a match-saving unbeaten 148 from opener Shoaib Malik denied Sri Lanka their first home win against Pakistan in 20 years. 

Im hoping for a big score but Ill just be looking to play my natural game to help win this series, Jayasuriya said after training. It is sad to be preparing for my last-ever Test but were just focusing on the positives from the last match. We bounced back really well against Pakistan with some fine batting in the second innings and we need to put them under the same kind of pressure here. 

Sri Lanka will once again miss the services of Chaminda Vaas, their premier pace bowler, who has not yet recovered from a side strain. Pakistan have been boosted by the news that Mohammed Yousuf has recovered from a hamstring injury that forced him to miss the first Test.

 Majola wants Pawar help

 Gibbs-Boje issue

 Durban: United Cricket 

 Board of South Africa is banking on BCCI chief Sharad Pawar 

 to bail out their match-fixing tainted cricketers Herschelle 

 Gibbs and Nicky Boje.

 UCB Chief Executive Gerald Majola 

 said he was looking forward to Pawars co-operation 

 as far as the cases of the duo with the Indian police was 

 concerned.

 We are working hard behind 

 scenes to assist Gibbs and Boje to be able to tour India. 

 We hope Pawar will assist us, Majola was quoted as 

 saying in the media on Tuesday.

 Majola said he hoped Pawar would 

 be able to convince Indian police to drop the investigation 

 against Gibbs and Boje, who are still wanted for questioning 

 for their alleged role in the match-fixing scandal of 2000.

 The fear of arrest has kept the 

 two cricketers away from playing in India since the last 

 six years. The duo skipped two tours ? in November 2004 

 and November 2005. (PTI)

 NZ bowl-out West Indies

Sydney: New Zealand beat the West Indies in a bowl-out after their Twenty20 match in Auckland ended in a draw on Thursday. 

The match was decided by a soccer-style shootout in which the teams took turns bowling at the stumps after both teams made 126 from their 20 overs. 

The West Indies missed with all six of their attempts at hitting the stumps. New Zealand were successful with three of their six bowls. 

West Indies, batting first, lost seven wickets for 126 with Daren Ganga and captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul both making 26. 

New Zealand lost eight wickets in their reply. The Kiwis looked to have the match under control when they raced to 73 for two in the 10th over, only to lose 44 for six in the last 10 overs. 

Opener Lou Vincent was the top-scorer with 42 from 37 balls, but the batting collapse left the home team needing 16 off the last over, including a boundary from the last ball, to force the tie. 

Restricting a side to 120 on Eden Park is a very good effort ? we got some good things out of that first 20 overs, captain Stephen Fleming was quoted as saying.

 New Zealand fight back strongly on Day II

Johannesburg: A five-wicket haul by fast bowler Chris Martin and an improved second innings batting performance gave New Zealand a chance to save the series on Day II of the third and final Test against South Africa at the Wanderers on Saturday. 

Martin took five for 37 as South Africa were bowled out for 186 in reply to New Zealands first innings total of 119. New Zealand were 214 for six in their second innings at close, a lead of 147. 

South African allrounder Jacques Kallis took two wickets, taking his Test career total to 200. Kallis and former West Indian great Sir Garfield Sobers are the only players to have scored 8000 runs and taken 200 wickets in Tests. 

New Zealand need to win the Test to share the series and to keep their fifth place on the International Cricket Councils rankings. If sixth-ranked South Africa win the series, they will swap places with the New Zealanders. 

New Zealand quickly lost Jamie How at the start of their second innings and were 40 for two when Kallis dismissed Michael Papps in the last over before lunch. 

But captain Stephen Fleming (37), Scott Styris (42) and Nathan Astle (45) led a solid batting effort on a pitch which continued to help the bowlers, although playing easier than it had in the morning.

 BCCI says Sehwag is fit

New Delhi: The cloud of uncertainly over Virender Sehwags fitness was cleared on Sunday when the BCCI secretary, Niranjan Shah, declared the dashing Delhi batsman fit for the opening one-dayer against England at the Kotla on Tuesday. 

I have been told that Sehwag is fit. In that case, I see no reason why he should not play the match, Shah told The Telegraph. 

Earlier in the afternoon, Sehwag went through the drills along with other Indian teammates at the Kotla on Sunday with his cover Tejinder Pal Singhs presence indicating the suspense about his availability on account of a back spasm. 

The team management, however, was quick to deny that the Railways batsman has been inducted into the team as a replacement for Sehwag. 

TP Singh is a good batsman and a local boy. Thats the reason why he has been called to the nets on Sunday, team manager GS Walia said. 

There is no reason to predict that he would replace Sehwag. 

Even after saying this, Walia himself created some amount of confusion about the openers fitness. 

(John) Gloster told me that he was happy with the way Sehwag is progressing. He is much fitter at the moment. A final announcement, however, will only be made after a final check on Tuesday, Walia said. 

A couple of hours later, the board secretary announced that Sehwag was fit to play. 

Sehwag did not look to be in any kind of discomfort when he batted at the nets for quite some time. He did the fielding practice under coach Greg Chappell and went through the regular drills. 

Walia, however, despite his broad assurances, could not stop eyebrows being raised about TP Singhs presence at the nets. 

The 28-year-old Railways batsman had a mediocre Ranji Trophy season and even got dropped from the team at one point of time. He, however, had a few good outings in the one-dayers. 

Other than hitting a century in the Ranji one-dayers, he had a couple of half centuries to his credit in Deodhar Trophy. More than his batting, TP Singh is known for his exceptionally good fielding abilities. 

Fielding is one area where India need to improve drastically, though middle order batsman Mohammed Kaif disagreed with the notion when he came over to talk to the media during the practice session. 

Fielding has been a strong point of our team. One match or one series is not a true indicator of how good we are at it. It is one area we have done well and we want to do better. 

Kaif admitted there are grey areas in the team, but added the coach and the captain know where to improve. 

On the Mumbai defeat, Kaif said it wont hamper the progress of the team in one-dayers. 

Both are totally different ball games. The team has come up well (in the one-dayers). We have to start the series on a positive note, the first two matches will be important, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zaheer Khan, Gautam Gambhir likely to make the cut

 - ODIs In South Africa 

 Anil Kumble may not be recalled right now

 Zaheer Khan 

Chandigarh: Left-arm mediumpacer Zaheer Khan and left-handed opener Gautam Gambhir are tipped to make the Team India 15 for the five-match ODI series in South Africa, beginning November 19. The three Tests there begin later. 

Injuries to Ajit Agarkar and Yuvraj Singh have opened the door for them... Its not confirmed that they will board the flight for South Africa, but its going to be a surprise if they dont make the squad, a well-placed source told The Telegraph Sunday. 

While Agarkar fractured his left thumb, Thursday, Yuvraj twisted his left knee two days later. Board secretary Niranjan Shah confirmed that the former would be out of action for four weeks. The extent of Yuvrajs lay-off will be known after his injury has been assessed by the Mumbai-based Dr Anant Joshi. 

The selectors chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, Venkatapathi Raju, Bhupinder Singh, Sanjay Jagdale and Ranjib Biswal meet here Monday morning. They may, by the way, ask the Board for permission to send an extra player. 

 Gautam Gambhir

Its going to be a first for this quintet: Even though the Champions Trophy began after the committee came into being last month, the squad had been picked under Kiran Mores chairmanship. 

The source added: Sourav Ganguly would have been in the frame, and pretty strongly at that, had he got runs in the Challenger and the Duleep Trophy... In four innings, he couldnt even get a 30, forget anything better... 

The committee has two new faces (Vengsarkar and Raju), but the former captain shouldnt expect any sympathy. First, he must himself perform. 

While Zaheers last ODI was in Karachi, eight months ago, Gambhirs last appearance was in the Faridabad match against England (end-March). 

Significantly, even though veteran Anil Kumble has resumed playing, the selectors dont seem inclined to recall him straightaway. Domestic cricket is allowing Kumble to get into rhythm, but hes very valuable and we dont want to rush his return at the international level... Lets see, is how one of the selectors put it. 

Kumble had to go off cricket when he developed tendonitis on his bowling shoulder while turning out for Surrey after the Test series in the West Indies this summer. 

LIKELY 15 (as of Sunday night)

 Batsmen: Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Mohammed Kaif, Dinesh Mongia, Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina.

Wicketkeeper: Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Spinners: Harbhajan Singh, Ramesh Powar/Anil Kumble. 

Mediumpacers: Zaheer Khan, Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth, Munaf Patel.

 Dark horse: Tamil Nadu batsman S. Badrinath.

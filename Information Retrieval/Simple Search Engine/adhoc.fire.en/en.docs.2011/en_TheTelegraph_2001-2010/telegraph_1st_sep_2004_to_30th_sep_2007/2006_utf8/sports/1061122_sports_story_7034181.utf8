 Dravid lauds Lara

Durban: Team India captain Rahul Dravid Tuesday heaped praise on Brian Lara. Along with Sachin, Lara is one of the best players of my generation. I actually watched a bit of his innings and his play against spinners was sensational, remarked Dravid. 

I have watched from close quarters some of his memorable knocks and he seems to get better and better as he is getting older. It is difficult to match him. He is somebody you can admire but cant copy. At my age it is difficult for me to bat the way Lara does. (PTI)

 Arjun falters to end tied 28th

Sanya (China): Arjun Singh was unable to capitalise on a good mid-round display as he dropped three shots on last two holes and slipped to one-over for tied 28th finish at the $300,000 Volkaswagen Masters China. 

Retief Goosen of South Africa retained the title by three strokes after a one-under-par 71. 

World No.7 Goosen finished the week with an impressive 21-under-par 267 total at the Yalong Bay Golf Club for his 26th career victory and his first this year. 

Among Indians, Gurbaaz Mann (71) finished tied 28th, Digvijay Singh (73) was tied 35th and Amandeep Johl (70) was tied 49th. 

Arjun had a roller-coaster of a round as he double-bogeyed on second and then birdied third, seventh and eighth. But he also bogeyed fourth and sixth. 

On back nine, he eagled the 13th and birdied the 14th and seemed to have recovered. But a double bogey on 17th and bogey on 18th dented his chances. 

New Zealands Michael Campbell was runner-up for a second successive year after a closing 68. (PTI)

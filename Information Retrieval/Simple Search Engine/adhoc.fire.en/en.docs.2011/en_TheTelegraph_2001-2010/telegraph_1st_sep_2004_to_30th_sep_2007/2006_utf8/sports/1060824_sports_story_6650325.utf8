 Milan, Liverpool 

in group stage

London: Former champions AC Milan and Liverpool advanced to the lucrative group stage of the European Champions League on Tuesday, six-time titlists Milan beating Red Star Belgrade 2-1 and Liverpool drawing 1-1 with Maccabi Haifa to stay in search of their sixth crown. 

Two-time winners Benfica also made it after a 3-0 victory over Austria Vienna. Another former champion, SV Hamburg, reached the group stage when a 1-1 draw at Spains Osasuna sent the Bundesliga club through on away goals. 

A two-time runner-up, Valencia beat Red Bull Salzburg 3-0 to advance 3-1. Initially banned from the competition due to their involvement in Italys match-fixing scandal, Milan were given a reprieve on appeal and allowed back in at the third qualifying round. 

The scorer of Milans goal in their 1-0 first-leg victory, Filippo Inzaghi, tallied again on a header in the 28th minute after a perfect cross by Gennaro Gattuso from the edge of the penalty area. 

The Serie A team doubled their lead in the 78th on a close-range shot by Clarence Seedorf, the only player to have won the title with three different clubs. (AP)

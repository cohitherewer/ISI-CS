 B test clears Marion Jones

THE DAILY TELEGRAPH 

Five-time Olympic medallist Marion Jones has been cleared of doping allegations after her B sample came back negative for the blood-booster EPO. 

The 30-year-old Americans initial sample had tested positive for the banned drug (erythropoietin) in June, but the result of the back-up test means she is free to compete. Jones would have faced a two-year ban. 

It is rare for a B test results to contradict the original sample, although tests for EPO have proved unreliable in the past. 

I am absolutely ecstatic, Jones said in a statement. I am anxious to get back on the track. 

I have always maintained that I have never ever taken performance-enhancing drugs, and I am pleased that a scientific process has now demonstrated that fact. 

Jones has always denied taking performance-enhancing substances and has never previously failed a doping test. 

She has been under investigation in connection with the Balco laboratory doping scandal although has never been charged with a doping offence. 

She won five medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, including gold in the 100 and 200 metres and 4x400 relay.

 Pollock may be fit to play final Test vs NZ

Johannesburg: Shaun Pollock bowled without discomfort for a second day in a row as the Proteas prepared for the third and final Test against New Zealand beginning at the Wanderers on Friday. 

South Africa lead the series 1-0 after winning the first Test by 128 runs and drawing the second. 

Pollock withdrew from the second Test on the opening morning with a spasm in his lower back. He bowled six overs on Wednesday, and another six on Thursday without any problems from his back. 

Shane Jabaar, the physiotherapist, has advised me to take things slowly and not be over-hasty. I dont think Ill have problems given how Im feeling now, Pollock said. 

New Zealand will have to decide whether to play two spinners, as they did in the second Test, based on a reading of the pitch which has been prepared with the assistance of gas heaters and tents to emulate a warmer climate. 

We will probably not play two spinners, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said. Kyle Mills, who bowled very well in the first Test, can come back in. (AP)

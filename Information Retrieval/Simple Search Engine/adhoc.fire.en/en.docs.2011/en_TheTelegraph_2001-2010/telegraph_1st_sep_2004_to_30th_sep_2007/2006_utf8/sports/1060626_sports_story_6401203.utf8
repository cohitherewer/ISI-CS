 India 362 all out

 - Laxman hits 100; WI opt not to enforce follow-on 

Basseterre: Fast bowlers Jerome Taylor and Corey Collymore shared six wickets to put the West Indies in control of the third Test against India on Sunday. 

V.V.S. Laxman scored his 10th century, a round 100, but that was not enough to stop India from being dismissed for 362 with the last ball before tea on the fourth day. 

At 2.15 am, the West Indies were 73 for two in their second innings. Daren Ganga was on 28 and Brian Lara on 17. Sreesanth took both the wickets, those of Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan. 

India were set a follow-on target of 382 when the West Indies totalled 581 in their first innings, but West Indian captain Brian Lara decided not to ask the visitors to bat again. 

The match seemed headed for a draw before Taylor took three quick wickets to reduce India to 159 for five in the fourth over of Sundays play. 

Taylor struck twice in three balls in his next over when he had a hesitant Yuvraj Singh caught behind by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin with an away swinger and dismissed Mohammed Kaif leg before with a delivery that seemed to be missing leg stump. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Laxman stabilised the innings with a solid partnership in which they made the most of the conditions. 

The stand reached 61 before Dhoni played across the line to a ball from Collymore in the sixth over before lunch and was trapped in front for 29. 

Anil Kumble and Laxman added 77 runs for the seventh wicket in a positive partnership that ended when Laxman prodded forward and away from his body at a delivery from left-arm fast bowler Pedro Collins. The patient Laxman faced 231 balls and hit 15 fours. 

Thoughts of the follow-on were relegated to the back burner by the defiant batting of Harbhajan Singh and Munaf Patel, who added 47 runs for the last wicket. 

They were separated when Patel, who scored 13, spooned a delivery from medium pacer Dwayne Bravo.

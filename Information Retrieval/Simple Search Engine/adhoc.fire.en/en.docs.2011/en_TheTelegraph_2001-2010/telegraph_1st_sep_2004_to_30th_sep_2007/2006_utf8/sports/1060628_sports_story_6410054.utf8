 Del Piero off to visit Pessotto

Duisburg: Italy players Alessandro Del Piero and Gianluca Zambrotta left the camp on Tuesday to visit Juventus team manager Gianluca Pessotto who is in a serious condition after falling from a window at the Serie A clubs headquarters. 

Pessotto, who played alongside Del Piero, Zambrotta and Fabio Cannavaro for Juventus last season, suffered multiple fractures but was in a stable condition, a medical bulletin released by the hospital said. A Turin hospital official said police were investigating a possible suicide attempt. (Reuters)

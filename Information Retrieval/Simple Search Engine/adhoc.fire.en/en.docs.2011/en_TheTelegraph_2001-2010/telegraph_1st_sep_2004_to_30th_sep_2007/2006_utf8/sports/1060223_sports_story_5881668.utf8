London: Benfica defender Luisao powered home a late header to give his side a 1-0 win over European champions Liverpool in the Champions League on Tuesday. 

The Portuguese champions, who had been ineffective all night, finally made the breakthrough in the first knockout round tie when the Brazilian met a Petit free kick after 84 minutes. 

Liverpool, who began with inspirational captain Steven Gerrard on the bench with a dead leg, had looked comfortable until Luisao got in front of Sami Hyypia to grab the winner. 

It was the first goal Liverpool had conceded in the competition since September but they will still be confident of turning the tie around at Anfield on March 8. 

I think this leg is still open, because the second game is more important than this one, Luisao said.We took a good step forward and were going united into the second game. 

The match started with a yellow card for Liverpools Spanish midfielder Luis Garcia after 30 seconds following a foul on Brazilian defender Leo but that was the main talking point in the early stages as the teams scoped each other out. 

The game was mostly restricted to a midfield stalemate in the first half, although a slip by Benfica goalkeeper Moretto and Luisao gave Liverpool striker Harry Kewell a chance in the 15th minute but his header went wide. 

Benfica captain Simao Sabrosa, who Liverpool tried to buy in December before the deal collapsed at the last minute, had a good chance to open the scoring but was denied by Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Manuel Reina in the 26th minute. 

Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler, playing alongside Fernando Morientes and making his first Champions League appearance since 2001, battled gamely but searched in vain for his first goal since returning to the club in the transfer window. 

In stoppage time at the end of the first period, Sabrosas free kick from outside the area just cleared the Liverpool bar. 

Benfica struggled to make any impression after the break and Liverpool brought on Gerrard for the ineffective Morientes with 12 minutes left as coach Rafael Benitez looked to his captain to help shore up the midfield in the closing stages. (REUTERS)

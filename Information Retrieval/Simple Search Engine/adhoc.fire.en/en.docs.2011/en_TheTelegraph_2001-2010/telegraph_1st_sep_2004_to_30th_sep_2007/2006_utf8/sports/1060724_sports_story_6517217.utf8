 Wayne Rooney parents 

home burgled

 Liverpool: Police were searching on Sunday 

 for thieves who broke into the house of the parents of England 

 star Wayne Rooney and stole soccer items including a 2006 

 World Cup shirt. 

Jewellery was also taken, as were England caps and the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year trophy from 2004. 

There are a number of distinctive items of footballing memorabilia that have been stolen from the house, police said in a statement. 

Police asked members of the public to be on the lookout in case they are offered such items for sale, either on the street or in pubs or see the items for sale on the internet. 

Rooney had a disappointing World Cup in Germany, being sent off in the quarter final against Portugal which England lost on penalties.

 Air India snatch a point off EB

 - Bhaichung now top-scorer with 11 

 Bhaichung got the equaliser 

Mumbai: A below-par East Bengal were lucky to escape with a 1-1 draw with local outfit Air India in their 10th National Football League match for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Sunday. 

The result was further setback for Philippe de Ridders side in their race for the title. 

The red and gold brigade are now provisionally leading the table with 28 points from 14 matches while Air India took their tally to 15 points from the same number of matches. 

Mahindra United, who beat East Bengal 1-0 via Yusif Yakubus penalty in the previous match, lie on 26 points, but they have now two games in hand. 

East Bengal now only hope that Mahindra falter in the upcoming Goa leg so that they can go atop the table again. 

East Bengal goalie Abhra Mondal was partly responsible for allowing Air India to take the lead in the 19th minute. He came out of his line to claim a right wing cross but Air Indias Vijith Shetty was quicker and smarter enough to nod the ball into the unprotected net. 

East Bengal netted the equaliser ten minutes later when captain Bhaichung Bhutia shot home from just outside the box after being fed by a long cross from Cameroonian Ndem Guy Herve. 

Bhaichung, thus, emerged as the top-scorer as he took his tally to 11, one ahead of Dempos Ranty Martins. 

Air India dominated much of the game and also came close to win had they taken advantage of some of the close chances that came their way, especially in the second-half. 

They hit the post as many as three times as East Bengal defence was found wanting in checking the waves of attacks from the other end. 

Abhra also came up with a couple of good saves to deny Air India. 

After the break, Ngassa Guy Martials header struck the horizontal. 

De Ridder introduced Alvito DCunha and Gouranga Dutta later on, but most of their runs were hampered by the uneven bounce of the pitch.

 Panesars Bhajji dream

London: Monty Panesar is keen to emulate Harbhajan Singh. 

Panesar, who made his debut during Englands tour of India, said he talked to Anil Kumble and Harbhajan after each game and found the Punjab off-spinner ready to help. 

They are both world-class spinners, of course, but Id like to get to the point Harbhajan has reached? he has enough variations in his armoury and you never know whats coming out, Panesar said. (PTI)

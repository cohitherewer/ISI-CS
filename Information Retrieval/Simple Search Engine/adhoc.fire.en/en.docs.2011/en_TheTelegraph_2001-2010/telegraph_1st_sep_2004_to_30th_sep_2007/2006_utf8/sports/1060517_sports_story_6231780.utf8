 Mates shocked at Morientes omission

Madrid: Spain players have expressed their surprise at the omission of Liverpool striker Fernando Morientes and Valencia midfielder Ruben Baraja from the squad for the World Cup. 

Its very strange, Barajas Valencia colleague David Albelda was quoted as saying in a Spanish daily on Tuesday. 

(Coach) Luis (Aragones) is the one who decides and he will have his reasons, but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth that Ruben wont be going because he deserves to go to this World Cup. 

Liverpool midfielder Luis Garcia expressed similar disappointment after Morientes was left out of the 23-man squad. 

Its a real shame for Morientes, because he is a great teammate and hes always ready to help the team. 

His omission means that Valencias David Villa, Atletico Madrids Fernando Torres and skipper Raul are the teams only out-and-out forwards. 

Fabregas, who will be pitted against Iniesta in Wednesdays Champions League final between Arsenal and Barcelona, said he was overjoyed at being included. 

It was the happiest news Ive ever received, said the 19-year-old Arsenal player. 

I didnt want to get my hopes up until it was made official ... It has been a marvellous year and Im sure Ill never forget it. 

There are still things to achieve, though. I think the best is still to come.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Weve set the example for others: Alam 

 Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Intikhab Alam has said he has no regrets about imposing the doping bans on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif that effectively ruled them out of the 2007 World Cup. 

We have set the example for others, Alam, a member of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) drug testing tribunal, told a website on Thursday. 

We didnt have any doubts in our minds about what we have announced. 

They admitted themselves that they had been taking dietary supplements. They are both adults and players have to be responsible for their own actions. Sometimes you have to take these decisions, the former Pakistan coach said. 

Its sad that it happened but now, since we have taken that decision, the youngsters coming up will be very, very careful. 

A PCB tribunal on Wednesday banned Shoaib for two years and fellow fast bowler Asif for one after they had tested positive for the steroid nandrolone. 

The pair was recalled from the Champions Trophy in India last month after the PCB received the results of the out-of-competition tests carried out in Pakistan before the tournament. 

The sanctions are effective from October 15, although Shoaib and Asif, who have both denied knowingly using banned substances, can appeal.

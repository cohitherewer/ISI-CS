 Sehwag rues missing out on record

Gros Islet: In his moment of triumph, Virender Sehwag, the hero of the opening days play of the second India-West Indies Test, also carries a sense of loss at missing out on a record ? reaching a century before the lunch break. 

I didnt know all those (impending) records, but I was aware that no Indian has ever scored a century before lunch, said Sehwag on the record he missed by a whisker. 

When I took the 99th run, I had gone too ahead to turn back and take advantage of the overthrow even while Wasim (Jaffer) kept calling me for the run, he explained. 

Sehwags 180 nevertheless is a staggering reminder that his last eight Test centuries have all been 150-plus scores. If he had batted for 20 more runs, this would have given him his third straight double century. 

On his slowing down after lunch, Sehwag put it down to the spreading outfield and defensive bowling. 

The wicket is slow, the outfield, too, is very slow. I felt if I could survive the first half an hour, I would go for my shots, he said. 

Sehwag acknowledged the role of a new adjustment in his methods and the part played by sports psychologist Dr Rudi Webster in achieving clarity of thought. (PTI)

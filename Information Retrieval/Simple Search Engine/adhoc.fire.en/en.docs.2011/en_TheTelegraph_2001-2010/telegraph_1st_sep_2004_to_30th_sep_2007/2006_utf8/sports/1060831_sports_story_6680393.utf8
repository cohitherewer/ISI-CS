 Players struggling to forget Oval Test

 - The boys have been under severe mental stress: Inzamam 

 Inzamam 

London: Pakistan skipper Inzamam-ul Haq claimed on Wednesday that umpire Darrell Hair was in big trouble due to his role during the forfeited Oval Test as well as the subsequent events that transpired. 

Darrell is in big trouble, I dont know why he is doing these things, Inzamam said, referring to the controversial match and the e-mails the Australian umpire sent to the ICC a few days later. 

He claimed Pakistan were ready to resume play after a delay following the tea break on the fourth day, and were prepared to take the field even on the final day of the match. 

I was quite happy to play the game after half an hour and then the next day because we had launched our protest. I dont know why he was not interested in playing, Inzamam said. 

The PCB has written to the ICC demanding an inquiry into Hairs conduct and asked that it be scrutinised before Inzamams disciplinary hearing for charges of ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute. 

Inzamam was confidence the hearing scheduled for the end of September would exonerate him. 

Im sure 100 per cent because I have done nothing. That is why I am doing these things, because I know we are not guilty and that is why we take this stance. 

Inzamam also said his players were struggling to put the controversial Oval Test behind them in the run-up to the one-day series versus England. 

The team has still not forgotten the incidents in The Oval Test. And the boys have been under severe mental stress for the last one week, Inzamam wrote in his column in a Pakistan daily on Wednesday. The fact is the pressure is there because our team has still not been cleared of ball-tampering charges. But the management has told the players to try to win the one-day series. 

It was difficult for me as a captain to motivate the boys to focus on even one-day games but the players have responded well so far. 

He said the win in the Twenty20 match in Bristol had boosted the players confidence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My job is to take wickets

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With two wickets from three matches, Bengals main spinner Sourashish Lahiri did not get the kind of start to the Ranji season which he had had in 2005-06. Against Maharashtra in their fourth match was no different, with the offie going wicketless in the first innings. 

Yet, he played a crucial role with the bat to help the hosts take a 110-run first innings lead. 

Ive been batting well But my job is to take wickets and help Bengal win, said the lanky spinner. 

Giving credit to coach Paras Mhambrey, he said: Paras has faith in me and keeps telling me that Ive the ability to bat its just Ive to apply myself.

 Vengsarkars request for 2-day tie 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Vengsarkar 

Johannesburg: Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar has requested Cricket South Africa to organise a two-day game in Durban, preferably on December 22-23, so that the Indians arent out of match practice for long. 

If the first Test ends tomorrow, the second will only be beginning on December 26... Thats too long a break, which is why this request has been made... After all, one cant keep having nets (in Durban), Vengsarkar told The Telegraph. 

He added: Also, Munaf Patel and Gautam Gambhir need to be given a game... Weve got to know about fitness and form... Patel had been injured, while Gambhir has come as a Test specialist. 

Incidentally, a delighted Vengsarkar singled out captain Rahul Dravid for special mention. His decision to bat was brave and bold... Full marks to Rahul, he said.

 Win for Aussies 

Adelaide: Sri Lankas hopes of replacing Australia at the head of the tri-series table were scuttled on Thursday but only after off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan gave the hosts a scare at the Adelaide Oval. 

The Australians eventually ground out an unspectacular five-wicket win, reaching 219 for five in 48.3 overs in reply to Sri Lankas 218 for eight. But Muralidharan sent a few late shudders through their camp when he grabbed two wickets in the 41st over.

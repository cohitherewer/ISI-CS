Miami: Maria Sharapova saved eight set-points before finally grinding out a 6-2, 7-6 third-round victory over Maria Elena Camerin at the Miami Masters on Sunday, but Martina Hingis battled to the finish before falling 6-3, 1-6, 6-7 to Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Hingis, a five-time Grand Slam champion coming off a three-year retirement, had beaten Kuznetsova in the Doha quarter final. 

Amelie Mauresmo made straightforward progress, defeating fellow-Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli for the third time with a 6-4, 6-0 win. 

Top seed Mauresmo now plays 14th-seeded Ana Ivanovic of Serbia and Montenegro, who beat Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. 

Sharapova, wearing a new black corset-look top, advanced despite making 38 unforced errors against the Italian ranked 79th. 

She faced a battle in the second set, trailing 1-4 before salvaging victory in an hour and 44 minutes with a backhand winner. 

She now faces fellow-Russian Maria Kirilenko, who defeated Viktoriya Kutuzova of the Ukraine 6-1, 6-4. 

I fought for it, I did a good job of fighting at the end, Sharapova said. When the days not great, when you feel like youre not playing your best tennis, I still know that I can fight it out. 

I didnt really feel great out there today. I started off well and things were going my way and all of a sudden I just made a lot of unforced errors, especially with the wind. 

In the mens draw, third seed David Nalbandian of Argentina fought back to defeat Czech Tomas Berdych 6-7, 6-1, 6-0 to reach the fourth round. 

Russian Nikolay Davydenko, seeded fifth, went through 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 against Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis, the Australian Open runner-up finishing the contest with two double-faults. 

Nalbandian won his fourth match out of five since returning from a month out with an abdominal injury suffered during the Davis Cup in February. 

The Argentine, who beat world No. 1 Roger Federer in the final of the Masters Cup last November, improved his record this season to 10-2 after 20-year-old Berdychs game fell apart in the second and third sets. Nalbandian, an Australian Open semi-finalist this year, broke his opponents serve five times. 

Croatian Mario Ancic advanced with a 7-6, 6-7, 6-2 triumph over Florent Serra of France. Czech Radek Stepanek, the 15th seed, defeated Nicolas Massu of Chile 6-7 7-6 7-5. 

Sania-Ana advances 

Sania Mirza, meanwhile, advanced to the second round of the womens doubles on Sunday. The 19-year old Indian and Ana Ivanovic of Serbia defeated Italians Maria Elena Camerin and Tathiana Garbin 6-3, 6-4. They next play Kveta Peschke of Czech Republic and Italys Francesca Schiavone. (Agencies)

 PCB sets up panel to hear appeals 

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board has constituted a new three-member panel to hear the appeals of fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif against their doping ban. 

The panel will be headed by Justice Fakhruddin Ibrahim and include former Test cricketer Hasib Ahsan and a doctor, who is to be named later, PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf said. 

The new committee will announce its verdict within seven days of hearing the appeals of the bowlers, who were banned by a Pakistan Cricket Board-appointed drug tribunal, headed by barrister Shahid Hamid. 

The three-member tribunal had banned Shoaib for three years and Asif for one year. While both are out of the World Cup, theres a question mark over Shoaib ever again playing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Star may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Star Special, Flemenco Star and Ecstatic Pride, all three horses are capable of winning the 1,400m Real Danger Handicap, Wednesdays main event. 

 Although Star Special was a total flop in the monsoon Derby, the Major Impact-daughter may be a big factor in the open Class III race. Ecstatic Pride, however, looks under done.

 Flemenco Star, on the other hand, is looking to be a transformed horse with the aid of blinker. His morning workouts also suggest that the Vijay Singh-trained colt is more at home over the slated trip. C. Alford partners the three-year-old.

 The two trophy events for the lower classes, may also produce close contests. But Dancing Vision could lift the 1,600m String Of Pearls Cup while Indigo and Ganga Bose may again fight for honours in the Liberty Cup over 1,400 metres.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Shoaib pleads innocence

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Shoaib Akhtar denied knowingly taking any performance-enhancing drugs after testing positive for nandrolone. 

I want to assure everyone that I am innocent of doing anything I shouldnt have, Shoaib was quoted as saying in bigstarcricket.com. 

All I can say at this stage is that I have not knowingly taken any performance-enhancing drugs and would never cheat my teammates or opponents in this way. 

I have always played the game fair and I give 100 per cent and do not feel that I need to take drugs to help my bowling. I am gutted to be missing the Champions Trophy and I will return to Pakistan to see what has happened and what needs to be done, he said.

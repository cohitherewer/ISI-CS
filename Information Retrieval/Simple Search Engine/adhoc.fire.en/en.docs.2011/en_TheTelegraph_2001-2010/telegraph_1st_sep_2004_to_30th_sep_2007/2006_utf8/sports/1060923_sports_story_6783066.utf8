 Gangjee keeps hopes alive

 Korea open

 Seoul: Rahil Gangjee kept 

 the Indian challenge alive on the second day of the $700,000 

 Kolon Hana Bank Korea Open with a second successive round 

 of one-under 70.

 The Indian now aggregates two-under 

 for 26 holes and in tied 27th place at the midway stage. 

 Koreas Kim Ji-Man shot an eight-under 63 to take lead.

 Amandeep Johl had three birdies, 

 but those did not help as his five bogeys dragged him down 

 to a 75 and he missed the cut. 

 Retief Goosen of South Africa 

 failed to build on Thursdays 65 as he slumped to a 

 72 and will enter the weekend rounds seven shots behind 

 the leader.

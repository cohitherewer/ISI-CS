 Italy wary of US threat

Duisburg: Italy, defeated by unfancied opponents in recent major tournaments, know they must not underestimate the United States in Kaiserslautern on Saturday. 

The Italians won their opening Group E game against Ghana 2-0 while Bruce Arenas Americans suffered a 0-3 loss to Czech Republic in their first outing at these finals. 

We cant undervalue the importance of this game, said Italy forward Alberto Gilardino. For the United States it will be the game of their lives given that they lost their opening match against the Czechs and they know that if they mess up again they will be out. 

From our point of view, we have to be focused and very solid in order to get another three points. They are a team that like to keep possession, but we have the quality to put them in difficulty, said the AC Milan striker. 

The only change Italy coach Marcello Lippi is expected to make will be to bring in fit-again defender Gianluca Zambrotta at right back in place of Cristian Zaccardo. 

PROBABLE TEAMS 

Italy: 1-Gianluigi Buffon; 19-Gianluca Zambrotta, 13-Alessandro Nesta, 5-Fabio Cannavaro, 3-Fabio Grosso; 4-Daniele De Rossi, 21-Andrea Pirlo, 20-Simone Perrotta; 10-Francesco Totti; 9-Luca Toni, 11-Alberto Gilardino. 

United States: 18-Kasey Keller; 7-Eddie Lewis, 22-Oguchi Onyewu, 23-Eddie Pope, 6-Steve Cherundolo; 15-Bobby Convey, 10-Claudio Reyna, 4-Pablo Mastroeni, 17-DaMarcus Beasley; 21-Landon Donovan, 20-Brian McBride. (Agencies)

 Withholding of grants ratified

 - No date set for disciplinary committee meeting on Dalmiya issue Volte-face on twenty20 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is sticking to its hard stand against former president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

At the working committee meeting here on Sunday, the finance committees decision to withhold subsidies and grants to the CAB, and to debit Rs 46.5 crore for its presidents alleged failure to submit transaction details of the associations account with Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipore branch were ratified. 

The working committee also decided to refer the matter to the disciplinary committee for appropriate action. 

It seems that the powers-that-be had come determined to get the decisions ratified and were in no mood to pay heed to any objection. While CAB representative Chitrak Mitra was unavailable for comment, it is learnt that he did raise a few uncomfortable questions but was unable to breach the wall. 

Addressing a press conference after the meeting, BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan said: Two showcause notices were served on Dalmiya. While one was replied, the other was not. Now the working committee has decided to refer it to the disciplinary committee, who will take a decision to this effect. 

Srinivasan, however, refused to set a date for the disciplinary committee meeting, saying that BCCI president Sharad Pawar will decide on it. 

Even as subsidies to the CAB remained withheld, the working committee was generous in increasing grants to other state associations for development of infrastructure. 

After discussing it at the working committee, we have decided to increase it from Rs 10 to Rs 25 crore, Srinivasan said. 

While the working committee remained firm on its anti-Dalmiya stand, it made a complete volte face on the earlier stand of playing Twenty20 cricket. 

Srinivasan said the BCCI has decided to introduce it at the domestic level and even participate in the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 in South Africa. 

Admitting that it was a complete change from its earlier decision, Srinivasan said: True we were against playing it, but at the ICC meeting the BCCI did not get any support from the rest of the members. So we decided to take part. 

A domestic Twenty20 tournament will be held next April, he informed. 

Incidentally, it may be noted that the BCCI, during the joint submission to host the 2011 World Cup, had given an undertaking to the ICC to take part in the second edition of the Twenty20 World Cup in 2009. 

The other major decisions were: 

 In keeping with 

 the decision to merge womens cricket association with 

 the BCCI, it has been decided to provide financial support 

 to the women teams tour of England in July-August. 

 Subhangi Kulkarni has been named by the ICC to look after 

 womens cricket affairs in Asia. 

 Pension 

 for ex-cricketers have been increased ? Rs 10,000 per month 

 for those who played between 25-49 matches; Rs 15,000 per

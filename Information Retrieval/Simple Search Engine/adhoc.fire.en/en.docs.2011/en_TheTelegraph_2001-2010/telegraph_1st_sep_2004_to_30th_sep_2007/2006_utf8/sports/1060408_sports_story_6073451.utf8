 Vijai takes one-stroke lead

 DAMON HACK

 Vijai Singh in Augusta on Thursday 

Augusta: For the first time in five years, the Augusta National Golf Club played like the giant pool table it is known for, sending golf balls speeding over greens and leaving golfers to hit and hope. 

With no weather delay in the first round of the Masters for the first time in several years, Tiger Woods said he felt like he had walked onto the set of a US Open, as dry and as fast as Augusta National played on Thursday. 

The best anyone could muster was Vijai Singhs five-under-par 67, and he would have been just as happy to keep that fact to himself. 

Better not say that too loud, Singh said of his big drives that led to his low score. Maybe they will move it back 50 yards next year. 

On a golf course stretched to 7,445 yards ? the second-longest in Major championship history ? Singh led Rocco Mediate (68) by one stroke and the Masters rookie Arron Oberholser (69) by two. A group of four golfers, including Phil Mickelson and Retief Goosen, muscled out scores of 70, and 54-year-old Ben Crenshaw shot 71, along with 10 others. 

Woods carded an even-par 72 beneath the warm sunshine, rolling in a 35-foot birdie putt on the last hole that saved him from an over-par round. He said he thought he played well despite trailing Singh by five shots. The golf course is playing really difficult, Woods said in a refrain heard around Augusta National. 

Woods, at least, enjoyed one magical hole. 

From the fairway of No. 14th, he hit an eight-iron from 163 yards that dropped into the cup for an eagle. 

When he walked up to the cup, he retrieved his ball, brought it to his lips and kissed it. 

On the next hole, though, after his ball landed in a divot on the fairway, Woods dumped it into the pond fronting the green and made a double bogey. 

After months of speculation that the leaderboard at the Masters would only hold the names of big hitters like Singh and bigger hitters like Woods, a potpourri of styles made strong impressions. 

The 43-year-old Mediate, an average-length hitter who does Pilates for a bad back, topped the leaderboard for most of the day until Singh caught and passed him on Thursday afternoon. Mediate had 10 straight pars before pouring in birdies on four of his last eight holes. 

In the drier conditions, with tee shots rolling out, Mediate said he could compete with the bombers of the PGA Tour. He also said he did not worry about where his ball lands relative to those who outdrive him. 

I just said this to Tiger yesterday, Mediate said. I said I dont understand the complaining about Tiger hitting a seven-iron, and Im hitting a four-iron. Hes a million times stronger than me, and hits it 50 yards further. Whats wrong with that? The strong ones are always going to be the longest guys. Thats just how it is. I dont have a problem with that. 

It was difficult for any of the PGA Tour players to complain about the course when Crenshaw, who plays on the 50-and-over Champions Tour, shot a one-under-par round. 

I felt I had a few miracles out here happen, said Crenshaw, a two-time Masters champion. I have to chip and putt here. Thats the only way I can get around. 

He got around fine. His score was nine shots better than Charles Howell III, who shot 80, and 13 shots better than David Duval, who shot 84.

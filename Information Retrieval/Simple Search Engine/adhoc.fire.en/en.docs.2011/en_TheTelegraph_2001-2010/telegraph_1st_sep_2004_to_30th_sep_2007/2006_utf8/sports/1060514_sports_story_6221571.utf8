 Sorenstam fails to qualify

New York: Annika Sorenstam missed the halfway cut for the first time in four years at the Michelob Ultra Open in Williamsburg, Virginia on Friday. The Swedish world No. 1 battled to a second successive two-over-par 73 on the Kingsmill River Course before ending the day in tied 72nd place. 

I was hoping it was going to turn around, I really was, Sorenstam said after falling one stroke short of qualifying. 

But then it just kept on going the way its been going for a while. Obviously Im very disappointed, added the Swede, whose last missed cut came at the 2002 Womens British Open.

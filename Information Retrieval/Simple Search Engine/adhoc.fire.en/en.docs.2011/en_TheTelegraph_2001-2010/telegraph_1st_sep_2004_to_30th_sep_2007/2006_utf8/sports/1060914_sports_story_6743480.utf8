 Cant have any fear of losing Ashes: Flintoff

 Flintoff

London: Andrew Flintoff has insisted that England would tide over the crises resulting from injury doubts over several players, including himself, and retain the Ashes in Australia. 

England, who last won a Test series on Australian soil 20 years ago, will be without last years Ashes-winning captain Michael Vaughan and reverse-swing ace Simon Jones owing to knee injuries. They also have fitness doubts over six members in their 16-man squad. 

Having experienced the emotion of the Ashes last summer, the carrot thats been dangled in front of us is huge, said Flintoff, who has been chosen to lead England Down Under. Weve got to go over there with confidence we cant have any fear of losing the Ashes or giving them back. We have to go out there and play as we did last summer, probably even better. 

Flintoff, who has not played for England since the end of the Sri Lanka Test series in June, saw off competition from successor Andrew Strauss for the leadership, with the 28-year-old Lancashire stars all-round gifts the decisive factor. 

During last years Ashes, Flintoff was the dominant figure with 402 runs and 24 wickets, his aggressive batting and fiery pace bowling winning the respect of Englands oldest foes. 

It was his ability to bat, bowl and field and lead from the front, explained chairman of selectors David Graveney. The Australians fear him like they fear quite a lot of our players. 

Flintoff said Strauss who led England to a Test series victory over Pakistan and the subsequent drawn one-day series against Inzamam-ul Haqs side would be one of his key advisors. 

I was very proud and excited when I was told, but Andrew Strauss has done a fantastic job over the last couple of months against Pakistan. 

Hes going to be someone thats going to be very important for myself in India and Australia, said Flintoff. 

From doing the job earlier this summer Ive learnt a few things and I probably wont be bowling 51 overs in an innings again like I did at Lords (against Sri Lanka, in May), but from the bowling point of view the situation of the game will dictate when I bowl.

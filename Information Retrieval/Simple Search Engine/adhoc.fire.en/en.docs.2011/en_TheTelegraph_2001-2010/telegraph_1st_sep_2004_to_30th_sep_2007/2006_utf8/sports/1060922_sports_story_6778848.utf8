 Hair should stand: Ponting

While Indian captain Rahul Dravid declined to comment on controversial umpire Darrell Hair, Australias Ricky Ponting did. Heres what he said Thursday: 

If he (Hair) is one of the best umpires, then he should officiate in the Champions Trophy... Theres been a bit happening over the past month, but it will be good for him to get back (to umpiring)... Of course, I dont know what kind of reception hes going to get in India... I dont have to decide and whichever way it goes, Im sure the ICC will get it right...

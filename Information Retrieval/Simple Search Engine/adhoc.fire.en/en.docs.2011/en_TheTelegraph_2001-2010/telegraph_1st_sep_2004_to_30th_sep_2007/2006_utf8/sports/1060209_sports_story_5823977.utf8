Islamabad: The city reminds Greg Chappell of Canberra or even Melbourne. The parks, the greenery, the roads and the buildings are all so similar, he says. 

It was a little past one in the afternoon and the Indian coach, accompanied by wife Judith, waited at the Marriott lobby for the players to assemble before leaving for lunch at Imran Khans. It was another day off for the Indian cricketers before getting down to serious business ahead of the second match of the one-day series. 

The day began for Chappell and a few others ? Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Suresh Raina and members of the support staff ? with a round of golf at the Islamabad Golf Club. A great form of relaxation? a nice way to unwind, Chappell told The Telegraph. 

He, however, did not forget to mention that the mood in the camp was positive and that they were looking to forget the past and focus on a new beginning here. 

Though the entire team was invited by Imran, some of the players didnt go. Besides Chappell, those who attended Imrans lunch were manager Raj Singh Dungarpur, Sachin, Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Mohammed Kaif and Zaheer Khan. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq and his family was also invited. 

The World Cup-winning former Pakistan captain passed on some tips to Zaheer, especially on the use of his non-bowling arm while delivering the ball. He also praised Sachin for his hundred in Peshawar and felt said the time had not yet come to write him off. 

The Indians had wanted to visit Murree (known as the Queen of Hills), an hour-and-a-half drive from the Pakistan capital. But security concerns, because of Muharram, led to that plan being shelved. 

Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Gautam Gambhir spent the morning at Panjasaheb Gurdwara in Hasanabad. I enjoy visiting new places and exploring the cultural heritage there. Very few people get the opportunity to visit here? Im lucky. Maine aman ke liye dua ki, team ke liye bhi, the off-spinner said. 

Off-spinner Ramesh Powar joined the squad as the 16th member late on Wednesday night. 

Security concerns will also force the Indians to wind off their first practice session here on Thursday by 11 am. A few of the Pakistan players did opt for optional practice in Rawalpindi on Wednesday morning.

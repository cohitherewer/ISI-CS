London: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars four wickets steered Pakistan to a seven-wicket win against England in the second one-day International at Lords on Saturday. 

Shoaib struck at the start and end of England innings to claim four for 28 off eight overs as the hosts were dismissed for 166. 

Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf then put on a third-wicket stand of 78 to help Pakistan reach 169 for three with 20 balls to spare. The visitors now lead the five-match series 1-0, stretching Englands losing streak to nine matches against Test-playing nations. 

Wednesdays rain-abandoned first match at Sophia Gardens in Wales was preceded by a Twenty20 defeat to Pakistan. England were also beaten 0-5 by Sri Lanka earlier in the season in the 50-over format, and lost the final game of a 1-5 series defeat to India in April. 

In fact, England havent won a limited-over series since beating Zimbabwe in December 2004. They have just won eight one-day matches against Test-playing nations since then, losing 20 and tying three, with three no-results. 

Pakistan captain Inzaman-ul-Haq won the toss and England had to bat first under heavy cloud cover and on a seaming pitch to face the visitors full-strength bowling attack. 

Captain Andrew Strauss was out for a golden duck, caught by wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off the sixth ball of the day from Shoaib to leave England 1 for 1. 

A 90-minute rain delay meant the match was reduced to 46 overs per side. A second shower further cut it to 40 overs and forced England to accelerate the run-rate. But Shoaibs steep bounce, exaggerated leg cutters, and subtle changes of pace made life difficult in perfect bowling conditions. 

Mohammed Asif was even more difficult for batsmen at the other end. Marcus Trescothick, on 6 off some 26 balls, was caught by Younis Khan at second slip off Asif to leave England at 18 for two. 

England needed early wickets and Lewis who replaced Sajid Mahmood in the only change by either team from the first match was quick to oblige. He enticed Mohammed Hafeez on one to offer a catch to wicketkeeper Read, leaving Pakistan nine for 1. Shoaib Malik put on 21 with Younis before he was also caught by Read off Lewis for 10. 

With such a modest target to chase, Younis and Yousuf were prepared to defend against Lewis who bowled four maidens in taking two for 11 off his eight overs and plunder the other bowlers. 

Younis hit nine fours from 89 balls before he lifted a delivery from Clarke to be caught by Pietersen for 55 in the 28th over. 

But Yousuf, who hit three fours in his unbeaten 81-ball innings of 49, and Inzamam (42 not out) took Pakistan to victory. The third match is at Southampton on Tuesday. (AP)

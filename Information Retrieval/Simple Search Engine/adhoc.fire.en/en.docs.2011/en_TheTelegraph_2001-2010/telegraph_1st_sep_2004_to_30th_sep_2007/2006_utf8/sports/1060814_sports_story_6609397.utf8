 Chambers helps Britain to 4x100 gold

Gothenburg: Dwain Chambers returned to Britains 4x100 m on Sunday and helped them win the gold they were stripped of four years ago because of his doping. Chambers ran the first leg and the foursome won in 38.91 seconds, ahead of Poland and France. 

Anchored by Chambers, Britain won the race in 2002 in Munich, but had to surrender the title to Ukraine because of Chambers doping. Chambers was also stripped of the 100m title he won in Munich. 

Darren Campbell, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis completed the team. Chambers tested positive for THG in November 2003. 

Earlier, Olympic champion Stefano Baldini of Italy regained the marathon title. Baldini covered the distance in 2::11:32 seconds to take the title he had first won in 1998. 

Viktor Roethlin gave Switzerland their first marathon medal when he took the silver 2:11:50. Julio Rey of Spain was third in 2:12:50. 

In the mens 800, Bram Som of the Netherlands surged from the inside lane to win in 1:46.56. David Fiegen gave Luxembourg their first medal in the history of the championships by taking silver in 1:46.59, while bronze went to Sam Ellis of Britain in 1:46.64. 

The womens 4x100m gold medal went to Russia in 42.71 seconds. Britain took the silver in 43.51 and Belarus was third in 43.61.

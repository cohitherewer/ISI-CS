 Sandipan holds Short to draw

 - GIBRALTAR CHESS 

 Sandipan 

Gibraltar: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda put up stiff resistance and held former world championship finalist and second seed Nigel Short to a draw in the third round of the Gibtele.Com Masters Chess Tournament here at Caleta Hotel. 

None of the seven overnight leaders could force matters in the third round and the lead is now shared by as many as 18 players including top seed Alexei Shirov of Spain, Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland and Emil Sutovsky of Israel. 

The 13-member Indian contingent had an excellent day with national champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly recovering in the event against Mehdi Mohamed of Morocco. In the second round on Thursday, Surya had suffered a shock defeat at the hands of International Master Mohamad al-Sayed of Qatar. 

Also coming out with flying colours was GM Tejas Bakre, IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and S. Kidambi who all cruised to victory against Richard Cannon, Norman Hutchinson and Mikael Helin, respectively. Former British champion Abhijit Kunte was held to a draw by Swede Anton Aaberg. 

On Thursday, Saptarshi was the lone winner among Indian men, who scored a convincing victory over Willem-Jan Pannekoek of Holland. 

Among women, Anupama Gokhale beat Martyn Hamer of England, Mary Ann Gomes who had it easy against Inna Agrest of Sweden, Bhagyashree Thipsay outwitted Spanish Antonia Baena and Nimmy George who outclassed Gary Quillan, also of England. 

Swati Ghate defeated Carame Francisco Gonzales of Spain while Nisha Mohota signed peace with Margarid Coimbra of Protugal. 

It was a Sicilian defense game wherein Short went for the blood right from the early stages of the middle game by offering a knight sacrifice. Sandipan declined the offer and found an exchange sacrifice to stay in the game. (PTI)

 More hints at changes to ODI side

London: The Indian selectors might ring in a few changes in the side for the tri-series in Sri Lanka in order to take their opponents by surprise, selection committee chairman Kiran More has indicated. 

Fringe players of the India A team could be a good choice for us, provided age is on their side. After all, experimentation can surprise the other team, More said on a radio channel. 

The Indian squad for the August 14 to 29 one-day competition, which also involves South Africa, would be announced on Thursday in Mumbai. 

The former India wicketkeeper said India needed more pace bowlers given the amount of cricket that was being played. We should have at least seven to eight such bowlers ready to play. With 40-50 one-dayers and quite a few Tests every year, its important to have enough genuine fast bowlers. This will help us rotate them properly, he said.

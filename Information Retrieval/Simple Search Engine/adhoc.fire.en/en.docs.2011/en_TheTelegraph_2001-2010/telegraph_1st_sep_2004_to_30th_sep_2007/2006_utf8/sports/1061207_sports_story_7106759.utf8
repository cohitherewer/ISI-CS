 East Bengal hoping for a turnaround

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira believes the residential camp in Kalyani has been a much-needed boost and will sure enhance his teams chances in the IFA Shield. 

Pereira has been under pressure following East Bengals early exit from Durand Cup. The Brazilian, however, insisted on Wednesday the eve of East Bengals IFA Shield opener against Sporting Clube de Goa that the team would bounce back. 

The IRTC of Christiano is yet to arrive, so hes unavailable for the match while another Brazilian Daniel is down with a stomach bug. However, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, who signed for the red-and-gold brigade a couple of days ago, after initially deciding to play for Mohammedan Sporting, is set to start in the midfield with captain Alvito DCunha. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma described the rivals as a team who can do anything any time. 

Meanwhile, Shenzen FC, the first Chinese side to play in the Shield, arrived in the city on Wednesday. The 17-member squad doesnt have any foreigner but includes six players who represented China in various age-group nationals. 

Shenzen finished 11th in the Chinese Premier League. 

This is not our first team. Many of our key players are either injured or have asked for rest after the gruelling league got over., coach Chan Chui told reporters .

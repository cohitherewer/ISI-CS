 Madrid: Italy striker Antonio Cassano said he was anxious to shed his bad-boy image after completing his transfer from AS Roma to Real Madrid on Wednesday. ?Everyone has labelled me as a difficult character, but I want to show them that I?m not like that,? the 23-year-old told a news conference at the Bernabeu following his 5.5 million euros ($6.64 million) move to Spain.

 ?I?m here to change and improve as a person and a player.? Cassano, who was embroiled in a dispute with former club Roma over his contract which was due to expire at the end of the season, recognised he had made mistakes in the past.

 ?Who hasn?t made mistakes? I certainly have and I?ve paid dearly for them,? he said.

 London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho believes Ghana midfielder Michael Essien will miss this month?s African Nations Cup because of injury. Essien was carried off the field on a stretcher after hurting his ankle in a challenge with Nigel Reo-Coker during Monday?s 3-1 Premier League win at West Ham United.

 The former Olympique Lyon player had a scan on his ankle on Tuesday and is likely to need another when the swelling has gone down, said Chelsea on their official website.

 ?Essien I think is not going (to the Nations Cup),? Mourinho told the website. ?To have treatment, it is better to stay with Chelsea. He would be going for nothing.?

 Milan: Lazio striker Paolo Di Canio has promised to stop displaying the fascist salute to his supporters. Di Canio, who has twice been fined for the straight-arm gesture, told a radio station in Rome he would cease his ?Roman salute? to the fans in order to protect the club. ?During the Christmas break I have had time to reflect and I have decided to put the good of Lazio before my interests,? said the former West Ham United striker. ?For the moment I will avoid certain displays in public, situations which are so devilish for some people,? he said.

 ?But I will continue my battle for liberty in other ways, with he help of the lawyers who assist me,? said Di Canio.

 Berlin: Assistant trainer Mirko Slomka has taken over from Ralf Rangnick as head coach at Schalke 04, the Bundesliga club said on Wednesday. Schalke dismissed Rangnick last month three days after the coach announced he would be leaving the club at the end of the season.

 Slomka, who has been with Schalke since October 2004, will initially coach the club until the end of the season, Schalke said on their website on Wednesday.

 London: Twice world steeplechase champion Saif Saa-eed Shaheen will compete in the Edinburgh cross-country on Jan. 14 during a winter campaign which may include an appearance at the Moscow world indoor championships.

 London: Road safety will be the winner when Brazilian Rubens Barrichello makes his Honda Formula One debut in Jerez next week.

 ?I am starting to drive a little bit too fast on the roads now so I am definitely missing a racing car,? the ex-Ferrari driver told his new team?s website on Wednesday before the first test in Spain.

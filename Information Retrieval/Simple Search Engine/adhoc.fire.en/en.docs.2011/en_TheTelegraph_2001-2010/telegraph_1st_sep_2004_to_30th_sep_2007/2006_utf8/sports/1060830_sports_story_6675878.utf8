Calcutta: Former Olympian Ashok Kumar is holding the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) responsible for the current state of affairs of the sport in the country. 

The IHF being the parent body has to take the blame. They have failed to promote hockey at the grassroots level. Were not concentrating enough at the domestic level, the former hockey star said on Tuesday. He was in the city to attend the 101st birth anniversary celebrations of his father Dhyanchand. The day also marked the annual prize distribution of Bengal Hockey Association (BHA). 

Where does he place India on the international stage? Of late we have lost in all the big events. There is very little to show. It all depends on how we perform in the forthcoming World Cup. If we fail again, our performance will nosedive further, Kumar remarked. 

He is also not in favour of foreign coaches. Foreign coaches cannot get accustomed to our culture. Likewise, we can never match the speed, power and strength of the Europeans. Our emphasis should be on skill, which has always been our strong point. 

Foreign specialists can help us to improve in converting penalty corners and scoring from other dead ball situations. But we can never sacrifice skill to match the Europeans. A skilful forwardline can still put powerplay to shame, he explained. 

The frequent sacking of coaches has also left Kumar disappointed. In the last five years we must have had at least 16 national coaches! This change of coaches has only left the players puzzled. Give a coach a longer run, say at least for a couple of years. 

Other former Olympians who were present included BHA secretary Gurbux Singh, Keshav Dutt, Jaswant Rajput and Bir Bahadur Chhetri.

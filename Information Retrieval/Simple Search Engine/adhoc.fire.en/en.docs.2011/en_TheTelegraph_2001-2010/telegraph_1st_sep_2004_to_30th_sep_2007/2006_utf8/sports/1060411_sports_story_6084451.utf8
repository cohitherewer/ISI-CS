The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IWF moots contract for lifters

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The executive committee 

 of the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWF), which met 

 here on Sunday, has drafted a proposal to bring lifters 

 under contracts in future to curb the dope menace, but has 

 surprisingly decided to give a clean chit to the coaches.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, 

 IWF secretary Balbir Bhatia said: There is a proposal 

 to make all weightlifters sign a contract with the federation 

 before any international meet. If any lifter tests positive, 

 then that particular lifter will be liable to pay back the 

 money spent by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and the 

 IWF for his or her training and other expenses. This is 

 still a proposal and will be placed in the general body 

 meeting for final approval. 

When asked whether the coaches too would be brought under such contract, Bhatia said no such proposal has been tabled. This is a new idea and we will certainly consider it next time, was his reply. 

The IWF secretary refused to agree that coaches, too, are involved in most of the doping scandals. He said he has no idea that SAI coach GD Fortgalland had refused to work with tainted coaches and left the national camp last year. He even tried to defend the coaches. 

You have been talking about coaches like Hansa Sharma and Pal Singh Sandhu, who according to the media, are responsible for doping the lifters, Bhatia countered. But you tend to forget that these two coaches have produced a host of top lifters who have made the country proud. Show me one leading coach in India whose students have not been found guilty for doping offences. 

 The IWF is confident that the International Weightlifting 

 Federation will not suspend India for more than two years 

 when it sits down to take a decision in May.

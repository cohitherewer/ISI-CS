 Bengal among eight teams disqualified

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Eight state teams, including Bengal, have been disqualified from the under-13 Football Festival organised by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) for registering overage players, according to federation sources. 

The festival will start at the Velammal International School, 35 km from Chennai, from Saturday. The Bengal team, coached by former international Chinmoy Chatterjee, will return to Calcutta on Saturday. 

Bengal players now will not be eligible for selection for the Indian team in the Asian under-13 Festival to be played in Dhaka from May 3 to 8. 

An official of the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TNFA) said that any team, who had registered three or more overage players, has been disqualified. 

While Bengal were found guilty of having four overage footballers in their team, Mizoram had nine players who were found between 16 and 19 years after the medical test. The age verification was done by an independent medical commission appointed by the AIFF. 

The Bengal footballers were sent to the medical commission twice, yet they failed to pass the test. We had no option but to send back Bengal, said an organising committee official. 

The other states who have been disqualified are: Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Orissa, Mizoram, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. A total of 70 footballers have been found overage, the official said. Sixteen states are left in the fray.

 Matthaeus wants Germany job

Berlin: Lothar Matthaeus said on Wednesday that he hopes to follow in the footsteps of his mentor Franz Beckenbauer and coach Germany, although for now he is looking no further than club management. 

In an interview, Germanys most capped player, who captained the West Germany team under Beckenbauer which won the 1990 World Cup, also said he was honoured to be the patron of a new honour at this years finals, the Gillette Young Player award. 

Yes, obviously it would be great to get the chance to coach Germany one day, said Matthaeus. 

However Matthaeus said he could never duplicate the achievements of the man known as the Kaiser. 

I couldnt begin to compare myself to Franz Beckenbauer, Matthaeus, 45, said in a telephone interview. Hes so far above all of us. But we do have some things in common and have remained close friends. 

Matthaeus, who will work as a television analyst during the World Cup, said he expects to coach again after the tournament. He said there had been some knocking on the door but no concrete offers yet.

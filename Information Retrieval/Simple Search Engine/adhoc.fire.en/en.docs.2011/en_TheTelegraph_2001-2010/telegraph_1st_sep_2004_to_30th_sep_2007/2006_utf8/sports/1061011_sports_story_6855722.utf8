 5-stroke lead for Simi

New Delhi: Simi Mehra Guffin remained consistent and played three over to keep a five stroke lead on Day II of the first leg of the DLF Womens Golf Tour at the Qutab Golf Course here. 

The second spot was shared by Shalini Malik and Mumbai golfer Sanam Merchant. 

Simi was two-under after the first two holes but went on to bogey the 6th hole where she missed a two-foot putt. The 9th was another disappointment as she got a bad kick in spite of a good drive. 

The bad luck stayed as she got dehydrated on the 12th hole and she almost did not continue but stuck on to turn in the leader card of 75. 

Round II scores 

Simi Mehra 150, Nonita L. Qureshi 162, Shalini Malik 163, Sanam Merchant 166, Parnita Garewal 168, Preet Inder Kaur 170, Mina Johl 177. (PTI)

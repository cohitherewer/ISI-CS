 Bat withdrawn

London: The graphite bat of the kind used by Australia captain Ricky Ponting has been withdrawn from international cricket by its manufacturer, the ICC said on Thursday. 

Australian manufacturer Kookaburra agreed to withdraw the product after the ICC received advice from the Marylebone Cricket Club that the bat contravened Law 6 of the games rules. (Reuters)

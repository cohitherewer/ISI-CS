The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Only seven at Bengal practice

 - Santosh trophy

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Bengals preparations for the Santosh Trophy main round have not yet begun in right earnest. Seven players turned up for practice at Bidhannagar Municipality ground on Tuesday. A day earlier, coach Prasanta Banerjee worled with just five players. 

The IFA intends reinforcing the squad with players from East Bengal, Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting, but the clubs have put their foot down. No player from the big three was present on either of the days.

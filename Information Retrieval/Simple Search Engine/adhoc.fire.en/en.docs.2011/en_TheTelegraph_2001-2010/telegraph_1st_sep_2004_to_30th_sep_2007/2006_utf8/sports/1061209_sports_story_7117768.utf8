 Azhar: Sourav knows his game

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Post his 83-run knock, Mohammed Azharuddin and Barry Richards, on Friday, were all praise for Sourav Ganguly. 

Welcoming the decision to bring back the former skipper, Azharuddin said: Its good to see Sourav back. With Yuvraj (Singh) not there in the team his selection is justified. 

However, the former skipper felt that the Indian team should let Sourav play his natural game. He is an experienced player and he very well knows his game. 

South African great Richards, too, chipped in along the same lines: The team was missing Yuvraj badly. Now, its good that the selectors roped in Sourav.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF treatment shocks youngster

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Still seven months from celebrating her 17th birthday, Asteffi DCosta has already made up her mind about not trying to don national colours again. For the young schoolgirl from Goa, to make an effort to play for India is not a pleasure, but a mental torture, not only for her but also for her family. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa, Asteffi said: After what I went through at the U-19 national camp at Calcutta recently, I dont think I will ever attend another camp. In fact, my father will not allow me even if I am called again. 

According to Asteffi ? who was called for the selection camp of the Asian Womens Championship and was subsequently dropped ? she was left in the lurch by the irresponsible staff of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) office in Calcutta and was asked to travel back alone, which is in gross violation of the federation rules. The AIFF has made it mandatory that minors, especially girls, should receive to and fro escorts while attending national camps. 

Last Sunday, I was dropped and was handed over a train ticket from Calcutta to Mumbai and was asked to go alone, said Asteffi. They did not even give me a ticket for the Mumbai-Goa sector. Instead Rs 300 was thrust into my hands and I was told to buy a ticket at Mumbai. 

The Goan girl said she was simply terrified by the attitude of the camp officials. I had never travelled alone, leave alone buying a ticket at Mumbai. At that point, I called up my parents, who contacted the Goa Football Association. Finally, GFA arranged for an air ticket for me so that I could reach safely. 

Since GFA arranged for a PTA, Asteffi had to go to the airport to collect the ticket. The camp official arranged for a taxi for me last Sunday, and again on Monday, when I left for Goa, Asteffi said. 

For that my coaches, Chitra and Shukla Dutta asked me to pay Rs 800 as taxi fare from the SAI Centre to Dum Dum, which I did. They also asked me to return the train ticket to them. 

The GFA has already lodged a complaint with the AIFF calling it shabby treatment of their ward. Acting promptly, the AIFF directed the camp in-charge Bablu Dey, an employee of the federations Calcutta office, to submit a report.

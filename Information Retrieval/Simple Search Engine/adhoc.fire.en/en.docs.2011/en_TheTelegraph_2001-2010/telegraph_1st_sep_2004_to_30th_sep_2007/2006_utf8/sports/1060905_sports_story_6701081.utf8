Norton (Massachusetts): Fijis Vijai Singh racked up nine birdies and an eagle to go three strokes clear of Tiger Woods at the top of the Deutsche Bank championship leaderboard on Sunday. 

Singh shot a 10-under par 61 on the third day, setting a course record to move to 11-under for the tournament. 

Briton Justin Rose, the overnight leader, was tied with Woods seeking his fifth victory in a row at second on eight-under par. 

With the rain coming down throughout the afternoon, Singh used the conditions to his advantage. 

He repeatedly dropped his approach shots within feet of the holes, counting on the slow greens to leave little roll and setting up birdie putt opportunities. 

Every time the greens are wet, you can just fire right at the flag, Singh said. The greens were accepting the ball really well. 

Singhs eagle came on the 554-yard, par-five second hole, where he hit a towering drive and landed his second shot on the green. 

He bogeyed just once, on the sixth hole, where his drive flew to the left rough and then three-putted. 

Rose said the weather, which had bothered the players on Friday and Saturday as the remnants of Hurricane Ernesto made their way up the East Coast, proved not to be as tough as feared. 

The rain never really got heavy enough where it was a big problem, Rose said. It was more of an annoyance.Woods made just four birdies in his round. 

I had numerous opportunities to make some putts, and just couldnt do it, he said. Tied at fourth were Americans Shaun Micheel and J.J. Henry, at six under par.

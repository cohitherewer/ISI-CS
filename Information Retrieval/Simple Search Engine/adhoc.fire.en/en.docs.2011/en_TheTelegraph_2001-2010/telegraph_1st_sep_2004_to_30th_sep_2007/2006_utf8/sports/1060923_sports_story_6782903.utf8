 winning note when they defeated Himachal Pradesh 3-0 in 

 a Cluster V match. 

Narendra Meetei and Bungo Singh found the target in the first half, while Bijen Singh completed the tally for Manipur. 

Jammu amp; Kashmir, buoyed by the presence of Mohun Bagan defender Mehrajuddin Wadao, also pocketed three points courtesy their 3-1 verdict over Delhi in Cluster VII action. Ishfaq Ahmed fired a hattrick. 

Mehrajuddins India teammate Sunil Chhetri got the lone goal for Delhi. 

In other action, Chhattisgarh drew goalless with Andhra Pradesh in Cluster V, while the Orissa versus Railways encounter in Cluster VII was abandoned in the second half due to heavy rain and wet ground conditions. 

The match will be replayed on Saturday.

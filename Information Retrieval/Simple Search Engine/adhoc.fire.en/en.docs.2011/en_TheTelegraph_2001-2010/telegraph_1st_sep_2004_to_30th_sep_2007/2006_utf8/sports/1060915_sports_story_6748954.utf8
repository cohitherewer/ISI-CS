 Speed, Shaharyar to visit China

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan will visit China during September 18-22 to find out how significant a part the country can play in expanding the games horizon, according to an ICC press release. 

I was given an insight into the China Cricket Associations plans during an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) seminar in Kuala Lumpur in June and although those plans are still in their early stages, they are still very impressive, Speed said. 

Shaharyar has been appointed by the president of the Asian Cricket Council to chair a Committee to Evaluate China. 

The ACC has run five coaching courses in Beijing, Kunming, Guangzhou and Dalian in the past twelve months. Administered by Cricket Australia, these courses have led to 63 Level 1 accredited coaches being created. These coaches are all linked to some of the premier universities, colleges and schools in China.

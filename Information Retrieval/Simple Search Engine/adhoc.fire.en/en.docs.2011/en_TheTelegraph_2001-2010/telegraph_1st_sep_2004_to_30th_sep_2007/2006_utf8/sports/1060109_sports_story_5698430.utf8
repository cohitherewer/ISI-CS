 Mhambrey: Well look for outright win 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mhambrey 

Calcutta: Against Tamil Nadu, Bengal scuppered their own chances at home and now they need to look at a number of equations to nurture any hope of making it to the semi-finals of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group. 

Deep Dasgupta amp; Co. will host defending champions Railways at the Eden from Tuesday. If Bengal hope things fall in place in their favour, Railways, it may be noted, are fighting for relegation with four points and so, the hosts can not afford to take anything for granted. 

As it stands now, Mumbai are leading the table with 16 points and are assured of a semi-final berth. They are followed by Karnataka on 12 points while Bengal and Tamil Nadu have bagged nine points each with a match to go. 

Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra are on 6 points each. 

I am searching for an answer to why we have performed badly at home, Deep said after Bengals 222-run defeat against Tamil Nadu, despite Sourav Gangulys allround performance. The home team had a four-hour net session at the Eden on Sunday. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey felt: In the last match (against Tamil Nadu) was the one where nothing worked in our favour. We must have to learn from our mistakes and need to set things in order. When asked if there was any plan to contain the Railways team, which comprises of the likes of Murali Kartik, Sanjay Bangar and Jai Prakash Yadav, he said: It is going to be just another match where we would look for an outright win. 

Railways arrived here in the morning, but couldnt have their nets, due to a political rally. 

Having shifted their focus on a green-top against Tamil Nadu, the Bengal camp is learnt to have opted for a spinner-friendly wicket.

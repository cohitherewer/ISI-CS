 Surya shocked by Arghyadip 

Mumbai: Bengals Arghyadip Das pulled off the biggest upset of the Commonwealth Chess Championship here on Friday when he got the better of second seed Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly in the fifth round of the $ 14,000 event. 

Arghyadip broke through the Sicilian Defense adopted by his more famous statemate against his e4 opening by getting good space advantage before opting for a sacrificial exchange on move 20. 

Arghyadip recovered the piece and also gained a pawn in the process before his rival committed a blunder with his queen on the 52nd move and slid to a surprise defeat. 

The victory put Arghyadip in the forefront of the field with 4.5 points to his credit along with defending champion Nigel Short of Britain. 

The top-seeded Short, who gambled with the Evans gambit of surrendering pawns early before forcing overnight leader Abhijeet Gupta to resign on the 41st move. 

GM Pravin Thipsay agreed to a quick draw against IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury while GM Neelotpal Das drew with GM Tejas Bakre.

 Murali wants taunts stopped 

 - Fresh test clears offie action 

 Muralidharan at a press conference on Saturday 

Perth: Muttiah Muralidharan has asked Australian crowds to stop taunting him after his controversial bowling action was again declared legal following a new series of tests. 

Muralidharan said on Saturday he was again contemplating not returning to Australia due to the amount of abuse he receives, stating 99 per cent of the taunts over his action occur in Australia. 

I havent decided yet, but I love this game, I want to play as long as I can, and I want to play in every country, he said. 

The issue over his action reappeared this week after claims the speed he now bowls could influence the 15-degree elbow extension allowed under ICC rules. 

There has also been constant criticism that his last round of tests, at the University of Western Australia in April 2004, hadnt replicated match conditions. 

Both Muralidharans off-break and doosra were tested at a variety of speeds on Thursday and results released on Saturday showed he fell under the limit on each occasion. 

The 33-year-old Muralidharan, who has 584 Test and 406 one-day wickets, asked the Australian public to leave him alone. From this test they should realise Im a normal bowler, like others. Im not doing something wrong, he said. (AP)

Faisalabad: Shahid Afridi clobbered an unbeaten 85 to lead an amazing run-charge as Pakistan set the stage for another monumental total on the opening day of the second Test against India here on Saturday. 

Afridi provided the thrust late with some lusty hits in his 84-ball carnage to propel the home team to a commanding 379 for four at the Iqbal Stadium. 

Vice-captain Younis Khan (83), Mohammed Yousuf (65), and captain Inzamam-ul Haq (79 batting) were the other notable contributors as the Indian bowlers found the going tough on yet another placid track which brought back memories of the run-glut at Lahore. 

The Indians went into the match with five specialist bowlers, but none of them could really put the skids on the free-flowing Pakistan batsmen who scored at 4.2 runs an over to seize the initiative. 

Rookie Rudra Pratap Singh and Zaheer Khan came into the XI replacing Sourav Ganguly and the injured Ajit Agarkar. 

[That Sourav may be dropped and Agarkar was a doubtful starter were reported in these columns on Saturday]. 

Pakistan brought in Abdul Razzaq and Mohammed Asif in place of Mohd Sami and Rana Naved-ul Hasan. 

Electing to bat, the home team was in some trouble at 65 for two, losing both openers Shoaib Malik (19) and Salman Butt (37) but staged a brilliant recovery with two big partnerships. 

Younis and Yousuf brought the innings on track with a 142-run stand for the third wicket before Inzamam and Afidi consolidated the position with an unfinished 163-run partnership which completely demoralised the visitors. 

Debutant left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh was the pick of the Indian bowlers, as he claimed three wickets to justify his inclusion. 

Yousuf and Younis, architects of a huge 319-run partnership for the third wicket at Lahores drawn first Test, steadied the boat before both departed in quick succession. Their dismissal set the stage for Inzamam and the big-hitting Afridi to feature in another healthy partnership. 

In the first two sessions, Pakistan looked like running away to a huge score on a benign track but each time they were stymied somewhat by Rudra Pratap who grabbed three of the four wickets that fell during the day in which for the first time in the series 90 overs could be bowled. 

The left-handed Butt, looking well-set, was dismissed by a fine ball from Zaheer Khan which cut in after pitching to take the inside edge and Mahendra Singh Dhoni accepted the catch without ado. 

Rudra Pratap struck telling blows in quick succession by accounting for the two Ys late in the last 45 minutes of the second session. 

Younis, almost run out for the second innings in running when on 11 after being stranded midway on the pitch, was out to a blinder of a catch at backward point by Yuvraj Singh who leapt high to pluck the ball out of the air. 

Rudra Pratap struck again when Yousuf chased a ball angled away from him to be caught behind by Dhoni.

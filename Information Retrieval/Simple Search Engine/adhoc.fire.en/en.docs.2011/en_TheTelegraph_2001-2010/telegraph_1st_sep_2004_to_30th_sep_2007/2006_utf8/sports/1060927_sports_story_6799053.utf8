 Robredo eyes Shanghai berth

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: Top seed Tommy Robredo and No. 4 Dmitry Tursunov checked into town late on Monday after completing their Davis Cup engagements a day earlier. Both spoke to the media briefly on Tuesday afternoon. 

Heres what the two had to say: 

ROBREDO: To travel all the way from Europe after playing a Davis Cup tie is never easy. You have also got to adjust from clay to hardcourt But we are professionals and have to accept these things. One cant but play for the country and I also have to play the Tour events to garner points and qualify for the Masters Cup (in Shanghai). Its great to be seeded No. 1 here I just want to win the first match tomorrow (versus Austrian Alexander Peya). 

 TURSUNOV: Marat 

 (Safin) was supposed to play the reverse singles versus 

 Andy Roddick on Sunday (in the Davis Cup semis), but instead 

 I was asked to take his place. I was scared he would beat 

 me up It was an up-and-down match, and it was great to 

 come through. I know I may not get a chance to play a match 

 in the final (versus Argentina), that will be the captains 

 decision after watching everyones form in practice 

 leading to the final.

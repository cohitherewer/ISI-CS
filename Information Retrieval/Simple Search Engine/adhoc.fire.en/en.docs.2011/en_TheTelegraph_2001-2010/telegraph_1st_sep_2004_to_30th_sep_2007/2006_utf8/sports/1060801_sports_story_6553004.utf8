 Defeat a wake-up call: Bhaichung

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia described Mohun Bagans 0-1 defeat to Calcutta Port Trust in the Sahara CFL Premier Division on Monday as a wake-up call to the side. 

Every defeat is disappointing. Its a wake-up call and we cant take anything for granted, the talismanic striker said after the match. 

According to him, Mohun Bagan would present a far better show once all the players are available. This is a young side. But more than that, its very difficult to play good football on such poor ground conditions, he maintained. 

He also made it clear that if needed, he was ready to play all through the league. I want to have a rotation policy in place. But if the team needs me, Ill play the league, Bhaichung, who stayed away from the tournament for East Bengal last year, said. 

Meanwhile, Calcutta Port Trust coach Aloke Mukherjee felt he deserved more than coaching his current side. 

It was not any revenge of sorts: Aloke ? who coached Mohun Bagan earlier ? nipped such suggestion in the bud. According to him, the victory should serve a reminder to those who have been questioning his coaching credentials. 

Its always a nice feeling to beat Mohun Bagan at home. But Ive done this before as the coach of a so-called small team. With Ever-Ready, Id beaten East Bengal, as Tollygunge Agragami coach, I also accounted for the Big Two. So its not something new to me. 

But this win should serve as notice to those who say that Aloke Mukherjee cant coach a team, the former India left-back, who was assistant to chief India coach Stephen Constantine, remarked. 

He, however, had some words of compassion for his one-time India teammate and now the opposition coach, Biswajit Bhattacharya. 

 Dont blame him for this defeat. Hes 

 yet to get his all players. Once the likes of (Jose Ramirez) 

 Barreto comes, this Mohun Bagan will be looking a different 

 side, Aloke pointed out.

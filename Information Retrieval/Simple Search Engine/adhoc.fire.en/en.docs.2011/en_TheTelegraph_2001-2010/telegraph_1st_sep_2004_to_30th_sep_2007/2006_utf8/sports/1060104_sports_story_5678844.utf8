 Sanath slips in bathroom

Christchurch: Veteran Sri Lankan allrounder Sanath Jayasuriya is unlikely to play any further part on the tour of New Zealand after dislocating his shoulder in a bathroom mishap. 

Jayasuriya was a late withdrawal from Tuesdays one-day International here after he fell awkwardly, Sri Lankan manager Michael Tissera said. Sanath was reaching for his shampoo when he slipped and fell in his bath, Tissera said. 

Jayasuriya, the fourth player to score 10,000 one-day runs, will remain with the squad but is unlikely to play in the remaining matches in Wellington on Friday and Napier on Sunday. 

Tissera confirmed Jayasuriya would stay with the squad when they travel to Australia for a tri-series. (AFP)

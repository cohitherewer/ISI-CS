The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Player of the day

 Oleksander shovkovsky 

Monday was the goalkeepers day in the World Cup. After Gianlugi Buffon shone for Italy in the days first match, it was Ukraine custodian Oleksander Shovkovskys turn to dazzle against Switzerland. After conceding four goals against Spain, Shovkovsky now has played five hours in three matches without seeing the ball hit the back of his net. 

In the end, he made two spectacular saves in the tie-breaker to see Ukraine through to the last eight. While Tranquillo Barnettas shot hit the bar, Shovkovsky thwarted both Marco Streller and Ricardo Cabanass efforts. 

For the 31-year-old Dynamo Kiev goalkeeper this was no new achievement. Back home he is considered an important member of the team than even Andriy Shevchenko. In the qualifiers, he kept the sheets clean in six straight matches before conceding a goal against Georgia. Admittedly, the clinical finishing of Andriy Shevchenko played a crucial role in Ukraine claiming their place in Germany, but a series of solid displays in the last line of defence by Shovkovskyi was also a major factor. 

Between 1994 and 2005, Shovkovsky represented his country 63 times and was beaten on just 43 occasions.

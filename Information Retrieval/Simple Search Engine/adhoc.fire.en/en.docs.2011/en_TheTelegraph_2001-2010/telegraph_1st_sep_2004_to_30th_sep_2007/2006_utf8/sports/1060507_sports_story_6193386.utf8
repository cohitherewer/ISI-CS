 Third round washed out

 Seoul Golf

 Seoul: Torrential rain 

 forced cancellation of the third round at the $600,000 SK 

 Telecom Open on Saturday compelling organisers to make the 

 event a 54-hole affair.

 Asian Tours senior tournament 

 director Wanchai Meechai said continuous rain since 6 am 

 made conditions unplayable at the Sky 72 Golf Club.

 Play has been cancelled 

 today because of the torrential rain and strong winds and 

 we will resume the third and final round tomorrow (Sunday), 

 said Wanchai.

 Play was suspended at 9.45 am 

 before officials decided to cancel the third round at 12.15 

 pm. Joint halfway leaders Prom Meesawat of Thailand and 

 Iain Steel of Malaysia had yet to tee off.

 Meesawat and Steel share the lead 

 at 11-under, while Indias Jeev Milkha Singh, who won 

 the Volvo China Open title last month, shot a 66 in the 

 second round to share third place with Koreas Lee 

 Seong-Ho, who scored a 67. They were one shot behind at 

 10-under.

 Thailands Chapchai Nirat 

 and Brad Kennedy of Australia were a further stroke back 

 while title holder Choi was tied 23rd on 140, seven shots 

 behind the leaders.

 Harmeet Kahlon (139) at five-under 

 was tied 17th.

 This is the second event on the 

 Asian Tour this season which has been reduced to three rounds. 

 The Maybank Malaysian Open, won 

 by Koreas Charlie Wi, was also reduced to 54 holes 

 due to poor weather. When Choi Kyung-ju of Korea won the 

 SK Telecom Open in 2003, it was also played in three rounds.

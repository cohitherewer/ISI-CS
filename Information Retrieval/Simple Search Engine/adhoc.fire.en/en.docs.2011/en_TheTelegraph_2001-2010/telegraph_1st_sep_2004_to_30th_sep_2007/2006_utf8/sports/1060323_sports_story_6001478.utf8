The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The East Bengal ground turned into a battlefield on Wednesday, the first time in local hockey this season. In a first division group A match, Gurdhyan Singh of Punjab SC and Khalsa Blues? B. Tuti broke into an altercation over a tackle inside the D that suddenly turned violent.

 Gurdhyan hit Tuti with the stick and with the latter retaliating, it soon turned into a free-for-all. The mounted police had to intervene to calm frayed tempers. Gurdhyan was left with blood gushing out of his mouth while Tuti suffered a cut near his ear. Both were shown red cards.

 For the record, Khalsa won by a M. Mundu goal.

 In another match, FCI won 2-0 against Police AC, goals coming from Bhim Kumar and Apurba Chatterjee.

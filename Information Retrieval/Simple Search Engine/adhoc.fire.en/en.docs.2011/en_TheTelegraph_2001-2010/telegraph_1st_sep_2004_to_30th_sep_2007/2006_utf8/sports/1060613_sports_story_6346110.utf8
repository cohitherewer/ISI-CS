 No one will ever beat my record: Fontaine

Hameln: Just Fontaine is categorical: nobody will ever beat his record 13 goals in a World Cup tournament. 

Fontaine took six games to achieve his feat at the 1958 World Cup, when he was a last-minute inclusion on the French squad for injured Reims teammate Rene Bliard. 

The closest any player has come since then was Gerd Muellers 10 goals for West Germany in 1970. 

Beating my record? I dont think it can ever be done, Fontaine said in an interview. The person who wants to beat me has a massive task, doesnt he? He has to score two goals per game over seven games. 

Entering the 58 World Cup in Sweden, the Moroccan-born Fontaine was a little known forward outside of the French league. 

Yet he tormented opponents with his pace and finishing ? even with someone elses boots. He had to borrow a pair after damaging his own boots in practice. 

View old, grainy, footage of Fontaine and he looks lightning quick. 

A lack of pressure from within the French federation following Les Bleus lacklustre build-up and from rivals helped him to maximise his talent, Fontaine concedes. 

You can only do that if dont ask yourself any questions, he said in a telephone interview from Toulouse. At the time nothing bothered me, I even declined to take a penalty. 

Fontaine scored four goals in the third-place play-off against West Germany but could have had five ? he turned down a chance to take a penalty. 

Top strikers at the World Cup now are acknowledged with the Golden Boot. Fontaine set the record when Fifa did not present a specific award for the tournaments top scorer. 

All I got was a rifle from a Swedish newspaper for being top marksman, said Fontaine. And I was carried off the field. But that was it. 

Playing in the days when there no substitutes allowed, France lost their semi-final 2-5 to a Brazil team featuring 17-year-old Pele. 

Now a portly 72-year-old businessman, Fontaine recalled being amazed at Peles stunning talent. The pair remains friends, 48 years on. 

As soon as Pele touched the ball you knew he was wonderful, Fontaine said. 

 He scored three against us. But it was only when I watched the final (versus Sweden) that I realised just how good he was. One trick from Pele stood out. 

Sweden had a player called (Reino) Borjesson... very strong with huge thighs, Fontaine said. Borjesson charged at Pele, who poked the ball over his head with his right foot, spun around, and then shot the ball with his left. It hit the crossbar so hard it bounced back to midfield. And Pele was so skinny!

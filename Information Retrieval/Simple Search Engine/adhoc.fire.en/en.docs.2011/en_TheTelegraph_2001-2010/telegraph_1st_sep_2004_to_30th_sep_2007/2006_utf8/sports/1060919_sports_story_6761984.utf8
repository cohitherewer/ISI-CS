 ATP / WTA RANKINGS

 New Delhi: The title victory 

 at the China Open in Beijing last night has given a boost 

 to Indian ace Mahesh Bhupathi, who has gone up by four places 

 in the ATP doubles rank-ing to be at the 25th spot.

 Bhupathi, combining with Croatian 

 partner Mario Ancic, routed Michael Berrer of Germany and 

 Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark 6-4, 6-3 on Sunday to win the 

 doubles title at the $475,000 event.

 The win has helped the Bangalore 

 player get 1525 points and move to No. 25 in the doubles 

 individual rankings.

 His former partner and Davis Cup 

 captain Leander Paes remained steady at the ninth spot with 

 3820 points.

 Sania Mirza, who had slid 16 places 

 to 70 last week, hung in there with 366 points.

 Sania would seek to improve her 

 ranking when she plays the Sunfeast Open tournament in Calcutta 

 before the home crowd this week.

 circuit, Shikha Uberoi (world ranking 193), Ankita Bhambri

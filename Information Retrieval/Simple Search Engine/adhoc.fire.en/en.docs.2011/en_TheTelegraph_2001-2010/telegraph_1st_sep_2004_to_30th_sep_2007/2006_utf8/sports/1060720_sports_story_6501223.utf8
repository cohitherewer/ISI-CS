 Sreesanth: Tri-series will be challenging 

London: Indias new pace spearhead Sreesanth says Sri Lankas current form would make the upcoming tri-series in the emerald isle a highly challenging affair. 

The 22-year-old bowler also said Indias own good ODI form over the last six months, barring the blip in the West Indies, would go on to make the August 14-29 series quite thrilling. The way we have been performing in the last six months, theres a good series in the offing, he said. 

Also, Sri Lanka have been performing very well. They have good batting with (Sanath) Jayasuriya and (Upul) Tharanga and it is going to be challenging, he told a British television channel. 

Sri Lanka, who were drubbed 4-1 by India late last year, thrashed England 5-0 recently in an away series. 

Sreesanth also said the India could do well in next years World Cup in the Caribbean despite their loss against Brian Laras men in June. 

It was a good experience in the Caribbean. Our pace attack is on the right track with Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and VRV Singh bowling very well, he said. 

However, the Indian squad did not expect slow wickets in the West Indies, he said. Earlier, I thought wickets there would be very quick but once the one-day and the Test matches started off, we realised they are slow wickets.

Rameshwaram: Despite the raging controversy over a failed gender test at the just concluded Asian Games in Doha that eventually disqualified S. Shanti of Tamil Nadu, who had won the 800m silver medal there, chief minister M. Karunanidhi on Monday awarded her Rs 15 lakh in cash and a colour TV at a brief function in Chennai. 

Though the Olympic Council of Asia has said that the athlete would be stripped of her silver medal, Karunanidhi kept his promise made last week. 

Keep your purse (cash prize) safely and you only need to answer your conscience, Karunanidhi said as he handed her the prize amount. 

Karunanidhi also awarded Rs 20 lakh to Sasikaran, who won the team gold in chess, Rs 15 lakh to Anju Bobby George for her feat in long-jump and Rs 10 lakh to Saurav Ghoshal for picking up the bronze in squash at Doha and who had also been part of the Tamil Nadu contingent. 

A visibly shaken Shanti, wearing a blue blazer and with the medal strung around her neck, said, I dont know anything (about the controversy). 

According to sports minister T.P.M. Mohideen Khan, the state went ahead with the awards as there was no official communication from the Centre till date. 

Meanwhile, when The Telegraph contacted Nagarajan, Shantis coach at Prime Sports Academy in Chennai over the phone, he expressed deep shock at the athlete reportedly failing a gender test. As far as we know, Shanti has been mentioned as a girl in all her certificates, the coach said.

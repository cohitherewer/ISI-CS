 Ronaldo has surgery

 - Brazilian team doctor wields scalpel 

 Surgery on Ronaldos left knee nearly took one and half hour 

 Sao Paulo: Brazil striker Ronaldo successfully 

 underwent minor leg surgery on Saturday, the players 

 spokesman said. 

 The Real Madrid player was operated on his left tibia 

 to remove calcifications that had been causing pain in recent 

 months, spokesman Paulo Julio Clement said. 

The surgery at Pasteur Hospital in Rio de Janeiro was performed by Brazil national team doctor Jose Luiz Runco. Real Madrid doctor Alfonso del Corral also was present for the procedure, which lasted nearly an hour and a half. 

Ronaldo was Brazils starter at the World Cup, scoring three times and becoming the tournaments all-time leading scorer with 15 goals. Brazil were eliminated in the quarter finals after a 1-0 loss to eventual runners-up France. 

The 29-year-old Ronaldo was marred by two serious injuries earlier in his career. First in 1999, when he tore up his knee with Inter Milan and needed surgery. A year later, he twisted the same knee and was sidelined for several months after another surgery. 

 He recovered, however, helping lead Brazil to their 

 fifth world title in 2002 in South Korea and Japan. He was 

 the tournaments top scorer with eight goals in seven 

 matches ? including two in the final against Germany. (AP)

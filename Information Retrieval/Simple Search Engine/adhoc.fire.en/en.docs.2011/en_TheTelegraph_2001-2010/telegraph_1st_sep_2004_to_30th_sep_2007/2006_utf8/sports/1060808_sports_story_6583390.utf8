The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Santosh Trophy from 2nd week of September

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is yet to decide on Santosh Trophy venue, but has made up its mind to stage the tournament from the second or third week of September. 

In a letter to the state associations, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has said that the preliminaries of the national meet will be held from the second or third week of September, though the venue would be intimated later. 

Interestingly, the state associations have also been asked to confirm their participation for the tournament by August 15. 

Two state associations Bengal and Goa have already gone on record saying that they would not play the Santosh Trophy unless it is moved out of Srinagar, the scheduled venue. 

AIFF, however, is likely to take a decision on the venue before August 15, the last date for confirmation of participation. 

While Haryana is tipped to be the front-runners, Tamil Nadu, too, could be the alternative host.

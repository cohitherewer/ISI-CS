 Anjum leads India fightback

London: Anjum Chopra struck a fine half-century to help Indian women overcome a batting failure and post a challenging 192 for eight in the fourth one-day International against england at Rose Bowl here on Thursday. 

Anjum played the role of a sheet anchor in making a patient 53 and put up useful partnerships with skipper Mithali Raj (47) and Hemlata Kala (40). 

Anjum played 113 balls for her half-century, which included only two fours. Mithali played 99 balls and hit four fours. Hemlatas 40, however, came off 46 balls and included three boundaries. 

Brief scores: India 192/8 in 50 ovs (A. Chopra 53, Mithali Raj 47). (PTI)

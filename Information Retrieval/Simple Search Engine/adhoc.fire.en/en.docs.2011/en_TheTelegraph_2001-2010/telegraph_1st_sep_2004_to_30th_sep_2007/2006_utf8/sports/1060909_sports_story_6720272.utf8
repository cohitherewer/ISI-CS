The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Reluctance to attack cost us dear

 - We allowed England to dominate rather embarrassingly

 Expert View

Indias performance in the World Cup match against England was a big blow to our reputation in hockey, and not because weve started the tournament on a disastrous note. 

Leave alone the 2-3 loss and the fact that two defeats at the start of the tournament have virtually wiped away Indias chances of making the semi-finals after three decades, what stood out like a sore thumb was the Indian teams reluctance to attack and total failure on all fronts. England attacked like never before. I have never seen them play such attacking stuff. 

I also felt India underestimated England, which can be disastrous in a competition like the World Cup where every team is strong, simply because they come through a tough qualifying process. 

I feel there were too many mistakes in the defence, especially from a player like Kanwalpreet, who was the reason why India gave away the strokes and a penalty corner. 

The hesitant, defensive posture for the better part of the match presented Indian hockey in a different picture from the one the world has known them for. The inclination to attack was missing till too late. By then, England had seized the momentum. 

Altering strategy to suit the requirement of matches is fine, but allowing the rivals to dominate play without putting up a fight is not something that the hockey fans at home will easily digest. 

For a better part of the contest, India confined themselves into a defensive shell and allowed England to dominate so much that it appeared embarrassing. India did not just lose the match, they might have lost some of the respect that the Indian teams get in spite of slipping from the podium decades ago. 

When things are going your way, teams normally try and capitalise on the openings. They do not wait for the opposition to bounce back. But England were allowed the luxury of seizing control. It also helped that India were down to 10 players when England began their spree of three penalty corner conversions midway during the second half. 

 After two losses, the team management 

 will need to work hard to motivate players and keep their 

 morale high for the remaining games. India can still salvage 

 some pride. But it is going to be an uphill task.

 Stranded Brazil fans not worried 

Dortmund: Brazil fans following the World Cup were not too concerned with the possibility of being stuck in Germany because of flight cancellations by Brazils embattled flagship airline Varig. 

Weve been told they (the company) will take care of everything, said Luis Parra, a 43-year-old from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Well just worry about the game, Im sure well be fine going back, theyll arrange something. 

Parra and his group were expected to return to Brazil on Saturday, two days after Brazils match against Japan on Thursday in Dortmund. 

Varig suspended service indefinitely to dozens of destinations and cancelled more than half of its flights, causing potential travel headaches for Brazilian fans at the World Cup and possibly even the national team.

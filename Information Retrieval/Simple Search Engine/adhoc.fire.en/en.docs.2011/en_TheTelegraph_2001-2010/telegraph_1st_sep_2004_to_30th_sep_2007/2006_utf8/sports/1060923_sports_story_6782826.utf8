 Sania: One of my most consistent displays

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Top seed Martina Hingis and crowd-favourite Sania Mirza set up the much-anticipated semi-final clash at the WTA Sunfeast Open on Friday. 

While Sania defeated fourth seed Aravane Rezai 6-4, 7-5, Hingis eliminated Tamarine Tanasugarn 7-5, 6-2. In the other semi-final, Olga Poutchkova will meet Iroda Tulyaganova. 

I was happy with my serve today. I knew I had to get into rhythm and the serve helped, said Sania at the post-match press conference. 

Yes, I am working on my backhand and the main aim today was not to hit a backhand to her backhand, which is her forte. 

Is her game plan ready for the semi-final on Saturday? Right now I am happy to be just in the semi-finals. I shall think of the game plan tomorrow morning, she answered. 

Was there a turning point in the match? No turning point. We were level. She was in the match all the time. We both hit the ball hard. It was her backhand against my forehand, she answered, adding: I seem to play better when I am down. I was 1-3 and then 1-4 down in the second set before I came back to win... Somewhat like yesterday. 

On a scale of consistent performances, where would she rate this match? Yes, this is one of my more consistent performances, if not the most consistent performance. 

Rezai seemed to be having some problem with her shoulder during the match. Said Rezai, Its just that the muscle was a little tight, I needed some massage. It was nothing major and it is not why I lost. 

So why did she lose? I didnt play fast and Sania was aggressive. She played well and that made the difference. It just was not my day. 

Hingis admitted she made some mistakes in the match against Tanasugarn initially, that she was rushing too much and Tanasugarn also hit some good shots. Eventually she slowed down and played more top spins. 

What does Hingis feel about the showdown with Sania? Everyone, I believe, was waiting for this. It is great for a tournament and hope we play up to the crowds expectations, she said after her match. 

Does she have any special strategies to take on Sania? Even if I have, I wouldnt tell you, laughs Hingis. Then, on a more sober note she adds that Sania has a strong forehand and only a high percentage of first-serves will be the key to beat her. 

She is expected to be fresher than Sania, considering that Sania has two matches to play on Friday. Will that be a help? Oh shes young and shell recover, said Hingis. When I was her age, I too played singles, doubles and mixed doubles. 

Tanasugarn said that Hingis serve was unbelievable. Against a top player like Hingis who wont give you any chance, you have to give your hundred per cent all the time.

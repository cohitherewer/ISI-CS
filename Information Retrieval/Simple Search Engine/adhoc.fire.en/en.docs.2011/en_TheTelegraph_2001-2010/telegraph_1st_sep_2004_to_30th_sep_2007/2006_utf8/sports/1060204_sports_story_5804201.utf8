 Baghdatis giant-slaying acts no flash in the pan

Roger Federer took another step towards immortality by winning the 2006 Australian Open, his seventh Grand Slam title, in an emotionally charged final. Twenty-year-old unseeded Marcos Baghdatis, the bearded Cypriot, seemed to have a nervous Federer on the edge of a precipice when he led by one set to love, two games to love and had three points for a double-break in the second set. Baghdatis failed to seize the moment. 

It seemed that Baghdatis had exhausted his mental and physical resources. Two days of rest can revive you physically, but recovering the mental strength, especially after his gritty fightback from two sets to love down against Nalbandian in the quarter finals, takes longer. Furthermore, a vision of the summit took Baghdatis mind away from the job at hand. 

The title went to Federer, but it was the bearded Baghdatis who brought the tournament to life. In the absence, due to injury, of Safin and Nadal who are today the two most charismatic characters in the game, the tournament was expected to throw up the normal bland fare. Baghdatis fairytale brought back a vanishing sporting world for the crowd. 

The infectious enthusiasm and joy, the smile Baghdatis radiated, lit up the stadium. The crowd became part of his fairytale as he merrily cruised past three top-10 stars. This was no flash in the pan. 

Baghdatis has a solid all-court game. He hits an early ball, with much less spin than normal, has great depth in his shots, specially on his second serve, is ready to run down even impossible shots, and most of all is brave of heart. Baghdatis punished Federers second serve which was invariably down the centre service line with deep returns off his double handed backhand and pushed him on to the backfoot. 

This put Federer under great pressure. No wonder he broke Federers service so many times. Of course, Baghdatis does not possess the complete array of shots, like Federer has, but Baghdatis is only 20 years old and could well develop into a potential challenger to Federer in the years to come. 

As always, it was a pleasure to watch Federer. When he walks on to the court, he is like a monarch surveying his domain. His gestures, specially the turn of the head, are unhurried, regal and intimidating, treating his opponents as impostors. 

Under pressure in his matches, he wobbled a few times and sunk to mortal levels but came back with shouts of come on and a gentle fist pump. Federer, apart from his breathtaking skills, has brought dignity and grace to a world of crumbling values. But getting to Sampras record of 14 Grand Slam titles is by no means an easy task. Will Federers frail looking physique stand up to the bashing for another few years. 

His next hurdle, the French Open, will be the most difficult in his life, and one wonders if his artistry on the slow clay will prevail against the robust and determined challenge of the likes of Nadal. I wouldnt bet on it. 

Taking a look at the last-16 of the mens draw, one can see the eclipse of the great tennis powers of the past, the US and Australia. The US had only one player in the pre-quarter finals. Second-seeded Andy Roddick, with his missile serve and hasty one-dimensional game, was wiped out by Baghdatis. 

Hewitt seeded No. 3, the lone Australian hope, went down in the second round. His high decibel screams failed to pump enough adrenalin to overcome Juan Iguacio Chela, an unseeded player from Argentina. Hewitt blamed the slow surface and heavy balls for his downfall. 

The last eight in the mens singles was conclusive evidence of the globalisation of tennis ? there were One Swiss, one Cypriot, two French, one Russian, one German, one Croat and one Argentine. 

With the Chinese girls winning the womens doubles, Bhupathi winning the mixed doubles and Paes featuring in the mens doubles final, Asian tennis made its presence felt. The Chinese women have made excellent progress in a short time. It will not be long before they will, like the Russians, clamour at the gates of the top-10. 

I must pay tribute to Paes and Bhupathi who have, between them, notched up an amazing 17 Grand Slam doubles titles. Ten years ago, even one Grand Slam title would have sounded like a fairytale. Bhupathis ten titles are a monumental achievement. Proof of the depth of his talent is evident from the fact that he won the last four with different partners. 

Sitting here, the impact of these victories on Indias image abroad is often underestimated. A sporting icon, seen worldwide on television, has a wider and more telling impact than can be achieved by the highest profile politicians. The gilded accolades that Bhupathi and Paes deserve are not only for playing skills, but also for their dignified and sporting behaviour. 

There was no fairytale in the womens event. In fact, it was a sad story. With 20 of the top-ranked players, including 10 Grand Slam winners, in the draw, one expected some great matches. Henin-Hardennes stomach virus, which forced her to quit when she was 1-6, 0-2 down in the final, had a hollow ring and was criticised worldwide. 

Sitting on the stool and collecting $ 60,0000 is not on is what one scribe wrote. Admired for the way she had handled the tragic happenings in her younger days, the hushed crowd and the world expected her to die with her boots on. But Henin-Hardenne chose to live and fight another day. I am reluctantly inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. Her carrying on could well have been career-threatening. 

Amelie Mauresmo, the champion labelled the hitherto perennial underachiever, had been knocking at the door for seven long years. Possibly the best natural athlete in the womens game with a complete array of groundshots and volley, Mauresmo in the past just could not clinch the big matches due to a mental block. 

It was a joy to watch Mauresmos smooth and fluid movement, especially when she moved up to the net. Mauresmo is a worthy champion. Her victory will boost her confidence and take her to a higher level, a rich reward for her perseverance. Her remark, I was ready to die on the court sums up the fire that had built up in her belly. 

Sharapova, looking stronger than last year, has a steam-rolling game. Big, deep aggressive groundshots hit to the corners sums up her game. There is no variation. In good playing conditions, when her errors are low, she can beat anyone. Her game is a carbon copy of Davenport, as they both had the same coach, Robert Lansdorf. 

Martina Hingis made a remarkable comeback after a three-year lay-off. Her reaching the quarter finals was nothing short of a miracle. The Swiss Miss looks like a Swiss Madam now. She is fresh, stronger, very experienced and maintains a very high level of consistency. Everyone in the top-10 will be wary of playing against Hingis. 

Clijsters, who had strong credentials to win the tournament, tore a ligament in her right ankle against Mauresmo in the semis and had to conceded the match. With her opponents defaulting in the semi-final and final, the gilt has, due to no fault of hers, rubbed off from Mauresmos crown. 

The early exit of the Williams sisters was a body blow to the ladies singles event. The white rattling plastic beads knitted into their hair years ago at Wimbledon had morphed into a sort of a diamond tiara at last years US Open! The Australian Open brought back a measure of normalcy, especially in their dress mode. 

Serenas dress with trimmings and a sensible skirt was feminine and beautiful. The Baby Doll dresses Sharapova and other long-legged beauties wore brought a whiff of boudoir fragrance to the Centre Court. One expected them to use a powder puff and make-up mirror while delicately fanning themselves during changeovers and not the rough vigorous towelling. 

But what took the cake was a skirt little broader than a Sam Brown Belt which a couple of girls bravely wore; it exposed the pectorals and was centimetres away from obscenity. Unfortunately players wear what they are told to. 

Who says there is no slavery in the 21st century? We are all slaves, more so the stars. They are all slaves of the commercial giants, yanked mercilessly by the nose ring of money, telling them what to wear, what to drink, where to go, when to go, what to do, to sell their wares to the world.

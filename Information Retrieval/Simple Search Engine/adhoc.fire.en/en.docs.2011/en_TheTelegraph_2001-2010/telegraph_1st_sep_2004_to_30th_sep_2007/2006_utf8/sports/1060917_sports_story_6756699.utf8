 Atwal pulls out after Round I

Farmington (United States): Arjun Atwal had another disappointing tournament on the USPGA Tour as he withdrew from the 84 Lumber Classic after a miserable seven-over 79 in Round I. 

The latest missed cut meant Atwal has failed to make it to the weekend in 17 out of 27 starts and his hopes of ensuring a full card for 2007 still seem to be under a cloud. 

With the cut coming at one-over, it would have needed a six-under round from Atwal to stay in the tournament. 

Ryan Moore and Ben Curtis (70) share the lead at the midway stage, when the talk centred around yet another missed cut for 16-year-old Michelle Wie.

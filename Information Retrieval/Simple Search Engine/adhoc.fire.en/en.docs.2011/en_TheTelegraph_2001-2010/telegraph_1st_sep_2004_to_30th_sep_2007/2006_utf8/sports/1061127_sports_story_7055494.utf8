 Shoaib-Asif case internal matter: Ashraf

Karachi: PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf has made it clear that the doping ban on fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif was the boards internal matter and international bodies such as Wada, ICC or IOC had no role to play in it. 

As such the IOC, ICC or Wada have nothing to do with it, Ashraf was quoted as saying in a daily. The PCB itself had conducted the tests and these were out-of-competition tests, he said after attending a meeting of the Asian Cricket Councils development committee here. 

We will totally abide by the verdict of the appeals committee which is likely to be announced by Monday, he added. (PTI)

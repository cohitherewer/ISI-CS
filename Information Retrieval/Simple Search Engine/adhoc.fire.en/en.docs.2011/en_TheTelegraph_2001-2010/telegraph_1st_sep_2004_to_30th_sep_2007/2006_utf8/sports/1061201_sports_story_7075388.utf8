The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Important to get used to conditions quickly 

 - Every series is a challenge, says Sourav 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly was candid and forthcoming at the press conference minutes after hearing the news of his selection to the Test squad on the tour of South Africa at the Eden on Thursday. 

The following are excerpts 

Q How does it feel to be back? 

A I am obviously happy 

Given the teams current form, how do you look at your chances? 

My job is to go and do well. I will try to do my best. 

Wont fast and bouncy pitches in South Africa be a problem? 

I have done well in Australia where there is a lot of bounce. I have played with the same group of players earlier. I hope I can continue in the same way. So, the question of not performing well on bouncy pitches doesnt arise. 

Will your recall to the Test squad be a stepping stone to make it to the one-day side in the run-up to the World Cup? 

I will take one series at a time. 

What has been the reason behind Indias poor show in the one-day series? 

I am too far away to make a comment on this. 

What are the teams prospects in the Test series? 

We have been successful on bouncy pitches in Australia. I hope we can play better. As the tour progresses, the players will get used to the conditions. 

Are you hopeful of a turnaround in Indias fortunes? 

Everybody needs time Given the time, the players can come good. 

Is there a sense of relief or are you looking forward to the challenge? 

Every series is a challenge It doesnt matter whether it is your first Test or 100th. 

What position would you like to bat at? 

I cannot comment on this. Its up to the management. 

Will you be willing if you are asked to open the innings? 

Dont ask me questions relating to ifs and buts. It is not my job to decide such things 

As a former captain, would you give your advice to the team? 

I will have to go and see 

How hopeful are you of getting runs in South Africa? 

I have done well for the last ten years. I have got runs there. This is not the first time I will be going there. Its a question of how quickly I can get used to the conditions and get runs. 

What do you bring to the side? 

A lot of runs and experience of playing in South Africa

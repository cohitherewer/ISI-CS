 Clijsters overpowers Schnyder in final

Stanford: Top seed Kim Clijsters won her fourth Bank of the West Classic title with a 6-4, 6-2 victory over second seed Patty Schnyder in Sundays final. I feel so familiar every time I come back here, Clijsters said after picking up her second trophy of the year. 

It feels comfortable. Its been like that from the first time I played here. Everything just comes together. When you feel good, you start to play better. Rarely threatened during the contest, the Belgian tuned up for the defence of her US Open crown next month with an authoritative display. 

Clijsters registered 19 winners to only eight from Schnyder, and dominated on her service games, never facing a break point and winning 90 per cent of her first serve points. She tortured Schnyder by attacking the left-handers backhand with sliced serves out wide. 

It was important to make first serves because she tries to play angles and build up her points, Clijsters said. The left-handed Schnyder attempted to employ an aggressive approach against Clijsters, but the move backfired as the Belgian proved to be up to the task. 

I never felt like I was in the match, said the eighth-ranked Schnyder. She keeps pushing you. 

Last season, world No. 2 Clijsters had won four titles on US hard courts during the summer swing, including her first Grand Slam title at the Flushing Meadows. 

This year, Clijsters has fallen in three Grand Slam semi-finals; to top ranked Amelie Mauresmo at the Australian Open, and to her compatriot, Justine Henin-Hardenne, at the French Open and Wimbledon. 

After her recent disappointment on clay and grass, Clijsters believes her best chance of winning another Grand Slam will be on hard courts.

 Philippoussis clinches crown

 Philippoussis with the trophy on Sunday 

Newport: Australian Mark Philippoussis won his first tournament in three years on Sunday, defeating American Justin Gimelstob 6-3, 7-5 in the final of the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, Rhode Island. 

The 29-year-old was a wild card entry but showed strong form all week to win for the first time since 2003 in Shanghai. The Australian, known as Scud, once ranked as high as eighth in the world, has battled numerous injuries in recent years and entered the tournament ranked 214th. 

It feels great. It feels like 20 years, the 29-year-old Australian told reporters after his 11th career victory.

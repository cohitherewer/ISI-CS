The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Coaches happy 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The goalless draw in Saturdays IFA Shield match suited Sporting Clube de Goa more, but even the Mahindra United camp was not complaining. 

We are not disappointed, said Mahindra coach Derick Pereira. The goal is to qualify for the semis and there were many ways to do so with six points, four points or two. The first option is out of question now, well have to settle for one of the other two. Mahindra need a solitary point from their last group league match against East Bengal (Monday) to pip the Calcutta heavyweights to a berth in the semis. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwama was delighted with Saturdays result. It was a very good result as we qualified for the semis. I think we deserved what we got. 

Focus on Bhaichung, Barreto 

The focus now shifts to the other group in which Mohun Bagan take on Shenzen on Sunday evening. All eyes will be on Bhaichung Bhutia, who returned from Doha on Saturday and is expected to pair up with Jose Ramirez Barreto for the first time in three years.

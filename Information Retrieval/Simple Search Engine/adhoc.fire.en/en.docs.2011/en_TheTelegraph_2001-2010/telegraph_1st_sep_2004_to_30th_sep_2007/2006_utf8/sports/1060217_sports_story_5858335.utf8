 Coaches have their say...

As India sealed the ODI series with a five-wicket win in Multan on Thursday, the mood in the two camps were obviously different, as reflected by Greg Chappell and Bob Woolmer. Following are excerpts from what the coaches had to say: 

m Greg Chappell: We are bouncing back in the ODIs. The infusion of youth after the Test series has put the team on a high...You have to put the right people in the right places and work hard. Its all about working hard? Sreesanth has added spark to the bowling. He is someone we had been keeping a watch on for quite sometime. He has been playing on and off, and his performance has been quite satisfying. We are very impressed with his temperament, above all. 

m Bob Woolmer: No one likes to lose the series with one game to go? We needed to build partnerships, but we never got one apart from that between Inzy and Yousuf? Its up to the players in the middle?We havent really strung our game together... Its difficult to point a finger. India have just played better than us? We are hunting for the reasons behind the losses. We have to sit and find out where everyone is mentally? The players will show character in the next match? The toss was important because the pitches have slightly more grass than usual? We had put a lot of stress on the Tests, hadnt really concentrated on the ODIs? We will try and get a couple of new faces in Karachi. At this stage, we can afford a few experiments.

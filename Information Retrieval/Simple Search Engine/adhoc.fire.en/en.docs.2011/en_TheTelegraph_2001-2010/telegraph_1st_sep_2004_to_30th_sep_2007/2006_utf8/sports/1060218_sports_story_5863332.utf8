 Sasi wins, finishes 3rd

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran stole the final day honours by clinching a sparkling win against overnight joint leader Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria in the ninth and final round but finished third in the A1 group of the Aeroflot International Open Chess Tournament here. 

The victory helped Sasikiran in tying for the top spot along with GM Jobava Baadur of Georgia, 2003 winner Viktor Bologan of Moldova, and twice world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan. 

As the ties were resolved, the first place went to Baadur and Bologan finished second while Sasikiran ended up third. The Indian was richer by $12000 while the winner went home with a purse of $22000 for his effort. 

Sasikiran turned out to be the lone prize winner from India in the premier A1 group as GM Sandipan Chanda settled for a quick draw with Konstantin Landa of Russia and national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly followed suit with Michael Roiz of Israel. 

In the A2, double GM norm holder Neelotpal Das was held to a draw by Dmitry Andreikin of Russia and GM R. B. Ramesh was comprehensively beaten by Vladimir Kosyrev, also of Russia. 

Also losing his way was IM norm holder Arghyadip Das who went down to Zhu Chen of China. 

On the brighter side, Indian youngsters Parimarjan Negi, Abhijeet Gupta and Deep Sengupta ended the event on a positive note. 

Negi and Gupta drew their final round games while Sengupta defeated Duris Aurelien of France. All the three stand to gain important rating points from the event.

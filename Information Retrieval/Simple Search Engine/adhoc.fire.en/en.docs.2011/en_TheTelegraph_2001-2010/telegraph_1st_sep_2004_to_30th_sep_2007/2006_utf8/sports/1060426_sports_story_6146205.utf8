 Schedule affecting quicks, says Steve

London: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh has warned the games administrators that the hectic international schedule has begun to affect the quality of fast bowling and that in turn adversely affected the overall standard of the game. 

The bowling stock has dropped off the past couple of years because the guys are tired. 

Theyre the ones who are going to be adversely affected, especially through physical fatigue, Waugh said. 

When the quality of the bowling drops off, youll see these big scores and you get games that are not that great to watch. So theyve got to be careful that they dont overdo it. 

Waugh said that the players had the pride of playing for the country and the incentive of more money, but the authorities needed guard against burnout cases. 

Youve got to get some balance there. Youve got to realise youre playing for your country and earning good money, Waugh was quoted as saying in a London daily. 

However, the authorities have got to realise that if they keep such a heavy schedule, in the end the quality of the cricket will suffer, particularly among the quick bowlers. 

Waugh said the rotation policy, especially in ODIs, could be one solution to the malady. 

One-day cricket being the more commercial aspect of the game, so I think you can rotate, he said.

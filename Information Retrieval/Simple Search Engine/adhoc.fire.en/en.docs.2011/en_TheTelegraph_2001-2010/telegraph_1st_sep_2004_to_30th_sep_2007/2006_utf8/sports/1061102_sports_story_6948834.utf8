 Motivated West Indies raring to go vs SA

 - No takers for semi-final sans India

Jaipur: The sight of a yawning security guard at the VVIP gate of the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here sums up the entire story. 

The very arena which was swarming with policemen guarding the place in the most over-zealous manner only a few days back, is now having a deserted look. The people of the Pink City, it is quite evident, hardly have any interest in a tournament sans India, be it the Champions Trophy penultimate round match between defending champions the West Indies and former champions South Africa. 

It is certainly a matter of pity that there may not be too many people in the stands to watch the semi-final clash on Thursday, which has all the ingredients to turn out to be an explosive contest. The last time the two met in a series in the West Indies, the relations between the two sides deteriorated rapidly though the visitors were runaway 5-0 winners in the one-day series. 

One thing is for sure, it would be a different ball game on Thursday. The West Indies have climbed up the ladder hard way in this tournament. They were the defending champions, but were made to play the qualifiers based on their recent form. The twice world champions, once considered the last word in one-day cricket, never made an issue out of it and have fought their way to the semi-final with some consistent performance. 

It is a team that has grown as a fighting unit and learnt to win under the leadership of Brian Lara. His presence is a huge motivation for the young brigade, which even the South African skipper Graeme Smith confessed was tough to face. There may be some inconsistency in the West Indies at times, but they have quite a few match-winners in the team, Smith said. 

The form of Lara may not have very encouraging though he struck a superb 71 against Australia in Mumbai in the group league. But then, he is a kind of performer, who can excel at this stage of the tournament. The explosive Chris Gayle is the teams batting strength up the order with Shivnarine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan looking good to make their contribution in a big game. The likes of Dwayne Bravo and Runako Morton add to the depth of the batting. It is a team that firmly believes in performing collectively. 

Lara can draw strength from the excellent force that has come in the shape of Jerome Taylor and Ian Bradshaw with support from Dwayne Smith. It is also time for Marlon Samuels to come good too. 

The South African camp appears a happy lot enjoying their good run in the tournament. Indications are that South Africa may bring in Loots Bosman, an aggressive opener, to boost the top order which has suffered from the poor form of Herschelle Gibbs and Boeta Dippenaar. South Africa can go the distance with some effective all round contribution from veteran Jaques Kallis. He has the calibre to swing the match with his individual brilliance. 

Even though the pitch could aid the slow bowlers, it is unlikely that skipper Graeme Smith could disturb his all pace attack. Smith, however, skirted a question on Gibbs form and said it was time for everyone in the top order to score runs.

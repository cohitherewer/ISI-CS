Calcutta: It was Mission Accomplished for Jose Ramirez Barreto as Mahindra United defeated East Bengal 1-0 in the 10th National League Football (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

It was Barreto, who had announced a day before the match that his team was looking at nothing but victory, who scored the winner in the 67th minute. 

Phillipe de Ridders prediction also came true. He had said on the eve of the match that it would be Mission Impossible for his team which was missing some senior players because of injuries. 

The absence of the likes of star-striker Bhaichung Bhutia did prove costly for the red-and-golds as they suffered the first defeat in the league. 

While East Bengal stayed on 12 points from seven games, Mahindra United retained their lead atop the standings with 16 points from six matches. 

Both the teams were on the defensive mode right from the start. 

The first chance for East Bengal came in the 36th minute, when Debobrata Roys shot from just outside the box missed the horizontal bar by a whisker. 

After the lemon break, Mahindra changed gears and started making their presence felt. The moves came thick and fast, as the East Bengal defence struggled to keep the citadel intact. 

Twelve minutes into the second half, the Mumbai outfit came close as Surkumar Singhs long-ranger kissed the top bar on its way out. 

Ten minutes later, it was East Bengal who came close to scoring, but Syed Rahim Nabi squandered the chance. Jayanta Sen, advancing down the right flank, took a shot which rebounded off Subhasish Roy Chowdhurys gloves. The opportunistic Nabi was lurking in the vicinity, but failed to take advantage and shot the ball straight it again into the hands of the Mahindra custodian. 

As the ball moved to the other side of the field, Mahindra found the winner. Surojit Bose received a through pass from the midfield and forwarded charge to the Brazilian inside the penalty box. It was childs play for Barreto, who dribbled past a defender and shot it past the helpless Naseem Akhtar. 

 TEAMS 

Mahindra United: Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, Surkumar Singh, Mahesh Gawli, N.S. Manju, Deepak Mondal, Subhas Chakraborty (Hekmat Singh 90), James Singh, Steven Dias, David Adjei (Surojit Bose 41), Yusif Yakubu, Jose Ramirez Barreto. 

East Bengal: Naseem Akhtar, Anupam Sarkar, Covan Lawrence, Marshall, Saumik Dey (Alvito DCunha 81), Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Jayanta Sen, Debabrata Roy, Syed Rahim Nabi, K. Kulothungan, Gouranga Dutta (Sasthi Duley 75). 

Referee: Dinesh Nair (Gujarat). 

 Md. Sp. face Air India 

PTI adds from Margao: Meanwhile, Air India will play an attacking game to garner full points when they take on Mohammedan Sporting at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday. 

Mohammedan Sporting are placed fourth with 10 points. 

Air India, who have drawn all their four matches, have four points.

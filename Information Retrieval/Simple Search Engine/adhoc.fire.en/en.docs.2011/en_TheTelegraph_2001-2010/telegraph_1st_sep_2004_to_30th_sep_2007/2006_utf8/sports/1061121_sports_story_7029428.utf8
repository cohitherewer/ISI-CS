 Verdict on Shoaib, Asif in 3-4 days

 Appeal Against Bans 

Karachi: A Pakistan Cricket Board-appointed drugs appeals committee hearing banned fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, on Monday said it would take at least another three to four days to reach a decision. 

Tribunal head Justice (Retd) Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim said the appeals were a serious matter and required proper scrutiny. 

Today we were able to just discuss the submission of the PCB lawyer Mark Gay which he made at the last hearing, Ebrahim said. 

Shoaib and Asif have appealed against their respective two and one year bans, and after just two hearings of the appeals committee several scenarios are emerging on the possible outcome. 

A lobby supporting the bowlers has indicated that the PCB doctor did not follow procedure while conducting the tests of the two bowlers, and as such, the entire process was illegal under Wada regulations. 

A source also said something like this had been discussed in the hearing when Gays submission was scrutinised. 

I am not in a position to say at this time what the outcome will be but we have to give the players a proper and fair chance to defend themselves. Justice has to be done, he said. (PTI)

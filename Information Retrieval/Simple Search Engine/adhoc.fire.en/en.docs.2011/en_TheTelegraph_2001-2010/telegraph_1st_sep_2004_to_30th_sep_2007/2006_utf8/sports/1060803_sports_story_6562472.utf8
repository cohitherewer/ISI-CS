 Farhat out with injury

 - THIRD TEST 

 - Butt, Umar in contention

Leeds: Pakistan batsman Imran Farhat is set to miss the third Test after sustaining a finger injury during Englands 120-run win in the second match of the four-Test series at Old Trafford. 

Opening batsman Farhat broke his right ring finger while taking a catch to dismiss Kevin Pietersen and Pakistan coach bob Woolmer played down his chances of appearing in the third Test, which starts at Headingley here on Friday. 

Imran Farhat is struggling to field and he is unlikely to come into contention for selection, Woolmer said on Wednesday. 

At Old Trafford, wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal was promoted to open but managed just four in each innings as England went 1-0 up in the four-Test series with a crushing victory inside three days. 

Pakistan could now recall Salman Butt, dropped at Old Trafford while fellow opener Taufeeq Umar, a late addition to the squad, is also in contention. 

We will consider the opening partnership. Weve just got to play better than we did last time, Woolmer added. 

And the former England allrounder admitted he was also looking at changing the composition of Pakistans attack. 

In Manchester the tourists went in with two leg-spinners in Shahid Afridi and Danish Kaneria. 

But for a match at Headingley, where in the last 10 years only one frontline England spinner has taken a Test wicket (left-armer Ashley Giles dismissing Rahul Dravid in 2002), Woolmer said pakistan were contemplating playing four quicks and just one spinner. 

Kamrans done it before (open the innings) and it allowed us to play both Afridi and Kaneria on that pitch. If we batted anything like they would have been very useful. 

We would probably go in here with four seamers I should think, or close to that. 

It looks a much better surface than Ive ever seen at Leeds, added Woolmer.

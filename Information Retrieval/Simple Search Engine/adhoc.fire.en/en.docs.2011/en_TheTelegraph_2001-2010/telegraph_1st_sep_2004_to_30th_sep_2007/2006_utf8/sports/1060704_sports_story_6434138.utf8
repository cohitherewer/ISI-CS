 Real polls under review

Madrid: Former club director Ramon Calderon has won the vote to become Real Madrids next president, according to official figures, but the result has been sent for a judicial review due to an objection from another candidate, the club announced on Monday. 

The 55-year-old lawyer was not declared the official winner of Sundays vote because of doubts over whether or not postal votes should be counted. (AFP)

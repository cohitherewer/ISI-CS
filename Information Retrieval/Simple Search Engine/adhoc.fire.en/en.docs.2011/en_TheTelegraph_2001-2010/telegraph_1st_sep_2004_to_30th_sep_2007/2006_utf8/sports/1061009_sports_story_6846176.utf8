 Randhawa, Kapur miss cut

St Andrews: Shiv Kapur and Jyoti Randhawa failed to make the three-round cut as they managed six-over 221 each at the Alfred Dunhill Links golf championships. 

Randhawa, playing his third round here, shot an even par 72, but it still left him way of even par-215. Kapur shot a four-over 76 at the windy Kingsbarns and also ended at six-over 215 and in tied-121st place. 

The tournament is played on three courses, par-72 St Andrews, par-71 Carnoustie and par-72 Kingsbarns and the cut is applied after three rounds. 

Randhawa had two birdies and two bogeys and paid the price for his first round front nine of six-over 42 and the quadruple bogey on 18th on second day. Kapur fired three birdies, but had seven bogeys in his 76 after first two days of 74 at St Andrews and even par 71 at Carnoustie. 

At the end of the third round, Bradley Dredge remained in front, but he is just one clear of Irish Ryder Cup player Padraig Harrington.

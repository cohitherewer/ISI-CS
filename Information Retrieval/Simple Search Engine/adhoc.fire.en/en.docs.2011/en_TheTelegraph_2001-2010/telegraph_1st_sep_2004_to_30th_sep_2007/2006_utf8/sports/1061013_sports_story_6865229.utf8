 Pak want Hair out of WI series

Karachi: Pakistan will soon write to the International Cricket Council (ICC) asking it not to appoint controversial umpire Darrell Hair for their home series against the West Indies next month as they could not guarantee his safety. 

We dont think the ICC would be naive enough to name him as an umpire for the series so soon after The Oval Test fiasco but we just want to be sure, a senior official of the Pakistan Cricket Board said. 

The ICC has so far not responded to our focal demand but we want some action taken against Hair, the official said. 

India had also urged ICC not to appoint Hair for the Champions Trophy saying his presence could lead to crowd trouble. 

However, the West Indies might start their tour of Pakistan a week earlier if they do not make it to the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy in India. 

The West Indies board has asked their Pakistani counterparts to arrange a four-day practice game for their team if they fail to qualify for the knockout stage of the tournament.

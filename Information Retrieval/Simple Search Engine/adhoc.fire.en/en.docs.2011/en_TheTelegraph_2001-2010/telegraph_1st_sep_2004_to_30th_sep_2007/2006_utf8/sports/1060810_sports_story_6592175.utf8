 Kapur lone Indian in Dutch meet

 European Open

 Zandvoort (The Netherlands): 

 After a weeks break, Shiv Kapur is back on the 

 European Tour with a sponsors invitation to play the 

 KLM Open tournament at the Kennemer Golf and Country Club.

 Kapur will be the lone Indian 

 as Jyoti Randhawa takes a break and Jeev Milkha Singh plays 

 in US this week.

 The promising youngster, currently 

 107th on the money list in Europe with euros 178,811 from 

 17 starts, collected his best European cheque two weeks 

 ago when he was tied 22nd at Deutsche Bank Players 

 Championship in Hamburg.

 Kapur has missed just three cuts 

 in 17 starts and his best has been a tied seventh in Indonesia 

 Open.

 Kapur has been paired with Paul 

 Dwyer and Malcolm McKenzie, both of whom are struggling 

 to keep a card for 2007. Dwyer has made just five cuts in 

 21 starts with tied eighth at AA St Omer Open as his best 

 this season.

 McKenzie has made three cuts in 

 eight starts. At the top, with only five events left to 

 earn a place on the 2006 European Ryder Cup team, the qualifying 

 race is hotting up.

 Irelands Paul McGinley and 

 Englands Paul Broadhurst are among those hoping to 

 do well and gain a place for the event at the K Club.

 McGinley is currently tenth and 

 last for the automatic qualifying places and this week the 

 Dubliner will be looking to consolidate his place.

 Colin Montgomerie will be returning 

 to a tournament that he won in 1993 at Noordwijkse. Spains 

 Gonzalo Fernandez-Casta1o defends the title he won at Hilversumsche 

 Golf Club 12 months ago.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC continues to grope in the dark

 - In a U-turn, Saturdays Executive Board meeting in Dubai gets cancelled 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The International Cricket 

 Council (ICC) continues to grope in the dark, unable to 

 handle the potentially very destructive Pakistan versus 

 Darrell Hair showdown. 

In fact, from the time Match Referee Mike Procter didnt intervene at The Oval last Sunday, it has cut a sorry figure. 

A Match Referee is the ICCs man on-the-spot. 

The latest decision (cancelling the Executive Board meeting in Dubai on Saturday), bearing president Percy Sonns signature, diminished the world bodys standing even more. 

It came some 72 hours after the meeting with a single-point agenda of giving an update to members was announced. Now, a host of administrators, including Indias Inderjit Singh Bindra, must make other plans for the weekend! 

Sonns statement justifying the cancellation was released late on Monday, but having a legal background, he ought to have realised the implications three days ago. 

To say the original intention was to seek legal advice concerning the Executive Boards powers, but I do not believe it is necessary to obtain that advice. We have processes in place to deal with Code of Conduct matters and we should not seek to interfere with it reflects poorly on him and the ICC. 

Wasnt anybody aware of the processes till this embarrassing U-turn was set in motion? 

If not Sonn, then what about chief executive Malcolm Speed? Or the ICCs legal team? 

Its not that Code of Conduct breaches havent been deliberated by the Executive Board (which comprises the ten Test-playing nations and, by rotation, three Associates). 

Indeed, back in 2001-02, the Port Elizabeth Test fiasco featuring Mike Denness and India was taken to that level by a determined Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Talking of processes, usually, disciplinary hearings are held within 24 hours of any breach being reported. 

The ICC, however, scheduled captain Inzamam-ul Haqs five days after he was reported (for ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute) and, then, postponed it when adjudicator Ranjan Madugalle expressed his inability to reach London in time to chair the hearing. 

 It ought to be a priority, but 

 even now, theres uncertainty. No date has been 

 fixed, an ICC spokesman told The Telegraph 

 from Dubai. 

Its bizarre. 

The world bodys handling of the e-mail component of the controversy actually, the cricket fraternity constantly seems to have a problem with e-mails hasnt earned it very many friends either. 

The trading of charges between Hair and the ICC hasnt, after all, made for pleasant reading. 

One expects a world body to be decisive, to control events. Over the past nine days, in particular, the ICC has come across as one wanting others to provide solutions. 

 Its a pity.

 THE PERCY SONN STATEMENT

 Last week I felt it necessary 

 to call a meeting of the Board of Directors to brief them 

 on the end to the Test match at The Brit Oval and subsequent 

 events. That meeting was due to take place this coming Saturday. 

 However, having had the chance to contact the directors 

 and seeing they have an understanding of the situation I 

 have decided this course of action is not necessary so I 

 have decided to cancel the meeting. 

 I sent each Director a note last 

 Friday and will telephone each of them over the next couple 

 of days to further explain what has happened over the past 

 week and ensure they understand the process from here onwards. 

 There has been much speculation over the past few days about 

 whether the Executive Board has the power to overturn a 

 properly laid charge by the umpires. 

 That speculation would only be 

 bound to intensify ahead of the weekend and so by cancelling 

 the meeting it will allow everyone to get off that particular 

 topic and focus on the cricket to be played this week instead. 

 The original intention was to 

 seek legal advice concerning the Executive Boards 

 powers, but I do not believe it is necessary to obtain that 

 advice. We have processes in place to deal with Code of 

 Conduct matters and we should not seek to interfere with 

 it. 

 PCB CHAIRMAN SHAHARYAR 

 KHANS REACTION

 We understand the need for the 

 hearing to go ahead for the reasons explained by ICC president 

 Mr Sonn. In the meantime, we are delighted at the chance 

 to get back to playing cricket, starting with Mondays 

 NatWest Twenty20 international against England and five 

 one-day Internationals to follow.

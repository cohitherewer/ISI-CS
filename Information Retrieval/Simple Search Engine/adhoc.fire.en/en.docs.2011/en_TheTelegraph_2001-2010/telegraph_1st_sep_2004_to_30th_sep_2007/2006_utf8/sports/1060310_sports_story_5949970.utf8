The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI hurls fresh allegations at Dalmiya

 - 3-man panel set up to look into financial irregularities 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Bindra 

Chandigarh: The war of words between Jagmohan Dalmiya and the ruling group in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) doesnt show any signs of ending in a hurry. A day after a Calcutta court put a stay on the showcause notice on the former Board president (we will contest it, announced vice-president Lalit Modi), Dalmiya was besieged by another fresh set of allegations. 

Inderjit Singh Bindra, a former president himself and a key member of the present regime, and Modi at a press conference again alleged Dalmiya with embezzlement of funds during his tenure. The occasion was to announce completion of hundred days of Team Pawar and its achievements, but turned out to be another stage for ridiculing Dalmiya. 

We are enquiring into various transactions during that period. An amount of Rs 1.5 crore, as shown in the annual accounts, has been spent on whitewash of Eden Gardens during the platinum jubilee celebration match against Pakistan. Another Rs 26 lakh was spent on entertainment during the one-day tournament in Holland before the Champions Trophy. 

We are also trying to get details on hearsay that lawyer Usha Nath Banerjee made more money than Rahul Dravid. Apparently another Rs 52 lakh was paid to some historian for writing a biography on Dalmiya, the allegations flowed thick and fast. 

Modi took strong exception to Dalmiyas remark that the current Board had a vested interest in awarding TV rights to Nimbus. Let me just remind you it was done through a transparent process. The bids were scrutinised and then opened in front of everybody, Modi stated. 

During the last four years, whenever we bid the Board suffered losses. This has been mainly because of upmanship of one particular gentleman. But this time we are raking in Rs 2780 crore. 

On the Pilcom controversy, Bindra said: As president of the Board, I had never approved the minutes of the annual general meeting. Maybe, the only instance in the history of the Board? The three-member committee (consisting of Modi, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and treasurer N. Srinivasan) that has been formed will go into each and every detail. Till then, we will keep quiet. 

Dalmiya has said that the Indian Overseas Bank Account in Calcutta was an imprest account. Unfortunately, I havent heard of any imprest account running into Rs 50 crore. 

Modi said that he was open to any live face-to-face interaction with Dalmiya. There hasnt been any response from the other end, he countered. 

Meanwhile, the Board also unveiled its plans to call tenders for India-Pakistan matches outside both countries starting with the ones in Abu Dhabi. The government clearance for the Abu Dhabi ties next month was received Wednesday. 

The infrastructure development committee,which includes Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and Ravi Shastri among others, will also look into increasing match fee for domestic players and enhancing A tours among other things.

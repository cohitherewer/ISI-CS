Rio de Janeiro: Brazil and Barcelona forward Ronaldinho wept with emotion as he unveiled his foundation in his home town of Porto Alegre on Wednesday. 

This is the most emotional moment of my life, he said in a speech to a 400-strong audience, which included local politicians and Brazil coach Dunga, who is also from the region. 

Ive always dreamed of something like this and today Im seeing it finally happen. This is the best goal Ive ever scored, its an unforgettable day. 

The Ronaldinho Instituto is designed to cater for up to 3,500 children and will offer sporting activities and courses in computing, theatre, music and languages. 

Ronaldinho was brought up in Porto Alegre, capital of Brazils southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, and began his playing career with local club Gremio. 

Ten days ago Ronaldinho was on the losing side when Barcelona were defeated by Internacional, the citys other major club and arch-rivals of Gremio, in the final of the club World Championship in Japan. 

While soccer will be emphasised, other sports will also be offered, along with classes in theatre, dance, languages, and computer science. 

If the school produces new soccer stars, that would be great, but its not the point, said Roberto de Assis, Ronaldinhos brother, who will run the school. 

The purpose of the institute is to give an opportunity for these youths growth, de Assis said. 

Ronaldinho should reportedly receive Spanish citizenship next year, making him eligible to appear for Barcelona as a European Union player.

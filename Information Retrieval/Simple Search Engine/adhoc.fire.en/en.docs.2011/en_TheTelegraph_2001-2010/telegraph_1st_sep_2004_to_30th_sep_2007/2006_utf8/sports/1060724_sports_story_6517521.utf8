 Drama at Nelson home

Roanoke (Texas): A package sent to the home of golf legend Byron Nelson was detonated by a bomb squad after his wife and police believed the parcel looked suspicious. 

The contents turned out to include banners from the Masters and a letter, Roanoke Fire Department chief Mike Duncan said. He said Nelsons wife, Peggy, called police on Friday after deciding the writing on the package looked peculiar and noticing the postage had not been cancelled. 

Remains from the package were given to police, but Duncan said nothing appeared criminal. 

Nelson, 94, won five majors in his career and had one of the greatest years in golf history when he won 18 tournaments in 1945. (AP)

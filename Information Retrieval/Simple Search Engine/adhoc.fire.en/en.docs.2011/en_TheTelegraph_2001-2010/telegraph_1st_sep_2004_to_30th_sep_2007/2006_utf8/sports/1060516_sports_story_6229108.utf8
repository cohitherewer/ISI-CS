London: Sri Lanka negotiated one of the great escapes on Monday by batting through the final day to draw the first Test against England at Lords. 

The Sri Lankans, forced to follow on after scoring only 192 in reply to Englands first innings score of 551 for six declared, extended their overnight second innings total of 381 for six to 537 for nine, when bad light stopped play. It was the highest second innings score ever recorded at Lords. 

No.10 Nuwan Kulasekara, who had a previous best of 13 from two previous Tests, batted with the assurance of a veteran to score 64 during a stint of more than three hours at the crease. 

He hit seven fours and lofted left-arm spinner Monty Panesar into the Tavern stand for two sixes during a partnership of 105 with Chaminda Vaas (50 ..), a Sri Lankan ninth wicket record against all countries. 

Tillekeratne Dilshan scored 69, also consuming three hours of precious time, and 19-year-old debutant Chamara Kapugedera scored only 10 but occupied the crease for just under an hour. 

England were again badly let down by their fielding, grassing two simple catches and one harder chance, to add to their six previous misses. 

Captain Andrew Flintoff also appeared to rotate his bowlers by numbers and continued to employ conventional field settings when the situation cried out for more pressure to be placed on the tailenders.

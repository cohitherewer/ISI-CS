 Mary Ann faces Akateava

Yerevan (Armenia): Women Grandmaster Tania Sachdev will have a tough assignment on hand against Mongontuul Bathuyag of Mongolia in the eighth round of the world junior girls chess championship on Wednesday. 

After the first seven rounds, Tania, Bathuyag and Melia Salome of Georgia are on joint lead with 5.5 points, followed by top seed Hou Yifan of China and Tatev Abrahamyan of US with five points each. The eighth round will resume after a rest day on Tuesday. 

Tania has been the pick of the Indians. D. Harika is on joint sixth spot with 4.5 points and needs to score a couple of wins to be nearer or among the leading group. In the eighth round, Harika meets Abrahamyan. 

I am quite happy with the way things have gone so far. Wednesdays game is going to be quite important as Bathuyag is quite a tough player, said Tania. 

Among boys, Deepan Chakravarthy is back in reckoning for a medal with two fine victories after he lost a winning position against GM Pantsulaia Levan. In the next round, Deepan meets Arman Pashikian of Armenia. 

Yuriy Kryvoruchko of Ukraine is leading this section on six points while Deepan is currently joint fifth on 5 points.

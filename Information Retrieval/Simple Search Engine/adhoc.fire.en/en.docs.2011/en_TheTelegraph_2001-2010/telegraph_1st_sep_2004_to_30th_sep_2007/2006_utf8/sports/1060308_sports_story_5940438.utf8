The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 $18 m lost in awarding telecast rights

 - Dalmiyas turn to seek an explanation from BCCI

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya on Tuesday claimed that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had incurred a loss of $ 18 million (around Rs 82 crore) in awarding telecast rights of international matches to be played in India for the next four years to Nimbus Communications (India). 

The former BCCI president, who has been charged with misappropriating $ 4 million via-a-vis the 1996 World Cup TV rights deal by the current regime, said at a press conference that the deal with Nimbus (India) was worth $ 612.18 million, but if the highest bids were to be considered, the board would have received $ 630.27 million. 

Dalmiya, the CAB president, said both Nimbus (India) and Nimbus Sports Pte (Singapore) ??? different companies under the same banner ?? had participated in the bidding process. But Nimbus (India) was awarded the global package (India and international), despite the fact that Nimbus (Singapore) was the highest bidder for the international package. 

Nimbus (India) paid $ 504.09 million for the India package and $ 108.09 million for the international package, whereas Nimbus (Singapore) had quoted an amount of $ 126.18 million for the international package, said Dalmiya. 

According to the tender documents, Nimbus (Singapore) should have been awarded the international package rights. 

Why did BCCI suffer such a huge loss of around Rs 82 crore? Somebody has to answer. Was any undue advantage given to Nimbus (India)? Was any vested interest at work? Dalmiya wondered aloud. 

Dalmiya informed that CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee, in a letter to BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, has asked the board to furnish details of the agreement between Nimbus (India) and BCCI and a copy of the bank guarantee. 

We understand BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi himself had issued clarifications during the tender process that made it clear that maximisation of revenue was the main objective and for this purpose, the bidders were asked to make optimum combinations possible? Mr Modi had indicated at the BCCI working committee meeting on January 23, that for the sole purpose of transparency, the agreement between the winning bidder and the board would be signed within 24 hours, said the letter from the CAB joint secretary. 

The letter also asked: whether the board had signed an agreement with the winning bidder; whether Nimbus (India) has deposited the requisite amount of Rs 200 crore with the board throughout the duration of the agreement; and whether Nimbus (India) has agreed to furnish the rolling bank guarantees. 

I didnt want to come to the media. But six days have gone by and we have received no communication from the parent body. This is what transparency is all about! And this will proceed the same way, said Dalmiya sarcastically. 

Dalmiya said that copies of the letter have been sent to the BCCI working committee members, but none of them responded. 

BCCI is our parent body. We are hopeful we will get the reply. If they do not, we will go back to the working committee, he said, while ruling out any possibility of moving the court. 

Contacted in Chandigarh, former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra ? who has been involved in awarding of contracts ? said: We have been open and transparent in all our dealings. We will be happy to answer the questions raised by Mr Dalmiya, but we also expect him to answer the questions raised by us. This can be done in any TV channel of his choice or in any other public forum he so wishes. 

Dalmiya also mentioned at the press conference that the showcause letter which he received on February 27, didnt mention a single thing on the alleged financial irregularities.

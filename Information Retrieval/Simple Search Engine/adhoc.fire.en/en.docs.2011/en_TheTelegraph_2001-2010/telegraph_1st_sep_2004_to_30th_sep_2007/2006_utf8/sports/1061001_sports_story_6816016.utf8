 Bhupathi gets new partner in Blake

Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathis next partner will be American James Blake. 

The Indian doubles ace will be playing the next three tournaments Stockholm, Madrid Masters and St Petersburg with the man ranked world No. 9 in singles. Blake will be Bhupathis ninth partner since May. 

Bhupathis original plan was to close out the year with Justin Gimelstob, another American, but more of a doubles specialist. Thats because the Indian was seriously thinking of a long-term association with Gimelstob in 2007. 

But with Gimelstob getting injured, Bhupathis plans had to change. Mario Ancic, with whom he won the China Open two weeks ago and continued the partnership this week also, is not the ideal long-term partner for Bhupathi because his singles fortunes are shining bright and wouldnt play as much doubles as the Indian would want him to. 

I may be playing with Mario in the Paris Masters, though, Bhupathi said. 

A former world No. 1 with four mens doubles Grand Slam titles under his belt, Bhupathi has had a tough time getting the right partner after splitting with Wesley Moodie. He and the South African who won the 2005 Wimbledon crown with Stephen Huss had planned to play the entire year together, but the results just didnt come.

 Hingis advances

Melbourne: Martina Hingis path to the Australian Hardcourt title cleared dramatically on Thursday when she survived a tough quarter-final and top seed Patty Schnyder was knocked out. 

Hingis was forced into a third set by Spains Nuria Llagostera Vives before running out a 6-2, 4-6, 6-0 winner. 

In the last singles match on centre court, Czech Lucie Safarova then beat Schnyder 6-4, 6-3 to end the Swiss world No. 7s title defence. (Reuters)

 France set up Brazil date

 Hanover: Two late goals 

 from Patrick Vieira and Zinedine Zidane gave France a 3-1 

 win over Spain in the World Cup second-round on Tuesday. 

 Vieira headed in at the far post in the 83rd minute 

 after a free-kick had been deflected towards his own goal 

 by Spains Xabi Alonso. 

Zidane finished things off in style in stoppage time, beating goalkeeper Iker Casillas after a swift counterattack. 

France now meet Brazil in the quarter finals on Saturday. France, written off by many as too old, came back from a goal down. 

Spain had opened the scoring in the 28th minute, striker David Villa firing home from a penalty after Pablo Ibanez had been fouled by Lilian Thuram. 

 France reacted in style four minutes from halftime. 

 Franck Ribery raced on to a fine through ball from Vieira 

 and rounded keeper Casillas to score his first goal for 

 France.

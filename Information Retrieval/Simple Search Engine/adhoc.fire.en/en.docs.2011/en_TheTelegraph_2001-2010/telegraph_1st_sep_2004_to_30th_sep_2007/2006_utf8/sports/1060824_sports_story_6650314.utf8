 Injured Kumble to return home

 - Kartik in short-term deal with Lancs 

 Anil Kumble 

London: Ace Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble is cutting short his Surrey stint and returning home on Friday after being diagnosed with tendonitis in right shoulder. 

In another development, left-arm spinner Murali Kartik has signed a short-term contract with Lancashire and will play his first match on Saturday against Sussex in the C amp;G Trophy final. 

Announcing Kumbles injury on Wednesday, the Surrey County Cricket Club said: Kumble has been diagnosed with tendonitis in right shoulder, which can only recover with rest. It is for this reason that he will be returning home this Friday and as such will be taking no further part in the remainder of Surreys season. 

Kumble, who reported to the Brit Oval on July 18, played in three Liverpool Victoria County Championship matches, three NatWest pro40 matches and two Twenty20 matches for Surrey. 

Altogether, Kumble took 26 wickets, which included the match-winning figures of 11 for 183 against Northamptonshire at the Brit Oval. 

Meanwhile, Kartik will play in a floodlit Twenty20 match between Lancashire and England at Old Trafford on Thursday. 

The Indian, who took 16 wickets in two matches for the County to help secure promotion to the first division last season, will be their second overseas player for the next fortnight, during which he will also play a four-day match against Warwickshire next Wednesday. The Railways players will replace Brad Hodge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lynette is doing just fine: Steve

 - Post-brain surgery in Sydney 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Steve Waugh and wife Lynette 

Calcutta: She (wife Lynette) is doing just fine Thank you for this call, was the iconic Steve Waughs response when The Telegraph got in touch with him on Thursday afternoon. 

Lynette, it may be recalled, is recovering from brain surgery in Sydney. 

Being flooded with calls from well-wishers across the globe, Steve said he had consciously decided to have medical bulletins issued periodically. That way, everybody is informed and nobody is kept in the dark, he remarked. 

Indeed, a couple of hours later, his manager e-mailed the latest one, jointly issued by Steve and Dr Charles Teo, the surgeon entrusted with Lynettes care. 

It read: 

Lynettes recovery is very pleasing. So far all investigations into the cause of the haemorrhage have been negative. There are still a few investigations to be carried out. 

Dr Teo suspects the most likely scenario was a spontaneous haemorrhage and one that, hopefully, wont reoccur in the future. 

The Waugh family would again like to acknowledge the support, goodwill and encouragement from the public and the media. It is greatly appreciated.

 Smith to miss Lanka tour

Durban: Captain Graeme Smith could be sidelined for up to 12 weeks following ankle surgery, Cricket South Africa (CSA) said on Thursday. 

Smith, who tore ligaments while out running on Saturday, will miss the tour to Sri Lanka starting later this month when Ashwell Prince will captain in the two Test matches. 

Jacques Rudolph, who is playing league cricket in Lancashire, will replace Smith in the squad. 

The stress X-ray conducted by an ankle specialist in Pretoria confirmed that Graeme had torn two ligaments on the lateral side of his ankle, the release quoted squad physiotherapist Shane Jabaar as saying. 

He will wear a cast for a period of six weeks. Graeme will be out for a period of eight to 12 weeks depending on rehabilitation. 

Smith said: After all the hard work put in during the pre-season it is unfortunate that I had to sustain this injury. (Reuters)

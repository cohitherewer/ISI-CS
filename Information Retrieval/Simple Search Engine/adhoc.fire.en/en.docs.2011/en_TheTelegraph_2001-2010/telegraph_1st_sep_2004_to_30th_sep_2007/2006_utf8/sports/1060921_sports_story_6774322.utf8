 ICC scotches reports on Hair

 - Hair should also be penalised if Inzy is banned: Akram 

London: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has dismissed reports of controversial umpire Darrell Hair officiating in the Champions Trophy in India as pure speculation. This is pure speculation. We aim to confirm the umpire in the next day or so, ICC was quoted as saying in a British television channel. 

Hair told an Australian newspaper that he is ready to officiate in the Champions Trophy. Yes I am down to umpire in the Champions Trophy and I expect to fulfil that appointment, Hair said. 

The Austrlian has not officiated in any match since his controversial decision of penalising the Pakistan team for ball tampering, which led to first forfeiture in the 129-year history of Test cricket. 

Meanwhile, Wasim Akram on Wednesday said Hair should also be penalised if Inzamam is banned for his role in The Oval Test fiasco. 

Hair has not only been a controversial umpire now but he has been controversial in the past as well, and I think he should also be penalised if Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is banned, Wasim said. (PTI)

 Houghton rues drop of level after early thrust

 - Saudi Arabia wallop India 7-1 at home 

 Houghton

Jeddah: Bob Houghton lamented that India could not maintain a high level for the entire duration of their match against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday evening. The hosts wallopped India 7-1 in their AFC Asian Cup qualifying encounter. 

We went head-to-head with the Saudis for the first half hour, but after getting the second goal they totally dominated the match, the Englishman said. 

India stunned their higher-ranked rivals by taking the lead through defender N.S. Manju in the 22nd minute. The Saudis didnt take long in equalising and went ahead before half-time. 

The hosts came out all guns blazing in the second half and found the Indian net five times. 

Houghton pointed out the quality of the opposition India faced in the group A of the qualification campaign. 

This was a very tough group for us because we had to face two of the strongest teams in Asia. 

India, who had gone down 0-3 to Saudi Arabia in Calcutta last month despite putting up a good show, next face Asian champions Japan in Bangalore on October 11. Japan had won the first leg game 6-0 in Yokohama. 

Japan and Saudi Arabia are about equal. The Japanese are good in the box and have good movement around the pitch while the Saudis are stronger in terms of fitness and concentration, Houghton said. 

Houghton also noted that Marcos Paquetas side had improved considerably since the World Cup finals in Germany, where they were eliminated in the first round itself with two losses and a draw. 

After watching the Saudi Arabia versus Japan match (on September 3), I told some of my friends if they had played like that during the World Cup, they might have achieved something. 

Apart from their other qualities, their determination was also one of the factors that helped them win against Japan, Houghton observed. 

Paqueta said that Manjus early goal acted as a wake-up call for his team. 

The win helped the hosts seal a spot in the finals to be held in Indonesia, Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam next year. 

It was a positive thing for my team when the Indian team scored first, because it helped my players appreciate the importance of the game, the Brazilian said. 

The most important thing is that we achieved the three points that secured qualification to the finals. 

He admitted that his players were not at their best in the opening 45 minutes. 

I admit that we gave a poor show in the first half but the players regained their concentration in the second and we played very well, he said. 

 It was a tough game for 

 us because we only had a short time between this match and 

 our game against Japan on Sunday. Also the temperature (38 

 degrees Celsius) did not help both teams.

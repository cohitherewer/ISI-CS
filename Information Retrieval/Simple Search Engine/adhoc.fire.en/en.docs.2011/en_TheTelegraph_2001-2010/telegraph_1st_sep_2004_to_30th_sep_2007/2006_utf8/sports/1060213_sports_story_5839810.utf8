The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We must pull together as a unit: Hoggard 

London: Matthew Hoggard has insisted players and fans alike must consign last years Ashes success to the history books during the upcoming tour of India. 

Moving on from that thrilling win ? their first Test series triumph over Australia in 17 years ? has so far proved difficult for England. 

Their subsequent Test campaign in Pakistan ended in a 0-2 defeat in December before memories of the Ashes were revived Thursday when the entire squad met Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to receive the medals theyd been awarded in the New Years Honours list in recognition of defeating Australia. 

But Hoggard stressed: You cant live on the past. Yes, we had a great summer and weve put cricket in the limelight, but weve got to keep it there by putting in the performances and keeping winning. 

We didnt do that in Pakistan so were looking to put that right in India, added the swing specialist as he contemplated a nine-week tour featuring three Tests and seven one-day Internationals. 

Pakistan was a big learning curve for us, Hoggard said. Having more or less the same squad from Pakistan should help because we can take that experience over to India and pull together as a unit.

 Dravid: We have full faith in Harbhajan

 - Laxman has always been part of our plans 

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid believes off spinner Harbhajan Singh will get wickets in the final Test against England starting on Saturday, in what is also the Indian captains 100th Test appearance. 

Harbhajan has been under pressure since the tour of Pakistan earlier this year where he failed to claim a wicket in the two Tests he played before missing the one-day series owing to a finger injury. 

I think, sometimes, in India we get too impatient with the spinners, especially when playing at home, because we are used to them getting wickets all the time, Dravid said on Wednesday. 

The off spinner took only three wickets in the first two Tests against England and looked largely ineffective but the captain was confident that he would strike in the last. 

I thought he bowled well in Mohali, though he didnt have the luck to get many wickets. Hes a top-class performer. 

Dravid, who will become only the sixth Indian to play in 100 Tests after Kapil Dev, Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble, also felt visiting teams had begun to play spinners better lately. 

You have to accept that. They come here a lot more often and are getting used to playing spin well. But we have full faith in Harbhajan. He has always done well in Mumbai and this will be the Test match I think. 

Dravid dismissed talk that middle-order batsman V.V.S. Laxman was in danger of losing his place to younger blood. 

 Laxman has been playing 

 continuously for the last five, six years and has always 

 been part of our plans, Dravid said.

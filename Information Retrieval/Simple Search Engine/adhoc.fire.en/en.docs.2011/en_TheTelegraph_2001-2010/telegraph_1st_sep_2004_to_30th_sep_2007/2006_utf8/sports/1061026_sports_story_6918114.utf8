Chandigarh: Wednesday saw Stephen Fleming lead New Zealand for the 194th time in ODIs, a record which wont be broken in a hurry. In fact, as hes going strong, Fleming will be adding to that. Among those who saw history live, in neighbouring Mohali, was former New Zealand captain Jeremy Coney. The 54-year-old, who led in 15 Tests (five wins) and 25 ODIs (eight wins) between 1984-87, spoke to The Telegraph almost exclusively on Fleming. Coney is in India for TV duty. 

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On Flemings record

 Stephen deserves to be warmly 

 congratulated for longevity... New Zealand have now played 

 500 ODIs and he has led in 194 of them... Its awesome... 

 He has gone through a lot and has been captain at a time 

 New Zealand havent had a really world class team... 

 It hasnt been easy, but Stephen has remained phlegmatic... 

 Besides developing as a leader, he has learnt to handle 

 the variables of the game... Over a period of time, then, 

 he has become very astute... I think he has handled his 

 resources exceedingly well... Stephen has experienced highs 

 like beating England in England (1999) but has had his 

 share of the lows. 

 On his reaction when Fleming 

 got the captaincy in early 1997 

 I didnt know much about 

 Stephen and certainly didnt know him as a person (then)... 

 However, I expected him to grow into the position and he 

 did... He must have been anxious on getting the job at such 

 a young age (23). 

 On what makes Fleming 

 stand out as a captain

 His equanimity... He practises 

 diligently and hard... He gets along with people... He gets 

 the best out of his players and they, in turn, like working 

 for him... The players want to play for Stephen... 

 Playing for a number of sides, on the County circuit and 

 elsewhere, has definitely helped him make the most of the 

 resources... The experience of interacting with different 

 personnel has been a boon... Hes probably disappointed 

 that, because of injuries, Shane Bond hasnt been as 

 much of a factor as he couldve been... (After a 

 pause) As a batsman, Stephen has the natural flair for 

 playing the ball... He opens in ODIs and goes at No. 3 in 

 Tests, but I believe hes best suited going to bat 

 at No. 4... At that position, he wont find the ball 

 moving in the air that much. 

 On what makes a captain 

 stand out

 (Laughs) A good team! I 

 was lucky in that I had Richard Hadlee and Martin Crowe... 

 One could get some wickets, the other runs... Both were 

 world class... A captain has to stay in the 

 present and look ahead... He should be able to evaluate 

 the opposition technically and, most important, not be afraid 

 to take decisions... A captain must not postpone decision-making 

 because it may not look good at that point in time... Stephen 

 has learnt to take tough decisions and grasps the moments 

 when risks have to be taken... A captain should allow his 

 players to be themselves... Give the freedom to express 

 themselves. 

 On the support available 

 to captains nowadays 

 Its big, of course... Computer 

 analysts, video tapes... Other staff... 

 On Daniel Vettori being 

 groomed to succeed Fleming 

 Thats the impression and, 

 whenever it happens, the transition will be easy... I reckon 

 Stephen can continue for a couple of years. 

 On Fleming having a hand 

 in Vettoris grooming 

 Only a secure person would encourage 

 a teammate to develop as a leader... Fleming, to my mind, 

 is going to be remembered as a very thoughtful captain... 

 Standing in slips, he doesnt give anything away... 

 Indeed, he has the mariners gaze... Looking at the 

 horizon and charting the course... 

 On whether captains have 

 a shelf life

 Ive heard of that theory... 

 Frankly, Im not sure... 

 On whether, because of 

 being the perennial underdogs, New Zealands captains 

 develop a complex 

 Well, because of the inconsistency, 

 it gets frustrating... The team in India, though, is quite 

 experienced and the players just have to be consistent... 

 After a good win, complacency seems to set in. Incidentally, 

 as many as nine in the Champions Trophy squad play for one 

 County or the other... (Again, after a pause) A captain 

 cant spoon-feed players... He cant play shots 

 for his batsmen... Cant take wickets for his bowlers 

 either... Stephen, surely, has gone through much frustration. 

 On his own moments of 

 frustration (as New Zealands captain)

 Every captain would like his team 

 to do better... To improve... Over the years, fitness has 

 been a big issue in our cricket... Stephen, for example, 

 has had worries over Bond... Over Scott Styris... And, not 

 too long ago, Chris Cairns... New Zealands biggest 

 problem is that we dont have a large base from where 

 to quickly summon replacements. 

 On whether he looked up 

 to any captain

 Bruce Taylor, who led Wellington... 

 He was a gambler and went about his job instinctively... 

 He would place fielders in somewhat strange positions, but 

 things happened. 

 On his style of captaincy

 I tried to include 

 players, get ideas from them... Yes, I was democratic, but 

 to a point... I allowed players to be themselves... In the 

 first year or so, I wasnt trusting my own decisions 

 enough... That changed as I grew into the job... It helped 

 that I had a mature team... Often, therefore, the team ran 

 itself... 

 On the finest captain 

 in the past decade

 (Grins) Difficult to answer... 

 I dont wish to be diplomatic, but Ive got to 

 be... Different captains have had different skills... Ive 

 been drawn to captains who havent had many skilled 

 players... The ones whove had the bigger challenges, 

 the ones whove had to innovate... Its easy giving 

 the ball to somebody who gets you four wickets every time. 

 On the relationship between 

 a captain and coach

 Has to be one of trust... Theyve 

 got to build a partnership and get the best out of each 

 other... One could be good at man management, the other 

 strong on tactics and so on... Nobody is a perfect human 

 being... Theyve got to use each other in order to 

 get the best out of the team... Being friends will help. 

 Finally, on Rahul Dravids 

 captaincy 

 Hes growing into the job 

 very well... Hes not an extrovert, but thats 

 not a minus... Sourav Ganguly was a different person and 

 captain, but there wasnt anything wrong with that 

 either...

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fiasco just about avoided

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Bridgetown: Team India captain Rahul Dravid just about avoided unnecessary bad press. There would, after all, have been a controversy had he not returned from the Hilton to the Queens Park Oval in Port-of-Spain, on Sunday evening, for the customary post-match Media conference. 

All of us left as we hadnt been informed about the interaction, manager Ranjib Biswal told The Telegraph. Even if he made his debut during the ODIs, the seasoned Dravid should have known better. 

While both came back, their entry coincided with Brian Lara and Ramnaresh Sarwans Media conference and, so, Dravid had to wait for his turn. Aware that a mix-up had occurred, he began his interaction with an apology. 

The bigger question, however, is: When is the Board going to wake up and appoint full-time professionals to not only manage the team administratively, but take note of the Medias requirements?

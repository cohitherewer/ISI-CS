 Ardelis canters to victory 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: A near 15,000-strong crowd, which thronged the RCTC ground on the New Years Day, returned a happier lot as favourites found the going quite easy in the afternoons eight-event race card. Trainer Vijay Singh, jockey C. Alford and owner Deepak Khaitan became familiar faces in no time for the once-in-an-year visitors, most of whom considered winning on the Day I of the year as a good omen. The jockey-trainer combination pulled off a quadruple of wins for the heavyweight owner.

 If holiday revellers were contended with the bulging pockets, the regular sporting fraternity was awestruck by the scintillating performances of Romantic Fire and Ardelis. The two horses tackled their respective rivals in such a manner that pointed to their being in a different league.

 Romantic Fire won the Calcutta Sprinters Trophy the way the Steinbeck-Allspice five-year-old liked. He is going to be hot-favourite in the rest of his city starts unless his connections have drawn up an ambitious plan in the western or the southern circuit.

 Ardelis went a step too far in his debut appearance. The Razeen-Kolar Gold colt beat a seasoned company in the 1,200m Indian Produce Stakes which is in itself a pointer to a champion in the making. Much like Romantic Fire, the Khaitan-property not only drew away from the field, his jockey Alford also had to apply brakes on the even-money favourite nearly a furlong from home.

 If punters were happy, RCTC, too, had reasons to smile for the biggish crowd, the record cash collections and all-round compliments. The totalisator collected nearly Rs 90 lakh while bookmakers takings were calculated to be little short of Rs 20 lakh.

 More betting terminals had also made it little more easy for the crowd to place bets and the normal complaints about short payments at the totalisators were few. But Subir Das Gupta, manager, business, felt there was always room for improvement. I dont want my paying public cheated. The public must come forward with specific complaints. No matter how small the amount is, Im always available; said Das Gupta.

Colombo: India started their hockey campaign in the SAF Games with a grand note as they pulled off a 2-0 win over arch-rivals Pakistan at the Matale on Monday. 

Raghunath drew first blood for India in the 16th minute by converting a penalty corner while Gurbaj Singh extended the lead in the 61st minute to earn three points for India. On Tuesday, India face hosts Sri Lanka and take on Bangladesh the next day. 

In another match on Monday, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka 1-0. 

Meanwhile, the organising skills of the hosts again came under scanner. An experienced campaigner of the Indian squad, Sandeep Michael on Monday blamed it on the fading light which posed as a hurdle while playing. 

Indian paddlers claimed gold in the mens team event after a scratchy 3-1 victory over Sri Lanka. 

The hosts gave the fancied Indian a scare by taking a 1-0 lead by beating Soumyadeep Roy before Commonwealth Games champion Achanta Sharath Kamal and national champion Subhajit Saha fended off the surprise challenge. 

 Joshna Chinappa won the gold in womens singles squash by defeating compatriot Dipika Pallikal. Chinappa romped home in style with a convincing 9-6, 9-6, 9-1 victory over Pallikal. 

Indian shooters maintained a clean slate to win both the team and individual gold medals besides a bronze in womens 10m air rifle competition. 

Radhika Barale took the top individual honour, besides ensuring the team gold along with Navdeep Kaur Dhillon and Raj Kumari at the Welisara Shooting Range here. 

The rowers signed off in style, capturing three more golds to make a complete sweep of titles in the event on Monday. (PTI)

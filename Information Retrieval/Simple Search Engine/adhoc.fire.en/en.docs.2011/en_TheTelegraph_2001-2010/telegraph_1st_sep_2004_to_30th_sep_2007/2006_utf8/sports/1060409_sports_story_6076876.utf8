The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Spurs emerge 2-1 winners over City

London: Midfielder Michael Carrick guided Tottenham Hotspur to a 2-1 victory over Manchester City that tightened Spurs grip on a place in the Champions League qualifiers on Saturday. 

Canadian defender Paul Stalteri put the hosts in front a minute before halftime at White Hart Lane and Carrick made it 2-0 before Greek forward Georgios Samaras pulled one back for City in the 52nd minute. 

Portsmouth kept alive their hopes of avoiding the drop by snatching a 2-2 draw with Blackburn Rovers, now fifth, while Charlton Athletic were held 0-0 at home by Everton. 

Though southern England basked in spring sunshine, snow denied Fulham a likely first away win of the season at Sunderland. US striker Brian McBride put Fulham ahead before referee Mike Riley called the game off after 21 minutes. 

Victory for Spurs strengthened their hold on fourth place, Englands second slot in the final Champions League qualifying round, by moving them on to 58 points from 33 games. 

Blackburn, on 54 points from 33 games, may yet rue the points dropped at Fratton Park because they have now played two games more than Arsenal, who have 53 points and face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Charlton and Everton remain mid-table and Portsmouth edged closer to survival after their Bulgarian substitute Svetoslav Todorov headed a 78th minute equaliser.

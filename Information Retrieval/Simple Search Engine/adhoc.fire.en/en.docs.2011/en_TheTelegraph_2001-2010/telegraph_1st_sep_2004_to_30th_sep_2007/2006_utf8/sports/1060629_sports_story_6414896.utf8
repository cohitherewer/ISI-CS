 Naved cleared 

Karachi: Pakistan paceman Rana Naved-ul Hasan has been cleared of a major groin injury and could play in the Test series against England, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Wednesday. 

Naved is a member of the squad currently touring England and was initially diagnosed as having a serious groin problem that would require surgery and a recovery period of three months. 

The PCB sent him to England to consult a specialist and get treatment to make him available for the tour.

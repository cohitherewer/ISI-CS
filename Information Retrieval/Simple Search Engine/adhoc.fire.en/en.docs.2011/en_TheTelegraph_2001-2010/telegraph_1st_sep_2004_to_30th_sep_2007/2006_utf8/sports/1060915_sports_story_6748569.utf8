 Jeev Milkha tied 11th

Sapporo (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh shot a three-under 68 and was tied 11th at the end of the first round of the Ana Open at Sapporo Golf Club Wattsu Course here on Thursday. 

Jeev somewhat spoilt what could have been an even better show with two bogeys on back nine. The Chandigarh pros front nine had three birdies on the first, fourth and fifth and an eagle on the par-five ninth, where he reached the green in two. 

But bogeys 10th and 15th caused him to fall back and he was three shots behind leader Chawalit Plaphol of Thailand, who shot a six-under 65. (PTI)

 Ballack fit to play versus Argentina

Berlin: Germany captain Michael Ballack has recovered from a minor foot injury and is fit to play in the World Cup quarter final against Argentina on Friday, coach Juergen Klinsmann said on Monday. 

Ballack missed training on Sunday morning because of the minor knock, and the teams next scheduled training session is not until Tuesday. 

Its all healed. Hes perfectly fit, Klinsmann told a news conference. 

Ballack is of great importance to this team, Klinsmann added. He reads the game well and is prepared to sacrifice himself. He has a key role. 

The captain was forced to sit out Germanys opening 4-2 win over Costa Rica because of a calf injury. Since his return to the midfield, Germany have not conceded a goal in beating Poland 1-0, Ecuador 3-0 and Sweden 2-0. 

Klinsmann quipped that Germany have the strength to beat Argentina and bring their black series against top class opposition to an end. 

It is almost six years since Germany last won over one of the games major powers, a 1-0 victory against England at Wembley in October 2000. 

Klinsmann is now confident that the sequence will come to an end and send the Germans through to the last four. 

Im very optimistic this is going to work out, Klinsmann said. It looks like the time to end this series and get into the semi-finals. 

We are absolutely on a par with the top eight teams in this World Cup, and dont have to be scared of anyone. Argentina are one of the giants, but we will stand up to them. 

Germanys level of fitness has been noticeably higher than that of their opponents in their matches so far. 

They have come out playing a fast, aggressive game, and have scored early in two of the three group matches, against Costa Rica and Ecuador, and again in the commanding 2-0 win over Sweden in the second round on Saturday. 

Were fully fit, and Im sure we wont have to reduce our intensity on Friday at all, Klinsmann said. In fact, were going to step things up. 

Germany have already brought one negative run to an end at this World Cup, when a 1-0 victory over Poland gave them their first win over a fellow European team at the finals of the World Cup or European Championship in 10 years. 

Meanwhile in Herzogenaurach, Argentina expect playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme to escape the markers when they face hosts Germany. 

Argentina needed extra time to overcome Mexico 2-1 in the second round and their struggles were partly due to Riquelme being closely marked and cut off from his fellow midfielders. 

(Opponents) look for him so that he cant wind the Argentina mechanism, said midfielder Maxi Rodriguez, whose superb 25-metre goal settled the Mexico match on Sunday. 

I think hes going to keep getting better, Rodriguez told a news conference. He added that it suited Argentina for teams to attack them, which is exactly what they expect from Klinsmanns team.

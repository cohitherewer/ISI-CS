The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lords, too, being seen as a venue

 - Annual Indo-Pak Fund-Raising ODIs 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chandigarh: Lords 

 hasnt been talked about as a possible venue for the 

 annual fund-raising ODIs between India and Pakistan, but 

 the home of cricket may actually be a host if the England 

 amp; Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has no objection. 

 Informal discussions have 

 been initiated, but the ECB has to feel comfortable... One 

 of the objectives of such matches is to reach out to the 

 Indian and Pakistani expats and, obviously, they will pack 

 Lords, a well-placed source told The Telegraph 

 on Friday. 

According to the source, the Lords initiative has been taken by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and, once the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) agrees, the ECB could be made a partner quot; in that venture. After all, it has to derive some benefit. 

Lords, incidentally, is MCC territory and its response has been favourable. What matters, though, is how the ECB views an Asian fund-raising exercise in England. 

The matches are to be held (by rotation) for five years, with the first set of five ODIs scheduled in the Gulf this year itself ? in the late September-early October window. 

Abu Dhabi is hosting two matches next month, but thats a one-off exercise which shouldnt be confused with the five-year agreement between the BCCI and the PCB. Those fund-raisers are to benefit victims of last Octobers earthquake and the Boards themselves. 

Besides cities in the US, the BCCI and PCB are looking at Toronto, Amstelveen, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Muscat, Dhaka, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur as venues for the annual face-off. London, too. 

 Sharjah can come into consideration if New Delhi gives 

 its okay. The Indians, at least, havent played there 

 after October 2000 ? not since the CBIs report into 

 match-fixing was made public.

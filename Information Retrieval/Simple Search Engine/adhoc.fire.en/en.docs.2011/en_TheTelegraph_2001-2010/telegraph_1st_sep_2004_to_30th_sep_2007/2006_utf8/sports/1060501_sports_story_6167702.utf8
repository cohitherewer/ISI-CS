The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 China blank Germany 5-0

 Thomas amp; Uber cup

 Tokyo: World No. 1 Lin 

 Dan set the early tone as holders China thrashed Germany 

 5-0 to reach the quarter finals of Thomas Cup badminton 

 on Sunday.

 Lin recovered from a sluggish 

 start to beat Bjorn Joppien 22-20, 21-7 in the opening rubber 

 and China completely outclassed their group A opponents 

 in Sendai in the mens team competition.

 China improved to 2-0 after their 

 second straight whitewash to book their place in the knockout 

 stages in Tokyo.

 I think I played better 

 than I did two days ago, Lin said. It took a 

 bit of time to find my rhythm. Once I took the first game 

 it was quite comfortable.

 Lin was anxious to play down talk 

 that China were runaway favourites to retain the title they 

 won two years ago, claiming it was easier to win the womens 

 Uber Cup.

 Its harder to defend 

 this title, he said. Our womens team will 

 find it easier to defend their title. We have some very 

 strong teams in Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea.

 Malaysia illustrated Lins 

 point by blanking England 5-0, even without Asian champion 

 Lee Chong Wei, to make it two out of two in group D and 

 advance to the last eight.

 European power Denmark crushed 

 hosts Japan 5-0 in Group C but 13-times champions Indonesia 

 had to dig deep to beat South Korea 3-2 in group B.

 In the Uber Cup, red-hot favourites 

 China preserved their perfect record with a 5-0 thrashing 

 of Taiwan in Group W.

 The Chinese, led by world No. 

 1 Zhang Ning and No. 2 Xie Xingfang, are bidding for a fifth 

 straight title in the womens competition.

 Japan also secured their spot 

 in the quarter finals after a 5-0 drubbing of New Zealand 

 in Group Z.

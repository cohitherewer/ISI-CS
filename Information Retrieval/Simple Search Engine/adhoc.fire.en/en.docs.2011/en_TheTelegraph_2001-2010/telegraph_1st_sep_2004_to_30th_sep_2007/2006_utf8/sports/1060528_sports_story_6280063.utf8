 Das Munshi and his confusing ways

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The world may change, not the All India Football Federation (AIFF). The AIFF has been synonymous with confusion, and it remains so. 

The latest instance of creating confusion came on Saturday when AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said in Mumbai that another candidate will be interviewed on Sunday before a final decision is taken on appointing the national coach. 

Most of the other AIFF officials said it was almost an open secret that Bob Houghton of England has been decided on as the new coach, but listen to what Das Munshi had to say on Monday: We are awaiting the arrival of a candidate from Portugal by tomorrow (Sunday). We will go through the technical committees report after interviewing him before announcing the new coachs name on Monday. 

Others in the AIFF have no clue as to what Das Munshi is talking about. None of them has any information on the arrival of another foreign candidate. The general feeling is that, this has been done to confuse everyone. The AIFF president had done something similar when Syed Nayeemuddin was shown the door in March. 

The situation was best summed up by an AIFF official, who did not wish to be named. No one knows it better than Das Munshi that no coach is coming to Delhi on Sunday. Moreover, that none of the four shortlisted coaches is from Portugal, he pointed out. 

Interestingly, no technical committee member has been asked to report to Delhi for the so-called interview. 

Repeated attempts to contact AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco bore no fruit, as according to his office staff, he was busy throughout the day meeting Fifa officials.

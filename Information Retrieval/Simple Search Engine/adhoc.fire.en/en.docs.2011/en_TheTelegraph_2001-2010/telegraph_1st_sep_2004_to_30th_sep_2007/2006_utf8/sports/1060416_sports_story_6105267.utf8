Calcutta: India found themselves in a tough group after the draw for the final round of the AFC Youth Championship for the U-20 boys was announced in the city on Saturday. Hosts India are placed in group A with defending champions South Korea, Kyrgyzstan and Jordan. 

The championship assumes added importance as the top four teams will qualify for next years Fifa World Youth Championship to be held in Canada. 

The tournament is the first of its kind ? after the 1982 Asiad ? to be held in the country. Calcutta and Bangalore have been identified as the venues for the meet which will take place from October 29 to November 12. 

Sixteen teams, divided into four groups, will participate in this tournament. All the group A and B matches, including the final and the semi-finals will be held here, while group C and D matches will be held in Bangalore. 

But, according to the deputy general secretary of the AFC, Dato Paul Samuel, Bangalore will only get the final nod after an inspection is carried out by the AFC in May. In case Bangalore fails to qualify, Hyderabad will be considered as an alternative venue. 

The inspection team will ascertain the suitability of the venue on various parameters like accommodation, travel and ground facilities before giving a green signal, Samuel said. 

India will play their opening match against Kyrgyzstan on October 29 at the Salt Lake Stadium and will wrap up their group engagements with a match versus South Korea on November 2 at the same venue. Beside the Salt Lake Stadium, Howrah Municipal Corporation Stadium will also host a couple of matches. 

Meanwhile, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has already chalked out plans to ensure that the Indian team comes up with a good show. A bunch of 30 probables will attend a training camp in Bangalore from May 5. They will then play two practice matches against a visiting Japan team, which would arrive on May 22. 

The AIFF is also planning some exposure trips for the team. Our boys lack big match temperament. So before the big event, we may send them for some exposure trips. If it doesnt work out, then we will look to organise some tournaments before the tournament, said AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco. 

Meanwhile, the AFC deputy general secretary ruled out the fact that they played any role in the exclusion of Indian referee Komleswaran Sankar from the referees panel advised to the Fifa. 

Sankars name was removed from the AFC panel of assistant referees scheduled to go to Frankfurt for a final fitness test from April 18-21. You know the selection of the referees for the World Cup is done by Fifa. So AFC has no role in his exclusion, added the deputy general secretary. 

The draw 

GROUP A: South Korea, India, Kyrgyzstan, Jordan. 

GROUP B: China, Thailand, UAE, Australia. 

GROUP C: Japan, Iran, Tajikistan, North Korea. 

GROUP D: Iraq, Malaysia, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia.

 SHARP SINGLES 

 WI are going to be tough: Clarke 

Mumbai: Australia will have to be at their best to beat the West Indies in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, versatile batsman Michael Clarke said. 

 They are playing good cricket at the moment and are going to be tough to beat, he told reporters on Friday. 

 Australia are aiming to end their Champions Trophy drought in their maiden appearance in the final, after having lost in the semi-final stage in the previous two editions. 

 I think the West Indies have got a lot of fantastic players and have shown that they have played well as a team, the 25-year-old New South Welshman said. 

 They have got the likes of (Brian) Lara, (Chris) Gayle, they have also got some young guys coming on. 

 West Indies handed Australia their only defeat in the group stage, when young pacer Jerome Taylor took a hattrick after Runako Morton (90 not out) and Lara (71) scored half centuries.

 Jeev logged his fifth top-10 finish in seven starts with a one-under 71 on Sunday 

Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singh kept up his impressive streak in Japan, logging his fifth top-10 finish in seven starts with a one-under 71 on the final day of the ?120 million Sega Sammy Cup. 

Jeev totalled a three-under 285 for the week and ended tied fifth to win ?4,560,000 (about $40,000). 

Yeh Wei Tze of Chinese Taipei won the title with a superb finish that saw him birdie the last three holes for a bogey-free six-under 66 and a total of 12-under 276. He registered a four-shot win over Hidemasa Hoshino (69). 

Liang Wen Chong (70) and Yano Azuma (72) were tied for third at four-under followed by Jeev (71) and Chawalit Plaphol (72), who were tied fifth at three-under. 

Jeev said he could have finished still better but for his putting. I wish I had putted better. But I am very happy with my ball striking and overall play, said Jeev, who needed 29 putts on two of the four days and went over 31 putts on the other two. 

Jeev opened the final day with three pars and then birdied the fourth and the eighth to turn at two-under. He bogeyed the 10th and 12th, with a birdie on the 11th. Another bogey on the 15th spoilt his card, before he hauled himself up with a birdie on 17th. 

Jeev equalled his best finish in Japan this year ? he also finished tied fifth at the Japan PGA Championship.

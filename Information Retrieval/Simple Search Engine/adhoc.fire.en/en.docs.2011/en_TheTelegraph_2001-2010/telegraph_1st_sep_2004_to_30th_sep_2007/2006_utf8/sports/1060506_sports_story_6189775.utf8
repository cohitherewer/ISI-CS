 Abu Dhabi: India A stumbled at the post as 

 Pakistan A crushed them for a 36-run victory in the final 

 and won the Eurasia Series six-nation Limited Overs Cricket 

 Tournament on Friday.

 Pakistan, who had lost to their arch-rivals in a league 

 match earlier in the tournament, seemed to have saved their 

 best for last as they outplayed the Indians in all departments 

 of the game to score a memorable win in the day-night encounter 

 at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium.

 Inspired by a captains knock of 106 not out by Hasan 

 Raza, Pakistan posted a challenging 288 for four before 

 dismissing the Indians for 252 with 13 balls to spare.

 India, chasing the daunting target, overcame the cheap loss 

 of its openers through a century stand between skipper Yalaka 

 Venugopal Rao (69) and Reetinder Singh Sodhi (70) for the 

 third wicket.

 But the dismissals of these two batsmen in the space of 

 four balls, in the 40th over, saw the wheels come apart, 

 with the last eight wickets falling for 63 runs.

 Razas sixth List A hundred, from 112 balls with eight 

 fours and a six, laid the foundation for Pakistans 

 win.

 The right-hander reached his century with a stunning six 

 over mid-wicket off Vikram Rajvir Singh in the last over 

 of the innings.

 That final over saw Pakistan plunder 19 runs including two 

 sixes from Raza and the other not out batsman Bazid Khan.

 Raza found valuable support in Misbah-ul Haq who made a 

 vital 73 from 94 balls with four fours and a six. 

 India lost Robin Uthappa (23) and Shikhar Dhawan (17) in 

 quick succession after a solid start of 41 runs inside the 

 10th over.

 The stand between Rao and Sodhi kept the Indian hopes alive 

 but the required run-rate was always climbing up.

 Leg-spinner Mansoor Amjad was expensive in terms of runs 

 but his four wickets broke the back of the Indian batting.

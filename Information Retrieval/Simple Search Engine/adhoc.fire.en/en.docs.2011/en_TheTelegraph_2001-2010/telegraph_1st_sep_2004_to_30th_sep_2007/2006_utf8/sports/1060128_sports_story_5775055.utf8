The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The game needs the Sehwags, says Hanif

 - Former captain Aamer Sohail expects a draw again 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Four former Pakistan captains were among the invitees at a function hosted by the Arabian Sea Country Club chief executive Arif Ali Khan Abbasi on Friday afternoon. The Telegraph sought their views on the third and final Test, which begins on Sunday. Here goes (in order of seniority): 

Hanif Mohammed: I hope theres a decisive result, but its difficult to say who will start as the favourite ... Ive been quite impressed with (Virender) Sehwag... Hes a different type of opener, one who likes going for his shots ... Things were different in our time, but the game needs the Sehwags ... 

Mushtaq Mohammed: Main to dua karun ga ki faisla ho jaye ... Of course, Im not sure how the wicket is going to look and behave ... Frankly, the first two Tests produced pointless cricket ... A repeat wont only harm crickets standing in the country, but reduce the bilateral exchanges to a farce ... The bowlers (Imran Khan and Sarfraz Nawaz to name two) I had in the 1978-79 series were much better than the ones currently in the Pakistan XI. 

Zaheer Abbas: We all know batsmen have dominated. However, whats the point of specialist bowlers when nobody is able to restrict the opposition? Bowlers kis liye khilaye jate hain? Ive been very disappointed with this series and hope that the Karachi Test will see positive play. A positive frame of mind makes a difference ... If Pakistan set out to play safe, they straightaway removed one possibility from the equation ? winning. 

Aamer Sohail: I see another draw ... People are talking of a green top, but wont the grass quickly turn brown with strong sunshine? I dont expect the bowlers to break the trend of the series ? I expect the batters to continue having a ball ... As for the weather having been a factor in the preparation of the wickets, the itinerary could have been planned better ...

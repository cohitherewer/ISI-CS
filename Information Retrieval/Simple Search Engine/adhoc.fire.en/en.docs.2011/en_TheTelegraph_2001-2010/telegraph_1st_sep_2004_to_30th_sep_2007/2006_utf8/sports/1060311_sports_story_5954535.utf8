The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Top Nigerian coach among applicants

 - AIFF vows to recruit a man of stature 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The day after Syed Nayeemuddin and P.K. Banerjee were shown the door, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) claimed that the search for a foreign coach has begun in right earnest, and the new appointee would be a man of stature. 

The AIFF has already received applications from some top coaches like Amodu Shaibu of Nigeria and Ion Ion of Romania. Shaibu guided his country to the Atlanta Olympic gold in 1996. Six years later, the 47-year-old coach took the Super Eagles to the 2002 World Cup finals before being sacked for poor performance in the African Nations Cup. Ion is the former national coach of Romania. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Friday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that on an average, the AIFF receives at least two applications a week, and though all of them are not among world football biggies, there are some famous names among them. He, however, refused to comment on the process of selecting the next coach. Only thing I can say is that we will go to Fifa and bring someone who will be a few notches above our coaches. 

Steve Darby, the current coach of Singapores Home United, is also interested in the India job. Darby made headlines when Home United became the first Singapore club to be nominated for the AFC Club of the Year award. 

Former Brazilian U-20 trainer Toninho Barroso, Gilson Nunes, official technical observer of the Brazilian National team for the 2002 World Cup and Brazilian U-20 assistant coach (1985), Trevor Morgan (Australia), Jacek Bernaskiewicz (Poland) and Karim Bencherifa (Morocco) are also among the applicants. 

The problem is that none of these coaches will come cheap. In the 90s, the federation was forced to settle for coaches who did not demand more than $2,000-2,500 per month, though they spent much more on Indias last foreign coach Stephen Constantine. 

Now, according to sources, the AIFF are in a position to pay $10,000 to $12,000 per month, thanks to their handsome earnings from the sponsors. 

Colaco, however, maintained that neither Nayeemuddin nor PK have been sacked. As on today, they still remain the national coach and the manager. We only decided to reorganise the technical team. The media interpreted it the other way.

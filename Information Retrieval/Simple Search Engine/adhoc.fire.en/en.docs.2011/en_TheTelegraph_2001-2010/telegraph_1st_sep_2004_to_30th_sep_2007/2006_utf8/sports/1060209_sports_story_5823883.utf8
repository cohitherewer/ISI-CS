 Sania scalps 6th seed Pennetta

 - PARIS OPEN Indian to face Golovin in Round Two 

 Russias Elena Dementieva makes a backhand return to Sofia Arvidsson of Sweden in Paris on Wednesday 

Paris: Sania Mirza was back at her best as she shocked sixth seed Flavia Pennetta of Italy in straight sets in the first round of the $600,000 Paris Indoor Open. 

After storming through the first set, Sania made a sluggish start in the start and trailed 2-5. But the spirited Indian came back strongly to close out the match 6-2, 7-6 (7-5). 

Fifth seed Elena Dementieva of Russia gave Swede Sofia Arvidsson a lesson, winning their first-round clash 6-2, 6-2. 

In an all-French second-round battle, Emilie Loit saw off Stephanie Foretz 6-0, 6-3. 

Sania will next face local favourite Tatiana Golovin. I hope to avenge my loss to her in Japan in October, said the 32nd-ranked Sania. 

It is always a great feeling to beat a quality player and the win over sixth-seeded Pennetta is one of my big ones. The fact that Pennetta was in good form in Australia and that she has beaten the likes of Martina Hingis make the victory even sweeter. 

The 19-year-old Indian, after a fairytale 2005 when she rose nearly 150 spots in the WTA rankings, had an ordinary start this season ? losing in the first round of the Sydney event and second round of the Australian Open in the second round last month. 

She also took a week off to rest her left knee that has been troubled by tendinitis. 

Golovin, meanwhile, qualified in style for the second round, taming Polands Marta Domachowska 6-0, 7-5. 

The good feelings were here when I came onto the court, Golovin said. When you win the first set 6-0 its hard to stay focused and during the second set, I started to play less accurately, she said. 

But the match helped me to realise where I stand, she added. (Agencies)

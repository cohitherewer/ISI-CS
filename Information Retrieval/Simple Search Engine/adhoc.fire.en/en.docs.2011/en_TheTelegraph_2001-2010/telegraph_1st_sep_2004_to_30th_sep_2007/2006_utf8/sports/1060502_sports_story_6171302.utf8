 Sporting lodge protest 

New Delhi: After the fiasco involving Fransa Pax, another National Football League team has lodged a protest against poor refereeing in the competition. 

Sporting Clube de Goa has alleged that Rizwan-ul Haque, who officiated their match against Federation Cup champions Mahindra United in Margao last Friday, ruled against them at two crucial moments, which drastically affected the outcome of the game. 

Mahindras went on to win the game 1-0. 

The management of the Goan outfit said the referee allowed more than the two minutes added on at the end of first half. 

The goal by S Venkatesh came 27 seconds after injury time should have been over, Sporting have claimed in the letter. 

The second incident mentioned in the protest was when the referee stopped Sporting from taking a quick throw-in after Mahindra keeper put the ball out of play and went out of the touchline himself. 

The Goan club alleged that the referee failed to interpret the rules properly, thereby denying Sporting a good scoring opportunity. 

However, an AIFF spokesman said that match commissioner Franco Miranda has not mentioned any such discrepancy in his report to the federation. (PTI)

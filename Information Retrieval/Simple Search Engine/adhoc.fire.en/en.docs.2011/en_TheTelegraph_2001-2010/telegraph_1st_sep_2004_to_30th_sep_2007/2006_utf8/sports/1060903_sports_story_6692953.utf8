 Walcott laid to rest

Bridegtown: Clyde Walcott, a West Indies cricket legend and the first non-British chairman of the International Cricket Council, was buried on Saturday on a hill overlooking a cricket ground named in his honour, wife Muriel said. 

Walcott, a Barbados native who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993 for his contribution to cricket, died a week ago at the age of 80 after a brief illness. 

He was buried overlooking the Three Ws Oval at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill, two miles outside Bridgetown. 

Walcott was part of the famed West Indies Three Ws formation in the 1950s. (PTI)

London: Pele believes it will be harder for Brazil to win a sixth World Cup because they are the favourites. 

Pressure, high expectations and bad luck have cost many past favourites, and the 2002 World Cup winners face the same hurdle, Pele said during a visit to Britain to promote his new autobiography Pele. 

Thats the big problem, he said. Today the big opponent of Brazil is being the favourite. Always in the World Cup, the favourites dont succeed. 

The 65-year-old Pele, who won three World Cups for Brazil as a player, listed several teams who were tripped up after being tabbed the favourites. He cited the 1982 Brazilian team ? Italy beat Germany in the final that year ? and the Dutch teams of 1974 and 1978. 

If you remember in the last World Cup in Korea and Japan, Italy and France were favourites from Europe and Argentina was the best team from South America, and neither qualified from their groups, he said. 

The soccer icon said Englands decision to select unknown 17-year-old striker Theo Walcott isnt the same as when he was selected at 17 for the 1958 finals. 

Pele made his debut for his hometown club Santos at 15, and played for Brazil against Argentina at 16, months before leading his country to their first World Cup victory in Sweden, scoring in the final against the hosts. Walcott has yet to play a single game for his team, Arsenal in the English Premier League. 

He has never played. He is going to be right in a big competition like the World Cup without having experience, Pele said. Nobody can expect him to come onto the field and save his team. (AP)

 Manhas hails allround show

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: North Zone captain Mithun Manhas was all smiles after winning the Duleep Trophy convincingly sans their top players Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Dinesh Mongia and Harbhajan Singh. 

After amassing 636 for seven, the North Zone captain felt that his bowlers did the job to perfection. Taking 20 wickets on this track is quite an achievement and our bowlers did it, Manhas said after their eight-wicket victory at the Eden on Thursday. 

Manhas heaped praise on young off-spinner Rajesh Sharma. He is an exceptional talent and will make his mark very shortly. 

Sharma, whose action looks a bit suspect, also got some advice from Arun Lal. Beta you just get your action checked so that if there is any fault, you can rectify it, otherwise you may face difficulty in future. As far I am concerned he is a great prospect for the country.

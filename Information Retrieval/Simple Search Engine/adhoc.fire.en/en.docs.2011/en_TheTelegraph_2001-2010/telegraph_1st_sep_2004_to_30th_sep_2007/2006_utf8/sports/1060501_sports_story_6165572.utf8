 Ponting wants McGrath to skip meet

 ChampionTrophy

 Sydney: Despite Cricket 

 Australia (CA) assuring ICC that it would send its strongest 

 team to the Champions Trophy later this year, skipper Ricky 

 Ponting has asked pace spearhead Glenn McGrath skip the 

 tournament and play some County cricket to prepare for the 

 Ashes.

 McGrath would be better 

 off missing the Champions Trophy and he might be better 

 served by getting some work in County cricket before the 

 Australian summer, Ponting said after returning from 

 the tour of Bangladesh.

 McGrath had missed the tours of 

 South Africa And Bangladesh to be with his ailing wife who 

 is battling a recurrence of breast cancer.

 CA had earlier said that ICC events 

 were its topmost priority and they would send their best 

 side to the limited overs tournament to be held in India 

 in October-November.

 Meanwhile, Ponting expressed confidence 

 that his team was on the right track to reclaim the Ashes 

 when the oldest rivalry in cricket rekindles later this 

 year.

 Australia are heading in 

 the right direction for the start of the Ashes campaign, 

 the master batsman said.

 With both forms of the game, 

 Im really happy with the way things are going, 

 Ponting said. 

 Weve got Damien Martyn 

 back in the Test side again now, weve got that really 

 steady looking batting line-up which I think will be very 

 good against the English out here in our conditions, 

 the skipper said.

 We believe that everything 

 is sort of on course with Glenn at the moment and hes 

 obviously very keen to play in the Ashes Series. Stuart 

 Clark is coming along beautifully, Brett (Lee) has had an 

 amazing 12 or 18 months and Warney (Shane Warne) is bowling 

 as well as ever, so our whole set-up is shaping up pretty 

 well.

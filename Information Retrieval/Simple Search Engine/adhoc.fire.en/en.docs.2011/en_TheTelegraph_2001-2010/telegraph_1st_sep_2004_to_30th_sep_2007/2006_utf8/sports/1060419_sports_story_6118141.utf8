 Quick Takes

 Referees pay doubled to $40000

 Frankfurt: Referees 

 at the 2006 World Cup have won a 100 per cent pay rise and 

 will earn $40,000 each. The refereeing bill at the month-long 

 tournament will top $4 million, Fifa said on Tuesday. Twenty-three 

 referees have been chosen to run the 64 games in Germany 

 from June 9 to July 9.

 Each referee will be backed by 

 two assistants. They will also get $40,000 as will each 

 member of the seven reserve refereeing trios, 

 even if they are not called into action.

 The fee per referee has 

 doubled from South Korea and Japan four years ago when it 

 was $20,000 each, Fifa general secretary Urs Linsi 

 told a news conference on Tuesday. For the first time 

 were also giving something to the referees and assistants 

 who dont make it. Theyve worked hard and come 

 a long way, even if in the end they werent successful.

 Fifa originally had 46 referees 

 and the 16 who did not make the cut will get $20,000 each, 

 as will 23 unsuccessful assistants. All that comes to $4.38 

 million.

 Brazil gets Chile support

 Rio de Janeiro: Brazil 

 has thanked Chile for supporting its plans to host the 2014 

 World Cup following Fifa president Sepp Blatters suggestion 

 that the Chileans could launch a joint bid with Argentina 

 instead. 

 Brazilian football confederation 

 (CBF) president Ricardo Teixeira sent official messages 

 on Monday to his opposite number in Chile, Reinaldo Sanchez, 

 and the head of the Chilean governments sports agency, 

 Catalina Depassier, the CBF said on its official website.

 The ten South American federations 

 are backing Brazil as their only candidate. South America 

 is due to host the 2014 World Cup under the new system, 

 beginning in Africa in 2010, in which Fifa rotates the tournament 

 between continents.

 Leipzig 'aid' for fans

 Berlin: Leipzig will hand 

 out World Cup first aid packages including condoms 

 and tissues so soccer fans can dry their eyes after a defeat. 

 The kits, to be handed out by 

 volunteers on trams and buses in the eastern German city, 

 will also include plasters and plastic whistles, city officials 

 said on Tuesday.

 Sponsor deal for $195m

 Dubai: Emirates has signed 

 a $195 million partnership deal with Fifa which would give 

 the Dubai-based airline sponsorship rights to all Fifa competitions 

 for seven years from 2007.

 Emirates is a sponsor of the 2006 

 World Cup in Germany. The deal was signed by the airlines 

 chairman, Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed al-Maktoum, and Fifa President 

 Joseph Blatter on Tuesday. 

 I deserve a place 

 : Giuly 

 Paris: Barcelona midfielder 

 Ludovic Giuly said on Tuesday he deserved a place in Frances 

 World Cup squad, despite being out of favour with coach 

 Raymond Domenech. 

 I wouldnt understand 

 being left out, Giuly was quoted as saying by a French 

 sports daily. If the coach doesnt want me he 

 will have to tell me but Ill do everything I can to 

 be called up.

 The 29-year-old has won 17 caps 

 but is not a first choice under Domenech.

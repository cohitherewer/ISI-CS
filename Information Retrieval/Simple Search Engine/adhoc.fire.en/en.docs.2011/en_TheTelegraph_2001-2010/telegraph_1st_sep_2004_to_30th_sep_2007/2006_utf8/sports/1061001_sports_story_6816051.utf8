Hertfordshire: Jyoti Randhawa missed several birdie putts in his even par round of 71 to be tied 15th at the midway stage of the $7.5 million WGC-American Express golf championship at the Grove. 

Randhawa, who was overnight tied sixth, was five-under 139 for two rounds and a full 10 shots behind leader Tiger Woods, who continued his march to a sixth title in succession on the PGA Tour. 

Woods fired a seven-under 64 to go with his first round 63 to come to a whopping 15-under 127 and a clear five shots ahead of second placed Jim Furyk (65), David Howell (66) and Stewart Cink (67), all of whom were at 10-under 132. 

Randhawa, sixth in the same event in 2002, started with a birdie on the second but dropped a shot on the immediate next hole. He missed a series of birdie putts but hung in there with pars before dropping a second shot on 16th. He closed with a birdie on 18th to come to par. 

Englishman Simon Dyson enjoyed a steady second round when he fired a two-under-par 69 and was in joint 11th spot. The 28-year-old stalwart, who has won four Asian Tour titles, achieved a two-day total of six-under-par 136. 

Thai Thongchai Jaidee, the two-time Asian Tour No.1, shot five birdies and a lone bogey in tied 21st spot, together with Koreas Choi Kyung-Ju who improved with a 66. Last years Asian Tour No.1 from Thailand Thaworn Wiratchant was even-par for the second consecutive day in joint 43rd spot. 

Woods, who set a new course record 63 in the opening round, was equally impressive in tougher second day conditions. He shot a bogey-free 64, which featured five birdies and an eagle on the 18th, where he had done the same in first round. (PTI)

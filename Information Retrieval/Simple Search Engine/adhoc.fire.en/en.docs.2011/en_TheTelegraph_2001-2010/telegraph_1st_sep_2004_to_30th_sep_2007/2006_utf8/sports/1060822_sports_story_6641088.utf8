 When Bhajji was at the receiving end

New Delhi: As Pakistan seek to come to terms with the sensational ball tampering charge that led to the fourth Test being awarded to England, they may find a sympathiser in Indias Harbhajan Singh, who too had his share of problems with the controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair last year. 

Hair had reported the Indian off-spinner in the second Test of the TVS Cup series against Pakistan last March. 

Harbhajan returned figures of four for 145 runs in the match, which India won by 195 runs. 

But Match Referee Chris Broad and umpires Hair and Steve Bucknor were not happy with the bowlers action, particularly when he bowled the doosra. 

Broad, in his report to the ICC, had said the report relates specifically to the bowlers action when delivering the doosra. 

It was noticeable to the umpires and me that there was an apparent change in his action when bowling this delivery between the first innings, when no concerns were raised, and the second. 

Following the submission of the report, Harbhajan was instructed to get his action analysed. 

Hair created a storm by repeatedly calling no-balls against Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan during a series against Australia in 1995. (PTI)

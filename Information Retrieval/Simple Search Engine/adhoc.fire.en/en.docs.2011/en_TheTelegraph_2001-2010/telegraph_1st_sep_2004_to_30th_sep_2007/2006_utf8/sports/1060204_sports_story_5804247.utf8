 Rebels accuse ZC of divide and rule

Harare: Zimbabwes rebel cricketers accused the games rulers of pursuing a divide-and-conquer strategy as their lawyer considered a last-minute move to end the crisis which has seen senior players refusing to represent their country. 

As the bitter wrangle ? which has already seen the country suspend its Test status for the second time in less than two years ? dragged on, fourteen players insisted they would not be bullied into submission. 

Senior player Hamilton Masakazda, who joined teammates in a queue to receive newly-drafted contracts, said on Thursday, Its just typical divide and rule. 

The new Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) chiefs, who were appointed as an interim board in early January by the Zimbabwe government, also told the players representative and negotiator Clive Field they would no longer deal with him. (AFP)

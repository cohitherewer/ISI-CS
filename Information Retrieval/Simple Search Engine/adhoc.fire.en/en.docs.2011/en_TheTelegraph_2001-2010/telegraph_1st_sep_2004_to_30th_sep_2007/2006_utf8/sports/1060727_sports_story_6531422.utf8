 Kasparovs brief return

 - Zurich Meet

Moscow: Former world chess champion Garri Kasparov on Wednesday said he would be making a brief return to competition in a tournament in Zurich next month, where his old foe Anatoly Karpov will also be playing. 

At the end of August, Garri Kasparov will take part in a demonstration tournament in Zurich (to mark) the 150th anniversary of the Credit Suisse (Bank) which for many years sponsored chess worldwide, his website said.

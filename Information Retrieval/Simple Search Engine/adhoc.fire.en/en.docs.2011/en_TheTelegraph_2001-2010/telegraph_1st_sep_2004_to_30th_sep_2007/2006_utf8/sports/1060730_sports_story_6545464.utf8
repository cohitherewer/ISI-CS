 Indians spot Sikh striker in Vancouver

New Delhi: All India Football Federations attempt to convince Michael Chopra to don the India jersey has proved futile, but it has spotted a Sikh forward in Vancouver who could be a potential match winner for the national side. 

According to India team manager Pradeep Chowdhury, who returned with the squad from Canada on Saturday morning, told The Telegraph that Vancouver striker Charanjit Singh caught the eyes of the team management with his fine display. 

Chowdhury, who has already spoken to Charanjits father, felt the 17-year-old footballer could easily fit into the India under-20 squad and later may graduate in the seniors. 

The AIFF, at present, is looking for players of Indian origin in different countries to strengthen the national squad both at the age group and senior level. Charanjit impressed us when he played for the Indo-Canadian XI in a friendly after the four-nation tournament was over, said Chowdhury. We won 3-0, but Charanjit troubled our defence a lot. Even Bob (Houghton) was impressed. 

Later, Chowdhury spoke to Charanjits father, who sounded interested in sending his son to play in India. Chowdhury has already spoken to the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco and provided him all the details. 

The Indian team management also had an informal meeting with Cardiff striker Michael Chopra, but the British footballer seemed more interested in donning England colours. 

Houghton, however, is hopeful that Chopra might change his mind if he doesnt get an England call for the Euro Cup qualifiers. Houghton, who has now gone to China, will return to India on Wednesday to resume training in Calcutta on Friday. 

The British coach has reportedly told the team management that he is not in favour of holding long camps. He said all camps should be between seven to 10 days. 

Chowdhury, a regular with the national team during his playing days, said he was satisfied with the performance of the Indian team in Canada. 

The best part of Houghton is that he could eliminate the fear factor from the boys minds while playing international matches. The boys played an organised game both in victory and defeat.

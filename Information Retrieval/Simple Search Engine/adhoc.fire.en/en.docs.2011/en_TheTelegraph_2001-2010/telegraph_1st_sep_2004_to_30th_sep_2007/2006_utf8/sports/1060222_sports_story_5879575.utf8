 Owen may play despite injury - FA Cup 

 Quarters 

London: Newcastle Uniteds caretaker manager Glenn Roeder says injured striker Michael Owen has a chance of playing in next months FA Cup quarter final against Chelsea. 

It will be touch and go, Roeder told the clubs official website on Tuesday. Apparently, hes certainly not behind (his recovery) time, if anything he might be a little bit ahead of time. 

England striker Owen said earlier this month that he was confident of being fit to return from his broken toe in April. 

Owen had a metal pin inserted on the fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot after colliding with Tottenham Hotspurs England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on December 31. Hes got no concerns with the way the operation went and the way the injury is healing, said Roeder.

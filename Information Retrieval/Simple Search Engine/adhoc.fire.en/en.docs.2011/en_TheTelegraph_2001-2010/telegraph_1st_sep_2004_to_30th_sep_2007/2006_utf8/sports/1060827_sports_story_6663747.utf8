 BCCI sympathises with Pakistan

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Saturday expressed sympathy for Pakistan in the recent ball tampering controversy but refused to take sides on the issue. 

We have sympathy for Pakistan, secretary Niranjan Shah said in Calcutta. 

He, however, said the BCCI will decide on their stand after inspecting the documents that will be placed before the ICC executive committee meeting in Dubai on September 2.

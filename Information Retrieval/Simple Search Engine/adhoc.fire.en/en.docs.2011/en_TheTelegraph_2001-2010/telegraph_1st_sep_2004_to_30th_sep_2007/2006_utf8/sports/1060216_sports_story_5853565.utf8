 Tour a huge challenge and I love it: Pietersen

 - Duleep 100s will stand me in good stead

Mumbai: Englands hard-hitting middle order batsman Kevin Pietersen is not bothered about peoples opinion on his unorthodox batting style or the colour of his hair. 

All that the 25-year-old South African immigrant is focussed on at the moment, is doing well against Indian bowlers in India and believes he has the ability to succeed. 

He, however, was happy that strokemakers are making their presence felt in the game. 

I hope so because it (unorthodox batting) brings entertainment. Blokes like Sehwag, Tendulkar, Yuvraj and this new wicketkeeper Dhoni, they play more shots in 10 balls than I do if I get in 150. 

Its entertaining, it is great for the game. They are not slogging, but playing cricket shots. It is the same with me, Freddie (Flintoff) and everyone around the world. It is happening all over the world, and hopefully the purists will accept it, the 25-year old said after Englands first intense net session at the Brabourne Stadium here on Wednesday. 

Pietersen believes the series would be harder than the one against Pakistan and tougher than the Ashes series. 

It is going to be tough. Pakistan series was very hard, India is going to be very, very tough. It is always so in the subcontinent. 

He was the batting fulcrum on the A tour of India in 2003-04 when he scored four centuries in the Duleep Trophy. 

Pietersen said that experience will stand him in good stead in the upcoming Test and one-day series but only that much. 

It gives me a lot of confidence to know that I can score runs in the subcontinent.If it is the confidence factor that you need to take into the subcontinent, I have that. 

Having said that, it is a different kettle of fish facing the likes of Kumble, Harbhajan and Pathan. To be fair, the attack I faced when compared to these is nothing. It is a totally different attack I will be facing. 

Especially in India, its going to be testing conditions, it is going to be very, very hard. It is a challenge and I love a challenge, the whole England team loves a challenge. We are looking forward to it. 

The middle order batsman said adaptation and patience were the keys to success for any touring batsman, but insisted it did not mean he would change his batting technique. 

You have to adapt. You cant go and play how you play in England or in South Africa, he said.

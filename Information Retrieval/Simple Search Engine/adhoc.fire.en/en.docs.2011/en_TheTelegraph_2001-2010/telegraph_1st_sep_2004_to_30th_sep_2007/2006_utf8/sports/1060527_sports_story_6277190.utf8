 Chopra breaks 109-yr-old record 

 County Championship

 London: Indian-origin cricketer 

 Varun Chopra broke a 109-year-old record to become the youngest 

 batsman scoring a century for Essex in their second division 

 County Championship against Gloucestershire in Chelmsford.

 Chopra hit 106 off 162 balls on 

 Thursday to erase the record of Arthur Jervois Turner, who 

 had played for Army against Cambridge University, two months 

 before the Great War.

 Chopra, who turns 19 next month, 

 was born and raised in Ilford and coached both by Joe Hussain, 

 Nasser Hussains father and Graham Gooch.

 A right-hand bat, who was born 

 on June 21, 1987, Chopra has already represented England 

 in the under-19 tournaments. He was also the captain of 

 the under-19 English side which routed Sri Lanka last year. 

 Three years after his own precocious 

 century in 1897, Turner was thrice wounded in the Boer War 

 and praised for his heroism by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

 After the completion of Day III, 

 Gloucestershire were 114 for five in the second innings 

 after Essex rode Chopras century to make 388. Gloucestershire 

 scored 396 in the first innings.

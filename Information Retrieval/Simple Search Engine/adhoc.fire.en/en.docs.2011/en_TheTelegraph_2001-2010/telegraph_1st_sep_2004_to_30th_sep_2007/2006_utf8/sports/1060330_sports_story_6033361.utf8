Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara scored 185 and spinner Muttiah Muralidharan claimed late wickets to push Sri Lanka towards victory in the first Test against Pakistan on Wednesday. 

Sharing important stands with Mahela Jayawardene (82) and Thilan Samaraweera (64), Sangakkara propelled Sri Lanka to 448 for five in their second innings to set up a 458-run victory target for Pakistan. 

Pakistan were 89 for two at the close of the fourth day. 

The 28-year-old Sangakkara, who became the seventh Sri Lankan to score more than 4,000 Test runs on Tuesday, cracked 23 boundaries during his ninth Test century that spanned over seven-and-a-half hours. 

We have done really well to put ourselves in a winning position, said Sangakkara after the close of days play. 

Sri Lankas second innings run spree, on a pitch that grew increasingly placid for the pace bowlers but was offering turn for the spinners, left Pakistan needing to bat for more than four sessions to secure a draw. 

Pakistan openers, drained after two long days of fielding in Colombos wet heat, started brightly with a 59-run stand either side of the tea interval. 

Muralidharan, bowling unchanged for 14 overs after an initial attack with the new ball, struck in the final hour, left Pakistan precariously placed at the close. 

Imran Farhat (34) was the first to depart as he edged to slip and then Younis Khan after scoring only eight runs was cleaned bowled by a big off break as he tried to cut through the off side. 

Shoaib Malik, dropped on 14 by Sangakkara behind the stumps, finished unbeaten on 30 and giving him company was Faisal Iqbal on nine not out at the close of days play. 

Earlier, Sri Lanka avoided any major damage from the second new ball on the fourth morning as they added 111 runs in an extended 34 overs session. 

The only casualty of the morning session was skipper Jayawardene, who top-edged an attempted hook off Mohammed Asif and was caught by Abdul Razzaq running in from the long leg boundary. 

Asifs strike with the new ball ended a marathon 158-run partnership that allowed Sri Lanka to take complete control of the game. 

Jayawardenes 139-ball innings was laced with 12 fours and one straight six. 

Sangakkara had been content to play the sheet anchor role while Jayawardene attacked, but the loss of his captain encouraged him to adopt a more aggressive approach. 

Sangakkara praised Jayawardene innings. I thought batting in the second innings was much easier than in the first, he said. 

The wicket had settled down and it was just a case of spending time out there and concentrating very hard. 

Mahela was the best of the batsmen on that pitch ?? he played as if he was playing in his back yard, putting the bowlers to the sword. 

He scored runs so quickly that it took all the pressure off me ??? I just had to dig in and do the job of anchoring the innings, added 

Samaraweera, fortunate to survive a leg before appeal off leg spinner Shahid Afridi early on, helped to add another 144 runs during a hot afternoon. 

Sangakkara eventually departed as he searched for quick runs before the declaration and skied a catch off spinner Shoaib Malik. 

Sri Lanka then gave wicketkeeper Sangakkara 20 minutes to rest before declaring.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid the greatest Indian batsman

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

- Kapil, captain during the last big series win till the one in WI, 

holds forth 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kapil Dev 

Calcutta: Team Indias 2-0 win over Zimbabwe last September was the first Test series success outside the sub-continent in 19 years. Given the quality of the home team, though, nobody treated that as special. The last big win (till the one in the West Indies early on Monday), therefore, was in England exactly two decades ago. The then-captain, Kapil Dev, spoke to The Telegraph some hours after the 49-run victory in Kingston. 

The following are excerpts 

On India requiring 20 years for a big 

series success outside the sub-continent 

That has been disappointing? We did, of course, come 

close to beating Australia in Australia (2003-04)? This win has been sweet, as 

all victories are, but there are loose ends to tie up? 

On the significance of this win 

The boys should enjoy the moment, but not lose sight 

of what lies ahead. One series may be over, but the next is never far away. 

On the quality of the Brian Lara-led West Indies 

team 

Its not fair to compare teams from different 

generations, but everyone agrees the present one had the weakest attack. 

On the loose ends 

(After a pause) The team management must be 

careful in its treatment of matchwinners? In my opinion, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan 

Pathan werent treated well? Bhajji only played the last two Tests, Pathan 

got picked just once (in the four-Test series)? Surely, both Greg Chappell and 

Rahul Dravid are aware of the importance of confidence? If somebody is short, 

the coach and captain have to inject confidence, not reduce it even more. 

On the victory coming sans Pathan 

I dont wish to get into a debate, but Pathan 

remains among the top five allrounders? When he did well, in different positions, 

the coach got credit? Why wasnt the coach blamed when he wasnt doing 

well? Also, there shouldnt be double-standards? Earlier this year, Virender 

Sehwag was given an extended run despite poor form? That was done because hes 

a matchwinner? I dont have a problem with that, but the bowlers must be 

treated the same way. Bhajji, for example, is a matchwinner and cant be 

treated the way he was at the start of the Test series. 

On Chappell 

Weve won the Test series, but what happened 

in the ODIs? Experimenting in a limited way is fine, not when done whimsically? 

Chappell has to look at the larger picture and ensure consistency? Surely, he 

wouldnt have liked situations when he only came to know of where he would 

bat on the morning of a match. 

On Dravids batting 

Where Im concerned, Dravid is the greatest Indian 

batsman? Nobody has matched his consistency overseas and, irrespective of when 

he quits, he will be saluted as our greatest? Indeed, today, he doesnt have 

to prove anything anywhere. Captain or not, his commitment has been exceptional? 

He knows which ball to hit and which to defend? Its this shot-selection 

which sets him apart... Helps him stay one step ahead of the rest. 

[Dravids average in 57 away Tests is 65.28; 

at home its 51.52 in 47 appearances. Then, 15 of his 23 hundreds have been 

scripted overseas. As also 25 of his 46 half-centuries.] 

On whether he expected Dravids batting 

to dip once he got the captaincy full-time last October 

No? His mental make-up is different and he isnt 

the type to change his style or approach to suit the position he holds? He has 

always shown the highest commitment? (After a pause) If I can add, Sourav 

Gangulys level of commitment rose when he became the captain? His make-up 

was different and, clearly, captaincy changed him. 

On whether its going to be even more difficult 

now for Sourav to make a comeback 

Yes, if the cricketer in me is to give you the answer? 

Its probably impossible and Sourav should have retired some time back? He 

would have retained all the respect? If Im to talk as a simple human being, 

then Souravs determination to make a big league return is to be commended? 

Im not the type to discourage anybody and a Mohinder Amarnath kept making 

comebacks. 

On whether Sreesanth is the best among the quicks 

to have surfaced after 2000 

No? Hes energetic and has been getting breakthroughs, 

but has much to learn? His body moves too much and he doesnt have the stability 

of, say, (Lakshmipathy) Balaji? The latter, I think, has been our finest in recent 

years? Its a pity that injuries have harmed his career. 

On Munaf Patel, who earned high marks in the 

West Indies 

I like him? Hes good, but needs to work on his 

run-up? Thats an important area. 

Finally, on memories of the fantastic summer 

of 1986 

(Laughs) Dont remember much? In fact, 

even today, Im disappointed we didnt win the Edgbaston Test? That 

would have made it 3-0? More than anything else, we learnt that you need 20 wickets 

to win a Test.

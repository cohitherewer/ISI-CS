The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC sleuth booked elsewhere

 - Accommodation problem in Chandigarh 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Owing to a major accommodation problem at the official hotel (Taj), the International Cricket Council (ICC) sleuth, N.S. Virk, has had to be booked elsewhere and not with Team India and England. 

Its a very unusual arrangement as Virk is supposed to keep his eyes and ears open outside the match venues as well. Obviously, he has been greatly inconvenienced. 

Ive got to follow the ICC guidelines... Ive been given to understand this wont be repeated in other centres, Virk told The Telegraph on Wednesday, not many hours before the start of the second Test, in neighbouring Mohali. 

 The Taj, one learns, has been handicapped because of a high-profile polo tournament in Patiala ? the participants have been booked here, not in the city hosting the meet. Patiala is some 90 minutes away by road.

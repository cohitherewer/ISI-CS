Durban: Jacques Kallis made an undefeated 72 on Saturday to lead South Africa to 140 for two by the time bad light stopped play on Day II of the second Test against Australia. 

With him at close was opener A. B. De Villiers, who had battled his way out of a run of poor form to score 48 in an unbeaten stand of 97. 

Kallis raced to 50 off 49 balls with 10 fours, after South Africa lost two wickets for two runs at the start of their innings. Brett Lee had South Africa captain Graeme Smith caught by Justin Langer at third slip off the first ball of the innings before Michael Kasprowicz uprooted Herschelle Gibbs off stump for nine. 

Kallis and De Villiers did have some anxious moments against Lees pace and the sharp turn of Shane Warne. 

Earlier, Australia made 369 in their first innings, Michael Hussey holding the tail together with 75 before he was trapped leg before by Kallis. 

Australia had resumed the day on 228 for five and South Africa bowled tightly in the first half-hour. Hussey and Andrew Symonds weathered the attack until Symonds was trapped leg before for 13 off Andre Nel. 

Adam Gilchrist was spilled by Ashwell Prince while on nought before edging another delivery by Nel to wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, having scored two. 

Warne came to the crease with the score on 259 and featured in a 56-run partnership with Hussey. Warne scored 36 off 31 balls.

 Injured Jones doubtful for Guwahati tie

Kochi: England wicketkeeper Geraint Jones is nursing a thigh strain and is doubtful for the fifth one-dayer against India in Guwahati on Sunday, according to a team spokesman. 

Jones strained his left thigh while batting on Thursday and it is highly unlikely he will play in Guwahati, England media manager James Avery said on Friday. 

Meanwhile, Matthew Hoggard, the highest wicket-taker in the Test series, Friday said omission from the team for the first three one-dayers against India took a toll on his rhythm in the fourth match here. 

Hoggard was spanked around the park by the Indian batsmen Thursday which England lost by 4 wickets to go down 0-4 in the seven-game series to the hosts. 

I was disappointed that I did not play the first three one-day matches. I was picked for playing the fourth, but unfortunately, I did not bowl as well as I hoped, Hoggard said at a press conference. Hoggard proved mighty expensive in the nine overs he bowled, returning wicketless while giving away 59 runs. When you are in rhythm you have to stay in rhythm, the pacer said adding he would have to work out his bowling in the nets to get back into form for the remaining three matches of the series. 

Hoggard rued the missed chances in the first two close games in New Delhi and Faridabad, saying had they won these matches, the story would have been entirely different now. (PTI)

 Veerans, Steelers win

Chandigarh: Drag-flicker Raghunath converted all three penalty corners to help Chennai Veerans drub Imphal Rangers 5-1 for their third victory in as many matches in a Tier II match of the Premier Hockey League at the Sector 42 Stadium on Wednesday. 

Veerans began on an attacking note with their forwards Raja and Adam Sinclair working in tandem in the frontline, but Rangers managed to provide the initial resistance before yielding in the 15th minute.

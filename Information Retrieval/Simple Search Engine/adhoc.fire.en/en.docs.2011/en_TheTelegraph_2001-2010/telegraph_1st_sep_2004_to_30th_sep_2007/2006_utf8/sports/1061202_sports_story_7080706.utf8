 Jeev vaults into three-way lead

 - JAPAN MEET 

 - Indian fires a flawless five-under 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh continued to be on a roll with a flawless five-under 65 that put him in joint lead at the halfway stage of the season-ending Golf Nippon Series JT Cup at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club. 

Jeev, who was sixth overnight, is now eight-under 132. He shares the lead with Japanese duo Shingo Katayama, who turned in a four-under 66, and Hiroyuki Fujita (67). 

With only 28 players teeing up in the 100 million yen meet, the Indian could be in for a big payday as well as ensure a slot in the year-end top-50 which would guarantee him a place in all majors next year. 

The 34-year-old Chandigarh pro, currently 55th in the world, has one more event this season the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok in the third week of December. 

Jeev got his first birdie on the fifth and added another on seventh before a third on ninth saw him turn in three-under. On the back-nine, he shot birdies on 11th and 17th to go five-under. 

Finding only 67 per cent of the greens in regulation in windy conditions, Jeev once again worked magic on the greens as he needed just 26 putts. He had ten single putts and was very consistent. 

The last couple of weeks I have been hitting well and here I putted very well too, said Jeev, who won the Casio World Open last week for his maiden title in Japan. 

He had already won in Asia and Europe this year and topped the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit and is currently eighth in Japan. He also ended the season in 16th place in Europe. 

Jeev, Katayama and Fujita are one shot ahead of fourth-placed Keiichiro Fukabori (66), while first-round leader Wayne Perske (69) and Taichi Teshima (66) were tied fifth at six-under 134. 

 Jeev has 11 top-10 finishes in 

 16 starts in what has been a sensational season in Japan 

 and worldwide. (PTI)

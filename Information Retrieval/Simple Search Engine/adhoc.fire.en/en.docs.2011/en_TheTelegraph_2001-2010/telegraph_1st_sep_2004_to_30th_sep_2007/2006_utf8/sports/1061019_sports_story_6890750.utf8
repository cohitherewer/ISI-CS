The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A very disappointing start

 - Its time to go back to the board room, says Ponting 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai: No blaming the pitch, but a guarded warning to England and India. This was how Ricky Ponting summed up Australias 10-run defeat to the West Indies on Wednesday. 

Australia are set to take on England in Jaipur on Saturday, and on October 29, will finish the Champions Trophy group stage with their encounter against hosts India in Mohali. 

This is a very disappointing start We didnt expect it. We lost quick wickets upfront and that kind of put us under pressure. But some mistakes in the middle cost us the match, the Australian cap-tain pointed out. 

Though Ponting defended his bowlers after letting the West Indies finish at 234 for six from 63 for four, he felt Wednesdays defeat was a wake-up call to them. 

Its time to go back to the board room, analyse what went wrong here. This defeat showed we need to improve in every aspect of the game. Two big games are coming up, and so, we cant sleep easily, he maintained. 

Ponting, however, was all praise for Brian Lara and Man-of-the-Match Runako Morton. Last time we saw him (Morton), he got a record breaking (31-ball) duck. But here he started off with a boundary. Both Lara and Morton paced their innings well, he said. 

Ramnaresh Sarwan, who led the side in the second session in absence of Lara, admitted that a lot of their inspiration came from the fact that they started the match as defending champions. We are the defending champions we took that pride with us, he said. 

Meanwhile, according to Sarwan, Lara was on medication while Shivnarine Chanderpaul (who missed the tie due to food poisoning) is expected to recover in a couple of days.

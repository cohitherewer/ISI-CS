Stockholm: American James Blake opened the defence of his Stockholm Open title in style on Wednesday, but world number two Rafael Nadal fell in his second round match against Swede Joachim Johansson. 

Nadal, playing in his first tournament since his quarter final loss to Russian Mikhail Youzhny in the US Open, could not threaten the awesome serving of Johansson, who won 6-4, 7-6 in front of an ecstatic home crowd. 

In his first round match, Blake outclassed another Swede, Thomas Johansson, 6-3 6-2. 

The American world number eight, seeded second behind Nadal, broke Johanssons service early in both sets and never allowed the Swede to find his rhythm. 

Throughout he displayed the powerful serving and solid ground strokes that have made him a contender for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai. 

Once I got the first break, I gained a lot of confidence, said Blake, who is chasing his fifth ATP title this year after triumphing in Bangkok two weeks ago. 

Youre never sure if your momentum is going to continue in a new city... Its a great feeling, I hope it continues throughout the week. 

Blake, who defeated Thai Paradorn Srichaphan in last years final, now faces Simon Greul in the second round. The German defeated Swede Ervin Eleskovic 6-4, 6-2. 

I was completely blown away, acknowledged Johansson, a winner in 2000 and 2004. 

Former top-10 player Joachim Johansson, now ranked 690 in the world after a long shoulder injury lay-off, set the pace against Nadal by firing four consecutive aces in his first service game. 

After breaking the Spaniard to 2-1, he comfortably held serve throughout the first set. He broke Nadals opening service game in the second but later dropped serve himself, allowing the match into a tie-break. 

After grabbing a 3-0 lead, Johansson stayed on top to win the tie-break 7-4 on a backhand return error by Nadal. 

I didnt play the match of my life, but I didnt play a bad match either, said Nadal. Joachim was more aggressive. On the big points, he was more aggressive, for sure. 

He has unbelievable potential, he has an incredible serve and an incredible forehand. He has the advantage over other players coming back from injuries, and thats his serve... Hes one of the top five (servers), for sure. 

Johansson fired 17 aces past the Mallorcan, who was rarely able to take charge of the rallies. I think this is my finest victory. Ive won titles and Ive gone far in Grand Slams, but considering how the last year has been, I rank this one the highest, said Johansson, who reached the US Open semis two years ago. 

You cant get involved in long rallies with him - hes so good and patient. 

Johansson, whose father Leif upset then top-ranked Stan Smith at the 1971 event in the Swedish capital, had been sidelined for five months because of right shoulder and elbow injuries since returning for a Challenger Tour event in July. This is his first ATP event since February. 

Nadal was awe-struck. If he continues playing like this he has the chance to make the top eight in (next years) Masters Cup. He has a chance to win this event if he plays like this, but its never the same to play in the second round as in the semi-finals when pressure is there for a player who wants a lot of points. 

Earlier, sixth-seeded Olivier Rochus advanced to the quarter finals after beating Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand 6-2, 6-7 (7-5), 6-2.Rochus, who led 6-3, 5-3, allowed Paradorn back into the match late in the second set but the Belgian took command again in the third.

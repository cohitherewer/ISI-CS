 Borg woken up by McEnroe

 - Decision not to sell Big W trophies 

 Bjorn Borg

 Stockholm: It was former 

 rival John McEnroe who got five-time Wimbledon champion 

 Bjorn Borg to change his mind about auctioning off his tennis 

 trophies. 

The Swedish great said in a newspaper interview on Tuesday that he received calls from several former tennis stars after he announced plans to sell the five trophies and two of his title-winning wood rackets. 

It made him think. 

Sure, and then when John McEnroe called me several times and wondered what I was doing, I guess I woke up: Borg, what has gotten in to you? Have you gone completely nuts? he told a Swedish tabloid. 

Andre Agassi had also urged Borg not to sell the silver gilt trophies, which had been expected to fetch between $ 350,000 ? $525,000 at the Bonhams Auction House in London. 

But clearly McEnroe convinced me, Borg said. 

The long-haired Swede won his five Wimbledon titles between 1976 and 1980, including a gruelling five-set victory over McEnroe in his last final. Borg also won six French Open titles before retiring at the age of 26. 

Earlier this month, Borg said he would sell the trophies to secure financial security for people close to him. 

The news set off speculation that Borg, who has had several failed financial ventures after retiring from tennis, was broke. 

 Wrong. I am not poor at all. Business is going 

 great and I have nothing to complain about, Borg said.

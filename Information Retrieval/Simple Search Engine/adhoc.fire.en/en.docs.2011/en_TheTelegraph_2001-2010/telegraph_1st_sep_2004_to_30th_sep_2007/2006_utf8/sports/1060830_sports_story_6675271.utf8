New York: Andre Agassi refused to go gently into the night in his final tournament by coming back to beat Andrei Pavel of Romania 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (10-8), 7-6 (8-6), 6-2 at the U.S. Open on Monday. 

Knowing each time he steps on the court could be his last match as a pro, Agassi kept overcoming deficits in his opening match and pushing his 36-year-old body around Arthur Ashe Stadium for three and a half hours. 

Most of the Open-record night session crowd of 23,736 was on its feet when Agassis eyes welled up with tears as he served out the final point after midnight. 

You want it to be everything you hope it is, Agassi said. It was perfect. 

There were moments, though, when it looked as if Agassi would be bidding adieu for good. After he lost the first set, for example. And especially when he fell behind 0-4 in the third set, causing his wife, former star Steffi Graf, to pace a bit. 

I thought, Pavel said, I have him. 

Yet thats when Agassi found the energy and shots to reverse things. Coincidence or not, Agassi went on a five-game run shortly after motioning to his coach, Darren Cahill, to bring him some freshly strung rackets. 

It also was around that time that Pavel a 32-year-old ranked 77th who hadnt played a hardcourt match since March was visited by a trainer. 

Agassi got to a third tie-breaker, then dominated the final set. 

 It was a fitting way to cap a day that celebrated three of the sports most significant figures. Before Agassis match, the US Tennis Association rededicated its facility, naming it the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. And Jimmy Connors was on the scene, too, coaching Andy Roddick and soaking in the adoration. 

Roddick began this years last major by beating Florent Serra of France 6-2, 6-1, 6-3, and joined four other past Open champions in the second round: Justine Henin-Hardenne, Lindsay Davenport, Svetlana Kuznetsova ... and, of course, Agassi bad back, 9-7 record this year, and all. 

Roddick will face Kristian Pless of Denmark or Alberto Martin of Spain in the second round. 

Meanwhile, Feliciano Lopez of Spain ousted third-seeded Ivan Ljubicic 6-3, 6-3 6-3 in the first big upset, a fate barely avoided by Agassi. 

Next for Agassi is a match against eighth-seeded Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus, a 21-year-old player who reached the Australian Open final and Wimbledon semi-finals this year. 

Such a talent, Agassi said. One of those guys youd pay to go watch. 

 Baghdatis defeated Alexander Waske of Germany 7-6 (7-1), 7-6 (9-7), 6-3. 

Agassi won the Open in 1994 and 1999, part of his collection of eight Grand Slam titles, and was the runner-up four times, including last year. When Agassi won that first US Open championship, his blond hair was long and tucked under a cap, his shirt was a loud purple, and he wore a pinkie ring and dangling earring. 

Hard to believe that same person was under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday. Look at Agassi now: Shaved head, country-club-ready white outfit, and the beaded necklace that reads, Daddy Rocks, made by his son. 

 Both of Agassis children were in the stands; in the fourth set, Graf was using a video camera, just like any parent on an outing with the kids. Agassis father was there, too, as was his brother Phil. 

In another mens match, Paradorn Srichaphan of Thailand out-lasted Jose Acasuso of Argentina 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. 

On the womens side, No. 2 seed Justine Henin-Hardenne, number four Elena Dementieva and 10th-seeded Lindsay Davenport advanced to the second round. 

Henin-Hardenne overwhelmed Italys Maria Elena Camerin 6-2, 6-1 in 74 minutes, just two days after capturing the New Haven title in her only tournament since Wimbledon. 

Also advancing was Davenport, who showed no signs of the shoulder injury that forced her to retire from the New Haven final. The 1998 champion needed just 52 minutes to stop Czech Klara Zakopalova 6-1, 6-4. 

Dementieva advanced with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over American Laura Granville, while No. 6 seed and 2004 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova stumbled briefly but recovered to beat Germanys Sandra Kloesel 6-2, 2-6, 6-3. 

Leander Paes and Sania Mirza were on Tuesday seeded sixth and seventh in the mens and womens doubles, respectively. 

Paes and Czech Republics Martin Damm will take on Czech duo Petr Pala and Robin Vik in the first round. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, partnering Xavier Malisse of Belgium, will come up against Leos Friedl of Czech Republic and Russian Mikahil Younzhny in the opening encounter. 

Sania is paired with South African Liezel Huber. The duo will launch its campaign against Angela Haynes and Neha Uberoi of the US.

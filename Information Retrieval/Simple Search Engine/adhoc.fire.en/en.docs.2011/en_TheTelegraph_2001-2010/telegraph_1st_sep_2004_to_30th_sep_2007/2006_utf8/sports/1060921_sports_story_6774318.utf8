 Kapil sees Dhoni as future captain

 - He has the ability to bring players together 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Kuala Lumpur: Virender 

 Sehwag is the Team India vice-captain, but that hasnt 

 stopped Sunil Gavaskar (and Intikhab Alam as well) from 

 projecting Yuvraj Singh as a future captain. 

On Wednesday, Kapil Dev, who is in the Malaysian capital on a TV assignment, spoke of Mahendra Singh Dhoni as a future captain. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, 

 Indias solitary World Cup-winning captain said: Dhoni, 

 to my mind, has the ability to bring players together... 

 Dekhne se wahi lagta hai... because of the diversity 

 in India, our captain has to be someone who can unite 

 everybody... Besides, Dhoni comes through as very calm and 

 has an excellent image... Obviously, hes a performer, 

 too... 

Kapil added: In India, the image factor is important... Dhoni has been around for almost two years, but I havent heard or read anything negative about him... Yes, Yuvraj has improved tremendously as a cricketer, but I feel he has to be consistent over a longer period and must ensure people talk about him in relation to cricket only... 

 In Kapils opinion, Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and 

 Sourav Ganguly have been Indias greatest 

 captains.

 India hold Hong Kong 1-1

Doha: India frittered away a golden chance to launch their Asian Games football campaign with an upset win as they conceded a Hong Kong goal in injury time for a 1-1 draw here Wednesday. After keeping the Hong Kong players at bay for most part of the contest, N.P. Pradeep produced a brilliant free kick to give India the lead in the 89th minute in a closely fought group D league match at the Al Gharaffa Stadium. 

But the euphoria gave way to acute disappointment as the Indians allowed their rivals to find the equaliser in injury time with Chan Sui Ki finding the target in dramatic fashion. 

The Indians, ranked 148th in the world, did reasonably well to hold their much higher opponents to a draw, but could have turned the tables on them had they not squandered a couple of gilt-edged opportunities. 

Captain Bhaichung Bhutia came close to the rival goalmouth twice but could not capitalise on the chances. 

Coach Bob Houghton, however, will be quite happy with the performance of his team as they played with a purpose and gameplan. Climax Lawrence was particularly impressive in the midfield which was till now a weak area for the team. 

After a barren opening session which saw both the teams making some exploratory raids on the rival citadel, the Indians raised their tempo in the second session. 

The Indians came close to scoring in the 50th minute when Bhutia dribbled past the defenders, but his shot missed the target with only the Hong Kong goalkeeper at his mercy. 

On another occasion, a Manjit volley flew over the crosspiece much to the dismay of his teammates. 

Goalkeeper Sandip Nandy also had a good day under the bar bringing off a few good saves that kept India in the game. 

India will now take on Maldives in their next group league match on Sunday.

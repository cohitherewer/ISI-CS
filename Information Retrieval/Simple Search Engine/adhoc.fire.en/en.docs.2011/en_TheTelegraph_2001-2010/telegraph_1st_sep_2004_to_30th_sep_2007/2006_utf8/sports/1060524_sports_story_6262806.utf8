 South African team to play in Duleep Trophy

Durban: The Kwazulu-Natal provincial cricket team in South Africa, known as the Dolphins, will play the prestigious Duleep Trophy tournament in India later this year. 

The United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA) made the announcement on Tuesday following the Dolphins finishing on top in the provincial league table. 

It will be the first time that a South African team will be participating in the Duleep Trophy. 

The UCB said the Dolphins will participate in the tournament if the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) decided on the dates of the tournament before the end of June. 

This is to enable the UCB to complete their fixtures for the next season, said the UCB. The Dolphins team would be led by its new captain Ahmed Amla, brother of Hashim Amla who is a member of the South Africa team. 

A spokesperson for the Kwazulu-Natal Cricket Union, Jay Naidoo, said the Dolphins would make full preparations for the tournament in India. 

However, we may be without Dale Benkenstein and Lance Klusener as they have County commitments during September and October when the Duleep Trophy will be played, he said. (PTI)

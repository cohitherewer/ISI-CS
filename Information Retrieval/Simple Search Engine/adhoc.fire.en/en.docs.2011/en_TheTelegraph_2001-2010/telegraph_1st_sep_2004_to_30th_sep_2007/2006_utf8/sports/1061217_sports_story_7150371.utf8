Calcutta: It was not a regulation net sessions for Paras Mhambreys boys at Eden Gardens Saturday. 

Their usual couple of hours of practice which started off right on time (9 a.m.) stretched well past 1 p.m. And the boys still were not giving up, going in rotation; if off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri bowled through out the day, then later he padded up to have a go at the ball. In fact, vice-captain Rohan Gavaskar was taken by surprise when he was greeted good afternoon. Is it past noon? asked a profusely-sweating Gavaskar. 

On the other hand, their opponents Gujarat had left the stadium after a two-hour net session. Aptly, this sums up the mood on the eve of their Ranji Trophy encounter. 

Bengal maybe on a high, leading their group with six points from two matches so far. But Gujarat are the ones they cant take it easy. If stats are of any indication, Bengal dont recall beating Gujarat in the recent past. 

Coach Mhambrey specified that they were not ruling out their opposition. We cannot take them lightly; In Niraj (Patel), Parthiv (Patel) and (Asraf) Makda they have got quite a few seasoned campaigners. On present from, they are playing better than Mumbai, he conceded. 

What, however, can cheer up the Bengal coach is their current form. Maybe, a reason which led the team management to thinking of retaining the same playing XI. 

Gujarat started off their Ranji season on a wrong note (with a loss to Rajasthan). However they picked up pieces slowly, conceding two points to Punjab before opening their account (two points) against hosts Hyderabad. 

With three more matches to go, the Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel feels that it is still open for them. We still have chance to make the knock-outs; however, what we are looking at is one match at a time, said the former Indian wicketkeeper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chandigarh: Ace defender Dilip Tirkey, who ruled himelf out of the first three matches of the ongoing series, is unlikely to play in the remaining three rubbers in Pakistan as well. The Indian captain sprained his ankle while jogging and has developed a swelling, physiotherapist of the Indian team, Ravi Kanakamedala, said on Sunday.

 The physiotherapist said he could not confirm for how many days Tirkey will be out of action. But considering the tight schedule and the fact that the Pakistan leg starts on Tuesday, it seems unlikely that Tirkey would be available to lead the team in the near future. 

 Frankfurt: Bayern Munich goalkeeper Oliver Kahn is doubtful for Tuesday?s Champions League clash with AC Milan after suffering a badly bruised thigh on Saturday.

 Kahn, the Bayern captain, was forced off early in the second half of a 1-1 draw against Hanover 96 following a challenge with his Germany international colleague Thomas Brdaric.

 ?I don?t know about Tuesday,? Kahn said after the match. ?We?ll have to see. I?ll have to do everything I can to be pain free for the match. I couldn?t run and I couldn?t jump (after the challenge). It was a painful bruise. It made no sense to carry on.? 

 Buenos Aires: Former Argentina captain Diego Simeone ended his 19-year playing career in defeat when Racing Club were beaten 2-1 at leaders Estudiantes de La Plata in the Clausura championship.

 The midfielder, who holds the Argentine record of 106 caps, will begin a new coaching career at the helm of Racing, joint bottom of the table with one point in five games, next weekend. The much-travelled 35-year-old, who played for several big clubs in Spain and Italy during his 14 years in Europe, left the pitch in tears after the defeat, playing for the club he has supported since boyhood. 

 Sydney: Archie Thompson has been added to Australia?s squad for Wednesdays Asian Cup qualifier against Bahrain after being released by PSV Eindhoven.

 Thompson was originally overlooked for the qualifier in Manama because it clashed with his Dutch club?s European Champions League match but was cleared on Sunday to join the Australians.

 ?We have been working behind the scenes for a few weeks now regarding the possible availability of Archie,? Assistant coach Graham Arnold said.

 Miami: The end-of-season PGA Grand Slam of Golf, which brings together the winners of the year?s four major championships, will return to Kauai in Hawaii this year, the organisers have said.

 The PGA of America had considered moving the elite event elsewhere, with Las Vegas and the Caribbean among the possible options.

 ?This year?s purse will also increase to $1.25 million with the winner receiving $500,000, second place $300,000,? the PGA of America said in a statement.

 The 36-hole stroke-play event, billed as ?the most exclusive tournament in golf?, will take place at the Poipu Bay Golf Course on Kauais southern shore from November 21-22.

 Last November, Tiger Woods romped to a seven-shot victory over US PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson. 

 Indore: International wrestler Kripa Shankar Patel will undergo training at the Olympic Training Centre in Colarado Springs for 45 days as part of the preparations for the Asian Games 2006.

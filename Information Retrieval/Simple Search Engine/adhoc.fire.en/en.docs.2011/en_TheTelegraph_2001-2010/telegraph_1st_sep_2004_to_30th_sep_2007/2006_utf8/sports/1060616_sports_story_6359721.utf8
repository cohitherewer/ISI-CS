 Sania crashes in quarters

Birmingham: Sania Mirza crashed out of the DSF Classic International womens tournament when she lost 6-2, 4-6, 6-7 (3-7) to Meilen Tu of the US in the third round on Thursday. 

Sania, ranked No. 40 in the world, frittered her one-set advantage to ultimately bow to the world No. 119 in two hours at the Edgbaston Priory Club. 

In the decider, Sania was twice serving for the match at 5-4 and 6-5. But she couldnt hold her serve either time and was taken to a tie-breaker. The American held her nerve to win it 7-3 and advance to a meeting with Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli. (PTI)

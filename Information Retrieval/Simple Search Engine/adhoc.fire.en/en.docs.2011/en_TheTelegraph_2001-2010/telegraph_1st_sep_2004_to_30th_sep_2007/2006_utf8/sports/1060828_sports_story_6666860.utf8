 ICC tribute to Walcott

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) president Percy Sonn and his predecessors, including Indias Jagmohan Dalmiya, have paid tributes to former ICC chairman and the West Indies cricketing great Clyde Walcott who passed away on Saturday, aged 80. 

I never saw him play but people whose opinions I value have confirmed his greatness to me and his figures, with a Test average of more than 56, means he will rightly be remembered as a giant on the field, Sonn said in a statement issued on Sunday. 

Sonn said Walcott was instrumental in bringing South Africa back into international cricket in 1991. 

Walcott was the ICC chairman from 1993-9. 

Dalmiya offered heartfelt praise for the former ICC chairman. 

Clyde Walcott was a great cricketer and an equally great administrator and he provided tremendous leadership to the ICC, Dalmiya said. 

Ehsan Mani was also glowing in his tributes for Walcott. 

He took over as ICC chairman at a critical time in the history of the organisation and he succeeded in not only keeping it together but also enhancing it.

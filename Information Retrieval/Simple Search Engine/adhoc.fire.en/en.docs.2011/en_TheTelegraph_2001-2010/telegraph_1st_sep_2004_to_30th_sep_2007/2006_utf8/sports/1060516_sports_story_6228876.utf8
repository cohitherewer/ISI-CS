The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India have 

 quality and form to get job done

 Line 

 of fire - Michael Holding

 After the one-day International 

 series against Zimbabwe, the West Indies team will be turning 

 their attention to the upcoming five ODIs against their 

 next opponents India.

 This will be a completely different 

 kettle of fish for the Windies. While Zimbabwe linger at 

 the bottom of both Test and ODI rankings, India have been 

 proving their worth in both forms of the game, and not just 

 on home soil.

 Sure, the Windies have dominated 

 the present series but like this last game, at times Zimbabwe 

 have not been outclassed to the degree at which you would 

 have expected considering their problems with the availability 

 of their best players for selection. And that is good reason 

 for the Windies fans to be a bit sceptical about the upcoming 

 contest.

 Indias batting line-up, 

 even without the injured Sachin Tendulkar, is a formidable 

 one.

 Fans in the Caribbean know a lot 

 about captain Rahul Dravid, and would have seen a bit of 

 Virender Sehwag, and at least heard of the recent exploits 

 of Yuvraj Singh, but add to those, the hard hitting Mahendra 

 Singh Dhoni, Mohammed Kaif and the two young guns Suresh 

 Raina and Ramesh Powar, and you get the idea that the Windies 

 bowling attack could be thoroughly tested this time around.

 Yuvraj has developed tremendously 

 over the last 12 months or so, and is now the finished article 

 and Raina and Powar look to be two young batsmen going places, 

 but Dhoni is a destroyer. He is a powerful man who could 

 make these comparatively small West Indies cricket grounds 

 look like indoor arenas. Perhaps it would not be a bad idea 

 if they were because if he is not dismissed cheaply, the 

 West Indies Cricket Board could end up with an unusually 

 high equipment bill for lost cricket balls.

 It should not be all one way street 

 where powerful hitting is concerned though as Indias 

 captain Dravid has acknowledged that the West Indies batting 

 line-up is not one to be sniffed at. 

 Any team that has players 

 of the quality of Brian Lara, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Chris Gayle 

 and Shivnarain Chanderpaul, is going to be a serious batting 

 line-up is how he put it on his arrival with his team 

 in Jamaica recently and that cannot be denied.

 The Windies will have to be a 

 lot more consistent, it is great to have names on paper 

 but it is the production that counts. 

 So, perhaps with such strong batting 

 line-ups in both teams, it will be the team that bowls and 

 fields better that will end up in front after the five games. 

 The Windies should just be ahead 

 in the fielding stakes with quick sure handed players like 

 Dwayne Bravo, Dwayne Smith, Ronako Morton and even Chanderpaul 

 from the older brigade in the outfield but the inexperienced 

 bowlers will have their work cut out.

 Indias victories in more 

 recent times have come mostly from chasing targets and one 

 could say that is also going to be the best chance of victory 

 for the West Indies as well. So you could possibly see the 

 toss in each match attracting more attention and playing 

 a greater significance than usual.

 India have not won a Test series 

 in the Caribbean since 1971 and have only won three of the 

 38 they have contested with 19 drawn, which means they have 

 lost 16.

 And while the West Indies will 

 be drawing on past experiences and history to prepare mentally 

 for battle, India will be trying to put those statistics 

 behind them and concentrate on the present. 

 They certainly have the quality 

 and better recent form to get the job done. (PTI)

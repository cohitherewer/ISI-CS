 Kapur only Indian to make cut

Loch Lomond (Scotland): Putting proved crucial at the Barclays Scottish Open at Loch Lomond as two of the three Indian contenders missed the cut solely on that account. 

Jyoti Randhawa, placed as high as tied 10th after the first round which finished on Friday morning, plummeted to tied 109th to miss the cut with a second round of six-over 77, while Jeev Milkha Singh was forced to take the weekend off after he fell short by one shot. 

For the Chandigarh golfer, the bogey on the 15th was the crucial difference as he finished with a one-over 72 for the second round to end 70th. 

The lone Indian making it to the weekend was young Shiv Kapur, who will now use it to tune up for the British Open next week. He knocked in a card of two-under 69 and made the cut on the line at tied 61st place with a total of one-under 141. 

For Jeev, the heartbreak came on the 15th, when he bogeyed the hole, as he had earlier done on the first, 10th, 11th and 13th. His birdies were on fourth, sixth, seventh and 14th and he needed 30 putts, despite making 13 of the fairways. 

That tells the story, said a disappointed Jeev.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Michelle is amazing: Jeev Milkha 

 - History-creating teenager isnt scared to try out things, feels in-form Indian star

Calcutta: Teenaged Michelle Wie finished no better than joint 35th in the SK Telecom Open, a major mens Tour event in Seoul, but shes going to be talked about for a long time. 

Michelle made the cut after failing seven times, but its difficult saying how soon can a repeat be authored... The course and the weather may become big factors... Of course, theres no doubt she will dominate womens golf for 15-20 years, Jeev Milkha Singh told The Telegraph. 

The in-form Indian star, who finished joint second and pocketed around $50,000, added: What stands out is that Michelle is aggressive and isnt scared to try out things... Then, she drives the ball hard and, as we all saw, attracts a big gallery. Thats great for her and for golf. 

Jeev, who left for Nagoya straight after the meet (and, so, couldnt confirm his share of the prize money), didnt get to interact with Michelle, though. 

Speaking from the Japanese city late on Sunday, he said: We were in different halves and, because of the timings, I couldnt have a chat. However, her presence was well received by the male pros... Michelle got the credit she deserved for making the cut so comfortably... Shes quite amazing.

On Friday, Michelle had become the first woman in 61 years (after Babe Zaharias) to make the cut in a major mens Tour event. 

Jeev, who won the Volvo China Open less than a month ago, is now going to prepare for the Japan PGA Championship in Gifu, near Nagoya. Its a big one, beginning Thursday... Then, in a few weeks, Ill be off to England and give my best shot at the BMW meet in Wentworth... 

Obviously, winning the co-sanctioned European Tour event in Beijing has made a world of a difference. Jeev accepted as much: Yes, my confidence has increased and, nowadays, Im trusting myself more in pressure situations... I intend aiming much higher... 

That the 34-year-old must aim high is something he learnt very early from father Milkha Singh.

 Cisse dreams fractured

St Etienne: Djibril Cisse will miss the World Cup after fracturing his right leg in Frances 3-1 win over China in their final warm-up game on Wednesday. He has already undergone surgery. 

France coach Raymond Domenech said after the match in St Etienne: Its a vicious blow to all of us. Everything was going so well. All the players are depressed. Even during the game you could see it. They just lost interest in the game. 

The rule is that we can replace an injured player until a day before the first match. For the moment I have other worries. Then well think about it and talk about it between us. 

On Thursday, Domenech called up Sidney Govou of Olympique Lyon to replace Cisse, the French Football Federation (FFF) said. 

Federation president Jean-Pierre Escalettes told French radio that Cisse had fractured his right fibula and shinbone (tibia). 

The Liverpool forward was hurt in a clash with China captain and defender Zheng Zhi ten minutes into in his teams final warm-up 

Grimacing with pain, he was taken away on a stretcher and received treatment on his right leg for several minutes before going to hospital.

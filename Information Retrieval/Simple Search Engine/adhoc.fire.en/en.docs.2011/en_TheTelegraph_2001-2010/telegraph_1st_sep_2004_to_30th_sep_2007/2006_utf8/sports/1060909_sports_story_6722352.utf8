New York: Top-seeded Roger Federer dropped a set and had a hard time putting away No. 5 James Blake before finishing a 7-6 (9-7), 6-0, 6-7 (9-11), 6-4 victory on Thursday at the US Open to reach a record-tying 10th consecutive Grand Slam semi-final. 

The score says it all. The match could have been easier. Could have been tougher. We both missed our opportunities here and there, but thats kind of expected, because we took our chances on our shots, Federer said. It turned out to be a thriller. 

Even in the toughest of moments, Federer was so masterful that Blake and the partisan audience in Arthur Ashe Stadium showed their admiration. Some of Federers winners were met with applause from a capacity crowd of 23,712, other shots made Blake acknowledge aloud how impressed he was. 

There are times you just have to say, Too good, and move on, said the American, who came into the night 0-4 against Federer, having lost all 10 sets theyd played. 

Theres just too many things he does well. He doesnt panic. He plays offence unbelievably well. He plays defence better than anyone Ive ever played. 

But Blake did not go quietly, saving a total of three match points and breaking Federer twice when he served for the match, at 5-3 in the third set and 5-2 in the fourth, celebrating the latter with a little strut. 

I take pride in the way I fought, Blake said. Its a good feeling to know that Im close to Roger. ...I guess hes human. 

Right until the very end, Blake kept pushing, holding a break point and staving off two match points in the final game. Blake also saved a match point in the third-set tiebreaker, and certainly had other chances: He wasted three set points in the opening tie-breaker and three break points at 1-0 in the fourth set. 

It took a while today, but look, its tough, Federer said. You make mistakes, he plays well, and momentum shifts. 

Federer, the two-time defending champion, advanced to a semi-final Saturday against Russian No. 7 Nikolay Davydenko, who dropped the first two sets in a half-empty stadium, then came back to beat No. 14 Tommy Haas of Germany 4-6, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. 

The other mens semi-final will be No. 9 Andy Roddick against unseeded Russian Mikhail Youzhny, who upset Rafael Nadal in the quarter finals on Wednesday. 

Id probably like to play Andy, I guess, but (were) not quite there yet, Federer said. We look like the big favourites, but weve seen what happens to favourites sometimes, so we have to be careful. 

Davydenko and Youzhny give Russia two mens semi-finalists at a Grand Slam tournament for only the second time in the Open era, which began in 1968. Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov lost in the final four at the 2001 US Open. 

Blake never has been past the quarter finals at a Slam; he lost at the same stage here last year to Andre Agassi. 

Federer, meanwhile, hasnt lost before the semi-finals at a major since the 2004 French Open. His 10 semi-finals in a row match Ivan Lendls run from 1985-88 as the longest in the Open era, and Federer is aiming for his ninth Grand Slam title. 

He hadnt lost a set at this tournament until Thursday, and he sure came close to dropping the opener against Blake. Federer broke at love for a 5-4 edge with a spinning return, but Blake broke right back with the help of a double-fault and two unforced errors. They went to the tie-breaker, where Blake won five straight points to 6-4. 

Federer erased the first set point with an ace, and Blake gave away two others with a long forehand, then a return into the net. 

The highest drama came in the third-set tie-breaker. Federer was a single point from winning at 9-8 after a 30-stroke exchange ended with Blake dumping a backhand into the net. But Blake extended the match with a backhand winner down the line. 

Finally, Blake closed the tie-breaker on his fifth set point, when Federer slipped to his knees while trying to hit a passing shot. 

Blake was in position for a 2-0 edge in the fourth set, with Federer serving at love-40. But Federer won the next five points, with three service winners, a forehand winner and a Blake error. 

Serving for the win for a third time, Federer did come through, the match ending on a shot into the net by Blake. The American hung in there, but he could not prevent Federer from improving to 68-5 this season. (AP)

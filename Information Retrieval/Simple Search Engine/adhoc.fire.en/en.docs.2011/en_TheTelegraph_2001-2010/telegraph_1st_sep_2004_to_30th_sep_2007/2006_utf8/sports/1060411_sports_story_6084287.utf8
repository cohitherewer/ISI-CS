Calcutta: It is going to be another comeback on the Maidan for one of its most controversial characters. Former East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick took over as Mohammedan Sporting coach on Monday, after the black-and-white brigade lost to Sporting Clube de Goa 0-3 on Saturday and coach Mohammed Habib left for home citing illness. Bhowmick was handed an open contract till 2007 season. 

After remaining in oblivion for over four months the assignment has given Bhowmick some respite in life. It may be recalled that Bhowmick ?? who was a Central Excise superintendent ??? was allegedly caught while taking bribes by Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI) on December 2. 

Bhowmick has been making several appearances in the court, but following an offer from the Mohammedan Sporting club on Monday morning, he instantly decided to take up the challenge. 

This morning I got an offer from the club and decided to take it, said Bhowmick. I was moved by their approach and decided not to disappoint them. What moved me more was that even some senior players of the team called me up and asked me to help them. 

Though I was confident of a comeback, I was not sure an offer like this will come so soon, said the new Mohammedan Sporting coach at his New Alipore residence, before leaving for Goa to join his squad. 

Mohammedan Sporting who now have 14 points from 12 matches will face holders Dempo on Wednesday. 

Bhowmicks appointment was announced at a hurriedly convened media conference at the club tent on Monday afternoon. Our present coach Mohammed Habib cant continue his job since he is ill. This is a very crucial juncture for us in the league and I think none other than Subhas Bhowmick can help us to drag the team out of this situation, said club secretary Sultan Ahmed. 

The secretary also went on to add that: We have nothing to do with his private life. We have just honoured a good coach. 

On his new assignment, Bhowmick said that it is going to be a tough task for him but he is hopeful that he would be able to produce good results. Honestly, I know nothing about the team. I have seen them play but thats only casually and not from a coachs angle. I have to discuss with the senior players and plan accordingly, said Bhowmick. 

He has set his eyes on the remaining five matches in the National League. This kind of challenge is not new to me. When I took over as East Bengal coach in 2002, the club was going through a bad phase and we finished fifth that year in the National League. Then we won the league in 2002-03 and 2003-04 and we finished third in 2004-05. 

Then when we went to play the ASEAN Cup and neither the club management nor Mr (Vijay) Mallya was confident that we can do something, but our performance stunned everybody. 

On Bhaichung Bhutia, he said that the striker was in his prime but declined to make any comment on East Bengal. Now I am Mohammden Sportings coach so ask me about my club, he signed off.

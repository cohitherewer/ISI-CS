London: Thierry Henry scored an emotional hattrick as Arsenal said farewell to Highbury with a 4-2 win over Wigan Athletic to earn a place in the Champions League qualifying round on a dramatic last day of the Premier League on Sunday. 

The win enabled the Champions League finalists to finish fourth and heralded an all-night party at the ground they are leaving after 93 years. 

The victory lifted them above north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who lost 1-2 at West Ham United after a food poisoning episode in the Spurs camp. 

Manchester United made sure of second place and automatic entry to the Champions League with a 4-0 home thrashing of Charlton Athletic, leaving them a point clear of Liverpool, whose 3-1 victory at Portsmouth was in vain. 

Champions Chelsea signed off with a 1-0 defeat at Newcastle United. 

It also completed a black day for Spurs which had began badly when a food poisoning outbreak laid most of their squad low and threatened their match at Upton Park. 

The Premier League insisted the game went ahead and Martin Jol was able to field a full-strength team. 

 Ruud van Nistelrooy left the ground before kickoff apparently annoyed after discovering that young striker Giuseppe Rossi had been selected ahead of him.

 Court restrains BCCI

 Dalmiya Issue

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta: The city civil 

 court on Thursday passed an order restraining the BCCI from 

 asking former president Jagmohan Dalmiya to appear before 

 its disciplinary committee till disposal of the case. The 

 BCCI, in a recent notice, had asked Dalimiya to appear before 

 its disciplinary committee in Chennai on Tuesday.

 P.K. Sarkar, chief judge of the 

 city civil court, passed this order on an injunction application 

 moved by Dalmiya.

 His lawyer, Gitanath Ganguly, 

 informed the court on Thursday that on July 25, the BCCI 

 had issued notice to his client, asking him to appear before 

 its disciplinary committee at Mumbai on July 27.

 Even though the case is 

 pending, the BCCI had issued a second notice asking my client 

 to appear before the committee on August 15, Ganguly 

 said.

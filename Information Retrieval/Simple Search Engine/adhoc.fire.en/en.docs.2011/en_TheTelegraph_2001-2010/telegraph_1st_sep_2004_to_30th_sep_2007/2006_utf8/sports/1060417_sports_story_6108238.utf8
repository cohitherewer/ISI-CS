 BCCI: Sachin rehabilitation on schedule

New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar is recovering well and his rehabilitation process after a shoulder operation is on as per schedule, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Sunday. 

Sachin continues to improve and has advanced to this point of his recovery schedule with no setbacks, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a statement. 

The overall management of his problem has progressed as planned with improvements in all the areas assessed (ranges of movement, pain levels and dysfunction), Shah said. 

Sachin underwent the operation on his right shoulder last month in London. 

His rehabilitation programme consists of three phases, the first of which ended on Sunday. He would be reassessed again on Friday when the second phase ends, the BCCI statement said. 

The third and final phase runs up to May 1, after which the Mumbaikar is expected to begin batting practice with a light bat. 

The eight-week recovery schedule is most likely to put him out of the one-day segment of Indias tour of the West Indies. (PTI)

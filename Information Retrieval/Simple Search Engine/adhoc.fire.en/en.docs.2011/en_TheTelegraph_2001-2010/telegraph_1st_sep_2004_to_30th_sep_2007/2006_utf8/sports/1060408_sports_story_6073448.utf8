 Shiv fights off Lee for berth

 - British Open

 - Indian wins 4-hole playoff to make first Major 

 Shiv Kapur 

Singapore: Indias Shiv Kapur emerged victorious from a four-hole playoff to secure a berth at this years British Open alongside Australian duo Jarrod Lyle and Uhno Park in the 36-hole final Asian qualifiers on Friday. 

With three slots up for grabs at the seasons third major, overnight leader Lyle fired a one-under-par 71 on the Sentosa Golf Clubs Serapong Course to post a two-round six under 138 that was matched by Park, who recorded a 70. 

Shiv finished a shot further back in a tie with South Koreas Lee Sung, forcing a sudden-death playoff to decide who would join the Australian pair at The Open, being played at Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake, England, from July 20-23. 

After matching pars over the first three extra holes, Lee cracked under pressure, hooking his drive into water at the par-five 18th, leaving Shiv the simple task of registering a par to secure a maiden trip to golfs oldest major. 

All three qualifiers will be making their Open debuts at Royal Liverpool. 

The Indian, who won his first title in Bangkok last December and was crowned 2005 Asian Tour Rookie of the Year, is relishing the prospect of his trip to Britain to play in his first major. 

Its pretty cool to be in The Open, its been great this past one year, said the 24-year-old, who closed with a 70 that included a crucial birdie on the last. 

Ive always dreamed of playing in a major as a kid and for it to come this early in my career, Im pretty stoked. This makes my career a bit better. 

It was a bit of hard work but I think preparation like this will make me stronger. Personally, I wouldnt want to get into too many play-offs as it wasnt easy on the nerves. 

Jeev Milkha Singh may well have been in the play-off, too, but for a horrendous triple bogey on the par-3 14th hole. 

Jeev ended with 69 and 73 at two-under and three behind Shiv and Park, tied fifth with Chapchai Nirat of Thailand. 

Amandeep Johl (73, 73) and Rahil Gangjee (77, 73) were the other Indians who failed to make the grade. 

Shiv becomes the third Indian after Gaurav Ghei (1997), Jyoti Randhawa (2000, 2003 and 2004) and Arjun Atwal (2004) to make it to the British Open. Randhawa, however was the only one to make the cut and play on all four days. 

Lyle overcame leukaemia seven years ago and the 25-year-old has enjoyed a remarkable start to his career since turning professional just 18 months ago. 

Its a dream come true. I cant wait to get over there and see whats its all about, Lyle told reporters.

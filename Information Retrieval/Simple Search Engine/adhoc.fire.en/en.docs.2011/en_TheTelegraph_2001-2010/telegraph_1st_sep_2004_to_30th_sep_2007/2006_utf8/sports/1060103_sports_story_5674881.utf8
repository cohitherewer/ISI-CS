 Fresh itinerary announced

Karachi: The minor security irritants concerning Indias tour of Pakistan were finally ironed out on Monday with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announcing fresh dates for the five one-dayers in its final itinerary. 

The PCB was forced to readjust the dates of all the one-dayers on account of Muharram. 

The Indian team will arrive in Lahore on January 5 and will play the three Tests as scheduled in Lahore (Jan 13-17), Faisalabad (Jan 21-25) and Karachi from January 29 to February 2. 

However, the one-day series will start from Peshawar where the first game will be played on February 6. 

Rawalpindi will host the second game on February 11 and the third will be played in Lahore on February 13. The fourth match will be in Multan on February 16 while the series ends in Karachi on February 19. 

The one-day series was originally proposed to start from Rawalpindi on February 8 but taking into consideration the holy month of Muharram, in which processions are taken out, the PCB, in consultation with the interior ministry, made the adjustments. 

There are minimum adjustments and they have been made so that the respective host cities can provide as much security cover to the citizens during the Muharram processions as much as to the two teams. Naturally, Muharram is a holy month and its sanctity has to be maintained, PCB director (board operations) Abbas Zaidi said. 

ITINERARY 

Jan. 5: Arrival in Lahore; Jan. 7-9: Three-dayer at Bagh-e-Jinnah in Lahore; Jan. 13-17: First Test in Lahore; Jan. 21-25: Second Test in Faisalabad; Jan. 29-Feb. 2: Third Test in Karachi; Feb. 6: First ODI in Peshawar; Feb. 11: Second ODI in Rawalpindi; Feb. 13: Third ODI in Lahore; Feb. 16: Fourth ODI in Multan; Feb. 19: Fifth ODI in Karachi.

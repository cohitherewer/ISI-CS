Calcutta: City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee on Friday said he agreed with what Sourav Ganguly said in his e-mail regarding some people in the CAB trying to ruin his career. 

Sourav had been dropped for non-cricketing reasons. We feel that the CAB should have protested more strongly against his axing, he said. 

Mukherjee, who officially released the e-mail to the media at the Police AC tent, said: We always knew that Souravs support was with us. He wasnt duty-bound to send any e-mail. This is the first time that his views have been made public to set to rest misgivings in certain quarters. This is a private e-mail, sent to his brother, that has been made public. 

Asked if he would initiate an inquiry into the Greg Chappell e-mail leak if voted to power, Mukherjee said: Lets be practical and not hypothetical. 

Asked if he felt people in the CAB were playing with players careers, Mukherjee said: Im not here to interpret the letter? It is for you to interpret the contents. 

Snehashish Ganguly, who was sitting next to the police commissioner, said: A lot of other players will also have the same opinion. 

Mukherjee opined in favour of having an independent observer at the AGM. 

Mukherjee also laid out plans. The clubs interests havent been looked after. The CAB administration is being neglected. 

Our Legal Reporter adds: The executive committee of the CAB on Friday declined to accept the proposal of city civil court judge P.K. Sarkar, who suggested that nominees of the two rival sides could be appointed observers to monitor the new executive body election on July 30. After hearing both sides, the judge adjourned the hearing till July 25.

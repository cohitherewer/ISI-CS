 Confused IHF not sure how to protest

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The new Olympic qualification format introduced by the FIH is likely to hit India and other Asian nations hard, but the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) is still not sure how to protest. 

The FIH, in a recent decision (ratified by the International Olympic Committee during the Turin Winter Games), has increased the direct Olympic qualification quota from six to nine, and introduced three qualification tournaments for 18 countries to battle for the remaining three spots. 

Under the new rule, the five continental champions and the hosts will take up six berths. The other three direct qualifiers will be as per FIH world rankings. 

The ranking system is not very accurate as it does not take into account more than one-third of international matches and also gives more points for European tournaments than any Asian meet. 

IHF secretary K. Jyothikumaran said: IHF was not consulted by FIH before the rule was changed. And since the FIH competition committee, which framed the rule, has no Indian representative, there was none to protect the interest of the eight-time Olympic champions. 

Previously, we had Munir Sait in the committee for a long time, but he has retired, Jyothikumaran said. 

We have not even discussed it (new rule) at the IHF level. May be we can ask the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF) to take up the case since this rule could also affect the other Asian nations. 

The IHF may be confused, but Sahara India, one of the four sponsors of the international hockey body, are unhappy over the new rule development. According to IHF sources, the company has informed the FIH bosses about its reservation against such a rule. 

The IHF is yet to wake up to reality. India will now have to either win the Doha Asian Games gold or finish in the top-six in the next World Cup to make the Olympic cut directly. Otherwise, they would have to fight for three places in the qualifiers.

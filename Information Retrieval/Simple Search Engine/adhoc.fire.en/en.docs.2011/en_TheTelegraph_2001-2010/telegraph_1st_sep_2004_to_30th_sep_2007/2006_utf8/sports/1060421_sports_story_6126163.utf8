 Kaifs record is good, says More

 - No deputy for Mahendra Singh Dhoni in XV 

Mumbai: A struggling Mohammed Kaif was retained and Sourav Ganguly ignored again by the national selectors on Thursday when they picked the 15-member one-day squad for the series in the West Indies next month. 

There is no change from the squad that took on Pakistan in the two one-dayers in Abu Dhabi. The BCCI, it also seems, shot down the idea of a 16-member side. 

As many as nine of the players would be visiting the Caribbean for the first time. Captain Rahul Dravid, Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Kaif, Ajit Agarkar and Virender Sehwag have been there before. 

Dravid and coach Greg Chappell joined the five national selectors immediately on their arrival from Abu Dhabi. 

Chief selector Kiran More said Sachin Tendulkar, recovering after a shoulder operation, was not included on the basis of physio John Glosters report to the Board. Gloster will meet Sachin and assess his progress. A clear picture on his availability for the Test series will be known later, More said. 

There was no second wicketkeeper in the side as the selectors felt Dravid and Uthappa could take over if needed. 

More said that all players were in contention for the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean. Whoever performs well in the domestic championships will be eligible for selection. 

On Kaifs inclusion, More said the Uttar Pradesh batsmans past performance was given weightage. We all decided that we should back Kaif. His record is good and hes an outstanding fielder, too. Yes, his form is worrying. Even Sehwag had a form slump but played a brilliant innings of 73 on Wednesday, More said. 

More sounded very pleased with the teams performance in the season that has brought 22 wins in 34 matches. 

On the continued omission of Anil Kumble, More said: Hes our main bowler (in Tests). When we need him we will definitely call him. 

The squad for the four-Test series, commencing June 2, would be chosen after the third ODI on May 23, Board secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

The Indians will not have any conditioning camp before their departure, Shah informed. The players will assemble here on May 10 before departing the next day.

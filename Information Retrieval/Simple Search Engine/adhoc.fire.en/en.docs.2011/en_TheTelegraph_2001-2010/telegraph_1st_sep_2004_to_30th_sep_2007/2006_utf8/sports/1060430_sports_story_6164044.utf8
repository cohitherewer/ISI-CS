 Nafees fined for dissent

London: Bangladesh batsman Shahriar Nafees has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee for dissent after being dismissed in the third one-dayer against Australia. 

Nafees reacted angrily on Friday after being given out leg before for a duck to the third ball of the match by left-arm paceman Mitchell Johnson, en route to the hosts nine-wicket defeat in Fatullah. 

He shook his head and gestured with his bat towards the Bangladesh dressing room as he left the field. 

The player admitted what he had done was wrong and I took this, together with his previously exemplary conduct, into account, Match Referee Jeff Crowe said in a statement. (Agencies)

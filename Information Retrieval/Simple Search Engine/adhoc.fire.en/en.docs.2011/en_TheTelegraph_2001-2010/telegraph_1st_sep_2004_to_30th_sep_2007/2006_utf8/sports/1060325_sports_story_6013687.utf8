 RAVI SHASTRI

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 Sometimes I fail to judge the quick leg-break deliveries. 

 Please help. 

 Abir Bhattacharya, 14, 

 Calcutta-74

 Watch the hand closely and dont 

 commit yourself with your footwork. 

 I am a mediumpacer and have 

 been facing a problem for sometime now. Whenever I try to 

 bowl a yorker it ends up being a full toss. Why does this 

 happen? 

 Tirtharup Chatterjee, 14, 

 Sreerampore

 It demands a lot of practice. 

 Aim for the base of the stump and see how it goes. Take 

 it from there.

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 I have noticed that of late I have been clean bowled the 

 maximum number of times. This is also happening within a 

 few deliveries after coming to the crease. Please help. 

 Krishnendu Paul, 16, 

 Durgapur

 You are obviously not watching 

 the ball closely. Also try and get behind the line of the 

 ball.

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 I often get caught at square-leg when trying to play bouncer. 

 Please help.

 Syed Kashif Jawed, 16, 

 Bardhaman

 Keep your eyes on the ball and 

 use the depth of the crease when playing back.

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 Against a leg-spinner I tend to get bowled or stumped when 

 trying to go on the attack. Please help. 

 Subhajit Roy, 16, 

 Calcutta-27

 Make sure you get as close as 

 possible to the pitch of the ball. 

 I am a mediumpacer and have 

 problems with my run-up. I tend not to generate enough pace 

 from my run-up. Please help. 

 Kulachandrama Pradhan, 16, 

 Puri

 Accelerate gradually and make 

 sure you are balanced at the time of delivery.

 I am a mediumpacer. When 

 the batsman is in a murderous mood, what should be the ideal 

 length to bowl at him? 

 Sushil Chakraborty, 18,

 Asansol

 Good length as they say and make 

 sure you vary your pace.

 I am a wicketkeeper. How 

 can I improve my leg side collec- tion? 

 Tapan Roy, 19, 

 Calcutta-42

 You should work on your footwork 

 and technique. 

 I am a left-arm spinner. 

 Should I bowl round the wicket when there a few spots created 

 near the good length area? 

 Ram P. Yadav, 19, 

 Jamshedpur

 Should bowl round the wicket most 

 of the time and use over the wicket only as a variation.

 I am a mediumpacer. What 

 are the advantages of having an upright seam when bowling? 

 Subhashish Adhikari, 23, 

 Calcutta

 Helps you get the ball to swing 

 and seam.

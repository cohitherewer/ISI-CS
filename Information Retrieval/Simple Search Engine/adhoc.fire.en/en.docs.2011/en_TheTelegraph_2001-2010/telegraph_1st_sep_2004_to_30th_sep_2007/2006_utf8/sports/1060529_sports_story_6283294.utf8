 A pilot and his other interest...

 Port-of-Spain: These are 

 good times for commercial pilots in the Caribbean ? British 

 West Indies Airways (BWIA), for example, has announced a 

 hefty 50 per cent increase in salaries. Colin Croft, though, 

 isnt sure whether hes going to benefit. 

The one-time tearaway, it may be recalled, flies the De Havilland 50-seater turboprops for BWIA subsidiary Tobago Express. Its a regional carrier. 

 I dont know whether 

 even I stand to gain... Im, of course, on leave till 

 the end of the India tour (July 4), Croft, who does 

 quite a bit of Media work, told The Telegraph on 

 Sunday. He has a convenient arrangement with his employers 

 whereby hes off duty during the West Indies 

 commitments. 

I dont take any other leave. In an emergency, however, I could be called up, Croft added. 

He qualified as a commercial pilot as early as 1981, from the Flight Safety Academy in Florida, but began flying professionally only in 1994. I had to first get a conversion license from the UK, was his explanation. 

Croft started off as an Air Traffic Controller (in Guyana, Puerto Rico and here), in fact he held that position even while playing for the West Indies from 1976-77 till the early 1980s, and worked with Pratt and Whitney in the US before returning to fly as a pro in the West Indies. 

 I was an engineer there (Pratt and Whitney), 

 between 1988 and 1992, he said. Well, theres 

 much about Croft thats interesting.

 Joyce to replace Trescothick

Sydney: Irish-born batsman Ed Joyce was called into the England Ashes squad touring Australia on Wednesday as a replacement for Marcus Trescothick, who left the team and returned home because of a stress-related illness. 

The 28-year-old Middlesex left-hander is uncapped at Test level but has played three one-day Internationals for England after previously representing Ireland at the under-19 World Cup. 

He will join the 16-man squad in Adelaide on Friday after Trescothick quit the tour and returned home with a recurrence of depression. 

Ed is a highly promising player who has performed well for Middlesex this season and I am sure he will be delighted to be part of an Ashes squad, Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney said in a statement. 

Joyce had already been selected in a shadow squad of English Academy players that will train in Australia on standby in case any senior players are injured and need replacing. 

He was promoted to the senior squad after the England selectors opted for a versatile middle-order batsman to replace Trescothick, who is a specialist opener. 

Alastair Cook is now expected to be bumped up the order to open the batting with Andrew Strauss with Ian Bell at three, Paul Collingwood at four, Kevin Pietersen at five and captain Andrew Flintoff at six. 

Joyce is unlikely to be selected in the side for the first Test starting in Brisbane on November 23.

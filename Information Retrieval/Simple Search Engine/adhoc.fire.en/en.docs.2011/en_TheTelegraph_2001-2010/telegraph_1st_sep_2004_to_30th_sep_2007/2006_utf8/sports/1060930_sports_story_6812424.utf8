 Indians out of recurve events 

New Delhi: The Indian team of Jayant Talukdar, Tarundeep Rai and Mangal Singh were upset by Belarus in a close first-round match in the mens team recurve event at the archery World Cup in Shanghai on Friday. 

It was a very close match with the scores being tied 110-110 and it needed a shoot-off to decide the winner. 

Belarus shot 27 with their additional three arrows, whereas the third-ranked Indian team could only score 24 and failed to advance to the quarter finals. 

However, the womens team avenged the defeat of their men counterparts by defeating Belarus en route to team recurve quarter finals, where they lost to China. 

Indian team of Chekrovolu Sworu, Reena Kumari and Punya Prabha, also ranked third, had defeated Britain in the pre-quarter finals. 

In the womens team compound event, the fifth ranked team of Jhanu Hansda, Manjuda Soy and Bhagyabati Chanu faltered against the fourth-ranked The Philippines in the pre-quarters. (PTI)

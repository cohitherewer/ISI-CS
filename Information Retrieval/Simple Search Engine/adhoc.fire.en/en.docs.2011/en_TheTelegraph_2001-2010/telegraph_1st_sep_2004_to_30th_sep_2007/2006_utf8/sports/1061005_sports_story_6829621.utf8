 India go down to China too

 - Womens hockey 

Madrid: Indias miserable run in the womens Hockey World Cup touched a new low as they went down 0-1 to minnows China in their last league match to finish bottom of pool A on Wednesday. 

After losing three games and drawing with England, India put on a dismal performance and finished their league fixture with just one point. 

With this loss, India enter the play-off round as the last of the 12 teams. 

China, who had lost all their previous league matches, scored what turned out to be the matchwinner via Fu Bao Rong in the 25th minute. 

The Indians made hardly any good goal-scoring moves. The forwards were completely listless and incoherent for the entire duration of the game. India got as many as three penalty corners in the last ten minutes but could not capitalise on them. 

China tasted success when Bao Rong, intercepting a pass, slammed the ball in the Indian net from close range with 10 minutes to go for the breather. 

Before that an athletic Li Gao had kept the Indian defence busy and had almost scored when after a good run from the right she passed on the ball to Li Hong Xia, who failed to put it through. 

India stepped up the gas but the moves were disorganised and lacked sting. 

Spain, meanwhile, clinched last semi-final place with a 1-1 draw with England. They join The Netherlands, Australia and defending champions Argentina in the last four. The Netherlands face Argentina, while Spain meet Australia. 

In another match on Wednesday, Olympic champions Germany drew 0-0 on pool A. (PTI)

 Barua, Negi are joint leaders

 Holland Chess

 Barua (above) and 

 Negi 

 Vlissingen (The Netherlands): 

 Parimarjan Negi yet again came up with a brilliant performance 

 to beat International Master Koen Leenhouts of Holland and 

 moved to joint lead after the end of the fifth round of 

 the Hogeschool Zeeland International chess tournament here.

 The five-member Indian contingent 

 had a good day in the nine-rounds Swiss tournament with 

 GM Dibyendu Barua still maintaining his joint lead even 

 after settling for a draw with top seed GM Mikhail Gurevich 

 of Turkey.

 IM Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and 

 IM in waiting Saptarshi Roy registered easy victories over 

 Dutchmen Plukkel Sjoerd and Haak Eelko respectively. IM 

 Roktim Bandyopadhyay was held by another local hopeful Frans 

 Wolferink.

 With four rounds remaining in 

 the tournament, the lead is now shared by as many as nine 

 players with 4.5 points apiece. 

 They are second seed Michal Krasenkow 

 of Poland, GM Sergey Erenburg of Israel, GMs Friso Nijboer 

 and Erwin Lami from Holland, GM Vyacheslav Ikonnikov 

 of Russia, GM Li Shilong of China, IM Thomas Henrichs of 

 Germany, Barua and Negi.

 As many as 22 players including 

 Roy Chowdhury and Roy share the 10th spot with four points 

 each in their kitty while Bandyopadhyay is in the next group, 

 having earned 3.5 points so far. 

 Worlds youngest GM, Negis 

 game was nearly one sided as Leenhouts was outwitted quite 

 early in a Ruy Lopez game.

 Having recently added Ruy Lopez 

 as black in his opening repertoire, Negi was up against 

 a Worrel attack and got a good position in the middle game 

 when Leenhouts failed to strike upon the right plan.

 Getting a lot of play on the Queen 

 Side, Parimarjan forced Leenhouts queen on the edge of the 

 board and later masterminded a fine trick to trap the queen 

 with his two knights. Leenhouts was conquered in just 30 

 moves.

 Barua played the white side of 

 a Pirc Defense and had Gurevich in some troubles in the 

 middle game after the players charted on less trodden paths 

 right from the early stages of the middle game. 

 Playing skillfully, Barua had 

 the center under absolute control and Gurevich sensed some 

 troubles before sacrificing a piece on the 16th move to 

 get the desired counter play.

 Barua had to find some correct 

 moves thereafter and after the complexities ended, the Indian 

 had two minor pieces in the resulting endgame against Gurevichs 

 rook and an extra pawn.

 Normally such positions favour 

 the player having rook, and barua rightly sacrificed his 

 extra material at the first opportunity to reach a level 

 bishops and pawns endgame.

 The result of the game was never 

 in doubt from this stage and the players signed peace after 

 57 moves, when both had successfully promoted their pawns 

 to new queens.

 In the sixth round game, Negi 

 has been pitted against GM Konstantin Landa of Russia while 

 Barua is set to play Erwin Lami.

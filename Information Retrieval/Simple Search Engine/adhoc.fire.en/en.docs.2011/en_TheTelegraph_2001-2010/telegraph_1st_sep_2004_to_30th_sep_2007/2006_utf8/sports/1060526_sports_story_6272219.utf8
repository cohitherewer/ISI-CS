 back his cellphone from the taxi driver on Thursday

Calcutta: East Bengals first-ever foreign coach Philippe de Ridder on Thursday tasted a unique act of honesty ? far from his usual love-and-hate relationship with the fans. The Belgian lost his cellphone on his way to the club tent from Salt Lake on Thursday morning, only to get it back within an hour. 

De Ridder left his cellphone behind in a cab on his way to the Maidan tent. Kartik Saha, the taxi driver, heard it ring and realised what had happened. He wasted little time in returning to East Bengal club and handed it over to the coach. 

Moved by the drivers act of honesty, the Belgian gave him a cash award. The club officials will also present with a club jersey.

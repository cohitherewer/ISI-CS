 Speculation over Dalmiya resignation

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After being expelled from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), there is speculation that Jagmohan Dalmiya may resign from the CAB presidents post at the working committee meeting on Wednesday. The meeting has been convened with a one-point agenda Dalmiyas expulsion from the BCCI. 

While Dalmiya was non-committal about his resignation I am not saying anything now Youll only know about it tomorrow, he said Tuesday evening it is learnt that even if he chooses to do so, as per the rules, the CAB will have to call another emergent meeting to accept the same. 

According to a source, Dalmiya no more wants to involve the CAB in his fight against the BCCI. It appears that he no more wants to involve the CAB in his fight with the BCCI, and will fight it out with the BCCI on his own. 

The former BCCI president confirmed he will not attend the meeting. Since the issue relates to me I will maintain the tradition Ive been doing over more than 20 years. 

I am not going to attend the meeting and one of the vice-presidents will chair the meeting, he said. 

To see whether BCCI has the right to expel Dalmiya, a resolution for the formation of a one-man legal committee is also likely to be taken on Wednesday. The committee may consist of only former West Bengal Chief Minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray.

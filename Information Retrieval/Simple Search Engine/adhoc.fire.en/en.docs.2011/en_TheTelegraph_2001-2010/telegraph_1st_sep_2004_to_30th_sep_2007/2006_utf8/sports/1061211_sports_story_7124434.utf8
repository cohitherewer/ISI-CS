 Team India disqualified 

New Delhi: A radio communication failure saw Team India being disqualified in unfortunate circumstances in the feature race of the A1 Grand Prix in Sentul, Indonesia, on Sunday. 

After finishing 18th in the sprint race, Armaan Ebrahim was disqualified for a penalty infringement. As the sequence of events unfolded, Ebrahim followed the incorrect guidance of a marshal to his grid slot for the feature race, which was deemed a jump-start. 

The team was consequently given a drive through penalty which, under A1 GP regulations, must be taken within three laps of notification. 

Radio communication problems, however, hindered the team from informing Ebrahim of the penalty and the team missed the three lap window, resulting in the Team India car being shown the black flag and disqualified from the race. 

Ebrahim said: Obviously Im disappointed, the marshal on my grid slot told me to move forward, which I did. And I had no way of knowing that the team were calling me in for a drive through penalty.

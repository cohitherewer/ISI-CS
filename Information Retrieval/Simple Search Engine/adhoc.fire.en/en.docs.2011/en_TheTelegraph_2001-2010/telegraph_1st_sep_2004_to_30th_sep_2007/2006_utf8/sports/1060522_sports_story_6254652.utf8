 HIGHS amp; LOWS: GAME II

India suffered a one-run defeat 

 in the second ODI against the West Indies in Kingston on 

 Saturday. Following are the statistical highlights:

 The last time India lost an ODI batting second was against 

 New Zealand in Bulawayo on August 26, 2005, when they 

 were bowled out for 164 (chasing 215). Since then, India 

 won a record 17 matches in a row while batting second 

 before losing on Saturday

 The last time India lost an ODI chasing a total below 

 200 was against Pakistan in Amstelveen on August 21, 2004, 

 when they were bowled out for 127 (chasing 193 in 33 overs)

 This was Indias third one-run defeat in ODIs. 

 Both previous occasions were against Australia ? in Chennai 

 during the 1987 World Cup and in Brisbane in 1992

 This was the West Indies second one-run victory 

 in ODIs, having earlier pipped Australia in Sydney in 

 1988

 Ramnaresh Sarwan (98*), who had also made an unbeaten 

 99 against India in Ahmedabad in 2002, became only the 

 fourth batsman to record scores of 99 and 98 in an ODI 

 career. The others are Aussies Dean Jones, Adam Gilchrist 

 and Matthew Hayden. Sanath Jayasuriya has the unique distinction 

 of being dismissed for 99 twice

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni became the fourth Indian wicketkeeper 

 to effect 50 dismissals (in his 44th ODI) when he caught 

 Chris Gayle on Saturday. The others to have achieved this 

 feat are Nayan Mongia (154 dismissals in 139 matches), 

 Kiran More (90 in 94) and Rahul Dravid (85 in 74).

 Yuvraj Singh (93) has taken his tally to 717 runs in 

 15 ODIs this calendar year. Only Kumar Sangakkara (820 

 runs in 20 matches) has made more runs than Yuvraj in 

 2006

 This was the West Indies seventh win in their 

 last nine matches, while for India it was only their third 

 loss in the last 14 ODIs

 Vermeulen banned

London: Former Zimbabwean Test cricketer Mark Vermeulen has been banned from English first-class and league cricket for 10 years after an on-pitch scuffle in the Central Lancashire League (CLL). 

The incident took place on Sunday when Vermeulen, who was playing as a professional for Werneth against Ashton, confronted opposition fans. He was restrained by club officials before his captain Darren Shadford, ordered him off the field. Shadford then conceded the match. (PTI)

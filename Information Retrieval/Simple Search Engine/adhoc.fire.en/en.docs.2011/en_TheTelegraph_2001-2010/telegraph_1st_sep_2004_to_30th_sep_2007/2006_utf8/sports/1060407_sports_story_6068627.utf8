The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Australia, NZ rope in PMs

 - 2011 World Cup Excellent submission by Asias rivals 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Australia PM John Howard 

 Kochi: The International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) has completed its evaluation 

 of Australia and New Zealands joint submission to 

 host the 2011 World Cup. According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, theyve done an excellent job. The four Asian Test-playing nations ? India, Pakistan, 

 Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? are also in contention and must 

 meet the requirements afresh by April 21. Their joint submission 

 last month was, to quote sources, messy and 

 the deadline extended as a one-off. 

The evaluation is step No. 2. Incidentally, theres no financial bidding. 

Apparently, the extension was given only after the ICC got the Board of Control for Cricket in India to agree on participating in the Twenty20 World Cups second edition, in 2009. Participation in the inaugural meet, next year, wont be mandatory for those Test-playing nations which dont conduct Twenty20 tournaments. 

Significantly, covering letters from Australian Prime Minister John Howard and New Zealands Helen Clark feature in the joint submission by the countries, which together hosted the 1992 World Cup. Asias first submission didnt have a covering letter from any head of government. 

One learns even Englands submission for the 2015 edition has been accompanied by a covering letter (addressed to outgoing ICC president Ehsan Mani) from Prime Minister Tony Blair. 

Nothing can be said for certain, at this stage, but it seems Australia and New Zealand may back off if assured of hosting the 2015 World Cup. But, then, England wont withdraw unless the ICC gives an undertaking that it will host the one in 2019. 

Of course, for that chain to be set in motion, Asias submission has to pass muster. The World Cup has already come to the continent twice ? in 1987 (jointly hosted by India, Pakistan) and in 1996 (co-hosted by India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka). 

 Mani is in town, but declined to talk about the submissions. 

 Were meeting (in Dubai) at the end of the month... 

 Please appreciate that I cant comment till weve 

 taken a decision, he said on Thursday afternoon.

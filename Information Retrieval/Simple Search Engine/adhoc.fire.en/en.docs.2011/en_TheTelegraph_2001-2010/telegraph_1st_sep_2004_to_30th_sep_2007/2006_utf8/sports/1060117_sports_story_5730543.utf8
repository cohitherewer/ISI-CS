 Gilchrist reported for dissent

Brisbane: Australias summer of discontent with arch-rivals South Africa continued on Monday when yet another of their players was cited for dissent. 

Hard on the heels of misconduct charges against pacemen Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath, wicketkeeper and batsman Adam Gilchrist is now in trouble with officialdom. 

The normally mild-mannered Gilchrist has been charged by International Cricket Council (ICC) field umpires Aleem Dar and Simon Taufel and third umpire Daryl Harper for a level-one offence: showing dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse. 

It follows an alleged outburst by the Australian during the 26th over of the tri-series one-day match against South Africa at the Brisbane on Sunday. Gilchrist appeared to have an exchange with Dar after he refused an appeal to refer an attempted run-out against Boeta Dippenaar to the third umpire. 

The latest move follows a fiery summer between Australia and South Africa with verbal jibes dominating headlines throughout their three-test series.

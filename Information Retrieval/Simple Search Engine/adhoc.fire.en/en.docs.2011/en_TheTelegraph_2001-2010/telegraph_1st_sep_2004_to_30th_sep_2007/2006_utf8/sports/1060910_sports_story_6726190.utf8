 Kapur up to 5th spot

Singapore: Shiv Kapur showed patience and poise on a tough day to ensure that he stayed in the hunt for the $ 3m Barclays Singapore Open with a one-over 73 that saw him in fifth place after third round. 

But the young Indian, the Asian Tours Rookie of the Year in 2005, has a tough task on hand, as he is six shots behind leaders defending champion Adam Scott and Ernie Els, the world No. 6 and 7, respectively. 

Kapur was two-under for the tournament, while Els (69), who battled a bothersome stomach, shared the lead with Adam Scott, who shot a bogey-free five-under on a day when there were just a handful of under-par scores, many of which came before the delay. 

Overall, despite the conditions taking a toll, Indians did well to move up the leaderboard and all six of them who made the cut were in the top-25. 

Jyoti Randhwa (72) was tied eighth, Arjun Singh (75) and S.S.P. Chowrasia (73) were tied 19th and Jeev Milkha Singh (70) and Gaurav Ghei (72) were tied 25th. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, who managed to make the weekend after some anxiety, had the only sub-par round among Indians at one-under 70 and was four-over 217 with Gaurav Ghei (73) in tied 25th spot. (PTI)

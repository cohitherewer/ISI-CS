Doha: India remained gold-less after five days of track and field events at the Asian Games. On Monday, the Indians had two bronze medals to show for their efforts at the Khalifa Stadium courtesy long-distance runner .P. Jaisha and discus thrower Krishna Punia. 

Indias poor performance even prompted sprint queen P.T. Usha to express disappointment. 

There cannot be anything more painful than India not having been able to win a gold yet, she said. There was a time when the entire continent used to respect India for its quality of athletes, especially in the sprints. I dont really know what is going wrong with Indian athletics. 

After Anju Bobby Georges mediocre performance in long jump on Sunday, one expected her to do better in triple jump. But on Monday morning, she pulled out of the meet citing health trouble. 

 Anju is indisposed she has been down with fever from Sunday, said an AFI official. Surprisingly, Anju herself had said on Sunday that she was interested in taking part in triple jump. 

 It was left to Jaisha, the girl 

 from Calicut, to fetch Indias first medal of the day 

 in womens 5,000m. She ran a splendid race to clock 

 a personal best time of 15:41.91 and finish behind her Chinese 

 and Japanese rivals. 

The medal came as a pleasant surprise for Jaisha. After all, this is not my favourite event. I fully concentrated on 1,500m for the whole season. 

Jaisha was shifted to 5,000m only after failing to live up to expectations in 1,500m in the Chennai meet. I cried all day and even called up home to tell my parents that God had deserted me. Now, see how he has rewarded me for my efforts, Jaisha said. 

 Jaisha doesnt come from an affluent family and was forced to take up a job after her father met with an accident sometime ago. An Indian Railways employee, Jaisha now aims to do well in the Olympics. 

Punia, the other medal-winner, also recorded a personal best of 61.53 metres womens discus. That came on her second attempt. Her last three throws didnt count. 

The rest of the athletes simply disappointed. While P.J. Vinod finished fifth in decathlon, Vikas Gowda and Navpreet Singh were fourth and seventh, respectively, in mens shot put. 

Indias only gold medal hope in athletics now is the 4x400m relay for women, on Tuesday. The mens relay team also has a good chance of getting a medal.

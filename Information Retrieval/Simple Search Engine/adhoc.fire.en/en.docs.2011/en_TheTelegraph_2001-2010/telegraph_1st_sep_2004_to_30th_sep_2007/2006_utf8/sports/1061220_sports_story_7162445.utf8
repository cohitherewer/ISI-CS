 145 .. by Pujara 

Rajkot: Middleorder batsman Cheteshwar Pujara cracked an unbeaten 145 to help Saurashtra reach 325 for four on the penultimate day of their four-day Ranji Trophy Super League match against Tamil Nadu here on Tuesday. 

The visitors, who scored a mammoth 500 for eight in the first innings, grabbed two wickets early this morning before Pujara and Sitanshu Kotak started the rescue work. 

Kanaiya Vaghela was first to be dismissed for 21, while Sagar Jogiyani made 49. 

But experienced Kotak and promising Pujara took up the responsibility and kept rotating the strike. The duo added 216 runs for the third wicket before Kotak 84 (220b, 11x4) was taken behind the wicket off R. Jesuraj. 

Pujara was on 145 (245b, 23x4) with Mehta (3) when stumps were drawn. Saurashtra were trailing by 175 runs and still needed another 25 to avoid a follow on.

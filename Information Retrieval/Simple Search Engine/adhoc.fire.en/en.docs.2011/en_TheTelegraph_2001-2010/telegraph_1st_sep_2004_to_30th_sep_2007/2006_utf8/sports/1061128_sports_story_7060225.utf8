New Delhi: On record, it was the goal by Nigerian striker Ranty Martins in the 74th minute that made all the difference between the victors and the vanquished. In reality, it was the sheer class of Dempo Sports Club of Goa that forced JCT Mills, Phagwara, to bite the dust in the final of the 119th edition of the Durand Cup at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Monday. 

In the end, Dempo won 1-0, but wasted a chance to win the final by a much more comfortable margin. So overwhelming was their domination in the match that the Punjab team were left to play the second fiddle for most part of the encounter. 

As expected, Dempos two foreign recruits Ranty and Brazilian striker Beto played crucial roles behind the Goan teams win. They controlled the midfield, initiated attacks and even came down to help out the defenders during the closing stages. The combination of the two also brought the only goal of the match, which had the JCT goalkeeper Kalyan Chowbey completely beaten. 

JCT never looked the team that had beaten East Bengal 4-0 only a few days ago. The sudden loss of form by their two Nigerian imports Sunday Ambrose and Adebayo broke the backbone of the Punjab side. It made Edeh Chidi a loner in the upfront and he could hardly pose any problem for the Dempo defenders. 

Yet, it was JCT, who could have gone up in the opening minutes. Striker Praveen Kumar, a former India player, had an open goal in front, but shot out with custodian Satish Kumar beaten and lying on the ground. 

Thereafter, Dempo took over. Both Beto and Ranty were so crafty that even the absence of Clifford Miranda was never felt. Mirandas replacement, Isfaq Ahmed, made quite a few probing runs into the JCT box after being put through by Ranty. A shaken JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh hurriedly threw in Sukhjinder Singh in place of Ambrose. 

The JCT goal had miraculous saves on at least three occasions before luck deserted them in the 74th minute. Beto snatched the ball from Praveen and moved ahead for around 20 yards before passing the ball for Ranty. The Nigerian slammed it with a low right footer that beat Chowbey on the near post. It was a brilliant effort by any standard. 

JCT did not throw in the towel and made a last-ditch effort to restore parity. They did camp in the Dempo area after the goal, but their urgency did not have the required sharpness to find the equaliser. 

To say that Beto was the moving force behind Dempos maiden triumph in the Durand Cup wont be an exaggeration. It came as a surprise for everyone around to find that Durand Cup committee has chosen Sporting Clube de Goas Dudu Omagbemi as the best player of the tournament. It was simply not a commendable choice.

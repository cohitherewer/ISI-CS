 Flintoff serves a warning 

 - Symonds shines in practice match 

 Flintoff in Jaipur on Thursday 

Jaipur: Andrew Flintoff served a warning to Team India ahead of the Champions Trophy match on Sunday with a dazzling half-century that shaped Englands comprehensive 144-run win against a RCA XI in a practice match on Thursday. 

Flintoff, returning to action after a three-month injury lay-off, struck nine fours and a six in a 64-ball 59 that set the foundation for Englands 295 for eight at the K.L. Saini Stadium. In reply, the local outfit was bowled out for 151 in 36.2 overs. 

Sajid Mahmood picked three for 22 and James Anderson two for 29 while off-spinner James Dalrymple grabbed two for 29. 

We obviously wanted to win it. We had a bit of bat and bowl. A few overs under the belt and time out in the middle, Flintoff, back as captain, said. 

Flintoff, however, is unsure whether he will be able to bowl in the Champions Trophy as he continues to make his comeback following ankle surgery. 

Im not certain Ill bowl in the Champions Trophy, though Im feeling stronger in the nets, Flintoff told reporters on Thursday. 

In Mumbai, Australia scored an emphatic 103-run victory over Maharashtra in their first practice game, ahead of their Champions Trophy opener on Wednesday. 

The world champions piled on an imposing 297 for 7 in 50 overs. Andrew Symonds played a whirlwind knock of 78 in 59 balls, whacking seven sixes out of the dozen smacked by his team, including three in one over from Sairaj Bahutule. 

In reply, Maharashtra were bundled out for 194.

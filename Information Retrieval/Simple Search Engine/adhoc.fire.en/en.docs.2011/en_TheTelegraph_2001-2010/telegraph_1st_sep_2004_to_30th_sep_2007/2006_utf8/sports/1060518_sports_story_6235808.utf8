 Fletcher hopes Lords misses thing of past

London: England coach Duncan Fletcher has said he hopes the poor fielding his side displayed to allow Sri Lanka stage one of the great escapes of Test history will not be repeated. 

Sri Lanka survived for 199 overs of the Lords Test to salvage an unexpected draw, and their rearguard action was aided by England dropping nine catches, including misses by reliable fielders like captain Andrew Flintoff, Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood. 

Their under-par display, in stark contrast to some of their fielding and catching during last summers Ashes series and the winter tours to Pakistan and India, could be interpreted as a worrying sign. 

But Fletcher was philosophical: Its pretty frustrating we couldnt finish them off ? you have to say we didnt win it because we dropped too many catches and if we held those catches it would probably have been a totally different story. 

You can probably afford to drop one or two catches, but we got on a run with it and that cost us the Test. It was very disappointing. (AFP)

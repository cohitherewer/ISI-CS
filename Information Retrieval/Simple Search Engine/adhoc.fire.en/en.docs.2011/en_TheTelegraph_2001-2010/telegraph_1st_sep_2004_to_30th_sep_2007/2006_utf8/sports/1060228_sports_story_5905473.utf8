 No cohesion in Indian ranks

 - Tie vs Yemen Coach, players poles apart 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhaichung and his men are not happy with Nayeems ways 

New Delhi: With less than 48 hours to go before India take on Yemen in the Asian Cup qualifier at the Ambedkar Stadium here, the home team looks anything but a cohesive unit. While there are clear indications that players are not too happy with the ways of chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin, the relationship between the team management and the federation also seems strained 

The heavy defeat against Japan has certainly opened the Pandoras box. 

Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia made no secret of his displeasure when he said we had no planning against Japan. Some of his teammates have also been critical of Nayeem, though none of them wants to be quoted. 

The footballers are also upset with the coach for having the kick-off time at 2.30 pm on Wednesday. The players and federation officials requested Nayeem to have the match from 3.30 pm as 2.30 pm would be disadvantageous for our footballers against a team coming from a hot country. The coach didnt listen to anyone, said a senior footballer. 

Now he (Nayeem) wants to change the time to 3.30 pm, but the AFC is in no mood to listen. 

On Monday, Nayeemuddin excluded injured footballers like Venkatesh, Suresh, K. Ajayan, Mahesh Gawli from the squad along with Rajat Ghosh Dastidar and Surojit Bose. Why this mockery, asked a footballer. No one knew it better than him that they would not be in a position to play. Still he forced them to come all the way to Delhi. 

Footballers are not the only one who are critical of Nayeem on this issue. An AIFF official felt the coach had wasted money by calling extra players who had no chance of getting into the team. He was well aware that Venkatesh and Suresh were carrying injuries. Still, he forced the AIFF to spend to and fro air fare for them. 

Nayeemuddin, however, is unperturbed. To achieve anything, one has to work hard. When the countrys prestige is at stake, I dont compromise with anything, was his reply. Very typical of the man when faced with any criticism. 

Meanwhile, a 35-member Yemen squad (25 footballers and 10 officials) arrived in the capital on Sunday night and had its first practice session Monday evening. 

Yemen, ranked No. 135 in the world, was recently suspended by Fifa for internal problems. According to one Yemen official, Fifa has given the national federation provisional affiliation till March 20.

 Rejuvenated Bengal ready for Haryana

 - SANTOSH TROPHY 

 - First match is the most important one: Prasanta

 Nabi is set to pair up with Dipendu upfront 

Gurgaon: With three more national team stars drafted back into the squad, a rejuvenated Bengal are now determined to make a serious attempt to regain the Santosh Trophy after six years when they start their campaign against hosts Haryana at the floodlit Devi Lal Sports Complex on Saturday. 

Though put in an unusually strong group, Bengal, for the first time in the new millennium, have been able to field a side that is quite capable of winning the national championship that has eluded them since 1999. 

While captain and goalkeeper Sandip Nandy is enjoying a great season with the Indian team, the inclusion of Habibur Rehman Mondal, Syed Rahim Nabi and Sanjeev Maria has added to the strength of the team. 

Bubbling with enthusiasm, Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee is planning to use Habibur Rehman as a blocker in the middle with Nabi pairing up with Dipendu Biswas up front. 

The first match against hosts Haryana will be the most important as I would like to get three points, Banerjee said. The next two against Goa and Punjab will be very tough. 

The coach is right as both Goa and Punjab have brought near-best sides. 

Led by Sameeer Naik, defending champions Goa have big names such as Nicholas Rodrigues, Vincent Pires, Covan Lawrence, Clifford Miranda and Luis Barreto and will go all out to take the trophy back to Panjim. Equally strong are Punjab, who have 16 players from JCT. 

To say Bengal are favourites ahead of Goa, Maharashtra and Kerala, will be an over-statement. Yet, the mixture of youth and experience in the side give Bengal fans a lot to cheer about. 

After settling themselves in a decent hotel here, Bengal are now faced with a problem of jersey numbers for the six new players, who didnt feature in the preliminaries. 

Since the management failed to grasp the simple fact that the new lot cannot be allotted the jersey numbers of the six who have been excluded, the Bengal manager, Bachchu Gupta, is now having a tough time in arranging for a fresh set for the footballers. 

In Indian football, every tournament has organisational skeletons hidden neatly inside the cupboard. And they spill out once the meet progresses. 

Here, the main focus will be on the newly-installed floodlights that were tested only 48 hours before the start of the tournament. The Haryana Football Association, however, has given its assurance that the lights, the pitch and the dressing rooms are of international standards. 

With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) offering a meagre daily allowance for the footballers, teams are having a tough time in finding their own accommodation in this expensive satellite township of Delhi. 

While Bengal and Goa did manage to get hotels in decent rates, Maharashtra, who, too, have quite a few stars in the side, was seen running from pillar to post to book a hotel. 

Bengal XI (likely): Sandip Nandy; Bijoy Basfore, Shyam Mondal, Sanjeev Maria and Saumik Dey; Snehasish Chakrabarty, Suman Dutta, Habibur Rehman Mondal and Gouranga Dutta; Dipendu Biswas and Syed Rahim Nabi. 

Saturdays fixtures: Bengal vs Haryana (4.45 pm); Goa vs Punjab (7pm).

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutias brilliance combined with Guy Ndem Herves accuracy saw East Bengal prevailing over Mohammedan Sporting 2-0 in their Round X clash of the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday. 

East Bengal shot into the lead in as early as the second minute via Ndems free-kick from the left, which dropped short of Mohammedan Sporting goalkeeper Gopal Das, who misjudged the uneven bounce and watched to his horror the ball rushing into the net. 

Bhaichung then set the stage ablaze in his typical fashion. In the 51st minute, the East Bengal captain, after getting a through pass from Sasthi Duley, made a solo run into the Mohammedan Sportings citadel and his stinging shot was brilliantly saved by an acrobatic Das. 

Three minutes later, Bhaichung was fouled by Mir Farooq Hyder just outside the box, which also resulted in the latter getting a yellow card. Bhaichung took the free-kick and his shot got deflected off Mohammed Mukhtars body and went in, leaving the goalkeeper speechless. 

With this win, East Bengal provisionally emerged the leaders with 21 points from 10 matches, replacing Mahindra United. Mohammedan Sporting remained with 14 points from 11 matches. 

Following Cameroons Ndem first blood, East Bengal looked to be in for a goal rush. In the 17th minute, it was Ndem again who made a solo run after getting a square pass from Sasthi, moved into the rival box, but unfortunately his powerful right-footer missed the upright by a whisker. 

Mohammedan Sporting upfront with captain Patrick Okonji, however, made heavy weather of a few chances. In the 26th minute, Patrick gave a square pass to Mukhtar who relayed it to Suman Dutta. The latter slipped and messed up the chance. 

Bhaichung started the proceedings with Gouranga Dutta but the latter failed to compliment the Indian captain. Jayanta Sen, operating from the left flank, also failed to deliver. 

The only help that Bhaihung got was from Sasthi, who operated from the right flank and Ndem in the midfield. The Cameroonian impressed the red-and-gold fans with impressive moves and was adjudged as the Man of the Match. 

After the change of sides, the black-and-white brigade got few chances but failed to score. Eleven minutes into the second half, Mohammedan Sporting got the most clear chance, but midfielder Satyajit Bose failed to find target. 

After receiving a head from Patrick, who collided with East Bengal goalkeeper Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, Bose had the open net in front of him but his right footer went way past the right bar. Sensing urgency, Mohammed Habib threw Bijen Singh upfront as a replacement of Satyajit but the goal eluded him.

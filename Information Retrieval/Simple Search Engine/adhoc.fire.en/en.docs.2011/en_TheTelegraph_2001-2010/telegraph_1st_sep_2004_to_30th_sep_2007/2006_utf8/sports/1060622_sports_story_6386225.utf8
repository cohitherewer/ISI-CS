 Quick Takes

 4 arrested for giving Hitler salutes

 Munich: Munich police 

 said Wednesday they had arrested four drunken fans, including 

 one Greek, for celebrating Germanys 3-0 World Cup 

 win over Ecuador with the Sieg Heil Hitler salute.

 Fellow fans alerted police when 

 the men, aged 20 to 28, began shouting the salute as celebrations 

 broke out after they had watched the match in a bar Tuesday.

 The four have since been released, 

 but could face charges for breaking the law by openly supporting 

 a banned organisation. German law prohibits the display 

 of Nazi symbols or the use of Nazi salutes.

 Smicer, the good luck charm

 Munich: Vladimir Smicer 

 finally made the World Cup, at least as a visitor. The 33-year-old, 

 who has scored 27 goals in 81 matches for the Czech Republic, 

 was dropped from the Czech roster on June 1 when it became 

 clear he wouldnt recover in time from a hamstring 

 injury. On Monday night, he joined the rest of the team 

 in a hotel near Westerburg and attended the teams 

 training session next day.

 He is considered to be the one 

 who brings luck for any team he plays. Is he lucky? I 

 hope so, smiling Smicer said. Though I wouldnt 

 rely only on that.

 Bottoms up

 Cologne: Among the provisions 

 made to accommodate the anticipated 35,000 English fans 

 who turned up in Cologne without a ticket was some 175,000 

 litres of beer. We reckoned that the average England 

 fan would consume at least five litres each during the course 

 of the day, a city spokesman said.

 Judging from the general ambience 

 eight hours before kick-off, some had reached that figure 

 considerably earlier. 

 Watch your back

 Munich: Munich police said 

 on Tuesday that they had arrested 19 members of five different 

 international rings of pickpockets, who had converged on 

 the city for the World Cup.

 Police said since the beginning 

 of the tournament they have seen a 100 per cent increase 

 in pick-pocketing and purse snatchings, with 164 reported 

 incidents. Only 22 cases have been solved, they said.

 The arrests on Tuesday came with 

 help from Zurich and Vienna police, Munich authorities said.

 Cambodia PM tips Germany

 Phnom Penh: Cambodias 

 soccer-loving Prime Minister Hun Sen has tipped Germany 

 to win the World Cup. Congratulations Germany!, 

 Hun Sen, speaking in English, told bemused foreign diplomats 

 and businessmen attending an investment seminar in the capital 

 Phnom Penh on Wednesday.

 I bless Germany to win the 

 World Cup, he told the group which included ambassadors 

 from Cup contenders Germany, England, Japan, South Korea, 

 France and Australia.

 Kids Germany-bound

 London: Some 350 British 

 schoolchildren whose dreams of seeing a World Cup game were 

 shattered by an alleged ticket scam will now get to see 

 a match, the government said on Wednesday.

 They will now be going as a result 

 of what PM Tony Blairs spokesman said had been an 

 incredible effort by the Department for Culture, 

 Media and Sport. Sports minister Richard Caborn spoke personally 

 to Fifa president Sepp Blatter and the world body has agreed 

 to supply tickets to a variety of games.

 Ecuador feat

 Bad Kissingen: Ecuador 

 coach Luis Fernando Suarez has achieved one of his ambitions 

 by showing the world another side to South American soccer. 

 Historically, when people talk about South American 

 soccer they always talk about Argentina or Brazil but now 

 the world and the press are also talking about Ecuador, 

 he said on Wednesday. It is something that makes me 

 very happy.

 Too tired to beg

 Bangkok: Buddhist monks 

 in Thailand are too tired to receive early morning alms 

 because they are staying up late to watch the World Cup, 

 a Thai newspaper reported on Wednesday.

 The paper quoted a woman in the 

 northern city of Chiang Mai who said her birthday celebrations 

 were ruined because monks at a city temple were not awake 

 to receive her morning offering, a mandatory religious ritual 

 in the predominately Buddhist country.

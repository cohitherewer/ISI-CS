Calcutta: A below-par round of 76 by Sudeep Chitlangia of Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd left the door open for an unprecedented seventh straight title for McLeod Russel India Ltd A in The Telegraph Merchants Cup golf tournament at RCGC on Thursday. 

At the end of Day III, Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd are on 226 and McLeod Russel India Ltd A on 233, but still with the luxury of discarding their third card. Leading the latters challenge on Friday will be Aditya Khaitan. 

Oil India fell out of the title race due to a tactical error in choosing a weaker team based on their zonal offices. Ranjit Singh, who had a brilliant round of 66 on Wednesday, didnt get the support of his teammates who played worse than the B team. Their best on Thursday was 79 by D. Thakuria. Vandana Agarwal will feature on the final day, but they only have a chance of winning the Division I prize now. 

In Division II, McLeod Russel India Ltd E have a three-stroke lead. In second place is McLeod Russel India Ltd D. 

Oil India B will be hoping Madhya Bharat Papers Ltd win the main Cup as they will then have the chance to emerge Division III champions. 

The Challenge Cup saw some big changes with Timir Roy of Anand Associates returning a well compiled 71.4 nett and ensuring pole position with a three-day total of 217.4 nett. They are followed by Euro Design Home World (218.4) and Orson Holdings Company Ltd (219.4). Overnight leaders Flex Alloys Pvt Ltd are at 220.2. In this event, too, the worst card can be discarded. 

The days best scores were won by Rajeev Takru of McLeod Russel India Ltd A, with a 66 nett in Division I. His colleague in Division II, Anand Wats of McLeod Russel India H, with a 58 nett and S.S. Katware of Chittaranjan Locomotive Works in Division III with 62 nett were the other winners. Shyamal Mullick of Flenders Ltd was the best in the Challenge Cup with a nett score of 70.2. 

The closest to the pin and best overall so far has been by Gaurav Ghosh of J. Thomas amp; Co Pvt Ltd and he is in line to win the Cleveland Wedge. The longest drive was struck by Ravi Bhushan of Tata Steel. 

An exciting putting competition was held at the Bridgette Jones Fashion Salon. Mrs Geeta Singh emerged winner and Mrs Neena Singh the runner-up.

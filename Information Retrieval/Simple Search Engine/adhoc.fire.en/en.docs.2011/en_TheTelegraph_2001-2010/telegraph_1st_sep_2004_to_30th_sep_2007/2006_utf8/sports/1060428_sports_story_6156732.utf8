 Quick Takes

 Matthaeus praise for Robinson

 London: Paul Robinsons 

 emergence as a top-class goalkeeper has transformed England 

 into potential World Cup winners, according to former Germany 

 captain Lothar Matthaeus. The former World Cup winner believes 

 the Tottenham keeper is the missing link in Sven-Goran 

 Erikssons side. 

 I believe a big factor is 

 that, after five or six years, England now has a good goalkeeper 

 in Paul Robinson. He can make the difference between this 

 World Cup and the last two big tournaments. You can have 

 a good team but you will struggle to get to the final if 

 you do not have a good keeper, he said.

 Brazil-Norway friendly

 Oslo: World champions Brazil 

 will play Norway in a soccer friendly in Oslo in August, 

 hoping to make it fourth time lucky against a team they 

 have never beaten. Its hard to imagine a better 

 opponent in a friendly than Brazil, Norway coach Aage 

 Hareide said of the game at Ullevaal Stadium on August 16.

 One of the few nations never beaten 

 by Brazil, Norway defeated the South Americans 2-1 in a 

 first-round upset at the 1998 World Cup in France. Norway 

 also won 4-2 over Brazil in a friendly in Oslo in 1997 and 

 the two drew their only other game, 1-1, in 1988.

 Messi problem

 Buenos Aires: Barcelona 

 forward Lionel Messi, still recovering from an injury to 

 his right thigh, pulled up during a training session in 

 his native Argentina on Wednesday, media reports said.

 Messi pulled up during a sprint 

 and kicked a cone in frustration but Argentina national 

 team sources said it was not serious, they said. It was 

 not immediately clear whether the problem was with the same 

 leg or the same injury.

 The 18-year-old has been out of 

 action since early March. He has been one of Barcelonas 

 most exciting players this season and is expected to stand 

 out for Argentina at the World Cup.

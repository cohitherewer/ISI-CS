 Hopefully, well win next four: Alonso

Magny-Cours: Fernando Alonso had a unique way of coming back when Michael Schumacher won two races in a row ? he won the next four. 

The defending world champion would get another chance for an encore after Schumacher took the French Grand Prix on Sunday to win consecutive races. 

Schumacher won the French Grand Prix for a record eighth time, finishing 10 seconds ahead of Alonso. Felipe Massa, Schumachers Ferrari teammate, came third. The victory helped the seven-time champion close the gap on Alonso in the standings with seven races left. Alonso has 96 points ? 17 ahead of Schumacher. 

We have clearly made up ground and we have to keep on working at that pace and for sure everybody will just keep pushing for the last seven races, Schumacher said. Its far from being over. 

After early season struggles, the talismanic Schumacher won the San Marino GP and the European GP. However, Alonso ? who took the title away from the German in 2005 ? then won at Spain, Monaco, Britain and Canada. 

Everybody thought that they would win all the races and then we won four consecutive races and hopefully this will happen again from the next race on, said Alonso. 

With Schumachers victories at the US GP and now in France, Alonso is looking forward to the German GP on July 30. Indianapolis was a strange race, the Spanish world champion said, recalling the problem with Michelin tyres last year, which forced his team and six others to pull out. From the tyres and the difficulties we had last year. Maybe we were too conservative or whatever. I think here we were close, but not quick enough. 

Schumacher agreed. Indianapolis was not really the reference in a way. We were too dominant, he said. 

Alonso knew he didnt have too much of a chance in France, either, as the Ferraris were quicker. We were two-or three-tenths down compared to Michael, Alonso said. Given where I started on the grid, I think second is everything I could have hoped for because we knew that Michael was a bit quicker this weekend.

 Crown for Chandra

Chennai: Manan Chandra of Bharat Petroleum Corporation won his maiden senior snooker crown when he overwhelmed highly-rated Pankaj Advani 6-4 in the 72nd BSNL national billiards and snooker championship, which ended here on Wednesday. 

Advani was totally off colour against a rampaging Delhi cueist, who won at 0-97, 77-37, 57-69, 82-30, 78-33, 64-45, 100-1, 0-85, 70-22. 

Advani, a two-time world snooker champion, played below potential and failed to get over a mental block. 

He was diffident in approach and the free flow of follow through was mostly not seen throughout the match.

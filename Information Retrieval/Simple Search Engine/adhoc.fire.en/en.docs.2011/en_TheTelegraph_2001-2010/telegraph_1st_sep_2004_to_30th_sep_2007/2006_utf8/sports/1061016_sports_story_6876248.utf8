 Anna at it again 

 - Russian double in Kremlin Cup 

 Anna Chakvetadze with the trophy on Sunday 

Moscow: Anna Chakvetadze beat fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova 6-4, 6-4 on Sunday to win the Kremlin Cup. 

It was the second straight title for the 19-year-old Russian after her maiden victory at the Guangzhou Open in China two weeks ago. 

In the final of the ATP event later, top seed Nikolay Davydenko beat Davis Cup teammate Marat Safin 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 in the all-Russian Sunday to complete a unique double for the host country. 

Petrova, playing with groin and chest injuries, saved four breakpoints in the seventh game of the first set before dropping her serve. She broke back immediately, but lost her next service game and ultimately the set just the second one she had lost in five matches. 

Chakvetadze continued to control play in the second set and broke twice to lead 4-1. Though Petrova broke back in the sixth game, Chakvetadze improved her record against her opponent to 3-0 this season. 

I was lucky today (Sunday), Chakvetadze said. Petrova wasnt 100 per cent fit today. 

The 24th-ranked Chakvetadze will move into the top 20 for the first time in her career next week. Petrova, who will remain at No.58, said injuries had ruined her chances. 

I had my chest and hips bandaged and it was difficult to serve and move I did all I could, Petrova said. 

The loss was Petrovas first in six finals this season. (AP)

 Rauf in expanded ICC panel

 Elite Umpires

 Dubai: Mark Benson of England, 

 Billy Doctrove of West Indies and Asad Rauf of Pakistan 

 have been added to the elite panel of ICC umpires, increasing 

 the panels strength to ten from seven.

 The appointments follow the annual 

 review of umpires performance at the end of March 

 2006.

 The composition of the panel was 

 determined by ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed and chairman 

 of ICC cricket committee Sunil Gavaskar.

 The criteria for selection was, 

 the percentage of correct decisions given as well as reports 

 from captains and Match Referees.

 Speed congratulated the new members 

 on their achievement and explained that the panel was expanded 

 with the purpose of reducing the workload of the existing 

 panel. Umpiring international cricket matches is one 

 of the toughest jobs in world sport and we felt a seven-man 

 panel was probably a little light. 

 So over the last year we 

 have given extra appointments to umpires from the second-tier 

 international panel who had a good track record in home 

 ODI matches, Speed said in an ICC media release.

 The Elite Panel

 Mark Benson, Billy Bowden, Steve 

 Bucknor, Aleem Dar, Billy Doctrove, Darrell Hair, Daryl 

 Harper, Rudi Koertzen, Asad Rauf, Simon Taufel

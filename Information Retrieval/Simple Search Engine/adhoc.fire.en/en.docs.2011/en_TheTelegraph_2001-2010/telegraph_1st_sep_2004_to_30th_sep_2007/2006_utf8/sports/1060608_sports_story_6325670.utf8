 Spain dreaming of brighter 

 future

It would be fair to say that Spains 

 qualifying campaign for the 2006 World Cup was not their 

 most spectacular. In fact, it was only after an emphatic 

 5-1 win over Slovakia in the first leg of the play-offs 

 that their place in the finals looked secure, and their 

 fans could breath a collective sigh of relief. When Luis 

 Aragones side were drawn in Group VII alongside Serbia 

 and Montenegro, San Marino, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina 

 and Lithuania, few thought they would have much difficulty 

 topping their group. 

 However, no one told that to the 

 Serbo-Montenegrins, who surprised almost everyone by winning 

 the group. Though Spain remained unbeaten, they drew too 

 many games to take top spot, with points dropped in their 

 two draws against Bosnia-Herzegovina and away in Lithuania 

 proving costly. 

 And so the Iberians had to sweat 

 it out a bit longer with a two-legged play-off against the 

 up-and-coming Slovakians, who had finished ahead of Russia 

 in Group III. 

 The Spanish finally did justice 

 to their favourites billing in the first leg, when 

 an inspired Luis Garcia practically destroyed the visitors 

 single-handedly. A 1-1 draw in the return leg four days 

 later merely rubber-stamped Spains passport to the 

 finals. 

 Spain did not taste defeat once 

 during the period between Aragones arrival as national 

 team coach in summer 2004 and the end of last year, posting 

 six wins and six draws in official games. Yet, while they 

 remained unbeaten, they did struggle to finish off opponents, 

 due in no small part to their strikers inability to 

 put away their chances. 

 Germany will be Spains eighth 

 consecutive appearance at the World Cup finals. They last 

 missed out in 1974, when coincidentally the tournament was 

 also held on German soil. However, international honours 

 have so far proved elusive for la selecci?, their one tournament 

 triumph coming more than 40 years ago at the 1964 Uefa European 

 Championship. Their best result at a World Cup was back 

 at Brazil 1950, where they finished fourth. Luck often seems 

 to desert the Spanish, especially at the last-16 stage, 

 where they fell at USA 94 and again at Korea-Japan 2002, 

 the latter time on penalties. 

 The arrival of Aragones brought 

 with it changes in team selection. The veteran coach revitalised 

 his squad by bringing in new blood and wasted no time instilling 

 his own philosophy ? control the ball and you control 

 the game ? in his new players. To realise his goals, 

 the coach handed midfield duties to playmakers Xavi and 

 Xabi Alonso and anchorman David Albelda, who little by little 

 have been forging a better understanding. 

 The last third of the field is 

 the domain of strikers Raul Gonzalez and El Ni? Torres. 

 The pair contributed ten of Spains 25 qualifying goals 

 (play-offs included), both scoring at opportune moments 

 to prove that their undeniable finishing skills can never 

 be discounted. Should either of the two be lacking in inspiration, 

 Aragones knows that he also has potent attacking options 

 in Morientes and Garcia. The young Iker Casillas, already 

 a veteran of many campaigns, remains the undisputed first-choice 

 in goal, and the coach has good options in defence, among 

 them the tireless Michel Salgado on the right, central defenders 

 Carles Puyol and Sergio Ramos and the incisive left-back 

 Asier del Horno. 

 Perhaps the greatest worry for 

 Aragones is his younger players lack of maturity and 

 competitive experience. He knows that this can only be put 

 right over time, although few would argue that their progress 

 to date under Aragones has not been noteworthy. On taking 

 the job, he promised to guide the team to the finals in 

 Germany. No sooner had he achieved this objective than he 

 set himself an even tougher challenge: to lead Spain to 

 a first ever World Cup final. 

 Backing him all the way is his 

 captain Raul, who said: In the nine years that Ive 

 been with the national team, Ive never seen so many 

 quality players. Were going to this World Cup to win 

 it.

 Third time lucky 

 After two near-misses in World 

 Cup qualifying, Ukraine have booked a place in the 2006 

 edition of the tournament in commanding fashion. Coach Oleg 

 Blokhin and his men were the first Europeans after hosts 

 Germany to book a place at the showcase event following 

 a successful qualifying campaign in a difficult group. 

 After the 1991 break-up of the 

 Soviet Union and subsequent founding of the Football Federation 

 of Ukraine, the Ukraine national team first entered a preliminary 

 stage for the World Cup finals in 1996-97 ahead of the 1998 

 finals in France. 

 The eastern Europeans first 

 attempt ended with them placed second in their group behind 

 Germany but above Portugal and Northern Ireland. They subsequently 

 lost to Croatia in the play-offs and failed to make it to 

 France, and there was a repeat performance before Korea-Japan 

 2002 when they went down in the play-offs again, this time 

 to Germany. 

 After failing to qualify for Euro 

 2004, former Soviet international and 1975 European Footballer 

 of the Year Blokhin succeeded Leonid Buryak with the task 

 of leading his country to Germany, which he did with style. 

 The undoubted ace in his pack 

 is undoubtedly Andriy Shevchenko, AC Milans prodigious 

 goal-getter and the East Europeans one truly world-class 

 striker. Ukraines fortunes rise and fall in tandem 

 with the form of the 2004 European Footballer of the Year.

 The Carthage Eagles are waiting 

 for a second win 

 In 1978, Tunisia became the first 

 African country to win a game at the finals of the World 

 Cup when they beat Mexico 3-1 in their very first group 

 match. A 0-1 defeat against Poland in the next match and 

 a goalless draw against defending champions Germany were 

 not good enough to see the North Africans through to the 

 next round, but the victory over Mexico secured the Carthages 

 Eagles a place in the history books. 

 Since then, Tunisia have appeared 

 at two more finals, but they are still awaiting their second 

 victory. In 1998, Tunisia lost to England and Colombia and 

 drew with Romania, while four years later, they lost to 

 Russia and Japan and held Belgium to a draw. 

 As one of the five African countries 

 who played at Korea-Japan in 2002, Tunisia did not have 

 to play in the preliminary African qualifying rounds for 

 the 2006 finals. And under the stewardship of former French 

 national coach Roger Lemerre, they more than lived up to 

 their billing of favourites to reach Germany 2006. 

 They entered the qualifying competition 

 high on confidence having won the CAF African Cup of Nations 

 on home soil in February 2004. In the final, Lemerres 

 men beat Morocco 2-1 to lift the trophy in front of 60,000 

 delirious fans at the Rades Stadium. 

 As fate would have it, they encountered 

 old foes Morocco again in their qualifying group, and once 

 more the Eagles showed that they ruled the regional roost 

 by coming out on top, even if both matches between the North 

 African rivals finished level ? 1-1 in Rabat, then 2-2 in 

 Tunis. 

 Overall, the Tunisians enjoyed 

 a fairly comfortable passage to Germany. Defeated just once, 

 1-2 by Guinea, Lemerres team recorded six wins and 

 three draws. What is more, courtesy their contribution to 

 a scintillating Confederations Cup last year, they showed 

 they will be a force to be reckoned with next summer. 

 With top-class performers such 

 as Ziad Jaziri, Santos, Adel Chedli and captain Hatem Trabelsi 

 within their ranks, the Carthage Eagles have justifiably 

 heightened expectations. Adding to their one win so far 

 at a World Cup looks well within their capability, and the 

 ambitious Tunisians will not want to stop at that.

 Calderon leads Saudis through 

 to fourth finals 

 Saudi Arabia qualified comfortably 

 for their fourth consecutive World Cup finals, going undefeated 

 through 12 qualifiers and beating the 2002 semi-finalists 

 South Korea both home and away. After sailing through the 

 preliminary group stage, winning all six games against Indonesia, 

 Sri Lanka and Turkmenistan, the Saudis knew the serious 

 business would start in the final round and they delivered 

 there too. 

 A goal from veteran striker Sami 

 Al Jaber on his international comeback earned them a 1-1 

 draw in Uzbekistan in their Group A opener in February last 

 year, and the following month they secured a 2-0 victory 

 over Korea Republic in Dammam ? a result which boosted morale 

 after their poor display in the 2004 AFC Asian Cup, which 

 they exited at the group stage. 

 They booked their ticket to Germany 

 on June 8 with a 3-0 home success against Uzbekistan and 

 ended their campaign in style two months later as Mohamed 

 Al Anbars goal secured a 1-0 win in Seoul. 

 Saudi Arabia have been Asian champions 

 three times, in 1984, 1988 and 1996. Those continental crowns 

 encouraged the countrys authorities to introduce full 

 professionalism and this paid off with a first World Cup 

 finals appearance at USA in 1994. 

 The Saudis made a favourable impression 

 on their tournament debut by beating Morocco and Belgium 

 to advance to the second round where they lost to Sweden. 

 After that memorable start, however, their subsequent appearances 

 at France 1998 and Korea-Japan 2002 have yielded one draw 

 and five defeats from six matches. 

 The Saudi Arabia coach is former 

 Argentine international Gabriel Calderon, who replaced Dutchman 

 Gerard van der Lem following their poor showing at the Asian 

 Cup. Calderon, whose first task was to raise morale in the 

 squad, introduced an attacking style that impressed his 

 employers and he can now look forward to becoming the second 

 Argentinian to lead Saudi Arabia into a World Cup finals 

 after Jorge Solari at USA 94. 

 Calderons squad blends youth 

 and experience, notably in the attacking duo of the 34-year-old 

 Al Jaber and Yasser Al Qahtani, a decade younger but already 

 his countrys most expensive player following his $10million 

 transfer to Al Hilal. Calderon recalled Al Jaber more than 

 two years after his last international appearance in the 

 0-8 humbling by Germany in Korea-Japan, and the veteran 

 showed why he is such a revered figure in Saudi football 

 with three goals in the final qualifying round.

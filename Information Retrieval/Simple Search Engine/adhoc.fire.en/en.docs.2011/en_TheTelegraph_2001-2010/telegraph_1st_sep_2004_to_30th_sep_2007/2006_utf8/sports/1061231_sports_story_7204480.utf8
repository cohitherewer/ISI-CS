 Australia upset Russia

Melbourne: Hosts Australia upset top seeds Russia in the opening match of the Hopman Cup in Perth on Saturday, courtesy of singles wins from Alicia Molik and Mark Philippoussis. 

The Australian duo, both looking to return to higher rankings after injury and poor form, enjoyed emphatic wins in the mixed team event with Molik beating world No. 6 Nadia Petrova in three sets and Philippoussis seeing off Dmitry Tursunov in two. 

Tursunov and Petrova restored some Russian pride with a 7-6, 6-1 triumph in the dead doubles rubber to make the final match score 2-1. 

Molik, who rose to a career-high world No. 8 in early 2005 before a debilitating ear infection saw her slip to a 2006 year-end ranking of 163, gave the hosts the perfect launch pad with a 6-2, 2-6, 6-2 win over Petrova. 

The 25-year-old, who came through the playoffs last week to earn a wildcard to the Australian Open, surged to a 3-0 lead in the first set before the Russian levelled the breaks at 3-2. 

But another break, courtesy of a line call referred to Hawkeye, helped Molik seal the set 6-2. She then went 2-0 up in the second before Petrova reeled off six games in a row to level the match. 

Molik crucially broke in the sixth game of the decider to shatter the Russians resistance and she completed victory 6-2. In a sense I am restarting my career and I do feel like this is the start of something, Molik said. 

I am a harsh critic, so I probably got a little angry and upset with myself in the second set, but I am pretty proud of the way I cam back in the third set. 

Philippoussis, the world No. 114, is hoping a good run of form will earn him a wildcard for Melbourne Park and he made light of the 92 places between himself and Tursunov in the rankings with a polished 6-4, 7-6 victory to render the doubles contest dead.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni has a small score to settle with Best

 - After another trim, more responsibility for the Jharkhand superstar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni

Kingston: Its to be seen whether 

 Tino Best is fielded against India, but if he is, then Mahendra 

 Singh Dhoni will be look-ing to get runs off the quick.

 The last time we played 

 each other (in Colombo, last August), I swept him for two 

 fours.... That annoyed Best and he challenged me to do the 

 same in the West Indies... Im here and, now, lets 

 see when the opportunity arises, Dhoni told The 

 Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Hilton on Sunday evening, he added: In a way, thats a small personal score to be settled... That apart, I havent come with a target... From the batting point of view, I cant even set one as Im probably going to bat in different positions in the ODIs... I havent thought about the Test series... 

With 1,092 runs from 29 innings, Dhoni headed the ODI averages (60.67) for India in 2005-06. For a while he even topped the ICC rankings. A new season, though, is about to begin and there are fresh challenges. 

Its not that Dhoni, who has had another trim to counter the heat, isnt aware. 

As Ive said in the past, I dont have extra pressure... Rather, its more responsibility, particularly when only five specialist batsmen get picked... Adapting quickly and reading situations well is the key to success, he remarked. 

Earlier, interacting with the media at Chedwin Park, Dhoni pointed out that the slowness of the wicket was a pointer to what lies ahead. Slow and low... Weve got to prepare for such wickets... Were coming off having played very good cricket and the challenge will be to keep that going... 

When someone asked whether the quicks pace could be a bother (not that anybody is in the Andy Roberts or Malcolm Marshall league), Dhoni replied: But weve been handling pace well... Even Andrew Flintoff would hit the 90 mph mark... One can, of course, improve in every aspect. 

He agreed that the weather would place heavy demands on the dual responsibility. 

Dhoni has been somewhat bowled over by the Jamaicans jolly nature, but hes amused that just about everybody has one thing to say ? Wont be easy to beat the West Indies... Weve got Lara... Weve got Lara... 

 Zimbabwe may not be a formidable opposition, but the 

 West Indies 5-0 success (two ODIs got abandoned) has 

 raised Brian Charles Laras stock even higher. The 

 start to his latest (and, surely, last) innings as captain 

 couldnt have been better.

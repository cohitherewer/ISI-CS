 Gatlin: Record needs to be evaluated again

 Any person would be upset, says Gatlin 

Durham (North Carolina): Justin Gatlin wants the 100 metres world record to himself. 

The Olympic and world champion also wants the IAAF to take another look at the timing picture of his race in Doha last Friday that was announced as a world-record 9.76 seconds. 

The IAAF said on Wednesday that Gatlins winning time was actually 9.77 seconds, tying but not breaking Asafa Powells world record. 

The governing body said the time was adjusted because officials, after looking at the timing picture, neglected to round up his mark of 9.766 seconds to the next hundredth as required by IAAF rules. 

Any person would be highly upset with the situation, Gatlin said after his workout at North Carolina Central University in Durham. It took five days or more to change it. 

It (the time) needs to be re-evaluated once again because it does not seem to be as a professional situation as it could be, he added. 

This is the world record, Gatlin said. Its not like 9.84 or 9.89 where you can come back and change it. 

Gatlin said he still considered himself the fastest man in the world. My job is to go out there and run fast and threaten world records and thats what I plan on doing, he said. 

This will only motivate me to go out there and run faster. I was very upset this morning but that anger turned to motivation. I want to be the first man to run 9.7 twice.

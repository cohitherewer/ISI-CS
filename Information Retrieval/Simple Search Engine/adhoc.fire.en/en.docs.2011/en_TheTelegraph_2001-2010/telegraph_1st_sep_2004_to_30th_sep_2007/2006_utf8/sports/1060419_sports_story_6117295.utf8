 Shikha to take on Denise in opener

 - India face Philippines today 

 Fed Cup

 Shikha has had some 

 solid practice 

 New Delhi: Sania Mirza 

 and Shikha Uberoi will launch Indias Fed Cup campaign 

 in the Asia-Oceania Zone qualifying tie in Seoul from Wednesday.

 India face Philippines in their 

 opening match and would go on to meet Chinese Taipei on 

 Thursday and New Zealand on Friday in pool B.

 In the opening singles against 

 Philippines, world No.1 164 Shikha Uberoi will take on 16-year-old 

 Denise Dy, ranked 1112.

 Sania, Indias No.1 player 

 with a world ranking of 40, faces the 673rd ranked Czarina-Mae 

 Arevalo in the second singles.

 Coach and captain Enrico Piperno 

 said he chose to play Sania, who is carrying injuries to 

 her wrist and elbow in the serving arm besides an hyperextension 

 of the lower back, to give her some valuable match practice 

 ahead of the crucial encounter against Chinese Taipei.

 Ideally I would have liked 

 not to play Sania against Philippines, but she has not played 

 a match in the last 10 days, Piperno said from Seoul.

 Thursdays tie against 

 Chinese Taipei is the key because they have two top-200 

 players. So I told Sania that it would be better for her 

 to get some match practice. She (Sania) is absolutely 

 fine. She is feeling no pain. Her wrist is a bit sore, but 

 that is not a major concern, Piperno said.

 The Indian team reached Seoul 

 on Monday and had two vigorous practice sessions so far, 

 he said.

 It has been windy and cold 

 out here. Shikha had arrived here five days ago and she 

 has had some solid practice, Piperno said. (PTI)

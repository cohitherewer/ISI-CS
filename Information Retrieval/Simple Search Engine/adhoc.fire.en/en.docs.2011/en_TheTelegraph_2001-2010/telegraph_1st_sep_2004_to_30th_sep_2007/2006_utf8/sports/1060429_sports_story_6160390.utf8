 Sharma upsets Neelotpal

Mumbai: Jharkhand player Umakant Sharma (8.5 points) shocked top seed Neelotpal Das and emerged the sole leader after the tenth and penultimate round of the Thakur International Rating chess tournament here on Friday. 

A draw in the final round on Saturday would be enough for Sharma, with an Elo rating of 1989, to clinch the Thakur Education Group trophy and the top prize of Rs 61,000. 

Neelotpal, with the title of a Grandmaster under his belt, was expected to easily brush aside Sharma who is ranked 106th. He also had the advantage of white pieces in the Spanish opening. 

However, the in-form Sharma easily equalised from the black side and, taking advantage of his rivals desperate attempts, turned the tables on the top seed to win in 60 moves. (PTI)

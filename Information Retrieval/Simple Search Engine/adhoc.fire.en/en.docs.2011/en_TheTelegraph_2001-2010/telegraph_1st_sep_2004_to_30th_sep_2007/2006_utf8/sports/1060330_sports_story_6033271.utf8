The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rajinders days look numbered

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Rajinder Singhs days as national hockey coach seem to be numbered. Unless there is presidential intervention, Rajinder will get the sack before the Indian team starts preparing for the four-nation tournament in Holland, beginning on April 15. 

Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jyothikumaran did not take the coachs name but made it clear while speaking to The Telegraph that poor tactical approach was to blame for Indias debacle at the Melbourne Commonwealth Games. 

On being asked to analyse the teams sixth-place finish, Jyothikumaran said: The first thing that let us down was poor tactics. Our approach was wrong and we did not have the necessary planning to play international matches. 

The IHF brass will meet in Delhi in the first week of April: We will decide on our next course of action at the meeting. We have to do something. It cant go on like this, said Jyothikumaran. If one were to read between the lines, it cannot be good news for Rajinder. 

According to IHF sources, only president K.P.S. Gills intervention can save Rajinder. 

It is common knowledge that the relation between the IHF secretary and coach has reached its lowest ebb, said a national selector. A smear campaign has long been on against Rajinder. But for a reasonable performance in the Pakistan leg of the bilateral series, Rajinder would have been shown the door. 

Rajinder, who returned with the team from Melbourne on Tuesday, said: I have heard that I may be removed? I am meeting Mr Gill in a few days to apprise him of the situation... Lets see what happens. I will talk after that. 

Rajinders departure will mean three coaches have got the boot within a year following German Gerhard Rach and Jagbir Singh.

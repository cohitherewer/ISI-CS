 Were not complacent: Mahela

 - Pollock boost for South Africa in Muralis den

Colombo: Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene has every reason to feel confident ahead of the second Test against South Africa. 

Jayawardene shared a world record partnership with Kumar Sangakkara worth 624 runs that laid the foundation for Sri Lankas innings and 153-run victory in the first Test last week. 

His 374 was the fourth-highest individual innings ever in a Test only 26 behind Brian Laras world record. 

On top of that, Muttiah Muralidharan took his 17th 10-wicket haul in a Test match, returning ten for 172 as the Sri Lankans coasted to victory with more than a session to spare. 

And the second Test starting on Friday will be on the Saravanamuttu Stadium ground where Murali plays his domestic cricket for Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club. It is expected to favor spin bowling even more than the first Test wicket at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

Yet Jayawardene is being cautious, knowing that Shaun Pollocks return to the South African team is a big boost for the injury-plagued tourists. 

True that we won the first Test by such a thumping margin. But we are not going to be complacent. Everyone will have to start from zero, Jayawardene said after practice on Thursday. The wicket will be different and the combination will be different the second Test wont be as easy as the first one. 

Ashwell Prince, filling in as skipper for the Test matches in the injury-enforced absence of Graeme Smith, said his South Africa players believe theyll compete better in the second Test. 

We got better and better as the first Test progressed. The bowlers know what exactly to do and all our batsmen have spent enough time in the wicket ... We are better prepared, he said. 

Pollock is likely to replace Andre Nel, who took one for 114 in the first Test. 

Sri Lanka also will be bolstered in the fast bowling ranks by the return of Chaminda Vaas, who missed the first match with a hamstring problem. 

TEAMS (likely) 

Sri Lanka: Upul Tharanga, Sanath Jayasuriya, Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene (captain), Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chamara Kapugedara, Prasanna Jayawardene, Chaminda Vaas, Dilhara Fernando, Lasith Malinga, Muttiah Muralidharan. 

South Africa: Andrew Hall, Herschelle Gibbs, Hashim Amla, Jacques Rudolph, Ashwell Prince (captain), A. B. de Villiers, Mark Boucher, Shaun Pollock, Nicky Boje, Dale Steyn, Makaya Ntini.

It also said AC Milan will be allowed to stay in the top flight, but will be penalised by a points deduction and booted out of next seasons Champions League. 

The verdict will be this: Juventus, Fiorentina and Lazio will be relegated to Division II, said the paper. 

AC Milan will stay in the first division but will not be allowed to take part in the Champions League. 

The newspaper did not give away its sources, but claimed it also knew what point deductions each team would receive. 

Juventus will be docked 20 points from the start of their Serie B campaign with Fiorentina penalised 10 and Lazio six or seven. 

Milan will lose 10 to 15 points from their Serie A challenge, which would hand a huge advantage in the title race to city rivals Inter and even Roma.

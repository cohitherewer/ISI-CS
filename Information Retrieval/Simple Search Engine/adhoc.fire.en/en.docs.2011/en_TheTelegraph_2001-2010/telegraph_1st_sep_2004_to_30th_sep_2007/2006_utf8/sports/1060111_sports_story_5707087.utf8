 Derby was a Classic treat 

 STAR RACER

 It was a close call for Aristotle in the Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes last Sunday. With trainer Darius Byramjis Arturo pushing Vijay Singhs 7-10 hot-favourite, Aristotle, to the limit, the Derby is bound to be referred as one of the most exciting Classics in recent times. Moreover, it had all elements that make the Classic stand apart. Daniel Davids Rasalas and Supreme Princess, too, performed impressively, giving the indication that they still have much to offer. In fact, next months 2,800m Calcutta St Leger ? the final Classic of the season ? may see them going to the start as a joint favourites. 

 The two horses had finished almost together, about three lengths behind Deepak Khaitans fighting duo of Aristotle and Arturo, who are leaving for greener pastures in the western and southern India, respectively. However, for the records, Supreme Princess was the fastest finishing horse in the Derby. She is the one for the Leger.

 If Aristotle and Arturo confirmed their superior outstation class in the Derby, the two horses not only paid complements to Rasalas and Supreme Princess, they also validated that the RCTCs top class could match the best elsewhere in the country.

 It was the fastest-run Derby in a decade and the smart timing of 2 minutes 30.5 seconds, cut by Aristotle, was fractionally slower than that of Elusive Pimpernels timing of 2 minutes 30.1 seconds, recorded way back in 1995.

 However, there was no hard luck story for the fancied runners in the star Classic, though the filly Sanskara continued with her antics while Rising Force badly stumbled soon after the start, having clipped in to the heels of the early pacemaker, Clockwork. 

 Trainer Javed Khans Chitralekha is another star in the making. The Serious spender-Bahia Blanca three-year-old filly was an impressive second in her debut run and she gave credence to the observation with a stylish victory in the 1,200m Alokananda Stakes. Mark Reuben, who partnered the filly to victory, had her settled behind a fancied Lasting Love and Star Cluster till the last furlong and took over to overhaul the leaders. Favourite Aerona placed third but the Mull Of Kintyre-Berhala daughter needed the run.

 It was a big day for Javed who notched up a long priced treble. Chitralekha apart, his Kandinsky and Aag, too, won their respective events untroubled. In fact, they were prepared for the big day after much planning.

 Daniel, too, notched up a treble and his Star Memories kicked off the stables operation with an impressive victory to suggest the Steinbeck-Accrual daughter is capable of doing the trick again.

 Daniels Regal Empress and Retained Asset, too, advertised that they were back to the form, which had pushed their ratings up last winter. They won their respective events ? the Zara Shah Cup and the Psychic Flame Cup ? without much of hassles.

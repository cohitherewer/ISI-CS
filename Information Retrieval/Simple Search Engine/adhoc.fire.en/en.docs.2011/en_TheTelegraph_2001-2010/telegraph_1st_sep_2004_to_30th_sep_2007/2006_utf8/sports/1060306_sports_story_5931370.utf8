 Whats cooking, Alastair?

 Alastair Cook 

London: Debutant England batsman Alastair cook has been in India for barely a week, but hes already a sensation off the pitch as well as on it. 

On Saturday, as he was at the non-strikers end en route to his maiden century, umpire Aleem Dar drew his attention to a banner in the crowd ? a marriage proposal from an Indian girl. 

...The umpire told me about a girl in the stands holding up a banner asking me to marry her. I said Ill have to keep my eye out for her, the 21-year-old bachelor was quoted as saying in a British newspaper. 

Cook became the toast of British media who went ballistic in their praise for the Essex batsman, who marked his England debut with a century in the second innings of the first Test in Nagpur.

 Houghton wants players of Materazzis height

JAYDEEP BASU

New Delhi: Italian midfielder Marco Materazzi could be at the centre of controversy, but Indias national coach Bob Houghton would like to have at least half a dozen like him for the Indian team. 

Perturbed by the fact that there is hardly a tall player in the current Indian squad, Houghton hopes that watching the World Cup this time should help Indian football understand the growing importance of height and physical strength in the game. 

After Germany 2006, Indian football should now realise the need for players with good height, Houghton told The Telegraph from Goa. 

Did you look at Materazzi from Italy? He must be at least 1.85 metres tall. He is also a man of enormous strength. No wonder he left the entire French defence high and dry to head in the crucial equaliser in the final. 

To break through the rival defence one needs such height and strength. 

Houghton felt India desperately needed physically strong footballers with good height to gain success in international football. Most of the footballers in all the teams in the World Cup were tall, strong and well built, be it a defender, midfielder or a striker. Without that, its difficult to make an impact. 

Apart from the physical side, the national coach felt India should learn to convert set pieces into goals. I dont have exact statistics with me at the moment, but I think more than half of the goals have come from set-pieces. 

There are teams like Italy, who did not concede a goal except from set-pieces like corners or spot kicks. To break such defence one has to know how to score from set-piece movements. 

 From the tactical point of view, this World Cup didnt 

 offer much to learn, said the British coach.In fact, 

 football hasnt seen too many big tactical changes 

 since the 1990 Cup in Italy. 

 HOW ASIAN TEAMS 

 FARED

 Iran

 They really fell short of my expectations. In France in 

 1998, Iran forced everyone to sit up and take notice of 

 them when they defeated the US in that crucial match. Then 

 they had a bunch of brilliant players. I dont know 

 what happened to them in the last few years, but 10 years 

 ago Iran had a better lot of footballers. 

 Japan

 They were a good team with a mediocre coach. There is no 

 doubt Zico simply messed it up. I watched the Japan-Australia 

 match and thought if only the teams had swapped their coaches. 

 Japan has produced some spectacular footballers like Nakata, 

 Nakamura and Inamuto. I thought they were having problems 

 in the last 30 yards. 

 Saudi Arabia

 I expected them to do better. They always do so well at 

 the Asian level, but fail to translate their superiority 

 at the world stage. This Asian team was quite impressive 

 when they played Tunisia in the group match. With little 

 more luck and better defensive organisation they could have 

 walked away with three points instead of one.

 South Korea

 Expectations from the Asian teams were too high. Korea were 

 unlucky to be in a tough group despite doing a good job. 

 That they were able to hold France 1-1 is an ample example 

 of their strength and defensive qualities.

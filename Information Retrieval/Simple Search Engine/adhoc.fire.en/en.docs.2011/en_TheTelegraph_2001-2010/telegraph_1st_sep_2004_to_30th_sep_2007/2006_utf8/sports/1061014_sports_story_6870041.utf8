 PHL in Chennai, Chandigarh

New Delhi: The Premier Hockey League (PHL) will be a multi-venue event to be played among seven teams in single tier in its third edition beginning next year. 

The tournament, known for introducing innovations in the game such as third umpire system, will be spread over two months starting on January 2 in Chennai and moving to Chandigarh a month later. 

The seven teams have been chosen on the basis of their performance last year and they will play a double round-robin format. 

The PHLs earlier editions were contested by 10 teams divided into two tiers. 

The sides Sher-e-Jalandhar, Chandigarh Dynamos, Maratha Warriors, Bangalore Lions, Hyderabad Sultans, Orissa Steelers and Chennai Veerans will play a total of 42 league matches with the top two teams qualifying for the best of three finals. 

Indian Hockey Federation chief KPS Gill said the annual event had given talented players like Shivendra Singh to the country and hoped the tournament became even a bigger success in future.

 AIFF decision in four days

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is set to call an emergency committee meeting in next four days to deal with the gathering clouds over the ongoing National Football League, following Fransa Paxs threat of withdrawal. 

Announcing this on Thursday, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said that we would see the video footage of the match, match commissioners verdict and then take the necessary actions. 

Fransa lost the match to Mahindra 1-2 at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on Monday, when the referee P. Bikramjit awarded the Mumbai team two controversial penalties. Jose Ramirez Barreto converted both, but the crowd vented their anger by smashing the windows of the Mahindra and the referees rooms. Fransa then threatened to pull out if a replay was not ordered. 

Das Munshi, who came to the city to inaugurate a book at the book fair, was confident that the Goan club would stay on. The NFL started with 10 teams and would end with the same, he said. 

In a belligerent move, Fransa have refused to play against Air India in their next match in Margao on Friday, reports PTI. The Goan club conveyed to the organisers its decision not to attend the managers meeting if no favourable decision was given to them by the AIFF on the eve of Fridays match. 

The match commissioner M.G. Suvarna informed that the match could take place if Fransa turn up on Friday. 

In another move, the federation is looking for alternate venues, keeping in mind that the Salt Lake Stadium in Calcutta and Nehru Stadium in Margao would not be available for the next few days. We are trying to organise matches at the Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi, Rabindra Sarobar in Calcutta and Kantirava in Bangalore, he said. 

Meanwhile, the second division NFL would commence from February 22.

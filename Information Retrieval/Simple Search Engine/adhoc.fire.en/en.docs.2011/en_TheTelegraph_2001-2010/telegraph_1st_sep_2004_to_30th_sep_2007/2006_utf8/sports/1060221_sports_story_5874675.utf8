The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A depressing fortnight for Indian tennis 

 Serve amp; Volley

It has been a depressing fortnight for Indian tennis. First the 1-4 loss to Korea in the Davis Cup at Changwon, Korea, followed by top seed Sanias second-round exit from the WTA tier III tournament in Bangalore. 

The Davis Cup loss was no surprise. Believe me, playing in Korea is tough enough, but having to contend with snowfall, freezing cold and a slow court made our task almost insurmountable. Yet, watching on the television, one felt our boys could have put up a better show. 

The clock is ticking away and there is not a glimpse of the much-awaited breakthrough to significantly higher rankings for Rohan Bopanna and the highly pedigreed Prakash Amritraj. Unless Prakash can break away from the mould of his father Vijay Amritrajs style of unbridled aggression and much hustle, a futile tactic in todays tennis, he will find progress well nigh impossible. In modern tennis, unless you are able to sustain minimum rallies of 5/6 shots at full throttle, it is impossible to find a place in the top 100. I hope I am wrong but I feel it may be difficult at this stage for Prakash to change his mind set and make the break through to the top 100. 

The 27-year-old Bopanna, who has come back from a shoulder injury, is a valuable member of our Davis Cup team. It seems unlikely that Bopanna will be able to sustain a level of play which can take him to the top 100. But he has fire in his belly, and when prepared carefully for an important match, is capable of upsetting higher-ranked players. 

Bopannas ability to serve aces, and whirlwind forehand can pay-off in pressure conditions, specially in Davis Cup matches held in India. One may recall that he held match points against Verkerk, a finalist in the French Open in our Davis Cup match against the Netherlands in September 2003. 

Our loss to Korea in the Asia-Oceania Group I has pushed us down to a clash with Pakistan who lost to Chinese Taipei, to retain our position in Group I. With the surge in tennis standards in Asia, the writing is on the wall, and it may be difficult in the future for India to halt the humbling slide to Group II of the Asia-Oceania zone. 

Thailand with Paradorn Srichaphan a former top-ten player, Chinese Taipei with Wang who recently defeated the highly-rated American James Blake, Korea with Hyung Taik Lee, a seasoned top notcher, will make it impossible for India to be victorious in Group I of the Asia-Oceania Group in future. 

To top it all, Pakistan No. 1 Qureshi is a formidable player, having led Pakistan to victory over Thailand, beating Srichaphan last year. Our tie against Pakistan is scheduled to be held from April 7-9 and though the venue has not been finalised, one presumes it will be on the grasscourts in Delhi.

 Rohan Bopanna has fire in

 his belly

Five times in the last six years India qualified from Group I of the Asia-Oceania zone and challenged in vain for a berth to the elite group of 16 for the Davis Cup, but the gap in standards between the Asia-Oceania zone and the world is just too much. 

It was sad to see a disappointed Sania holding her head after her loss to 115-ranked Camille Pin of France in the second round of the Bangalore meet. For Sania, there are two lessons to be learnt from this match. First, never to relax or let up while in a dominating position (she led 6-1 amp; 5-3) and secondly learn to patiently tackle a slow deep high bouncing ball till she gets a short ball which she can punish with her forehand. 

By now, everyone in the womens dressing room, bristling with personal coaches, must have worked out how to play against Sania. In Shane Warnes words, she will have to face chin music, a barrage of shoulder high balls which brought about Sanias downfall. For Sania the learning process has started. There are bound to be many more losses and the weight of expectations will grow heavier and will test her to the very limit. This is a major factor and cannot be dismissed in glib statements at her press interviews. 

I was amused to see Sania walk back on court after her first round victory, doing a triumphant pirouette and blow kisses to the crowd before departing. One recalls an incident two or three years ago when Srichapan defeated Agassi on the Centre Court at Wimbledon and while departing, in traditional Thai style, bowed to the crowd with folded hands to thunderous applause. I have little doubt that Sania would have had a rapturous response if she had done an elaborate adaab to her fans in the stadium.

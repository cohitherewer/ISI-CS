 Midfield a worry for both teams

 - IFA promises entire prize money to players if Bengal emerge champions 

JAYDEEP BASU 

 Golden chance for Dipendu and Co. to bring back the trophy 

Gurgaon: For 10 years, between 1976 and 1986, Prasanta Banerjee and Parminder Singh had manned the Indian midfield quite effectively. But on Wednesday, sitting at the opposite benches in the Santosh Trophy final for Bengal and Punjab, the two are likely to remain more worried about their midfield than anything else. 

Both Banerjee and Parminder had readily agreed that the battle at the Devi Lal Sports Complex here will be won and lost in the midfield. While Parminder said he only hoped his midfielders play the game like they did against Maharashtra in the second half, Banerjee made it clear that Avinash Thapa and company would have to assist the strikers more to press for a victory. 

My midfielders and strikers still leave a big gap between themselves on the pitch, said Banerjee. The midfielders have to be more positive and go for scoring goals. Otherwise, it would be of no use even if we dominate the match. 

Banerjee has reasons to push the midfielders. Despite the recent euphoria, Bengal so far have scored only two goals in the final rounds with one of them coming from a free-kick. Barring Dipendu Biswas, no one has got a goal against his name and various combinations have failed to improve the situation. 

Both Bengal and Punjab are certain to go with the same combinations that played in the semi-finals on Sunday. Bengal will once again go to the match with one goalkeeper as Kalyan Chowbey is yet not fit to take the field. No wonder, Tanumoy Bose worked nearly for an hour with Abhra Mondal alone during the morning practice. 

The Bengal practice session on Tuesday was not as vigorous as on Monday though Banerjee made the boys sweat it out for at least an hour. Four of the boys Syed Rahim Nabi, Habibur Rehman Mondal, Tariq Ahmed and Shyam Mondal were busy offering Eid prayers in the morning and practised separately in the evening. 

The battle of supremacy between Bengal and Punjab in the Santosh Trophy had always attracted spectators. On Wednesday, it wont be any different it seems. While a large number of local Bengal fans are likely to throng the ground, the entire bunch of former internationals from Punjab, including Inder Singh, Gurdev Singh, Harjinder Singh and Sukhwinder Singh are landing the capital early Wednesday morning to cheer their team in the final. 

Punjab have an impeccable track record whenever Santosh Trophy has been staged in the North Zone. Except the one in Srinagar in 1978, Punjab have reached the final on all occasions. While they won the title in 1970, 1974 (both Jalandhar) and 1985 (Kanpur), Kerala pipped them in the final in Delhi in 2004. Bengals lone triumph in the North came in 1978 at Srinagar under Gautam Sarkar. 

If Bengal have not won the Santosh Trophy for six years, Punjabs record is even worse. The sixth and the last time they won it was in 1989 in Quilon, though they have entered the final twice thereafter. 

On Wednesday, Punjab certainly have a slight edge despite losing to Bengal in the quarter final league match. They have quite a few players in Praveen Kumar, Sukhjinder Singh, Narinder, Harpreet and Baldeep, who are richer in experience. Bengal, on the other hand, have a youthful side, who are bubbling with enthusiasm to take the Santosh Trophy back home. 

But, then, not winning the Trophy for six years is not a new experience for the 29-time champions. In the 60s, when Bengal were a stronger football force, the famed side failed to bag the title for six years till an unknown bunch of footballers then brought it back from Nowgong with a thumping 6-1 win over Services in the final. 

That unknown lot then included players like Subhas Bhowmick, Swapan Sengupta, Sudhir Karmakar and Sukalyan Ghosh Dastidar. The Nowgong tourney turned them into big stars almost overnight. It is time for Shyam Mondal, Avinash Thapa, Asim Das or Tapan Maity to match the feat of the former stars. 

The kick off is at 5pm. The match will be shown live on Zee Sports. 

Meanwhile, Bengal camp got an extra motivation when the IFA had promised to divide the entire prize money among the players if they emerged champions. The IFA secretary Subrata Dutta conveyed the incentive to the Bengal captain on Tuesday evening.

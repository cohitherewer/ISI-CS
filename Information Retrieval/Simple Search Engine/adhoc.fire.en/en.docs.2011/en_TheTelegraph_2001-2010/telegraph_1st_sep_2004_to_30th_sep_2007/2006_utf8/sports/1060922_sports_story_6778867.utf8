Kuala Lumpur: Australias decision to not change the pre-determined XI for Fridays match against India, even though it now has the status of a semi-final, should take some of the pressure off Rahul Dravid. The Indians wont have to contend with the in-form Michael Clarke and Shane Watson, plus theyll have the opportunity to take runs off Stuart Clark, who went for 87 in seven the other evening. 

However, banking on that alone can only confirm an early departure from the Malaysian capital. Clearly, the Indians have to raise their game appreciably. Otherwise, prepare for the worst. 

Perhaps, nobody but the Australians would have had the courage (one isnt sure about the conviction bit) to retain somebody taken to the cleaners by Brian Lara and Chris Gayle. Then, again, its unlikely that any other team would have kept Clarke and Watson on the bench. 

Says much about the Australian system and the teams depth, but what if a decision cast in stone (by chief selector Andrew Hilditch and his colleagues) proves costly in the DLF Cup? 

The first league match between the teams had seen points shared, but the psychological advantage was pocketed by Australia. If the weather spoils the show and points have again to be shared, then the Australians are going to be through as theyll be starting on seven, one point more than India. 

Its an exciting opportunity, but weve got to be consistently good... Throughout the 100 overs... If we fulfil our goals in batting and bowling, then the results are going to follow... We arent putting ourselves under extra pressure, remarked Dravid. 

Ponting, who declared there would be no excuses if Australia lost, said Wednesdays result (India beating the West Indies, whore in the final) didnt surprise him. The Indians had everything to play for, not the West Indies... Id expected an Indian victory... 

Looking ahead, he added: Of course, weve got the final in our thoughts... Thats why were here, to win enough matches to get there... I expect the Indians to be worried about their batting, but we do know their batsmen may come good at any time... I know weve been experimenting, but Ive told the guys there will be more positives than negatives from this exercise... 

While the Indians prefer to set a target, provided Dravid has the option of choosing, Ponting didnt commit himself. The power play trends have to be studied... Perhaps, its easier batting under the lights... 

The match, by the way, wont be played on the wicket which hosted Wednesdays India versus West Indies face-off. The one to be used looks good, but one cant be sure... Theres moisture owing to the match-eve watering, but the sun ought to take cae of that, Dravid maintained. 

He acknowledged not having scored big in any of the three matches: Well, Im pretty desperate each time that I go to bat... Getting runs is going to be nice... The openers (Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar) havent put together a tidy stand in the last two matches and will have to tackle the Glenn McGrath-Brett Lee twosome. 

Its a tough ask. 

Asked what made the Australians such a champion team, Dravid replied: Depth in their squad, very good preparations and good players... He summed it up perfectly. 

While the Australians have announced their XI, the Indians havent. Indications are that the XI which played Wednesday is going to be retained. Yuvraj Singh (who hasnt got off the mark in two matches) and Ajit Agarkar were a bit under the weather, as Dravid put it, but will be available for selection. 

I had a flu-like feeling yesterday, before the match, and had a bad cold today... Thats why I didnt go for nets. Im going to be fine for tomorrow, though, Agarkar told The Telegraph. Yuvraj didnt bat, but was at the Kinrara Oval with the rest. 

Incidentally, theres speculation that Mohammed Kaif could be recalled. He got dropped after the first match.

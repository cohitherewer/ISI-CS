The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Alford may face ban 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: The poor handling of a fancied runner, Appoint (C.Alford up), led to wild protest by the punters here on Friday. It prompted the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) stewards to cancel the remaining race in the afternoons eight-event card, the Poottannah Memorial Plate, and also order an inquiry into the running and riding of the horse, trained by Rashid Byramji. 

 The 3-1 second favourite was ridden in an amateurish manner by the Calcutta-champion jockey Alford, who took the horse into a long lead from the start. What raised serious doubts about Alfords intentions was when the jockey started looking back frequently for no apparent reason, in stead of countering the challenge of a less-fancied runner Hidalgo, the ultimate winner. Although, the outcome of the inquiry is awaited, it may not come as a surprise if stewards slap a long ban on Alford.

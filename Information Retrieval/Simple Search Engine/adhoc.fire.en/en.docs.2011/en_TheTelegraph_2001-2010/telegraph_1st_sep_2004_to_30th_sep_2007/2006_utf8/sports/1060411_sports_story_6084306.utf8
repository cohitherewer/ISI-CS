The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid is a 

 work of art in progress 

 - A coach never matters to a cricketer as much as a captain 

 does

Taking Guard

 Graham Gooch

 Guwahati was bad news. So was 

 Faridabad for blows of other kind. In New Delhi, in the 

 first half, crowd simmered in unrest as Indians collapsed. 

 Four years ago against the West Indies, stone-pelting from 

 the stands was a norm. One-day matches in India are showing 

 up a dangerous pattern.

 Most of these matches are in far-flung 

 venues. Big time cricket comes to town once in three years 

 as was the case in Guwahati. If there is no action, the 

 fans also end up worrying about the waste of a ticket. Indian 

 cricket authorities need to regulate its policy on refund 

 and security. They also cant ignore the sub-standard 

 pitches.

 I wonder if Rahul Dravid made 

 a few phone calls to his team to know if everyone was safe. 

 A captain can never really tear himself apart from his team. 

 Gaining respect is a constant process. A coach never matters 

 to a cricketer as much as a captain does. Its a litmus 

 test for a captain if every member of his unit is approaching 

 him with confidence and trust. There should be no pecking 

 order. 

 A captain is also the public face 

 of the team. I have thus evinced a keen interest in Dravids 

 public stance on issues and men. Most of the time he hams 

 or is being repetitive. He defends his men and opposition, 

 and there is never a harsh word for a pitch or a curator. 

 He is nearly always politically correct and nearly always 

 boring.

 I wonder if a frenzied media has 

 shaped his approach for he can be lucid and thoughtful in 

 private. Still, it is dangerous to show as if he would rather 

 not have them around. As a cricketer, one learns to accept 

 that not everything written about you is nice. But you still 

 need to cope and accommodate and cant get hot under 

 the collar. 

 Dravid needs to sound more honest 

 in his appraisals. It could be the final frontier of his 

 all-winning persona.

 As a batsman, he is in the mould 

 of a Steve Waugh or an Allan Border. These men might miss 

 the flair of a Virender Sehwag or a Brian Lara, but once 

 they sink their teeth in, they dont let go easily. 

 Once set, they can only be removed by exceptional methods. 

 They move up and down the order with fluidity and grace. 

 Once they get in, they make it count ? just recall his double 

 centuries.

 In my book, he is the very best 

 of Indian batting along with Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar. 

 In record or in style, at home or abroad, on all pitches 

 and all conditions, he is the very best. He even made a 

 virtue out of wicket-keeping. Figures dont lie. 

 Its the destiny of efficiency 

 to suffer in comparison with flair. Thus, even though most 

 of the headlines went to Tendulkar or Sehwag in the last 

 five years, it was Dravid who was of utmost value to an 

 Indian side. Its a journey similar to Anil Kumble, 

 only your opponents know your worth. Its an irony 

 that statistics which are held in front to condemn a few, 

 are never cited to emphasise the value of others.

 Its not easy to explain 

 what drives such men. As one who has also played over 100 

 Tests stretching deep into the next decade, I know my motivation 

 simply was to turn out in my countrys colours. Nothing 

 beat the feeling, it never failed to get me going. Dravid, 

 by his conduct, has shown that its the pursuit of 

 excellence, and not fame or money, which has driven him 

 all along these years.

 Now that he is Indias captain 

 till the next World Cup, my unsolicited advice is he shouldnt 

 ignore his batting. The demands will hang on his time like 

 a pall of dark foreboding. It could stop him from working 

 on his batting; it could force him to seek short-cuts. It 

 never works. He has to keep working on his game.

 Dravid is still a work of art 

 in progress.

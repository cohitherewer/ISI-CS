The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Calcutta may host Federation Cup

 - Asian Cup qualifiers camp from Aug. 4 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Struggling to find suitable dates in their already jam packed calendar, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) might postpone the Federation Cup till the end of the year and host it only after the Doha Asian Games. 

According to AIFF sources, while Calcutta could be the possible venue for the prestigious knockout tournament for the eighth time, it may only be played from the third week of December, a few weeks before the start of the National Football League (NFL). According to the AIFF calendar released at the start of the season, Federation Cup was slotted for October. 

Federation Cup is normally held in October/November, but this time there are no dates available before December, an AIFF official said. Santosh Trophy will be held in September. The top players will also remain busy with national duty in the Asian Cup qualifiers at that time. So there is no chance of holding the Federation Cup then. 

To make the matter worse, the AIFF will also remain busy in staging the Asian Under-20 final rounds in Bangalore and Calcutta from October 29 to November 12. The tournament will be followed by the national camp for the Asian Games to be held in Doha from December 1 to 16. The football event in the Asian Games is beginning from November 28. 

Like Santosh Trophy, the AIFF is yet to finalise the venue for the Federation Cup. Federation sources said that while Zee Televisions has shown its preference for Calcutta, IFA is believed to have asked the AIFF to allow it to host the IFA Shield prior to the Federation Cup. 

Meanwhile, national coach Bob Houghton has expressed his desire to meet the coaches of the three NFL teams in Calcutta during the camp for the Asian Cup qualifiers against Saudi Arabia. 

The camp will begin from August 4. While all the footballers playing for the national squad in Vancouver have been called, 14 more players have been included in the camp. 

Additional players for the camp 

Subroto Pal, Dharamjit Singh, Dipak Mondal and Sanjeev Maria (Mohun Bagan), Arindam Bhattacharya and Rakesh Massi (TFA), Syed Rahim Nabi, Alvito DCunha, Tariq Ahmed and Debabrata Roy (East Bengal), Madhab Das (Mohammedan Sporting), Abdul Basheer (SBT), K. Ajayan (Mahindra United) and Jo Paul Ancheri (no club).

Mumbai: India raised hopes of a dream fightback in the final session of Day 3 here at the Wankhede Stadium. First, the tail wagged to stretch the total to 279, thus restricting Englands first-innings lead to 121. Then, the young pacers knocked over both English openers to leave the visitors on 31 for two in the third and final Test. 

Fiery spells by Munaf Patel and Sreesanth resulted in the early exits of first-innings centurion Andrew Strauss and Ian Bell. Both openers edged to Mahendra Singh Dhoni, with Patel accounting for the former and Sreesanth sending back the right-hander. 

Had Yuvraj Singh not let off nightwatchman Shaun Udal, India would have finished the day in even better spirits after the disappointing first two sessions. 

Owais Shah is at the crease with 15 and nightwatchman Shaun Udal is on 2, having been let off at third slip by Yuvraj Singh off Sreesanth in the last over of the day. 

Dhoni led the rearguard action with a brave knock of 64 before being given run out in controversial circumstances by third umpire K. Hariharan. 

Anil Kumble (30) and Sreesanth (29 not out) then put on a defiant 55-run partnership for the ninth wicket to help India rally from 217 for eight to 279. 

In the morning, India were pushed to the backfoot by the England seamers. They lost both overnight batsmen, Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj, before lunch. Both were victims of some excellent glovework by Geraint Jones behind the stumps. 

Yuvraj (37) flashed at one well outside off stump to be taken by a diving Jones in front of first slip, while Dravid (52) fell to a fine legside effort. Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson were the bowlers to benefit. 

Barring Dhonis cracking half-century, which included ten fours, there was little to enthuse about the Indian batting in the morning session. 

Hit on the back of the head, just below the left ear, by Flintoff in the pre-lunch session, Dhoni took the attack to the rival camp. The long-haired keeper even slammed the England captain for three fours in the first over with the second new ball. 

Harbhajan Singh was packed off by Anderson with the second ball of his spell with the new ball, thanks to another Jones gem. It was the stumpers fifth catch of the innings, an outstanding effort. 

The hosts, 153 for five at lunch, added 64 runs in 27 overs in the second session. Irfan Pathan fell with India needing 15 runs to avoid the follow-on. 

The left-hander lofted Udal straight to Matthew Hoggard at deep mid on after having put on 44 with Dhoni. 

Dhoni didnt flinch despite being hit by Flintoff, but he did have his share of luck when Monty Panesar grassed a not-too-easy catch, diving to his left, off Anderson. 

In the same over, Matt Prior ? substituting for Flintoff ? dropped a sitter off Dravid. But Anderson had his man in the very next over. 

 Hoggard confirmed 

Steve Harmison has been officially ruled out of the seven-match ODI series against India starting on March 28. As was reported by The Telegraph on Sunday, Matthew Hoggard will stay back for the ODIs as Harmisons replacement. 

Harmison, who was ruled out of the ongoing final Test because of a shin stress on his right leg, would be flown home, according to the ECB. 

Stephen (Harmison) is still experiencing pain in his right shin and with the Test series against Sri Lanka due to start in early May, we have decided that the safest course of action is to rest him from the forthcoming ODI series here in India, ECB chief medical officer Peter Gregory said.

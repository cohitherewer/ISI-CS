 Scolari deal extended

Lisbon: Portugals soccer federation has extended its contract with Brazilian-born Luiz Felipe Scolari as coach of the national team until 2008, the federation said on its website on Friday. Scolari steered Portugal to fourth place in the World Cup finals in Germany. 

Earlier, Scolari turned down an offer from the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) to take over Brazils national squad, which he led to the World Cup title in 2002. 

A spokesman for Scolari said the tough-talking Brazilian had opted to stay in Europe with his family. 

Meanwhile, Bruce Arena has lost his job as the US coach while Zlatko Kranjcar was sacked as Croatias, following their respective teams early exit at the World Cup finals. (Agencies)

Bangalore: The Indian cricketers practised for four hours at two venues on the first day of their skills-specific camp in the build-up to the tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

Skipper Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Lakshmipathy Balaji and V.R.V. Singh attended the nets session at the NCA campus under coach Greg Chappell and physio John Glosters supervision. 

The other players worked out at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, where trainer Gregory King and bio-mechanist Ian Frazer were present. 

The focus of attention was comeback man Sachin Tendulkar, who was seen taking catches and throwing the ball from within 25 yards. 

The players practised for two hours each in the morning and afternoon. 

During the post-lunch nets, the NCA under-19 boys bowled to their seniors. In the afternoon, the emphasis was on fielding. Before the morning session, the players had a one-hour yoga session as well. 

India begin their tri-series campaign with a match against the hosts on August 16. South Africa are the third side in the competition.

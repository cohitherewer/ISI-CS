 Flip-flop on Sehwag

 Sehwag

Abu Dhabi: Virender Sehwags exclusion from the team for the first ODI against Pakistan on Tuesday was explained as an effort to shield the struggling batsman ahead of the tour of the West Indies. 

The team management could not risk another failure by the batsman before the start of the West Indies tour. We want him to regroup and work out his batting in nets and not in a pressure situation against Pakistan, said a team source on condition of anonymity. 

However, that explanation is hardly convincing as, if Sehwag had to be shielded, he wouldnt have been in the XII shortlisted and announced at the team meeting late on Monday. Obviously, somebody had a major rethink on the day of the match. 

Team manager Rajiv Shukla said much should not be read into Sehwags exclusion. 

He is not injured. It was just that the team decided to give Robin Uthappa another chance after some last-minute deliberations, he said. 

Sehwag is going through one of his worst slumps, and after failing in the Jamshedpur ODI against England, he had himself said he would prefer a break. He was subsequently not played in the Indore one-dayer. 

With Uthappa showing promise, the pressure is mounting on him to sort out his batting in time for the tour of the West Indies, beginning May 12. 

The ODI squad will be named in Mumbai on Thursday.

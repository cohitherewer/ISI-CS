 PCB ready for WADA challenge

Karachi: The PCB has said it was prepared to face any move from World Anti-Doping Agency challenging the decision to set aside the bans on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

Amid reports that WADA may challenge the decision of the PCB-appointed appeals tribunal to exonerate the pacers, a senior official said it was prepared for any eventuality. 

We feel we did the right thing in appointing inquiry and appeals tribunals and the fact is that both players were exonerated on basis of the anti-doping regulations of the PCB and not that of WADA or ICC. (PTI)

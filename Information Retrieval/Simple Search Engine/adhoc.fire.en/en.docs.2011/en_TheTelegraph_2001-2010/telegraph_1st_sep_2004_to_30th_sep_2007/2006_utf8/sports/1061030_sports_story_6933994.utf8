 Procter rules Bravo not guilty 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: West Indian Dwayne Bravo has been found not guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during his teams Champions Trophy game against England in Motera on Saturday. 

According to an ICC release, Bravo was charged with a breach of C1 of the Code, failing to conduct play within the spirit of the game, the incident in question being his catch to dismiss Michael Yardy. Television replays suggested the ball did not carry to the fielder. 

 The charge was laid by the umpires, and the hearing was conducted by Match Referee Mike Procter on Sunday. 

 Television replays appeared to show the ball bounced but Dwayne thought he had taken the catch cleanly, Procter said after the hearing. From my experience as a player I know that can happen, but we needed to ask the question to make sure it was a genuine mistake by the player. 

For that reason the umpires were right to lay the charge, but aAfter talking to Dwayne, I had no reason to disbelieve his version.

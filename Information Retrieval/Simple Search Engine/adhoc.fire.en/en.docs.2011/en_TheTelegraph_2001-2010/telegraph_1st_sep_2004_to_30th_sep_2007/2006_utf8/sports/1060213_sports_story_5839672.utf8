 Sania to open vs No. 104

Bangalore: Sania Mirza will kickstart her title defence against a relatively easy opponent in world No. 104 Martina Muller of Germany in the first round of the $175,000 Bangalore Open starting here on Monday. 

The 19-year-old, who had won the event at her hometown Hyderabad last year, should be able to cross the first hurdle without much difficulty at the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association Courts. 

However, compatriots Ankita Bhambri, ranked 361, and Rushmi Chakravarty (370) ? both wild card entrants ? are pitted against strong opponents as per the draw in the Sony Ericsson WTA Tier III event. 

Ankita is set to clash with Kaia Kanepi (94) of Estonia, who was a semi-finalist at the Sunfeast Tier III event at Calcutta last September. 

Rushmi meets Hungarys Melinda Czink (119), who had reached the quarter final at the Calcutta event, beating Sania. 

The third Indian wild-card entry, Isha Lakhani (482), has to fight it out with a qualifier to secure a second round berth. 

The winner takes home $28,000 besides 120 points.

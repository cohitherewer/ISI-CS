 Drogba backs Ghana 

Nuremberg: Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba has urged Ghana captain Stephen Appiah to do well against the United States and take an African team into the last 16. 

World Cup newcomer Ghana play the United States on Thursday in a Group E decider, while Italy take on the Czech Republic. 

Appiah said he had spoken to Drogba, and Togo players Emmanuel Adebayor of Arsenal and Mohamed Kader about the upcoming game in Nuremberg. 

Ghana is one of four African debutantes in Germany, but Ivory Coast and Togo have already been eliminated. 

I spoke to Drogba, Adebayor and Kader and they said: Guys, we are behind you people, we couldnt make it so you have to represent Africa, Appiah said. 

I was very happy when I heard such a thing from my friends ... We are well prepared and it will be a crucial game, but as we are determined to win, I think we can make it. 

 The Black Stars lost their opening game to Italy but rebound with a shock 2-0 win over the Czech Republic. 

People didnt expect us to play the way we played. All Ghanaians are happy not only for Ghana but for the whole continent as well, Appiah said. 

We are cool and ready. Most importantly, we are ready to meet the US tomorrow. 

Ghana will play without suspended striker Asamoah Gyan and midfielder Sulley Muntari, who both scored against the Czechs. 

Were going to miss them ... But all the guys are ready to die for the nation, Appiah said. 

Coach Ratomir Dujkovic said he did not underestimate the Americans but admitted he was looking forward to a possible second-round clash with Brazil.

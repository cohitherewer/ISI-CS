 Cant call it a rivalry yet: Federer

 - World No. 1 vs Rafael Nadal

 Federer says there are too many great players around 

Indian Wells: World No. 1 Roger Federer said it was too early to tell whether he and Rafael Nadal will establish a major rivalry. 

Spanish teenager Nadal broke Federers 56-match hardcourt winning streak with a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory in Dubai last Sunday and boasts a 3-1 record against the Swiss 

But Federer said the competition was too fierce to develop a rivalry like the one between Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. Ive played him only four times and obviously we are number one and number two, but well have to see how it progresses, said Federer, the top seed at this weeks Pacific Life Open. 

There are more players than just Nadal. The other players will play well here too at Indian Wells. I dont think we can call it a rivalry yet. Theres just too many great players around. 

But eight-time Grand Slam champion Agassi thinks the pairing has the makings of a classic and said that the left-handed Nadal, who is seeded second at Indian Wells, has the game to challenge Federer. 

I think it would be impossible for anybody to dominate the way Roger did in the past two years, Agassi said. 

Its great to see that the one person closest to him in the rankings is his most difficult match-up. Nadal can hit that one shot everybody wishes they can hit against Roger and thats getting the ball up to his backhand side.

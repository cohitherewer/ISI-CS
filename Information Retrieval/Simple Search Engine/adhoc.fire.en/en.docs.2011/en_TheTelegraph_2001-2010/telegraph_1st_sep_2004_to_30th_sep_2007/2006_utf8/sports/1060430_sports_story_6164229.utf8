 Zimbabwe 151/9

St Johns: Justice Chibhabha scored a half-century but Zimbabwe could only muster 151 for nine in their 50 overs in the first ODI against the West Indies at the Antigua Recreation Ground on Saturday. 

Chibhabhas 55 was the top score after Zimbabwe lost the toss and were put in on a pitch showing signs of dampness. 

Captain Terry Duffins 26 and Brendan Taylors 25 were the visitors only other double-figure scores. Dwayne Bravo took 2/23. 

Chibhabha, 19, and playing only his second ODI, faced 98 balls and hit five fours. This is Brian Laras first match of his third tenure as the West indies captain. (REUTERS)

 BCCIs soft stand sets off speculation

 -Move to make Abu Dhabi India-dominated

Islamabad: The BCCIs soft stand on organisational glitches during the two ODIs against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi is being seen as a move to turn it into a high-profile India-dominated international venue. 

The BCCI did not raise any hue and cry over mismanagement at the stadium where blunders like stopping Sharad Pawar at the entrance and alleged manhandling of Praful Patel were committed. 

PCB sources said the BCCI went out of its way to help the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council (ADCC) in organising the Friendship Cup against Pakistan. Although it was the ADCC which is credited with organising the series, in reality the entire show was managed by BCCI officials from behind the scenes. Clearly the move is on to turn Abu Dhabi into an India-dominated international venue, a PCB source was quoted as saying in a daily. 

Indians were never happy when Sharjah used to host matches as they always considered it as a Pakistan-dominated set-up headed by Abdul Rehman Bukhatir. Now clearly Pawar and party are working according to a plan to turn Abu Dhabi into their own territory, he added. 

When the Indian government stopped its team from playing at neutral, venues it mentioned in its letter that India should not play in Sharjah and other parts of the UAE. 

When the idea was first floated for the Friendship Cup by the Indians, the PCB reminded them of the Indian government letter and the fact that Abu Dhabi was part of the UAE, but Pawar said Pakistan should just prepare and he had got clearance from his government. 

Meanwhile Pakistan ambassador to UAE, Ahsan-Ullah Khan received a cheque of $7.5m from BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah for the Kashmir earthquake victims. A sum of $2.5 m was given to the Indian victims. (PTI)

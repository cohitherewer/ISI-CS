 Bush catches up with soccer

Berlin: US President George W. Bush said on Sunday that he did not even know what a soccer ball looked like when he was young but a new generation of Americans was catching up with the rest of the world. 

As a boy I never even saw a soccer ball, Bush told a German paper. Where Im from soccer wasnt played. The sport just didnt exist. So there is a generation of Americans who really arent soccer fans. 

Bush said a lot of Americans did not even realise until recently how important the World Cup is. A lot of us grew up without any connection to soccer ? me, for example, he said. But there is a new generation that has grown up with soccer. They obviously have a great interest in the World Cup. And some of us older fellas are starting to understand how important the World Cup is for the whole world. 

Bush said he had also learned the US have a good team that qualified for the World Cup finals this year after reaching the quarter finals in 2002. Of course the US is my team, he said. Ive been told that we have a good team. But who knows whether its good enough to win.

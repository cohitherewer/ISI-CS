 Murray, Clement in final

 - WASHINGTON MEET

 Murray in Washington on Saturday 

Washington: Experienced Frenchman Arnaud Clement and British teenager Andy Murray roared into the Legg Mason Classic final with straight-set victories on Saturday. 

Clement needed two hours to outduel former world No. 1 Marat Safin 7-6, 7-6, while Murray eased past Russian Dmitry Tursunov 6-2, 7-5 to reach his second final of the year. 

The 11th-seeded Clement traded crisp groundstrokes with Safin, each player losing service only twice in the match. Safin opened the door for the Frenchman by getting only 58 per cent of first serves in. 

A costly double-fault by Safin in the first-set tie-break gave Clement a 6-5 lead. Clement won the set on the next point when the Russian punched a forehand volley into the net. 

I had a couple of double-faults at important moments, said Safin, who served nine aces but five double-faults. I havent been in the semi-finals in a long time. I got nervous. 

The 28-year-old Clement, ranked 57th and searching for his fourth career title, won the second-set tie-break 7-4, securing a mini-break to take a 5-4 lead before serving out the match. 

Safin, ranked 92 in the world and unseeded in Washington, had leads of 3-1 in the first set and 4-2 in the second before Clement battled back. 

Murray, seeded eighth in his first week playing under new coach Brad Gilbert, won five straight games to turn a 0-1 deficit in the first set into a 5-1 advantage. 

In the second set, Tursunov had the 19-year-old Scot down 2-5 but the Russian did not win another game. Murray broke seventh-seeded Tursunov in the 11th game to take a 6-5 lead and closed out the 84-minute match.

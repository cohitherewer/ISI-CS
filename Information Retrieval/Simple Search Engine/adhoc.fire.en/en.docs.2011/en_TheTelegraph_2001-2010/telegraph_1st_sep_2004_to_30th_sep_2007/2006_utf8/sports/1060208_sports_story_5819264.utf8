 Sachin detects flag faux-pas, PCB sorry

Peshawar: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has apologised for the disrespect shown to the Indian flag due to their negligence in printing it upside down on some of the tickets for the first one-day match here. 

The mistake was rectified after Sachin Tendulkar, brought it to the notice of the team management, which then sent a letter to the PCB drawing their attention to the gaffe. 

A giant Indian flag put up in the lobby of the fourth floor of the hotel where the Indians were staying, was also put upside down with the green up and saffron at the bottom whereas it should have been the other way round, was also reported in a Pakistan daily on Tuesday. 

Indian teams media manager G.S.Walia said no protest has been lodged over the mistake. (PTI)

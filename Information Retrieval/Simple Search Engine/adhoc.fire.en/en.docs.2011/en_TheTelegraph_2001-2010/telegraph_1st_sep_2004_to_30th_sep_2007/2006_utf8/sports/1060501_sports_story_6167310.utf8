 Barcelona sniff crown, thanks to Ronaldinho

Madrid: Barcelona gave themselves a chance of wrapping up their second successive league title when a powerful Ronaldinho strike secured them a 1-0 win at home to relegation-threatened Cadiz on Saturday. 

Barcelona looked a little jaded after securing a place in the Champions League final earlier this week but Ronaldinho earned the victory that put them 11 points clear when he slammed home from 12 metres after nine minutes. 

Relegation-threatened Real Betis and Athletic Bilbao shared the points in a 1-1 draw in Seville, a result that was enough to keep both sides clear of the danger zone. 

In Berlin, Bayern Munich beat Eintracht Frankfurt 1-0 to win the German Cup on Saturday for the 13th time and move a step closer to a second successive double.

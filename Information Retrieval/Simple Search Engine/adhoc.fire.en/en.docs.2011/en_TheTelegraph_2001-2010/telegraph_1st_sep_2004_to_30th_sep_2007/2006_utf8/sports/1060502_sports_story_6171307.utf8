 Sethuramans first IM norm

Dubai: S. P. Sethuraman secured his maiden International Master norm with a brilliant victory over IM Sergei Simonenko of Turkmenistan in the eighth and penultimate round of the Dubai International Open Chess Championship here. 

The Chennai-based teenager, who has so far lost only his third-round game in the event, took his tally to 5.5 points after a win with white pieces against the titled player. 

Women International Master Kruttika Nadig also took a stride towards her maiden Women Grandmaster norm by scoring a thumping victory over WIM Atousa Pourkashiyan of Iran. 

Another Indian running for a norm, M. R. Lalith Babu, also had it easy against local star Jasim A. R. Saleh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BSF may skip meet from next year

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Defending champions BSF (Jalandhar) seem to have been annoyed by Bengal Hockey Association (BHA) mismanagement of the reputed hockey tournament of the country, to such an extent that they are planning not to field their team from the next edition. 

This premier tournament of the country is an example of perfect mismanagement. They dont provide us with accommodation all throughout the meet and also there were no proper medical facilities on the field, said BSF coach Kuljeet Singh after his team lost to Punjab and Sindh Bank (PSB) 0-1. 

Kuljeet also went on to accuse referee H. S. Sokhi and said that the he (referee) spoilt his teams chance of retaining the title. 

Every time my wards were making a move he was giving a foul for stupid reasons. For him we lost momentum on quite a few occasions, where we could have scored. Sokhi didnt want to annoy PSBs coach-cum-player Baljit Singh Saini and gave decisions in their favour, added the BSF coach angrily. 

Meanwhile, PSB coach Saini a former Olympian, already riding high on winning the title for the fourth time is planning to undergo an FIH rated training programme for the coachs. 

Lot of people have advised me in the past to become a full-fledged coach but I took those comments lightly. Now I think its time to sit down and give it a second thought. I may go for a FIH rated training programme, said Saini. 

Eighteen-year-old Gurvinder Singh Chandi who emerged as the Man-of-the-Tournament is hopeful of earning berth in the national team. 

 I have represented India in the junior team and also got call-ups for the national camp twice. But I think my performance here would be noticed, he said.

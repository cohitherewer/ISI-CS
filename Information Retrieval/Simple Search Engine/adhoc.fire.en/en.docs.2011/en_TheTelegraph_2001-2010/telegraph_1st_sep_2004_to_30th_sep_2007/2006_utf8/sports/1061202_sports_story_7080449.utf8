 Afridi not in ODI squad

Karachi: Pakistan selectors on Friday dropped the out-of-form Shahid Afridi from the 14-man squad for the first ODI of the five-match series against the West Indies. 

Pakistan will also be without regular captain Inzamam-ul Haq for Tuesdays game in Rawalpindi. The ICC had banned Inzamam for four ODIs for forfeiting The Oval Test against England in August. 

Afridi, 26, has been in poor form this year, scoring only 114 runs in 17 matches with a meagre average of 8.14 and has taken 14 wickets. 

Younis Khan will lea in the first match.

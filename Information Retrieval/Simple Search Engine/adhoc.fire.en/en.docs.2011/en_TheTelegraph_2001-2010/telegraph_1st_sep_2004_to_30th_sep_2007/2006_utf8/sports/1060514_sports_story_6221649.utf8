 Chandhok clinches pole

 formula Asia Series

 Sepang: Karun Chandhok 

 provided team E-racing a stunning start by clinching the 

 first pole of the inaugural Formula Asia Renault V6 series 

 at the Sepang F1 circuit here on Saturday.

 Having set a scorching pace in 

 the Friday practice sessions, the 22-year old made use of 

 the cloudy and dry conditions to take the front position 

 on the grid with the best timing of 1 minute and 58.234 

 seconds.

 I was sure that I would 

 be among the top three but did not expect to be in the pole. 

 So I am all the more happy, Chandhok said after the 

 qualifying.

 The relatively cool conditions, 

 due to overnight rains, was slowly giving way to humid and 

 hot conditions when Chandhok set out of the garage for his 

 second qualifying session.

 The Chennai boy was familiar with 

 the circuit and it showed in his pushing the 3500cc Renault 

 engine to the maximum at every straight and bend of the 

 Sepang circuit. The sun had begun to blaze by the time the 

 cars returned to the paddock, indicating a tough days 

 work ahead for the drivers.

 My fitness is good. I have 

 prepared well for the series and am happy with the way I 

 managed myself today, Chandhok said. 

 Independent driver Daisuke Ikeda, 

 24, took the second position, with more than six-tenth of 

 a second behind Chandhok.

 The Renault V6 series is the highlight 

 race of the Asian Festival of Speed which also comprises 

 Porsche Carrera Cup Asia series, Formula BMW Asia series 

 and the Asian Touring Car Championships.

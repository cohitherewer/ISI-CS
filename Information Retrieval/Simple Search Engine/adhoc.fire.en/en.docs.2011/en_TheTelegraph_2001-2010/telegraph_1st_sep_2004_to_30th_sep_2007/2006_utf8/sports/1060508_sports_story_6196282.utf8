 Three Pak A players jailed for traffic offence

 Karachi: The euphoria of winning the Eurasia 

 Series died down quickly when three Pakistan A players found 

 themselves behind bars in Dubai for crossing speed limits 

 while driving. 

 Misbah-ul Haq, Taufeeq Umar and wicketkeeper Zulqarnain 

 Haider landed in jail for getting a speeding ticket and 

 had to spend almost three hours in the lock-up before local 

 organisers came to their rescue, a newspaper reported on 

 Sunday. The three were returning from Dubai on Saturday 

 after shopping. 

The boys had gone out for some shopping and while returning to Abu Dhabi their friend, who was driving, was hauled up for over-speeding by the traffic police, a team official was quoted as saying in the newspaper. 

 Since the police didnt know who they were, 

 all four were taken to a local police station where they 

 spent nearly three hours before being bailed out by local 

 organisers who went to the station accompanied by manager 

 Shafiq Ahmed Paapa and coach Rashid Khan, he said. 

 However, there was good news for the players back 

 home as the Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan 

 announced Rs 1 lakh to each member for their feat in the 

 Eurasia Series. 

Meanwhile, despite its tremendous success, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has said it has no plans to hold another tournament like Eurasia Series in near future owing to an already packed calendar for A sides.

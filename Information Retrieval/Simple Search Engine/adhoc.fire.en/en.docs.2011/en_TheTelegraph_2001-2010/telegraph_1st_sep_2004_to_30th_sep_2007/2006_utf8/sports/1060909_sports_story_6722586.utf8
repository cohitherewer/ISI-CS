 Suvrajit draws with Roktim

Ahmedabad: International Master Lanka Ravi settled for a quick draw with IM R. R. Laxman of Tamil Nadu and continued to lead after the 11th round of the 44th National B Chess Championship at Karnavati Club here. 

Bengals Roktim Bandyopadhya drew with Suvrajit Saha in another match. Both are on 8 points, one point behind leader Ravi. 

With top nine boards taking a quick draw to inch closer to the magical nine points mark which will ensure qualification to the next National A Chess Championship, Ravi became the first to make the grade with another friendly draw that took him to nine points. 

Hyderabad based Ravi remained half point adrift of nearest contender Himanshu Sharma of Haryana who followed suit in the 11th round and shared the point with top seed K. Ratnakaran of Kerala. 

With just two rounds remaining in the 13-rounds event, Ravi and Himanshu are certain to make the grade while a pack of 17 players on 8 points are likely to have it easy in the remaining games as they are just two draws away from making it to the National A. 

However there are two big bunch of players on 7.5 and 7 points who will all need to score one victory in the remaining two rounds. Thats where the action is likely to be in the premier Swiss event of the country in the last two days. 

The day witnessed top twelve games ending in draws despite some fight on tables 10-12. Despite trying for sometime, former national champion P. Konguvel of PSPB could not impress Sashikant Kutwal of Maharashtra in a Sicilian Dragon Defence game and the end result was a draw. 

WGM Eesha Karavade also tried for about two hours against Syed Anwar Shazuli, but a peace treaty was duly signed. (PTI)

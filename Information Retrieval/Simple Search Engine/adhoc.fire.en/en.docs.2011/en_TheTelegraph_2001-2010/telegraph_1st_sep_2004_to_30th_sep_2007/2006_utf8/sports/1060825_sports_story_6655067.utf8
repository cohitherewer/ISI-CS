The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its not an Asia vs Hair battle 

 - No objection to hearing after ODIs, says Shaharyar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Inzamam-ul Haq in 

 Uxbridge on Thursday. Pakistan were to play Middlesex 

 in a one-dayer that was abandoned due to overnight rain 

 Calcutta: There have been 

 conflicting reports, but Shaharyar Khan has told The 

 Telegraph that Pakistan wouldnt mind the rescheduling 

 of Inzamam-ul Haqs disciplinary hearing till immediately 

 after the upcoming ODIs against England provided adjudicator 

 Ranjan Madugalle is available by then.

 The five-match series begins in 

 Cardiff on August 30 and ends in Birmingham on September 

 10. 

 Its a fact that we 

 wanted the process to be completed quickly. However, because 

 of a genuine reason (Madugalles non-availability owing 

 to his sisters illness), we wont have any problem 

 with a postponement till the ODIs conclude, the Pakistan 

 Cricket Board (PCB) chairman informed. 

 Speaking from London on Thursday 

 evening, Shaharyar added: Of course, the situation 

 will change if Madugalle cant conduct the hearing 

 for an indefinite period The position, I suppose, is going 

 to be clear when the International Cricket Council (ICC) 

 lawyers meet with our legal advisors in the next 24 hours.

 [Till rather late, though, a comment 

 couldnt be got from the Colombo-based Madugalle. While 

 his house phone went unanswered, the cell was in voice mail-mode.] 

 Significantly, Shaharyar maintained 

 that the PCB wasnt involving Asia in its fight with 

 controversial umpire Darrell Hair.

 Its between Hair and 

 Pakistan Countries have extended their support, communicated 

 through calls to me, but we arent looking to make 

 it an Asia versus Hair battle, he said.

 The Pakistan captain, it may be 

 recalled, has been charged on two counts: Ball tampering 

 and bringing the game into disrepute at The Oval, on what 

 became the last day of the four-Test series.

 A heavy penalty awaits Inzamam 

 if both charges are upheld by the adjudicator. He can, of 

 course, appeal. 

 Meanwhile, in a related development, 

 the ICC has confirmed chief executive Malcolm Speed is heading 

 for London.

 Mr Speed will have a series 

 of meetings, but specifics havent been finalised, 

 remarked an official, when contacted in Dubai.

 One understands the ICCs 

 in-house lawyer, Urvasi Naidoo, is going to be on the same 

 flight.

 Footnote: Pakistans 

 limited overs match against Middlesex, at Uxbridge, was 

 called off without even a ball being bowled. Heavy 

 overnight rain affected both the wicket and the adjoining 

 areas, explained manager Zaheer Abbas.

 Why Madugalle

 ... Because, by a process of elimination, 

 others get knocked out... Here goes:

 Tier I Match Referees

 (alphabetically)

 Chris Broad: Hes an Englishman and, so, 

 cant be treated as neutral.

 Jeff Crowe: Was on assignment in North America 

 when the controversy erupted. Hence, not available. 

 Ranjan Madugalle: Being the Chief Match Referee, 

 he has the best credentials. Neither Pakistan nor England 

 objected to his appointment.

 Roshan Mahanama: Has recently been promoted 

 to Tier-I. Inexperienced, perhaps, to handle a major issue.

 Mike Procter: Is in the thick of it all. Cant 

 be judge and prosecutor.

 Tier II Match Referees

 (alphabetically)

 Alan Hurst: Hes an Australian and, so, 

 cant be treated as neutral.

 Clive Lloyd: Big on stature, but one of the 

 umpires involved in the controversy is a West Indian 

 Billy Doctrove. So, cant be seen as neutral.

 Jawagal Srinath: The least experienced of them 

 all

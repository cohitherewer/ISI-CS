 Diniz clinches 50km walk in downpour

Gothenburg: Yohan Diniz of France braved a thunderstorm and walked to victory in the gruelling 50km event Thursday at the European Championships. 

The stormy weather, with lightning striking just outside the Ullevi stadium, forced organisers to interrupt several competitions. 

The mens pole vault qualifying was abandoned, with 18 vaulters allowed to compete in the final, instead of the usual 12. 

Diniz covered the 50k course through the citys streets in 3::41:39.00, a personal best and a national record. 

The thunderstorm may have destabilised the others, for me it was a welcome refreshment. Before the race, nobody really had me on the radar screen, I surprised everyone, Diniz said. 

After 30th kilometres, I still felt very strong so I accelerated, Diniz added. 

Diniz was disqualified at last years world championships and changed his technique since then. 

Today I will enjoy a good wine I studied oenology, Diniz said. 

Jesus Angel Garcia of Spain, who won the event in 1993 and silvers in 1997 and 2001, came in second with a time 3:42.48. Yuriy Andronov of Russia took the bronze in 3:43.26. 

In the pole vault, former world champion and Olympic bronze medallist Giuseppe Gibilisco of Italy was among the few vaulters who did not qualify for the final. 

He cleared 5.45m on his second attempt and missed all three at 5.55, before the competition had to be stopped. (AGENCIES)

 Blisters healed, Ronaldo 

trains

Koenigstein: Ronaldo practiced on Tuesday when Brazil resumed their World Cup preparations with a light training session at their camp outside Frankfurt. 

Ronaldo came off at half-time in Brazils 4-0 win over New Zealand on Sunday because of blisters on his feet, and team doctors had said it was possible the striker needed to be rested from some of the teams practices this week to keep the problem from aggravating. 

The blisters have healed... there are no problems anymore. He is free to do whatever everyone else is doing, Brazil doctor Jose Luiz Runco said. 

Runco said Ronaldos blisters may have been caused by a defect in his new cleats ? which are made by Nike. 

Ronaldo, who has scored five goals in Brazils three warm-up matches since arriving in Europe on May 22, participated during the teams entire practice Tuesday morning. 

Meanwhile, Germany are not yet certain that captain Michael Ballack will be fit to play in their opening match of on Friday, although the player himself is confident of lining up against Costa Rica. 

Ballack missed training on Monday but took part in an indoor workout on Tuesday morning and said he expected to back working with the ball in the evening. 

Gianluca Zambrotta, however, will miss Italys opening match against Ghana on Monday after failing to recover from a thigh strain. 

Central defender Alessandro Nesta also faces a race against time to be fit after aggravating an old adductor muscle injury in Fridays 0-0 friendly draw with Ukraine, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) said on its website on Tuesday. 

The FIGC made the announcement after the duo underwent scans in Florence. The squad is scheduled to fly out to their training base in Duisburg on Wednesday.

 AC Milan blame it on referee

Milan: AC Milan blamed referee Markus Merk for their Champions League semi-final defeat by Barcelona. 

The disappointment is, however, likely to increase speculation about the future of Carlo Ancelotti and his men, who must now turn their attention back to challenging for the Italian title. 

Milan were furious when the German referee ruled out a 69th-minute Andriy Shevchenko headed goal during match, seemingly for a push after contact with Barcelona defender Carles Puyol. 

It was absolutely legal. He jumped and hardly touched Puyol, said Ancelotti. Club vice-president Adriano Galliani said: It was a balanced semi-final between two great teams both of whom deserved to win ? too bad everything was decided by a refereeing error. 

Under Ancelotti, Milan have reached three Champions League semis four times, winning the competition in 2003 and losing to Liverpool on penalties in last seasons final. 

Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard said: We accomplished our objective in this match. But this is not the end, we want to go to Paris and win the competition. 

Rijkaards team is determined to match the achievement of Johan Cruyffs dream team when they meet Arsenal in Paris on May 17.

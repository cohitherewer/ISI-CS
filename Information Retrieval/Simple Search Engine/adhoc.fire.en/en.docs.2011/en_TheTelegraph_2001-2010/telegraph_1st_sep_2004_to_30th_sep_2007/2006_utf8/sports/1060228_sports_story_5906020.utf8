London: Top England batsman Marcus Trescothick has reached his home to be with his wife Hayley and 10-month-old daughter Elle. 

The Somerset cricketer had rushed home at very short notice, not even waiting for the end of Englands opening first-class game of their tour on Saturday before leaving the ground in Vadodara in tears. 

The England team management only said that he had left the tour for personal reasons and was expected to return soon. 

Shortly before he left, Trescothick had reportedly received a telephone call from England that had left him deeply affected. 

He flew to Heathrow before driving straight to his home in Taunton on Sunday morning. Then with his wife and baby, Trescothick visited his parents-in-law, who also live in Taunton. 

It is a bit worrying to lose Trescothick, England coach Duncan Fletcher had said earlier. He is a world class opener. To lose someone like that is a big blow to us. 

He is experienced and played well the last time (in India), he said. (PTI)

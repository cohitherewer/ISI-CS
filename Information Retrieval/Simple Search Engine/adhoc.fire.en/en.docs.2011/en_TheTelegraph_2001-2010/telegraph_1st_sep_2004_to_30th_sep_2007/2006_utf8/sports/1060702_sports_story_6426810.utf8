 This team has an incredible character and spirit: Lippi

Hamburg: Italy coach Marcello Lippi was full of praise on Friday for another strong defensive effort after his team had their fourth clean sheet in five matches. 

Whats special about this defence is that we have champions, all first class, Lippi said after a 3-0 win against Ukraine that put his team into Tuesdays World Cup semi-final against hosts Germany. 

Italys only blemish was an own-goal in the group stage against the United States in a 1-1 draw. 

After lauding his goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and defenders by name, Lippi singled out Andrea Barzagli for special praise. 

Look at this man Barzagli. Did you see how he played with such great authority? This was the first time he played a full match here. Because hes playing next to champions he plays liked a champion. Theyre always looking to help each other. 

Lippi said Italy have no fear of Germany and made it clear the aim is a fourth World Cup victory. 

Nothing is impossible, he said.Everything is possible....Anything can happen. 

I am extremely proud because this team has an incredible character and spirit, they have coped so well with a lot of injuries and changes to the team, said Lippi. 

Im delighted with the goals, said striker Luca Toni after scoring twice after the break. I really needed to get on the scoresheet. I was just about the only striker in the team who hadnt scored yet, he said. 

The first goal was one of the most important goals of my career. You dont get many chances to score at a World Cup and you never know whether youll be competing at the next one, he said. 

Midfielder Gennaro Gattuso, Man of the Match, said he was glad to hear Lippis praise but added it did not matter. 

Its nice but it slips off like water off a ducks back, he said. We have a goal ahead of us. We have a long way to go. 

There were no excuses from Ukraine coach Oleg Blokhin despite seeing his side go close on several occasions after the break when the score was still 1-0. 

Theres no such thing as good or bad luck here. The Italians have a great team and they dont forgive mistakes, he said. On the whole our team deserves great praise. 

Ukraine captain Andriy Shevchenko also praised Italy. 

The Italians played very intelligently with a great defence, which was their big advantage, he said. 

Shevchenko said his side lacked a playmaker like former AC Milan teammate Andrea Pirlo. 

We dont have someone in the team like (Italy midfielder) Pirlo ? it is a great disadvantage for the team. The team can only play with the possibilities they have, Shevchenko said. 

Pirlo and Shevchenko were a key combination for AC Milan before the Ukrainians recent ? 30m move to Chelsea. 

Shevchenko agreed that there had been some class missing from the side but said he was proud to be part of it. 

Im so happy to play with these lads in this team, the striker said.Ukraine gave a good account of themselves at the World Cup. 

With Ukraine eliminated, Shevchenko -- who won many hearts during his time in Milan -- had no doubts about who he would be supporting to win the World Cup. 

Im rooting for Italy now, he said. 

Meanwhile, if Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro keeps playing this well, he could be making his 100th international appearance in the most special game of all. 

Cannavaro, who made his 98th appearance on Friday, would win his 100th cap in the July 9 final if Italy keep on winning. 

The build up to Germany 2006 has been far from ideal for Cannavaro, with his club Juventus at the centre of a soccer corruption scandal. Cannavaro has had to read accusations that he was ordered to play poorly in the build up to his transfer from Inter to Juventus two years ago. 

Some critics said before the World Cup that he should resign as captain because of his alleged involvement. That really hurt me and made me think a lot. Ive always had great values in soccer and my daily life, Cannavaro said. To hear your reputation being discussed like that really bothered me. The only way I can make people understand who I am is by showing them on the field, and fortunately thats where I perform best. 

Gianluca Zambrotta left Italys camp three days ago to visit a former teammate in an Italian hospital. 

On Friday, Zambrotta sent another message to Gianluca Pessotto ? a goal six minutes into Italys 3-0 win over Ukraine to take the lead. 

Tonight our strength came from Gianluca, who we hope is able to come back from what hes gone through, Zambrotta said after the match on Friday. 

Pessotto was in a drug-induced coma when Zambrotta scored. After the match, Italys players unfurled an Italian tricolor with the inscription Pessotto we are with you.

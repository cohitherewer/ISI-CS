 Zaheers new role 

Karachi: Former Pakistan Test captain Zaheer Abbas will feature on an Indian television channel as an expert commentating during the Champions Trophy. 

Zaheer, who was recently removed as Pakistan team manager after an eventful tour of England, will present his view on the Zee television. 

Its always nice to be working in India and commenting on a game one loves so much. I will be roaming around at the match venues for the tournament main rounds, he said. 

Zaheer said he was hurt and shocked on being sacked as manager by the Pakistan Cricket Board two days after returning from England. 

At first, I tried to take it graciously but later on, felt that people should know the circumstances prevailing during The Oval Test. 

The only thing a manager can do is that he can advise the players as a big brother. The rest is up to the players. I had told Inzamam-ul Haq to continue playing in Test, he didnt listen (to me).

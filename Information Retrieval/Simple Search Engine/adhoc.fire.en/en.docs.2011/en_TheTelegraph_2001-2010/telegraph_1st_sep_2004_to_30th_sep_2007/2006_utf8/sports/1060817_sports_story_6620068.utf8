 Bad start for Hari

 MAINZ CHESS 

 Anand will face 

 Radjabov in an eight-game tie on Thursday 

 Mainz: Former world junior 

 champion P. Harikrishna stumbled at the first hurdle against 

 Grandmaster Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany in the Cleric Medical 

 Chess 960 junior championship, played here as a part of 

 the Mainz Classic tournament.

 The Indian lost three and drew 

 one in the first four rounds of his eight-game clash with 

 the German, while his senior Viswanathan Anand whipped up 

 a 35-5 score against 40 opponents in a simultaneous display 

 in the main section of the tournament.

 GM Vlastimil Hort of Germany took 

 early lead against GM Lajos Portisch of Hungary in the seniors 

 match, while it the eves tie between Alexandra Kostenuik 

 of Russia and German Elizabeth Paehtz was tied 2-2.

 Chess 960, in which the positions 

 of the pieces are randomly changed before the start of the 

 game, certainly did not suit Harikrishna even as he can 

 draw some solace in that he had better positions in two 

 of the four games on the opening day.

 However, as it turned out, Harikrishna 

 ended up on the losing side in the first two games, giving 

 his opponent vital lead in the eight-game tie. A draw in 

 the third was followed by another loss.

 Unless there is a major turnaround 

 in the form and fortune of the Hyderabad-based player, this 

 tie is as good as over as Naiditsch just needs one point 

 in the remaining four games to become the first chess 960 

 junior champion of the world.

 Anand started his campaign here 

 with a crafty display in the simultaneous exhibition scoring 

 35 points against 40 players.

 The Indian ace had it easy against 

 most of his opponents including the mayor of Mainz but was 

 held by Finnish rock star Burton.

 Peter Backhaus was the lucky 

 one to beat the Indian superstar. For the records, 

 Anand won 31 games, drew eight and lost one.

 From Thursday, Anand will face 

 GM Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan in an eight-game rapid 

 tie. The Indian will be looking for his sixth straight title.

 Among the seniors, legends Vlastimil 

 Hort and Lajos Portisch played some interesting games.

 Hort was the winner of the first 

 and fourth game while Portisch won the third game with one 

 ending in a draw.

 Amongst the ladies, Kosteniuk 

 drew the first blood winning the first game against Paehtz 

 but the German fought back to equalise in the third game 

 after the second ended in a truce. 

 The fourth game also ended in 

 a draw leaving the scores tied.

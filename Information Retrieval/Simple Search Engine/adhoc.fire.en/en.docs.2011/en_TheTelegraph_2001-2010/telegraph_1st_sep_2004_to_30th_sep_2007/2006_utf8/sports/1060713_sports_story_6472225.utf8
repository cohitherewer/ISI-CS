The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Monsoon season from Friday 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The stake money for the monsoon season, begining from Friday, is going to be almost the same compared to the last wet season. RCTC plans to spend all its reserves during the winter season when it hosts the Invitational races. Nevertheless, nearly 250 horses will be seen in action during the 15 day season and the stakes offered are in excess of Rs 1.26 crore.

 The later-half of Fridays race card looks quite competitive. The Zipper Cup, which is 12-horse strong, also includes Aptitude who is working well.

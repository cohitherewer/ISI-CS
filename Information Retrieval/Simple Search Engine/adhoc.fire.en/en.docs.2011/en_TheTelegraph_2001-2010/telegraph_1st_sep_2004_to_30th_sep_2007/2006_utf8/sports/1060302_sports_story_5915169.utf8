 Ashley Giles unlikely for ODIs too 

London: England spinner Ashley Giles, who could not make it to the Test squad for the ongoing series against India due to an injury, is unlikely to play in the one-day matches as well. 

Giles, who underwent a hip surgery last year, admitted his recovery was hampered by trying to rush back from the surgery and make the trip to India. 

Theres still a chance I could make it for the one-dayers but its going to be incredibly tight, he said. 

As you try to drive to get on the plane you actually send it backwards. We were pushing a touch too early, he was quoted as saying in a BBC programme. 

Giles was in line to make it for the three-Test tour, but was replaced at the last minute by Ian Blackwell. 

There was probably a bit more going on in (the hip) when they did the operation than theyd originally thought, he said. 

But they did say three months minimum all the way along. It was always very tight for getting on the plane to India. Everything would have had to go ahead of schedule and swimmingly. 

However, Giles was confident he would be fit in time for the visit of Sri Lanka in May.

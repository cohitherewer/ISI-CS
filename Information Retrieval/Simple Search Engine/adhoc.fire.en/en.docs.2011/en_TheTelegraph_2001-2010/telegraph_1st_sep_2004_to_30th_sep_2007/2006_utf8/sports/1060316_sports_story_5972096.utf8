The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi has challenged Formula One champion Fernando Alonso to a high-speed duel to see who is quickest.

 The Renault driver said last month he was unimpressed by Rossi?s Formula One tests for Ferrari. ?He might finish fifth or even get on the podium but I could do the same on the bikes if I was given enough time to practise,? the Spaniard said.

 Rossi said on Wednesday: ?I read that if Alonso is able to make some practice then he can put a MotoGP bike on the podium with me. Well, I think we should drive a Formula One car, a World Rally car and a MotoGP bike, add the times together and then we will see who is the fastest.? 

 Berlin: A second match-rigging scandal in German soccer less than three months before the World Cup could be more serious than the initial investigation suggested.

 Prosecutors in Munich were investigating media reports that several Bundesliga players, among them a German international, had been in contact with a betting ring. Four people were arrested last week after an investigation by Frankfurt prosecutors into alleged match-rigging in the second division and regional league. 

 Rome: At least three Middlesbrough supporters were stabbed during clashes with rival fans in Rome, British police said on Wednesday, blaming the violence on organised gangs of locals.

 The trouble flared late on Tuesday in Campo de? Fiori, a popular square for late-night revellers in central Rome, where some 200 Middlesbrough fans were drinking ahead of the Uefa Cup game against AS Roma. 

 New York: Hasim ?The Rock? Rahman makes the first defence of his second reign as World Boxing Council heavyweight champion against fellow-American James Toney on Saturday in a bout pitting power against skills.

 as the former world champion in three other weight classes 

 has vowed.

 Dalmiya asked to reply to BCCI queries

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: The Calcutta high court on Thursday passed an order asking former BCCI president Jagmohan Dalmiya, to reply to the questionnaire issued by the present committee of the BCCI about the Pilcom account by October 3, 2006. 

Justice P. K. Dev, in his order, also said that the BCCI would have the liberty to call Dalmiya before its discliplinary committee after days of filing the reply. 

The judge also said that Dalmiya, in his reply, could mention that he could not reply since the documents issued to him were not legible. 

The order followed an appeal by Dalmiya against the order passed by the chief judge of city civil court, P. K. Sarkar, who also refused to accept his prayer seeking the BCCI to give him legible documents. 

The present committee of the board had brought an allegation against Dalmiya, saying that he had misappropriated Pilcom funds during his tenure and asked him to appear before its disciplinary committee. 

S. K. Kapoor and Sanjib Bachwat appeared for Dalmiya, while BCCI was defended by Mintu Sen.

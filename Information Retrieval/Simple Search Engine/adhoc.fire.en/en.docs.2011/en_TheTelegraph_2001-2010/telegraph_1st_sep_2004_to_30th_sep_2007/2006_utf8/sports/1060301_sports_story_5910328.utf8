OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Caught in their own web, All India Football Federation on Tuesday postponed the Fransa-Air India National Football League match scheduled for March 2. 

The fate of the match will now be decided by the AIFF executive committee meeting on March 8, according to general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

It may be recalled that Fransa did not turn up when the match was first scheduled on February 3. Later, Air India refused to play when the AIFF fixed the match for March 2. 

Meanwhile, India have decided to send a second string outfit for the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup to be played Dhaka in April.

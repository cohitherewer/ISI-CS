 Pauleta gives Portugal full points

Cologne: Portugal had a harder time than expected against World Cup newcomer Angola. 

The Portuguese were still happy to come away with a 1-0 win on Sunday in their opening Group D match. 

Portugal failed to impress for most of the match, however, and by the end the team was listening to the jeers of a crowd frustrated by their sluggish play. 

 Pauleta scored his record 47th goal for Portugal in the fourth minute, tapping in after captain Luis Figo sliced through the Angolan defence and drew out the goalkeeper. 

 The Portuguese extended their unbeaten run to 16 games over the past 16 months but will regret failing to score more against a lower-ranked team.

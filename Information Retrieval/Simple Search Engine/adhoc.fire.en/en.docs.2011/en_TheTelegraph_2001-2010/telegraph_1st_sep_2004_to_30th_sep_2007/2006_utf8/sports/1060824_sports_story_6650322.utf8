The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sasikiran: In the next five years we should be a superpower 

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 - Eight Grandmasters speak on the Indian scenario 

BIPIN SHENOY

 Calcutta: It is a rare privilege for the city. Eight Grandmasters of the country have converged here for the PSPB inter-unit chess tournament. The Telegraph took the opportunity to talk to GMs Krishnan Sasikiran, Koneru Humpy, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, Abhijit Kunte, Sandipan Chanda, Neelotpal Das, R. B. Ramesh and Deepan Chakravarthy. 

 The following is what the GMs 

 had to say (in alphabetical order)

 With Anand winning his ninth 

 title this year and other Indian Grandmasters improving, 

 do you think India has a good chance of emerging as a chess 

 superpower, despite our poor showing in the Olympiad?

 Of course, India will be a super 

 power in chess. Already India is a major power. The Olympiad 

 was just one bad result and it can happen to anyone. 

 Chanda: The future is looking very bright! 

 One bad result in the Olympiad can can happen to any team. 

 We have a host of young talented players who will do well 

 in the future. 

 Das: Obviously, we will improve and be near 

 the top by the next Olympiad. 

 Ganguly: Definitely we can reach the top. Anand 

 is in excellent form and is an inspiration to the rest. 

 Most of the other players are young and have a bright future. 

 Regarding the Olympiad, it was sheer bad luck that all of 

 us were out of form and played well below our potential. 

 But all that is in the past now and we are looking forward 

 to the future. 

 Humpy: We are a strong team notwithstanding 

 our poor Olympiad performance. By the next Olympiad, we 

 should be close to the top. One of the main reasons for 

 our poor showing in the Olympiad was lack of proper facility. 

 We had to stay in an apartment and the quality of food was 

 also poor. I may sound like a bad loser, but it really counts 

 to have proper playing and staying conditions. 

 Kunte: Not before 2010! What Russia did in 

 50 years we cannot do in 10. We have the capacity but we 

 should not expect results overnight. 

 Ramesh: I think we already are a strong team! 

 The Olympiad fiasco was a wake up call for us. It doesnt 

 matter whether you do badly in 1 tournament. In the next 

 3 to 4 years we will be near the top. 

 Sasikiran: We already have a good team. We 

 need to have more players above 2600. It will still take 

 some more time. In the next five years or so we should be 

 at the top. 

 What do think of the new 

 National A format of 13-round Swiss League? With a number 

 of strong contenders for the top six slot, do you think 

 it will throw up the best players considering the fact that 

 there is an element of luck in Swiss tournaments? 

 Chakravarthy: It is interesting! I think it 

 would be better to answer this question after playing the 

 A. 

 Chanda: The earlier format was big and tiring 

 and we had to play two rounds on many days. Only time will 

 show whether this is a good system. 

 Das: I think its a change for the better 

 as the earlier format was very tiring. Finally, in a 13-round 

 Swiss, the best will be at the top. 

 Ganguly: The luck factor is certainly there. 

 But 13 rounds will throw up the best players. Apart from 

 that, nearly 30 players will qualify from the National B, 

 so more players will have an opportunity to play with the 

 best. 

 Humpy: The old round-robin format was tiring. 

 Its better to have a Swiss format. From the spectators 

 point as well, it will be interesting as the games will 

 be well fought. 

 Kunte: It was the need of the hour. Two hundred 

 and fifty players were playing in the B and 

 there were only 12 qualifiers. I think there should be a 

 3-tier system with the top ten from the A playing 

 a super league. 

 Ramesh: It gives chance to more players and 

 is less tedious. The earlier format, because of too many 

 rounds, produced some poor quality games. 

 Sasikiran: I dont think the Swiss is 

 a good format for choosing the best players. A 3-tier system 

 may be a good idea. 

 With Parimarjan Negi becoming 

 the second-youngest GM and a number of youngsters taking 

 up the game early in India, do you think India can have 

 a GM at the age of 12 or even earlier? 

 Chakravarthy: Very unlikely that someone can 

 be a GM before 12. 

 Chanda: Maybe someone can be a GM at 12. But, 

 below that, its impossible. Maybe with proper training 

 and hard work we can break the barrier. 

 Das: Difficult to say. 

 Maybe at 12, but never at 8 or 9. Players need to have a 

 minimum maturity. 

 Ganguly: I think its doubtful. Negi is 

 an exception. He is very talented and hard working. He was 

 fortunate to have been coached by a GM from his childhood 

 and that made a big difference. But then, Negis performance 

 will surely inspire more youngsters to break that barrier. 

 Humpy: Its possible, but you need to 

 have good coaching and good corporate support from an early 

 age. Negi was fortunate not only to have support but to 

 have been coached by GMs from an early age. I think 

 if our senior GMs like Dibyendu Barua and Pavin Thipsay 

 take up coaching, we will have more players coming up. 

 Kunte: It does not matter. What is more important 

 is how you fare in the future. 

 Ramesh: Not in the next five years. Maybe with 

 Indian GMs taking up coaching, it will become possible. 

 Sasikiran: It depends on when children start 

 playing. Maybe its possible if they start at three 

 or four. But you need to work really hard. Negi is both 

 talented and hard working. 

 With increasing use of computers 

 in preparation, dont you think that the game is becoming 

 more mechanical? Do you think Fisher Random chess is a good 

 alternative? (Fischer Random is a variant of Orthodox chess 

 suggested by Bobby Fischer, former world champion where 

 the initial set up of pieces is chosen randomly.) 

 Chakravarthy: You have to use it to your advantage 

 and there lies the charm of the game. 

 Chanda: So far the game is still very enjoyable. 

 From the spectators point of view may be it is less 

 enjoyable but the game is getting more and more perfect. 

 Das: It is still interesting as we have not 

 yet exhausted all the possibilities. After Kasparov retired, 

 Topalav has taken the game to new heights. 

 Ganguly: The game is still very interesting. 

 With computers you have to work even harder to beat weak 

 players. 

 Humpy: Its true, but the quality of the 

 game is getting better. Fischer Random is interesting. Maybe 

 CPAI should organise one such tournament. 

 Kunte: The game is still very interesting. 

 But you have keep working and preparing, otherwise you will 

 be caught napping. 

 Ramesh: The game is becoming more complex but 

 it is still a long way from becoming dull. It can happen 

 only when the computer can solve all the opening problems. 

 Sasikiran: I think the game is gaining charm, 

 not losing it. With computers you have to do your homework 

 well. Fisher Random is interesting. I have played a couple 

 of random tournaments and the results were not bad. 

 Do you think that the Chess 

 Players Association of India (CPAI) has brought about 

 a radical change in Indian chess, considering the fact the 

 AICF is now listening more to the players and effecting 

 changes only after taking the players views into consideration? 

 Chakravarthy: Of course. We now have a body 

 of players which will support us in many ways. 

 Chanda: Of course. We now have a platform to 

 give our views. 

 Das: I wouldnt call it a radical change 

 but the situation is much better now. 

 Ganguly: Definitely after the formation of 

 CPAI, the Indian chess scene has seen remarkable changes. 

 We can now voice our opinions and give our views. 

 Humpy: Yes, the CPAI can help the players when 

 they are in difficulty, because the players are united now. 

 Kunte: I really dont know. But the top 

 players are united and thats important. 

 Ramesh: I think the chess scenario is much 

 better now. 

 Sasikiran: I cant really say. 

 What advice would you give 

 to budding chess players ? 

 Chakravarthy: Keep cool and concentrate on 

 your goals. Work hard. 

 Chanda: Must believe in yourself. Ambition 

 should not be limited to becoming a GM. 

 Das: Enjoy your chess. Aim for the top and 

 work hard. 

 Ganguly: Love chess, work hard and believe 

 in yourself. 

 Humpy: Children should have an interest in 

 the game. They should concentrate on their goals. 

 Kunte: Work hard and keep on working hard. 

 Ramesh: They should play lot of tournaments, 

 specially abroad. They should work hard. 

 Sasikiran: Analyse your own games and work 

 hard.

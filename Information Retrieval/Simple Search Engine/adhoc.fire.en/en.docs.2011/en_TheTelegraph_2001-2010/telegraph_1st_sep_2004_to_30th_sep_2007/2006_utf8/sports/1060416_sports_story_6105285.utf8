The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Another notice on Dalmiya

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dalmiya

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiyas woes are far from over. On Saturday, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) slapped another showcause notice on the former president, asking him to explain some abnormally high expenses with regard to the 1996 World Cup. 

The action was taken on the basis of the report submitted by our treasurer (N. Srinivasan) before the working committee meeting in Mumbai. 

The report has stated some expensive vouchers concerning a lot of things such as telephone bills and travels in connection with the 1996 World Cup, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

We have faxed and e-mailed the notice to him and Mr Dalmiya has been asked to explain within 21 days those expenses from the Pilcom (Pakistan, India, Lanka Committee) accounts at the Indian Overseas Bank in Calcutta, he added. 

A source close to Dalmiya, however, said hes yet to get the notice. 

His office has remained closed for two days (Friday and Saturday). Maybe the BCCI letter is lying over there, but we will only get it on Monday. So I cant comment anything at this point of time, he said.

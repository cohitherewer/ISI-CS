 Code of Ethics comes into being

 - Objective is to safeguard AIFFs image 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The new Code of Ethics, which was approved by the executive committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Wednesday here, has very little to restrict the current war of words between Bhaichung Bhutia and Syed Nayeemuddin, but holds the right to probe the income of a person connected with the AIFF, state associations or clubs. 

The purpose of the Code of Ethics, AIFF declared, is to safeguard AIFFs image and pursuit of objectives against the unethical actions of officials. 

The 10-point Code of Ethics seems to be more concerned about members accepting gifts, bribes and payment for mediation. In the seventh point, under the sub-heading Bribery, it says that persons bound by this Code shall not accept bribes through the offer, promise or acceptance of a gift or any other benefit in return for violating their duties in the interest of third party. 

All persons bound by this Code shall neither bribe third parties nor encourage or incite third parties to attempt to bribe others to further their own interest or those of third parties. 

As if this is not enough, it also encourages members to keep an eye and report on anyone else in the fraternity involved in unethical practices. In the 10th point (Duty of disclosure and reporting), the Code of Ethics says: Person bound by this Code shall report any unethical incidents involving others who are also bound by this Code to the Committee for Ethics and Fair Play if an investigation has not otherwise been initiated. 

In accordance with paragraph VII, when required to do so, all implicated persons shall declare details of their income to AIFF and provide relevant documents for inspection. 

The Code of Ethics also says that any person found to be in breach of this code shall be subject to sanctions. In that case, the Committee for Ethics and Fair Play has also been empowered to recommend the sanction to be imposed. 

Reacting to the newly imposed codes, a senior member of the AIFF later said: Its too weak and hypothetical. 

It doesnt have the required strength to pin down offenders. Perhaps a few more subsidiary clauses are needed to make it more worthwhile.

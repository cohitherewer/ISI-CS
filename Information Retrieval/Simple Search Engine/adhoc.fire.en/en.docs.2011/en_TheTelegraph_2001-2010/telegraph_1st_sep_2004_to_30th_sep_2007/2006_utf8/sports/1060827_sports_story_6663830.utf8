Akron (US): A disastrous back nine of six-over 41 saw Shiv Kapurs hopes of a good finish recede in the star-studded $7.5 million World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational golf tournament. 

Firestone specialist Tiger Woods took charge in the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational second round on Friday, despite running up a remarkable bogey-five on his final hole. 

Woods, champion here four times in his last seven starts, struck the clubhouse roof with his approach to the par-four ninth and was fortunate to get a free drop before completing a six-under-par 64. 

That left him at nine-under 131, one stroke clear of fellow American Davis Love III (65) and ideally positioned to win his fourth consecutive PGA Tour title. 

The 24-year-old Kapur, who qualified for the event after winning the Volvo Masters of Asia last December, had just one birdie on the second and then four bogeys on 10th, 11th, 13th and 14th and went on to double bogey the 16th for a terrible round on Friday. 

His total of seven-over 147 for two days placed him 61st in a field of 78 players. There is no cut and all players are assured prize money. 

Woods swept past overnight leader Adam Scott with four birdies in his first four holes and picked up three more shots after the turn before dropping his only shot of the round at Firestone Country Club. 

Scott, two ahead at the start of the day, produced an erratic display before bogeying two of the last three holes for a 71 and a tie for third at six under with American Jim Furyk (65). 

I thought for sure that the ball must be out-of-bounds but it wasnt, Woods told reporters after his nine-iron approach landed on a cart path 20 yards behind the ninth green before bouncing onto and over the clubhouse roof. 

Rules officials deliberated for more than half an hour before learning that a youngster had pocketed Woods ball after finding it in the service area behind the clubhouse. 

With the clubhouse not deemed out-of-bounds and the grandstands in front a temporary immovable obstruction, Woods was able to take a free drop 84 yards from the hole, close to the first tee. 

If I had to re-drop from where I hit my second shot, it would have been a tough six (to make), the world number one added. So it was a huge break to get out of there with a five. 

Woods had missed the ninth fairway to the right off the tee and, with 167 yards to the hole, struck his second shot 212 yards in the air. 

Overall, though, he was delighted with his second-round performance. 

I hit it really well starting out and made some putts, he said. I did some great work last night on the range and really controlled my flight today. 

I basically hit it well all day but didnt make any putts in the middle of the round, kept lipping them out. 

 Woods, whose winning streak includes 

 last months British Open and the PGA Championship 

 at Medinah last week, made a red-hot start on a sun-drenched 

 morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont see Yuvi playing first match: Greg

 - He has had to rest, but a viral does take some days to go away... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

 Kuala Lumpur: 

 Top gun Yuvraj Singh, who is recovering from viral fever 

 and the after effects of medication which triggered an allergic 

 reaction, will join Team India on Wednesday. However, hes 

 out of our tri-series opener, against the West Indies, on 

 Thursday.

 Yuvi is expected on Wednesday, 

 but I dont see him playing the first match, 

 coach Greg Chappell told The Telegraph. 

 Speaking on Monday evening, he added: He has had to 

 rest, but a viral does take some days to go away... 

Captain Rahul Dravid, though, chose to play it somewhat safer. Talking at the team hotel (the recently opened Traders, just off the Twin Towers), he said: Its very unlikely that Yuvraj is going to be in a position to play our opener... After that, well have to see... 

 Match No. 2 for India is against world champions Australia, on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Chappell felt too much ought not to be read into Australias four-and-half month break. Look, all teams have had it... That one had a longer break isnt a factor... All are looking at this tri-series as a preparation for the Champions Trophy... 

 Absolutely, which is why tactics are going to be followed 

 (and analysed) more minutely. Pity that owing to ground 

 realities, no more than 5,000-odd will be able to watch 

 them live.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England never looked winners

 - Hot-tempered Rooney taught a lesson

 On Target 

 Shyam Thapa

The penalty shootout brought about 

 Englands downfall yet again. Portugal, under Scolari, 

 had ousted them from the 2004 European Championship at the 

 same stage and in the same fashion. 

 Following a 0-0 result after 120 

 tense minutes, Portugal edged past England 3-1 in the shootout. 

 Simao Sabrosa, Helder Postiga and Cristiano Ronaldo converted 

 their kicks. Only Owen Hargreaves scored for England as 

 Portuguese keeper Ricardo saved shots from Frank Lampard, 

 Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher.

 Both teams started in the 4-5-1 

 formation and so the obvious aim was to win the midfield 

 from the word go. This is basically a safe tactic in which 

 teams depend on counter-attacks and hope two players come 

 up from the midfield to initiate link-up play with the lone 

 striker.

 In Englands case, Rooney 

 was found to be the lonely striker while, at the 

 other end, Pauleta was the solitary rover up front with 

 Cristiano Ronaldo moving up from the deep.

 Both midfields were pro-active, 

 resulting in an exciting, end-to-end game. The start was 

 free-flowing with Rooney hurrying a shot and Tiago failing 

 to control the ball inside the six-yard box at the other 

 end. Then, Lampard couldnt get to the ball following 

 a Gerrard cross. The Portuguese riposte came with Figo curling 

 a shot just wide. 

 The first half was played in good 

 spirits. But Argentine referee Horacio Elizondo intervened 

 after change of ends and spoiled what was promising to be 

 a delightful duel.

 In the 62nd minute, Rooney stamped 

 his feet on Portugal central defender Carvalho and then 

 pushed Cristiano Ronaldo. It was a bookable offence, but 

 sending him off was a bit harsh. 

 No doubt, football is a game full 

 of power and passion, agility and aggression. But that was 

 the last thing England anticipated as they were already 

 playing without captain David Beckham, who was taken off 

 in the 52nd minute following a leg injury. 

 Stars are not born at club level, 

 but on the World Cup stage. Somebody should teach Rooney 

 the simple lesson that you may be hot-tempered, but must 

 keep your cool. The one who everybody looked up to as Englands 

 saviour had no business leaving his team and millions of 

 fans crying for his own folly.

 Eriksson cast his last dice by 

 bringing Peter Crouch in place of Joe Cole, but he is no 

 substitute for Rooney. Dont England have a better 

 striker? 

 It was also beyond me why Scolari 

 let Ronaldo play on the right and not as a genuine striker 

 inside the box, when his team enjoyed the one-man advantage. 

 England fought brilliantly, no doubt, and can claim moral 

 victory. But the bottomline is, they will be going home.

 Portugal, on the other hand, should 

 have finished the match much earlier after Rooneys 

 exit.

 Decos service was missed, 

 especially his searing runs and ball distribution.

 Atwal equals US PGA Tour record 

San Diego: Arjun Atwal tied the US PGA Tour record of three eagles in a round, when he landed three of them in a space of five holes in the second round of the Buick Invitational. 

Atwal began his round at the easier North Course of Torrey Pines on No. 10, and posted eagles on the par-5 14th hole, the par-4 16th hole and the par-5 18th hole. He went on to shoot a 5-under 67 to be seven-under and within five shots of the leader Brandt Jobe. 

Atwal is tied fifth in a bunch of seven players that also includes his friend Daniel Chopra, Sergio Garcia and Shigeyuki Maruyama. 

Just as Atwal went on an eagle spree, Chopra went on a birdie spree and made good use of the scoring opportunity at the North Course with a six-under 66 and was at seven-under for 36 holes. Chopra had a one-under 71 on the first day. The final two days will include defending champion Tiger Woods. (PTI)

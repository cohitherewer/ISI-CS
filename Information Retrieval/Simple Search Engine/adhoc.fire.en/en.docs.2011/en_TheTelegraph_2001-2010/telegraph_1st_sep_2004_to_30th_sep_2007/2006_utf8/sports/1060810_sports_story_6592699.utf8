 Linford Christie slams system

Gothenburg: Former Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie said on Wednesday the three strike rule for missing drugs tests was penalising the innocent and not catching the guilty. 

UK Athletics withdrew Commonwealth 400m gold medallist Christine Ohuruogu on the eve of the European championships for missing three out-of-competition drugs tests in the past 18 months. 

What were doing there, were not catching the guilty, we are penalising the innocent. Christie told reporters. 

I think the system was set up to protect the innocent and its not doing that and that is the only fault I have with it. Christines only guilt is that shes naive. 

The rule, introduced by the IAAF last year, says athletes have to declare where they will be available for testing for one hour, five days a week.

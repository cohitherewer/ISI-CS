The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vengsarkar for bouncy pitches 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Dilip Vengsarkar feels that the dearth of hard and bouncy tracks is the reason for the country not producing quality opening batsmen, spinners and fast bowlers. It is important to have fast and bouncy wickets to improve the standards, Vengsarkar said on the sidelines of the Duleep Trophy final at the Eden on Wednesday. 

According to him he had sent several reports to the BCCI, during his stint as the chairman of Talent Research Development Wing, stressing the need for such tracks in domestic tournaments. The quality of a player can only be assessed on wickets which have bounce, he said. 

Vengsarkar emphasised on the involvement of the international players in the domestic arena not only in India but also in the entire world and he feels that ICC should step in and oversee the matter meticulously. 

During our days, we had time for domestic tournaments. But now, the international schedule is so choc-a-bloc that top players cannot take part in domestic tournaments. This is true not only for India but for players all over the world. 

On the 2007 World Cup, Vengsarkar said the long-term perspective was not being compromised by putting the entire focus on the mega event. The World Cup is too big a tournament. And the upcoming one-dayers too are important in our preparation for the big event. 

Vengsarkar said that India needed to put greater stress on the under-19 and A teams as part of a long-term perspective. 

The chief selector doesnt believe in prioritising between Tests and one-dayers. My only priority is to win every game. (PTI)

 Jhanu betters world mark

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Selection Trials

 Jamshedpur: Jharkhand archer 

 Jhanu Hansda on Saturday bettered the world record score 

 of Jamie Van Natta of the US in the compound section by 

 scoring 1405 at the final selection trials for the national 

 squad at the JRD Tata Sports Complex here. Jamie had set 

 a mark of 1402. However, this will not be acknowledged as 

 a world record since this is not an officially sanctioned 

 tournament. 

 Jharkhand Archery Association 

 (JAA) secretary Sanjeeva Singh though told The Telegraph, 

 We would write to the Federation International Target 

 Archery (FITA) about the feat for formal recognition. As 

 this particular selection trial is of national level for 

 selecting the Indian team for the World Cup, they should 

 acknowledge the feat, said Singh. 

 Jhanu not only bettered the overall 

 record, but also scored points very close to the world records 

 in the individual distance section as well.

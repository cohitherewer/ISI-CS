 Shiv draws praise for par-72 first round

 - I thought I played better than my score 

Hoylake: Indias Shiv Kapur drew rich praise a day after shooting a creditable par-72 in his maiden major appearance at the British Open. 

Shiv had at least three make-able birdie putts on the eighth, 12th and 15th but the rub of the green was not with him. But he did hole superb birdies on the 16th and 18th to get back to even par. 

Louis Martin, the chief executive of the Asian Tour, who was following Shivs progress, said: It was a fine debut for both Kapur and Thaworn (Wiratchant). Kapur is very young and to show such calm temperament on his first appearance is a very good sign. He should make the cut and that will be a big boost for him. 

Martin said he was also impressed with Shivs shot-making. On some of the holes, he showed excellent shot-making. And he holed some crucial putts to save pars. 

Shiv said he played better than his score shows. If youd given me par at the start of the day, I would have taken that, but I thought I played better than my score. 

Shiv had a courageous birdie at his last hole with a fine chip from the rough that landed six feet from the pin and he duly converted that. 

On the back nine, I hit really well but I missed about three realistic opportunities which I should have made. It was tough getting the ball close and overall, I just hung in there. 

Shiv, winner of the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok last December, is only the fourth Indian to play at the British Open. 

One of the spectators, a Deborah Bradley said: He showed a lot of confidence for someone playing his first major. He handled himself very well and that should augur well for future. 

Twelve-year-old Oliver, who has been following Shiv through practice and also the first round, said: Hes a real nice guy. He spoke a lot with me while practising and after the first round gave me a golf ball. 

Also coming in for praise was the Asian Tour contingent, which did well to get itself noticed. Shiv, Andrew Buckle, a last-minute entrant when Trevor Immelman pulled out, and K.J. Choi shot identical rounds of 72, while Thai Wiratchant shot a one-under 71. (PTI)

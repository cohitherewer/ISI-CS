 Matthew Hayden fails to make cut

Sydney: Experienced fast bowler Glenn McGrath has been included in the Australian squad for the Champions Trophy in India, but there is no place for Matthew Hayden. 

McGrath will make his comeback to international cricket in the tri-series in Malaysia this month before moving on to India for the Champions Trophy in October-November. 

The lanky paceman has not played for his country since January, when he voluntarily stepped down after learning his wife Jane had been diagnosed with cancer. 

Following extensive discussion between Glenn McGrath, the coach and the selection group, weve decided that the best way for Glenn to make his way back into international cricket is to play international cricket, chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement on Monday. 

We believe the combination of the Malaysian tri-series and the Champions Trophy is ideal preparation for what will be a huge summer of cricket for Glenn in Australia and overseas. 

There were no major surprises in the 14-man squad with selectors choosing a combination of experienced and fringe players pushing for selection in the Ashes squad. 

Hayden, Mark Cosgrove, Dan Cullen, Phil Jacques and Brad Haddin were the ones eliminated from the expanded 18-man squad chosen for the Malaysia tri-series. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist was recalled after deciding to skip that tournament.

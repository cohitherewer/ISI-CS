 MAM takes it all 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: South India racing baron MAM Ramaswamy, and his allied colours, made a virtual history on Wednesday, winning all the seven races on the days card. Trainer Daniel David claimed five, including the two trophy events on offer ? the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup and the 1,200m Supernova Cup ? which were won by Star Phoenix and Notable Guest, respectively.

 Visiting jockey Imran Chisty also made hey, winning five ? riding three for Daniel, and also a win apiece for Errol Bhungard and Farley Rodrigues ? the other two schoolers who also train for the racing baron.

 Barring Notable Guest, the winner of the Supernova Cup and Mighty Flash who lifted the opener, the Victo Handicap, the rest of winners including Star Phoenix, were course favourites.

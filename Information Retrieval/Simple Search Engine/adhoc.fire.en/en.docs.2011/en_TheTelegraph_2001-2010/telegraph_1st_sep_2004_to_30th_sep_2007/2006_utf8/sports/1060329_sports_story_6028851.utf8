 Sangakkara en route to his unbeaten 77 on Tuesday 

Colombo: Sri Lanka seized control of the first Test against Pakistan after a career-best bowling performance from Ferveez Mahroof was followed by a powerful top-order batting display on Tuesday. 

Pakistan had grabbed the initiative on Monday after bowling out Sri Lanka for 185, but the hosts struck back on Day III, skittling out Pakistan for 176 in 54.4 overs and then reaching a strong 242 for two in the second innings. 

With two days left, Sri Lankas lead is already a potentially match-winning 251 with top guns Kumar Sangakkara (77) and Mahela Jayawardene (69) still at the crease. 

Mahroof sparked Sri Lankas revival in the morning, claiming the wickets of Inzamam-ul-Haq (31) and Abdul Razzaq (8) in the first half hour to finish with career-best figures of four for 52 from 15 overs. 

He was well supported by off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan who polished off the lower order during an unbroken two-hour spell in which he took three for 41 from 17.4 overs. 

Opener Upul Tharanga then consolidated Sri Lankas position with a fine 72 from 133 balls, putting on 53 with a subdued Sanath Jayasuriya (13) and another 74 with Sangakkara during a long hot afternoon. 

Pace bowler Mohammed Asif eventually broke through during an aggressive post-lunch spell in which he targeted Jayasuriya with several short balls and eventually had him caught-behind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 WI played with verve

 Line of Fire

 Michael Holding

I suppose India made a mistake similar to what they had done in the first game by taking their foot off the pedal. On Thursday, their bowlers had been caught unaware because they did not believe the match could start on time due to overnight rain. On Saturday, the batsmen did not feel the need to apply since the target was so low. They took their eyes off the work ahead, and a sequence of wins was interrupted. 

India were also guilty of playing lofted strokes on a wicket which demanded grafting. Quite a few perished doing so. In smaller targets, it is always an issue with the batting team. Every batsman tends to leave the job to the next because the target is so low. Suddenly, loss of a few wickets and the prospects of an unlikely batting mishap are heightened. Thats what happened on Saturday. 

Just a run stood between India and yet another win in pursuit. Nobody had foreseen it since the target was so low and opponents were the lowly West Indies. Instead of picking on your boys, I guess you need to give credit where it belongs. Brian Laras men did a few very smart things in the field on Saturday. 

Dwayne Bravos final delivery encapsulated his teams verve. He had just been smacked through the covers, and another run would have at least preserved Indias lead in the series. He then chose to bowl a slower delivery which appeared a low full toss. Instead, it was turned into a yorker by the batsman. Bravo dared when he had been softened up. That alone seemed to have swayed cricketing gods in his favour. (PTI)

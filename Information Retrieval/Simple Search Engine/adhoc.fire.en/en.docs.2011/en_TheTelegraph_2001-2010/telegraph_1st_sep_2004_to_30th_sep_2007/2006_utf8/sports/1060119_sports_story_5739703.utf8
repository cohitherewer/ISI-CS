 Biaggi tests with Midland

Silverstone: Former motorcycle champion Max Biaggi survived a rain-soaked track on Wednesday in a test drive with Formula One team Midland. 

A four-time world champion on 250cc bikes, the 34-year-old Italian drove nine laps at Silverstone ? the venue for the annual British Grand Prix. It was an amazing experience, Biaggi said. The weather made it quite difficult. 

Its like a big go-kart, he added. I didnt get anywhere near its limit today, but I went fast enough to appreciate what level of performance can be reached. 

Biaggi was dropped after last season by Honda in MotoGP, the top level of motorcycle racing. His future for the 2006 season is undecided. 

Biaggi said he was looking forward to another test, perhaps landing a place as the teams test driver. (AP)

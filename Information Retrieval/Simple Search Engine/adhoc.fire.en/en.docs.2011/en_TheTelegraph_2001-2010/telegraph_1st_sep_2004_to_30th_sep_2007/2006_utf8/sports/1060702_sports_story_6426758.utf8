 World record by Sanath, Upul 

Leeds: Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriyas world record opening stand of 286 helped Sri Lanka record a crushing eight-wicket victory in the fifth and final one-day International at Headingley Saturday. 

Sri Lankas 5-0 series victory was the first time England had lost a head-to-head limited-overs campaign by such a margin and was their tenth defeat in their last 12 one-day Internationals. 

Set a seemingly imposing 322 for victory, Sri Lanka finished on 324 for two with more than 12 overs to spare. 

Jayasuriya scored 152 and fellow left-hander Tharanga 109, both men scoring their second centuries of the series. 

Their stand surpassed the 258 shared by Indias Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar against Kenya at Paarl in 2001-02. Harmison conceded 97 runs in 10 overs.

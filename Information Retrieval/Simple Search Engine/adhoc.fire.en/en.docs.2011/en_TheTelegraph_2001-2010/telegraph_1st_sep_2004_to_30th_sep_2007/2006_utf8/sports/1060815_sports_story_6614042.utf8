The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It will be an eye-opener, says Houghton

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bob Houghtons journey, truth to tell, is beginning on Wednesday. 

By his own admission, facing Saudi Arabia in the AFC Asian Cup qualifier in his first competitive game as India coach is going to be a cumbersome task. 

If we wish to believe that we are capable of going higher, we must start beating teams like Saudi Arabia. Wednesdays match is going to be a big eye-opener, for me as well as for the team, Houghton said at a press conference at a city hotel on Monday. 

 According to Houghton, its the physique factor more than the mental that is coming in the way of the games progress here. If the presence of Bhaichung Bhutia in Houghtons scheme of things is a morale-booster for the team, the inclement weather may appear to be an advantage for his side. If it rains also on Wednesday, it will give us an advantage, goalkeeper Sandip Nandy said. 

The coach named Bhaichung as captain and hailed him as a genuine goal-scorer, which means S. Venkatesh who led the side in Vancouver will be his deputy. 

Im going to take this match on two fronts. First, how we stand vis-a-vis standards of other Asian teams. Secondly, how the boys will show their ability, fitness and determination. It may not produce a victory for us, but If we are able to stick to the basics, I can say, well move to the right direction, Houghton remarked. 

He didnt name his 20-member squad, but it has been learnt that Bibiano Fernandes and Habibur Rehman Mondal will be dropped from the list.

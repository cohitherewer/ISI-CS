London: Li Na created history for China at Wimbledon on Monday while the United States departed from the singles with their tail firmly between their legs. 

British hopes of a first mens champion since 1936 also evaporated in the searing sunshine when Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis brushed aside Scottish teenager Andy Murray in the fourth round. 

Roger Federers Wimbledon title charge gathered momentum on Monday after he dispatched Czech Tomas Berdych 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the quarter finals. 

 Berdych had inflicted one of the most painful defeats of his career on Federer, at the 2004 Athens Olympics, but there was no repeat of it on Monday. 

Li, 24, overcame Czech 17-year-old Nicole Vaidisova 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 to become Chinas first Grand Slam singles quarter finalist. 

Im proud of myself and very proud for my country as well, Li said, speaking via an interpreter. Even though I lost the first set, Im proud of what I achieved. 

Li beat Russian French Open runner-up Svetlana Kuznetsova in the third round and used her withering forehand to cow Vaidisova, who reached the last four at the Roland Garros. 

She plays Belgian second seed Kim Clijsters in the last eight. Clijsters outclassed Polish teenager Agnieszka Radwanska 6-2, 6-2 on Monday. 

Before Wimbledon, the best singles showing by a Chinese player was Zheng Jies run to the French Open fourth round in 2004. 

Meanwhile, Indias Sania Mirza pairing with Michaella Krajicek of the Netherlands, bowed out of the womens doubles event after losing to Russias Elena Dementieva and Flavia Pennetta of Italy 4-6, 2-6 in the second round. 

Shenay Perrys 2-6, 0-6 defeat by Russian Elena Dementieva meant there would be no American man or woman in the quarter finals of the singles for the first time since 1911. 

Sharapova, the 2004 champion, dropped her first set of the tournament in a tough 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 win over Italian Flavia Pennetta.

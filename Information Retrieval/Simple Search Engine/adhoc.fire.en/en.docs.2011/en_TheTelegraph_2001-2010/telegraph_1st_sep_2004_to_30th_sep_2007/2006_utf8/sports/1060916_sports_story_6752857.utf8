 Atwal set to miss cut

Farmington: Arjun Atwal was in danger of missing yet another cut after returning a card of seven-over 79 on the opening day of the 84 Lumber Classic. 

Atwal was lying 132nd, way below the expected cut line at the Mystic Rock Golf Course here. 

This season Atwal has already missed 16 cuts in 26 starts and at 139th place on money list and he could be forced back to qualifying school with limited exemptions for next season. 

Atwal had bogeys on second, fourth, 10th and 11th and he dropped four shots on 17th when he went into the water. His only bogey came on eighth and he needed 33 putts on a tough day. (PTI)

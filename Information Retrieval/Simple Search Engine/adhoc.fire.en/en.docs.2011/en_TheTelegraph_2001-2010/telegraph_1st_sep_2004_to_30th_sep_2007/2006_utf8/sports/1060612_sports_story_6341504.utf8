 Argentina, Ivory Coast have brought Cup alive

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

A day after a spectacular beginning, the World Cup came alive with the Argentina-Ivory Coast match on Saturday. Some brilliant combination play, sparkles of individualism and mind-boggling moments of pacy football from the two relatively young teams ? this was football as good as it could get. 

Germany and England failed to provide the joy and satisfaction we were expecting from two of the title-contenders. All the more reason why Saturdays final game stirred our senses. The Argentina-Ivory Coast match could just be the harbinger of things to come: Lets wait for jogo bonito to sweep the world! 

Football is basically a team game in which a few have this ability of doing the star turn. Argentinas advantage lies in the fact that they play as a unit, and instead of waiting for individual stars to make things happen, everyone goes about achieving his goal by maintaining a perfect cohesion from attacking third to defence. Their midfield, led by Juan Riquelme, feeds off the backline and ensures constant supplies to the men up front. 

This understanding among defence, midfield and attack ? so noticeable courtesy a series of passes ? makes Argentina a real torch-bearer of modern football. The second goal ? by Javier Saviola ? was a result of this passing game while Hernan Crespos opening one was a reflection of the strikers opportunism. 

I have to say Ivory Coast took me by surprise. In patches, they even looked a better unit than their fancied rivals. Didier Drogba got a late goal but they looked like scoring a long time back. In the end, I genuinely felt sorry for the Africans ? at least they should have shared points with Argentina. 

I also want to retract from my earlier comment that an African team has no chance of winning the World Cup in near future. Ivory Coast have made me feel differently. 

Drogba was a treat to watch. His goal ? characterised by a breathtaking turn and the typical strikers nose for the ball ? proved why he is such a favourite of Jose Mourinho. His presence acted as an inspiration to his teammates, who looked determined to show the world that they had more to offer than the newcomers usual apprehensive fare. 

Argentina have a long way to go. They are my dark horses and just about managed to cross a difficult hurdle. They are truly in a group of death since The Netherlands and Serbia and Montenegro are also there. 

In the first match, the Argentines were casual and a bit complacent towards the end, which was evident from their way of exchanging passes and not trying to translate those into offensive possibilities. 

May be they took the 2-0 cushion as decisive. But the intensity and competitiveness of any major tournament doesnt permit you any breathing space till the final whistle is blown. 

Little surprisingly, it was around this time that Drogba pulled one back and the Argentine defence lived some anxious moments in thwarting Ivory Coasts charge. 

Lionel Messi was not fielded on Saturday since hes still recuperating from his injury. I feel once the Barcelona striker is fielded, things may fall in place nicely for Maradonas country. 

Argentina and the first-timers gave us a match to remember. Lets savour those moments till other teams join the party.

 Czechs pay due respect to US 

 - Baros set to face fitness test before match 

Hamburg: Czech Republic will not take their task lightly when they make their World Cup debut against the United States in Group E on Monday. 

In 1990, Czechoslovakia crushed the USA 5-1 at the World Cup but the Czech Republic, playing in their first finals as an independent nation, know the USA have come a long way since. 

The highly regarded Czechs know complacency could be fatal against a team that reached the quarter finals after shocking Portugal 3-2 in their World Cup opener four years ago. 

The result of the first match is the key for success in the whole tournament, said tall 33-year-old striker Jan Koller. We all realise that and obviously feel a responsibility. We have a quality team and want to win. 

The Czech Republic, who reached the Euro 2004 semi-finals, looked as if they might have injury worries leading up to the game but everyone is fit except striker Milan Baros. 

Baros, however, is set to face a fitness test before the match. I dont know, our doctors dont know. I dont want to put (the chance he will be fit) as a percentage, coach Karel Brueckner told reporters ahead of the training session in Gelsenkirchen. His situation is the same as yesterday. 

Brueckner, who had previously said he would make a final decision of Baross fitness on Sunday, said he would not risk playing him unless he was completely fit, and had other options. 

If the player is not 100 per cent fit, we will not risk his health, Brueckner said. 

There have also been concerns among the Czech media that several key players in midfield and up front are the wrong side of 30, although the defence is sprightly enough. 

Playmaker Pavel Nedved, who came out of international retirement, limped away from training on Thursday after a knock to his knee. The 33-year-old is, however, expected to play. 

It is true that we have some older players but with the age we have a lot of experience, said goalkeeper Petr Cech. 

However, the USA coach Bruce Arena is happy to express his confidence in a team few took seriously before their win over Portugal in 2002 and says they can do well against the Czechs. 

Arena has the same core of players as four years ago but now with more experience at the highest level. 

I think experience helps, Arena said. I think it is an advantage to have a number of players who played in 2002 and experienced success. Several others were there in 1998. 

Arena knows the USA need at least a point against the Czechs ? with Italy and Ghana looming ? to boost their hopes of surviving a difficult Group E.

New Delhi: Subhas Bhowmick, who began his five-match coaching assignment on Tuesday with the Mohammedan Sporting in Goa, did not waste any time to deal with things with iron hands for which he was known for in East Bengal four months ago. 

According to the team sources in Goa, the footballers have already started feeling the heat of the coachs no-nonsense attitude. Bhowmick made his intentions clear when he fined two senior footballers ? Bijen Singh and Nitin Pradhan ? of Rs. 1,000 each for reporting at the hotel lobby five minutes later than the scheduled time. 

He has also instructed Zimbabwean stopper back David Mkandwire to cut down on his juice intake. 

The first practice session of Mohammedan Sporting under Bhowmick took place at the Varca grounds on Tuesday evening which lasted for about an hour. The first thing I ought to do here is change the players body language. They seem to be down at the moment, and understandably so, explained Bhowmick. 

About himself Bhowmick said, I was born as a footballer, and its tough for me to keep away from the game. The past four months have been painful, a shocking experience. I always knew that someday I would be back on the field. I must confess it has happened much sooner though. 

Mohammedan Sporting will take on Dempo on Wednesday, who are quite upbeat after victories over Air India and JCT in the last two outings.

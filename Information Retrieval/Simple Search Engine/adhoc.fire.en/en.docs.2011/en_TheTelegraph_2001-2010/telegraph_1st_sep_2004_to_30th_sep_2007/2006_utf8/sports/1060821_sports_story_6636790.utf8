The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Atherton: Umpires lacked common sense

While there was no play after tea on Sunday, Sky Sports live coverage was absolutely fascinating. Heres what the star commentators, as also others who came into the picture, had to say: 

David Lloyd: It is a poor show by Pakistan. It all happened between 2.30 and 2.40. That is when Pakistan refused to come out. And when they did, I saw one of the PCB officials giving players the thumbs up. 

Michael Atherton: What with 25-26 cameras around, we didnt miss much Had there been anything untoward, our cameras would have caught it Clearly, the umpires lacked common sense. As far as Darrell Hair is concerned, the match is over Though there is a history of animosity between the two teams, of late it has been hunky-dory 

Lloyd: Exactly Camaraderie between the two teams have been excellent. 

Rameez Raja: Heres a team which feels that We are not wanted. I have been speaking to Kaneria and he also feels that Hair has been stalking him. The entire Pakistan team feels that Hair has been acting like a policeman. They feel that Hair is against them. 

Lloyd: Let me remind you here that this is all speculation 

Atherton: But there are a few things we know for sure... We know that Hair has accused Pakistan of ball-tampering. And then after tea, when one team goes out into the middle, and the other doesnt game over! I dont think Hair will go out into the middle because the game is over for him. 

David Gower: If you go by the rules of the game, the game is over. However, we do not know whether the ICC will step in whether the Match Referee will step in We dont know whether any negotiations are possible 

Lloyd: In recent times, there have been very good relations between the two teams For gods sake! Its only cricket 

Atherton: The moment Pakistan started reverse- swinging the ball, allegations of ball-tampering resurfaced. 

Rameez: This is not the first time that Pakistan had been playing a tough match. In fact, their recent matches against India and let me tell you that they dont come tougher than that not one instance of ball-tampering was lodged against them or the Indians. Believe me, Hair is a very popular umpire for reasons I dont want to discuss here Inzy and his team has been hurt very badly They have been labelled as cheats, which I think, is very unfortunate. The decision to award penalty runs came as a huge surprise because no player was warned and it looks a very subjective decision. With so many cameras, nobody was caught and there seems to be no evidence. I think the Pakistan board should tackle this aggressively because this could spoil a very good series. 

Ian Botham: Can the Match Referee overrule the umpire? 

Gower: The Match Referee could, if he wants to Maybe Hair would think that would create another problem. There will be ramifications, which we are not even aware of right now 

Nasser Hussain: Well, the lights gone It remains to be seen whether Hair issues an apology or whether ICC issues a statement. We have to wait and see 

Shaharyar Khan (PCB chief): We are absolutely ready to play The boys came out to start playing again. We want the Test to continue We are ready to play. I understand that the umpires are not ready. At tea, the captain and team felt deeply aggrieved and insulted for being implicated in cheating the accusation of ball-tampering tantamounts to that. No one was consulted, the umpires dont have to, mind you, but the fact remains that no one was consulted and an unilateral decision taken of penalising them. 

At tea, the captain and the boys felt deeply humiliated. They were waiting for a few moments after play resumed to lodge a protest, nothing else. But to our surprise, the umpires are not ready to come out now. David Morgan came to our dressing room and we had a chat with him. We thought the issue has been resolved. But now, we find the umpires are not ready. As regarding the ODI series, I dont know what will happen. We have no complaints whatsoever about the ECB. If this match is abandoned, it wont be because of them We absolutely want to play the ODI series. 

Gower: Well, it now seems clear that Pakistan wanted to continue playing 

Lloyd: Pakistan wanted to make a protest by delaying their entry Law 21 3b clearly states that in the opinion of the umpires, if a team refuses to play, the umpires shall award the match to the other side 

Gower: There will be no further play today, according to the fourth umpire This is the most sensitive situation in a long time I am absolutely appalled by the lack of action and initiative shown by the ICC. 

Botham: ICC should have acted faster and swifter... They are in charge of the game. 

Paul Sheldon (Surrey County chief executive and acting ECB spokesperson): England batsmen were out there and all ready to resume playing Its certainly nothing to do with the spirit between the teams. That much I can tell you. Just like the rest of us, they are in there waiting for someone to tell them whats happening. 

Botham: Hair has his right to stand his ground But does he have enough evidence to suggest that actual ball-tampering took place ICC must make a statement. 

Hussain: Darrell probably feels that if he firmly believes he caught someone he must go ahead and report it Whether its chucking or tampering, he probably feels it is up to him to highlight it But he should have known the consequences of his action. 

Gower: Well footage clearly proves that Pak bowlers were not trying to hide anything 

ECB statement: Following issues raised by on-field umpires A meeting will be held after play to determine whether further play will be held tomorrow. 

Botham: The ECB and PCB may say what they want to, but really it is up to the ICC the people who run the game to move their backside and take a decision and they are not taking any decision 

Hussain: Everybody says they are ready to play The ECB, PCB and the players say so It remains to be seen whether Hair will back down whether he will be persuaded to carry on and reverse his decision. 

 Note: Till 1 am, no statement had been released 

 by the ICC.

 WI face another contracts row

 Sarwan may get captaincy 

St Johns: The West Indies, dogged by problems on and off the field, is in doldrums as another contracts feud returns to haunt the game. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) on Thursday made it clear that the players must either sign the retainer deals within a stipulated time or face being axed from the squad. 

The WICB made a proposal to the West Indies Players Association (WIPA) on January 12 on the issue of retainer contracts for West Indies players, a WICB cricket committee statement read. 

It was a good offer, fully competitive with other full member countries of the world. After some three months, we have been unable to conclude an agreement in spite of an increase on our original proposal of five per cent. 

We have been at a loss to understand the reasons for this matter being dragged out as long as it has, until Wednesday. Information has now reached us that discussions are taking place between certain players and interests in direct competition with our major sponsor. 

We shall therefore recommend to the WICB board of directors that a firm cut off point be established as Friday, April 21, for the retainer contracts to be settled. 

Meanwhile, the WICBs newly-installed cricket committee discussed but did not recommend any replacement for Shivnarine Chanderpaul as captain of the Caribbean team, chairman and former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd said. 

Chanderpaul resigned last week, saying he wanted to concentrate on regaining his batting form, eight days before the new panel met on Wednesday for the first time. 

We didnt have to make any recommendation as such, Lloyd said. 

There are a number of them. We have Sarwan. We have (Daren) Ganga. We have the young fellow (Sylvester) Joseph, Lloyd said. 

The ICC would soon set a deadline for the WICB to confirm the World Cup venues, as it finds that the hosts were lagging behind in their preparations, a report in a Pakistan daily read. (AGENCIES)

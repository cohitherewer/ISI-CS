The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Why does Hair only pick on Asians?

 - Arjuna Ranatunga on the controversial Australian 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ranatunga 

Calcutta: Over a decade has passed, but Arjuna Ranatunga (the then Sri Lanka captain, who is now a politician) hasnt forgotten his headline-making showdown with Darrell Hair. 

Its still pretty fresh in memory Hair calling Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) seven times in three overs I dont think Ive ever used the word racist in my life, so I wont today, but why does he only pick on Asians? I would like an answer Im sure others, too, share this sentiment, Ranatunga told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Colombo on Monday afternoon, the 1996 World Cup-winning captain added: I was watching the (Oval) Test on TV and at no time did the cameras zoom on anything suspicious Its highly improbable that more than 20 of them could miss any form of ball tampering I cant believe it. 

[It couldnt be confirmed, but the International Cricket Council (ICC) is understood to have been informed by Sky Sports that theres no footage to indict any Pakistani.] 

Like Michael Atherton and other ex-captains, Ranatunga maintained Hair should have handled the issue quite differently. 

Given the lack of video footage, whats the concrete evidence he had? Moreover, why didnt he first caution Inzy (Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq)? Its terrible if Hair just presumed that the ball was tampered with It could, for example, have got scuffed after hitting the railings Then, lets not forget the ball was over 50 overs old On sensitive issues, you cant presume anything, he said. 

Ranatunga appreciated the restraint shown by Inzamam in not staging a protest as soon as the ball was changed. 

Inzy is one of the nicest and most straightforward cricketers around and its because hes such a gentleman that he didnt walk off immediately I, for one, would have headed straight for the Match Referees room I would have resisted the change After all, without evidence, how can I be called a cheat? And, by extension, my country? Such a slur cant be tolerated by anybody, he asserted. 

Ranatunga tore into Hair for being insensitive towards the paying public as well. 

There were more than 20,000 fans at The Oval and he ought to have thought about them, too The Test should have resumed once the Pakistan team returned to the field, he observed. 

Ranatunga felt the ICC had done the correct thing by keeping Hair out of Sri Lankas matches for seven years after that ugly face-off at the MCG (December 1995), but the Australian still hadnt reformed himself. 

Thats a telling comment. 

He continued: I dont want to preach, but the ICC has serious issues to look at Indeed, its time for the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) to sit down and take a stand collectively The sooner, the better. 

By rotation, Sri Lankas Jayantha Dharmadasa is heading the ACC.

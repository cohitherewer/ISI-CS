 Negi back to winning ways

New Delhi: Parimarjan Negi returned to winning ways as he outplayed International Master S. Vijaylakshmi with white pieces to close in on his second Grandmaster norm at the Parsvanath International Open Chess tournament here on Thursday. 

National champion Surya Sekher Ganguly, the highest-rated Indian GM playing in the tournament, settled for a draw against top seed Alexei Fedorov and slipped to joint third spot with a tally of 5.5 points. 

The draw enabled the Belarussian maintain his overnight sole lead with 6.5 points while a group of six players were close on his heels half a point behind.

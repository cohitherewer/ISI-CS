 Quick Takes

 Heads of state take World Cup break

 Brussels: The White House 

 and European leaders are preoccupied with a very grave matter 

 these days. Whats going on at the World Cup?

 Televisions at the US Presidential 

 residence have been tuned to the World Cup, while the British 

 and Swedish Prime Ministers tried to catch glimpses of the 

 games during a European Union summit on Thursday. Of the 

 32 World Cup teams, 10 are from EU nations. The President 

 follows sports, White House press secretary Tony Snow 

 said. And obviously, soccers more popular in 

 other countries than it is in the US. But its got 

 a pretty good constituency. British Prime Minister 

 Tony Blair watched the last 10 minutes of Englands 

 first half against Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday in private 

 room before briefly joining the summits opening session.

 No snub for Kaviedes

 Berlin: Fifa is not planning 

 to take any action against Ecuadorian striker Ivan Kaviedes 

 for donning a Spider-Man mask to celebrate his goal against 

 Costa Rica in their Group A clash on Thursday. Markus Siegler, 

 Fifas director of communications said on Friday: Well 

 to be honest, there is nothing in the laws to forbid this 

 kind of thing.

 Health experts rap Fifa

 London: Health experts 

 criticised Fifa, the organisers of the World Cup, on Friday 

 for choosing a fast food giant, a brewer and soft drinks 

 maker as official sponsors of soccers showcase event. 

 They said it is difficult to reconcile Fifas choice 

 of McDonalds Corp., Coca-Cola and Budweiser beer, 

 which is made by Anheuser-Busch, as official partners for 

 the World Cup which aims to promote sports and health.

 Fifa absolves Paraguay

 Berlin: Fifa cleared Paraguays 

 national soccer association of wrongdoing after an investigation 

 into whether it sold hundreds of its allotted World Cup 

 tickets to an unauthorised reseller. There is no evidence 

 that Paraguay violated any articles of the Participating 

 Member Association agreement ? nothing is wrong, Fifa 

 communications director Markus Siegler said on Friday. Its 

 not forbidden... Theres no obligation that their tickets 

 can only be sold in their proper country.

 Deep Purple gig

 Bad Brueckenau: Croatia 

 have an unorthodox way of motivating their players for their 

 crucial World Cup match against Japan. Rock band Deep Purple 

 will be holding a concert under the windows of the teams 

 hotel on Friday and officials say players are welcome to 

 attend. Anything to lift them after an unlucky opening 0-1 

 defeat against champion Brazil.

 Music gets the rhythm process 

 going and the blood stream running, team treasurer 

 Zorislav Srebric said. Not only will they hear and 

 see it (the concert), they can be part of it.

 Presidential props

 Berlin: Ecuador President 

 Alfredo Palacio called up the Ecuadorian national team after 

 their 3-0 victory over Costa Rica on Thursday and congratulated 

 the players, telling them there will be popular celebrations 

 with bands in Quito, Guayaquil and El Chota. Dear 

 players, distinguished Ecuadorians... on behalf of our country, 

 were here united and proud, willing to follow your 

 example, said Palacio. Its an enormous 

 achievement that unites us all.

 Smashing fun

 Berlin: Dutch insurance 

 companies are being inundated with claims from soccer fanatics 

 who have had World Cup-linked accidents ? from shattered 

 sofas to orange hair dye stains, according to a report on 

 Friday. 

 They are strange cases. 

 One family broke their sofa during the match, an insurance 

 company agent told a local daily. After the goal (against 

 Serbia-Montenegro) they all leapt up only to crash through 

 the sofa when they all sat down again. Another family 

 filed a claim after visitors who came to watch the match 

 with them left furniture stained with their face paint and 

 hair dye ? all in the national colour of orange. Other accidents 

 included a man who smashed his wifes glasses in the 

 excitement of the victory.

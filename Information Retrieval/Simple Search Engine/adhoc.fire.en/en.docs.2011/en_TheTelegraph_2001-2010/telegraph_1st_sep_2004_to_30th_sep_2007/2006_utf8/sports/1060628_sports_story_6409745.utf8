 French official blames Blatter 

 - Poor Refereeing

Berlin: A leading French referee has slammed the catastrophic officiating at the World Cup and blamed Fifa president Sepp Blatter for putting politics before football in choosing referees. 

They have selected the best teams from each continent, but not the best referees, said Bernard Saules, the president of the French National Union of Referees (UNAF). 

It has been a catastrophe from the start. Fifa and Mr Blatter have introduced some political shenanigans into the choice of the referees to keep this or that country happy, and this is the result, he said. 

The best referees come from Europe, but only nine out of 26 of the referees at the World Cup are European, added Saules, though, with that number the Europeans have the largest proportion of referees at the tournament. 

It is alright to bring referees of average standard for minor international competitions, but not the World Cup. 

However, two of the most heavily criticised referees at footballs showpiece have been Graham Poll of England and Russias Valentin Ivanov.

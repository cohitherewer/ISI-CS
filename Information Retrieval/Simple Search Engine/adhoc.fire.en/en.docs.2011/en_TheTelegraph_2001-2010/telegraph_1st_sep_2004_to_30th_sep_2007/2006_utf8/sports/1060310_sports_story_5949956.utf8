The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Honours even on a day of light-and-shade

 - Pietersen takes charge after Pathans opening blows 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Pietersen in action on Thursday 

Chandigarh: Whether the birth of his second child back home will bring Andrew Flintoff and England luck is still not known, but the Indians certainly were a confused lot when they left the PCA Stadium in Mohali on Thursday evening. 

Long before Rahul Dravid and Flintoff went out to toss, the squall that hit the city and nearby Mohali early on Thursday had left behind a chilly atmosphere and overcast conditions. Any other captain would have decided to go in with at least three mediumpacers under the circumstances. England did so, bringing in Liam Plunkett. 

The Indians, however, chose to include three spinners hoping against hope that the wicket will break third day onwards. There has, however, been not much sign of any assistance on the opening day of this second TVS Cup Test. 

The last time the Indians had played three spinners was in the fourth Test of the 2004-05 series against Australia in Mumbai. The hosts had won then in hugely different conditions. It was also the first time since the match against Zimbabwe in Nagpur, 2000, that India were playing a home Test with five bowlers. Flintoff made a just decision on winning the toss, and a delayed start and two stoppages later, England ended at 163 for four once bad light forced an early end. A total of 155 minutes of play was lost. That England complicated matters was mainly due to poor shot selection. 

Till a few years ago, the Mohali wicket was considered to be one of the fastest in the country. Now, even the opening day of a Test hardly enthuses the bowler. Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) president Inderjit Singh Bindra had promised a lively wicket after the last Test in Mohali ? an India-Pakistan encounter which ended in a stalemate. His assurances seem to bear little credence. 

On a grassless wicket, the Indians were made to toil as the visiting batsmen showed extra caution. Debutant Munaf Patel was hardly enterprising till his last spell of the day when Paul Collingwood was lucky to dig out a well-directed yorker at 144.7 kmph. 

Soon after, Patel picked his maiden wicket when Kevin Pietersen, the most successful of the batsmen with a well-compiled 64, drove him back to the bowler. Patel must have realised the hard way the wide gap that exists between first class and Test cricket and that pace alone would not serve the purpose. 

Irfan Pathan certainly used the conditions better with his use of the seam. The openers were removed in quick succession, Mahendra Singh Dhoni accounting for Andrew Strauss with a well-judged catch low down in front of first slip. 

Harbhajan Singh was introduced as early as the eighth over, but in his eagerness to pick up a wicket, he faltered in trying too many things with the still hard ball. Anil Kumble used his experience and expertise in dealing with the situation. He bowled the set Ian Bell with a googly that left the batsmen embarrassed and also got the ball to jump alarmingly at the far end in the closing stages. 

 The other debutant, 17-year-old Piyush Chawla began his international career with a maiden before lunch. The leggie never seemed to be overawed by the circumstances during his five overs. Dravid did well to take him off soon after Pietersen launched into an offensive, hitting him for a four and a six. 

Pietersen showed calm assurance in dealing with the attack during his 137-minute stay despite battling a stomach bug. With Bell showing increasing maturity, the pair added 81 runs for the third wicket. 

It will be left to Collingwood and Flintoff to carry on the battle on Friday. Collingwood has already proved his worth, and Flintoff is not in alien territory either. The Indian spinners will have to contend with their reputation in home conditions to justify the team managements decision. The forecast, though, is not encouraging. 

It was a day when Sachin Tendulkar equalled Kapil Devs record for most Test appearances (131) by an Indian.

 Zaheer keen to return next year

 - Worcestershire stint 

London: Indian left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan has said he would like to continue his association with Worcestershire after enjoying a successful stint with the County side this season. 

Zaheer was drafted in by the pears as a last-minute replacement for Australian paceman Nathan Bracken and has so far taken 69 first-class wickets, a figure surpassed this season only by Sussex spinner Mushtaq Ahmed. 

Worcester is definitely a place Id like to come back to next year. Ive really enjoyed this season. The dressing room has been great and I have made a lot of new friends, said the bowler who was recently drafted among probables for the Champions Trophy after being ignored for the last six months. 

The ground here is also very beautiful and hopefully if things go well I might come back next year, Ive not really had any discussions with the club so far and am just focusing on finishing the season on a good note, he told a TV channel. 

That is what I am concentrating on now and maybe after the season has finished we will see how it goes. (PTI)

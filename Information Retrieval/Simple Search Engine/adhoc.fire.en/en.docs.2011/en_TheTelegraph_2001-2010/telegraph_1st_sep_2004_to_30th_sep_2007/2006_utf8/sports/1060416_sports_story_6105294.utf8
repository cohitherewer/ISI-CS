 Mills, Franklin restrict SA

 First Test

 Centurion: New Zealand 

 mediumpacer Kyle Mills took four wickets to reduce South 

 Africa to 266 for eight on the opening day of the first 

 Test on Saturday.

 Mills maintained a tight line 

 and extracted bounce to take a career-best four for 43. 

 Left-arm paceman James Franklin captured three for 67, after 

 South Africa won the toss.

 Captain Stephen Fleming became 

 the first New Zealander to reach 100 Test caps while Kallis 

 and Pollock joined the retired Gary Kirsten as the only 

 South Africans to reach the milestone.

 Mills first struck in the fifth 

 over when Herschelle Gibbs, on six, played an insipid stroke 

 to an in swinger and edged the ball on to his middle stump.

 India undecided on captaincy

Chandigarh: Pakistan will hold the edge as they take on out-of-sorts India in the first of the six-Test hockey series here on Friday. 

On the eve of the opener, the Indian team looked in disarray with uncertainty still prevailing over who would don the skippers mantle in the absence of regular captain Dilip Tirkey. The ace defender, who got married recently, has opted out of the first three matches of the home leg for personal reasons. 

The crown is likely to go to either of the two senior most players ? Ignace Tirkey or striker Arjun Halappa.

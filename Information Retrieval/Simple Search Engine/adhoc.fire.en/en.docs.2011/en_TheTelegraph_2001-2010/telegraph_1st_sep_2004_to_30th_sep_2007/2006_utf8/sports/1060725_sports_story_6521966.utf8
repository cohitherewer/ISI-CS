 TFA participation in doubt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 National League

 New Delhi: Unimpressed 

 by newly promoted TFAs willingness to participate 

 in the NFL with their teenage students, the AIFF is believed 

 to be giving a fresh thought to the idea of allowing the 

 Jamshedpur outfit to take part in the premier league. 

 According to AIFF sources, the 

 TFA has written to the federation saying that its management 

 has shot down a proposal to raise a professional side for 

 the NFL. Instead, the TFA has decided to use their newly 

 recruited wards, aged between 16 and 18, for the rigorous 

 22-match NFL campaign slated to begin in January next.

 The AIFF officials, who feel such 

 a stand by TFA will only dilute the competitive flavour 

 of the NFL, have decided to review the whole situation in 

 the executive committee meeting on July 29 in the capital. 

 Sources revealed that it may even go to the extent of requesting 

 TFA to withdraw from the NFL and may accommodate some other 

 team in the 10-team championships.

 TFAs biggest problem is 

 that they have lost their entire lot of boys, who helped 

 the team emerge second division NFL champions in Bangalore 

 last season. Since the academy has no such rule to hold 

 on to those boys who have already finished their course, 

 they are now left with no other option but to depend on 

 youngsters, who have just been recruited this season. 

 Going strictly by the rules, 

 it may be difficult for the federation to bar the TFA from 

 taking part in the NFL, sources said. But it 

 can always pull them up for not taking the NFL with adequate 

 seriousness and for exposing youngsters too early to a tough 

 competition which might even jeopardise their playing career.

 A section in the AIFF, however 

 feel that short-sighted views on the part of the federation 

 allowed such a situation to arise. The AIFF should 

 have anticipated the scenario before and should have made 

 a law barring the academy teams from taking part in top 

 level professional tournaments, said an official. 

 That would have solved the problems.

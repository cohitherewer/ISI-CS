 Repentant Poll decides to quit

London: English referee Graham Poll said on Thursday he had decided to retire from international tournaments after his high-profile blunder at the World Cup. 

He showed three yellow cards to Josip Simunic of Croatia before sending him off in the 2-2 draw with Australia on June 22. 

A clearly emotional Poll said he deeply regretted his mistake which he called inexcusable. On Wednesday, Fifa dispensed with Polls services for the rest of the meet. 

What I did was an error in law, said Poll.There can be no dispute. It was not caused by a Fifa directive, it was not caused by me being asked to referee differently to the way I referee in the Premier League. 

The laws of the game are very specific. The referee takes responsibility for his actions on the field of play. I was the referee that evening. It was my error and the buck stops with me.

 AIFF to start Super League in March

Bangalore: As part of the Vision India programme of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the AIFF will introduce a Super League from March next year, AFC general secretary Peter Velappan said on Monday. 

Velappan said that under the programme, 12 professional teams would compete in the Super League for further promotion of the game. 

Now, AIFF conducts only a National League. 

Plans were afoot to build a pyramid structure aimed at generating interest among youth in soccer by encouraging teams at under-12, under-15 and under-18, besides under-20, he said adding the game should be part of school curriculum. 

A football festival would be organised, he said but did not set any time frame for it. 

Commenting on the ongoing AFC Youth Championship, he said, we can see the quality of players has improved for better than previous editions. We hope in five to ten years AFC football will be on higher level. 

Velappan said the Vision India programme is being launched as a pilot programme in Manipur and later in Delhi. (PTI)

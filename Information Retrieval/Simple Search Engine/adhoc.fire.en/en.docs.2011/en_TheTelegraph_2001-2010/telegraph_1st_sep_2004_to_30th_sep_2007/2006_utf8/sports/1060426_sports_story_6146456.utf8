 Rooney: We are serious contenders

Manchester: England striker Wayne Rooney expects his country to mount a serious challenge to win the World Cup in Germany. We are all confident, especially after the Argentina game when we won that, he said on Tuesday. 

Rooney, 20, scored in Englands 3-2 win over Argentina in a World Cup warm-up game in November to give England a potential edge should they meet in Germany. 

Speaking at the launch of a new Nike football boot at Old Trafford, the Manchester United man said: It did not seem like a friendly game. If you had seen all the lads in the dressing room after the game, everyone was jumping around. I dont know why, but I celebrated that game more than some of the qualifying games. 

Obviously I think Brazil are favourites because when you look at their team and squad of players its frightening. 

Rooney also regards Argentina, Italy, the Netherlands and host country Germany as threats to Englands hopes of winning the competition.

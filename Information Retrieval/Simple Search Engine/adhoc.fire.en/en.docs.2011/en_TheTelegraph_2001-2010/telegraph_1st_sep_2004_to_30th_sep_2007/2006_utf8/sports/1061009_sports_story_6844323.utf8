 Gaekwad slams Greg

Ahmedabad: Former India opener and coach Aunshuman Gaekwad criticised coach Greg Chappells tendency to experiment and putting too much faith in juniors but said the hosts had the potential to win the ICC Champions Trophy. 

Too much of experimentation is affecting the team. I understand that a coach from a foreign land has to do it because he needs to form a clear idea about the capability of his players. But I think he has carried it too far, Gaekwad said.

Abu Dhabi: Virender Sehwag announced his return to form with a typically cavalier 73 as the Indian batsmen came into their own to post a challenging 269 for five against arch rivals Pakistan in the second one-day International for the DLF Cup here on Wednesday. 

 Pakistan were reeling at 137 for five after 37 overs 

 at midnight. Inzamam-ul Haq was on 45 and Kamran Akmal on 

 18. Irfan Pathan took two wickets, including his 100th ODI 

 scalp, Ramesh Powar two and Ajit Agarkar one. Imran Farhat 

 (8), Shahid Afridi (0), Younis Khan (5), Mohammed Yousuf 

 (5) and Shoaib Malik (46) were the batsmen dismissed. 

It was a complete reversal of the script from Tuesdays match as the very Indian batsmen who looked pedestrian, turned it around to put in a performance worthy of their staggering reputation. 

While Rahul Dravid led from the front with a 116-ball 92, Mahendra Singh Dhoni chipped in with 59 to give their supporters at the Zayed Stadium a lot to cheer for. 

Yuvraj Singh provided the late flourish with a cameo 24 off 10 balls that included a hattrick of boundaries and a six off a Mohammed Asif over. 

However, the most heartening performance was the show up the order by Sehwag who slammed 10 fours and a six in his 83-ball knock and raised 138 with opening partner Dravid to lay the foundation for a strong total. 

The Pakistan bowlers, sent on a leather chase for most part of the innings, staged a late comeback to claim the wickets of Dravid, Dhoni and Yuvraj that put the brakes on Indian scoring. 

India were off to a subdued start after Dravid won the toss and elected to bat again, conceding three maidens on the trot against the new ball duo of Asif and Rana Naved-ul Hasan (two for 45). 

It was Dravid who scored the first four, a wristy shot off Naved that raced down the gap between mid-on and mid-wicket. Sehwag followed suit, hitting Asif for two fours in an over. 

Sehwag, who looked determined, hit the same bowler for two more fours to regale the Indian supporters. 

The Delhi batsman completed his 21st ODI 50 and fifth against Pakistan with a single and raised his bat skywards to celebrate his return to form. 

After taking India to 100 in 20 overs, the duo opened up further, rendering all the bowlers ineffective in the process. Dravid also completed his 50 ? his 71st in ODIs and 13th against the arch rivals ? off 60 balls with the help of eight fours. 

Sehwag continued to provide ample entertainment, despatching Abdul Razzaq (who went for 33 in four overs) over long-off for a huge six. But just when he looked all set for three figures, he was ensnared by spinner Shahid Afridi. The ball crashed on to the stumps after beating the batsman comprehensively. 

Dhoni took over the baton and kept the scoreboard ticking with his improvised shot-making. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman reached his 50 off just 55 balls. His 90-run partnership with Dravid came to an end when the Indian skipper inside-edged an Asif delivery on to his stumps. 

On Tuesday night, Dravid said that the aim behind resting Sehwag in the first ODI was to ensure he stayed away from pressure and sorted out his batting before getting back to international cricket. 

Sehwag has played a lot of cricket. He is not in the best of form. Sometimes you need a mental and physical break, to stay away from the heat and allow yourself to relax, Dravid said after India by six wickets. 

Sehwag was not in Tuesdays playing XI despite having been shortlisted in the XII after Mondays team meeting. 

Dravid said it had been tough to bat early on at the virgin Zayed Stadium track but defended his decision to bat first. 

It was tough initially, but did not ease up too much later either. It was a fresh wicket and from what we had heard, getting runs first was the right thing to do. It was the right decision, but yes, we should have batted a little bit better. 

It would have been interesting to see how they chased if we had some 30-odd runs more on the board. A total of 230 would have been competitive. 

Dravid defended the performance of his bowlers, who gave away as many as 23 extras. We definitely needed to take more wickets while defending a modest score, but again I would rather say that we should have batted better to give a cushion of a competitive score to the bowlers. 

We needed someone to carry through till the end. Venugopal batted well. But a couple of run-outs did not help (there were four run-outs in the Indian innings). 

 As far as extras are concerned, 

 there were some leg byes but if you are trying to bowl wicket 

 to wicket, you will stray down the leg side sometimes. I 

 think they bowled quite well.

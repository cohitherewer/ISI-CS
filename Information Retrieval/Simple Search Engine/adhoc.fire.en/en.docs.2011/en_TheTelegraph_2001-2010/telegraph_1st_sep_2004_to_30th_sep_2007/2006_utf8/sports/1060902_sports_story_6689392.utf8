Calcutta: Jhuma Khatun captured her second meet record in three days at the State Athletics Championships, but was still unsatisfied. Bengals most promising young athlete won the girls under-20 800m in 2:11.9 to easily erase the previous mark of 2:14.3 at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

I was confident of getting the record, but wanted to clock about 2:09 The heat didnt help me, said the 18-year-old who has just bagged a job with Eastern Railway. 

Jhuma, whose height is a disadvantage, won the 1500m with a record time on Day I. The 800 is my favourite Whether I focus on one or do both in the future will depend on what my coach says, said Jhuma. 

Rahmatulla Molla and Ranjita Roy emerged the fastest man and woman of the meet. Rahmatulla covered the distance of 100 metres in a record 10.4 seconds, bettering the existing 10.5. Ranjita stopped the clock at 11.7. 

Three other meet records were rewritten on Friday Archana Mondal in womens discus, Anita Gurung in girls under-18 javelin, and Antara Khatun in girls under-16 pentathlon.

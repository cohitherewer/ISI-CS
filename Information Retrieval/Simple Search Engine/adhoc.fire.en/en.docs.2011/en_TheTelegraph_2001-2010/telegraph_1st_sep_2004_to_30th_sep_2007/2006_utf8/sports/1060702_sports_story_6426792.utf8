 Peeved legend leaves in a huff

 Berlin: Diego Maradona 

 was not in Berlins Olympiastadion to see Argentinas 

 World Cup quarter final defeat to Germany because a member 

 of his entourage was not allowed in, Fifa said on Saturday. 

 World soccers governing body said the iconic 

 former captain had been given four VIP tickets for the match, 

 which Argentina lost on penalties, but wanted to bring in 

 a fifth person whom Fifa had already declared was not welcome. 

It has been reported that Diego Maradona arrived at the stadium and then left again because not all of his entourage was allowed in, Fifa spokesman Markus Siegler said. 

This was the decision of Diego Maradona alone, Siegler said at news briefing. Siegler said Fifa had been touch with Maradona and the Spanish television station he is working for before the game. 

Maradonas delegation was told in advance that one particular person would not get a ticket because this person has been rude repeatedly during the World Cup and even became almost physically aggressive, he said. 

Were sorry if Diego Maradona didnt want to accept that. He and a certain number of companions are welcome at any time, he added. 

Siegler declined to identify the person Fifa had decided to exclude. 

 Weve always had tickets 

 for Diego Maradona, even if it was difficult sometimes because 

 he just turned up. We always found a solution for him, 

 Siegler said. The problem yesterday was that one person 

 was not on the list of names but wanted to come in.

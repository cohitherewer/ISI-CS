 Atwal makes cut

Harrison: Arjun Atwal managed to make the cut while Daniel Chopra missed out by a stroke at the Barclays Classic being held at the Westchester Country Club. 

Vijai Singh, winless so far this year on the US PGA Tour, was the joint leader with David Howell going into the weekend rounds after firing a flawless seven-under 64. 

Atwals even-par 71 on Saturday gave him a one-over tally of 143 and left him at tied 70th position. (PTI)

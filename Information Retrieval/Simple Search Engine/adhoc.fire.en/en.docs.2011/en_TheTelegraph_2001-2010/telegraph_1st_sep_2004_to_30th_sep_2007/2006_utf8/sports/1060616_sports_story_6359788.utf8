 Rooney changed complexion of game

 - Captain Beckham should take the lead in providing inspiration 

 when chips are down

 On Target 

 Shyam Thapa

 Wayne Rooney has been at the centre 

 of a tussle between England coach Sven-Goran 

 Eriksson and Manchester United. While club coach Alex Ferguson 

 has insisted that the strikers return from injury 

 should not be rushed, Eriksson has maintained he would have 

 the final say on the matter.

 So, when England were struggling 

 to penetrate a heavily-guarded Trinidad and Tobago fortress 

 on Thursday, with the ageing Michael Owen and the tall Peter 

 Crouch being rendered ineffective on the ground and in the 

 air, Eriksson had to fall back on his favourite striker. 

 His double-substitution in the 58th minute ? Rooney replacing 

 Owen and Aaron Lennon coming in place of defender Jammie 

 Carragher ? changed the game dramatically. 

 Rooneys arrival gave the 

 English attack a new dimension and made it faster. More 

 significantly, the tempo of the English team underwent a 

 sea-change. 

 Rooneys presence had a psychological 

 effect on the opponents as his speed, vision and running 

 in the gaps between defenders provided the English team 

 what it was missing in the first half. 

 He may not have scored, but Rooney 

 drew the defenders attention towards him, thereby 

 helping his teammates take advantage of open spaces. 

 Thus Crouch made amends of his 

 atrocious first-half miss by heading home following a trademark 

 David Beckham cross from the right in the 83rd minute. Gerrard 

 made the win more convincing with a thunderous left-footer 

 from about 30 yards, in injury time.

 The win helped England qualify 

 for the second round, but they need to raise their game 

 by a few notches and maintain the tempo with which they 

 played the 20-25 minutes of the match against Trinidad and 

 Tobago, if they dream of proceeding further. 

 A defensive-minded Trinidad and 

 Tobago helped England dominate proceedings, but the latter 

 were sans ideas till Rooneys arrival. Erikssons 

 side lost one plot after another soon after advancing to 

 the rival half-line and, with the midfield not intent on 

 shifting gears, the World Cup debutants had no problems 

 thwarting the English efforts. 

 I want to see Beckham more involved 

 as captain when the chips are down. In the first half, for 

 instance, he seemed to have taken a chair and stationed 

 himself on the right side ? never coming forward to help 

 the strikers or snatching the ball himself. Was he only 

 there for taking free-kicks and corners? He is a star and 

 should take the lead in inspiring the team. 

 His contribution in the first 

 half was a solitary good cross, which found Crouch absolutely 

 in the clear. All that the tall striker needed was just 

 to stop the ball and push it in. Instead, he volleyed it 

 wide. The English captains free-kicks were also ineffective. 

 Eriksson rightly put faith in 

 Crouch when he let Owen go, because of his tall stature. 

 In modern football, wing-play 

 is a key part of every coachs strategy and therefore, 

 tall strikers are always welcome. And the coach was proved 

 right in the end. That 83rd-minute effort was Crouch and 

 Becks only meaningful contribution in the match. 

 Gerrards strike was, however, 

 sheer individual brilliance. He scored two goals in similar 

 fashion in the FA Cup final against West Ham, whose goalkeeper 

 was Hislop. The Liverpool midfielder proved to be the Trinidad 

 and Tobago custodians nemesis once again.

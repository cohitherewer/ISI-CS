The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Notable Guest has edge over Aerona 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Imran Chisty is the man to follow in Wednesdays seven event card. The jockey may be seen at an advantage over favourites like Roofer, Poetic Moment, Astra Fields and Notable Guest.

 Speedster Notable Guest may, however, face strong challenge from Aerona in the feature event, the 1,100m Advertising Cup, a baby-race. If the Guest, a Daniel David-trainee, was a facile winner in his debut run, so was the Vijay Singh-trainee Aerona.

 The 1,200m Stringfellows Cup for horses in Class II may see Errol Bhungards Syrian Spice coming good in the hands of jockey G. Ross. The five-year-old mare was an unextended fifth behind Pure Valour who went on to strike again. 

 In his last outing, Roofer was witnessed covering nearing 100m in the final stretch to place an eye-catching third to Talent Unlimited. 

 Ignore Astra Fields last run. The Daniel-ward is looking far improved now.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

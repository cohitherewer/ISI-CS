The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Soca Warriors fans eyeing at least a win

 - Trinidad and Tobago immersed in World Cup spirit

Port-of-Spain: Be it on Calcutta Street in the St James area or the seemingly endless Savannah (Maidan) or even the lobby of the Hilton, where the Indian cricketers are staying, much of the talk is about Trinidad and Tobagos prospects in the soccer World Cup. 

In-flight magazines, too, have been devoting considerable space for what is about to unfold. Not to speak of the posters splashed across the bars waiting for an upswing in fortune. 

Christened Soca (a calypso spin-off) Warriors, the national team is making its debut in one of the toughest groups ? B, with England, Paraguay and Sweden. Boy, we arent looking to win the World Cup... Were looking for one win, bubbly Trini Cecil Frederick, agency manager for Alcico, told The Telegraph. That reflects the sentiment in these parts. 

With the World Cup less than a fortnight away, its difficult to miss the nationalistic fervour. Its quite common, for example, to find four-wheel drives and the Elantras and the latest from the Nissan stable to fly the countrys flag. Thats one way of support. 

Its also a time for the businesswallahs to make money ? incidentally, thanks to the oil boom, theres quite a bit around. 

Soca Warriors T-shirts and other souvenirs have flooded the malls. The lowest priced T-shirt is in the region of (US) $ 15. Expectedly, corporate houses have jumped on to the bandwagon, with promotionals linked to the World Cup. 

Its like killing two birds with one stone ? identifying with a national cause and, obviously, making a few million, remarked somebody who didnt wish to be quoted. Whatever, coach Leo Beenhakker (a Dutchman) and captain Dwight Yorke cant be unhappy. 

The Soca Warriors first match, against Sweden, is in Dortmund on June 10. 

Footnote: Trinidad, in particular, is the home of the electrifying steel bands. Given the mood, theyre currently fine-tuning for the World Cup. Starlight Steel Orchestra and the Renegades are among the more in-demand ones.

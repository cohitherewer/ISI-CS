 IN THE CITY

 Three records were rewritten on the opening day of the State Aquatics Championships at the Rishra Swimming Club (RSC) on Thursday.

 Monalisa Mondal bettered her own 100m breaststroke timing set in 2005, while Sumanta Nath sank his own 100 backstroke mark in the heats. Sumanta went on to win the finals, without touching the state record. Both Monalisa and Sumanta are from RSC.

 The other record was set by Hooghlys 4x100 medley relay quartet. Rana Pratap Samanta, Sumanta, Aukik Das and Somyajit Mukherjee bettered South 24 Parganas 2004 mark.

 Soumyajit won two more events on Thursday the 200 and 400 freestyle.

 The CFL first division group B fixture between Victoria SC and Anushilani was a non-starter because there wasnt enough time to complete the game. Both teams and match officials reached the venue on time only to find the Howrah Stadium gate locked. By the time the gate was opened and the teams were ready to start after warming up, it was 3.55 pm 40 minutes past scheduled kick-off. The referee felt there wasnt enough time to complete the 90-minute game and blew the whistle.

 Too early to comment on Sachin: More

Mumbai: Chief selector Kiran More said Monday it was premature to say whether Sachin Tendulkar would be available for the four-Test series against the West Indies. 

Its too early to say anything on Sachins fitness. Its for team physio John Gloster and Sachin to judge. Hes already started light work-outs. We will give him the opportunity to test his fitness. But I cannot say more, he said. 

More also expressed happiness with Wasim Jaffers progress and informed Ashish Nehra had started bowling. (PTI)

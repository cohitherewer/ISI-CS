The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Akhmedov blames it on goalie Shilton

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India under-20 coach Islam Akhmedov blamed his goalkeeper Shilton Paul for the 2-3 defeat to Jordan, which has put them on the brink of an early exit from the AFC Youth Championship. 

Thanks to the goalkeepers mistakes, we lost the match. The second and third goals were absolutely unnecessary Shilton put us down, the Uzbek told the post-match press confer-ence. 

Akhmedov admitted that he shared his responsibility as coach for the display, which he described as bad. 

I thought the boys would derive motivation from their show against Kyrgyzstan. But it was not the case I know it will be very difficult against South Korea, he added. 

India gave us a tough fight. But we had to dig deep into our players resources to find the winner, Jordan coach Jan Poul Sen said. 

India senior coach Bob Houghton, who watched the match, later pointed out that the tall and strong physiques of Jordan players proved to be the deciding factor. He, however, hinted that some of the boys might feature in his future scheme of things.

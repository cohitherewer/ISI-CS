Calcutta: These are difficult times for East Bengal and for coach Carlos Roberto Pereira. 

After their lacklustre performance in the Durand Cup and IFA Shield, the city giants flopped again; this time, in the Peerless 28th Federation Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

The 0-1 quarter final loss to the Durand Cup champions, Dempo Sports Club, not only dashed the hopes of thousands of red and gold supporters who thronged to see the floodlit encounter, but also has put a question mark on the Brazilian coachs future with the club ahead of their sojourn in the 11th National Football League (NFL) starting in January. 

But this is football as a nonchalant Pereira reacted and signed off: I just hope so, when wished luck ahead of NFL. East Bengal, by the way, are the runners-up in NFL; but that was last season. 

In absence of their regular captain Alvito DCunha who suffered an ankle injury during their last match the replacement (Debabrata Roy) looked flat, and their attack missing out on golden chances. 

Incidentally, Debabrata was replaced right after the changeover by Fredy Mascarenhas. The substitute, in fact, would consider himself unlucky after his brilliant effort went in vain in the 84th minute. Showing a perfect acrobatic display, Fredy produced a bicycle kick to right of the goalpost. But a watchful V.P. Satish Kumar stretched towards his right, denying the city club what would have been a spectacular goal. 

At a time when it seemed that the match would advance into the extra time, Ranti Martins stunned the partisan crowd off a rebound in the 86th minute to settle the issue 1-0 and seal Dempos semi-final berth. 

In fact, it was captain Roberto Silva who set up the goal. Robertos dodge from extreme right was parried by East Bengal custodian Naseem Akhtar. A hungry-looking Ranti was following the ball closely when the rebound came in from Naseem. Having missed a couple of chances in the first-half, Ranti was spot on this time to slam home the winner. 

That was enough to ignite the fans who began hurling bottles (and abuses) towards club officials sitting in the stands. 

Earlier, both teams failed to convert their chances in a goalless first-half, laced with few close shaves, which also included two yellow cards (Clifford Miranda of East Bengal and Anupam Sarkar of Dempo Sports Club). 

If in the eighth minute Ranti Martins left-footer from 25 yards ballooned over the goalpost, minutes later East Bengals Dipankar Roy had enough chance to draw the first blood but he seemed out of touch as his shot was way off target. 

If that was not enough, Debabrata missed two back to back chances in the 17th and 21st minute. First he failed to score off a solitary effort before squandering a golden chance from Izumi Arata cross. 

Dempo now await the result of Sundays Mohun Bagan-Churchill Brothers clash for their last four line up. For coach Armando Colaco, both teams appear equally strong. 

We just have to keep up our momentum going, without taking any team lightly, Colaco said.

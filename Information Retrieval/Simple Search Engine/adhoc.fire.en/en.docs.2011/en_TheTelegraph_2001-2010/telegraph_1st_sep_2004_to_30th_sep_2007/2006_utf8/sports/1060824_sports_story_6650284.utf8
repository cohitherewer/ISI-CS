 Wasim Raja dies with boots on

 - Pakistan loses a gentleman cricketer 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Pakistan lost one of its gentlemen cricketers, Wasim 

 Raja, at a time when present captain Inzaman-ul Haq stands 

 accused of ungentlemanly conduct. 

Wasim, 54, died with his boots on playing in an over-50 competition in Surrey on Wednesday afternoon. 

 Hed just bowled two-three 

 overs and began complaining of uneasiness He collapsed 

 on the field itself, succumbing to a massive heart attack, 

 a sobbing Rameez, his younger brother, told The Telegraph. 

Rameez, who is with his family in Manchester, added: As you can understand, were in a state of shock 

An elegant left-hander and a useful bowler, Wasim played 57 Tests and 54 ODIs. 

He also coached Pakistan for a brief while after the 1999 World Cup and served as an ICC Elite Panel Match Referee for two years from 2002. 

 Wasim had, for a number of years, been teaching and 

 coaching in Surrey. 

 Agencies add: Wasim also 

 played for Durham in County cricket. In Pakistan, he represented 

 Punjab, National Bank, Pakistan International Airlines, 

 Sargodha and Combined Universities. 

After retiring, Wasim settled down in England and became a professor of English. 

Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, while condoling his death, said: It is very sad and heart-breaking news. As a teenager, I used to go and watch all the games in which Wasim Raja used to play. 

He was a crowd favourite not only because of his hard-hitting abilities but because he was so charismatic. He was an idol for youngsters in the 70s and 80s, he added. 

Javed Miandad, who played alongside Wasim, was shattered by the news. 

 We grew together and played 

 our cricket not only as teammates but also as opponents. 

 He was not only a true sportsman, but a thorough gentleman. 

 We have been involved in some of the best matches. It is 

 sad to lose a great cricketer, a good sportsman and a true 

 ambassador of the country, he said.

 Death on field

 Wasim Rajas on-pitch death 

 during an over-50 match in Surrey on Wednesday was the fifth 

 instance of a cricketer dying on the field. The following 

 is a list of the other four: 

 ABDUL AZIZ: The only instance 

 in first-class cricket occurred when 17-year-old Abdul Aziz 

 died during the final of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy in 1958-59 

 between Karachi and Services. Aziz tried to play forward 

 to an off-spinner when the ball rose sharply and hit him 

 in the chest above the heart. He collapsed and was declared 

 dead on arrival at the hospital. The score book entry against 

 his name reads: 1st innings retired hurt 0; 2nd innings 

 absent dead 0. This is, mercifully, the only time such an 

 entry has been made in a first-class match.

 ANDY DUCAT: Died of a 

 heart attack while batting in a club match at Lords 

 in July 1942.

 RAMAN LAMBA: Died at the 

 age of 38 after being hit on the head while fielding at 

 forward short-leg during a club match in Dhaka in February 

 1998.

 WILF SLACK: The Middlesex 

 and England left-handed opener, collapsed and died at the 

 age of 34 while batting in Banjul, capital of The Gambia, 

 in January 1989. He had suffered four blackouts either on 

 the field or at nets in the two previous years, but exhaustive 

 tests had failed to identify what was wrong. Note: GF Summers 

 of Notts was hit on the head during a match against Middlesex 

 at Lords in 1870. He died a few days later.

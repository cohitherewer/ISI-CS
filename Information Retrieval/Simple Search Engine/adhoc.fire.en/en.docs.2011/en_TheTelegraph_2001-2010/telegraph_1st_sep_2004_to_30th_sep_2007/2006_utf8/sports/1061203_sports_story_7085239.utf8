Yousufs feat is commendable and all of Pakistan is proud of his world record achievements, said Imran of Yousuf, who scored 665 runs in three Tests to help Pakistan beat the West Indies 2-0. 

It is not just the amount of runs and records, its the elegance and the class of his batting which stands out and helped him achieve those records, said Imran.

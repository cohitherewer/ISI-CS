 Zaheer optimistic about making a comeback

New Delhi: As his name does the rounds as one of the probables for the Champions Trophy, left-arm paceman Zaheer Khan says he is optimistic of earning a call-up for the premier one-day competition. 

After missing out on the home series against England, the tour of the West Indies and the forthcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka, Zaheer, is currently plying his trade for English County Worcestershire. 

I was very disappointed not to be picked for the England series, but Ive left that behind. Thats why I have decided to come here (Worcestershire) and perform. My answer to everything is performance. Ive just decided to keep performing, said the Baroda seamer. 

I was expecting a recall for the Sri Lanka series but things didnt happen, he said. 

However, the left-arm paceman, has not given up and is patiently biding his time. 

You just have to be patient. The good thing is, I have more matches here to stay in touch. The Champions Trophy and the South Africa tour are two big series that I am gearing up for, he told a magazine.

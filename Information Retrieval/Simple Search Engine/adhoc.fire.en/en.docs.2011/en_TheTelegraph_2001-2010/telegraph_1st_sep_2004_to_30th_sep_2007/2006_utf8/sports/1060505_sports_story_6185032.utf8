 We need to overcome the jinx: Srinath

 - Former India pacer says WI will be tough to beat under Lara 

 Jawagal Srinath 

Jaipur: Jawagal Srinath on Thursday said Rahul Dravids India will feel the weight of history as they attempt to record their first victory in the West Indies in 35 years. 

The former pacer, however, added that the current Indian team can be expected to break the jinx of not winning a series in the West Indies since their maiden triumph in 1971. 

We can do well there, but we need to overcome the jinx, Srinath, in the city to scout talent for MRF PaceFoundation, said. 

Srinath said the tour would be a good recce for the Indians ahead of next years World Cup. 

The tour comes at the right time as we will be playing there in the World Cup. We may face some of the same guys, too. Under Brian Lara they will be tough to beat, but once we overcome the jinx, which haunts us, we will do well, he said. 

The former bowling spearhead said Sachin Tendulkar had matured with age and he could pull through with his experience and extraordinary talent for a few more years. 

Right now, Dhoni is doing what Sachin used to do early on. Age certainly has an effect. Sachin, too, has matured with age, but he can carry on based on his experience and talent alone, he said. 

Asked why India was not able to produce a genuine fast bowler like Pakistans Shoaib Akhtar or Australias Brett Lee, Srinath said the current bunch of pacers were quite up to the mark. 

Look, now we have a bunch of real quick bowlers. Munaf is bowling at 140-145 km per hour and the rest like Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth and the others are not too far behind, he said. 

Srinath felt Munaf was the best among the current lot. Munaf needs more experience before being infused into the one-dayers, he said. 

Srinath also batted for V V S Laxman and Virender Sehwag. 

Regarding Sehwag, how can you question a guy who averages 50 plus. He should be asked to play without any pressure and perhaps the team management is doing the same thing, he said. 

On the burnout issue, Srinath said those who felt load was too much, should take a break. I did it myself. When I felt the load, I took a break. 

Srinath also said he did not think it would be difficult to get back into the team after a layoff. Even if a replacement does well, he should be asked to wait if the player returns to the side, he said.

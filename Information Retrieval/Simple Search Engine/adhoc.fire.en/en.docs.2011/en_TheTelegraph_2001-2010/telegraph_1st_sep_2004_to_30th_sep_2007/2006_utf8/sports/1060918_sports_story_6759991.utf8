 Pinki 7th 

Athens: Indian athletes failed to shine for the Asian team as both shot putter Navpreet Singh and middle distance runner Pinki Pramanik finished seventh in their respective events at the IAAF World Cup on Saturday. 

Pinki, could not capitalise on a slow two-lap race and got stuck in the racing pack for a long time. 

In the mens shot put, Navpreet heaved the iron to a distance of 18.43m to finish way down the standings in seventh place at the Athens Olympic Stadium.

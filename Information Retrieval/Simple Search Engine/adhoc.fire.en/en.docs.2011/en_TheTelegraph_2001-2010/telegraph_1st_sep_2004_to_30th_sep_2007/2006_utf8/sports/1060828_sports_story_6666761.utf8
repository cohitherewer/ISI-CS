 Woolmer hits back at Jarman

London: Bob Woolmer has hit back at former Match Referee Barry Jarman, saying the Australians charge that South Africans tampered ball under his coaching during a limited-overs match against India were a piece of fiction. 

Im the coach. What does he think that I teach ball scratching, Woolmer said. 

I just do not understand why Barry Jarman has said this, he was quoted as saying. 

Jarman has accused Woolmers South Africa of lifting the seam and scratching their ball with their fingernails but said he simply got the ball changed and did not take the issue any further.I dont ever remember a ball being taken off after the 16th over. I surely would have remembered it. Go and ask the two umpires in the game Im supposed to have done this. They will say they dont know anything about it, he said.

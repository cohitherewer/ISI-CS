The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Manik Chandra Mondal, a long distance swimmer, will try to cross the English Channel during the first week of July. Mondal had been selected by the Channel Swimming and Piloting Federation last year, but couldn?t make the trip owing to a financial crunch. He has been invited this year also, but is not certain whether his dreams would be fulfilled. ?I have made up my mind that this time, I won?t let the opportunity go. But funds are still the problem,? he told The Telegraph. 

 A product of the orphanage Children?s Home, Mondal is a resident of East Midnapore and has participated in state and national level swimming competitions. Having completed his higher secondary, the 28-year-old swimmer is on the lookout for a kind soul who will make his dreams come true this time.

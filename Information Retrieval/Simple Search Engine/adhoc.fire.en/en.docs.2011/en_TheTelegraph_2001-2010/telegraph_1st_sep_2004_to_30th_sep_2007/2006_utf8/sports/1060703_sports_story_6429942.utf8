The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A sad day... we will overcome this: Ronaldo 

Frankfurt: Brazilian players didnt even try to find excuses for their World Cup elimination. They just praised France and admitted they were outplayed. 

France is a team very good technically. They came well set up and were very patient, Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said. They deserved to win. 

Its a difficult moment to be eliminated when we were so close to the semi-finals and final, Parreira added. I did not prepare for this and no one in our delegation prepared for this. 

The same applies to the millions of Brazilians who were expecting yet another World Cup triumph. Its an enormous sadness especially after a long period in which weve become used to winning all the competitions? I wanted to make Brazil champions, Ronaldinho said. Now its time to put our feet on the ground and start thinking about whats next and Brazils future, said the playmaker, who took over from Zidane as Fifa World Player of the Year. 

Ronaldinho was the only member of Brazils magic quartet who didnt score at the World Cup. 

Its a sad day for us, though we will overcome this, said striker Ronaldo, who leaves the World Cup as the tournaments all-time leading scorer with 15 goals. They played better and deserved the victory. 

France captain Zinedine Zidane, headed into retirement after the tournament, served a free-kick to Thierry Henry, who volleyed the only goal of the match into the roof of the net. 

Zidane is a player we knew well ... he created a lot of troubles, Parreira said. He played very well and gave the decisive pass to Henry. He made the difference, even more than in 1998, Parreira said. 

Hes a great player and had a great match. It was unfortunate to us that he played this well today, Brazil midfielder Kaka added after the match. 

Technically, we have a very good team, very experienced. But when you dont win the title, its because there has been something missing, the Brazil coach said. We are frustrated right now, but Im certain Brazil will shine again? Brazilian soccer is still very powerful. 

We had some problems, and we needed a little more preparation, probably in terms of fitness and getting the team to play as a unit, Parreira added. 

Only against Japan, when Parreira fielded five reserve players to rest some of the regular starters, Brazil were able to display some of the flair many expect from the five-time champions. 

That was the right decision for that match, Parreira reasoned. We cant assume that if I had played the same team again we wouldve won it. 

Brazil president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva telephoned Parreira after the loss to express his condolences. Despite the sadness, lots of Brazilians back home say they will now root for former colonial power Portugal, which defeated England earlier on Saturday to qualify for a semi-final match against France. 

Portugals coach is Luiz Felipe Scolari, a Brazilian who won the 2002 World Cup as Brazils coach.

 Player of the Day

 ZINEDINE ZIDANE

 Sporting golden boots, French midfielder Zinedine Zidane 

 dished out yet another dream performance to throw firm favourites 

 Brazil out of the World Cup. This was another masterpiece 

 in midfield artistry and footballing intelligence. Some 

 of his touches were so sublime and throughs so cutting that 

 it even left the highly skilful Brazil defence completely 

 stranded. Overall, Zidane was certainly the most influential 

 player of the French team, with amazing footwork and exquisite 

 passing.

 One the eve of the tournament, there was talk and criticism 

 about Zidanes decision to make a comeback to international 

 football and it was widely speculated that the three-time 

 Fifa Player of the Year award winner could be a flop in 

 his swansong meet. The murmurs grew when he failed to showcase 

 his class in the opening match against Switzerland. Then 

 Zidane decided to turn the clock around and silence his 

 critics. Since then he has improved in every match and his 

 best came against Brazil.

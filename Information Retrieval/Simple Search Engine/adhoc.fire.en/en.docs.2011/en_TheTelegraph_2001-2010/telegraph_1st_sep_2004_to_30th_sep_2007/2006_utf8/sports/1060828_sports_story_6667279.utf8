 Match Referee shouldve intervened, says Shastri

New Delhi: The International Cricket Council (ICC) should learn from the ball tampering row involving Pakistan and entrust its Match Referees with more powers to ensure such unpleasant incidents do not occur again, former India captain Ravi Shastri said. 

Shastri also expressed surprise at the passive role played by Match Referee Mike Procter in the entire episode which could have been avoided with a more common sense approach. 

I thought here the Match Referee could have played a bigger role in communicating. He could have stepped in a lot earlier, Shastri said referring to Pakistans controversial forfeiture of the fourth Test against England last week. 

[Another ex-captain Kapil Dev expressed similar thoughts two days ago when he told The Telegraph that he was disappointed Procter didnt play as big a role as he should have.] 

He should have got the conversation going in a much better way, in the sense that once tea time, he should have got Inzamam-ul Haq and spoken to him, the veteran of 80 Tests and 150 one-dayers said. 

This was a case where ego and personality should have been kept aside. It needed a common sense approach. Why do you have a Match Referee? When there is a controversy, it is for him to step in and create a dialogue, and that didnt happen there. 

Shastri said that if he had been in Inzamams place, there wouldnt have been any question of the game continuing once the umpire charged his team with ball tampering. 

I would have put up a morcha there only. (PTI)

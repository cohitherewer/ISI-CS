 Beto plots Bagan downfall in semis 

 - Durand Cup

 - Drama in maroon-green camp after being outplayed by Dempo

 Beto, besides scoring the first goal, teased and tormented 

 the Mohun Bagan defence

New Delhi: Two years ago, on a fateful November evening in Bangalore, Brazilian striker Cristiano Juniors brilliant efforts guided Dempo Sports Club to their maiden Federation Cup triumph, at Mohun Bagans expense. 

On Saturday, at the Ambedkar Stadium, it was the turn of another Brazilian Roberto Beto De Silva to show Mohun Bagan the exit door and take the Goan club to its first ever Durand final. 

The vociferous bunch of Mohun Bagan fans, who slipped out of the ground quietly, would surely agree that Biswajit Bhattacharyas side was lucky to escape with just a 0-2 defeat. 

Man-of-the-Match Beto put Dempo ahead in the 20th minute. For the rest of the game, he teased and tormented the Mohun Bagan defence. It was a personal triumph for the Brazilian, who was discarded by Mohun Bagan only last year. 

Dempo assistant coach Maurice Afonso said his team played the seasons best match on Saturday. For Mohun Bagan, it was perhaps the other way round. 

A disjointed midfield and a completely non-existent forwardline left Dempo goalkeeper Satish Kumar the least harassed man on the ground. 

Barretos sudden dip in form hurt Mohun Bagan. The Brazilian did not look fit enough to play the kind of penetrative soccer he is capable of, strolling around the ground for most of the second half. None of his colleagues could take the extra responsibility on an afternoon when the teams best player struggled to get any rhythm. 

Dempo shot into the lead when Nigerian Ranty Martins forward pass found Beto a few yards outside the box. Beto took a firm shot that bounced before beating goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee. The odd bounce may have surprised Mukherjee, but he should have shown better judgement. 

With Mohun Bagan coming up with very few positive attacks, the Dempo midfielders had a gala time. While Beto played like a midfield general, Clifford Miranda tore open the Mohun Bagan defence time and again with his runs down the flanks. 

Martins and Anthony Pereira, too, played with a lot of purpose. The duo, in fact, cracked the Mohun Bagan citadel a second time. As Martins free-kick in the 73rd minute hit the wall and dropped into the box, Pereira appeared from nowhere to flick the ball to the net. 

The Mohun Bagan coach tried various combinations, including pushing Eduardo Coelho upfront, but none worked. 

 The only time Mohun Bagan looked like scoring was 

 in the 32nd minute when Barreto ran into the box before 

 being brought down by John Dias. The referee ignored the 

 incident. So pathetic was Mohun Bagans showing rest 

 of the match, none in the Mohun Bagan camp raised the topic 

 of the denied penalty.

 Topalov faces 3-year ban

 - Fide pulls up Bulgarian for linking Kramnik to KGB 

 Topalov

Moscow: The international chess federation (Fide) could disqualify Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria for three years for violating the code of ethics by linking Russian Grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik to the KGB in an interview to a Spanish newspaper. 

Kramniks manager Carsten Hensel has lodged a complaint with Fide against the Bulgarian chess master, who in an interview said the world champion was aided by those not involved with chess at the recent world championships at Elista near here. 

Topalov had also accused the Russian of cheating by taking frequent toilet breaks during the same championship. 

People from outside who were Russians and were far from the world of chess helped Kramnik. These were either amateurs or people from the secret services, Topalov said in the interview. 

They were the ones who placed the Internet cable in Kramniks toilet, he added. 

Topalov also said he feared for his life while in Elista and would never go to Russia again. 

Nobody from Kramniks team was involved in that, thats why they deny the whole thing, he said. 

Topalov suspected Fide president Kirsan Ilymzhinov was also involved in the plot because he was a businessman who was obeying orders because there had to be a Russian champion. 

Hensel said he had always respected and liked Topalov and was disappointed by the Bulgarians claims. There was no possibility in Kramniks toilet for a cable to be installed because security measures in Elista were very severe and all wireless devices were strictly forbidden, he said. 

The controversy, however, could blow over with Hensel learning that the interview with Topalov was only published online and did not appear in the print version of the newspaper. (PTI)

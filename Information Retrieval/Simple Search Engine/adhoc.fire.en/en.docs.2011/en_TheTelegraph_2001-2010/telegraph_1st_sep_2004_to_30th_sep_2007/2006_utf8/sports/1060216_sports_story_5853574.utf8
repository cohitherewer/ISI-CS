The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its all about self-belief

 - I grew up idolising Srinath paaji and Allan Donald: Sreesanth 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Sreesanth

 Multan: Sreesanth may not have been very successful 

 on this tour, but his approach and style has come in for 

 a lot of appreciation from former Pakistani pacers. Only 

 the other day, Sarfraz Nawaz felt the youngster could develop 

 into a very good fast-cum-stock bowler. Sreesanth spoke 

 to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the series. 

 Following are excerpts:

 On how he assesses his performance 

 in international cricket so far

 I realise I should have done much 

 better. I think I was a bit over excited and not focusing 

 enough in the initial stages. I have noticed from footages 

 before this tour that I wasnt concentrating enough 

 on the fifth/sixth balls of an over. As a result, the loose 

 balls were getting punished. 

 I have spoken to Dennis Lillee 

 on this aspect, and he has advised me to focus ball by ball. 

 He told me that I was striving for extra pace, and should 

 concentrate on the basics. I am more mature now and am confident 

 that I will improve with time.

 On what experience has taught 

 him

 Do your own stuff, take it as 

 any other game, and dont overreact to situations. 

 That I should persist with my own performance and try and 

 be consistent. 

 On his most memorable performance

 The day Sachin paaji handed 

 me the India cap in Nagpur where I made my debut versus 

 Sri Lanka. He is like god to me. This I what I had aimed 

 for, and when it happened, I didnt know what to do. 

 My first wicket (Dilhara Lokuhettige in the same match) 

 will also remain memorable. 

 I remember during the pre-season 

 conditioning camp in Bangalore I was just going through 

 the motions. It took me almost a week to realise that I 

 was into big time cricket. I remained dazed for almost a 

 week after the initial announcement that I was in the squad. 

 On coach Greg Chappells 

 message

 Greg has told me 

 to concentrate on the basics and have self-belief. That 

 while bowling at nets I should imagine myself going through 

 match situations. This will develop self-belief and help 

 in planning exactly what you want to do. The confidence 

 will naturally develop and that will breed success.

 On whether he has received 

 advice from any Pakistan pacer

 Earlier this year 

 when Waqar Younis was in India for the veterans meet, I 

 went up to him. He told me that my run-up and action were 

 good and that I should use more of the crease to be more 

 successful. The yorkers seem to be working as per his suggestion.

 I would have loved to meet Wasim 

 Akram and Imran Khan, but that hasnt happened till 

 date. However, I have got some advice from Sarfraz during 

 a reception at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.

 On any Pakistan pacer whom 

 he admires

 I was a big fan 

 of Akram. I liked his style, his action, his ability to 

 play on the batsmans mind, the way he swung the ball 

 both ways? I havent seen much of Imran, though. I 

 grew up idolising Srinath paaji and Allan Donald.

 On whether responsibility 

 has added to pressure

 Pressure is always 

 going to be there? Its part and parcel of international 

 cricket. I have done well under pressure. Its all 

 about self-belief? I now know its a mind game out 

 there. 

 On any childhood memories 

 of Pakistan cricket

 In the 1996 World 

 Cup, I was a ball boy at the Chinnaswamy Stadium during 

 the India-Pakistan quarter final match. I was studying in 

 Bangalore and played junior cricket at the KSCA. That famous 

 win and the way Ajay Jadeja took 22 runs off one Waqar over 

 during the closing stages, will always remain etched in 

 memory.

 On whether he had any special 

 preparation for the ongoing Pakistan tour

 I did more of spot 

 bowling and practised wicket-to-wicket. It was more of off-season 

 stuff since there werent enough matches being played. 

 On whether he is concentrating 

 enough on his batting

 Not really? I started 

 off as a batsman and have faith in my abilities. I am concentrating 

 more on bowling since that is my prime motivation now. 

 On what he hopes to learn 

 from this tour

 The mere thought 

 of an India-Pakistan contest excites me? I have heard so 

 much about it? Now that Ive got a real feel of it, 

 I wish to utilise this experience in the future.

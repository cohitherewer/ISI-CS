 Two-under takes Arjun to tied 18th

Sanya (China): Arjun Singh started off well at the Volkswagen Masters China after carding a respectable two-under 70 on the opening day, which placed him tied 18th on the leaderboard. 

The Indian was seven behind the leader, Chinese Taipeis veteran Lu Wen-teh who eclipsed major champions Michael Campbell of New Zealand and South African Retief Goosen with a stunning nine-under-par 63 for the first round lead. 

Lu had 10 birdies and one bogey at the Yalong Bay Golf Club. 

The 43-year-old was leading by one stroke from title-holder Goosen and Campbell, who returned matching 64s in the $300,000 Asian Tour event. 

I got off to a slow start and suddenly I made three birdies in a row (from the fourth), said Goosen. But I played the par fives poorly in one under and lost a few shots. 

Digvijay Singh, trying to get a card for next season, shot the same as Arjun to be at two-under for tied 18th. 

Amandeep Johl (72) was placed on tied 37th spot as the projected cut was at one-over. Sujjan Singh and Gurbaaz Mann shot two-over 74 each and were tied at the 74th place, while Harinder Gupta (75) was tied 91st. 

Arjun Singh had five birdies, three on front nine and two on the back nine, with three bogeys in all. 

Digvijay was even more steady with three birdies, two of them in the first three holes and then just one bogey on the sixth. His back nine was a flawless one-under. 

Englands Yasin Ali, tied sixth in the Taiwan Open last week, extended his rich vein of form with a 66, while Scott Strange of Australia, Malaysias Danny Chia and Chinas Huang Ming-jie were a further shot back. (PTI)

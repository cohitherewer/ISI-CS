 I may never play cricket again, says Vaughan

 London: Michael 

 Vaughan, who has already been ruled out of this years 

 Ashes series in Australia, has said it is possible he may 

 never play again. I have real hope Ill get better. 

 Ill do all the hard work and I believe therell 

 be another day when Michael Vaughan takes the field in an 

 England cricket shirt. 

But I have to be realistic. Ive read I might never play cricket again ? and that might well turn out to be the case, he was quoted as saying in the British media on Sunday. 

There are no guarantees. I know that better than anyone, added Vaughan, who attended Englands sparkling second Test win over Pakistan at Old Trafford on Saturday on crutches. There is an area of the knee thats very worn ? and there was a split in the cartilage. They tell me the operation has been successful but theyll only know for certain after rehab. 

What is certain is that whether I play cricket again or not I am going to need a total knee replacement in 15 years. 

Vaughan, who led England as they clinched the Ashes for the first time in 18 years in 2005, is recovering from having a fourth operation on his injured right knee on July 3. The ECB said he would be targeting a return early in 2007 with a view to being available for the World Cup in the Caribbean in March. 

However, 31-year-old Vaughan was still holding out hope that he may play some part in the Ashes series which starts with the first Test in Brisbane on November 23. 

I have to have a go. I have another three weeks on crutches and then, around September 22 ? 12 weeks after the operation ? Ill try to start a little light running, he was quoted as saying on Sunday. If all goes well, my aim is to be playing some kind of cricket in late December or early January.

 Injured Vieri ruled out

Milan: Monaco striker Christian Vieri and Sampdoria defender Aimo Diana have been ruled out of Italys World Cup squad due to injuries, Italy coach Marcello Lippi said on Tuesday. 

Vieri will undergo a surgery on his left knee after suffering an injury during a game against Paris St German in March while Diana has been sidelined with a groin injury. 

Lippi will announce his final squad of 23 players on May 15, a week before the squad begins its pre-World Cup training camp. 

I have very clear ideas about my squad and a few injuries have contributed to clarifying the position, Lippi told the Italian news agency on Tuesday. 

Vieri has an operation on his knee and wont be available while Diana has a serious groin injury that wont be right in time and so he wont be able to be called up.

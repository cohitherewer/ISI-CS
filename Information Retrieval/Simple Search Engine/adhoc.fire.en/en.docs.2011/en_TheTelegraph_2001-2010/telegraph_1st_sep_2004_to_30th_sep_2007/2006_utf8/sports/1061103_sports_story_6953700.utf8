The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shoaib, Asif ducked final session 

 - Ban-slapping tribunal found PCB, too, wanting 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mohammed Asif and Shoaib 

 Akhtar

Calcutta: Anticipating the worst, perhaps, neither Shoaib Akhtar nor Mohammed Asif returned to the Gaddafi on Wednesday evening for one last session with the three-man tribunal (actually the Anti-Doping Commission) before it went public with its judgement. 

Headed by Shahid Hamid, the tribunal had former captain and coach Intikhab Alam and Dr Waqar Ahmad as ordinary members. It was put together by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) within days of the speed merchants testing positive for the banned nandrolone. 

Both players had come earlier in the day and were then asked to return at 6.30 pm... Neither turned up and, so, it was left to Dr Sohail Saleem (whod been assisting the tribunal) to convey the bad news over the telephone, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on the morning after. 

The tribunal had asked Shoaib and Asif to make another appearance in order to convey its ruling in a face-to-face session. All three members felt that the players should know the judgement before it was conveyed to the world, the source added from Lahore. 

Both, apparently, heard the devastating news from Dr Saleem in silence. While Shoaib has been banned for two years, Asif cant play any cricket for 12 months beginning October 15. 

Meanwhile, in giving its ruling, the tribunal hasnt spared the PCB. It has, for example, stated the following: We are not entirely satisfied with the manner in which the PCB has advised and cautioned its players with regard to prohibited substances, the adverse effects of their use and the anti-doping regulations. We found much passing the buck between the officials who appeared before us... 

We are firmly of the view that the PCB needs to have a qualified and experienced sports (medicine) doctor whenever the team is on tour... We are also of the view that periodic guidance must be provided to the players... 

Its a rap on the knuckles, no less.

 Hemlata helps India take lead

 First Test

 London: A patient knock 

 of 69 by Hemlata Kala was instrumental in Indian eves securing 

 a handy 75-run lead on first innings against their England 

 counterparts on the third day of the first womens 

 Test at Leicester on Thursday.

 Kalas innings came off 179 

 balls and it pushed the Indian first innings to 298. She 

 prolonged the Indian batting effort by putting up valuable 

 partnerships with the tailenders, thus frustrating the hosts. 

 England had managed 223 in their first essay.

 In their second innings, England 

 were 170 for two, an overall lead of 95.

 Laura Newton played a useful hand 

 of 85 while Claire Taylor was batting on 74. They added 

 155 runs for the second wicket to help their team out of 

 a potentially precarious situation.

 England would need to carry on 

 their solid batting performance on the final day on Friday 

 to keep Indian eves at bay. (PTI)

 Pak not to play Abu Dhabi meet

Abu Dhabi: Pakistan have refused to play in a proposed tri-series involving India and Australia in September here, following which Abu Dhabi might lose its host status to North America. 

Pakistan have said they will be arriving late from their England tour and then with the Ramadan it will be difficult for them to play in the proposed tournament, said Inderjit Singh Bindra. 

The former BCCI president said India and Australia were looking at the series as a build-up for the Champions Trophy but now they might oblige the West Indies to raise funds after they helped Asia win the bid. (PTI)

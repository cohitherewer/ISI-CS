 Mukesh Kumar to sell home to set up academy

 Nagpur: Olympian Mukesh 

 Kumar has decided to sell off his residence to part-finance 

 his proposed hockey academy which is to be set up in Hyderabad. 

The Hyderabad-based former forward, who converted the crucial penalty stroke in the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok, enabling India to win gold, is in the process of acquiring a five-acre plot for setting up a standard hockey coaching facility, which requires Rs 28 lakh. 

As part of the funding, he will dispose off his own house which would fetch him Rs 18 lakh. 

This was revealed by Mukesh himself while felicitating five city-based meritorious sports persons at a function organised by the Sports Journalists Association of Nagpur (SJAN) in association with Nagpur Municipal Corporation here on Thursday. 

Mukesh said he was looking for a partner in his venture and would share the name of the partner for the proposed academy. 

Mukesh ? who had donned the Indian colour in 290 international matches, including three Olympics ? had scored 80 goals. 

 Chess prodigy Akash Thakur, cricketer Monika Sumra, 

 U-16 international footballer Allwyn George, along with 

 international hockey umpire Gurumurty Pillay were felicitated 

 by Mukesh and presented cash awards. (PTI)

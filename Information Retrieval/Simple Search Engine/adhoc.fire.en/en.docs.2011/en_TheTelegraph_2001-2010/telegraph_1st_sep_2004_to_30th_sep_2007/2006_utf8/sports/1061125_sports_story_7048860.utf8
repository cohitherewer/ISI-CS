 Kiri advice for Dhoni

Cape Town: As if Mahendra Singh Dhonis batting woes were not disheartening enough, it is his wicketkeeping capability which is now under scrutiny by former great Syed Kirmani. 

I dont like the way he stands on his heels while waiting for the ball to be delivered. A wicketkeeper should always be on his toes, said Kirmani. 

Kirmani added that Dhoni was not completely down when a ball was just about to be delivered, and hence was far too committed to his movements thus reducing his options in reflexes. 

But that is hardly strange. Nobody in world is worried about the quality of wicketkeeping. You would look for bowling, batting and fielding coaches but no coach, I am sorry to say, knows a thing about wicketkeeping. (PTI)

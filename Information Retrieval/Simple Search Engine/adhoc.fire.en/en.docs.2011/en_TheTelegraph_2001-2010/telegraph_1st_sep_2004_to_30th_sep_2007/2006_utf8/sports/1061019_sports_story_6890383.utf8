New Delhi: Indians will, once again, start favourites in the $400,000 Hero Honda Indian Open with the Delhi Golf Club course having always proven to be a happy hunting ground for the home-grown golfers. 

With no less than three Indians crowding the top-10 in Asian Tour Order of Merit and another three figuring in the top-30, Indian golf has become a major force in Asia, with some of its exponents having taken their successes beyond Asia. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, the current leader on Asian Tour is playing in a $2m event and will miss the Indian Open. The Indian challenge will be spearheaded by Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur. 

Randhawa and Kapur will next year play more in Europe than Asia, while the likes of seasoned Gaurav Ghei and Rahil Gangjee have shown that Indian golf has a huge reservoir of talent. 

While Randhawa, Kapur, Ghei and Gangjee have all tasted success in Asia, Amandeep Johl, currently ranked 28th, and S.S.P. Chowrasia, ranked 56th, are looking for their maiden wins. 

Johl was second in Pakistan early this season and had a third-place finish in Korea. Chowrasia seemed to be on the threshold of a breakthrough win when he opened a five-shot lead at the midway stage of the Mercuries Masters, but an unfortunate lapse derailed his hopes as he was disqualified. 

That was one of the biggest disappointments of my life, said Chowrasia who played the pro-am in the afternoon. But I have been playing well and can compete with the best. 

Ghei and Kapur, who room together on the Asian Tour, have virtually grown on the course. 

The course has never been in a better shape and I am feeling good. I had a top-10 last year and hopefully I will do even better, said Kapur. 

For Randhawa, the National Open is a matter of pride. It is always fantastic to play ones own National Open. And winning it is a great feeling. I have done that once before and would like to do it again, said Randhawa. 

Ghei has happy memories of this course. His chip-in eagle for a title in 1995 is one of the most memorable shots of Indian golf and last year he had a similar chip-in for a birdie and was second to Thaworn Wiratchant, who last year won four national opens and will defend the title this week. 

That was a heady feeling. And now I am playing really well and the success in Taiwan has been great. Winning after 11 years was just awesome. I knew I could do it, said Ghei. (PTI)

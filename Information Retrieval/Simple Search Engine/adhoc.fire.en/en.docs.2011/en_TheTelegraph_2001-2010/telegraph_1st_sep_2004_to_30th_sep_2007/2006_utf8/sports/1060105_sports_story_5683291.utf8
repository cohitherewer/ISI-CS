Calcutta: If Sourav Gangulys deeds on Tuesday spoke of trouble and talent living in symbiosis, Wednesday was no exception either at the Eden. 

It was familiar scene when the former Team India captain decided to roll his arms in Tamil Nadus second innings from the High Court end. Soon after umpire K. Hariharan brought the danger zone to his notice on a couple of occasions. The bowler continued to transgress the area and in his fourth over (fourth ball) the inevitable took place. 

Sourav, who was debarred from bowling in the first innings, was officially warned for straying onto the pitch once again. If it had anything to point towards further trouble, the very next ball put it to rest and captured the other side of the man. Tamil Nadu captain S. Badrinath played forward against a well-pitched delivery and was completely deceived by its late swing. In the next over, Sourav was at it again, finding S. Sharath in front of the wickets. 

 Its another matter that Bengal frontline bowlers ? Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Paul ? didnt find enough motivation out of his endeavours. Tamil Nadu, having bowled Bengal out for 145, finished Day II of the ongoing Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match at 164 for three, and were sitting pretty on a 237-run lead. It could have been worse for the home team had Sourav not waged a solitary battle with 59 during their essay in the morning. 

If it was an attempt to pass out with top grade the examination he has been thrust into by the BCCI before joining Rahul Dravid amp; Co. in Pakistan, the man in the invigilators role looked happy with the way things have so far turned out for Sourav. 

According to the national selector from South V.B. Chandrasekhar, assigned to watch the match, Souravs way of performance was heartening. 

Ahead of the series against Pakistan, it was heartening to see Sourav getting into rhythm, Chandrasekhar said on the sidelines of the match on Wednesday. 

His focus is good and his footwork and timing seem to be in place, he said, reacting to the southpaws 59. 

Chandrasekhar also wants more of Sourav as a bowler. The fact that he bowled less when he was in charge was a bit surprising. He is more than handy on conditions which assist seam bowling, the selector commented. 

Sourav, who has taken so far five wickets, spent around 20 minutes with Chandrasekhar after the days action. 

If the back-to-back troubles around Sourav were not enough, Paul added another twist to the drama on Wednesday. 

When he provided Bengal the first breakthrough in the visitors second essay, he made gestures towards the dismissed batsman Aashish Kapoor. 

The Tamil Nadu off-spinner stood his ground and brought the matter to the umpires notice. 

It is learnt that the Match Referee will report the matter to the BCCI which will decide on the action.

Busan: South Korea raced to a 2-0 lead in their Davis Cup Asia-Oceania zone Group I first-round tie in Changwon near here on Friday. The home team dropped the opening set of the tie before claiming the next six to virtually book a second-round berth on the opening day itself. 

Rohan Bopanna, ranked No. 232 in the world, took the first set 6-3 against the 677th-ranked Hee-Seok Chung. But Chung staged a remarkable fightback to turn the match on its head and win 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. 

Hyung-Taik Lee, the top Korean, then rode roughshod over Prakash Amritraj to win 6-2, 6-2, 6-0. The experienced Korean, ranked No. 89, took just 95 minutes to pack off the 249th-ranked Amritraj. 

Having got the best draw possible, the Indians would have hoped for victory from Bopanna. The much-improved Indian had shown what he was capable of last September against Sweden when he lost in three tie-breaks to former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson. Then, last month, Bopanna qualified for the Chennai Open and even won a round in the main draw. 

Against an opponent ranked much lower, Bopanna started as the clear favourite and played like one in the opening set as he served well and caught the Korean off guard with his forehand placements. 

Chung changed tactic in the second set, slowing down the pace considerably. He didnt give Bopanna the pace which he enjoyed in the first set. The Indian lost his rhythm and lapsed into a series of errors. 

With Chung getting more solid with every passing point, there was no escape route for Bopanna. 

Amritraj was no match for Lee. The only glimmer of hope for the Indian came in the fourth game of the second set when he had Lee serving at 15-40. But the crafty Korean wriggled out of both break-points and didnt face another crisis. 

Lee was especially brilliant in the third set when he hit a barrage of backhand winners. On a number of occasions, the Indian didnt do much wrong as he came to the net after a decent serve only to be passed. 

On Saturday, Indias doubles aces Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi take on Oh-Hee Kwon and Woong-Sun Jun. Its one rubber Indians should definitely win. India are far superior to my squad in the doubles. So my target is to win all single matches, Korean captain Yong-Dae Jeon admitted. 

But even if India make it 1-2 on Saturday, its difficult to see the visitors winning both reverse singles on the final day.

 Ballack fined $89,000 

Landshut (Germany) Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack was fined $89,000 (euro 70,000) on Wednesday for failing to declare to Germans customs a handbag he bought for his wife in Dubai. 

The Germany captain had tax evasion charges dropped and settled with the state court two days before the case was to go to trial. 

Ballacks status as one of the worlds best paid soccer players proved costly as the fine for an infraction in Germany is determined by income. 

The court set the original fine at $64,000 (euro 50,000) the maximum allowed under German law but Ballack appealed against the amount. According to Landshut court president Karl Woerle, that negated his right to negotiate a smaller fine. 

Ballack then agreed to pay an extra $26,000 (euro 20,000) to settle the matter before it went to court. (AP)

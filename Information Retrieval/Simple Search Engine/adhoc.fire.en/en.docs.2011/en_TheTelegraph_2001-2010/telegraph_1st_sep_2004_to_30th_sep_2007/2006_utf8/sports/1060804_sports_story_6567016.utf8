The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lankan duo breaks into top-10

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sri Lankan duo Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, who shattered countrymen Sanath Jayasuriya and Roshan Mahanamas record-breaking partnership of 576 versus India in Colombo in 1997-98, broke into the top-10 of the ICCs Test list for batsmen. 

According to information received here, Jayawardene whose 374 is the highest by a Sri Lankan jumped a whopping nine rungs to be placed 10th, while Sangakkara moved up three spots to be placed eighth. 

Among the Indians, Virender Sehwag dropped down one place to 17th but the consistent Rahul Dravid remained at No. 2. 

More good news was in store for Sri Lankans as their ace off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharns 17th ten-wicket haul in Tests extended his lead over South African Makhaya Ntini in the bowlers charts. 

 Another significant rise is that of Monty Panesars, 

 whose eight for 93 against Pakistan saw him climb 27 places 

 to 39th. If England win the series, they will recapture 

 second place in the Test Championship table.

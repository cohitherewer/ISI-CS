 Disappointing:CA chief

Melbourne: Cricket Australia Sunday said it was disappointed that Australia and New Zealand had missed out on the right to host the 2011 World Cup. 

CA chief executive officer James Sutherland, however, welcomed that Australia and New Zealand would be jointly hosting the 2015 World Cup. 

Australia have won the last two World Cups and Australasia have not hosted a World Cup since 1992. 

He also welcomed that the ICC had decided to award Australia hosting rights to the 2009 ICC Womens World Cup. 

It is disappointing to miss out on the mens 2011 World Cup, he said in a statement. 

But I am pleased that the highly professional bid we made... has demonstrated to the ICC that Australasia will host a world-class tournament in 2015, he said.

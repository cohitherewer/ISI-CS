 Illness forces Surya to return home

 - Olympiad camp

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Gangulys preparations for the upcoming Chess Olympiad were cut short on Tuesday after he was forced to pull out of a training camp here due to illness and return home. 

I have been advised rest but am confident of doing well at the Olympiad in Turin, said Surya after reaching the city on Tuesday night. 

The Olympiad is scheduled in Turin from May 19 to June 5. 

PTI adds from Margao: Surya Sekhar was suffering from herpes which led to throat infection and fever, said doctors attending on him at the Grace Nursing Home in Margao. 

Surya had to seek medical assistance at the Mumbai airport on his way to Goa. I was feeling feverish at the Mumbai airport itself when I was on my way to Goa. Thankfully, Sandipan, who was with me, helped me to get a doctor at the airport, Surya said. 

He did not recover well and was hospitalised on May 1 by All India Chess Federation vice-president Sameer Salgaoncar, who is monitoring the camp. Surya was discharged from the hospital on Saturday and managed to practise with his team members for two days. 

The Indian team has been training here under the guidance of Spanish coach Ubilava Elizbar since late last month. (PTI)

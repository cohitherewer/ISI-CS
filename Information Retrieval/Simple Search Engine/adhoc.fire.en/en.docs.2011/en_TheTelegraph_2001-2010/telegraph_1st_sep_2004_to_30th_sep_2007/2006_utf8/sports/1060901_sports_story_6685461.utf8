 Chowrasia, Gurbaaz tied 12th

 - Malaysian masters 

 Chowrasia returned a fine five-under 67 including an eagle 

Johor Baru (Malaysia): S. S. P. Chowrasia flew on the wings of an eagle to turn in a superb round of five-under 67 on the opening day of the inaugural $300,000 Pulai Spring Resort Malaysian Masters on Thursday. 

Growing in stature with each passing appearance on the Asian Tour, Chowrasia was tied 12th with another promising Indian star, Gurbaaz Mann, who was also five-under 67. 

Seasoned Amandeep Johl, proven young hero Shiv Kapur and Digvijay Singh all shot four-under 68 each to be tied 22nd on a day when 62 players shots three-under or less. 

As many as 97 of the 150 players shot under par on the first round. 

Former Asia No. 1 Jyoti Randhawa was lying tied 62nd with two-under 70, while Gaurav Ghei finished at one-under to be tied 79th. 

Vivek Bhandari, Rahil Gangjee, Arjun Singh and Uttam Singh Mundy shot even par rounds and were tied 98th. 

Harmeet Kahlon went one-over 73 in 125th place, Amritinder Singh and Kanwar Sekhon went two-over at 132nd. 

None of the top three dropped any shots on a perfect day for golf. The lead was shared by South African Anton Haig and Australian Marcus Both as they shot a bogey-free nine-under 63 each. Haig had seven birdies and an eagle, while Both had nine birdies and no bogeys. 

One shot behind was Unho Park with eight-under, with eight birdies and no bogeys. 

Chowrasia started on the tenth and immediately eagled the par-five 11th hole. He had two more birdies on the 16th and 17th and turned in four-under 32. 

He steadily parred the first to fifth and then birdied the sixth. His sole blemish of the day came on the par-four eighth hole, but he quickly made up with a birdie on his closing hole, the ninth.

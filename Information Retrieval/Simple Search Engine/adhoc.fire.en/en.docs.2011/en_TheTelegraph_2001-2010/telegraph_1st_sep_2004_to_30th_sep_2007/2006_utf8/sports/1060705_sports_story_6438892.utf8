London: Second seed Kim Clijsters reached her second Wimbledon singles semi-final on Tuesday despite being given a scare by Chinas Li Na in her 6-4, 7-5 victory. 

Maria Sharapova kept her eye fixed firmly on the ball when she reached the Wimbledon semi-finals on Tuesday. 

The glamorous Russians 6-1, 6-4 victory over compatriot Elena Dementieva was interrupted in the second set when a naked man streaked on to Centre Court and performed a cartwheel before being bundled away by security. 

World No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo dropped her first set of the tournament before beating Anastasia Myskina 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the semi-final on Tuesday. 

Myskina was a different player in the second set, breaking Mauresmos serve and then holding off break points on her own delivery at 4-2 before levelling the match. 

Mauresmo regained control in the decider and moved into her fourth successive semi-final when Myskina fired a service return into the net after one hour 23 minutes. She will face 2004 champion Sharapova in the last four. 

Meanwhile, Russian Dmitry Tursunov was fined $7,500 after he raged at umpire Fergus Murphy following his five-set fourth round defeat by Finn Jarkko Nieminen on Monday. 

Indias Sanam Singh extracted revenge when he dumped out Roberto Bautista-Agut of Spain in the boys singles on Tuesday. 

Eighth seeded Sanam edged past the 18-year old Spaniard 6-4, 3-6, 6-4. The Chandigarh lad now takes on Artur Chernov of Russia in the pre-quarter finals. 

Leander Paes was the only bright spot for India on Monday, winning both his mens doubles and mixed doubles matches. 

The seventh seeded team of Paes and Czech Martin Damm defeated Cyril Suk and Robin Vik of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (7-1) in a third round match. 

He also paired up with Australian Samantha Stosur to beat Paul Hanley and Tatiana Perebiynis in a close second round mixed doubles encounter. The fourth seeded combination prevailed over the Aussie-Ukrainian duo 4-6, 6-3, 12-10. 

 Indias Rupesh Roy and partner Hsin Han Lee of 

 Chinese Taipei moved to the second round of the boys 

 doubles after a convincing 6-2, 6-3 win over the British 

 duo of Scott Dickson and Christopher Llewellyn.

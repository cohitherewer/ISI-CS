 Dravid gamble falls flat as Strauss hits 128

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid took a gamble in his 100th Test but it backfired to leave England smiling on Saturday evening. The visitors rode an Andrew Strauss century to a comfortable 272 for three at stumps on Day I of the third and final Test. 

The Indian skipper won the toss for the first time in the series, but asked the Englishmen to bat first. Thereafter, nothing worked for the Indians as they spilled some catches although they managed to capture two wickets in the final session. 

Strauss led the charge with a sparkling 128 which marked his return to form while debutant Owais Shah (50 retired hurt) ? who made it to the XI after Alastair Cook pulled out in the morning because of a stomach upset ? was the other notable contributor. 

The day clearly belonged to Strauss who drove with elan in front of the wicket to raise his eighth century in his 24th Test to underline Englands dominance in the first two sessions. 

India made some sort of a comeback with the wickets of Strauss and Kevin Pietersen (39) in the post-tea session. 

The 29-year-old Strauss, who slammed 17 fours and a pulled six in his 240-ball innings spanning five-and-a-half hours, put on 52 runs with fellow-opener Ian Bell (18) to give his team a decent start. 

Strauss then helped his team to 230 in the company of Shah ? who did not come out to bat after tea because of cramps in his hands ? and Pietersen. It was Harbhajan Singh who sent back Strauss. In trying to force the off-spinner to the offside, Strauss edged to Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Strauss had two reprieves, on 92 and 123. First he was let off at slip by Dravid off Harbhajan before Dhoni grassed him off Anil Kumble. 

Strauss was also troubled by a fiery Munaf Patel spell when the pacer rapped him on the pads twice before making him fend off a throat-high bouncer awkwardly. 

Within five overs of Strauss departure, Pietersen was also caught-behind ? trying to drive a wide ball from Sreesanth that moved a bit off the seam. 

But Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff made sure England did not suffer any more damage. The skipper looked in particularly good form and slammed Harbhajan for a six over long on during his unbeaten 31-ball stay in which he has also hit two fours. 

On a day when Dravid became the sixth Indian to complete a century of Tests, Sachin Tendulkar (132) surpassed Kapil Devs record of most Test appearances. 

Final at Brabourne 

Meanwhile the BCCI, after a meeting with ICC representatives, decided that the CCI will host the Champions Trophy final at the Brabourne Stadium later this year. Brabournes last international match was in November 1995, an India versus New Zealand ODI. It was also decided that Motera (Ahmedabad) will replace Calcutta as one of the venues.

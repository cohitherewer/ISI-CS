 It will be a real challenge: Fletcher

Mumbai: The English cricket squad led by Michael Vaughan arrived here on Monday for their marathon tour which includes three Tests and seven one-day International against India, after almost a five year hiatus. 

Coach Duncan Fletcher admitted that the tour will be a big challenge and suggested there was no room for complacency. 

It will be slightly different from our tour to Pakistan. Here, I believe, the wickets are bowler friendly. It will be a real challenge, Fletcher said on arrival. 

Skipper Vaughan said that the team will miss Ashley Giles in the spinner friendly wickets but termed it as an opportunity for the young bowlers. 

We do believe the wickets here are spinner friendly. We are obviously disappointed that our key spinner Giles is not here. He has been to India before and has a lot of experience bowling on the wickets here. 

But we also have three relatively new spinners and it will be a great opportunity for them to make a significant contribution. 

We will be looking to get big scores in the first innings and getting 20 wickets in the hope of putting the pressure on India, Vaughan added. 

Vaughan said it was important to put behind Englands recent loss to Pakistan and focus on the current tour. 

We have enough time and practice games to get acclimatised and get used to the conditions here. That should help, he said. 

The skipper also added that Englands memorable win in the Ashes series had raised the profile of cricket around the world and their confidence was on a high. 

It will be an exciting series to watch and Indian fans can look forward to players like (Andrew) Flintoff and (Matthew) Hoggard, he said. 

I also believe Simon Jones will be very effective. The pitches here tend to favour the skiddy bowlers and Jones could be dangerous, Fletcher said. (PTI)

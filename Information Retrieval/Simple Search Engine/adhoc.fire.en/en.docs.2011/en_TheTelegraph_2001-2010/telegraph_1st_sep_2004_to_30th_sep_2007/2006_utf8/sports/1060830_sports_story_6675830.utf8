 Sachin: Without dreams, you stagnate

London: Sachin Tendulkar believes in dreams. 

In excerpts of his forthcoming book Tendulkars Opus published in a magazine, the Maestro says: Now, every minute is measured and calculated. I still dream without dreams, life is flat, you stagnate. I dont go to the temple every morning, but I do pray, he says. 

His father had full faith on him. 

It was probably reverse psychology, but as I got older I felt like I could not misuse that trust. 

I now have my own family, a daughter who is eight and a son who is six, so theres that other half of the coin to look at. I need to strike the right balance between cricket and family. 

I try to follow my fathers lead and give my kids the freedom that I had in my family. 

Sachin says he received his first cricket bat when he was seven. 

My elder sister gave it to me after returning from a trip to Kashmir. It wasnt the best bat, but it was like a piece of gold to me. I used to imagine myself batting for India. I used that bat until it broke when I graduated from playing with a tennis ball to a hard, seasoned ball. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day I Highlights

 Chris Gayle (on 7) became the 15th West Indian and the 95th 

 batsman overall to reach 4000 runs in Tests. Playing in 

 his 60th Test match and 105th innings he now has 4076 runs. 

 The 143-run stand between Gayle and Daren Ganga was West 

 Indies only second three-figure opening partnership 

 in the last 37 innings since July 2004. The above pair had 

 put on 148 against New Zealand in Auckland in March this 

 year. 

 Meanwhile, the last 100-plus opening stand for the Caribbean 

 at home was the unbeaten 113 between Devon Smith and Gayle 

 against Bangladesh at Gros Islet in June 2004. 

 The Gayle-Ganga stand, incidentally, was West Indies 

 second best for the first wicket at home against India. 

 The best still remains the 296 runs between Gordon Greenidge 

 and Desmond Haynes in St Johns in 1982-83. 

 However, Thursdays partnership was the highest-ever 

 for the opening wicket in any first-class match at this 

 ground surpassing the 135 between Robert Samuels and Sherwin 

 Campbell for the West Indies Board XI against the Australians 

 in 1994-95. 

 The five sixes hit by Gayle was the second most achieved 

 by a West Indian batsman against India in Tests. Viv Richards 

 had hit six sixes during his unbeaten knock of 192 in Delhi, 

 1974-75. Gayle, in fact, joins Ridley Jacobs (118 in St 

 Johns, 2001-02) as the second West Indian to hit five 

 sixes in an innings against India. 

 Gayle, now joins Englands Ian Botham (66 in Delhi, 

 1981-82) and Pakistans Wasim Akram (62 in Chennai, 

 1986-87) to become the only third batsman to hit most sixes 

 (five) in an innings against India, while making a score 

 less than hundred. 

 Gayle has now hit 30 sixes in his Test career, of which 

 11 have come off Indian bowlers (Harbhajan 4, Kumble and 

 Sreesanth 3 each, and VRV Singh 1).

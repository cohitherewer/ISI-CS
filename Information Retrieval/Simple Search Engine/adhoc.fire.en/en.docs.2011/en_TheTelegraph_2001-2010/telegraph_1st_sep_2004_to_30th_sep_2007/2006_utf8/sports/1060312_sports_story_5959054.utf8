 Anils day out in Mohali

 - Leg-spinner is second fastest to achieve 500, and fifth overall 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Chandigarh: The Canon 50D is Anil Kumbles constant companion at every ground across the globe. He never misses an opportunity to record a moment of consequence. On Friday, as he walked out after lunch, he left it with John Gloster. 

As the clinched fists and the high fives followed at 21 minutes past one following Stephen Harmisons dismissal, the physio had it on camera for the leg-spinners personal collection. Later, Kumble also collected the ball from the umpires to add to his souvenirs. 

Kumbles 500 wickets came a day after Muttiah Muralidharan achieved his 600th scalp. The Indian collapse towards the end of Day III could in no way spoil the buoyant mood in the camp. Besides the cake-cutting, a toast was also raised in his honour by the legendary Kapil Dev and captain Rahul Dravid after the close. 

If Kumble hastened the visitors end in this TVS Cup Test, some well-directed short-pitched stuff from England pacers ? Sachin Tendulkar and Dravid were both hit trying to get away from the line ? spelt doom for the famed Indian top-order. Dravid, however, is batting on 60 with Mahendra Singh Dhoni, but the Indians are still 151 runs shy with six wickets remaining. 

The visitors, wearing black armbands to mourn the passing away of former MCC president Collin McKinsey, were out with a definite plan and it worked to their advantage. Virender Sehwag and Sachin were both victims of rising deliveries while Wasim Jaffer fell to a lazy shot. Yuvraj Singh could hardly do little as a terrific one-handed catch to his left at short mid-wicket by Ian Bell had him dumbstruck. 

Despite the setbacks, it remained Kumbles day and nothing could divert the attention from his achievement. 

The leg-spinners first spell this morning was fruitless and a bit expensive, too. The gloomy conditions were more to the fast bowlers liking. Munaf Patel got the ball to move and with good pace. 

New ball was taken after lunch with Kumble coming into the fray 13 overs later. Geraint Jones fell to the first delivery, the ball brushing his pads before rolling on to the stumps. Wicket No. 499. 

The excitement reached a fever pitch. It seemed like the impatient gathering couldnt wait any more for the arrival of the sacred moment. There was the blowing of the conch shells and the chanting of prayers by a priest while another section performed the bhangra amid beating of drums. 

The 35-year-old had no plans to disappoint. Harmison was adjudged leg before by umpire Simon Taufel next ball. The wait had ended. This was the moment for cameras, history books and also the archives. 

It did not end here and it seemed the Kumble episode had more chapters left. Hattrick chance awaited him as last man Monty Panesar took strike. Dravid surrounded him with seven close-in fielders. 

Panesar, however, managed to defend the innocuous delivery. The sigh of regret that ran through could not triumph over the strong sense of contentment though that had preceded the completion of wicket No. 500. 

Kumble made amends in the next ball as Panesar failed to delay his departure further. Dravid completed the regulation catch. He ended with figures of 29.4-8-76-5, his 32nd five-wicket haul in his 105th Test. He also became the second fastest (and fifth bowler) to reach the magical 500 mark after Murali, who completed the feat in his 87th Test. 

Patel, who finished with three wickets in his maiden innings, certainly showed lot of promise. Exciting, was how Kapil Dev described him.

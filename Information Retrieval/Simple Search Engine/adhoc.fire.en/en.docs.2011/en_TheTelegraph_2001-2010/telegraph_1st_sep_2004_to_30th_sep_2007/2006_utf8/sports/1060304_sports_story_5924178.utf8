 SA coast to 289 for seven

Cape Town: Justin Kemp struck a 41-ball half century to power South Africa to 289 for seven in the second ODI against Australia on Friday. 

Kemp hit four sixes to finish with 51 not out as he and Shaun Pollock added 62 off 50 deliveries for the sixth wicket after South Africa had reached 192 in the 39th over. 

Herschelle Gibbs top-scored for the hosts with 66 and Mark Boucher scored 42, but both fell to Brad Hogg as the wrist-spinner made important breakthroughs for the Australians. 

Stuart Clark, back in the Australian line-up after a rib injury, claimed the first wicket when he scattered Graeme Smiths stumps after the South African captain had scored 24. 

Fellow opener Boeta Dippenaar scored 31, an innings seasoned with six boundaries, before he became Shane Watsons first wicket, dragging a wide delivery on to his stumps. 

Watson then bowled AB de Villiers for 18, bringing together Gibbs and Boucher for the chief partnership of the innings. Boucher continued his fine form this year as he hit three sixes in his 59-ball innings, while Gibbs made his runs off 72 deliveries.

Doha: For the umpires at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex here, keeping the noisy crowd in check when the matches are in progress is a big problem. 

But on Saturday afternoon at the Centre Court, the scene was totally different. The crowd, mostly Indians, looked apprehensive and spoke in a rather hush-hush tone. When Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi came on court for their first-round doubles match, an uneasy calm prevailed all around. 

Paes and Bhupathi did little to ease the tension. The duo, once the best in the world, didnt exchange a word and started hitting the ball quietly. As the Japanese umpire called one minute, they got ready to start without even looking at each other. The fans sensed the undercurrent and preferred not to wave the tricolour which they had brought. 

The Indians opponents from Hong Kong were too raw and inexperienced to bother Paes and Bhupathi. Hiu Tung Yu and Wing Luen Wayne Wong were left clueless as the Indian pair took the first set 6-0 in 15 minutes. After winning each point, the two lightly touched each others hands before turning around to take their respective positions. 

They were not enjoying it, one could feel it from outside. No other member of the Indian team was present on court, team doctor Vece Paes being the lone exception. Sania Mirza, who was to play mixed doubles with Paes an hour later, preferred to watch Rohan Bopannas match at the No. 3 court. 

Bhupathi didnt look too fit in the first set. It became even more evident in the second set, which the Indians clinched 6-4 after being 0-3 down. His back problem wasnt perhaps allowing him to stretch fully. 

Its fine, was all that Bhupathi said after the match and walked past the mixed zone, but there was something more than it. 

Bhupathi missed some easy points in the second set. He was not serving well either. The Hong Kong duo raced to a 3-0 lead. As they threatened to take the match to the third set, the Indians decided to join hands. 

They rallied to 4-4. Then came the best moment of the 55-minute match, in the ninth game. 

As Bhupathi raced to the net to put away a winner and make it 5-4, the two men jumped up and did a high-fives. The crowd roared for the first time. They finally got a chance to wave the tricolour. 

Paes sounded gracious in his post-match comments. In the second set, I missed a few drop shots. It allowed our rivals to come back. Then, both Mahesh and I played well to pocket the match. 

Paes dismissed the controversy as one bad day. 

That is nothing but past. We will go all out to win the gold, he said. 

About a billion Indians are keeping fingers crossed.

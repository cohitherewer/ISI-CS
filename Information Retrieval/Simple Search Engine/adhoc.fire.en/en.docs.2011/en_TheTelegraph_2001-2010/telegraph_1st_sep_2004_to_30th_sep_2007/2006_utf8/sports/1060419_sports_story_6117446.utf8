 Pawar, Speed stopped at stadium

Abu Dhabi: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel was allegedly manhandled by overzealous security personnel during the first ODI here. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, BCCI president Sharad Pawar and a few other top functionaries were stopped at the entrance. 

The organisational blunder might be attributed to heightened security in view of the presence of high-profile guests, including Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf. 

Some of the mediamen, too, were denied entry despite having valid passes and were made to wait for close to two hours before being allowed in. 

Later Abu Dhabi Cricket Council president B. R. Shetty regretted the inconvenience caused to the guests. 

Significant extra security measures had to be implemented in view of visiting foreign dignitaries, (which) affected the smooth running of the match, he said in a hastily drafted press statement. 

All possible security measures were put in place to minimise the impact of this security requirement, but regrettably some people suffered inconvenience and discomfort. (PTI)

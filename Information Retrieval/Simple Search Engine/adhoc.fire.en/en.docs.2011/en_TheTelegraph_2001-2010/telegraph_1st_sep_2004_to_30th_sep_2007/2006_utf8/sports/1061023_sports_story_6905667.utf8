 Super Speed upstages Real 

 SRIMAX

 Mysore: Sathish Narredu-trained Super Speed upset the applecart of hot-favourite Real Excellence in the Poonawalla Mysore Derby here on Sunday. The Tirol-Silent Tale three-year-old colt, who had finished third to Diabolical in his lead up race, gave young jockey Suraj Narredu his second Derby in succession his first being Psychic Strength, here last year.

 Real Excellence looked a cinch on her paddock looks and past record, but the Steinbeck-Allaire daughter didnt posed any danger to the winner at any part of the race. In fact, the favourite just about managed to secure the second slot from Symbol Of Speed, who was galloping close to the winner in the last 100m of the race, but buckled under pressure. It was a fast-paced race with Fabulous Emperor showing the way to Super Speed, Symbol Of Speed, Real Excellence and the rest. Super Speed burst ahead at the top of the turn with Symbol Of Speed in hot-chase. Real Excellence, however, never looked dangerous despite getting a wide opening along the rails.

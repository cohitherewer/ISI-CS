 Nazir century keeps Sialkot in hunt

Dharamshala: A combative century by captain Imran Nazir helped Sialkot avoid the blushes and keep their hopes alive in the four-day match for Mohammed Nissar Trophy against Ranji champions Uttar Pradesh at the HPCA Stadium here on Thursday. 

Tottering at 89 for five in reply to UPs first innings total of 316, Sialkot found its man on Friday in injured captain Nazir who cracked a 113-ball 123 single-handedly helped the visitor avoid the follow-on. 

The Qaid-e-Azam winners eventually ended up at 261, conceding a first innings lead of 65. 

At stumps on the second day, Uttar Pradesh were 14 for no loss with Rohit Prakash on six and Shiva Kant Shukla on seven at the crease. 

Nazirs effort was all the more commendable since he sprained his right shoulder and received stitches for a cut in the wrist while fielding. 

After Rudra Pratap provided the early breakthroughs, Praveen Kumar (3/69) and leg-spinner Piyush Chawla (3/85) brought nightmares to the opposition batsmen. (PTI)

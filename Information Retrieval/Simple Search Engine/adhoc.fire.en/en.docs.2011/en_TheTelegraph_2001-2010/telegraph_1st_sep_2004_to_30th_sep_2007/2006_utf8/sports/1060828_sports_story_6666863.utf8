 Atwal 67th after 1-under

Reno (US): Daniel Chopra continued his upward march with a flawless display of eight-under 64, that included six birdies and an eagle, as he zoomed up the scoreboard to be tied fourth after the third round of the Reno Tahoe Open. 

The Swede of Indian origin, moved up from tied 18th to fourth with a 64 that equalled the days second best card. He is now four behind the co-leaders. 

Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal continued to languish lower down with a one-under 71 that saw him in 67th place. He started on the 10th with a bogey but had two birdies on second and ninth. 

Bob Estes, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, birdied the final hole for a four-under 68 to tie Will Mackenzie for the lead at 19-under. Another American, John Cook was in third spot on 15-under. 

Chopra, 33, has time and again put himself in sight of a title this season. Currently lying 75th on the money list, he had a great round requiring just 23 putts, despite reaching 61 per cent greens in regulation. This was in sharp contrast to the 33 he needed on first day and 27 on the second. 

He shot birdies on the fourth and sixth and turned in two-under 34. (Pti)

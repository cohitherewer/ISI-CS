 Shastri flays Sourav inclusion in XI

New Delhi: Former captain Ravi Shastri on Friday described the Team India thinktanks decision to include Sourav Ganguly for the Lahore Test as a weak one. He, however, ruled out the intervention of BCCI supremo Sharad Pawar. 

He (Pawar) is a powerful man. He will not use these powers in influencing the selection of the side, Shastri said on a TV programme. Thats a team managements decision. If you ask me for my choice, he (Sourav) would not have fitted into my XI. I think, its a weak decision, he added. 

Meanwhile, Pawar called on Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf at the Army House in Rawalpindi on Friday. Officials on both sides maintained that it was a courtesy call and much of their talks centred on issues relating to cricket. 

Pawar said the Asian Test playing countries would jointly bid for the 2011 or 2015 World Cup. Talking briefly to reporters at the Gaddafi Stadium after his meeting with Musharraf in Islamabad, Pawar said the decision regarding the World Cup would be taken soon. 

[That there would be joint bidding by Asias big four was reported in The Telegraph on June 8 last year].

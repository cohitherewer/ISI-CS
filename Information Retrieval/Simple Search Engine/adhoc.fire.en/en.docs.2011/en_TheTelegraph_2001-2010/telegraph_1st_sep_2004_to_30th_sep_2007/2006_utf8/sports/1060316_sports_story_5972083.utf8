 Inter beat Ajax, face Villarreal next

 - Champions League

Milan: Inter Milan set up a Champions League quarter final with Villarreal when a superb goal by Dejan Stankovic gave them a 1-0 win over Ajax Amsterdam on Tuesday to complete a 3-2 victory on aggregate. 

The midfielders 57th-minute strike sealed a deserved victory for the home side after they created a string of chances, although they missed a first-half penalty when Brazilian forward Adriano put his spot-kick wide. 

The result, which means three Italian teams are through to the last eight, completed the quarter final line-up. The other matches see Benfica facing Barcelona, Arsenal versus Juventus and Olympique Lyon against AC Milan. 

Inter play the first leg of their quarter final at the San Siro on March 29, with the return at the Madrigal on April 4. 

Coach Roberto Mancini told his players not to get over-confident for the clash with the Spaniards. There are many dangers in facing Villarreal, starting from the fact we will be favourites, Mancini told reporters.

 Negi crushes Russian GM

 - HOLLAND CHESS 

 - Barua settles for draw with LAMI 

 Dibyendu Barua 

Vlissingen: Parimarjan Negi continued with his fine run to score a thumping victory over eight seed Grandmaster Konstantin Landa of Russia in the sixth round of Hogeschool Zeeland International Chess tournament here. 

The victory helped the 13-year-old Indian to remain in joint lead on 5.5 points in the nine-round tournament being played in the Swiss format. 

Negi shares the lead with GM Michael Krasenkow of Poland, GM Vyacheslav Ikonnikov of Russia and GM Friso Nijboer of Holland. 

GM Dibyendu Barua drew with GM Erwin LAmi of Holland while International Master Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury and Saptarshi Roy ended on the losing side. IM Roktim Bandyopadhyay was held by Weersel Arlette of Holland. 

Barua is tied fourth on 5 points along with 8 others. 

 Negis new opening repertoire has been helping him a great deal if trends in this event are anything to go by. Landa thought he could find some holes in the preparation of the teenager but was surprised all along with the conviction with which Negi executed his plan. 

It was a Caro Kann advance variation that Negi opted for with white pieces and Landa went for a complicated system and sacrificed two pawns to get some attacking prospects against a slightly under developed Negis pieces. 

However, as the game progressed, Negi took control with routine deployment of forces and knocked down another pawn as Landa went for his king. Soon after, Negi completed his development after which there was no hope in store for the Russian. The game lasted just 24 moves. 

Barua got in to a slightly worse position out of a Queens Gambit declined playing black against LAmi but the advantage of the Dutchmen never grew too much.

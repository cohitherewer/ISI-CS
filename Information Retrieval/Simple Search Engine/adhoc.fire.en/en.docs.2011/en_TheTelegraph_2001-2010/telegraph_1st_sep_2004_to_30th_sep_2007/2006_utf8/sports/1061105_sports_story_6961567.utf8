 Davydenko in final

Paris: World No. 5 Nikolay Davydenko defeated Spains Tommy Robredo 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 on Saturday to reach the final of the Paris Masters. 

Davydenko, seeded fourth in the indoor event, next plays German Tommy Haas or Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty. 

The balding Russian dropped his first set of the tournament against Robredo but still advanced relatively comfortably. 

The highest-ranked player in the field following a string of withdrawals, the 25-year-old Davydenko is chasing his fifth title of the year. 

Davydenko broke Robredo with a forehand winner in the fifth game before taking the first set. 

He captured sixth seed Robredos serve again with a fierce smash in the fourth game of the second set but the gritty Spaniard broke back immediately.

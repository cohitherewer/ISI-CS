The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DAY II HIGHLIGHTS

 The 203-run stand between Daren Ganga and Ramnaresh Sarwan 

 was the West Indies second-best for the second wicket 

 against India after the 255 between Easton McMorris and 

 Rohan Kanhai in Kingston in 1961-62 

 However, Ganga and Sarwan just managed to obliterate the 

 all-time first-class record partnership for the second wicket 

 at this ground by one run. The previous best (202) featured 

 Lockhart Sebastien and Irvine Shillingford for Windward 

 Islands in 1978-79 

 The 25 runs conceded by Munaf Patel was the second-most 

 by any Indian in an over in Tests. Harbhajan Singh had conceded 

 27 to Shahid Afridi in the Lahore Test earlier this year 

 Sarwan became only the second batsman in Tests, after Chris 

 Gayle, to hit six fours in a row in the same over. Gayle 

 had done it against Matthew Hoggard at The Oval in 2004 

 Sarwan (116) became the seventh batsman in Test history 

 to register a century on birthday, the others being Peter 

 Richardson (in 1957), Allan Lamb (in 1988), Chris Lewis 

 (in 1993), Alec Stewart (in 1994), Imran Khan (in 1980) 

 and Andrew Hudson (in 1994). Incidentally, it was Sarwans 

 26th birthday 

 The wicket of Dwayne Bravo was Harbhajan Singhs first 

 away from home since he dismissed Zimbabwean Charles Coventry 

 on September 20, 2006, in Harare. Since then, Harbhajans 

 cumulative figures in four away Tests read 112.1-10-310-0 

 till he got Bravos wicket

 Would have loved to have Warne in my team: Smith

South African captain Graeme Smith had much praise for Shane Warne, who quits playing for Australia in early January, and Glenn McGrath, who will retire after the World Cup. 

The following are excerpts from what he said on Saturday afternoon: 

ON WARNE: Hard to say anything new about him... Warne has been a once in a lifetime cricketer... His record speaks for itself... Shows the difference he made to Australia... Yes, I wouldve loved to have him in my team... 

ON McGRATH: Another big-time player, like Warne... Again, a once in a lifetime cricketer... Being an opener, facing McGrath was a massive challenge... Hes going to be missed, but somebody will get the opportunity to take things forward...

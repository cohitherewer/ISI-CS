Doha: The Indian football team, of late, has become the biggest winless wonders of the country. In 2006, India have been yet to score a win in international matches but the game against the Maldives in the Group D of the Asian Games on Sunday finally broke that streak, thanks to Subhas Chakrabarty. The Mohun Bagan midfielder scored the matchwinner minutes before the final whistle to give India a 2-1 victory. 

It also ended India s winless streak in the last seven matches in this calendar year. The last time they won a match was against Bangladesh in the SAFF Cup final in Karachi last December. 

But there was bad news also for the Indian camp. Skipper Bhaichung Bhutia, who in all probability is playing his last international tournament, found himself out of the final group match against Iran on Wednesday as he received the second booking of the tournament. 

The ace striker, veteran of many an international battle, committed a foul on the rival goalkeeper that he could have easily avoided. While it was difficult to understand why he suddenly lost his composure, he, too, was at the receiving end in the very next minute. He was pushed to the ground by the Maldives defender Ashfan Ahmed but he escaped with a yellow card. Such offences these days generally call for marching orders. Chief coach Bob Houghton later admitted that it was a bad card to pick up. 

After India drew their first match against Hong Kong, even their die hard fans did not expect them to qualify for the next round. But when Houghton spoke about going all out against the Maldives to try and gain confidence before they meet Iran, one thought the team has finally woken up from their slumber. 

In the end, it could have been the same old story had not substitute Subhas come to the teams rescue with an angular shot from the right after he was put in by Bhutia. 

In the first half, it was a pity to find India once again conceding goal minutes after they took the lead. In the 34th minute, the handful of Indians present at the Al-Sadd Stadium had something to cheer about when Surkumar Singh put India ahead with a fine long ranger. 

The move was initiated by Bhutia before Climax Lawrence sent a fine square pass on the open for Surkumar. The Manipuri defender, who has the habit of taking long shots, tried a 30-yarder that dropped in front of goalkeeper Imran Mohammad before going in.

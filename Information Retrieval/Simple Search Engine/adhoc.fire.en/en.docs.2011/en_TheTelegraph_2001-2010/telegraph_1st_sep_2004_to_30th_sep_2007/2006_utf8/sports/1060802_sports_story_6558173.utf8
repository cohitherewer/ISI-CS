 Safin battles into Round II

Washington: Andy Roddicks withdrawal from the Washington Classic on Monday stole the spotlight from former-world No. 1 Marat Safin, who battled to 6-3, 7-6 first-round win over Igor Kunitsyn. 

Roddick was forced out of the hardcourt event with the strained lower back he injured at the Los Angeles Open last week, but the American is confident of being back to full strength for the US Open at the end of August. 

In other first round action, South Africas Wesley Moodie rallied past American wild card Sam Querrey 2-6, 7-6, 7-6 in a two hour-16 minute marathon, while Germanys Denis Gremelmayr brushed past Moodies compatriot Wesley Whitehouse 6-2, 6-2.

London: Chelsea moved within touching distance of a second successive Premier League title with an untroubled 2-0 victory at Bolton Wanderers on Saturday. 

Goals by England internationals John Terry and Frank Lampard took Chelsea nine points clear of Manchester United, who were surprisingly held to a goalless home draw by Sunderland on Friday. 

Chelsea could secure the title at Stamford Bridge on Monday by beating Everton if United fail to win at Tottenham Hotspur earlier in the day. 

Chelsea have 85 points, United 76 and Liverpool, who visit Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, are third on 70. Tottenham have 61 with Arsenal on 57 after their 3-1 win at home against West Bromwich Albion. Blackburn have 54. 

Chelsea went ahead in the 44th minute when Lampard swung in a free kick and Didier Drogba and John Terry rose unmarked together to meet it, the English defender claiming the final touch. 

Lampard doubled the lead on the hour from close range to set a Premier League record of 15 goals from midfield and the champions cruised home. 

Sunderland held Manchester United to a shock 0-0 draw at Old Trafford on Friday but were still relegated despite their battling display. 

In Spanish League action, Samuel Eto struck his 24th goal of the season to give Barcelona a 1-0 win over Villarreal on Friday that took them closer to retaining the title. 

The Cameroon striker turned sharply on the edge of the area and fired low past Villarreal keeper Mariano Barbosa in the 11th minute at the Nou Camp to earn his side a deserved victory over their fellow Champions League semi-finalists. 

The win sent Barcelona 14 points clear of Valencia and Real Madrid at the top with five games left. Villarreal, who have won once in their last seven outings, remain eighth. 

In Milan, AC Milan celebrated a 1-0 derby win over city rivals Inter thanks to a 70th minute strike by Georgian defender Kakha Kaladze in Serie A on Friday.

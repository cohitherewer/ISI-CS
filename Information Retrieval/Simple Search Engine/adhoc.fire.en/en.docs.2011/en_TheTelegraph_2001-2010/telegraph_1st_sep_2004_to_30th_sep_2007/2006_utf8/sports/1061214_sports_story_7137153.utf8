 Hearing on CAB petition begins

Chennai: The BCCI and the CAB began their legal battle at the Madras High Court over an amendment in the rules and regulations which deals with the mandatory requirement for initiating disciplinary action on a member. 

When the matter came up for hearing before Justice Chitra Venkatraman, the CAB sought an interim stay on the BCCI meeting to be convened on Saturday in Jaipur. 

Senior counsel A L Somaiyaji, appearing for CAB chief Jagmohan Dalmiya, prayed for declaration of the Rule 27, 38 (IV) and 41 of the rules and regulations of BCCI as ultra vires of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act. 

He also sought a direction to restrain the BCCI from permitting anyone else except its members from voting in the special general meetings.

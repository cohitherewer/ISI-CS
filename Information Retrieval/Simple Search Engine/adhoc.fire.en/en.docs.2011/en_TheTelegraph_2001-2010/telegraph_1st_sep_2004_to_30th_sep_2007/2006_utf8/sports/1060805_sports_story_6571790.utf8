 Bagan colts leave for Manchester 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Premier Cup 

 New Delhi: For an Indian 

 football team, to reach the final rounds of any international 

 tournament has remained a distant dream since the under-20 

 squad led by Shabbir Ali won the Asian championships in 

 1974.

 It may be too early to say that 

 happy days would be back in Indian football again, but a 

 bunch of under-15 youngsters, trained and developed by Mohun 

 Bagan, has raised hopes of flying the Indian flag high at 

 the world stage by qualifying for the Manchester United 

 Premier Cup World finals to be played from August 8 to 11.

 The green and maroon brigade, 

 coached by former international Shyamal Banerjee, left for 

 England on Friday to take part in the worlds most 

 prestigious age group tournament to be contested by 20 best 

 clubs from five continents at the Theatre of Dreams 

 in Old Trafford. These 20 clubs have qualified through local, 

 national and regional tournaments, in which 8,000 teams 

 took part.

 The team was given a warm send 

 off by the AIFF and Nike in a function in the capital.

 Twenty teams have been divided 

 into four group of five teams each to be played on the league 

 basis. Top two teams from each group will qualify for the 

 quarter finals, which will be a knock-out stage.

 The tournament has seen many World 

 Cuppers play in the past, like Robinho of Brazil and Argentinas 

 Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez. 

 Interestingly, four players of 

 the Mohun Bagan squad will be fortunate enough to practise 

 with the senior Manchester United side.

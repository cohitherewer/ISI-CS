Melbourne: The dope shame of two male weightlifters failed to distract Indian shooters from their target as they added three more gold medals and a silver to their kitty at the 18th Commonwealth Games here on Thursday. 

Among other highlights of the day, Jitender Kumar and Varghese Johnson bagged a bronze from the boxing ring, while three other pugilists ? Harpreet Singh, Vijender and Akhil Kumar ? set themselves up for higher honours by storming into the final. 

 The womens hockey team closed in on their title defence by reaching the final, while seasoned shuttler Aparna Popat gave a befitting reply to her critics by showing the exit door to the defending gold medallist in the womens singles. 

Olympic silver medallist Rajyavaradan Singh Rathore took sweet revenge over his former coach Russell Mark of Australia to retain the gold in individual double trap shooting. 

The Armyman, who had lost the team gold to Mark, fired 181 (137+44) to grab top honours. 

Anuja Jung clinched the gold in the womens 50m rifle three positions to ensure that the spotlight does not remain solely over her husband Samresh, who has already won five gold medals and is aiming for two more to become the highest medal winner ever in a particular edition of the Commonwealth Games. 

Adding to the tally, Vijay Kumar and Pemba Tamang won gold and silver, respectively in the mens 25m rapid fire pistol. 

Indias top paddler Achanta Sharath Kamal advanced to the quarters even as others made a quiet exit from the mens and womens table tennis singles events. 

Third seed Sharath is now the sole Indian medal hope in the mens draw as Bengals Subhajit Saha and Soumyadeep Roy failed to repeat their gold winning performance in the team event and bowed out of the race. 

In the womens singles, seasoned Poulomi Ghatak and Mouma Das also failed to reach the last eight mark. 

Commonwealth Championship winner Sharath carved out a facile 7-11, 11-6, 12-10, 11-6, 11-5 win against Andrew Rushtom of England. Sharath set up a clash with Cai Xiao Li, who edged past the Indian 3-2 in the team event finals. 

Singapores Yang Zi and Cai avenged their defeat in the final play-off of mens team event as they accounted for Subhajit and Soumyadeep on Thursday. 

Subhajit lost 5-11, 11-5, 10-12, 8-11, 7-11 to Yang in the pre-quarters while Roy went down to Jason Ho in a gruelling 7-11, 11-7, 5-11, 5-11, 11-2, 11-6, 6-11 tussle in the second round itself. 

Mouma went down after a keen duel to Xu Yan of Singapore in the pre-quarter finals. The newly-crowned national womens champion lost 4-1, 14-12, 10-12, 13-11, 4-11, 13-11, 2-11, 10-12 to Yan. Poulomi lost 9-11, 11-7, 5-11, 8-11, 11-13 to Miao Miao of Australia. 

In the mens doubles event, Sharath and Soumyadeep came back from two games down to hand out a 9-11, 9-11, 11-6, 11-2, 11-4 to Trevor Brown and Russell Lavale of Australia. The Indian will take on the English pair of Andrew Baggley and Andrew Rushton in the quarter finals. 

Shibaji Datta and Subhajit, however, failed to overcome the hurdle and lost 11-6, 11-9, 11-6 to Englands Alan Cooke and Paul Drinkall. 

Poloumi and Mouma also made it to the quarters after edging past Waless Bethal Daunton and Owen Naomi 14-12, 10-12, 11-3, 6-11, 11-6.

 Never made a comment like that: Mani

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: International Cricket Council (ICC) president Eshan Mani on Thursday denied saying that the late submission of compliance book/manual had weakened Asias bid to host the 2011 World Cup. Mani will chair Sundays Executive Board meeting in Dubai to decide the hosts. 

All newspapers had splashed Manis comments, in Karachi, in their Wednesday editions. It is intriguing as to why the ICC president took so long to come out and say that he had been misquoted. 

I never made a comment like that. In fact, I was not in Karachi on Tuesday? I dont know how I could be quoted from there, the ICC chief said during the official launch and host agreement signing ceremony of the Champions Trophy in the capital on Thursday afternoon. 

He further said: Asia is important for the ICC and the World Cup. We maxde an important decision recently that every third World Cup would be held in Asia. 

Mani refused to make any comment on who could win the right to host the 2011 World Cup. 

It is not something I can speculate on. We have to ensure a level playing field for all. We remain neutral. India is an important member. But ultimately it is a decision which has to be made by the ICC Executive Board which requires the support of seven countries, said Mani. 

BCCI president Sharad Pawar said he feels Asia should get the nod from the ICC Board.Our claim is a rightful one. Our proposal is not about India alone. To see matches being held in more countries would mean more crowd participation, we hope to get this opportunity. 

When Mani said the ICC was contemplating events like a Twenty20 championship every year with commitment from each of its members, Pawar remarked that the BCCI was willing to toe the line provided there was a consensus among all other boards. 

We met and discussed about it. Although we are not favourably inclined towards a Twenty20 meet, well respect any ICC decision if it is taken unanimously, Pawar said.

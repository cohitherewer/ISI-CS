 Bhajji skips practice with stiff back 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: There are injury worries for India ahead of their crucial match against the West Indies on Thursday. Harbhajan Singh has a stiff back and did not practice on Tuesday morning. By the evening, though he was much better. 

The team management is confident that the off-spinner will be available for selection. 

While it is almost certain that Suresh Raina will have to sit out for the game, Mohammed Kaif has emerged as a likely replacement along with Dinesh Mongia. A final decision may only be taken Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Brian Lara is still to fully recover from the side strain. The West Indies are unlikely to risk him for the game. 

Runako Morton, though, exuded confidence going into the key clash. We are going in with confidence... We enjoy an edge over India in the last 10 games... The guys believe in themselves, he told a media conference. 

The Indian batting hasnt been consistent with some of the batsmen not in their best of form. But the conditions will be different here and they will enjoy the home advantage. We are aware of that and are looking forward to the challenge, he remarked. 

The constant change in batting order with Lara coming in at No. 6 in the last game hasnt been much of a problem, he felt. 

The captains batting at No. 6 gives balance to the side. Younger players get confidence at the top since they know that there is an experienced customer to follow. When the situation comes, we all have to put our hands up and perform.

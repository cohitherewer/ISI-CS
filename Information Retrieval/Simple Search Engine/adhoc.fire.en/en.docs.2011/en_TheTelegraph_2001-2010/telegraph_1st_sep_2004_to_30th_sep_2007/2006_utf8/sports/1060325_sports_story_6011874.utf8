 I never lose motivation: Ronaldinho

Barcelona: Ronaldinho says there is no danger of him resting on his laurels as he concentrates on winning the two biggest prizes in football, the Champions League and World Cup. 

I never lose motivation, the Barcelona forward said in an interview. I have been lucky enough to have won lots of titles with my teams and at an individual level at quite a young age. 

Now that I know just how nice it is to win those things once, the motivation comes from wanting to win everything lots of times, to do it again and keep on winning. 

The ever-smiling, frizzy-haired Brazilian, who turned 26 this week, is the undisputed king of world football at the moment. He retained his World Player of the Year crown last December and added the prestigious Ballon DOr for European Footballer of the Year and the FIFPro World Player award voted by fellow-professionals to his burgeoning collection of individual awards. 

As for team trophies, he played an instrumental role in Brazils triumph in the 2002 World Cup, scoring a memorable 35-metre lob against England in the quarters, and last season steered Barcelona to their first league title in six years. 

Barcelona are on course to retaining the title and have reached the last eight of the Champions League playing the most attractive football on the continent, while Brazil are the undisputed favourites to win this years World Cup for a sixth time. 

Ronaldinho says he is delighted to be playing for the two sides seen as the leading exponents of what the Brazilians like to call jogo bonito (beautiful game). He shows this off in an advertisement for sponsors Nike to be released shortly. 

Every team has a style of its own and ours at Barcelona really suits us right now. Its a jogo bonito style, very attacking, always trying to score goals. There are other types of football that can get you results but ours is a style that people like to see. I really enjoy playing at Barcelona.

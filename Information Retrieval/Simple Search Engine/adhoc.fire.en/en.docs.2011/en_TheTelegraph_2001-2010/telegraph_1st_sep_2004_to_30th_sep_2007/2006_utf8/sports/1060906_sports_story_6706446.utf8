Paris: The sniping has started between Italy and France ahead of Wednesdays World Cup final rematch. Lilian Thuram insists Les Bleus deserved to win the World Cup, while Gennaro Gattuso says that if there was a championship for sore losers then France would win it easily. I know we usually complain after losses, but they do it even more, Gattuso said. Italy are second to France in that. 

Wednesdays 2008 European Championship qualifier at the Stade de France is already important. A win would put France five points clear of Italy which drew its opening qualifier 1-1 at home to Lithuania. France won 3-0 at Georgia. 

Its obvious that we will want to win this match even more than in Georgia, Thuram said. Italys result is a good thing for the remainder of the competition. 

The Azzurri have only one point in group B. Scotland, Georgia and France lead the standings with three points each. Its decisive. There are three points up for grabs and were coming off a game where an expected three points didnt come, Gattuso said. We know its a big game. Were motivated. 

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Olof Mellberg and Christian Wilhemsson were dismissed from Swedens roster for Wednesdays European championship qualifier against Liechtenstein because they missed a team curfew. 

Coach Lars Lagerback gave his players the afternoon off on Sunday, but ordered them to return to the team hotel in Goteborg by 11 pm. Ibrahimovic, Mellberg and Wilhemsson did not report until 1:15 am., the Swedish football association said in statement. 

England coach Steve McClaren is optimistic that centre-back Rio Ferdinand will return to the side when they face Macedonia in a tough qualifier also on Wednesday. 

Ferdinand, who missed Saturdays opening 5-0 win over Andorra at Old Trafford, is expected to play if he comes through a training session later on Tuesday without incident, McClaren told a news conference before their group E match. 

He came through training on Monday and will train again this afternoon and provided he comes through without reaction then I will decide on my team, added McClaren.

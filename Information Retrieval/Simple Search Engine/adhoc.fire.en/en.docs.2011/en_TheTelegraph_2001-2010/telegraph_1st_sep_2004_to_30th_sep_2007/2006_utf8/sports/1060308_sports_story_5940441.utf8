 Ashes quartet back in business

 Martyn makes a comeback

Sydney: Australia have recalled four of the players involved in last years unsuccessful Ashes campaign for their March 16-April 4 Test series in South Africa. The selectors recalled specialist middle-order batsmen Damien Martyn and Michael Clarke, while dropping Brad Hodge from their 14-man squad. 

Fast bowlers Shaun Tait and Michael Kasprowicz have also been recalled at the expense of Nathan Bracken. Glenn McGrath has made himself unavailable. 

Weve put together a squad to cover what we believe is going to be a tough Test series in South Africa, chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said in a statement on Tuesday. 

Weve taken into account the fact that three Tests are virtually back-to-back and we believe weve got adequate cover in this squad to manage that tight schedule. 

Martyn was dropped after the Ashes defeat in England while Clarke lost his place to Hodge after the second Test against the West Indies in December.

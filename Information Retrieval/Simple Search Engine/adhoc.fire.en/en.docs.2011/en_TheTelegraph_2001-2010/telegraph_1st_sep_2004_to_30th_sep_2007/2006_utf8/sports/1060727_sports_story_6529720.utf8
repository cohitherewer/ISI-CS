 10 ducks, 5 extras... 

London: It could not get worse for a local cricket team of north Yorkshire. Ten of its players were out for ducks, leaving the team with a total of 5 ? all of which were scored through extras. It was definitely a day to forget for Goldsborough Second XI in their match against Dishforth. Interestingly, all the ten wickets fell to catches, each batsman having managed to strike the ball. 

Undeterred, the team set about defending their meagre total and snapped up two quick wickets without conceding a run. The third batsman for Dishforth earned victory for his team through the only runs to come from the bat in the match. (PTI)

Bridgetown: If the Queens Park Oval in pretty Port-of-Spain saw the mother of all celebrations after the West Indies hammered India 4-1, with senior pro Chris Gayle uncorking the biggest bottle of champagne this side of the Atlantic, Knaggs Hill would surely have seen the party of this Millennium on Sunday night. 

Reason being captain Brian Lara invited his team to his residence for celebrating what has to rank as an extraordinary effort. The West Indies began the Digicel series as underdogs, but recovered after losing the first match (on the penultimate ball) to crush Team India both on the ground and in the mind. 

In time, coach Greg Chappell will regret having said the West Indies have forgotten to win. As Lara pointed out, that remark (after ODI No. 1) gave his team the fillip to raise the bar and send the ICC rankings for a toss. 

From No. 3 at the start, five ahead of the West Indies, India have slipped to No. 5. 

A shade over two months ago, a severely under-strength England beat India in Mumbai to draw the Test series. At the Queens Park Oval, Lara rested three regulars (Marlon Samuels, Ian Bradshaw and Fidel Edwards) and out, too, was keeper Carlton Baugh (Jr). Yet, the West Indies didnt have to stretch every sinew in winning by 19 runs. 

The Indians bowled poorly and fielded pathetically. Then, chasing 256, they crashed to 236 in 48 overs despite a very healthy 170 for four in the 32nd over. Virender Sehwag again scored 90-plus, but barring 20s from Yuvraj Singh (hed looked in great touch), Harbhajan Singh and Ajit Agarkar, nobody made even a token contribution. 

Unbelievably, the Indians couldnt reach the series highest target even though frontline quick Corey Colleymore got injured within minutes of the chase and couldnt send down a single ball. 

First-timer Dave Mohammed picked up three wickets, prompting Rahul Dravid (who was run out) to acknowledge that the West Indies utilised the conditions much better. Jerome Taylor also got three, the damage being done in the later stages. 

Earlier this year, the one-day team ensured a bounce-back after India lost the Test series in Pakistan. This time, Dravid is hoping the Test team does likewise. Weve got to regroup and bounce back... We didnt play to potential and that hurts... However, theres no point getting emotional... 

Dravid conceded the last two ODIs had been the most disappointing since he got the captaincy full-time eight months ago. We were out-fielded and the batsmen kept falling short by 15-20... We failed to rotate the strike as well... We missed Sachin Tendulkar, but Im not going to say these boys arent good enough... Wont be the right thing at this point in time... 

While Dravid has been left licking his wounds, Lara is on Cloud Nine. 

He didnt comment when asked if the Indians had themselves forgotten to win, but did say: Im very proud of the boys, but weve got bigger fish to fry... Were better than Indias current one-day team, but Test cricket is the ultimate test and well have to be consistent over 15 sessions in each match... 

Lara didnt quite agree that the psychological advantage is with his team. This was one-day cricket and it has been done and dusted with... India have Anil Kumble and Harbhajan and are going to return fresh from the drawing board... Having said that, were definitely taking positives from this series... 

Asked if there was a secret behind the West Indies turnaround, Lara replied: Its in team meetings that we win matches... The meetings could be at nine in the morning or six in the evening, but I know the boys come away with confidence enhanced... Thats it... 

While Dravid copes with a somewhat unusual situation, he hasnt lost faith. Indeed, The Telegraph was around at the Hilton, in Port-of-Spain, when he told a well-wisher but, you should be staying on for the Test series... Well win it... 

One assumes fingers have to be kept crossed. 

Dwayne Bravo was adjudged MoM on Sunday, too (edging out Sehwag). The in-superb-form Ramnaresh Sarwan got the Man-of-the-Series award. He had scores of 2, 98 not out, 115 not out, 6 and 52. No wonder Lara has called him the batsman of the team. 

Interacting with the Media, Sarwan maintained he was always seeking to improve and wanted to be as consistent as Lara, Sachin, Dravid and Ricky Ponting. When I end, I would like to be remembered as a great player, he declared. 

Sarwan is on track. 

Footnote: Lara bid farewell to ODIs at the Queens Park Oval and, with a touch of emotion, remarked I would love to play one more Test on my home ground... He thanked Trinis for such overwhelming support, saying that while he may not always have delivered, both sides can shake hands for a wonderful association.

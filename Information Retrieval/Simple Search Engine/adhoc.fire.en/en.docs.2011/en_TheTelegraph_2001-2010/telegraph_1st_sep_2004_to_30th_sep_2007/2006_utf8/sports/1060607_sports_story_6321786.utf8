The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS

 Wasim 

 Jaffer (212) became the fourth Indian to record a double 

 century in the Caribbean, the others being Dilip Sardesai 

 (212 in Kingston, 1970-71), Sunil Gavaskar (220 in Port-of-Spain, 

 1970-71) and Navjyot Singh Sidhu (201 in Port-of-Spain, 

 1996-97)

 Sixteen 

 Indian batsmen have now scored 31 double hundreds in Tests, 

 with Rahul Dravid hitting the maximum of five

 Jaffers 

 score is the highest by any visiting batsman at the Antigua 

 Recreation Ground (ARG), bettering Matthew Haydens 

 177 in 2002-03. The previous best by an Indian at the ARG 

 was VVS Laxmans 130 in 2001-02

 The 

 last batsman before Jaffer to score a double century vs 

 the West Indies was Englishman Robert Key (221 at Lords, 

 2004), while the last to do so against the Windies on Caribbean 

 soil was Ricky Ponting (206 in Port-of-Spain, 2002-03)

 Rahul 

 Dravid, during his knock of 62, became the ninth Indian 

 (and the 40th overall) to aggregate 1000-plus runs against 

 the Windies. He now has 1023 runs in 14 matches

 The 

 203-run stand between Jaffer and Dravid was Indias 

 best for the third wicket against the West Indies obliterating 

 the 177-run partnership between Sidhu and Sachin Tendulkar 

 in Nagpur in 1994-95

 Dravid 

 has now been involved in 60 century stands in Tests ? the 

 most by an Indian (Sachin Tendulkar has featured in 59). 

 Only Steve Waugh (64) and Allan Border (63) are ahead of 

 the Indian captain

 Mahendra 

 Singh Dhoni joined two other Indians ? Ravi Shastri (during 

 his 121* vs Australia in Bombay, 1986-87) and Virender Sehwag 

 (during his 309 vs Pakistan in Multan, 2003-04) ? in having 

 hit six sixes in a Test innings. The Indian record belongs 

 to Sidhu, who hit eight overboundaries in his 124 against 

 Sri Lanka in Lucknow, 1993-94

 Only 

 Andrew Flintoff has hit more sixes against the Windies. 

 The Englishman smashed seven sixes in his knock of 167 at 

 Edgbaston in 2004

 During 

 his blistering 69, Dhoni, became the sixth batsman in Test 

 history to hit three sixes in a row in the same over. The 

 record, four consecutive sixes, is held by Kapil Dev and 

 Shahid Afridi

 Dave 

 Mohammed now has the dubious record of conceding most runs 

 (162) by a West Indian vs India. Former paceman Norbert 

 Phillip had conceded 159 in Delhi, 1978-79

 Indias 

 521/6 declared was their highest total in the Caribbean, 

 eclipsing the 513/9 declared at this very ground in 2001-02

 ICC rejects Pak demand on Hair 

 CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

 Hair 

 Karachi: Pakistans 

 demand that Australian umpire Darrell Hair should not be 

 appointed at next months Champions Trophy has been 

 rejected by the International Cricket Council (ICC).

 The ICC has said that responsibility 

 of appointing umpires was given to it by the executive board 

 and no country should make such demands on it, a Pakistan 

 Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Friday.

 In the next few days, the ICC 

 is due to announce the umpires for the Champions Trophy 

 being held from October 7 in India.

 Following the ball-tampering row 

 with Hair in The Oval Test against England last month, the 

 Pakistan board had written to the ICC insisting he should 

 not be posted in the tournament due to his controversial 

 nature.

 The Pakistan team refused to play 

 on in the fourth Test after Hair and fellow umpire Billy 

 Doctrove changed the ball and penalised them five runs for 

 alleged ball-tampering.

 The umpires awarded the Test to 

 England and the ICC later charged captain Inzamam-u Haq 

 with several violations of its Code of Conduct and he is 

 due to attend a two-day hearing in London from September 

 27.

 The letter had been sent 

 to the ICC president, Percy Sonn, in which we had expressed 

 our reservations if Hair was appointed, said the official, 

 who declined to be named.

 The official added that in the 

 reply, the ICC said it could not accept member countries 

 dictating the appointment of umpires and Hair, being on 

 the Elite panel, would be considered.

 Sandipan beats Cruz in Round II

Panaji: GM Sandipan Chanda beat Wilson Cruz in the second round of the Smt Hirbai Salgaocar All India Fide-rated Chess meet at Miramar on Monday. 

In another match, IM Vishal Sareen was humbled by Standrik Colaco. 

In a Ruy Lopez game, Vishal varied with an early D4. However, Standrik made some smart moves, finishing the game in 64 moves and checkmating his fancied opponent. 

Colacos win over the coach of GM Parimarjan Negi came with black pieces and he said that he would use this game to inspire students learning the game under him to perform better in the upcoming rounds. 

World champion (U-12) N. Srinath also had to bite the dust on Monday against lesser-known Himal Gusain. In the English attack of the Sicilian Najdorf, Gusain managed to outwit the world champion who had recently finished second at the Dubai junior tournament. 

 Local challengers Suhas Asnodkar and Sumit Asnodkar lost on Monday.

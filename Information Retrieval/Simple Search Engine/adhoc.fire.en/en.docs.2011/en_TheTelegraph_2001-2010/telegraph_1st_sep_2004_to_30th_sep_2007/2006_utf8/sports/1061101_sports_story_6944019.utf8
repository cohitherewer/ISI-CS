 Arsenal up against miserly CSKA

London: Arsenal will have to unlock a miserly CSKA Moscow defence on Wednesday if they are to get their Champions League campaign back on track. 

Manager Arsene Wenger believes his side were over-confident before the 0-1 group G defeat in Moscow two weeks ago that put CSKA top of the standings. 

The Russians are still to concede a goal in the group and Wenger has warned his Arsenal players that they cannot afford any repeat of the poor performance when the sides meet again at the Emirates Stadium. 

I was very confident beforehand but I feel overall as a team we were too confident to go (to Moscow) and take the points, Wenger said on Arsenals Web site on Tuesday. 

We had been warned because we were told by Porto they were a difficult side to beat. But we only came into the game at 1-0 down. 

When you play against a team that defends so deep and plays so well on the counter-attack you make the job even harder when you go 1-0 down. 

CSKA have seven points from three games, one more than last years runners-up Arsenal who could have striker Emmanuel Adebayor back in contention after recovering from a thigh injury. 

He has recovered very well and may be ready for Moscow, Wenger said. 

Freddie Ljungberg is unlikely to be fit, however, having missed Saturdays 1-1 home draw with Everton because of a calf injury sustained playing for Sweden.

 QUICK TAKES

 Nalbandian 

 a victim of World Cup fever 

 London: Sympathetic Wimbledon 

 organisers agreed to allow David Nalbandian to play his 

 third-round match early on Friday so he could watch Argentina 

 take on Germany in the soccer World Cup. 

The Argentine fourth seed promptly suffered an upset at the hands of Spaniard Fernando Verdasco on distant court 13. Spain are already out of the tournament. 

 Referee Andrew Jarrett said it was not always possible 

 to comply with players scheduling demands. David 

 made it known he would like to watch the football, 

 he said. In this instance we were able to accommodate 

 (the request).

 Maradona, Pele lead All-Stars 

 Berlin: Imagine a strike force of Maradona, Pele, Ronaldo and Marco van Basten. The quartet led a dream team picked by 20 current World Cup players plus tournament head Franz Beckenbauer. Each was asked by Fifaworldcup.com to pick their best 11, including themselves. 

Brazilians Roberto Carlos and Cafu were clear choices at wingback, with Paolo Maldini and Sir Bobby Moore joining them in defence. There was no clear winner in goal with Peter Schmeichel, Gianluigi Buffon, Iker Casillas, Petr Cech and Fabien Barthez all getting equal consideration. Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira were the players favourites in the midfield. 

 Players polled included David Beckham, Juan Roman 

 Riquelme, Steve Gerrard, Alessandro Nesta and Raul. Germanys 

 Lukas Podolski picked his father, a former defender, and 

 fellow German Bastian Schweinsteiger selected his brother, 

 Tobias.

 National fervour poles 

 apart 

 Berlin: France fall well behind Brazil when it comes to national fervour for soccer. France striker Thierry Henry feels there is just no comparison between the two countries. We dont have the (soccer) identity. Its different. Brazil is Brazil, Henry said Thursday, adding that Brazil are ahead of us in terms of this. 

 On the beach, they play football; on the street, 

 they play football; in shopping malls, they play football; 

 on the motorway, they stop to play football, Henry 

 said. They play football since the day they are born.

 Aragones to stay till 

 08 

 Madrid: Luis Aragones will continue as Spain 

 coach until Euro 2008. The (Spanish Football) Federation 

 were pleased with my work and this motivated me to extend 

 my contract, Aragones said on Friday. Before the competition 

 he said he would quit if Spain did not reach the semi-finals. 

 Street named after Klinsmann 

 Berlin: The town where Germanys coach 

 grew up has named a street after him. And the south-western 

 town of Geislingen saw no need to wait for him to deliver 

 the trophy before honouring him. On Thursday, the new Juergen-Klinsmann-Weg 

 street sign was unveiled on a street that runs alongside 

 the local soccer teams stadium.

 High security 

 Gelsenkirchen: Police from three countries 

 met here on Friday to iron out the details over keeping 

 the peace as nearly 100,000 fans began arriving for Englands 

 quarter final match against Portugal. Police have estimated 

 that as many as 70,000 England fans are expected in the 

 city for Saturdays match, along with another 15,000 

 Portugal fans. 

 Bookie bonanza 

 Frankfurt: Englands World Cup quarter 

 final clash with Portugal on Saturday promises to be the 

 biggest betting match in the teams history. Bookmaker 

 William Hill is expecting more than one million bets to 

 be placed on England winning and going on to capture the 

 World Cup. The bookmaker has already taken a record ?200,000 

 bet on England winning the World Cup, which would have a 

 return of ?1.4 million.

 Neill tipped 

 Sydney: Lucas Neill would be an ideal candidate to captain Australia if current skipper Mark Viduka calls time on his career, according to assistant coach Graham Arnold. The 28-year-old had an outstanding Cup before his stoppage-time foul on Fabio Grosso gave Italy the penalty that earned them a 1-0 win and a place in the quarters.

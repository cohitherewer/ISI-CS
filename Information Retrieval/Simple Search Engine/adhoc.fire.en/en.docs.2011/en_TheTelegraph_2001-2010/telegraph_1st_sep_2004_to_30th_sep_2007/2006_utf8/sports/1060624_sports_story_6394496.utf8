 It still is the Maradona show

Herzogenaurach: Argentinian soccer remains the Diego Maradona show. 

Regarded by some as the games greatest player, Argentinas legendary No. 10 pops up unannounced at the countrys World Cup practises in northern Bavaria, often puffing on an oversized Cuban cigar as he struts in and out of the team hotel with his estranged wife and their daughter. 

At Argentinas first-round matches, he upstaged coach Jose Pekerman with pre-game pep talks for players young enough to be his sons. 

One of them, 18-year-old striker Lionel Messi, has been dubbed the next Maradona. He had yet to be born when Maradona led Argentina to its second World Cup title in 1986. 

Maradona inspires us and he gets our greatest respect, said Carlos Tevez, a 22-year-old striker who, like Maradona, grew up in a Buenos Aries shantytown. 

Hes our idol, and an idol for the people, added Tevez, who also was billed as the next Maradona until Messi came along. (AP)

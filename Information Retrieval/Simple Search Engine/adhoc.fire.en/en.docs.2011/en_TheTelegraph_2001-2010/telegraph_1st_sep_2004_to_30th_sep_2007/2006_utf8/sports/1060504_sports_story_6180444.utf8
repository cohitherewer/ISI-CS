 Gray accuses India of influencing ICC

Melbourne: Former ICC president Malcolm Gray, has flayed the decision to allot every third World Cup to the sub-continent and accused India of using undue clout to influence the decision of the ICCs executive board. 

Gray said that allotting the 2011 World Cup to Asia had broken the ICCs rotational policy. This (allotting the 2011 World Cup to the sub-continent) unfortunately has broken that and for the sake of the game I think it would be better if it did go around in order, the former ICC chief said. 

In the past, India has used the power of programming to get the votes of the lesser countries. Im well away from it now, so whether thats still the case I dont know, but you have to suspect that. (PTI)

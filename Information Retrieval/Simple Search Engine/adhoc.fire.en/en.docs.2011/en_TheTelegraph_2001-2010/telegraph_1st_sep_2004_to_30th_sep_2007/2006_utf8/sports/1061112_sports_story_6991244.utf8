 Drogba hattrick in Chelsea win

London: Striker Didier Drogba scored a hattrick as Chelsea trounced Watford 4-0 to put the pressure on Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday. 

The Ivory Coast forward killed the game with two first-half goals as the champions joined United on 28 points. 

Striker Andriy Shevchenko made it 3-0 in the 52nd minute and Drogba brought up his hattrick in the 69th as Chelsea shrugged off last weekends defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. 

Martin Neills Aston Villa moved up to third place after they beat Everton 1-0 away and two rivals slipped up Bolton Wanderers squandering a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw at Sheffield United and Portsmouth held 1-1 at home by Fulham. 

West Ham United, late winners over Arsenal last weekend, lost 0-1 at Middlesbrough, Newcastle United drew 0-0 at Manchester City and Wigan Athletic beat Charlton Athletic 3-2.

 Jeev Milkha tied 43rd 

Majorca: Notwithstanding his error-riddled five-over 75 in the second round, Jeev Milkha Singh managed to get into the weekend rounds of the Mallorca Classic Tournament at the pula golf resort here. 

Jeev, with six-over for two days, is now at tied 43rd position in the tournament, which is the last full field event on the European Tour. 

He had bogeys on second, ninth, 12th, 13th and 14th and 17th. His only birdie was on the 15th. He struggled to get on the fairways and had less than 50 per greens in regulation. 

The joint leaders were Niclas Fasth (71) of Sweden and Irelands Gary Murphy (71), who were three-under on 137. 

Padraig Harrington, looking to win in Mallorca to try and overhaul Paul Casey in the race for the Order of Merit title, failed as he missed the cut. He may now need to win the season-ending Volvo Masters in Valderrama next week to beat Briton Casey to the Order of Merit title. Harrington had rounds of 77 and 74.

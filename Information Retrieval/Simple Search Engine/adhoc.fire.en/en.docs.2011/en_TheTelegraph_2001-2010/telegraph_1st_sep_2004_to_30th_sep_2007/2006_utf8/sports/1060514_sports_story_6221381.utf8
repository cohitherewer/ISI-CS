 High-profile JSCA elections today

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Ever since the day Sudesh Mahto decided to throw his hat into the ring, the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) elections assumed a different dimension. 

That Mahto will fight for the presidents post against incumbent Amitabh Choudhary was confirmed in a report published by The Telegraphs Jamshedpur edition on May 4. 

Mahto happens to be the states home minister, while Choudhary is the inspector-general (Human Rights). No wonder Sundays elections, to be held at Bokaros Community Centre, have become a high-profile affair. 

Both camps have spared no effort to impress the voters. The outcome, though, will depend on the 420 new life members from the JSCA-affiliated districts. 

Choudhary is banking on the votes of these new members as he had played a major role in inducting them into the JSCA. 

I have been confident of winning from the day I filed my nomination on April 30, Choudhary said from Bokaro. 

He added that he has full faith in the members as they are all mature and wise. I would expect them to vote as per their conscience. I have treated the JSCA as my child, said Choudhary. 

Mahtos supporters, however, claimed that they have been able to make a considerable dent into Choudharys citadel. 

The minister has been personally speaking to these 420 new members from the districts. It has worked in his favour, said an aide. 

Some JSCA members alleged that Mahtos supporters, including some with political background, are pressurising them to vote for the minister. 

There are a total of 955 members in the JSCA.

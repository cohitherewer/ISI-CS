The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India lose 0-6

 AFC Women's Meet

 New Delhi: Indian girls 

 put up a much improved display but still went down 0-6 to 

 Japan in the AFC Under-19 Womens Championship in Kuala 

 Lumpur on Wednesday.

 It was Japans third straight 

 win in the group after difficult victories over North Korea 

 (3-0) and South Korea (2-1). It ensured that they qualified 

 for the semi-finals as winners of group A ahead of North 

 Korea.

 Mei Sato and Yuki Nagasato scored 

 two goals each, while Nodoka Hosaka and Aya Sameshima also 

 scored.

 India, however, impressed with 

 their never-say-die attitude and courage.

 Harjinder Singhs side showed 

 more resilience on Wednesday but failed to cope with Japans 

 possession football. (PTI)

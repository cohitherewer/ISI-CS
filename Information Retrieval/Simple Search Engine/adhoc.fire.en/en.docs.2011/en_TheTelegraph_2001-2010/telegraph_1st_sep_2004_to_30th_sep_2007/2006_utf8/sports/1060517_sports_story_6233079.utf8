 Anand draws with Svidler, shares lead

Sofia: Viswanathan Anand played out a safe draw with former Russian champion Peter Svidler to move into joint lead after the fifth round of the MTEL Masters Chess tournament here. 

On another exciting day in the Category 20 meet, world champion Veselin Topalov defeated overnight leader Gata Kamsky of the US in a highly instructive game. This result gave the Indian a share of the lead as he was trailing Kamsky by half a point. 

The duel between former world champion Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine and Etienne Bacrot of France ended in a draw. 

At the halfway stage, both Kamsky and Anand have 3.5 points each while Topalov and Svidler are on 2.5 apiece. Ponomariov and Bacrot (1.5 each) bring up the rear. Five rounds remain in the strongest tournament of the year. 

Anand did not face any trouble with his black pieces against Svidler in the Ruy Lopez closed opening by the latter. 

Coming out with a relatively new plan in the opening, Anand parted with his two bishops for two white knights early in the middlegame and posted his own knights in desirable squares to maintain the balance. 

Svidler was forced to exchange another set of minor pieces when Anand made some headway and thereafter it was a nearly impregnable position where Svidler repeated moves to call truce after 38 moves. 

After drawing three of his first four games with a sole loss against Anand, Topalov was brilliance personified against Kamsky. 

The Bulgarian defending champion knew if he had to retain chances to be in the title-race, he had to beat Kamsky and he did that in great style. 

The Bulgarian is known for his uncompromising play and Kamsky learned it the hard way just while he thought he had a reasonable position out of his Slav Defence as black. 

Topalov played the opening like a book retaining slight advantage after several manoeuvres while in the middlegame, the onlookers were treated to tactical magic when he sacrificed an exchange to get the king side attack rolling. 

Resourceful as he is, Kamsky came up with some good defence but the position was just too difficult to salvage. 

Tightening the noose, Topalov continued to exert pressure on the kingside and in the end, when he forcibly won Kamskys queen, the Russian-turned-American did not have any reason to continue the game. Topalovs first victory in the meet came after 42 moves. 

Ponomariov opted for the anti-Marshall as white against Bacrot without much success. 

It was intense middlegame in which Ponomariov was striving for a kingside attack but the Frenchman kept his guard on and even subtle exchange leading to some weaknesses in the Bacrots position did not prove good enough. 

After the trading of both the rooks, the players arrived at a queen-and-pawn endgame where peace was signed after 47 moves. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 24-run win for Australia 

Port Elizabeth: Australia, thrashed by 196 runs two days ago, bounced back to beat South Africa by 24 runs in the third one-day International on Sunday. Australia made 254 for six and then bowled out South Africa for 230, Brett Lee finishing with four for 48. South Africa lead the five-match series 2-1. The next game is on Friday in Durban. 

South Africa slumped to 69 for five before AB de Villiers, with a career-best 68, and Shaun Pollock (69) added 119 in 22 overs and brought the home side back into contention. 

But a sensational boundary catch by Brad Hogg, leaping one-handed above his head, dismissed de Villiers off the useful left-arm spin of Michael Clarke. 

Shane Watson bowled Pollock to end his dazzling 74-ball innings and South Africa were out of the hunt despite a late flourish from Roger Telemachus who struck three mighty sixes in his 29 off 13 balls.

 Hari inches closer to title

 Hari drew with Wang Yue of China 

Paks (Hungary): Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna inched closer to his maiden crown on Hungarian soil with a quick draw with Grandmaster Wang Yue of China in the ninth and penultimate round of the third Marx Gyorgy Memorial International chess tournament here. 

The Indian GM took his tally to an unassailable six points, full point clear of nearest rival GM Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine, who shared honours with defending champion GM Zoltan Almasi of Hungary. 

The other game of the day was also a stalemate between Hungarian GMs Peter Acs and Ferenc Berkes. 

With Harikrishna just a draw away from the title, and Efimenko almost sure of second place, the fight for third spot is still on with Almasi and Wang level on 4.5 points. 

Berkes is sole fifth in the category-15 double round robin event on four points, while Acs is languishing at the bottom of the standings with three. 

In the final round, Harikrishna will face Berkes, who will have the advantage of playing white. 

However, going by the trend here so far, it seems unlikely that Berkes will give it a real shot against Harikrishna and a draw seems the most likely result. 

Even if Harikrishna loses and Efimenko fails to defeat Acs, the Indian will still win the title outright. 

The other match of the final round is between Wang and Almasi. 

Harikrishna did the needful against Wang who played the black side of a Slav Defence. Harikrishna declared his peaceful intentions by going for the exchange variation and the result was a draw in just 10 moves.

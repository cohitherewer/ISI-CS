 India colts thump England by 41 runs

London: A scintillating allround effort by the Indian U-19 team helped outsmart their English counterparts as the visitors posted a convincing 41-run win in the opening one-dayer at Derby. 

Three half-centuries by skipper Tanmay Srivastav (64), Uday Kaul (62) and Virat Kohli (64 ..) helped India put on a challenging 249 for four on board in 50 overs after electing to bat in the first of three day and night encounters at the County ground. 

The bowlers followed up the good job and folded up the hosts for just 186 in 38.3 overs. An effective spin-pace combination of Vijaykumar Yo Mahesh (3/35) and Shahbaz Nadeem (2/29) found the English batsmen on murky waters. 

The Indian team had a fine day in the outfield as well as three batters fell short of their crease. 

India lost two wickets with 33 runs on the board but Kaul and captain Srivastava batted with patience and forged a crucial 104-run partnership for the third wicket. Both the batsmen scored five boundaries each. 

After the fall of Kaul, Kohli provided the late charge with a strokeful 64 runs from 61 balls which included six boundaries. For the hosts, Mark Nelson and Moeen Ali picked two wickets each. 

Yo Mahesh was the pick of the Indian bowlers ? claiming three wickets in 8.3 overs while left-arm spinner Nadeem picked up two, giving away 29 runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Due diligence reveals all 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The due diligence report, which is in the possession of The Telegraph, sums up in its executive summary that there has been a total breakdown in the RCTCs accounting system between 2004 and 2006. That clearly signifies the professional incompetence of the two CFOs, Debashis Chakraborty and Anurita Ghosh, and of the stewards who had been at the helm during the period Sujit Bhattacharyya, J.N. Sapru, P.C. Lall, Deepak Khaitan, and, of course, Gen. (Rtrd.) Shankar Roychowdhury, then the senior. Barring P.C.Lall, presently the chief steward, the rest, including the two CFOs, have resigned.

 The SNS Associates, a Chennai-based chartered accountant firm which prepared the due diligence report, has observed that big pay-outs were made on self-authorised vouchers (against the norms set out in the stewards meeting). The finance sub-committee to deal with major financial activities was practically treated as a doormat during the period, says the report.

 Huge payments through cash/ bearer cheques were made against fictitious names and most of the vouchers and related documents pertaining to renovation work of office building in the racecourse and also construction work at the Russell Street could not be provided to the auditors by the then CFO, Anurita Ghosh. Ghosh had taken charge last year.

 The due diligence summary also questions the identity of beneficiaries pertaining to the payment of Rs 30 lakh, being the commission charges paid towards securing a loan of Rs 15 crore from the UCO Banks Park Street branch. The auditors did not come across documents which showed any contractual obligations made by the RCTC with any of the parties involved in loan syndication. 

 One Strategic Finance and Evoloution Consortium was separately paid Rs 20.81 lakh for reasons unknown. Another bill from the company, for Rs 29 lakh, would have been settled had the scam not come to light. An amount of Rs 12.08 lakh was paid to one Creative Design Group (architects of the club).

 One Gaurav Mitra, a chartered accountant who was assigned project consultancy (City Club) had asked the payment to be released in three different names. Accordingly three payments, totaling Rs 30 lakh, were released through bearer cheques. The stewards had approved all bills for payment without scrutinising the documents. Bhattacharyya and Sapru had attended most of the stewards meetings, normally chaired by Lall. 

 Advances of Rs 3.74 crore, against the sanctioned loan from UCO Bank, was meant for the Club project but it channelled into different directions, without a brick being laid for the purpose.

 Pak win series 

 - Lara crosses 10000-mark 

Karachi: Mohammad Hafeez missed out on his maiden hundred by eight runs and Kamran Akmal scored 56 to guide Pakistan to a seven-wicket win over the West Indies in the fifth and final ODI on Saturday. 

Pakistan swept to a 3-1 series win after reaching 239 for three in 46.5 overs in reply to the tourists score of 238 for seven. 

Hafeez smashed 92 from 111 balls with five fours and two sixes. 

Shivnarine Chanderpaul had led the West Indian innings by scoring his fourth hundred in 205 one-day Internationals, while skipper Brian Lara (44) crossed the 10,000-run mark in one-dayers. 

Although Lara became the fifth batsman after Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Sanath Jayasuriya and Inzamam-ul Haq to reach the milestone, he could not prevent Pakistans victory charge.

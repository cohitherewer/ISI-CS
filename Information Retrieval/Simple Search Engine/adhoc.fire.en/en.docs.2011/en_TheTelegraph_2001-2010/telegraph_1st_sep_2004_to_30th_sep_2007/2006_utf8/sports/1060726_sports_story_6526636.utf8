 New Delhi: India defeated South Africa to register their third consecutive win and move into the quarter finals of the 14th World Junior Men?s Squash Championships in New Zealand on Tuesday.

 India beat South Africa 2-1 to ensure a rare top eight finish. India?s top junior player Sandeep Jangra needed 35 minutes to outclass Richard Corburn 9-7, 9-5, 9-2. Naresh Kumar, however, lost to 9-5, 1-9, 5-9, 4-9 to Rudi Willemse. Harinderpal Singh, then defeated Jason Cole Niven 9-3, 7-9, 9-5, 9-7 to clinch the tie for India.

 New Delhi: World No. 20 Chetan Anand and Trupti Murgunde will spearhead the Indian badminton campaign at the South Asian Federation Games in Colombo starting August 17. However, Saina Nehwal will not be taking the flight to Sri Lanka as the dates for the event are clashing with the Korean Open and Hong Kong Open where the Badminton Association of India is sending a separate team.

 London: Chris DiMarco, runner-up at last weekend?s British Open, and 2005 US Open champion Michael Campbell were named on Tuesday among the first players for the inaugural Goodwill Trophy to be held in China in November.

 The tournament has been developed as a collaborative event between China?s Mission Hills Golf Club and the Celtic Manor Resort ? host of the 2010 Ryder Cup ? to enhance trade, tourism and cultural exchange between the UK and China through golf.

 Zagreb: Former Croatian international Slaven Bilic was selected as the team?s new coach on Tuesday, replacing Zlatko Kranjcar after a poor performance at the World Cup.

 The 37-year-old former defender, who was part of Croatia?s team that finished third at the 1998 World Cup, had received widespread support since the search for a new coach began earlier this month.

 The terms of Bilic?s deal were not immediately disclosed. Bilic played with Hajduk Split, German club Karlsrueher SC, and England?s West Ham and Everton. He retired from playing in 2001 and started coaching the Croatian youth team.

 Bilic said his first task is to prepare for the 2008 European Championship qualifiers against England and Russia. He will have another former Croatian international, Aljosa Asanovic, as his assistant. 

 Buenos Aires: Argentinian legend Diego Maradona has ruled himself out of the coaching job at his former club Boca Juniors, saying he did not have enough experience.

 Maradona, a vice-president at Boca, had been linked to the position after club boss Mauricio Macri urged the 1986 World Cup-winning captain to consider taking the helm following the departure of Alfio Basile.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

The pressure is getting to Sania

Surfing high on a wave of adulation and hype, Sania 

Mirza tumbled to a straight-set defeat against 16-year-old Michaella Krajicek 

of the Netherlands in the second round of the Australian open. Sania wrote in 

her colum that a little breeze upset her timing and that she did not 

have the feel of the ball on a frustrating day. In the 

intensive heat she may have found a light breeze refreshing had she 

won.

She may have had an off day, as all players do. But 

I have a suspicion that the pressure of lofty expectations is getting to Sania, 

specially the fear of defeat to a lower-ranking player. These two factors may 

also have affected her game. There is a world of difference in your standard of 

play when you have nothing to lose and can play with abandon and when you have 

everything to lose.

The tension affects your movement and reflexes. Just 

compare Sanias matches last year against Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova 

and her performance against Krajicek. You can see the difference in the standard 

of play.

The great Vijay Amritraj never came to terms with 

this. He was a different player when he took on the likes of Borg and Connors 

and tended to clamp up against lower-ranked players. Expectations 

of Grand Slam success are not close to reality and a crushing burden for Sania 

to carry. We can treat Sanias early loss like a stock market correction. 

It is no way a reflection of her potential.

The top notchers in womens tennis are wary of 

her and Sania, with luck, has the game to beat some of them. But tackling the 

host of youngsters on the way up and older experienced players will be a more 

difficult task.

One cannot get to the top without being severely pummelled 

in the gauntlet of the various tournaments on the circuit. Climbing higher from 

rankings between 20 and 30 is like facing a sheer cliff. While you try to drive 

the pitons into the rock, other hopefuls are trying to pull you down. The second 

year on the circuit is the most difficult. At the end of the first year all the 

players know your weaknesses and strengths and how best to tackle your game. 

It will be expecting too much from any coach, even 

from Tony Roche, to change her service action in just a fortnight or teach her 

to attack and volley. Frankly speaking, it seems nearly impossible to change her 

service action when she is already 19 years of age. 

If you watch Sanias service action in one of 

the TV ads she features in, you may be able to spot the glitch in her shoulder 

rotation. If she tries to change, she will need to take off atleast three months 

and will lose valuable points and plummet in the rankings. 

At best they can try to make adjustments rather than 

completely change and help her to develop variety and depth on her service. To 

make up for the loss in service power, Sania needs to develop a higher level of 

consistency on her ground shots. One imperious shot is not enough.

She will need to scramble helter skelter and grind 

out and win points after long rallies. All this will require higher level of strength 

and fitness. The promising teenagers one sees nowadays seem to be stronger and 

far more athletic than Sania. The ace up Sanias sleeve is her ability to 

hit clean winners. 

Elena Dementieva is a top tenner with a poor serve. 

She overcomes a peculiar sliced serve dotted with double faults with her rock 

solid consistent ground shots, unbelievable tenacity and physical strength. I 

am sure in a couple of years if Sania can persevere, at a level beyond the word, 

she can climb higher in the rankings. Till then, Sania will have losses to lower-ranked 

players but may also beat some top notchers.

New York: Rafael Nadal was upset on Wednesday in the US Open quarter finals by 54th-ranked Mikhail Youzhny of Russia 3-6, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6 thwarting an anticipated third-straight meeting against Roger Federer in the final of a Grand Slam. 

Unbelievable, Youzhny said. I cannot believe I beat Rafa in four sets. 

Youzhny never before had been beyond the fourth round of a major tournament. 

Andy Roddick capped a busy day at Flushing Meadows by beating fellow former champion Leyton Hewitt 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 to reach the semi-finals for the first time since he won the tournament in 2003. 

Well, I guess I can play tennis a little bit again, Roddick said. Im in a little bit of shock. Its been a rough six months for me. I havent played too well. 

Nadal, the two-time French Open champion and this years Wimbledon runner-up, succumbed at the end, hanging his head at changeovers in the fourth set after wasting a 5-4 lead in the tie-breaker. On the other side of the mens draw, the top-seeded Federer moved into a quarter final (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition) against fifth-seeded American James Blake, both winning in straight sets. That halfs other quarter final will be No. 7 Nikolay Davydenko against No. 14 Tommy Haas. 

Federer lost to Nadal in the French Open final, then returned the favour at Wimbledon. Now the ninth-seeded Roddick will deal with Youzhny, who added a second upset Wednesday, teaming with Leos Friedl of the Czech Republic in mens doubles to knock off the defending champions and top-seeded pair of American twins Bob and Mike Bryan 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2), 6-4 in the third round. 

There still could be a No. 1 versus No. 2 final for the women, because top-seeded Amelie Mauresmo and Justine Henin-Hardenne advanced with relative ease. 

Coming off a three-set struggle against Serena Williams, Mauresmo beat No. 12 Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-3 to move a step closer to her third Grand Slam title of the year. Mauresmo next faces No. 3 Maria Sharapova, who beat No. 27 Tatiana Golovin 7-6 (4), 7-6 (0). Henin-Hardenne defeated Lindsay Davenport 6-4, 6-4 in a showdown between former champions to set up a semi-final against No. 19 Jelena Jankovic, who won Tuesday. 

Henin-Hardenne needed a massage after the first set for a twinge in her back and sore rib, then dropped the first five points of the second set and wound up trailing 1-3. But the Belgian broke right back, and again to go ahead 5-4. 

Mauresmo might argue that point. Henin-Hardenne did win the French Open this year, but she was the runner-up to Mauresmo at the Australian Open and Wimbledon. 

Like Mauresmo, Federer is aiming for major title No. 3 of 2006, but hes aiming for No. 9 of his career. The two-time defending champion won the first 12 points en route to a 6-3, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 victory over Marc Gicquel. Blake, meanwhile, saved all 15 break points he faced and eliminated No. 12 Tomas Bedrdych 6-4, 6-3, 6-1. 

Youzhny displayed the sort of aggressive and on-the-mark shotmaking he used to knock off No. 6 Tommy Robredo, No. 11 David Ferrer and No. 19 Dominik Hrbaty earlier in the tournament. 

His high-risk style worked to perfection against Nadal. 

The tournament lost another personality with 2000 US Open champion Marat Safins 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, 2-6, 6-7 (5-7) exit against pal and practice partner Haas.

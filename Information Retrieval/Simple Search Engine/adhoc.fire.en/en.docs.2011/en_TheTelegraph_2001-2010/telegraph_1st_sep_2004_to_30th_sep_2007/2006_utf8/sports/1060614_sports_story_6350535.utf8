 Match referee reprimands Pedro Collins

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: West Indies pacer Pedro Collins has been reprimanded for breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the ongoing second Test match against India. 

According to an ICC release, Collins pleaded guilty to excessive appealing to ICC Match Referee Jeff Crowe in a hearing after play concluded in Gros Islet on Sunday. 

Collins was found to have breached 1.5 of the ICC Code which relates to the practice of celebrating a dismissal before the decision has been given. 

The incident related to Collins reaction as he dismissed Indias V.V.S. Laxman on Saturday, the first day of the second Test match. 

This is the second example of a player being found guilty of the same offence in this series. Indias Virender Sehwag was fined 20 per cent of his match fee following an incident in the first Test in Antigua. 

In this instance the batsman appeared to start to walk after getting a healthy edge to the ball before the umpire had a chance to make a decision. 

But despite that, Pedro still has to realise he needs to adhere to correct procedure and this reprimand is designed to reinforce that point. Pedro pleaded guilty to the charge and was apologetic for his actions, Crowe said.

 Bengal ready for tough foes Kerala

- Prasanta to start with same XI 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Saumik Dey is fit but may not start 

Gurgaon: The day before Bengal take on Kerala in the Santosh Trophy semi-final at the Devi Lal Sports Complex, coach Prasanta Banerjee seemed more relaxed than he was during the quarter-final league phase. 

A convincing win over Punjab in the crucial league match has considerably boosted confidence in the Bengal camp. Also, two key members of the team defender Saumik Dey and midfielder Snehashish Chakraborty have recovered from injuries they suffered during the 0-2 defeat against Goa. 

Neither Dey nor Chakrabarty, though, will be in the starting XI. I will stick to the team that played against Punjab. The boys who delivered the goods in the vital encounter shouldnt be sacrificed for the sake of established names, he said. 

The former medio was not far from the truth. Against Punjab, players like Asim Das, Tapan Maity and Avinash Thapa played admirably in defence and midfield to keep their physically superior rivals at bay for most of the match. All three were on the reserves bench at the start of the tournament. But when they got a chance, they showed their mettle. 

But then, Kerala will be much stronger than Punjab and Banerjee knows it more than anyone else. 

Keralas biggest plus point is their compact nature of play, said Banerjee. They have been practising together for the past one month. That was hardly the case with our team. 

Kerala also have the edge in the skills department. While seasoned campaigners like Abdul Naushad, Abdul Hakeem and Asif Saheer are there to lead Kerala from the front, the presence of N.P. Pradeep can tilt the balance in their favour. Pradeep has marshalled the midfield efficiently and has been the best player of the tournament thus far. 

Banerjee feels sheer team spirit will play a vital role in Bengal overcoming these problems. We have made the semi-finals after six years. Now we are just two steps away from the title. The boys know it and I am sure they will rise to the occasion.

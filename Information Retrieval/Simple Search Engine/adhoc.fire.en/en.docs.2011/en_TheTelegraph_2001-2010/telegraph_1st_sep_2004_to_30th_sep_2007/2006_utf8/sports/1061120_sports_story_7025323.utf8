 Jeev, Randhawa finish tied third 

 - Lara bags maiden European Tour title

Hong Kong: Stunning back-nine efforts boosted Indian duo Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa to a creditable tied third finish at the UBS Hong Kong Open here on Sunday. 

The impressive finish also helped Jeev seal the coveted top place in the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

The winner was Spaniard Jose Manuel Lara (69) who pipped Filipino rookie Juvic Pagunsan (68) by one shot to win his maiden European Tour title. 

Lara clinched the title at 15-under-par 265 as he took advantage of a two-shot swing on 16th, where the Filipino youngster bogeyed and Lara birdied. Pagunsan, who led by a shot till 16th tee, ended at 14-under as Lara went on to win his first title since turning professional in 1997. 

Jeev and Randhawa produced four-under 66 each and ended at 12-under. 

Pagunsan assured himself of the rookie of the year title as he moved to seventh place on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

Randhawa ($291,818), who played very few events on Asian Tour in the first half of the season, has now climbed to sixth with his late surge. 

I have been playing well and been in the race, but not quite finished things. Still it has been a good season and I look forward to the Volvo Masters in December, said Randhawa. 

Gaurav Ghei (70) was tied 42nd at one-under 279 alongside K.J. Choi (69) while Rahil Gangjee (72) slipped to tied 62nd at three-over 283. Daniel Chopra had an even par 70 and finished 25th. 

Pagunsan is now assured of the rookie of the year title as two other contenders Yasin Ali ($109,296 in 31st place) and S.S.P. Chowrasia ($90,944 in 41st place) cannot catch him up with just one more event, the Volvo Masters, remaining. 

Randhawa could not hole his birdie putts through the front nine, but he made sure that he did not drop any shot either. He had nine straight pars and turned in even which seemed to have put him out of the race, just as in Jeevs case. Jeev had one birdie on third and bogey on ninth to be even par for nine holes. 

On the back-nine, Jeev birdied the tenth and then eagled the par-5 13th to make a charge. But he managed only one more birdie on the 18th, by which time it was too late as Lara and Pagunsan had moved into a battle for the title. 

Randhawa birdied 10th, 13th, 16th and 18th and ended with a 66. It was the sixth successive top-10 finish for Randhawa starting from the eighth place in Brunei Open to third in Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters and eighth in Barclays Singapore Open. 

He then won the Hero Honda Indian Open and was then tied ninth at the Shanghai meet last week. In between, he had also won an event on Indian PGTI Tour (Bilt Open).

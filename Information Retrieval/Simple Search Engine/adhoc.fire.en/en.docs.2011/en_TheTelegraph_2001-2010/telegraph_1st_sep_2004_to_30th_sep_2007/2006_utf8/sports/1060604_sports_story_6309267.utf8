The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its going to be nice getting away...

 - Countdown begins for Souravs return to special place 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Singapore: In less than a fortnight, Sourav Ganguly will be off to England, a country thats always going to have a special place in his heart. For the second year in succession, Indias most successful Test captain will be featuring in County cricket ? albeit, this time, as a replacement for one of Northamptonshires signings. 

Its going to be nice getting away from home and India... Playing for Northants will, hopefully, be a good change as Im going to be doing what I like best... Then, Ill be based pretty close to London, a favourite city of mine, Sourav told The Telegraph when contacted on his cellphone Saturday. 

In 2005, the County finished fourth in Division II. While former South African captain Kepler Wessels (who telephoned Sourav the other day) is the coach, Lance Klusener is on its rolls. As also the Monty Panesars and Usman Afzals. 

Incidentally, Bishan Singh Bedi spent quite a few summers in Northampton. 

Sourav added: I dont have to prove anything (by playing first-class cricket), but Im going to be ready if the selectors recall me... England will always have a special place in my heart... I scored a hundred (131) on my Test debut at Lords, I did very well (379 runs, average of 54-plus) in the1999 World Cup and also did very well (351 runs, average of 58-plus in Tests) on our 2002 tour... 

In fact, its not that Ive delivered in only the India colours... I had a reasonable stint with Lancashire in 2000 and performed for Glamorgan last summer... Its nice that Northants chose me and not anybody else when a vacancy (Chris Rogers call-up for Australia A) cropped up... 

Not that one ought to read too much into what chief selector Kiran More said some days ago ? basically that County performances would be considered ? but handsome scores should carry weight if the Team India batsmen continue to struggle in the West Indies. 

Sourav, by the way, declined to talk about our 1-4 drubbing in the ODIs and the poor start to the Test series there. Hes apprehensive that a comment could be taken out of context, by somebody, and given a slant. Thats exactly why Greg Chappell doesnt speak about Sourav. 

Saluted as a world class player by Northants chief executive Mark Tagg, which must have irked a few currently in the West Indies, Sourav is to have a challenging mix of matches between the end of this month and August 8, when his contract ends. 

Championship games, limited overs matches, a Twenty20 competition... Its a pleasing schedule and there wont be the monotony of just one form of cricket... Frankly, Im quite excited, he remarked. 

Despite over 10,000 runs in ODIs, Sourav hasnt found a place in the shorter version for nine months. His last Test appearance was in Karachi. Surely, then, the past many months would have been tough on the mind? 

Sourav ducked: Today, Im looking forward to leaving on the 15th... Ive got this chance to stay involved with cricket... I dont wish to talk about what has gone... Perhaps, thats par for the course hes on in the present times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dhoni ready for SA tour

 Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni in the city on Monday

Calcutta: Mahendra Singh Dhoni has blamed lack of enough matches leading up to the Champions Trophy for the debacle. 

We played in Sri Lanka after a gap of nearly two months and the matches were washed out. Then there was the Kuala Lumpur tri-series, but we didnt play enough matches before the Champions Trophy. We didnt have the rhythm, the Team India wicketkeeper-batsman said during a promotional in the city. 

Dhoni, however, is looking ahead with optimism. The South Africa tour is going to be tough. The conditions will be different, the wickets a lot bouncier It will be a new challenge, and hopefully, we will do well. 

The inclusion of Dinesh Karthik will also egg him on. Karthiks inclusion is good for me It enhances competition and helps to perform better, Dhoni said. 

Irfan Pathan, who was also present, said: My rhythm was good in the Champions Trophy. The confidence has also increased. Weve played well before and well get back to winning ways soon.

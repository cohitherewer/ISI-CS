 Germany maul Luxembourg 7-0

London: Germany shrugged off the absence of Michael Ballack to crush Luxembourg 7-0 on Saturday as their World Cup preparations moved up a gear. 

On a busy day of international friendlies featuring 11 of the 32 nations competing in next months finals, the hosts got in some much-needed shooting practice against a side ranked 152nd in Fifa rankings. 

Miroslav Klose, Lukas Podolski and Oliver Neuville all grabbed a couple of goals to raise the feel-good factor in Juergen Klinsmanns squad. 

Germany captain Ballack missed the friendly in Freiburg, still nursing a strained ankle, which he sustained in Thursdays workout against Servette Genevas under-18s. 

It did us some good, said Klinsmann. It was a small but important test and we got going straight away. 

Ivory Coast came from behind to draw 1-1 with Switzerland in their warm-up in Basel. Emerse Fae equalised in the 47th minute after the Swiss, who are in Group G in Germany along with France, had gone ahead through Tranquillo Barnetta.

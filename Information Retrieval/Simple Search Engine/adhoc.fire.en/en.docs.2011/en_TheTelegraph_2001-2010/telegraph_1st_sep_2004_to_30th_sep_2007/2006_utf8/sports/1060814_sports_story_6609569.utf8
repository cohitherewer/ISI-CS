 Kumbles effort in vain

London: Anil Kumbles decent showing with the ball went in vain as his County Surrey lost their Twenty20 semi-final clash to Nottinghamshire by 37 runs. However, later in the day, Leicestershire lifted the title beating Nottinghamshire by four runs. 

Kumble took two wickets conceding only 26 runs in his four overs to help Surrey restrict Nottinghamshire to 176 for six.The Indian leggie first castled Stephen Fleming (31) and then rushed through the defences of top-scoring Australian David Hussey (42). 

Chasing 177 for a berth in the final, Surrey were dismissed for 139 in 19.2 overs as most of their top batsmen failed to shine. When his turn came to bat, Kumble contributed eight runs off seven balls before being snared by Mark Elham.

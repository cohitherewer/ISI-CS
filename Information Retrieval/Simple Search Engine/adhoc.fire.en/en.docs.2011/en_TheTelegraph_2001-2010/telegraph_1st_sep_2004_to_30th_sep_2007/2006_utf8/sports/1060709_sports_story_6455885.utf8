 Jeev tied 4th after Round II

 Jeev Milkha 

Kildare (Ireland): Jeev Milkha Singh kept alive his dream of getting into the British Open Golf Championship with a card of four-under 68 that gave him a tied fourth place at the Smurfit European Open here on Friday. 

Jyoti Randhawa also struggled in windy conditions, carding a 78 to make the halfway cut. 

It was 10 shots worse than his strong start on Thursday. 

Randhawa had a quadruple bogey and two other double bogeys, but he still made the cut and has a chance to improve his position over the next two days. 

One British Open berth is available from the event and Jeev, with an overall six-under 138, needs to be the highest placed non-exempt finisher to earn that berth. 

A win will give him that berth beyond doubt, and become his second on the European Tour and the first outside Asia. 

Jeev is three strokes behind Welshman Bradley Dredge, who leads by one from compatriot Stephen Dodd. 

Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland is a further stroke back in third. Dredge and Dodd are already in the British Open field by virtue of having been in the top-20 of the European Order of Merit in 2005. 

Clarke is also exempt into British Open by the same yardstick and also because he is in the top-50 of world rankings. 

So, if Jeev stays in same place with no other non-exempt player finishing ahead of him, he will go to the British Open in a fortnights time. 

Jeev has already played and made the cut at the US Open this year. 

So far Shiv Kapur is the only Indian in the field for the British Open to be held at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club. 

Jeev, the current leader on the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit, has one win and two runner-up finishes this season, besides five other top-10 finishes as he has criss-crossed Asia, Europe and US in last three months. 

He had seven birdies and three bogeys, two of which came on the 16th and 17th holes. Jeev opened with a string of four pars before finding his first birdie on the fifth. 

He immediately dropped a shot on sixth and quickly made up again with a birdie on seventh. 

On the back nine he birdied the 10th and 11th and when he added two more on 14th and 15th, he was briefly on top of the leaderboard. 

Then came two bogeys on 16th and 17th, before Jeev steeled himself for one last birdie on 18th. He was tied with Soren Kjeldsen and Anthony Wall. 

I am playing well and I just want to take it day by day, said Jeev, who will also play next weeks Barclays Scottish Open. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Definitely my final year: Navratilova

London: Martina Navratilova is ready to retire. Really. 

Navratilova, who turns 50 in October, has announced at Wimbledon that this will be her final year of professional tennis, although shes not exactly sure where shell play her last tournament. 

Its time. Its enough. I just want to move on to my next life? Most of all, its to spend more time at home. 

As of now, Navratilova plans to play doubles at hardcourt tournaments in Montreal and San Diego, but hasnt decided whether to compete at the US Open. 

She was speaking after reaching the doubles quarter finals at the All England Club with Liezel Huber by beating Elena Likhovtseva and Anastasia Myskina 7-5, 6-0. 

Navratilova is also into the mixed doubles quarters with Mark Knowles. 

I can get sentimental when its over, she said. Not yet. 

Navratilova originally retired in 1994, with a record 167 singles titles and having spent 331 weeks ranked No. 1. She returned to the Tour as a doubles player in 2000, and eventually couldnt resist dabbling in singles, including a first-round victory at Wimbledon in 2004. She also won two mixed doubles crowns with Indias Leander Paes. 

The decision that this is my last year, that is a definite, she said on Tuesday. 

Shes won 58 Grand Slam titles ? 18 in singles, 31 in doubles and nine in mixed. Of those, a record-tying 20 have come at Wimbledon, including nine in singles ? six in a row from 1982-87 ? seven in doubles and four in mixed. 

Ill miss the competition, the having to perform under pressure, she said disclosing her plans to visit Wimbledon each year. Ill be back. I just wont be playing.

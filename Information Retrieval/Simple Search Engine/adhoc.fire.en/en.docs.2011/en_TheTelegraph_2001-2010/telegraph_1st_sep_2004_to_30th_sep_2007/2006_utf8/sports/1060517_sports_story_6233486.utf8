OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ajit Agarkar during a fielding session on Monday 

Montego Bay: Hailing from the Class of 1998, Ajit Agarkar is the most experienced among the five new ball bowlers currently with Team India in the West Indies. The others are Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel. 

Incidentally, the Mumbaikar is the only one to have toured the West Indies previously ? in 2002. 

Its nice being a senior pro... Experience is the best teacher and Im happy that Ive survived all these years, Agarkar told The Telegraph. He added: Ive spoken a bit to those on their first trip... If somebody is looking for anything in particular, Im around... 

Agarkar is hoping to make the most of opportunities, something which may bring him into contention for the Test series which follows the five ODIs.

 Competition not a worry: Harbhajan 

Jalandhar: Undaunted by the growing competition for the spinners slot in the Indian Test squad, Harbhajan Singh says he just focuses on giving his best every time instead of worrying about losing his place to a rival. 

Harbhajan said increased competition only brings out the best in him. I dont feel any threat due to (Ramesh) Powar. Every player has to perform on the ground to book his place in the Indian team, he said. 

Harbhajan would rather not predict if he would still be playing when Asia hosts the World Cup in 2011. Spinners usually enjoy longevity as compared to fast bowlers. In my case I am yet to read my future. My wish is that I should finish my career after reaching similar heights as Anil Kumble. 

Welcoming Sachin Tendulkars comeback, he said: He will not only strengthen our opening but also be helpful as a bowler, he added. About the possibility of Sourav Gangulys comeback, Harbhajan said: I am neither the selector nor the captain of the team. It is up to them to decide about his comeback. 

He also revealed that he would tie the nuptial knot after the World Cup. 

He, however, envisages a challenging role for spinners in Twenty20 format. It is a very exciting format (but) more for viewers and batsmen. It will be great fun for batsmen like Dhoni and Sehwag. But it will be just katle aam (massacre) for bowlers, he said. (PTI)

 Akrams dig at Woolmer 

Faisalabad: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram took a dig at coach Bob Woolmer, saying he was not being positive by allowing dull wickets and making it a very painful and boring affair to watch the first two Tests against India. 

I apologise for deciding to become a commentator as it is very painful to watch such boring cricket coming from Pakistan. They are such a talented side but why arent they being positive. Please tell Bob Woolmer to be positive, Akram said after the second Test in Faisalabad also ended in a tame draw. 

Akram said the Pakistan Cricket Board should stop making excuses as everyone knows that the coach and the captain have always had a say in preparation of the wicket. 

I have captained the side for eight years and I know what it is. I am not a groundsman is not an acceptable excuse, he said in a press release. 

Former India captain Ravi Shastri also joined the criticism, saying Pakistan had gone on defensive in the first two matches of the three-Test series. They (Pakistan) are scared of losing, he said and expressed reservations that even in Karachi Pakistan would not prepare a sporting wicket.

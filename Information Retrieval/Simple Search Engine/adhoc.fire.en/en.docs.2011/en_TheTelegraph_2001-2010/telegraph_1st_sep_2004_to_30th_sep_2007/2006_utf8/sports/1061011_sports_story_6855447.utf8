The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC awards now on Nov.3

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The International Cricket Council (ICC) awards 2006, which was slated to be held in Mumbai on October 23, has been rescheduled and will now be held on November 3. 

The change of date means the event is no longer in close proximity to either the Diwali or Eid. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had earlier requested the ICC to change the date of the awards ceremony to ensure the availability of all its team members following the 10-day festival break.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal look to turn the tables on Services

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Santosh Trophy

 Sasthi Duley 

 Faridabad: For the past 

 few years, Services have become Bengals bogey team 

 in Santosh Trophy. Two years ago in Delhi, the 29-time champions 

 crashed out of the national championships losing to the 

 team once they defeated by half-a-dozen goals in the final 

 37 years ago.

 On Wednesday, Bengal, mainly comprising 

 a bunch of youngsters, will again cross swords with Services 

 here for a place in the quarter final league to be played 

 next month. But this time, Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee 

 is pretty confident that his side will be able to turn the 

 tables on the team from the armed forces.

 My boys, I am sure, will 

 win, was the first thing that Banerjee said. I 

 have been watching Services for the past few days. I didnt 

 find anything extraordinary in them and we will win if the 

 boys play to their potential.

 But to do that, Bengal will have 

 to improve a lot. The defence will have to pull up their 

 socks in order to thwart fast moving Services players. Banerjee 

 is trying his best to plug the loopholes. Ashim Das is likely 

 to replace a slow-moving Narugopal Hait in deep defence 

 and Crispen Chhetri may play for a slightly injured Gouranga 

 Dutta in the midfield.

 I might put Sasthi Duley 

 on the right and bring Chhetri in the middle, said 

 Banerjee. Shasti didnt do too well in the last 

 match, but still he would be able to open through the wings. 

 Banerjee has borrowed a thing 

 or two from his former guru PK Banerjee and trying to boost 

 the morale of the team with some vocal tonic. I have 

 told the boys this is your chance to prove your mettle. 

 A win will turn you into heroes, while a defeat will send 

 you into oblivion for ever.

 One hopes Banerjees boys 

 were listening carefully.

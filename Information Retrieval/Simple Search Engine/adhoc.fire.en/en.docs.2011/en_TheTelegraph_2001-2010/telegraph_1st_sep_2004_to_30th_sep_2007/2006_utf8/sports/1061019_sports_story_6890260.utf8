 Shetty: Speed comments bizarre

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Invitation to Azhar 

Mumbai: There seems to be no end to the stand-off between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the Mohammed Azharuddin issue. 

In a chain of actions and reactions between the two parties ever since an invitation was forwarded to the former India captain to attend a function here on November 4, the BCCIs Chief Administrative Officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty added his own to the list on Wednesday. 

The invitation to Azhar is an internal matter of the BCCI and the ICC has no role in it, Shetty said. Besides, one should not forget that though we have banned him, he remains one of our most successful captains. The ICC cant raise objection to one particular cricketer and let the others play freely, he added. 

Prof. Shetty was reacting to the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speeds comment that Azhars role in match-fixing has been proved and his case cant be compared to those of Herschelle Gibbs and Shane Warne since their respective boards have already disciplined them. 

Azhars case is still sub-judice. So, such comments coming from the ICC chief executive are not only disappointing, but bizarre as well, he maintained. 

Prof. Shetty pointed out that the ICC has no right to determine how India should treat their captains.

 Sofia: A Bulgarian referee triggered a storm by ordering two players to take off their wedding rings before a Premier League match.

 Vihren have called on the Bulgarian Football Union (BFU) to impose a life ban on referee Momchil Vraikov for his performance in their league match at Rodopa Smolyan at the weekend.

 ?Vraikov ordered two of my teammates to take their wedding rings off just before the kick-off and they went to the dugout,? player-coach Georgi Bachev said. ?But then he suddenly blew the opening whistle. I told him that we should wait for the players to come back and he booked me.? 

 Brasilia: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has given his backing to a bid by his country to host the 2014 World Cup, Brazilian football federation (cbf) chief Ricardo Teixeira announced on Monday.

 After a meeting with the President, Teixeira said that Lula had agreed ?that after 64 years Brazil met all the criteria to organise the World Cup and promised his backing because Brazilian football and the country deserve it?.

 Brazil are the most successful World Cup nation with five titles in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002. But they have only once organised the tournament in 1950 when they lost the final 1-2 to Uruguay.

 Zagreb: Croatia?s leading player and captain Ivan Ljubicic may miss the first day of the Davis Cup tie against Argentina due to fatigue and abdominal pain, Croatian newspapers reported on Tuesday.

 ?At the moment, I cannot say with hundred percent certainty that I will play on Friday,? Ljubicic, who lost to world No. 1 Roger Federer in the Nasdaq-100 Open final in Miami on Sunday, said on Tuesday.

 ?What is certain is that I shall not be at my best and there is a chance that Mario (Ancic) gets to be our first player. But I will make a final decision on Thursday,? he said. 

 Mumbai: Wimbeldon champion and Indian Davis Cup captain Leander Paes has become father as his partner Rhea Pillai delivered a baby girl at a city hospital here, sources said on Tuesday.

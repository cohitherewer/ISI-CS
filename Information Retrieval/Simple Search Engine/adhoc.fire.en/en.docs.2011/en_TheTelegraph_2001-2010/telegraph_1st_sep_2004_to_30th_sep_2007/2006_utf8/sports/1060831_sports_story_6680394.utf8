The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SL priority is $12m from insurance

 - Dialogue with South Africa will resume once claim is settled 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Pakistan versus Darrell Hair row made everyone forget the cancellation of two tournaments in-a-row in Sri Lanka, but Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) has been moving to recover losses. 

According to a well-placed source of The Telegraph in Colombo, it has already completed paperwork for a $12 million claim on Ceylinco Insurance Company Ltd. 

Each of the tri-series seven matches was insured Fortunately, there was a clause allowing for relief if the tournament got scrapped following an act of violence. 

As the tri-series got cancelled owing to South Africas pull out after the August 14 blast in the capital, SLC has made a full claim Its hopeful of getting the entire amount, he said. 

The claim an absolute priority for SLC at this point in time is expected to be settled within a fortnight. A delay, though, cant be ruled out. 

The source added: Owing to time constraints, the three-match bilateral series between India and Sri Lanka (which got scrapped because of the weather) wasnt insured, but SLC wont have a problem once it gets the $12 million 

The bilateral tournament, in any case, was quickly stitched together once South Africa decided to take the fastest connection home. 

One understands SLC did start a dialogue with Cricket South Africa (CSA) soon after the Mark Boucher-led team returned home, but it wasnt carried forward. 

That, one learns, is going to be done once the claim is settled. There are good reasons for such a move, the well-placed source explained. 

Whats doing the rounds is that SLC will ask the Proteas to come back either soon after the World Cup next year or in the summer of 2008, failing which CSA should fork out compensation. 

Till late on Wednesday, nobody from SLC was available for comment.

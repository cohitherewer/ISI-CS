The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India start with 1-4 loss to Germany 

 Four Nation Hockey

 Monchengladbach: India 

 started their campaign in the four-nation invitational hockey 

 tournament in Germany on a disastrous note, going down 1-4 

 to the hosts at Warsteiner Hockey Park here on Saturday.

 The match was tied 1-1 at half-time 

 but India, playing under new coach V. Baskaran, spoiled 

 the good work by letting Germany pump in three goals after 

 the breather.

 Christopher Zeller, who scored 

 three goals (23rd, 37th and 69th minutes), was the main 

 architect of the host teams win while Sebastian Draguhn 

 (44th) chipped in with one.

 Young striker Tushar Khandekar 

 (29th) was the lone scorer for India.

 Spain defeated Argentina 1-0 in 

 another match on Saturday.

 In the absence of some of their 

 main players, Germanys error-prone attack faltered 

 while penetrating into the Indian defence in the first-half.

 After Zeller failed to convert 

 the first penalty corner, Matthias Witthaus lost a big opportunity 

 to score in the 21st minute, thanks to the exploits of Indian 

 goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri.

 Germans drew first blood when 

 a Nicolas Emmerling pass from the backline found a perfectly-positioned 

 Zeller in front of the goal and the latter shot home without 

 wasting any time. A few minutes later, Indians fought back 

 to score the equaliser through Khandekar.

 The Germans played with purpose 

 after the change of ends while India lost track. 

 A couple of minutes after the 

 break, Zeller converted a penalty corner to give his side 

 a 2-1 lead and within 10 minutes Sebastian Draguhn netted 

 the third goal for the hosts.

 The Germans messed up a few more 

 chances, including two penalty corners.

 India tried to get their act together 

 but could not succeed. Rajpal Singh came closer to reduce 

 the margin but his hit was far off the target.

 In the dying moments, Zeller put 

 it past Chhetri once again to hammer the final nail on Indias 

 coffin.

 Indian team manager G.M. Srivastava 

 said the team played well in the first-half, but could not 

 keep up the momentum in the second. (PTI)

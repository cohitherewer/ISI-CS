 India take on Oman

 - Tie vs Oman 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: For the Indian hockey team, winning a gold in the Asian Games here has now become a distant dream. After the shock loss to China, the team management is now hoping against hope to beat South Korea in the last league match and qualify for the semi-finals. 

The coaches are planning to score as many goals as possible against Oman on Friday and be on the safer side before clashing with South Korea. It is good that we are playing the last match of the day, said assistant coach Harendra Singh. Before playing Oman, we will know the goal average of all teams and will accordingly. We want a position where we can qualify by beating South Korea by a minimum margin. 

China had beaten India in all departments of the game, but Harendra was not ready to accept it. We had a total of 13 hits to the goal and were successful only twice. Our opponents could raid our goal only thrice. Luckily, they were rewarded with a goal on each occasion, argued Harendra. Our only mistake was to go for direct attempts on all the penalty corners we received.

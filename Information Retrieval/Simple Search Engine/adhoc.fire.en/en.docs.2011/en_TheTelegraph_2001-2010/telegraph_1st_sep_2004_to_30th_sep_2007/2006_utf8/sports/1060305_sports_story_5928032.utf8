 McNamee quits 

Melbourne: Paul McNamee has quit as chief executive of the Australian Open, Tennis Australia (TA) said on Saturday. 

McNamee, 51, a former Wimbledon and Australian Open doubles champion, leaves after 12 years at the helm of the Grand Slam tennis tournament. 

McNamee said in a TA statement that he was leaving to pursue other interests. 

There is never an easy time to move on but I feel I am doing so on a high after another great Australian Open, he said. His departure follows a deteriorating relationship with Australias highest-ranked player Lleyton Hewitt and sections of the Australian media over the last two Australian Opens. 

World No. 10 Hewitt was strongly critical of Australian Open management over what he perceived to be the slow pace of the Melbourne Park hard courts during the last open in January. 

He subsequently withdrew from Australias first round Davis Cup tie against Switzerland in Geneva last month with an ankle injury, although he played in the following weeks ATP Tour tournament in San Jose. TA president Geoff Pollard paid tribute to McNamees stewardship of the Open.

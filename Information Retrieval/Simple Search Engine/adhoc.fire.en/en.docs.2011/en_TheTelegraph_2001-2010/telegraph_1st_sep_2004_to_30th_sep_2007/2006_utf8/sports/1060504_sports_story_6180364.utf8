 Thomas Cup

 Tokyo: India bowed out 

 of the Thomas Cup on Wednesday after losing 0-3 to European 

 powerhouse Denmark at the quarter final stage.

 India were always expected to 

 struggle against the might of world No. 3 Peter Gade and 

 No. 7 Kenneth Jonassen, alongwith the top doubles combination 

 in the world ? Jons Erikson and Martin Hansen ? and the 

 Scandinavians proved their superiority by wrapping up the 

 tie without conceding a game.

 Indias top shuttler Chetan 

 Anand, who missed the tie against Germany due to injury, 

 was back on court but could not pose any challenge to Gade 

 in the opening rubber, going down 21-14, 21-8 in 28 minutes.

 National champion Anup Sridhar 

 went down to Jonassen 21-12, 21-11 in just 34 minutes in 

 the second match.

 The doubles combination of Rupesh 

 Kumar and V. Diju gave a good account of themselves against 

 Erikson and Hansen before losing 21-14, 21-19 in 34 minutes 

 to hand over the victory to Denmark.

 Nevertheless, Indians would return 

 home satisfied as they achieved what they had set out to 

 do. Coach Vimal Kumar had set his eyes on a quarter final 

 berth and it was mainly due to his meticulous planning that 

 his team reached the last eight at the prestigious mens 

 team championship. 

 World number ones Lin Dan and 

 Zhang Ning spearheaded Chinas quarter-final victories 

 at the Thomas and Uber Cup Badminton Championships.

 Lin needed some time before getting 

 used to the lights and the draught caused by the air conditioner, 

 but went on to beat Andrew Smith 18-21, 21-12, 21-12 in 

 the opening match of Chinas 3-0 win over England in 

 the mens event.

 Cai Yun and Fu Haifeng put China 

 two up by beating Kristian Roebuck and Ian Palethorpe 21-14, 

 21-12. Bao Chunlais 21-12, 21-15 win over Nicholas 

 Kidd secured the best-of-five Thomas Cup quarter final tie.

 Athens Olympic gold medallist 

 Zhang beat Li Li 21-18, 21-18 before Jiang Yanjiao and the 

 pairing of Gao Ling and Huang Sui secured Chinas 3-0 

 victory over Singapore in their Uber Cup quarter final clash.

 In the 21-point system, 

 there are some unexpected points you lose. I made some errors 

 when I was leading in the first game, and it was my first 

 match at this gymnasium, said Lin.

 But I was able to play in 

 my own rhythm in the second and third games after I got 

 used to the lights and wind.

 Zhang, who needed 114 minutes 

 to beat Li, struggled to find her rhythm. Although 

 I won, Im not satisfied with my play at all, I should 

 have won it by a bigger points differential. I was not speedy 

 today, said Zhang.

 The lights and wind here 

 are not good for badminton, but its the same for both 

 players. Its a question of which player can get used 

 to the conditions quicker, she added.

 In the semi-finals on Friday, 

 Chinese men will take on 13-time champions Indonesia, the 

 winners over hosts Japan 3-1. 

 Japans three-time national 

 champion Shoji Sato caused the biggest upset by downing 

 world and Athens Olympics champion Taufik Hidayat 20-22, 

 21-16, 24-23 in the opener, thrilling a sellout partisan 

 crowd of 10,000.

 It was a surprise for me. 

 I felt I was still playing at the moment I won. I understood 

 I did it when I saw the spectators reaction, 

 said Sato.

 The Chinese women, looking forward 

 to their fifth straight and 10th overall Uber Cup, will 

 play Germany, the winners over Hong Kong 3-2.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Eriksson has reason to be cheerful

 - England will go into the tournament better equipped to go all the way 

London: If Sven-Goran Erikssons spirits ever need a lift between now and the 2006 World Cup, the England manager need only look at the team sheet from their exit in 2002. 

Conjuring up memories of their 1-2 quarter final defeat by Brazil on a searing afternoon in Japan may seem an unlikely source of comfort as Eriksson prepares his squad for Germany. 

Englands first competitive defeat under the Swede shattered the hopes of millions back home and raised doubts about his man-management skills that have lingered in the British media ever since. 

Yet a reminder of the side he picked in Shizuoka, compared to the starting XI he has in mind for Englands opener against Paraguay in Frankfurt on June 10, shows just how much his team will have improved. 

Danny Mills, Trevor Sinclair, Nicky Butt and Emile Heskey are all still worthy Premier League players. 

None of them, though, can expect to be remotely near the squad for 2006, and there is even less likelihood of strikers Darius Vassell and Teddy Sheringham being sent on in search of a last-gasp equaliser as they were against Brazil. 

A combination of bad luck and limited options led Eriksson to select a team which failed to trouble Brazil in the second half ? despite the future world champions playing 33 minutes of it with ten men after Ronaldinhos red card. 

Mills, who forms a Shizuoka trio at Manchester City with Sinclair and Vassell, only made it to Japan after England were struck again by the curse of the metatarsal. 

Gary Neville, Erikssons first-choice at right back, suffered the same bone fracture in his foot that had already sidelined England captain David Beckham a few weeks earlier. 

While Beckham recovered sufficiently to play the finals, though not at full strength, Neville was ruled out and replaced by Mills. 

Sinclair was even more fortunate to be in Japan, let alone on the pitch. 

Danny Murphy was going through one of Englands final pre-tournament training sessions on the South Korean honeymoon island of Cheju when he fell awkwardly and felt a sharp pain. He had joined the broken metatarsal club. 

Far from being down at the moment of Murphys impact, Sinclair was 30,000 feet in the air, flying home despondent at no longer being needed as a standby but looking forward to seeing his pregnant wife. 

Given the news of Murphys injury on arrival, Sinclair spent a couple of days at home before re-starting the now familiar 12,000-mile round trip and going on to earn the nickname Air Miles from his teammates. 

Butt played admirably for England at the 2002 World Cup as a holding midfielder. Yet he too was a stand-in, when it was revealed that first-choice Steven Gerrard would need groin surgery at the end of his Liverpool season. 

Butts career has ebbed since 2002. His decision to leave Manchester United for Newcastle left him at a struggling club who then loaned him out to relegation battlers Birmingham City. 

A familiar face in the doldrums of St Andrews is Heskey, whose England career plodded on to reach 43 caps and the meagre return of just five goals before grinding to a halt. 

Heskeys final England game was marked by a free-kick he conceded that allowed Frances Zinedine Zidane to fire an equaliser, shortly before the midfielder converted a penalty that sent England to a 1-2 defeat in their opener at Euro 2004. 

Two others of the England side in Shizuoka, keeper David Seaman and playmaker Paul Scholes, have since retired. 

Seaman, who burst into tears at the end after being caught out by Ronaldinhos speculative matchwinner, quit the game. Scholes dedicated himself solely to the Manchester United cause after Euro 2004. 

Eriksson hopes that two other players who were carrying injuries against Brazil, Beckham and striker Michael Owen, who still managed to score, will be in better shape this time. 

The remaining three survivors from Shizuoka are in defence ?Arsenal pair Ashley Cole and Sol Campbell, though both have been hit hard by injuries this season, and Rio Ferdinand. 

Should all of them pull through, Eriksson has several reasons to be cheerful when he looks at Englands latest World Cup line-up. (Reuters)

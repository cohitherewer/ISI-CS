The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Camp starts today, without Bhutia

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The national football camp under newly-appointed British coach Bob Houghton will begin in Margao on Wednesday without star striker Bhaichung Bhutia. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, though most of the footballers called for the camp have already reported in Goa, Bhutia ? who earlier declared his intention of quitting international football ? is yet to reach Goa. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said since Bhutia had earlier spoken to president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on this issue, he would like the president to come back from Germany before taking a decision. 

Asked whether it calls for disciplinary action against the star footballer, Colaco said: I am not in a position to make any comment without talking to Mr Das Munshi. 

Meanwhile, Houghton, who helped China to realise their World Cup dreams, will start the camp at 4pm on Wednesday. 

Other than senior players, the federation has also called up the Indian under-20 team from Bangalore to Margao. 

Two other senior footballers, Tomba Singh and Kalyan Chowbey, have also not reported for the camp.

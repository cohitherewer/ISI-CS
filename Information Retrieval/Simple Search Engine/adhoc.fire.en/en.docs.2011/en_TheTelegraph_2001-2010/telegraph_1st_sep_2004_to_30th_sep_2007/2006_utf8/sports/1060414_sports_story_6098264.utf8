 Ponting steers Australia home

 - First Test

 - Habibul Bashar claims moral victory 

 Gilchrist with the MoM trophy on Thursday 

Fatullah: Australia captain Ricky Ponting scored a brave unbeaten century to lead his side to a three-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first Test on Thursday. 

Ponting finished unbeaten on 118, nursing the tailenders on the final day to steer the world champions to a victory target of 307 and deny Bangladesh only their second win in 43 Tests. 

Ponting received solid support from fast bowlers Brett Lee (29) and Jason Gillespie (seven not out) after wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, who scored a century in the first innings, and Shane Warne had fallen early to give Bangladesh a scent of victory. 

Ponting held his nerve, however, batting for more than six hours, facing 253 balls and hitting 13 fours in his 31st Test century to save his side from an embarrassing defeat. 

Mashrafe Mortaza dropped him on 97 at fine leg after Ponting top-edged a pull shot with 24 runs still needed. 

They (Bangladesh) probably played better than I expected them to, they probably played better than we all expected especially on the first couple of days. They should be pretty happy with the way things went for them. 

Bangladesh, who piled up 427 in their first innings before bowling Australia out for 269 to take charge of the match, lost their two previous Tests against Australia in 2003 by an innings. 

I am satisfied that we could push the world champions into fifth day and that was our moral victory, Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar said. 

Rafique bowled Man of the Match Adam Gilchrist, who scored 144 to rescue his team in the first innings, to extend his second innings tally to 4-98. He took a total of nine wickets in the match. 

In select club 

Ponting and Gilchrist joined a select club of batsmen to have scored centuries against all nine Test-playing teams. 

The Aussie skippers unbeaten 118 helped him consolidate his position on top of the ICC batsmens list. 

Gilchrists 144 in the first innings brought him back into the top-20. 

The others to have hit Test hundreds against nine teams are Steve Waugh, Rahul Dravid, Gary Kirsten, Sachin Tendulkar, Brian Lara and Maravan Atapattu.

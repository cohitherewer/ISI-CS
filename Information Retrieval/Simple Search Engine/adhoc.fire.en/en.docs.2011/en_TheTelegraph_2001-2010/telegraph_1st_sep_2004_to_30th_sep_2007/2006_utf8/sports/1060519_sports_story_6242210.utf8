Lisbon: Veteran Portuguese midfielder Luis Figo says he is heading into the World Cup drained after a demanding season at Inter Milan but believes he will fully recover before the tournament kicks-off on June 9. 

 The reality is that I ran a lot this year. At this moment I would have liked to be more fresh. But after a draining season it is normal that I am not physically the same as in January, he told reporters late Wednesday as the Portuguese squad gathered in Lisbon for a training camp. 

 The important thing right now is to do my best during this training camp to prepare for the World Cup, the 33-year-old added. 

 Figo spent a total of 2,472 minutes on the pitch over 34 matches during his first season with Inter. 

 He is Portugals most capped player with 118 appearances since 1991, and is the squads third-highest scorer with 31 goals. 

Figo announced he was taking an indefinite break from international football in August 2004. 

At the time he cited his heavy schedule with Spanish giants Real Madrid and disappointment with the results of Euro 2004 for the move.

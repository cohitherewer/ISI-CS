 No breach of security for teams, says ACA

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) on Friday replied to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with all details of the abandoned ODI which witnessed crowd trouble. 

The BCCI had sought an explanation from the ACA on circumstances leading to the breach of security on April 9, when the fifth ODI between India and England was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of a wet pitch. 

In its formal reply, the ACA admitted there had been crowd trouble but stated categorically that there was no breach of security for the teams and match officials. 

On security arrangements, ACA Secretary Bikash Baruah said the City Police had provided a foolproof blanket for the venue, team hotels, officials accommodation and the pavilion, and that there was no question of any breach of security. 

We have also enclosed police findings into the vandalism by some spectators. The police has found out that the trouble-mongers, two of whom were nabbed, were drugs-addicts and were intoxicated at that time, Baruah added. 

The report does, however, say that drainage was a problem at the Nehru Stadium due to which extra effort had to be made to dry up the outfield. 

The ACA has also reiterated that play could have been possible in the afternoon session and blamed the umpires for calling off the match in collusion with the England team. That the visitors were not at all keen on playing the match was clear from the fact that they arrived at the ground at 11.45 am, while the scheduled start was 9 am. 

The ACA has further appealed to the BCCI to allot it another match at the earliest to compensate for the losses incurred in preparing for the ODI versus England. 

The BCCI has already stood by the ACA, with secretary Niranjan Shah saying on Thursday that Guwahati was unlikely to be censured by the ICC.

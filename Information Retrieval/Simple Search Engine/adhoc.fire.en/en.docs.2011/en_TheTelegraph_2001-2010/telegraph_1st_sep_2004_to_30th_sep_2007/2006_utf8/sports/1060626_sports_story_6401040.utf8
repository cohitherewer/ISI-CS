The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Swiss hope to overcome the loss of Senderos

 - We need to find quality: Blokhin 

Cologne: A team that takes pride in its lack of big name players will come up against a side seeking to end their reputation as a one-man-band when Switzerland take on Ukraine in the World Cup second round on Monday. 

Appearing in their first major finals, the Ukrainians have been at pains to stress that they have more to offer than 2004 European Player of the Year Andriy Shevchenko. 

Recovering from a 4-0 drubbing by Spain in their first match, Oleg Blokhins men secured second place in Group H when they followed up their own 4-0 win over Saudi Arabia with a tightly-contested 1-0 victory over Tunisia on Friday. 

The playing down of Shevchenkos importance was probably not helped by the fact that Chelseas new striker won and successfully converted the penalty that saw his team through. 

Its a huge achievement for Ukrainian football that we have got into the next round, said Shevchenko. We always kept our belief despite the terrible defeat against Spain. 

Belief was also a popular word within the Swiss camp following their impressive 2-0 victory over 2002 semi-finalists South Korea on Friday. 

Bidding to make their fourth appearance in the World Cup quarter-finals, but their first in over 50 years, the Swiss have emphasised their reliance on well-drilled teamwork over individual showmanship. 

The only team to achieve three clean sheets from the three group games, the Swiss should offer Shevchenko as stiff a challenge as he does them ?? although both sides have new defensive problems to deal with going into the Cologne showdown. 

Switzerland were dealt the biggest blow when it transpired on Saturday that central defender Philippe Senderos, countrys most promising player, would miss the rest of the tournament after dislocating his shoulder during the win over the Koreans. 

Ukraine acknowledge they need to play a better class of football than they have shown in some group matches if they are to progress any further in the World Cup. 

Although coach Oleg Blokhin was satisfied with the result against Tunisia, he was unhappy about the quality of the football. He said his team needed to do some serious thinking before Mondays match in Cologne but was hopeful that Ukraine could progress to the quarter finals. 

Chances always die last he told reporters. 

Senderos was expected to undergo medical scans on Monday. The 21-year-old Arsenal player will be out of action for a minimum of two weeks, leaving Switzerland dependent on Sendeross 19-year-old clubmate Johan Djourou. 

Ukraines problem is short-term with Vyacheslav Svidersky and Andriy Rusol suspended. Potential replacement Dmitro Chigrinsky has been sidelined by a thigh injury and will probably play no further part in the tournament.

Switzerland: 1-Pascal Zuberbuehler; 3-Ludovic Magnin, 2-Johann Djourou, 20-Patrick Mueller, 23-Philipp Degen; 8-Raphael Wicky, 6-Johann Vogel, 7-Ricardo Cabanas, 22-Hakan Yakin, 16-Tranquillo Barnetta; 9-Alex Frei

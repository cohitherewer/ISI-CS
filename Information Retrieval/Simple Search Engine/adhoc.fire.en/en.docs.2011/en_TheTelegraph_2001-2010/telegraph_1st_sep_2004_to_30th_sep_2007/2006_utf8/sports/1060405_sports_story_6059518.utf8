 Lee helps Aussies clinch a thriller

 - Martyn century in visitors clean sweep 

 Australian team after the win in Johannesburg on Tuesday 

Johannesburg: Damien Martyn completed his century to help Australia to a tense two-wicket triumph over South Africa on Tuesday to complete an historic 3-0 clean sweep. 

Martyn top scored with 101 as Australia, who needed 292 to win, reached 294 for eight on the fifth morning of the final Test, with MoM Brett Lee hitting the winning runs. It was Australias first Test series whitewash in South Africa. 

Martyn, 34, with his Test future in question, batted for 286 minutes, faced 208 balls and hit 13 fours in his 13th century before he was dismissed with Australia 34 runs short of their target. 

Martyn and Lee had begun the fifth day with Australia 44 runs away from victory ? but effectively seven down due to the head injury that kept Justin Langer in the dressing room. 

Martyn, who needed seven for his century, reached it in the third over with a cut through third man for four. 

Martyn reached his century after five balls, Shaun Pollock struck with an in-swinger that hit the Australians back pad as he retreated defensively and he was given out lbw. 

With Langer seemingly preparing to ignore medical advice and pad up if necessary, he was spared the decision when Lee and Michael Kasprowicz (7 not out) steered Australia to victory with an unbroken stand of 19 runs off 17 balls. Lee (24 not out) cut Pollock through point for four to win the match.

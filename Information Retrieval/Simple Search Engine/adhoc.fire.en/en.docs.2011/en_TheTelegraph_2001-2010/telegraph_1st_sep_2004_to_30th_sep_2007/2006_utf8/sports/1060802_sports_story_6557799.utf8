 Lanka, NZ may fill in if WI decline

New Delhi: At least two other teams have been kept on stand-by should the West Indies decline to play in the scheduled tri-series in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in September this year, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said on Tuesday. 

WICB have sought time to speak to their players and give us their decision. In case they say no, we have other teams who are eager to play, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shan said. 

Shah said Sri Lanka and New Zealand were willing to play in place of the West Indies who are yet to settle a contracts issue with the players in the tri-series that also features Australia. 

Australia have given their consent. In a weeks time we should know one way or the other about West Indies participation, Shah said. 

WICB has issued a statement to clarify that it was yet to accept BCCIs invitation to play in the tri-series. 

No final decision has been made on the participation of the board in this series, the WICB said. 

The actual proposal was only received on Saturday, July 29, and the board immediately met on Sunday, July 30, by teleconference to review the proposal. 

We are now taking this proposal to the players even while we finalise the terms of the offer from the BCCI. 

We have been advised that an urgent response is required in view of the limited time available for these arrangements, the board said. (PTI)

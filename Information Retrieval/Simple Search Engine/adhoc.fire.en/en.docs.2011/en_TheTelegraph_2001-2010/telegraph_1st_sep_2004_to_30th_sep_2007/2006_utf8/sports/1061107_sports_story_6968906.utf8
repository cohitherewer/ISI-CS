 Jeev climbs four places to 73rd

New Delhi: A dodgy wrist may have prevented Jeev Milkha Singh from earning a second successive title, but his second-place finish at Fukuoka on the Japanese Tour helped him climb four places to 73rd in the latest world golf rankings. 

Among Jeevs compatriots, Jyoti Randhawa who won the Hero Honda Indian Open and Bilt Open in successive weeks, gained two places to 103rd spot. Another good result can see him join Jeev in the top 100 in the world rankings. 

Shiv Kapur climbed seven spots to 196th in the charts. Gaurav Ghei gained three places to 226th. However, Arjun Atwal slid four places to 249th spot. (PTI)

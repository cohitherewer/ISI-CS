 Cloud over Kallis

Sydney: South Africa allrounder Jacques Kallis is in doubt for this months limited-overs tri-series after aggravating an elbow injury while scoring a century in the third cricket Test against Australia. 

Kallis, who scored 111 on Tuesday at the Sydney Cricket Ground, will undergo a fitness test later in the week, South Africa chairman of selectors Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. 

Kallis, co-winner of the International Cricketer of the Year award, missed the drawn first Test in Perth last month after injuring his left elbow and needed treatment in the same area late on Monday. 

Jacques Kallis, whose left elbow injury has flared up again, will be assessed over the next few days, Lorgat said. A decision on his fitness for the one-day series will then be made. 

AB de Villiers is on standby should Kallis be ruled out. 

South Africa faces World Cup champion Australia and Sri Lanka in the series, which starts January 13 in Melbourne. 

Left-arm orthodox spinner Nicky Boje, who was replaced in the Test squad by rookie Johan Botha, has been left off the limited-overs squad. 

Botha, 23, made an unbeaten 20 on Test debut in Sydney and played four limited-overs Internationals in India in November. (AP)

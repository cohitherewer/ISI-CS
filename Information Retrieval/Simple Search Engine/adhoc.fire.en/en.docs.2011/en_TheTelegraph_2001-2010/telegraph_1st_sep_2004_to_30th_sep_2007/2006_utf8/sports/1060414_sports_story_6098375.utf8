 Flintoff has done a tremendous job, says Vaughan

London: Englands regular captain Michael Vaughan has admitted that the chronic knee injury has taken a toll on him and he would have to soon choose between Test and ODIs to prolong his career. 

Vaughan also said Andrew Flintoff, who took over the captaincy, had done a tremendous job and it was reassuring to know that England had alternatives if he decides to quit. 

Freddie has done a tremendous job. It was a very difficult position he was put in with so many senior players leaving. 

And that is part of trying to build a good team. When the captain does go eventually, the team should continue and play good cricket. 

Whenever I am given the opportunity to play both forms , I would love to continue.

 Sindh govt to invite Bagan, Md.Sp. 

Karachi: The Sindh government has drawn up plans to invite leading Calcutta football clubs Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting for a proposed Karachi Cup Invitation Inter-Club Football Tournament in April. 

Minister of sports and youth affairs in Sindh, Qamar Mansoor, said a sports contest between Pakistans Sindh Province and Indias Rajasthan was also in the pipeline. 

We are planning to host an inter-club football tournament for the Karachi cup in April. Mohun Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting of India, along with some European and Iranian clubs, would be invited to take part in it, Mansoor said in a press conference at the National Stadium during the fifth and final one-day International match between India and Pakistan here on Sunday. 

We are also planning to hold a Sindh versus Rajasthan sports contest on the lines of the sports meet between Pakistan Punjab and Indian Punjab, he said. 

The Minister also gave credit to the Indian and Pakistan cricket boards for successfully holding Test and one-day ties in this port city, which has been shunned by other cricket-playing nations citing security concerns. 

There have been no security problems in hosting the matches here, Mansoor said.

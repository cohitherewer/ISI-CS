 Fontaine urges rebellion against coach

 - Domenech dismisses talk of rift with Zidane 

 Just Fontaine 

 Toulouse: France should 

 be brave enough to revolt against the defensive tactics 

 of their coach Raymond Domenech and go on the attack against 

 Togo in their final World Cup group G clash on Friday, said 

 Just Fontaine. 

The 1998 champions need a two-goal win to be sure of progressing, but Fontaine feared Domenechs instincts were denying the French team firepower up front. Only a mutiny could force Domenech to change his mind, Fontaine, who scored a record 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup with France, said on Tuesday. 

I repeat, there is a danger. Especially because I know (coach Raymond) Domenech. When he has an idea in his head, there is no stopping him. Until the last 10 minutes against South Korea (before a late equaliser), he was the one who was right. So I fear that he will not make any concession. I fear that he will want to die with his ideas. There should be someone to convince him.

Meanwhile, Domenech dismissed reports of a rift between him and captain Zinedine Zidane, saying the veteran international is the leader among French players. I dont understand it, Domenech said on Tuesday. 

He denied falling out with Zidane, who walked past him without looking up after being substituted late in Sundays 1-1 draw with South Korea. 

 Describing talk of a split between coach and captain 

 pure speculation, Domenech said: Youve 

 been saying that for two years, it doesnt bother me. 

 We chat, we discuss tactics, and you interpret how you like. 

 We are working together. The group is fine and he is the 

 leader of our group.

 Ponting, Gilchrist in rescue act

Sydney: Ricky Ponting scored a brilliant century in his 100th Test to lead an Australian fightback in the final Test against South Africa on Wednesday. 

The Australian captain slammed 120 before Adam Gilchrist returned to form with a swashbuckling 86 to help the world champions finish on a respectable total of 359 after they started the day in deep trouble at 54 for three. 

South Africa led by 92 on the first innings after declaring at 451 for nine the previous day, and stretched their advantage to 96 by close of play on Day III, but lost a wicket in the process. 

AB de Villiers was trapped by Aussie speedster Brett Lee on what was the last ball of the day, leaving South African captain Graeme Smith unbeaten on three and his team a precarious four for the loss of one wicket in their second innings. Two days remain in this gripping contest at the SCG. 

The tourists might have had a much bigger lead had it not been for Ponting and Gilchrist, who tore into the visiting bowlers with a ferocity that belied Australias shaky position. 

Ponting joined Colin Cowdrey, Javed Miandad, Gordon Greenidge, Alec Stewart and Inzamam-ul Haq as the only players to reach triple figures in their 100th Test appearance with a cavalier display. 

The Australian captain resumed on 13 after the first hour was washed out by rain but quickly made up for lost time, chalking up his 27th Test hundred after lunch in 215 minutes from 143 balls. 

The 31-year-old, who made 96 on his debut against Sri Lanka a decade ago, hit 12 fours and a six as well as sharing a fourth-wicket stand of 130 with Hussey, that laid the platform for Australias fightback. 

They batted through the rain-shortened first session before Hussey was caught by Mark Boucher off debutant spinner Johan Botha, then Ponting was trapped by Jacques Kallis just before tea. 

Pontings dismissal triggered a minor collapse with Andrew Symonds (12) and Shane Warne (0) falling in successive deliveries off Andre Nel to leave Australia struggling at 226 for seven at tea, still 26 short of avoiding the follow-on. 

But Gilchrist, who had been struggling since the Ashes, rediscovered his form to keep the tail wagging, belting 10 fours and two sixes off 109 balls in 156 minutes.

Jaipur: Much would be at stake for the teams when an RCA Presidents XI take on a buoyed English side here Saturday in the only practice game before the seven-match one-day series. 

The visitors, who are here without their inspirational captain Andrew Flintoff (who has gone back home to see his new-born son), would be keen to maintain their winning momentum while the youngsters in the home team would try hard to make an impression on the selectors ahead of the one-dayers beginning in New Delhi on March 28. 

The match would offer important match practice to the teams as they switch over to the shorter version of the game after the conclusion of the three-Test series which ended in a 1-1 tie with England winning the final Test by 212 runs. 

The drubbing in Mumbai has served as a wake-up call to all and the national selectors are expected to be present to assess the performance of players like Gautam Gambhir and Suresh Raina. 

The injury-forced absence of star batsman Sachin Tendulkar from the Indian squad has thrown up a slot for a youngster and it would be interesting to see who finally fills into it. 

The injury scare concerning Virender Sehwag, who played with a back spasm in Mumbai, has also forced the selectors to look at the bench strength although the Delhi opener has been named in the 15-member squad. 

The English team, to be led by the Udaipur-born Vikram Solanki, had a strenuous workout this morning after arriving in the Pink City last evening while the Indians were in the process of assembling. 

The visitors have decided to rest in-form pacer Matthew Hoggard, wicketkeeper Geraint Jones, opener Andrew Strauss and middle-order batsman Paul Collingwood for the tie. 

One player in the local side who would attract the spotlight would be former India star and current Rajasthan captain Ajay Jadeja. 

This would be his first outing against an international side after fighting successfully a five-year ban slapped on him by the BCCI for match-fixing allegations. 

 The match would also afford an opportunity to promising 

 youngsters like V Shivramakrishnan, who hit a brilliant 

 hundred in Deodhar Trophy at the same ground, and Jaidev 

 Shah to check out their prowess against a quality opposition.

 TEAMS 

England: Vikram Solanki (captain), Owais Shah, Gareth Batty, Ian Bell, Ian Blackwell, Sajid Mahmood, Kevin Pietersen, Liam Plunkett, Matt Prior, Kabir Ali, James Anderson. 

RCA Presidents XI (from): Ajay Jadeja (captain), Gautam Gambhir, Venugopal Rao, Mohammed Kaif, Suresh Raina, Parthiv Patel, VRV Singh, R P Singh, Ramesh Powar, Piyush Chawla, Rohit Sharma, V Shivaramakrishnan, Pankaj Singh, Sanjay Gill, Dishant Yagnik, Jaidev Shah, Vikrant Yadav.

 HIGHS amp; LOWS: GAME IV

 The West Indies beat India by 

 six wickets in Port-of-Spain on Friday to seal a 3-1 ODI 

 series victory. The following are statistical highlights 

 of Game IV:

 Ajit Agarkar took his 250th ODI wicket when he dismissed 

 Ramnaresh Sarwan. He became the fourth Indian (and 14th 

 overall) to reach the 250-wicket landmark. Anil Kumble 

 (329 wickets in 264 ODIs), Jawagal Srinath (315 in 229) 

 and Kapil Dev (253 in 225) preceded Agarkar to the 250-wicket 

 club

 Agarkar became the quickest Indian (163 matches) to 

 reach 250 wickets. Srinath needed 182 matches, Kumble 

 189 and Kapil 218 matches, respectively. The world record 

 belongs to Pakistan off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq (138 matches)

 Agarkar (1145 runs and 250 wickets) became the seventh 

 allrounder to achieve the 1000-run, 250-wicket double 

 in ODIs. The others in this group are ? Sanath Jayasuriya 

 (10625 runs amp; 273 wkts in 357 matches), Kapil Dev 

 (3782 runs amp; 253 wkts in 225 matches), Wasim Akram 

 (3717 runs amp; 502 wkts in 356 matches), Shaun Pollock 

 (2805 runs amp; 348 wkts in 259 matches), Chaminda Vaas 

 (1784 runs amp; 352 wkts in 275 matches) and Shane Warne 

 (1018 runs amp; 293 wkts in 194 matches). 

 Mahendra Singh Dhonis unbeaten 46 is now the 

 best score by an Indian keeper in the Caribbean, 

 obliterating Kiran Mores 32 in Bridgetown in 1988-89

 Dhonis batting average has once again crossed 

 50. He now has 1453 runs at 50.10 per innings. Only three 

 others (among batsmen who have aggregates of over 1000) 

 have a superior average than Dhonis ? Mike Hussey 

 (1156 runs 77.07), Kevin Pietersen (1179 

 65.50) and Michael Bevan (6912 53.58)

 Dhoni is currently the only batsman with an average 

 of over 50 and a batting strike rate of over 100 (101.32) 

 in ODIs

 Brian Laras 69 was his first half-century against 

 India since his 60 in Singapore on September 5, 1999. 

 In 11 ODIs (and 10 innings) vs India during this period, 

 Laras highest score was 36 in Port-of-Spain in 2002-03. 

 It was also Laras best vs India as captain, bettering 

 the unbeaten 60 in Dhaka in 1998-99

 India have now lost four ODI series in the Caribbean, 

 having earlier gone down 1-2 in 1982-83, 0-5 in 1988-89 

 and 1-3 in 1996-97. The only time India won an ODI series 

 was 2-1 in 2001-02

 This was the West Indies ninth win in their last 

 11 ODIs since defeating New Zealand in Auckland on March 

 4, 2006, by 3 wickets. During this period, they lost once 

 to India (Game I of the ongoing series), while there was 

 no-result in an ODI vs Zimbabwe

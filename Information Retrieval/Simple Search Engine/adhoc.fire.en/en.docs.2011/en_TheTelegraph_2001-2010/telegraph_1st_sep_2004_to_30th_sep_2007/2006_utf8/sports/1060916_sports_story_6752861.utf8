 Mushtaq named assistant coach

Karachi: Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed has been handed an assistant coachs role for the Champions Trophy in India next month. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Saleem Altaf said on Friday that Mushtaq had been hired for the tournament, beginning on October 7, but the contract would be reviewed after the tournament. 

The appointment of Mushtaq was a PCB decision, Altaf said when asked whether Woolmer was consulted. 

We have brought in Mushtaq since bowling coach Waqar Younis would only be available for a week of the tournament. He will be busy at our National Cricket Academy, he added. 

The 36-year-old Mushtaq, who has made 52 Test and 144 ODI appearances, was drafted into the Test squad in the home series against England towards the end of last year, but did not play. 

He was later appointed as bowling consultant in the one-dayers and then bowling coach for the series against India earlier this year.

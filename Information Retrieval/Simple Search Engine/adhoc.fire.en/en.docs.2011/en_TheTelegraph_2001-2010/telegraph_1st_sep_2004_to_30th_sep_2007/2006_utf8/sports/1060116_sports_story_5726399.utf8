 Chidi saves the day for Sporting 

Margao: Chidi Edeh saved the day for Sporting Clube de Goa when they came from behind to hold JCT to a 1-1 draw in their National Football League match on Sunday. 

JCT, who were on the backfoot for most of the match, took the lead against the run of play in the 11th minute through Johnson. Chidi, who was adjudged the Man of the Match, equalised for the Goan side in the 61st minute. 

Sporting did most of the attacking but could not break through in the first-half as the strong JCT defenders remained composed to thwart most of their moves. 

Even when the JCT defence was caught napping, keeper Kalyan Chowbey came off with good saves to deny Nicolau Borges, Rajesh Meetei and Chidi of near certain goals. 

JCT mainly relied on counter-attacks to break the rival defence, one of which led to their goal. Rennedy Singh initiated a move from the middle and relayed the ball to Praveen Kumar inside the box. The latter squared it to the better-placed Johnson who essayed a firm left-footer to find the net.

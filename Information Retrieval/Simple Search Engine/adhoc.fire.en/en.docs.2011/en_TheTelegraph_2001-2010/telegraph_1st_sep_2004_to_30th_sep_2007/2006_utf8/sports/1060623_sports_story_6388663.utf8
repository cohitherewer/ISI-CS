 Zaheer scalps 5, Sourav fails

London: Graeme Hick struck his 100th hundred for Worcestershire Thursday to become only the eighth player to score a century of centuries for a single county. 

Northamptonshire were bundled out for 67 in reply to Worcestershires 543/9 declared. Zaheer Khan was the wrecker-in-chief with 5/27. Lance Klusener top scored with 21. Sourav was castled by Zaheer for 2. Following on, Northants were 76 for two. 

Hick, unbeaten on 93 overnight in a second division County match against Northamptonshire, completed the feat in front of Worcestershires home fans at New Road. It didnt take long for Hick to add the seven required runs he needed for his hundred. 

A flicked single off his legs against Australia seamer Matthew Nicholson took him to the landmark in 182 balls with one six and 11 fours. 

Hicks total of 130 first class hundreds means he has now moved into eighth-place in the all-time list, overtaking former England captain and opening batsman Sir Len Hutton.England legend Sir Jack Hobbs heads the all-time list with 197 first-class centuries. 

 Worcestershires director of cricket, Steve Rhodes, 

 said: Graeme has achieved something that not many 

 people can dream of doing.

 CAB mulls change

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB is mulling a change in the composition of its office-bearers. The powers-that-be are toying with the idea of having one secretary and four assistant secretaries to ensure smooth day-to-day functioning. 

According to a top source, the move may materialise before the 75th AGM in July. 

The move to convert the joint secretaries posts to a single secretary is likely to be strongly confronted by several quarters. Moreover, it will mean convening a special general body meeting where a two-third majority will be required to pass the motion. 

This looks a bit difficult at this juncture (but not impossible), as this move can antagonise a few affiliated units, an official stated. 

Meanwhile, the opposition is yet to decide on a candidate to contest the presidents post. City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjees name has been doing the rounds, but no final decision has been taken.

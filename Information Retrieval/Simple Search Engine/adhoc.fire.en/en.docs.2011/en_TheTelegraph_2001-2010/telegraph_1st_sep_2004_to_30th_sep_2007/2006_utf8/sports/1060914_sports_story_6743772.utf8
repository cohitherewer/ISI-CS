London: European champions Barcelona led the charge of the fancied teams over the first obstacle of the Champions League course on Tuesday. 

Barcelona thumped Levski Sofia 5-0 a sobering start for the first Bulgarian club to reach this stage of the competition for their biggest Champions League win. 

Bayern Munich played superbly in the second half after a woeful opening 45 minutes to beat Spartak Moscow 4-0 at home, while AS Roma routed Shakhtar Donetsk 4-0 in Rome with all their goals also coming in the second half. 

Chelsea beat Werder Bremen 2-0 in London with German national skipper Michael Ballack scoring his first goal for the club as he fired home from the penalty spot against his compatriots to seal the win. 

Inter Milan, though, slipped up in Lisbon, losing 0-1 to Sporting and having Patrick Vieira sent off midway through the second half. In other games, Valencia beat Olympiakos Piraeus 4-2 in Greece in a match which swung this way and that. Fernando Morientes, the former Real Madrid striker back in Spain after a short sojourn in Liverpool, scored a hattrick for Valencia. 

Two matches failed to end conclusively with PSV Eindhoven and Liverpool drawing 0-0 in The Netherlands, while Galatasaray were held to a goalless draw in Istanbul by Girondins Bordeaux. 

Fittingly, it was European champions Barcelona who scored the first goal of this seasons competition proper following the qualifying rounds. 

Andres Iniesta put Barcelona ahead after seven minutes and they went on to dominate not only the Bulgarians but also the elements in the Nou Camp. 

Despite heavy rainfall throughout the match, Barcelona played superbly with Ludovic Giuly (39), Carles Puyol (49), Samuel Eto (58) and Ronaldinho who scored in stoppage time blowing Sofia off the park. 

Bayern, showed Spartak Moscow they still know what European football is all about in the second half at least. 

Claudio Pizarro set them on way with a 48th-minute strike while Roque Santa Cruz (52), Bastian Schweinsteiger (71) and Hasan Salihamidzic (84) wrapped up the victory. 

The nights major upset was in Lisbon where Inter, installed as Italian champions after Juventus were stripped of the title for their involvement in the scandal, lost 0-1 to Sporting. The match was won and lost in a five-minute period halfway through the second half when Marco Caneira scored a stunning goal for Sporting and Inter midfielder Vieira was sent off on his European debut for his new club after his move from Juventus. 

Vieira was sent off for head-butting Brazilian striker Liedson, the France midfielders second bookable offence. 

One of his old clubs, Arsenal, who reached the Champions League final last season, start their campaign at Hamburg SV on Wednesday.

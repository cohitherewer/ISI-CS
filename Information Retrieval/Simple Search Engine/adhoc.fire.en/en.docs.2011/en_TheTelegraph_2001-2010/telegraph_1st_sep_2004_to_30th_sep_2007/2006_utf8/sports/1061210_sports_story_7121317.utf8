Potchefstroom: Zaheer Khan bowled the touring Indians to a resounding 96-run win over Rest of South Africa on the penultimate day at the Sedgars Park here Saturday. 

The left-arm pacemans figures of three for 36 do not quite reflect the role he played in stopping the hosts from successfully chasing down a target of 321 runs. The hosts were eventually dismissed for 224. 

Zaheer took two early wickets but none was more important than the third strike when, coming in for yet another spell in the final session, he induced an ill-timed pull from Justin Kemp (53) to snuff the fight out of the hosts. 

Kemp had put the tourists on the defensive with a century stand for the fifth wicket with Vaughn van Jaarsveld (66) but his dismissal handed over all the aces to the Indians. 

Kemp was guilty of ejecting Van Jaarsveld out from the middle when he pushed Harbhajan Singh on to the off-side and took off for a single after a little hesitancy. 

Van Jaarsveld, caught in two minds, couldnt beat the throw from cover collected in nick of time by wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Van Jaarsveld played a highly attractive knock, smashing 66 from 70 balls with 10 fours and a huge six off Harbhajan Singh. 

Acting skipper VVS Laxman, sensing the discomfort of the new batsmen, turned to his main trump card Zaheer Khan and the left-arm seamer rewarded the faith with the scalp of Kemp. 

Kemp batted with authority and power in thrashing his half-century from 62 balls but the twin strike at a critical juncture, left Rest of South Africa doddering at 183 for six. 

Harbhajan Singh had Paul Adams (0) caught at forward short leg to make it seven down without any further addition and then took two wickets off successive balls to leave Rest down to the last pair at the crease. 

The Indian medium-pacers repeated the good work of first innings and young VRV Singh forced himself into contention for a berth in the eleven for first Test with two critical wickets off successive balls in the middle of the innings. 

Earlier, the Indians resumed at 93 for 7 and its tail wagged a bit to stretch the score to 142 all out. 

Irfan Pathan, like in the first innings, was the top-scorer again with an unbeaten knock of 40 runs. 

Alfonso Thomas was the pick of Rest of South Africa bowlers with a haul of seven for 56.

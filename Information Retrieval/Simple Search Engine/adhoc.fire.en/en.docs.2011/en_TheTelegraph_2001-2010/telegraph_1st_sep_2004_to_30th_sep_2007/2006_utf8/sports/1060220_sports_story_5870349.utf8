 Challenge not only for Sourav: More 

Karachi: Selection committee chairman Kiran More on Sunday refused to confirm whether former captain Sourav Ganguly would be considered for the first Test against England starting in Nagpur on March 1. 

It would be unjustified to say that only Sourav has a challenge on his hands in the presence of the youngsters who have excelled on this tour. I think it is a challenge for everyone. The best thing about this team is that there is a lot of competition which is a healthy sign, the former wicketkeeper said. (PTI)

 Boucher keeps SA afloat

 - Ntini picks up six for 100; Warne, Clark rip through Proteas

 Stuart Clark at the Wanderers on Sunday

Johannesburg: Shane Warne and Stuart Clark shared seven wickets for Australia, but Mark Bouchers defiant half-century kept South Africas hopes alive in the third Test on Sunday. 

South Africa were 250 for eight in their second innings, a lead of 283, when bad light ended play 17 overs early on Day III. 

Australia were dismissed for 270 in reply to South Africas first innings of 303. 

Fast bowler Clark took four for 64 and leg-spinner Warne picked up three for 83 when the home side batted a second time. 

Boucher was 55 not out with Andre Nel on 18 in a stand of 56 for the unbroken ninth wicket. 

Australia had resumed on 246 for seven but South Africa wrapped up the innings in the space of 27 deliveries with fast bowler Makhaya Ntini ending with six for 100. 

Jeers had echoed around the ground when Brett Lee, on 45, edged a delivery from medium pacer Shaun Pollock, the eighth ball of the day, to first slip. 

Boeta Dippenaar dived to take the catch and television replays suggested he took it cleanly. 

But Lee stood his ground and after umpires Tony Hill and Steve Bucknor conferred he continued his innings. 

In his next over Pollock had a fending Michael Kasprowicz caught by Herschelle Gibbs in the gully for two. 

The innings ended five balls later when Lee top-edged a pull off Ntini to Nicky Boje at long-off. 

Lee was roundly booed when he reached his half-century, but his 64 surpassed the 62 he scored against the West Indies in Brisbane in 2000-01 as his career-best score. 

AB de Villiers was the first man out in South Africas second innings for four when he shouldered arms to a delivery from Clark that moved towards the right-hander off the seam. (Reuters)

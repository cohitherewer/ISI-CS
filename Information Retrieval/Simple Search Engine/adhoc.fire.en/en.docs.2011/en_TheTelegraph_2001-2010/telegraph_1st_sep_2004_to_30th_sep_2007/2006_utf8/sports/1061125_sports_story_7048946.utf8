The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Insipid response to Sunday card 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The Guineas day card is shockingly poor 35 horses for six events, which also include four fillies vying for the 1,600m Calcutta 1000 Guineas. The possible reason could be that there are no off-course takers for the city races on a premium day like Sunday. The first race starts at 12.50 p.m.

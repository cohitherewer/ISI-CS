The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Checklist 

 / Day 8 to end of 1st tound

 Misses, saves and gestures...

 JAYDEEP BASU

 Cambiasso

 The men have finally been separated 

 from the boys, and it is time for the traditional powerhouses 

 of the World Cup like Brazil, Argentina, Italy, England 

 or France to show their mettle in the knockout rounds. But 

 to do so, they will have battle it out against some of the 

 surprise entrants to the second round, mainly Ghana and 

 Australia. The following is the checklist of the ups and 

 downs of Round I:

 Team of the first round: Ghana

 Debutants Ghana became the fifth 

 African nation in the history of World Cup to enter the 

 second round. They were placed in a group where all three 

 other teams were ranked in Fifas top 10, but Ratomic 

 Dujkovics side pulled off stunning victories against 

 Czech Republic and the US after losing the first game against 

 Italy. While Ghanas entry to the next round sparked 

 celebrations all over Africa, it prompted Ghana president 

 John Kufuor to confess that he locked himself alone in the 

 office to watch the match. I didnt want people 

 around me ...So if my nerves had gotten the better of me, 

 nobody would know.

 Player of the first round: 

 Essien (Gha)

 Midfielder Michael Essien was 

 the key man behind Ghanas qualification to the second 

 round and earned praise from even the rival coaches.

 Against Italy, a 0-2 loss, he 

 was used as an attacking midfielder. Against the Czech Republic, 

 a 2-0 win, he was used deeper in the midfield and was simply 

 magnificent. Essien not only organised the team, but also 

 broke up a lot of plays. He was the chief distributor and 

 joined in the attack. To many, Essien is the modern two-way 

 midfielder. He scores goals and hes also very tough 

 defensively.

 Youngest performer of the first 

 round: Valencia (Ecu)

 Hailed as one of their brightest 

 young talents, 21-year-old Luis Valencia may well be considered 

 the future of Ecuadorian football and one of the chief architects 

 of his teams entry into the second round.

 Valencia, who can play in central 

 midfield as well as on the right wing, combines speed with 

 great technical abilities. Valencia was linked with a host 

 of top clubs in South and Central America, but ultimately 

 chose to pitch up in Europe last summer as he signed a five-year 

 contract for Villarreal.

 Save of the first round: Kawaguchi 

 (Jpn)

 Zicos Japan did not exactly 

 do anything memorable in their three-match stint at the 

 World Cup, but their goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi made 

 a superb diving save off a penalty kick taken by Dario Srna 

 of Croatia, keeping Japans hopes alive till the last 

 match against Brazil.

 Goal of the first round: Cambiasso 

 (Arg)

 Esteban Cambiassos goal 

 in Argentinas 6-0 win against Serbia and Monetnegro 

 has been labelled as one of the best goals in the history 

 of World Cup. The goal was a conclusion of a majestic 24-pass 

 move that went the entire length of the pitch. The climax 

 came when Juan Roman Riquelme exchanged a snappy 1-2 with 

 Javier Saviola, who clipped it to Cambiasso at the edge 

 of the box. The midfielder then took one touch to find Herman 

 Crespo, who returned the ball to him with a smart back-heel 

 and Cambiasso blasted it into the roof of the net.

 Coach of the first round: Dujkovic 

 (Gha)

 No one was under as much pressure 

 as Dujkovic. Yet, he guided his team successfully through 

 a tough group to make the second round. While all other 

 celebrated after the Ghana-US tie, the coach went on record 

 saying that some people in the team wanted him out after 

 losing to Italy. 

 Match of the first round: Aus 

 vs Cro

 Australias nerve-jangling 

 2-2 draw with Croatia was perhaps the most thrilling encounter 

 of the first round. The draw put the Aussies into the second 

 round besides encapsulating everything about the Socceroos. 

 Twice the Australians trailed in a game they could not afford 

 to lose, but on both occasions they simply rolled up their 

 sleeves and hammered away at the door to earn a priceless 

 point.

 Quote of the first round: Bruce 

 Arena

 The only country in the 

 world that I think can ever have high aspirations and say, 

 We want to win the World Cup is Brazil. Everybody 

 else hopes they get a good draw and hopes they play well 

 and get some breaks.

 Miss of the first round: Mateus 

 of Angola against Iran

 It was a miss that broke many 

 hearts back in Angola. Placed unmarked in the penalty box, 

 all Mateus had to do was to place the ball in. Instead, 

 he shot the ball over the crosspiece.

 Worst referring decision of 

 the first round: Graham Poll (Australia versus Croatia)

 English referee Graham Poll, in-charge 

 of Australias chaotic and wild 2-2 draw against Croatia, 

 booked Josip Simunic three times but forgot to send him 

 off until after showing him a third yellow, blew for full 

 time in just as what would have been Australias winner 

 was crossing the line, and also missed a blatant handball 

 in the penalty area by Croatian defender Stjepan Thomas.

 Worst behaved fans of the first 

 round: English fans in the Sweden match

 After two weeks of relative calm, 

 English fans finally decided to show their true colours 

 in the match against Sweden in Cologne. Around 2,500 English 

 fans, mostly drunk, congregated in Colognes Altar 

 Market area, threw bottles and chairs at the police. As 

 the police used pepper spray to restore order, 16 officers 

 were injured, including a female officer, who required hospital 

 treatment for cuts. Six fans were held.

 Disappointment of the first 

 round: Michael Owens injury

 One of the most exciting players 

 of modern day football, Michael Owen was ruled out of the 

 World Cup after injuring his knee in the match against Sweden. 

 While it was a heartbreak for soccer fans all over the world, 

 Owen was devastated. 

 Surprise package of the first 

 round: Australia

 There were some coaches who accused 

 them of playing rugby. The Brazilians called them too physical 

 a side. Others simply labelled them as the upstarts of the 

 World Cup. But the Aussies, under Guus Hiddink, made it 

 amply clear that they can no way be ignored. 

 Most touching gesture:

 Togo may have lost to South Korea 

 but earned a lot of admirers, thanks to a moment of sportsmanship 

 from defender Massamasso Tchangai. When Koreas Lee 

 Eul-Yong went down with a cramp, Tchangai came to his help 

 and gave him an impromptu leg massage that drew widespread 

 praise.

 Most disappointing moment:

 The disappointed face of Czech 

 Republic coach Karol Bruckner after his teams ouster 

 from the World Cup at the end of the match against Italy. 

 Bruckner looked friendless as no one at his bench came up 

 to console the man without his two top strikers ? Milan 

 Baros and Jan Koller. Bruckner, however, shook off his disappointment, 

 went up to the rival bench and was the first man to congratulate 

 Italian coach Lippi.

 Match with maximum turnout:

 Sweden versus Paraguay, 72,000. 

 Attendance of the first round: The first 48 matches were 

 watched by 2,484,439 fans, producing an average attendance 

 of 51,759. The competition is on course to be the second-most 

 watched World Cup with USA 94 leading the way with an average 

 of 68,991.

 Most yellow cards in a match:

 8 each (Spain vs Tunisia; Portugal 

 vs Mexico, Ukraine vs Tunisia and Sweden vs Paraguay); 7 

 Australia vs Croatia (Four to Croatia, three to Australia), 

 Ghana vs Czech Republic (Six to Ghana, one to Czech Republic)

 Total yellow cards: 258

 Total red cards: 18

 Total goals scored: 117

 Uthappa, Dhawan hit centuries

 - India A pile up 311/4 

 Uthappa made 116 

Abu Dhabi: Centuries from openers Robin Uthappa and Shikhar Dhawan propelled India A to a mammoth 311 for four in the Eurasia Series one-dayer against Holland A at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Sunday. 

India international Uthappa cracked a stroke-filled 116 while Delhi batsman Dhawan hit an equally aggressive 127 as the Indians sent the Europeans on a leather hunt. 

The right-left combination put on 264 runs for the opening stand as they toyed with a pedestrian attack on a benign pitch after captain Yalaka Venugopal Rao elected to bat. 

Seamer Ernst van Giezen, in the circumstances, returned an economical three for 49. 

Runs began to flow from the outset for the Indians when 35 runs came from the first six overs. 

Uthappa found the slow seam-up stuff of Giezen and Mudassar Bukhari easy pickings as he leaned on his front foot to drive them through the off often. 

Uthappa needed 132 balls for his 116 that contained 13 fours. His innings came to an end when Giezen had him caught by Szwarczynski. 

At the other end, Dhawan proved what his Karnataka partner could do, he could do even better. 

After lagging behind Uthappa in run scoring initially, Dhawan gained momentum once he crossed the 50-run mark. He reached his 100 with a boundary to long-off ahead of Uthappa. 

Dhawans 127 came from 142 balls with 17 fours. 

Giezen was rewarded for his tidy bowling when he had Vidyut Sivaramakrishnan for a first ball duck and then Dinesh Karthik for 15.

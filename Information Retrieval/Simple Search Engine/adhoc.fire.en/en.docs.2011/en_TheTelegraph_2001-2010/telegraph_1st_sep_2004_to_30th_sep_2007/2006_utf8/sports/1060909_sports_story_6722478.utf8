The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 PCA awaiting Centres okay

 - Intikhab alams reappointment

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Intikhab Alam 

Calcutta: The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) move to reappoint Intikhab Alam as coach has been held up: The Union sports ministry hasnt given its clearance as yet. 

The former Pakistan captain and World Cup-winning coach in those days, though, the designation was cricket manager did the job both in 2004-05 and 2005-06. 

As per our contract with him, Intikhab was to have joined on September 1. His arrival has been delayed as we havent received New Delhis okay, a PCA official told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Mohali (where the Inderjit Singh Bindra-headed state body is headquartered) on Friday evening, he added: The necessary documents have been submitted to the sports ministry Apparently, theyve been forwarded to two other ministries home and external affairs Their clearance is mandatory 

The documents include a copy of PCAs contract with Intikhab and an endorsement from the Board of Control for Cricket in India. 

Hopefully, well get the green signal in the next week or so Even Intikhabs visa cant be processed till weve got the okay, the PCA official pointed out. 

The scrutiny, one assumes, is more intense because of Intikhabs nationality. His roots, however, are in our own Hoshiarpur. 

The decision to reappoint Intikhab, 64, was taken at the PCAs working committee meeting on August 5. 

Punjab made the Ranji Trophy final in his first season as coach, but the state didnt do well in 2005-06. 

Intikhab, though, helped Dinesh Mongia maintain a high degree of consistency and hes back in Team India. 

In Mongias words, the coach helped change his mind-set and made him hungry for big scores.

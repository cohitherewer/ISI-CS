 Iconic Waugh may pick Indias cricket idol

New Delhi: Steve Waugh might have hung his boots, but he might still play a role in Indian cricket. 

The former Australian captain has plans for a talent hunt reality show, which is awaiting official seal of the BCCI. 

At the moment it is only a proposal, we are looking at it, BCCI marketing sub-committee chairman Lalit Modi said on Saturday. 

Waughs reality show, if given the go-ahead, will run parallel to the cricket star programme that was announced a few weeks ago. 

But Waugh faces stiff competition from Sahara One who also have put in a similar proposal to the BCCI. 

We have received three proposals, out of which one was rejected straightaway. Saharas and Waughs are the remaining two, Modi said. 

The BCCI vice-president clarified that the reality shows would be purely a talent hunt programme that would enhance the coffers of the BCCI and nothing more. 

There has been some misconceptions and newspapers have reported that the winner will get into the Indian team. There is no such thing, he said. 

Besides Italian designers Canali, Indian textile brand Reid and Taylor has also joined the race to win the rights to supply for Indian team members wardrobe. 

Among other decisions, the marketing sub-committee which met here on Saturday, also agreed to invite tenders for ground rights for domestic championship matches and title sponsors for international matches in India. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI is all set to rope in it giant Microsoft for software solutions that will evaluate and help improve the performances of its umpires. 

The deal is not finalised yet, but we are in the final stages of negotiations with Microsoft, Modi said. We zeroed in on Microsoft after looking at several technological solutions, Modi, also a vice-president of the BCCI, said. 

BCCIs efforts come in the wake of the recent observation by ICC General Manager-cricket Dave Richardson that Indian umpires were not upto international standards.

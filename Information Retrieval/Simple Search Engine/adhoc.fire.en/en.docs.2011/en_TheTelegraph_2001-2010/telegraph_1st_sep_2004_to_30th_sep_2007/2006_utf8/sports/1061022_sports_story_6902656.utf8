 Ponting praises Watson, Martyn

 - I knew it was going to be tough: Flintoff 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: Ricky Ponting on Saturday was full of praise for Damien Martyn and Shane Watson for steering Australia to a six-wicket win over England in the Champions Trophy. 

Admitting that luck was also with Australia in the crucial encounter, the Aussie captain said that changes in bowling sometimes do play a big factor in turning the match. Sometimes it doesnt click also, he said. Today it played a vital role as Watson had England in all sorts of trouble. That, too, at a time when their batsmen were on top of our bowling. 

The Aussie skipper, who had a forgettable match with the bat, said it would have been impossible to win the match without Martyn. He had always been the key member of our batting. Today he came up with a gem of an innings. We knew the pair of Martyn and Hussey had the ability to swing the match our way. 

Martyn, when asked to comment on his knock, said: We were waiting for this game from the time we last played England in the Ashes. I enjoyed the moment. It was a good day in office. I feel good and relieved to be back among the runs. Its a nice feeling since today is my birthday. 

Heaping praise on Mitchell Johnson, Ponting said: He is performing on the big stage and getting big players out. He got Lara and Sachin at Kuala Lumpur and Pietersen here. He is fitting into international cricket very well. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff said he was disappointed with the defeat, but has not lost faith in the team as well as in his own captaincy. Given the permutation and combinations, our next match against the West Indies could be our last tie in the Champions Trophy. We will play for pride and try to improve upon our performance in the tournament. 

The England captain said: We came here to perform, but it was disappointing to lose. I knew it was going to be tough. We hoped we could pull it off but in the end it was not enough.

 Jeev stays No. 1

 - ASIAN ORDER OF MERIT 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Kuala Lumpur: Jeev Milkha Singh remained on top of the UBS Asian Order of Merit, while Shiv Kapur and Amandeep Johl were among the top-20 on the list released after the $600,000 Maekyung Open. 

Jeev, winner of the Volvo China Open last month, leads the list with winnings of $389,391 but South Koreas Charlie Wi has narrowed the gap and is in second place after picking up a cheque of $12,638 to raise his seasons tally to $324,325. 

Shiv, who missed the cut in South Korea, has $130,407 and is in 12th, while Johl, third at the Maekyung Open, moved up ten places to from 25th with a cheque of $34,275. His total is $94,545 for the season. 

One of the most significant movers was Maekyung Open winner Suk Jong-Ryul of South Korea, who came through Asian Tour Qualifying School, who picked up his first cheque of the season, $125,000, which rocketed him up to 13th place. 

Also showing rapid move upwards was runner-up Bryan Saltus, who went from 76th to 20th place. 

The tenacious Indian golfer that he is, Jeev fought tooth and nail to end a frustrating seven-year title drought which was blighted by injuries, but he proved the old adage that hard work and perseverance do pay off handsomely. Winning the Volvo China Open last month was a true reflection of his skill and capabilities. The 34-year-old Chandigarh golfer, who last won in 1999, held his nerve to finally claim his first European Tour title with a one-shot victory at the co-sanctioned meet. 

 I just cant explain this feeling... Its 

 like a dream come true. ... Im really excited and 

 happy the way it worked out. The seven-year-itch is over 

 and the monkey is off my back, he said after the victory.

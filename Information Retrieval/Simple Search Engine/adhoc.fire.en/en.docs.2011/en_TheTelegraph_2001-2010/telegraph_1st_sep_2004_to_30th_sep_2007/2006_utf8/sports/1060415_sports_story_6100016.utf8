 Asif gets a pay raise from PCB

Karachi: Pakistan pacer Mohammed Asif has been given a pay raise after his impressive performances against India and Sri Lanka. 

The 23-year-old had earned the pay raise after picking up 24 wickets in his last three Tests, said a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official. 

He was being paid Rs 30,000 ($500) as a monthly retainer and this has now been increased to 75,000, director Abbas Zaidi said. This monthly raise is besides match fees and other incentives paid to the players per Test and one-day appearances. 

Asif, who hails from a village near Sheikhupura, a small town in eastern Punjab, has signed up for English County Leicestershire before Pakistans tour begins in late June. 

The official said Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer had spoken to Leicestershire and asked them to keep Asifs workload to a minimum in order to keep him fit for the series. 

Woolmer is concerned with the workload Asif has carried in the last few months and does not want a situation where the youngster gets stale for Pakistans matches, he said. 

Asif, who took 11 for 71 in Pakistans Test win over Sri Lanka at Kandy earlier this month, said he was looking forward to his stint with the County. Playing in England has always been a big ambition for me. I am hoping to learn and improve a lot from my stint with Leicestershire. It will help me prepare for our tour, he said. 

Asif has carried the workload of the Pakistan attack in the absence of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar who is recovering from a knee injury. 

Shabbir Ahmed has been banned for a year since last December for an illegal bowling action and Mohammed Sami has been dropped for poor form. (Reuters)

Mumbai: The cricketing god will make us believe that Australia and the Champions Trophy dont even pretend to mix. The games centre of excellence has long remained prettily and happily seated Down Under. But when it comes to the mini World Cup, one of the weirdest ironies is that the three-time world champions havent made it to the title-round even once on the previous four occasions. 

Common sense suggests that Ricky Pontings Australia will take on the West Indies at the Brabourne Stadium on Wednesday with sights set on ensuring that their build-up to the World Cup defence not only gets a perfect kick, but one of the anomalies in their rich cricketing history lies settled. 

A day after the South African captain Graeme Smith had described the pitch as not up to the international standard, his West Indies counterpart remarked that a better adaptation to the conditions would hold the key. 

Its not necessary that the best team should win on this wicket, but everything depends on how one suits himself to the situation and which team plays better at which half of the game. What we have gained from our first match here (a nine-wicket defeat to Sri Lanka on Saturday last) is that from 2.30 to 6 pm, the wicket remains dry and you need to get the most of it, Lara told a press conference on Tuesday. 

Ponting, however, appeared unperturbed by the unusual nature of the wicket. We believe in our ability to adapt to various situations and, hopefully, tomorrow wont be an exception for us, he maintained. 

Just the other day, Andrew Symonds was strongly pitching in for Shane Watson as Adam Gilchrists opening partner in the upcoming World Cup. Ponting also hinted at putting the combination under trial here. We are keeping all options open, including changes in batting order up front, the Aussie captain said. Watson, riding high on an impressive showing in Malaysia, may come in place of Simon Katich. 

Everybody in the team knows his role pretty well. Sometimes you need flexibility so that you can cope with different situations faster than usual. The World Cup is a few months away from now, so you need to have all your contingency plans in place before leaving for the West Indies. I think we are on course for that, Gilchrist later told The Telegraph. 

Ponting dropped hints that their new kid on the block, Dan Cullen who replaced Stuart Clark from the original squad might start with Brad Hogg, in a 3-2 bowling attack.

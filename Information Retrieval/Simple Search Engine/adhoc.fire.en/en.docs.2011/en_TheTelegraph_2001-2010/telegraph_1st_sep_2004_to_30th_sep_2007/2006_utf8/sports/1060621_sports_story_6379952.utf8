 Argentinas challenge is to maintain standard

Herzogenaurach: Two distinct and distinguished schools of football meet at the World Cup when Argentina face The Netherlands in their final Group C match in Frankfurt on Wednesday. 

It promises to be a game of high quality although the sting has been taken out of the contest because the sides are already through to the second round with maximum points. 

World Cup matches between the two countries have been rich in skill and drama, not least when a brilliant Dennis Bergkamp goal gave the Dutch a 2-1 win in the 1998 quarter finals in Marseille and sent Daniel Passarellas Argentina packing. 

Twenty years earlier, captain Passarella lifted the trophy in Buenos Aires when Argentina beat The Netherlands 3-1 after extra time in the final, the only time the Dutch have lost to the South Americans. 

The last time the sides met in Germany, in the 1974 tournament, an ill-prepared Argentina were hammered 0-4 by a Dutch side inspired by coach Rinus Michels and skipper Johan Cruyff. 

That match was played in Gelsenkirchen, where Argentina set a benchmark for this tournament with a 6-0 rout of Serbia and Montenegro that kept them top of the group on goal difference. 

An extra bonus for winning the group and playing the earlier second-round match is the longer break before the quarter finals if they still remain in the competition. 

The coaches are likely to make wholesale changes to rest players and erase yellow cards. 

Dutch coach Marco van Basten has six players on one yellow while counterpart Jose Pekerman has three. 

It is an important match against a strong opponent and we would like to win to finish top in the group but the coach does not want to take any risks, said Dutch playmaker Rafael van der Vaart. 

The Dutch have minor injury worries. Philip Cocu and John Heitinga are bothered by ankle and hamstring injuries though Van Basten said the duo would be fit. 

Argentinas only unavailable player is Luis Gonzalez, who is recovering from a groin strain and will not be fit before the quarter finals. 

Pekerman would, no doubt, like his side to be as good as they were against Serbia. 

Striker Hernan Crespo, one of the players booked and likely to be rested, said: The challenge is to maintain this standard. 

The match is a milestone for two Dutch players. Cocu is set to win his 100th cap and goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar can equal the national record of 112 held by Frank de Boer.

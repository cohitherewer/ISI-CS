Colombo: The weather gods continued to play havoc as the first one-dayer between India and Sri Lanka was curtailed by thundershowers at the Sinhalese Sports Club ground here on Friday. 

The match, which had started four-and-a-half hours behind schedule due to a wet outfield following morning rains, was called off for the day and will be continued on the reserve day on Saturday. 

This will be the 22nd instance of a match being played over two days. In the sub continent, only once before has this happened - India versus Bangladesh in 2000 Asia Cup in Dhaka. 

India were 11 for no loss with skipper Rahul Dravid on nine and Sachin Tendulkar, returning to international cricket after nearly five months, on two. 

The game was into the fourth over when bad light forced suspension of play. 

Minutes later, the heavy dark clouds that were hovering above burst open and left puddles of water on the ground, mainly along the boundary line. 

The ground staff, who had worked tirelessly during the day to get the game going, had placed the covers on the playing square but the rains struck before they could cover the outfield. 

The boundary had been brought forward to exclude the soggy outer region and with more water seeping through the covers, it is going to be that much more difficult to have the game restarted. 

Dravid, electing to bat, survived two appeals of leg before in the first over of the innings by Chaminda Vaas. 

Sachin, who underwent a shoulder surgery in March, was off the mark the first ball he faced from Lasith Malinga, and Dravid opened his account in the same over through a flick off the thigh pads to fine leg fence. 

Dravid then punched Vaas to the cover boundary in the next over before the weather gods intervened four balls into the following over.

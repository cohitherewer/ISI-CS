Calcutta: They say you cant predict anything in cricket till the last ball is bowled. But during the Bengal-Gujarat Ranji Trophy Super League Group B match at the Eden, it was the morning session which proved to be decisive. And, as it turned out the hosts gave up from what so far had been a great fight back. 

It was in the space of two overs and three balls, and 13 minutes before the lunch, Gujarat (read: Hitesh Majmudar) turned the match upside down bowling Bengal out for 326, three-run short of Gujarats 329. Majmudar assured themselves two points, unless of course, theres a miracle for the home team on the final day. 

Consider this: At 291 for seven, Bengals overnight not out batsman Laxmi Ratan Shukla was on 80, while Ranadeb Bose, who joined him, was quick to settle down, rotating the strikes easily. A desperate Parthiv Patel then introduced leg-spinner Timil Patel. But to no avail. With two fine-leg flicks to the boundary, Ranadeb took their total to five runs closer (324). 

But, they also say, cricket is a funny game. 

A desperate attempt to reach for a ball way outside the off-stump earned Gujarat Laxmis prize-scalp. Getting out on 93, Laxmi who could well have been Bengals hero, exposed the fragile Bengal tail. And Parthivs men did nothing wrong in winding it all up to take a crucial three-run first innings lead, and a possible two points. 

Gujarat, by the way, have been jinxed for Bengal something, which skipper Deep Dasgupta too admitted post-Day Three. 

If the other day the match was memorable for Parthiv (having notched his first Ranji century), Tuesday was something special for their seamer Hitesh, who took his 100th Ranji wicket after scalping Sourasish Lahiri. 

In fact, Hitesh should be thankful to his skipper for taking him to the milestone. Had it not for the former India wicketkeepers quick reflexes to his left, it would have been a miss (and perhaps a boundary). A dismissal, which surely make anybody feel that its been an improved Parthiv. And later Parthiv too acknowledged: It was a great effort. 

Having run through Bengals tail, Hitesh finished the day with a five for 65. Though it was not his personal best (which is six for 66 against Saurashtra), it ranks as one of the best for him. The effort was crucial in helping my team get a first innings leadI did not do anything specialjust kept bowling in the right areas, he told The Telegraph. 

Amit Singh was another impressive seamer for Gujarat. He gave the visitors the first breakthrough, castling Rohan Gavaskar. He made 74, and was involved in a 138-run stand with Laxmi to take the hosts close to the first-innings lead. Incidentally, Amit took all the three prize-scalps (opener Arindam Das, Gavaskar and then Shukla). 

With opener Azhar Bilakhia looking good on 63 and No. 3 Niraj Patel extending fine support, Gujarat finished the day at 119 for one.

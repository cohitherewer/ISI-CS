The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Eight events on New Years Day 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The New Years Day card has been stretched to eight events but the thoroughbred-strength, in races which matter, is poor considering the magnitude of the day, which attracts a massive crowd. The RCTC has, however, made elaborate arrangements to cater to the big crowd. The star attractions in Mondays card will be the Calcutta Sprinters Trophy and the Indian Produce Stakes. Romantic Fire and Steal The Glory are the live contenders in the respective events. The first race starts at 12 noon.

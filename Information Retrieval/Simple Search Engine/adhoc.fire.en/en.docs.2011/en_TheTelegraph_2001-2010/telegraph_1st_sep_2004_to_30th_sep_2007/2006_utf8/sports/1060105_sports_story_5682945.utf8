Melbourne: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis claimed her first seeded victim on her comeback trail when she reached the quarter finals of the Australian Hardcourt Championships on Wednesday. 

Swiss Hingis beat seventh seed Klara Koukalova 6-3, 6-2 and set up a quarter final with Nuria Llagostera Vives of Spain who upset second seed Francesca Schiavone of Italy 6-3, 6-1. 

Hingis, making a return to competitive tennis after retiring with foot and ankle injuries in 2002, is gaining in confidence and was too clinical for the world No. 35. 

We were both pretty flat towards the end. I just had more to give, said Hingis. 

At the third match point, I was like thank God it was over. The anticipation is coming back and every set Im shaking off the rustiness of the last few years. 

Hingis said her younger opponents did not know what to expect when they played her. They havent seen me around for three years and they dont know what to expect, said Hingis. Maybe thats one of the reasons and the other is they dont know me.

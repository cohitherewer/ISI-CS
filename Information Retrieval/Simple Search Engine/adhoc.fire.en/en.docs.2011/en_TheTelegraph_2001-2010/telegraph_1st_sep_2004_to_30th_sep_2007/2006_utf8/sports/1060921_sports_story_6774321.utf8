 Delhi Police may quiz Gibbs on Oct. 12, 14

Durban: South African opener Herschelle Gibbs is likely to be questioned by Delhi Police on October 12 and 14 about his alleged involvement in the 2000 match-fixing scandal. 

A spokesperson for the Western Province Cricket Board in Cape Town said Gibbs would apparently be questioned on October 12 and 14 about his role in the scandal. 

He also said that Gibbs, accompanied by his attorney, would leave for India only on October 11, seven days after his teams departure for the Champions Trophy. 

Gibbs wont be able to leave with the rest of the team because his attorney cant travel to India before October 11, he said. 

Gibbs would play for the Cape Cobras in their first three matches of the new domestic competition prior to the Champions trophy to be hosted at four venues in India from October 7 to November 5. 

Gibbs and spinner Nicky Boje, who has been left out of the Champions Trophy squad, are wanted by the Delhi Police in connection with the match-fixing scandal that came to light dur- ing South Africas tour of India in 2000-01. 

The right-handed batsman had opted out of the two previous tours of India apprehending arrest and questioning.

 Anand stays in hunt for 6th title

 - MAINZ CHESS 

 Anand 

 Mainz: World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand kept 

 himself in the reckoning for his sixth title on the trot, 

 winning the sixth game against Grandmaster Teimour Radjabov 

 of Azerbaijan in the Grenkeleasing World Rapid Championship 

 at the Mainz Classic chess here. 

With scores tied at 3-3 in the eight-game contest, the stage is set for a nail-biting finale, reminiscent of 2003 edition when the Indian came back from behind three times against worlds top-rated woman Judit Polgar to eventually take the match on the final day. 

Anand has so far played three games with white, scoring just one point while with black his performance has been much better in which he netted two points out of three games. 

It turned out to be a similar story in the other big match being played under chess960 rules in which the position of the pieces is shuffled just before the start of the game. 

After another engrossing day here, Russian GM Peter Svidler and Armenian challenger Levon Aronian remained tied at 3-3 score with just two games to one. 

The third day provided one victory each for the contestants of this chess960 world championship match. 

In the Ordix Open being played simultaneously, chess 960 junior champion P. Harikrishna showed tremendous fighting spirit to win all the five games of the opening day. Harikrishna gave a fine lesson to GM Sergey Erenburg of Israel to be among nine leaders. 

Anand knew he had to win the sixth game to remain in the match. 

Radjabov opted for a positional variation. As a result, Anand equalised comfortably and unleashed an attack on the white king, forcing Radjabov to enter a slightly inferior endgame after which it was a treat to watch Anand march his king side pawn to score a smashing victory in 46 moves. 

Earlier, Anand started the third day with scores tied at 2-2 and was hoping to do better with his white pieces. However, as the fifth game progressed, Radjabov got the dynamics rolling in his favour after employing the Sicilian Sveshnikov. 

Radjabov, to his credit, carried out his endgame plan to perfection after getting two passed pawns and Anand lost a piece for effectively no counter play. Interestingly, this game also lasted 46 moves.

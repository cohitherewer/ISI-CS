 Pathan back among top 5 allrounders

 Irfan Pathan 

Dubai: Indias famed bowler Irfan Pathans impressive batting display in the first one-dayer against Pakistan at Peshawar has once again lifted him to be among the top five ODI allrounders in the latest International Cricket Council (ICC) rankings. 

Pathan, who has been performing consistently with the bat, scored 65 to be the third best scorer for the side after Sachin Tendulkar (100) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (68), on Monday. 

Meanwhile, Australian speedster Brett Lee and wicketkeeper batsman Adam Gilchrist stole the top ODI positions from compatriots Glenn McGrath and Ricky Ponting in bowling and batting departments, respectively. 

Lee climbed to first position in the bowling rankings with the highest rating of his career owing to his success in the VB series. He is the leading wicket-taker with 15 wickets at the average of 19.40. 

He also stood the challenge of Shaun Pollock, who was the most economical bowler in the tri-series and has climbed up to second position. 

Gilchrist reclaimed the top spot after plundering 284 runs at a strike rate of 108.39. He is one of five Australian batsmen now in the top 10, along with Ponting (2nd), Andrew Symonds (7th), Mike Hussey (8th) and Michael Clarke (9th). 

Hussey is the newest member of this quintet, joining the top echelons of the table after only 29 ODIs. His 18-place rise over the course of this series on the back of 259 runs at 64.75, caps a tremendous week in which he was also named Australias ODI Player of the Year. 

Going into the final, Australia remain top of the LG-ICC ODI Championship table, while Sri Lanka are seventh. (PTI)

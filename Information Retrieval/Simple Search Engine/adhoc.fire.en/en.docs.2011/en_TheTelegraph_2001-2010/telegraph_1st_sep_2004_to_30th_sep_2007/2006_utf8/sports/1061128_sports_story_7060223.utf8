 Fifa allows Iran to play

 - DOHA SOCCER 

Dubai: Fifa has temporarily lifted its ban on Iran so they can take part in the Asian Games football competition after frantic behind-the-scenes manoeuvring. 

The ban has been provisionally lifted. The team can participate in the Asian Games, Fifa president Sepp Blatter said in Dubai. 

It followed what Blatter called alarming phone calls from Iranian authorities and the countrys ambassadors in Europe after Iran, the defending champions, were tossed out of the Doha Asian Games. 

We have agreed with Iran a route that needs to be respected. We have given them until December 5 to do so, he said without going into details. 

In the meantime, together with the Asian Football Confederation, we have agreed to make sure they can participate in the Asian Games. 

If they fully agree to our roadmap to normalisation of the situation, then we will lift the ban altogether. If the promises are not applied, then the ban will remain effective and it will affect the Asian Cup draw (on December 19). 

Fifa suspended Iran last week due to government interference in running the game and non-adherence to their statutes. 

Fifas emergency committee said Teheran had violated article 17 of the Fifa statute, which relates to the independence of national football associations free of any government interfer- ence. 

Iran will face India, Hong Kong and the Maldives in group D after the tournaments second round was redrawn on Monday. 

Irans return to the tournament is a blow for qualifier Iraq, who replaced their rival neighbours as the pool D seeds in Sundays original draw. Iraq will now contest pool E with China, Oman and Malaysia.

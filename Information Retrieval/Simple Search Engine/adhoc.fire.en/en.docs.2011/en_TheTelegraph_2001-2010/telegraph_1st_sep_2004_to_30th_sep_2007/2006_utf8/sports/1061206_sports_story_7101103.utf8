 Pak-Windies first ODI washed out

Rawalpindi: The first ODI between Pakistan and the West Indies was abandoned due to torrential rain on Tuesday. Umpires Daryl Harper and Aleem Dar called off the match after an early morning inspection of the ground and pitch, which was badly affected. 

Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif have not been included in Pakistans squad for the second one-dayer against the West Indies, despite being cleared of doping offences on Tuesday. 

Chief selector Wasim Bari said that the same squad which had been named for the first game, abandoned due to torrential rain, had been retained. As far as Shoaib and Asif are concerned, we dont know the details as yet from the cricket board about the lifting of their bans, he said. 

I will have to talk to the other selectors before we decide on when to consider them for selection. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq will be able to play the second game in Faisalabad after completing the four-match ban imposed on him by the ICC.

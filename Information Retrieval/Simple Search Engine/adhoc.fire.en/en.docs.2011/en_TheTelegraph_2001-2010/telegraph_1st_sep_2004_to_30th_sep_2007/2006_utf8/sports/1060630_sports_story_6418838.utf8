 Blatter remark riles England

Buhlertal: Piqued England players dismissed criticism on Thursday from Fifa chief Sepp Blatter for a lack of attacking football at the World Cup. 

Unimpressed by Englands 1-0 win over Ecuador to secure a quarter final with Portugal on Saturday, Blatter said: Im pleased that very attacking football is being played. 

The English are an exception, they played in the second round with one striker. Thats not the sort of attacking football you expect from a team that aspires to the title. 

The comments did not go down well with the England camp. David Beckham said: Its all about winning games. We do it in our way and (to) whoever doesnt like that, its up to us to just enjoy ourselves and win football matches. 

Experienced defender Gary Neville said: I dont listen to Sepp Blatter because I dont want to, because Ive got a World Cup quarter final and so have 21 other players on Saturday.

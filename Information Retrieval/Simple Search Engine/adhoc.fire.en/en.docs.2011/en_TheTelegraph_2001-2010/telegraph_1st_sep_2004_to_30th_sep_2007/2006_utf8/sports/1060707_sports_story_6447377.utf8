The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shadow-role for Srinath at Lords

 - Debut as Referee may be in Lanka 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former India quick Jawagal Srinath, the only rookie Match Referee on the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Elite Panel, will be Ranjan Madugalles shadow during the England versus Pakistan Test at Lords. 

The Test, which begins next Thursday, is going to be the first in a four-match series. Incidentally, Srinaths appointment to the panel, in April, had upset a section within the Pakistan Cricket Board. 

That, of course, had everything to do with the four Pakistani recommendations being spiked. 

Confirming a June 11 report in The Telegraph, that he would be trained by the Chief Match Referee, Srinath said on Thursday: Im leaving for London tomorrow? Ive been asked to function as Ranjans shadow in the first Test? 

An ex-Sri Lanka captain, Madugalle will be on duty for the first three Tests. Mike Procter takes over in the final one and is going to officiate in the five ODIs as well. 

Talking from Bangalore, Srinath added: Im looking forward to the experience? I should enjoy sitting in the box with Ranjan? 

He has already had a session with Doug Cowie, manager for the Match Referee and Elite umpires panel, and ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson. 

That was in Dubai, where the ICC is headquartered, in May. 

An announcement hasnt been made, but theres a chance that Srinath will make his debut in Sri Lanka later this month, when the South Africans arrive for a two-Test series. 

Srinath is a Tier-II Match Referee, a bracket which includes Clive Lloyd and Alan Hurst. Those in Tier-I (full-time) are: Madugalle, Procter, Jeff Crowe, Chris Broad and Roshan Mahanama. 

At 36, Srinath is the youngest on the panel.

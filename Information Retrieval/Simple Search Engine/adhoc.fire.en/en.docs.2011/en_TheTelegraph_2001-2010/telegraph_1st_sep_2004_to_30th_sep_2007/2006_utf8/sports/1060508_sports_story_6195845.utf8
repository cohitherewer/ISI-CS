 Eriksson ponders paucity of striking 

 talent

 - Alex Ferguson slams England coachs half-baked 

 idea with regard to Wayne Rooney 

 Eriksson 

London: Wayne Rooneys broken toe has exposed the paucity of striking talent available to England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson as he makes his final ponderings before naming a 27-man provisional World Cup squad on Monday. 

The Swede is likely to name Rooney in the squad and, depending on the state of the injury, will probably take him to Germany hoping the Manchester United man might be fit to make an impact in the knockout stages. 

Michael Owen, a proven tournament operator but also fighting to fully recover from a broken toe, will remain first choice for the starting team while Peter Crouch is also a certainty for the squad and could find himself in the 11. 

Eriksson may have taken five strikers anyway but will certainly need to if he plans to carry Rooney through the early stages. That means Jermain Defoe can expect the nod, despite struggling to make the Tottenham Hotspur first team. 

Charlton Athletics free-scoring Darren Bent should also get the chance to take his yeoman, but uninspired talents to the finals. 

Owen apart, none of those names are likely to strike fear into the cream of the worlds defenders and the fact that the likes of James Beattie, Emile Heskey and even Robbie Fowler have also been mentioned as possible inclusions shows just how little Eriksson has to choose from. 

The situation could force Eriksson to abandon his preferred 4-4-2 formation, play Owen as a lone striker and rely on his undeniably talented midfield resources to provide the goals. 

Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, David Beckham and Joe Cole are the current first choice quartet with Jermaine Jenas, Michael Carrick, Owen Hargreaves also probables for the trip. 

The question marks are over Erikssons choice of wide men. Shaun Wright-Phillips once appeared a sure bet but after a season when he has barely featured for Chelsea and seemingly lost his confidence, the coach may be having second thoughts. 

Middlesbroughs Stewart Downing has rediscovered his best form at the opportune time and can fill the troublesome space on the left while uncapped Tottenham teenager Aaron Lennon, riding a wave of media promotion, could slip in as the high-speed x-factor on the right. 

Among the defenders Sol Campbell should make t he trip, despite his troubles on and off the pitch in the last few months, while Ledley King, out of action with yet another metatarsal problem, will be keeping his fingers crossed. 

Eriksson has said he will know his first-choice 23 and that the extra four will be told that they are reserves. 

Alex Ferguson, meanwhile, has accused Eriksson of having a half-baked idea regarding Rooneys battle to be fit for the finals. 

The Manchester United manager fears his star striker could be pressured into playing before he is ready and called for a realistic approach from England. 

Ferguson is fearful that Rooney, who has been using an oxygen chamber this week in a bid to regain full fitness, could worsen his injury by trying to come back too quickly. 

Lets get it straight right now. For the sake of the boy himself and the rest of the England team, we at United will do everything possible to get him fit in time. But I am not going along with this half-baked idea of him going to Germany 80 per cent fit and then find him being pressured into playing before he is ready, Ferguson told a British tabloid.

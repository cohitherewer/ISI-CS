 BCCIs rejection

Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was on a collision course with the International Cricket Council (ICC) after it rejected a Members Participation Agreement (MPA) dealing with all tournaments to be held under the aegis of the games global body from 2007-08 till 2015. 

We have rejected the MPA in its present form and have formed a committee to go into it and suggest which are the minimum parameters we can agree upon, treasurer N Srinivasan said after the BCCIs 77th AGM Wednesday. 

Its a voluminous document and all our members felt at the AGM that there were several clauses about which we have reservations, he said. 

Asked which clauses the BCCI was objecting to, Srinivasan refused to spell them out saying they were many issues and not one or two to be singled out. (PTI)

 Czechs to rely on sniper Lokvenc

 - We can still get to the quarter finals, says Ghana captain 

Hattingen: Czech Republic face Ghana in their second Group E game on Saturday shorn of their two best strikers although they do have the luxury of the experienced Vratislav Lokvenc ready to plug the gap. 

Milan Baros is struggling with a mystery foot injury that might rule him out of the whole tournament, while Jan Koller is out until at least the second round after tearing a hamstring in the opening 3-0 win over the US. That means a start, probably as a lone striker, for 32-year-old Lokvenc, who has been in and around the team for more than 10 years, scoring 14 goals in 73 games and whose physical presence mirrors that of Koller, who he replaced after 45 minutes against the US. 

Like Koller, Lokvenc is easing back to full fitness after a knee injury that restricted him to a handful of appearances for his Austrian club Salzburg this season but he looked sharp enough against the US and also offers a similar aerial threat. 

Czech coach Karel Brueckner said he is unconcerned about the unexpected change of plans but will also be looking for plenty of attacking support from Tomas Rosicky, who scored twice on Monday, Pavel Nedved and Jaroslav Plasil, whose performance he raved about all week. 

We will not have the ideal line-up but there is strength in this squad, Brueckner said. 

Ghana, though, are not ruling themselves out just yet despite marking their World Cup debut with a 0-2 loss to Italy. 

Teams that lose the first match can still get to the quarter finals and go far, said captain Stephen Appiah. 

If Ghana are to progress in their first World Cup finals they will have to find much more in attack than they showed in their opener. The four-time African champions held their own in terms of possession but they barely mustered a worthwhile effort on goal. 

Coach Ratomir Dujkovic pointed to the eight goals they scored in three warm-up games against South Korea, Jamaica and Turkey.

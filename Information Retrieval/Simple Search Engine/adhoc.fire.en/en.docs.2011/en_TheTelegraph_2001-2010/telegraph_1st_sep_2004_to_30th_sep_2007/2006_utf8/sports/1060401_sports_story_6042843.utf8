The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anand, Morozevich finish joint first

 - Monaco Meet

 Anand played out two draws against Veselin Topalov in the final round and tied for the top spot 

Monaco: Viswanathan Anand played out two draws with world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria in the final round and tied for the top spot in the combined standings at the 15th Amber Blindfold and Rapid tournament here. 

Both Anand and Russian GM Alexander Morozevich finished with identical scores of 14.5 points from 22 games. 

For Anand, this was a fifth Amber victory while Morozevich took his third title. 

Third place went to Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain who finished with an impressive 12 points. 

Russian Alexander Grischuk was fourth overall with 11.5, while Topalov and Peter Leko of Hungary finished joint fifth in the euros 2,16,000 prize money meet. 

The rapid title went to Anand who finished with 8 points out of a possible 11, while Morozevich won the blindfold section (as reported in Fridays Late City edition) scoring an incredible 9.5 points. 

Having already won the rapid section with a round to spare, Anand played for a victory against Topalov and it turned out to be an exciting contest between the two best players of the world in the blindfold game. 

Topalov employed the Ruy Lopez as white and the heat was on early in the middle game when Anand went for complexities. 

While Topalov tried to make a foray on the king side, Anand was active enough on the other flank to do the damage. 

At one point in the game, it looked as though the Indian ace would prevail but Topalov came up with a spectacular exchange sacrifice. 

Soon it was obvious that the ensuing rook and pawns endgame would be equal and the peace was signed after 38 moves. 

The return rapid game provided no fireworks after Topalov sacrificed a pawn in a Ruy Lopez playing black. 

With black having sufficient compensation for the lost material, Anand took the draw after just 18 moves. 

Morozevich came up with yet another brilliant performance to down Van Wely who played the white side of a Kings Indian Defence. 

The Dutchman was all at sea when Morozevich started his trademark tactical initiations and the latter won in just 34 moves. The rapid game between the two ended in 32 moves.

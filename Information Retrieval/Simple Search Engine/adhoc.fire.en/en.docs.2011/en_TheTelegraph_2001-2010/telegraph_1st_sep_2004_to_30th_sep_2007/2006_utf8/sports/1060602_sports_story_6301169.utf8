 QUICKSCAN: Group B

 England

 Founded: 1863 

 Affiliated: 1905 40 years too long for England 

The first nation of football and the global distributor of the game, England are long on passion but short on actual prizes with their 1966 World Cup success on home soil still their only major tournament triumph. 

This tournament will mark the passing of four decades since Bobby Moore lifted the Jules Rimet trophy but England will travel to Germany among the favourites despite a qualifying campaign that, while largely comfortable, did provide a bump or two towards the end. After opening with a 2-2 draw in Austria, Sven-Goran Erikssons side won six games in succession before suffering an embarrassing 1-0 loss to Northern Ireland. 

Add a 1-4 friendly defeat in Denmark a month earlier and Englands credentials were suddenly open to question yet Erikssons team responded with home victories over Austria and Poland that secured them first place in group VI with a record of eight victories and just one defeat in ten matches. 

England have made 11 previous finals appearances, starting with their debut at Brazil 1950. Since the glory of 1966, however, the furthest they have travelled in the competition was to the semi-finals in 1990, where they lost on penalties to West Germany. Four years ago in Korea-Japan, they were losing quarter finalists for the fifth time, going down 1-2 to Brazil having taken the lead through a Michael Owen goal. 

Two years later they fell at the same hurdle at the Uefa European Championship in Portugal, beaten on penalties by the hosts, but found some consolation in the explosive form of the then 18-year-old Wayne Rooney, now fighting a foot injury in a desperate bid to make the finals. 

 The side boasts striker Owen and the midfield trio 

 of David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. In defence 

 England are strong with John Terry emerging as a genuine 

 contender for a central role alongside Rio Ferdinand or 

 Sol Campbell. At a glance

 Sweden

 Founded: 1904 

 Affiliated: 1904 Comfortable progression for Swedes 

 Sweden qualified for the World Cup as one of the two 

 best runners-up in European qualifying. They won eight of 

 their 10 group VIII matches and averaged exactly three goals 

 a game, conceding just four in return. The only blot on 

 their copybook was the pair of defeats by Croatia that meant 

 they had to settle for second place, despite finishing level 

 on 24 points with the team from the Balkans. 

Among the highlights of their qualifying campaign was the contribution of forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose seven goals included a four-goal haul in the 7-0 victory in Malta and a spectacular injury-time winner in Hungary. Fredrik Ljungberg also struck seven and Henrik Larsson four. This will be Swedens 11th Fifa World Cup. 

 Sweden retain some of the key personnel from their 

 last World Cup appearance with Olof Mellberg at the back, 

 Ljungberg breaking forward from midfield, and Larsson in 

 defence. That said, it is Ibrahimovic whom opponents fear 

 most.

 Paraguay

 Third time lucky for Paraguay? 

 Paraguay went down by the same 0-1 margin in the second 

 round of the last two World Cups, losing first to eventual 

 champions France and then to eventual runner-ups Germany. 

 At France 98, it took a golden goal from Laurent Blanc to 

 deny them, while four years later Germanys Oliver 

 Neuville did the damage with two minutes left on the clock. 

Although Paraguay only made sure of their third consecutive appearance at the World Cup on October 8 last year in Maracaibo, Venezuela, those in the know never doubted their ability to make it through. A total of 28 points was enough to see them repeat their fourth-placed finish of 2001 behind Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador. 

After reaching three of the first six World Cups, Paraguay went into a decline and missed out on six consecutive final tournaments. 

 When they finally emerged at Mexico 86, Julio Cesar 

 Romero and Roberto Cabanas steered the team through the 

 group stages, only to suffer a resounding 0-3 defeat at 

 the hands of England in the second round. With a wealth 

 of talent at their disposal Paraguay will be looking to 

 improve on 1998 and 2002. The big question now for them 

 is whether Germany will be third time lucky.

 World Cup Debut 

 Soca Warriors ride the rhythm 

 Just a few short months ago, you would have been hard 

 pushed to find anybody willing to gamble on Trinidad and 

 Tobago making it through to their first Fifa World Cup. 

 However, that did not stop this tiny Caribbean nation of 

 just 1.1 million people from overcoming the odds and the 

 weight of history to earn a well-deserved place at footballs 

 high table. 

A terrible start to the final qualifying stage saw Trinidad and Tobago pick up just one point from their first three matches and morale in the camp plummet to a new low. 

However, the arrival on Caribbean shores of experienced Dutch coach Leo Beenhakker, in place of Bertille St Clair, breathed new life into their campaign. 

They may have been the last team to book their place in Germany, but T amp;T are more than capable of ruffling a few feathers at the tournament. 

Qualification means that coach Beenhakker will be assured mythical status among the fans, and also give the countrys best ever player, Dwight Yorke, the chance to grace one World Cup before he retires. 

The same can be said of powerful forward Stern John and the immensely talented Russell Latapy, whose return to the side at 37 coincided with the teams upturn in form. 

 Given the abundance of talent at their disposal, any 

 team that dares to underestimate the Soca Warriors could 

 be in for a rather rude awakening.

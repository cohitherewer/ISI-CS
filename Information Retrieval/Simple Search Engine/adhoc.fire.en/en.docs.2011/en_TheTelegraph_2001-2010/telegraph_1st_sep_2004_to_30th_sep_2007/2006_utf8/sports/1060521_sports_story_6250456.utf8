 No comments, says Broad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 SAMUELS ACTION

 Kingston: No comments, 

 was Match Referee Chris Broads reaction when asked 

 whether Marlon Samuels action would be reported to 

 the International Cricket Council (ICC).

 Broad, who has been reporting 

 suspect actions every now and then, added: In any 

 case, why should it concern you (the Media)?

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, Broad and umpires Steve Bucknor, Asad Rauf and 

 Billy Doctrove analysed TV footage of Samuels 

 action on Friday.

 The ICC wont react unless 

 a bowler gets reported.

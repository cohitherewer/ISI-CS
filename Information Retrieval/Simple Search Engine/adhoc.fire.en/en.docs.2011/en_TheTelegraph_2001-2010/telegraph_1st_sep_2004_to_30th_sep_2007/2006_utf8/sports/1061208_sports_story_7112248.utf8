 Korean rider dies after fall 

Doha: South Korean eventer Kim Hyung-chil died after falling from his horse during the equestrian competition on a slippery course on Thursday at the Asian Games, becoming the first athlete to die in competition in the Games history. 

Kim, 47, fell from his horse on jump No. 8 on the cross country stage of the three-day eventing competition and was taken to hospital, Asian Games organising committee spokesman Ahmed Abdulla Al Khulaifi said. Kim was pronounced dead soon after arrival. 

Our prayers and thoughts are with the family of the deceased, Al Khulaifi said in Qatar. 

Im very sorry this tragic accident occurred, said Chung Hyung-sook, South Koreas team leader. I feel totally responsible and my heart is broken. 

Chung said South Korea was considering withdrawing from equestrianism out of respect to Kim. All competitors observed a moment of silence on Thursday shortly after his death. 

Kim, a silver medallist at home in the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, fell from his horse, which tumbled on top of him, causing severe trauma to his head, neck and upper chest, according to Abduluahab al-Museh, of the organising committees doping and medical staff. He said efforts to resuscitate and revive Kim failed at the scene. 

Kims horse, a 12-year-old gelding called Bundaberg Black, had no major injuries in the fall.

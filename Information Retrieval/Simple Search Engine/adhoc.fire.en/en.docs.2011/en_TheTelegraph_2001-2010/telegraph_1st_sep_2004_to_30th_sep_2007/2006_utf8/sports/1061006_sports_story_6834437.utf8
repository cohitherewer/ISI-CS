 Orthodox batsmen are rare today

 - No such thing as a permanent place in the team: Atapattu 

 Maravan Atapattu in Chandigarh on Thursday 

New Delhi: Sri Lankas star batsman Maravan Atapattu rues that the aggressive marketing of the game has pushed orthodox batsmanship close to extinction. 

It is coming to a stage where time is constantly shrinking, where there is no time for players like me, Atapattu said. In a team, you cant have 11 Jayasuriyas or 11 Sangakkaras. You have to have variety in batting. 

When you have batsmen of different calibre, it helps you to counter everything the opposition comes up with. It will make the opponent think twice. 

Atapattu is returning to the squad after an eight-month lay-off following a sciatic nerve surgery. 

The 35-year-old batsman said it was a career-threatening surgery but he chose to go ahead with it because he felt he had served Sri Lankan cricket to the best of his potential. 

They did the micro-disc hectomy. It is related to the sciatic nerves. They shaved the disc portion which was touching the nerves and giving me pain in the legs. 

It was a disc prolapse. It has been there from school days. It had come to a stage where I had to decide whether I want to play cricket or stay pain-free. I would have had no regrets if I had not been able to come back. I dont think I will be suffering if I am not playing now. 

It is no wonder then that Atapattu, who has scored 8233 runs in 253 one-dayers and 5330 in 88 Tests, has no problems playing under Mahela Jayawardene, nor does he feel threatened by the emergence of youngsters like Upul Tharanga. 

I think it was a privilege to watch the guys play in the last couple of series, he said. This is a good time to participate in the Champions Trophy. Things are going well for the team and the confidence is high. 

It is a challenge for all of us. There is no such hing as a permanent place in the team. As long as you are in the winning combination or the winning 15, that is what matters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzy confident of being cleared 

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq Sunday left for London to attend the International Cricket Council hearing, amid speculation that he may be cleared of ball-tampering charges but handed out some punishment for bringing the game into disrepute. 

Inzamam presented a straight bat to most of the queries thrown at him by reporters, but said he was keen to finish off the issue and concentrate on next months Champions Trophy in India. 

I cant make any comments on the hearing as I am bound by the ICC Code of Conduct. All I can say is I am reasonably confident we will be cleared of the ball-tampering charge, he said just before leaving for London via Dubai for the hearing on September 27 and 28. 

Inzamam was charged with tampering the ball and bringing the game into disrepute during The Oval Test against England last month. (PTI)

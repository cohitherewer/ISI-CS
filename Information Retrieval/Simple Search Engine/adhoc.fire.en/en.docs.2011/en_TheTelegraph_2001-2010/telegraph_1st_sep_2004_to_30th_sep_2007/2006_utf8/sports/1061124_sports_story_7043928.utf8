New Delhi: After a disastrous performance by East Bengal, the followers of the Calcutta teams had something to cheer about in the Durand Cup on Thursday when Mohun Bagan duly took their appointed place in the semi-finals with a 1-0 win over Air India in the concluding Group I encounter. 

The goal by Surajit Bose two minutes before the final whistle, in fact, threw out two Mumbai teams out of contention. While Air India left the capital without a point, Mahindra United also lost out in the bargain. 

Mahindra, who dug their own grave by losing to Sporting Clube de Goa in the days first match, had a chance of making the last four if their citymates managed to beat Mohun Bagan. But the victory took the Calcutta team to the top of the group with seven points, followed by Sporting (six points). 

While the Mohun Bagan officials looked a happy lot after the match, things could have been different. Air India, who rested half-a-dozen of their top players, including three foreigners, matched their fancied rivals move by move and could have snatched at least a point before the last minute goal saw Mohun Bagan through. 

Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, took no risk. I thought of resting Barreto, but changed my plans after Sporting beat Mahindra, said the Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya. 

It hardly helped. Barreto was off colour and was not receiving the right passes from his colleagues. In the ill-tempered match, that saw half-a-dozen yellow cards, Mohun Bagan looked a disjointed lot. While their junior footballers played their hearts out, the experienced ones were found wanting. 

A fine combination between two substitute footballers brought Mohun Bagan the goal when it was heading for a draw. Ayan Chowdhury, who was pushed in only five minutes before the final whistle in place of Barreto, sent a wonderful cross from the right to the goalmouth. Surojit Bose, who was following the move keenly, found the net with an accurate header. 

Bhattacharya later admitted that the juniors did a fine job under pressure situation. I am happy that they did well to hold on in the middle and fought it out, the coach said referring to players like Lalkamal Bhowmick, Manas Das and Bijoy Basfore. Barreto also said that he was happy with the performance of the juniors. 

The Mohun Bagan coach had a lot to complain against the referee. Some of my boys were shown yellow cards rather unnecessarily. The referee was not giving enough protection to our players. He himself, however, was lucky to escape punishment when he and the physical trainer rushed into the ground without prior permission from the referee to treat an injured Barreto. 

 TEAMS 

Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee; Bijoy Basfore, D. Ravanan, Eduardo Coelho and Manas Das; Lalkamal Bhowmick, Mehtab Hussain, Suman Dutta and Chinmoy Sarkar (Dulal Biswas 46th); Dipendu Biswas (Surojit Bose 46th) and Jose Barreto (Ayan Chowdhury 85th).

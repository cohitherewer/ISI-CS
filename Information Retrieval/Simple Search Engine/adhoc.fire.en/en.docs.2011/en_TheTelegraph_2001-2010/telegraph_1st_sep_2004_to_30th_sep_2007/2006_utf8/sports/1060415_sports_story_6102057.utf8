The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sehwag, Kaif not in shortlisted XIII

 - Flintoff should be back in place of Hoggard 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Andrew Flintoff and Duncan Fletcher in Indore on Friday 

Indore: The team management may describe it differently, but Mohammed Kaif has finally been dropped. He isnt in the XIII shortlisted for Saturdays seventh (and final) ODI against England, to be played at the MPCA Stadium. 

This year, Kaifs scores in ODIs have been a pathetic 8, 5 not out, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5 and 15. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, vice-captain Virender Sehwag is also out of contention. After failing yet again (in Jamshedpur, on Wednesday), hed himself said he would prefer a break. The XIII was announced during Friday evenings team meeting. 

The TVS Cup, of course, has already been won by India. At best, the visitors can make it 2-4. Last Sundays ODI in Guwahati had been abandoned without a ball being bowled. 

With both Sehwag and Kaif out, its almost certain (to the extent possible under the current dispensation) that opener Robin Uthappa will make his debut after a Bharat darshan of sorts for the past week. 

While Uthappa should fill one vacancy, the other is to be taken care of by captain Rahul Dravid, who was allowed to skip Guwahati and Jamshedpur. His comeback, incidentally, is in the Holkar stronghold where he was born 33 years ago. 

The past couple of days have been rather emotional for Dravid ? from meeting his maternal grandmother to being felicitated by the Marathi community and more ? but trust him to blank out everything except the job at hand. 

While nobody doubts Dravids ability to switch-on immediately, its to be seen whether his teammates show the same professionalism. To say the least, the Indians played and thought poorly in Jamshedpur. That allowed England, even minus Andrew Flintoff, to pull one back. 

Flintoff is returning and, one learns, the very unimpressive Matthew Hoggard is going to be dropped. If regular keeper Geraint Jones recovers from the injury in Kochi, then Vikram Solanki will probably be left out. 

Getting back to the Indians, there may well be a couple of changes in the bowling line-up as well. Irfan Pathan is expected to be back, as is Sreesanth ? its a mystery why he was rested in Jamshedpur. 

Its not confirmed, but Dravid and coach Greg Chappell could give Harbhajan Singh a break and drop Vikram Rajvir Singh. 

According to the captain, the offie didnt bowl at nets on match-eve owing to a niggle. Late in the evening, however, Harbhajan confirmed (via an SMS) that he was 200 per cent fit. Therefore, hes available for selection. 

 The concluding ODI, by the way, is going to be the first at the MPCA Stadium. The wicket looks good and, as the boundaries are small, there could be plenty of runs, remarked Dravid. The bigger test, it appears, will be battling the heat. 

Given that Indore hasnt hosted a one-dayer for five years, a full house is expected. Theres disappointment, though, that the selectors rested Mahendra Singh Dhoni. In India, today, theres no bigger draw than the dasher from Ranchi. 

Replacement Dinesh Karthik, obviously, is going to be bent on making a point or two ? one certainly directed at the security personnel, who mistook him for an imposter on Thursday. Its a limited comeback, after seven months, and it hasnt begun well. 

But, then...

 Change of guard 

Saturday will be Troy Cooleys last day as Englands bowling coach. An Australian, hes returning home to work with Cricket Australia. His successor, former Somerset coach Kevin Shine, has been settling down for the past few weeks. Interacting with the Media, he observed: The challenge is to improve all the bowlers, not anybody in particular...

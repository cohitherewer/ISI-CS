 Kingston: Chris Gayle, who has been bothered 

 by a heart problem, scored his first ODI century in almost 

 a year, but Rahul Dravid broke the West Indians hearts 

 with a character-dripping 105 (at more than a run a ball) 

 and gave Team India a 1-0 lead in the five-match Digicel 

 series.

 Thursdays ODI finished around 4.30 am (IST) 

 on Friday and the winning runs, from Mohammed Kaif, came 

 on the penultimate ball. Close finishes hurt a lot more, 

 but Brian Lara insisted that his team had the ammunition 

 for the next level. 

Four were needed in the last over, bowled by Dwayne Bravo. And, as the captain put it: India needed every ounce of energy to get there (252)... 

While the West Indies winning streak ended (theyd just whipped Zimbabwe 5-0), India took their record of successive successful chases to 17. Its mind-boggling, for not too long ago, many were happy to slap the label of chokers. 

 We played good cricket... 

 Thats as important as the win itself... Of course, 

 its nice to start well, whether its in the West 

 Indies or elsewhere, MoM Dravid, whose last ODI hundred 

 was 17 innings ago, told The Telegraph. 

Interacting briefly over breakfast at the Hilton, the captain added: Yes, it was nice to get a hundred... But, as Ive been saying, the processes are more important than milestones... We didnt start well, but pulled things back... Chasing 250-plus in a 45-over game is never easy... 

Incidentally, wife Vijeta and young Samit were at the Sabina Park, but they didnt wait till Dravid reached his 12th hundred. They saw him get past fifty, though. Right through the innings, he was cheered (bravo Dravid, bravo) by the handsome contingent of Indian fans, mostly from across the US. 

While Gayle was by far the biggest contributor (123 off 131 balls, his first ODI hundred on home turf) to the West Indies challenging total ? 251 for six ? Dravid found support from deputy Virender Sehwag and Kaif. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, greeted by a roar usually reserved for a centurion, authored a cameo. 

The opening stand was worth 56 and, then, the Dravid-Kaif pair added 123 for the third-wicket. Kaif struggled, which is why the match went the distance. The patchy bit was understandable as his highest in nine ODIs this year had been no more than 15. He had let-offs, but the scorecard will show an unbeaten 66. 

Earlier, Harbhajan Singh (9-2-33-1) and Ajit Agarkar (9-0-38-2) did a fantastic job after the first three bowlers had been belted. That only 29 were conceded in the last five overs made all the difference. 

Coach Greg Chappell didnt offer an excuse for the profligacy at the start, but did say that the players probably allowed themselves to expect no cricket after the early morning deluge. May be the start (delayed by just an hour) took us by surprise... We need to learn from that, he accepted. 

Chappell lauded Dravid, saying the captains batting had gone to another level. He added: Its better to start with a win, but it wouldnt have been terminal had we lost... The West Indies have forgotten to win... Had they been having little more success, they would have made it tougher... Having said that, the West Indies can always hurt and we arent underestimating them... 

Clearly, the hosts catching was poor and the ground fielding ought to have been far better. 

Meanwhile, one learns Match Referee Chris Broad (Jeff Crowe is going to be there during the Test series alone) and the umpires (Steve Bucknor, Asad Rauf and Billy Doctrove) will study Marlon Samuels action. 

 The 25-year-old, who bowls off-spin, appeared to throw 

 and the officials have taken note. According to a well-placed 

 source, TV footage has already been sought. 

 Sreesanth may play today

 Quick Sreesanth could play the second ODI, here itself, 

 on Saturday. Rudra Pratap Singh, who got tonked all over 

 the park, could have to sit out. However, its unlikely 

 that Ramesh Powar is going to be fielded. His right ankle 

 is no longer strapped, but the team management isnt 

 inclined to rush his comeback. 

 A light session had been planned at Sabina 

 Park, on Friday morning, but that got shelved because of 

 rain. There was, instead, a pool session at the Hilton. 

 LARASPEAK... 

 The following are excerpts from 

 what West Indies captain Brian Lara said after the first 

 ODI: 

We could have done better on occasions, but I dont agree that we cant handle pressure... Even though were at the bottom of the rankings of the big nations (at No. 8), I dont think our performance is getting the respect it should... That we only got 29 in the last five overs hurt us... One would expect around 40-45... Obviously, weve got to work more than India and we can take our game to the next level... The wicket dried up and, so, conditions for batting were better in the second session...

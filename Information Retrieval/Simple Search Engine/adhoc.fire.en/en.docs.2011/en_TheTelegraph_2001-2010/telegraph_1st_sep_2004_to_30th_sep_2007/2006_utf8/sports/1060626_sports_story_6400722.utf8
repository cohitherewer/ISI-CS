The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Refs strictly following Fifa guidelines

 Round one review

 Long Whistle

 Milan Dutta

 Passion, pressure and promise 

 ? the world has seen them all in the past fortnight. The 

 World Cup, true to its imposing effect and captivating charm, 

 has cast its spell on the humanity at large. The group stage 

 is now over and with it the ambitions and ebullience of 

 16 nations. 

 As many as 116 goals have been 

 scored so far in 48 group league matches. Fans have been 

 treated to some superb goals from Deco against Iran, Robin 

 van Persie against Ivory Coast, Joe Coles 30-yard 

 pile-driver against Sweden and Cambiassos famous one 

 that followed 24 passes against Serbia and Montenegro. 

 Amid all this, match officials 

 have played their roles in creating and maintaining the 

 free-flowing nature of the competition. The legendary Pele 

 has remarked that refereeing so far has been excellent. 

 However, according to Franz Beckenbauer, head of the World 

 Cup organising committee and himself a World Cup winner 

 both as player and coach, its not so satisfying. 

 Considering both schools of thought, 

 I strongly feel that the referees have been strictly following 

 Fifa guidelines and the Fifa Referees Committee is 

 happy with their performance. 

 The tournament has so far seen 

 18 red cards and it looks like breaking the record of 22 

 from 64 matches in the 1998 finals in France. 

 According to some experts, the 

 officials are booking players too frequently, thereby unnecessarily 

 slowing down the pace of the game. I beg to differ with 

 these critics. 

 In this World Cup, Fifa is committed 

 to come down on foul play and the referees are merely, but 

 strictly, following the instructions. They are physically 

 fitter, and therefore, can reach the desired position faster 

 than before. This is why I believe they have been largely 

 successful in cutting down on the number of fouls, pulling 

 the shirts, simulation and time-wasting. Fifa wants football 

 to be played in the middle, not fought out there. Im 

 pleased to note that the referees have been able to sound 

 the Fifas objectives loud and clear. 

 Just as an attacker or defender 

 commits a foul, a referee cannot but make mistakes. It has 

 to be seen whether such a mistake proves too costly for 

 a team or changes the outcome of a match. It nearly happened 

 in the Australia-Japan match. Japan took the lead in the 

 26th minute via a controversial goal by Nakamura, when the 

 Australian custodian was clearly obstructed by the rivals, 

 but the Egyptian referee Essam Abdel Fatah turned a blind 

 eye to the incident. Luckily, Australia won the match 3-1, 

 but the Egyptian official wasnt given any further 

 assignment. 

 On the other hand, the Japanese 

 referee Toru Kamikawas decision to allow Peter Crouchs 

 header into the box when the lanky English striker appeared 

 to have grabbed a Trinidad and Tobago players hair, 

 has also raised eyebrows. The second goal by Swiss striker 

 Alexender Frei against Korea was from an offside position.

 However, the experienced Graham 

 Polls blunder in the Croatia versus Australia match 

 is really baffling. The English official booked Croatia 

 defender Josip Simunic three times, after 62 and 90 minutes, 

 and finally in the 93rd minute, when he sent him off. Its 

 really difficult to understand why all the five officials 

 (from this World Cup, Fifa has appointed a stand-by referee, 

 too) couldnt detect the blunder when all of them were 

 equipped with ear phones. 

 But these are mere aberrations, 

 which, in no way, have overshadowed the otherwise hugely 

 professional and proficient work of the panel of referees.

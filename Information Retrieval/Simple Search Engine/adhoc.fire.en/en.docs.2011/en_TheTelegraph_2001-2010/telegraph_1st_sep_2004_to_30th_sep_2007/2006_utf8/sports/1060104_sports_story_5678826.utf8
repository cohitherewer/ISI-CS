 Pak to issue 10,000 visas 

New Delhi: The Government of Pakistan would issue 10,000 cricket visas for the fans from across the globe to enable them to watch the upcoming series against India, a top Pakistan cricket board official said on Tuesday. 

Eight-thousand visas will be issued (to Indian fans) and another 2,000 will be issued to fans who have purchased tickets through the internet from various countries, said PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan. 

There is lot of interest in the series but then there is only so much space in a stadium. We also have to look at facilities, comfort and security of the people who come to watch the matches, Shaharyar said. 

He clarified that cricket visas were non-police reporting visas. (PTI)

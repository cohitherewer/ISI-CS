 Supernatural Gordon Banks

London: Performer of perhaps the most famous save in football history, Gordon Banks forged a reputation for goalkeeping excellence during a lengthy international career with England. 

Though exceptional reflexes and startling agility were his hallmarks, Banks owed much of his success to a supernatural knack of being in the right place at the right time when duty called. 

And on the odd occasion when he wasnt, he was able to conjure up something miraculous, as he did in the tenth minute of Englands classic 1970 World Cup match with Brazil. 

A cross from Jairzinho was met by Pele, who directed a firm downward header towards the bottom corner of the goal. 

Pele, as legend has it, was already shouting goal! when Banks somehow flung himself at the ball, tipping it up and over for a corner. 

He came from nowhere, Pele recalled years later. It was, in my opinion, the most spectacular save of the tournament, an impossible play ? but Banks made it. 

Born in Sheffield, Banks first played for Chesterfield as a semi-professional before he joined Leicester City in 1959 for ?7,000. 

At Filbert Street, Banks class became immediately apparent, and he was instrumental in helping Leicester reach the 1961 FA Cup final, which they lost to Spurs. 

Banks again played a part in Leicesters run to the final of the 1963 FA Cup, pulling off a series of stunning saves to deny Liverpool in the semis. 

By then Banks was a fixture in the England set-up, and was a key member of the team which went on to win the 1966 World Cup on home soil. 

The victory was the highpoint of Banks career as a footballer, and England advanced to the final against West Germany having let in only one goal ? and that was a penalty. 

Banks record as an international goalkeeper is testimony to his class. In 73 appearances he kept 35 clean sheets and conceded only 57 goals, statistics that rightly rank him as one of the greatest keepers in football history. (AFP)

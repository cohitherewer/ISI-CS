 Randhawa, Shiv end joint 22nd

Gut Kaden (Germany): Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur turned in splendid final round scores to finish tied 22nd in the high-profile Deutsche Bank Players Championship of Europe. 

On the final day, Randhawa carded a flawless six-under 66, while Kapur shot a five-under 67 to move up from tied 50th and tied 46th, respectively. Both Indians totalled 12-under 276. 

Meanwhile, Swedens Robert Karlsson stamped his authority on the field, winning by four shots. His five-under 67 in the final round took his total to an awesome 25-under. 

It was Karlssons second win in two months after the Celtic Manor Wales Open. 

Randhawa, who has had a steady season without being spectacular, had six birdies and no bogeys in his final round. He birdied the first, third and eighth on the front nine and added three more on 10th, 15th and 18th. It brought him his best result since the tied 14th place at the Celtic Manor Wales Open in early June. The cheque of 37,980 euros also took his earnings to 285,041 euros and he is now 70th on the money list. 

Kapur, who had a bogey on the second, played excellent golf otherwise. It was his best since the three-week stretch when he was 12th at the Johnnie Walker Classic, 18th in the Malaysian Open and tied seventh in the Indonesia Open in January-February. (PTI)

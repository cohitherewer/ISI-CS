Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya was restrained in his hour of glory. He wanted to avoid any of the bitterness that had marked the past couple of months leading to the Cricket Association of Bengals (CABs) AGM. 

I am happy, but there is a sad tinge to it. Ive always said I didnt enjoy fighting this election. The chief minister had wanted me not to contest, but the members insisted that I fight. So I decided to contest, the CAB president said. 

Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had publicly asked Dalmiya to withdraw from the fray. Dalmiyas refusal and the subsequent failure of a truce effort set off a chain of dramatic events culminating in Souravs explosive e-mail. 

This is not just a win or loss? It can no longer be a question of who is winning or losing the elections, Dalmiya clarified, with Prasun Mukherjee standing next to him. 

Dalmiya has always said Mukherjee was a perfect gentleman, and added that the police commissioners deeds proved so. 

Both of us had vowed not to speak against each other before the election and I am glad it happened exactly that way. 

Mukherjee was gracious in defeat. This was a very close contest. I enjoyed every minute of it. This was a friendly fight. It is obvious that the majority wanted Dalmiya to continue. So he will stay as president. 

Mukherjee also had a congratulatory message for the observer, Justice (retd) Santosh Kumar Phoujdar. I am grateful to the observer for the way he conducted the elections. 

Mukherjee did not come up with any excuse. Nobody can complain about anything? I would have enjoyed winning, but overall it has been a good experience, he remarked. 

Joint secretaries Saradindu Pal and Amitava Banerjee felt there was no surprise element involved in their victories. 

 I was always confident I was going to win, 

 said Pal.

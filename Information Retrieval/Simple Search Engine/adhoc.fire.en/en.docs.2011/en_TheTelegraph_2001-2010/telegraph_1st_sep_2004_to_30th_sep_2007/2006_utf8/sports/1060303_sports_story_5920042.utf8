 Vaughan setback

London: Michael Vaughan will miss the Test series against India because of a knee injury and is also expected to miss the one-day series that follows, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Thursday. A specialist has advised Vaughan to rest completely for two weeks before beginning his rehabilitation. 

Michael has been ruled out of the current Test series. His knee will be re-assessed in due course but at this stage it is not anticipated that he will be fit for the one-day International series in India, the ECB said in a statement. (Reuters)

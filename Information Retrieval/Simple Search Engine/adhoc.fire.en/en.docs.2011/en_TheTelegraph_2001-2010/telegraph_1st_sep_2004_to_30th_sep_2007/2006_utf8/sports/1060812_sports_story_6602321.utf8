Calcutta: Its still not certain whether India will opt for a 20 or 23-member squad for Wednesdays AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia, but three players are set to face the axe from the group of 25, which is currently practising under Bob Houghton at the SAI Eastern Centre. 

It is more or less confirmed that Madhab Das (Mohammedan Sporting), Tarif Ahmed (East Bengal) and Abdul Bashir (SBT) will released when the final squad is selected on Saturday. 

Jo Paul Ancheri is also set to return home. It has been learnt that the British coach is keen on giving him another chance and in all likelihood, the veteran Keralite would be given a special fitness regime and will be asked to follow it during off-season. Chances of JCTs Sunil Chhetri and East Bengals Syed Rahim Nabi making the squad are also slim. 

On Friday morning, Houghton sat with his wards and dissected Saudi Arabias match against Tunisia in the World Cup. A part of his likely strategy against Saudi Arabia could well be gauged from the afternoon practice session on Friday. Crosses were sent in from both flanks for Bhaichung Bhutia and Manjit Singh. There was also a distinct focus on midfielders and defenders loping up and taking goalbound shots from the distance. 

Interestingly, East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting coaches, Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva and Subhas Bhowmick, paid a surprise visit to the SAI. Former India international and veteran coach P.K. Banerjee was present at the ground and shared a few minutes with Houghton. 

The coach discussed Saudi Arabias strengths and weaknesses with us. We all know they have played the World Cup and are formidable opponents. But weve got a chance to show our strength against them and we must be positive against them, Bhaichung said after the practice session. 

 Meanwhile, Houghton will have a one-on-one with nursery coaches at the IFA office on Saturday morning.

 Ferguson challenge for Beckham

 DERICK ALLSOP

Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has revived an old conflict by challenging David Beckham to carry the burden of responsibility that Wayne Rooney will be unfit to bear at the World Cup finals. 

Rooney has only a slender chance of playing any part, but Ferguson believes England should expect senior players to step into the breach. And, pointedly, he singled out Beckham, who left United in acrimonious circumstances three years ago. 

I think there was too much put on the boys shoulders and now the emphasis changes, Ferguson said. 

Step forward Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and David Beckham, because these guys are experienced and older. David, in particular. He has played in World Cups, hes the captain, hes played in a European Cup final. 

Ferguson voiced his dismay at the growing demands on Rooney long before the striker broke his foot. The United manager believes England have exceptional individual and collective resources, even without him. 

You cant say one player is going to decide everything for you, he reasoned. A young player can lack consistency. Therefore, older players have to step forward and I think England do have the players right through the side. 

Despite his recognition of the talent at Englands disposal, Ferguson suspects the unforgiving schedules of the club game in this country will undermine the national cause. 

The World Cup is about the preparation and Im not sure that English football is suited to a World Cup, Ferguson said. 

To go through an English season and think you can peak in the summer is very difficult.

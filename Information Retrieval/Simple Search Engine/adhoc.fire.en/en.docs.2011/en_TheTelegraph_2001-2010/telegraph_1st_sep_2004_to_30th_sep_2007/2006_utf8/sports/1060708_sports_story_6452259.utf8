 Randhawa 

Kildare (Ireland): Five birdies and a bogey saw Jyoti Randhawa off to a fine start with a four-under-par 68 in the first round at the Smurfit Kappa European Open at the K Club in Ireland on Thursday. 

Randhawa, a former Asian Tour No. 1 and has won five Asian Tour titles was three strokes off the leaders Bradley Dredge of Wales and Swede Niclas Fasth, at tied eighth place in the European Tour event. 

Indias other contender Jeev Milkha Singh, having one of the finest runs in his career, started with an eventful two-under par 70 for a tied 22nd place. He had five birdies but dropped three bogeys. 

Leaders Dredge and Fasth were one shot ahead of Argentinas Angel Cabrera and Paul Casey of England, with Stephen Dodd one of three players sharing fifth place on 67.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Drama spills to final day

 - No election for working committee slots 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Zero-hour is 

 approaching fast, but its still undecided whether 

 118 or 119 affiliated units will vote in Sundays Cricket 

 Association of Bengal (CAB) elections. 

The district judge of Alipore court on Saturday declined to pass an order on a plea made by Nirmal Mukherjee, who had been restrained from representing South Suburban Club at the annual general meeting. Mukherjee had filed a petition asking the judge to vacate Fridays order and allow him to be present at the meeting. 

Court-appointed observer Santosh Kumar Phoujdar will now have to decide if Debasish Ganguly ? who claims to be the general secretary of South Suburban ? should be allowed to represent the club and vote at the AGM. 

The papers reached me late this (Saturday) evening. I will go through those and convey my decision one hour before the meeting gets underway, Phoujdar said. The AGM is scheduled to start at 5 pm. 

The observer had earlier cancelled the nomination of Bata and Calcutta Rangers while scrutinising the forms. Both clubs were believed to be with the opposition. 

The acting district judge said on Saturday that Mukherjees petition would be heard on Monday. 

Despite this setback ? Mukherjee is known to be close to the ruling group ? Jagmohan Dalmiya was not short on confidence. He evaded a direct reply, though, when asked on his groups chances. 

You tell me? What do you feel? How do you rate the chances? Youre the best judge, the president told reporters. 

Is this the toughest election he has faced in his career? When I pen down my memoirs, youll know, he answered. 

Dalmiya said there was no need to pass any last-minute message to the voters. I dont think that is necessary. 

Despite the fierce campaigning, both groups have reached a consensus whereby the rotation policy for the working committee slots would continue. With 15 working committee candidates (out of 43) withdrawing on Saturday, there will be no elections for the 28 berths.We dont want to break convention if we get the mandate. It would set a bad precedent, reasoned Samar Paul, one of the candidates for joint-secretary from the Prasun Mukherjee group. 

Reiterating that he had the support of 75 members, Paul was confident he would succeed in winning on his eighth attempt. 

 Meanwhile, stringent security measures would be in 

 place in and around the Eden Gardens. DC (South) Ajay Kumar 

 will be in charge along with DC Special Branch Vinit Goyal 

 and Addl CP S.N. Sarkar.

 Isinbayeva vaults to gold

 - EUROPEAN CHAMPIONSHIPS 

 - Germanys Maisch claims womens marathon 

 Yelena Isinbayeva added the only title which was missing in her collection 

Gothenburg: Yelena Isinbayeva added the only gold medal missing from her collection as she won the womens pole vault at the European Championships. 

The world record holder from Russia is already the Olympic, world outdoor and indoor and European indoor champion, but the European outdoor title had eluded her. Until Saturday, that is. The Russian cleared 5.80 meters for a meet record in process. 

Marta Dominguez of Spain retained her 5,000m title in 14 minutes, 56.18 seconds. 

Ulrike Maisch of Germany stepped up the pace in the final two km to win the womens marathon. 

Maisch covered the course through wet and windy streets on Gothenburg in a personal best of 2 hours, 30 minutes, 1 second. 

Olivera Jevtic of Serbia won the silver 26 seconds behind and Irina Permitina of Russia took the bronze, 52 seconds off the winners pace. 

I still cannot believe that I won the gold medal, Maisch said. The rain was not as bad as I had feared it would be. Before the race I thought that the pace would be very fast, so I was set to run my own pace and race. I guess some of the runners that were leading were just overestimating themselves. 

Then, there was a moment when I was 11th and I kept overtaking the others... When I was first at 40 (km), I could not believe it. In my last round in the stadium I had tears in my eyes and was about to cry. 

Permitina had a slight, three-second lead over Maisch and a nine-second lead over Jevtic at 40 kilometers, but was passed as the runners approached the Ullevi stadium. 

It was tough, but not because of the rain, but the wind, Permitina said. 

I had the biggest crisis some 3 km before the finish line, there I began to slow down and the other two came. I was thinking that if I won now it would be a miracle. But on the other hand I am satisfied, it is my first medal ever. 

The three medallists were among a group of lead runners throughout the race. 

Jevtic was the top European finisher at the 2004 Athens Olympics when she placed sixth. She was third in the 2004 Boston Marathon and third at the 2002 New York Marathon but was disqualified after failing a drug test. 

She gave Serbia its first medal since its split this summer from Montenegro, the last remnant of the country once known as Yugoslavia. 

In the 110-meter hurdles, Frances world champion Ladji Doucoure failed to make the final. Doucoure struggled from the start and re-injured his ailing right calf. 

Natalia Khoronenko, the world indoor champion, upset Belarus countrywoman and world outdoor champion Nadezhda Ostapchuk to win the womens shot put by one centimetre. 

Khoronenko, a former European junior champion, won the title with her fourth heave, hitting 19.43m. Ostapchuk nearly caught up in the fifth, but fell short at 19.42.

 Jayasuriya recalled

Colombo: Sri Lankas veteran opener Sanath Jayasuriya has been recalled to the one-day International squad after proving his fitness to selectors. 

The 36-year-old Jayasuriya was originally omitted from the 16-man squad for the Triangular Series in Australia after aggravating a shoulder injury in a freak bathroom accident during Sri Lankas tour of New Zealand earlier this month. (Reuters)

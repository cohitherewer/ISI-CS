 Mahindra clinch maiden title

 - Defeat dashes East Bengal hopes 

 - 42-year-old first to win NFL as both player and couch 

 Dudu Omagbemi scored the third goal for Mahindra 

Margao: Mahindra United on Monday clinched their maiden National Football League (NFL) title after East Bengal lost to Sporting Club de Goa 1-3 at the Nehru Stadium here on Monday. 

East Bengals defeat meant Mahindra, with 32 points and three matches remaining, have an unbeatable four-point lead over their nearest rival who have one match to go. 

Even a win in their last match against JCT, and defeat in all the remaining three matches for Mahindra, will see the Calcutta outfit still fall short by one point. 

Sporting took their tally to 22 points from 14 matches. 

All the goals came in the first half, for the winners Edeh Chidi (12th), Hardeep Singh Saini (34th) and Dudu Omagbemi (36th), Bhaichung Bhutia reduced the margin for East Bengal in the 28th minute. 

Thus Mahindra United is the third team after Mohun Bagan and Dempo to achieve the distinction of winning the double crown ? Federation Cup and the NFL in same season. 

Hardeep Singh Saini was Man of the Match. 

Sporting sounded the first warning when Dudus angular drive hit the post after keeper Rajat Ghosh managed to get his hand to it. 

 Chidi put his team up in the 12th minute, Nicalau Borges from the right laid a pass to Chidi who dogged past two defenders and took a crack at the goal, the ball hit keeper Rajats legs and went into the net. 

East Bengal, who knew that they cannot afford to lose the match to keep their slim hope of a fight for the title, regrouped and found the equaliser in the 29th minute through Bhutia who uncorked an angular drive that beat keeper Luis Barreto to find the far post off Jayant Sen pass. 

But Sporting exploited the weak East Bengal defence as they found space to score two goals in a span of two minutes to kill the formers hopes. 

Hardips 30-yard shot off Chidi pass found the net in the 34th minute before Dudu headed in off a flag kick by Nicholas Rodrigues from the right. 

East Bengal have failed to do justice to their reputation this season. The change of coach midway through the season also did play a part in their performance. Bhaichung Bhutias solo effort had raised their hopes for a while but once he failed to come good, their chances evaporated. 

East Bengal will end the season without a single trophy in their kitty.

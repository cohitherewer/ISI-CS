 Kramnik, Topalov tie called off

 Topalov

Elista (Russia): A world chess championship game between Russias Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria was called off on Saturday in the backdrop of cheating allegations against the Russian. 

Kramnik, who was leading 3-1, was deemed to have forfeited the fifth game after not showing up for the match on Friday. 

Protesting against the decision, the Russian argued that the match should resume from Game V, while Topalov insisted he was now one point behind, and it was Game VI that should be played. 

Fide president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov initiated talks with the two sides but conceded that the scores remain the main obstacle. 

Both sides are ready to resume. But the score is the main obstacle, Ilyumzhinov said on Saturday.

The match is the sixth attempt to reunify the chess world after world champion Garry Kasparov broke away from the world chess federation, known as Fide, in 1993, over what he alleged was its officials indifference to the fate of chess. 

The row started when Topalovs manager accused Kramnik of taking too many bathroom breaks, implying that he was secretly using a technical device or a computer programme to help him with his moves. 

An appeals committee ruled that players private bathrooms be locked and the common bathroom be used instead. 

In an open letter to Ilyumzhinov, Kramnik protested the ruling and threatened to withdraw. He also accused Topalovs team of indulging in distracting gimmicks. (PTI)

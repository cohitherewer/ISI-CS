 Venus beats Hingis

Warsaw: Venus Williams hung on for a dramatic 4-6, 7-5, 6-4 victory over Martina Hingis on Thursday to reach the quarter finals of the Warsaw Cup. Venus, who has been taking medication for a throat infection, suffered cramps in the final set and could barely move at the end of only her third match this year which lasted two hours and 38 minutes.

 Marion Jones clocks 11.06

Mexico City: Former Olympic sprint queen Marion Jones ran the years second fastest 100 metres on her seasonal debut, clocking 11.06 seconds to defeat ex-world champion Torri Edwards at Veracruz, Mexico on Saturday. 

The race was the 30-year-old Americans first appearance in 11 months and produced her fastest time since 2004. 

Despite registering a morale-boosting victory, she crossed the line more than four-tenths of a second off her personal best of 10.65 seconds set in 1998. 

Edwards finished a distant second in 11.30 seconds although the sprinters did run into a headwind.

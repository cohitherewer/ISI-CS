 Indians target more Olympic berths 

Zagreb: Abhinav Bindra and Samresh Jung will be hot contenders as Indian shooters target the bulls eye to clinch more berths for the 2008 Olympic Games when they launch their campaign at the 49th World Championships here Sunday. 

Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, who recovered his gun a fortnight after it was misplaced by an airlines on his flight back from Cairo, will use the same Perazzi DB indicating it was in shape. 

The Olympic silver medallist, who underwent a training stint in Italy ahead of the event, would look to improve on his bronze medal feat in last edition held in 2003 in Cyprus. He had scored 189 (141+48). 

For the 44-member Indian contingent, which already boasts of four Olympic qualifiers ? air rifle shooters Gagan Narang and Anjali Bhagwat, Rathore in double trap and Manavjit Singh in trap ? will look to earn at least two more tickets to Beijing. 

Air rifle and air pistol events will have a better chance of bagging the spots with five places each up for grabs while skeet and trap events have three berths each giving shooters their last chance this year to qualify for the Olympics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Grischuk best, Anand fourth

 BLITZ CHESS

 Rishon Le Zion (Israel): Viswanathan 

 Anand finished a distant fourth in the World Blitz Chess 

 Championship which was won by Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk 

 of Russia here.

 The Russian won the tiebreak game 

 against compatriot Peter Svidler to pocket the coveted title.

 After a gruelling 15 rounds, both 

 Grischuk and Svidler tallied an identical 10.5 points, and 

 in the ensuing tiebreaker, the former proved superior with 

 his white pieces.

 Scoring 10 points in all, Anand 

 tied for the third spot along with Azerbaijans Teimour 

 Radjabov but finished fourth overall with his slightly inferior 

 tiebreak.

 The $92,500 event was played on 

 a round-robin basis between 16 players with four minutes 

 being allotted to both players and a two-second increment 

 after every move.

 Anand had a brilliant start with 

 two victories, including one against Svidler. However, the 

 Indian ace missed the thread in the final stages of the 

 event.

 Before the last round, Anand, 

 Radjabov, Svidler and Grischuk were in joint lead on 9.5 

 points but the final round saw Anand only managing a draw 

 against Boris Gelfand while Radjabov achieved the same result 

 against Etienne Bacrot of France.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chisty eyes two trophies 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: C.Alford, who enjoys a nine-point lead at the jockeys championship table, is out to strengthen his position at the top. He faces a serious threat from Imran Chisty whose last weeks five wins have delivered a warning.

 Still, it may pay to follow Chisty in Wednesdays six-event card. The jockey is in a position to pick and choose from trainers Errol Bhungard and Daniel Davids huge stables, offering a variety of horses to counter the opposition. Particularly, in the two trophy events ? the Wind Song Cup and the Snow Forest Cup ? Chistys Mr Darcy and Cheryl are the ideally handicapped horses. They are expected to win their respective events. 

 Romantic Escape and Flemenco Star, on the other hand, may help Alfords cause.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

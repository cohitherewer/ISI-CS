The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dudu boost for Sporting vs Mahindra

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Christmas Day coincided with the eve of the first Federation Cup semi-final. No wonder, both Mahindra United and Sporting Clube de Goa skipped practice and switched on the festive mode. 

You can enjoy the way you like, but you guys have to assure me of winning the match, was Sporting coach Clifford Chukuwamas appeal to his players on Monday. 

Sporting will buoyed by the return of Dudu Omagbemi, who missed the first two matches because of the red card he was shown in the IFA Shield semi-final. Dudu should be joined by Ernest Jeremiah up front. 

Defending champions Mahindra United will also be boosted by the return of Mahesh Gawli and Shammugam Venkatesh after having recovered from injuries. 

Mahindra, who drew with Sporting in the IFA Shield, will be hoping to show they are the best team in the coubtry. Theyll be striving to play attacking football and have all the ammunition to come up trumps.

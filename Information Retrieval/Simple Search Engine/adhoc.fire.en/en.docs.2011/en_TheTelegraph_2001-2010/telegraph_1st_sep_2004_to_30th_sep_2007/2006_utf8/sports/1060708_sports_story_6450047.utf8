 Chief selector snaps at Lara

Port-of-Spain: West Indies chief selector Joey Carew has hit back at captain Brian Lara for his unnecessary remarks on pitches and selection just after the conclusion of the four-Test series against India. 

They (remarks) were unnecessary. He should have addressed his concerns to the (West Indies) board and now he will have to answer to them for those statements, Carew, convenor of the selection panel, was quoted as saying in a daily Friday. 

Asked if Laras comments were justified in some way, he said, since Im involved in the matter, I would rather not comment on it and leave the decision on how to proceed from here up to the WICB. 

Lara had complained about team selection and the state of pitches dished out during the series after West Indies lost the fourth and final Test to India in Kingston to concede the rubber 1-0. 

Meanwhile organisers of World Cup 2007 will take part in a promotional event in New Delhi later this month. Chris Dehring, director and CEO of World Cup West Indies 2007 Inc., and other executives of the committee will participate in a brand promotion event on July 27.

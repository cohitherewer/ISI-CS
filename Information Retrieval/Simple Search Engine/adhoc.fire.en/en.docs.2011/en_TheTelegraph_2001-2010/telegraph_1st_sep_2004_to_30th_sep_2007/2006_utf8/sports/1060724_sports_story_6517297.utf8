 India juniors grab bronze 

Zagreb: Indian junior men did the country proud by winning the bronze medal in the 10m air pistol team event at the ISSF World Shooting Championship here on Sunday. 

India tallied 1716 points with Amanpreet Jhaam finishing with 575 points while Bapu Vanjare and Zakir Khan shot 571 and 570, respectively. 

China won the gold with 1726 points while Russia finished second with 1717. 

However, the story was not so happy for the seniors as Samresh Jung, hero of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, finished a poor 31st in the event, tallying 576 points. Vivek Singh finished in 44th place while Ronak Pandit was 98th. 

The poor scores meant India finished 14th in the event with an aggregate of 1717 points. (Pti)

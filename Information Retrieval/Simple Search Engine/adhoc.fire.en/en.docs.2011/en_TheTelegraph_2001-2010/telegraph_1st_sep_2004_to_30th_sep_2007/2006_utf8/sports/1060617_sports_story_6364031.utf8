 Nadal retires with injury

London: Rafael Nadal became a victim of his own success on Friday when a shoulder injury spoiled his preparations for Wimbledon. 

The double French Open champion had to retire at 6-3, 3-6 against Lleyton Hewitt in the quarter finals of the Stella Artois grasscourt event due to pain in his left shoulder. 

The left-hander Nadal opted to quit rather than damage his serving arm further. He will undergo treatment in Mallorca in a bid to be ready for the Wimbledon Championships which start in 10 days time. 

In Halle, Roger Federer saved four match-points before edging past Belgian Olivier Rochus 6-7, 7-6, 7-6 to reach the semis on Friday. 

The Swiss world No. 1, unbeaten on grass since losing to Mario Ancic in the first round of Wimbledon in 2002, was given a real fright before he secured his 39th consecutive win on turf. (Reuters)

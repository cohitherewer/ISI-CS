 Michel Platini, the midfield artist

 Michel Platini

Paris: Over the course of a career that included three World Cups, Michel Platinis midfield artistry earned him the right to be regarded as the finest French footballer of all time. 

Beautifully balanced, Platinis principal weapons in a formidable arsenal were wonderful awareness, a laser-guided passing ability and an unfailing accuracy from free-kicks. 

Born in 1955, the grandson of Italian immigrants, he had schoolboy trials with Metz, where he was rejected for not being strong enough, before being snapped up by the clubs rivals Nancy. 

He made his first international appearance in 1976, scoring on his debut against Czechoslovakia and cementing his place in the French team for the World Cup two years later. 

Though giving flashes of class, Platini struggled to truly give full vent to his talents as France exited in the first phase after losing their two opening matches, against Italy (2-1) and hosts Argentina by the same score. 

Marked into anonymity by the Italians, Platini had more success against Argentina. He scored his first World Cup goal to equalise, and twice created clear chances for Didier Six, who missed each opportunity. 

With pride restored in a 3-1 consolation win over Hungary, Platini returned to France and the following year transferred from Nancy to Saint Etienne, having scored 98 goals in seven seasons. 

Playing for St Etienne, Platini flourished and had firmly established himself as French footballs most exciting talent by the time of the 1982 World Cup. 

Platini excelled in Spain as France started slowly before gathering momentum and reaching the semi-finals, where they were to lose to West Germany penalties after thrilling 3-3 draw. 

Despite the bitter disappointment of that defeat, Platini departed as Man of the Match and one of the players of the tournament, the leading light in a wonderful midfield which also featured Jean Tigana and Alain Giresse. 

Following the World Cup, Platini was transferred for $1.7 million from St Etienne to Juventus, where the Frenchman was to inspire the Italians to three league titles in four seasons. 

His spell at Juventus also saw him recognised as European Footballer of the Year. 

Two years after his move to Turin, Platini enjoyed the highpoint of his international career, inspirationally captaining France to victory in 1984 European Championship. 

At the peak of his powers, Platini scored nine goals in five matches in the tournament, lifting him past Juste Fontaine as Frances all-time leading scorer. 

At the 1986 Mexico World Cup, Platinis performances again helped make France the favoured side of most neutrals. In a thrilling quarter final against Brazil, Platini scored and missed in the penalty shoot-out before the French advanced to the semi-finals. 

There was to be no World Cup coronation for the King of French football: Platini and France were beaten 0-2 in the last four by West Germany in a repeat of their 1982 meeting. 

In 1987, Platini bade farewell to football with a performance for the Rest of the World against an English football league side at Wembley, retiring with 72 caps and 41 goals. 

After Frances failure to qualify for the 1990 World Cup, Platini returned as coach of the national side, leading France to the 1992 European Championship finals, where they were eliminated in the first phase.

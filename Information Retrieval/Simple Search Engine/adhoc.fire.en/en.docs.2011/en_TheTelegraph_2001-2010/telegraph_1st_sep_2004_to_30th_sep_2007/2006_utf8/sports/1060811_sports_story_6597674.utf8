Bangalore: Team India captain Rahul Dravid feels it would be a challenge to integrate the Twenty20 format in domestic cricket. 

Twenty20 match at international level is always going to be a success. Fifty50 (one-day Internationals) was a success. Thats not the challenge. The challenge is to see that its a success in domestic form as well... How its going to be done... Whats the way forward. I think, its going to be trial and error (method), Dravid said here on Thursday. 

Twenty20 is ideally suited for England, where its played in the evening (between 5 pm and 9 pm), because of the nature of the game. Its a brilliant game for England. 

In India, one has to learn and experience how it works in domestic cricket. At this stage, one cant say for sure this is the way it will work. 

In 3-4 years, one might come up with a formula or format (for Twenty20) that would be suitable for sponsors and players, added Dravid at a press conference to announce the second edition of Twenty20 cricket tournament for the Bradman Cup that gets underway here on Friday. 

In spite of the popularity of one-dayers and Twenty20, Test cricket would hold its own, feels Dravid.

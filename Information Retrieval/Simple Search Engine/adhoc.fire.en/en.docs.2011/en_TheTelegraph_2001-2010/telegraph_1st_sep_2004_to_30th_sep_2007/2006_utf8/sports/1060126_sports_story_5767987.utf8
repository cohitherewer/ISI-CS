Calcutta: Beauty is momentary. But with Bhaichung Bhutia, it leaves a lasting impact on our soul. If the 10th edition of the National Football League (for the ONGC Cup) heralded a new beginning in Indian football with top-notch television coverage, a strong financial belly and colourful cheer leaders, the Indian captain has already presented himself ? inside his fourth match of the competition ? as the true representative of all the beauty and excitement associated with it. 

Theres no surprise then that East Bengals 2-0 victory over Fransa Pax at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday was but a sublime study of Bhaichung and his bold and beautiful approach to the game. Mike Okoro drew the first blood, heading in a Guy Ndem cross in the eighth minute, and then, Bhaichung added the much-needed spice to East Bengals absolute domination with a scintillating finish, eight minutes from final whistle. 

A brilliant solo sprint from his own box to the other end leaving the opposition stranded in shock and awe, an intelligent first-touch flick off a Okoro pass, his supply of innumerable balls for his teammates, which they squandered like profligates, and above all, that stomping around the park with the king-like authority ? you would simply end up searching for adjectives in describing the 28-year-old. 

His goal was a case in point. Having received the ball around Fransas half-line, his sudden upward thrust caught the rival backline off guard. Coming to the top-box, he first steered clear of central defender Marcus Peixotos challenge, and then bamboozled side-back Creson Antao to his left and right with a deft footwork. The space was now open for Bhaichung to deliver the killer punch. Simply breathtaking. 

Seeing MoM Bhaichung going for everything was enough to inspire the entire team. Though Okoro is yet to be match fit, Ndem in midfield and his Cameroon mate Ngassa Martial in defence are steadily improving. 

On the flip side, though, there was a tendency to commit too many fouls around the top-box and the degeneration of Sasthi Duley from the attacking midfielder to a party-pooper (he missed a mother of a chance when Bhaichung sold a dummy off a Shylo Malsawmtluanga pass). But this is not the time to pin-point grey areas. Its time rather to hail Bhaichung in his old form. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal are now on eight points following their win, while Fransa remain on two.

 Klinsmann in final shortlist

 - SEARCH FOR US COACH 

 Juergen Klinsmann 

New York: The US Soccer Federation (USSF) confirmed its interest in Juergen Klinsmann and said it has narrowed its search for a national team coach down to five finalists. 

Klinsmann, who coached Germany to the World Cup semi-finals this year, last week said he had started talks with USSF president Sunil Gulati. During a telephone conference call on Tuesday, Gulati was full of praise for Klinsmann. 

Eighteen months ago or two years ago, obviously the German Federation saw something very special in Juergen, Gulati said. He hadnt coached until then and they asked him to guide the national team. He was very successful. 

Gulati said he started with an initial pool of 13. He did not identify any finalists but said the USSF had not asked for permission to speak to Russia coach Guus Hiddink or Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. 

Klinsmann, a star for Germany during the 1990, 1994 and 1998 World Cups, was hired in July 2004 by Germanys soccer federation, the Deutsche Fussball-Bund (DFB). It was Klinsmanns first professional coaching job. 

The DFB looked at a terrific player, a terrific personality, a great leader and said, this is the way we want to go, Gulati said. Franz Beckenbauer, when he coached the German national squad, didnt have a lot of coaching experience. 

Klinsmann lives in suburban Los Angeles and is regarded by many as the favourite to replace Bruce Arena, who was hired as the American coach in late 1998. 

Arena led the US team to the World Cup quarter finals in 2002, its best performance since 1930, but the Americans were eliminated from a tough first-round group this year.

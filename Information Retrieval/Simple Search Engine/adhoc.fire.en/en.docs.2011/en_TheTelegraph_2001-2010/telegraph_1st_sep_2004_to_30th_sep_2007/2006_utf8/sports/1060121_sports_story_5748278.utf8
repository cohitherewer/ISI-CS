 UP skittle out Mumbai for 199

Mumbai: Uttar Pradesh enjoyed an early advantage after former champions Mumbai collapsed in dramatic fashion in their first innings on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semi-finals at the Wankhede Stadium here on Friday. 

At close, Uttar Pradesh were four for no loss after restricting Mumbai to 199, six overs before stumps were drawn. Openers Jyoti Yadav was unbeaten on one and Shivakant Shukla was batting on two. 

After losing the toss, Uttar Pradesh skipper Mohd. Kaif set an attacking field that had Mumbai under pressure from the start. 

As medium pacer Praveen Kumar trapped opener Vinayak Samant leg before in his first ball in the second over of the innings, Mumbai never recovered from the early setback and lost wickets at regular intervals. 

Kumar was rewarded with four wickets, Salabh Srivastava bagged three, and Piyush Chawla scalped two to give up the edge. Mumbai opener Sahil Kukreja defied the UP bowlers with a patient 49 and Ramesh Powar tried to take away the advantage before he was caught for 29, before a 46-run partnership for the last wicket between Swapnil Hazare and Avishkar Salvi rescued the hosts from further humiliation. 

BRIEF SCORES: Mumbai 199 (S. Kukreja 49; P. Kumar 4/32, S. Srivastava 3/40). Uttar Pradesh 4/0. (PTI)

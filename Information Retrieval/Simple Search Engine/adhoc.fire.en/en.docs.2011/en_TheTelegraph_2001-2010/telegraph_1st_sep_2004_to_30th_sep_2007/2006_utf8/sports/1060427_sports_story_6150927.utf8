Fatullah: Andrew Symonds smashed an unbeaten 103 on Wednesday to take Australia to a 67-run victory over Bangladesh and a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match one-day series. 

Chasing a victory target of 251 runs, Bangladesh were crushed for 183 from 48 overs with captain Habibul Bashar top-scoring with 70. The hosts were always struggling after openers Shahriar Nafees and Rajin Saleh went home without scoring. 

Allrounder Symonds completed his fifth one-day century, adding 140 for the fourth wicket with Michael Clarke (54). 

Man of the Match Symonds expressed his satisfaction at his performance, saying: It was very important innings in the context of the game. 

Australia defeated Bangladesh by four wickets in the first match in Chittagong on Sunday. The third and final match of the series will be played in Fatullah on Friday. 

It is always nice to win a series, Australia captain Ricky Ponting told reporters. We had a lot of pressure in both games. Andrew and Clarke played well in a tough situation. 

Left arm spinner Brad Hogg took three for 34, while pacemen Brett Lee, Nathan Barcken and part-time spinner Michael Clarke shared two wicket each. 

Bashar, who was dropped by Mitchell Johnson at third man on 62 off Lee, hit six boundaries from 114 balls before he was caught by Michael Hussey at mid-wicket off Clarke. 

Khaled Mashud (36) and Javed Omar (34) were the other important contributors for Bangladesh. Omar hit five boundaries from 56 deliveries. 

Left-arm pace bowler Bracken bowled Tushar Imran for two then removed Saleh who was caught behind by Adam Gilchrist. 

Pace bowler Mashrafee Mortaza dismissed the first three Australian batsmen before he was forced to withdraw from the attack after injuring his leg with the first ball of his 10th over. Mortaza finished with three for 54 with 9.1 overs. 

We were on the back foot loosing three quick wickets at the very onset, Bashar said. 

Symonds, who was dropped on 34 by Alok Kapali, scored his runs off 125 balls, hitting two huge sixes and six boundaries. 

Australia, who had won the toss and elected to bat, started well before Mortaza drew first blood by trapping Gilchrist lbw for 32 in his fifth over with the score on 55. 

In his next over, Mortaza bowled Ponting for five and then removed Simon Katich for 26, caught in the covers by Nafees. 

Clarke then helped steady the innings with Symonds, notching his 17th half-century in an knock spanning 90 balls that included two fours.

Gros Islet: Captain Rahul Dravid struck his 23rd century as India consolidated their advantage in the second Test against the West Indies here Sunday. 

 India were 584 for seven at tea on Day II. Mohammed 

 Kaifs maiden hundred made him the third centurion 

 of the innings. He was batting on 145 at the break along 

 with Anil Kumble (13). 

Dravid hit a well-paced 146, and with support from Mohammed Kaif (89 batting), put India in the box seat at 485 for five in the first innings at lunch on the second day. 

The skipper, unbeaten on 95 overnight, increased the tempo and paved the way for a mammoth Indian total before falling while chasing a rank outside delivery from part-time spinner Ramnaresh Sarwan just before the interval. 

Dravids runs came from 234 balls and contained 16 fours. He put on 179 runs with Kaif for the fifth wicket. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni was the other unbeaten batsman, yet to open his account. 

India, starting the day at 361 for 4, added 124 runs from the morning session of 29 overs. Kaif has so far batted for 152 balls and smashed nine boundaries. 

Neither the second new ball nor changes in the bowling was of much use to the home team. 

The second new ball was claimed in the second over and Dravid reached his landmark only in the fourth when he pulled Jerome Taylor for two runs. He also executed the first boundary of the morning when he flicked Corey Collymore to the square leg boundary. 

Thereafter it was Kaif who hit more fours and did the bulk of the scoring. He began with a pull off Taylor and then straight drove Collymore. 

Taylor was at the receiving end again, and when Pedro Collins and Chris Gayle appeared for the first time on the day, he cover drove and flicked them for boundaries. 

The 400 was brought up in the 95th over and the century stand between the two also didnt take long in coming. It took the two marauding batsmen only 159 balls. 

Kaifs fourth half-century was in fortuitous circumstances because of four overthrows. He had pushed the ball in the covers and took off for a single and the fielder, in his anxiety, threw a sharp return which eluded all and crossed the midwicket fence.

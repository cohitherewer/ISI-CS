 Gonzalez stumbles 

into Round II

Basel: Defending champion Fernando Gonzalez came through an unexpectedly tough Swiss Open first round meeting on Wednesday before eventually seeing off Italian world No. 124 Simone Bolelli 7-6, 6-7, 7-6. 

Normally considered one of the sports hardest hitters, third seed Gonzalez looked vulnerable from the start, calling for on-court treatment on an apparent leg injury three games into the match and having to defend breakpoints in two of his first three service games. 

Failing to make any inroads on his opponents powerful serve, Gonzalez then fell a mini-break down in the tie-break but clawed his way back after some untimely Bolelli errors to clinch the opening set. 

Bolelli, a 21-year-old still seeking his first win on the ATP circuit, refused to buckle and showed more nerve in the second tie-break winning another early break and pressing his advantage to seal it 7-2. 

Chilean Gonzalez regained the upper hand but was repeatedly unable to finish off Bolelli who successfully defended four break points to force a final tie-break. 

The young Italian came forward on his first two service points and was twice passed to give Gonzalez a 4-0 lead. 

After more than two and a quarter hours on court, the Chilean finally wrapped up the tiebreak 7-3 to set up a second round meeting with American Mardy Fish. 

Argentine seventh seed Jose Acasuso made much lighter work of his first round match, beating Spains Albert Montanes 6-4, 6-3. 

Acasusos compatriot and ninth seed David Chela also came through with a 6-4, 7-5 win over top Italian Filippo Volandri.

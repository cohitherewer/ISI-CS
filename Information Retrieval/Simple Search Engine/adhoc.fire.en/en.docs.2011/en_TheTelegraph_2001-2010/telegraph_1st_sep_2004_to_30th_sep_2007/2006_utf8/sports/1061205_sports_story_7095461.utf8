 Ranadeb: I didnt try anything extra

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: If there was a Man-of-the-Match award, it would have been tough to choose between Manoj Tewari and Ranadeb Bose. If Tewaris unbeaten 210 put Mumbai under pressure, Ranadebs five wickets ensured two points even on this docile wicket. 

Ranadeb tried to be modest. My job as a pacer is to pick wickets. I am included in the team for that My job was to bowl an off-stump line and give 100 per cent effort for every ball. 

I did not try anything extra. That my rhythm was good for the last two days made things a bit easier, he explained. 

Ranadeb dedicated his effort to the team and did not forget to mention Paras Mhambrey. To have a fast bowler as coach certainly has its advantages. He can take care of both the technical and mental aspects. Psychologically, he can be a big boost, giving you the right advice in times of crisis He can also help with situation-based planning. 

Paras also praised Ranadeb. Im very proud of his effort. He was excellent in these conditions. He showed a big heart. He has worked hard on his fitness and game. Not just me, the entire support system has played a role in his success. 

Deep accepted the toss played a role in their achieving the first-innings lead. He also said the team management would think about the wicket before their next match against Andhra Pradesh. 

Amol Muzumdar said he would take up the issue of such placid wickets during the captains meet at the end of the season. For the record, the BCCI didnt have one last season.

 Everything is not about ranking or points: Sania 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sania Mirza

Calcutta: Sania Mirza struggled to defeat Sandra Kloesel 7-5, 6-3 in the second round of the Sunfeast Open on Thursday to enter the quarter finals. It was a far cry from her first-round match where she blew away Rushmi Chakravarthy 6-0, 6-4. 

At the end of the day, it is the win that matters, said Sania at the post-match press conference. 

True, I was struggling hard with my serve in the first set. But I was not looking forward to playing three sets. I started serving better. I started concentrating more and it paid off. 

But why was it so tough against someone who is outside the top 100? 

You have to remember that everything is not about ranking or points. She played far better than her ranking (109). You just need to play some close matches and your ranking will drop. Each tie, whosoever you play against, is tough in a different way. 

Was she under pressure? Pressure of playing on the home ground is always there. Kloesel was doing everything right. I was the one who had to come up with something that much extra 

To a question that her last five games were perfect, unlike her earlier games, Sania snapped: Players too are human beings. They are not programmed to do something right all the time. 

How is she looking at her quarter final clash with Aravane Rezai, the fourth seed, on Friday? 

Aravane is very talented and shes been having a good year so far she reached the third round of the French Open and the fourth of the US Open. Shes a big hitter too. Tomorrow it will be my forehand against her backhand.

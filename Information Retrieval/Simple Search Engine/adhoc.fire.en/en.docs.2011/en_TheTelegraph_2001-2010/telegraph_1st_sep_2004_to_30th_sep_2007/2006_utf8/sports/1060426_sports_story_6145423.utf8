 This is Englands moment to seize

 - There is no other way to win but sacrificing yourself for the team 

 ALAN BALL

 Frank Lampard (above) and Steve Gerrard are the best two midfielders in the country and they have to find a way of harnessing their abilities 

The night when the professional game honours its own has always been special to me. I know what it is like to be picked by your own kind as the best, as Steven Gerrard was at the Professional Footballers Association dinner on Sunday. 

But, standing before them as guest of honour, I wanted to give the men who will travel to Germany some insight into the emotions that they will have to face head on this summer. For Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney and the rest of Sven-Goran Erikssons squad, this is their time; this is their moment to seize. 

I was 21, slightly older than Rooney is now, when the summer of 1966 began and when it ended my life had changed forever. The first thing they will notice is the feeling of responsibility; that you are carrying the weight of expectation of a whole football nation. 

It is how you handle that pressure and cope with an expectancy that is on you 24 hours a day that will define how you do in the biggest tournament in the world. 

At the end of the 1965-66 season with Blackpool, I read the papers avidly, every Saturday my performance was analysed and the back pages would be rife with conjecture about whether I would make it into the squad. This year, the media coverage will be overwhelming. 

I was lucky in that I came from a footballing background. My father had carved out a career in the lower leagues as a player and a manager and he drove me hard because he desperately wanted me to be a better footballer than he was. 

When I told him I was in the squad, he said: Now get in the team. When I showed him my winners medal, he was similarly unemotional. He said simply Well done and told me there would be other games and other battles to be won. 

But winning the World Cup is a life-defining moment. It changed us not just financially but in the way we completely became the publics property. What comes with it is the strange feeling that, yes, you are the best in the world and 40 years on, this is something another England generation could experience. 

But going into that tournament Alf Ramseys team were not the Bobby Moores, the Geoff Hursts and Bobby Charltons as you know them now. 

They were a group of very talented footballers, like John Terry, Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard, but it was what they did that summer 40 years ago that made them legends. They became a team. 

What I wanted to tell Rooney and others in the room is that there is no other way to win but to sacrifice yourself for the team. People talk constantly about whether Gerrard and Lampard can play together. I can only say that they must ? they are the best two midfielders in the country and they have to find a way of harnessing their abilities because England is so much bigger than either of them. 

When I was preparing for the World Cup, Alf Ramsey came over to me and asked if I had a dog. I had, and he asked if I threw it a ball or a stick. I knew he was trying to get something out of me so I said a ball. And then he said does he bring it back to you? Yes, and sometimes he brings it right to my feet. 

Thats what I want you to do for Bobby Charlton, Alf said. I want you and Nobby Stiles to bring the ball to his feet. He wanted the pair of us to sacrifice ourselves for the team. We did and we won and now others will have to do that for Rooney. 

Eriksson has players 

every bit as talented as Ramseys but whether they will win we will find out in Germ-any. But to win, to have that medal in their hands, they will have to cast away every trace of ego. 

There have been some fabulous sides who have not won World Cups ? Brazil in 1982, a series of great Dutch teams ? and they failed because they did not let their egos go. 

England won in 1966 because they were a team and they could not have won any other way. That is the key message I want to get over to the Gerrards and the Rooneys because in their lifetimes there will be no greater prize.

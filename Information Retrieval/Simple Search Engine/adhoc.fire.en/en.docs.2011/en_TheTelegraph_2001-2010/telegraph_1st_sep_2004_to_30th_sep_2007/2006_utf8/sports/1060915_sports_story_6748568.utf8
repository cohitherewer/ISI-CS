 Kapur-Ghei in joint lead

Kuala Lumpur: Indias pairing of Gaurav Ghei and Shiv Kapur turned in Thursdays only under-par second round score at the WGC World Cup qualifiers, propelling them to a share of the lead with Singapore and the Philippines. 

Kapur and Ghei shot a one-under 70 in the foursomes, alternate shot format at the Seri Selangor Club for combined 138 total. 

Singapores Mardan Mamat and Lam Chih Bing fired a 73 while the Filipino duo of Juvic Pagunsan and Gerald Rosales scrambled to a 74 to share first at the halfway mark. The top two nations in the 14-strong field qualify for the golf world championships at Barbados in December. 

India were a combined 4-under on Seri Selangors three par-fives, with the 13th hole their standout eagle. 

Gheis approach found the greenside bunker which Kapur hit out and into the cup for an eagle-three. 

When we were walking up the 13th green, I casually told Shiv to just hole the bunker shot and he goes on to do it. It was amazing, said Ghei.

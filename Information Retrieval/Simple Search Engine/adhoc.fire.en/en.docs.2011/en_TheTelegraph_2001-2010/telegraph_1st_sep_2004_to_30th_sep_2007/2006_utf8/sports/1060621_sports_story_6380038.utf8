 Kewell cleared

Berlin: Australia forward Harry Kewell has been cleared by Fifa to play in their final group F World Cup match against Croatia on Thursday after he was reported for confronting the referee after their 0-2 defeat by Brazil. 

The disciplinary committee looked at the Harry Kewell case, but because of inconsistencies in the referees report, the case is now closed and Harry Kewell is clear to play. There will be no further action on the matter, said Fifa director of communications, Markus Siegler. 

Kewell, speaking before the disciplinary hearing, told an Australians television channel that his outburst had been a spur-of-the moment incident. (Reuters)

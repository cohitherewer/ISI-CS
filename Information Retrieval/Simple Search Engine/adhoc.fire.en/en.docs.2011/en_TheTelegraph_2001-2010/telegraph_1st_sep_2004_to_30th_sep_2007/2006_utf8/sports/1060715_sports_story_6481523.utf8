 Steve cleverest sledger

 - Dont wake Lara up by sledging, says Hussain 

 Steve Waugh and Brian 

 Lara 

London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain has advised bowlers not to sledge Brian Lara as the outcome could be disastrous. 

In an interesting take on on-field verbal volleys, Hussain said that former Australian skipper Steve Waugh as the cleverest sledger of all. 

I was never that fussed by it (sledging). There are degrees ?? the fast bowlers tend not to be the brightest and their words tend not to be the kind of thing youd want to print in a newspaper, the former batsman said in a London daily. 

Warney was more clever. Hed tell you about every time hed ever got you out. Steve Waugh was cleverer still. Hed pick your game to pieces from the gully or slip, telling you what hed seen on the telly highlights or read in the paper about your technique, he said while replying to a readers query. 

There are some players we didnt bother with: Brian Lara, for example, you dont sledge him because you dont want to wake him up. The Aussies tried it once and he scored 275 against them in Sydney. 

Asked about his infamous three-finger protest to Ian Botham and Co. in 2002, Hussain said: I thought at the time I had something to prove and I proved it. I get on pretty well with Beefy now anyway. 

He usually asks me how many times Ive won the Ashes and I ask him how many times he beat the West Indies. But I get on well with all of them. I always used the media ?? if people were having a go and I could use it as motivation to prove them wrong. The producer still shows it occasionally and we have a laugh.

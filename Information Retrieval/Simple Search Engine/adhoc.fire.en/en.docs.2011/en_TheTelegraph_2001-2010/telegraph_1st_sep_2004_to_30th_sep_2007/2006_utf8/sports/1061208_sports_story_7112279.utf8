 Miandad: An eyewash

 - SHOAIB, ASIF EPISODE 

Karachi: Javed Miandad Thursday joined a list of former players who have slammed the decision of the Pakistani authorities to exonerate fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif of doping charges. 

Miandad, a veteran of 128 Tests and the countrys leading Test run scorer, said the decision of the Pakistan Cricket Board appointed appellate tribunal was a big eyewash. 

I really dont know all the details but certainly to me it looks odd that two tribunals headed by two former governors and eminent legal experts should have such differing views on what is a clear cut case of doping, intentionally or unintentionally, he said. 

Miandad said he did not see Pakistan cricket gaining any credibility after this doping episode. 

First of all I really dont understand that when the PCB anti-doping regulations are still not in line with those of the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Cricket Council why the hurry to have the out of competition tests. 

The board should have first got its anti-doping regulations in place in line with WADA rules and than started its anti-doping drive. It has only gone and embarrassed Pakistan cricket internationally, he said. 

He said the entire episode appeared to be an eyewash. 

It seems as if somewhere discipline and regulations have been sacrificed. I have always said there should never be compromise on discipline no matter how big a player is. Cricket Australia also did ban Shane Warne for one year despite his stature. 

Miandad feared that Pakistan cricket would lose a lot of credibility due to the way the issue had been handled. 

We were praised everywhere and hailed as a honest nation when the bans were imposed. In just a month everything has changed. 

Meanwhile Shoaib and Asif are expected to undergo another test before next years World Cup. (PTI)

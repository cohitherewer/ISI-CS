London: Holders Croatia held a 2-0 lead over Austria and the US recovered from a shock defeat of Andy Roddick to draw level with Romania after opening singles matches in the Davis Cup World Group first round on Friday. 

Last years runners-up Slovakia trailed Chile 0-2 and Belarus led 2004 champions Spain, while Australia and Switzerland, each without their top players Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer, respectively, were level at 1-1 going into Saturdays doubles in Geneva. 

Croatia were in command against Austria after Mario Ancic recovered from two sets down to beat Juergen Melzer in a five-set marathon lasting more than four-and-half hours, while Ivan Ljubicic had a much easier time as he cruised past Stefan Koubek. 

American James Blake defeated Romanias Victor Hanescu 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 to level the tie after Andrei Pavel had rallied from two sets down to beat world No.3 Andy Roddick 6-7, 2-6, 7-6, 6-2, 6-4. 

The 32-year-old Pavel saved a match point in the third set tiebreak with a brilliant top-spin lob. 

Roddick then struggled badly after losing the tiebreak 10-8. The American was treated for an injury to his right wrist early in the fourth set and was physically sick on court before slumping to defeat. 

Max Mirnyi defeated Tommy Robredo in four sets and Vladimir Voltchkov needed only three to overcome David Ferrer as Belarus went 2-0 up in Minsk against a Spain team without world No.2 Rafael Nadal and Juan Carlos Ferrero. 

Russia, playing in Amsterdam without their best player Marat Safin, established a 2-0 lead over The Netherlands.

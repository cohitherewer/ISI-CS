Kuala Lumpur: Cricket has, in the past few weeks, seen extraordinary happenings. 

From a blast in Colombo (which unnerved the South Africans and cancelled a tri-series) to the forfeiture of a Test and Darrell Hairs correspondence with the International Cricket Council... On a smaller scale, even Mahendra Singh Dhonis omission from the list of contenders for the most envied annual awards... 

Each event has taken something away from the game, but the boundaries keep growing: Come Tuesday, when the DLF Cup gets underway, the Malaysian capital will become the 161st venue for ODIs. Kuala Lumpur did host the 1998 Commonwealth Games, when cricket was a medal-sport, but the runs and wickets then didnt enter anybodys official records. 

The meet has been conceived by the Board of Control for Cricket in India and is going to be conducted by Cricket Australia, but the locals should be top gainers. Indeed, match No. 1 is between current masters Australia and the one-time unbeatables West Indies. 

The Indians dont get into the act, at the Kinrara Oval (which, with its temporary stands for a mere 5,000-odd, is almost 25 kms from the team hotel), till Thursday. 

Much of the attention that day will, no doubt, be on the duel between West Indies captain Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar. The latter didnt tour the Caribbean this summer and, so, it has been quite a while over four years since the two came up against each other. 

In the larger war, thats one battle which just cant go unnoticed. 

Sachin, by the way, is so focused on what has become his comeback tournament (after two cancellations in Sri Lanka) that he declined to speak even about good friend Michael Schumachers decision to retire. 

Talking of the opener, the Australians are coming off a four-and-half month break, while the West Indies last ODI was in end-May. More recently, there was another contracts dispute in the West Indies. The Australians, on the other hand, were preparing for a demanding physical and mental examination. 

Even if some had misgivings early on, everybody came away (from the Sunshine Coast) singing praises of coach John Buchanan. Its to be seen how effective that Boot Camp really was, but Ricky Ponting believes he and the rest have come out better cricketers. 

The captain didnt have to, but observed that Buchanans contribution had been overlooked. Also, that the coach was responsible for the (high) quality of cricket played by Australia. 

A long lay-off coupled with the capital citys heat and humidity could affect the best, but Ponting was quick to declare, on Monday afternoon, that his teams skills wont get affected. We wont set the world on fire tomorrow, but slowly feel our way... 

The Australians are going to mix-and-match in the league stage (four matches). However, if they make the final, then the best XI minus Adam Gilchrist will be out on the park The squad is 18-strong. 

Its no surprise that the Australians have high expectations from Glenn McGrath, who took a break early in the year when wife Jane got diagnosed with breast cancer. Hes fit and has worked very hard, Ponting remarked. 

[Talking to The Telegraph, McGrath said his wife was better and that he was himself feeling good. The champion bowler, who is making another comeback, certainly looked relaxed.] 

The Australians are going to pick from 15 as Andrew Symonds, Michael Hussey and Brad Hogg have been placed among the reserves for match No. 1. Simon Katich and Phil Jacques will open. 

Meanwhile, like his counterparts, Lara is looking at the latest tri-series as a warm-up for the Champions Trophy. The West Indies, though, must get past the qualifiers. Well, the captain is confident. 

Weve won nine of the last ten ODIs, but all were at home... This (meet) gives us an opportunity to see how well we travel, Lara pointed out. For the record, Ponting described the opposition as an improving team. 

While the Australians remain at the top, the No. 3 spot is held by India. The West Indies are way down, in the seventh position. However, rankings dont always tell the full story.

 No reserve days 

 Inclement weather isnt unexpected at this time 

 of the year, but there are no reserve days. It didnt 

 rain at the Kinrara Oval on Monday evening, but it was pouring 

 in the heart of Kuala Lumpur.

 BRIAN LARA ON QUALIFYING AND SACHIN

 Brian Lara feels let down 

 that the West Indies despite being defending champions 

 have to qualify for the International Cricket Council-conducted 

 Champions Trophy, to be hosted by India in October-November.

 Its disappointing, 

 I feel let down, is how the captain put it on Monday 

 evening.

 The West Indies, it may be recalled, failed to be ranked 

 in the top-six by the cut-off date and, so, must play three 

 qualifying matches versus Zimbabwe (Motera, October 

 8), Bangladesh (Jaipur, October 11) and Sri Lanka (Mumbai, 

 October 14).

 Two of the four teams will make it.

 While Lara is cut up about the 

 qualifying issue, hes delighted that Sachin Tendulkar 

 is back. He has played little cricket in the last 

 two years and Im waiting with bated breath... I opened 

 with him in a charity game (in England) and cherish that 

 moment... It was special...

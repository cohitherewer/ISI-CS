 Nayeem hits panic button

 - TIE vs YEMEN 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajat Ghosh Dastidar has been included as the fourth goalkeeper 

New Delhi: Chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin seems to have hit the panic button. Crestfallen after the 0-6 loss to Japan in Yokohama, the Dronacharya has called up six more players in all, with just four days remaining for the next Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen. 

Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, M. Suresh, S. Venkatesh, Dipak Mondal, Micky Fernandes and Surojit Bose are the ones who have been summoned. 

Not many ? officials and players included ? are happy with Nayeems decision. Most feel the same set of players who went to Japan should do duty against Yemen, placed 135th in the Fifa rankings. 

Cant just understand the reason for calling up so many new players suddenly? The problem is that we are in no position to question the coachs decision, said an AIFF official. 

Skipper Bhaichung, when asked about the reinforcements, replied curtly: Why dont you ask the coach? I dont select the team, after all. 

Manager P.K. Banerjee was not very optimistic of Suresh and Venkatesh recovering in time for the Yemen tie. We know Suresh and Venkatesh had injuries. But we have called them for the camp only, they have not been included in the final squad, he said. 

Mondal, according to Banerjee, has been called under instructions from the AIFF president. As far as Fernandes, Surojit and Rajat are concerned, Nayeem wanted them. I, too, felt it was not a great decision, but my job is to advise him, not interfere in his work, Banerjee explained. 

Rajats inclusion was baffling in the sense that the squad already had three goalkeepers. Nayeem said the idea behind calling up Rajat was to keep the three other goalkeepers under pressure. 

Some players like Mahesh Gawli and Ajayan have minor injuries. I asked for Jagdish Papaya, but he doesnt have a passport. Fernandes has the ability to play passes in the middle, the coach added. 

As for Suresh and Venkatesh, I only hope they recover in time.

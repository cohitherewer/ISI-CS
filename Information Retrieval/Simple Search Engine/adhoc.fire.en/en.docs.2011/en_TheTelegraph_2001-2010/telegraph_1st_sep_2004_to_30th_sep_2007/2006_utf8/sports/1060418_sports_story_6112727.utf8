Chittagong: Australia progressed steadily to 151 for two and looked set for a big first-innings lead on a rain-hit Day II in the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Monday. 

Rain stopped play 27 minutes before lunch and the interruption lasted for the entire afternoon session. Play was called off for the day a little after the scheduled tea interval because of a wet outfield. 

Jason Gillespie (28), sent in as nightwatchman on Sunday was batting with captain Ricky Ponting (19) when play was halted after just 22.4 overs in the morning session. 

The world champions, looking to dominate after a less than emphatic three-wicket win in the opening Test in Fatullah last week, dismissed the home side for just 197. 

Opener Phil Jacques then struck his maiden half-century in only his second Test to put them on track for a sizeable lead. The left-hander hit 66 including eight fours and one six and was not afraid to play uppish shots in his 98-ball knock. 

The 26-year-old looked well set until he tried to sweep a ball from left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique, only to give an easy catch to Shahriar Nafees at mid-wicket. 

Meanwhile, Australia captain Ricky Ponting was on Monday fined 25 per cent of his match fee for asking the on-field umpires to refer a decision to third umpire, another report adds from London. 

Ponting was found guilty of dissent by Match Referee Jeff Crowe in a hearing after the second days play on Monday, the ICC said in a release. 

The offence related to his reaction when Bangladesh batsman Aftab Ahmed was initially given not out following a referral to the third umpire during Sundays first day of the Test match. 

 Scribes protest 

Some 200 Bangladeshi journalists staged a protest on Monday against alleged violence by police during the current Test match. 

More than a dozen journalists were injured on Sunday when police used batons to disperse them after arguments broke out about entry to the stadium in the south-eastern city of Chittagong on the first day of the game. 

Police suspended one officer for his alleged involvement in the incident, Chittagong Police chief Mazedul Huq said.

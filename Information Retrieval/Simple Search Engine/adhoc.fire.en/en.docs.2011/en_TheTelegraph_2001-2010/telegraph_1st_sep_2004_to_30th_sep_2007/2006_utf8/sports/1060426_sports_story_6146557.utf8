 Zidane to retire after World Cup

 - 'It's my decision and it's final'

Paris: Zinedine Zidane said on Tuesday he would retire after the World Cup finals in Germany. Its my decision and its final, the France and Real Madrid playmaker told a French TV channel. The 33-year-old, who led France to victory in the 1998 World Cup and Euro 2000, had hinted recently that he was ready to quit. 

Zidane became the worlds most expensive footballer when Real signed him from Juventus for $66 million in 2001 and he scored a superb winner to earn Real their ninth European Cup in the 2002 final against Bayer Leverkusen. 

Keeping his eyes fixed on a high and hopeful cross from Roberto Carlos, he drifted away from his markers before unleashing an unstoppable left-foot volley from the edge of the area that sailed into the back of the net. 

The goal also enabled the Frenchman to complete an impressive collection of winners medals for club and country. The following year he added the Spanish league title to his haul and a third World Player of the Year award. 

But injuries and inconsistency have dogged him over the last two seasons and, although he still has another year left on his contract with Real, he decided to call it a day. 

I have to listen to my body and I cannot carry on for another year, said Zidane, who cited Reals poor results as one of the reasons for his decision. I think it is better to clarify the situation now. 

 Zidane had been expected to announce 

 his decision at a conference on Wednesday in Madrid.

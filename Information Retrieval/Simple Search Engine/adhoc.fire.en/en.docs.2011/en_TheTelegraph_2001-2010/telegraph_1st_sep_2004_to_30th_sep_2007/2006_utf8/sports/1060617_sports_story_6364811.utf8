 Angola hold Mexico 0-0

Hanover: Angola held Mexico to a dull 0-0 draw on Friday, leaving both teams still with a chance of qualifying for the World Cup second round from group D. 

Mexico striker Omer Bravo almost broke the deadlock with two minutes left but his close range shot from the right of the area hit the outside of the post. The Mexicans also hit the woodwork in the first-half and had an effort cleared off the line. 

Angola had to play the last seven minutes without midfielder Andre Macanga, who was sent off for a second bookable offence after unnecessarily handling the ball.

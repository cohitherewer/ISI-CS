Calcutta: The CFL Premier Division resumed after many moons and East Bengal were quickly into business at the Barasat stadium on Saturday afternoon. 

The clock had barely registered one minute when Alvito DCunha bulged the George Telegraph netting with a brilliant left-footed volley. It turned out to be the games only goal and gave the midfielder the Man-of-the-Match award on his return to competitive soccer after a long lay-off. 

Leaders East Bengal now have 25 points with three games remaining. Mohun Bagan have a tally of 21, having played the same number of games. Two more wins will give the red-and-golds the crown, even if their arch-rivals pick up full points in their remaining games. 

Talking of the winning goal first, it was a long cross-field centre from Vincent Pires which landed in the George citadel. The right-back was not in position and DCunha got to the ball, went wide to the left and unleashed a left-footer from an acute angle. 

DCunha was in his element and with Pires producing his searing runs down the right and Dipankar Roy dazzling from time to time, East Bengal looked sharp whenever they went invaded the George territory. 

Freddy Mascarenhas missed a couple of chances, Brazilian striker Marcio failed to beat the custodian from close range. 

It wasnt as if George Telegraph went down without a fight. They dared to test the East Bengal defence, with their big Nigerian forward Yusuf Ibrahim spelling danger two or three times. A smart shot was well kept away by Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, while a free-kick missed the mark narrowly.

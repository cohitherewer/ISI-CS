 Aussies rule Day III

 Melbourne: Libby Lenton and Leisel Jones collected their second gold medals as Australia dominated the third day of the Commonwealth Games on Saturday. 

Lenton won the womens 100m freestyle and led off the triumphant 4x200m relay team, while Jones added the 200m breaststroke title to her 50m success and remained on course for a unique treble. 

Olympic cycling champion Ryan Bayley also picked up his second gold by winning the mens sprint and the host nation added 11 golds to raise their total tally to 23 with eight days of competition to go. 

England enjoyed their best day in Melbourne by winning five golds, including two each in the pool and the velodrome, to overtake India for second place in the standings with eight golds. 

India won another three golds on Saturday to take their tally to seven with pistol shooter Samaresh Jung winning two events with different partners. 

Scotland won two more, including another surprise victory in swimming, and South African sprinter Roland Schoeman captured his second gold in the pool with victory in the 50m butterfly. 

Australia won at least one gold in each of the six different sports held on Saturday but nowhere were they more dominant than at the Melbourne Aquatic Centre, which they have turned into their own golden pond. 

They won all four womens finals, including a clean sweep in the freestyle sprint, and the mens disability race, which has been included on the medals table for the first time. 

Lenton consolidated her place as the worlds fastest female swimmer by beating teammate Jodie Henry, the world and Olympic champion. 

Lenton regained the world record from Henry seven weeks ago at the Australian trials but had never won a major international title over 100m until Saturday. (Reuters)

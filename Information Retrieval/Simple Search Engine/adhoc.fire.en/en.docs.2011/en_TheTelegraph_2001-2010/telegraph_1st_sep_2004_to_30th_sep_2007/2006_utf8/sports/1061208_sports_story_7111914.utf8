Calcutta: Disappointments galore for the 5,000-odd boisterous supporters of East Bengal who had come to watch the local outfit in their opening encounter of the 112th IFA Shield encounter at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

The fans anger who became unmanageable towards the end was not just for their teams loss to Sporting Clube de Goa, but also for the fact that despite repeated promises they had failed to improve their performance under the Brazilian coach. 

With bottles being thrown from the stands, and booing its a disgrace losing on home turf, oust Carlos (Roberto Pereira) reverberating the eardrums, the fans whore yet to recover from their teams 0-4 loss to JCT in Durand Cup recently anger was evident. For the 0-1 scoreline could have easily been 2-1, had the local giants not squandered a couple of golden chances. 

The first by Gouranga Dutta who missed an easy header off captain Alvito dCunha in the 28th minute. Then 12 minutes after the changeover, the hosts again faltered, this time Brazilian Thiagode Sousa D Costa who, capitalising on substitute S Malsanmtluangas pass, hit the goalpost. That led coach Pereira to substitute DCosta with Ashim Biswas in the 64th minute. 

However, that did not help either. Two minutes later, East Bengal had one more chance when Daniel Carlos Jorge ballooned one into the penalty box, where a confused duo of Ashim-Gouranga failed to make a foray. 

The two lessons (read: mis-hits) from the home team was enough to make the Goans more determined and resurgent. Sporting stepped up the ante soon. A clinical flag-kick from Harmanjot Khabra in the 57th minute, saw skipper Dudu Omagmbemi launch a power-packed header which was enough for the Goan team to grab their first (and full) points in the Shield. The header went straight into the right corner of the net. 

Towards the end, East Bengal made desperate attempts but in vain, while the Goans would rue for the fact that they faltered to add one more to the tally when substitute Jermaiah Ernest missed a golden opportunity, five minutes before the final whistle. 

East Bengal now face Mahindra United in their Group A do-or-die match on December 11. 

Footnote: Amid the jeers, the only reprieve for the supporters were Sourav Gangulys sparkling performance at Sedgars Park in Potchefstroom. His 83 had become the talking point.

 Nadal set for claycourt return

 Monte Carlo Masters

 Paris: French Open champion 

 Rafael Nadal will step on to a claycourt for the first time 

 in seven months when he defends his Monte Carlo Masters 

 crown next week.

 The Spanish world number two won 

 nine titles on the surface last year but is making a late 

 start to this claycourt campaign after a career-threatening 

 left foot injury hit his schedule.

 Twelve months ago he arrived in 

 the principality having already pocketed two titles on clay 

 but the second seed will be cautious when he steps out on 

 the punishing red dirt for his opening match against Frenchman 

 Arnaud Clement.

 What I have ahead of me 

 is a claycourt season not for the defence of 2,300 points 

 because if we view it the other way round, were not 

 going to get off to a good start, he said on his website.

 The hype surrounding his return 

 is focused on a possible final showdown with world number 

 one Roger Federer.

 Nadal has won their last two encounters, 

 including a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory in the Dubai Open final 

 last month.

 But having contested only four 

 events this year, Nadal wants to concentrate on his own 

 form.

 I prefer to focus on my 

 performance as I have to play at my best, he said. 

 At the moment, I can only meet Federer in the final, 

 so Ive got to win lots of matches.

 Short of match practice, the Spaniard 

 will do well to get beyond the opening round since he was 

 beaten by Clement in their previous meeting in Marseille.

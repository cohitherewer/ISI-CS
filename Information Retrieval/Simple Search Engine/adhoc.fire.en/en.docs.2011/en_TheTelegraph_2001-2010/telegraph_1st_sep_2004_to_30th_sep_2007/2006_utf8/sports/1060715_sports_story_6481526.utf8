The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Favourites to the fore on Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Corner

Calcutta: Barring a friendless Jango, who gave the Delhi-based trainer Shafiq Khan a winning start in the Fair Ray Handicap on Friday ? the opening day of the monsoon season ? the afternoon was ruled by the course favourites.

 The ball was set rolling by the Robin Corner-trained hot-favourite, Body And Soul, who claimed the Woolver Valley Handicap without much ado. Corner went on to lift the feature event, the Zipper Cup, when his strongly fancied runner, Grand Ceremony (Shanker-up), had a narrow measure of Javed Khans Alarico.

 The afternoon also witnessed suspension of jockeys Jugnu Gurang and Md Islam for unsatisfactory riding of their respective wards ? Elusive Adventure and The Polynesian.

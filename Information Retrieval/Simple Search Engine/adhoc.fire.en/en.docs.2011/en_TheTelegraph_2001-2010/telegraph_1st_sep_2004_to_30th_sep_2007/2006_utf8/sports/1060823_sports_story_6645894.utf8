Colombo: Young penalty corner specialist Raghunath and forward Gurvinder Singh Chandi struck a brace each as India annihilated hosts Sri Lanka 9-1 in a lop-sided league match to book a place in the final of the SAF games hockey competition here on Tuesday. 

Sandeep Michael scored the first goal for India in the third minute after which the floodgates opened at the Ekanayaka Stadium at Matale here. 

Raghunath converted a penalty corner in the fourth and even before the celebrations were over, Chandi found the net as the Indian team, comprising mainly U-20 players, raced to a 3-0 lead within the seventh minute. 

India are next slated to play Bangladesh who were thrashed 5-2 by Pakistan in another league match of the day. 

Justifying their favourites tag yet again, Indian swimmers sank three meet records on the way to winning seven of the eight gold medals on offer at the 10th SAF Games here on Tuesday. 

Rehan Poncha won the mens 200m individual medley gold with a new meet mark of 2:11.22 seconds, smashing the existing record of 2:11.27 seconds held by compatriot J. Abhijeeth. 

Indian girl Fariha Zaman created a new games mark in 200m backstroke with a timing of 2:31.49 seconds. Her compatriot Madhavi Giri timed 2:32.45 to take the silver, while Pakistans Kiran Khan (2:40.49) got the bronze. 

Another meet record was shattered in mens 200m butterfly, where Arjun Muralidharan swam to glory by bettering the existing mark. He clocked 2 min 05.06 seconds pushing compatriot Poncha 2:07.33 and Pakistans Nasir Ali 2:12.97 to the silver and bronze, respectively. 

Indian paddlers swept the tables to win all the three golds on offer in the doubles battle. The Indian table tennis tally swelled to five gold and three silver medals at the St Thomas Stadium. 

Commonwealth Games champion Achanta Sharath Kamal, pairing with Poulami Ghatak, conquered compatriot Soumyadeep Roy and Mouma Das 11-3, 12-14, 11-7, 11-6 to win the yellow metal. 

In womens doubles, Poulami and Mouma outclassed Kasturi Chakraborty and Nandita Saha 11-5, 11-13, 11-7, 11-8. 

Sharath Kamal grabbed the second gold of the day as he paired with Soumyadeep to beat Subhajit Saha and Pathik Mehta 11-7, 11-5, 4-11, 11-8 in mens doubles. 

Junior World Championship gold medallist Navnath Fartade lived up to his reputation to bag the gold in 10m air rifle event. 

 India clinched the badminton team championships for both men and women with identical 3-0 victories over Sri Lanka in the final. 

In the womens section, Trupti Murgunde, who had won the singles gold earlier, scripted a 21-10, 21-11 win over Thilini Jayasingha.

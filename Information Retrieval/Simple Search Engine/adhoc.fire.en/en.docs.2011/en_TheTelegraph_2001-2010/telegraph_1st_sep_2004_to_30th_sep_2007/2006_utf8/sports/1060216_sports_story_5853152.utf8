 Asif fined 10% of match fee 

Multan: Pakistan seamer Mohammed Asif was fined 10 per cent of his match fee on Wednesday for excessive appealing during the third one-day International against India at Lahore on Monday. 

Asif pleaded guilty to the charge of excessive appealing at a hearing conducted by Match Referee Chris Broad, ICC said in a release. 

He was found to breach level 1.5 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to excessive appealing. 

Asif is new to the international arena and is trying very hard to change the way he appeals but he must learn to respect the umpire and turn to ask if the batsman is out for all dismissals, Broad said. 

All level one breach carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand and a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee. 

The charge was brought by on-field umpires Simon Taufel, Asad Rauf and third umpire Zamir Haider. 

Broad reached his conclusion after a hearing attended by Asif, Bob Woolmer and team manager Asad Mustafa.

 Bengal set 

 up showdown with Punjab

Gurgaon: 

 When Bengal goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey suffered an ankle 

 injury in the 70th minute to be replaced by Abhra Mondal, 

 one thought it could pose problems for Bengal in the tie-breaker. 

 In reality, as it turned out to be, Bengal perhaps didnt 

 need a custodian under the bar.

 After giving a scare to the Bengal 

 defence for most part of the second half and the entire 

 30 minutes of extra time, Kerala proved to be poor customers 

 in the shoot out as they hit out their first two shots completely 

 wide. That set the motion for a 4-2 Bengal victory in the 

 second semi-final of the Santosh Trophy at the Devi Lal 

 Sports Complex here on Sunday. In the final to be played 

 on Wednesday, Bengal will take on Punjab at 4.45pm.

 The wild celebrations that followed 

 in the Bengal bench immediately after Shyam Mondal shot 

 in the fourth goal for his team in the tie-breaker was very 

 much there. After all, these unsung heroes of Prasanta Banerjees 

 team have created history by taking Bengal to the final 

 of the National Championships after a gap of six years. 

 The last time Bengal had a feel of the trophy was in 1999 

 when Bhaichung Bhutias boys hammered five goals past 

 Goa in a one-sided final. 

 Dipendu Biswas, the only player 

 in the present squad, who played in the 1999 final, actually 

 set the tone for Bengals win on Sunday. After Keralas 

 Rajesh shot wide off the left post, Biswas put Bengal in 

 the lead with a confident shot past goalkeeper Jean Christiana. 

 Once Biswas did it correctly, three more goals followed 

 from Sanjeev Maria, Suman Dutta and Shyam Mondal to end 

 Keralas run in the tournament. 

 In between, Keralas Jaseer 

 Karnath shot the second shot off the mark. Lenal Thomas 

 and NP Pradeep tried to make amends by scoring from the 

 third and the fourth shot, but the damage had already been 

 done by that time. 

 Overall, Bengal should feel lucky 

 to be able to end the regulation as well as the extra time 

 goalless. Given the trend of the match, Bengal were at the 

 receiving end for a major period and could have conceded 

 at least two goals in the extra time. Goalkeeper Mondal 

 came up with a terrific save in the first half of the extra 

 time when he foiled Kerala skipper NP Pradeep inside the 

 six-yard box. That could have easily spelt doom for the 

 29-time champions. 

 Bengals moment of glory 

 in the stipulated time came only for a brief period in the 

 first half. The highly vociferous and drum beating fans 

 of Kerala cheered their team from the very first minute, 

 but it was Bengal who took charge. While Sanjeev Maria did 

 a splendid job in defence, Tapan Maity did great work in 

 keeping Pradeep off colour on the right. It broke Keralas 

 backbone in the midfield.

 But Bengals problems were 

 different. Their strikers looked matured, but the midfield 

 was content to pay the spoilers role. They could never 

 build up the attacks and it allowed Kerala to make a comeback 

 in the second half. The Kerala supporters, who were rooting 

 for their team in the stands, were seen running around the 

 ground with posters and banners. As Bengal were struggling 

 to hold on, Kerala looked like scoring at any moment. But 

 it was not to be as Bengal defence managed to drag the match 

 to the tie-breaker. 5

 In the first semi-final, Punjab 

 made a strong second-half comeback to defeat Maharashtra 

 2-1 in a rather drab encounter. Maharashtra took the lead 

 a minute before the half time through Abhishek Yadav, who 

 capitalised on a pass from Paresh Shivalkar. Punjab, who 

 always held the upper hand, finally came good with the equaliser 

 through Baldeep Singh in the 66th minute. Six minutes later, 

 international Praveen Kumar struck the winning goal.

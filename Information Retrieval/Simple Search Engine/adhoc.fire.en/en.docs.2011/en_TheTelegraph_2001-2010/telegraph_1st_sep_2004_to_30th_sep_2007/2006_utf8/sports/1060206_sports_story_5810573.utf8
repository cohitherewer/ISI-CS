The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav issue unresolved

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With Deep Dasgupta almost certain to lead the 14-member Bengal squad for the East Zone one-dayers, former India captain Sourav Ganguly still hasnt conveyed his decision to the CAB. I couldnt get in touch with Sourav and am not sure whether he is in the city, but expect to have a word with him before the selection, CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said. 

Despite all efforts, if CAB fails to contact Sourav, the selectors are likely to keep a slot for him as the 15th member. Bengal will play Tripura in the opener of the meet that begins in Dhanbad on Saturday. 

However, allrounder Sanjib Sanyal may walk into the squad at the expense of a medium-pacer.

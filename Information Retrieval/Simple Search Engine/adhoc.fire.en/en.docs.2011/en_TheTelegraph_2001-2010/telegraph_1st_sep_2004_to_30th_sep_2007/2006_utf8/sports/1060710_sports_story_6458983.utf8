 Cristiano: I cant stay in England 

 - I like Real, barcelona 

 Cristiano Ronaldo 

Stuttgart: Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave Manchester United and move to Spain. I cant stay in England, the winger said on Saturday after his team lost to Germany 1-3 in the World Cups third-place match. Everyone knows my dream is to play in Spain, he said. 

Ronaldo was jeered by England fans in Germany and was harshly criticised in the British media after a tussle with Wayne Rooney which ended in his United teammate being sent off during a World Cup quarter final match. 

Ronaldo recently said he was interested in a move to Real Madrid and said his agent planned to meet with Uniteds chairman next week. Ill work out my future over the next two or three days, Ronaldo said. Theyve been making a storm in a tea cup in England. Its hard to go back to a country where youre not welcome. Well see how things pan out. 

Ronaldo, however, is leaving open the possibility of moving to Reals arch-rivals Barcelona. 

Real and Barcelona are the two teams I like and I will play for one of them. My agent will meet with the owner of Manchester United to sort out my situation. I dont think Ive got the support of the owner or the manager (Alex Ferguson). Neither of them has backed me. 

Rooney was sent off in the 62nd minute of a shootout loss to Portugal for stomping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho. Ronaldo ran up to the referee to protest Rooneys actions and the England striker shoved him away. TV cameras caught Ronaldo winking toward the Portugal bench after Rooney was ejected. 

England went on to lose the quarter final in a penalty shootout. 

A Fifa disciplinary panel on Saturday suspended Rooney for two competitive international matches and fined him 5,000 Swiss francs ($4,085) for the red card. 

Real Madrids new coach Fabio Capello said that, although he was aware that Ronaldo had shown interest in joining Madrid, the club had not reciprocated the interest. 

Cristiano Ronaldo is a great player, but hes a Manchester United player. Players always want to play at Real Madrid and were happy he might want to play here, Capello said.

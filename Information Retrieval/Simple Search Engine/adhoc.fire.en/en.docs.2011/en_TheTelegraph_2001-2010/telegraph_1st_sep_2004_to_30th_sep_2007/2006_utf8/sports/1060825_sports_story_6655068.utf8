 Row could split ICC: Pak minister 

 - The Inzamam-Hair show continues to be a top draw

Karachi: Pakistans sports minister has warned that the ball-tampering row, which blew up here last week, could split crickets world governing body. 

Mian Shamim Haider said there was a real possibility Asias four Test-playing countries would form a faction within the International Cricket Council (ICC) over the row, which has prompted racism claims against umpire Darrell Hair. 

Hes been controversial. He had done the same thing with the Indians, he had done the same thing with the Sri Lankans and Bangladesh players, Haider told a television channel. There could be groups and the ICC would be divided into two groups. 

The minister called for the ICC to withdraw the claim that Pakistan cheated in the fourth Test against England or bring evidence to prove it. 

We feel they should withdraw these allegations or if they have the cameras, they have the proof, they can prove it. If they prove it, fine, we dont mind. 

The beleaguered Inzamam amp; Co. also received a much-needed morale booster with the government backing them in the controversy. 

Pakistan government and the people of Pakistan are fully behind the team and Inzamam-ul Haq as we believe Hairs decisions were incorrect and biased, Haider told the National Assembly. 

Inzamam faced a ban of up to eight one-dayers or four Tests for bringing the game into disrepute when he did not take his side out to the field after tea following Hairs penalising the team five runs for ball tampering on the fourth day of the match. 

Pakistan thus became the first team in the history of the game to forfeit a Test. 

Hair did not warn the captain nor did he prove the ball-tampering charges. The cricket team has hired the services of a reputed law firm and all efforts would be made to exonerate the team of ball-tampering charges, Haider maintained.

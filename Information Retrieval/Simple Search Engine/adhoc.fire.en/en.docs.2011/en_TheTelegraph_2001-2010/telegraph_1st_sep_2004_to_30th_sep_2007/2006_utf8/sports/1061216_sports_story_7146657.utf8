 Qatar bag soccer gold

Doha: Qatar saved their best for last. 

On the final day of the Asian Games which Qatar have hosted for the past two-and-half weeks, its beloved soccer team beat Iraq 1-0 Friday to end the biggest edition of the regional games for 45 countries that represent more than half of the worlds population. 

With minutes left in the match, thousands of Qatar supporters sang out in the stands and car horns blared around the city. That was certain to make the Games closing ceremonies which were scheduled to start an hour later an even bigger celebration. 

Qatar became the fourth host country to win the Asian Games title and the first since South Korea in 1986 in Seoul. Mohammed Bilal Rajabs inadvertent header in the 61st minute was the clincher. 

Earlier, Wang Zhizhi, who played for three NBA teams, including the Dallas Mavericks, without much success, scored 28 points to lead China to a 59-44 win over Qatar in the basketball gold medal game. 

Yi Jianlian, a star for the Chinese team often dubbed the next Yao Ming added eight points. Yi, who helped out with 15 rebounds, will be available for the NBA draft next June and is expected to be seriously considered by a number of teams. 

The loss ended Qatars strong showing at the games. It finished ninth at the last Asian Games four years ago, but former University of New Orleans coach Joey Stiebing has led the team to qualification for this years World Basketball Championship and its unexpected lengthy run before home fans in Doha. 

This tournament was very important to us and to finish second is a great accomplishment, said Stiebing. He said Wang is one of the premier players in Asia we didnt have an answer for him and that China played well as a team. 

There are five or six NBA scouts here to watch him, Stiebing said of Yi. But it was their other guys that played together. They are the dominant team in Asia and probably will be for a long time. (AP)

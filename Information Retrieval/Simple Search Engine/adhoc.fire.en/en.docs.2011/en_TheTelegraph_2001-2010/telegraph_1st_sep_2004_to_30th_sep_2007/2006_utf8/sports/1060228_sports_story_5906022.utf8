 Shoaib surgery today

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar will undergo surgery on both knees in Melbourne on Tuesday. 

PCB director Saleem Altaf said on Monday that Shoaib was diagnosed by Melbourne-based Dr David Young, who advised the speedster an immediate surgery. 

According to Dr Young, the knees are not in good shape at present and required immediate repair. 

The arthroscopic surgery will take place on Tuesday and, at least, it will require another eight weeks before the rehabilitation process can start, Altaf said. 

Shoaib had been carrying a niggle in the ankle since the start of the home series in October last year. 

Before the third one-day International against India earlier this month, he was diagnosed with stress fracture in the ankle.

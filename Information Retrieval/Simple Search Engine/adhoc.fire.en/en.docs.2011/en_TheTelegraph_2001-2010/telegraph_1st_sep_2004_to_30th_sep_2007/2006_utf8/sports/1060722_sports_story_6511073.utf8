 Series victory for India U-19 Yo Mahesh

 - Yo Mahesh hattrick, Ishants three floor English colts 

London: V. Yo Mahesh took a hattrick (3/30) after Ishant Sharma (3/29) castled the English top order to help India Under-19 secure a series-clinching nine-wicket win at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff. 

The tourists thus took an unassailable 2-0 lead on Thursday after winning the opening one-dayer of the three-match series by 41 runs. 

After dismissing the English colts for 164 in 44.5 overs, India A openers Uday Kaul and Parvez Aziz ensured an easy passage with a 125-run partnership. Aziz scored 79 (55 balls, 15x4), while Kaul remained unbeaten on 58 (85 balls, 7x4) as India A romped home in 29.2 overs with nine wickets to spare. 

Left-arm seamer Sharma provided a perfect start by dismissing openers Varun Chopra and Moeen Ali. In-form skipper Chopra was back in the pavilion with six runs on the board and the hosts didnt recover from that setback. 

Sumit Sharma, Shahbaz Nadeem, Abu Nechim Ahmed and Ravi Teja got a wicket apiece before Mahesh polished off the tail in three balls. His first victim was wicketkeeper Paul Dixey, followed by Andrew Miller and Steven Finn. 

In the first match, the Indians put up an allround show. Half-centuries by skipper Tanmay Srivastav (64), Uday Kaul (62) and Virat Kohli (64 ..) helped India put on 249 for four in 50 overs. The bowlersthe dismissed the hosts for 186 in 38.3 overs with Mahesh taking three for 35. (PTI)

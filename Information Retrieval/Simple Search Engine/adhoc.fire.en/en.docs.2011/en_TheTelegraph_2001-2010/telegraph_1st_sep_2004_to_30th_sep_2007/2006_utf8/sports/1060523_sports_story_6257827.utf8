 Itll be great to lift the trophy twice: Cafu

 - Kaka is just as important as Ronaldinho? Well win only as a team 

Few players in football history can boast such a successful career as the evergreen AC Milan defender Cafu, and the flying full-back is set to break even more records this summer in Germany. 

Having recently recovered from a successful knee operation, the 36-year-young Brazil captain is determined to prove he has lost none of his star quality at the World Cup. 

Already the most-capped player in Brazilian national team history, Cafu is just two games short of breaking the record number of World Cup appearances in the famous yellow shirt, currently held by his former colleagues Dunga and Taffarel (18). 

Having already won more World Cup games in Brazil colours than any other player (13), this summer in Germany could see Cafu equal Peles record tally of three World Cup wins (along with Ronaldo, a non-playing substitute at USA 94). The vastly experienced defender could also become the only man to have played in four consecutive World Cup finals and the first captain to lift the coveted trophy twice. 

Speaking to FIFAworldcup.com shortly before the Brazil squad was announced, Cafu discussed his dreams, the competition he faces for the right-back spot, his plans for future, and the recipe for success in Germany. 

 Q With Brazils 

 opening World Cup match set to kick off in less than a month, 

 how are you feeling physically?

 A Really good. 

 I had some injury problems about three months ago, but I 

 had a successful operation and now Im back to my best. 

 Id say about 98 per cent fit, so by the time the World 

 Cup comes around I should be 100 per cent. 

 This tournament could see 

 you breaking a number of records: the most appearances for 

 Brazil in World Cup history, the first player to play in 

 four World Cup finals, and the only captain to lift the 

 trophy twice. Have you given these records much thought? 

To be perfectly honest, I have. It would be a great honour to break any of these records, especially if I was the first captain to lift the trophy twice. Being in this position merely goes to show how much work Ive put in throughout my career, any records I break will be the fruit of that hard graft. However, its vital we remember to take things one step at a time. Before I can start thinking about breaking any records, we have to make sure we qualify from our group and then take each game as it comes. 

 Dida, Cafu, Lucio, Roberto 

 Carlos, Emerson, Ze Roberto, Kaka, Ronaldinho, Adriano and 

 Ronaldo. How do you compare the current Brazil side with 

 the team that won in 2002? 

You cant compare the two teams, especially as we dont yet know if that will be the starting XI in Germany. I also prefer not to talk about any individual players. All I can say is that Brazil won in 2002, and we will be hoping to do the same this year. 

 How do (Luiz Felipe) Scolari 

 and Parreira differ? 

Theres no real difference. Both have won the World Cup so theyre both winners. Naturally they favour different styles of management but the pair of them are first-class coaches. 

 Which manager has had the 

 biggest influence on your career? 

Tele Santana. Without a shadow of doubt. His recent death hit me really hard. I spoke to his daughter only recently when he was still seriously ill. Its a terrible shame. Brazilian football has undoubtedly lost one of its biggest names. 

 You will celebrate your 

 36th birthday just prior to the meet and have just extended 

 your contract at Milan. How much longer will we be able 

 to enjoy seeing you in action? 

I still dont know. As you said, Ive just extended my contract with Milan for another season and as long as Im feeling good, then Ill keep on playing. 

 When did you decide to 

 pay a special tribute to your wife and your neighbourhood 

 in Sao Paulo after lifting the trophy in 2002? (He wore 

 a T-shirt with the name of the neighbourhood, Jardim Irene, 

 and shouted his wife Reginas name as he lifted the 

 Cup) 

I just thought of it there and then, it was all very spontaneous. I think thats why it was so special. That gesture really had a lot of impact. 

 Do you already have something 

 in mind for this years tournament? 

No, I havent thought of anything yet. 

 Ronaldinho is the man currently 

 grabbing all the headlines, but just how important is your 

 Milan teammate, Kaka? 

I think Kaka is just as important as Ronaldinho, just as all the rest of us are too. Basically, I dont think that theres any one player who is more important than anyone else. We will only win in Germany if we play together as a team. Great team spirit and a winning mentality are even more important than technical ability.

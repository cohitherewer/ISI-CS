The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians hope to fire on ice

 - Nayeem would prefer a 4-5-1 formation 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nayeem will opt for ultra-defensive tactics 

New Delhi: Poor Fifa ranking, biting cold and a relatively inexperienced side could leave India with a mountain to climb when they take on Zicos Japan in the Asian Cup qualifiers in Yokohamas World Cup Stadium on Wednesday. 

The last meetings between the two teams ended in a 0-11 defeat for the Indians. Japan won 7-0 at home, then travelled to Calcutta to inflict another 4-0 humiliation. 

On paper, India hardly have the resources to put up even a decent fight, leave alone upstaging the giants of Asian football. While the difference of Fifa rankings is 100, there is no player in the team, barring Bhaichung Bhutia, who played against Japan the last time. To add to Indias woe, the temperature in Yokohama at the moment is below 3 degree centigrade. 

The manager of the Indian team, PK Banerjee, however, is not ready to take things lying down. When asked about his plans, the former India skipper said that he and coach Syed Nayeemuddin would prefer to go for a 4-5-1 formation. We will keep them at bay as far as possible, he said rather guardedly. Nayeemuddin admitted that he had never experienced such cold before an international match. But those who have been selected to play for India should be ready to play on fire or ice. 

Bravado apart, Nayeemuddin will no doubt opt for an ultra defensive tactics to frustrate Japan as far as possible. All heavy bodied defenders like Mehrajuddin, Sanjeev Maria and Manjit Singh are likely to be fielded in an effort to hold the rampaging Japanese strikers as far as possible. 

Banerjee said that India will don white jerseys with black inners. It may look little odd, but Japan turned down our request of swapping colours. I felt bad as they were bit rude, but thats the way professional football is played these days. I only hope our boys give them a fitting reply on the field. 

 First XI (Likely): Sandeep 

 Nandy, M. Suresh, NP Pradeep, NS Manju and Mahesh Gawli; 

 Mehrajuddin Wadao, Sanjeev Maria, Mehtab Hussain and Manjit 

 Singh; Syed Rahim Nabi and Bhaichung Bhutia.

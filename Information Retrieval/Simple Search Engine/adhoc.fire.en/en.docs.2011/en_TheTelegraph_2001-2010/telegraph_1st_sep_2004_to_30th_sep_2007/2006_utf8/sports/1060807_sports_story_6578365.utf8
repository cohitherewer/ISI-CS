 Sachin fit: BCCI secy

 - Malaysia-Singapore meet from Sept.12-24 

 Sachin 

Ahmedabad: Sachin Tendulkar is fully fit, Niranjan Shah said on Sunday, adding that the BCCI believes in the integrity of the batsman and the accuracy of team physio John Glosters report. 

I think Sachin is fit to play cricket. Sachin is such a player that if he feels he is not fully fit, he will not take part, the BCCI secretary said here. 

The board will go by the report of Gloster, Shah added. 

Interestingly, coach Greg Chappell had said two days ago that Sachin was ready to play but not absolutely 100 per cent fit and cant do long distance throwing. 

Sachin is returning after a long lay-off following a shoulder surgery. 

One thing everybody has to bear in mind is that Sachin has just come off a major surgery and rehabilitation programme, Shah said. 

The tri-series in Sri Lanka, from August 14-29, would be Sachins first assignment for Team India since the third and final Test against England in March. 

The Mumbaikar missed the ODI series against England and the entire tour of the West Indies. 

Regarding Chappells comments on Irfan Pathan, Shah said: He is a little tired. But we need him as a fast bowler. 

Shah said the Malaysia-Singapore tri-series featuring Australia, the West Indies and India will be held from September 12 to September 24. 

All matches will be played under lights. Singapore and Kuala Lumpur will split the six round-robin matches, while the seventh game (the final) would be played in Kuala Lumpur. (PTI)

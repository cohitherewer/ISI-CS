The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No total is safe, says Paras Mhambrey

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The listless track at the Eden remained the topic of discussion on Friday. 

This has always happened with teams enjoying the home advantage That is why the BCCI is mulling to host matches on neutral venues, Mumbai coach Pravin Amre said. 

Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey said: Youve got to prepare according to the situation. Any home side will always look to play to its strengths. But BCCI has to look at the bigger picture and act accordingly. 

BCCI, it may be recalled, is exploring the option of holding Ranji Trophy semi-finals and final on neutral venues in a bid to add more competitiveness to the contest. 

Mhambrey termed it as a good wicket to bat on where nothing could be said to be a safe total. 

There is little bounce and that makes scoring very difficult. Under the circumstances, I think weve done well, Mhambrey added. 

According to him, the next plan is to not lose any more wicket till lunch on the second day. It things fall according to plan, we might be able to chalk out a fresh strategy. 

Amitava Chakraborty (81) was disappointed at his dismissal after having done all the good work. It was a poor shot selection, he lamented.

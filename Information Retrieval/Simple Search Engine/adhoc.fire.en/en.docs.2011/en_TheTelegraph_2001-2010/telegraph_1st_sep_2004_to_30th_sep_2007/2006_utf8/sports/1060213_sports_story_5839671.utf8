New Delhi: Indias Shiva Keshavan was placed 29th after two rounds in the mens singles luge event at the Winter Olympics in Turin. 

Keshavan clocked a total time of 1:46.701 with the final two legs, according to information received here. He could not make the most of a good start as he struggled at a curve which obstructed his slide. 

I started off well the first run, but ran into some trouble in the bottom of the track... I had been having trouble at the curve 15 even during the training runs this week, and I could not overcome this obstacle because I was not relaxed enough, Keshavan said. 

He finished his first run on the sledge with a timing of 53.729, but made amends in the second by clocking 52.972. 

The second run was much better. I told myself to relax and concentrate. My finish time was one second better than the first, he said. 

Armin Zoeggeler of Italy (1:43.132) and Russias Albert Demtschenko (1:43.410) were placed first and second, respectively, while Tony Benshoof of US (1:43.365) occupied the third spot at the halfway stage of the four-leg event.

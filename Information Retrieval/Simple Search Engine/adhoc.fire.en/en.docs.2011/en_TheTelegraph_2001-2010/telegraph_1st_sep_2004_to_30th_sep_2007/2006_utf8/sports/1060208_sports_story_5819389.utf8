 Turkey get severe punishment

London: Turkey have been ordered to play their next six home matches at a neutral ground and behind closed doors following a fracas at their World Cup qualifier against Switzerland in Istanbul. 

Fifa said in a statement on Tuesday that two Turkish players, Alpay Ozalan and Emre Belozoglu, would be banned for six matches as would Switzerlands Benjamin Huggel who admitted kicking Turkish assistant coach Mehmet Ozdilek. 

The sanctions, which apply to official matches and not friendlies, are among the most severe handed out to a national association and will hit Turkeys chances of qualifying for the next European championship in 2008. 

Huggel will be suspended for all of Switzerlands World Cup matches in Germany, unless they reach the final, and is also likely to miss games at Euro 2008. 

Switzerland won the two-leg play-off to qualify for this years World Cup, starting in June, at the expense of Turkey, semi-finalists in 2002. 

Ozdilek has been ordered to stay away from soccer for 12 months for his part in the incidents last November. He resigned after television pictures showed him attempting to trip a Swiss player as they left the pitch. 

Turkey were also fined 200,000 Swiss francs ($154,200). (Reuters)

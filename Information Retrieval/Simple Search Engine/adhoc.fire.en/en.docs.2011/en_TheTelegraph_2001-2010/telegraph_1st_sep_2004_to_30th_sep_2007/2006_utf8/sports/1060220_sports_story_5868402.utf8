 McEnroe defies age to enter doubles final

 - Murray upsets Roddick to face Hewitt in title clash 

 McEnroe and Bjorkman defeated Levinsky and Lindstedt 6-3, 4-6, 10-8 

San Jose: John McEnroe moved to within one victory of his first doubles title since 1994 when he reached the SAP Open final on Saturday with Swedens Jonas Bjorkman. 

McEnroe, 47, who retired from the main tour in 1992, and Bjorkman came back from 7-5 down in the deciding match tie-break to defeat Czech Jaroslav Levinsky and Swede Robert Lindstedt 6-3, 4-6, 10-8. 

Paul Goldstein and Jim Thomas now meet McEnroe and Bjorkman after the American pair ousted top seeds Simon Aspelin and Todd Perry 6-3 6-7 10-3. 

Id like to make a request, only my mother can call me Johnny, a playful McEnroe said. Im 47 now and people are going come on Johnny. 

This should be interesting and weve come this far so we might as well go all the way. Both McEnroe and Bjorkman have been ranked number one in the world in doubles. McEnroe has won 69 doubles titles and Bjorkman 44 in his career. 

McEnroe and Bjorkman struggled to contain the big serving of Levinsky and Lindstedt. The 33-year-old Swede said all they could do was wait for a chance and take it when it arrived. We just stayed calm, said Bjorkman. They were serving huge and we couldnt really do anything. 

We were waiting for opportunities and we were hoping to get a few chances and, once we got one, we managed to stay in it. 

Meanwhile in the singles, British teenager Andrew Murray pulled off the biggest win of his career when he upset top seed Andy Roddick 7-5, 7-5 to reach the SAP Open final on Saturday. 

The 18-year-old Scot dominated the world number three with an aggressive all-round performance and will next face Australian Lleyton Hewitt, who beat American Vince Spadea 6-3 6-4 to reach the final. 

I was almost a little sick because of nerves but in the end I came though, said Murray, the world number 60, after his first victory over a player ranked in the top 10.

 Klinsmann ideal for US: Pele

Berlin: Former Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann would be an ideal choice for the US, Pele said in Germany on Thursday. 

Hed be good for the US boys, the Brazilian World Cup great told a news conference while on a business trip to Duesseldorf. 

Hes an excellent trainer who led Germany to an incredible World Cup this year. He didnt quite have the fortune he needed to win the title. I think hed be the right man for the job, Pele was quoted as saying by German sport news agency. 

Last month, US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati said he had talked to Klinsmann, who lives in California, about coaching the national team but no agreement had been reached. 

Klinsmann, who steered Germany to the World Cup semi-finals in July, has expressed an interest in replacing Bruce Arena, whose contract was not renewed after eight years coaching the national team. Gulati said a decision was expected in December. 

An opinion poll by a television station in Germany on Thursday found that 74 per cent of Germans would be pleased if Klinsmann took the US job even though the popular coach shocked the nation when stepped down at the end of the World Cup.

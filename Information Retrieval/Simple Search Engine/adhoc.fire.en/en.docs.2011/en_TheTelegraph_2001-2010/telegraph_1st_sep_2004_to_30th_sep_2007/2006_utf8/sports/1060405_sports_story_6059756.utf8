 AIFF to introduce licensing system for clubs 

 - India should import players instead of recruiting mediocre ones: Velappan

New Delhi: Fransa Pax Club management may have got away by disbanding their club midway through the National Football League, but the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is determined to see it is not repeated again. 

In an attempt to make it binding for the participating teams to follow the rules and regulations of the NFL, the AIFF has decided to introduce licensing system for the clubs from the next season. 

This was announced by the Asian Football Confederation general secretary Peter Velappan and his Indian counterpart Alberto Colaco in a press conference here on Tuesday. 

Speaking at the end of the two-day Vision India Club Development Workshop at the AIFF House, Velappan said it was a mistake to admit Fransa Club to the NFL in the first place. They were a club of amateur set up, who were playing in a professional league. 

Velappan said that under the licensing system, the clubs will not be invited, but will have to apply to play in the league. 

In that case, the clubs will also have to sign an agreement with the federation. To follow rules will be mandatory for them. Severe fines and other penalties will be imposed if they fail to follow them, he said. 

Colaco said the first draft of licensing system will be ready by the end of the week and will be discussed with the clubs. 

Initially we wont be as strict as it is in European countries, but will tighten grip later. 

Velappan said he was not too impressed by the attempts of the Indian clubs to recruit sub-standard foreigners for winning domestic tournaments. 

India is a country of 1.1 billion. It has progressed a lot at the economic front. Why not football should also gain from it? India has a football history for more than 100 years. They should import players instead of recruiting some mediocre players. 

The AFC secretary said there are some Asian countries, who believe in building the house from the top. 

They spent 80 per cent of their budget on the national team and ignore the development at the grassroot level. 

Asked whether he considers that India also fall in the same bracket, Velappan said: there was no need for India to hold long camps for the preparations of the national team. 

In India there is enough football. Footballers play for sometimes eight months at a stretch. Camps should not be held for more than two to three weeks, said Velappan.

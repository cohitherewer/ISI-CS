 Wariner, Powell shine

Stockholm: Asafa Powell and Jeremy Wariner broke Olympic Stadium records on Tuesday at the DN Galan meet, with each athlete picking up a 1-carat diamond prize. 

Powell took the race in 9.86 beating Maurice Greenes 1999 mark by one-hundredth of a second, ahead of Americans Tyson Gay (9.97) and Marcus Brunson (10.09). 

Wariner won the 400 in 44.02. Fellow-American Alvin Harrison set the previous 400m mark of 44.57 in 2002. 

Wariner, the Olympic and world champion, finished 0.51 ahead of Gary Kikaya. 

Any athlete who breaks the stadium record earns a diamond valued at $10,000 (euro 8,300). (AP)

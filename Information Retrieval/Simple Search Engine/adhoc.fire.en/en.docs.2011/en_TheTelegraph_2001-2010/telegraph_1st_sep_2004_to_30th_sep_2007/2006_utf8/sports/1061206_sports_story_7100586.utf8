 Asif waits for selectors call 

Karachi: Mohammed Asif on Tuesday said the verdict had given his career a fresh lease of life and he was raring to make it to the national team at the earliest. 

I have been playing club cricket (to keep myself match fit). It is up to the selectors to decide when they want to call me up. I will start playing domestic cricket as soon as possible, a beaming Asif said. 

He said he had been spending sleepless nights since he and Shoaib Akhtra were named as dope offenders, but did not realise the enormity of the situation until he was banned. 

But I didnt give up hope and my mother and the rest of my family were a big source of strength for me. Some Pakistan Cricket Board members also helped me a lot. 

The swing bowler also said he was willing to undergo another test to prove his innocence further. (PTI)

 Jeev in sole second spot

Shizuoka: A double bogey on his second nine spoilt what could have been a perfect start in difficult conditions for Jeev Milkha Singh at the Coca Cola Tokai Classic at the Miyoshi Country Club West Golf Course on Thursday. 

The Indian ace continued his amazing Japanese run as he shot a two-under 69 on the opening day to be sole second. 

Jeev, looking to get into the top-10 of the Japan Tour for the first time, was one shot adrift of the sole leader nobuhito sato, who brought in a flawless three-under 68.

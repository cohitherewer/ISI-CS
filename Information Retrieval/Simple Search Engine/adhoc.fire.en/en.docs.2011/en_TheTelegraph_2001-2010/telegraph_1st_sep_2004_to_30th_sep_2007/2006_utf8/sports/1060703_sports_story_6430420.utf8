 DAY II HIGHLIGHTS

 Only one bowler has claimed a five-wicket haul in 

Tests while requiring fewer overs than Harbhajan Singhs five for 13 in just 

4.3 overs (27 balls). Australias left-arm medium pacer Ernie Toshack had 

claimed five for 2 in 2.3 (19 balls in eight-ball overs) against India in Brisbane 

in1947-48. In fact, Harbhajan equalled South African Jacques Kallis effort 

of five for 21 in 4.3 overs against Bangladesh in Potchefstroom in 2002-03. For 

the record, the previous quickest five-wicket haul for India came from leggie 

Subash Gupte, who claimed five for 18 in 6 overs (36 balls) against Pakistan in 

Dacca (now Dhaka) in 1954-55. 

 Incidentally, only one Indian bowler has claimed 

a five-wicket haul while conceding lesser runs than Harbhajan ? left-armer Venkatapathy 

Rajus six for 12 ? against Sri Lanka in Chandigarh in 1990-91. 

 West Indies 103 was their lowest-ever against 

India expunging their previous lowest of 127 in Delhi in 1987-88. It was also 

their lowest at home against India ? the previous lowest being the 140 in Bridgetown 

in 1996-97. Interestingly, the Windies won both the Delhi and Bridgetown Tests 

despitethe low scores. 

 Brian Laras five fours during his 

brief knock of 26 runs, has taken his career tally of fours to 1500. 

He thus became the first batsman in Test history to do so. Indias Sachin 

Tendulkar follows him with 1395 career fours. 

 Rahul Dravid (when on 19) became the sixth batsman 

in Test history to aggregate 9000 runs. By achieving this feat in just 176 innings 

(and 104 matches), he becomes the quickest among the six batsman to reach the 

landmark in least number of innings. Incidentally, Lara needed 177 innings (and 

101 matches) to reach his milestone in 2003-04. 

 Later, Dravid (on 22) became the first batsman during 

this calendar year to reach 1000 runs in Tests. This was the only second time 

in his career he is achieving this feat after his 1357 runs in 16 matches in 2002. 

 Dravid has now made 490 runs in this series in 4 

Tests. This is now the most runs made in an away series by an Indian 

captain. Sunny Gavaskar had made 434 runs in 6 Tests in Pakistan in 1982-83. 

 Brian Lara has now 159 catches in Tests. Only Australian 

Mark Waugh hasmore Test catches ? 181.

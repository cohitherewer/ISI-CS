Kuala Lumpur: India whipped Malaysia 5-2 in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup at the Bukit Jalil Stadium on Monday. Hari Prasad (13th minute), Gagan Ajit Singh (22nd, 56th), Sandeep Singh (39th) and Tushar Khandekar (54th) scored for India who had lost their opener to Australia 1-4. 

The Malaysians, showing some spirit, scored through Azlan Misron (44th) and Jiwa Mohan (47th) but wasted five of the six penalty corners they earned. 

Earlier, Korea upset Australia 3-0 and Pakistan posted a 3-2 win over Holland.

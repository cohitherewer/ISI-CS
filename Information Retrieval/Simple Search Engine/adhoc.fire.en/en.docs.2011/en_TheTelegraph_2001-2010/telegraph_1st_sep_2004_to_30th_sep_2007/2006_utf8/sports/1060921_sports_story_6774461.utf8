 SA put up 418/5

 Boucher 

Potchefstroom: Mark Boucher blasted South Africas fastest one-day century with a brutal assault on Zimbabwe in the third limited overs International on Wednesday. 

South Africa, who won the toss and chose to bat, made their second-highest total and the fourth-highest overall in scoring 418 for five. 

Boucher smashed an undefeated 147 off 68 balls with eight fours and 10 sixes. 

He reached his maiden one-day century off 44 balls, beating the 79 balls Herschelle Gibbs needed to reach three figures against Australia in Johannesburg in March. 

Bouchers century was also the second fastest in one-day cricket history behind Shahid Afridis 37-ball epic for Pakistan against Sri Lanka in Nairobi in October, 1996. 

Loots Bosman and Alviro Petersen launched South Africas innings with an opening stand of 160 that ended in the 21st over when leg-spinner Tafadzwa Kamungozi had Bosman stumped by wicketkeeper Brendan Taylor. 

Bosman scored his 88 off 70 balls with 11 fours and three sixes. 

Petersen faced 74 balls and hit 10 fours and a six for his 80 before offering off-spinner Prosper Utseya a gentle return catch. 

Boucher joined Jacques Kallis to add 91 for the third wicket in a stand that had the Zimbabweans fetching the ball from the boundary all around the ground. 

Kallis was dismissed for 50 when he tried to smash a delivery from Utseya through the on-side and sent a catch looping off the leading edge of his bat to Elton Chigumbura at short third man. 

Boucher went to his century in style in the 43rd over when he hoisted a ball from medium pacer Justice Chibhabha over long-on for six. 

JP Duminy, who was 24 not out, helped Boucher add 67 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket.

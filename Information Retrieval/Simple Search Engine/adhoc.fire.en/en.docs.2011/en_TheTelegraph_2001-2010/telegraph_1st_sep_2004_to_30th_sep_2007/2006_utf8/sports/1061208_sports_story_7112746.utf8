Calcutta: The disappointment at not getting a hundred in my comeback match will remain, but Im happy that I got 83 

That was Sourav Gangulys reaction when The Telegraph contacted him at the Willows Garden Hotel in Potchefstroom, late on Thursday, soon after the team got back from Sedgars Park. 

Asked whether it took him time to settle down, he replied: Well, as I played, I grew in confidence and got better Youve got to remember I just got in a couple of days ago. 

Souravs last appearance for India, in any form, was in the Karachi Test as many as ten months ago. 

What were his thoughts when he took guard at 37 for three? 

Souravs answer was business-like: To get as many runs as I could Of course, I didnt set a target Unfortunately, we kept losing wickets 

Commenting on the surface, he said: I would say it was a typical South African wicket Had bounce and the ball seamed. 

Sourav had much praise for centurion Irfan Pathan, whod made his India debut under him three years ago. 

Irfan batted beautifully He didnt allow the situation to get to him It was nice watching him from the other end 

Sourav and Pathan added a chunky 139 for the sixth-wicket.

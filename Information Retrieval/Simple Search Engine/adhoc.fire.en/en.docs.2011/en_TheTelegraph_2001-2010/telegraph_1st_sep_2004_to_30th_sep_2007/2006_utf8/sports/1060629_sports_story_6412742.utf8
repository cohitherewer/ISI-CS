 The old wily fox used all its 

 cunning to wear down and devour a spirited prey. Spain had 

 raised visions of a never-before campaign with an impressive 

 all-win record in the group league stage. Even on Tuesday 

 night, they looked good in parts and led till 40 minutes 

 before being outwitted by Zidane amp; Co. What was the 

 secret of this French turnaround, a team that looked lifeless 

 and dispirited in the three league games?

 If you had a look at the picture 

 of Zidane and Henry embracing each other, youll know 

 the answer. The two top stars, not known for their camaraderie 

 on field, were savouring the teams success like teenagers. 

 And this, after Zidane scored a memorable goal to round 

 off the tally and Henry went out empty-handed two minutes 

 before the final whistle. There was no clash of egos, no 

 hard feelings.

 Coach Domenech, at the receiving 

 end of loads of criticism, had finally managed to convince 

 a team of talented individuals to forget everything petty 

 and put their heads together for the cause of Les Bleus.

 Spain may have been on a high, 

 but they dont have the quality France boast of. Starting 

 from Barthez, Sagnol, Thuram, Gallas, to the likes of Makelele, 

 Zidane, Vieira and Henry, the Frenchmen had heavy ammunition 

 in their armoury. Add the young legs of Ribery, and you 

 have a very potent combination ? provided, of course, the 

 big guns are in the mood to fire.

 Well, all of them did play a role 

 for the first time in the tournament and, overnight, France 

 looked like a cohesive unit. Barthez turned the clock back 

 with some superb anticipations. The defence was efficient, 

 the threat of Torres was well handled. Zidane, despite being 

 a couple of steps slower, still delivered some telling passes, 

 curled in a wicked free-kick (which set up the second goal) 

 and even scored a magical goal.

 The way Zidane cut in from the 

 left, rounded off Puyol and buried the ball past Casillas 

 would embarrass many a leading striker in this competition. 

 That goal came in stoppage time, 10 minutes after Vieira 

 had nodded home a Zidane free-kick from the back post. The 

 ball went in off a defenders leg, reflecting the terror 

 the Frenchmen had created in the Spanish citadel in the 

 final 10 minutes or so.

 It was Vieira who drove the French 

 machine on Tuesday. He contributed in defence, spoiled many 

 a Spanish build-up in midfield and moved up to look for 

 goals as well. He had an able commander in Ribery who used 

 his speed to rattle the defence.

 Henry had another poor match as 

 key striker. He came through more as a provider and produced 

 a clever piece of dummy to fool the opposition 

 and set up the equaliser.

 Ribery, playing a 1-2 with Vieira, 

 timed his run to perfection and coolly slotted home after 

 turning past Casillas. But that would have come to nought 

 if Henry, standing in an off-side position on the left channel, 

 hadnt checked himself when Vieira released Ribery 

 down the middle.

 The Spaniards had successfully 

 laid the off-side trap five-six times in the opening half, 

 but this time, Henry was far too clever and it was his chance 

 to catch the rivals napping. That one incident summed up 

 the trend of the match: the French played clever, tactical 

 football to out-think the Spanish.

 Its Brazil up next for France, 

 a potentially classic match-up. Brazil will be out to wipe 

 off those dark Parisian memories of 1998 and I think they 

 will succeed. If Robinho can start, Brazil will have a definite 

 edge. I think France have played their best match, they 

 wont be able to repeat the Tuesday show.

 Ballack to return vs Poland 

Berlin: It was time for tennis and basketball and lounging in the sun that must have reminded Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann of his California home. 

Klinsmann had another reason to be in a good mood Sunday ? captain Michael Ballack is recovering well from the muscle injury in his right calf and is all but confirmed for Wednesdays match against Poland in Dortmund. 

The healing process is going great, we are watching him very closely, Klinsmann said. The doctors are very pleased and we assume hell play against Poland. 

Ballack missed Fridays 4-2 win over Costa Rica because Klinsmann did not want to take the risk of aggravating the captains injury and resisted Ballacks pleas to play in the opening match of the World Cup. 

While the rest of the players relaxed by playing tennis or basketball, the captain spent Sunday morning on the fitness bike and jogging. 

On Sunday, Klinsmann gave the players the rest of the day off. (AP)

 Sourav, Laxman need to be consistent: Vengsarkar

 Dilip Vengsarkar

Mumbai: Sourav Ganguly and VVS Laxman need to show more consistency if they hope to regain their place in Indias one-day squad, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar said Wednesday. 

Vengsarkar said Laxman also had to work on his fitness to be considered for selection in the shorter version of the game. 

Laxman is a fantastic player and I am a huge fan of his. But his fitness for the one-day game is not up to the mark. Laxman and Sourav need to show more consistency, but that holds good for everyone, Vengsarkar said while reacting to the former India captains 118 for East Zone against North in the Duleep Trophy. 

Vengsarkar said he was happy that players like Robin Uthappa, Yashpal Singh, Gautam Gambhir and Rohan Gavaskar were also among runs. 

Asked about his recent comment that there was no talent emerging from the country, Vengsarkar said he had been misunderstood a bit. What I said was that there was no new talent good enough to immediately make it to the Indian team right away. I never said there was no talent, he said. 

Vengsarkar also felt that had India made the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy they would have won the title. If they had entered the semi-finals, it would have been anybodys game. Their exit was a big blow. 

He said the Twenty20 format was crucial to the spread of cricket in countries not familiar with the game like the US and China as it encapsulates everything good about cricket in a short time. (PTI)

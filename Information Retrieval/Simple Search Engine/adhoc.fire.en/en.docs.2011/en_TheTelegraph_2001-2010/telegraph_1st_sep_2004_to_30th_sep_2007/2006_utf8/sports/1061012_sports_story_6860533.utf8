Moscow: Two late goals gave Russia coach Guus Hiddink his first competitive victory in a 2-0 win over Estonia on Wednesday in European Championship qualifying. 

Substitutes Pavel Pogrebnyak scored in the 78th minute and Dmitry Sychev added another goal in injury time. The visitors were reduced to 10 men when Raio Piiroja was sent off in the 89th minute. 

Russia have five points from three games in Group E, and Estonia have lost all three matches. 

In Minsk, Sergei Kornilenko scored twice as Belarus came from behind to beat Slovenia 4-2 for an impressive first win in a Group G qualifier. 

Belarus went ahead in the 17th minute when Denis Kovba scored from Kornilenkos pass but the Slovenians levelled within 30 seconds when Bostjan Cesar drove the ball into the bottom left corner. Klemen Lavric sent Slovenia into the halftime break 2-1 up when he headed in Robert Korens right-wing cross in the 43rd minute. (Agencies)

 Pfister fate hangs in balance

Frankfurt: Togo said on Tuesday they would decide within 24 hours whether to stick with Otto Pfister as coach after a chaotic build-up to the World Cup was followed by a 1-2 defeat in their opening game. 

Pfister walked out on them last Friday amid a players pay dispute but returned this week to take his place on the bench as the team lost to South Korea on Tuesday. 

The saga appears to have left a lot of bad blood. I dont know for the moment, the Togolese Football Associations Secretary-General Assogbavi Komlan said when asked who would coach Togo in their next World Cup match against Switzerland on June 19. 

Meanwhile, More than a million South Koreans took to the streets on Tuesday to dance, bang drums and cheer their team to the win over Togo. 

South Korea coach Dick Advocaat said his players never panicked despite falling behind. Pfister said his side paid the price for not putting away their chances.

New Delhi: National champion Subhajit Saha, Soumyadeep Roy and Poulami Ghatak entered the main round of the singles draw of Chile Open Table Tennis Championship in Santiago after passing the qualifying hurdle. 

Achantha Sharath Kamal, who became the first Indian paddler to reach the semi-finals of a pro-tour event in Brazil Open last week, has already got a direct entry into the main draw where he will face David Zambori of Hungary. 

After a dismal performance in the world team meet both the mens and womens teams are trying to prove their mettle.

 Houghton favourite to take charge

 - British coach recalls spectacular Vijayan 

 in Bangkok Asian Games 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Fifty-eight-year-old British coach Bob Houghton emerged the favourite to become the chief coach of the Indian football team after he and former Republic of Ireland manager Brian Kerr appeared for an interview with the technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) here on Wednesday. 

While the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that the federation would still wait for a few days for the other two coaches ? Ian Porterfield and Clemance Westerhoff ? before dismissing them as no-shows, sources said the two are unlikely to come. It means the federation will be left with no other choice but to decide between Houghton and Kerr. 

The AIFF, in all probability, will take a final decision on this subject in the next couple of days. 

Houghton, who helped China realise their World Cup dream, it seems, has received more votes when the technical committee members met in the evening to review the interviews of the two coaches. Houghton is believed to have got the nod because of his vast experience in working with different national teams in Asia. 

Houghton, sources said, will also not object if the federation decides to attach Indian coaches and physical trainer as support staff with him. 

Kerr, who has quoted a very high salary, has made it clear that he would like to bring an assistant coach and a physical trainer along with him. 

Houghton, who was interviewed for around 75 minutes by the technical committee comprising C.R. Vishwanathan, Pradip Chowdhury, Henry Menezes and Mohammed Habib, later said he had followed the Indian football team quite keenly during the 1998 Asian Games in Bangkok. 

I was coaching China then. I watched four matches of the Indian team in the Asian Games. The only player I remember is I.M. Vijayan. He was very skilful and spectacular. 

While Houghton was quite surprised to know that Vijayan has been pursuing a career in films these days and even contested elections, he felt there must be a fair number of budding Vijayans in India, who have not been spotted. 

India is too big a country and it must have thousands of talented footballers. All you have to do is bring them into the limelight and give them proper facilities, Houghton, who became famous after taking Swedish club Malmo to the European Cup final, said. I am sure we can do that. 

Houghton, who calls himself a modern global coach, having plied his trade outside the United Kingdom for almost 30 years, was surprised to know that India would play a tournament in Canada in July. I think it would have been better to play friendly matches in some of the Gulf countries. Going to Canada a few months before the Asian Games may not really serve the purpose, he said. 

The AIFF, however, has told him that the camp for the Canada tournament will be held in Goa from June 20.

 Biswajit wary of Dempo trio

 - Sangram a doubtful starter in todays semi-final

 Ndem is likely to be back in midfield 

New Delhi: Biswajit Bhattacharya won several battles for Mohun Bagan at the Ambedkar Stadium. As coach of the same green-and-maroon outfit, he was extremely cautious on Friday, the eve of the Durand Cup semi-final clash against Dempo. 

He has reasons to be wary. Mohun Bagan won two matches out of three in the quarter-final group league action, without looking too convincing. Adding to the coachs worry is the fact that goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee is a doubtful starter while Jose Ramirez Barreto is nursing an ankle injury. 

Barreto did not practise on Friday, but will surely take the field against Dempo, said Bhattacharya. Mukherjee is fighting hard to recover from a calf muscle injury. On Friday, Bhattacharya did not take any chance and gave reserve goalkeeper Shilton Paul a full-fledged practice session. 

Bhattacharya has identified three players as key men in the Dempo ranks. We have to keep an eye on Ranty Martins, Beto and Clifford Miranda. The Dempo attacks revolve around them, the coach said. 

While Gautam Debnath will return to the Mohun Bagan defence in place of Ravanan, Dulal Biswas and Ndem Guy Herve will also be back in midfield. Barreto wants Ndem in the middle as he considers the Nigerian to be a better passer. 

In the forwardline, the man to partner Barreto could be Surojit Bose, who struck the winner against Air India. 

The Mohun Bagan coach said Mehtab Hussains arrival has made a world of difference to the team. We needed a leader in midfield. Mehtab can inspire the juniors. 

Dempo assistant coach Maurice Afonso said his boys will play their natural game. A team which has Barreto is always dangerous, but not unbeatable. 

The second semi-final will pit JCT against Sporting Clube de Goa. The millmen from Phagwara will go into the match with a slight edge, riding on the confidence they gained from the 4-0 rout of East Bengal the other day.

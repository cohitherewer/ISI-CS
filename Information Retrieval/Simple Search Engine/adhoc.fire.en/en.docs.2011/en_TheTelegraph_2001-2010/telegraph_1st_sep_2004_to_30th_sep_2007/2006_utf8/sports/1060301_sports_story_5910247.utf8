The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I wont rush back: Vaughan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: England captain Michael Vaughan is adamant that the knee injury is not a career-threatening one. The 31-year-old, however, insisted he wont rush his recovery. 

I certainly wont rush back. If it is possible, in three weeks I can come back and play the one-day games I will do that, but I certainly wont do that if theres any chance I could end up like I did , he told the ECB website.

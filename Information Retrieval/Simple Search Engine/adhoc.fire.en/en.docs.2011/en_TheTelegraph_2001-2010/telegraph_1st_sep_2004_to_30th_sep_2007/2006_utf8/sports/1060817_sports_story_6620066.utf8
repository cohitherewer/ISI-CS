 Media rights allocation spurs BCCI profit

Chennai: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) made a profit of Rs 33 crore in the last financial year with a chunk of its income coming from media rights allocation. 

Treasurer N. Srinivasan said that the Boards income over expenditure has been Rs 29 crore more than the Rs 4 crore in 2004-05. 

He said the profit is mainly because of the media rights allocation which contributed Rs 342 crore. 

The Boards income during the last financial year was Rs 430 crore as compared to the previous years Rs 210 crore. 

In respect of the Pilcom account maintained at the Indian Overseas Bank in Calcutta, Srinivasan said the Boards auditors report on this matter was taken into record by the committee. 

During the course of the meeting, Boards auditor firm Billimoria and Company confirmed that Jagmohan Dalmiya was not empowered to transact or handle the Pilcom accounts, whose transactions were investigated by the Board, from the day he ceased to be the president of the Board, he said. 

Srinivasan said: The auditors informed that Dalmiya has submitted books related to the Pilcom accounts for scrutiny by the auditors and had said that all those expenses were recoverable from Pilcom. Board cannot pass any judgement on the nature of expenses. 

Meanwhile, the Board will take a tough stand on cricketers counterfeit clothing and accessories by keeping a strict vigil on those who are involved in it. 

Vice-president Lalit Modi said that the Board would take steps to check this trend all over the world. 

Modi said some reputed websites were involved in this act. 

Cricket portals like cricinfo and cricketworld are selling the clothing, DVDs, pictures and archives. We have to find ways to arrest this (menance), he said. 

Modi said Percept DMark has been authorised to organise BCCI ratings and award functions for a sum of Rs 30.12 crore for five years, but their bid for ground in-stadia advertisement for the tri-series involving the West Indies, Australia and India in Malaysia (in September) was not accepted. 

They were the only bidders for this. The Board found the offer to be low and decided to re-tender it next Friday in New Delhi, he said. 

On the launch of portal, Modi said software major Accenture has been approved as consultant and they will provide direction to the Board in this regard. 

The clothing and accessories for players contract has been extended to Pantaloon for four years for a sum of Rs 20 crore.

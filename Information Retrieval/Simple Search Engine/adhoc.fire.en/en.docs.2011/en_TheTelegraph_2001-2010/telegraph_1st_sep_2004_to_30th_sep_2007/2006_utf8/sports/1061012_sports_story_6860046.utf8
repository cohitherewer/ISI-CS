The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Berlin: The German football association (DFB) has opened an investigation into allegations that two England Under-21 players faced racist abuse by Germany players in a play-off match in Leverkusen on Tuesday. DFB spokesman Harald Stenger said on Wednesday that the association is interrogating players after England defenders Anton Ferdinand and Micah Richards were allegedly abused in the match.

 We are taking the accusations very seriously and are investigating their veracity, Stenger said. An Uefa spokesman said on Wednesday it was reserving comments until it received the match referee and delegate reports, which are expected by the end of the week.

 Rome: Juventus team manager Gianluca Pessotto did not intend to commit suicide when he fell from a window at club headquarters in June, his wife said in an interview. He didnt want to jump out. The doctors explained to me that it was a blackout, Reana said in an interview with a magazine to be published on Thursday. Something disconnected his mind that morning. If he was lucid, he would never have done it, quot; Reana said in her first interview since her husbands fall.

 Bogota: Former Colombia captain Carlos Valderrama said he is against the idea of a foreigner coaching the side. Argentine Marcelo Bielsa and Brazilian Paulo Autuori are among the favourites to replace Reinaldo Rueda. I dont like it, I think there are Colombian coaches who are capable of leading the national team, Valderrama said on Tuesday.

 Rueda is still officially in charge even though he has been put on unpaid leave for three months.

 Singapore: Iranian international striker Ali Daei has been appointed player-coach of Saipa after Werner Lorant quit for Turkish Super League club Erciyesspor. Former TSV 1860 Munich coach Lorant joined Saipa earlier this year and the German guided them to an early lead of the fledgling Iran Pro League.

 His departure came as a shock to Saipa management, who have installed Daei as a temporary measure. I have accepted the responsibility as we have important matches coming up, the Asian Football Confederations website quoted Daei as saying.

Spains Carlos Moya has been granted one of the other wild card entries.

 Beijing: Banned Chinese marathon runner Sun Yingjie has claimed she left her coach, Wang Dexian, because he beat her severely with a belt, local media reported on Wednesday.

 Madrid: Spanish rider Iban Mayo has agreed to leave the Euskaltel Euskadi cycling team and is close to signing a new deal with the Saunier Duval outfit.

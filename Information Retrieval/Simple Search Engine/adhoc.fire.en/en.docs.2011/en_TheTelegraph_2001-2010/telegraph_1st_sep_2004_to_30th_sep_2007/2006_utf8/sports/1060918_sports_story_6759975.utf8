 If Flintoff breaks down, England will be in big trouble

 Guest Column

 Ian Chappell

 When I first read the England 

 Ashes squad my reaction was that of the ubiquitous fearsome 

 rugby league forward, who when smashed in the jaw by an 

 opponent in the opening scrum, grins and says: Is 

 that the best youve got? 

However, not wanting to be a smart aleck and also mindful of a couple of atrocious 2005 Ashes predictions the thought didnt linger. It could also have been that, apart from one or two contentious issues, this was the best the England selectors could muster under trying circumstances. 

The most debatable decision was the captaincy. Under normal circumstances, Andrew Flintoff would have been an extremely capable replacement for the injured Michael Vaughan. However, with Flintoffs full recovery from an ankle operation expected to coincide with the departure date for Australia, Im not sure it was wise to burden the big fella with the captaincy. 

The three outstanding England captains in Australia have been Douglas Jardine, Len Hutton and Ray Illingworth. The common denominator with this triumvirate was their insistence on having a strong pace attack to seriously challenge Australian batsmen on bouncy pitches. On their tours that trio only had to cajole and guide the leather flingers while, in addition to performing those duties, Flintoff will also be expected to spearhead the attack. His desire to inspire his teammates may see Flintoff over-bowling himself and, if he breaks down, England are in big trouble. This will be Andrew Strauss greatest challenge; monitoring and controlling Flintoffs bowling load without hectoring the man most likely to ensure England retain the Ashes. 

The other decision that could backfire on England is the choice of Ashley Giles. This is partly because he will have had so little cricket in the lead-up to the series, but it also reflects the selectors concerns about balance in the team. If they play Giles ahead of Monty Panesar for the sake of a few runs in the lower order, they are making the decision for the wrong reason. In the form he displayed against Pakistan, Panesar is as much a part of the England bowling attack as a turban on a Sikh. 

Panesar has the ability both to take wickets and control the scoring rate of a team who have had their share of problems against good finger-spinners. Phil Tufnell, at the Oval in 1997, and Harbhajan Singh, in India 2001, both mesmerised the Australian batsmen in general but more particularly the most capable one in the present side, Ricky Ponting. 

In fact, with Australias reputation for imploding against good off-spinners, its a surprise the selectors didnt gamble by choosing Jamie Dalrymple in the squad of 16, thus affording Giles the opportunity to work on his fitness and form while on standby at the Perth academy. 

The fact that Giles is in the squad suggests the selectors are in a quandary about the balance of the XI. One of the reasons why England were successful last year was that the four pace bowlers contained Australias first-innings scores. Repeating that success in Australia wont be easy, however, because the home side will be better prepared to combat an England pace attack hampered by the absence of the much-improved Simon Jones. It will also be made harder by the difficulty in fitting a fourth fast bowler into the combination and this is where the names of Giles and Geraint Jones loom large. 

In their desire to include the extra pace bowler, because it worked last time and lightens the load on Flintoff, the selectors will be tempted to include Giles and Jones to add depth to the lower-order batting. This will be tempting fate because both players are inferior in their main skill to Panesar and Chris Read. 

The selectors handbook should include a preamble stating the prime reason for playing an extra bowler in the team is to restrict the oppositions scoring capabilities. If the ploy succeeds it automatically follows youre chasing fewer runs. 

Anyway, if the top-six dont make enough runs, its unfair to expect the lower-order to make up the shortfall. Hence the gamble on Marcus Trescothicks capacity to handle the mental as well as the physical aspects of an Australian tour. This was a good punt because Trescothick in form is an integral part of the England side and, if he falters, they have Alistair Cook as cover. 

However, if England only select five batsmen with Flintoff at six, then Kevin Pietersen will have to tone down his expectations in view of the larger boundaries in Australia. Despite all Englands injury woes, its still a talented squad which only requires Sajid Mahmood or James Anderson to replicate the deeds of Simon Jones to cause Australia a headache. Having seriously underestimated their opponents in 2005, if England do strike the first blow at the Gabba, dont expect Australias response to be: Is that the best youve got?

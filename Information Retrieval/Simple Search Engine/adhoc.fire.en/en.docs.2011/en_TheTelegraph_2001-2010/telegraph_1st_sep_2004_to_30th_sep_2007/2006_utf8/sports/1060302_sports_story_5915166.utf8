The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tendulkar, Dravid alone outweigh England XI

 - Fielding five specialist bowlers would have made a bigger statement in Nagpur 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Nagpur: With just two Indians 

 ? captain Rahul Dravid (98) and senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar 

 (130) ? outweighing the total experience of Englands 

 playing XI (222), theres surprise that the hosts took 

 the safer option of six specialist batsmen instead of blooding 

 leggie Piyush Chawla as well. 

That the 17-year-old wouldnt be in the XI at the VCA Stadium was, in fact, reported in these columns on Wednesday. 

Dravid and coach Greg Chappell have their reasons, but an extra bowler would have made Englands survival more difficult. It wouldnt have been a gamble as Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Irfan Pathan have done enough to be treated as full-fledged allrounders. 

The Indians are right on top (its highly unlikely that the first Test will go the distance), but fielding five specialist bowlers here would have made a bigger statement than when last done ? in Faisalabad, not many weeks ago. 

Actually, the biggest English names are all in the TV commentators box: Former captains Ian Botham, David Gower, Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain. Put together, they totalled 430 Test appearances and scored well over 25,000 runs. Add Bothams 383 Test wickets and... 

 Hussain, by the way, has landed 

 wanting to keep a low profile. Grinning, he 

 told The Telegraph: Im not here as a 

 player and the attention should be on the team... I really 

 am wanting to keep a low profile... 

Thats going to be tougher than England aspiring to beat India. Incidentally, Hussain was captain on the last tour, 2001-02. 

England struggled throughout the day ? some poor shots and a very poor decision ? didnt help, but Alastair Cook (one of three debutants) was outstanding. The Graham Gooch influence was evident as the Essex opener scored 60 calmly and stylishly. 

Come to think of it, the one-time St Pauls Cathedral choir boy was in Antigua not too many days ago! 

 Indias sole debutant, quick Sreesanth, was also 

 impressive (18-4-56-2). 

 Footnote: Overseas players 

 make the most of training opportunities in India. 

 Pakistans Mohammed Asif, for example, has sharpened 

 his bowling at the MRF facility in Chennai and Cook came 

 with Essex to Mumbai in 2004-05. That trip was under the 

 aegis of the World Cricket Academy, managed (among others) 

 by Mumbaikar Sachin Bajaj.

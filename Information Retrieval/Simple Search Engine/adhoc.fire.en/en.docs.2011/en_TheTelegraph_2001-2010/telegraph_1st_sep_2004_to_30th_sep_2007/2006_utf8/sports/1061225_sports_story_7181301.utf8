 Khushiani banned for rash driving

Chennai: Indias lone Formula One driver Narain Karthikeyans team driver Akhil Khushiani grabbed the limelight for wrong reasons in the JK Tyre National Road Racing Championship which came to a glittering end with three international car manufacturers competing for honours here on Sunday. 

With the champions in all three categories Formula Swift (Saran Vikram), Formula Hyundai (Raymond Banajee) and Formula Chevrolet Rolon (Gaurav Gill) having been decided in the fifth leg itself on last Sunday, tough tussels for placings were witnessed in the sixth and final leg. 

The stewards spent a lot of time in deciding on the protest against Khushiani for bumping from behind in the LGB Rolon event (second race). 

Akbar Ebrahim protested for being hit from the behind twice by Khushiani and the stewards. A recommendatory body under the umbrella of the FMSCI, decided to suspend Khushiani, who had been barred from competing in karting event in India for same reasons last year.

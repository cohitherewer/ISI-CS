Bangkok: Jyoti Randhawa and Arjun Atwal played some fine golf to snatch one of the only two wins for Asia against the in-form Europeans on the opening day of the inaugural Royal Trophy at the Amata Spring Country Club. 

The Indians beat David Howell and Kenneth Ferrie one-up even as the Europeans ran up a huge 6-2 lead on the opening day. 

The only other point for Asia came from the Thai duo, Thongchai Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant in the morning session of foursomes. 

Randhawa started with a bang as he birdied first and third and eagled the second. After nine, Indians were two-up and were three-up at the 14th, with just four more holes to go. 

The European pair fought back, as Ferrie birdied the 15th and Howell birdied the 17th to reduce the margin to just one with one to play. On the 18th, Ferrie had an eight-foot birdie putt to level the match, but he missed and Atwal-Randhawa won. 

In the morning, Atwal and Randhawa lost their foursomes clash to the Irish pair of Paul McGinley and Graeme McDowell. 

The Indians won just one hole when they parred the par-5 sixth, which the Irish bogeyed. The match ended on the 15th. 

The Europeans, aided by windy conditions, won the foursomes 3-1 and had a similar margin in the fourball in the afternoon. 

In the morning, the teams played foursomes, in which each team uses just one ball and the players take the shots alternately. Each tee shot is also alternated between the players of the teams. 

The afternoon session saw fourball format, in which each player in either team strikes his own ball. 

Atwal gave Randhawa a lot of credit for the fourball win. 

Full credit to Jyoti. He played really well. I had my moments but it was all him in the fourballs (in the afternoon session). We had a few chances to put them away but didnt make the putts at the right time but we still won. A point is a point. 

Todays conditions favoured Europe. The wind was howling and they know how to play in the wind. 

Definitely it was an advantage for them. Lets see how the conditions are tomorrow. We have to still play. There is nothing to lose. 

Randhawa was happy with his form. I played really well on the front nine and that got us into the lead and arjun came in on the back nine. 

We had a few glitches coming in especially on the 17th but winning by one hole or by five is still one point. Im happy with that. 

Elaborating, Randhawa said, I hit it close to one foot on the first, eagled the second with an eight iron to 15 feet and on the third from 15 feet. 

I knew Kenneth was going to make birdie on 18 as he got it close and I went for the flag but the wind got me and was short. 

Luckily, he missed his birdie putt. 

He also felt the wind was good for the Europeans. Definitely one or two matches went their way because of the wind. It got very windy out there. Lets see what happens (tomorrow), he said.

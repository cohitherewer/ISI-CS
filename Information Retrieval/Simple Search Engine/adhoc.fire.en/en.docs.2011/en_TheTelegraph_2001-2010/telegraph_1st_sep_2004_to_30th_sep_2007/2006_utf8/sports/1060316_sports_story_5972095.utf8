 Hingis upsets Davenport to enter quarters

Indian Wells: Martina Hingis beat second seed Lindsay Davenport 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to reach the Pacific Life Open quarter finals in one of several upsets on Tuesday. 

In the afternoon session, Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis overcame seventh seed Gaston Gaudio 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 and Czech teenager Tomas Berdych knocked out No. 9 Lleyton Hewitt 7-5, 6-3. 

Russias Dinara Safina also enjoyed a big victory by ousting her fifth-seeded compatriot Anastasia Myskina 6-1, 6-3, but as the evening progressed, a majority of the leading players registered victories over lower-ranked opponents. 

In the mens draw, top seed Roger Federer struggled to down Belgiums Olivier Rochus 3-6, 6-2, 7-5, while second seed Rafael Nadal of Spain romped to a 6-1, 6-4 victory over American Mardy Fish. 

Womens top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne continued her amazing play with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over No. 14 Ai Sugiyama of Japan, while No. 3 Maria Sharapova overcame Shahar Peer of Israel 7-6, 6-1. 

Just two and half months into her comeback after three years off the WTA Tour, Hingis continued her race towards the top of the rankings, showing the quick footwork and inventive play that once made her world No. 1. 

After the taller and stronger Davenport found the range of her big serve and ground strokes in the second set, the Swiss 25-year-old rapidly regained her edge, moving her opponent around the court and retrieving a succession of heavy shots from behind the baseline. 

Hingis broke Davenport thrice during the set and won the match when her opponent made a mistake on a backhand volley. 

Davenport was clearly struggling with a back injury but still gave credit to her long-time rival. 

Hingis was thrilled with the victory after going into the match having lost eight of her last 11 meetings with the American. 

Baghdatis, who lost to Federer in the Australian Open final, is making his Indian Wells debut and he will take on fellow 20-year-old Berdych in the last eight. 

The Swiss world No. 1 got off to a slow start against the fleet-footed Rochus, but became much more consistent in the last two sets. 

Once youre down a set, youre not allowed to make any more mistakes, Federer said. Im relieved Im through. 

Federer will take on another youngster, Richard Gasquet of France, who beat Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 6-3, 6-4, while Nadal will face Sebastien Grosjean, who beat Xavier Malisse 6-4, 6-7, 6-2.

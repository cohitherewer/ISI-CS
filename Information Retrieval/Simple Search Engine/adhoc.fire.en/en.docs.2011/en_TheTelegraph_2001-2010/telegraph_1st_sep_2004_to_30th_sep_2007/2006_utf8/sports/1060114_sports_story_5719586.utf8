Hingis has drawn Vera Zvonareva in the first round, while Pierce plays Nicole Pratt of Australia. Third-seeded Amelie Mauresmo has No. 7 Patty Schnyder, No. 12 Anastasia Myskina, No. 16 Nicole Vaidisova and Indias Sania Mirza in her quarter. 

The mens draw has been hit by the injury withdrawals of defending champion Marat Safin (left knee tendinitis), 2005 French Open winner Rafael Nadal (left foot injury) and four-time Melbourne Park singles champion Andre Agassi (left ankle strain). 

Thomas Johannson, the 2002 Australian Open winner, also is questionable ? he has a right shoulder injury and withdrew from the Sydney International this week. 

Clijsters pulled out of the same tournament in the quarter finals Wednesday with a left hip injury, but still hopes to play in Melbourne. 

Australian Open chief executive Paul McNamee said despite some high-profile absentees, the mens draw contained 17 of the top 20 players and the womens draw featured all of the top 20 players.

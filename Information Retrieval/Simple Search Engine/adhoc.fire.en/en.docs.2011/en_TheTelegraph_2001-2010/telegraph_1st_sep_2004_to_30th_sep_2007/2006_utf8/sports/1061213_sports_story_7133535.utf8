The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CPT-E. Rly tie stands cancelled 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The IFA, on Tuesday, cancelled the controversial CFL Premier Division match between Calcutta Port Trust and Eastern Railway. Calcutta Port Trust lost the match 2-3, but the match sparked off widespread criticism because of the manner their striker Sujit Dey was allowed to score both goals and emerge joint top-scorer with Mohun Bagans Dipendu Biswas (8). 

With the match verdict now being rendered null and void, Dipendu will get the top-scorers award. 

IFA also penalised the two clubs, withdrawing half of their money (Rs. 22,000 each) they were supposed to get from the parent body. 

In another development, IFA sent the Douglas da Silva issue into Fifas court. Douglas moved both IFA and Fifa against Mohammedan Sporting, demanding the club to clear his dues after being sacked midway in the league.

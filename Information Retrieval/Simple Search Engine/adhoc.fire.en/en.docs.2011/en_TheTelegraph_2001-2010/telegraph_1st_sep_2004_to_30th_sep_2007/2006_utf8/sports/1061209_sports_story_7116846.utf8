 Qatar to set up riders statue

Doha: While the brother of a South Korean rider killed in an eventing accident arrived in Qatar on Friday to collect the body, equestrian officials defended their decision to continue running the cross-country competition after the man died and in deteriorating weather conditions. 

Kim Hyung-chil, a 47-year-old member of South Koreas three-day event team and a former Olympian, was crushed by his horse after hitting a jump Thursday on a course at the Asian Games. It was the first death of a competitor in the 55-year history of the Games. 

Sheik Mohammed bin Hamad Al Thanim, the son of Qatars emir, announced Friday that a statue will be set up in Dohas multi-complex Sports City for the late rider. 

Meanwhile, swimmer Park Tae-hwan dedicated his Asian Games title in the 1,500m freestyle to the South Korean rider. (AP)

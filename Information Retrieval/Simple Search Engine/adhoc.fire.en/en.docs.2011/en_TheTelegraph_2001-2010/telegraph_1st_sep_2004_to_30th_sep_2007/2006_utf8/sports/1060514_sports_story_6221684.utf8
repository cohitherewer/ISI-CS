 Rome: Defending champion 

 Rafael Nadal set up a dream final against Roger Federer 

 at the Rome Masters when he beat Gael Monfils 6-2, 6-2 on 

 Saturday.

 While Nadal had few problems getting 

 the better of Frenchman Monfils in the battle of the 19-year-olds, 

 Federer was forced to come from a break down in the deciding 

 set of his match against fourth seed David Nalbandian before 

 winning 6-3, 3-6, 7-6.

 If Nadal beats the world No. 1 

 on Sunday, he will equal Guillermo Vilas all-time 

 record of 53 consecutive wins on clay, set in 1977.

 The final gives the worlds 

 top two players a chance to resume their intense rivalry 

 in which Spaniard Nadal holds the upper hand after winning 

 the last three contests including the final of the Monte 

 Carlo Masters claycourt event last month.

 Its always special 

 when the top two play each other. It certainly was in Monte 

 Carlo, said Federer, whose best result in five previous 

 visits to the Italian capital was runner-up to Felix Mantilla 

 in 2003.

 It was his second close brush 

 with defeat in as many days following his quarter-final 

 against Spanish qualifier Nicolas Almagro, which he won 

 7-5 in the third.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mumbai: Robin Uthappa had 

 been focusing on excelling for Air India, in a tournament 

 for corporates here, when a friend telephoned from New Delhi 

 to inform him of his Team India call-up. It took the 20-year-old 

 by surprise, but left him thrilled 

 as well. 

Uthappa has taken Gautam Gambhirs place in the squad for the next six ODIs ? four versus England and two against Pakistan. He has also been picked for an A face-off in Abu Dhabi and, so, will have to miss next months B.Com final exams. 

 I immediately called my 

 mother (Rosy) in Bangalore and could hear her sobbing... 

 Of course, those were tears of joy... It was an emotional 

 moment for everybody in the family, Uthappa told The 

 Telegraph the day after the biggest moment 

 of his life. 

Speaking from the team hotel in Kochi, on Tuesday evening, the right-handed opener from Karnataka added: Im not thinking of the pressure... Rather, I see this as a step towards showing my worth at the highest level... As an opportunity, its excellent. 

Uthappa, who first made headlines in the 2003-04 U-19 Asia Cup (Lahore), has grown up idolising Sachin Tendulkar. In more recent years, he has been a big fan of Matthew Hayden ? I like the way Hayden dominates the bowlers... Hes different from the rest. 

Incidentally, that colts tournament had brought Irfan Pathan in the limelight. In fact, his first Test appearance came within two months. He hasnt looked back since. 

The world may feel Uthappa could find it easy settling down as the captain (Rahul Dravid) has seen him come through the ranks, but the rookies thoughts are different: Thats not how things work... Its not a question of any advantage. 

 Uthappas father (Venu), by the way, is a former 

 international hockey umpire and was a state-level right-out. 

 Sister Sharon, who is older than him, completes the family 

 which currently is over the moon.

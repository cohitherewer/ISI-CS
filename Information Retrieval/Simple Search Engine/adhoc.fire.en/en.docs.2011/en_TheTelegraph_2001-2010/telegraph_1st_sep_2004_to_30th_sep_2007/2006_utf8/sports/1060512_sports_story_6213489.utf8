 Greg concerned about burnout

Mumbai: Admitting that excessive cricket was a matter of concern, India coach Greg Chappell Thursday asked the BCCI not to overburden its champion players as it could lead to premature end of their careers. 

It is important for BCCI and others to understand that there is a huge investment in these players. They are champion players and you must not finish their careers by overburdening them, Chappell said at a press conference hours before the teams departure to the West Indies. 

Chappell said although at the moment the balance was pretty good, there was a need to be careful about breaks in between matches. The balance is pretty good with 30 odd ODI and 12-13 Tests every year. (But) It is important to get breaks at regular intervals. The break we have now is ideal. Though the five-and-a-half month break Australia have now is a bit too long. 

Playing the England series after the series against Pakistan was tough. We had 3-4 series packed together which was very demanding. Getting the balance right is important. 

Chappell urged his players to reproduce their successful one-day methods in Tests in a bid to claim a rare series victory in the West Indies. We have made good ground in the last 12 months, especially in one-day cricket, Chappell said. 

We need to apply the similar processes to Test cricket, bearing in mind that Test cricket is more demanding, he said before Fridays departure for the West Indies where India are due to play five one-dayers and four Tests. 

We have got to be more aware of the flow of Test cricket, of the important moments, the important sessions in Test matches, he said. 

Chappell said India should try to emulate the successful West Indies sides of the 1980s and 1990s and current world champions Australia, who both replicated their one-day success in Tests. 

If you look at the great West Indian teams that dominated world cricket for two decades and the current Australian team that has been on top for nearly the same length of time, one-day cricket was the catalyst for them getting better. 

 On Brian Lara getting back the 

 captaincy, he said: I have no doubt Lara coming back 

 as captain is a positive thing, Chappell said. It 

 will be a change for them, Im sure it will invigorate 

 them, invigorate him.

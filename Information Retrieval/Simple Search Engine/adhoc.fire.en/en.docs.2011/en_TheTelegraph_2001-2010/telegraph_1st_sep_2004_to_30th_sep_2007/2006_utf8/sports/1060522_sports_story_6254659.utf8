 Quick Takes

 Viduka handed captains band

 Melbourne: Middlesbrough 

 striker Mark Viduka will lead Australia in their first World 

 Cup campaign in 32 years, coach Guus Hiddink said on Sunday. 

 Viduka, who captained Australia in their play-off win over 

 Uruguay last November, was given the job ahead of former 

 skipper Craig Moore, who had missed the play-off through 

 injury.

 Hiddink confirmed Tim Cahill would 

 miss the friendly against Greece but that his knee injury 

 was progressing well.

 Giuly feels robbed

 Paris: Barcelona winger 

 Ludovic Giuly says he feels robbed after being left out 

 of the France World Cup squad by coach Raymond Domenech. 

 I met all the selection criteria Domenech put forward, 

 Giuly told a French sports daily on Sunday. He wanted 

 experience, players accepting they might be on the substitutes 

 bench, players who play for a great club and who had appeared 

 in big games, players who dont complain. I did all 

 that for Barcelona, so either I didnt understand or 

 Domenech has changed tack. 

 wait and watch

 Geneva: The Germany will 

 take a course in watch making to fill up a bit of spare 

 time during their Swiss training camp. Theyll 

 learn how to take a watch apart and put it back together 

 again, German team manager Oliver Bierhoff said following 

 their arrival from Sardinia. Its something a 

 bit different.

 No second chance

 London: Players going to 

 the World Cup know that, if they make a big blunder in their 

 first game, they probably wont play another. According 

 to World Cup-bound Graham Poll, the same applies to the 

 referees. If you make a big mistake in your first 

 game, it will be your last game, and that has been made 

 very clear to us, said Poll.

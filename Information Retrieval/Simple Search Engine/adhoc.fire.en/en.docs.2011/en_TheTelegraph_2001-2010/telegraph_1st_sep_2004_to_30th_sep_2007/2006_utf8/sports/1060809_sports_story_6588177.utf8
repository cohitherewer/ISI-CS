 Kumble picks up 2 wickets

London: Anil Kumble continued to bamboozle the English batsmen as he picked two wickets for Surrey and pushed Worcestershire on the backfoot on the opening day of a County Championship Division II match at New Road on Tuesday. 

Kumble proved to be a perfect foil for England spinner Ian Salisbury who returned with three for 54 as the hosts reached 255 for six at tea after electing to bat. 

The spin duo claimed the first five wickets to fall to bring the visitors back into the match after Worcestershire were off to a confident start. 

The Indian star struck first to break the solid partnership between Vikram Solanki and Australian opener Phil Jaques by having the former caught and bowled for 17. The 35-year old leggie then picked the second of two wickets to fall in quick time, that of Steven Davies who fell lbw to the leg-spinner. 

Jaques made a well-paced 95 that kept Worcestershire scoreboard moving despite regular fall of wickets. (PTI)

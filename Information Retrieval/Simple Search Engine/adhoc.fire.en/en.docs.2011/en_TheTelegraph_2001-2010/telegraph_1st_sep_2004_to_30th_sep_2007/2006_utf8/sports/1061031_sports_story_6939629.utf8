 SHARP SINGLES 

 Boucher ready for stark reality 

Jaipur: South Africa should quickly step out of the comfort zone of playing on a seaming track and face the stark reality of contesting their Champions Trophy semi-final on a typical subcontinent wicket, their wicketkeeper-batsman Mark Boucher said on Monday. 

 I had a look at the pitch here. It is different from the one on which the South Africans played here in three-day game in November 2004, Boucher said. 

 It has some visible cracks which suggest that there may be some up and down movement but we have to play on whatever surface and conditions are provided to us, he said. 

 There will be totally different situations and conditions in next couple of matches. We have yet to give our 100 per cent. Perhaps we have to rejuvenate ourselves for the semi-finals, Boucher said. 

 Asked if he was surprised to see the three Asian teams bowing out of the tournament early, Boucher said: Every thing is possible in one-day cricket.

I nearly quit: Symonds 

 Melbourne: Australian allrounder Andrew Symonds has revealed that he has thought about quitting cricket last year in order to save his marriage. 

Symonds marriage to childhood sweetheart Brooke Marshall ended last year after a brief reunion, preceded by a split the year before, and the cricketer said he had struggled to handle the emotional fallout. 

He went to see psychologist Phil Jauncey, who works with the Australian cricket team, for advice and deeply considered stepping down from the 2005 tour to England, on which he was chosen for the one-day series.

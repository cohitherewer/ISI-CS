 Inzy should have defied pain under crisis: Imran 

 - Sports ministry asks Sarfraz to prepare report 

Karachi: Legendary allrounder Imran Khan has said Inzamam-ul Haq should have shown more effort and helped Pakistan avoid defeat in the third Test against England. 

Imran said that had Inzamam taken the field despite a chest injury on Day IV, he could have avoided batting lower down the order on the final day and saved the team from a humiliating loss. 

Skipper Inzamam-ul Haq should have known that he would not be able to go up the order on the crucial last day and so should have made every effort to spend time in the field on Day IV to be eligible to bat in his regular position, Imran wrote in a Pakistan newspaper on Wednesday. 

When a captain leads from the front and plays through injuries, it inspires his charges to brave challenges and adversity. 

I once saw Ian Chappell bat for two hours with a broken hand against the likes of Andy Roberts and Joel Garner. His standing firm despite the extreme pain and discomfort roused the Aussies to turn the tables against the West Indies despite facing much superior odds in the next Test match, the World Cup-winning captain wrote. 

Pakistan lost to England by 167 runs in the third Test at Headingley on Tuesday to lag behind 0-2 in the four-match series. 

The former speedster also did not approve of rushing back Shoaib Akhtar for the last Test. 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz said Inzamam should step down as captain after England scored their first home Test series win against the South Asian team in 24 years. 

In the best interest of the game, Inzamam should retire immediately and (vice captain) Younis Khan should be made the captain, said Sarfraz. 

Inzamam is scared of short pitched deliveries, he cant even negotiate short balls by a spinner. 

Sarfraz said he had been asked by the sports ministry to prepare a report on the humiliating loss in England and added that he might travel to England to witness the last Test match starting August 17 at The Oval. (Agencies)

 Jeev slides to tied 14th

Kawagoe: Jeev Milkha Singh, who led the field after four holes in the morning, dropped three strokes in two holes and later had a triple bogey to end the day at two-over and slip to be tied 14th in Japan Open Golf Tournament. 

The current leader is Paul Sheehan of Australia. A round of three-under 68 carried him to seven-under for three days. Sheehan is one clear of shingo katayama (71). 

The Volvo China Open winner and leader on UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit, Jeev seemed to have recovered from his food poisoning on Wednesday night as he had a hattrick of birdies from second to fourth and went to eight-under and to the top of the leaderboard. 

He then had a bogey on fifth and a double bogey on sixth and later on 580-yard par-five. He had a birdie on first two days and later a triple bogey which ruined his day. (PTI)

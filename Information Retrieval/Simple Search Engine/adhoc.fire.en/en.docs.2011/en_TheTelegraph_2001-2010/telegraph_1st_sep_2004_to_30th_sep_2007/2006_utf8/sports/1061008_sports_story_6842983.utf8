 Amorina trounces opposition 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The Calcutta Derby Trial Stakes, the star-event in Saturdays race-card, could be simply summarised by saying that Amorina was first and the rest were nowhere. The Vijay Singh-trained filly was a virtual winner at every post of the 2,000m trip.

 The Steinbeck-Alvarada daughter shot into a four-length lead and pulled hard, giving her jockey C.Alford little chance to show his artistry in the saddle. She further broke away from the field at the top of the turn to win by a double distance.

 The Derby was, however, a serious contest for the second slot which Amorinas stablemate, Andrology, managed to gain from Daniel-trainees Active Asset and Star Special. Daniel, nevertheless, made his presence felt in the eight-event card winning three races, all trophy events with the help of jockey Imran Chisty.

 Carlos to stay at Real

Madrid: Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos has decided to stay at Spanish club Real Madrid until his contract finishes, ending speculation about his future. 

The Brazilian has one season left on his deal at Real with the option of another depending on the number of games he plays next season. 

The left back, who is at the pre-season training camp in Austria, will complete his contract with the side, Real said in a statement on their website on Wednesday. 

The 33-year-old met Real sports director Predrag Mijatovic on Tuesday after having been convinced he was wanted by new coach Fabio Capello. 

I spoke with Mijatovic and told him about the offers I had. We havent changed anything with regard to my contract. I want to continue here, Carlos told the site. (Reuters)

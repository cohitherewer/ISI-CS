 AIFF turns down Nayeem request

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has turned down a request by national coach Syed Nayeemuddin to show cause skipper Bhaichung Bhutia for his outburst against the Indian team management after losing to Yemen in the Asian Cup qualifier on Thursday. 

According to AIFF sources, both Nayeem and manager P.K. Banerjee met AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in the capital and sought action against Bhutia. The AIFF boss did not agree with the suggestion and said he would talk to Bhutia before taking any appropriate action. 

Nayeem and PK, sources said, were criticised by Das Munshi and the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco for Indias poor display in the Asian Cup. The duo, however, has been asked to chalk out a comprehensive plan for the future. 

Nayeem and PK said they would like to hold a six-week camp immediately after the completion of the National Football League. While the camp should start with the U-23 boys, the senior boys would join after 10 days. 

India play a tournament in Canada in July. Nayeem and PK have expressed their willingness to go and play a few friendlies in Brazil thereafter, before returning to play the rest of the Asian Cup matches.

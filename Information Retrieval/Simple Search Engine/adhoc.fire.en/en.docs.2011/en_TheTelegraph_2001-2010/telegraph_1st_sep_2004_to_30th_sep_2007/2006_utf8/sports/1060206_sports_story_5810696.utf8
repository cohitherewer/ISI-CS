 Dipendu saves day for Bagan 

Margao: Mohun Bagan finally scored in a straight-forward way on Sunday, but the victory remained elusive for them in the National Football League. Dipendu Biswas headed home in the 80th minute to save the day for his team against Salgaocar as the match ? characterised by too many physical challenges among players ? ended 1-1. 

Mohun Bagan defender Eduardo Coelho was marched out for elbowing on the head of a rival player in the dying minutes of the match. 

Agnelo Colaco put Salgaocar head in the 15th minute, which led to his teams dominance in the first-half. Mohun Bagan went on the offensive after the break, with Mehtab and Ibrahim missing out on a few opportunities. A significant part of Mohun Bagan coach Jahar Das strategy was sending balls into the box from both flanks and Eduardo even missed the target from close. 

Dipendu finally broke the jinx when he timed his jump to perfection in effecting the equaliser off a free-kick. His captain Mehtab Hussain scored the only other goal for the team in the tournament so far, when he converted a penalty against Sporting Clube de Goa on second attempt. 

Soon after, Mohun Bagan were rendered a 10-man army when the referee made Eduardo leave the field on charges of rough play. There was little time left, still Salgaocar tried to cash in on the advantage. Ashim Biswas came close to scoring, but his shot from close was off the target. 

The result leaves Bagan with five points from seven matches.

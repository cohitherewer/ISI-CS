The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Leipus support for Gregs kho-kho

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former Team India physio Andrew Leipus feels that fitness is the key to success, but skill is needed to survive in the international cricket. As an example, he picked up the cases of Sourav Ganguly and Mohammed Kaif. Kaif is high on fitness not only in India but in the world while Sourav is high on skill, Leipus said at the Eden on Monday. 

Leipus believes that each and every state association should have trained physios and trainers like the Team India. Unless you have trained people, others actually dont know the injury management techniques, he said. He also supported Greg Chappells technique of playing kho kho as a part of training. You cannot be prepared for injuries which happen through accidents, he added. 

Sometimes warm-ups can be boring. In Australia, players play a lot of volleyball and football to keep their mind fresh and increase the level of fitness. It gives them a nice break from cricket, he said.

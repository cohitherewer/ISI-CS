 Jeev Milkha slips to 19th

Sapporo: A lapse in concentration midway through the round and a closing bogey saw Jeev Milkha Singh slip from a position of contention to a modest tied 19th after the third round of the 100 million yen Ana Open on the Japan Tour. 

Jeev shot an one-over 72 with three birdies and four bogeys. 

Overnight leader Tomohiro Kondo (73) was sharing top spot with Yoshinobu Tsukada (68) at eight-under 205. Shinichi Yokota (72) was third, while Nobuo Serizawa (66), Ryuichi Oda (72) and Tommy Nakajima (71) were tied fourth at seven-under. 

Jeev, starting the day at four-under, looked set for a good round after he birdied the first hole. He then added another on par-five fifth, a hole which he has birdied on all three days so far. 

But in the middle of the round, his concentration lapsed. He made a bogey on ninth and then went wayward with his approach shot on 12th to drop another shot. On 13th, he three-putted for yet another bogey a birdie on the 17th. 

But he gave the shot back immediately on the final hole to end tied 19th. Jeev is lying 18th on the Japan Tour money list this season.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We must respect the decision: Brian Lara

 - PCB needs to convince others, says Rameez Raja 

 Mohammed Asif and Shoaib Akhtar

Islamabad: Yet again, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is in focus for all the wrong reasons. This was echoed by the cricketing fraternity, a day after the PCB-appointed appeals tribunal lifted ban on fast bowling spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. However, some did welcome the decision, saying that Shoaib-Asifs return will strengthen Pakistans bowling attack. 

The following are reactions (alphabetically) on the PCB-appointed appeals tribunals decision: 

BRIAN LARA: It is important they move on not only for their cricket but importantly for Pakistan cricket as well. I know it is very important for Pakistan and world cricket that this issue is not allowed to spiral into something else given the negativity surrounding the affair. They are men of integrity in PCB and we must respect that. 

MUSHTAQ MOHAMMED: Pakistan has become a laughing stock in the cricket world. There was no need for this whole doping drama. A competent committee was chosen to deal with the guilt and now suddenly the second committee overturned the ban. Nonetheless, Im glad for the boys; the duos return would strengthen Pakistans bowling. 

RAMEEZ RAJA: I think for the outside world it becomes an eyewash, the same as I see it. I am happy for the bowlers but it has become a controversial issue. The initial doping tribunal that banned the pair was told to work under WADA and ICC rules but the appeals committee worked under local PCB rules and found that get-away clause which cleared the two bowlers. 

I think they (PCB) have messed up the whole issue and once again Pakistan is in focus for wrong reasons. You need to convince others about the decision.

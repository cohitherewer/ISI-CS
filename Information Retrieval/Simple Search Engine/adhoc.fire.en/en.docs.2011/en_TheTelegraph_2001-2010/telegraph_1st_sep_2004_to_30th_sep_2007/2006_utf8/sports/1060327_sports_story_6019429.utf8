 Electrocutionist lifts World 

 Cup

 Dubai: (Reuters) Hot favourite Electrocutionist stormed up the straight under jockey Frankie Dettori on Saturday to win the $6 million Dubai World Cup, the sports richest race.

 It was a fifth victory in 11 runnings of the 10 furlong (2-km) event for owners Godolphin, brainchild of Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai.

 Electrocutionist, 5-4 favourite in London betting, was sixth turning into the Nad Al Sheba straight but came with a courageous long run on the outside to wear down U.S. raider Brass Hat (11-2) and 33-1 outsider Wilko for a comfortable two-length success.

 The winner was drawn in stall one on the inside of the 11 runners and no horse in World Cup history had previously won or even been placed from there.

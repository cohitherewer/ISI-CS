 India not keeping pace with West, says Amritraj

Bangalore: Indian tennis legend Vijay Amritraj believes it is a matter of concern that the rate of improvement in Indian players? game is not in pace with the growth being shown by their Western counterparts. 

?We have got enough bunch of players who are playing. Important thing for them is to improve at a particular rate... Also to be able to maintain that kind of growth factor like they do in the West. Rate of improvement must match that,? said Amritraj. 

?The game shouldn?t get ahead of us. That?s the concern i am having,? said the veteran, who twice reached quarter finals at Wimbledon. 

?The important thing is to have that growth between the second rung and first rung to improve at the rate the West is improving. That?s important. Not just good enough to play for India alone but to be able to compete at the highest level overseas,? the Los Angeles-based former player said. 

He said: ?The bar is high. To compete in international tennis, you have to be up there, with them (the best). Otherwise, you should compete in India?. 

While it?s ?bit of a drawback? that Indian tennis players are not ?big enough? physically (in terms of height), it can be made up with quickness, pace, power, endurance, accuracy and consistency, Amritraj said. 

He said India had ?good depth? in bench strength but it was a question of ?everyone improving together and having at the first class level, a big pool to choose from and not relying on one or two players all the time?. 

Amritraj also criticised India?s move to go ahead with the Davis Cup tie against South Korea earlier this month at Changwon despite extreme cold conditions putting Indians at a disadvantage. 

?Weather certainly played a major role (in India losing the Asia-Oceania Group I Davis Cup tie),? he said. ?They should have stopped the match, obviously.? 

?They have created a ruling that if it?s too hot, you stop matches. So, in turn if it?s too cold, you have to stop matches too,? pointed Amritraj. 

Asked if such a ruling was not there, he said: ?I don?t know. I thought there was. How can you play (in such extreme cold conditions)...Does not make sense.? 

He said Indians were not used to playing in such extreme cold conditions but hastened to add ?that?s what the home court advantage is all about.? 

South Korea had beaten India 4-1 in the tie.

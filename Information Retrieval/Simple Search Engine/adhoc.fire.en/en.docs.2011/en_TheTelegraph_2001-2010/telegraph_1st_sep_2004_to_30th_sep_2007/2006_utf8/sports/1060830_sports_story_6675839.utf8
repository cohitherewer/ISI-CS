The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barretos name suggested

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: At a time when Bob Houghton has been looking for stronger and taller footballers for the national squad, a few club coaches have made a suggestion to him to include foreign footballers playing in India after granting them Indian citizenship as per the Fifa rules. 

On Monday, Houghton met around a dozen coaches in Goa that included former national coach Sukhwinder Singh (JCT), Armando Colaco (Dempo), Derrick Perreira (Mahindra), Savio Medeira (Salgaocar), Bimal Ghosh (Air India) and former India under-16 coach Mridul Banerjee (Vasco) and discussed his plans on the national squad. 

AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco was also present in the meeting. 

The suggestion to adopt foreign footballers for the Indian squad, however, came from the Churchill Brothers Moroccan coach Karim Bencherifa, who said a skillful footballer like Jose Barreto and some strongly built Nigerians would be of great help to Indian team in the international arena. 

Houghton sounded interested about Barreto as he said he was aware of the Brazilians status in Indian football. He even took time to know a few details about the ace striker from Mahindra coach Derrick Perreira. 

Houghton also asked the assembled coaches to suggest footballers, who could be called for the national camp in future. 

He also agreed to a proposal by Armando Colaco that AIFF, which provides best quality ball for the national squad, should not use balls of inferior quality for domestic tournaments.

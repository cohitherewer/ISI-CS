 Sachin, Laras Bollywood role

 Port of Spain: Worlds premier batsmen 

 Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara will feature alongside former 

 Miss Universe Sushmita Sen in a Bollywood movie that will 

 be filmed partly here later this year. 

 Dulha Mil Gaya, which will also be shot in 

 India and cost $2m, will hit the screens here in March, 

 coinciding with the World Cup. 

Everyone in India knows cricket and knows about Trinidad because that is where one of the most successful batsmen, Lara, comes from. He will be part of the film, Vivek Vaswani, one of the producers of the film, said. 

Vaswani and his producing partner Mudassar Aziz were in Trinidad, meeting with government officials and seeking approval for shooting. 

Vaswani said the inspiration for his movie was the Notting Hill carnival in London. 

 I loved what I saw and I wanted to be part of 

 that. I asked myself, if that is what the Caribbean was 

 all about, why not be part of that, he said.

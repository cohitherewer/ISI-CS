 - THIRD TEST 

 - Im always wary of games after good wins: Strauss

Leeds: If the third Test between England and Pakistan at Headingley is as unpredictable as the second, then bank on Pakistan winning the game in a canter. 

England, seeking their first series win since last years Ashes, have much to cheer about, thanks in large measure to their younger players. 

One thing seems certain, there should be a result at the Leeds venue. The last seven Tests there have ended in victory for one side or another. 

Another English victory will guarantee a first home series success over Pakistan since 1982. 

Pakistan will be without opener Imran Farhat (broken finger) while coach Bob Woolmer seems certain to reconsider replacing second leg-spinner Shahid Afridi with a quick bowler. 

Sajid Mahmood will be challenged for his place by fellow seamer Jon Lewis. 

Meanwhile, the major handicap that has dogged Pakistan throughout this series the absence through injury of leading fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif and Rana Naved-ul Hasan remains. 

Pakistan could now recall Salman Butt, dropped for the second Test, while fellow opener Taufeeq Umar, a late addition to the squad, is another possibility. 

England captain Andrew Strauss will warn his team not to lose their cutting edge. Im always wary of games after good wins, Strauss told a news conference at Headingley on Thursday on the eve of the match. 

Strauss said he was not surprised by Cooks success in scoring three hundreds in seven Tests. I saw how he played on his debut and that said a lot about the guy.

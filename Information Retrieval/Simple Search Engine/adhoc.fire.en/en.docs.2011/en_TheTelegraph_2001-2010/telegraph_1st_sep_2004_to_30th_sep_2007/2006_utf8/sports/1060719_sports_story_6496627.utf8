 I doubt if 

 Federer can ever beat Nadal on clay

 There was a chorus of gilded accolades 

 from all time greats as Roger Federer won his 

 fourth consecutive Wimbledon singles title. In the fortnight 

 en route to the final, in the most challenging section of 

 the draw, Federer left in his wake a humiliating trail of 

 crushing defeats.

 All straight set victories garnished 

 by two-love sets with only one close 7-6 against 

 Mahut in the third round, were a true measure of his genius.

 On grass courts, against human 

 endeavour at its peak, such results have the fragrance of 

 divinity. One wondered if he could maintain such a level 

 close to perfection in the final against Nadal.

 The dream final against Nadal 

 was the ultimate test and the tennis world waited with bated 

 breath. Federer had to move out of the shadow of four depressing 

 consecutive losses to Nadal or else his dream of being the 

 greatest ever would be shattered.

 For Nadal, riding on a wave of 

 60 consecutive victories on clay courts, victory in this 

 match would have put him on the summit with a chance of 

 usurping Federers crown.

 There has been no final in the 

 last 60 years where the stakes have been so high. In contrast 

 to Federers unchallenged route to the final, Nadals 

 was tough and well contested. In the second round he was 

 down two-sets-to-love to qualifier Robert Kendrick from 

 the US, but fought back to win in five. As Nadal came through 

 his grinding matches, his camp intelligently tuned his game 

 for grass court play.

 He served harder and flatter and 

 went for aces. He reduced the top-spin on his forehand while 

 going for winners and moved closer to the baseline for ground 

 stroke rallies.

 In the final, Nadals resolve 

 and determination showed no signs of decline after Federer 

 served an amazing 93 per cent first serves in court and 

 broke Nadals service three consecutive times.

 The next two sets were the most 

 exciting of the Championships, as Federer struggled to stay 

 in control. The defending champion won the second set tie-breaker, 

 but still Nadal would not give up and came back to win the 

 third set in a tie-breaker.

 The Centre Court held its breath, 

 was there going to be another Nadal comeback? But Nadal 

 had given too much and Federer wrapped up the match in a 

 tame finish 6-3.

 The Nadal-Federer rivalry will 

 enrich the tennis world, but I doubt if Federer can ever 

 beat Nadal on clay courts.

 The standard of mens tennis 

 is at its highest ever and though Nadal and Federer are 

 a class apart, there are quite a few youngsters who could 

 catch up with them in coming years.

 At Wimbledon this year, both in 

 the mens and ladies events, students of the 

 game must have noticed a new tactic; the frequent use of 

 the drop shot which had become a forgotten ploy.

 The reason for this is that the 

 Wimbledon courts are much harder owing to more sun and less 

 rain. Hence the ball bounces higher and the players stand 

 a few steps further back from the baseline than earlier. 

 Also, most of them are over 6-ft tall and run very well 

 side-to-side but do not move forward as fast.

 Federers style of play is 

 a well-placed angled serve in the 120 mph zone, earning 

 a weak half court response, which he allows to bounce and 

 then puts away with a flatish forehand winner. The serve 

 and volley is used strategically and more as a surprise 

 variant or as a pressure tactic on important points.

 The ladies fashion world was subdued 

 with the announcement in the Wimbledon Guide 

 that any competitor who appears on court dressed in 

 a manner which is deemed unsuitable by the committee, will 

 be defaulted.

 Wearing low-cut tops exposing 

 a bit of cleavage and billowing short skirts revealing the 

 underwear was too risky, and none of the ladies took a chance.

 I loved the new uniforms for the 

 linesmen and umpires designed by Ralph Lauren; it added 

 to the traditional grandeur of Wimbledon. The uniform, reminiscent 

 of the 1920s amp; 30s, was described by one writer as straight 

 out of Neol Cowards cupboard.

 Paes, still ticking away, was 

 in the semi-finals of the mens doubles and quarter 

 finals of the mixed doubles. He still is a force to be reckoned 

 with and with luck and a good partner could well collect 

 another Grand Slam title.

 But our Davis Cup juniors are 

 still buried deep in the small print of the qualifying rounds 

 of Wimbledon.

 Sanam Singh, seeded 8th in the 

 boys singles, lost in third round. He seems to be 

 our lone hope and one hopes he will get proper and adequate 

 support and manage to break through into the top 100.

 Rupesh Roy did well in boys 

 doubles where he reached the semi-finals with H. H. Lee 

 from Taipei.

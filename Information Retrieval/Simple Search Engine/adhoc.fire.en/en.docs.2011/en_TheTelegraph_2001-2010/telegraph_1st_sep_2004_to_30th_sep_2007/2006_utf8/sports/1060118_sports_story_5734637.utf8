Melbourne: Super sub Malinga Bandara took three wickets for 31 runs off 8.2 overs to help bowl Sri Lanka to a 94-run victory over South Africa in a tri-series one-day International in Brisbane on Tuesday. 

Man of the Match Kumar Sangakkara (88) and Jehan Mubarak (61) shared a 112-run second-wicket partnership to guide Sri Lanka to an imposing 282 for six off their 50 overs. 

Chaminda Vaas and Muttiah Muralidharan then grabbed two wickets each, while the Sri Lankan fielders affected two run outs to bowl the South Africans out for 188 in 44.2 overs. 

Wicketkeeper Mark Boucher, who blazed an unbeaten 63 off 62 to guide his side to a five-wicket victory over Australia on Sunday, top-scored for South Africa with an intelligent 62 before he was the last man out. 

Super sub Jacques Rudolph, who replaced Monde Zondeki, added 53 before he was the second of South Africas two run outs. 

Sri Lanka, who were thrashed by Australia by 116 runs in the first match of the series in Melbourne last Friday, produced a vastly improved all-round performance on Tuesday. 

It was only their third victory in their last 13 games after losing a series to India 6-1 and then losing three of four games in New Zealand. 

Captain Maravan Atapattu, who made 33 in their innings, juggled his bowlers intelligently, never allowing the South African batsmen to settle. 

Sri Lanka earned a bonus point for bowling South Africa out for less than 225 runs and joined Australia on five points after both played two games each. South Africa have four points. (Reuters)

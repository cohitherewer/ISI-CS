The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB eye win vs JCT

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal, whose title hopes are over, will bank on home advantage to ensure a second-place finish in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup when they take on JCT Mills, Phagwara in their last match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. A win against the Punjab outfit will straightaway assure them of the runners spot as well as a place in the AFC Cup. 

The squad is 90 per cent fit and on home ground, we are targeting full points against JCT, East Bengal coach Phillipe de Ridder said. 

Striker Bhaichung Bhutia also wants to finish the season on a high. Bhutia ? on 12 goals ? also has the chance of overtaking Ranty Martins 13 for the top scorers slot. 

Defender Covan Lawrence is ruled and his place is likely to be taken by M. Suresh. 

JCT need a point from their remaining outings to finish sixth on the table.

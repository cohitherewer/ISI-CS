 Rahul amp; Co. send best wishes

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Rahul Dravid and his team on Saturday complimented the India Under-19 side for making it to he final of the World Cup and wished them success in the final. India face Pakistan in Colombo Sunday. 

I want to wish the very best to the U-19 team. We will be cheering for them and want them to play good cricket. May the best team win, the Team India captain said. 

These boys are now more mature. They get more exposure at an early age in different conditions which give them that extra advantage at the senior level. We have several players in our side who have excelled from this stage, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Suresh Raina to name a few, he said. 

Indias U-19 World Cup winning captain Kaif also wished the players success. 

I hope they bring laurels to the country. They shouldnt worry too much about the result and concentrate on playing good, positive cricket. 

Yuvraj Singh, another member of the U-19 World Cup winning side, said: There is not much pressure at that age and they can relax and enjoy their cricket.

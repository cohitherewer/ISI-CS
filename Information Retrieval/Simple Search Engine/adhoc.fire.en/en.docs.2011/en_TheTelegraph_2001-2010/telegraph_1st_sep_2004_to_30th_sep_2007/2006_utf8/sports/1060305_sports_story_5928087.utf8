 Windies avoid whitewash

Auckland: The West Indies beat New Zealand by three wickets in a nail-biting fifth and final ODI at Eden Park on Saturday to avoid the humiliation of a series whitewash. 

The tourists reached their target of 234 with just two balls to spare with Wavell Hinds steering them to victory with an unbeaten 40 off 41 balls.Shivnarine Chanderpaul top-scored with 41 while allrounder Dwayne Bravo and wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin both chipped in with identical scores of 38 after New Zealand had been bowled out for 233.Scott Styris made 90 to rescue the home team from an early batting collapse, before seam bowler Dwayne Smith captured career-best figures of five for 45 to put the West Indies on course for their first win of the series.Were disappointed not to win 5-0 because it would have been quite an achievement, but 4-1 is pretty good, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said. 

If you told me you could win 4-1 at the start of a series I would take that pretty readily. The fact we denied them for four games was good. 

Fleming said New Zealand had fallen about 20 runs short of what they thought they needed but were still happy with their final total after a terrible start. 

They crashed to 96 for four in the 23rd over before Styris rebuilt the innings with a patient and careful display. 

He survived a let-off on 30 when Chris Gayle dropped him and he went on to post his 14th half-century. 

He was eventually dismissed in the penultimate over. (Reuters)

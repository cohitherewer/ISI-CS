 Nabi dribbles back to EB

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In a dramatic turnaround on Friday, Syed Rahim Nabi ?? a day after dragging East Bengal to court ?? softened his stand. Nabi claimed that he made a wrong decision and now wants to stay back with East Bengal. 

Nabi said: Due to unavoidable circumstances, I thought of switching my allegiance to the Mohammedan Sporting but realised the mistake and now I have decided to continue with my old club. 

But Nabi rubbished all allegations and said that he has withdrawn his case. According to the footballer, he has signed for East Bengal, but it was confirmed from the IFA that his registration for East Bengal is yet to be done. 

Meanwhile, Nabis somersault has irked Mohammedan Sporting officials. We will see that Nabi gets a harsh punishment. We are going to file a case of fraud against him as he took Rs 5 lakh as an advance. We will even knock the AIFF door and if necessary the Fifa, said secretary Sultan Ahmed. 

Ahmed also wrote a letter to the IFA on Friday requesting the state body not to register Nabi as an East Bengal player.

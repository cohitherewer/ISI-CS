The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Harare: Zimbabwe?s soccer boss has been jailed for two years for breaking into and stealing from a car, 14 years after a court upheld his conviction in a case that local media said had been forgotten.

 Rafik Khan, chairman of the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA), was sent to prison late on Monday after returning from Johannesburg where he was commissioner for a African Champions League game, court officials confirmed. But they declined to discuss details of the case, saying Khan could still challenge his imprisonment at the High Court.

 Paris: A new Uefa Champions League trophy will be unveiled at the traditional handover ceremony in Paris on Friday as the competition celebrates its 50th year.

 The silverware ? engraved with the names of all the previous winners ? will be presented by former Real Madrid winger Francisco ?Paco? Gento and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to Uefa chief executive Lars-Christer Olsson.

 Liverpool were allowed to keep the previous trophy permanently after they won the title for a fifth time with a thrilling comeback win over AC Milan last season.

 Stockholm: The goalie in Sweden?s silver medal-winning Olympic team will become the first woman to play in a senior men?s ice-hockey league game this week.

 Kim Martin, 19, will play for Malmo Redhawks in the men?s second division on Wednesday against Bofors. In the Turin Olympics semi-final against the US, Martin saved 37 of 39 shots and then stonewalled four American shooters in a penalty shootout. The Swedes lost to Canada in the final.

 Athens: The lawyer of two Greek sprinters facing a two-year ban for missing a dope test at the 2004 Athens Olympics accused the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency on Tuesday of being prejudiced against his clients. WADA chief Richard Pound said on Monday that lawyers for sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have on purpose delayed the case which is still pending at CAS some 19 months after the alleged anti-doping rule violation.

 ?His implication that lawyers are responsible for the delay has no foundation or substance and is wholly unfair and prejudicial,? Gregory Ioannidis said.

 Tokyo: Japan?s sports minister Kenji 

 Kosaka has been forced to apologise for a public gaffe after 

 saying he was very happy to see Russian figure skating star 

 Irina Slutskaya fall at the Turin Winter Olympics. Two-time 

 world champion Slutskaya fell on a combination of jumps, 

 clearing the way for Japan?s Shizuka Arakawa to take the 

 gold medal. In a statement posted on his website, Kosaka 

 admitted his remark ?slurred Arakawa?s winning of the gold 

 with her real ability.?

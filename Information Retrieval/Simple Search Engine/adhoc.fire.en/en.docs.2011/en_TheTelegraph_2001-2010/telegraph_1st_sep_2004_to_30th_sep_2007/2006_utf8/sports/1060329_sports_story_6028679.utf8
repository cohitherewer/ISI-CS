The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chisty is the man to follow 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Imran Chisty is the man to follow in Wednesdays 10-event card. The champion jockey has been declared to ride some potential winners like Favourable Returns, Remarquable, Star Phoenix and Bold Display.

 Favourable Returns, in particular, may cash in on her weight advantage in the 1,600m Grand Annual Handicap. The Warrshan-Amazing Returns daughter enjoys a significant pull of 5-1/2kg from her main rival, Aerona.

 In the terms race, the 1,400m Midnight Cowboy Cup, Remarquable takes on his stablemate Senor Pele, who is handsomely placed at the weights but may find his age a stopper.

 Chistys Star Phoenix and Bold Display may, however, have to fight out the issue with Alcades and Body And Soul in their respective events ? the 1,600m B.S.F. Trophy and the 1,100m High Born Handicap.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

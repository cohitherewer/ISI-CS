 India may still have little too much firepower

Englands one-day form is one of the enduring mysteries of Duncan Fletchers six-year tenure as coach. Meticulously, almost brick by brick, he has built a fine Test team. As with all the best teams ? and never has it been displayed more than in the last month ? the whole adds up to more than the sum of its parts. 

Yet in one-day cricket, Englands progress under Fletcher has been haphazard. Just 12 months away from the World Cup, the gulf between Englands Test and one-day status is as great as ever. 

Partly, this comes down to the limitations imposed on the coach by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). Fletcher has long called for a bigger pool of centrally contracted players, but financial constraints (which are hard to believe given the scale of the ECBs junket to Mumbai) have, by and large, limited the offers to Test players only. 

A bigger pool of contracted players would result in a bigger pool of better and more complete cricketers in both forms of the game. After all, how many great one-day International cricketers has 40-over domestic cricket ever produced? 

In this instance, the uncertainty surrounding the make-up of Englands one-day team for the seven ODIs which begin on Tuesday in Delhi is explained more by circumstance than poor planning or confusion. 

Of the original squad selected for the second stage of this tour, no fewer than five ? Ashley Giles, Michael Vaughan, Marcus Trescothick, Simon Jones and Stephen Harmison ? have pulled out through a combination of injury and the unexplained. England are left with a dangerously inexperienced squad. Andrew Flintoff is the most capped, and will raise his bat for his hundred at Faridabad, while his opposite number, Rahul Dravid, is galloping towards his 300th. Still, the success on this tour of debutants such as Alastair Cook and Owais Shah during the Test series is enough to dispel the myth that experience is everything and, besides, England can only hide behind the inexperience excuse for so long. 

Between now and the next World Cup, England will play a minimum of 30 ODIs, plus whatever the Champions Trophy brings. That is more than enough time to put things right. 

Once this tour is over, Englands selectors will have to make some hard decisions. For example, will Michael Vaughan and Ashley Giles be fit enough to play a full part in both forms of the game? Will Trescothick make himself available for the punishing schedule next winter? And have the selectors finally called time on Darren Goughs colourful international career? What happens over the coming weeks will provide clues to the answers to some of those questions and help shape the look of Englands next World Cup squad. 

After Flintoffs outstanding performance as stand-in for Vaughan, captaincy will inspire the most debate. It is difficult to praise Flintoffs leadership during the Test series too highly. 

Flintoff, of course, has a monumental challenge during the next two weeks. He wont find it easy to refocus in the aftermath of the Mumbai Test and a visit home to see his new-born son for the first time. Englands chances rest on his ability to renew himself. 

A week ago, I would have made India overwhelming favourites to take the one-day series, but the elbow injury to Sachin Tendulkar and the crushing defeat in Mumbai has levelled the playing field. Indeed, how far the Test defeat in Mumbai affects Indias morale should play a big role in deciding which way the series goes. 

As well as Sehwag, Englands bowlers found and exploited weaknesses in every top order Indian batsman bar Rahul Dravid. Suddenly, Yuvraj Singh looked loose and vulnerable outside the off-stump; Mahendra Singh Dhoni looked little more than a schoolboy slogger ? with even less spine ? and the Little Master, Sachin, had his vulnerability to the short, rising ball exposed. 

Sachins absence means that India can continue the process of preparing for the day when they will have to do without him. For the public, that process has already started. They booed Sachin on his home patch, and throughout the series the new golden boy, Dhoni, received the louder cheers. Dravid, too, was booed after the Mumbai loss and with the Sourav Ganguly issue simmering away under the surface, India remain as unsettled as England. 

India, buoyed by the support of what will be massive crowds, may still have a little too much firepower.

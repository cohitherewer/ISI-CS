The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its target 50 now 

 for doubles ace

 - Mahesh wants to bring legends to India

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Bhupathi in the city on Wednesday

Calcutta: Setting goals is easy, achieving them not always so. There are some who keep revising targets, driven by repeated failure. Then there are those who have mastered the art of fulfilling ambitions. Mahesh Bhupathi can jolly well claim to be a member of the second category. 

His 10-Slam achievement is well documented. The other day, in Beijing, he clinched the China Open crown with Mario Ancic for his maiden ATP triumph in 2006.One of the goals I had set for myself was to win at least one (mens doubles) title every year Im happy to have got my first one this year, Bhupathi told The Telegraph. 

Its not that the year had been barren for the Indian doubles ace. How can we forget his famous mixed doubles conquest with Hingis at the Australian Open? But almost nine months had passed by without a solitary triumph in his bread-and-butter event (mens doubles). In fact, the last time he had lifted a trophy was in January 2005, in Sydney. 

To go without success for a period of 20 months can devastate the best of pros. Did he start having self-doubts? 

I had no doubts about my tennis at all during this period. I was thinking about it and telling myself that if I was playing badly, I wouldnt have won two mixed doubles titles in the last 12 months, Bhupathi argued. 

Isnt it time now to move on and set a new goal? For a man with 38 mens doubles titles in his kitty, what about the round figure of half a century? Yeah, 50 titles would be a nice way to end my career, thats on my mind. I am 12 short, so if I can have two good years 

I also want another shot at an Olympic medal with Leander (Paes) thatll be in 2008, so hopefully by that time I would be close to that magic figure, said Bhupathi. 

That was the player talking. How does the managing director feel seeing Martina Hingis playing in Calcutta and a strong mens field lined up for the inuagural ATP Mumbai meet next week? 

Its hugely satisfying when I walked out on the CCI centre court (venue of the ATP meet) for a workout on Tuesday, I couldnt believe the transformation the place had gone through I felt so good. This is what I wanted to do give back to the game which has given me so much. God has been really kind to me. 

Two WTA and one ATP events on the plate, whats the next big tennis event lined up? 

I would like to bring legends to India, for the fans who have never seen them in flesh and blood, informed Bhupathi.But that may not happen before 2008.Not just his playing career, not just his company which has been doing well, Bhupathi is also proud of the Elite academy he started at the start of the year. 

Eight talented kids under chief coach Mose Navarra (a former Italian pro) are doing really well. A 14-year-old recently won an U-18 ITF title, a 16-year-old won the U-18 national crown I have reason to be optimistic about their future, said Bhupathi.

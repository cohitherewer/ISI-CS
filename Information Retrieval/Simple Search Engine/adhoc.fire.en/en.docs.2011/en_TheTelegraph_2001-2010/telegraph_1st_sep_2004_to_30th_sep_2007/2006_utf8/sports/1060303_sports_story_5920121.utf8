 Ponting, Symonds ruled out of 2nd ODI

Cape Town: Captain Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds have been ruled out of the Australian team for the second one-day International against South Africa on Friday, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Thursday. 

Ponting has an abdominal strain, while allrounder Symonds has a thigh strain. 

Although Ricky was unhampered by his injury in batting and fielding sessions today (Thursday), we consider it more prudent to rest him tomorrow (Friday), considering the length of time since the injury, a CA release on Thursday quoted team physiotherapist Errol Alcott as saying. 

We will continue further treatment and cricket activity, and will review his availability for Sundays game in due course. 

The teams meet in the third one-day international in Port Elizabeth on Sunday. 

Andrew Symonds had a batting session in the nets today (Thursday) and Alcott is happy with his progress, the CA release said. 

He will continue to receive treatment and his progress will be monitored. 

Ponting and Symonds missed the first game in the five-match series which South Africa won by six wickets in Centurion on Sunday. (Reuters)

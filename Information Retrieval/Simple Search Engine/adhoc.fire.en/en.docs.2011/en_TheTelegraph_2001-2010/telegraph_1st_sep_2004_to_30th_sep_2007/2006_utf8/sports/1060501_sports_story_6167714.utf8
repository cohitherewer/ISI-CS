 Title for Nadal 

 Barcelona Open

 Barcelona: Rafael Nadal 

 outmuscled fellow Spaniard Tommy Robredo 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 to 

 win the Barcelona Open on Sunday for his 47th consecutive 

 claycourt win.

 Nadal moved ahead of Bjorn Borg 

 into second place in the Open Era list of consecutive wins 

 on the surface.

 I think I usually play my 

 best matches when I get to the final, Nadal said.

 Hair misses out on promotion

London: Controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair failed to make it to the 24-member umpires list for Englands first-class and County matches in the next season but has been retained in the reserve list. 

With umpire David Constant retiring at the end of the 2006 season, there was speculation that Hair would be promoted to the full list. 

But Constants place was taken by former England batsman Tim Robinson who was previously on the reserve list, according to the list announced by the ECB. 

Meanwhile, Hair is a favourite to fill a new position at the MCC as guardian of laws. 

A spokesman of MCC said that the club would invite applications for the full-time executive post which would be filled by a former umpire or player with a legal knowledge and understanding of how the sport is run. (Agencies)

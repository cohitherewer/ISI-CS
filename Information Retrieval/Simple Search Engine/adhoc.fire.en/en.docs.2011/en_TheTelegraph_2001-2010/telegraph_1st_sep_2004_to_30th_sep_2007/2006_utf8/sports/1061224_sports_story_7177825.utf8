The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No age verification at U-19 meet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: In Chennai on Friday, the Bengal team manager had to rush to the railway station to buy return tickets after his team was disqualified from the Under-13 football festival for registering over-aged players. Seven other state teams suffered a similar fate after the AIFF asked all the participants to go through medical tests. 

The scene, however, is totally different in the under-19 National Championships for the BC Roy Trophy currently in progress in Bhilai. According to reports reaching here, the majority of the eight participating teams have fielded quite a few over-aged footballers and no step has been taken to bar them from participating. 

The secretary of the Chattisgarh Football Association, BN Neogi told The Telegraph on Saturday that no proper medical tests have been conducted to stop the over-aged players from playing. 

Here, only the match commissioner, Mr Krishnamurthy from Tamil Nadu, hand-picked around half a dozen players and barred them from playing, Neogi said. We fully understand that there are many players here above the stipulated age of 19 years, but little can be done in this matter. 

The AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said that it was not mandatory to do the age verification tests in the Under-19 tournaments. According to Fifa guidelines, it should be done till the Under-17 level.

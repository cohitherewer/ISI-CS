 India to fight for last place 

Moenchengladbach: Indias exasperating sequence of defeats continued in familiar fashion as they again conceded late goals to go down 2-3 to Argentina in a 9-12 positions classification match on Saturday. 

Arjun Halappa (4th), Rajpal Singh (55th) scored for the Indian while Matias Vila (40th, 61st) and Matias Paredes (51st) sounded the boards for the opponents. India now run the risk of finishing with a wooden spoon as they meet South Africa in the 11-12 positions play-off match on Sunday. 

In another match, The Netherlands overcame New Zealand 3-0 to finish seventh. Two goals by Roderick Weushtof (34th, 49th) on either side of Taeke Taekemas 40th minute conversion was the highlight of the Dutch victory. 

Meanwhile, Fih and IOC will jointly launch a project to revive Indian hockey, IOC president Jacques Rogge said on Saturday. (PTI)

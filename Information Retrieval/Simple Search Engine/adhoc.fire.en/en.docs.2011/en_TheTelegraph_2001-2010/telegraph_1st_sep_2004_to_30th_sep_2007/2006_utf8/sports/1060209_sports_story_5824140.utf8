The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Code of Conduct has been breached, say visitors

 - Inzamam terms Indians unsportsmanlike in his column 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Islamabad: The controversy over Inzamam-ul Haqs obstructing the field dismissal in the opening one-dayer in Peshawar refuses to die. The Indians are furious after the Pakistan captain went public with his views in his column in a local daily on Wednesday, saying that the appeal was against the spirit of the game and could harm relations between the two countries. 

The team management feels that Inzamam has breached the ICC Code of Conduct and Match Referee Chris Broad should look into the matter. No official complaint has, however, been lodged. 

Its there in print for everyone to see? A complaint is not always necessary. Whatever needs to be done should be done immediately. The Match Referee just cant sit on it, an influential member of the touring party told The Telegraph. 

It has been learnt that the matter will be brought to the notice of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Shaharyar Khan. I will speak to Shaharyar? Inzamam saying that the incident will harm relations between the two countries is a serious matter. This can be damaging, said the Indian who didnt wish to be named. 

Captain Rahul Dravid, at the centre of Inzamams attack, didnt however comment on the issue. 

The PCB, it may be recalled, had drawn (Test series) Match Referee Ranjan Madugalles attention to Chappells comments on Shoaib Akhtars action to an Indian channel during the third Test. 

Broad, back after a round of golf in the afternoon, was non-committal. I know what my job is. I am not going to be dictated by the media. 

I havent seen the article. Whatever needs to be done will be taken care of. Obviously I am not going to divulge anything, the Match Referee explained. 

Inzamam was scathing. He wrote: In my role as Pakistan captain, I would say that the appeal by the Indian fielders was against the spirit of cricket. Certainly, there are several modes in which a batsman can be declared out, but many of them are not in the spirit of the game? 

The Indian fielders appealed when the Peshawar match was in a crucial state. I would not have imagined that Rahul Dravid and his team would do such a thing. I am not bothered about my dismissal but an appeal made in an unsportsmanlike manner by the visiting team can have an adverse affect on the relations between the two opponents. 

I have surely impressed on my team not to make much of the incident. However, in my personal opinion the appeal was not made in a sporting manner. Instead, it just might have left a bad taste in the mouth.

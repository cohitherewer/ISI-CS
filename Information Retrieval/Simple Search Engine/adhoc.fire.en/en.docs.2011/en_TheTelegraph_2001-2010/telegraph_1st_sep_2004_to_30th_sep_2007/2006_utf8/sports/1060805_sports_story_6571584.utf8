Leeds: Kevin Pietersen took the lead role in his own drama on Friday to help England close on 347 for six after the first day of the third Test against Pakistan. 

The South Africa-born batsman rode his luck to complete his fifth Test century before retiring hurt with cramp in his left forearm at Headingley. 

Ian Bell, having hit centuries in each of the first two games of the series, was on 66 not out. Matthew Hoggard was dismissed with the final ball of the day by fast bowler Umar Gul, who took four for 73. 

Pietersen, on 104 not out, was set to resume his innings alongside Bell on Saturday. England lead the four-match series 1-0. 

On an intriguing, incident-packed day, most of the luck on offer went to Pietersen, while most of the cursing was left to Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq. 

The 26-year-old Pietersen could have been out on three times. 

On two, he appeared to inside-edge a ball from fast-medium bowler Shahid Nazir via his hip to the wicketkeeper only to be given not out. On 29, another inside edge, off Nazir, was caught only for a no-ball to be called. 

To add insult to injury, Pietersen was also dropped shortly after getting to his century, again off the bowling of the long-suffering Nazir. 

Pietersen is a colourful man with a taste for milking his best moments, and he did so with his hundred in his sights. 

Facing Mohammed Sami in the final session, he began the over on 87 and hit successive three fours, interrupted by two visits from the physio, before scampering to his century. He hit 15 fours and two sixes, both off leg spinner Danish Kaneria, to get to the mark off 123 deliveries. 

Shortly afterwards he summoned the physio again and made way for wicketkeeper Chris Read. 

Pietersens innings he had not got past 50 in six previous attempts meant that five of Englands top six have scored hundreds in the series. The odd man out is Marcus Trescothick. 

The left-handed opener, himself without a Test fifty in eight innings, helped put on 67 for the first wicket after England opted to bat before two wickets fell in five balls without a run being added. 

Sami changed ends and changed the mood as Trescothick, having clattered six fours in his 28, drove a return catch back to the strike bowler who accepted it at the second attempt. Nazir then removed Strauss for a fluent 36, angling one across the England captain who edged to second slip.

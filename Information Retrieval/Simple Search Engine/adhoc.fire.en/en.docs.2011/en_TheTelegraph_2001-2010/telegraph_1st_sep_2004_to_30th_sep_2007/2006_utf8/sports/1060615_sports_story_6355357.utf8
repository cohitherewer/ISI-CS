 Spanish win inspires Nadal

 London: Spains spectacular 

 start to their World Cup finals campaign inspired Rafael 

 Nadal to make an impressive debut at the Stella Artois Championships 

 on Wednesday. 

The French Open champion had been glued to a television set in the Queens Club locker room as he followed the fortunes of his national soccer team against Ukraine. 

But with Spain scenting a memorable victory in Leipzig, Nadal reluctantly had to go on court and focus on his own battle against American Mardy Fish at the grasscourt championships in London. 

I saw the match until 3-0 and then I had to go on court, Nadal said following his 7-6, 6-1 win over Fish. 

 By the time Nadal completed his 75-minute win over 

 his American opponent, Spains soccer team were celebrating 

 a 4-0 win and the 20-year-old was in buoyant mood.

 Murali on retirement 

Sydney: Sri Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan hinted he may retire next year, an Australian newspaper reported on Friday. 

The newspaper quoted the 33-year-old Muralidharan saying the impending birth of his first child and the wear and tear of 14 years of international cricket had caused him to re-think his future. 

I will play until 2007, then keep an open mind about whether to play or not, he said. 

I have got married. In another 10 days time, I will get a baby boy. I am looking forward to that. I have enjoyed my cricket for 15, 16 years. Now I have my family life, the ace off-spinner said.

 PCB to probe drugs scandal

 Mohammed Asif 

Islamabad: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Monday decided to set up a high-level committee to probe into the drug scandal involving speedsters Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif and recommend necessary action. 

PCB chief Dr Nasim Ashraf said it was the first-ever instance of a Pakistani player testing positive for a banned drug and it was taking the matter very seriously. 

We are taking this issue very seriously. It is the first time that our players have been found positive and we will take action accordingly, he said at a press conference here on Monday. 

Ashraf also felt that the PCB had done the right thing by disclosing the results of the tests and recalling the bowlers. 

Unfortunately, I have no doubt that their absence is going to be a big setback to our chances of doing well in the tournament. But the important thing is we have to do the right thing and we did the right thing, he said. (PTI)

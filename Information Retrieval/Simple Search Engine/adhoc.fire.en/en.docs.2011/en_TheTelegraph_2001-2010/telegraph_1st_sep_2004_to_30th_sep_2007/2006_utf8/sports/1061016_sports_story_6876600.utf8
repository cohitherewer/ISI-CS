The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal sure of netting three points vs Goa

 - Santosh trophy 

 - Abhra to replace injured Sandip 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nabi has the full backing of coach Prasanta 

Gurgaon: There was a time when a clash between Bengal and Goa would be considered the ultimate show of strength in the national championships. The two states had been involved in many a memorable matches, which went down as epic battles in the history of domestic football. 

With the passage of time, though Goa have been able to retain their image of super powers, Bengal have lost much of their sheen. 

Yet the Group A quarter final league match between the two at the Devi Lal Sports Complex here on Monday will be watched with keen interest as it may turn out to be a battle of survival for both. 

While Goa are without a point after biting the dust against Punjab, Bengal are not too comfortable either, despite their three-point act against Haryana in the opener. 

The ever-flexible rule-book of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has at least solved one Bengal problem. 

The 29-time champions have been allowed to register a fresh goalkeeper East Bengals Abhra Mondal in place of injured Sandip Nandy. 

Nandys shoulder injury was a blow for Bengal and India as well. Even the AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, called up Nandy late on Saturday to wish him speedy recovery before Indias next match against Yemen in the Asian Cup qualifiers on November 15. 

But, then, Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee is still not in a position to call the shots against Goa. 

Barring Nandy, he is set to field the same side that played against Haryana and hopes that striker Dipendu Biswas, who will be leading the team now in absence of Nandy, gets adequate support from the other forward, Syed Rahim Nabi. 

I have explained the position to Nabi during the practice session Sunday morning, said Banerjee. I am sure he will deliver the goods this time. I am confident my team will beat Goa, which they are very much capable of. I would like to get three points on Monday assure the semi-final berth. 

Like his Bengal counterpart, Maurice Afonso is also confident about the victory. 

We didnt do well against Punjab, but that wont be the case against Bengal, he said. 

Monday I am going to field Freddy Mascarenhas and Anthony Pereira in the forwardline with Peter Carvalho in the midfield. We will go all out for victory. 

The unimaginative scheduling of Santosh Trophy has taken its toll on Bengal and Goa. Both states were in the midst of their local league when the tournament was scheduled. 

Neither Banerjee nor Afonso got enough time for combined practice. It was clearly evident in their display.

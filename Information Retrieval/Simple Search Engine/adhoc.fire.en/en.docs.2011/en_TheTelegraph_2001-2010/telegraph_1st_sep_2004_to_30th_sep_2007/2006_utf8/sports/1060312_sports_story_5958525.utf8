 Monty will be tested: Gatting

Mohali: Former England captain Mike Gatting said rookie spinner Monty Panesar has the potential to be an asset for the team but his temperament would be tested against India. 

It would be interesting to see what would be the approach of the India. They may try to hit him out of the attack and it is here Montys temperament will be tested, Gatting said. 

Monty can be a great asset to the England team. I have seen him bowl for Northhampton and he has shown great attitude in the Nagpur Test. 

Monty can be a great support to Ashley Giles and the duo can cause a lot of trouble to the best batsmen, he added. 

Gatting appreciated Andrew Flintoff for leading his young team very well. 

Andrew is a down to earth guy and this young bunch is playing well in the absence of Michael Vaughan and (Marcus) Trescothick. Alastair Cook has also shown what he is capable of, he said. 

But they need to be more consistent for the World Cup to be played in the West Indies next year and in that view the ODI series would be of much significance. 

The ODI series in India is also crucial. India are a formidable side and it will give everybody an idea how well the English will play against them. Ahead of the World Cup, you have got to be more consistent, Gatting said.

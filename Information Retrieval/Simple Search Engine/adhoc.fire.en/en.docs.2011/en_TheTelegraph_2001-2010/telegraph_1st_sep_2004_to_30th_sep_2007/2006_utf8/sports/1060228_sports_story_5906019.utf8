 Ogilvy with the trophy on Sunday 

Carlsbad: Australias Geoff Ogilvy pulled off an upset victory at the WGC-Accenture Match-Play Championship, beating veteran American Davis Love III 3 amp;2 in Sundays 36-hole final. 

Ogilvy, who qualified for the elite field of 64 at La Costa Resort and Spa by winning the Tucson Classic 12 months ago, clinched the title when both players conceded each other par-threes at the 34th hole. 

This in unbelievable, a smiling Ogilvy said after receiving the winners cheque for $1.35 million. I got lucky the first four days and the last two games I played really well. 

I made some really big putts. I dont think I missed a putt which I had to make all week, added the Australian, who completed a tournament record of 129 holes over the five days. 

This is very special. 

Ogilvy, world-ranked 53rd, led Love one up after the morning round and stretched his advantage to three with his sixth birdie of the day at the 22nd hole. 

Although former major champion Love trimmed the deficit to one midway through the afternoon round, Ogilvy tightened his grip by winning the 29th, 30th and 32nd holes. 

Love holed a 12-foot birdie putt at the par-four 33rd to keep his fading hopes alive before Ogilvy conviniently wrapped up the second PGA Tour victory of his career at the next.The 28-year-old from Adelaide became the second Australian to claim an individual World Golf Championships (WGC) title, after 2002 NEC-Invitational champion Craig Parry. 

I wanted to make a good run today (Sunday), but I just didnt hit enough good iron shots when I had to and Geoff did, said Love, winner of the 1997 US PGA Championship. It was a good week for me, but not a good day. 

Ogilvy rose 27 places to a career-best 26th in the world rankings issued on Monday after his win. 

American Kirk Tripletts victory at the PGA Tours Tucson Classic helped him climb 55 places to 85th.

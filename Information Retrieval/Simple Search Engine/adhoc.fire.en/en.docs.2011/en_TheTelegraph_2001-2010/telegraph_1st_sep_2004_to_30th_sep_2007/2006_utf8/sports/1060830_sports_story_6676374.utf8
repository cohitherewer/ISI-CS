New York: Sania Mirza breezed into the second round of the US Open by getting the better of higher-ranked Karolina Sprem of Croatia. 

The 19-year-old Hyderabadi served with consistency and hit attacking groundstrokes to outplay her opponent, ranked 51 in the world, 6-4, 6-2. 

The Indian ace now has a tough task ahead of her as she will take on Italian 14th seed Francesca Schiavone. 

Sania traded early breaks of serve at the start of the match, but got the crucial advantage in the 10th game to pocket the first set. 

This motivated her to raise her game in the second, and the Croat had few answers to the Indians game. 

Sania quickly took a 4-1 lead and never relinquished control thereafter, sealing the win in 75 minutes. 

Her serve, widely considered one her weaknesses, won her 71 per cent of points on the first delivery and 57 per cent on her second. 

The 22-year-old Sprem did not help her cause by spraying 33 unforced errors, in comparison to Sanias 21. 

Though Sprem had the bigger serve, she committed four double faults to Sanias none. 

After the match, Sania said sticking to her game plan helped her against a potentially tough rival. 

I stuck to my game plan. She was a tough player to get in the first round. She has been in the top 15 in the world. 

My serving was the key. Hardcourt is my favourite surface. Its faster than at the Australian and the French and New York is my favourite place, she said.

Moscow: Top-seeded Nikolay Davydenko defeated Max Mirnyi 6-3, 7-5 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Kremlin Cup. He will face Fabrice Santoro. 

Davydenko, ranked fifth, saved three breakpoints in the eleventh game of the second set. Seventh-seeded Santoro made it to the final four with a 6-3, 7-5 win over Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany. 

In the womens event, US Open champion Maria Sharapova pulled out with a foot injury ahead of her quarter final against fellow Russian teenager Anna Chakvetadze. 

Fifth-seeded Nadia Petrova advanced to her second straight semi-final with a 7-5, 6-1 win over compatriot Vera Zvonareva. Petrova won the WTA Stuttgart meet last weekend her fifth title this season and has not dropped a set in four matches here. 

In the semi-finals, Petrova faces top-ranked Amelie Mauresmo or eighth-seeded Nicole Vaidisova. 

Mauresmo held on to beat Elena Vesnina of Russia 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) on Thursday. In the quarter finals, Mauresmo will face Vaidisova of the Czech Republic. 

Second-seeded Sharapova, who led record 15 Russians in the main draw, beat Ekaterina Bychkova in straight sets on Wednesday. She withdrew with an injury to her right foot. (AP)

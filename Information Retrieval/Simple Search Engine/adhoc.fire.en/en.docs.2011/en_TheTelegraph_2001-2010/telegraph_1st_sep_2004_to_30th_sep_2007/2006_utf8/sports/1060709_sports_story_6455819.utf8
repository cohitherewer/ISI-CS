 SA President allays Cup fears

Berlin: South African President Thabo Mbeki on Saturday said fears that his country was not financially or logistically equipped to host the football World Cup 2010 were unfounded. 

Mbeki said South Africa was convinced it could fulfil all of Fifas requirements for hosting the event, which has never been held in Africa before. 

We engaged in detailed discussion about what Fifa expected of the host country and that included matters of financial guarantees, he said after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 

So we have done all of the sums and all of the calculations and we are quite satisfied that we will be able to meet these obligations. 

Concerns have been voiced about hosting the worlds biggest sports event in a country, battling high crime and lacking in adequate transport infrastructure and hotels. 

South Africa also needs to upgrade existing football stadiums and build new ones, as the sport lived in the shadow of rugby during the apartheid era. 

The country is budgeting 5.5 billion rands ($770 million) for stadiums and a further eight billion rands to upgrade airports and the public transport system. 

Mbeki insisted that the technical, logistical base for 2010 is quite strong and said that this years budget already contained provisions for the World Cup. 

He added that South African officials have spent months in Germany learning from the current edition and the German organisers have offered to come and plan the next one. (AFP)

 Three-wkt win for WI

Kuala Lumpur: The West Indies survived a typical middle-order collapse to pull off a shock three-wicket victory over Australia on Monday and more or less confirmed their place in the tri-series final. 

Chasing 273, the Caribbeans were cruising at 242 for three before they lost four wickets for 13 runs to give the world champions a glimmer of hope. 

But Dwayne Bravo (37 ..) and wicketkeeper-batsman Carlton Baugh Jr (7 ..) held on to their nerves to see their team home with 16 balls to spare in the day-night clash at the Kinrara Oval. 

Opener Chris Gayle made a well-paced 79 to provide the West Indies with a solid start despite a few early hiccups. 

Captain Brian Lara then hit an accomplished 87, and in the company of Gayle, put on 151 runs for the third-wicket before the Aussies fought their way back with some spirited bowling and fielding. 

Australias total of 272 for six was built around stand-in captain Michael Husseys unbeaten 109, his maiden one-day hundred, and an equally aggressive 70 by Brad Haddin. 

The win gave four points to the West Indies and pushed their tally to nine from three matches, which would assure them of a final berth irrespective of the results in the remaining two matches. 

The result also means India (2 points) and Australia (7) must win their remaining ties to make it to Sundays final. 

Earlier, 31-year old Hussey forged a 166-run partnership with Haddin that was instrumental in Australias recovery from 104 for five. 

The left-hander hit 10 fours and three sixes in his 90-ball knock, while Haddin struck three fours and four sixes in 76 balls. 

Matthew Hayden, playing in his first match of the tour, made a solid 49 and the Queensland opener steered the Australians out of early trouble when they were reduced to 64 for four. 

The Windies seemed to be heading towards a comfortable win when Gayle and Lara were at the crease. 

 The two left-handers were hardly 

 troubled by the Aussie bowling that looked toothless without 

 McGrath and Mitchell Johnson.

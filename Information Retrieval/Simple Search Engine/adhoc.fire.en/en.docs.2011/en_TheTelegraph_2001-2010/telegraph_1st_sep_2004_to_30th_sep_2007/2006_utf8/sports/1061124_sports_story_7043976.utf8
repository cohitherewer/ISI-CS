The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Grinning in defeat! What a shame

 - Time for an internal Code of Conduct with intra-team sanctions

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: A decade ago, an incensed 

 Sunil Gavaskar was pushed into commenting that Sachin Tendulkar 

 and Anil Kumble were the only two Indian cricketers 

 (at that point in time) who actually got affected 

 by defeats. One could add a few names, but the list will 

 remain very short. 

Its a sad reality. Worse, theres little to suggest things are going to change. 

Late on Wednesday, for example, it was shocking to find Munaf Patel grinning as he came out to take guard (in Durban) with India on 85 for nine, facing one of their most humiliating defeats. The village lad couldnt have taken the team to 249, but he should at least have cut out that sickening act. 

Munaf (who bowled well, no doubt) alone can answer what was so funny, but its unlikely that well get anywhere close to the much-talked about next level till our cricketers realise its a shame to lose so badly. 

 Tripuras Samiran Chakraborty 

 is no more, but hed ticked off Ajay Jadeja for grinning 

 as India were heading towards a big defeat in the 1996-97 

 seasons first tournament, in Sri Lanka. The then manager 

 acted after The Telegraph asked how could 

 any cricketer be amused by a terrible performance. 

Its not known whether Greg Chappell saw Munaf grin, but predecessor John Wright (supposedly soft) would have promptly told him just what he thought about his behaviour. Like the Australians, we need an internal Code of Conduct and intra-team sanctions. 

While the South Africans recovered splendidly from three down for 63, the Indians were content slipping deeper into a hole which was of their making. A bit further and they would have ended in the Indian Ocean, which isnt far from Kingsmead. 

The bounce in Durban, incidentally, cant be an excuse. At the highest level, every cricketer is expected to handle all conditions. In any case, what has stopped the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) from ensuring that domestic matches are on wickets which test batsmen? 

Clearly, it gets down to priorities. Right now, the BCCI wants to finish its one-time president, Jagmohan Dalmiya. Everything else, therefore, has to wait. 

Less than a month ago, selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar candidly said there was no outstanding talent. It sparked a debate. Today, after months of such poor cricket, the question to be asked is: Is everybody worthy of his place? 

We dont need a debate. 

 The optimists are hoping for a turnaround, but its 

 going to be a surprise (in the ODIs, at least) if Rahul 

 Dravids men surprise the South Africans.

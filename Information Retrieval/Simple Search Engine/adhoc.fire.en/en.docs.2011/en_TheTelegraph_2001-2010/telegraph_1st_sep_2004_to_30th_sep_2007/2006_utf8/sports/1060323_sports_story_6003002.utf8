 Pak clinch series, ICC meet berth

 - Lanka have to qualify for Champions Trophy 

Colombo: Pakistan booked a place in the ICC Champions Trophy later this year after defeating Sri Lanka by four wickets in their third and final ODI to win the series 2-0 on Wednesday. 

Pakistans comfortable win assured them ? and also England ? a place in the top-six of the ICCs official rankings at the declared cut-off date of April 1. 

Sri Lanka will now have to go through a qualification process with the West Indies, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh/Kenya prior to the eight-team tournament to be staged in India in October. 

The hosts were unable to defend a modest 225-run target after another below-par performance from their batsmen and lost with 4.4 overs to spare. 

Allrounder Shoaib Malik blasted a quick 46 from 38 balls as an opener and was supported by fellow-opener Imran Farhat, who scored 46 from 52 balls. 

Mohammad Yousufs fine form continued as he contributed a solid 53, carrying Pakistan to the verge of victory before being dismissed. 

Leg-spinning allrounder Shahid Afridi had starred with the ball earlier in the day, claiming three for 37 from 10 overs as Sri Lanka lost their way after a solid start, collapsing from a promising 93 for one to 156 for six.

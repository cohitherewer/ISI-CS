Michael Ballack missed regeneration training this morning because he has a small problem with his foot, Bierhoff told reporters. Its now being examined and treated. But apart from that, were happy to have all the players fit. 

Team spokesman Harald Stenger said he could not enlarge on Bierhoffs statement. 

Ballack was on the receiving end of several hard tackles in Saturdays 2-0 win over Sweden that took Germany into the quarterfinals, but showed no signs of an injury. 

He sat out Germanys opening 4-2 win over Costa Rica on June 9 after injuring his right calf muscle.

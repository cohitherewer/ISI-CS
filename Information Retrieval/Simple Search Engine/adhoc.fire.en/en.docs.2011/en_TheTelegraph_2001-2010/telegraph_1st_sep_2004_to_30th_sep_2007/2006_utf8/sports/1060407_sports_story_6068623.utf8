 Tendulkarback home 

 - Maestro can train with a light bat from May 1: BCCI 

 Sachin can bat from May 1 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar returned home Wednesday from London after undergoing an arthroscopic surgery to his right shoulder on March 27. 

He returned on Wednesday, sources said, adding that his arrival was kept under wraps to avoid media glare. 

Dr Andrew Wallace performed the surgery in London to stabilise Tendulkars shoulder joint and reattach a damaged bicep tendon to his upper arm bone. 

The maestro was diagnosed with a posterior labrum tear of the right shoulder during the third Test against England in Mumbai last month, which ruled him out of the ongoing seven-match one-day series against the tourists. His arm was put in a sling after the surgery. 

Meanwhile, Sachins chances of playing on the tour of the West Indies received a boost, after it emerged that he can commence batting with a light bat from early next month. The maestro has been advised a 26-day rehabilitation programme after which he is expected to start his training, the BCCI said in a statement on Thursday. 

The master batsmans rehab has been split into three phases, with the final phase running from April 22 to May 1. 

The aim of this (third) period is to regain full range of shoulder movements, graded increases of the strength and control of the shoulder (and scapulae), improve cardiovascular function and to commence light-bat training by beginning of May, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Thursday. 

Lara comes calling 

Meanwhile, Sachin met Brian Lara ? who is on a personal visit ? at a five-star hotel near the Mumbai airport on Thursday. 

It was a personal and private meeting between Tendulkar and Lara, a source said. (Agencies)

 Sanaa shocks big-serving Brenda

 - I had no idea shes a former world No. 9, says Indian 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sanaa Bhambri had just notched up the biggest win of her tennis career, but she was not even aware of it. 

Fresh from causing the first ripple at the Sunfeast Open, by beating former world No. 9 Brenda Schultz-McCarthy of The Netherlands 0-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9-7) in the first round of the qualifiers on Friday, Sanaa said: Wow That was huge. I had no idea she is a former world No. 9. 

In fact, before stepping on to the court, I did not know anything about her. Looking at how tall she is, I thought she must be having a good serve, but that was it, said the Indian Bhambri, who is currently ranked 691. 

Schultz-McCarthy, ranked 301 in the latest WTA list, holds the record for the fastest serve clocked on the WTA Tour a 130 mph delivery during the qualifiers of the Cincinnati event in July. 

The 36-year-old won seven singles and nine doubles titles during her prime between 1990-97. The Dutchwomans career was plagued by injuries, however, and after a meteoric rise to world No. 9 by May 20, 1996, she was off tennis from 2000 to 2004 following a back surgery for a herniated disc. 

Sanaa was blown away in the first set. 

I didnt understand what was happening, the Indian said at the post-match press conference, adding, it just slipped me by. From the second set, I started to make her play, hoping she would make mistakes. 

Schultz-McCarthy, who had earlier beaten top-ranked players like Jennifer Capriati, Monica Seles, Lindsay Davenport and Amelie Mauresmo, began making a lot of errors once Sanaa started reading her serves. 

The Indian won the second 6-3 and clinched the thrilling tie-breaker 9-7. 

It is always difficult to beat a player within the top-350. But once I started returning her serves, she made a lot of unforced errors. 

Sanaa admitted that not knowing her opponent was a former top-10 player may have actually helped her. Well, I guess if I had known about her reputation, it would have been a little difficult.

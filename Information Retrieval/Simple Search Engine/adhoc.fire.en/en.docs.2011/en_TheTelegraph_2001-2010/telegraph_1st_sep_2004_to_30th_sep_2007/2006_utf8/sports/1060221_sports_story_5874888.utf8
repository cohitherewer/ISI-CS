 Dhoni scores on arrival too

 - Tips from Holding, Waqar motivated me, says Sreesanth 

New Delhi/Kochi: If ever a proof of Mahendra Singh Dhonis steep rise on popularity charts was needed, it was there in ample measure when some of the Indian cricketers arrived from Pakistan here on Monday morning. 

Players like Mohammed Kaif, RP Singh, Suresh Raina, Gautam Gambhir and Murali Kartik had to beat a hasty retreat to allow a sizeable crowd at the Indira Gandhi Airport to have a go at their favourite star which happened be to be no other than Dhoni. 

Sporting Team India T-shirt and flashy goggles that rested nicely on his golden-streaked mane, Dhoni himself was taken by surprise to see the crowd chanting his name and jostling with one another to catch a glimpse of him. 

It all went on to prove that Doni has not only become an inseparable part of the cricket team but with his rock-star looks, he has elevated himself to stardom status. 

That the latest pin-up boy of Indian cricket has beaten everyone when it comes to popularity could be gauged from the way fans rooted for him and credited him for the successful ODI series in Pakistan. 

What was a motley crowd initially, swelled in numbers as the news spread that Dhoni was among those arriving from Pakistan. 

A nearly one-hour wait, since the PIA flight landed at 12.15, was not an issue for the fans standing outside the VIP exit to catch a glimpse of the Indian crickets latest power hitter. 

And when finally Dhoni showed up, the fans tried to get near him, sparking off a commotion. 

Security persons formed a ring around the cricketer and faced a tough time in escorting him to the vehicle outside even as the other players, including Kaif made a quiet exit. 

Medias wait for bytes vanished as everything went haywire in the commotion. 

Meanwhile, in Kochi, tips from fast bowling greats Michael Holding and Waqar Younis has been a motivating factor for Indias promising paceman Sreesanth. 

The tips I got from former great fast bowlers, including Pakistans Waqar Younis and Michael Holding of the West Indies also motivated me. It was a nice gesture from them. It really helped me, the Kerala speedster said. 

Twenty-three-year old Sreesanth, who became the second Kerala cricketer to get into the Indian side, when he was chosen for the Sri Lankan series in 2005, after fast bowler Tinu Yohannan four years ago, said the Pakistan tour had been a great experience for him. 

Sreesanth, who impressed everyone with his ability to bowl at a good pace and generate swing captured six wickets in five ODIs, with four for 58 in the fifth and final one-dayer in Karachi being his overall best performance. 

He expressed confidence that the team would win the coming Test and one-day series against the visiting England team. 

Sreesanth, who has been included in the board President XI to play against England in the three-dayer in Baroda, said he would leave for Baroda on Wednesday. (PTI)

 Hanif in hospital, but stable

Karachi: Former Pakistan cricket captain Hanif Mohammed was in a stable condition after undergoing a successful right knee joint aspiration at a local hospital on Wednesday. 

Hanif was hospitalised in a critical condition on Tuesday evening after his knees, operated nearly 44 years ago, were locked, temporarily paralysing the lower half of his body. 

Hanif ? known for his 970-minute knock of 337 against the West Indies in 1958 at the Kensington Oval, followed up with 499 in a domestic first-class game in Karachi ? said that the left-knee joint aspiration would be done on Thursday. 

I am feeling more comfortable (after the right knee joint aspiration) as there is better movement as compared to yesterday when I couldnt feel any sensation in the legs. The left (knee) is still swollen and the scans have revealed minor broken pieces inside. But there will be no minor or major surgery but just a little denting. 

Hanif was rushed to a local hospital on Tuesday evening and underwent a series of tests for a suspected stroke. 

Dr Wajid Ali, a leading orthopedic surgeon, said Hanif was a patient of arthritis and the knees were possibly locked because of spasm or strain in lower back.

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: Decks have been cleared for the second time to put together the truncated winter season following a temporary truce between the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) authorities and the trainers. As a result, the season will resume from Friday.

 Trainers agreed to withdraw their agitation following an assurance from the Karnataka Racehorse Owners Association that BTC would attend to their grievance in three weeks time. The trainers have been denied entries after BTC stopped them from using mobile phones during the race time .

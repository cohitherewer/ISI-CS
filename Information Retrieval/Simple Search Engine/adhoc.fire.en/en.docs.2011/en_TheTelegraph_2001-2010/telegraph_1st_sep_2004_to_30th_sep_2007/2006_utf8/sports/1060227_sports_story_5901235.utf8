 Dubai: Eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi will skip the claycourt season this year in a bid to be fit for Wimbledon.

 The 35-year old American has struggled with injury in recent seasons including a nagging back problem that requires cortisone injections.

 It caused the 1992 champion to miss Wimbledon last year and he has played only two events since losing to Roger Federer in Septembers US Open final. Agassi is choosing the tournaments he plays with care and believes he is no longer able to make a real impact on clay.

 New Delhi: India?s luge athlete Shiva Keshavan also boycotted the valedictory ceremony of 2006 winter Olympic Games in Turin after missing its inauguration, on being dumped as the country?s flagbearer. 

 ?I was fed up of the situation at the Olympic Village and left before the closing ceremony,? Keshavan, who finished 25th in the luge event said from Florence.

 Without naming the Winter Games Federation of India, Keshavan also alleged that sports officials had stolen and diverted funds sanctioned for him.

 Manchester: Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze is winning his battle to be fit for the World Cup finals in Germany starting in June, according to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.

 Heinze looked likely to miss the tournament after suffering a knee injury in a Champions League match at Vilarreal on September 14. 

 But after a successful operation to repair cruciate ligament damage, the 27-year-old has been working his way back to full fitness in Argentina. 

 ?His progress is very good now. He?s on full throttle and training very well every day,? Ferguson said. 

 ?Our latest development is that he will possibly be here at the beginning of April with the possibility of playing before the end of the season.?

 Heinze said earlier this week he was aiming to start playing in a month?s time.

 Skelton finished with blood gushing from the 

 top of his head, struggling to stay on his feet. The judges 

 scored the fight 115-114, 114-115 and 116-113 in Williams? 

 favour as his last-round heroics tipped the balance in the

Cincinnati: Seventh seeded Martin Damm and Leander Paes reached the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Masters on Friday. 

The Indo-Czech pair defeated No. 3 seeds, Mark Knowles-Daniel Nestor 3-6, 7-5, 10-4. 

Damm and Paes, winner of one ATP event in sHertogenbosch and runner-up at the Australian Open, broke Knowles-Nestor on two occasions, saving four points themselves in the 93-minute encounter. 

Damm-Paes will take on defending champions and No. 2 seeds, Jonas Bjorkman-Max Mirnyi week. 

Meanwhile, second seed Rafael Nadal lost 6-7, 6-7 to an inspired Juan Carlos Ferrero in the quarter finals on Friday (as briefly reported on Saturdays Late City edition). British teenager Andy Murrays run also came to an end. 

Ferrero had not won a set in his previous four meetings with Nadal but out-fought his fellow-Spaniard to set up a semi-final clash with compatriot Tommy Robredo, who knocked out fourth-seeded Croat Ivan Ljubicic 7-6, 6-2. 

For sure I didnt play the best match of my life but I wasnt very bad, Nadal told reporters. He played a good match. Thats all. 

The world No. 2, who won his second consecutive French Open title in June, broke serve on his way to a 3-1 lead but Ferrero broke back in the fifth game and then played a superb tiebreak to move ahead. 

The unseeded Ferrero saved two break points at 4-4 in the second set and, following a 32-minute rain break, snatched the tie-break 7-3 to clinch his biggest victory of the year. 

Its a very special win for me because Nadal is one of the best players in the world, said the 2003 French Open champion . 

Despite the defeat, Nadal was upbeat about the state of his game with the US Open on the horizon later this month. 

I improved a lot here from Toronto (last week), he said. Now I am disappointed but I reached the quarter final so it is not a very bad tournament. 

Robredo saved three set points in the first-set tie-break as he beat third seed Ljubicic for the first time in five meetings. 

 Murray, who beat world number one Roger Federer in the second round, bowed out of the event with a 6-3 6-4 defeat by American Andy Roddick. 

Roddick will play Chilean Fernando Gonzalez in the semi-finals after the 13th seed beat Spanish 10th seed David Ferrer 6-2, 6-4. (Agencies)

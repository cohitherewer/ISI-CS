The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Blues fancied on Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Form may hold good in most of the six-events on Thursday, the opening day of the winter season. But some allowances need to be given to those horses who were expected to do well during the monsoon season but failed. The winter track could provide them a fresh opportunity to justify their previous form.

 Trainer Daniel Davids ward Best Of The Blues does not need to prove his credentials. The Warrshan colt has had a fruitful last winter and he also did well during the wet season. With Imran Chisty in the saddle, he is expected to strike it rich in the Rising Star Cup.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Baskaran has changed mentality

 - Hari Prasad was the find of the Azlan cup

 Stickwork 

 Gurbux Singh

 When the whole worlds attention 

 is on the World Cup football, many Indians may not know 

 what Indian hockey team has done in recent times. Almost 

 unnoticed, the under-21 team won a title in Poland early 

 this month. Their feat came following victories over Germany 

 and Pakistan.

 Perhaps as a follow-up, came the 

 senior teams much-improved show in the Azlan Shah 

 Cup. After quite some time, we made a podium finish when 

 V. Baskarans side defeated New Zealand in the third 

 play play-off. I must say, this is a huge confidence-booster 

 in that we couldnt maintain consistency in the previous 

 tournaments and the team hardly lived up to peoples 

 expectations.

 As a build-up to the Sydney Olympics 

 in 2000, yours truly was manager and the same Baskaran at 

 the helm of team when India finished third in the Malaysian 

 tournament. Six year down the line many changes have taken 

 place in Indian hockey and seeing the current side emulating 

 that feat is pretty heartening.

 We lost 0-1 to Holland in the 

 semi-finals, who then put up a sublime show in the final, 

 walloping Australia 6-2. The title-decider was a real treat 

 to watch and the game was elevated to a new level. 

 Such an open and passing game 

 Holland and Australia had played reminds me of the golden 

 era of India-Pakistan clashes. I would particularly mention 

 name of Hollands De Nooijer ?? the goal he scored 

 against the Aussies and his distribution of passes belonged 

 to an out-of-the-world class.

 Australia, however, surprised 

 me by including a lone goalkeeper in the squad. 

 I think forward Hari Prasad was 

 the find of the tournament. Probodh Tirkey was slightly 

 out of touch, but the midfield showed great promise. We 

 have now new-look forwardline with Hari and Tejbir Singh 

 and if they maintain consistency, we can easily hope for 

 a better show in the coming World Cup.

 Except for Germany and Spain, 

 all the leading teams of the world took part in this tournament. 

 Finishing third, therefore, obviously, points to a promise. 

 I would rather attribute this to Baskarans association 

 with the team. 

 He has successfully managed to 

 inject a dose of confidence into the team and the boys are 

 responding to it with their hearts. 

 Theres no denying the fact 

 that with the change of coach, mentality of Indian hockey 

 players has also come for good.

 For every promise, there is pressure. 

 Baskarans side has just 

 made a good beginning and maintaining it is now his biggest 

 challenge. Hope these boys will prove me wrong.

Doha: Pawina Thongsuk set a world record to end Thailands 40-year wait for an Asian Games weightlifting gold medal on Monday, ending Chinas monopoly at the competition in Doha. 

The 27-year-old Olympic champion clean and jerked 142kg to beat the mark set by Russian Svetlana Shimkova by 1kg and take possession of all three records in the middleweight class. 

Chinas world champion Ouyang Xiaofang had to be carried from the stage after crumpling to the floor during her attempt to clean and jerk 137kgs. 

South Koreas impressive equestrian record continued when they won the team dressage event for the fourth time in the last five Games. 

The South Korean team-member Suh Jung-kyuns gold was his sixth at the Asian Games in his career. He had previously won gold medals in 1986 and 1998 both team and individual and in 2002 (team), making him the most successful rider in the history of the Games.

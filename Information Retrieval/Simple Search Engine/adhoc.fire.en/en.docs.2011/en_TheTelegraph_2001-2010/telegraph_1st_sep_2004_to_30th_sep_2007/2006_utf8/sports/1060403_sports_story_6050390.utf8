 Mickelson 8 strokes ahead 

Duluth: Phil Mickelson turned the BellSouth Classic into a race for second place on Saturday, forging eight strokes clear after the third round at the TPC at Sugarloaf. 

Six ahead overnight, the defending champion fired a five-under-par 67 to finish on a record-equalling total of 21-under 195. 

Chasing his first victory of the year and his third BellSouth title, Mickelson tightened his grip with five consecutive birdies, racing to the turn in five-under 31. 

Despite missing a three-footer for par on 16 and running up a double-bogey seven at the last after twice finding water, Mickelson picked up three shots on the back nine to close in on his 28th PGA Tour title. 

Its probably a positive because the last thing I want to do is have a record or be thinking about it, the world number four told reporters of his faltering finish. 

Thats not my goal right now. Its to get my game sharp and to get some momentum for next week (for the US Masters). 

The American left-hander matched the tournaments 54-hole record of 21-under 195, set by compatriot Larry Nelson in 1988 when the event was played at Atlanta Country Club. 

Two more Americans, Zach Johnson (64) and Jonathan Byrd (66), were tied for second at 13 under with Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal a further stroke back in fourth after a 69.I dont know where hes playing, 2004 champion Johnson said of Mickelsons golf over the last three days. Hes obviously driving it very well, hitting his irons very well and putting well. Thats a hard combination to beat, especially when you combine his talent in general and his experience.

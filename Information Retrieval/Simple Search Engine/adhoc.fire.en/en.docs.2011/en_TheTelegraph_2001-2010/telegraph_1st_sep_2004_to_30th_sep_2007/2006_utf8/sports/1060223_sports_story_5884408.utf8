Bogra: Bangladesh held their nerve to record a four wicket win over Sri Lanka in the second ODI on Wednesday, easing to the victory target of 213 for six with two overs to spare in registering a first one-day triumph over the visitors. 

Mohammed Ashraful led the home side with a stylish 51 as Bangladesh evened up the three-match series at 1-1 in a contest reduced to 49 overs a side after fog delayed the start. 

Javed Omar (40), Habibul Bashar (33) and Aftab Ahmed (32 not out) contributed valuable runs for the home side who can now boast one-day victories over Sri Lanka, Australia, Pakistan and India. 

Sri Lanka had recently stretched Australia to the deciding final in the VB Series. 

A packed stadium chanted Bangladesh, Bangladesh as the delighted players completed a lap of honour. 

Earlier, Bangladesh vindicated their decision to ask the tourists to bat after they won the toss by dismissing Sri Lanka for 212, despite a sparkling 96 from Sanath Jayasuriya. 

Jayasuriya hit eight fours and a six in his 110-ball knock, but was given little support by his teammates as Sri Lanka lost wickets at regular intervals. 

Kumar Sangakkara (23) and Farvez Mahroof (21) were the only other batsmen to score more than 20 runs against an inspired attack, whose six bowlers took at least a wicket apiece. 

Syed Rasel was the pick of the bowlers, the paceman finishing with figures of two for 28 in his 10 overs after claiming the first wicket to fall in the fourth over. 

Mohammed Rafique (two for 40) and Alok Kapali (two for 29) also chipped in with two wickets each as the home side took control of the contest, two days after they lost the series opener by five wickets at the same ground. 

The third match is in Chittagong on Saturday before the sides play two Test.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav to bat at No.4

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Moin-ud-Dowlah Meet

 Deep Dasgupta 

 Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly 

 will bat at No.4 in the first innings in CAB XIs opening 

 match versus MCA XI in the Moin-ud-Dowlah meet. However, 

 in the second innings, he may open the batting.

 According to the rules of the 

 tournament, the first innings will be 90 overs-a-side, while 

 the second essay will be a 40 overs affair. The former India 

 captain took a morning flight out of the city on Tuesday 

 and practised with the team at the Gymkhana ground in Hyderabad 

 in the afternoon.

 The wicket, however, has kept 

 the CAB XI undecided about their bowling combination. There 

 was a slight drizzle in the evening and the conditions were 

 overcast. A third seamer Ashok Dinda could come in handy, 

 but the possibility of playing a second spinner in the form 

 of rookie Amit Banerjee cannot be ruled out. The final decision 

 will be taken on Wednesday morning.

 The wicket has been dry 

 for the last two days. Theres some grass and it will 

 aid seamers at the start, Deep Dasgupta told The 

 Telegraph from Hyderabad.

 The MCA XI, led by Wasim Jaffer, 

 includes the likes of Bhavin Thakkar and Avishkar Salvi, 

 and Deep is not taking things for granted. The opposition 

 is largely unknown. Apart from a few players, the side consists 

 of fringe players. Moreover, they can never be taken lightly, 

 Deep said.

 This is also the first game 

 of the season for us A lot of guys will wish to perform 

 and come into the limelight ahead of the Challenger and 

 Irani trophies, the CAB XI captain added.

 Meanwhile, Subhojit Paul, who 

 was injured during nets on Monday, is fit.

 CAB XI (likely): Deep Dasgupta, 

 Arindam Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Sourav Ganguly, Rohan 

 Gavaskar, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tewari, Surashish Lahiri, 

 Sanjib Sanyal/Ashok Dinda/Amit Banerjee, Ranadeb Bose, Shib 

 Shankar Paul.

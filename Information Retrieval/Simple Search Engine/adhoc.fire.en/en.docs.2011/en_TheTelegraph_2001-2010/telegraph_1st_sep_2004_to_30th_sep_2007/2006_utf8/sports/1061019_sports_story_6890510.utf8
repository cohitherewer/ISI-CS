The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 This was only the beginning, says Prasanta

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Gurgaon: The hard-fought 1-0 victory over Punjab has brought the smiles back on the face of Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee. After taking the team to the semi-finals of the Santosh Trophy for the first time in the millennium, Banerjee announced he has many more surprises in store for the next two matches. 

It was only the beginning, the Bengal coach said. In the next three days of practice, this team will get better and better. Now we are aiming for the trophy, nothing less than that. No matter who the opponents be, Kerala or Maharashtra, Bengal will go all out for a victory. 

Both Banerjee and Bengal captain Dipendu Biswas were full of praises for the midfielders, especially Tapan Maity and Asim Das. Yesterday night, we held a meeting. There we decided to use these two new boys as they have a fast approach, said Biswas. I told them this was the chance to show their mettle. 

Biswas said he was relieved. Back in Calcutta fans would have criticised us severely. The seasoned striker said he was confident of scoring from the free-kick. 

The best comment came from coach Banerjee. At least the next year Bengal wont have to play in the cluster phase. As a former Bengal player, I felt it was simply insulting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nobody bends backwards for the Dravids

 - The BCCI didnt study Team Indias schedule in the manner CA and the ECB wouldve done 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kingston: Any visiting team would have raved and ranted had the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) scheduled practice sessions around 30kms from the team hotel. The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) has done just that, but neither Rahul Dravid nor Greg Chappell can complain. 

Reason being nobody in the BCCI studied Team Indias schedule in a manner Cricket Australia or the England amp; Wales Cricket Board would have done. Theres one office-bearer who keeps talking about the millions the BCCI is earning, but he should first ensure that the players on-tour comforts are looked after. 

Indeed, Sharad Pawar and his team must get the basics right. 

On Sunday, the Indians had to practise at Chedwin Park, past the Blue Mountain range and the Spanish Town and... It seemed an endless drive... It was the same on Monday, the last session before Tuesdays tour-opener against the Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) XI in Montego Bay. 

The BCCI, in fact, ought to have insisted that match No.1 be slotted here itself. The Jamaican capital, after all, is hosting the first two ODIs (on Thursday and Saturday). Because its not in Kingston, the team will be flying to MoBay when its early on Tuesday in India and return immediately after the face-off. 

If the mandarins back home cant push for simple things, they should at least stop bending backwards to oblige touring teams. Is anybody really bothered about us? asked one of the stars in a chat with The Telegraph. He answered himself: No. 

 Ramesh Powar hurt his 

 right ankle during Mondays workout, in simulated match 

 conditions, but the team management announced he was fine.

 Meanwhile, the Indians may field 

 the XI which played the 2005-06 seasons last ODI (Abu 

 Dhabi, versus Pakistan). On form, that was our best 

 team and it makes sense to play our strongest in the only 

 warm-up match before the series, remarked a member 

 of the team management. 

If that indeed is how the XI shapes up, then Mohammed Kaif wont find a place. Kaif has struggled in the ODIs this year and must consider himself very lucky to be in the West Indies? He made it wholly because of the captain and coachs backing. 

That winning XI in Abu Dhabi, by the way, included five specialist bowlers. Unless theres a rethink, the strategy wont change. Incidentally, the Indians havent played competitive cricket for almost a month. 

 Captained by Wavell Hinds, the JCA XI is going 

 to be strong, as Dravid acknowledged on arrival here. 

 The squad, announced a few days ago, includes Chris Gayle, 

 Marlon Samuels, Daren Powell and Jermaine Lawson.

 TEAMS 

India (likely): Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan, Ajit Agarkar, Ramesh Powar, Harbhajan Singh, Sreesanth. 

JCA XI (from): Wavell Hinds, Chris Gayle, Donovan Pagon, Marlon Samuels, Daren Powell, Jerome Taylor, Nikita Miller, Carlton Baugh (Jr), Jermaine Lawson, Tamar Lambert, Bevon Brown, Danza Hyatt, Andrew Richardson, Damion Ebanks, Donovon Sinclair.

 SHARP SINGLES 

 McGrath yorks critics

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath has hit back at criticism that he was on the decline and said he himself would call it quits the day he felt he was no longer contributing to the team. 

 An irked McGrath, who bowled a fine spell on Sunday, said he was not around on an ego trip and people who had criticised him in recent times should have a word with him before making any statement. It would have been nice if some of the people who publicly criticised me this week had sat down and had a chat with me before making their statements. Im no different to anyone else in this summers Ashes campaign. The fact is, if I felt I had had enough or that I was no longer contributing to the team, you wouldnt see me for dust, McGrath said in an article in an Australian paper. 

Im not going to be out to prove anyone wrong this summer, because thats never been my go. 

Ashraf support 

Karachi: Adopting a soft approach, PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf has decided to overlook the teams humiliating Champions Trophy exit and back the players. I fully back our team in this hour of need and encourage them to get out of this bad phase, Ashraf said.

Losing and winning is a routine matter. We should overlook some defeats if we want better results in future mega events, he was quoted as saying in a paper. Pakistan returned home Saturday after suffering a 124-run defeat at the hands of South Africa.

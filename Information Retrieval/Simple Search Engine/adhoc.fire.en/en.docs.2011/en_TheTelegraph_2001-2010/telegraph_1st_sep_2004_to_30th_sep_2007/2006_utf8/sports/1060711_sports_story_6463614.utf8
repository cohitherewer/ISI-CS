 WORLD CUP CASUALTIES

 Dick Advocaat 

The South Korean coach will now travel to Russia to take charge of a club side after the Korean federation made it clear that he was no more welcome with the national team. His assistant Pim Veerbeek has been elevated to his post. 

 Michael Ballack 

The German captains aspirations to play a World Cup final ended on a sore note. Given his dwindling form and injury-prone health, he is unlikely to feature in another World Cup. 

 David Beckham 

The marketing guru of world football quit as England captain immediately after the quarter final defeat. 

 Cafu 

Unlike Roberto Carlos, the Brazilian captain has not announced his retirement, but he is unlikely to be recalled. The 36-year-old side-back has now been the target of ridicule for stretching his career this far. 

 Roberto Carlos 

Once regarded as worlds best overlapping defender, Carlos announced his retirement from international soccer after failing to check Thierry Henry from scoring the all-important goal against Brazil. 

 Leonardo Cufre 

Set a record of getting a four-match ban without playing a single minute for Argentina after he led a pitched battle with German players after the quarter final. 

 Branko Ivankovic 

The Iran federation has been talking to many coaches and has made up their mind to remove the Croatian born manager. 

 Oliver Kahn 

The former German captain, sidelined till the semi-finals, has ended his World Cup career on a high note. Constantly in news for his bickering with coach Klinsmann and Lehmann, Kahn made some spectacular saves in the match for third-place play-off against Portugal. 

 Henrik Larsson 

The record goal-scorer for Sweden called it quits after he missed a crucial penalty against Germany. 

 Koji Nakata 

Known as the best Asian striker, Nakata called it a day after his uninspiring show for Japan. 

 Ruud van Nistelrooy 

The great Manchester United striker ended his last World Cup campaign without getting a feel of the pitch against Portugal, thanks to The Netherlands coach Marco van Basten. 

 Jose Pekerman 

The high-profile Argentine coach has bowed out in disgrace after being widely criticised for his substitution policy against Germany. He has decided not to renew his contract despite requests from the players and Argentine federation. 

 Graham Poll 

The top English referee was tipped to supervise the final. In the end, he called it a day after flashing three yellow cards to one player in a match. 

 Wayne Rooney 

Termed the hope of England, Rooney did not score a single goal and all he earned was a two-match ban for a nasty foul on Ricardo Carvalho of Portugal. 

 Zico 

White Peles World Cup campaign as a coach also ended in a disaster. The Japan federation has appointed former Yugoslavia coach Ivica Osim. 

Note: Some of the best names for the past one decade have played their last World Cup in Germany. While Zidane announced his retirement long back, Spain captain Raul, along with Pauleta and Portugal skipper Figo, have decided to quit. Two very big names of Italian football ? Francesco Totti and Alessandro Del Piero ? also played their last World Cup. Same may be said about a host of players in the French squad like Thierry Henry, Lilian Thuram, Fabien Barthez, Claude Makelele, Patrick Vieira and David Trezeguet.

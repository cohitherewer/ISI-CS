 Sobers: WI have a good chance

Port of Spain: Not many would like to put their money on an unpredictable West Indies to win the World Cup but the legendary Gary Sobers certainly would. 

Sobers believes Brian Laras men turned the corner after defeating India in the one-dayers at home recently and stand a good chance of winning the premier tournament which unfolds in the Caribbean in March-April next year. 

I think that weve got a good chance (of winning the World Cup). I think weve turned the corner, he said. 

When we played against India, it showed signs that we have turned the corner and I hope we will continue to progress from there, the former captain was quoted as saying by a newspaper on Monday. 

According to him, the team would perform a lot better if it is freed of some of the interferences. 

West Indies cricket has suffered tremendously with all the interferences over the years and a team can never be balanced or can never work well with so many interferences. 

A team needs continuity and West Indies cricket really hasnt had the continuity in the last five or six years. There have been always problems one way or the other. 

We hope that they will be settled and youll see West Indies cricket back on the right path again, said the great, who scored 8,032 runs and took 235 wickets in 93 Tests. 

The West Indies leave on Wednesday for Kuala Lumpu.

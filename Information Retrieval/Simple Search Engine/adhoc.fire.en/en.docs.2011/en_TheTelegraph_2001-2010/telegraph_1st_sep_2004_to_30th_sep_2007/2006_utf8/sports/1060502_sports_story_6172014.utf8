 England 

 jinxed, says assistant coach Grip 

 London: England assistant 

 manager Tord Grip fears the squad are jinxed after the latest 

 injury setbacks affecting Wayne Rooney and Michael Owen. 

 R 

ooneys fractured metatarsal in his right foot and Michael Owens on-going discomfort after recovery from a similar problem are the latest issues to concern England, while Tottenham defender Ledley King broke his foot last month while Arsenal left-back Ashley Cole is still to make a full comeback after a similar problem sustained back in October. 

 Grip believes it is becoming a recurring theme, telling 

 a British tabloid: I saw poor Wayne lying there and 

 thought Oh no, here we go again ? another injury before 

 the World Cup. It happened before with David Beckham, now 

 it is happening again. It happens every tournament and it 

 has happened to Wayne Rooney before.

 Mourinhos helping hand 

 London: Jose Mourinho has offered to rest his senior England trio from the last two games of the season to help Sven-Goran Eriksson. The England boss needs a boost and since Chelsea have already clinched the Premiership title, Mourinho says he is happy to protect John Terry, Frank Lampard and Joe Cole by leaving them out of the last two games of the season. 

 My relationship with Sven is very good. I said 

 to him: If you want my players to finish after weve 

 played Manchester United, they will finish then. I 

 gave him that choice. Im ready to help England if 

 they think it is a help.

 Angola request 

 Maseru: Angola want Fifa to allow Portuguese-based players Pedro Emanuel and Chainho to change their allegiance in time to play at the World Cup. Angolan Football Federation vice-president Jose Luis Prata said he was travelling to Fifas headquarters in Zurich on Monday in a bid to gain permission for the two players to appear for the World Cup debutants. 

Porto defender Emanuel, 31, a former Portuguese under-21 international, has finally agreed to play for Angola after rejecting several previous offers from the country of his birth. Angolan-born Chainho, 31, who represented Portugal at junior level, is a midfielder with Maritimo. He has previously played for Porto and top Greek club Panathinaikos.

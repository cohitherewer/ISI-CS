The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A career neither starts nor ends with a hattrick 

 - The moment should be enjoyed, but the achiever has to move on, says the legendary Holding 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Karachi: Irfan Pathans maiden Test hattrick was a first for Michael Whispering Death Holding as well ? till Sunday, he hadnt seen one in Tests. A member of the (TV) commentary panel for the ongoing series, the legendary Holding (249 Tests wickets and 142 in ODIs) spoke to The Telegraph during one of his breaks. 

The following are excerpts 

On the hattricks watched at the highest level 

In Tests, Pathans the first... I cant think of any other... I didnt get one myself, or else I would have given you an absolute first person account! In the ODIs, though, I saw South African Charl Langeveldt get it in the West Indies last year... Bridgetown, I think. 

On the significance of a hattrick 

Nothing much after that moment has been reached... The moment should be enjoyed, but the hattrick achiever has to move on... Get more wickets... Perhaps, another hattrick... 

On whether hes disappointed at not being in the hattrickwallahs club 

No... Talking to you, I recall at least one instance when I was on a hattrick ? in Perth (1975-76)... I thought Id got Jeff Thomson leg-before, but the umpire ruled otherwise. 

On others in the famed quartet ? Andy Roberts, Joel Garner and Colin Croft ? also not getting it 

Well, Andy would have got one at Old Trafford, if I recall correctly, in 1976... Pat Pocock edged to Gordon Greenidge, but he put it down in the slips cordon... Greenidge was otherwise a very fine catcher. 

On the emotions while delivering the hattrick ball 

Theres excitement, the blood pumps faster... One needs to be calm and repeat what fetched the first two wickets... (Laughs) Of course, its easier said than done as the tendency is to get carried away... Often, the ball is either down leg or wide outside the off-stump... 

On Pathans bowling in the first two Tests 

Look, I wouldnt judge any bowler on those two (Lahore, Faisalabad) wickets. 

On Pathans grip 

As Ive conveyed (in Faisalabad), he can grip it better to allow for a more effective release... He will have to work on it at nets and I appreciate he cant change during a tour. Zaheer Khan and (Rudra Pratap) Singh have a neater grip. 

On whether Pathan is now going to be under more pressure 

Why? He has to move ahead... A career neither starts nor ends with a hattrick. 

Finally, on Pakistans collapse in the first hour 

The Pakistani batsmen are lazy... Theyre accustomed to flat wickets and dont know how to play close to the body... Theyve got to adapt to all conditions ? for example, a wicket with rich moisture content. Pathan and the rest bowled well, but the batsmen contributed to their own downfall.

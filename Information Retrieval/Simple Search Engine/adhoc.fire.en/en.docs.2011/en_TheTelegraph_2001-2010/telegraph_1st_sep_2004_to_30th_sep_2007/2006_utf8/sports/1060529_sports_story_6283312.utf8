The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Target is Olympic gold: Saina 

SANJIB GUHA 

Calcutta: After Pullela Gopichand and Sania Mirza, Hyderabad has dropped yet another bombshell on the racquet sports circuit ? Saina Nehwal ? who became the first Indian woman to win a four-star badminton event (Philippines Open) on Saturday. 

No Indian woman has ever made it beyond the quarters and so it is indeed a performance that needs to be recognised by all Indians, Sainas coach Gopichand said. 

Saina, who has just attained her Sweet 16, was overjoyed with Sundays triumph and has already started nurturing the dream of winning Olympic gold in future. Winning a gold in the Olympics is my ultimate goal, Saina told The Telegraph from Manila, on the eve of her departure for a six-star event in the quake-ravaged Indonesian. 

Currently ranked No. 86, the teenaged prodigy is targeting breaking into the top 30 by this year-end, but if she fails in achieving that, her world wont break down. 

The young Hyderabad girl is well aware of her statemate and tennis sensation Sania Mirzas sensational progress in the circuit. She admitted that Sanias presence on the WTA Tour has changed the outlook of other Indian sportspersons towards women, but she politely made it a point that the latters performance hasnt had anything to do with hers. 

Yes, she (Sania) is the pride of all of us, but she is in a different sport and has nothing to do with mine, she maintained. 

In the same breath, she remarked that for international success, she had drawn inspiration from her coach Gopichands All-England Championship triumph more than five years ago and not Sanias sensational run in the 2005 Australian Open. 

On that day (March 11, 2001), when Sir (Gopichand) won the All-England title, I started dreaming doing something similar? I was always motivated by his feat, Saina revealed. 

Saina, however, will have to play qualifying rounds in the Indonesian Open. Since my ranking is low, I will have to overcome the qualifying hurdles, which is also not very easy, she said. 

According to her, any six-star tournament is a tougher challenge, as most of the top-class shuttlers will be vying for top honours there. 

Saina, though, is banking on her new-found confidence and never-say-die attitude. In Jakarta, the Chinese opponents will be the toughest to deal with, so I will have to raise my standards if I wish to attain anything meaningful there, she remarked.

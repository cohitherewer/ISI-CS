 Azzurris still turning to Riva

Duisburg: Luigi Gigi Riva is Italys connection between past and present. 

The 35 goals he scored between 1965 and 1974 is the most in Azzurri history. These days, Riva is Italys team manager, adding experience that players can draw from at the World Cup besides coach Marcello Lippi. 

Daniele De Rossi is facing a multi-game ban after bloodying the face of United States forward Brian McBride with his elbow in Saturdays 1-1 draw. 

While Lippi was letting the midfielder stew in his own broth for a while, Riva spoke casually with the midfielder. 

He knows he made a mistake. He told me he was very upset for his parents, since a lot of people have tried to interview them, and most of all for Lippi. The coach that had confidence in him in when he was struggling with Roma. 

It wouldnt be right if they banned him for four or five games. The replays are particularly cruel. The play itself wasnt that violent, Riva said. Hes a great kid and hes made two or three mistakes like this. Dont forget hes only 22-year-old. At 22, youre expected to make mistakes. 

Riva also addressed Filippo Inzaghis predicament. Inzaghi is the only forward on Italys team who hasnt played in the teams first two games.

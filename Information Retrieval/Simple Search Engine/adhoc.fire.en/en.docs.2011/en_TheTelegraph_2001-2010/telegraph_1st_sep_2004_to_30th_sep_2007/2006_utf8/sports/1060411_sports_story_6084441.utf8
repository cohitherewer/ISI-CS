 Mumbai gets Vietnam meet 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: From this year onwards, India will host two ATP tournaments, after Globosport asked for the rights to All India Tennis Association for holding another meet, which will be held in Mumbai from September 25 to October 1. 

We have received a letter from Globosport and will reply to them shortly saying that we are ready to hold the meet under the auspices of AITA, AITA secretary Anil Khanna told The Telegraph on Monday. 

According to an agency report from London, the Mumbai Open will replace the $380000 Vietnam Open slated for Ho Chin Minh City. 

Yes, after the cancellation of the Vietnam meet, Globosport approached us, Khanna confirmed. 

The other ATP meet is the Chennai Open, the last edition of which was won by Croat Ivan Ljubicic. 

However, the two WTA meets in Calcutta and Bangalore will be staged as usual. 

According to Khanna, this new meet will add one more feather to Indias cap. From now we have two ATP and as many WTA tournaments in the country, which is a good sign for the sport here, Khanna said.

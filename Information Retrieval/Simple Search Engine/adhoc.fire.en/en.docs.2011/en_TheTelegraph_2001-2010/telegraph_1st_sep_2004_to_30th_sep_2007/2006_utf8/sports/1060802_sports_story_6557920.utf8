 Dressing rooms arent churches

 - Wright plays down Gavaskars comment that players abused him 

 If it was done, it was done in Hindi, says Wright 

Christchurch: Dressing rooms arent churches, feels the former Team India coach, John Wright, playing down Sunil Gavaskars claim that he was abused by Indian players. 

Gavaskar, who acted as Indias batting consultant towards the end of Wrights tenure, had written in a column that the players used to abuse the former New Zealand captain. 

If it happened, it was done in Hindi and behind my back, which is exactly what I would have expected, Wright says in his recently-published book Indian Summers. 

When they trooped in after a sloppy session, I didnt pat them on the back... I asked them where the bloody effort was, he wrote. Puting it bluntly, he says: If some of them called me a grumpy old bastard when I left them to think about it, so what? It wasnt beach cricket, and dressing rooms arent churches. 

Wright said he always encouraged the boys to be honest and upfront. If a player thought I was stuffing up, he had every right to say so, either in private or in front of the team. I wasnt backward in letting them know what I thought of their performances, and I had no problem with them doing the same to me. 

The former cricketer says his intention was to create an honest and open environment where everyone could speak out without any fear. 

Most disagreements tended to be one-on-one behind closed doors, but if hard things had to be said in front of the entire group, so be it. We wanted an open and honest environment, and you only get that if everyone feels they can speak their mind without being jumped on and without people getting precious and taking offence. 

The relationship Wright enjoyed with former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly comes through, with the ex-coach acknowledging that this was the subject of as much media speculation and gossip as a Bollywood marriage. And like any marriage, there was a honeymoon period, then reality set in and we settled down for the long haul. 

Souravs high-handedness often annoyed Wright but he also secretly admired his rebellious streak. 

His high-handedness often annoyed me, but I secretly admired his rebellious streak because it gave the team some pepper and it got up opposition noses, most famously Steve Waughs. 

But there were issues on which they completely agreed. The players had grown up in a culture of seniors and juniors... We were united on this: it had to change. He was determined to create a new culture and did an admirable job of making the younger players feel that they belonged. 

Wright also credits Sourav for giving the youngsters the licence to bite and snarl and set a maverick and defiant tone. 

It was never going to be sweetness and light, but in the end the issues that divided us and there were a few were insubstantial compared to the cause in which we were united: to create a new team culture and give the most passionate nation in the world the team they deserved. (PTI)

 India down to seventh place

New Delhi: The dismal showing at the mens hockey World Cup in Moenchengladbach, Germany, has pushed India down to one place to be seventh in the latest world rankings. 

After suffering five defeats out of seven matches, including one win and one draw, the Indians could manage only an 11th place finish in the World Cup and gathered 350 points to slip from the sixth position. 

With 1418 points, India are now placed below Korea (1500), who are now sixth from eighth by virtue of their fourth place finish at the World Cup. 

Argentina (1275), who were at the seventh spot, have also paid the price for their lacklustre showing and gone down to the eighth spot in the rankings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Curator predicts a result 

Kingston: The Sabina Park pitch may not be a bowlers paradise anymore but it would almost certainly produce a result in the fourth and final Test, according to the chief curator. 

Barring rain, this Test will produce a winner, said Charlie, who has been in charge of the Sabina Park square for the past five decades. 

It could have something for the fast bowlers on the first day but overall, it shouldnt disappoint batsmen either. Batsmen who want to stick around will get runs while bowlers prepared to bend their backs will gain good purchase, he observed. 

At first glance, the pitch for the match, starting on Friday, doesnt seem to back his assertion. But Charlie has no doubt that a strong wind and sunshine over the next two days will produce the pitch he wants. 

Much of course depends on the conditions. I was deeply frustrated during my preparation for the ODIs last month when it rained just before the game was to begin. I hope its not the case this time, said the frail man. 

He said since it was live grass rolled on to the surface, it would keep sprouting during the match. 

Sabina Park is going through a metamorphosis. 

The ground was dug so deep it could swallow an elephant. But the square wasnt touched. From the edges, you could see the hard clay and baked surface but it wasnt touched, Charlie said, like the custodian of a national monument. (PTI)

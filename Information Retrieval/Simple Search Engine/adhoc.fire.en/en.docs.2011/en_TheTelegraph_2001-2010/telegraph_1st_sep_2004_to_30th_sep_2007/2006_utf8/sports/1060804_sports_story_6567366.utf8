 Jyoti cards 3-over 75

Malmo: Indifferent driving cost Jyoti Randhawa dear as he carded a three-over 75 in the first round of the Entercard Scandinavian Masters here. Marc Warren was leading at five-under with at least four players tied for second place at four-under. 

Randhawa had a rough day, finding just four of the 14 fairways, and reached only 50 per cent greens in regulation. He is tied 124th. (PTI)

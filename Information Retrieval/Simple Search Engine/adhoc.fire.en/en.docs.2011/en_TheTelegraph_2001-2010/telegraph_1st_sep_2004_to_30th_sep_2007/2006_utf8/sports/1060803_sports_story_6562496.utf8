 Gatlin masseur denies charge

 - DOPE CONTROVERSY 

 Gatlin 

Raleigh (North Carolina): Justin Gatlins masseur has denied comments by the sprinters coach that he applied a mysterious cream to the world and Olympic champion on the day he failed a doping test. 

Coach Trevor Graham said a masseur had put the cream on Gatlin at the Kansas Relays on April 22, identifying Chris Whetstine by name in an interview. 

Trevor Graham is not speaking on behalf of Justin Gatlin and the story about me is not true, Whetstine said in a statement released late on Tuesday by his attorney Elizabeth Baker. 

I have fully co-operated with the investigation into this matter, added Whetstine, who has worked as Gatlins masseur for much of the past three years. 

Graham, reached by mobile phone late on Tuesday, said he would comment on Whetstines statement later. Gatlin could not be reached. 

Gatlin said on Saturday he had tested positive for testosterone or its precursors at the relays on April 22. 

The 24-year-old American faces a life ban and the loss of the 100 metres world record he shares with Jamaican Asafa Powell if he is found to have committed a doping offence. 

Gatlin has denied knowingly taking performance-enhancing drugs and said he would work to clear his name. 

Graham said Whetstine had been upset with Gatlin because he thought the sprinter was responsible for him being fired earlier this year. 

Whetstine was later reinstated and has travelled with Gatlin to meets since April, the coach said. 

Graham said Whetstine had applied a whitish cream to Gatlins groin area and the back of his knees after the Kansas Relays. 

When I asked what is that? He (Whetstine) said, Get away. He then put it (a tube of the cream) in his pocket. 

Graham said he asked Gatlin if was he having problems with his groin area and his knee. He said, No, so I dropped it, Graham added. I have never seen that cream after that.

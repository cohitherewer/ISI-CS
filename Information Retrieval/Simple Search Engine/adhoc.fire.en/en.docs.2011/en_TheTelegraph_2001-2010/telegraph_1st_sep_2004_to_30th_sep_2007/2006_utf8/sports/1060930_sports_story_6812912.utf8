 Randhawa 3 strokes behind Woods

 - WGC CHAMPIONSHIP 

 - New course record by world No. 1 

Hertfordshire: Jyoti Randhawa trailed world No. 1 Tiger Woods by three strokes after carding a brilliant opening round of five-under 66 at the WGC American Express Championship Golf here on Thursday. 

Randhawa landed an eagle on his way to a tied-sixth place in one of the most star-studded fields for the $7.5-million event at the Dunhill Golf Links. 

Woods, the defending champion, had a sensational eight-under 63 with an eagle on the closing hole, seven other birdies and just one bogey, preceding the eagle. 

Randhawa, who finished fifth at this tournament in 2002, the year he was Asia No.1, shot an eagle, four birdies and just one bogey in his fine round. 

Irishman Padraig Harrington and Englands Ian Poulter lie in second place at 64 each, while South African star Ernie Els and Stewart Cink of the US share fourth place at 65 each. 

Randhawa, who has five Asian Tour titles and one on Japan Tour, started on the 10th tee on the first day. 

He flew high with an eagle at the par five 15th hole and followed that up with a birdie at the next. Randhawa, who has four top-10 finishes on the Asian Tour this season, dropped his only shot of the day at the 17th hole before firing three more birdies on the inward nine. 

His birdies came on the second, fifth and seventh. Randhawa, who has made some adjustments to his swing this season, needed just 26 putt. 

Asian Tour member Simon Dyson, who has won twice this season and is due to play in the Indian Open next month, carded a 67 tied eighth spot. 

Woods gave himself an ideal start in his sixth successive stroke play tournament win when he moved into the top slot at the end of the first round. 

He soared on an eagle three at the 18th to go past his two nearest challengers, Harrington, who birdied five of his first seven holes, and Poulter. 

Woods, who has won four of the six WGC Championships, had just one bogey on the day at the 17th. But he recovered in sensational fashion at the 18th, a superb drive and a three-wood finding the centre of the green before he holed from 20 feet to set a new course record eight-under par 63 at the Hertfordshire venue. 

Woods had lost in the first round of the HSBC World Match Play Championship at Wentworth two weeks ago and was then part of the American team that was routed by Europe in last weeks Ryder Cup at the K Club.

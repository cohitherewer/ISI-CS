 PCB appoints lawyers 

Lahore: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has appointed high-profile lawyers to look into the implications of Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyums revelation that he was soft on a couple of players during the match-fixing probe in 2000. 

PCB fears that following Qayyums remarks, Salim Malik, who was handed a life ban from all forms of cricket, and Ata-ur Rehman could question the credibility of the judges recommendations. 

We have appointed high-profile lawyers to look into the matter, a highly placed PCB official was quoted as saying by a local daily on Tuesday. 

In an interview last week, Qayyum said that he had been a fan of Wasim Akram and that he did not want cricket to be deprived of his participation. He levied a fine of Rs 300,000 (approximately $6000) on Akram and had recommended that he never be allowed to captain Pakistan again. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India must take remedial measures

 - Italy may have won the World Cup, but Materazi is a 

 loser for provoking Zidane

 My Thoughts

Now that the dust has settled on the World Cup extravaganza, its time to reflect on the tournament and why football, which is such a popular game, is languishing in India, a country of a billion people. 

Sadly, after all the wild enthusiasm shown by Indias football-crazy fans, they had more disappointing news. Fifa, footballs governing body, has just further downgraded India from an abysmal 117 to 130th position. 

It always hurts to see India nowhere in the biggest stage of world soccer. But thats bound to be. When I see that the other countries spend more than 100 times of money and energy than India to develop football, my sadness gives way to frustration.

What we urgently need is good coaches at all levels. It is absolutely imperative to have quality coaches not only at the top level but at the grassroots level also. I am sure there is ample talent at the grassroots level, but we should have a mechanism to discover those players. 

It is time we take remedial measures. Of course, we cannot expect the results to come overnight. But at least we should have a system in place which can produce results. 

I feel touched by the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshis statement that he would like me to come back to the Indian team. I will wait for the team to come back from the tournament in Canada before taking a final decision. I will discuss it with the coach and AIFF officials before I make up my mind. 

To go back to the World Cup, sadly, one of the abiding images will be of Zinadine Zidanes head-butting of Marco Materazzi. 

Italy may have won the World Cup, but I think Materazzi is a loser. The Azzurri defender scored two important goals, but besmirched his reputation by the manner in which he provoked Zidane. Though it was a tactical ploy, I feel good players will never provoke opponents in the way Materazzi did. They will let their skills speak for themselves. 

However, I do not hold any brief for Zidane. I am not trying to defend him for the head-butting incident. Zidane should have remembered that he was playing the World Cup final, and his side needed him so much. He should have kept his cool, and not reacted in such a manner. 

I have myself been in similar situations as Zidane. These things happen in soccer. But again, good players in India do not behave like Materrazi. I always try to ignore such things on the field. But yes, occasionally I do get provoked. But I have never gone to the extreme, unlike Zidane. 

I hear that Fifa is conducting an investigation into the incident, and Zidane may be stripped of the Golden Ball award if found guilty. I find this surprising. Zidane was chosen for the award by the worlds leading soccer journalists who had gone to cover the World Cup. He was selected for his extraordinary performance. Also, there are age-old provisions for punishing on-field misbehaviour with yellow and red cards. Now, if he is deprived of the Golden Ball award, then it will amount to double punishment. 

What a great tournament Zidane had! Ten or 15 years from now, when people talk of the 2006 World Cup, they will talk of only Zidane. Like Maradona in 1986. 

I was not at all surprised by Italys success. I had expected them to win. Teams with strong defences have done well in the tourney. A side like Italy, that boasts of a host of outstanding defenders, is always at an advantage. Fabio Cannavaro was undoubtedly the pick of the Italian rearguard.

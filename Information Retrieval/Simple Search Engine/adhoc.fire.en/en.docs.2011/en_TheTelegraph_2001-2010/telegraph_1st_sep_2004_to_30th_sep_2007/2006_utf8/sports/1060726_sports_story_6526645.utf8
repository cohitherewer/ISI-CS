The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Invitation doubtful 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Chances of the 

 Indian Turf Invitation Cup being held here next March are 

 bleak, Gen (retd) Shankar Roychowdhury, chief steward, RCTC, 

 dropped a broad hint at Mondays EGM.

 Elusive Pimpernel won the 1995 edition of the super classic in the city and the punters have been waiting for 11 years for the thoroughbreds show-piece to take place. Invitational races are held by rotation every year among the five turf authorities in the country.

 The chief steward expressed his doubt because of the present financial state of the club. This is thanks to Sujit Bhattacharyya, the steward who allegedly mismanaged the clubs funds and resigned. Punters, however, feel they have been cheated as they have waited for long.

 In 2000, the Invitational races had to be shifted to Ban galore after an RCTC workers union threatened to disrupt the proceedings. Dallas Todywallas Smart Chieftan won the race.

 Despite all this, Invitational races could still happen. For that to happen, RCTC needs some energetic people who can devote time. Its a team work and money wont be a stumbling block. The event is learnt 

 to cost about Rs One crore. What the RCTC could do, it can deduct extra two percent from the totalisators sales by way of additional commission. Further it could also deduct Re 1 from each winning ticket at the tote.

 A chunk of money would be saved with the resignation of Brig. Sudhir Johar, general manager projects and properties. With him his newly appointed support staff ought to go. It may save the club a princely sum of about Rs 2 lakh each month. Five percent deduction from the advertised stake money towards this cause would not pinch pockets of horseowners. The Invitation Cup is still eight months away and these savings could achieve the targeted expenses.

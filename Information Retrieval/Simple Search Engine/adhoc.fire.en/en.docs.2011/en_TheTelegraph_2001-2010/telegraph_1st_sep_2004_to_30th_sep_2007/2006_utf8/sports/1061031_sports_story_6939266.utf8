 Zaheer counts on past experiences in SA 

- My hope is to play an important role for the country :Jaffer 

Cuttack: Paceman Zaheer Khan and opener Wasim Jaffer on Monday expressed happiness on their selection in the South Africa-bound Indian squad for the one-day series, saying they would work to justify their inclusion. 

I am obviously happy to be back. At the same time, Im aware of my responsibility, Zaheer said. 

Zaheer, who scalped four wickets in the Duleep Trophy match against Sri Lanka A here, said his experience in South African conditions should be a great help. 

I have been there (South Africa) two or three times. I have some idea as to what to expect (there). My County experience will also help, he added. 

Jaffer, yet to play in an one-day International, celebrated his place in the squad by hitting a polished 129 against Sri Lanka A, though West Zone lost the match by 195 runs. 

I will be going to South Africa for the first time. I will see how the wickets behave there and play accordingly, he said. 

There is always pressure in international cricket. But my hope is to play an important role for the country, the Mumbai opener said.

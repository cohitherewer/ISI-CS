 Jockey arrested on rape charge

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Mallesh Narredu, a top-flight jockey, was arrested in Mumbai on Sunday on a rape charge. Mallesh will be produced in the Metropolitan court on Monday, according to a Mumbai source. 

Sources close to Mallesh said the lady who filed the complaint was a close friend of his. 

The jockey has suffered a series of setbacks in 2006. Last week he was slapped a four-month suspension by the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC). He was reported by the stipes to the BTC stewards for his tender riding on the strongly fancied horse Aashirwaad, in the Jayachamaraja Wadiyar Trophy on August 11, the concluding day of the Bangalore (summer) season. His suspension was to have begun from Monday. 

In May, Mallesh had lost a close battle for the jockeys championship to C. Rajendra during the Mumbai racing season.

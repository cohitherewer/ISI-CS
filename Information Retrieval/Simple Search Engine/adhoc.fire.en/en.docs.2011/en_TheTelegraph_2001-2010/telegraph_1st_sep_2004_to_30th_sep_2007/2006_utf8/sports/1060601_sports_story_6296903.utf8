Antigua: The touring Indians were 126 for three at lunch on the second and final day of their two-day match against Antigua XI here on Wednesday. 

V.V.S. Laxman gave a good account of himself in his first game of the tour and was unbeaten on 42 in over two hours during which he faced 73 balls and hit five fours. 

India resumed at an overnight score of 33 for one and lost two wickets in the opening session, one by way of a run out. 

Opener Wasim Jaffer had progressed serenely to 52 from 87 balls with eight fours when he responded to Laxmans call but could not beat the throw from square leg. 

Rahul Dravid was the next batsman out when he cut and edged to the wicketkeeper for five runs. At lunch, Laxman was batting on 42 and Kaif was on 17. 

Earlier on Tuesday, Indian bowlers put up an unimpressive display as Antigua XI captain Sylvester Joseph cracked a splendid century. 

Joseph batted for four and a quarter hours, smashing an unbeaten 128 from 179 balls with 15 fours and two sixes to power Antigua to 300. 

Electing to bat, Antigua XI had little trouble in handling a lacklustre Indian attack. 

In a game in which batters could bat and bowlers could bowl, Indias new ball bowlers Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth hardly posed any problem to the locals.

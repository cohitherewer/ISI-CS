 Randhawa slips to tied 6th with Jeev

 - Gangjee manages cut, Chowrasia misses out 

 Hong Kong Open 

 Jyoti Randhawa in Hong Kong on Friday 

Hong Kong: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh continued their brilliant run as they ensured a strong Indian presence on the leaderboard at tied sixth place, three shots off the lead, at the midway stage of the $2 million UBS Hong Kong Open golf tournament. 

At the Fanling golf course in Hong Kong Country Club, overnight joint leader Randhawa shot an under-69 and Jeev a three-under 67. They were both seven-under 133 for 36 holes, and three shots behind Spaniard Jose Manuel Lara (66), who was at 10-under for two days. 

In the second place was little-known Frenchman Gregory Bourdy (66) and Australian Andrew Buckle (65) was tied third with Filipino rookie Juvic Pangunsan (65) and Chinese veteran Zhang Lian-Wei, who scorched the course with the days best of seven-under 63. They were all tied eight-under 132 for two days. 

Two other Indians, Rahil Gangjee (70) and Gaurav Ghei (70), also made the cut and were tied 53rd at even par on the cut line. Indo-Swede Daniel Chopra climbed from tied 102nd to tied 44th with a four-under 67 and a total of one-under 138. 

However, Harmeet Kahlon (70) and S. S. P. Chowrasia (72) missed the cut. 

Battling the winds, Randhawa started the day in shared lead with Lara. But he had a very frustrating day with his birdies putts refusing to fall. He did well to tame the wind and manage pars for most part of the day and ended with a one-under 69. 

Randhawa saw all the action in first four holes after starting from the tenth. He opened with a bogey and had birdies on 12th and 13th. Thereafter he parred the remaining 14 holes in a row for his 69. 

Jeev opened and closed with a bogey but in between played well to bring home a three-under 67 that saw him in tied sixth at seven-under 143. 

Jeev, whose wrist has been bothering him, started with a bogey on first and then fired three excellent birdies on third, fourth and seventh to turn in two-under 34. On the back nine, he again started with a bogey, but birdies on 11th, 13th and 17th saw him go to eight-under and in third place before a bogey on 18th dropped him to sixth. 

Chowrasia was unable to make up lost ground and missed his first cut of the season. He finished with a round of two-over 72 with two birdies and four bogeys and ended with a six-over total as the cut came at even par.

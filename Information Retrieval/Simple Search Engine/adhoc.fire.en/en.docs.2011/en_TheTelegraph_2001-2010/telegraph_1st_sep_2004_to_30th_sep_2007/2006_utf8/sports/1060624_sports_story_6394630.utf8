 Hari returns to winning ways 

Crimea: Grandmaster P. Harikrishna struck back with a thumping victory over twice world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan in the sixth round of Aerosvit International Grandmasters Chess Tournament now underway here. 

After suffering two losses in a row, Harikrishna was languishing at the bottom of the table and this victory before the only rest day of the tournament proved out to be a confidence-booster for the Indian, as he is now placed joint eighth in the 12-player meet. 

Sergei Rublevskys brilliant run continued in the tournament with another superlative effort against overnight leader Viktor Bologan of Moldova. 

After a first round loss followed by a draw in the second, this was Rublevskys fourth victory on the trot and the Russian leads with 4.5 points. (PTI)

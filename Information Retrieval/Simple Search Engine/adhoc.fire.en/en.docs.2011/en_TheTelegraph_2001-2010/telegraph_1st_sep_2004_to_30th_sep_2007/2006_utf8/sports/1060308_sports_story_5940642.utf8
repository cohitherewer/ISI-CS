London: Arsenal need to banish the inconsistency that has dogged their season if they are to earn at least a draw with Real Madrid and reach the Champions League quarter finals on Wednesday. 

A famous triumph over the most successful club in European football beckons Arsene Wengers side after their hugely impressive 1-0 victory at the Bernabeu two weeks ago. 

Talismanic captain Thierry Henry scored the away goal that could yet see Arsenal through to only their third appearance in the last eight and there was more for their fans to cheer on Saturday. 

Fulham are a world away from the Galacticos of Real Madrid but the stylish way Arsenal tore them to shreds in a 4-0 drubbing, courtesy two well-taken goals by Henry, was a sign of real confidence. 

However, Arsenals season has been very much a stop-start affair and their Premier League finish is destined to fall well short of the clubs high standards after 10 defeats has left them fifth in the table. 

Five points adrift of neighbours Tottenham Hotspur in a race to finish fourth raises the very real prospect of Uefa Cup for their first season at the new Emirates Stadium. 

Defensive lapses and a failure to impose themselves in midfield, due in large part to the pre-season departure of Patrick Vieira to Juventus, have robbed Wengers side of all chance of domestic silverware. 

The Champions League can yet salvage Arsenals season, though the same is largely true for Real, 10 points behind Primera Liga leaders Barcelona and out of the Kings Cup. 

Real put a week of turmoil behind them following Florentino Perezs shock resignation with a gutsy and determined 2-1 win over Atletico Madrid on Saturday. 

New president Fernando Martins decision to crack the whip and make it clear that he required more commitment from the players appeared to pay dividends with a morale-boosting win.

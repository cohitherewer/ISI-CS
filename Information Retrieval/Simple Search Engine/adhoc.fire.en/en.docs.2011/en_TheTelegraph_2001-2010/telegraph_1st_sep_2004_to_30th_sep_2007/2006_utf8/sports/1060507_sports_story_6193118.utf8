 Alonso snatches pole position

 - Spaniard edges out Schumacher; Fisichella fails to qualify 

 in top-10 

 European GP

 Nuerburgring: Renaults 

 world champion Fernando Alonso edged out Michael Schumacher 

 to take his first pole position of the season at the European 

 Grand Prix on Saturday.

 The 24-year-old Spaniard will 

 start alongside Ferraris seven times champion, his 

 closest rival in the Formula One championship and the man 

 he dethroned last year.

 Felipe Massa was third fastest 

 for Ferrari and, as at Imola two weeks ago, forms an all-Brazilian 

 second row with Hondas Rubens Barrichello.

 Finlands Kimi Raikkonen 

 was fifth fastest for Mercedes-powered McLaren and Hondas 

 Jenson Button sixth, ending a run of seven starts from the 

 front two rows.

 Alonsos Italian teammate 

 Giancarlo Fisichella failed to qualify in the top-10 for 

 the second race in a row and stalked angrily down the pitlane 

 to remonstrate with BMW Saubers Jacques Villeneuve, 

 who starts eighth.

 Fisichella, who had shaken his 

 fist at the Canadian several times as he followed the BMW 

 driver on the track in the penultimate session, clearly 

 blamed the 1997 champion for baulking him.

 Standing in the BMW garage in 

 front of Villeneuves car, with the Canadian still 

 sitting in it, he pointed his finger and made his feelings 

 clear.

 Ralf Schumacher will start his 

 home race in 10th place because Australian Mark Webber, 

 who qualified in that position and just ahead of him, collected 

 a 10-place penalty for an unscheduled engine change.

 Webbers Williams teammate 

 Nico Rosberg was 12th fastest but also took a 10-place hit 

 and will start at the back for his first home race after 

 a similar precautionary engine change.

 BMWs Nick Heidfeld, who 

 took the first pole position of his career at the Nuerburgring 

 last year, qualified a distant 15th but will gain two places 

 because of the Williams penalties.

 French driver Franck Montagny 

 will make his Grand Prix debut on the back row for newcomers 

 Super Aguri after replacing dropped Japanese Yuji Ide.

 There was confusion after the 

 first qualifying session, with the start of the second delayed 

 by 10 minutes while a timing problem was sorted out.

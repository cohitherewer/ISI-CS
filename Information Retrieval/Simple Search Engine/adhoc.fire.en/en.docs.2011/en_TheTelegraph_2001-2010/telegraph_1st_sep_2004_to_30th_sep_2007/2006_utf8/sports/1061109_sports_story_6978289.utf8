 Jeev out to prove his mettle again

 - SHANGHAI MEET 

 - Playing with Tiger a reward for my performance this 

 year 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Shanghai: Pitted against world No. 1 golfer Tiger Woods, ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh intends to prove his mettle at the $ 5m HSBC Champions tournament starting tomorrow. 

Jeev, the current Asian Tour No. 1, has been handed a dream pairing with Woods in the opening two rounds at Sheshan International Golf club and is relishing the prospect of going head-to-head with the planets best player. 

Im obviously excited to be paired with Tiger. Its for the first time that Im going to play with him and hopefully I can learn something and see how he manages the golf course, said Jeev, who will be joined by Englands Paul Casey as the third member of the marquee pairing. 

Its going to be an exciting day and Im looking forward to it. I think playing with Tiger is a reward for the performances that Ive had this year. Its going to be an experience for me. I have a lot of respect for him because I think hes done a lot for the game of golf worldwide. 

Jeevs Shanghai showdown with the American superstar, a 12-time Major winner, will be closely watched as the Indian star has been Asias most in-form player this season. 

 Tiger Woods 

 He secured a monumental triumph 

 at the European Tours season-ending Volvo Masters 

 in Spain a fortnight ago. Earlier, he had ended his seven-year 

 winless drought at the co-sanctioned Volvo China Open in 

 Beijing. 

That win in April sparked a remarkable turnaround in Jeevs career and he rode on his new-found confidence to post 13 other top-10s on the Asian, Japan and European Tours this year. 

With his world ranking shooting up to a career high 73 after starting the year at 376th, Jeev is now hoping to break into the top-50 to earn a US Masters invite to go with a British Open appearance already in hand as well. 

I was pretty excited with the win. Obviously, playing the flagship tournament in Europe and winning it, it gives a player a lot of confidence and I think a lot of satisfaction too. If it (moving up the rankings) happens, Ill be very happy. If it doesnt, Ive got another week, said Jeev.

 Doshis son bags five

London: Veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble had to be content with one wicket for Surrey against Derbyshire in their pro40 Division II match at Chesterfield on Monday. 

Kumble conceded 35 runs in eight overs but Nayan Doshi, son of former Indian cricketer Dilip Doshi, returned with figures of five for 30 in 7.4 overs to restrict Derbyshire to 207 in 39.4 overs at Queens Park. 

Surrey romped home losing just two wickets in 27.2 overs. Openers James Benning and Alistair Brown put them on the way with 66 and 106, respectively, and added 155 for the first wicket. (PTI)

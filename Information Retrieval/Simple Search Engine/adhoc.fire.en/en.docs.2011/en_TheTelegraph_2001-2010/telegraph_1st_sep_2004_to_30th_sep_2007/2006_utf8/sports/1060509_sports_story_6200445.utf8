 Need for the BCCI to recognise 

 - Captain Rahul Dravid speaks up for the Indian Cricket Players Association

New Delhi: Team India captain Rahul Dravid said on Monday that he would like the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to give recognition to the Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) as it would help in thrashing out several issues between the BCCI and the players. 

Dravid, who was speaking during a promotional event, said since an international organisation of cricketers union already exists, its Indian counterpart needs to be recognised by the BCCI, so both can work together for the welfare of the players and the game. 

At the international level, cricketers do have an organisation called Federation of International Cricketers Association (Fica) and we have ICPA here, though it is not recognised, Dravid said. We have taken up the issue with the BCCI and trying to have our Indian body recognised. So far our negotiations have remained very healthy and I am sure we have been able to put across our points in the right manner. 

When asked what should be the opening combination during the West Indies tour, a visibly irritated Dravid said: Does it really matter? Thats not important. It all depends on who is available at what point of time. In the last eight months, we have been winning, no matter who batted in which position. 

The Indian captain said he was aware of the challenge ahead of the team during the tour of the West Indies. It is certainly going to be big challenge. I know we havent won a (Test) series outside the country for close to 20 years (with the exception of the 2-0 win in Zimbabwe last September). I know we have to do well and correct the imbalance outside the country. 

Asked about his views on the Brian Lara-led West Indies, Dravid said it would be wrong to take the hosts lightly. They are a pretty good side with young players, especially young pace bowlers. In many ways, the West Indies side is similar to India. 

Commenting on Indias strength as a Test side, Dravid said: Yes, we did lose a couple of Test matches, but thats not the end of the world. We have so many youngsters like (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni or (Suresh) Raina. They will get to learn slowly as they travel more and play more on different conditions.

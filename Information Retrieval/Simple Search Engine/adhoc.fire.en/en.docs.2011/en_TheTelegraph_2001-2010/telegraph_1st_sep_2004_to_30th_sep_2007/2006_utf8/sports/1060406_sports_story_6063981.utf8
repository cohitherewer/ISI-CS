Colombo: Younis Khan and Imran Farhat each scored half-centuries to lead Pakistan to a series-clinching eight-wicket victory on Day III of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Kandy on Wednesday. 

Vice-captain Younis scored a commanding unbeaten 73 from just 98 balls, hitting 12 boundaries, while opener Farhat hit 11 fours in his 65. 

The pair combined to add 114 runs for the second wicket that carried the game away from the hosts, who had earlier been bowled out for just 73 in 24.5 overs, their second lowest total against Pakistan. 

Sri Lankas second innings collapse had still left Pakistan chasing a potentially tricky 183 target after 28 wickets had tumbled on the first two days. 

But the difficult pitch eased on a hot day and Sri Lanka bowled poorly, providing the tourists with too many scoring opportunities. 

By the time Farhat edged a Nuwan Kulasekera delivery to first slip, Pakistan were just 31 runs short of victory, leaving Khan and Mohammed Yousuf (14 not out) to reach the target midway through the afternoon session. 

Sri Lanka abandoned faint hopes that Sanath Jayasuriya would be able to bat with the aid of painkillers after dislocating his right thumb on Tuesday. The 36-year-old, playing in his farewell Test, was too badly injured to consider batting in the second innings. Resuming on 73 for eight, Sri Lanka were then bowled out with the first ball of the day. 

Abdul Razzaq finished with four for 20 from 6.5 overs and Man of the Match Mohammed Asif finished with match figures of 11 for 71.

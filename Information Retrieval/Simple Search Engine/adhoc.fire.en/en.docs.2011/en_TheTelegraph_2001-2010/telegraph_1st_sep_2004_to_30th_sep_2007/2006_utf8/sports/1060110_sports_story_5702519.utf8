Calcutta: East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting kick off the 10th ONGC National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

It has been a bad run this season for the Calcutta clubs and they would want to compensate for all that in the countrys premier tournament. Both the clubs are pinning their hopes on their new coaches, but at the end it is their players who will have to deliver. 

For Mohammedan Sporting, it is going to be a new challenge. It will be their reappearance in the big league after failing to find a berth last season. For East Bengal, it will be a different story as persistent failures have put their reputation at stake. 

East Bengal have spared no efforts to put a good outfit in place, but discipline problems have plagued them. Their Belgian coach Phillipe de Ridder accepted the fact that it wont be easy for the boys. 

We want to start with a win but the boys need to perform consistently if they want to taste success, said Ridder. The coach, though, has made it clear that there will be no compromise on discipline. 

The message has already been delivered to the players in no uncertain terms. 

The change was visible during the clubs practice on Monday. Seniors like Bhaichung Bhutia, Debjit Ghosh, Alvito D Cunha were taking responsibility and there was a spring in their steps. They seemed to be aware of the responsibilities at hand. 

The players also look fit and the credit goes to the coach who has put the players through rigorous training. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach Mohammed Habib is confident. This is our best chance and if we miss it then we can never make amends, said Habib. 

The club lacks big names and that is what adds to their advantage, felt Habib. 

 The coach also said that he would like to play attacking football in 3-5-2 formation where both the wingers would be utilised in the striking position as well. Much will depend on captain Okonji Patrick, who will be the main striker. 

Meanwhile, AIFF vice-president Subrata Dutta announced at a press conference on Monday that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will be the chief guest at the opening ceremony at 3 pm. 

The All India Football Federation (AIFF), meanwhile, has completed arrangements for conducting dope tests during the tournament. 

Random dope tests will be conducted. Though for obvious reasons we cannot tell you the matches when we will conduct the tests and the number of players who would be tested, Dutta said . 

The AIFF vice president said the samples would be sent to a laboratory in Malaysia with the AIFF medical cell selecting the matches and the players and supervising the collection process. 

The matches would be telecast live on Zee Sports from 3 pm.

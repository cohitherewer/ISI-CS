 Nadal pulls out with injury

World number two Rafael Nadal has pulled out of the Australian Open because of injury. 

Nadal, 19, has been struggling with a foot problem he sustained in the Madrid Masters in October and was forced to miss last weeks Chennai Open and this weeks Sydney International. 

The current French Open champion has said his injury is on the mend, and took part in a full clay-court training session against Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten in Barcelona on Sunday. 

But he is still not a 100 per cent fit and has decided to sit out the years opening Grand Slam, which starts in Melbourne on Monday, in order to speed up his recovery process. 

I am slower than normal, mainly when I have to run to my right, and it is clear that if I travelled to Australia I would not be at my best, tennis-wise nor physically, Nadal said in Marca. 

Nadal has appeared in two Australian Open Championships, with his best singles appearance coming in 2004 when he reached the fourth round.

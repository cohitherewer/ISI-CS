Villarreal: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists he will not sacrifice his attacking principles when the Gunners take aim at a first-ever appearance in the Champions League final on Tuesday. 

The English giants defend a 1-0 lead from the first-leg of their semi-final clash against Villarreal but the Frenchman is adamant that his side will not sit back on their slight advantage. We are a team who can always score goals, said Wenger. For us it is most important to go there and just form a good defensive base every time we go forward and try to win the game. 

The Spaniards were criticised for their cautious tactics at Highbury last week but, inspired by the dangerous Juan Roman Riquelme, are widely expected to throw off that negative approach. 

The best way to deal with that is to score, that would be ideal and that is what we will try to achieve, said Wenger. 

We will try to play at a high pace and I think they will try to up the pace as well so you should see a much more exciting game in the second-leg. 

Wenger will miss Swiss central-defender Philippe Senderos who picked up a knee injury in the 1-1 draw with Spurs in the Premiership on Saturday but he can welcome back Spanish striker Juan Antonio Reyes who was suspended for the first-leg. 

Full-back Ashley Cole is still not fully match fit but veteran centre-half Sol Campbell could be in the squad after recovering from a broken nose in what has been a campaign, hampered by injury for the 31-year-old. 

Wenger said: Whether I start him or not, it will be a security to know he (Campbell) is with us. 

Villarreal will have to do what none of Arsenals European opponents have managed in the last nine games and breach their rock-solid defence if are to deny the English side a place in a first ever Champions League final. 

Arsenal equalled the record established by Ajax in the 1980s by keeping another European clean sheet as they ran out 1-0 winners in the first-leg. It is a tall order for the Spanish side who have struggled for goals this season and whose biggest win in their debut campaign in the Champions League was 2-1 against Everton in the third qualifying round. 

Skipper Thierry Henry shares his coachs optimism about the mission awaiting them at the El Madrigal Stadium. With our attacking ability and especially ? what for me is the most impressive thing is the fact that we are not conceding goals, I can say we are cautiously optimistic, said the 28-year-old. 

We saw a Villarreal team at Highbury that would not go forward and tried only to win free-kicks so they could cause us problems from dead-ball situations. 

The Gunners skipper claimed he had total confidence in his young side, saying: I know the quality of these boys. 

All the youngsters have grown in confidence. A Youngster never calculates, he just plays to the limit without thinking too much about where he is. 

Villarreal are currently marooned in mid-table in Spain and paid a heavy price for resting their leading lights on Saturday when they were beaten 0-2 by Real Sociedad. 

Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini left out Riquelme, Marcos Senna, goalkeeper Mariano Barbosa, Juan Pablo Sorin and Rodolfo Arruabarrena. We are so close to the Champions League final that it is inevitable that we give more importance to the match against arsenal, said Pellegrini in mitigation. 

Pellegrini, however, believes his side can throw the form book out of the window and do what the illustrious forward lines of Real Madrid and Juventus failed to achieve in recent weeks. 

Villarreal will be without suspended Italian midfielder Alessio Tacchinardi as well as injured centre-back pairing Gonzalo Rodriguez and Juan Manuel Pena. 

But they will have first-choice keeper Sebastian Viera back after the Uruguayan was suspended for the first-leg.

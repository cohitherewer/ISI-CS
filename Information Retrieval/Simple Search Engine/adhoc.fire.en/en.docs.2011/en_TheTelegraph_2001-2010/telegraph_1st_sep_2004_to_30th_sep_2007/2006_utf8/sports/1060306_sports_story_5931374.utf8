 Greg shouldve been careful: Bedi

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi feels that players and team officials contracted with the BCCI should be careful while making statements to the media. Commenting on Greg Chappells controversial interview to a UK newspaper, Bedi said: This is his personal opinion and now the issue is between him and the board. The coach is directly answerable to the BCCI. 

The former captain, who was in the city on Sunday, to attend a seminar organised by West Bengal Arthroplasty Society, also gave some credit to Chappell. 

He has experimented with the batting order, which has clicked. But again it is too early to comment? Give him some time. 

He is not thinking of the present. He is thinking about the 2007 World Cup, which is probably right. 

When asked whether, Sourav can make a comeback, the spin legend said that it is Sourav who can better answer that. 

Bedi said: We should not make bigger issues out of smaller things. The larger canvas is the Indian cricket. We should not think about Sourav, Anil (Kumble) or Rahul (Dravid). 

All good things should come to an end, remarked Bedi, who is also known to be one of the biggest critics of Sourav.

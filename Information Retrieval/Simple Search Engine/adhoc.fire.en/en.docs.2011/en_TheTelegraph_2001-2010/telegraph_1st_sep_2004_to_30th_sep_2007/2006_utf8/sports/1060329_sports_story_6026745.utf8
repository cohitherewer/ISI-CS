 GCA to fete Sardesai

Panaji: Former Test player Dilip Sardesai, the only cricketer of Goan origin to play for India, will be felicitated during the third ODI against England at the Nehru Stadium in Margao on April 3. 

Sardesai will be felicitated with a purse of Rs 5 lakh from the GCA. 

Goas health minister and a BCCI vice-president Dayanand Narvekar said on Tuesday that that Sardesai, who is on dialysis, was in Goa and arrangements had been made for him to stay at Goa Medical College. 

We have been trying to felicitate Sardesai for some time but somehow were not able to do so. Now that the ODI will be held in Goa, we have got the opportunity, Narvekar said on Tuesday. (PTI)

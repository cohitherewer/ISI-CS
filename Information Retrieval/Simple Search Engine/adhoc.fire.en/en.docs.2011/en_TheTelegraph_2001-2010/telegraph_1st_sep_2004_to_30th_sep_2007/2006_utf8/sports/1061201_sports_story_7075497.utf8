 Bengal ready for Mumbai, sans Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly will not play the Ranji Trophy tie against Mumbai starting at the Eden on Friday. The former India captain will leave for South Africa on Sunday night, and so, there is no chance that he will make himself available. 

Bengal, however, have braced themselves for life without Sourav. He wasnt there last year, too. Weve hardly got the chance to play with him in the last few years. Weve got used to it Were ready to play without him, captain Deep Dasgupta said. 

 Bengal, under Sourav, had won their opening match in Mohali and will hope to carry on the momentum. The events, however, hasnt been encouraging in the lead-up to the match. Middle-order bat Subhomoy Das will be unavailable because of a bereavement in the family. Safi Ahmed has been included as has been standby Kamal Hasan Mondal, but it is unlikely that any of them will play. 

This will be Mumbais first match of the season and Bengal are trying to gain an advantage from it. Mumbai have been consistent over the years, though, I feel we are potentially the best side in the country now, Deep said. 

Amol Muzumdar felt they had prepared well after three weeks of training. 

The match, which will go on as scheduled despite the bandh, is likely to be played on an adjoining strip to the one that was decided in the morning. 

The original wicket had more grass on it. This is because of a change in Bengals plans because of Souravs unavailability.

 Father wants Cisse to seek native healing

Dakar: France striker Djibril Cisse should return to Africa to seek traditional healing after a broken leg stopped him from playing in the World Cup, his father said on Monday. 

I think he should turn to his roots to get his form back and to be at peace with himself, Mangue Cisse told Senegals official news agency. 

We are Africans and there are things known only to us, the father of the Liverpool striker added. 

Traditional healing is deeply rooted in West African culture and many people believe that wearing a talisman called a gris-gris protects them from bullets, knives, plane crashes, and even from getting pregnant. 

Cisse, who is from Ivory Coast, missed Euro 2004 due to injuries and had to skip this years World Cup after breaking his leg during a warm-up against China a day before his team left for Germany.

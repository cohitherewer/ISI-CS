 Hingis donates $20,000 to Mother House

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Away from the hum and din of Greensets, Martina Hingis on Tuesday paid a surreptitious visit to Mother House and donated $20,000 to the Missionaries of Char-ity. 

The Swiss Miss, fresh from her 6-1, 6-2 demolition of Melinda Czink, spent a little over half an hour along with mother Melanie Molitor and Mahesh Bhupathis wife Shweta. They were accompanied by Melinda Czink, Aravane Rezai, Tamarine Tanasugarn, Sandy Gumulya and Liezel Huber. 

Dressed in a pink top and blue denims, the former World No.1 then went on to Sishu Bhavan, home for destitute children. 

Meanwhile, donning a formal shirt but looking visibly relaxed, former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly dropped by in the evening with Bengal teammates to watch Sania Mirza in action. 

Occasionally applauding as Sania made mincemeat of Rushmi Chakravarthy in her first round match, Sourav told his teammate, Joydeep Mukherjee, that he may do an encore if Sania clashes with Martina, according to the former Bengal player. 

Seated on the front row, the Prince of Calcutta was seen sipping his evening cuppa during the match.

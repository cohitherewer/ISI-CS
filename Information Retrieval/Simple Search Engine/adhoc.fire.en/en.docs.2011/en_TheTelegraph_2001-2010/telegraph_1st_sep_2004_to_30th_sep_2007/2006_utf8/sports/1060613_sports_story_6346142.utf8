 Japanese suffer 

 Irans fate

 Talking Tactics

 Alex and Masashi Oguro of Japan after 

 their defeat 

It 

 almost looked like a photo copy of the match 24 hours earlier: 

 Another Asian team folding up like a pack of cards in the 

 final moments of a big game. If it was Iran who surrendered 

 the initiative to Mexico on Sunday, it was Japans 

 turn to let in three goals in the final seven minutes and 

 lose to Australia on Monday.

 The similarities didnt end 

 there. It was again a lapse in concentration, which led 

 to a fatal mistake. Goalkeeper Kawaguchi had, in the first 

 80 minutes, effected four superb saves. Then, with his team 

 leading 1-0, he decided to leave charge to intercept a long 

 throw-in, but came up short and saw from a distance Tim 

 Cahill pushing in the equaliser off a melee.

 One of his defenders was right 

 behind Viduka and Kawaguchi should have left it to his teammate 

 rather than himself coming out and leave the goal open.

 The keepers blunder 

 not only gifted Australia their first goal in the World 

 Cup finals, it also gave the Socceroos the confidence to 

 throw caution to the wind and pump in two more. Unlike the 

 equaliser, however, their next two goals were superb efforts. 

 Cahill, and then Aloisi, produced excellent finishes as 

 the Japanese defenders ran out of ideas and breath as well.

 Seven in the Aussie first XI ply 

 their trade in England, two in Italy and one in The Netherlands. 

 Add the Hiddink factor, and the European influence was pronounced 

 in the team from Down Under. They ran hard, played long 

 balls, but were often caught up by the close-controlled 

 Japanese game.

 Viduka, the prolific Middlesbrough 

 striker, showed thrust and some good touches as well. He 

 himself should have taken at least one of the two back-to-back 

 chances that came Australias way in the seventh minute.

 Then he produced a magical back-heel, 

 which should have been converted by Bresciano.

 Japan soaked in the early pressure 

 and seemed to be winning the battle of the midfield, thanks 

 to their Bolton Wanderers star Hidetoshi Nakata who seldom 

 mispassed. Zicos men also cleverly switched to a short-passing 

 game after about 20 minutes to keep the Aussies under leash. 

 The Japanese, adept at fast counter-attacks, 

 got their nose in front after 26 minutes. Of course, it 

 was a goal they wouldnt have got had the referee not 

 missed an infringement against the Aussie custodian. As 

 Nakamura floated one to the goalmouth, Mark Schwarzer left 

 station but his movement was obstructed by Takahara, who 

 was going for the man and not the ball. The ball went in 

 directly into the goal but it should have been disallowed 

 and a free-kick awarded to Australia instead.

 The referee erred again in not 

 giving Japan a penalty just after Australia had gone two 

 up. 

 But that is all a part and parcel 

 of the game. The fact of the matter is, Japan gave themselves 

 a very bright chance of winning their opener and progressing 

 to the knockout round, only to be blown away by the late 

 deluge.

 Australia deserved to win simply 

 because they created more openings. But Hiddinks side 

 got their chances in two phases ?? in the opening 20 minutes 

 and the final 15 minutes or so. They will have to pack in 

 some more punch in the middle period if they are to beat 

 stronger teams.

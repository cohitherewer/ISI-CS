 England lack depth to keep Ashes

 - Gillespie, Martyn, Kasprowicz rewarded with fresh CA contracts 

 Steve Waugh 

Sydney: Injuries and a lack of depth may result in England surrendering the Ashes which they won after a gap of 17 years last summer, former Australian captain Steve Waugh has predicted. 

Australia have the edge for the Ashes. Theyre playing in Australia, theyre fairly confident and have been preparing for quite a while now, Waugh said about the much-anticipated series Down Under later this year. 

And, if youre the best in the world and you lose, you want to win and get back to where you were. 

He said that England were plagued by injuries and lacked depth in their ranks unlike the Australians. Englands strength in depth isnt as deep as Australias and you need good back-up. (England captain Michael) Vaughan still has serious doubts about his knee and getting it right is crucial, the Aussie legend was quoted as saying in a London daily. 

Waugh was in the British capital for promoting his autobiography Out of My Comfort Zone. 

He said England could not carry forward the momentum of their Ashes triumph in the subcontinent where they lost the Test series 0-2 to Pakistan and drew 1-1 with India. 

Pakistan was a let-down for England and the problem was they werent over what happened against Australia last year. The players profiles increased and, with the euphoria that went with success, they found it difficult. 

Waugh also cast doubts over the feasibility of appointing Andrew Flintoff as a permanent skipper. 

Flintoff did very well as stand-in captain, but I dont know whether its a long-term option as it would be too great a workload for him. 

Meanwhile, three players dumped by Cricket Australia before the start of the last Ashes series against England could figure in the home sides line-up when the next series begins in November. 

Jason Gillespie, Michael Kasprowicz and Damien Martyn were among 25 contracted players announced on Monday for the 2006-2007 season. Cricket Australia cut Cameron White, Mick Lewis and James Hopes from the list. 

Players expected to lead Australia in the 2006 series ? captain Ricky Ponting, vice-captain Adam Gilchrist, openers Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer and bowlers Shane Warne, Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath ? were all on the list. 

Queensland fast bowler Mitchell Johnson and Phil Jaques and Stuart Clark of New South Wales were handed full contracts for the first time.

 Pak duo should pay heavily, says Steve

Melbourne: Former Australian captain Steve Waugh has said the ICC should make Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif pay heavily if proven guilty of using banned drugs. 

Pakistans dope-tainted pace duo was pulled out of the Champions Trophy after testing positive for banned steroid nandrolone. 

Its not really associated with cricket, but you cant be too naive to suggest that it wouldnt happen. Obviously its here. Players know the rules and very strict guidelines, and youve got to work within those, Waugh said. 

If you step outside of it, youve got to pay the consequences. 

So I think if theyve done the wrong thing, theyll certainly pay pretty heavily for it, he was quoted as saying by an Australian website. 

Test opener Matthew Hayden echoed Waughs views.. 

We are very proud of having a clean sport that does its best to maintain the standards so that we pass onto the youngsters a clear message that drugs in our game arent acceptable, he said.

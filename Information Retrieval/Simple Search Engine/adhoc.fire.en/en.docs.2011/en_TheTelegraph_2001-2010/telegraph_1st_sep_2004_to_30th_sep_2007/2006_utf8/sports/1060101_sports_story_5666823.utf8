The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ferguson likely to face FA rap

Oliver Kay

Sixty-four on Saturday, Sir Alex Ferguson insists that he is not expecting a P45 in the post any time soon, but the belligerent spirit, sharp mind and acid tongue that have served him so well in his managerial career are expected to earn him at the very least a rap on the knuckles from the FA Premier League. 

Premier League officials indicated on Friday that they will look closely at comments Ferguson has made over the past few days, in which he has alleged on two separate occasions that Bolton Wanderers forced the postponement of their match against Middlesbrough on Wednesday to give themselves more time to prepare for their trip to Old Trafford on Saturday. Sam Allardyce, the Bolton manager, has already rubbished suggestions of foul play and, after Ferguson repeated his claim on Friday, the Premier League suggested he may have contravened their code of conduct for managers. 

Ferguson must have been aware of the provocative nature of his original comment, with Allardyce adamant that Boltons undersoil heating had failed, but the United manager was unrepentant on Friday. 

The Premier League should be more vigilant of this kind of thing, he said. They should make sure clubs have undersoil heating that works and is maintained. We asked for our game with West Brom (on Boxing Day) to be played on Christmas Eve, but the League said no, saying it would give us an advantage over the rest of the Premiership. But then Bolton say their undersoil heating doesnt work, and now they have an advantage ? five days of rest. Im not convinced at all. Surely there must be some electrician in Bolton. 

Perhaps it was the dawn of his 65th year, but Ferguson seemed determined on Friday to challenge the perception of a man winding down as he approaches pensionable age. 

He rose at 5 am, arriving at Uniteds training ground an hour later, and, while for once he skipped his habitual work-out at the gym, he released plenty of pent-up energy during a press conference in which he challenged those asking whether his rebuilding operation was running behind schedule before turning his fire on Bolton and then Patrick Vieira, the former Arsenal captain, now at Juventus. 

Vieira drew Fergusons ire as the Scot, looking forward to renewing hostilities with Arsenal at Highbury on Tuesday, was informed of comments made by their former captain in his recent autobiography, in which he calls Ruud van Nistelrooy a coward and a cheat.

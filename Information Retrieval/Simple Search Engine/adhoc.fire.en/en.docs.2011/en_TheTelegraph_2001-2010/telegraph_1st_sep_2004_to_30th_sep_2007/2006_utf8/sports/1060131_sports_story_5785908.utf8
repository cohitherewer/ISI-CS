 S.S. Das dropped 

Bhubaneswar: With the senior team failing to get to the Elite Group once again, the Orissa Cricket Association on Monday dropped two of the senior players including opener Shiv Sundar Das from the squad. 

Das, a former Test opener, senior batsman Rashmi Ranjan Parida and stumper Priyabrata Pradhan were omitted from the 14-member squad that played all the matches in the Plate Group and the semi-final against Rajasthan. 

Das was also the vice-captain of the side. 

Thirteen other youngsters, most of them new faces, have been drafted into a 24-member list of probables for the national one-dayers to be played at Dhanbad from February 11. 

Speedster Debashish Mohanty would be the captain of the squad, which has two new wicket-keepers in Haladhar Das and Sambit Rout. 

Several budding players from the under-19 squad have also been picked. 

The final squad would be selected on February 7.

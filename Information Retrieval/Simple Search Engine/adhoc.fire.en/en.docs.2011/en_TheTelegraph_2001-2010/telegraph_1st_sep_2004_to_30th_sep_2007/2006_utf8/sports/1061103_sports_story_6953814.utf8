Jaipur: When Chris Gayle hit Robin Peterson high over long-on for a scintillating over-boundary, the bowler was seen joining the spectators in applauding the left-hander. Like his fellow-South Africans bowlers, Peterson could actually do nothing better. 

At the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here on Thursday night, Gayle was simply unstoppable. If South Africa had nursed any hope of making it to the Champions Trophy final after posting a challenging 258 for eight, it was dashed very early in the Caribbean innings. 

The Australians will bring up the final hurdle for Brian Laras high-flying men. Ricky Ponting amp; Co. will surely be looking for revenge after having lost their group league duel. 

Gayle showed no respect for the South Africans who looked clueless in controlling the ferocious aggression of the opener. For the first time in the tournament, 258 looked too small a total and the West Indies overtook it in 44 overs for the loss of four wickets. 

Gayles unbeaten 133 (17x4, 3x6, 135 balls) was his third century of the tournament. He certainly loves the Indian pitches, having hit three hundreds during the West Indies tour here in 2002. 

Notice boards outside the stadium announced that one person would be admitted free with every ticket-holder. The Rajasthan Cricket Association also opened the gates free for schoolchildren. It was a desperate measure to attract fans in a game sans India, but the ploy worked. 

Those who thronged the stands definitely had a whale of a time. They were treated with a kind of batting display that hasnt been seen in the tournament so far. Chasing 259 for a place in the final for the second consecutive time, Gayle and Shivnaraine Chanderpaul cut the bowling to pieces. 

While Chanderpaul, who retired hurt on 57 because of leg cramps, was equally aggressive at the start, he preferred to take it a bit easy later as Gayle went berserk. 

In the first 10 overs, the openers took 75 runs and the 100 came in 16.2 overs. The plight of experienced customers like Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini had to be seen to be believed, and captain Graeme Smith had to take them off hastily after eight overs. 

By the 20th over, Smith had used five bowlers, but to no avail. Kallis raised some hopes with a couple of tight overs only to be hammered in the third by Gayle. He, too, was taken off the attack. South Africa had to wait till the 34th over to get their first wicket when Sarwan was trapped leg-before by Ntini. 

On Wednesday, Lara had said the better team will win, no matter what the pitch offered. His words proved prophetic. On a pitch where all but a couple of South African batsmen struggled, Gayle played in a manner as if he was having a nets session. He turned the ball whichever way he wished, hit it to all parts of the ground and made a mockery of so the potent South African bowling. 

Earlier, Herschelle Gibbs, who had not been among runs lately, struck a fine 77 to steer South Africa to a fighting total. Barring Abraham de Villiers (46) and Loots Bosman (39), none of the others could master the tidy Caribbean bowling. 

Demoted down the order, the 32-year-old right-hander took South Africa out of the woods with a delightful innings in 90 deliveries. Without him taking charge after the fall of the second wicket, South Africa would have fallen well short of the score they managed. 

The West Indiand bowled to a plan and according to the field, to restrict the South Africans, who lost three wickets before 100 runs were on the board. 

Just when it seemed the South African batting would crumble, Gibbs took charge along with De Villiers. The latters knock was a mixture of patience and aggression. 

He didnt go overboard, but kept the scoreboard ticking with singles and twos regularly. He only opened up later, hitting some superb strokes including a huge six Jerome off Taylor, who was again the best among the Windies bowlers.

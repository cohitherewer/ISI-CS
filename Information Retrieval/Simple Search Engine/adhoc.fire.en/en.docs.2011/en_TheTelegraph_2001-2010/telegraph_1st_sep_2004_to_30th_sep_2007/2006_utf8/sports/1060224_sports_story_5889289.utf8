 - Barcelona flowed with belief and fine passing football

Mocking cries swept around Stamford Bridge on Wednesday but Catalan crowing over this narrow victory tells only a fraction of an astonishing story, the evening stirring more spite and spice into relations between the champions of England and Spain. 

Killer blow: Barcelonas Samuel Eto reels, celebrating his winner. Depleted by Asier del Hornos controversial first-half dismissal, Chelseas 10 angry men performed with defiance, even taking the lead through Thiago Mottas 59th-minute own goal. Inevitably, though, their legs and lungs succumbed to the draining exertions of trying to withstand 11 talented opponents. 

And trying to tame Lionel Messi was like trying to trap mercury. The scheming Argentinian right-winger was the epitome of elusiveness, riding tackles, hitting the woodwork and creating chaos with his fast feet and even quicker mind. Ronaldinho moved into the centre to cause even more problems for Chelsea, and soon the dam broke. A John Terry own goal and Samuel Eto header ended Chelseas resistance. 

For now. The drama now switches from Chelseas beach of a pitch to the Mediterranean, and the March 7 second leg at the Nou Camp, where the visitors must score at least twice to survive. If they allow Messi and Ronaldinho any space, their Champions League dream will be over for another year. 

But if Chelsea show the sort of determination that Frank Lampard and Terry displayed against mounting odds, they may have a chance. Some of Terrys last-ditch clearances were minor miracles, the hosts captain continually flinging himself into the way of goal-bound strikes. 

From start to finish, the action was compelling. For this was an extraordinary evening of switchback fortunes on Chelseas poor pitch, the sludge match dissolving into another grudge match after 37 minutes with Del Hornos expulsion. 

The Spanish left-back, lacking confidence of late, had been an incident waiting to happen, constantly being embarrassed by the deft Messi. A livewire in lime, Messi kept cutting inside Del Horno, almost creating a goal after 19 minutes for Ronaldinho. Eto followed up but was thwarted by one of Ricardo Carvalhos trademark diving blocks. 

Del Horno did execute one important clearance, whipping the ball to safety after Peter Cech had brilliantly saved a Ronaldinho special, but the Spaniards world was falling apart, ripped asunder by the rapier thrusts of Messi. Already desperately fortunate to have escaped sanction for one disgraceful follow-through on Messi, Del Horno finally lost it. 

Del Horno was a picture of frustration as he flew in on his nemesis. With a blatant bodycheck, he caught Messi hard and high, sending the Barcelona No. 30 thudding to the floor, ripping Frank Rijkaard from his dug-out seat and ensuring every outfield player charged to the crime scene. 

Chelsea were incensed as the referee, Terje Hauge, raised a red card with all the seriousness of a High Court judge handing down a life sentence. Chelsea claimed, in vain, that their left-back was guilty more of stupidity than malice but the departing Spaniard had been playing a risky game for a while. 

Stirred by a sense of injustice, Chelseas remaining players raised their game, immediately given additional belief by Jose Mourinhos tactical switch. Joe Cole was withdrawn, Geremi introduced at right-back with Paulo Ferreira swapping his patrolling of Ronaldinho to take on some Messi work. Talk about journeys from frying pans to fires. 

Chelsea made light of a possible Geremi handball to storm back at Barcelona after the break. Didier Drogbas brawn replaced the brain of Hernan Crespo and Chelsea went high and long. 

Tempers rose with the balls trajectory. Lampard and Deco were in each others faces. Bile flowed around the Bridge. Chelseas supporters derided Messi and Hauge. Ronaldinho was treated to cries of Who are you? Only the World Player of the Year. 

Yet still Chelsea stood firm, still they threatened on the break. When Arjen Robben earned a free-kick just before the hour mark, Chelsea had their set-piece chance. Day after day, hour after hour, they practise their dead-ball routines under Mourinhos gimlet gaze down at Cobham. 

The ball was wide on the left, but Lampard can cause chaos from anywhere, and his free-kick triggered carnage in the Catalans box. Motta, under huge pressure from Terry, sought to clear but the ball bounced off him, past Victor Valdes and into the net. 

After Drogba had wasted a decent opening, Barcelona equalised through a set-piece of their own. When Ronaldinho bent the ball in from the left, Terry rose high in an attempt to clear but could steer the ball only into the net. Rarely have the sporting fates been so cruel. Terry was magnificent, somehow managing to clear a Ronaldinho shot off the line moments later. 

He needed to be at his most alert because Barcelona were flowing with belief and fine passing football, Ronaldinho exhibiting some dazzling footwork, Messi cutting in and striking the woodwork. A draw would have been an outstanding achievement but the waves of Barcelona attacks kept breaking on them. Finally Eto found a glimpse of goal, heading the ball powerfully past Cech.

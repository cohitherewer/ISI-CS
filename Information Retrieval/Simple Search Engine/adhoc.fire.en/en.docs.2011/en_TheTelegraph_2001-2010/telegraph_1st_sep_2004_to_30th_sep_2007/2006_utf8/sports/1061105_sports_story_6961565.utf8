Hyderabad: Sania Mirza and Leander Paes will pair up for the six-nation $ 70,000 Asian Hopman Cup to be held here from November 22-26. 

Sania said it was exciting to be a part of the Indian team alongside Paes but she was prepared for a tough competition at home turf. 

Its good that the event is happening in India, more so in Hyderabad. Although we will have the support of the home crowd, it will be a tough competition and we will try to give our best. 

About her partnership with Paes, she said, We havent really talked about it. A couple of days practice before the session would do a lot good. 

China, Japan, Chinese Taipei, Thailand, Uzbekistan besides hosts India will take part in the tournament. 

China and Chinese Taipei have very good players and its not going to be easy. The lowest ranked players will be somewhere between 75 and 80, she said. 

Putting her not-so-eventful year behind her, Sania said she had no fitness problems and was ready to play any number of tournaments. 

I have no fitness problems. It (fitness) is pretty good despite my busy schedule last year. 

Sania said: My trainer, Heath Mathew, will be arriving soon from South Africa and we will plan the future. But, as of now, I have no fitness problems.

 Well settle for a half-nil win: Scolari

Frankfurt: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari would settle for a half-nil win over Iran in Saturdays Group D match, he said on Friday. 

Portugal, who beat Angola 1-0 in their opening game last Sunday, are expecting a tough match against opponents who went down 1-3 to Mexico in their first outing. 

In many ways, this is the most difficult of the three games, said Scolari, whose team face Mexico in their final match. There are several details, things which put the Iranians apart, things which Angola and Mexico dont have, added the Brazilian, known back home as Big Phil. 

I sense that there is less nervousness in our team than there was before the first game but I also feel theres a little more respect for Iran. The players expect more difficulties than in the first game. 

I think Iran have an excellent team and, as far as Im concerned, if we win half-nil, 1-0 or 2-1, that will be enough to reach our target. 

Scolari played down talk about the possibility that he will leave his job after the World Cup and remarks by leading players in the Portuguese media that it will be a step back for Portugal if he goes. 

I joked with Costinha and (Luis) Figo that they are crawlers for saying those things, said Scolari, who led Brazil to the world title in 2002. 

Cristiano Ronaldo has a good chance of starting after re-joining his teammates for training on Friday, Scolari said. 

The expected return of Barcelona playmaker Deco, who missed the first game because of an injury, will add firepower to the forward line. 

Portugals weak point, though, is their defence. Fernando Meiras form since replacing injured first-choice Jorge Andrade in central defence has been patchy and could be vulnerable against the pacey Iranian strikers. 

Iran have been plagued by injury worries and restlessness in the team camp. Having lost 1-3 to Mexico after a shoddy second half, Iran cannot afford another defeat in Frankfurt. 

Veteran striker Ali Daei will play, his coach Branko Ivankovic said on Friday. 

After the match against Mexico, a few players were struggling but now all are fit. Daei is an important leader and can make sure that we are going to get a good result, Ivankovic said at a news conference. 

Ali Daei, 37, Irans captain and the only footballer to score more than 100 international goals, looked uncertain for Saturdays match against Portugal after a back injury .

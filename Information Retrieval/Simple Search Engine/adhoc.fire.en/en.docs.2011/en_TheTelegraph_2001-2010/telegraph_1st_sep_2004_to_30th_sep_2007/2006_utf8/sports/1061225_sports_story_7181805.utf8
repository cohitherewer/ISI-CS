 Sreesanth turns down tricky offer

 - Magician tony Lee has a tip or two for out-of-form Gibbs 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: Sreesanth had just begun breakfast at the Southern Sun Elangeni, on Sunday, when magician Tony Lee walked up and offered to teach a trick or two. There was, of course, a catch: He wanted the first Tests MoM to give him tips on the art of swing bowling! 

I didnt take up the offer, Sreesanth told The Telegraph laughing. 

Lee has been wearing the magicians coat for the last five years, after retiring from a food business, and is on contract with the Southern Sun group, South Africas premier hotel chain. 

This is the festive season and I keep going around hotels... I dont only entertain kids, Lee informed. In fact, hed gone to the out-of-form Herschelle Gibbs table as well and conjured up a water trick. 

Being a South African, I wished Gibbs luck and commented that he must watch out for Sreesanth. Gibbs responded by saying Zaheer Khan is the one who got him for a duck in both innings at the Wanderers. Well... Lee said. 

Asked if he also made predictions, Lee guffawed: I do, but cant say who is going to win the Test at Kingsmead... Dont want to stick my neck out! What I do know is that weve got to watch out for Sreesanths swing. 

Lee, who is 65, follows cricket pretty closely. He grew up admiring Barry Richards. Of the present lot, hes a huge fan of Brian Lara. Wish I could meet him, he remarked. 

Perhaps, a trick will take him to the West Indies.

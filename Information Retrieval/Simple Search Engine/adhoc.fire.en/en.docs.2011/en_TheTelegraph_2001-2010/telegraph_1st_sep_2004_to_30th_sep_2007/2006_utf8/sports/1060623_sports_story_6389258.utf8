 Crouch swipe at critics

Buhlertal: Peter Crouch took a swipe on Thursday at critics who say England play more long balls with the two-metre tall striker in their World Cup side. 

Asked if England were more of a long-ball side when he played, the 2.04-metre Crouch told a news conference: It frustrates me when people say that, to be honest. It really does. (Reuters)

 Rafael Nadal looks for a special goal

 - Australian open 

 Rafael Nadal 

Paris: Rafael Nadal is determined to kick-off 2007 at full throttle and make up for the bitter disappointment of his injury-ravaged start to 2006. 

A crippling foot injury ruled the world number two out of the first six weeks of this year, an absence which also included the opening Grand Slam event in Australia. 

But in 2007, the French Open champion is wasting no time in his build-up to Melbourne where the Australian Open begins on January 15. 

Nadal will begin his season on January 1 at the Chennai Open and then travel to Sydney for the Medibank International. At both events he will be top seed. 

I have a big motivation because when I come back to Australia its one of my favourite tournaments and the weather is perfect for me, Nadal said in a teleconference to promote the Sydney event. 

I was in Sydney in 2004 just for one night. Melbourne is one of my favourite cities in the world, a special city for me, and as well it is a big motivation. Its one of my special goals for 2007 to play well in Australia. 

The 20-year-old ended the 2006 season amid a title drought. 

Nadal won 11 titles during 2005 and in 2006 he added five more from his first eight tournaments, including a second consecutive Roland Garros crown. 

But the left-hander failed to win another title in his last eight tournaments of the season. 

The second half of the year was not bad, insisted Nadal. I have good moments, but I lost three important quarter finals and one semi-final in Shanghai.

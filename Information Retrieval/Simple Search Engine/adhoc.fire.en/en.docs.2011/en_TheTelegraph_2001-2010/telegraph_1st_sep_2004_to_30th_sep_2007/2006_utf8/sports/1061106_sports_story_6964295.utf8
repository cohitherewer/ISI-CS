 Golds for Soma, Hari, Manisha

 - National Athletics 

Chennai: Soma Biswas, Hari Shankar Roy and Manisha Dey brought gold for Bengal on the concluding day of the 46th National Senior Athletics on Sunday. There was, however, disappointment for Pinki Pramanik. 

The second-placed Pinki, who won the 400m gold, lost to Sinimol Paulose of Jharkhand in the 800m dash. 

Soma, however, proved once again that she is still a force to reckon with when she, with 5799 points, pipped statemate Sushmita Singha Roy (5761) to the gold. J.J. Shobha finished third. 

Kerala regained the overall title after a gap of five years with a tally of 191.000 points. 

In mens high jump, Hari Shankar leapt 2.16 metres on way to claiming the gold, ahead of Tamil Nadus Starly Benedict (2.10) and Keralas Prince Jose (2.05). 

In womens triple jump, Manishas leap of 13.04m was too good for Keralite duo Anisha K Vijayan (12.99) and M.A. Prajusha (12.43). 

Rakhi Saha won the bronze in womens 200m. (PTI)

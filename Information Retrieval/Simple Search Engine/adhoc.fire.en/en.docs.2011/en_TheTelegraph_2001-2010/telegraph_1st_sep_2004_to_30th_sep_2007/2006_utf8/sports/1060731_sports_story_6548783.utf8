 Gatlin was set up: Coach

Kingston: Justin Gatlins coach believes his sprinter was set up, and he knows who did it. 

Gatlin, the 100m world record-holder, has tested positive for doping (as reported in Sundays Late City edition) and faces a lifetime ban from athletics because it is his second offence. 

But Trevor Graham, Gatlins coach, told Jamaican television that the American sprinter was sabotaged. 

We are 100 per cent sure who it is, Graham said on Saturday. 

The individual that did it, its an individual that we fired and we went back and hired... he came to the Kansas relay and was (upset) with Justin. 

We are trying to go after the individual. Hopefully we can prove our case, but we know who the person is and how it got into his system, Graham added. 

Gatlin, who shares the 100m record of 9.77 seconds with Jamaicas Asafa Powell, said on Saturday that he tested positive for testosterone or other prohibited steroids. He released a statement through his publicist saying that the United States Anti-Doping Agency informed him of the test taken after a relay race in Kansas in April. 

Gatlin, the Olympic and world 100m champion, earlier tested positive for a banned substance contained in Adderall, which he took while in college to calm attention deficit disorder. 

He was given a two-year ban from international competition after the first infraction, but it was later reduced to one year. 

If his second positive test is confirmed, it would mean a lifetime ban from the sport, the IAAF said Sunday in a statement. 

If the USADA procedure concludes by confirming the violation, the sanction under IAAF rules will be a life ban, the IAAF said.

 Iran, Korea make finals

Seoul: Iran downed Taiwan 2-0 and South Korea drew Syria 1-1 on Wednesday to book their berths at next years Asian Cup soccer tournament. 

Australia, who had already secured their spot in the finals, dominated an under-strength Bahrain 2-0 to ensure a seeding at the tournament, while Uzbekistan kept their qualification hopes alive with a 4-0 thrashing of Bangladesh. 

Cho Jae-jin scored on a header in the ninth-minute off a Choi Sung-kuk at Seoul World Cup Stadium and South Korea held on to squash Syrias hopes of advancing. 

Syria equalised nine minutes later when Korean goalkeeper Kim Young-kwang fumbled his clearance and allowed forward Maher Al Said to circle him and score from a tight angle. 

The South Korean defence preserved the draw and denied Syria the win it needed to have a chance of advancing. 

Veteran playmaker Ali Karimi scored both of Irans goals in Taipei to assure his team its 11th Asian Cup appearance. 

The Bayern Munich midfielder scored in the 11th minute and sealed the win after the break in the 57th.

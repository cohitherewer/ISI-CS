The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stage cleared for Sundays battle 

 - All results will be declared together 

 - Comedy of errors over, says Panja 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Court-appointed 

 observer Santosh Kumar Phoujdar at the CAB on Thursday 

 Calcutta: The die is cast. 

 Come Sunday, 119 voters will decide which group rules the 

 Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the next 12 months.

 Court-appointed observer Santosh 

 Kumar Phoujdar (not Fouzdar) completed the process of scrutinising 

 nomination papers on Thursday afternoon and it was at 4 

 pm that the final list was put up on the CAB notice board.

 Phoujdars day started with 

 a date with Ajit Panja. The former Union minister 

 clarified that he didnt want to contest for the post 

 of CAB president and that his signature had been penned 

 at the wrong place.

 The observer was satisfied? 

 The comedy of errors is over, Panja said before leaving 

 the CAB.

 The stage was thus cleared for 

 Jagmohan Dalmiya and Prasun Mukherjee to fight for the presidents 

 post in arguably the most high-profile CAB elections.

 Phoujdars next job was to 

 settle three disputed cases. He heard officials of Ballygunge 

 Sporting, Victoria Sporting and Narkeldanga Sir Gurudas 

 Institute before clearing the nominations of all.

 A letter regarding South Suburbans 

 nomination was brought to Phoujdar, but the observer refused 

 to hear it.

 It was learnt that Bata and Calcutta 

 Rangers, whose nominations had been cancelled on Wednesday 

 itself, tried to argue their cases afresh on Thursday but 

 Phoujdar wasnt impressed. Those are the only two clubs, 

 which will miss out in Sundays voting.

 Interacting the media after the 

 days proceedings, Mukherjee said he was very happy 

 with the observers role. He handled the matter 

 very well, all rules and procedures were followed? All rightful 

 voters can vote fearlessly and secretly on Sunday, 

 said the commissioner of police.

 He further informed that it had 

 been decided that all results would be declared together. 

 This is a departure from the norm followed in the past few 

 years, when the presidents election would first be 

 conducted and its result announced before moving on to voting 

 for other office-bearers.

 As Dalmiya explained, it had been 

 decided unanimously to have voting for all posts at the 

 same time this year primarily to save time. For the 

 past six-seven years, there hadnt been any contest 

 for the working committee slots as a rotation policy among 

 clubs was followed. This time, there could be a contest 

 for the working committee (12 seats for first division clubs, 

 12 for second division and four for districts), and so voting 

 process may become lengthy.

 As of now, a contest is on the 

 cards for the working committee. But the two sides could 

 yet reach a consensus whereby the rotation policy would 

 continue.

 How did the two captains 

 look at the scenario now that the voters list has 

 been finalised?

 I cant talk of numbers, 

 but Im confident well win? said Mukherjee.

 The process of scrutiny 

 was completed today? nothing happened which made us more 

 or less confident than what we already were? said 

 Dalmiya.

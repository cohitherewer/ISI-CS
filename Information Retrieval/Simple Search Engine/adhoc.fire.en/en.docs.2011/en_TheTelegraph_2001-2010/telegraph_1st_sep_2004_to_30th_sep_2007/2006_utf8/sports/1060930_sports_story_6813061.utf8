 Federer doesnt have a weakness: Berdych

 - Top quartet of Mumbai meet on what makes the world No. 1 different 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Federer 

Mumbai: The top four seeds at this weeks Kingfisher Airlines Open are men on the move with an eye on the throne. But they are often confronted by a common enemy, as do all their contemporaries (save Rafael Nadal). Roger Federer. 

Spaniard Tommy Robredo has played the world No. 1 six times and all he has managed is one set. Croatian Mario Ancic mastered Federer at Wimbledon in 2002 but came a cropper in their next four meetings. Ditto for Czech Tomas Berdych, who won their maiden encounter at the 2004 Athens Olympics only to lose their last four clashes. Russian Dmitry Tursunov has been at the wrong end of the scoreline both times he has crossed swords with the Super Swiss. 

What is so special about Federer? What makes him so invincible? The Telegraph sought answers from the top quartet in Mumbai. All but Ancic seemed to be in awe of the nine-time Grand Slam champion. 

Here is what they had to say (alphabetically): 

ANCIC: I have no doubt that Federer is the most complete player ever. He has had an incredible run at the top. But Nadal has shown that he can be beaten. Hes a human being, and will have his bad days. I beat him a long time ago, since then he has moved to a different level and beat me four times. But I have also improved and can beat all good players on my day. Yes, if I can be at the top of my game, I can beat Federer. Its tough but not impossible. 

BERDYCH: Federer doesnt have a weakness his serve, return, forehand, backhand everything is good. Thats why he performs well on all surfaces. His confidence level is so high that it gives him a mental edge over other players, most of whom go into a match with Federer already a set down. I won our first duel because he didnt know my style. Now, I feel I can beat him only if my game is at more than 100 per cent and hes not feeling good on that particular day. 

ROBREDO: He has a complete game, better than even Pete Sampras. If Federer is playing at his best, you have no chance. If he gives you a chance, you have to capitalise. Hes not always very comfortable on the backhand side, so you try to pin him down on his backhand long enough and hope he makes a mistake. 

 TURSUNOV: Federer reads the game better than others, 

 he sorts out his rivals easily. Hes gifted in all 

 departments. His confidence level is amazing, even if hes 

 not playing well, he doesnt panic. To beat him, I 

 have to stick to my strengths and keep on attacking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Former Member of Parliament and eminent scribe and writer M. J. Akbar was appointed president of the Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday.

 Akbar replaced Jamil Manjar, who?ll now be the working president. The club also brought in former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah as a member of the executive committee. Sultan Ahmed stays as general secretary. Though the club announced Subhas Bhowmick?s name as coach, it is still unclear whether Bhowmick will stay on. It has been learnt that Bhowmick submitted a list of 45 names from which he wants to select the squad. There is every possibility that the veteran coach may quit if the club fails to recruit those players.

 Akbar announced that the players, who don the club colours for three consecutive years, would come under a medical insurance net worth Rs 1 lakh. ?Those who turned out for the club for five years in the past will also be brought under the insurance scheme,? he said. 

 The club would take up a massive membership drive soon. ?Our members can also get medical treatment at discounted rates,? he said. Akbar said the club?s dressing room would be renovated soon. 

 Increasing the budget while making squad this season will also be kept in mind.

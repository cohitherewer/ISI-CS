 Fleming pins hopes on Astle

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: At a time when heavy commercialisation of cricket means players need to slug it out all through the year, New Zealands absence from the one-day International scenario since March borders on the rarity. The Black Caps hosted the West Indies in a five-match ODI series and duly won 4-1. 

It has been a welcome break for all us it has made us fresh. We are now ready to go with a freshness and much enthusiasm, Fleming said on Sunday, the eve of New Zealands Champions Trophy campaign-opener against South Africa. 

The stylist left-hander, however, feared a long lay-off has its side effects as well. There is this fear of missing the edge of competition We need to pick that up as soon as we can. You cant reclaim it with warm-up matches, so we need to get the momentum going right from the beginning, Fleming pointed out. 

With Shane Bond out of the opening tie with a sore back, Flemings freshness mantra may get lost at the hands of a highly confident South African side. Fleming, though, pinned lot of hopes on veteran Nathan Astle to tide over such a crisis. 

Nathan scores runs very fast and when he is on song, he wins games for us almost on his own.We want to see him firing again tomorrow, Fleming observed. With the ball, he comes in handy, especially in the middle-overs. 

South Africa captain Graeme Smith, on the other hand, described themselves as a drilled team. We believe in a good team environment We havent just relied on one particular player to deliver. he said. Its an advantage that we have had players who have won games from various situations, Smith added. 

The match will be played on the wicket next to what on Saturday saw the West Indies getting dismissed for a paltry 80 in the face of the Champions Trophys best spell six for 14 by the Sri Lankan mediumpacer Fervez Mahroof. 

If the pitch behaves like yesterday, Styris, Astle and the spinners will come into play. I think we can explore these conditions, Fleming signed off.

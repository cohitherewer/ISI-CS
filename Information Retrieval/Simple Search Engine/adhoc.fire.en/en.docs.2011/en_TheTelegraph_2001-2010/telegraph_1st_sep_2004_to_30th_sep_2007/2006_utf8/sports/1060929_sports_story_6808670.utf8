 A test for Ponting, says Ian Chappell 

Sydney: Former Australian captain Ian Chappell, a critic of Ricky Pontings leadership in last years Ashes loss to England, says this years return series will be the defining moment of Pontings captaincy. 

Chappell, one of Australian crickets most successful and influential captains from the 1970s and now a prominent television commentator, was critical of Pontings tactics and leadership in last years series in England. He criticised Ponting for his consensus approach to captaincy and uncertain body language in comparison with the more assured England skipper Michael Vaughan. 

Chappell says England, now under the leadership of star allrounder Andrew Flintoff, will provide the acid test of Pontings leadership this southern summer. The real test for him is going to come if England put the heat on Australia again, Chappell told a Melbourne newspaper on Thurs-day. Thats when you will see whether he has changed that aspect of his captaincy a lot. (AFP)

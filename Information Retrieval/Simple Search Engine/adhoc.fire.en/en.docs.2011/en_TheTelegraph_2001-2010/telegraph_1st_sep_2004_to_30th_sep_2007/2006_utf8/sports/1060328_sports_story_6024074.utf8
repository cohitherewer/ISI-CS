New Delhi: Its a seven-match ODI series that is getting underway at the Kotla on Monday. But captains Rahul Dravid and Andrew Flintoff seemed more tuned in to the 2007 World Cup than the upcoming contest. 

Rahul Dravid talked about the importance of building up the team for the World Cup, as did Andrew Flintoff. 

Defending his young and inexperienced side, the England captain said: The present lot deserve to play in this one-day series. It is time we get the right combination and find out the right players for the World Cup. 

Dravid was his confident self and felt the series would be a great opportunity to form the team for the World Cup. We have a chance to make the necessary changes, to build up the combination. This series will also go a long way in developing the right team for the World Cup. 

Dravid, who patiently answered a series of questions for nearly half an hour, lost his cool initially when he was twice interrupted at the press conference because of the bickering among TV crew and still photographers over positioning of cameras. They were asked to maintain silence, but the organisers plea fell on deaf ears. The frustrated Dravid got up and walked out in a huff. 

The Indian captain returned after peace was restored. 

Defending his five-bowler theory, Dravid said it leaves the team with the option of choosing its combination depending on the type of wicket. And then, we also have to be careful with these young cricketers. So many times we find them getting injured when the team uses them too often, said Dravid. 

Sachins injury has created a bit of problem. Now we have Yuvraj, Raina and Sehwag who can bowl a bit for us. We have to see whether we can get a bit more out of these bowlers. We need multi-skilled and multi-talented cricketers. 

While terming the Kotla pitch as one that could help the bowlers a bit, the Indian skipper pointed out in the same breath that the team batting first will have to score big to win. This has been the trend in ODIs. The one between Australia and South Africa which produced 872 runs was labelled as one of the best ever matches. Quite a few bowlers did not agree, but thats the way one-dayers are played these days, he said. 

Flintoff agreed. Its all been the influence of Twenty20 cricket. Even 250 cant win matches these days. One has to score at least 300 to be on the safer side. 

Munaf Patel walked off midway through the practice session, but Dravid said the young paceman had a slight bruise in the heel and there was nothing to worry about.

Greensboro: Arjun Atwal made a determined bid to retain his PGA Tour card with one of his strongest starts of the season as he carded a five-under 67 to be tied 10th at the end of first round of the Chrysler Classic at the Forest Oaks Country Club on Thursday. 

Atwal, who is 143rd and needs to get inside top-125 for the 2007 PGA Tour card had a 67 that included an eagle and six other birdies besides three bogeys, two of them in his last three holes. 

Daniel Chopra, who has already sealed his card with earnings of more than a million dollars and 77th place, is trying to get into top-70 for entry in big events next season. 

Chopra shot a four-under 68, which also included an eagle on second hole, besides three birdies and one bogey on 17th that placed him tied 22nd. 

Brent Geiberger, currently 144th on the money list, carded eight-under 64 that gave him a share of the lead with John Rollins and Nick Watney. 

Atwal opened with an eagle on second and then added birdies on third, seventh and ninth to be five-under at the turn. He dropped a shot on 10th, but birdies on 14th and 15th brought him to six-under. He again dropped a shot on 16th, picked up a birdie on 17th before dropping a bogey on 18th. 

Atwal found 11 of the 14 fairways and needed 27 putts as he displayed better consistency than he this season. 

Chopra had an eagle on the second and birdies on the eighth, 11th and 13th. His only bogey was on the 17th. 

John Senden, Robert Gamez, Mike Sposa, Tag Ridings, James Driscoll and Charley Hoffman were two strokes back. Defending champion K.J. Choi opened with a 65.

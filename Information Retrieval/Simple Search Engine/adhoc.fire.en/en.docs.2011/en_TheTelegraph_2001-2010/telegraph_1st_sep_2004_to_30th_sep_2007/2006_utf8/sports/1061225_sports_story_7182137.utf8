The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pereira likely to be shown the door 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Not many days ago, while addressing his first media conference East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Da Pereira had described coaching Indian football as a great challenge. But as things appear at the moment, Pereira could be shown the door very soon. 

Having already incurred the wrath of the frenzied fans following the red-and-golds quarter final exit from the Federation Cup on Saturday evening, it was time for some introspection by the club officials. 

The Brazilian coach, it has been learnt, has been granted a days time to take a decision about his future. If he is unwilling to quit, he could be asked to leave. 

It is also learnt that Pereira has lamented the lack of proper striker, a major reason for the teams failure in the IFA Shield, Durand Cup and Federeation Cup. 

The 60-year-old Pereira began his coaching career in 1970 with Brazils Madumira Football Club. He has coached Vasco da Gama, leading outfits of Qatar and the UAE, and was also in charge of the Singapore national team between.

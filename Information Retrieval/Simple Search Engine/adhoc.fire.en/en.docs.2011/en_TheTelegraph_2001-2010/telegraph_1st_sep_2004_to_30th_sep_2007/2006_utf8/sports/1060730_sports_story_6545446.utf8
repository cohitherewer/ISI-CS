The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The takeover fear and the cold feet syndrome...

 - High-Voltage Battle for Eden reaches decisive stage 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Will former BCCI and CAB president B.N. Dutt, seen relaxing at home on Saturday, be the proverbial kingmaker? Picture by Santosh Ghosh 

 Calcutta: The battle 

 is not over. I may not be here next time and someone else 

 will take my place, had been Dinesh Vajpais 

 reaction after being thrashed by Jagmohan Dalmiya a year 

 ago. 

West Bengals former DGP and one-time city police commissioner, though, couldnt have anticipated what has unfolded over the past few weeks. 

For one, neither candidate fighting for the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) presidents post is going to win by the amazing 106-13 margin Dalmiya managed the last time. 

Second, theres a strong possibility that cross-voting will lead to no one panel being swept to power. 

Third, after Sunday, the CAB wont ever be the same again. 

Theres more? 

Incidentally, owing to the South Suburban Club development, its not clear whether the electorate is going to comprise 118 or 119. 

The city civil court-appointed observer, Justice (retd) Santosh Kumar Phoujdar, will communicate his decision one hour before the 5.00 pm start to the CABs 75th AGM. 

Both challenger Prasun Mukherjee, the police commissioner, and incumbent Dalmiyas followers have been insisting they have the numbers ? specifically, at least 70. 

Thats just not possible. 

Till late on Saturday, the buzz in the Maidan was that Dalmiya (who has been in the chair for over a decade) was ahead. However, probably not by much. 

 Indeed, The Telegraphs 

 sources believe Mukherjee could substantially improve his 

 position if a few voters committed to the ruling group develop 

 cold feet overnight. 

Dalmiya has defied the chief minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee), but some loyal to him may have a re-think about antagonising the Establishment, particularly if theyve also given an assurance to Mukherjee, is how somebody put it. 

Voting is by secret ballot, but word does get around as to who ditched whom. The most vulnerable, clearly, are the ones whove given assurances to both Dalmiya and Mukherjee. 

Theyre bound to have a restless night, even though the challenger has been canvassing as a perfect gentleman. 

While Mukherjee stands to benefit from a cold feet syndrome, equally, his being the governments nominee may actually work against him in a big way as the Maidan dons dont want Sunday to mark the start of a takeover. 

If Mukherjee pulls off an upset, much of the credit is going to be his. The police commissioners image (and the office he holds) has taken him to the position he is in. 

The credit wont even go to Sourav Ganguly for his e-mail last week, which chewed up Dalmiya. If anything, the former Team India captains stature has diminished somewhat. 

Significantly, former Board of Control for Cricket in India and CAB president B.N. Dutt has been the one wooed the most by both candidates. 

Besides direct influence over 10-odd affiliated units, hes in a position to offer advice to some others. 

Dutt, however, dismissed a suggestion that hes the kingmaker. 

Im close to turning 80 and not keeping good health? Ive simply been telling people to do what they think is best, he remarked when a comment was sought. 

Fact is his blessings are needed. 

Dalmiyas lead isnt at least 20 as is being talked about by supporters, but closer to 10-12? He should win unless it gets too hot for his backers between now and tomorrow evening, is what a high-profile former cricketer, who has kept himself aloof from the goings-on, had to say. 

Obviously, somebody like Samar Paul, who has been fighting Dalmiya for a number of years, thinks differently: In his opinion, Mukherjee is assured of 75 votes. 

Dalmiya wont endorse that, but he must be aware he has taken guard on a wicket which can deteriorate quickly. Also, that one Sharad Pawar is a very keen watcher. 

Once the lord of all he surveyed, Dalmiya has had to pay heavily for using the casting vote (a right he also enjoys in the CAB) against Pawar 22 months ago. 

 His fingers will be crossed. 

 Footnote: Union ministers 

 Lalu Prasad and Praful Patel, who arent favourably 

 disposed towards Dalmiya, were in the city on Saturday. 

 That created a stir, but it couldnt be confirmed whether 

 they deviated from the official programmes.

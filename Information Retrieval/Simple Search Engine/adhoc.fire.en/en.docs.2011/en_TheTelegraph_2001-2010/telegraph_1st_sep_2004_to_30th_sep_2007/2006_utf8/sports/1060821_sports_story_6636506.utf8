 Play at cost of personal sacrifices

Colombo: The International Cricket Council 

 (ICC) on Sunday expressed disappointment at South Africas 

 pullout from the tri-series in Sri Lanka, saying that the 

 reasons offered had nothing to do with cricket. 

 ICC president Percy Sonn, who has also headed Cricket 

 South Africa (CSA) until taking over the games top 

 job barely a month ago, said the game of cricket should 

 have been played at any cost. 

The ICCs position is that play the game at the cost of personal sacrifices... The spirit of cricket overrides all other considerations, Sonn said. 

Sonn said South Africas decision to depart hastily was disappointing, especially when the reasons had nothing to do with cricket. 

Always play at the worst circumstances. Never ever let go a chance to play cricket, he said. 

South Africa called off their tour of Sri Lanka after playing two Tests and without participating in a tri-series that was scheduled from August 14 to 29 after a fatal bomb explosion in the vicinity of the team hotel last Monday.

Sonn said it was difficult to say as to what his advise would have been to the South African team if he had still been their president but cited two instances from the past to show that sport should go on. 

In 1995, we hosted the rugby World Cup and it brought us, the whites, the blacks and all, together, he said. 

And in the early 70s, the Irish Republican army made it clear that they would target the sporting teams. Yet, the English rugby team still chose to go and play in Ireland, and they were given an extraordinary welcome by the Irish people. 

That is the example to follow, Sonn said. 

Sonn also mentioned Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khans book on Pakistans series against India in 2004 as another example to show how sport can break various social barriers. 

Sonn said there were no concerns about the ICC Champions Trophy in India in the wake of Mumbai serial train blasts. We have to look more closely at the measures put in place, but we have no concerns, he said. 

 Johannesburg is the crime capital of the world, 

 he said to another question. 

 Meanwhile, Sri Lankas senior cricketers, including 

 Muttiah Muralidharan, has slammed South Africas decision 

 to pull out citing security concerns. 

What they have done is wrong, it is not good for Sri Lankan cricket, Chaminda Vaas said. 

Murali said: It was unfortunate that South Africa decided to go without considering the future of Sri Lankan cricket. Our cricket is dependent on revenues from tours. 

Kumar Sangakkara lamented the fact that the South Africans chose to go despite guarantees from the highest authority in the land. 

 They decided to go after taking into considerations 

 that both the Sri Lankan board and the government promised 

 the best security cover, the wicketkeeper-batsman 

 said.

 Jeev shoots par to be tied sixth 

 - Bangkok Golf 

 Jeev Milkha in Bangkok on Saturday 

Bangkok: Jeev Milkha Singh managed only an even par 72 despite hitting four birdies in the third round and was tied sixth in the Volvo Masters of Asia at the Thai Country Club. 

Jeev, who is five shots away from the leader Thongchai Jaidee, admitted that he would need a really good score to challenge the Thai, who is hoping to end what has been a barren year for him. 

Jaidee, who won the Volvo Masters in 2003, shot a three-under 69 and leads fellow Thai Prayad Marksaeng (68) by two. 

Marksaeng was in shared second with Wiratchant, the Asia No.1 last year, and US-based Malaysian Ian Steel, who had a brilliant front nine of 32 on way to 66 that put him at nine-under and gave him a shot at his maiden Asian Tour title. 

Filipino veteran Frankie Minoza (68) was sole fifth, while six players, including Jeev Milkha Singh were in tied sixth. The group also included Prom Meesawat, who played with Jeev on Saturday. 

While Jeev was the best among the seven Indians in the field, S.S.P. Chowrasia was the most consistent with all three sub par rounds. With a one-under 71, he was five-under and tied 12th. 

Im going to give it one big shot Sunday and come closer to the top, said Chowrasia. (PTI)

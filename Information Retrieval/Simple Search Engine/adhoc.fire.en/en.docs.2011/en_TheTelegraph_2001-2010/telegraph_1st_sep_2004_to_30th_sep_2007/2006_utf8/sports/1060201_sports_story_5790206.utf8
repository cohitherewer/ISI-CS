 Martina Hingis in reckoning for Laureus award

Sydney: Mahesh Bhupathi may have done Martina Hingis a huge favour by helping her win the Australian Open mixed doubles crown last week. 

The Swiss Miss, for whom the triumph in Australia gave her the 15th career Grand Slam title and her first mixed doubles crown, is now in the running for Laureus World Comeback of the Year award. 

Twenty-five-year-old Hingis was playing at the years first tennis major after a three-year lay-off. She had won five singles and nine womens doubles titles before injury forced her to take a break. 

Another nominee for the Laureus award from among the Australian Open winners was Hingis compatriot and mens world No. 1 Roger Federer, an Australian website reported. Federer claimed his seventh Grand Slam after taming Cypriot sensation Marcos Baghdatis in the final to be in line for his second World Sportsman of the Year award. 

Baghdatis himself was in the reckoning for World Newcomer of the Year award, the website said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Surkumar named AIFFs Player of the Year 

 - Md. Sp.-JCT tie to kick off NFL on Jan. 5

Calcutta: Mahindra United defender Surkumar Singh has been adjudged the Player of the Year for 2006 by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) in its annual general body meeting held in New Delhi on Wednesday. 

For Surkumar, its, however, an absolutely unexpected news. 

I got to know about it from my sister who lives in Delhi. But this award is absolutely unexpected... I though either Sandip Nandy or Mahesh Gawli would get it, he said. 

Dedicating the award to his family, Surkumar felt that his team both national and Mahindra played a key role in helping him get it. 

Mahindra coach Derick Pereira, meanwhile, lauded the awardee as a consistent performer. 

Interestingly, a huge cake was cut in the Mahindra team-hotel in Surkumars honour. Later, they went to watch Dhoom 2. 

Having graduated from the Tata Football Academy (TFA), Surkumar has come a long way as one of the most rough and tough defenders in the country. The Manipur born player started his career with East Bengal before switching over to Mumbai. 

He has been in tremendous form for the past one year and has come to Indias rescue a number of times. The month of December seems to have come as a boon for the soft-spoken defender from Mahindra. 

Only recently, in the Doha Asian Games, Surkumar was handed over the mantle of captaincy in the crucial match against Iran after Bhaichung Bhutia was forced to sit owing to two yellow cards. 

He also led India in a couple of exhibition matches in Dubai on the eve of the Asian Games. 

The AIFF has also decided not to allot Calcutta any National Football League (NFL) matches till mid-February. It may be recalled that the IFA has cited the problem of hosting matches due to unavailability of grounds since the time coincides with some religious occasions. These matches are now likely to be held in Delhi and Gurgaon. 

The NFL will start with the Mohammedan Sporting versus JCT match in Delhi on January 5. 

It has also allocated Rs 30 lakh for a talent-spotting scheme in the next calendar year.

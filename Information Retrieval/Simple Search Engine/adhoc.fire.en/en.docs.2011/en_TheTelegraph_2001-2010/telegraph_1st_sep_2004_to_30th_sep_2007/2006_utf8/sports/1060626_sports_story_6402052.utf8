 Player of the day

 Maxi Rodriguez 

Italian coach Marcelo Lippi must be cursing his own luck after watching Argentinas Maxi Rodriguez score a stunner against Mexico on Saturday. The 25-year-old midfielder-cum-striker was born in Rosario, Santa Fe, but holds dual citizenships ? both Argentina and Italy. 

Rodriguez, however, had little chance of playing for Italy. An attacking talent of real class, Rodriguez was a hero in Argentina before he turned 20 when he shot to international prominence in Argentinas 2001 Fifa World Youth Championship winning effort. He scored four goals, including one in the final. 

On Saturday, Rodriguezs goal in the eighth minute of extra time could well be described as the goal of the tournament so far. Messi, from a central position midway inside Mexicos half, played the ball out wide to Sorin, whose left-footed delivery picked out Rodriguez on the left-hand edge of the penalty area. He took the ball on his chest and thundered a left footed dipping volley into the top right-hand corner of the net to score his third goal in the World Cup. 

One of a number of players vying for the right midfield slot, Rodriguez has the added bonus of being able to play up front as well. It is as a forward that he has spent most of his club career and has scored a number of crucial goals at Espanyol, having joined the Catalan side from Newells Old Boys, which earned him a move to Atletico Madrid at the start of the 2005-06 season at 12 million euro.

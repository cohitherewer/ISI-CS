 Veerans overcome Rangers

Chandigarh: Chennai Veerans scored in the last minute to overcame a spirited challenge from Imphal Rangers for a thrilling 3-2 in a tier II match of the Premier Hockey League here on Wednesday. 

After going down by two goals, the Rangers made a strong comeback restoring parity by the end of the third quarter. But Veerans, who missed a golden chance to take the lead muffing a penalty stroke, struck the winner with seconds to go when V. Raja put Adam Sinclair in possession, and the wily Olympian shot home without any fuss. 

Earlier, Veerans drew the first blood in the thirteenth minute, following a move from the right flank when Sinclair sent a stinging cross into the circle and an alert Raja deflected past a bemused Rangers custodian Herojit Singh. 

Stung by the reverse, Rangers attacked with vigour with M. Chittaranjan and Brojen Singh combining well in the frontline, but failed to convert their good moves. (PTI)

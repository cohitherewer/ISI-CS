New Delhi: Syed Nayeemuddin is not known to agree with others on matters relating to football. But on Tuesday, the Indian chief coach was quick to accept the views of his Yemen counterpart when both met the media in the morning. 

For us, Wednesdays tie is only a battle for the third place in the group, said Yemen coach Ahmed Al-Alrae. We dont expect to beat Japan or Saudi Arabia, he added. Nayeemuddin, reluctantly though, nodded in agreement. 

Yet, the India coach looked a tense man, perhaps more than his players on the eve of the India-Yemen Asian Cup qualifiers here. After the disaster in Japan, the Yemen tie has become a must-win game for him. A defeat at the Ambedkar Stadium can jeopardise his contract with the AIFF, which is till the Doha Asian Games. 

A difficult battle lies ahead as Nayeemuddin is well aware. Short in resources and low on confidence, the hosts seem to be a struggling lot at the moment. Top stars like Mahesh Gawli, K. Ajayan, S. Venkatesh and M. Suresh have already left due to injuries. 

N. S. Manju, another first team player, who got injured during practice on Monday, has also been ruled out by the doctors. Deepak Mondal and Micky Fernandes have been drafted in, but Nayeemuddin is certainly finding it difficult to pick his first eleven. 

Nayeems frustrations could be gauged from the manner in which he spoke about injured players. During our days, we used to carry on playing with such injuries. Our seniors used to say a footballer was never complete without a muscle or a ligament tear. Now, things have changed. Footballers these days prefer to sit out even though the injury is small. 

Realising that Nayeemuddins comments were too harsh, manager PK Banerjee tried his best to make amends. Its all part of the game. Football is important, but life is more important, obviously. Moreover, we have some good substitutes. 

Banerjee said Sanjeev Maria and Deepak Mondal are likely to start with Surkumar Singh and NP Pradeep in defence in the 4-4-2 formation. While Mehtab Hossain, Mehrajuddin Wadao and Micky are certainties in the midfield, the fourth choice could be a toss up between Manjit Singh and Dharamjit Singh. Syed Rahim Nabi and Bhaichung Bhutia will be in the upfront and Sandeep Nandy will guard the citadel. 

There were quite a few curious onlookers at the Ambedkar Stadium when both the teams were given 45 minutes each by the Lebanese match commissioner Mazen Ramadan to have a feel of the pitch. Indias practice lasted only for 15 minutes as their team bus was caught in a traffic jam and arrived almost an hour late. 

Yemens greatest moment in football came in 2003 when they qualified for the U-17 World Cup. Three players from the 2003 team are in the present squad, but Al-Alrae said he was in the process of building the side for Asian Games in December. 

On a normal day, Nayeemuddin would have loved to agree with Al-Alrae. But now his main battle is to survive till then. 

Meanwhile, All India Football Federation president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has announced a cash award of Rs 25,000 each if India manage to win the day.

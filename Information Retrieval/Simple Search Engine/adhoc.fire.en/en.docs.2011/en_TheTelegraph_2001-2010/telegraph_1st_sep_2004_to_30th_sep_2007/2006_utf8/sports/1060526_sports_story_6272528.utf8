The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A fast bowler has got to have an attitude

 - A Telegraph Special

 - Ian Bishop on the qualities a quick must have, and more... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Port-of-Spain: Right-arm quick Ian Bishop was set for bigger things when a stress fracture of the back interrupted and, then, ended his career. Despite fitness problems, he still played 43 Tests (161 wickets) and 84 ODIs (118 wickets). The 38-year-old Bishop, now part of the Media, spoke to The Telegraph on Thursday. It was exclusively about what he knows best. 

 The following are excerpts

 On the qualities a fast bowler 

 should have

 A willingness to bowl quick 

 and work hard... He has got to have an attitude... Athleticism, 

 stamina and explosiveness... He must also work towards being 

 an intelligent fast bowler... Its a package, really, 

 not one or two qualities... (After a pause) Recently, Makhaya 

 Ntini told me he would never back off, no matter how many 

 times a particular batsman smashed him for boundaries. Thats 

 attitude.

 On his idol

 (Laughs) All the West Indies 

 quicks of the late Seventies and early Eighties... Andy 

 Roberts, Michael Holding, Joel Garner, Colin Croft, Malcolm 

 Marshall... I remember my friends and I would often go to 

 the Queens Park Oval and imitate Holdings run-up, 

 Garners action and Crofts follow-through... 

 Their impact on our generation was huge... Roberts, too, 

 had a big influence as hed coached me when I was 16... 

 Hed come to Trinidad and I was fortunate to be in 

 the group he had sessions with. 

 On playing for Derbyshire 

 My first season was 1989 and I chose to go there 

 because Holding was still playing for the County... He guided 

 me and Im grateful for that. 

 On the premature end to his career 

 It ended because of a stress fracture... Owing 

 to my mixed action, partly side-on and partly open, my body 

 took a lot of stress in the early years... That proved harmful... 

 Nowadays, a lot more is known about the scientific side 

 of fast bowling and there are a lot more chest-on bowlers... 

 A lot more is also known about injury evaluation... Thanks 

 to the scientific studies, quicks can be advised to eliminate 

 much stress. 

 On the one Indian new ball bowler to have caught 

 his imagination 

 (Jawagal) Srinath... He had attitude... Following 

 on from Kapil Dev, he became a trend-setter... He wasnt 

 discouraged by Indian conditions and always wanted to run 

 in... You need to develop a method to bowl in certain conditions 

 and Srinath certainly did so... He could seam the ball in, 

 seam it away and had a sharp bouncer. I assume he learnt 

 a lot from Kapil, when he shared the dressing room with 

 him in the closing stages of his career. Srinath, I feel, 

 did well overseas as well because of his attitude. 

 On Indias new ball bowlers currently in the 

 West Indies (seniority-wise) 

 Ajit Agarkar: He 

 has a nice nippy action and while he isnt as sharp 

 as some years ago, he does have the ability to surprise 

 batsmen... He has been bowling well and its disappointing 

 that he hasnt been retained for the Test series. 

 Irfan Pathan: Hes 

 developing more into an allrounder... He doesnt have 

 the pace, but swings it in the right conditions... Pathans 

 showing variety, but needs to pitch a bit harder... Hes 

 interesting and should learn quite a bit by the time this 

 tour ends. 

 Rudra Pratap Singh: 

 Hes not lightning fast and didnt bowl well in 

 the only match (first ODI) Ive seen him bowl in person... 

 He has the advantage of youth but, right now, I wouldnt 

 like to say anything else. However, he must get stronger. 

 Sreesanth: I 

 like his look, though he doesnt seem a natural athlete... 

 Runs in aggressively and gets everything going towards the 

 target... He has it in him to swing the ball away at reasonable 

 pace and the fundamentals are right. Thats important.

 Munaf Patel: He 

 has been impressive... He may be ambling in, but hes 

 tall and hits the pitch hard... That he has a high-arm action 

 is a plus, but he isnt athletic enough ? not now, 

 at least. Hes going to be an asset because of a good 

 whippy arm and wrist. 

 On the most promising fast bowlers in the West Indies 

 Fidel Edwards, who can consistently bowl at 90 

 mph, and Jerome Taylor... Edwards is a genuine strike bowler, 

 while Taylor has a lot going for him ? good run-up, good 

 action and the ability to swing at a nippy pace. 

 On whether quicks should have an aggressive mind 

 set 

 They must know when to turn up the heat, when 

 to be aggressive... A fast bowler needs to have that killer 

 instinct, not that he has to swear at batsmen... Bottomline 

 is that he should know when to be aggressive and when clinical... 

 On the quicks he admired after himself becoming an 

 international cricketer 

 Curtly Ambrose, Allan Donald and, more recently, 

 Brett Lee... Ambrose was such a great athlete and had remarkable 

 control... Donald had a smooth action and generated so much 

 pace... His body language, too, was exceptional... He was 

 an emotional fast bowler... Lee, I believe, is becoming 

 a complete quick. 

 On tips for fast bowlers 

 Youve got to have the desire to bowl quick 

 and youve got to be able to work very hard... Youve 

 got to be willing to train when others have gone home, because 

 its pretty much an individual thing... Youll 

 be fine as long as you dont look for short-cuts... 

 (After a pause) Of course, youve also got to 

 be willing to learn. A cricketers education never 

 stops. 

 Lastly, on who is to blame for the menace of chucking 

 The coaches, at the school and club level... At 

 the provincial level... Im sure a lot of the bowlers 

 with suspect action have been bowling that way unknowingly... 

 When the problem reaches the international stage, then the 

 national bodies have to be blamed... Coaches at all levels 

 must not just look at short-term results, but show concern 

 for a bowlers career... If the clampdown is at the 

 highest level, then the national bodies have side-skirted 

 the problem... Havent done their duty.

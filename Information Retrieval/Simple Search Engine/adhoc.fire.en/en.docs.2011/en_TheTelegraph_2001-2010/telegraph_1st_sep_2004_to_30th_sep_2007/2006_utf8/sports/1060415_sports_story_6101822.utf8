 Owen boost for England before Germany

 - Striker undergoes first training session after injury

Englands World Cup plans were given a major boost on Thursday with the news that Michael Owen trained for the first time since he broke a bone in December. 

The England and Newcastle striker has been out of action since he suffered a fractured metatarsal following a collision with England teammate Paul Robinson in a Premier League match against Tottenham on New Years Eve. 

There were fears that Owen would not play again before England manager, Sven Goran Eriksson, has to name his final squad for the tournament on May 15. 

Those concerns grew late last month when Owen had to have a second operation on the injury. But the 25-year-old striker pulled on his boots for the first time on Thursday and Newcastle manager Glenn Roeder believes he will play again before the end of the Premiership season. 

He said: Its onwards and upwards for Michael. Im confident hell play for Newcastle before the end of the season. He did a very little bit of ball-work and after the session he was very happy. 

Meanwhile, the appointment of Erikssons successor could be delayed because of Middlesbrough manager Steve McClarens involvement in two cup semi-finals. 

Although the Football Association is close to making an appointment, they are anxious to avoid charges of destabilising the position of current club managers. 

Should McClaren emerge as the preferred candidate, the FA may decide to wait until after Middlesbroughs involvement in the Uefa Cup and FA Cup has been completed. 

That could frustrate one of his rivals, Charltons Alan Curbishley, who has again called for the decision to be made quickly. 

Curbishley said: They need to do something, probably the sooner the better. 

There is a lot of uncertainty and that is not right. The so-called people in the frame have all got jobs to do.

 Alonso vows to do better

 - I have less pressure this year 

London: Fernando Alonsos Formula One rivals can expect the world champion to be an even tougher opponent when the season starts in Bahrain next week. 

After the breakthrough of winning his first title, along with Renaults first constructors championship, the 24-year-old feels the pressure has lifted and now he can have fun trying to win every race. 

I want to be the best also in 2006, 2007, 2008 and whenever, he said last November when Renault presented him with his winning car. 

I always want to beat the competitors in everything I do, it doesnt matter whether its Formula One or tennis. 

Moving to McLaren at the end of the year, Alonso wants to hand Renault a bittersweet leaving present by defending his title and then joining their rivals as champion. 

He said in January that his confidence and motivation were the same as ever but maybe I have less pressure this year. 

Maybe last year I was a young driver with talent who needed to prove that he can win a championship, not only races. And now I am maybe more relaxed, added the sports youngest champion and Spains first. 

Alonso won seven times in 2005, the same number as McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, but he also drove tactically to bank points. He felt at the end of the season that given a free rein, he could have had a greater tally. 

I was maybe more conservative because I wanted to win the championship, said Alonso. This year I want to win the championship but Im not so stressed. 

While some people have wondered whether Renault may favour Italian Giancarlo Fisichella over the departing driver, the likelihood is that the team will want to show Alonso that he has made the wrong move. 

The Spaniard is convinced Renault will be even-handed and the new car has looked as quick as any in testing over the past month. I am 100 per cent confident in the Renault team... I will defend the No.1 and they will defend the constructors championship.

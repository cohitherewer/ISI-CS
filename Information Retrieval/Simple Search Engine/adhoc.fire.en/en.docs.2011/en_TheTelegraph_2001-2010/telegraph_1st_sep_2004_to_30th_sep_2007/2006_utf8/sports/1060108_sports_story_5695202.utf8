 Negi bows to Belov

 Negi finished with six points 

Hastings: International Master Parimarjan Negi went down fighting against top-seeded Grandmaster Vladimir Belov of Russia in the 10th and final round of the masters section of Hastings International Chess Congress at Hyde Park Sports Complex here. 

Having made his maiden Grandmasters norm after the nerve-racking penultimate round against GM Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine, 12-year-old Negi was taken to task by experienced Belov in the final round and the Russian eventually registered a smooth victory. 

GM Valerij Neverov of Ukraine expectedly claimed the title after a draw against Merab Gagunashvili of Georgia. 

Neverov scored eight points out of a possible 10 in the event and went home richer by ?2000 sterling after his fine performance. 

French IM Colin Vincent, GM Sergey Irenburg of Israel and Gagunashvili finished tied second on 7.5 points apiece. 

Negi finished with a tally of six points out of a possible 10 and emerged as the biggest gainer in terms of rating points as he stands to add a whopping 45 Elo points, which will see him way past the 2400 mark in the next Fide list. 

Playing black against Belov, Negi did not get many chances as Belov got an advantage right after a surprise choice of English opening.

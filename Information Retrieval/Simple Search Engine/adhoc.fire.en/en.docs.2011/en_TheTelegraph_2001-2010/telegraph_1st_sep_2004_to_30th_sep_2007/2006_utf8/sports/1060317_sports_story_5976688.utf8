 14-day judicial custody for fake journalist

Kharar: A Kharar sub-divisional court on Thursday remanded British national Rajiv Moolchandani, arrested for fraud and forgery after posing as a journalist during the Mohali Test, to 14-day judicial custody. Sub-divisional judicial magistrate Poonam Ratti directed the police to produce Moolchandani, also accused of indulging in cricket betting, once again before the court here on March 30. 

Seeking extension in police custody of the accused for ascertaining his links, J.S. Punn submitted before the court that the British national has been booked under various sections of the IPC, on the directions of Ropar SSP S.P. Singh. 

Before getting the case lodged, legal advice was taken from district attorney (legal). 

The prosecution contended that Moolchandani had entered the media box after getting accreditation from PCA.

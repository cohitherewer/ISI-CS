 Shoaib: We are cricketers, not doctors 

Karachi: Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has called on cricket authorities to impart more education to cricketers on doping and advised young sportsmen to be aware of contaminated food supplements. 

There must be proper education on doping for youngsters. We are cricketers, not doctors, said Akhtar who had a two-year ban lifted after a doping offence. Ever cricketer at some time has injury problems. I have had fitness problems and have used different legal remedies and supplements to recover. 

Unfortunately one of the supplements was contaminated with a banned steroid, he told reporters on the sidelines of a Patrons Trophy game, his first competitive match since his ban was revoked. 

We didnt know anything about supplements being sold over shelves having steroids and we paid for it. 

Akhtar and Mohmmed Asif were banned for two years and one year, respectively, after testing positive in October-November. 

Both appealed successfully against the bans, arguing that they had taken the substance inadvertently. (PTI)

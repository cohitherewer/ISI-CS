 Calcutta: Tuesdays violence in the Pakistan 

 capital, Islamabad, and premier city Lahore has had an effect 

 on Team India.

 Significantly, the protests (against European publications 

 which allowed cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammad) began 

 some hours after Rahul Dravid and Co. left Lahore for Multan. 

As the violence in Islamabad directly affected India ? a diplomats car was severely damaged and stones were hurled at the High Commission ? assistant manager Wng Cdr M. Baladitya received a call around 7.30 pm. 

The caller, Pankaj Tripathi, advised that all players and support staff be immediately directed not to move out of the hotel (Holiday Inn) this evening. 

 Nets are scheduled for tomorrow 

 (ahead of Thursdays fourth ODI), but a review is going 

 to be done? The High Commission will be advising us on what 

 other precautions need to be taken, Wng Cdr Baladitya 

 told The Telegraph. 

No emergent team meeting was called and the assistant manager himself conveyed Tripathis directive to everybody connected with Team India. 

The security arrangements have been excellent, but a stray incident can never be ruled out. Moreover, Multan is known to have a very strong fundamentalist presence. 

As on the last tour, Islamabad has deputed SSP Sohail Khan to coordinate Team Indias security with local officials. 

 The team, of course, is accompanied by a senior IPS 

 officer ? Ranbir Singh Krishnia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 If India are to do well, Chappell must play a big role

- Rahul Dravid's men have to get rid of their soft and laidback attitude 

Bodyline

Allan Doland

It is important that I begin with coach Greg Chappell and how central he would be for Indias plans in the forthcoming series. I might lose a few Indian friends in the process, but thats besides the point. The team must look more and more up to him to guide them through this tough tour.

 Chappell has got it in him to mentally prepare this Indian team for the aggression which would come from the South Africans. We all know his background and we all know how the Aussies think. Its in-built in him to be hard and tough. 

Lets accept it, despite a few notable wins abroad this decade, Indians have never been good travellers. They sometimes appear so soft and laidback that they get threatened by the aggressiveness of the Australians and South Africans. If the players do not get rid of that attitude, they are going to get a hiding wherever they go. 

That is why I feel Chappell has a big role to play. He knows all about being hard and tough. I think if he instils that attitude in the Indians, they can beat any side away from home. He could teach his men how they should never take a step backwards. 

I have been amused by all the criticism which has come his way and on his experiments. Knowing how the Australians think, I feel he has been trying to take a few of the Indians out of their comfort zone, those who were happy with how they were performing and not willing to go the extra mile. 

Chappells experiments must have been intended to make the cricketers think on their feet. The softness and the shyness of the Indians, looking from outside and looking in perhaps thats what he has been trying the Indians to get rid of. 

Giving this belief a logical extension, I feel it is important that the captain must buy into the coachs thinking. I have played under some of the very best captains and coaches of the world, and they all tended to lead from the front. Starting with Kepler Wessels and Hansie Cronje and knowing what influence Bob Woolmer had on all of us, I am saying this from experience. 

Even though Rahul Dravid has appeared a laidback sort of character to me, we South Africans rate him very, very highly. He is one guy we used to discuss in team meeting a lot because he always does well in South Africa. He just values his wicket so highly. So if thats Chappells plans, then Dravid must relay this to his team quickly. Theres little doubt this tour is going to be very tough for him. 

When we come from India, we always promise ourselves that they would find it a very different story in South Africa. I dont expect anything less this time around. I think South Africa would be very aggressive. I dont think they would prepare green pitches. The strips have been good, perhaps too good in the last four-five years. One thing South Africa might like to ensure is that pitches are not too perfect and right up Indias street. 

They would be very aggressive but its how they channel that aggression which would be important. They must learn to be patient. I think the South African bowling, in the last year and a half, has not shown that kind of patience. Sometimes the skill factor has also let them down. They have depended too heavily and hard on Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini. 

As for Indian bowlers, they all can swing the ball and thats going to be a test for the South Africans. I am not so sure about Zaheer Khan at the moment, as he still looks to be trying to find his feet. He is certainly not the Zaheer Khan I know. Still, he has got great control and he swings it late. 

Sreesanth has got lovely action, and he looks a hungry cricketer, a cricketer who could go a long way. He seems to enjoy his cricket and appears very nice and uncomplicated. He has an injury-free action and I am very impressed by him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Powell equals world record

 Gateshead: Jamaican Asafa Powell equalled the 

 mens 100 metres world record with a time of 9.77 seconds 

 at a Grand Prix meeting on Sunday. 

 Powell set the world best in Athens in June 2005 which 

 was matched by American Olympic and world champion Justin 

 Gatlin in Doha on May 12 this year. I came out here 

 to show them Im back to where I started last year 

 and Im going to pick up this season from now on, 

 Powell said. 

He added: As I said, I can run as fast as I want when I want. I told them I would do my best here and I didnt let them down. 

My coach is not all that happy because in the end I didnt do what he told me to do but I am going to work on that and come back. 

Powell and co-record holder Gatlin are due to race against each other in London on July 28. 

 The pairs last clash on 

 the track was in London in July 2005 when Powell pulled 

 up with a groin problem that ended his season. After easing 

 through his heat on Sunday, Powell got a great start in 

 the final and was never troubled, finishing well clear of 

 compatriot Michael Frater in 10.06.

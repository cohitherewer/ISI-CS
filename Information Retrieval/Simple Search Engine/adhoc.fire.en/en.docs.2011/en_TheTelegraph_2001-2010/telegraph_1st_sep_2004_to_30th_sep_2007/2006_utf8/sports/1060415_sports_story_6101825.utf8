Beijing: Rahil Gangjee continued to fly high on the second day while Shiv Kapur and Gaurav Ghei missed the cut at the $1.8 million Volvo China Open Golf Championship here on Friday. 

Gangjee devoured the par-fives with a birdie on each of the four to keep in touch with the leaders with a two-under 70 at the Hong Hua International Golf Club. 

The 27-year-old Calcuttan was on top of the leaderboard at eight-under, when he was hit by an ugly double bogey and had to settle for an overall six-under 138, at tied fifth spot. 

Briton David Lynn brushed off a delicate groin injury to shoot a second-round 67 and take the halfway lead. 

Lynn hit nine birdies to go nine-under-par, a shot ahead of Zimbabwes Marc Cayeux, Portugals Jose-Filipe Lima and Thai Prayad Marksaeng, who shared second place at seven-under 137. 

The 32-year-old Englishman, who started at the 10th, would have been further ahead had he not found the water on his ninth hole and then dropped a shot putting out at the end of his round.I made nine birdies today and that was really the backbone of the round. I made a bad mistake on 18 coming in there. But basically, the game was steady, Lynn told reporters. 

He also revealed he had a festering insect bite removed from his groin at the course on Thursday. 

Kapur (73) and Ghei (76) were two of the six Indians to miss the halfway cut. 

Kapur was done in by a bogey at the 18th, where he missed a 10-footer and where a par would have got him in at one-over. Jeev Milkha Singh (69) struck a purple patch between 10th and 14th for which he was five-under and came back with a 69, despite a bogey on 17th. He was lying tied 21st. 

Harmeet Kahlon (67) carded his best round and the first one in the 60s for the 2006 season to make only his second cut of the year at one-under 143. 

Meanwhile, Amandeep Johl endured an agonising wait before getting in after a 70 as Dutchman Robert Jan-Derksen playing in the third-last flight double bogeyed the 18th, a hole which proved to be the nemesis for many on Friday.

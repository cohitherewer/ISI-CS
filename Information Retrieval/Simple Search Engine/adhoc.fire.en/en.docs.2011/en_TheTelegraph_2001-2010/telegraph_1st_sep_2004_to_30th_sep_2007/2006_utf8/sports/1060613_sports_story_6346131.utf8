Stuttgart: Zinedine Zidane and company will start finding out whether they are still young enough to dream when France face Switzerland in their World Cup opener on Tuesday. 

The 34-year-old midfielder and a few other ageing players from the teams triumphs at the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship will retire after the finals in Germany and would love to do so on a high note. Several members of that golden generation, including Zidane, Lilian Thuram and Patrick Vieira, have looked rusty in warm-up games. 

They must now step up a gear at the Gottlieb Daimler Stadion, Switzerland being Frances toughest opponents in Group G which also features South Korea and Togo. 

Switzerland, much improved in the past few years, showed they should not be taken lightly when they held France to two draws in World Cup qualifying. 

When we play against France we could play them 10 times and perhaps win twice, so we have to hope one of those wins will come on Tuesday, said Swiss coach Koebi Kuhn. 

We have a young, hungry side that wants to show something. 

A lot has been made in the Swiss camp of the fact that France striker Thierry Henry missed their last two meetings through injuries. 

He (Henry) is one of the best strikers in the world, if not the best, and I see his inclusion as an important difference to the two qualifying matches, said Kuhn, who was hoping defender Philippe Senderos could tame his Arsenal teammate. 

Frances build up was smooth until striker Djibril Cisse broke his right leg in their final friendly, a 3-1 win over China in St Etienne. 

We feel hes still with us, said midfielder Claude Makelele. Well try to go as far as we can and he will get there with us, in a way. 

The France players said there was a good atmosphere in the team, unlike 2002. Internal squabbling marred their run then and the champions were eliminated without a win or a goal from the group stage. 

We are all aware we made mistakes in 2002 and we will not repeat them, said Makelele. 

We were all worn out then and that played an important role. Were a lot fresher this time and we want to go all the way. Thats the goal, to lift that trophy. 

Switzerland coach Kuhn is hoping that the hot weather forecast for Tuesdays match against France will work in favour of his young side. 

Highs of up to 33 degrees centigrade are anticipated for the two teams opening World Cup match, which could benefit Switzerland against a more experienced but also much older French team here in Stuttgart. 

I dont know whether age or youth will play a special role in dealing with the heat, but I certainly hope so, Kuhn told reporters after arriving with his team on Monday. 

If it does help us get a result, then we will remember to direct our thanks to the sun god! 

Aside from the pre-tournament axing of injured striker Johan Vonlanthen, Kuhn said that Swiss preparations had been nearly perfect and that his side were ready to end a 15-year wait for victory over their westerly neighbours.

New Delhi: An Olympic gold is still a dream for Manavjit Singh Sandhu. However, the trap shooter who won gold at the World Championships in Zagreb recently, feels the world stage is a tougher test than the Olympics. 

It is tough to compare between the Olympics and the World Championships, Manavjit said during a press conference on Thursday. True the Olympic Games are more glamorous than any other meet in the world. But, winning a gold at the World Championships is perhaps a more difficult job. It is definitely the strongest field of any meet with 150 best shooters in the world vying for the top honour. It was a strenuous task there. 

After a series of successes at the international level, Manavjit said an Indian winning an Olympic gold is just round the corner and he wont be surprised to find even himself on the podium two years later in Beijing. 

If I can win a gold in the World Championships, I can do it at the Olympics, too, he said. Only thing is that I have to remain focussed, to keep doing the hard work and have the right kind of luck to clinch the gold. Like any sport, in shooting too, luck plays a role too. 

When Manavjit says his sights are set on the next Olympics gold, one tends to believe him. The results in the last 18 months when he made the finals of all the major international meets speaks for him. 

It is not that Manavjit is the first Indian to excel in this particular event. India has a rich tradition in trap shooting, but Manavjit has overshadowed his predecessors by his Zagreb showings. So far, Karni Singhs silver medal in the 1962 world meet was the best-ever by an Indian, followed by Randhir Singhs tryst with gold in the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok. 

In recent past, Mansher Singh was in the limelight for his good showing. Moraad Ali Khan, Anwar Sultan and Zorawar Sandhu also kept Indias trap shooting tradition alive. But Manavjit, under Italian coach Marcelo Dradi, is, by far, the countrys best ever in his department. 

Manavjit will leave for Italy in a few days to train under his personal coach. Italy, after all, is the home of trap shooting. I will train there for 20 days before coming back temporarily, he said. Dradi has taught me the nuances of the game.

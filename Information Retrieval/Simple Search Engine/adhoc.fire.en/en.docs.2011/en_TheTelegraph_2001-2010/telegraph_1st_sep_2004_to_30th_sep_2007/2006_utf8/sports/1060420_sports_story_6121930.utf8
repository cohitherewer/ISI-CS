Abu Dhabi: Inzamam-ul Haq praised his bowlers for setting up an emphatic win in the first ODI versus India on Tuesday night (as reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

The bowlers performed very well, in fact the pacers have been performing consistently over the past couple of months, said the skipper, who made 40. 

Inzamam credited the teams fine record against India at neutral venues to crowd support. There is lot of crowd support for us, the atmosphere is exhilarating. Our record shows that we have been playing really well. 

Inzamam said it had not been easy to get runs on Tuesday and chasing even a modest total could have been tricky. 

The captain said Mohammed Asif was emerging as a key player in the lead-up to the World Cup but added that it was too early to compare him to Glenn McGrath. 

What is important for the team in the lead-up to the World Cup is that all players should be fit and performing. Any team can then win. We are hoping that Asif will continue to perform till the World Cup. 

He is a very good bowler, but we should give him some time before starting to compare him with McGrath. 

The Multan batsman was all for more Indo-Pak matches. 

If we play more matches, the level of tension comes down. The fans get used to such encounters, the pressure also reduces. 

Players get to know each other better and feel closer to one another. More matches would help in improving relations between the teams, Inzamam observed. 

Inzamams deputy Younis Khan, who scored a matchwinning unbeaten 71 on Tuesday, revealed he does not have to try too hard to get out of a lean patch: he just needs a game against India to start firing again. 

A prolific scorer against india, Younis said he had always been very comfortable playing against the team from across the border. 

It is just that I try my best against India. Whenever I am out of form, I get runs if I play against India. 

Younis did not think conditions were difficult for batting. International cricketers must know how to adapt to different conditions quickly, he said. 

Meanwhile, Tuesdays game marked umpire Rudi Koertzens 150th ODI. The 57-year-old South African thus became only the second man, after Englands now-retired David Shepherd, to stand in 150 ODIs. 

When I started umpiring in 1981, I did it just to be involved with the game I love and never dreamt I would reach this stage, Koertzen said. (PTI)

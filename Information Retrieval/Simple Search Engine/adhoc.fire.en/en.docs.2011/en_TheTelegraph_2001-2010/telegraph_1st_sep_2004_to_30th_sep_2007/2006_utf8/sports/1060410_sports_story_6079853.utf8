 Raju, Tejinder get life ban

 Weightlifting

 New Delhi: Weightlifters 

 Edwin Raju and Tejinder Singh, who tested positive at the 

 recent Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, were slapped by 

 life bans by the Indian Weightlifting Federation on Sunday.

 The IWF also suspended for two 

 years women lifters Shailaja Pujari and B. Prameelavalli 

 who returned positive in an out of competition test by Wada. 

 Raju and Tejinder will also have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000 

 each, the IWF announced after its executive committee meeting 

 on Sunday.

 The ban will come into effect 

 after the verdict of Court of Arbitration for Sports 

 which is hearing their case, IWF president H. J. Dora said. 

 The decision was taken in accordance with the anti-doping 

 rules adopted by the national body in September 2004, 

 he said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its unfortunate Sachin wont be around: Dravid 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sachin

Basseterre (St Kitts): Almost 18 hours after the Sachin Tendulkar development, Team India captain Rahul Dravid wasnt sure whether the maestro would miss only the first of four Tests or the entire series. Coach Greg Chappell, though, had (unofficially) got an update much earlier and even gave his reaction to The Telegraph. 

The following are excerpts from what Dravid and West Indies captain Brian Lara had to say about Sachin after Tuesdays ODI here: 

DRAVID: Id thought it would be touch-and-go for the first Test (in Antigua, from June 2)... Didnt know hes out for the full series... Its unfortunate that Sachin wont be around, but it will give an opportunity to a youngster... Experience is handy but, then, somebody is going to get the chance... 

 LARA: 

 Its disappointing... Were all 

 entertainers and Sachins absence is a big loss for 

 the Caribbean people... My team and I respect him a great 

 deal and we would have liked to play against the best (Indian) 

 team... My advice to Sachin is get fit as soon as 

 possible... Of course, I dont know when well 

 be playing each other next...

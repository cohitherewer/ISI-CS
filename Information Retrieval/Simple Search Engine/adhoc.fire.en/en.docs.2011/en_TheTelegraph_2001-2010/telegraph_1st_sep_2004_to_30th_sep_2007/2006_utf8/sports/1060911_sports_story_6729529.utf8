 271-run win for India

 - U-19 TEST vs PAK 

 Chawla claimed four for 50 

Rawalpindi: The Indian under-19 boys posted a huge 271-run victory against Pakistan colts after breaking the dogged resistance of the tailenders in the first four-day Test in Rawalpindi on Sunday. 

Some dour batting by the late order Pakistani batsmen raised the hosts hopes of saving the match but pacer Vijaykumar Yo Mahesh picked four for 44 and leg-spinner Piyush Chawla, who had picked three wickets in the first innings, claimed four for 50 to set up the win for India. 

Resuming at 63 for five this morning, the overnight pair of Imad Wasim and Behram Khan were separated only after lunch as they batted ultra defensively to save the game after being set an imposing 446 runs for victory on the third day. 

Wasim scored 35 from 249 balls and Behram faced 113 balls for his 18 runs. 

Abdul Rauf also scored a stubborn 36 from 100 balls to before Pakistan were bowled out in 75.4 overs on the final day of the match. 

Sunil Raju, who had taken three wickets in the first innings, and Ravindra Jadeja picked one wicket each. 

India, batting first, had scored 289 while Pakistan were bowled out for 147. In their second innings, India declared on 303 for six with opener Cheteshwar Pujara scoring 85 runs. 

The two teams will now play the second Test in Peshawar from September 13 followed by four one-day games. (PTI)

 Furyk in lead

Poipu Beach: Jim Furyk shot a 5-under 67 Tuesday for a one-stroke lead over US Open champion Geoff Ogilvy after the opening round of the PGA Grand Slam of Golf. 

Defending champion Tiger Woods, who has won the exclusive four-man event a record six straight times in seven appearances, struggled off the tee and scrambled to a 70. Woods is coming off a spectacular eight-win season, including victories at the British Open and PGA Championship while finishing atop the money list with nearly $10 million (euro7.8 million).

 Chanderpaul quits as Windies captain

London: Shivnarine Chanderpaul has resigned as the West Indies captain after just one year in the job, the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) said on Tuesday. 

The 31-year-old left-hander, who succeeded Brian Lara as skipper, led the side to just one win in 14 Tests and two victories in 16 one-day Internationals. 

I would like to take this opportunity to tender my resignation as captain with immediate effect, Chanderpaul wrote in a letter to the WICB. 

This would give me an opportunity to focus on my batting and other areas of my cricket where I would be able to make a more significant contribution to the team. 

I have served my time as the captain and would like to pass the mantle on to another person. I would fully support my replacement, and work towards the good of the team. 

I would like to thank all who worked with me during my tenure as captain, and I am looking forward to continuing my hard work for West Indies cricket. 

Chanderpaul has played 94 Tests and 183 one-day Internationals since making his West Indies debut in 1994. 

Vice-captain Ramnaresh Sarwan is favourite to lead the side in home series against Zimbabwe and India starting later this month.

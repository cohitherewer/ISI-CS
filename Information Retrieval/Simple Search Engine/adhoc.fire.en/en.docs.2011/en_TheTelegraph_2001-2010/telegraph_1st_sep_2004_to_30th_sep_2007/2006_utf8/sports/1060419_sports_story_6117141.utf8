The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It was difficult this time: Surya 

Visakhapatnam: Its not a new experience for Surya Sekhar Ganguly, but the Petroleum Sports Promotion Board player admitted that winning the national title was indeed a difficult proposition this time. 

It has been a difficult one this time, said Surya, who not only needed to win his last round game against S. Kidambi, but was also aided by Deepan Chakravarthys loss. 

Surya said he had risked his prospects to be in the Indian team for Chess Olympiad after his penultimate round loss against GM Abhijit Kunte and was feeling dejected as the team needed him as much as he wanted to be in it. 

I was feeling dejected and irresponsible as I had risked my participation in the Olympiad also with that loss. I think as much as I want to be in the team, the team also needs me, he said. 

It is always difficult to win a one-off game but I had prepared till after midnight on Monday to play against Kidambi, I knew he will play this variation in the Grunfeld which is extremely unclear and I had found a new idea while analysing, Surya Sekhar said. 

The Calcuttan was all praise for Diwakar Prasad Singh, who finished third. 

 Just true concentration, absolute devotion in his own game and we can see that without any formal training, one can play equally well. He will have to work hard for the Olympiad though, but this guy is good, Dhoni of Indian chess, said the IOC employee. (PTI)

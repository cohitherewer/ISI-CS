 Ukraine make second round

Berlin: Andriy Shevchenko scored from the penalty spot in the 70th minute Friday to give Ukraine a 1-0 win over Tunisia and a spot in the second round of the World Cup. 

Shevchenko scored his second goal of the tournament after he was knocked down while running between Tunisia goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel and defender Karim Hagui. 

The win was enough to give Ukraine second place in Group H behind Spain. Ukraine is the first former-Soviet republic to advance to the second round of the World Cup. 

Tunisia finished the match with 10 men after striker Ziad Jaziri was sent off in the last minute of the first half. Ukraine joins Ghana as the only two of the six newcomers in Germany to reach the second round.

 Pure Valour wins, jockey fined 

Horses for Dubai 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Gajender Singh partnered Daniel Davids less-fancied ward, Pure Valour, to victory in the Gavin Johnston Cup on Friday. The apprentice was, however, lucky to have retained the prize following an objection lodged by the rider of the fourth-placed horse Ciraja, a Robin Corner-trainee. While making his move inside the last furlong, the shifting out winner not only took Cirajas ground, he also knocked the horse out of his stride. Gajender escaped with a fine of Rs 10,000.RESULTS

 AIFF gears up for nine-team affair

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: With Fransa Pax out of the equation, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has chalked out a nine-team tentative draw for the second phase of the National Football League (NFL). Officially, however, the AIFF has written to Fransa asking them to inform by Monday if the club has actually been disbanded. 

The AIFF letter has referred to newspaper reports and indicated that it would wait till Monday before deciding on the next course of action. 

As expected, Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco has decided to ignore the letter. The AIFF does not exist for us. Why should we correspond with them? the Fransa chairman argued. 

A few Fransa players have already received calls from other clubs. While captain Cressan Antao has sealed a deal with Dempo, Peter Carvalho is also being pursued by the defending champions. 

Salgaocar have shown interest in winger Marcus Peixoto and midfielder Godwin Franco. 

Brazilian striker Ivan da Silva and Nigerian Bello Rasaq are both leaving for home, while the Goa Football Association has offered goalkeeper Virender Singh to rejoin them as goalkeepers coach. 

Meanwhile, N.P. Pradeep is likely to lead the Indian squad for the AFC Challenge Cup in Dhaka. The squad is currently in the capital to play a couple of practice matches.

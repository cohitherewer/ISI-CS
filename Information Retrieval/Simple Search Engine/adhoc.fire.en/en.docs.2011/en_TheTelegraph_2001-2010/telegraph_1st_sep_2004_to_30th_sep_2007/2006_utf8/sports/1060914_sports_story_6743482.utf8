 More denial 

Vadodara: A day after stirring up a controversy with his remarks, outgoing selection committee chairman Kiran More on Wednesday denied having said that the selection system was biased. 

More said he had only referred to an incident when three of the selectors had come to the meeting with an agenda. I never used the word biased. I only mentioned about that incident. I did not take any names, More said. 

In fact, the selection process is good, More added.

 WI legend Clyde Walcott no more

 - He hit the ball harder than any of us, says Weekes 

 Walcott 

Bridgetown: Clyde Walcott, a West Indies cricket legend and the first non-British chairman of the ICC, died on Saturday at a hospital, his wife Muriel said. 

The cause of death was not immediately known. 

He was 80 and is survived by his wife and son, Michael. Another son, Ian, died earlier. 

Walcott, a Barbados native known for his powerful batting, was part of the famed Three Ws in the 1950s, along with Frank Worrell and Everton Weekes. 

Clyde had a powerful physique and his batting was based on power and strength. He hit the ball harder than any of us, said Weekes, now the only surviving member of the Three Ws. 

He was a true friend and a great man. I always enjoyed batting with him, and we had some great times together on and off the field. He was a pretty quiet person but would always find time to talk to you and find out what was going on, recalled Weekes. 

Former paceman Michael Holding also paid rich tributes. 

On my first tour of England in 1976, he was my manager, Holding told a website. He helped me a lot early in my career. I can give you one example of what Clyde was like. 

On that tour wed played against Hampshire and I wasnt very happy. I didnt have the best equipment for Engish conditions, my studs were too short, and I was feeling sorry for myself. 

Clyde could see this because as I sat at the back of the coach all on my own, he came and sat down next to me, just to have a chat. 

After Id told him the problem he suggested I talk to some of the County pros and find out about how to get some new equipment. That was Clyde, he wouldnt wait for you to ask him, he would approach you and try to help, revealed Holding. 

Walcott was a fine right-handed batsman, steady medium-pacer and an occasional wicketkeeper. He scored 3,788 runs, with 15 centuries, in 44 Tests for the West Indies between 1948 and 60. His average of 56.68 is 15th in the all-time batting rankings. 

Walcott kept wicket in 15 Tests before back problems forced him to give it up. (Agencies)

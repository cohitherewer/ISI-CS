Karachi: If the positives from this tour are to be counted, there will be many. But on batsman-friendly pitches, the standout performers have been Irfan Pathan and Rudra Pratap Singh. 

While Pathans adaptability to the allround role Greg Chappell wants him to play has been re-established, Rudra Prataps emergence as a strike bowler can only be welcome news for India. 

The start wasnt all that good for Indias pace bowling pair in Pakistan, but as the tour progressed, they made sure that their shortcomings were overshadowed by their success. 

Pathan feels this has been the biggest series in his career, but for Rudra Pratap, this is just the beginning. 

In three Tests, Pathan claimed eight wickets, while Rudra Pratap bagged nine from two matches. In the one-dayers, Pathan ended up with nine scalps from four games and Rudra Pratap seven from two. 

Winning the Man of the Match award in the Faisalabad Test gave me the confidence. That will be my best performance on the tour. The success in Multan was satisfying. I took the coachs advice and always tried to bowl in the channel, Rudra Pratap told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Greg Chappells suggestions helped co-ordinate my mind and body. I would like to dedicate this success to my coaches in formative years, Deepak Sharma and S.P. Krishnan. 

Rudra Pratap, though, is keeping a cool head. I dont want to be distracted. Theres still a long way to go? Ive always tried to keep a cool head and focus on the basics. Too much of experimentation in these sort of surfaces doesnt always help. Key is to maintain consistency. 

The Uttar Pradesh pacer is well aware of the task in hand. We play England next at home. The pressure element is always going to be there, and the best way to handle it is to block it from getting to your head. I just concentrate on improving my bowling every day and not worry about the results, he explained. 

For Pathan, getting a hattrick in the final Test at the National Stadium here will always remain special. 

It happened so fast that it still seems a dream. The hattrick ball that dismissed Mohammed Yousuf will remain my best memory on this tour, Pathan said. 

 Even when the going was tough on this tour, I stayed positive and focused on my limitations. The key was to stay mentally strong? I knew I would achieve success. 

I didnt speak to anyone else except Chappell and the support staff. Their guidance has been of great help... Constantly spoke to the coach and analysed video clippings. 

I achieved more success in one-dayers mainly because I could focus bowling on the right areas and not try out too many things. Sometimes trying too many variations doesnt help? Pace has never been a big factor to me as what counts in the end is the number of wickets. That way I see myself as successful, Pathan said. 

Pathan still doesnt want to give much importance to his batting. I dont want to bother too much about my batting. I go out there and bat with a free mind. That may be one of the reasons for my success. Its for you guys to decide if you want to term me as an allrounder? I only see myself as a bowling allrounder. 

The overall show has left him satisfied. In a long tour, there are going to be ups and downs. But my performance has been pretty good. This is my biggest series so far? It will take me a long way in my career, he said.

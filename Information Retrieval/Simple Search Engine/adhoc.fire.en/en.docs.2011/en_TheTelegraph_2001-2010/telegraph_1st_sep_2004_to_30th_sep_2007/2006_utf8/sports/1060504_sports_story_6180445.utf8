The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im expecting a big fight again, 

 says Alonso

 European Grand Prix

 London: The Formula One 

 season moves to Germany for the European Grand Prix at the 

 Nuerburgring this weekend where world champion Fernando 

 Alonso regards McLarens Kimi Raikkonen as a bigger 

 threat than Michael Schumacher.

 Fresh from his first win in 13 

 races, Ferraris Schumacher can count on plenty of 

 support from his home German fans at the circuit nestling 

 among the forests of the Eifel hills.

 It is also a home track for McLarens 

 engine partners Mercedes, who are hungry for the teams 

 first win of the campaign in the fifth round of the 18-race 

 season.

 I am expecting a big fight 

 again, said 24-year-old Alonso, who has two wins and 

 two second places in his Renault from the seasons 

 opening races and a 15-point advantage over seven-time champion 

 Schumacher.

 The level of competition 

 is much closer than the championship standings suggest and 

 there will be some big challengers.

 McLaren have the same Michelin 

 tyres as championship leaders Renault, who expect the French 

 manufacturer to get the better of Ferraris partners 

 Bridgestone in what could be a cold and wet fifth race of 

 the season.

 The Michelin tyres have 

 performed very consistently at every circuit this year and 

 they have done a great job, the Spaniard added.

 It will be the same in Germany, 

 I am sure, so we will see a big push from McLaren-Mercedes 

 at their home race, running on the same Michelin tyres as 

 us.

 Raikkonen, winner of seven races 

 in 2005, has a record of three retirements in the last three 

 years at the Nuerburgring but that does not tell the real 

 story.

 The Finn would have won last year, 

 had he not flat-spotted a tyre and suffered suspension failure 

 on the last lap while leading Alonso, and was in a race 

 of his own in 2003 until his engine blew up. His engine 

 also failed in 2004.

 I am hoping to have a less 

 dramatic race this year, Raikkonen said. (Reuters)

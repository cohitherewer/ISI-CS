Calcutta: Mohammedan Sportings dream run in the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup came to a halt at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. 

They lost 0-2 to Dempo, both goals scored by prolific Nigerian Ranty Martins. After six games, Mohammedan Sporting thus remained on 10 points while the defending champions first win in the competition pushed them to six points. 

But these are mere facts, and shouldnt hide the underlying implications of the result in any post-match analysis. Having recovered from their first-match blues to an unbeaten four-match streak ? the likes of which they hadnt achieved in any tournament of late ? Mohammedan Sporting have now crashed to reality. 

One must not also forget that injuries have already started taking toll on the team. Goalkeeper Gopal Das and striker Patrick Okonji have so long been the inspiration behind the black-and-white brigades extraordinary phase (three wins and a draw). Both got hurt on Friday, with Patrick even suffering a partial blackout and Gopal limping under the bar towards the end of second half. 

Minutes before full time, the Nigerian went for an aerial challenge with Dempo defender John Dias and fell to the ground having been elbowed on the back of his head. He suffered a blackout but the scan didnt reveal any fracture. He will have to take a few painkillers and should be okay within 24 hours, said Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, who heads IFAs medical unit. 

David Mkandwire, a livewire in defence, can also be a case in point. He has a tear on the right thigh and has been advised a fortnights rest. But he was forced to take field on Friday and the worst happened in the 43rd minute. His pain resurfaced and within minutes, disaster struck Mohammedan Sporting in the form of Martins second goal. 

Dempo, on the other hand, looked rejuvenated and determined to keep the past behind them. 

We badly needed a win. Everybody in the team was charged up and was looking for a turnaround before it affected our self-belief. Now youll see a new-look Dempo, coach Armando Colaco said later. 

An injured David was exposed in the 24th minute when he wasnt just up to the challenge to tackle Majek Bolaji who received a Dias cross from the left. Bolaji chested the ball forward for Martins to score with a powerful strike. 

Two minutes after Davids painful exit from the field, Martins found himself clear following a clearance from the Dempo box. Madhab Das was easily outsprinted as the Nigerian started his run from the centre of the park and glided the ball past an advancing Gopal.

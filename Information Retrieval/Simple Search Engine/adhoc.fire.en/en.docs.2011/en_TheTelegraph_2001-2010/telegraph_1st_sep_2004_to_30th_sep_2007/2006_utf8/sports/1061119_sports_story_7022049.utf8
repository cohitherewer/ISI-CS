The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mhambrey stresses on consistency

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Coach Paras Mhambrey is drawing strength from Bengals inspired performance last year when they finished runners-up in Ranji Trophy. 

Were looking forward to the new season with enthusiasm Its important to be consistent. We want to do a repeat (of last year) while trying to win the trophies that have eluded us, Mhambrey told The Telegraph after the teams final practice session on Saturday. 

Sourav, who was out of the city, wasnt present. Bengal start their campaign against Punjab in Mohali Thursday. The squad leaves Monday. 

Mhambrey is not worried about the hard and bouncy Mohali wicket. We have enough depth in the batting order to counter such things. 

Wont Shib Shankar Pauls absence throw the teams plans out of gear? Injuries are part of the game. You cannot do anything about it. Ashok Dinda used the opportunity and performed in the Duleep Trophy. There will be Ranadeb Bose and Sourav, too. I dont think Pauls absence will be a handicap.

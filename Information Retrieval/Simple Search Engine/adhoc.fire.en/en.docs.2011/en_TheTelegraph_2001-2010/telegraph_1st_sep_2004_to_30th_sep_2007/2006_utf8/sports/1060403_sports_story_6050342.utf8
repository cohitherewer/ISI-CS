 Morale-boosting win for Boro

London: Middlesbrough enjoyed a morale-boosting 1-0 win at Manchester City with a first-half winner from Lee Cattermole in the Premier League on Sunday. 

Steve McClarens team, who will attempt to overturn a 2-0 deficit in the their Uefa Cup second-leg quarter final at home to Basel on Thursday, deservedly took the points when midfielder Cattermole headed in a Stewart Downing cross after 42 minutes. 

It was the 18-year-olds first goal at senior level. 

The victory lifted Middlesbrough level on 40 points with 13th-placed City, who barely produced a noteworthy effort on goal and drew a withering blast from manager Stuart Pearce. 

The players and myself were an absolute disgrace this afternoon, an embarrassment to this football club, Pearce said. Ive had a chat with the boys afterwards, and Ive said I would be embarrassed to go home and talk to my family and look my little kids in the eye having put that performance on. We were so spineless it was frightening. 

In Sundays other match, former England striker Teddy Sheringham drew a blank on his 40th birthday in West Ham Uniteds 0-0 draw with London rivals Charlton Athletic at Upton Park. 

Sheringham, who came on at halftime, was denied a late winner when Charlton keeper Thomas Myhre instinctively pushed out his close range shot. 

The draw did little for either teams hopes of qualifying for European competition via the league next season, although both teams are still in the FA Cup. 

West Ham moved up one place to eighth on 46 points, two points behind seventh-placed Bolton Wanderers who have two games in hand. Charlton are 11th on 43 points.

 Randhawa, Chowrasia forced into 2nd play-off 

 - Indian Open extends to fifth day for the first time 

 S.S.P. Chowrasia 

 and Jyoti Randhawa 

New Delhi: The Hero Honda Indian Open, for the first time, will go into the fifth day, as Jyoti Randhawa and SSP Chowrasia play their second play-off to decide who will be the 2006 champion. 

After an exciting drama, the game produced a three-way play-off with Randhawa, Chowrasia and Vijay Kumar all ending at 18-under for 72 holes and tying for the record total for the championship. 

In the first play-off hole, Vijay played himself out as he went into the right bushes and could not find the ball. That left Randhawa and Chowrasia, who after a lot of drama parred the 18th, still in the fray. 

Vijay will tie for second with the loser of the play-off, while Simon Dyson (68) was sole fourth at 17-under 271 and Mukesh Kumar (72) was tied fifth at 276 with Prom Meesawat. 

Gaurav Ghei (73) was tied seventh with Unho Park (73) and Suk Jong Ryul (69) and amateur Chiragh Kumar (67) tied for tenth with Scott Strange (72) at nine-under. Rahil Gangjee (74) was tied 12th. 

In the final regulation hole, Chowrasia was tied with Vijay, the clubhouse leader at 18-under and then had a 15-footer for birdie. But he missed. Randhawa birdied the 18th and joined in the three-way play-off. 

In the play-off, Chowrasias second shot went to the right bushes from the middle of the fairway and he then played a brilliant shot to give himself a 12-foot chance for birdie. 

In the meantime, Randhawa reached the green in three and had a four-footer for birdie. Chowrasia missed his 12-footer, leaving Randhawa to putt from four feet to win. The normally steady Randhawa, too missed, forcing a second play-off. 

Vijay (66) played one of the finest front nines this course has seen with a five-under 31 and a round of six-under as he made up a four-shot deficit over Randhawa, who willed himself more than once to keep afloat. 

Chowrasia, after seeming to put himself out of the picture during the first 14 holes, where he struggled, found his putter doing his bidding with three birdies in a row. 

Four behind at the start of the day, Vijay made the great charge on the front nine with six birdies in the first eight holes including four in a row from third to sixth. 

He nearly aced the par-3 seventh hole, when his tee shot hit the flag on the fly and bounced off. He then needed two putts for the par. His first blemish came on the ninth, where he found the jungle. 

Randhawa opened the morning in style with back to back birdies that took him to 18-under and two clear of Chowrasia, who also birdied the first. 

Soon after Randhawa birdied the second, the skies became overcast. Threat of lightning forced suspension of play for 45 minutes. Once play resumed, Randhawa seemed to have lost his touch. 

On the short fifth, he went into he right bushes but was lucky to have a shot and he came out with a bogey. He bogeyed again on seventh and dropped to 16-under. 

Vijay, playing one group ahead, was on a birdie spree and birdied the eighth. He was suddenly 17-under and in sole lead. 

The twist continued as Vijay bogeyed the ninth and Randhawa birdied the eighth and they were once again tied at 17-under with Dyson and Chowrasia at 15-under. 

Chowrasia had a birdie on first and then found it difficult to get any more. He dropped a shot on sixth and then saved a good par on eighth. 

The drama continued into the back nine as the battle hotted up. There was a time when Randhawa seemed to have it wrapped. Coming into the 16th, he was 18-under with Vijay behind. 

Randhawas chip from the edge on the 16th almost rolled in for a birdie, which would have put him 19-under. Then he pulled his par putt and ended with a bogey that opened a window. 

Seconds later, Chowrasia, in the same group as Randhawa, added a second successive birdie on the 16th to come to 17-under and it was three Indians sharing lead. 

On the 18th, Vijay rolled in a birdie from eight feet to finish his final round in six-under 66 and move to sole lead at 18-under and set the target for Randhawa and Chowrasia behind him. 

Dyson was not to be left behind as he birdied 14th and 15th to move to 16-under and give himself an outside stay in contention. 

As Vijay waited in the clubhouse, the final group approached the par-3 17th, where Randhawa managed only a par with his 20-foot birdie putt stopping two inches short. 

But Chowrasia holed his 15-footer for birdie, his third in a row, to join Vijay in lead at 18-under. 

Chowrasia had the honour of teeing off first on the 18th and his drive seemed headed left into the jungle. But the shot hit a tree branch and bounced back into the first cut on the fairway. He laid up the second shot and reached the green in three to set up a 15-footer that would have given him the title. 

Randhawa went for broke with a huge monster of a drive and his second shot went just over the green leaving him a chip from the edge for an eagle to give him sole lead. 

He made a brilliant attempt only to see it miss by less than a foot and he tapped in for a birdie to draw level at 18-under and set up a three-way tie. 

Chowrasia had a 15-foot putt to win, but he pulled it ever so slightly and managed only a par to force a three-way play between the Indians.

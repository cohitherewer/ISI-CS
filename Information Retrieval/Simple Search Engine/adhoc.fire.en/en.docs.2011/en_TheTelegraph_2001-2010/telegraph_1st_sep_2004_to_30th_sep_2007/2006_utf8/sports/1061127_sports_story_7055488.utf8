 Seniors need to show the way: Kapil

Mumbai: Indias World Cup winning captain Kapil Dev has asked the senior players to show the way on how to adapt to the bouncy wickets in South Africa. 

Its for the seniors to show the way to the youngsters. If the juniors start leading the way then its a clear sign that the time is up for the seniors, the legendary allrounder said on the sidelines of the Birla Sunlife Corporate Golf Tournament here. 

The youngsters also should not take long to adapt to the conditions. They are all professionals. Its up to them to adapt. 

The problem at the moment is the seniors have not done well (in South Africa). If they dont do well the juniors start to struggle, he said. 

Seam movement is always a problem for us. For us the bounce also is a problem, just as for other countries the turning ball is a problem, said the former allrounder.

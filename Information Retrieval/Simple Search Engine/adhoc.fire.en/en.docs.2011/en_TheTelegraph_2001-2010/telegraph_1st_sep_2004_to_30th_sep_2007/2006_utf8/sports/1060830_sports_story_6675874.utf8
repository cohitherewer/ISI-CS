Durban: South African cricketers Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje are most likely to travel to India for the ICC Champions Trophy after significant progress in efforts to resolve the legal tangle regarding their questioning by Indian police in the match-fixing scandal. 

South African Players Association secretary general Tony Irish said on Tuesday that both players were keen to play in the Champions Trophy. 

We are well down the road that will make it possible for Herschelle and Nicky to tour India, said Irish, who has been negotiating with different agencies on behalf of the two players. 

I am not in a position to give details yet, but negotiations have been going well. In the past, we have had to try to sort things out in a couple of months, but this time we have been working on the project over a much longer period. 

Gibbs, who has had a topsy-turvy season especially during the recent Test tour of Sri Lanka, has indicated that he was determined to travel to India but he would be guided by Irish and legal advisors. (PTI)

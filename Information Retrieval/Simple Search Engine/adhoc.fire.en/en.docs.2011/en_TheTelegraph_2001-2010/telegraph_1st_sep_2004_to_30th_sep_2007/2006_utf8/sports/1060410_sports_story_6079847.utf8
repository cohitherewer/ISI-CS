 Mohona, Sukanya play it safe 

 - Raj Goenka holds U-13 top seed Abhratanu 

A CORRESPONDENT 

 Mohona Sengupta (Top) 

 and Sukanya Dutta share the lead in the under-13 category 

Calcutta: Raj Goenka held top seed Abhratanu Dutta while overnight joint leaders Mohona Sengupta and Sukanya Dutta decided to play safe and agreed to a quick draw to retain their positions at the top in the under-13 category of the 18th State Age-Group Chess Championship on Sunday. 

After the completion of Round IV, Mohona and Sukanya share the lead along with Bitan Banerjee and Satyajit Kundu on 3.5 points. 

Raj, playing black, opted for the French Winawer against Abhratanu and equalised easily. Raj, in fact, had more play on the queenside but the game petered out into a draw in an opposite-coloured bishop ending. 

Second seed Bitan went for a complicated exchange against Diptanu Das in the centre which could have proved dangerous for him, but the latter mishandled the resulting position and went down tamely. 

In the under-11 section, Prantik Roy, Samrat Ghorai and Debarshi Mukherjee lead the field with full 4 points. Debarshi meets Samrat while Prantik plays Chandrashish Majumder in the next round. 

In the under-9 category, Prithwi Sinha and Supradip Maity lead the fray with 4 points each. Prithwi outwitted Soumi Mukherjee in a long game which lasted 61 moves. Supradip got the better of Ritika Neogi with the black pieces. 

In the under-7 category, Koutav Kundu put it across Swastik Choubey while Suvradipta Das got the better of top seed, Adhip Roy in 24 moves.

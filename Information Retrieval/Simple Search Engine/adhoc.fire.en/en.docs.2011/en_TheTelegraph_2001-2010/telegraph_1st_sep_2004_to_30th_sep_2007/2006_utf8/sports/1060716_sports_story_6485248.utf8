London: Mohammed Yousufs 17th Test century on Saturday gave Pakistan hope of drawing the first Test after the third day as they defend a 24-year-old unbeaten series record in England. 

Pakistan ended on 409 for seven at Lords ? still trailing Englands 528 for nine declared by 119 runs ? but having avoided the follow-on mainly due to Yousufs 185 not out. 

 Yousuf faced 287 balls in 387 minutes, hitting one six and 24 fours. He shared in stands of 173 with Inzamam-ul Haq, 59 with Abdul Razzaq, and 99 with Kamran Akmal. 

Shahid Afridi was yet to score at the close. 

Yousuf, who changed his name from Yousuf Youhana in 2005 after converting from Christianity to Islam, celebrated his century by kneeling and kissing the turf. The last time he played England he scored 223 in December as Pakistan won the third and final Test at Lahore to take the series 2-0. 

Pakistan, who havent lost a series in England in five tours since 1982, had resumed on 66 for three and added 99 runs before lunch for the loss of nightwatchman Mohammed Sami (0) on the 11th ball of the day. 

Sami edged a legcutter from Matthew Hoggard to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones with two runs added. He had nicked the previous ball to Andrew Strauss, but it bounced just in front of the stand-in captain at second slip. 

Inzamam and Yousuf took Pakistan to lunch at 165 for four. The pair moved to 241 before the Pakistan captain lost concentration one ball after a drinks break and was bowled by Liam Plunkett for 69. 

Inzamam had hit 10 fours and offered only one half-chance on 17 ? slashing a ball from Plunkett through the outstretched hand of a leaping Marcus Trescothick at first slip before lunch. 

 Only Plunkett had looked like dismissing Yousuf in the second session, twice beating his outside edge and enticing him on 82 to scoop a ball that just didnt carry as Paul Collingwood dived forward at short midwicket. 

Monty Panesar, who started to extract the turn that Pakistan legspinner Danish Kaneria used to take three for eight in Fridays second session, was hit by Yousuf for six over long-on and for four at mid-on by Razzaq in an over costing 13 runs. Pakistan scored 126 runs in the second session. 

 In the fourth over with the new ball after tea, Razzaq on 22 nicked a legcutter from Steve Harmison to Jones with Pakistan at 300 for six, still requiring 29 runs to make England bat next. 

Harmison bowled aggressively and pinned Akmal to the crease, taking one for 13 off six overs with the new ball, but the pair safely reached the follow-on mark of 329. 

However, Akmal was dropped on 26 by Kevin Pietersen at cover from the bowling of Plunkett with Pakistan on 337. Two overs later, Yousuf reached his 150 in six hours with a four off Panesar. 

Pietersen made amends for dropping Akmal by having him caught behind for 58 ? his first-ever Test wicket in just his third-ever over ? with his off spinners in the third last over of the day. 

 Harmison took three for 76, while Plunkett had two for 50, Pietersen one for 11 and Hoggard one for 100. 

Meanwhile, opener Taufeeq Umar and paceman Rao Iftikhar are to join Pakistans injury-depleted squad in England after the tourists decided to send home allrounder Shoaib Malik and fast bowler Mohammed Asif. 

PCB official Abbas Zaidi said on Saturday that the replacements were being flown to Britain within the next 24 hours to strengthen the side for the remaining three Tests of the four-match series.

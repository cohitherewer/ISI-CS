 Westerhoff unlikely to turn up

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The battle for the post of chief coach of the Indian football team may turn out to be a three-way contest as the fourth man in the fray ? Clemance Westerhoff ? seems unlikely to show up for the interview. 

While Brian Kerr and Bob Houghton arrived in the capital on Tuesday, the third candidate, Ian Porterfield, according to federation sources, is likely to come on Thursday. Westerhoff, the most famous among the four coaches called by the AIFF, has not contacted the federation so far. 

Kerr and Houghton will be interviewed by the technical committee and other senior officials on Wednesday. 

Kerr said it wasnt true that he had no experience of coaching in Asia. Ive coached clubs in Japan and the UAE, and also guided Malaysia U-21 side to third place in Asia?, Kerr clarified. 

He has no idea about Indian soccer. But this being a huge country, it shouldnt be a problem finding talented players. 

Kerr, who resigned as Ireland coach in September after failing to guide them to the World Cup finals, said he will ask his interviewers what exactly they want from him.

Calcutta: The 22-time champions Mohun Bagan needed just a draw to make the semi-finals of the 112nd IFA Shield. And on Sunday, at the Salt Lake Stadium they did just that playing out a goalless draw against a complacent-looking Shenzen Football Club, who had already booked their semis berth to become the second team from Group B to enter the knock-out stage. 

Unlike the normal drab goalless encounter, the Mohun Bagan-Shenzen Football Club, however, had all the ingredients of an exciting match. 

Firstly, the Doha-return Bhaichung Bhutia though he remained on the bench in the entire first-half boosted the teams line-up. Then their latest foreign entry Fabio Cortez Vidal to their star-studded XI meant that the city club did not want to leave any stone unturned in attaining their goal. If that was not enough, chairman of UB Group Vijay Mallyas egging-on towards the dying minutes added some extra spark to their cause. 

The first-half belonged to Mohun Bagan who had a 59 per cent possession with the first-time combination of Jose Ramirez Barreto-Fabio stealing the show. The duo did produce a golden chance to go one up 10 minutes before the lemon break, when Favio released the ball nicely for his captain Barreto. However, Dipendu Biswas could hardly make use of the brilliant Barreto pass, having been caught off guard in a melee. 

With Bhutia-Dulal Biswas introduction after the changeover, the home team was in all-attack mode. Two minutes before the final whistle, Bhutia had a couple of chances one with Mehtab and another solo but his shots were off-target. 

On the other hand, the Chinese outfit opted to play safe. Having booked their berth in the last-four, they rested their first matchs hero, Ma Xiao Lei. Unlike in the first-half, when visitors chose to take a defensive approach, the second-half saw them step up the ante. 

In the 57th minute, the Huang Feng Tao-Zhang Xiao Bin duo almost breached into their opponents territory, but for the Mohun Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee who made a brilliant save. Again in the Mohun Bagan goalie the Chinese team found their nemesis, with Sangram denying the visitors another goal in the 76th minute. 

For the home team, who failed to score though, this stalemate however proved to be worthwhile. 

TEAMS: 

Mohun Bagan: Sangram Mukherjee; Deepak Mondal; Eduardo Coelho; Dulal Biswas (Mehtab Hussain 46); Manas Das; Goutam Debnath; Lalkamal Bhowmick; Fabio Cortez Vidal; Jose Ramirez Barreto; Dipendu Biswas (Bhaichung Bhutia 46); PC Lalawmpuia (Subhas Chakraborty 54).

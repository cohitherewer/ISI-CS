Milwaukee: Arjun Atwal finished with a modest one-under 69 for a tied 52nd position at the US Bank Championships of Milwaukee. 

Atwal aggregated five-under 275 in a tournament in which he was tied third after the first round. 

Atwal started the final day with a birdie on the 10th and followed it with eight straight pars. On his second nine, he bogeyed the first and second before finding birdies on the fifth and sixth. 

The Indians accuracy off the tee left a lot to be desired at just 38 per cent while he reached only 61 per cent of greens in regulation. The title went to veteran Corey Pavin, his first win in 10 years. It was also his second win at the US Bank Championships, which he won exactly 20 years ago in 1986. 

The 46-year-old Pavin, the 1995 US Open winner, putted very well with his old caddie on the bag. He closed with a three-under 67 for a two-shot victory over local Jerry Kelly. 

Pavin, who last won in 1996 Bank of America Colonial, earned his 15th Tour victory with a timely eagle on the par-four eighth. Pavin hit a drive 270 yards to the centre of the fairway, and his second shot, a six-iron from 172 yards, bounced three times and rolled into the cup. It helped open a four-stroke lead over Kelly. Pavin finished with a 20-under 260 total. 

Kelly also closed with a 67. Jeff Sluman (64) was 17-under, Frank Lickliter (69) and D. J. Trahan (69) followed at 15 under.

 Court rejects Dalmiya petition

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: P.K. Sarkar, chief judge of the city civil court, on Friday rejected the petition moved by Jagmohan Dalmiya, former BCCI president, who had challenged the validity of a meeting called by the BCCI disciplinary committee asking him to appear before it on Saturday in Jaipur. 

The petitioner was given ample opportunity but he had failed to appear before the BCCI disciplinary committee in past. So his petition is rejected, the chief judge, in his order, observed. 

The committee had convened the meeting to take action against Dalmiya for his alleged misappropriation of BCCI funds during his regime. After Fridays court order, Dalmiya has no other option but to appear before the disciplinary committee on Saturday. 

The former president, in his petition, had stated that according to the BCCI rules, the disciplinary committee could function for six months only. 

The present committee was formed on February 27, 2006 and has completed its six months tenure. So the committee has no right to convene the meeting, Dalmiyas lawyer had argued.

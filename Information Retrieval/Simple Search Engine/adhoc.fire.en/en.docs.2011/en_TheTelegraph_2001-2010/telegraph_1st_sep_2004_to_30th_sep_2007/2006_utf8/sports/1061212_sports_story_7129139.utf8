 Pereira: Time to go back to drawing board 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira said on Monday that it was time to go back to the drawing board and set things in order ahead of the Federation Cup, which will follow the IFA Shield in the city. 

The Brazilian rued after East Bengals exit from the Shield the scoring inefficiency that remains his primary concern before the next challenge. 

You cant teach a forward how to score goals. We missed too many chances We should have at least scored five goals today. But this is what life is all about, He said. 

But isnt he responsible for the teams slide after winning the local league? Pereira admitted that theres a problem and the sooner we can find a solution to it, the better. 

On the one hand, he stressed that he had a solid bench, but on the other, he said he had to carry on with sick players like Alvito DCunha and Daniel, because there are no replacements for them. 

Mahindra United team manager and former India player Henry Menezes said his team would take the tournament as an opportunity to analyse what our strengths and weaknesses are and what needs to be done for further improvement.

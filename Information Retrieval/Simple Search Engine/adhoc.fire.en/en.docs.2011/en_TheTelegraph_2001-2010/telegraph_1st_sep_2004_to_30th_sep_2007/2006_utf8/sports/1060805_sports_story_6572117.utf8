The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Bengal will kick-off their season with the Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup tournament, to be played in Hyderabad from September 13. The squad for the tournament will be picked in the first week of September after coach Paras Mhambrey returns from England. The CAB also clarified that there wouldnt be any participation in the Twenty20 meet, organised by Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) from August 11.

 All the players havent started practice as yet. Besides, we will be missing some of the key players also, so we decided to skip the Twenty20 Cup organised by KSCA, said a CAB official.

 When asked if players like Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri and Shib Shankar Paul, who are currently employed with the Railways, would be available, the official said: Railways till now havent approached us in this regard, so they will be representing Bengal. 

 Meanwhile, it has been learnt that either Alok Nandy of IBAC or V. Kumar of Excelsiors will replace assistant secretary Arup Chatterjee of Barisha SC.

 AIFF leaves decision to Das Munshi 

 - Manhandling Issue

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Any decision by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) regarding action to be taken against Mohammedan Sporting for their alleged role in manhandling of IFA secretary Subrata Dutta last week in Calcutta will only be taken after president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi discusses the matter with general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

According to AIFF sources, Colaco, who was an eyewitness to the whole incident, will meet Das Munshi in a few days to report the matter. In a sensitive issue like this, one needs to apprise the federation head before taking any action, the sources said. 

The sources also revealed that though Colaco has pledged his support to Dutta and would stand by him, it would be difficult for the AIFF to take any action unless the IFA lodges a written complain against the erring club. The IFA has to take action against Mohammedan Sporting at their end before sending it for endorsement to the AIFF, an official said. 

The federation wants the IFA to take stringent action before deciding on its next move. 

Twice before, two Calcutta clubs had gone scotfree after indulging in almost similar incidents against the parent body. On both occasions, the IFA acted meekly and succumbed to pressure. 

Any repeat of such actions will leave little room for AIFF to act tough, the official revealed. 

A Staff Reporter in Calcutta adds: The IFA governing body referred the decision to the disciplinary committee which is expected to meet on Wednesday. The governing body condemned the whole matter. 

It has been learnt that Iqbal Ahmed, Mushtaq Ahmed Siddiqui and coach Subhas Bhowmick may be summoned by the disciplinary committee. We feel that an exemplary punishment should be given to the club, a source in the IFA said.

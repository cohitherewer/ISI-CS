The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We need Vaughan more than ever before

 Guest Column

 Andrew Strauss

Tours to the sub-continent are always a test of a cricket teams mettle and Englands tour seems to be no different. The Board Presidents XI showed us the strength of Indian cricket and, following our defeat, things were made worse by the news that my opening partner Marcus Trescothick would miss the first Test for reasons which were not explained before he left for London. 

We have other injury concerns too, like Michael Vaughan. If ever there is a time for his cool leadership, this is it. He has played through knee injuries before, as in Faisalabad and Lahore before Christmas, and he may well do so again this week. 

This England team hasnt won consistently over the last two years without having some backbone. We have to be more patient than we were in Pakistan, like Matthew Hoggard was on Saturday when he gave an indication of what will be needed by batting for a session and a half. We batsmen now have to follow his example. 

Playing the seam bowling in this part of the world requires skill, discipline and above all patience. The general low bounce makes it difficult to time the ball, the outfields are slow, and opposing captains are likely to have largely defensive fields. The moral of the story is that scoring is going to be difficult, so as batsmen, we have to be prepared to bat for long periods, and not give our wickets away. 

This is where we struggled in Pakistan. Fresh off the Ashes series, where both sides were determined to play attacking, aggressive cricket, I think we all struggled to rein ourselves in. Playing out a maiden, we realised, was not an insult to our ego, but, as Inzamam-ul Haq demonstrated, a good method to tire out fast bowlers in inhospitable conditions. I think we are starting to learn those lessons. 

Where India differs from Pakistan, however, is in how much the spinners are aided by the dusty surfaces that tend to break up after a couple of days. It is, without doubt, the hardest examination of a batsmans ability to play the turning ball, and will test us all in the coming weeks. 

The key to playing spin successfully is to have scoring options at all times. Spinners like nothing more than to have six balls at one particular batsman in an over because they can plan to use their varieties to tempt the batsman into doing something he does not want to do. The batsmans retort has to be to get off strike by scoring singles, or take on the spinner and look to hit boundaries. He has to have the ability to manoeuvre the field around so that the areas where he feels he is strong are unprotected. 

Much has been made about the sweep shot as a way of playing spin, and commentators and journalists are always quick to point out when a player is dismissed playing this shot. 

Of course you have to take an element of risk when playing across the line of the ball, but the alternative of poking around defensively is not appealing either. 

At international level you cannot afford to wait for the spin bowler to bowl you a bad ball because you will be waiting a long time. It is important to try and make the spinner bowl that bad ball by upsetting his rhythm, and the sweep shot is one way of doing this. Some very good players rarely sweep, but the best players in world cricket at the moment, Brian Lara and Sachin Tendulkar, look to sweep often.

 Claire in, Viv out of Lords Hall of Fame

London: Englands Claire Taylor is set to enhance the profile of womens cricket by becoming the first female player to feature on a Hall of Fame board at Lords, replacing Sir Viv Richards. 

Taylors unbeaten 156 against India in August is the top one-day International score at the Lords, surpassing even Richards 138 in 1979. 

Everyone who goes to Lords will see it and the profile of womens cricket will be raised. And for them to take down Richards board and put mine up its brilliant, she was quoted as saying by the BBC. 

Taylor said she was looking forward to a four-nation tournament, also featuring Australia and New Zealand, in India early next year. 

We were there last winter and didnt have a great time. We lost the one-day series 4-1 and drew the only Test, but should be better prepared this time, she said.

 Two-match ban, fine for Rooney

Berlin: Striker Wayne Rooney was suspended for two competitive international matches and fined 5,000 Swiss francs ($4,085) by a Fifa disciplinary panel that reviewed his ejection from Englands World Cup quarter final loss to Portugal. 

Fifa also banned Argentine defender Leandro Cufre for four matches and fined him 10,000 Swiss francs for his part in the melee that followed his teams quarter-final exit on penalties to Germany. 

His teammate Maxi Rodriguez was banned for two matches and fined 5,000 Swiss francs for his part in the same incident. 

Rooney was given a red card for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho in the 62nd minute of the quarter finals. He denied it was intentional but a Fifa disciplinary committee on Saturday found him guilty of violent conduct. Rooney faced an automatic one-game suspension by virtue of the straight red, but the committee doubled the punishment. 

The 20-year-old Manchester United forward will be suspended for the first two of Englands 12 qualifying matches for the 2008 European Championship.

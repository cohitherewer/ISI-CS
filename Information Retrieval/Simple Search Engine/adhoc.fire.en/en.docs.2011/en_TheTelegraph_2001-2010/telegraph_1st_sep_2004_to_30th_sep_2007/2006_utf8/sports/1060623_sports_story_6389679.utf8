 Argentina have 

 the strongest bench-strength

Argentinas 

 dazzling display against Serbia amp; Montenegro had mesmerised 

 the world and left football lovers craving for more. As 

 a coach, I knew an encore wouldnt materialise, at 

 least in the game against The Netherlands.

 Having already sealed a last-16 

 slot, Pekerman realised it was time to consolidate rather 

 than show off. It was also time to test the bench strength. 

 And so, we saw Argentina going 

 into Wednesday nights match without many of their 

 regulars. There was no Sorin and Heinze in defence, while 

 marksmen Crespo and Saviola were missing up front.

 Tevez and Messi, who both scored 

 the previous day as second-half substitutes, were given 

 a start. They didnt disappoint. The young Messi, who 

 has a potent left foot, showed a lot of thrust especially 

 in the first half. His start-up acceleration and dribbling 

 skills gave the Dutch defence several trying moments.

 Tevez showed his explosive quality 

 and a knack to produce sharp shots. One of his attempts 

 brought the best out of experienced goalkeeper Van der Sar. 

 Tevez looked more dangerous as the game wore on. 

 The Argentine show was once again 

 orchestrated by Riquelme. He was always in command when 

 the ball was on his feet. He also showed himself to be a 

 master of dead-ball situations, in the same league as Beckham. 

 The Argentine is a trifle slow but that doesnt deter 

 him from calling the shots from the middle of the park.

 The Dutch, like the Argentines 

 not having to worry about qualification, also rested some 

 key players including Robben. They were often exposed on 

 the right side of their defence, but otherwise coped well 

 with the Argentine pressure. 

 A couple of times in the first 

 session and quite often in the final half hour, the Dutch 

 posed the Argentine backline a few questions with Dirk Kuyt 

 and Van der Vaart spelling danger with their speed.

 Neither side went all out and 

 pushed too many men up front for obvious reasons, but the 

 Argentine dominance was never in doubt. It was also crystal 

 clear that the Argentines have the stronger bench-strength, 

 perhaps the strongest in the tournament.

 Pekerman, in fact, will have some 

 hard decisions to make before the pre-quarter final face-off 

 with Mexico. He has four forwards all in decent form from 

 which only two can play. If I were in his shoes, I would 

 stick to Crespo and Saviola rather than starting with Tevez 

 and Messi.

 The younger pair may have more 

 flair and energy, but they are still inexperienced in high-pressure 

 situations and also a bit individualistic. Tevez or Messi, 

 or both, can be introduced in the second session depending 

 on how the game is going.

 Mexico will have nothing to lose 

 when they clash with Argentina. They have some good players 

 in Rafael Marquez, Jose Fonseca and Omar Bravo, who can 

 surprise any opposition on their day. But I would still 

 say that Mexico will have to play out of their skins to 

 topple Argentina.

 The Netherlands versus Portugal 

 match will be a very close affair. Both love playing attacking 

 football, so the onus will be on the two backlines to stand 

 up to the pressure. Predicting a winner is a tough call. 

 I feel Portugal have their nose 

 in front ever so slightly. If you want it to be translated 

 into numbers, its 52-48 in favour of Figos army, 

 but the Dutch have the ability to bridge that narrow gap.

 In Thursdays edition 

 of Talking Tactics, it was inadvertently mentioned that 

 Portugal needed to top the group to avoid a possible second-round 

 clash with Brazil. It actually should have been Argentina.

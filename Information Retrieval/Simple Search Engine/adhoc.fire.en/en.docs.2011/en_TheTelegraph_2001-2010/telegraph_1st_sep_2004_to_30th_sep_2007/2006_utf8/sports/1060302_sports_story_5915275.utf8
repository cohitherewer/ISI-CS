The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Gameplan was zero: Bhaichung 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was extremely upset with the performance of the Indian team in the Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen on Wednesday and expressed his feelings in no uncertain terms during the half time of the match. 

According to team sources, a livid Das Munshi came to the Indian dressing room at the breather and was not ready to listen when coach Nayeemuddin and manager P.K. Banerjee tried to offer their explanation. You are perhaps playing worse than Bhutan, he told the team members. 

Captain Bhaichung Bhutia, however, saw a few reasons behind the humiliating defeat. We had no plans and our preparations lacked the needed punch, he told The Telegraph. The entire training system has to be modernised. Our gameplan was zero and so we got beaten in every department of the game. 

When asked what measures should be taken to improve the performance, he said: I dont know. That is for the federation to plan about. But with this kind of training schedule and playing style, we are not going to reach anywhere. Thats for sure. 

Bhutia also felt players like Rennedy Singh should be brought back in the team. We need experienced footballers. I also hope that Alvito (DCunha) recovers from his injury and joins the national team quickly. 

PK said he and his coaching staff are not going to submit their resignations after this disaster. I am not the one who runs away from the battlefield. After all our players become fit, we will be surely put up a better fight. 

Nayeemuddin said his resignation would not solve the problem. We need time and longer camps to counter stronger teams at the international level. Today so many of my top players were injured. The boys still put up a brave fight.

Vadodara: Right-arm pacer Munaf Patel grabbed his second five-wicket haul of the match to lead Board Presidents XI to a sensational eight-wicket victory over England at the IPCL Sports Complex here on Saturday. 

Patel picked five for 32 for a match haul of 10 for 91 to spark a middle order collapse and bundle out the tourists for a meagre 158 in their second innings on the third and final day of the tour match. 

The home side knocked off the 55 runs required in 17 overs for the loss of Wasim Jaffer (four) and Dheeraj Jadhav (18). Opening batsman Gautam Gambhir, who top-scored with 108 in the first innings, was 22 not out. 

There were little signs of the batting disarray to come when Matthew Hoggard went beyond his nightwatchman duties and blunted the home team attack in the morning. 

Hoggard (42) combined with Trescothick (32) to add 64 runs for the second wicket from 131 balls before Shib Shankar Paul broke the partnership by sending the latters off stump cart-wheeling half an hour before lunch. 

Hoggard remained as calm as he was against the Australian attack. 

His 158 minutes of dour defence, in which he faced 108 balls and hit four fours, came to an end when he went for a big shot against offie Ramesh Powar and was caught brilliantly by Suresh Raina at deep mid-wicket. 

It was the sixth over after lunch, and the next over Andrew Flintoff fell to Patel caught behind. The complexion of the match changed half an hour later when Ian Bell played inside the line and nicked it to the wicketkeeper off V.R.V. Singh.

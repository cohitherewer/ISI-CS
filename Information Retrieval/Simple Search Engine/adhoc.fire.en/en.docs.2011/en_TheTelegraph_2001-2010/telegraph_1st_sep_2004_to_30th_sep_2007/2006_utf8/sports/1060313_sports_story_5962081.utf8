 Chopra still in the hunt

Palm Beach Gardens: Daniel Chopra recovered magnificently on the back nine to finish with a one-under 71 and stay in the hunt at seven-under after the third round at the $5.5 million Honda Classic golf tournament on Saturday. 

Chopra, who was two-over on the front nine, had four birdies on the back nine, including one on 16th and 17th for a three-under 33 and finished two strokes off the lead. 

The Indo-Swedes total of seven-under 209 placed him tied fourth. 

Meanwhile, Luke Donald escaped a lot of trouble with decent pars and a fair number of birdies to come in with a 68 that gave him a total of nine-under 207 and a share of the lead with Billy Mayfair. 

Mayfair eagled the 17th hole to highlight his even-par 72 and reclaim a portion of the lead. Chopra had a bogey on the third but then neutralised with a birdie on the sixth, only to drop two shots on seventh and eighth.

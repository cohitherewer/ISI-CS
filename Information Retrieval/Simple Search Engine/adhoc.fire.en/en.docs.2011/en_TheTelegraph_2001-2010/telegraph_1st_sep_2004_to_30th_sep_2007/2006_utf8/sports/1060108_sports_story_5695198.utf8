 Aristotle superior 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Of the eight horses in the line-up for Sundays star event, the 2,400m Eveready Calcutta Derby Stakes, Aristotle has a definite edge over his rivals, including the two highly-rated fillies ? Sanskara and Supreme Princess. The Vijay Singh-trained ward is going to be the firm favourite to claim the winners purse of a shade over Rs 17 lakh.

 The fashionably bred son of Razeen-Excentrique, who made a winning debut, during the Bangalore summer season, has been on the up since.

 Aristotles Guineas victory over Arturo was very facile. More importantly, his recent workouts in the company of the last winters Derby winner, Aperitivo, were convincing enough to bury all doubts about his staying prowess.

 Aristotles main rival in the Derby could be Supreme Princess ? an easy winner of the Oaks. However, the Daniel David-trainee beat nothing of consequence in the race. Yet her subsequent improvement may help her finish ahead of a problem-ridden Sanskara and Arturo who may find the Derby trip taxing.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 Australia close in for the kill

 - Cooks maiden Ashes century 

 Alastair Cook in action on Sunday 

Perth: Englands Alastair Cook scored his maiden Ashes century to force the third Test into the fifth day and stall Australias unrelenting bid to wrap up the series on Sunday. 

Cook held the Australian bowlers at bay for six-and-a-half hours before departing for 116 in the third last over of the day as the tourists clawed their way to 265 for five, but still in deep trouble after starting the fourth day on 19 for one. 

With the odds heavily stacked against them chasing down a world record fourth-innings target of 557 required for victory, Englands best hopes of keeping their Ashes defence alive are to bat through Mondays final day and salvage a draw.

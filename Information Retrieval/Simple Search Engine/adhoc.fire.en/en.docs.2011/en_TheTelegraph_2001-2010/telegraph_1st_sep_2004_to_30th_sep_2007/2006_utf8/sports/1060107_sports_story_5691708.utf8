 PCB accepts Rahul suggestion

 - All 12 players of both sides will be given exposure 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: The Pakistan Cricket Board has accepted Team India captain Rahul Dravids suggestion that both sides (Pakistan A being the other) be allowed to give exposure to all 12 players during the tour-opener beginning on Saturday. 

The three-dayer is to be played at the Bagh-e-Jinnah. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the suggestion was conveyed to Saleem Altaf on Friday afternoon when the Indians had their first workout ? at the Gaddafi and at the Academy, which is just off the amphitheatre. 

Later, Dravid confirmed the arrangement. Now, our plan of having everybody (including the quartet which arrives on Saturday) come off a match before the first Test is going to take shape, he said, speaking exclusively. 

The ones yet to arrive are vice-captain Virender Sehwag, former captain Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble and Parthiv Patel. 

Led by Hasan Raza, the Pakistan A side includes Imran Farhat, Umar Gul and Bazid Khan. With good reasons, much of the attention will be on Gul, who broke down after a terrific spell against India in the Test here two years ago.

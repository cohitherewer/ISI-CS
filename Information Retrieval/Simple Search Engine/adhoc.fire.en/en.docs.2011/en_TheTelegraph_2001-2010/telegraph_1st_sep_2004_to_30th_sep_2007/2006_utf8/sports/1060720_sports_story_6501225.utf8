 Whatmore eyeing 5-0 sweep

Dhaka: Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore said on Wednesday hes aiming for a 5-0 whitewash of Zimbabwe in the away ODI series later this month. 

A 16-member Bangladesh squad, led by Habibul Bashar, will leave on July 23 for Harare, where they will contest five ODIs on July 29, 30, August 2, 4 and 6. 

Well be the favourites... Anybody can predict a 5-0 victory in favour of Bangladesh, Whatmore said in Dhaka after his teams last practice session. Actually its a good opportunity for Bangladesh. 

We need to get adjusted to the conditions as quickly as possible, said Whatmore. Bangladesh will play a practice match against Zimbabwe A on Wednesday. (AP)

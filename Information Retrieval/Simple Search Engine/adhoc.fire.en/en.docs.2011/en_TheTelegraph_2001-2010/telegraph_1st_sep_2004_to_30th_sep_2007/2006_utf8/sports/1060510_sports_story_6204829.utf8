 Sachin works out with Chappell 

 - Maestro has a light knock with tennis balls 

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar quietly started a light outdoor practice session at the Bandra-Kurla Complex Ground here on Tuesday after giving the slip to mediapersons waiting at the MIG Club Ground, also in Bandra, where he normally practises. 

Sachin had a light knock with tennis balls in the afternoon at the Bandra-Kurla Complex Ground under the watchful eyes of (Team India coach) Greg Chappell. He did not go to the MIG as a match was in progress there, a source close to the master batsman said. 

Chappell has returned to India after a short break in Australia ahead of the teams departure to the West Indies on Friday. 

The media contingent, which were waiting at the MIG ground, were left disappointed when the ace batsman did not make his appearance there as anticipated even as he was having the light workout elsewhere. 

Sachin is recuperating from a shoulder surgery that he underwent in March and is not available for the five match one-day series in the West Indies commencing on May 18. 

Team India physio John Gloster is constantly monitoring his progress. 

National selection panel chairman Kiran More had said on Monday that it was too early to comment on Sachins availability for the four Test series against the West Indies set to start on June 1 for which the team is expected to be chosen on May 22 or 23.

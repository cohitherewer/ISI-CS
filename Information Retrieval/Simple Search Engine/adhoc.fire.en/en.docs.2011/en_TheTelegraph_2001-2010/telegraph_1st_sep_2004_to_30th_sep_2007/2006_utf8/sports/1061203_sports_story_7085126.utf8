The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dead pitches will do us no good, says Vengsarkar

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar reiterated on Saturday that playing on dead surfaces is doing Indian cricket no good. 

Speaking on the sidelines of the Ranji Trophy match at the Eden the wicket for the ongoing Bengal-Mumbai tie has also drawn much flak he said: Playing on such surfaces doesnt help anyone. That is why we have recommended that the semi-finals and final should be played on neutral grounds. 

In case the home captains or associations ask the curators to prepare such wickets, its time we thought about implementing fines on associations. This process has got to be changed, he said. 

Vengsarkar also stressed on the need to have better planned itineraries on tours. 

Theres an 11-day gap between the last ODI and the first Test. There should have been at least two practice matches before the Test series. It would have helped the players to get acclimatised to the conditions better.

Calcutta: Though the camp for the AFC Asian Cup qualifier was scheduled to kick off here on Friday, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) still remains unsure about whether they would be able to start the camp at least on Saturday. 

I cannot say right now, it will get underway either on Saturday or Sunday, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said on Thursday. 

India will take on Saudi Arabia in the Asian Cup qualifier here on August 16. 

[Saudi Arabia will arrive in the city by a chartered flight on August 13, with a number of players who did duty in the World Cup in Germany, adds PTI from New Delhi. Players like defenders Hamad al Montashari, Hussein Sulimani, goalkeeper Mabrouk Zaid, and forward Yasser al Kahtani are expected to start in the Saudi Arabia line-up.] 

Colaco, along with AIFF vice-president Subrata Dutta and chief coach Bob Houghton, held a meeting with the coaches of the three big clubs at a city hotel on Thursday evening. 

It has been learnt that Houghton stressed on four factors technique, tactics, fitness and psychology during the discussion. They also explored the chances of starting a professional league. 

Houghton, who landed in the city on Thursday morning, is expected to meet the players on Friday. The players have been asked to report on Friday, Colaco said. 

According to Colaco, former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia still stands a chance to be drafted into the squad. 

He will speak to the coach tomorrow (Friday) and it will then be decided whether he would be a part of the camp. Now everything depends on that Bhaichung-Houghton discussion, Colaco said. 

Regarding the release of players by their respective clubs for the national camp, Colaco looked optimistic. The clubs have to release players for the national camp. Theres no other way, he said. 

Meanwhile, Dutta was manhandled by Mohammedan Sporting supporters while assisting Colaco to the club for an inspection as a build-up to the professional league. 

Dutta was taken aback when a group of Mohammedan Sporting supporters and members shouted slogans against him and showed him a black flag as part of demonstrations. 

As Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick and other officials threw a protective ring around Dutta and took him inside, the disgruntled fans vent their anger on Duttas car and smashed its windscreen and windows. 

When Dutta came out after a meeting with club officials, the agitators again barracked him, with some of them pushing and shoving him. Policemen managed to rescue Dutta and put him in his car, which immediately sped off. 

Mohammedan Sporting supporters were annoyed with Dutta after two of their club recruits Chandan Das and Syed Rahim Nabi went back to their old club East Bengal and others like Shylo Malsawmtluanga, M. Suresh and Mohammed Mukhtars cases still pending.

 Cole left out of Arsenal opener

London: Arsenal left Ashley Cole out of their Premier League opener despite the defenders apparent willingness to play. 

I feel if I include him today then he could be transferred tomorrow, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said. But when I give somebody the promise that he can leave, I do not renege on my word and we have given him that promise. 

Cole is still being linked with an impending transfer to Chelsea ahead of Saturdays match against Aston Villa. The English champions are reluctant to meet Arsenals valuation of the player. 

Meanwhile, Manchester United had two key players fall out during the World Cup, sold last seasons leading scorer and then watched their only new outfield signing get injured until September. 

Manager Alex Fergusons wish for a good start to the Premier League season may go unfulfilled. 

United open against Fulham on Sunday seeking victory as a fillip before losing striker Wayne Rooney and midfielder Paul Scholes to suspension for three matches after they were sent off in a pre-season tournament in The Netherlands. 

United have signed England midfielder Michael Carrick from Tottenham but he damaged ligaments at the pre-season tournament in Amsterdam and is out until September. 

If Rooney overcomes a groin strain, hell likely play alongside Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time since they fell out when up against each other at the World Cup quarter finals. 

In other Saturday matches, Everton meet Watford, Newcastle face Wigan, Portsmouth open versus Blackburn, Reading against Middlesbrough, West Ham take on Charlton and Bolton versus Tottenham. 

Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack, meanwhile, is unlikely to make his Premier League debut on Sunday against Manchester City as he has failed to recover from a hip injury, manager Jose Mourinho said on Friday.

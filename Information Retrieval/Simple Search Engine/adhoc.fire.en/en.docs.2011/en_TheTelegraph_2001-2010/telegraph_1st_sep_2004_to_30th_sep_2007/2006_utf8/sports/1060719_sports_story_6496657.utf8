 Kiran eyes pro tour

 - British-Indian eager to test self against likes of Wie 

 London: Seventeen-year-old 

 British-Indian woman golfer Kiran Matharu plans to turn 

 professional, after representing Great Britain and Ireland 

 in the Curtis Cup against the US at Bandon Dunes GC in Oregon 

 later this month. 

 Kiran, the current English womens golf champion, 

 said on Tuesday that after turning professional she is planning 

 to play along with Kapil Dev and Tiger Woods at a charity 

 match in India, to be organised by IMG. 

 [Contacted by The Telegraph 

 in New Delhi, Kapil said: Somebody did approach me 

 for taking part in an event and I said that would be great? 

 Golf is a lovely game and it will be terrific playing with 

 or against Tiger Woods? However, nobody has got back to 

 me with anything concrete.] 

Kiran also won Sportswoman of the Year at the Leeds sports awards. Kiran has been a name in Yorkshire since she was 12 when she posted her first win for Yorkshire Girls against Lancashire. 

 Testing herself against the likes of American golfing 

 sensation Michelle Wie is something Kiran can now look forward 

 to.

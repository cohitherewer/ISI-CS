 Sourav presence buoys East

 DEODHAR TROPHY

 Gwalior: Former India captain 

 Sourav Ganguly, who took a last-minute decision to play 

 East Zones second match of the Deodhar Trophy against 

 West Zone, turned up here in the afternoon and took part 

 in the squads practice session. After being dropped 

 from the Indian squad for the first Test against England, 

 Sourav is set to be seen in action for the first time in 

 the meet.

 Uncertainty about Souravs 

 participation in the match ended after he arrived here this 

 afternoon and took part in practice sessions for around 

 two hours.

 While East Zone boasts of a strong 

 batting line-up with the former Indian captain in their 

 side, West Zone, on a high after their victory over Central 

 Zone, made a few last minute changes bringing in Munaf Patel, 

 Ramesh Powar and Dheeraj Jadhav to replace Sandeep Jobanputra, 

 Mohnish Parmar and Connor Williams.

 West Zone, led by Parthiv Patel, 

 strongly relies on the young talent that had brought the 

 three-wicket victory over Central Zone.

 The team also has good bowlers 

 like Yusuf Pathan, coupled with some energetic fielders, 

 who are capable of checking the flow of runs and taking 

 wickets.

 Team effort and contribution 

 made by players in all faculties of the game has enabled 

 us to pick up victory, Patel had said after winning 

 the last match.

 East Zone, however, plan to ride 

 on the experience of the former Indian captain. 

 Enthused by Souravs presence, 

 East Zone captain Deep Dasgupta said our players are 

 highly motivated with the arrival of Dada. We will 

 try our best to present a good show against West Zone, which 

 is also a good team.

 East Zone, which was humbled by 

 South Zone in their last match, draws its strength from 

 talented players like Rohan Gavaskar and Laxmi Ratan Shukla.

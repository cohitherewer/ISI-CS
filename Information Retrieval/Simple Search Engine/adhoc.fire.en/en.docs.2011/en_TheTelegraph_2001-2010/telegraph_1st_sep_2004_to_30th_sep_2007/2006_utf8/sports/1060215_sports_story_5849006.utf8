 Runner dies after meet 

Hong Kong: A runner who collapsed during the Hong Kong Marathon died in hospital on Tuesday while another competitor remained in critical condition, a health official said. 

Tsang Kam-yin, 53, reportedly had asthma and was among the 22 runners who received hospital treatment. He died early in the morning. 

William Ko, chairman of event organiser, the Hong Kong Amateur Athletic Association, had dismissed concerns that there were insufficient doctors and first-aid staff to help a record 4,800 injured runners in Sundays race. 

He also defended the decision to stage the race amid the worst air pollution in Hong Kong since September. 

Ko said an index of 100 before the race was suitable for running although environmentalists criticised the governments use of outmoded and low air pollution standards. 

The other hospitalised runner, a 33-year-old surnamed Chu, who also collapsed during the race with 40,000 competitors, had regained consciousness on Monday but remained in critical condition. (AFP)

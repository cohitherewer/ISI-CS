Melbourne: Roger Federer and Martina Hingis kept their cool to reach the last 16 of the Australian Open on Saturday when scorching heat forced one teenager to retire and organisers to protect the players. 

Federer, the overwhelming favourite to win the mens singles, brushed aside Max Mirnyi of Belarus 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 in a night match to reach the fourth round without dropping a set. 

I havent got any injuries, Im playing good tennis and Im happy, so its all good, the world No. 1 said in a courtside interview. 

His Swiss compatriot Hingis, a former world No. 1, continued her remarkable return to Grand Slam play by crushing Czech Iveta Benesova 6-4, 6-1 under a blazing sun. 

Im eager to see anything I can. I missed it for three years, Hingis said later. Right now Im sucking it up. 

Officials closed the retractable roofs on the two main stadiums and postponed matches on the outside courts under their extreme heat policy after Michaella Krajicek retired from her match suffering heat stress. 

The Dutch teenager lost the first set 2-6 to third seed Amelie Mauresmo and decided not to continue after calling for assistance. 

I felt like I was going to throw up, Krajicek said at a news conference. I just couldnt even see the ball because my eyes were burning very much. 

I dont like to give up matches, thats for sure. I never give up... but I couldnt play any more. 

Argentine sixth seed Guillermo Coria also wilted in the blazing sun, losing 2-6, 2-6, 6-3, 4-6 to Frances Sebastien Grosjean before the extreme heat policy was invoked. 

Grosjean, seeded 25th, now faces compatriot Paul-Henri Mathieu in the fourth round after the 24-year-old beat Perus Luis Horna 7-6, 7-6, 6-1. 

There was better news for Belgian Kim Clijsters, who has struggled all week with hip and back injuries. 

The world No. 2 and US Open champion showed no obvious signs of problems as she romped to a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Italian Roberta Vinci. 

Clijsters will play Italys 15th seed Francesca Schiavone in the fourth round after she thrashed Maria Sanchez Lorenzo 6-0, 6-0 ? handing the Spaniard a dreaded double bagel. 

Argentinas Juan Ignacio Chela followed up his stunning win over local favourite Lleyton Hewitt with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 victory over Belgiums Kristof Vliegen to set up a pre-quarter final clash with Nicolas Kiefer. 

The German beat Spanish baseliner Juan Carlos Ferrero, the 15th seed, 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 6-2. 

 Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty lived up to his reputation as the ironman of tennis, overcoming Russian Igor Andreev 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to claim his third straight five-set match. 

He will play fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko after the lanky Russian beat local wild card Nathan Healey 6-2, 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 to knock the last Australian out of the mens draw. 

In-form German Tommy Haas beat another Australian wild card Peter Luczak 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 earlier in the day to earn the dubious honour of playing Federer. 

Twelfth seed Anastasia Myskina continued the Russian charge through the womens draw by brushing aside Swede Sofia Arvidsson 6-3, 6-1. 

Myskina is the fifth Russian woman to reach the fourth round where she will play seventh seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland who beat Japans Aiko Nakamura 6-2, 6-3. 

Frances Mauresmo, beaten by Hingis in the 1999 Australian Open final, will play Czech Nicole Vaidisova after the 14th seed beat Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-4, 6-2.

 Sri Lankans keen to seal qualification today

Ahmedabad: An in-form Sri Lanka would look to keep up their winning momentum and dump a lowly Zimbabwe to ease their way into the main draw of the ICC Champions Trophy here Tuesday. 

The match at the Motera is crucial for both the teams. A victory would bring the Sri Lankans to the threshold of the tournament proper while Zimbabwe are in a must-win situation to survive in the competition. 

The two sides have had dynamically opposite build-ups to the match, leaving little scope for doubt in deciding the favourites for the tie. 

The former world champions have been on song in the recent past with a 5-0 decimation of England a few months back, giving ample indication of their prowess. Their batsmen have led their sides resurgence after a 1-6 mauling at the hands of Rahul Dravids men in India last year. 

The ageing Sanath Jayasuriya, who returned from retirement, seems to have regained his aggression and the voracious appetite for runs. 

Skipper and prolific scorer Mahela Jayawardene, effortless strokemaker Kumar Sangakkara, veteran classicist Maravan Atapattu and emerging talent Upul Tharanga have combined to make the Sri Lankan batting a dreadful proposition for the opposition bowlers. 

On the other hand, spin magician Muttiah Muralidharan would spearhead the Lankan attack that is capable of rattling any top class batting line-up. 

Their convincing win over Bangladesh in their opening qualifying fixture on Saturday in Mohali is sure to have sent the Lankans self-conviction soaring. 

As for Zimbabwe, they need to stick to the basics to make any sort of attempt to thwart their fancied rivals. 

The Zimbabweans, the youngest team in the competition, have made a disastrous start to their bid for a place in the tournament proper which starts on October 15. 

Their batting crumbled like a cookie Sunday in their opening qualifying bout against the West Indies. Poor shot selection and suicidal running between the wickets saw them being skittled out for 85 and it must be disturbing the Zimbabwean team management no end. 

We have to try and get the basics right, skipper Prosper Utseya said, admitting that his players were morally down after the virtual no contest against the West Indies. 

The batsmen didnt apply themselves, it was a combination of poor shot selection and an inclination to play too many strokes early in the innings, said Utseya, calling on the batsmen to apply themselves more. 

Weve got to immediately sort out our batting, work on the basics and try to apply ourselves better, said Utseya. 

Face to face, the two teams have played 36 matches with Sri Lanka winning 29 of them. Zimbabwe have won six, four of which came at neutral venues. The two sides have met only once on Indian soil the Hero Cup in 1993-94 where Sri Lanka emerged victorious.

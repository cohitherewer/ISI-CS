 Now, Dhoni wants a real gun

Ranchi: He may have terrorised bowlers worldwide with shots booming from his bat, but Team India wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni now wants the real thing. 

The cricketer, famous for his gun salute after scoring a century against Sri Lanka last year, has now applied for a gun licence. 

He (Dhoni) has submitted an application for a gun licence, and we have forwarded it to the deputy commissioners office, senior superintendent of police R.K. Mullick said here on Sunday. 

However, Dhoni has to wait some more before his application is cleared by the administration. (PTI)

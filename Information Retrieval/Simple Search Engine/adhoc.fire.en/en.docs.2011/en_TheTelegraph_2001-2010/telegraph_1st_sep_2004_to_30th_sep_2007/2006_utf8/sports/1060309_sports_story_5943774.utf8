The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East have no hope, focus only on Sourav

 Deodhar Trophy

 Jaipur: Of the four teams 

 involved in the last round of league matches on Thursday, 

 as many as three ? West Zone, North Zone and South Zone 

 ? have a realistic chance of claiming the Deodhar Trophy.

 East Zone may be out of the reckoning 

 after having lost all their three matches, but the stakes 

 are still high for one Sourav Ganguly. The former India 

 captain is still determined to fight his way back into the 

 national team, Kiran Mores uncharitable remarks notwithstanding.

 Sourav, who reached the Pink City 

 around 10 pm after the morning flight he was due to take 

 out of Calcutta was rescheduled to afternoon, will be aiming 

 to make another statement with the bat when East face North 

 at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here.

 North have nine points and will 

 need a win to stay in the hunt.

 Leaders West, who have 12 points 

 in the kitty, will seal the trophy if they beat South (8 

 points) in Udaipur. South could clinch the title if they 

 beat West and North go down to East.

 North stand-in captain Mithun 

 Manhas, who is in good nick, said: We dont care 

 about what chances others have? Well go all out to 

 carve out a victory.

 Regular captain Dinesh Mongia 

 has left for his hometown as he is suffering from a back 

 problem. We still have the strength to win, 

 Manhas said.

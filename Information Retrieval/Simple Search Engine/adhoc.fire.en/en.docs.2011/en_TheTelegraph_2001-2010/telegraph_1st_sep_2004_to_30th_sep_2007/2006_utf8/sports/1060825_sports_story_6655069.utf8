 Umpires should be supported: Howard

Sydney: Australian Prime Minister John Howard weighed into The Oval Test controversy on Thursday, saying the game would descend into chaos if umpires did not receive support when enforcing the rules. 

While refusing to comment on specific issues arising from Australian umpire Darrell Hairs involvement in the ball tampering controversy, Howard said umpires deserved support for applying the rules. I always believe that umpires and referees should be supported by the governing body of the game, Howard told a radio channel. 

There are rules and, provided the rules are followed and properly applied, then the umpires should be supported. Once you start cutting and running from supporting umpires, you have chaos. 

Asked if he gave Hair his full backing, Howard said: Ill leave that to the International Cricket Council. 

Howards position is at odds with Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who phoned national captain Inzamam-ul Haq after the incident to express his support for the protest. 

The Australian Prime Minister said he hoped the matter would be resolved because Pakistan was a great cricketing nation. 

Their President is a cricket fanatic, like I am, and I just hope that the matter is resolved and we go back to normal operations, he said. 

Howard also involved himself in the previous controversy involving Hair, when the umpire no-balled Muttiah Muralidharan for throwing at the MCG in 1995, labelling the Sri Lankan spinner a chucker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its Barreto vs Azevedo today

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Last season, he was his trump card. This time, he could well be the nemesis. For Mahindra United coach Derrick Pereira, to find an answer to Jose Ramirez Barreto is the biggest riddle on the eve of the Mohun Bagan-Mahindra clash in the Durand Cup. 

But with Portuguese striker Filipe Azevedo finding the form in the first match against Air India, Pereira is a much more confident man at the moment. 

He even issued a veiled threat to Mohun Bagan saying: It could well turn out to be a battle of foreigners tomorrow. Filipes performance is extremely satisfying and he is slowly having a good combination with Yakubu. 

Pereira admitted keeping an eye on Barreto is very much part of his game plan. He is a special player. You have to give special attention to him. 

Having won their opening ties, both Bhattacharya and Pereira are approaching Tuesdays match cautiously. Bhattacharya said, we will have a cautious approach. The Mahindra coach felt the team which defends well will win.

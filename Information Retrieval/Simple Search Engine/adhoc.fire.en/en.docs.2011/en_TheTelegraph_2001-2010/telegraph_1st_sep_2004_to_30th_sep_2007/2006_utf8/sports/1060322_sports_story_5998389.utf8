The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Give Der Slip may strike again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Dipak Karkis Give Der Slip is strongly fancied to lift the 1,200m Network Cup, the main event in Wednesdays six-event race card. 

 The Mischevious Music-Watercolours son was an easy winner in his previous start and looks good for a repeat performance, though drawn on the wide out. Rajesh Babu partners the four-year-old. 

 The CROS Cup may see a straight contest between Vijay Singhs Rainbow Run and Errol Bhungards Cupids Glory. The former, however, is fancied to win as he badly needed the last run.

 Favourites fare poorly in the Bookmakers Association Cup, yet Javed Khans Amourette may win over the slated trip. She was an impressive third in her debut run.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

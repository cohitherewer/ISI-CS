 Vijay: Leave Sania alone

Bangalore: Indian tennis legend Vijay Amritraj sounded a note of caution on Wednesday against putting too much pressure on Sania Mirza to deliver every time she walks out on the court, and creating unnecessary hype. 

Amritraj said Sania had the game, potential, talent and attitude but she ought to be given some time to translate all that into success. 

Important thing for everyone, all of us, is to stop talking about her, so that she can go and do her job. Expectations should not be created by us, let her go and do it, he said on Wednesday. 

Amritraj backed the Hyderabadi girl, currently ranked No.38 in WTA Tour rankings, to go allp the way up the ladder. 

He also credited the 19-year-old for setting high standards. 

Sania has done something unique because she is the first one to do it. What she has achieved in the last 12-18 months has been outstanding. Now, she has got to build on that. 

Asked about specific areas where Sania could improve her game, he said there was a room for improvement but pointed out it was for her and coach to work on that.

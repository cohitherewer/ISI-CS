 Sourav didnt refuse to open in Lahore, says Raj Singh

 - Mumbai Test

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav 

Raj Singh Dungarpur, manager on Team Indias recent tour of Pakistan, has confirmed what was thus far known to a select few ? that Sourav Ganguly didnt refuse to open in the series-launching Test at the Gaddafi, two months ago. 

With neither captain Rahul Dravid nor coach Greg Chappell clarifying that either during or after the Test (and Sourav couldnt go on record), many believed Dravid was forced to partner Virender Sehwag as the former captain didnt want to put his neck even more on the line. 

The confirmation came at a classy function, organised by the Cricket Club of India and the Bank of Baroda, to felicitate Dravid on the eve of his 100th Test. 

When I spoke to Sourav, he made it clear he would do whatever the team wanted... On the morning of the match, Rahul knocked on the coachs door and said he would himself open, even though it meant going against a decision already taken... Thats captaincy and thats leadership, Raj Singh declared. 

The star-studded gathering ? among those present were Polly Umrigar, Chandu Borde, Farokh Engineer, Bishan Singh Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar, Dilip Vengsarkar, Sandeep Patil, Ravi Shastri, Chappell and England captain Andrew Flintoff ? applauded. 

When it was his turn to speak, Dravid became emotional: Ive been able to look back on my career, these past few days, and Im grateful to all those who helped me achieve what I have... Ive been blessed... Ive been very lucky... This (function) is a humbling experience... Ive shared the dressing room with not just great cricketers, but great human beings... 

He added I hope Ill be able to live up to the expectations... and didnt forget to mention the India captains he has played under ? (the tainted) Mohammed Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav. 

Gavaskar, by the way, exhorted Dravid to do even better than Ricky Ponting who got a hundred in each innings of his 100th Test (against the West Indies, late last year). Take it easy and dont get worked up was his advice. 

Our first Little Master also had a few words for Anil Kumble (the newest entrant into Club 500), who seemed embarrassed having to share the limelight with Dravid. 

Specifically, Gavaskar said: Anil, perhaps, is the most underrated performer... There is loose talk about his not turning the ball and so on, but he has plenty of venom and plenty of variety... Over 500 batsmen are going to vouch for that... 

Meanwhile, according to The Telegraphs sources, the Indians will field a 2-2 attack in the third and final Test (at the Wankhede, from Saturday). One learns young leggie Piyush Chawla is going to be dropped and back in the XI will be V.V.S. Laxman. 

India have an unbeatable 1-0 lead.

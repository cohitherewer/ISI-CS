 Pawar: Need to improve our pitches

Hyderabad: BCCI supremo Sharad Pawar said on Sunday it was important to improve quality of home pitches to avoid the repeat of recent Durban debacles in future. 

Pawar said the team might be excelling at the tailor-made pitches on home soil but finds it difficult to adjust to situations on their foreign tours. There is a need to improve the quality of pitches in the country. Our batsmen have excellent record on tailor made pitches on home soil. When they go abroad they fail to perform to the expectations. Then there is big criticism and hue and cry about Indias failures abroad, he said. 

Pawar was here to felicitate city boys B. Manoj Kumar and Mohammed Shaibaaz Tumbi for breaking Tendulkar-Kambli record of highest partnership by making 721 runs in 40 overs in an inter-school match. Pawar presented the two boys cheques of Rs 50,000 each at the function organised by the Hydebarbad Cricket Association (HCA).

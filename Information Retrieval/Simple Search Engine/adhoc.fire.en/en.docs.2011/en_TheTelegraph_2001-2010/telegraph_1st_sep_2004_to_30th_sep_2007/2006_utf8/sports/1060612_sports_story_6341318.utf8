 Alonso makes it three in a row

 - British GP

 - Schumacher finishes second 

 Fernando Alonso after his win on Sunday 

Silverstone: Renaults Fernando Alonso led the British Grand Prix from start to finish on Sunday to maintain his vice-like grip on the Formula One championship. 

The world champions first win at Silverstone, one of his Anglo-French teams home races, was his fifth in eight Grands Prix and third in a row. 

Winning in Spain, Monaco and Silverstone ?? the last three races are a dream come true, said Alonso. They are circuits with big names and big emotions. 

The 24-year-old Spaniards lead over Ferraris Michael Schumacher, the seven-times champion who finished second ahead of McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, increased to 23 points with 10 races remaining. 

Alonso has 74 points from a possible 80, with Schumacher on 51 and Raikkonen on 33. 

Worryingly for Schumacher, the chances of Alonsos lead narrowing significantly any time soon looked remote after another untroubled Sunday stroll in the sunshine for the youngest of champions. 

Alonso, on pole position for the fourth race in a row, was making his 14th successive appearance on the podium and he has finished second when he has not won this year. 

Sunday at Silverstone was no thriller. The Spaniard took the chequered flag a comfortable 13.9 seconds clear in the least eventful race of the season so far. 

Perhaps it was the early start, with the race brought forward by two hours to avoid any clash with the World Cup finals in Germany, but even the protagonists sounded underwhelmed. 

There wasnt much excitement there, said Schumacher, smiling thinly in a new conference after Alonso had been asked why he was looking so glum. 

It was probably a lonely race for Fernando, there was a bit of action between me and Kimi but it wasnt that exciting...so theres no reason for us to jump around as if something particular has happened. 

 Giancarlo Fisichella finished 

 fourth, increasing Renaults lead over Ferrari in the 

 Constructors Championship to 31 points.

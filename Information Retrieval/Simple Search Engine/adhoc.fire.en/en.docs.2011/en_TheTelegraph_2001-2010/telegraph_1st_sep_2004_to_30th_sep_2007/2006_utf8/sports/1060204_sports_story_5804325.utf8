 Cristiano banned for finger gesture

Nyon (Switzerland): Uefa banned Manchester United winger Cristiano Ronaldo on Friday for one match for taunting Benfica fans during a match at Lisbons Stadium of Light. 

The governing body of European soccer also fined Ronaldo 10,00 Swiss francs ($7,750) for the incident on December 7, when he made an obscene gesture ? pointing his middle finger at Benfica fans ? as he left the field in the 67th minute. United was eliminated from the competition after losing 2-1. 

The Portugal international and former Sporting Lisbon player was loudly jeered by the 60,000 sell-out every time he touched the ball. 

Ronaldo recently completed a three-match ban from the English football association after being sent off in a 3-1 loss to Manchester City. 

Manchester United has three days to appeal, starting Monday, when the full reason for the ban will be disclosed, Uefa said in a statement. 

The ban will come into effect next season if Manchester United qualifies for a Uefa club competition. Ronaldo played for Sporting, Benficas rivals, before joining United in 2003.

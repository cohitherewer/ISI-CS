 Yorke urges England to beat Sweden

 Yorke 

 Rotenburg: Trinidad and Tobago captain Dwight 

 Yorke intends to text or call as many England players as 

 possible, urging them to win against Sweden and help his 

 country progress from World Cup Group B alongside the English. 

 If Trinidad and Tobago beat Paraguay in their final 

 group match on Tuesday and England defeat Sweden at the 

 same time, the Caribbean side will reach the second phase 

 at their first finals provided they have a better goal difference 

 than the Swedes. 

I will be texting or will call the boys, like (Wayne) Rooney, Becks (David Beckham), Rio (Ferdinand), Gary (Neville), he told reporters on Sunday. 

To be honest I will text them all if I can get their numbers, but certainly most of them anyway. 

 Yorke is firm friends with many 

 of the England squad, especially those who play or have 

 played for Manchester United.

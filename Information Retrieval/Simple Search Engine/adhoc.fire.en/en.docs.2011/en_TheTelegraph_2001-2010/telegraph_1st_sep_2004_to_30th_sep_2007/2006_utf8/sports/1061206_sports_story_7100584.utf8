 Shoaib, Asif cleared of doping charges 

 - Appeals tribunal lifts ban with 2-1 majority 

Karachi: In an about-turn, Pakistan cricket authorities on Tuesday surprisingly lifted the bans on fast bowling spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, imposed only 34 days ago with great fanfare, and made them eligible for playing in the World Cup five months away. 

Shoaib was banned for two years and Asif for one by a dope tribunal on November 1, throwing their careers in jeopardy, but the new appeals tribunal overturned the ruling which it said was too harsh. 

Justice (Retd) Fakhruddin G Ebrahim, who headed the three-member appeals tribunal, said their bans had been lifted after hearing out convincing arguments through their lawyers. 

Justifying the ruling, Justice Ebrahim said neither player was advised on taking vitamin supplements which might have led to them testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. 

We were totally independent and there was no pressure on us to give any rubber-stamp decision. We felt the whole procedure was not correct and the ban was too harsh and could destroy their careers, he told reporters here. 

Shoaib and Asif will not be deemed to have committed a doping offence. The ban and punishment imposed by the earlier tribunal is hereby set aside as being contrary to the provision of laws, Justice Ebrahim said adding the three-member tribunal made its decision by a 2-1 majority. 

Former Test player Haseeb Ahsan and anti-doping expert Danish Zaheer were the other members of the tribunal. 

Justice Ebrahim said the tribunal found that the bowlers were never warned or cautioned against taking supplements. 

Asif was only told to discontinue taking the supplements when he himself told team physio Darryn Lifson about them in August 2006, he said. Neither player was even provided with any international or local publication warning them against the use of supplements. 

Hence this appeals committee by majority of two to one is of the considered view that Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif have successfully established that they held an honest and reasonable belief that the supplements ingested by them did not contain any prohibited substances, the verdict said. 

The dissenting opinion came from Zaheer, who said Pakistan should rely not just on the anti-doping regulations of its own cricket board but those of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). He called for fresh tests to be conducted under those guidelines. 

Article 2 of WADAs anti-doping code says: It is each athletes personal duty to ensure that no prohibited substance enters his or her body. 

Zaheer was strongly critical of the PCBs handling of the case, saying the people assigned to do doping tests were not properly trained, and the committee that handed down the bans had only very basic or no knowledge of these sensitive technicalities involved in the process of such testing. 

International Cricket Council spokesman James Fitzgerald said the sports international governing body was yet to see the report from the hearing tribunal, and would not make a comment until it had studied the judgement.

 Bhaichung clarifies stand

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhaichung Bhutia

New Delhi: Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia on Friday explained his position on his reported criticism of the Indian team management after the twin defeats against Japan and Yemen in the Asian Cup qualifiers. Personally, I have nothing against PK Banerjee or Syed Nayeemuddin, Bhaichung said. I respect them as former footballers and coaches. All I said was about the way Indian football is suffering. 

Bhutia said that he felt that there was a huge generation gap between the players and the coaching team. Somehow that has not been bridged. We need to do something to improve upon it. India conceded nine goals in two matches. 

Meanwhile, under-20 coach Ismail Akhmedov is likely to be appointed the Indian coach for the 16-nation AFC Challenge Cup to be held in Dhaka in April. According to All India Football Federation sources, the Uzbek coach has been picked up for the job since the team will be comprised of mostly under-20 footballers. A few players from the second division NFL may also be picked up.

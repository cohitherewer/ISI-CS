 PCB gags Shoaib, Asif

Karachi: Pakistan fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif have been told to stop talking to the media before their appearance next week at a doping tribunal. 

The pair was recalled from the Champions Trophy in India on Monday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. 

They have been advised that it is better for them to plead their case in front of the tribunal instead of publicly as it would only damage their case, Saleem Altaf, the PCBs director of operations, said. 

Altaf said that the first hearing would take place next week after the Id holidays. 

[The Telegraph had reported on Wednesday that the tribunal was unlikely to meet this week.] 

Since the holidays are coming up we have decided to have the hearing immediately afterwards. Both will be given a fair opportunity to plead their case, he added.

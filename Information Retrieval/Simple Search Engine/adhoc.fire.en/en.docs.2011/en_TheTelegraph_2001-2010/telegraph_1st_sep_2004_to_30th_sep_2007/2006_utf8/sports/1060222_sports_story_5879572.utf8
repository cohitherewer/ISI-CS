The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Singapore: For almost three decades, Peter Velappan has been the voice of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), but the controversial secretary-general has now been silenced. AFC president Mohammed bin Hammam, a Qatari who says he lives by the maxim that actions speak louder than words, has decided he will now be the only person authorised to talk officially on Asian football matters.

 According to an AFC official, the rationale 

 is that Asian football?s governing body is going through 

 a transition ?from being amateur to being professional? 

 and a single voice is needed. The AFC denies relations between 

 Bin Hammam and Velappan have soured. ?There is no rift,? 

 an AFC spokeswoman insisted.

 Kathmandu: The political turmoil in Nepal has cost the kingdom the hosting rights for the AFC Challenge Cup which it was scheduled to stage along with Bangladesh.

 During the meeting of the AFC Challenge Cup and AFC President?s Cup organising committees in Kuala Lumpur, it was decided that Bangladesh would be the sole host of the inaugural edition of the tournament. 

 The dates of the competition have also been 

 amended. Earlier it was to be held from March 25 to April 

 7, but now it has been decided to be played from April 1 

 to 16 in order not to clash with Bangladesh Independence 

 Day celebrations on March 26.

 London: England?s Football Association will transfer May?s FA Cup final to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff because the new Wembley Stadium will not be ready in time.

 ?I can confirm that this season?s FA Cup final will be held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on May 13,? FA chief executive Brian Barwick said in a statement on Tuesday.

 The delay is a major embarrassment to the FA who had hoped to return the showpiece event to Wembley ? which hosted Cup finals between 1923 and 2000 ? after five years in Cardiff.

 The original Wembley, probably the most famous 

 soccer stadium in the world, was demolished in 2000.

 Bucharest: Romania?s fiscal authorities have launched an investigation into striker Adrian Mutu?s transfer from Dinamo Bucharest to Inter Milan in 1999.

 Dinamo said the fee for Romanian international Mutu, who now plays for Juventus, was $2.1 million while Inter said it was six million euros ($7.15 million).

 ?The tax authorities have asked for documents 

 from the FRF (Romanian football federation) in order to 

 investigate the financial details of the deal,? FRF official 

 Florin Prunea said on Tuesday.

 London: The five major professional golf tours combined to launch the first official women?s world rankings system on Tuesday.

 Sweden?s Annika Sorenstam is ranked first on the inaugural list. She has a large lead over American Paula Creamer and Hawaiian teenager Michelle Wie.

 The rankings will be released every Tuesday.

 Sydney: Multiple world and Olympic champion 

 Ian Thorpe is suffering from bronchitis just three weeks 

 before the Commonwealth Games, his coach said on Tuesday. 

 The 23-year-old Australian, going for a 100 and 200m freestyle 

 double in Melbourne, has been forced to rest as he tries 

 to shake off the illness.

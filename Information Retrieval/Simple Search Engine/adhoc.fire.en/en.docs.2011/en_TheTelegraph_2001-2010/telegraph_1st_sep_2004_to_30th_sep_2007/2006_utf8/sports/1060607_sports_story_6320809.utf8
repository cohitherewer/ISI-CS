St. Johns: India were smelling blood after they struck thrice to reduce the West Indies to 72 for three in their second innings in the first Test here on Tuesday. 

Chasing a daunting target of 392, the hosts made a smooth start through a 67-run opening stand between Daren Ganga and Chris Gayle, but then lost three wickets in less than five overs in the first session on the fifth and final day at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

 West Indies were 158 for three at tea on the final 

 day. Chris Gayle was batting on 59 while Shivnarine Chanderpaul 

 was on 47. 

Gayle was batting on 28 at the break which came at the fall of captain Brian Lara for nought. 

The Indian bowlers seemed to lack the firepower to blast out the hosts on a track that had seen the gradual loss of venom from the first day. 

Sreesanth (two for 16) was carted for a mighty six over midwicket by Gayle and Vikram Rajvir Singh looked a tired man in his first Test. 

Anil Kumble (1-12) gave the first breakthrough when he had Ganga (36) caught brilliantly by Yuvraj Singh at forward shortleg. 

A run later, Ramnaresh Sarwan (1) played a reckless drive against Sreesanth to spoon a simple catch to Kumble in the slip cordon. 

Sreesanth, now pepped up, got one straight up to rap Lara plumb in front. 

The hosts need another 320 more to win. 

Sreesanth, after his disappointment of the first innings when he was thrashed by the West Indian batsmen, was finally beginning to make an impression in the game. 

Earlier, Wasim Jaffers maiden double ton and a pulverising half-century by Mahendra Singh Dhoni helped India set up a daunting target for the West Indies on Monday. 

After Jaffer stroked his way to a marathon 212, Dhoni pummelled the West Indian attack into submission with a powerful 69. 

The two contrasting innings helped India, who began the second knock with a 130-run deficit, declare at a mammoth 521 for six ? leaving the hosts needing 392 to win.

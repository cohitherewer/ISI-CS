 Railways champions

 National one-dayer

 Mumbai: Railways denied 

 Uttar Pradesh a domestic title double when they beat the 

 newly-crowned Ranji Trophy champions by 20 runs to clinch 

 the national one-day title on Wednesday.

 Allrounder Shreyas Khanolkar provided 

 the star turn for Railways by top scoring with 73 and helping 

 his team pile up 224.

 He later took three important 

 wickets for 46 runs with his off-breaks, to apply the skids 

 under UP. UP were all out for 204 in 47.1 overs, with their 

 last two batsmen run out in a frenetic chase towards the 

 end.

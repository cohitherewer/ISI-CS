 Father-in-law of Landis kills self

San Diego: The father-in-law of disgraced Tour de France winner Floyd Landis has committed suicide, police said on Wednesday. 

David Witt, the stepfather of Landis wife Amber, died on Tuesday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, San Diego Police said. He was 57. 

The Landis family is devastated by the news of Davids death, said Michael Henson, a spokesman for Floyd Landis. They loved him dearly and they miss him. They hope that their privacy is respected in this time of mourning. 

Police said Witt was discovered in a parking structure in the North Park section of San Diego. He was rushed to the hospital but died of the single gunshot wound about seven hours after he was found. 

Landis captured the prestigious Tour de France last month but ultimately tested positive for abnormally high levels of the male sex hormone testosterone. He had produced one of the greatest solo rides in Tour history to win the 17th stage of cyclings biggest race after falling more than eight minutes behind during the previous stage. 

Landis team, Phonak, fired him after his second B sample tested positive for testosterone this month, and it appears likely he will become the first winner in the 103-year history of the Tour to be stripped of his title. 

Witt, a San Diego restaurant owner with his wife Rose, was at the finish line in Paris when Landis won the race. Police said they were unaware of any suicide note left by Witt. 

Meanwhile, 17 of cyclings top teams have asked the international cycling union (UCI) to consider suspending Phonak from the Pro Tour, adds a report from Brussels. The teams, which met in Brussels on Wednesday, also said the 

The UCI should study a similar ban on the Astana team, formerly known as Liberty Seguros, which has been implicated in a Spanish doping investigation. 

The meeting was attended by all of the teams except Phonak, Astana and Ag2r. 

Phonak owner Andy Rihs said Tuesday he was folding the team at the end of this season after failing to find sponsors for 2007.

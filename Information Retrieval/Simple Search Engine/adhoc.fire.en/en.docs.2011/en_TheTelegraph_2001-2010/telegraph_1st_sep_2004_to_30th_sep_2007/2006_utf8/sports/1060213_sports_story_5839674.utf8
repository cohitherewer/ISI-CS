 Berlin: German security and intelligence services believe German hooligans are planning to cause mayhem at this year?s World Cup, a German magazine said on Sunday. ?The hooligans are in the starting blocks. They believe that the police cannot be everywhere during the World Cup. They want to take advantage of that,? the intelligence chief in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Johannes Schmalzl, said.

 Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein also told the weekly magazine that the hooligans were preparing intensively for the World Cup. Focus said German authorities had become more nervous after Hans Rostock fans rioted on February 5, injuring 18 police. 

 London: Arsenal fear Jose Antonio Reyes may have broken his leg in a challenge with Bolton Wanderers? Abdoulaye Faye during their 1-1 Premier League draw on Saturday, manager Arsene Wenger said.

 The Spanish striker was stretchered off and replaced by Robert Pires after Faye?s two-footed challenge in the first half of the game at Highbury.

 Tokyo: Ethiopian Ambesse Tolossa produced a superb finish to win the Tokyo International Marathon on Sunday and deny Japan?s Toshinari Takaoka a second straight title.

Tolossa?s time of 2:8.58 was just two seconds outside his personal best, set in winning the Paris Marathon in 2004. Takaoka clocked 2:09:31 with Kenya?s Sammy Korir third in 2:10:07.

 Perth: Thaworn Wiratchant has been named Asian Golfer of the Year following a successful season in which the Thai player won four titles and finished top of the Asian Tour order of merit.

 The 39-year-old Thaworn took his career victory tally to eight with his four titles in 2005 as he became the first player on the Asian Tour to earn more than $500,000 in a season.

 Thaworn is the second Thai golfer to win the award after Thongchai Jaidee received the honour in 2002 and 2004.

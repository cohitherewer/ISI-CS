 Ivorians plot debut surprise

Nuremberg: Ivory Coast are the latest African team who believe they can take a shot at glory starting with an upset win over Argentina on their World Cup debut. 

African nations have been threatening for years to upset the established hierarchy and the Ivorians aim to pick up the baton held by Senegal who reached the quarter finals four years ago. 

They fancy their chances of beating twice world champions Argentina on Saturday and going on to bigger things in their first appearance at the worlds showpiece tournament. 

Argentina are also talking confidently ahead of the game at the AOL Arena in Hamburg with two more tough Group C games to come in the shape of Serbia amp; Montenegro and the Netherlands. 

However, the memory of Cameroon in 1990 still hangs over the Argentines who are fully aware that Diego Maradonas title holders lost 0-1 in the opening match of the Italy tournament. 

Ivory Coast defender Kolo Toure knows all about that match, but said they would not underestimate their opponents. We all know how dangerous Argentina are. It will be a great test for us. (Roberto) Ayala is a hero of mine. 

Ivory Coast know they must reach the last eight to emulate the achievement of Cameroon in 1990 and Senegal in 2002. Argentina will be happy if they can repeat their opening result in Japan in 2002 when they beat another African team, Nigeria, 1-0 with a Gabriel Batistuta header. 

Argentinas highest World Cup scorer has handed over the striking role to his perennial reserve Hernan Crespo, who has said the worst experience of his footballing life was their countrys shock early exit from the last tournament. 

It is this memory that drives coach Jose Pekermans new Argentina as they set out to win a third title. We have a debt which is to take Argentina as high as possible, said Argentinas captain Juan Pablo Sorin. 

Pekerman sprung a surprise by naming his team on Friday for their opening World Cup Group C match against Ivory Coast more than 30 hours before the match kicks off in Hamburg. 

There was no surprise in the lineup itself, with Javier Saviola named as Hernan Crespos strike partner for Saturdays match, since Pekerman had been practising with the same 11 players all week at Argentinas World Cup base near Nuremberg 

They may have problems on the left flank, though, where right back Emmanuel Eboue loves to make attacking runs that will put pressure on Sorin and central defender Gabriel Heinze. 

Eboue can provide ammunition for captain Didier Drogba and Heinze has stressed the importance of neutralising the threat by cutting out the diagonal balls into the middle that the striker loves and ensuring he does not ghost in at the far post. 

Pekerman may need to send on the talented light brigade of Lionel Messi, Carlos Tevez and 2002 veteran Pablo Aimar to dance their way past the towering Ivorian defenders if Juan Roman Riquelmes playmaking fails to break the deadlock.

Argentina: 1-Roberto Abbondanzieri; 21-Nicolas Burdisso, 2-Roberto Ayala, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 3-Juan Pablo Sorin; 18-Maxi Rodriguez, 8-Javier Mascherano, 5-Esteban Cambiasso, 10-Juan Roman Riquelme; 7-Javier Saviola, 9-Hernan Crespo.

Durban: Captain Ricky Pontings flawed century put Australia in command on the first day of the second Test against South Africa on Friday. 

Australia, having opted for first strike, were 228 for five when bad light ended play two overs early. 

South Africa, who trail the three-match series 0-1 after having lost the first Test by seven wickets, pegged Australia back during the final session. 

Ponting survived two chances early in his 225-ball innings before reaching his 29th Test century after batting for more than five hours. His 103 included 11 fours. 

Ponting thus caught up with Sir Don Bradmans 29 centuries. Only Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, Steve Waugh and Brian Lara have more Test hundreds. 

Ponting shared stands of 97 with Justin Langer for the second wicket, and 101 with Damien Martyn, who scored 57. 

Ponting took guard just nine balls into the match and without a run on the board when Matthew Hayden drove expansively at a wide delivery from Makhaya Ntini and edged a catch to A.B. de Villiers at third slip. 

Ponting, who offered two chances in the first Test in Cape Town, was on five when he received his first let-off on Friday. After gloving a legside delivery from Ntini, the ball flew towards a diving Mark Boucher but the wicketkeeper failed to hold it. 

Langer and Ponting rode out the rest of the first hour in which the ball often deviated off the seam and they began to score more freely as lunch approached. 

Ponting was on 36 when he survived his second chance, an edge off Andre Nel that bisected Boucher and Graeme Smith at first slip.

 PCB objects to super league

Lahore: The PCB has said it will not support India, Australia and England forming a super league of their own in the ICCs Future Tours Programme (FTP) and will raise the matter in the ICC meeting in Dubai. 

India has been negotiating with the Australian and England boards to play more matches in the six-year international cycle of matches, a senior PCB official was quoted as saying in a Pakistan daily on Tuesday. 

Obviously, we dont support giving same number of matches to weaker nations like Zimbabwe and Bangladesh but at the same time we also dont support stronger cricket nations forming their own league, he said objecting to the move to have their own sequence of matches in the FTP. This matter is going to be raised at the chief executives meeting. 

The official said the PCB had been sent a revised FTP by the ICC in which matches were rescheduled for the three nations as per their requirements. 

Weve been sent a revised FTP by the ICC that has India, England and Australia scheduling matches according to their own requirements. 

This FTP is different from the one that was agreed upon in principle the last time the FTP was discussed at the ICC level by all member countries, he said. 

The England and Australian boards have confirmed being approached by the Indians to chalk out a schedule within the FTP which includes more Tests and ODIs featuring the nations. 

The original FTP included more or less equal number of home and away series between all the ten Test playing nations. 

Meanwhile, it was confirmed on Tuesday that Shoaib Akhtar wont be available for next months tour of Sri Lanka. The quick was diagnosed with a stress fracture in the left ankle and it was announced on Mondat that he wont take part in the remainder of the ODI series versus India.

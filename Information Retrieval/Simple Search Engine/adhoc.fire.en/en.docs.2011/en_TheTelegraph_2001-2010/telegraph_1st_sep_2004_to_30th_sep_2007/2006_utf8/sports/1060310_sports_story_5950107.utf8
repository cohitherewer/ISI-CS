 Im not a happy bloke at all

 - Pietersen rues being dismissed for 64

 Kumble celebrates Bells dismissal on Thursday 

Chandigarh: Kevin Pietersen is a disappointed man. He did the spadework with a well-compiled 64 on Thursday and looked set for a lot more when an uppish drive led to his doom. 

The dismissal queered Englands pitch on the opening day of the second Test. 

Ive been in real good zone these past couple of days? I was infuriated after being dismissed on 87 last week. Honestly? Im bitterly disappointed. Im not a happy bloke tonight? Im not a happy bloke at all. At the end of the day I would have loved to be 64 not out and not 64 out, he rued. 

Battling a stomach bug caused by not prawns but spaghetti, his concentration could have been disturbed owing to an unscheduled toilet stop before his dismissal. The thought of coming off for a while had also crossed his mind. 

Pietersen said the wicket was a typical first-day one. It was skidding at one end while the pace was dual at the other. 

We had set a target of around 400 in the first innings. And we are 240 short now? The boys down the order are in pretty good form. It will be a case of applying ourselves, he explained. 

Pietersen was happy for Andrew Flintoff whose wife gave birth to a baby boy in the hours before the start. Hes real jovial, he informed. So hopefully we can do him a favour this week and do England a favour and do real well in this Test. 

The flamboyant batsman said he always sets out to be positive against the spinners. This is something Ive learned from the Ashes series. I remember playing against Shane (Warne) and going a bit soft and he calling the shots. From then on I decided I would never allow the spinners to dictate terms. Its a case of getting on top and working the ball in the gaps, he explained. 

Pietersen walloped debutant Piyush Chawla for a four and a six off consecutive deliveries. I feel a little bit sorry for the little kid but thats just how I play spinners, he quipped. 

Meanwhile, it was learnt that Flintoff may return home after the third Test to be with his wife and newborn baby. He will be back in time for the one-day series.

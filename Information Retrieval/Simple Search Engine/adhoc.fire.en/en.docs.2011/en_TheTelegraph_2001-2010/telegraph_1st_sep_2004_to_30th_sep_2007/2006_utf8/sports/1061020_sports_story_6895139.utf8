 Bengal to meet Kerala in semis

 - Santosh Trophy 

Gurgaon: A solitary goal by Adil Ansari midway through the second half was enough to see four-time champions Maharashtra pip Tamil Nadu 1-0 and advance to the semi-finals of the Santosh Trophy here on Thursday. 

Maharashtra joined Kerala, who had to work hard to beat Karnataka 2-1. 

In the semi-finals on Sunday, 29-time champions Bengal, who last won the title in 1998, take on five-time winners Kerala, who won the title two years ago 

The other clash would see Maharashtra, who last became national champions in 1999, take on six-time winners Punjab, who last tasted success in 1987. 

In the quarter final league encounter between Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Ansari scored the winner in the 65th minute when his unchallenged header off a Steven Dias cross found the net. 

Tamil Nadu could not find the required edge in their attacks even after starting brightly. In the 12th minute, Raman Vijayan received a great cross from the left but failed to keep his shot down with only the goalkeeper Subhashish Roy Choudhury to beat. 

Then L. Johnnys powerful shot went just wide off the Maharashtra upright. 

But Maharashtra, who needed only a draw to advance to the semi-finals, refused to bow to the pressure and tried to search for their chances. The first big opportunity for them came at the half-hour mark when Abhishek Yadav went through a maze of Tamil Nadu defenders but his shot was blocked by keeper VP Sathish Kumar. 

That ignited the Maharashtrians fighting spirit and Dias first tested the keeper with a shot from the right edge of the box. His next long ranger had the custodian clutching at thin air only to see the shot rebound off the upright. 

Earlier, Kerala overcame a one-man deficit to beat Karnataka 2-1 to secure their passage to the last four. Ebin Rose was shown the red card for a second booking. 

Kerala took the lead in the 16th minute when Karnataka keeper N. Venkatesh (senior) misread the flight of a cross from KS Joby and came off his line to collect it. But, the ball swerved in and went into the net. 

In the 34th minute Jean Christian fumbled a Xavier corner and put it into his own net. The five-time champions got a penalty when R. Rajesh was brought down in the box in the 86th minute and NP Pradeep slotted home the winner. (PTI)

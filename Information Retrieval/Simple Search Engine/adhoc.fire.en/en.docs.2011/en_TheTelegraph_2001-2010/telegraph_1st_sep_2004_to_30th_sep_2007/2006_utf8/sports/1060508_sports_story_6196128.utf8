 - BCCI to wait for Glosters report but? 

 Sachin 

Mangalore: Sachin Tendulkar said on Sunday that he was fit and looking forward to play in the Test series against the West Indies starting on June 2. 

I am fit now. I am looking forward to the West Indies tour, Sachin said in an informal chat with reporters at Subramanya, 70km from here. 

Sachin is here on a two-day visit to perform religious rituals at various temples. 

Asked about the burn-out issue, the 33-year-old said every player needs rest to re-energise himself. To another question, he said performance and not the age should be the criteria for selection. 

Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said a decision on Sachins availability for the Test series against the West Indies will be known after physio John Gloster submits his report. 

Gloster is expected to examine Sachin next week and based on his report, BCCI would take a decision on the master batsman. 

Sachin, who missed Indias recent one-day series against England, arrived here on Saturday afternoon and visited Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala where the family had a darshan of lord Majunatheshwara. (PTI)

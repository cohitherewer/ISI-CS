 Promoters allege perjury

West Palm Beach (US): Attorneys for a pair of promoters suing tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams and their father accused the trio of committing perjury, on Tuesday. 

In a motion filed in Palm Beach County circuit court, the attorneys accused the sisters of a repeated pattern of deception and falsehood. 

Promoters Carol Clarke and Keith Rhodes, owners of a company called CCKR, alleged that the sisters father, Richard Williams, signed a contract on their behalf committing his daughters to play in a 2001 Battle of the Sexes match. The promoters claim they lost millions of dollars after the sisters reneged on the deal. 

Despite tax returns that show payments to Richard Williams for management fees, Venus and Serena Williams have both testified that their father has never been their manager and had no authority to commit them to a deal. (AP)

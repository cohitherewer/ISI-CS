 Campbell looks ready for a fight

 Sol Campbell 

Question marks have hung over the future of Sol Campbell with club and country for more than two months, but the Arsenal defender answered such doubts during the 1-1 draw against Portsmouth at Fratton Park last night. He was bloodied, battered and bruised on his return to first-team football, but showed emphatically that he still has the stomach for a fight. 

Campbell, 31, had not played for Arsenal since walking out at half-time in the 2-3 home defeat against West Ham in February. However, he showed against Portsmouth that he has sorted out his psychological problems and is fit for the challenge. 

It was good news, too, for Sven-G?ran Eriksson, with Campbell ready to challenge Rio Ferdinand and John Terry for a starting place in the World Cup finals this summer. England should be healthier for the competition in central defence. 

Campbell suffered a cut above his right eye early in the second half as a result of a stray elbow from Benjani Mwaruwari. After receiving treatment, he returned to the pitch. A minute from time, however, he had to go off with a bloody nose after an aerial clash with Svetoslav Todorov, another Portsmouth striker. 

I dont know if the nose was broken, Ars?ne Wenger, the Arsenal manager, said. 

[Wenger confirmed on Thursday that Campbell had broken his nose, reports Reuters] 

I thought Sol did well in the first half but he was handicapped by his first injury in the second. Until the injuries he did very well. I think he showed tonight that he can play for England, but Ill leave that decision to Sven. 

It was on February 1 at Highbury when, with Arsenal trailing 1-2 to West Ham, Campbell admitted to Wenger that he could not go on. Having been partly responsible for both West Ham goals, Campbells thinking had become such a fog that he felt he had to get away. He showered, changed, left the dressing-room and was next spotted in Belgium. 

Once his clarity of thought had returned, Campbell suffered leg and foot injuries which, along with the imperious form of Philippe Senderos and Kolo Tour? in central defence as Arsenal sauntered into the semi-finals of the Champions League, further delayed his comeback.

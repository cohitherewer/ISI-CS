The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Player of the Final

 Andrea Pirlo 

Andrea Pirlo reserved his best for the biggest match of all, the World Cup final. Comfortable in either a defensive, controlling midfield role or in a more advanced position, Pirlo was a key actor in Italys historic victory over France via shoot-out after 120 minutes of intense football failed to break the 1-1 deadlock. 

While he was alert in defence, he was also the man behind Italys equaliser. And then, in the tie-breaker, he displayed ice-cool temperament in score past Barthez. 

Just as he did against Germany, Pirlo also added the attacking dimension that Italy needed with Francesco Totti smothered by Frances own defensive midfield pairing. 

A dead ball specialist, he is the first-choice taker of corners and free kicks. Pirlo took virtually all of the set-pieces for the Azzurri, including the magnificent outswinging corner that Marco Materazzi headed home in the 19th minute to equalise Zidanes seventh-minute penalty. 

At the same time, he combined with fellow AC Milan midfielder Gennaro Gattuso to frustrate Frances Zinedine Zidane and Franck Ribery, severely limiting their ability to create chances for Thierry Henry, who was restricted to just two shots in 106 minutes. 

But Pirlos best came during the tie-breaker. With the eyes of the world focused on him, Pirlo stepped up to convert the first spot-kick for Italy, setting them on the path to their 5-3 shoot-out win.

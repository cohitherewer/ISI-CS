 Id quit cricket for my kids, says Warne

Melbourne: Leading Test wicket taker Shane Warne has said he would quit cricket altogether if his three children become affected by his pending divorce from wife Simone. 

If they start to get affected then everything will stop, Warne told a newspaper in Australia on Sunday. Id have to stop everything. 

With everything you do, unfortunately there are some sacrifices you have to make. 

For me, playing international cricket for Australia and doing the best I can for a long period of time, my kids are the ones who miss out on some dad time. 

Its not to say they dont get time ? they get a lot and Ive had a lot of impact on them growing up.

 Two-stroke lead for Jeev

 - JAPAN OPEN 

 Jeev Milkha fired a six-under 65 

Kawagoe: Jeev Milkha Singh fired a brilliant six-under 65 to take a two-shot lead after the opening round of the Japan Open here on Thursday. 

The 34-year-old Indian star, who returned here after a weeks holiday in Chandigarh, seemed fresh and relaxed as he pushed to the second place Japanese superstar and Order of Merit leader Shingo Katayama at the Kasumigaseki Country Club West Course. 

Jeev, who is having his finest year in the circuit, had a dream start in the flagship event of the Japanese Tour with two birdies on the first two holes and a third on par-5 sixth to turn in three-under needing just 13 putts for the first stretch. 

On the back nine, he opened with another birdie on par-5 tenth but then dropped his only bogey of the day on 11th. But from 14th to 16th, he had a hattrick of birdies and finished the day at six-under. 

Jeev later said: Ive been playing and feeling good right through the season. After the win in Volvo China Open, I have had lots of top ten finishes in Japan, Asia and Europe, which have shown that I am contending and am in the mix. So, as long as I am contending over the weekend, more wins will come. 

Jeev is currently 14th in the top money earners list in Japan, besides being the leader in Asia and in top-50 in Europe. 

Katayama had five birdies and one bogey, while three players Tetsuji Hiratsuka, Paul Sheehan and Yoshiaki Mano were tied third at three-under 68.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bad day for Chelsea

Chicago: Chelseas pre-season programme got off to a disappointing start when they lost 0-1 to the Major League Soccer All-Stars and midfielder Joe Cole suffered a knee injury on Saturday. 

The only goal at Toyota Park, just outside Chicago, came from Canadian international Dwayne De Rosario, who beat reserve goalkeeper Hilario with a shot from 18 metres in the 70th minute. 

The game marked the end of the English champions trip to the US, which included a weeklong training camp in Los Angeles. Manager Jose Mourinho said the tough workouts had taken their toll on his players legs. 

The team with the better conditioning won the game. They were faster, sharper and able to play at a high level going against a team that was tired, slow and it was difficult for our players to go 45 minutes. It was not a surprise, Mourinho said. 

England international Cole limped off with a knee injury five minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute. He left the stadium on crutches and will undergo tests when the squad returns to London. 

For me, Cole is the real problem of the day, Mourinho said. Im not a doctor, its not my job. But everybody is worried. 

New signings Michael Ballack and Andriy Shevchenko both started the game. Shevchenko, still recovering from a knee injury, looked rusty while Ballack began his new midfield partnership with Frank Lampard. 

Ballack put striker Didier Drogba through on goal in the 28th minute, but the Ivorians effort was ruled out for off-side. 

Youngsters Salomon Kalou and Jon Obi Mikel both appeared for the first time in a Chelsea shirt in the second half, two of Mourinhos six substitutions at the break. 

Only Lampard, John Terry, Michael Essien and Geremi played the full game.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB stands by Dalmiya

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The CAB decided 

 to stand by its president Jagmohan Dalmliya in its working 

 committee meeting on Wednesday.

 One of the agendas of the meeting 

 was to decide on the suspension letter served on Dalmiya 

 by BCCI president Sharad Pawar. The CAB president, however, 

 decided to skip Wednesdays meeting as it would have 

 been embarrassing for the working committee members to discuss 

 the suspension issue freely in his presence.

 We have expressed our solidarity 

 towards our president and we will support him in his troubled 

 times, said CAB joint secretary Amitava Banerjee.

 The committee also decided to 

 support the 18 District Sports Associations by helping them 

 to prepare a 10-station multigym and a concrete pitch.

 Blatter setback for Brazil

 2014 World Cup

 Rio De Janeiro: Brazil 

 still has a long way to go before thinking of hosting the 

 2014 World Cup, Fifa president Sepp Blatter has said.

 In an interview to a Brazilian 

 newspaper on Thursday, Blatter said the country lacks even 

 a single stadium, which can match World Cup standards. South 

 America is due to stage the 2014 tournament under the new 

 system, beginning in 2010, in which Fifa rotates the tournament 

 between continents.

 The 10 South American federations 

 have already decided to back Brazil as their only candidate.

 But Blatter said that did not 

 necessarily mean that the tournament would be in Brazil, 

 which previously staged a World Cup in 1950.

 Theres still a long 

 way to go before Brazil can host a World Cup, said 

 Blatter.

 Today, its just an 

 idea which, with the support of President Luiz Inacio Lula 

 da Silva, has started to become a sort of project. But theres 

 a long way to go before winning the approval of the Fifa 

 Congress in 2008.

 For the time being, I dont 

 think Brazil has a stadium for the Cup, added Blatter, 

 who said he had visited stadiums in Rio de Janeiro, Sao 

 Paulo and Porto Alegre.

 We know the South American 

 federations have already said that there will be only one 

 candidate and that candidate will be Brazil, he said.

 But why not have a joint 

 bid between Argentina and Chile? The problem is that, even 

 being the only candidate, Brazil has to reach the standards, 

 which are of a very high level.

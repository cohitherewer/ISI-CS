 Justine tops

Madrid: Belgiums Justine Henin-Hardenne claimed her first WTA Championship title when she beat Amelie Mauresmo 6-4, 6-3 in the final on Sunday. 

It couldnt have been better, especially as it was doubtful as to whether I would even take part this year, said Henin-Hardenne, who will succeed Mauresmo as world No.1 when the years final rankings list is released on Monday. 

Earlier, Lisa Raymond and Samantha Stosur retained their doubles title when they beat Cara Black and Rennae Stubbs 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. The win ensured they will end the year at No. 1.

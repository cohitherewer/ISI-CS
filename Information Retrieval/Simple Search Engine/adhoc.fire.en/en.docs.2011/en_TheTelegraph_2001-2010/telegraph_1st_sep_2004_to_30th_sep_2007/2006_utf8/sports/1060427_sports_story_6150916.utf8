 Warne may testify in murder trial

Melbourne: Australias ace leg spinner Shane Warne may be called to give evidence in the trial of a taxi driver charged with the murder of a teenage passenger, the Melbourne magistrates court heard on Wednesday. 

Rajbinder Singh Shahi, 28, is charged with killing 17-year-old Xavier Salmon by running him down after a dispute in December last year. 

Defence counsel Paul Duggan told a committal hearing on Wednesday that Warne saw a group of teenagers misbehaving in Shahis taxi prior to the incident. 

Duggan said he may call him if the matter goes to trial in the Victorian Supreme Court. 

Wednesdays hearing was told the teenagers riding in Shahis taxi abused and threw candy at Warne after he wound down his car window to say hello to them.

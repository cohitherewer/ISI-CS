 ECB to review Trescothick pullout

London: The ECB will conduct a thorough review of the circumstances which led to Marcus Trescothicks pullout from the Ashes. 

The whole issue will be discussed at length but I need a full understanding of everything before things can be taken any further, England chairman of selectors David Graveney was quoted as saying in a paper. 

Trescothick, who returned home Wednesday following a recurrence of stress-related problems, had to be consoled for two hours by a doctor in the dressing room before boarding the flight for England. 

It appears that the ace batsman quit the Ashes tour since the England management refused to allow him to bring his family out to Australia early. 

His decision left the touring party in disarray with the first Test only eight days away and raises doubts if the 30-year-old cricketer will ever play for England again.

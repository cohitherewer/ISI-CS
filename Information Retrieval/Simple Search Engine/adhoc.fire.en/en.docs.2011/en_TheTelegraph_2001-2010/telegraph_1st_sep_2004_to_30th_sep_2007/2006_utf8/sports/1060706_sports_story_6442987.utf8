 - European Open

Kildare (Ireland): Jeev Milkha Singh took another trip from Japan to Europe to get ready to tee off at the Smurfit European Open on Thursday. 

The Indian ace, who currently leads the standings on the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit, will be accompanied by compatriot Jyoti Randhawa in the tournament. 

Jeev has been paired with Stuart Little and Anders Hansen, while Randhawa plays the first two days with Jarmo Sandelin and Alexandre Rocha. 

Jeev is playing his 12th week in a row, including the 36-hole qualifier for the US Open and has played in three continents in this period, ranging from China, Japan and Korea in Asia to United Kingdom in Europe and New York. 

I am enjoying myself and am in good touch, said Jeev, who has had eight top-10 finishes in 18 tournaments this year. 

A star-studded cast will tee up at the European Open, which includes the Irish trio of Darren Clarke, Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley, who will be hoping to play lead roles as they go in search of valuable Ryder Cup points. 

They are also in the race for a share of the record ?2.4 million prize money, and the second home victory in the tournaments history. 

Also in the field are past champions and former US Open winners Michael Campbell (New Zealand), Retief Goosen (South Africa), 2005 champion Kenneth Ferrie, John Bickerton, Paul Broadhurst, Paul Casey, Ian Poulter and Lee Westwood (all England), Angel Cabrera (Argentina), Miguel Angel Jimenez (Spain), Colin Montgomerie (Scotland), 2003 winner Phillip Price (Wales) and Henrik Stenson (Sweden).

London: Justine-Henin Hardenne reached her second Wimbledon final on Thursday when she out-hit fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters 6-4, 7-6 on Centre Court. 

Second seed Clijsters, who has now fallen at the semi-final stage of all three Grand Slam tournaments this year, had plenty of chances but wavered under a barrage of fierce hitting. 

US Open champion Clijsters has now lost her last five Grand Slam meetings with Henin-Hardenne, including the semi-final at Roland Garros last month. 

Among men, second seed Rafael Nadal ground down Finlands Jarkko Nieminen 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Thursday to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals and set up a meeting with Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 

The match was held over from Wednesday because of rain. 

Double French Open champion Nadal, looking more and more comfortable on unfamiliar grass courts, wore down Nieminens resistance in long baseline rallies, breaking his serve in each set. 

The 20-year-old Nadal is the seventh youngest Wimbledon semi-finalist and first Spaniard to get this far since Manuel Orantes in 1972. Hes challenging to become the first player to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year since Bjorn Borg in 1980. 

Frances Amelie Mauresmo survived a mid-match slump to reach her first Wimbledon final with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Russian Maria Sharapova on Thursday. 

The world No. 1 led 6-3, 3-1 before 2004 champion Sharapova reeled off five successive games to force a third set in an enthralling semi-final tussle on Centre Court. 

Mauresmo recovered her rhythm in the decider, though, and will face French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne in Saturdays final, a repeat of this years Australian Open final which she won after the Belgian retired with a stomach upset. 

The 26-year-old top seed had lost in the semi-finals on her last three visits to Wimbledon and she greeted victory by tearing round the court in jubilant relief. 

Sania Mirzas campaign came to an end with her mixed doubles loss on Wednesday. 

American duo Bob Bryan and Venus Williams defeated fourth seeds Leander Paes and his Australian partner Samantha Stosur 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 in the quarter finals on Thursday. 

Sania and Pavel Vizner of the Czech Republic went down fighting 3-6, 7-5, 2-6 to Canadian Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva of Russia in another third round match. 

Martina Navratilova took her final bow at the Wimbledon on Thursday after failing in her bid to set a record for All England Club titles. The 49-year-old, unbeatable in her heyday on Wimbledon grass where she won a record nine singles titles, lost 7-5 6-1 alongside Mark Knowles on Thursday in the third round of the mixed doubles to Vera Zvonareva and Andy Ram. 

Navratilova turns 50 in October and has said 2006 will be her last year on the circuit.

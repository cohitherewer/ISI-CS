 Shiv Kapur crashes out 

Zandvoort (The Netherlands): Shiv Kapur was unable to effectively tackle the swirling winds, torrential rain and lengthy play interruptions and eventually crashed out of the KLM Open with a second successive round of four-over 75 at the Kennemer Golf amp; Country Club here. 

He totalled eight-over 150 for two days to miss out on the weekend action. 

Soren Kjeldsen was clubhouse leader at six-under 138. 

Kapur started on the back nine and had bogeys on the 12th, 17th and 18th. On the front nine, he dropped a shot on the first but birdied the second and third. He closed with two more bogeys on eighth and ninth.

 Nesta doubtful versus Ukraine

 Ballack didnt train with the squad 

Duisburg: Italys injured central defender Alessandro Nesta is very doubtful for Fridays World Cup quarter final against Ukraine. 

Nesta missed Monday match versus Australia after a troublesome groin injury flared up in the final group match against Czech Republic and team doctor Enrico Castellacci said he was unlikely to be fit to face the Ukrainians in Hamburg. 

It wont be easy, Castellacci told reporters, He is following our programme and is improving but it is gradual. We said we would try and get him back as quickly as possible but we want to avoid any other problems for the lad, he said. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack and striker Miroslav Klose did not train with the rest of the German squad on Tuesday but a DFB spokesman said their absence was not due to any injury, adds a report from Berlin. 

Ballack is doing a full workout today but due to fitness reasons and regeneration methods without a ball, said a spokesman for the German soccer association (DFB). 

With Klose its the exact same thing, Voigt added. The boys are doing special individual training programmes today. 

He said Ballack and Klose were training at a separate location in Berlin. 

Ballack had missed training on Sunday morning because of a minor injury to his right foot but coach Juergen Klinsmann said on Monday he had recovered and was perfectly fit. 

Voigt also said reserve goalkeeper Oliver Kahn would not train with the rest of the team. (Agencies)

 Poutchkova ends Sania run

Tashkent: Sania Mirza crashed out against a lower seed Russian opponent in the quarter finals of the $145,000 Tashkent Open here on Friday. 

The Indian, seeded third, was upset by sixth seed Olga Poutchkova 4-6, 6-4, 0-6. It was another inconsistent performance by Sania, who said she never really adjusted to the conditions at the Tashkent Tennis Centre. 

Sometimes you dont get used to the conditions and then you dont win said Sania, who admitted that she was low on confidence. The balls were flying, I just didnt get to feel the ball on my racket... I havent been feeling the ball in the last three matches. 

There were some 20-25 times in the match when I wanted to go for a winner but I didnt have the confidence to go for it, I just kept pushing the ball back, she said. Sanias discomfort was visible during the 1-hour, 42-minute match, in which there were 14 breaks of serve. 

Poutchkova, semi-finalist at the recent WTA Calcutta Open, then double-faulted three times to drop serve in the next game. That triggered a mini revival, Sania winning the next five games to take the set. During the six-game winning streak, she seemed to have regained some confidence and the winners flowed from her racket. 

But Poutchkova recovered quickly and won the key points in the early games of the third set. 

Sania eventually threw in the towel when, after rallying from 0-40 down in the fourth game, she was again broken and went 4-0 down in the set. 

It was a weird match, Sania said.

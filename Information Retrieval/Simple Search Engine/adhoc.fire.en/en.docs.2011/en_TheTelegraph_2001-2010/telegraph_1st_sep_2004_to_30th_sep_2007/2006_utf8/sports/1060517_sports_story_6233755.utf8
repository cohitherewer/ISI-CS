 Were moving in right direction: Jayanta

 - Korean coachs decision to quit a great loss

New Delhi: Jayanta Talukdar has no regret about the fact that he doesnt get noticed when he walks on the road. Three days after striking a gold in the first of the four-leg World Archery Championships at Porec in Croatia, the 20-year-old from Assam feels archers will have to go a long way before they could be household names in India. 

Even yesterday, when I landed in Delhi from Croatia, someone at the airport asked me about the sport I play. When I told him it was archery, the man simply didnt understand. I had to explain to him at length what it was all about, said Talukdar jokingly. 

But now that he is a star after winning a gold at the world meet, will he pursue the sport more vigorously? A soft spoken Talukdar stopped for a moment and then protested. I was attracted to archery from my childhood days and wanted to be an archer all through. I never wanted to play cricket or tennis, believe me. 

Talukdar, who comes from a well-to-do business family, joined the Tata Archery Academy five-and-half years ago in December, 2000. My elder brother Nikhilesh was a good archer, but couldnt progress much because of lack of facilities. So, when I got selected by the Tata coaches, I persuaded my parents to allow me to go to Jamshedpur. 

Since then, the Guwahati youngster never had to look back. A team silver in the Junior World Cup in Munich in 2004, followed by another team silver in the senior World Cup at Spain next year made him one of the most promising names in Indian archery. 

What happened in Croatia was a dream come true. I was confident of winning a medal, but not the gold, confessed Talukdar. 

In the semi-finals, he was a clear underdog against top seed Italian Marco Galiazzo, but managed to pip the former World Championship gold medallist. In the medal round, he defeated Magnus Petersson of Sweden by threespoints. 

The Assam boy is confident that he would do well in the next three Grand Prixs, too, at Turkey, China and Mexico, respectively, to be held between June to August. 

Under coaches like Dharamvir Tiwari and Poornima Prasad, we are moving in the right direction. There is no reason why we wont be able to progress further at the world level, he said.

Port-of-Spain: Poor cricket fetches poor results. While Rahul Dravid has suffered his first ODI series loss since getting the Team India captaincy full time, last October, Greg Chappell has had to swallow the West Indies have forgotten to win bit. Worse, weve slipped two places, to No.5, in the ICC rankings. 

Brian Lara described Chappells comment as very sly and, having sealed the Digicel series 3-1, wants to beat India in the final ODI (Sunday) with an XI which may not be at full strength. That will be the West Indies captains last ? and very emotional ? one-day appearance at the Queens Park Oval. 

It could also be Laras final outing here in the West Indies colours. The ground was far from full on Friday, when the West Indies won by six wickets and six overs to spare, but Trinis are expected to turn out in bigger numbers and salute a living legend. 

We were outplayed in all departments, accepted Dravid, who had no answer as to why his batsmen havent been able to put away non-specialist spinners Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels. 

The myth that Indians are the best players of spin has been despatched to the Atlantic. 

Then, the captain was unconvincing when he spoke about some of us taking time getting used to the slow wickets. One can understand if the problem is with bouncy tracks in Australia or wickets in England in the first half of the summer, but no team from the subcontinent should be at a loss in the West Indies. 

Clearly, the learning process cant continue indefinitely and Messrs Dravid and Chappell (as also chief selector Kiran More) must review the decision to keep former captain Sourav Ganguly out of the picture totally and Anil Kumble out of the ODIs. 

After three last over finishes in succession, match No.4 was an anti-climax. Dravid, however, insisted his team wasnt deflated. Its not nice to lose a series, but were taking lessons from the result... Its part of the journey and, when we trip, we get up and dust ourselves and move on... One learns to cope with defeat, he said. 

 Asked whether the five bowlers strategy would be reviewed, Dravid answered: Its not written in stone... It may change as we keep reviewing... Weve been expecting (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni and Irfan (Pathan) to deliver in a bigger way as were playing just five specialist batsmen... 

Perhaps, its not insignificant that the match won by India is the one in which the captain himself scored big ? 105, in the first face-off. After that, he has managed 11, 0 and 15. Dhoni, by the way, is now the only batsman to average 50-plus and boast a strike-rate in excess of 100. 

Looking back, Dravid remarked we regret the loss of the second ODI. The West Indies won by a single run when Dwayne Bravo ended Yuvraj Singhs brilliant innings on the third last ball. We let it slip away, he rued. 

The West Indies havent looked back after pulling off that spectacular at Sabina Park. We want to keep collecting the higher ranked teams, quipped Lara. The hosts began the series at No.8, five below India. That gulf has reduced. 

While the batsmen havent been getting enough, another reason of concern is Pathans bowling. He hasnt been getting the length right... He isnt a pacy bowler, but relies on hitting the right length... He has been bowling a bit short, but is a quick learner, Dravid pointed out. 

If Bravo did it with the ball last week, this time, he produced an all-round performance: Three for 32 and an unbeaten 61 (62 balls, 3x4, 1x6). He had to be the MoM, even though Lara scripted a fantastic 69, which included 14 runs off Harbhajan Singhs last over. 

We do know what Lara is capable of... For me, his was the match-winning innings... He steadied the boat and, then, shifted gears, coach Bennett King told The Telegraph. 

Bravo acknowledged hed been under pressure to deliver with the bat. Id been struggling, but the captain and coach still showed so much confidence and sent me at No.5... That lifted my own confidence... 

He has, of course, perfected the slower ball and the West Indies are bound to rely on him rather heavily during the 2007 World Cup. 

Meanwhile, hot-shot sports psychologist Dr Rudi Webster, who has worked with Clive Lloyd, Sir Viv and Lara, has begun his week-long assignment with the Indians. I hope the players benefit... Rudi knows the mental side of the game so well... One meeting wont change anything, but the players are going to get another dimension, Dravid observed. 

John Wright had roped in Dr Sandy Gordon. Chappells thinking is different. 

No change in XI 

Talking to the Media on Friday, Dravid had indicated Robin Uthappa would make the XI in the final ODI, but a well-placed source informed there wouldnt be a change.

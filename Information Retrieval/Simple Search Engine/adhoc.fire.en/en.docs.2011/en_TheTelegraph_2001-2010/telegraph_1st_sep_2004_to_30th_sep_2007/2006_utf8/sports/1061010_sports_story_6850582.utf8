 Mushtaq hurt and angry

New Delhi: Mushtaq Ahmed has said he was hurt and angry after being sacked as assistant coach just hours before the team left for the Champions Trophy in India. 

Mushtaqs dismissal was effected by new chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Dr Nasim Ashraf. 

Although no explanation was given for the former spinners sacking, it is speculated that Mushtaqs close friendship with Inzamam-ul Haq was one of the reasons for his unceremonious exit. 

Obviously I am disappointed, in fact hurt and angry, Mushtaq was quoted as saying on the official website of the Champions Trophy. 

I will meet the PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf and find out the real reasons for my sacking As far as I know, I had done nothing wrong, he added. 

Mushtaq did not think that his sacking had anything to do with the six-year-old match-fixing allegations against him. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachins devotion to cricket separates him from the rest

 - THE OTHER DEBUTANT IN THE LAST INDO-PAK TEST IN KARACHI, WAQAR YOUNIS, LOOKS BACK 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Karachi: Sachin Tendulkar wasnt the only debutant when India last played a Test here ? in the same category was Waqar Younis. The former Pakistan captain and champion quick spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to Sundays face-off. 

The following are excerpts 

On his thoughts as he made his debut 

I can still recall the excitement... Much of it was because my debut was under my hero ? Imran Khan... I knew the National Stadium wicket would be sporting... Also knew kafi pressure rahe ga. 

On having got injured on debut itself 

(Laughs) Yes, I over-reached myself and hurt my back... Because of the excitement, I wanted to do everything in that one match... I suppose most young fast bowlers would do the same... I missed the next two Tests (Faisalabad, Lahore). 

On Sachin 

He had been projected as a wonder boy... I remember he had curly hair and, when he came to bat, most of us wondered how such a bachcha could play Test cricket... He looked every inch the schoolboy he was... I got him out cheaply (15) and our dressing room felt the hype around him was misplaced. 

On whether the teams opinion changed during the Sialkot Test, when Sachin didnt retire despite being hit on the nose by him 

Indeed, yes.. He showed guts, showed character on a green top... Any other 16-year-old would have run to the dressing room and returned after regaining some confidence... Sachin stayed put and scored a fifty (57). 

On whether he expected Sachin to achieve greatness 

Not to the extent he has... His determination needs to be applauded... His mental toughness as well... He has proved to the world that hes the best... Thirty-five Test hundreds... Boy, thats something... 

Finally, on what separates Sachin from the rest 

His determination... His devotion to cricket... Sachin to game ki puja karta hai and thats why he gets the rewards... What I particularly like about him is that he has remained level-headed... Hes a top human being as well.

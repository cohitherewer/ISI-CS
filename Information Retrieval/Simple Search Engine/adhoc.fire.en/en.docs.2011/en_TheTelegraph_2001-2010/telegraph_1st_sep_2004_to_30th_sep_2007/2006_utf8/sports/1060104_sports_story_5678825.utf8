 Opening gives me confidence: Parthiv

Ahmedabad: Pakistan-bound wicketkeeper batsman Parthiv Patel said on Tuesday that opening the batting gave him confidence since he had batted in that position quite a number of times. 

Opening gives me confidence, said the diminutive player who made 47 as an opener for Gujarat in their Elite Group Ranji Trophy match against Mumbai on Tuesday morning. 

The wicketkeeper, who has opened for India several times including the Rawalpindi Test last year in which he made 65, said he was comfortable opening the innings as he had done it regularly for his team at the under-14 level. 

I was batting confidently. I am a bit disappointed about the manner in which I got out, Parthiv said adding that he was able to successfully negotiate the seaming ball on a green track. 

The ball was seaming in the morning and I had planned to get a big score under my belt which would have given me added confidence before the tour of Pakistan, Parthiv said. 

He said he was well aware that he was touring Pakistan as a second wicketkeeper but was ready to grab any opportunity during the Test series and make the most of it.

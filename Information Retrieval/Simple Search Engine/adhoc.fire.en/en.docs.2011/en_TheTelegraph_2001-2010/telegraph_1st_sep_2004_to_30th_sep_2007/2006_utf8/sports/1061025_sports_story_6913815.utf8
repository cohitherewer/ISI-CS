 Surprised Defoe wasnt sent off: Mascherano

London: Argentinas Javier Mascherano was surprised that Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe was not more severely punished for biting his arm in a Premier League match at the weekend, British media said on Tuesday. 

To receive a bite was the worst thing that has happened to me since I came to England, the West Ham United midfielder was quoted as saying. Things werent going well for me but this was unexpected and outrageous, he said of the incident at White Hart Lane during West Hams 1-0 defeat on Sunday. The strangest thing of the match was that the referee didnt send him off. 

A Football Association spokesman, however, was quoted as saying: Fifa regulations prevent us from taking retrospective action. 

The FA claim their hands are tied because Defoe was booked when he bit Mascherano on the arm after the Argentine brought him down from behind. Mascherano was also booked. 

Football pundits in Britain were also shocked that the England striker should get away with no more than a booking. Former Ireland striker Tony Cascarino said: I thought that I could never be shocked by anything in football but, once again, the sport has shown its ability to stun even the most battle scarred veteran.

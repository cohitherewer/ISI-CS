Bergisch Gladbach: With a second-round berth secured, Brazil are considering resting some of their players in their match against Japan on Thursday. 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said after Brazils 2-0win over Australia on Sunday that he was considering fielding reserve players to let some of the starters recover ahead of the second round. 

Ill talk to the medical staff (and) to the physical department to see how the players are, see how they are recuperating, Parreira said. Ill do whats best for the national team thinking ahead to the round of 16. 

A draw against Japan, coached by former Brazil player Zico, would secure first place in Group F for the defending champions. Japan must win to keep alive hopes of advancing.

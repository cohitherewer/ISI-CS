 FIA trims season to 17 races

 Ecclestone 

London: The Formula One calendar will be trimmed to 17 Grands Prix next year with Germany and Italy each losing one of their two races, the governing body said on Tuesday. 

The FIA said in a statement that the calendar had been approved by its World Motor Sport Council. 

While the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa-Francorchamps returns after being cancelled this year, there were no slots for either the San Marino or European Grand Prix. This years calendar had 18 races after a record 19 in 2005. 

No circuit details were given, leaving open the question of whether Hockenheim or the Nuerburgring would host the German Grand Prix. The Nuerburgring has hosted the European Grand Prix in recent years but is now expected to share the German round with Hockenheim on alternate years. 

Imola, the nearest circuit to Ferraris Maranello headquarters, has hosted the San Marino Grand Prix and is sure to disappear from the calendar with Monza the traditional home of the Italian race. 

After starting in Bahrain for the first time this year to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, the 2007 season kicks off in Australia on March 18. 

The US GP at Indianapolis, its future in doubt after the six-car fiasco of 2005 when all the Michelin-equipped teams pulled out, returns to the Brickyard for another year on June 17. Indianapolis Motor Speedway officials had already confirmed that a one-year deal had been struck with Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone. (REUTERS)

 Turkish GP organisers fined record $5 million

 - Threat of race being scrapped removed

London: Turkish Grand Prix organisers have been fined a record $5 million for a controversial podium ceremony at last months race, Formula Ones governing body said on Tuesday. 

A spokesman confirmed it was the biggest fine in motor racing history, eclipsing the $1 million meted out to then-champions Ferrari, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello after the Austrian Grand Prix debacle of 2002. 

The furore erupted after Turkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat, who was introduced to millions of viewers around the world as the President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, presented the winners trophy to Ferraris Brazilian Felipe Massa at the race in Istanbul. 

Tuesdays sanction, handed down at an extraordinary meeting of the International Automobile Federation (FIA)s World Motor Sport Council in Paris, will hit organisers heavily in the pocket but at least removed the threat of the race being stripped from next years calendar. 

The National Sporting Authority of Turkey (TOSFED) and the organisers of the Turkish Grand Prix (MSO) were charged with breaking the FIA statutes, the international sporting code and Formula One regulations. 

They FIA said in a statement they had been found guilty on all counts and the two organisations fined a combined total of $5 million. 

Cyprus has been split since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the northern part of the Mediterranean island after a brief, Greek-inspired coup. Only Turkey recognises the north. 

The FIA, representing 213 national motoring organisations from 125 countries, was concerned that Talats involvement may have compromised its political neutrality. 

Organisers said they invited Talat as a dignitary of international status and denied using the podium ceremony to gain political advantage. 

Meanwhile, Formula One teams have thrown a lifeline to Italys Imola circuit by agreeing to expand next years calendar from 17 to 18 races. 

The extra race is subject to approval by the FIAs Formula One commission and World Motor Sport Council. 

A 2007 calendar published by the FIA last month had just 17 rounds, after 18 this year and 19 in 2005, with Italy and Germany allocated just one race each and seemingly no room for a San Marino Grand Prix at Imola. 

Despite that, Ferraris home circuit had remained hopeful of a reprieve.

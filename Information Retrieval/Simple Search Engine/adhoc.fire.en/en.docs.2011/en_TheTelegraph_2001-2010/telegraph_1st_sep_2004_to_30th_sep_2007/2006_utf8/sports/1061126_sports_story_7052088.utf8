Brisbane: Australia built up a massive 626-run lead over England on the third day of the first Ashes Test on Saturday after passing up the opportunity of a quick kill in the series opener. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting had the option of enforcing the follow-on after England crumbled to 157 all out in reply to his teams first-innings total of 602 for nine declared, but decided for a slower, more punishing approach. 

Mindful that the second Test in Adelaide starts in just six days, Ponting decided to give his own bowlers a rest while sending Englands weary pacemen back into the field on a hot and humid Brisbane day. 

Pontings decision also allowed his toporder batsmen to get in some extra time in the middle and reinforce their dominance over England, who have made a disappointing start in their bid to retain the Ashes they won in 2005. 

When stumps were drawn, Australia were cruising along at 181 for one in their second innings with opener Justin Langer unbeaten on 88 and Ponting not out 51 after becoming just the ninth player to pass 9,000 Test runs. 

England did pick up the wicket of Matthew Hayden for 37 with the total on 68 when he was run out from a brilliant outfield thrown from James Anderson but an unbroken stand of 113 between Langer and Ponting left Australia poised to make an early declaration on Sunday. 

Englands first innings came to an abrupt end before tea after Glenn McGrath, playing his first Test in almost 11 months, demolished their batting line-up with six for 50. 

The 36-year-old silenced the critics who claimed he was too old to make a comeback by removing dangerman Kevin Pietersen before lunch then polishing off the tail in the middle session as the tourists lost their last seven wickets for 79. 

Ian Bell top-scored for England with 50 but the only other player to make at least 20 was left-arm spinner Ashley Giles, who made 24 before he was last man out. McGrath triggered the collapse when he trapped Pietersen lbw for 16 when the batsman failed to offer a shot to a ball that pitched outside off-stump and darted back in. 

Englands troubles deepened in the next over when Brett Lee dismissed England captain Andrew Flintoff for a duck, caught behind by Adam Gilchrist, though television replays suggested Lee may have overstepped the mark and a no-ball should have been called. 

Bell and Geraint Jones put on 47 for the sixth wicket to stall the Australian bowlers but the end came quickly once Jones fell lbw to McGrath.

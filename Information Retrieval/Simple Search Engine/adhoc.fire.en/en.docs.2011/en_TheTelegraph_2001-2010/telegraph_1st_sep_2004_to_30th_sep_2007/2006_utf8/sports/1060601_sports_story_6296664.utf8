New Delhi: There seems to be a ray of hope for Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje to play in the Champions Trophy in India later this year. The two South Africans, wanted by the Delhi Police in connection with match fixing, have received support from unexpected quarters on Wednesday when the International Cricket Council (ICC) agreed to play the role of facilitator for the two tainted cricketers. 

Speaking during the launch of ICCs official players rankings website (www.lgiccrankings.com), the general manager cricket operations, Dave Richardson said: We wont mind playing the role of a facilitator. 

The former South African cricketer, however, agreed that ICC has very little to do in this regard except for trying to assist the organisers of the Champions Trophy as well as the South African board. Basically, its a problem of the two individual cricketers and the South African board, he said. I am sure they have their lawyers advising them on this issue. 

Asked why there is no Indian umpires in the ICC panel, Richardson said they were not found upto the required world standard. Those who are good are there. The rest have been left out, he said. Richardson was confident that Indian umpires in future will make the elite panel. BCCI, I am sure, will take it as a challenge to improve the standard of Indian umpires. 

The former Test cricketer said that the proposal to refer appeals to third umpire had received mixed response. I should say the reaction has been pretty mixed. It is split 50-50 among the players, umpires, officials and even the media, he said. 

While Mark Benson of England said that he would be better off getting decisions verified, others feel they are better qualified to make the decisions on their own. The recommendations will be discussed at the ICC chief executives meeting in London in July. 

On Steve Bucknors comment, Richardson said: Bucknor said what he had to say but the ICC doesnt share his views. There is no evidence for his claims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I cant take it anymore: Bhowmick 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhowmick

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick was an angry man on Friday. 

Following their series of dismal performances first in Durand Cup, where they made an early-round exit in New Delhi; then faltering against Mohun Bagan playing a drab goalless draw in the 112th IFA Shield opener on Monday; and losing out to a Chinese youth team (Shenzen FC) Bhowmick said he had it enough with the black-and-white brigade. 

I cant take it anymore; leave me and bring in a new man (for the coachs post), the former East Bengal coach pleaded. Having given everything, if you dont get the desired output, its very tough to sink in. I had it enough. 

Asked whether he has got an offer from Mohun Bagan, pat came the reply from Bhowmick: Then I would have quit it right away. 

Earlier, the visibly-disappointed coach, who took over the job this season, lamented the lack of strikers in India. Its a sorry plight that we dont have strikers in India. Tell me, who scores the goals among Indians? he asked. Other than (Bhaichung) Bhutia nobody scores in India, while only the foreign-recruits shine. Its very hard to win the match with the available resources. 

About the 0-1 loss to Shenzen FC, Bhowmick chose to be pragmatic. A loss is a loss. Youve to accept it. However, having had so many easy chances, I feel that we should have won the match. Its very disappointing. 

Meanwhile, Bhowmicks Chinese counterpart, Zhang Jun was satisfied for his teams performance. Having come from a holiday (lay-off), our players who are quite young adjusted well to the conditions, which is a good sign ahead of the forthcoming China league, he said. 

Christiano signs for EB 

Christiano of Brazil signed for East Bengal on Friday. He will be available for selection for Mondays must-win match against Mahindra United.

Calcutta: Biswajit Bhattacharyas dream team got off to a nightmarish start in their Sahara CFL Premier Division title-defence, when Mohun Bagan lost 0-1 to Calcutta Port Trust at home on Monday. 

In the 86th minute, Mohun Bagan defender Deepak Mondal fumbled at deep defence, allowing Sujit Dey to get hold of a Tapan Maity cross from the deep. The Port Trust striker proceeded further, dodged past the advancing goalkeeper Subrata Paul and slotted the ball in coolly. 

It was an unexpected blow to Bhattacharya, who had vowed to put up a good show on being reappointed as Mohun Bagan coach. He also described his squad as the Dream Team. 

True, the Brazilian ball-charmer Jose Ramirez Barreto is yet to arrive, so is Eduardo Coelho. Key players like Mehtab Hussain and Mehrajuddin Wadao are still to reach cent per cent fitness level. Despite such handicaps, Mohun Bagan had enough experience at their disposal against a side, guided by their former coach Aloke Mukherjee. 

A packed gallery was anticipating fireworks from Bhaichung Bhutia. The agile strikers return to the green-and-maroon side and more importantly, to the local league (after skipping it for East Bengal last season), however, turned out to be a damp squib on a ground, which was soggy and littered with pools of mud. 

Wishing to see a free-flowing football match was, thus, a foolish idea. On the match-eve, Bhaichung had insisted that even Real Madrid or Brazil would not maintain their natural free-wheeling style of play on such poor conditions. How prophetic he was, proved at the end as Mohun Bagan were grounded much to the chagrin of home fans. 

Bhaichung did his bit in his own inimitable way ? the most notable being an acrobatic volley which just about missed the target. But he was otherwise well-marked by Rabindranath Sarkar and Soumen Sarkar, and sadly, the space the Port Trust deep defenders left in doing so could not be capitalised on by Bhaichungs teammates. 

The defeat also left in its trail some basic questions about the defending champions strategy. When the plan of playing in short passes didnt always lead to desired ends, long balls from the flanks looked more viable option. Bhattacharyas side hardly explored that route. 

It was in fact Port Trust who came close to scoring in the first-half. Mithun Naha delayed split of a second in unleashing his shot when a ball came to him following a right-wing cross from Maity, who was later adjudged Man-of-the-Match. 

Sanjeev Maria, captaining the home side in absence of Barreto, stretched his leg in the nick of time to deflect the ball off its goal-bound path. 

Ayan Chowdhury and Basudeb Mondals introduction in the second-half helped Mohun Bagan organise their play a little better, but Deepaks crucial slip in the end meant there was only one result: the fall of his team to Port Trust.

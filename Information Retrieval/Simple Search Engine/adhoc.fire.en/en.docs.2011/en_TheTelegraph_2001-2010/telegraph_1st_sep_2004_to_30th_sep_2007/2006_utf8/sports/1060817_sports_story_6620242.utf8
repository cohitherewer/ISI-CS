 Anju slips to joint eighth

New Delhi: A long lay-off from the international circuit has resulted in Anju Bobby George slipping one spot to joint eighth in the latest IAAF womens long jump rankings. 

The Keralite, who has been nursing a heel injury for the past few months, has had a forgettable season. She failed to repeat her last years performances, most notably a silver medal at the World Athletics finals in Monaco, which catapulted her to No.4 in the world rankings. 

The Russians dominate the long jump rankings, with Tatyana Kotova leading compatriots Oksana Udmurtova and Tatyana Lebedeva in the first three places.

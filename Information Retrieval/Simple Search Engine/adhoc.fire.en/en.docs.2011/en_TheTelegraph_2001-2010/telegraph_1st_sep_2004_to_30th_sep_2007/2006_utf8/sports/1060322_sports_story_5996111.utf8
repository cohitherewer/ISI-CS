 Randhawa falls 12 spots

New Delhi: Indian golfers below-par performances last week reflected on their world standings, pushing them down in the latest golf rankings list published on Monday. 

Jyoti Randhawa slipped 12 rungs to be 117th with 1.20 average points after failing to make the cut in the $1 million TCL Classic in China. Randhawa, however, still remains the highest ranked Indian. 

Arjun Atwal, who missed the cut for a second week in a row at the Bay Hill Invitational, lost two places to be 134th. His points tally was 1.10. Shiv Kapur moved down 17 places to 147th after he was a poor tied 41st in China.

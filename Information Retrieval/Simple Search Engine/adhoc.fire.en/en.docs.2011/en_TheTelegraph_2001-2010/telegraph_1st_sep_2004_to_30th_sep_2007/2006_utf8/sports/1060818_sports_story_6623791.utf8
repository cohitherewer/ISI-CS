The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswajit blames referee

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: After dropping points against George Telegraph, Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya pointed his finger at referee Debjit Das on Thursday. Some of his decisions went against us and that cost us the match, a fuming Bhattacharya said. 

Das was not his only target though. He also held his team responsible. We didnt get enough time to train together and that has become crucial, he remarked. Lack of communication prevented us from getting goals, otherwise we didnt play too badly, Bhattacharya stated. 

According to the coach, Bhaichung Bhutia had to be brought in even after playing the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia only 24 hours ago. I had no other option, but to play him to get the winner, he said. 

Bhattacharya, perhaps for the first time, was at the receiving end when the supporters hurled abuses at him after the dismal show. 

The Bagan coach, however, rued that his foreign recruits Eduardo Chakon Coelho, Jose Ramirez Barreto and Guy Ndem are still not in shape.

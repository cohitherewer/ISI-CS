 AIFF boost for Calcutta giants

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Saturdays executive committee meeting of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) proved to be a minor victory for the three Calcutta giants. Federation decided to allow them to use three foreign players in the Calcutta league, but said one of them has be a player of Indian origin. 

According to sources, the decision was taken soon after the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta placed his case in front of the committee saying that the Calcutta league would lose its sheen if the AIFF does not allow each team to recruit three foreign players. 

Tata Football Academy (TFA), who looked set to make a false start in the NFL got a reprieve when Das Munshi said that he has been assured by the TFA management of fielding a professional side with foreign recruits. TFA has been given a chance till August 15 to honour their decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shamed official faces expulsion from Fifa 

 Berlin: The ex-president of Botswana Football 

 Association who admitted selling World Cup tickets on the 

 black market is likely to become the first man forced to 

 resign from Fifas Executive Committee in its 102-year 

 history. 

 Ismail Bhamjee, 62, who admitted selling 12 tickets 

 at three times their face value for last weeks match 

 between England and Trinidad and Tobago in Nuremberg, has 

 been ordered to leave Germany as soon as possible by Fifa 

 president Sepp Blatter. 

According to Fifa sources, Blatter is so furious with the harm Bhamjee has done to the image of world soccers governing body, that he will force him to resign from the Executive Committee before his term of office expires in January. 

Bhamjee is facing formal investigations by Fifas Ethics Committee, Disciplinary Committee and Executive Committee. He was suspended from all his World Cup duties on Saturday. 

Markus Siegler, Fifas Director of Communications, said at Sundays daily media briefing: I do not know whether or not he is still in the country, but I imagine he will leave today or tomorrow (Monday). Formal proceedings will get going as soon as possible. 

It is deeply embarrassing when a high ranking official is involved in something like this. It puts Fifa in a very bad light. On the other hand, Fifa proved that we take these things very seriously and acted very quickly. 

I do not believe this incident will overshadow the great success of this World Cup, but it was not a nice day yesterday (Saturday) and it was a very big disappointment. 

Bhamjee had earlier signed a statement admitting selling 12 tickets for last Thursdays England match for 300 euros ($379.90) each, three times the face value, Fifa said in a statement. 

Executive committee members are paid $500 a day expenses while on official Fifa duty. In addition, they are paid $100,000 a year while members of the board. 

According to a British newspaper, who reported the incident to Fifa, Bhamjees problems began when he met a group of England fans in an Indian restaurant in Frankfurt last week. 

After telling them he was with Fifa, one of the fans reportedly asked him if he could get them tickets for the match against Trinidad and Tobago and he replied that he would. 

The fans then allegedly contacted a reporter who purchased the tickets from Bhamjee at his hotel suite. 

When told that his actions would be reported in the newspaper, Bhamjee was quoted as saying: I was actually trying to help someone else and I got into this mess and regret it very much. I will donate double the amount of money to charity. 

I could lose my pension because of this. Ive been a fool. Spare me. 

 Bhamjee was in any case due to leave the Fifa Executive 

 Committee next January after failing to be re-elected at 

 the congress of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) 

 in Cairo in January this year.

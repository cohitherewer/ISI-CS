 Uthappa replaces Gambhir

Margao: An hour before the selection committee meeting, Greg Chappell was asked about Sourav Gangulys chances of making the squad. Who knows, was the coachs reply. 

Chappell did not reveal his mind then, but at the selection meeting at the Taj Exotica an hour later, it was made clear to the national selectors again that the former India captain did not feature in his plans for the 2007 World Cup. 

While Sourav was ignored, Karanataka opener Robin Uthappa has come in place of Gautam Gambhir in the only change for the remaining four one-dayers of the current series and the two India-Pakistan matches in Abu Dhabi that follow. Uthappa had got a century in the last Challenger Trophy. 

Despite poor performance, Mohammed Kaif retains his place. BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said that once India seal the series, the squad could see a few more changes for the remaining matches. 

Selection committee chairman Kiran More said a few names were discussed but did not wish to go into specifics. 

He also defended Kaifs inclusion, saying he got a 90 odd in the Nagpur Test and will definitely make a comeback. Not everyone is going to click on all days. 

More was not forthcoming on the Sourav issue. The team is doing well. Everyone is an option, but we dont need too many changes. We are trying out different combinations... Dhoni can open or even Raina. 

Someone with more than 10,000 ODI runs surely deserves a better deal when the team is struggling with the opening slot in the absence of Sachin Tendulkar.

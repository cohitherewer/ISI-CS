 Confiscated tickets to be resold by CA

Melbourne: Thousands of Ashes tickets, some confiscated from illegal scalpers, are to be resold to a select group of Australian cricket supporters, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Thursday. 

The resale of over 34,000 tickets for the five Tests against England will be restricted to two per member of Australias Cricket Family (ACF), a scheme devised by CA to prevent English fans from hogging sales. 

The majority of the newly available tickets were returned from the likes of stakeholders such as the England and Wales Cricket Board, sponsors, and the Australian state bodies, CA said. (REUTERS)

 Renault boost for Fisichella

London: Renault have boosted Italian Giancarlo Fisichellas hopes of winning in front of his home fans at Imola on Sunday by giving him a more powerful engine than teammate Fernando Alonso. 

The Roman, tied second in the Formula One standings after three rounds, will get a new unit for the San Marino Grand Prix after completing the mandatory two races with the last one. 

Championship leader Alonso, winner at Imola last year on his way to the title, must continue with the engine that powered him to victory in Australia on April 2. 

Fisichella won with a fresh engine in Malaysia and hopes to return to the top at a circuit that gave him his first points in Formula One in 1997. (Reuters)

 Ronaldo needs time to get fit 

Madrid: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo will need another month of training before he is fully fit, according to first team coach Fabio Capello. 

He is working every day, he has lost some weight and has been doing some pretty good physical training, Capello told a news conference on Saturday. But I think he will need another month before he is fully fit. 

Ronaldo, whose future at Real had been questioned after AC Milan expressed an interest in signing him last week, underwent an operation to clean up his left knee following the World Cup. 

He missed the tail-end of last season because of a thigh injury and played his last game for the club on April 8.

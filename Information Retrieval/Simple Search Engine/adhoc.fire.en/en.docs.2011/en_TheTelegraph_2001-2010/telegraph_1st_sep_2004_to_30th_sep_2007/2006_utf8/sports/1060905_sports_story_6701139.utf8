 Broad named Match Referee 

Dubai: Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh will again have to contend with Match Referee Chris Broad, who found his action suspect during the 2004 tour of Bangladesh. 

The former England batsman will officiate during the Malaysian tri-series, which pits India against world champions Australia and the West Indies from September 12 to 24. 

Englishman Mark Benson, Asad Rauf of Pakistan and Tony Hill of New Zealand will be the umpires for the series, and the trio will alternate between on-field and third umpire duties.

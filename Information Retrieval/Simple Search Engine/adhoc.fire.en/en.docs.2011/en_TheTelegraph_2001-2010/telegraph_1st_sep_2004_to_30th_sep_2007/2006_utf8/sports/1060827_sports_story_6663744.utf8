The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Clarification on Gloster

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah has clarified that John Gloster had not been sent to the UK to examine Anil Kumbles injured shoulder. Since the physio was already there for a refresher course, the BCCI decided to utilise his services, Shah said. 

He was reacting to Sunil Gavaskars column Different Strokes published in The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Kumble has been advised rest by Gloster after being diagnosed with tendonitis in his right shoulder. 

Meanwhile, as directed by the city civil court, the BCCI Saturday handed over a set of bank vouchers and other documents to its former president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

Shah and the BCCIs lawyers handed over 1975 bank vouchers and 24 other documents to Dalmiyas representatives for inspection. 

Dalmiya was, however, not present. 

The court has directed Dalmiya to complete the inspection and file his reply on the proceedings by September 9.

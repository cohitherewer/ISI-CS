 Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur 

 and Gaurav Ghei shot a six-under 66, but still found themselves 

 three shots behind the leaders, who pulled away from the 

 chasing pack at the WGC World Cup qualifiers with one round 

 to go.

 Mardan Mamat and Lam Chih Bing 

 fired a third round of eight-under-par 63 in the four-ball 

 format on Friday with the former showing solid putting, 

 including an eagle at the par five 13th hole of the Seri 

 Selangor Golf Club.

 The Singaporeans had a three-day 

 total of 12-under-par 201 while India were at nine-under 

 204.

 Kapur, ranked sixth on the Asian 

 Tours Order Of Merit, and Ghei, tied for the overnight 

 lead, are now sole second with Malaysian duo Danny Chia 

 and Iain Steel in third place after an equally impressive 

 63.

 The top two teams will qualify 

 for the World Golf Championships-World Cup in Barbados in 

 December.

 The Indians had six birdies against 

 a lone bogey and they hope to make one final bid to win 

 the title on Saturday.

 There are a few holes like 

 the par fives where you want to take advantage and make 

 your birdies, but other than that, we are in a good position, 

 said Ghei. (PTI)

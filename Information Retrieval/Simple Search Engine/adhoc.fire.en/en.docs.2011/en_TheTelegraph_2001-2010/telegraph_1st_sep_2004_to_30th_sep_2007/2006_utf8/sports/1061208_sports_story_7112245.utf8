Doha: The shooting gold which seemed a mirage for India at the Asian Games became a reality on Thursday when a highly-indisposed Jaspal Rana won the mens 25m standard pistol event. 

For the handful of Indians who braved the heavy rain to be present at the range, it was a moment of joy when Rana struck 574 points to topple his South Korean and Kazakhstan rivals and earn his second Asian Games gold medal in 12 years. 

In 1994, Rana fired 588 in Hiroshima to win the gold. So far, Rana has bagged two golds, two silvers and one bronze in four Asian Games. 

Rana fought back like a wounded tiger to snatch the gold. I was not well for the past two days, he said moments after he came out of the dope control room. Till 3 am this morning, I was awake with high fever. I also vomited a number of times. 

So much so that Rana had to take quite a few medicines to keep him fit for the morning showdown at the range. I didnt expect to win any medal. I just wanted to get a good score, he said. 

With bloodshot eyes and uncombed hair, Rana looked tired before the event. But he made a comeback in the 20-second series when his Japanese rival, who was then leading, suffered back-to-back pistol malfunctions. Rana took the chance to go ahead and never looked back. 

Taek Byung Park won the silver with 571 points and Vladimir Issachenko bagged the bronze with 570. 

India added two more bronze medals to their kitty in 50-m rifle 3 position. While the first bronze came in the team event, Gagan Narang finished third behind his two Chinese rivals to bag the second with 1162 points. Fu Zhang (1170) and Lei Zhang (1165) won gold and the silver. 

In the team event, Sanjeev Rajput and Imran Hassan Khan were Narangs partners.

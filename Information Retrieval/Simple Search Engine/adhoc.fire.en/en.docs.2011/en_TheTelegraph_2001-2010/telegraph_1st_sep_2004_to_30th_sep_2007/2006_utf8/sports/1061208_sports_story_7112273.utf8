Faisalabad: Inzamam-ul Haq ground out an unbeaten 42 Thursday to guide Pakistan to a two-wicket victory over a determined West Indies in a low scoring second limited-overs International. 

The Pakistan skippers 86-ball innings guided his team to 154 for 8 in 48.2 overs in reply to the West Indies 151 in 49.5 overs. The West Indies bowlers fought back well despite posting the lowest-ever total at the Iqbal Stadium. 

Fast bowler Corey Collymore, drafted into the West Indies team after Dwayne Bravo pulled out of the series due to personal reasons, removed Imran Farhat (17) and Kamran Akmal (22) in his first spell and then had Abdul Razzaq (17) caught behind to finish with three for 19 off his 10 overs. 

Younis Khan scored 24 before he skied a pull shot off Jerome Taylor (three for 39) to give wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin one of his five catches. 

Inzamam took 18 balls to score his first run and survived a couple of close leg before appeals from Dwayne Smith before he batted through the lower order to earn Pakistan a 1-0 lead in the five-match series. 

Runako Morton top scored with a fighting 43 off 66 balls, but the rest of the West Indies top order failed to raise a strong total with rookie left-arm spinner Abdul Rehman grabbing two wickets for 22 runs in his international debut. 

Morton hit four boundaries and featured in the best partnership of 57 runs off 89 balls with Ramdin (23) for the seventh wicket. Morton departed in the 49th over, giving an easy catch to Younis after he was deceived by Rana Naveds (two for 32) slow delivery. 

The Pakistan players were sharp in the field and forced three run-outs, including dangerman Brian Lara for 14.

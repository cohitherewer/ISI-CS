 - Bells chances brighten

Brisbane: Crickets greatest rivals will renew hostilities on Thursday when Australia and England lock horns at the Gabba in the opening Test of the most eagerly-anticipated Ashes series in generations. 

Thousands of English fans have arrived in Brisbane for the series opener while tickets for each of the five Tests sold out within hours of being released. 

Australia will start as short-priced favourites to regain the Ashes on account of their imposing record on home soil and their outstanding form over the past 12 months. The side have not lost a series at home to anyone in 14 years and have won 11 and drawn one of the 12 Tests they have played since their loss last year. 

I dont think there is any more pressure on me or on the players trying to win the Ashes back, he said. Its just about a good, hard, intense few weeks, Australia captain Ricky Ponting said on Wednesday. 

Were happy with the way were going, theres a good mood in the team, but it all starts again tomorrow It doesnt matter who the bookmakers think will win, the only thing that matters is what happens on the field and were expecting a tough series. 

Strike bowler Steve Harmison threw a scare into the English camp when he missed the last practice session with a side strain, then in-form batsman Ian Bell injured his wrist in the nets in Brisbane. 

However, Bell completed a net session on Wednesday and is expected to be promoted up the order to bat at No. 3 after Trescothick returned home. 

England skipper Andrew Flintoff said they would wait until Thursday before finalising their team although every position seems settled except the choice of spinner. 

Teams 

Australia (likely): Ricky Ponting (captain), Adam Gilchrist, Stuart Clark/Mitchell Johnson, Michael Clarke, Matthew Hayden, Mike Hussey, Justin Langer, Brett Lee, Damien Martyn, Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne. 

England (likely): Andrew Flintoff (captain), Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Kevin Pietersen, Paul Collingwood, Geraint Jones, Matthew Hoggard, James Anderson, Steve Harmison, Ashley Giles/Monty Panesar.

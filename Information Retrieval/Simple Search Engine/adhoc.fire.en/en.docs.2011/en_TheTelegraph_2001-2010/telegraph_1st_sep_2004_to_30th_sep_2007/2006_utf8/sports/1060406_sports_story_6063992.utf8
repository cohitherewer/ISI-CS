The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mr Darcy strikes it rich 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Contrary to expectations, jockeys Imran Chisty and C.Alford could manage only three winners between them in Wednesdays six-event card. Chistys two wins did help him gain a point at the championship table but he still needs to score eight more to draw level with Alford in the next three meetings.

 Favourites, nevertheless, ruled the afternoon and the victory of the hot-property, Mr Darcy, was simply smashing in the Wind Song Cup. Chisty partnered the Daniel David-trainee.

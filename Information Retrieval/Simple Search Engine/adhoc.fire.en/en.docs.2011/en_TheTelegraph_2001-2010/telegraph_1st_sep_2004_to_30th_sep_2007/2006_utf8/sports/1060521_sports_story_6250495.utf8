 Glory wins thriller 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Trainer S.Ganapathys heavily 

 backed three-year-old filly, Flaming Glory, was hard-pressed 

 to beat an equally fancied Rain Splasher in the 1,400m Speakers 

 Cup on Saturday, the opening day of the Bangalore summer 

 season. Jockey B.Prakash partnered the Placerville-Stately 

 Home daughter to half-a-length victory over the S.Padmanabhan-trainee 

 who was enjoying a 6kg pull over the winner. Four favourites 

 obliged in the eight-event card.

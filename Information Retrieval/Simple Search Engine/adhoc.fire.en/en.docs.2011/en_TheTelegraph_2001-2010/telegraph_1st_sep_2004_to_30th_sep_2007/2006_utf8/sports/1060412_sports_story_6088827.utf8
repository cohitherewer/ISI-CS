Jamshedpur: Theres nothing unofficial about it now and Virender Sehwag packed further punch to it at the Keenan on Tuesday: Team India are set to conquer the world in the Caribbean without their most successful captain Sourav Ganguly. 

The stand-in captain made it clear that the series against England may have seen a plethora of protests over Souravs exclusion here and there, the team is taking it as something that is past. 

Chief selector Kiran More and coach Greg Chappell have gone on record quite a few times and Sehwag toed that official line on Tuesday, insisting the team is thinking ahead without Souravs any role in it. 

Weve forgotten that and past is past. We are looking ahead to the World Cup. We are a young side and doing pretty well, the dashing opener, who himself partnered his former captain in some memorable ODI innings, opined. 

But is the team settled for the challenge in the Caribbean? Our progress is still on and we hope well get a good combination before the World Cup. Thats what we are aiming for now, came Sehwags reply. 

Do you think Sourav has still a chance in the teams scheme of things for the World Cup? Sehwag, this time, ducked it, saying its the selectors call. 

Unlike Guwahati, Team India practised at the stadium without any banner in favour of Sourav. 

 Souravs flying visit 

While Sehwag was making the teams stand on him clear, Sourav made a flying visit to the Steel City on Tuesday morning. It was for personal work and he returned to Calcutta in the evening. Sourav is employed by Tata Steel.

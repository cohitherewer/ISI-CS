The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Reverse swing doesnt happen 

 overnight

 Yoga a big help in improving concentration 

 while batting

 Cricket online

 Ravi Shastri

 Iam a right-arm mediumpacer, 

 my height is 5 feet 6 inches. I have been trying to reverse 

 swing the old ball for the past year or so, but has been 

 unsuccessful. My coachs tips have not helped. What 

 should I do?

 Kangkan Kr Das, 17, 

 Guwahati

 Its something that demands 

 lot of practice and doesnt happen overnight. It took 

 even the great Kapil Dev a long time to get a hang of it. 

 You need to be pretty nippy with a very good wrist action. 

 Plus you got to work on the ball to get it right for reverse 

 swing.

 I am a right-handed batsman. 

 Why playing an off-spinner, I often try to place the ball 

 past the lone slip fielder but end up getting caught at 

 slip. How do I overcome this problem?

 Tirtharup Chatterjee, 14, 

 Hooghly

 Very simple. Dont attempt 

 that lousy nothing shot.

 I am a right-handed batsman. 

 Whenever I come down the pitch to a spinner and attempt 

 the on-drive, the bat hits the pads on the follow through 

 and I lose my balance. Why does this happen?

 Tirtha Pratim Sanyal, 19, 

 Calcutta

 You are getting too far across 

 on the front foot. As a result, you lose balance and dont 

 allow your bat to come through.

 I have a problem with fielding. 

 I am a safe catcher but am very poor in the outfield. Often 

 I fail to stop regulation hits. Practice hasnt really 

 helped. Please advise.

 Tapan Roy, 19, 

 Howrah

 You got to work on your fitness 

 and agility to improve your fielding. Also you have to have 

 the right technique to get your body behind the ball when 

 you are trying to stop it.

 Is yoga helpful in improving 

 concentration while batting?

 Roktim Basu, 21, 

 Calcutta-42

 A big help.

 I am a middle-order batsman. 

 How does one recognise the googly coming out of the bowlers 

 hand?

 Ratan Pandey, 25, 

 Silchar

 Watch his hand closely and 

 you will see the back of the palm at the time of delivery.

 What is the right ball to attempt 

 the sweep?

 Ambarish Dutta, 21, 

 Calcutta-19

 A delivery that is little further 

 up than good length. Also, you must pick the line early.

 I am a mediumpacer. I fail 

 to deliver the slower ball with the same action. Repeated 

 practice hasnt helped.

 S. Roy, 18, 

 Calcutta-16

 Keep practising and dont 

 lose heart. Also check your grip. You may have to spread 

 your fingers a bit at the time of delivery.

 I am an opener. I often fail 

 to negotiate the moving ball and end up getting caught at 

 slips. Do I need to improve on my footwork?

 Rajib Basu, 19, 

 Calcutta-42

 Yes. You certainly have to 

 and meet the ball as close to the body as possible. Dont 

 push your hands towards it.

 I am an off-spinner. How does 

 one bowl the straighter?

 Ravi Patel, 16, 

 Jamshedpur

 A slight alteration in the 

 grip where you use your fore finger to push the seam in 

 the direction of the batsman. This will happen even though 

 your fingers are spread.

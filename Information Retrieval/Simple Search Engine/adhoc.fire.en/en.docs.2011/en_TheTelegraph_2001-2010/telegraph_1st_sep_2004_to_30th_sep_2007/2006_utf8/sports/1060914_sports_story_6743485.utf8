 Bhupathi, Ancic up

Beijing: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Croatian partner Mario Ancic have moved into the second round of the $475,000 China Open after defeating Korean Hyung-Taik Lee and Yeu-Tzuoo Wang of Taiwan in straight sets. 

The Indo-Croatian pair won 6-3, 6-3 to set up a meeting with third-seeded American pair of Eric Butorac and Travis Parrott, who beat Thai combination of Sanchai Ratiwatana and Sonchat Ratiwatana 6-2, 6-3. 

Bhupathi is experiencing a drop in form in recent times. He crashed out in the first round of the US Open, where he was partnering Belgiums Xavier Malisse. He would like to put up a good showing at the hard court event in the Chinese capital to improve his ranking, which has fallen to no 29 on the latest list. (PTI)

 Germans get a day off

Berlin: Juergen Klinsmann gave his players a day off as soon he knew Germany had qualified for the second round of the World Cup. With two wins from two starts, Germany was ensured a place in the second round when Ecuador beat Costa Rica 3-0 on Thursday. 

The result assured both the World Cup host and Ecuador (2-0) of advancing from Group A. Their match Tuesday in Berlin will determine the group winner. 

Ecuador showed impressive performances in both games, Klinsmann said. The team confirmed why it was third in South America qualifying, behind Brazil and Argentina. 

Klinsmann decided to give his squad time off from noon Friday until Saturday evening. The players were free to go home or do whatever else they wanted, the DBF said. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nice way to gear up for Ranji

Hyderabad: Sourav Ganguly, on a comeback trail after being overlooked by the national selectors, Friday said his stint in domestic matches prior to the start of the Ranji season would stand him in good stead. 

Its nice to play some domestic cricket and get runs and wickets as the actual season back home (Ranji) starts later, Sourav told reporters after the Moin-ud-Dowlah match against MCA XI here. 

Attributing the absence of big players from domestic circuit to the increasing number of international competitions, Sourav said, we cannot blame them (players). 

They have a busy season on hand. This tournament has attracted players like Wasim Jaffer, Gautam Gambhir and even I turned up to be in the thick of the action, Sourav said. 

Sourav, who enthralled the crowd throughout the three days with his lusty hitting and fine bowling, cracked a gritty 72 for CAB XI in the second innings, but could not prevent his side from suffering a 47-run defeat. 

On the performance of Bengal players, Sourav said: It was off season for them and they are playing after some lay-off. They will improve in the coming days. 

They played well last season and reached the final of Ranji Trophy. Since the season has just begun they will come up well, he said. (PTI)

 Warne to Fletcher: Stop me if you can

 Shane Warne

Melbourne: Spin wizard Shane Warne has challenged Duncan Fletchers claim that England had sorted him out and asked the rival camp coach to come up with a plan to stop him from leading the Australians to another Ashes victory. 

Im sure Fletcher will come up with some you-beaut plan, a you-beaut comment, Warne said. 

I know Fletcher has said he thought England are playing me really well. If that is what he thinks, thats fine, but at the end of the day it is all about winning, Warne was quoted as saying by a newspaper. 

Warne had a stunning second innings harvest of four for 49 from 32 overs to pluck victory from nowhere in the second Test. 

But after the loss, Fletcher said he did not think the worlds highest wicket-taker had a mental hold on England and he was just another good spinner bowling well on wickets suiting him. 

I dont think he has (a mental hold of England). Its like other good spinners who have bowled well against us on wickets that suit them, he said. 

I have never said we have played him comfortably in the sense we are confident against him, but I felt we played him better than we have than in recent years. 

He had to wait 54 overs for one wicket in the first innings. In the second innings we struggled to score off him but he still had to bowl 32 overs. 

Warne said Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood were the only two English batsmen who he felt had played him well in the opening two matches of the series. 

I thought Collingwood at times has played me well and Pietersen has played me well, but apart from that I have felt very comfortable bowling to all their players and I still feel comfortable bowling to Pietersen and Collingwood.

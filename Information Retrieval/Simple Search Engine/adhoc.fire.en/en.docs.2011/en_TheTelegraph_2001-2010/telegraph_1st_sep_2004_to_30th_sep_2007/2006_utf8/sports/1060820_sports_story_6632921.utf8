 Johl stays in touch with a 70

 - CHINA GOLF 

Sanya: A gritty two-under par 70 helped Amandeep Johl stay in touch with the leaders at the Crowne Plaza Open. After three days of action at the Yalong Bay Golf Club, all six Indians are among the top-25. 

Johl, with two top-three finishes this season, had a superb three-under front nine, but found touch deserting him on way back. But the experienced Indian held on for a one-over 37 and finished with a 70 that put him in tied sixth place at 10-under 206, five strokes off leader Chinarat Phadsungil. 

The Thai teenaged prodigy carded a 68, despite a closing bogey, and stands at 15-under for a two-shot lead over Unho Park (66) and 2005 Asian Tour No. 1 Thaworn Wiratchant (68). 

It was a mixed day for the Indians. While SSP Chowrasia rose from tied 34th to tied 19th with a four-under 68, Gaurav Ghei (70) slid from tied ninth to tied 13th. Harmeet Kahlon (73) dropped from tied ninth to tied 23rd, where he has company in Rahil Gangjee (71) and Digvijay Singh (69). 

Gangjee stayed at his overnight position, while Digvijay moved up from 34th. 

Johl birdied the first, third and seventh to turn in three-under but his second nine was patchy. 

He dropped a shot on 10th, picked up a birdie on 12th but again bogeyed 13th and 15th before birdying the 16th. 

I think I am still not out of the race and am in touch with the leaders, said johl, whose first two rounds were 67 and 69. 

Ghei was poised for a top-10 position after his three-under front nine with three birdies. But on the back journey, he bogeyed 13th and his birdie putts did not drop as he finished at 70. 

Chowrasia was the big gainer. After a two-under front nine, he added a third birdie on 10th. But back-to-back bogeys on 12th and 13th blotted his card. However, he bounced back with three birdies in four holes between 14th and 17th for his 68 that saw him move into the top-20. 

Digvijay started on the back nine and had three birdies, but had only one more on the second nine, and also dropped a shot on eighth, his second last hole of the day. 

Gangjee was sitting pretty at four-under before being undone by four bogeys, including three in a row. Kahlon had five birdies and six bogeys in his 73.

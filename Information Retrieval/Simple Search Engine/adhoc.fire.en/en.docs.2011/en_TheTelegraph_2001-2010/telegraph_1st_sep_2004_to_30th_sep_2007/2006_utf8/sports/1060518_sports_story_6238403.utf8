 Things are falling in place: Sachin

 - Maestro has 45-minute batting session 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkars chances of making it to the Team India Test squad for the West Indies series brightened on Wednesday as the maestro did everything except bowling on the third day of his training stint at the MRF Pace Academy here. 

I am very happy about the workouts and batting practice. Things are falling in place, Sachin said, after the end of days training session. 

After going through his routine physical training at the hotel gym this morning for 90 minutes, Sachin showed agility and then went for four hours of batting and training drills at the academy. 

The ace batsman had two sessions of batting for 45 minutes, during which he faced a few trainee fast bowlers. Laxmipathy Balaji, who was also present during the session, bowled at him with a shortened run-up. 

The maestro then moved on to have some catching practice, both skiers and chest high ones but was throwing back the ball with his left arm. He also opted to use his right hand for throws but they were all under-arm returns. 

Despite the strenuous sessions, the maestro didnt look fatigued and went for a 15-minute pilates session well after the sun had set. 

Former Indian physio Andrew Leipus, who watched every bit of Sachins training, did not say anything, but seemed to be satisfied with the progress.

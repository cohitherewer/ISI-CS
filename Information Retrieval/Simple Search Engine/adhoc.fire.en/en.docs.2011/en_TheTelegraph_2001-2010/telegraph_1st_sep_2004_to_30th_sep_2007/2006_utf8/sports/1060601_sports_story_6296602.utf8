 Pak camp concerned over Shoaib fitness

Lahore: Pakistan are sweating on Shoaib Akhtars fitness after doctors advised him to take it easy for a week after twisting an ankle during practice, an official said on Wednesday. 

Akhtars injury is not very serious as an MRI scan has shown swelling and no fracture on the ankle but doctors have advised him not to train hard for a week, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director Abbas Zaidi said. 

Akhtars fitness will be re-evaluated next week, he said. 

Aktar has bowled without any trouble since his twin knee operations in February this year and we hope that he recovers in time to spearhead the teams attack. 

The Pakistani paceman has not played active cricket since his teams third Test against India in January this year and is racing the clock to prove his fitness for Pakistans tour of England starting next month. Pakistan selectors are due to announce the final 16-man squad on June 9. 

Pakistan will play four Tests followed by five one-dayers. The first Test starts at Lords on July 13. 

However, chief selector Wasim Bari remained optimistic that Akhtar, who participated in the first innings of the Lords Test on the last tour in 2001, would be fit. 

As regards our selection policy (regarding Akhtar), we will depend on the recommendations of the medical commission. But I am pretty hopeful that he will be fit for the tour, Bari said. Bari insisted that there was ample time before the first Test begins at Lords from July 13. 

The team departs later next month and then there are a few side games ahead of the first Test. So, I am pretty much confident that Akhtar would be fully fit by the first Test, Bari said. (PTI)

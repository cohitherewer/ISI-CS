 Mary has the hunger to excel: Short 

New Delhi: The British Grandmaster Nigel Short hailed Mary Ann Gomes, who won the Asian girls under-20 title on Tuesday, saying she had the hunger to do well and the sport needed such players. 

Mary has the hunger to do well and we need such players who want to progress in the sport and not just be relaxed with a place in the top few, Short said on the sidelines of the presentation ceremony of the Parsvnath Asian Junior Chess Championships that concluded here on Tuesday. 

She has that oomph factor, said Short, who was the youngest player to feature in the World Chess Championships at the age of 15. 

He also emphasised on proper coaching of such players. 

At such stage, players need proper coaching because some wrong habits of their coaches can rub on them. I have not studied her games but Ive seen her play in Gibraltar. She has definitely improved a lot, he said. 

Mary finished the tournament with seven points from a possible nine after losing one game and drawing two. 

The double Woman Grandmaster norm holder with an Elo rating of 2264 is now eyeing the third and final norm at the Commonwealth Championships. 

She also needs at least Elo 2300 to get the title.

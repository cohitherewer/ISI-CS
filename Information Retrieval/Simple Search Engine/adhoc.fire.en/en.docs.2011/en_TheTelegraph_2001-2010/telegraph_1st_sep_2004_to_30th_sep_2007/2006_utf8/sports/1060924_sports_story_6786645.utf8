 Indians leave for home in batches 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: The Indian cricketers left for home in batches on Saturday evening. While Mohammed Kaif and Yuvraj Singh went to New Delhi, the rest left for Chennai. Coach Greg Chappell is going off to Australia to see his ailing mother. 

There was a team meeting some hours before the departure and, according to a source of The Telegraph, introspection on a lousy performance in the tri-series was done. 

The Indians managed just one win, finishing the league stage on six points. Australia topped with 11, while the West Indies managed two less.

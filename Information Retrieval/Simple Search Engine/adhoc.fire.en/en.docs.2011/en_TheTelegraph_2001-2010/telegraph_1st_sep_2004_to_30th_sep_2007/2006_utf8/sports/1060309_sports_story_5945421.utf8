 Thorpes withdrawal sparks doubt

Sydney: Ian Thorpes withdrawal from the Melbourne Commonwealth Games has rekindled doubts about his prospects of ever returning to his best after taking a break from the sport. 

Thorpe took a year off from the constant grind of training after winning another two gold medals at the Athens Olympics, saying he wanted to recharge his batteries before the long road to the Beijing Games in 2008. 

A number of top swimmers and coaches queried Thorpes decision to take a year off, warning him that he would find it hard to return to training once he stopped. 

And his decision to pull out of the Commonwealth Games because of a mystery illness related to bronchitis and a viral infection has only intensified concerns about his future. (Reuters)

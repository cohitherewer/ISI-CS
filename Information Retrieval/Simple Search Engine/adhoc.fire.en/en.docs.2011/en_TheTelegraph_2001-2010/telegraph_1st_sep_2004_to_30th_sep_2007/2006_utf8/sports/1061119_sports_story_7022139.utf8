 Kapur shares 15th position

Miyazaki: Shiv Kapur moved up the leaderboard braving high wind and tough scoring conditions in the third round of the 200 million yen Dunlop Phoenix Golf tournament at the par-70 Phoenix Country Club on the Japan Tour. 

Kapur, helped by a birdie on the very last hole, shot a three-over 73 to move up from 18th to tied 15th spot, as he totalled three-over 213 for three days. He had even par rounds on first two days. 

Tiger Woods, too, found the going tough as he went two-over 72 despite a last-hole birdie. Padraig Harrington, the European No. 1 in 2006, caught up with Woods despite one-over 71. The two are at six-under 204, while Shingo Katayama (71) moved into third at four-under 206. 

Takuya Taniguchi (68) was fourth at three-under, while Keiichi Fukabori (69) was tied for fifth with Justin Rose (72), who had a triple bogey on 17th.

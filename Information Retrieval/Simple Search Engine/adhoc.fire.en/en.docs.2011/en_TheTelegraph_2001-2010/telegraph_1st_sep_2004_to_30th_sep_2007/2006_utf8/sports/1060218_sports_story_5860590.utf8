 Fleming suggestion

Sydney: New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming will ask the West Indies captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul to agree to ditch the super-sub rule for their five-match one-day series starting in Wellington on Saturday. The ICC announced on Thursday the experimental rule would be scrapped from March. 

Fleming said that while it made sense to start playing without the rule as soon as possible, he wanted to discuss the issue first with Chanderpaul and the match officials. 

Im not sure how it would wash but we have to look at the options, he was quoted as saying by New Zealand Press Association. Its very much common sense. If it did take place it seems strange, especially from the West Indies point of view of learning how to play it and then having to scrap. (REUTERS)

Sanias run of bad luck in Grand Slam draws continues. Her current ranking is not good enough to earn her a place amongst the 32 seeded players. At the French Open, she was drawn against Anastasia Myskina, a former title-holder, while at Wimbledon she drew seventh seed Elena Dementieva. Both are Russians firmly entrenched in the top-10 of womens tennis and fierce competitors. 

Grass, in my view, is Sanias best surface, and an upset victory against Dementieva was a distinct possibility. Like Paes, Sania performs at her best on a big stage. Her match was scheduled on a show-court (Court 13), a factor much to her advantage. 

Sania lost 6-7, 5-7 in a close match. The first five games were awe-inspiring. Sania unleashed a cloud-burst of winners as she teed off from both flanks with all her might and swamped a scampering Dementieva. The scoreboard moved at record speed and Sania was soon serving at game-point for a 5-1 lead! 

Dementieva looked bewildered and worried, and it seemed the set was in Sanias grip. This is where Sania gifted the first set and, possibly, the match by serving a double-fault. She went on to serve yet another double-fault to lose the game and the score was 4-2, instead of 5-1. Again Sania was up 5-3 in the tiebreaker but could not clinch the set. 

These lapses were due to lack of match sharpness as Sania has had very few matches in the last three or four months. After the first set, Dementieva took control of the rallies as a disheartened Sania could not maintain the all-out offensive. She seemed physically drained, and both her accuracy and power dropped. 

There were sporadic bursts of brilliant shots but the blonde long-legged Russian came back with the answers. The tide had turned and Dementieva was now calling the tune. 

Physically Sania is not strong enough to fuel an all-out blitz throughout a match. She must learn to conserve energy and launch her all-out attacks judiciously at strategic points. A heartening feature of Sanias game was her occasional sorties to the net and improved volleying. Obviously, Tony Roche must have advised her to do so. 

A higher frequency of net attacks will pay Sania rich dividends. More so, because Sanias powerful groundshots elicit week returns which can easily and safely be put away from the net-position and thus her opponents will be under more pressure. 

From the scorelines in the early rounds of the ladies singles, one can see the precipitous drop in womens standards after the top-30 or so. With her destructive free-hitting groundshots Sania can be a threat to the topmost level of the womens game. 

As I said earlier she has something special. Her talent needs to be nurtured and developed. Short stints with different coaches can be confusing and can do more harm than good. There has to be a long-term arrangement with a coach of international standing. 

Concurrently, she needs a top-class physical trainer who will build up her strength and sharpen reflexes. Paes for his physical training used Pat Etcheberry, who also worked with Sampras. Strong family support for an Indian girl is a must and Sania happily has that. But interference with coaching and physical training programmes can prove to be disastrous. 

Sania has made progress in the last year, but has fallen behind her age-group in world tennis. The girls, especially from eastern Europe, are bigger, stronger and fitter than Sania and have higher rankings. 

More and more hungry teenagers are being churned out in the years to come. How wonderful it will be for all of us to see Sania in full bloom.

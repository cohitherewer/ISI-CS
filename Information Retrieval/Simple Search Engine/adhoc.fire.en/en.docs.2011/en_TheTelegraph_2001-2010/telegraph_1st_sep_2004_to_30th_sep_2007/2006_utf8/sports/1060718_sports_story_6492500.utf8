 Kumble signs for Surrey

London: Anil Kumble signed with English county cricket club Surrey on Monday. 

The leg-spinner will play his first match against Somerset on Wednesday. He missed the start of the county season because he was playing in a four-Test series against the West Indies in May and June. 

Anil is a world-class spinner with a great deal of international and first class experience, Surrey coach Alan Butcher said. His ability, character and professionalism will be a great addition to the dressing room, as we push for promotion into Division I. 

Kumble previously played for Northamptonshire and Leicestershire.

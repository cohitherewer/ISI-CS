 Cricket is slowing down, rues Sunny 

St Johns: Legendary batsman Sunil Gavaskar has called for improving the quality of wickets prepared for Test matches, saying slow tracks were stripping the traditional version of the game of its charm. 

Gavaskar, invited as the feature speaker at the University of the West Indies faculty of social sciences prestigious Sonny Ramadhin Lecture Series, expressed concern over the overall slowing down of the game. 

One of the bigger challenges the game of cricket faces today is the slowing down that has taken place, the former champion batsman said. The over rates are slow... The pitches, and I think this is probably a bigger challenge than the over rates, because the pitches are very important, he said on Friday. 

The fact is, if you do not have a pitch that is balanced, a pitch that gives bowlers and batsmen an even and equal opportunity to display their skills and temperament, you are gonna have a one-sided contest, he said, adding that one-dayers had come to the rescue of the game somewhat with their fast-paced action. 

No spectator or fan desires to see a game that goes for five days with no result, Gavaskar said. 

Advocating the use of more technology, he said, If the technology is available and where it is accurate, I think it is in the best interest of the sport. (PTI)

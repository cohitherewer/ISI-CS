Alexandria: Striker Didier Drogba steered Ivory Coast into the African Nations Cup final with the only goal of the semi-final against Nigeria on Tuesday. 

Drogba beat the offside trap to run on to a deep pass from Kolo Toure two minutes into the second half and hit the ball through the legs of Nigerian goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. 

It was the third goal of the tournament for the Chelsea striker in a match of limited opportunities for both teams, and inflicted a third semi-final defeat on Nigeria in successive tournaments. 

Christian Koffi Ndri threatened early with a shot on the Nigerian goal in the opening two minutes and Drogba had a free kick well stopped by Enyeama six minutes later. 

Joseph Yobos header from a corner was the closest Nigeria came to their opponents goal in a tedious first half, when he climbed above Drogba but missed the target. 

At the other end, the Everton defender did well to keep the Chelsea attacker under wraps in the first 45 minutes. 

Nigeria brought on Jay-Jay Okocha after conceding the goal, the first appearance of the tournament for their captain, who had been suffering from a thigh injury.

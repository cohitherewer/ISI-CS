 Jeev Milkha tied 19th 

 - SPAIN MEET 

 - Jose Manuel Lara in lead 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Valderrama (Spain): Jeev Milkha Singh opened modestly with an even par round of 71 that placed him tied 19th in the Volvo Masters, the season-ending tour championships for Europe. 

Only the top-60 qualify for the event and there is no half-way cut in the event, meaning all players make money at the end of the week. 

Jeev at one stage was two-under with birdies on the fourth and eighth, but a bogey on 11th and another 14th set him back. Then he went over par with a third bogey, before ending the day with a birdie that brought him back to even. 

Jeev putted very well and need just 25 to finish the round. But he had problems with his driving as he found the fairway only five times in 14 and reached only 50 per cent greens in regulation. 

But he did well to scramble and made pars on six of the nine occasions. He is now tied 19th with the likes of Sergio Garcia. 

Jose Manuel Lara led the field with a five-under 66, while Graeme McDowell was tied second with Niclas Fasth and Richard Green. All three shot four-under 67 each. 

Order of Merit leader Paul Casey needed an injection to complete his round following a stomach ailment. He shot a one-under 70. (Pti)

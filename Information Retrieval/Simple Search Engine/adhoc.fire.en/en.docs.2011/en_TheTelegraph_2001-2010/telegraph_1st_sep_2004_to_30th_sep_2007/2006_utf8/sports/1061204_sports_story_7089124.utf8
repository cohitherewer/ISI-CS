 Sourav to leave today

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sourav Gangulys departure for South Africa for the Test series has been delayed by a day. The former India captain was scheduled to leave on Sunday evening via Mumbai. 

According to Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah there was a delay in submitting the application for the visa at the South African embassy in New Delhi because of the delayed arrival of the passport. 

The application was placed late on Friday, and with the embassy closed on Saturday and Sunday, the visa will only be available on Monday. Sourav will now leave on Monday, Shah said. 

The bandh in the city on Friday had apparently caused the delay in sending of the passport.

 Title for Fish

Houston: American Mardy Fish claimed his second career ATP title ? and denied Austrian Jurgen Melzer his first ? with a victory in the final of the US Mens Clay Court Championships. 

Fish, who received a wildcard invitation, rallied to down Melzer 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 and add the title to his only previous tournament win, in Stockholm in 2003. 

I definitely didnt expect to win the tournament this week, and I have always wanted to come to this tournament and play well, Fish said. I love this tournament.

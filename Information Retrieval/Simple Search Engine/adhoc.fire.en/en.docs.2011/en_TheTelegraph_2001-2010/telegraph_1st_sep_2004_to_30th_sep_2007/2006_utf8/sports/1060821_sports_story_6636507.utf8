The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI will talk when time is right

 - We are a bit upset at missing an opportunity to assess ourselves: Chappell 

 Greg Chappell

Colombo: Greg Chappell on Sunday sought to scotch media reports that he was a strong contender for taking over as Australian coach, saying he was committed to the job with the Indian team and the time had not yet come to review his contract. 

Coaching the Indian team is the biggest challenge in cricket and I have not only stood up to the challenges that comes with this job but also enjoyed. 

I am indeed grateful to receive the affection of the millions of people who follow the game so closely in this country, and the loyalty and commitment shown by skipper Rahul Dravid and other players including seniors like Sachin Tendulkar. 

And I believe that when the time is right, the BCCI and president (Sharad) Pawar will sit down with me and talk about it, Chappell said, reading out from a prepared statement. 

Chappell chose to clarify his position following reports that he was one of the contenders to take over from John Buchanan as the coach of the Australian team after the World Cup. 

The 57-year-old former Australian captain was appointed by the BCCI for a two-year term in May 2005 and a decision on extending the contract would be taken after the World Cup. 

Chappell said the past week or so had been frustrating with no cricket possible because of rain, and was all praise for the players for the way they had handled the situation. 

It has not been easy. The guys have been terrific, they have coped well and have remained remarkably focused. In fact, that is one of the things that I have learnt from being with the Indian team, he said. 

Chappell said the time away from the game had a positive side to it, too. 

We have had couple of experienced players talk to the players. It has been an experience for them to listen to what those former players had to say. 

The break has also been good in that they have been able to sit down and talk to each other about what has been happening in the recent past. So it hasnt been a total disaster. 

Chappell said one of the fall-outs of the series was that India couldnt test itself against a strong team. 

It has taken away an opportunity to play on wickets similar to those in the West Indies. Playing Sri Lanka at home, when they are playing well, it would have been nice to test ourselves against such a strong team. 

Chappell said Tendulkar, returning to competitive cricket after a five-month layoff following a shoulder surgery, might be frustrated more than the others but the off-days would give him that much time to recover. 

I think he has coped pretty well. He would have liked to have faced a few more deliveries than what he had in that rain affected match but with each days passing he would get stronger. It would have given him more time to get better. 

Chappell also rued the fact that India could not assess the opening combination of Dravid and Tendulkar who launched Indias innings in the rain-curtailed match on Friday. 

Yes, we are a bit upset at missing an opportunity to assess ourselves. What we have always done is see our resources and use them. 

Whether we try it (open with Dravid and Tendulkar) elsewhere, we have to wait and see. 

He refused to comment on South Africas decision to go back home. 

 I have no comments to make 

 on their decision, he said.

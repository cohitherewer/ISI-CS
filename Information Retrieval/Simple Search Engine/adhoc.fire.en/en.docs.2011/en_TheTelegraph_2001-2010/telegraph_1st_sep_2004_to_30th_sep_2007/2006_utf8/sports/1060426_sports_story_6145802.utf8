 Jha holds Saptarshi

Mumbai: International Master R. R. Laxman (6) of Tamil Nadu defeated former national champion P. Konguvel (4.5) to maintain his slender half point lead over Grand Master-elect G. B. Prakash (5.5 points) of Indian Bank in the sixth round of the Tha- kur International Rating Chess tournament on Tuesday. 

Konguvel landed in passive position in the English Opening against Laxman. Though the queens were exchanged as early as the ninth move, Laxmans pair of bishops maintained intense pressure to bring about a well-contested victory. 

On the second table, Saptarshi Roy and IM Sriram Jha ? both on five points ? agreed for a draw in 11 moves of Scotch Opening. 

Prakashs nimble minor pieces won the day for him against IM R. Balasubrmanium (4.5) from the black side of London System. Balas white pieces were too passive to stop the onslaught of the corresponding rival pieces.

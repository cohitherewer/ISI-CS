 Clinical Aussies outplay Lanka

Melbourne: Australia produced a clinical, allround team effort to outplay a poor Sri Lanka side and record a 116-run victory in the opening match of their triangular one-day series on Friday. 

The world champions batsmen, sparked by a brutal 106-run partnership between Damien Martyn (70) and Andrew Symonds (66), smashed Sri Lanka all around Docklands Stadium to post an imposing 318 for five of their 50 overs. 

Brett Lee knocked the top off Sri Lankas innings with two wickets in his first two overs, while Nathan Bracken grabbed two wickets for 11 runs off eight to restrict Sri Lanka to 202 for seven in their 50 overs. 

Australian opening batsman Simon Katich scored 60 while Michael Clarke (45 not out) and Mike Hussey (34 not out) added 80 runs in the final 10.4 overs. 

Test discard Martyn had a bizarre innings. He survived a potential run out, a dropped catch and was caught off a no ball before he had reached double figures.

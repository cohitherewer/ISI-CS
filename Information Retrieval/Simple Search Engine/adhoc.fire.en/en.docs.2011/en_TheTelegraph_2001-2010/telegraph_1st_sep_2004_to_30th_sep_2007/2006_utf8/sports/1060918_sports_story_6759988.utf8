 Chelsea win, but Ballack is sent off

London: A stunning strike by Didier Drogba earned 10-man Chelsea a 1-0 victory over Liverpool on Sunday after the champions had Germany midfielder Michael Ballack dismissed for stamping. 

Drogba, on the edge of the area, collected a Frank Lampard pass with his back to goal and swivelled round to smash a blistering half-volley past Liverpool keeper Jose Reina four minutes before halftime. The match at Stamford Bridge began to swing Liverpools way soon after the re-start when Ballack brought his boot down on the thigh of Liverpools Mali international midfielder Momo Sissoko. 

But despite the red card for Germanys World Cup captain, playing only his fifth game since a close season move from Bayern Munich, Chelsea stuck to their task. 

Penalty appeals were waved away at both ends, while Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard missed a golden opportunity to equalise, drilling the ball straight at keeper Petr Cech from close range. 

The victory over a potential title rival hoisted Chelsea into third place on 12 points. 

In Serie A, AS Roma and Palermo maintained their winning starts to the Serie A season on Sunday with victories that leave them as joint leaders. 

Chilean midfielder David Pizarro scored his first goal for Roma in their 3-1 victory at Siena with Brazilian Rodrigo Taddei and Stefano Okaka Chuka also on target. David Di Michele scored both Palermos goals in their 2-1 win away to Lazio to complete a good week for the Sicilian club who won at West Ham in the Uefa Cup on Thursday.

 Sachin lacks confidence, says Aravinda

New Delhi: Former Sri Lankan batting great Aravinda de Silva believes Sachin Tendulkars loss of form is due to acute lack of confidence. 

He has lost a great degree of confidence and is doubting his ability because of the pressure factor, added De Silva, the chief architect of Sri Lankas only World Cup success 10 years ago. 

Speaking on the sidelines of a sports channel function here on Thursday, the former Sri Lanka captain said since the arrival of Virender Sehwag, Tendulkar had changed his style by being defensive. 

However, he felt the whole of India needs to rally around him now. 

I think the whole country needs to get behind him and get the best out of him leading into the World Cup, because he will be needed badly then.

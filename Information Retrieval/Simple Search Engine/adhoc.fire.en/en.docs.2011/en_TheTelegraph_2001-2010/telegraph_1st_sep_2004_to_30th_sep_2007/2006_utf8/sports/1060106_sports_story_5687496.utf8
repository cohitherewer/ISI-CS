The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No encashment, only a Pat on return

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cash 

Chennai: It was not meant to be a lark in the park. How can it be when a 40-year-old teams up with a teenager to confront two active pros who are the second seeds? So what if the old man happens to be 1987 Wimbledon champion Pat Cash while his partner is Indias brightest 17-year-old talent Karan Rastogi? 

Cash was under no illusions while accepting a wild card to play doubles at the Chennai Open ? years after having bid goodbye to competitive tennis. He didnt harbour any hopes of winning the crown with his inexperienced partner, neither did he consider this to be a platform for a comeback to the sports mainstream. 

He still gave it all he had, showing the same seriousness and commitment he displayed while conducting a clinic at the BTA academy in Calcutta last May. As it turned out, the 53-minute duel turned out to be an enlightening experience for both Cash and Rastogi. 

It was very tough to face two guys (Germans Rainer Schuettler and Alexander Waske) who hit the ball so hard? I was finding it difficult to pick the ball up, playing under lights made it harder. You obviously need a lot of proper practice to give these guys a serious fight, Cash remarked after the straight-set defeat, as Rastogi gushed in appreciation of his fabulous partner and the several things he learned from the Aussie. 

He is out of the tournament, but Cashs week is far from over at the Chennai Open. Television commentary, the primary assignment which brought him here, will keep him occupied till Sunday night. 

Hes done TV commentary before, but this is his first stint in India. Im enjoying sharing the microphone with guys like Vijay (Amritraj) and Leander (Paes), said Cash. 

The Calcutta kids enthusiasm and willingness to learn had impressed him eight months ago. What he saw here among the senior group has left a mark on Cash as well. I have no doubt now that there is a lot of talent in India, he observed. 

As he said before, he would be only too willing to get involved with any training programme and link it up with his academy in Hope Island, Gold Coast. A second visit to Calcutta would have materialised last month had not a proposed seniors event in Bangalore fallen through. 

His academy is priority No. 1 in Cashs life. Mention music, his second love, and the eyes glisten in excitement. Im carrying my guitar on this trip? Ill be doing a small concert during the Australian Open fortnight in Melbourne where some celebrity stars will join me, followed by another in Sydney, Cash informed.

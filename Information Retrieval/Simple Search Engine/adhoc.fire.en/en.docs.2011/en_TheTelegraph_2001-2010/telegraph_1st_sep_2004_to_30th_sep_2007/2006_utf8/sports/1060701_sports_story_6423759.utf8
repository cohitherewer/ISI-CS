 Sourav manages 10

London: Former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly had another forgettable Twenty20 Cup outing, making 10 runs for Northamptonshire who were held to a thrilling tie by Somerset here on Thursday. 

However, the left-handed batsman did manage to pick two wickets in as many overs after Somerset elected to bat first and made 151 for nine in their 20 overs. 

In reply, Northamptonshire were well served by an unbeaten 49-ball 64 by Usman Afzaal. Sourav hit two fours in his 11-ball knock before edging the ball to Somerset wicketkeeper Carl Gazzard. 

Three Northants batsmen were dismissed for duck as the hosts, needing two runs off the last ball, could manage one. In his first Twenty20 match Tuesday, Sourav had scored 15 runs against Warwickshire who won by 24 runs. (PTI)

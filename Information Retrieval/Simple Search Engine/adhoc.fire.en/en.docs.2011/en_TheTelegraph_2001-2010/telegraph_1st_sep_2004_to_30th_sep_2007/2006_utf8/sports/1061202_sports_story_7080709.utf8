The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI takes the Sunny line

 - THE SOURAV GANGULY COMEBACK 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly and Greg 

 Chappell. 

Calcutta: For now, the Board of Control for 

 Cricket in India (BCCI) is taking the Sunil Gavaskar-line 

 on Sourav Gangulys comeback. Basically, that if theres 

 any tension between him and Greg Chappell, they 

 ought to sort things out themselves. 

 Both are mature... Both 

 are professionals... We dont have to take the initiative 

 in bringing them together, so to say, secretary Niranjan 

 Shah told The Telegraph on Friday, some 

 24 hours after the former Team India captain made a return 

 (for the Test series in South Africa) after nine months. 

Gavaskar, who is already in South Africa on a Media assignment, made the following comment on Thursday: They are grown up people and should be able to handle any tension, as you (the Media) term it, in the interest of the team... 

While Sourav made two comebacks in the early months of Chappells tenure, late last year, he hadnt been away from the dressing room for too long a period. This return, therefore, is different. Moreover, hes the selection committees choice. 

The dressing room-vibes are going to have an impact not just on Souravs performance, but Indias collective show. Captain Rahul Dravids attitude, by the way, will be as important as that of the coach. Perhaps, even more. 

Another BCCI official, though, disagreed with Shah. 

He said: It may not be a bad idea if the manager (Prakash Dixit) for the ODIs, who stays back till December 8 or so, gets Sourav and Chappell to quickly reach the same wavelength... Even the captain could be present at that meeting... 

Dixit isnt returning immediately after the ODIs as Chetan Desai, manager-designate for the Tests, has personal problems which need a few days to be sorted out. 

Significantly, straight-talking selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar is going to be in South Africa for the first two (if not all three) Tests. Hes the one who had a dialogue with Chappell and Dravid before the 16 got chosen. 

A former captain himself, Vengsarkar has gone on record saying he and his colleagues have selected the team for India and not any one individual. With him around, then, Sourav need not be worried about possibly getting a raw deal. 

At the same time, even he must make a gesture to signal that the past really is past. 

 While Sourav will be landing in South Africa on Monday, 

 Vengsarkar is going to be there a few days before the Test 

 series begins, on December 15.

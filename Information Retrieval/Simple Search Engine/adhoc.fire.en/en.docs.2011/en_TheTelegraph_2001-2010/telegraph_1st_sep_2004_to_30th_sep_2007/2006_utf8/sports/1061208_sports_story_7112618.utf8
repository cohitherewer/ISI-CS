 Younis Khan bereaved

Faisalabad: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan is unlikely to take any further part in the one-day series against the West Indies after his elder brother passed away in Germany. Younis came to know the tragic news after he returned to the dressing room after scoring 24 in Pakistans two-wicket win in the second match Thursday. 

We had got information about his brothers death during the match but we didnt want to disturb him by informing him about it immediately, manager Talat Ali said. 

Younis had lost another brother last year while playing the home series against England. He had died in Ukraine where he ran a business. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq said it was unlikely Younis would take any further part in the series. I really dont know but he has left for home and he was shattered, Inzamam said. 

Pakistan are also missing Mohammed Yousuf, away in Lahore with his wife, who is expecting. (PTI)

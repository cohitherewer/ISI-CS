 Sania is 32nd seed 

 - AUSTRALIAN OPEN 

 Federer, Davenport get top billing 

 Sania Mirza 

Melbourne: World number one Roger Federer and his counterpart in the womens game Lindsay Davenport were on Thursday named as the top seeds for next weeks Australian Open. 

There were few surprises in the list, which was based on the world rankings. 

Womens champion Serena Williams was named 13th seed after an injury-affected 2005. 

Williams could run into one of the top four seeds as early as the fourth round. Her sister Venus, last years Wimbledon champion, has been seeded 10th. 

Meanwhile, Sania Mirza was seeded 32 in womens singles. This is the first time that the 19-year old Hyderabadi, world ranked 34, will start her campaign in a Grand Slam event as a seeded player. World number three Andy Roddick has been installed as the mens second seed after Spains Rafael Nadal withdrew from the tournament earlier this week due to a long-standing foot injury. 

Australias Lleyton Hewitt, last years beaten finalist, has been seeded third but must wait until Fridays draw to see if he could face Federer or Roddick in the semi-finals. 

Argentinas David Nalbandian, who beat Federer last year in the season-ending Masters Cup final was seeded fourth, though he is battling a viral infection that forced him to pull out of the invitational Kooyong Classic this week. 

Belgiums Kim Clijsters, who suffered a hip injury at this weeks Sydney International, is the womens second seed with Frances Amelie Mauresmo third. 

Former world number one Maria Sharapova, battling a shoulder injury to be fit in time for the tournament which begins on Monday, has been seeded fourth and heads a list of nine seeded Russian women. 

Prakash, Rohan up 

Meanwhile, in the mens singles qualifiers, Prakash Amritraj stormed into the second round after upsetting the 14th seed Peter Wessels of The Netherlands in straight sets. 

The 256-ranked Indian packed off the former world No. 72 with a convincing 6-3, 6-1 win in 55 minutes. 

Rohan Bopanna won a keenly contested first round match in the qualifiers beating Yohny Romero of Venezuala 7-5, 6-3. However, Harsh Mankad failed to clear the first hurdle as he went down against Giorgia Galimberti of Italy 6-1, 6-3. 

In the womens qualifiers, Shikha Uberoi came out unscathed to score a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) win against Henrieta Nogyova of Slovakia. (Agencies)

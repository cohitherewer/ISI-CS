The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 More than meets the eye

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Durban: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) hasnt made anything public, but it appears theres more to the controversial Shoaib Akhtars omission from the Test squad for South Africa than meets the eye. 

According to The Telegraphs sources in Pakistan, Shoaib had a problem during the recent Twenty20 matches. It seems he wanted to be paid for wearing the sponsors logo, is what one source said. 

Its not clear how that was resolved, but the gentleman added Shoaib also got into a row with the PCB over signing the central contract. Nobody may go on record, but he has actually been disciplined, the source pointed out. 

Clearly, Shoaib doesnt learn.

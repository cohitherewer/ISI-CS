 Englands sense of deja vu

Adelaide: Doubts about the fitness of Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath have left England wondering whether history may be about to repeat itself in the second Ashes Test starting at the Adelaide Oval on Friday. 

Australia lead the five-match series 1-0 after their convincing 277-run victory in Brisbane last week but there is a sense of deja vu about McGraths foot injury. 

Australia easily won the first Test of last years Ashes series in England but eventually lost the series 1-2 after McGrath injured himself on the morning of the second Test. 

England skipper Andrew Flintoff said the tourists were not relying on McGrath missing the Adelaide Test but there was still a familiar feeling in the camp going into the second match one-down. 

I think the atmosphere going into this Test is very similar to last time, Flintoff said. 

The Australians have also been mindful of what happened last year, with skipper Ricky Ponting determined not to let any hint of complacency slip into their game.

 No evidence of tampering: Waqar

Melbourne: Pakistans bowling coach Waqar Younis has asserted that the ball that was the source of The Oval Test controversy bore no evidence of tampering. 

I went straight into the Referees room and asked to see the ball. There was nothing wrong ... I promise you, there was nothing wrong with it, Waqar was quoted as saying in a Sydney paper Friday. 

There were 30-odd cameras at the ground that didnt see anything. So you would think that there had to be something wrong with the ball for Darell (Hair) to do what he did. 

But I promise. I saw the ball and there was nothing wrong with it. 

Waqar denied he was instrumental in Pakistans refusal to take the field after tea, leading to the forfeiture. I dont think anyone really expected it to aggravate so much, he said. 

When we came back at the tea break, Inzy and the whole team were asking, why did Hair do it? (PTI)

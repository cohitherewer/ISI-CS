 Sabina Park to host India

Kingston (Jamaica): The Sabina Park Cricket Ground here was set to host matches of the Indian tour after the hosts and contractors of the World Cup Stadium arrived at an agreement this week. The announcement came as Jamaica Cricket 2007 (JC), in charge of the reconstruction of the Sabina Park Stadium, issued an ultimatum to the contractors to complete the project by October, 2006. 

India are to tour the West Indies from May 12 to July 5. 

The contractors, Ashtrom, had requested for an extension of deadline to February, 2007, and at the earliest by November, 2006, at an additional cost of $1.75 million. 

Ashtrom had further said that no cricket match shall be played at the venue during the construction period. 

The contractors cited the cement crisis in the Caribbean, issues related to road laying, foundation redesign and delay in obtaining building permits as reasons for their inability to complete the project in time. 

JC, however, summarily rejected their argument, saying that with the exception of cement crisis, all other issues had already been taken into account when the original deadline of April, 2006, was extended to October. (PTI)

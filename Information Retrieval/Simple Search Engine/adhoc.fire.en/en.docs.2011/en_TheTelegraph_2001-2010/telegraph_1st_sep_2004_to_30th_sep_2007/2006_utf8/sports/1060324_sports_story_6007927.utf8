 Dortmund: After weeks of 

 unrelenting attacks from the German media and soccer elite, 

 coach Juergen Klinsmann is hoping Germanys 4-1 dismantling 

 of an undermanned US team has earned him some peace and 

 quiet.

 This win will allow us to 

 carry on in the next few weeks in a much calmer atmosphere, 

 a visibly relieved Klinsmann assured reporters after the 

 resounding victory in Dortmunds chilly Westfalen stadium 

 on Wednesday night.

 However, the pressure and second-guessing 

 of the German side and their coach is unlikely to subside 

 as the clock ticks down to a World Cup whose outcome is 

 intricately tied to the mood and confidence of the entire 

 nation.

 A top-selling German daily , which 

 has done its fair share of Klinsmann bashing in the past 

 weeks, had a picture of a grinning Klinsmann on its cover 

 next to the headline, Klinsi, now you can grinsi 

 and the caption Job Saved.

 But the paper could not help taking 

 a dig at the same time, noting that Klinsmann, who has come 

 under enormous criticism for returning home to southern 

 California in between matches, would be getting back on 

 a plane to the United States on Sunday.

 Germany crushed a US side missing 

 most of their top players thanks to a dipping free-kick 

 from Bayern Munich midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger on 

 46 minutes and quick-fire goals from Oliver Neuville, Miroslav 

 Klose and captain Michael Ballack midway through the second 

 half. (Reuters)

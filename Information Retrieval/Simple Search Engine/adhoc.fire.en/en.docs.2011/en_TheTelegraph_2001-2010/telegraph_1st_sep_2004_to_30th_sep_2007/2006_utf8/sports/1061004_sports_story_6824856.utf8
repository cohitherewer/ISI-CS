New Delhi: Captain Brian Lara said the West Indies would not experiment with their batting order and play their best possible XI in the Champions Trophy. 

There is no question of experimentation in the Champions Trophy, Lara said. 

Experiments are done keeping in view the importance of match and tournament. This is a mini-World Cup and being the defending champions were also under pressure and so we will field our best eleven, he added. 

The worlds highest run-getter in Tests, however, agreed that their experiments were beneficial in Malaysia. 

Lara, however, said: Well have to look at every aspect of our game, whether it is batting, bowling or fielding, to win the trophy again. Matches are won by all round display of skills. 

Lara expressed hope that the team would improve further before the World Cup as they have to play a lot of cricket in the build-up to the quadrennial event. 

Lara said the West Indies have to qualify for the main draw and they would not take any opposition lightly. Zimbabwe and Bangladesh were also capable of upsets. Bangladesh have even defeated world champions Australia. We cant commit such mistakes, he said. 

Meanwhile, the West Indies will take on GCA Presidents XI in a practice match scheduled to be played at Motera on Wednesday. Zimbabwe will also take on the same side on Thursday. 

Both the West Indies and Zimbabwean players arrived in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, the West Indies on Tuesday heaved a huge sigh of relief after Kentucky Fried Chicken stepped in as their team sponsors for the Champions Trophy. 

The Caribbean have communications company Digicel as their long-term team sponsors but the players would not be able to display that logo during the biennial event due to ambush marketing rules of the ICC. (PTI)

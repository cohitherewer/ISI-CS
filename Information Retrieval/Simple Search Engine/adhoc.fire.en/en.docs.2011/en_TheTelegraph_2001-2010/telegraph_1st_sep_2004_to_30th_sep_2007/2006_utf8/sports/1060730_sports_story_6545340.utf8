Manchester: Spinner Monty Panesar destroyed Pakistans top-order to inspire England to a crushing innings and 120-run defeat on Day III of the second Test on Saturday. 

The left-arm spinner, who has rapidly gained cult status among England fans, took five for 72 as Pakistan, 342 runs behind after the first innings, were dismissed for 222 in the final session of the day at Old Trafford. 

Strike bowler Steve Harmison, who took a remarkable six for 19 in the first innings, swept away the lower order with five for 52 and claim the first 10-wicket haul of his Test career. 

He was also the first bowler to take 10 wickets in an Old Trafford Test since Jim Lakers extraordinary 10 for 90 against Australia 50 years ago. No other England bowler took a wicket in the entire match. 

It wasnt far off the perfect game, to be honest, said England skipper Andrew Strauss. If you had to write down on a piece of paper how you wanted to win a Test match that would have been pretty similar to what happened this week. It was a pretty easy game to captain. 

The 24-year-old Panesar, turning the ball sharply and extracting surprising bounce, snared Pakistans key men, Mohammed Yousuf (15) and skipper Inzamam-ul Haq (13), in the space of three overs in the afternoon before adding vice-captain Younis Khan (62) to his list of victims. 

He got Yousuf for the second time in the match with the first ball after lunch. Yousuf, who had saved Pakistan in the first Test with a double century, was lured forward and beaten by the spin.

New Delhi: India lost 1-4 in their Davis Cup Asia Oceania group I tie against South Korea in Changwon on Sunday. 

Rohan Bopanna lost to Hyung Taik Lee 3-6, 1-6, 2-6 in the first reverse singles, while Prakash Amritraj was defeated 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 by Jun Woong-Sun in the second reverse singles, according to information received here. 

Meanwhile, coach Nandan Bal said that the loss has showed that India still need Leander Paes to win the singles matches. India now play Pakistan in the first play-off after the subcontinent rivals lost to Chinese Taipei 3-2 in another first round Asia-Oceania zone tie. 

Bal said India need to quickly unearth some singles talent and till then would have to look up to Paes to deliver the goods. 

It is clear that one doubles point is not getting us anywhere. Having said that, Leander himself has another two years in him. We will have to look to him in the next two years, and hopefully by that time we will have a few players, Bal said. 

Bal said that Paes did not play singles against Korea because he thought the youngsters, Bopanna and Amritraj, were in better form. 

It was just that he was not ready, he has never ruled himself out of playing singles. You must remember he played the opening match against Uzbekistan, Bal said. 

Bal said Bopanna opened strongly, but had to bow to the might of 89th ranked. 

Rohan was outplayed. Lee was the best player in the tie, he said. Rohan played a good first set. 

He was right up with Lee till 3-3, and was up 30-15 when one bad point changed the game. Lee went 4-3 up, and from there he stepped up his game. 

Bal said complacency and poor form let Amritraj down in the dead rubber. 

Prakash played a bad first set but got back in the second. In the third, he left the fight back too late, the coach said. 

In the third set, he was 5-5, but then became a little complacent. In sport, you must make the opponent fight back, but Prakash was always catching up with his rival. 

India have now lost all their four away ties to Korea. And that Sun was the hosts fourth choice as a singles player must have hurt Amritraj more. 

Bal, however, said the elements had a huge role to play. 

I wont say the players were lacking. The conditions played a big role. We have beaten the same Koreans all times when we played them on our soil, he said. 

It was tough to get going. It was freezing out there, and took a lot of time to just get the fingers moving. 

Bal also revealed that Harsh Mankad was not picked for the tie because he did not make himself available for selection. 

India have a 5-0 head to head record over Pakistan, whom they played last in 1973 at a neutral venue, Kuala Lumpur, owing to the post-war situation. The previous tie was hosted by India and the venue for the first round play-off would in all probability be decided by the toss of the coin. 

The bottomline is the awareness that has grown in Asia. Pakistan beat Thailand in Thailand last year, and came close to beating Chinese Taipei today, Bal said. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pereira belief

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira believes his team is destined to win the CFL Premier Division title. We took it as a game before the final. But its no bad luck that we couldnt seal the title today, the Brazilian said after the Saturdays draw. 

May be its destiny that God wants us to win the title on home ground (on Tuesday), he added. 

According to Subhas Bhowmick, the result was no revenge for the first-leg loss and his team merely delayed the inevitable by denying the rivals a win. .

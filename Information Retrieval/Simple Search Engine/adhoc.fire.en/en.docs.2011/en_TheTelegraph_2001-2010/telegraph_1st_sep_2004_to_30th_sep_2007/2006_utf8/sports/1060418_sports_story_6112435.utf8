 Mahindra, EBs acid test is in Margao: Barreto

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Barreto 

New Delhi: Three days before Mahindra United take on East Bengal in the crucial National Football League (NFL) encounter at the Cooperage in Mumbai, Jose Ramirez Barreto seems to have a lot of sympathy for Bhaichung Bhutia. 

Calling the East Bengal striker as the one who has been criticised too often for no fault of his own, the ace Brazilian goalgetter thought every performer has to go through such things in life at some point or the other. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from his Mumbai residence, Barreto admitted that the Indian captain is currently enjoying a great run. But see how he was dismissed as a player whose time was up only a few months back. But then, thats the life of a performer. Every performer goes through it sooner or later, Barreto said rather philosophically. 

I also had to face the same problem when I thought of coming back to Mohun Bagan. The then Mohun Bagan coach called me an old horse and raised doubts about my abilities. I proved him wrong after I joined Mahindra. 

Barreto, however, like a true professional, said Bhaichung will be checkmated on Thursday. Three of our top players ? NS Manju, Surkumar Singh and Steven Dias ? will be back in the side for the East Bengal match. Bhaichung will find it difficult to play with the same fluency, Barreto said. 

Barreto, arguably the best foreign footballer to play in India, did not agree with the suggestion that Mahindra-East Bengal match could be the final of the league. The match may go a long way to decide the 1-2 positions, but not the final. The acid test will be in Margao when both the teams travel to play there. Beating the Goan teams in Goa is always difficult. 

Apart from the close run for the title between the Mumbai and the Calcutta outfits, Barreto does not find the NFL too exciting. I first came here in 2000. Today I dont find any difference between the NFL then and NFL now, he said. I wont say things have deteriorated, but the scenario also hasnt improved much. Look at the Fransa problem. One team just withdrew and refused to play. These things will hardly do any good to the game. 

NFL, Barreto thinks, should be more competitive. In India, the competition remains confined within two or three teams. The battle this time is between Mahindra and East Bengal only. Sporting Clube de Goa have the ability to give a fight, but they are too inconsistent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The CFL Super Division tie between West Bengal Police and SAIL had to be abandoned after 20 minutes because of unplayable conditions at Rabindra Sarobar Stadium. The score was 1-1 at that stage. Neither team wanted to continue and the referee agreed.

 Tollygunge Agragami pipped Calcutta Customs by a Dipankar Chatterjee goal at Kalyani Stadium, while Mithun Dey and Rana Adhikari found the target at Howrah Stadium to give Peerless full points against CFC.

 With the national camp for the Asian Cup tie against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah beginning later this week in Goa and the top teams set to miss several India players, the IFA has called a meeting of the eight Premier Division outfits and Calcutta League sponsors Sahara on Friday to sort out a ticklish issue. The IFA was committed to finish the Premier Division by September 27, but wont be able to do so if teams refuse to play.

 Mohun Bagans match against Eastern Railway on Wednesday has been shifted to the Barasat Stadium on the green-and-maroons request. Biswajit Bhattacharyas team, which has lost two matches and drawn one in the CFL Premier Division, hasnt been happy with conditions at home ground. Meanwhile, Endem Guy Herve signed for Mohun Bagan on Monday.

 Garia beat Esplanade B 4-0 in the pre-quarter final of The Telegraph Partnership Cup (south zone) on Monday.

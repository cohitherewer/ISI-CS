 Speed: West Indies have the right to organise

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The chief executive of the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Thursday that the shorter version of the game will return to its rightful place when the West Indies host the World Cup in March next year. 

Speed, who was talking during the unveiling function of the World Cup logo in the capital, said that cricket, especially the one-day version, owes a huge debt to the West Indies. When one-day cricket was at its infancy, it was the West Indies who played a great role in popularising the game. West Indies, I feel, have the right to organise the championships. 

The Prime Minister of Grenada, Keith Mitchell, who was also present at the function along with Chris Dehring, the managing director and CEO of the World Cup 2007, said the entire Caribbean is geared up to make the World Cup a success. We are developing countries in the West Indies. But everyone has risen to the challenge. Caribbean, as you know, is the safest and the most peaceful place in the world.Dehring, whose speech turned out to be most interesting, said: we gave the world the one-day cricket. We also played Test cricket, but in the one-day style.

 Chandigarh: It is not the England batsmen, but the fickle weather in Mohali that is keeping the Indian thinktank worried. If Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh have raised hopes of a victory in the second Test, forecast of another round of unseasonal showers on Monday may just spoil the show. 

The wicket has already shown signs of turn and the perennial problem of the Englishmen wilting under these circumstances has put them in a spot of bother. As Kumble and Harbhajan kept it going from both ends with discipline and consistency, the visitors didnt show the application needed to survive on this sort of wicket. 

At close on the penultimate day of this TVS Cup Test, England were ahead only by 74 runs with five wickets remaining. Their hopes lay with captain Andrew Flintoff, but the manner in which they lost the top-five batsmen in the final session will sure not provide the Barmy Army with much enthusiasm. Had the Indians managed to hold on to a few more chances in the close-in cordon, England would have been in much deeper waters. 

It was scintillating stuff as the worlds best spinning combination set about their task. Harbhajan was introduced only after six overs and he justified Rahul Dravids decision with intelligent use of the flight and subtle variation in line. With Kumble at his lethal best from the other end, the batsmen struggled to read the flippers, the googlies and the doosras. 

Kevin Pietersen tried to hit out the attack in desperation. He was though unlucky to have been given out caught at first slip by Darrel Hair when the ball had come off his forearm. It was the off-spinners first wicket in this Test and couldnt help turn emotional at his home ground. 

However, it was the new entrant to the 500-club who proved to be the most successful. Kumble started off by removing Andrew Strauss when the ball settled in Mahendra Singh Dhonis gloves after coming off the batsmans bat, boot and pad. 

Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell ? who made a well-compiled 57 ? were his other victims. Bell couldnt hide his disappointment after the days action. I really wanted to be out there tomorrow morning after doing all the hard work. It was a top spinner and quite short. I didnt get close enough to the ball, Bell said. 

Despite Kumble and Harbhajan reaping the rewards, Munaf Patel had set the adrenalin flowing in his opening spell. Bowling at an average pace of 88 mph, he got the ball to cut off the seam. The batsmen were often forced to defend on the backfoot and were relieved to see him removed after five overs. Hardly did they then know that more misery was waiting for them in the wings. 

The first two sessions, however, belonged to the Indian late-order that has been regularly delivering in the Greg Chappell era. On Sunday they added 32 runs more than what their top five managed. That the famed top-order managed 153 was mainly due to a responsible 95 from the Team India captain. 

 Dravid never flinched during the fiery spell from the English pacers Saturday evening and was positive Sunday, too. With Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard not being able to extract the same amount of bounce and movement, batting was comparatively easier. Even Dhonis early dismissal, failing to get away from the line of another rising delivery, failed to disturb his concentration. 

There were no lose shots, and sensing the circumstances, he anchored one end with poise and confidence. The 322-minute stay included ten boundaries, and, more importantly, he had built a platform from where the rest could carry on. Unfortunately a low delivery from Flintoff led to his dismissal in the Nineties, the ninth time in his career. 

 Irfan Pathan and Harbhajans flamboyant batting 

 ensured India got the 38-run lead. Kumble played the anchors 

 role to perfection after Dravids departure. The England 

 attack looked woefully out of ideas in the face of Pathan 

 (52 off 58 balls, 5x4, 1x6) and Harbhajans (36 off 

 41 balls, 7x4) lusty hitting.

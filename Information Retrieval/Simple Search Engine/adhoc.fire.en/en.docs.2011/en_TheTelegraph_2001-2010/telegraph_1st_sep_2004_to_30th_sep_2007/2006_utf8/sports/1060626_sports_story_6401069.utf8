 Battle of heart and mind for Ghanaians

Accra: When Ghanaian chief Nii Azumah the fifth sits down on Tuesday to watch the countrys soccer team play Brazil for a place in the World Cup quarter finals, his loyalties will be divided. 

He is one of an estimated 2,000 direct descendants of a group of 70 Brazilian slaves who bought their freedom and returned to the continent of their ancestors nearly two centuries ago. 

I call myself a Ghanaian. In my mind, I will support Brazil, but in my heart it is Ghana. In my mind, my descendants are from that place, no matter what, I should be with them, Azumah said. 

If it had been any other team, I would have supported Brazil 100 per cent. But I was born, bred and educated in Ghana. So I have to support Ghana, he said. 

Azumahs great grandfather was a leader of the first Tabon, so called by Ghanaians when they heard the new arrivals reply Ta Bom (Im fine) to the Portuguese greeting of Como Esta (how are you?). He is now the chief of the Tabon. 

I am very, very proud, I am very proud of my ancestors, my family, almost everything that constitutes (being) a Tabon, said Azumah, who has never been to Brazil. 

Four-time winner of the African Cup of Nations, the Ghanaian football team earned the nickname the African Brazilians in homage to the world champions, Brazil. 

The links between the two countries were forged by the slave trade, which saw hundreds of thousands of West Africans sold to the Caribbean, Brazil and America. 

Many freed Brazilian slaves returned to West Africa, settling in Ghana, Nigeria, Togo and Benin and their presence is still visible in the seaside heart of old Accra, Jamestown, where the dilapidated Brazil House stands on Brazil Lane.

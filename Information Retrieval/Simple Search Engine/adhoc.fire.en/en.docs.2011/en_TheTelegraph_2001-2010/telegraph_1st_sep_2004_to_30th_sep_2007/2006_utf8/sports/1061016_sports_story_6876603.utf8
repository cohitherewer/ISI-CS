 Jeev finishes tied 21st

Kawagoe: A visibly weakened Jeev Milkha Singh failed to stop a further slide as he shot a second successive three-over 74 and finished tied 21st in the Japan Open golf championships. 

It was one of the rare finishes outside top-10 on Japan Tour for Jeev this season. 

Jeev had one birdie and four bogeys on a difficult scoring day when only a handful of players came under par. Even defending champion Shingo Katayama (73) found things difficult and after leading in early stages of the tournament. 

He finished the last day with a four-over 75 and ended tied fifth. 

Paul Sheehan of Australia grabbed the title with a final round of even-par 71 and he was seven-under 277 to win the 40-million yen first prize. He was three shots clear of second placed Yano Azumo (71). 

Katsuma Miyamoto (69) and Takuyu Taniguchi (73) were tied third and five players were tied fifth at two-under in this low scoring tournament.

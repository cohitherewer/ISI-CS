The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont intend returning to full-time coaching

 - I had a strong feeling that Sourav would come to South Africa: Kepler Wessels 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Johannesburg: 

 Kepler Wessels, who left the coachs job at Northants 

 rather abruptly earlier this year, has no plans to again 

 wear the same hat anywhere. At least, not now. 

 I did four years at the 

 County and, before that, Id put in three with Eastern 

 Province... Now that Ive taken a break, I dont 

 intend returning to the same job on a full-time basis. Of 

 course, Im coaching privately, the former South 

 African captain told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Wanderers on Friday, Kepler added: I did leave Northants before the season ended, but Id reached a point where a break was needed... Also, I wanted the management to make some changes, but the finances werent there... 

Kepler, who played international cricket for Australia as well, has been succeeded by one-time England player David Capel. 

Asked whether his sudden departure could impact on son Rikis career at the County, Kepler grinned and said: No... On the contrary, I think he will do better... He made it on merit, but was under pressure because his father was the coach... 

The younger Wessels is on contract with Northants till the end of the 2007 season. 

Kepler, who had a big hand in Sourav Gangulys recruitment on a short-term arrangement (June-July), expressed delight at his recall. I knew the Indian batsmen would find conditions difficult and realised the thinktank would have to fall back on experience... I actually had a strong feeling that Sourav would come to South Africa... 

Why didnt Sourav make a big impression at the County? 

Because hed come to Northants with no preparation and had his first game within a couple of days... Basically, he needed time to acclimatise, but didnt get that... Its a pity he didnt leave the mark he wouldve liked, was Keplers answer. 

Kepler, of course, expects the former India captain to come good in the Test series. Sourav has courage and is determined... Plus, he has the experience... He has, in the past, proven himself. 

 Most would say keep fingers crossed to 

 that.

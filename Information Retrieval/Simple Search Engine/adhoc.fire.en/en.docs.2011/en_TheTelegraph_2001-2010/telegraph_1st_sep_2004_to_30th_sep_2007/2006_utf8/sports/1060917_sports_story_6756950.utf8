 The Great Indian Escape...

 - Mitchell Johnson excels, but will still go home with 2 others; Ricky Ponting may rest tomorrow

Kuala Lumpur: If the Indians felt cheated by the Duckworth/Lewis Method on Thursday, theyve got to thank the elements for managing two points against Australia, on Saturday. The proverbial Great Escape, really, at the Kinrara Oval. 

Set a revised target of 170 from 29 overs, after a lengthy rain interruption (second of the day), the Indians were tottering on 35 for five (eight overs) when the DLF Cup match had to be halted once more. A resumption wasnt possible and, so, the four points got shared. 

Its a mystery why the tournament doesnt have a reserve day. A bigger mystery, actually, is why its being held in September, when rains are as common as traffic snarls in this capital city. 

Yes, were definitely relieved... I wouldve been happier playing the full 50 overs, but we cant control such things, remarked captain Rahul Dravid. It didnt help that the asking rate of 4.90, at the start of the innings, soared after the revision. 

There were too many things on our minds... The Duckworth/Lewis had to be looked at, our approach had to change and, because of the rain, conditions were ideal for new ball bowlers... We probably rushed it a bit and there are lessons to learn on playing the new ball, Dravid added. 

He didnt forget to compliment young left-armer Mitchell Johnson, hailed by the iconic Dennis Lillee as a once in a generation bowler. 

The 24-year-old Queenslander swung the ball at a handsome pace and got it to seam, too. He got all four wickets which fell to bowlers (Virender Sehwag was run out) and has had a terrific week: In the opener, his victims included Brian Lara. 

Despite a sterling show, though, Johnson is leaving for home on Sunday. Michael Cosgrove and Phil Jaques are going to be on the same flight. According to captain Ricky Ponting, this had been decided upon even before the team arrived here. 

I couldnt have got the decision reversed, he maintained and saluted Johnson thus: He has the right attributes... Hits the right areas, has pace and enough swing... Some seam as well... 

Reflecting on the match, Ponting said: We probably did have it in our bag... It wasnt an easy wicket to bat on... He didnt say so, but the psychological advantage will be with Australia when the teams meet next on Friday, in the last league engagement. 

Theres a chance, by the way, that Ponting may rest himself in Mondays match versus the West Indies. If that happens, Michael Hussey is going to captain. 

Glenn McGrath didnt pick up a wicket, but bowled great overs. In fact, Sachin Tendulkar got hit on the helmet when he ducked into the first ball from the champion. Later, Dravid revealed hed asked his young quicks to learn from McGrath. 

Its not always nice facing him, but even after being off cricket for months, he can come back and land the ball exactly where he wants... One has to admire, Dravid observed. Irfan Pathan, for one, certainly needs to learn a thing or two. 

Dravid accepted that Pathan was struggling and added we would like him to get better, but concern would be too strong a word to use... He wasnt given the new ball as Munaf (Patel) and Ajit (Agarkar) looked best suited to open. 

Earlier, allrounder Shane Watson made the most of being made to open for the first time by top-scoring (79). Michael Clarke got another half-century (64), but the first sessions stand-out performance came from Harbhajan Singh (10-0-24-2). In patches, Munaf was also impressive. 

Watsons success has given Ponting and John Buchanan one more option. For the rest of the world, another headache. 

 Footnote: The Malaysian Cricket Association 

 is understood to have hired a tantrik to ward 

 off rain, but the move hasnt been working. The 

 gentleman may say hes not used to day-night matches! 

 quipped a source of The Telegraph. According to him, 

 such tantriks usually guarantee there wont 

 be rain. Hiring them for big occasions is a common 

 feature in these parts.

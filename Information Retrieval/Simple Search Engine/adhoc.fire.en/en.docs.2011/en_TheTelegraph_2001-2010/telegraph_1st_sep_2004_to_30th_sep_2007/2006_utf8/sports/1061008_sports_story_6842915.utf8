 Mushtaq fired as assistant coach

 - Musharraf responsible for this mess: PPP 

 Mushtaq 

Islamabad: Criticising the appointment of Dr Nasim Ashraf, the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), headed by former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, has accused President Pervez Musharraf of messing up cricket in the country by appointing his favourites to head the cricket board. 

PPP senator Muhammad Enver Baig said in a statement that the countrys cricket had been messed up beyond redemption with the appointment of Dr Ashraf as the new chairman of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). 

It is a clear case of favouritism that has nothing to do with merit, he said. 

The new chairman of the board has already started making knee-jerk decisions and further messing up the sport by re-appointing Younis Khan as the captain just before the departure of the team for India, he said. 

On the same day, the new chairman also sacked leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed as the assistant coach of the team for the Champions Trophy. 

Mushtaqs sacking would definitely not go down well with regular captain Inzamam-ul Haq, presently serving a four-match ban in the wake of The Oval fiasco. 

It is no secret that Shaharyar had named Mushtaq as assistant coach to appease Inzamam who has wielded great authority in the last three years. 

The former bowler was appointed despite reservations from the International Cricket Council over his role in the match-fixing scandal that rocked Pakistan cricket between 1998 and 2000. 

While welcoming Shaharyars move to step down after a controversy-ridden tenure capped by The Oval fiasco, Baig said Pakistan cricket was already at low ebb and now it was doomed.

 Riquelme magic quells heroic Ivorians

Hamburg: It made for a remarkable and dramatic contrast: Ivory Coasts enthusiastic all-action, hard-pressing game and the subtle surgical incisions of Juan Roman Riquelmes lethal passing. It was captivating stuff: while Didier Drogbas team bustled and fought with heartening enthusiasm, it was the Argentine playmaker, rarely venturing above walking pace, who decided this game, setting up both goals with his unerring vision and crisp delivery (as reported in Sundays CM edition). 

The Ivorians fought back heroically but the damage inflicted by the Villarreal maestro was jscust too much. This victory sends an ominous signal to the rest of the world: Argentina are a force to be reckoned with. Ivory Coast were far from pushovers and if not for some outstanding defensive work by Roberto Ayala ? who won his 101st cap ? they could have even sprung a surprise. 

As it was, Drogba secured reward for his sides swashbuckling approach with a thumped left-footed finish with just 10 minutes left. By then the neutrals in the crowd had been utterly won over and a cacophony of whistles greeted every attempt at Argentine time-wasting. 

When Maxi Rodriguez floated the ball into the net with seconds left, there was genuine dismay that the Elephants fightback had been quelled. When the crowd realised the linesman had his flagged raised, it was celebrated like a goal. As the pressure mounted with the final whistle approaching, the Argentines must have been relieved that Riquelme had already done his work. 

Meanwhile, Coach Jose Pekerman picked out Hernan Crespo for special praise after the match. Hernan played a great game, Pekerman said. Im very happy for him he scored his first goal here and I hope hell score more. 

Pekerman also had kind words for the fans and for former captain Diego Maradona, who was watching from the stands. Id like to say thanks to Diego Maradona. He has provided us with words of support.

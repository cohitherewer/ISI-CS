 New York: Roger Federer 

 took the first step towards what he hopes will be a third 

 consecutive US Open title when he cruised past Taiwans 

 Wang Yeu-tzuoo 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 in the first round on Wednesday.

 The world No. 1 was at his effortless 

 best as he raced to victory in just one hour 41 minutes.

 Fist-pumping second seed Rafael Nadal hammered wildcard 

 Mark Philippoussis to march into the second round. 

 While Nadal advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory, fourth 

 seed David Nalbandian survived a major scare in his first-round 

 match but defeated 128th ranked Michael Berrer of Germany, 

 4-6, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5, 6-2.

 Womens top seed Amelie Mauresmo completed her rain-suspended 

 match with Kristina Barrois, defeating the German qualifier 

 6-1, 7-5.

 A day after rain wiped out nearly all of the scheduled matches, 

 large crowds at Flushing Meadows welcomed the tennis despite 

 an overcast day with possible showers looming.

 The 20-year-old Nadal, who has never advanced past the third 

 round of the Open, set the tone for the match by breaking 

 Philippoussis serve in the first game.

 The double French Open champion pumped his fist and roared 

 with each key point in the two-hour, three-minute match. 

 I played very aggressive today, said Nadal, 

 who broke Philippoussis once in each set.

 Philippoussis, the Open runner-up in 1998, blasted 19 aces 

 but committed 35 unforced errors. Losing his serve in the 

 opening game of the match was pivotal, Nadal said.

 Philippoussis is a very big server, said Nadal. 

 His serve is unbelievable, especially his first serve 

 sometimes three aces in one game. But I played an 

 unbelievable first game..

 Nadal played magnificently against the 29-year-old Australian, 

 committing only 10 unforced errors while never losing his 

 service.

 Mauresmos victory over Barrois sets up a second-round 

 match against American Meghann Shaughnessy.

 After the rain forced the suspension of her match, Mauresmo 

 opened play on Wednesday a set up but 5-2 down in the second 

 to the world number 131. Although the 6-foot-tall (1.83 

 m) Barrois got within two points of levelling the match 

 at one set apiece, Mauresmo won five consecutive games to 

 secure the victory. In other matches, Serbian 16th seed 

 Ana Ivanovic had a tough time with Russian Vera Dushevina 

 but prevailed 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.

 Marat Safin, Open winner in 2000, set up an intriguing second-round 

 showdown with Nalbandian after defeating Robin Vik of the 

 Czech Republic 6-1, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Former champion Lleyton 

 Hewitt eased into the second round with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-3 

 triumph over Spaniard Albert Montanes. 

 Meanwhile, Andre Agassi has had another injection in his 

 troublesome back as he looks to end his career on a high 

 note at the US Open.

 The 36-year-old American, due to retire after the tournament, 

 had the injection on Tuesday, the day after his battling 

 four-set win over Andrei Pavel of Romania in Round I.

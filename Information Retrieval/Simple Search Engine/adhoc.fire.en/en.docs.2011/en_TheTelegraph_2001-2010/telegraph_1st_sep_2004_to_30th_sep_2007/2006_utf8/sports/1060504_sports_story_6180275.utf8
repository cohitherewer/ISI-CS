 Rooney has more than one fracture

 - Itll take a miracle for him to play the finals, says Eriksson

London: Wayne Rooney has broken more than one bone in his foot and may need a miracle to play at the World Cup, England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson said on Wednesday. 

Asked if the Manchester United forward had a chance of still going to the finals in Germany, Eriksson said: I think so. Miracles happen in life now and then? but I really dont know. 

Pressed as to whether a miracle was needed after Saturdays injury against Chelsea, the Swede would only say: Maybe. 

England meet Paraguay in their World Cup group opener in Frankfurt on June 10. Eriksson must name his squad by May 15. 

Eriksson said he would probably still name the inspirational 20-year-old in his provisional squad on Monday. 

Rooney is expected to be sidelined for at least six weeks by the injury and, if he plays at all, would only realistically be available if England reach the latter stages of the World Cup. 

Eriksson said Rooney had suffered more than one fracture at Stamford Bridge. Its a serious injury and I will be updated tomorrow (Thursday) because our doctor will be going up to Manchester, said the Swede. 

I will not rule him out until the doctors tell me there is no chance... Everyone hopes that he can take part in the World Cup at some stage. 

I would be stupid to say that its not bad if he cant play at the World Cup ? it would be like Brazil missing Ronaldinho, France missing (Thierry) Henry ? hes one of our absolute best players, Eriksson said. 

You cant replace him because hes unique. You cant replace Ronaldinho because you dont have two Ronaldinhos. But anyhow we have a very good team, a very good squad and Im convinced that we are going to do a very, very good World Cup. 

Eriksson said he had a long chat on Tuesday with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson who said on Monday he thought it unlikely Rooney would play any part in the finals. 

Hes going to stay in Manchester to do all the recovery, hes going to stay there until hes football fit. 

England midfielder Frank Lampard spoke to Rooney on Wednesday and said the United forward remains optimistic he will be fit to play at least some part in the finals. 

After having a scan he said there were two breaks and it was no more serious than it was a couple of days ago, said Lampard after Rooney had accidentally phoned him. 

He was optimistic and has got a great team around him to get him fit. He is naturally a positive person and if anyone can get fit it will be him.

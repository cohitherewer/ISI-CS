 Bhaichung set to emulate Manna

 - Asian Games Captaincy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bhutia 

New Delhi: Mohun Bagan striker Bhaichung Bhutia is all set to emulate the feat of legendary defender Sailen Manna in leading India in back-to-back Asian Games. 

On Thursday, the Indian team management, currently camping in Goa, once again chose Bhutia to lead a 23-member Indian in the Asia Cup qualifiers against Yemen on November 15. 

Since the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has decided to send the same team to Doha for the Asian Games after playing three practice matches in Dubai, it is natural that Bhutia would continue to lead the team in the Asian Games. 

Three players, however, will return back from Dubai as only a 20-member squad can be registered for Asian Games. 

It will be decided by the chief coach Bob Houghton after the tour of Dubai. 

Sailen Manna led India in two Asian Games in 1951 (New Delhi) and 1954 (Manila). Bhutia was the captain in 2002 Asian Games in Busan. He played his first Asian Games in Bangkok in 1998. Under the Asian Games rule, a squad is not eligible to register more than three over-23 players. 

While Bhutia is one of the three seniors, Houghton has decided to opt for goalkeeper Sandip Nandy and defender Deepak Mondal as the other two. 

Ironically, none of the four campers who have failed to make the side seem to have lost their places on form. 

While goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee and midfielder Reneddy Singh have not been selected because they are over-23, Sanjeev Maria has been excluded due to injury. Climax Lawrence has not attended the camp. 

There is an uncertainty over Chandam Chitrasens accompanying the team to Yemen as his passport has expired. 

 In case he fails to make the Yemen trip, the Churchill Brothers midfielder may join the squad in Dubai.

 Arjun Atwal misses cut

Fort Worth (Texas): Daniel Chopra went on a birdie spree as he brought home a six-under 64 to give himself a chance of a good top-10 finish in the $6 million Bank of America Colonial tournament. 

Chopra, who shot a par 70 in first round, added a 64 on the par-70 course, to come to six-under for 36 holes and was in tied 13th place. 

Arjun Atwal was still out-of-form and his one-over 71 could not prevent him from crashing out and missing the cut. He totalled four-over 144 and missed the cut by three shots. 

Meanwhile, in Dublin, Jyoti Randhawa birdied two of the four holes remaining in his second round, which spilled over to Saturday morning, but it was still not enough to keep him for the weekend rounds of the Nissan Irish Open. 

Randhawa finished with a total of seven-over after rounds of 79 and 72 and was tied 101st. The cut came at four-over in this rain-hit tournament.

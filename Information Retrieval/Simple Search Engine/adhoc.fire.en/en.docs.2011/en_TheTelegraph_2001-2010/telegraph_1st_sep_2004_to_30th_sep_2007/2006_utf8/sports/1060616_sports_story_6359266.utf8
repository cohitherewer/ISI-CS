 Focus on battle between Nistelrooy, Drogba 

 - We havent come here to go out so quickly, says Ivory Coast coach Henri Michel

Stuttgart: Ruud van Nistelrooy versus Didier Drogba is a battle between two of the games best power forwards. Fridays World Cup match-up could also decide whether The Netherlands go into the second round and Ivory Coast head home. 

If we lose this game, were going home, and we havent come here to Germany to be out of the tournament so quickly, Ivory Coast coach Henri Michel said. We need to solve some problems we have in defence. 

That means containing Van Nistelrooy. The Manchester United forward had a bad opening game but the Dutch relied instead on the skills of Arjen Robben to get past Serbia-Montenegro 1-0. 

Chelseas Drogba scored his countrys only goal in the match against Argentina, a 1-2 loss that leaves them facing early elimination in the tournament. 

Drogba continued to ice his right knee Wednesday but Ivory Coast were expected to have a fully fit squad available, a daunting prospect for Dutch coach Marco van Basten who admires the teams depth. 

A lot of them play in the big leagues in Europe, so they are strong, he said. They have a lot of experience. 

Most eyes though will be on the 28-year-old Drogba, who earlier this year won English Premier League title and reached the final of the African Cup. 

Van Basten has enough confidence in his defence to withstand the Drogba mystique. He can score goals. But we have to do it with the team and we wont change everything for one player, he said. 

Also, the coach knows Ivory Coast have a knack of often changing tactical systems and players, making adaptation plans futile. 

They change a lot of players and they changed also system, and I think what we can do is just focus on ourselves, give attention to our players and also to our type of play. What they do, we cannot tell, he said. 

One thing Van Basten apparently is not considering is sacrificing Robben and Arsenals Robin van Persie on the offensive wings to contain the African lateral backs. 

No, the other nine players have to help Robben and Van Persie as a team to resolve a problem like that, Van Basten said. 

Van Basten is not expected to change his line-up from Serbia-Montenegro, and keep midfielder Rafael van der Vaart on the bench even though he has fully recovered from an ankle injury. His last competitive game was two months ago. 

Ivory Coast will pay special attention to Van Nistelrooy and Robben, in essence bolstering their defence. 

We are very strong in the attack, but we cant forget that you have to defend, too, midfielder Didier Zokora said. 

Michel has been pointing out that all players have defensive responsibilities. 

The way we play is nice. We try to play beautiful soccer, but we need just a little more efficiency, he said. 

Even though Van Nistelrooy did not score against Serbia-Montenegro, the Ivory Coast side realises he represents a danger. 

We know his qualities. He can always score if the ball comes near his feet, so we just have to make sure he doesnt get the ball, Michel said. 

Double marking Van Nistelrooy, however, could open space on the wings for Robben and Van Persie. 

Ivory Coast are likely to start without playmaker Bonaventure Kalou. The experienced striker featured in the opening match but was criticised by the media for his performance and is expected to give way to the fit-again Aruna Dindane.

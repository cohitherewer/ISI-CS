 Inzamam hits out at detractors

 - Pakistan captain looking forward to Champions Trophy 

 Pakistan suffered in Tests against England owing to absence of main bowlers, says Inzamam 

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Friday hit back at critics finding fault with his leadership during the England tour and said there was a lobby which lost no opportunity to show him in poor light. 

Inzamam said the criticism heaped on him and his team was not a new phenomenon and he had got used to it since taking over the captaincy in 2003. 

It is nothing new for me and even the cricket-loving public is aware of the real intentions behind this criticism, he said. 

For the last two years, his detractors have been trying to run him down, but the teams performance silenced them, the captain claimed. 

We cant stop anyone from criticising us. Our job is to play good cricket and try to win every game we play and keep our fans happy. We had a bad England tour because we were without our main bowlers, Inzamam said. 

Since The Oval Test forfeiture last month, Inzamam has come under fire from certain quarters for his leadership and role in the controversy. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board has also discussed Inzamams future as captain and the possible steps to be taken if he is slapped a ban following ICCs hearing on September 27, 28. 

Former captain Rashid Latif was among those who advised him to skip Tests and concentrate on ODIs to prolong his career and reduce the pressures of captaincy. 

But the burly right-hander said he was more concerned about the opinion of the general public. 

For me, what is important is the way the people reacted when we returned home. At the airport, many of them came to me and wished me warmly and said they were sorry that we had faced so much bad luck in England, the captain claimed. 

I was not expecting this sort of reaction. I thought people would be very upset and angry, he added. 

Inzamam is looking forward to the Champions Trophy and hoping for a change of luck. Hopefully in the Champions Trophy in India, we will get back to form and put everything behind us. I am keen to play and do well in the tournament which we have never won, he added.

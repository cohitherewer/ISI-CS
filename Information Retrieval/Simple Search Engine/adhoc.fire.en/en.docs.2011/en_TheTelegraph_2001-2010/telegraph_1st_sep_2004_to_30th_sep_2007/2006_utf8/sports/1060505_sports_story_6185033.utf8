Dhaka: Bangladesh want to stage the opening game of the 2011 World Cup. 

It has been decided that Bangladesh will host six matches in the tournament, while India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka will stage 22, 14 and nine games, respectively. 

We will ask for the opening game in Dhaka. We hope our plea will be honoured by the International Cricket Council, said Ali Asghar, president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

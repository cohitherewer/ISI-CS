 Poker face key to Advanis success

 - I know expectations are going to increase 

 Pankaj Advani 

New Delhi: Having reached the pinnacle of his career at just 20, Indias new Khel Ratna Pankaj Advani on Wednesday said he will start a new journey towards excellence from here. 

Advani said he will take cue from previous winners of this highest sporting honour like Sachin Tendulkar who scaled greater heights after bagging the award in 1997-1998. 

Before me Sachin Tendulkar and Abhinav Bindra have got this award at a very young age and they reached new heights after that. I will also build on this achievement knowing well that expectations are going to increase, Advani said. 

The Bangalore player has established his supremacy in cue sports by bagging the world snooker and billiards titles, but he not prepared to rest on his laurels and is already planning to undergo a training stint in England. 

There is going to be pressure on me but right now I am enjoying this moment and will cherish it for a long time. It is a personal high and definitely a big boost. 

This is the trophy every sportsperson wants on his board, said the player who led the Indian team to final of the World Snooker Team Championship in the US on Saturday. 

Only the second cueist to receive the honour after Geet Sethi, Advani said he would also look to improve his technique. 

Asked about the secret behind his success so far, the cueist said he manages to keep a poker face during matches. 

I keep my face completely expressionless so my opponent is never able to understand what I am up to next and that gives me an edge, he said. 

Advani believes the basic inspiration for youth would come only when more number of domestic tournaments are introduced. 

I may be looked up to but we need more number of domestic tournaments as we have enough international tournaments in a year, he said. 

Advani said he was inspired most by the fighting spirit of cycling legend Lance Armstrong. 

I think he is a perfect role model for any sportsperson. The way he conquered his disease and went on to win the most prestigious cycling event seven times is a perfect example of how one should surge ahead in life, Advani said. (PTI)

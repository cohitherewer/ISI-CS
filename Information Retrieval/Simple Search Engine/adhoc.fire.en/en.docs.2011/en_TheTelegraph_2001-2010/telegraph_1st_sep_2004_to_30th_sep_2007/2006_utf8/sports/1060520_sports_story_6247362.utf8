The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting need draw to survive 

Panaji: Mohammedan Sporting have tasted it once and when the chips are down now, they pray the relegation-threat doesnt become a reality again. 

Come Saturday, the Nehru Stadium in Margao will be witness to which of the two ? Mohammedan Sporting and hosts Salgaocar ? will suffer the relegation from the National Football League (NFL)s premier tier. 

The Calcutta team go into this final-round match with slight advantage. 

With 14 points from 16 matches, Subhas Bhowmicks side needs just a draw to survive. 

The onus is, therefore, on the hosts who, with 12 points, need an outright win to stay in the top tier. 

Its also going to be an acid test for Bhowmick in his coaching career. 

Ever since he took over the teams charge, Mohammedan Sporting have conceded 11 goals in four matches ? something the former India forward and the NFL-winning coach (with East Bengal) didnt experience in life.

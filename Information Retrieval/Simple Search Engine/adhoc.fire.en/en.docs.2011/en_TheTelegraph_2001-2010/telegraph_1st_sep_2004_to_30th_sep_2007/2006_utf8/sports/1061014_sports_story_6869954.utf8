 Nafees guides Bangla to 101-run victory

 - Opener hits 123 n.o. 

 Shahriar Nafees during his century in Jaipur on Friday 

Jaipur: Opener Shahriar Nafees stroked 123 not out, the highest one-day score by a Bangladesh batsman, to guide his team to a 101-run victory over Zimbabwe in an inconsequential Champions Trophy qualifier on Friday. 

Both teams were out of reckoning for a slot in the main round after defeats to holders West Indies and Sri Lanka. 

Nafees, 20, anchored his team to 231 for six from 50 overs before the spinners took over, skittling Zimbabwe for 130 in 44.4 overs for a consolation win. Left-arm spinner Saqibul Hasan took three for 18. 

The score was officially amended from 323 after a short run. 

Left-hander Nafees hit 17 fours and a six, becoming the first Bangladesh player to score two one-day hundreds, after his 118 not out during the 3-2 series defeat in Zimbabwe in August. 

Nafees, who revealed his talent in April by stroking 138 in the home Test series against Australia, kept his focus after pacemen Ed Rainsford and Anthony Ireland reduced the innings to 26 for two in the 10th over. 

He added 84 for the third wicket with Saqibul (37) and another 80 for the fourth with skipper Habibul Bashar (30). 

Opener Brendan Taylor top-scored with 52 for Zimbabwe. 

The 20-year-old gave Bangladesh, out of contention for the tournament proper, a chance to salvage their pride by hitting 123 not out that was filled with shots all around the park. 

The Dhaka-born player, who hit the headlines with a maiden Test century against Australia at Fatullah earlier this year, made the most of a reprieve by Elton Chigumbura when on a duck in the fourth over of the innings. 

 Saqibul Hasan with 36 and skipper 

 Habibul Bashar (30) were the other notable contributors.

Cape Town: Debutant bowler Stuart Clark enabled Australia to complete a seven-wicket win on the third day of the first Test against South Africa at Newlands Saturday. 

Clark took four for 34 as South Africa were bowled out for 197 in their second innings. Australian opening batsmen Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden put on 71, but fast bowler Makhaya Ntini took three wickets in five balls before Australia reached the victory target of 95. 

Australias win in the first Test of a three-match series follows a 2-0 series win at home earlier in the season. 

Australia won five out of six Tests between the two countries in the 2001-02 season, with South Africa winning a dead rubber game in Durban at the end of the home series. 

Bowling accurately at fast-medium pace, Clark finished with match figures of nine for 89. He took five for 55 in the first innings. 

Clark struck two key blows this morning by dismissing overnight batsmen Jacques Kallis and Ashwell Prince after South Africa resumed at a shaky 70 for three. 

He came back in mid-afternoon to take two more wickets and stand on the brink of becoming only the third Australian, after Clarrie Grimmett in 1924-25 and Bob Massie in 1972, to take ten wickets in a match on his debut. 

Leg-spinner Shane Warne took the final wicket, however, when last man Ntini holed out to long-off. 

For South Africa, it was a disappointing batting display, albeit on a pitch which helped seam bowlers throughout. 

Jacques Rudolph made South Africas top score of the match when he made 41 before being bowled by Warne.

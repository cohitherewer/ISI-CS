The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Souravs fingers will be crossed

 - Selector Bhupinder arrives 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Till late on Wednesday, there was no indication that former captain Sourav Ganguly would make the XI at the Gaddafi, venue of the first Test from Friday. However, a well-placed source told The Telegraph that nothing ought to be ruled out. 

Everything points to a 2-2 attack and specialist openers doing the job... Also, it appears Yuvraj Singh will be retained... Having said that, the Test is still some hours away and nothing should be ruled out, he pointed out. 

Obviously, coach Greg Chappells opinion is going to have a big bearing. Captain Rahul Dravid had spoken about Souravs inclusion in the XI, when the squad was picked almost three weeks ago, but since then he hasnt even remotely suggested that his predecessor would make a comeback here. 

But, then... 

Its not confirmed, but it seems Gautam Gambhir is going to hold on to the second openers position. Wasim Jaffer, therefore, will have to wait. 

Meanwhile, national selector Bhupinder Singh (Sr) arrived late in the evening. In a first, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has decided that one of the five selectors (by rotation) is going to be sent for engaments overseas and will sit on the tour selection committee. 

Initially, chief selector (and known Sourav-baiter) Kiran More was expected to come.

 Sandipan, Surya win

 Surya Sekhar won in 39 moves 

Gibraltar: In hunt for his second GM-norm, International Master S. Kidambi added to the woes of top seed GM Alexei Shirov of Spain by holding the highly regarded veteran to a draw in the eighth round of gibtele.com Masters Chess tournament at Caleta Hotel here. 

With only two more rounds to go in this 6000 pounds sterling winners prize event, Shirov was left tottering on just 5 points for his second low in recent times after the former world championship finalist had finished last in a recent rapid event. 

On the top board, former world junior champion Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria continued to make merry by defeating second seed Vladimir Akopian of Armenia to remain in sole lead on seven points. 

Georgiev is followed by Sergey Volkov of Russia on 6.5 points while a pack of four players are right behind on 6 points. 

The Indian duo of Sandipan Chanda and Surya Sekhar Ganguly are in the next group of 5.5 points after both scored hard-earned victories over Watu Kobese of South Africa and Anton Aaberg of Sweden, respectively. 

Surya Sekhar won an absorbing game against Aaberg in a Volga Gambit declined. The national champion appeared to be in some troubles in the early middle game and had to sacrifice a rook for a knight. 

However soon after, Aaberg went haywire with his planning and allowed the Calcuttan a dangerous initiative. Pocketing a handful of pawns on his cruise, Surya Sekhar won in 39 moves. (PTI)

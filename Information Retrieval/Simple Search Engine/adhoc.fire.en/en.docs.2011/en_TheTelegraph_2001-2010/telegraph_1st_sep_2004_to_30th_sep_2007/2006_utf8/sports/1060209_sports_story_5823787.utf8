 Paes: Cold weather our biggest threat

 - DAVIS CUP TIE vs KOREA 

 Paes and his boys have had only one proper training session in three days 

New Delhi: An away tie versus Korea has brought with it the familiar woes of cold weather to the Indian Davis Cup team. 

Leander Paes and his men are in danger of going into the Asia-Oceania group 1 first-round tie ? from Friday to Sunday at Changwon near Busan ? without any worthwhile practice as their training has been hampered by heavy snowfall. 

It has snowed everyday since we came here. The venue and the practice area have all been under three feet of snow, playing captain Paes said from his hotel room in Korea. 

As things stand, the weather could pose the most major threat to our team than the opponents themselves. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj are the other nominated players, with 19-year old Karan Rastogi being in the squad as reserve member. 

Bhupathi left Bangalore late Tuesday night, but the rest of the team including coach Nandan Bal had been in Changwon, 50 km from Busan, has been in Korea since Sunday. In three days, though, the Indians have had only one real practice session, a long one Tuesday till late in the evening. 

The players have generally spent time working on their fitness. We have used the hotel gym to do some weight training and stretching. The corridors have served as the sprint tracks, Paes said. 

The captain said the players were fit and fine, but coming as they were from tropical countries, they are finding the conditions in Korea a bit difficult. 

At the Australian Open, the on-court temperatures were 51 degrees Celcius, and here it is minus three, Paes explained. 

India have lost all three ties held in Korea. Overall, the Koreans hold a 4-3 edge. 

The Korean team, captained by Yong-Dae Jeon, includes the seasoned Hyung-Taik Lee, Woong-Sun Jun, Hee-Seok Chung and Oh-Hee Kwon. 

The tie will be played on an outdoor hardcourt, making things that much difficult for the visitors. 

Paes opted to not play singles in the World Group play-off tie against Sweden last September. Amritraj and Bopanna had done duty, with the latter really impressing in his match against former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson. 

Asked if he would name himself during Thursdays draw to take on Korean No. 1 Lee, the captain played his cards close to his chest. 

I dont want to reveal our plans in advance to the enemy camp. You will know that when the draw is made. As always, we aim to put our best foot forward, he said. 

During the Sweden tie, Paes had still not completely recovered from a shoulder injury. (PTI)

 Serbians, Ivorians in futile battle

Wuerzburg: Serbia and Montenegro will bid farewell to the World Cup and each other on Wednesday when they face what is likely to be Ivory Coasts B team. 

The Group C basement battle in Munich will be the last at these finals for two teams already eliminated by The Netherlands and Argentina. 

For the eastern Europeans, Montenegros vote for independence in May means the soccer remains of Yugoslavia will be reduced to Serbia alone for their next game in August. 

Serbia and Montenegro, who conceded only one goal in qualifying, are seeking to restore their pride after a 0-6 drubbing by Argentina. 

It is very difficult to find a motive for this match. 

We have tried to focus on it but our morale has been killed off, said captain Savo Milosevic, who may announce his retirement from internationals after the game. 

Coach Ilija Petkovic is keen to give the fans something to cheer in his last match in charge, but has a string of injuries and suspensions. 

Full backs Ivica Dragutinovic and Dusan Basta, midfielder Albert Nadj and forward Danijel Ljuboja are nursing knocks and bruises. Striker Mateja Kezman and winger Ognjen Koroman are suspended. 

Ivory Coast appear keen to bow out with a victory. 

We will do everything to end this tournament with a win, said Henri Michel ahead of his final game as coach. 

But I will give a chance to players who havent featured yet. That way they can all say they went to the World Cup and played. 

The Ivorians have no injury worries although captain Didier Drogba is suspended.

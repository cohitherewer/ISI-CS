The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Blaming it on Cooperage a lame excuse

 - Mahindras Abhishek, James ruled out of season 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Nothing seems to be going right for Mahindra United. After losing seven points in three back to back matches on the home ground, it has now earned the wrath of Mumbai District Football Association (MDFA) for ctiticising the poor quality of the Cooperage turf. 

While Mahindra players and the team management remained busy licking their wounds throughout Friday after the shocking defeat against lowly Air India, MDFA chairman Kehar Singh fumed at the Mahindra officials for blaming the ground conditions. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Mumbai, Kenar Singh said Mahindras arguments about the conditions of the Cooperage pitch was nothing more than a lame excuse. He even saw a deeper conspiracy into the whole affair and said it was only an attempt to deny Mumbai the National Football League matches. 

They never blamed the ground when they won four matches on the trot. Suddenly it has become bad after dropping points in the last three matches, said Kehar Singh, who was accused at the start of the season for renting out the Cooperage for marriage ceremonies. Tell me then how Air India won the match yesterday if the ground condition was so poor? 

While an upbeat Kehar Singh claimed that AIFF, too, is involved in this malign Mumbai campaign and many stand to gain financially if the matches are shifted out of the city, Mahindra officials maintained that the treacherous turf was certainly one of the reasons behind East Bengal catching up with them so easily. 

No doubt, the ground was one of the factors for the defeat, said Mahindra assistant manager Arshad after the evening practice session. 

But what to say? Its only our home ground and we will have to play on it. Mahindra are not thinking of lodging an official protest as it may fall on deaf eras. 

Injuries to key players has also played havoc with the Mumbai outfit. While Abhishek Yadav and James are out for the season with hand and knee operations, frontline players like Manju, Venkatesh, Ajayan, Deepak Mondal and Sushant Mathew are far from fully fit to dish out their best. 

Coach Derrick Pereiras only consolation is that both Mohun Bagan and East Bengal will have to face the music when they play Dempo at Cooperage in the next couple of weeks. The Calcutta teams will face problems here. In fact any good team with skilful players will find it difficult to operate smoothly on this ground.

 London: Disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson has claimed that he had been framed when he tested positive for anabolic steroids after winning the 100m gold medal during 1988 Olympic Games. Johnson added that he was still considered the fastest man in the world when he ran 9.79 seconds to win the title ? it was subsequently erased from record books once he was found to have cheated.

 However, Johnson told the BBC that he hadn?t taken the drugs.

 ?People can put things in your food and drinks to sabotage you, like they did to me in Seoul in 1988,? said Johnson, who was banned for life when he again tested positive in March 1993 having already served a ban for his positive test in seoul.

 ?I?m not a cheat ? I do what I am supposed to do to win.

 ?I?m not saying go ahead and take it (drugs), but it?s not a crime. It?s just in some sports it?s banned, some it isn?t.

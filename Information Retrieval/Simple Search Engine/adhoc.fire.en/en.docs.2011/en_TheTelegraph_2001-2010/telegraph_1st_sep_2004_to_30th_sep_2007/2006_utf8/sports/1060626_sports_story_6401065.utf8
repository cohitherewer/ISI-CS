 Robinho doubtful vs Ghana

Bergisch Gladbach: Brazil striker Robinho is doubtful for Tuesdays World Cup second round match with Ghana, team doctor Jose Luis Runco said on Sunday. 

Robinho ended training early on Saturday after suffering a twinge in his right thigh. 

The player, whose speed and trickery gave Brazil a new dimension in a 4-1 win over Japan in their final group game on Thursday, was seen to clutch his thigh during shooting practice. 

Robinho missed practice on Sunday. Instead he stayed in the team hotel undergoing physiotherapy. 

Runco said Robinho had shown an improvement, but would undergo an MRI scan on Monday to determine the extent of the injury. 

Well wait for the results of this before making any decision, said Runco. 

If its not a sprain, then hes free to train and play as soon as he doesnt feel any more pain. Runco added it was very unlikely that Robinhos injury would be serious enough to force him out the tournament.

 Vengsarkar: We need players with experience

 - BCCI in favour of pitches like SA 

New Delhi: Dilip Vengsarkar on Thursday stressed on the need to have experienced players in the squad. 

If you look at the performances in South Africa, our batting has failed. We need experienced players like VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly, the chairman said after the selection committee meeting. 

Vengsarkar said the selectors wanted to send the message that nobody should take their place in the team for granted through their decision to strip Virender Sehwag of the vice-captaincy. 

On the inclusion of Laxman for the ODI series after he had commented that he was not fit for one-day cricket, Vengsarkar said: He will be available for only one ODI. There is no question about Laxmans ability. It is only fitness but that can always be improved. 

Vengsarkar also backed Irfan Pathan to fire again soon. Pathan bowled well the other day. He also batted well. You cannot just drop him like that, it will spoil his confidence. He is the player for the future, we are sure he will perform soon. 

The five selectors met BCCI president Sharad Pawar before the meeting. Pawar assured the selectors that two suggestions would soon be implemented that pitches in India be of the kind of South Africa and the semi-finals and final of Ranji Trophy be played at neutral venues.

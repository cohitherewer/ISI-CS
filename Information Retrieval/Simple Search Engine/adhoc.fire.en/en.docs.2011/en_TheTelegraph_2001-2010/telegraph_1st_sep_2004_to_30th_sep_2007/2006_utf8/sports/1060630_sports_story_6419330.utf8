 Kaiser: This could easily be the final

Berlin: It would have been a classic World Cup final. Germany versus Argentina in Berlins 72,000-seat Olympic Stadium, a showdown between two soccer powers with five titles between them. Instead Fridays match is only a quarter final match. 

In terms of potential, this could easily be a final, said Franz Beckenbauer, chief of the organising committee, who twice faced Argentina in the World Cup as German coach. Its a shame, but both of us are going to consider it a final. We are looking forward to this game, its a very special occasion, Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann said Thursday. 

There is no trace of overconfidence in our team. We will go in with total aggression and total passion and well see how Argentina reacts, he said. 

Ive always said we have to fight to be the champions. I thought that with the junior teams and also as a fan, we mustnt think of anything else, said the Germans opposite, Jose Pekerman. 

Germany and Argentina were responsible for one of the worst World Cup finals ever played when they last met at this level in 1990 in Rome. 

Klinsmann, however, has words of caution as well. If we lose against Argentina Friday, then the debate will start all over: Wouldnt it be better to play more cautious? First secure the defence? Wait for a counterattack? Klinsmann told a weekly. That is why it is so important that we advance to the final. 

Even Fifa president Sepp Blatter has been moved to wonder, Who can stop these Germans? Argentina might have the answer. 

Some German fans hanging around the Argentina training ground have put up a banner that reads: Adios Argentina. We saw it, striker Javier Saviola said. But I wont tell you what we said about it. 

Pekerman declined to announce his starting line-up on Thursday. Two injured players ? defender Nicolas Burdisso and midfielder Luis Gonzalez ? might be available. If they are, it would allow Pekerman to start the same line-up that demolished Serbia-Montenegro. 

Saviola is likely to start alongside fellow striker Hernan Crespo, with the midfield again anchored by Juan Roman Riquelme. 

Everybody will have to do the dirty work on the field so that we keep or regain possession of the ball, Saviola said. 

He also declined to enter into the referee debate, with many Argentina fans convinced that Lubos Michel of Slovakia will favour hosts Germany. We dont talk much about the referees. If we play well andhave a good day, it wont depend on the referees. Of course, they make mistakes like we do on the field. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack, along with Philipp Lahm and Klose missed the two 2-2 draws in 2005. 

We are not afarid of Argentina. Our performances show we should not be afraid of anyone, said Ballack on Thursday. We believe we can win the title. 

We were the outsiders in those two meetings last year. You cant say that now, Ballack said. Were far hungrier and we want to play three more games at this World Cup. The chances are 60-40 in our favour. 

Interestingly, Argentina ended their practice on Thursday shooting penalties but Pekerman said they aim to win their quarter final without having to go to a shootout. Were not thinking of getting to the penalties, he said. 

Pekerman, speaking on the 20th anniversary of Argentinas world title in Mexico, said his team would try to honour the memory of the side captained by Maradona. 

Meanwhile, Klinsmann said that his players are praying for Juventus team manager and former Italy defender Gianluca Pessotto. Weve been talking about him at the team hotel. Were thinking about him, praying for him and hoping he gets well. Its terrible for the Italian team to have one of their best friends in this situation. 

PROBABLE TEAMS 

Germany: 1-Jens Lehmann; 3-Arne Friedrich, 21-Christoph Metzelder, 17-Per Mertesacker, 16-Philipp Lahm; 19-Bernd Schneider, 8-Torsten Frings, 13-Michael Ballack, 7-Bastian Schweinsteiger; 20-Lukas Podolski, 11-Miroslav Klose. 

 Argentina: 1-Roberto Abbondanzieri; 17-Leandro 

 Cufre, 2-Roberto Ayala, 6-Gabriel Heinze, 

 3-Juan Pablo Sorin; 22-Luis Gonzalez, 8-Javier 

 Mascherano, 10-Juan Roman Riquelme, 18-Maxi 

 Rodriguez; 7-Javier Saviola, 9-Hernan Crespo. 

 TACTICAL SNEAK-PEEK

 Germany will use a direct, aggressive 

 style in a 4-4-2 formation inspired by playmaker Michael 

 Ballack in Fridays quarter final against Argentina, 

 whose own 4-4-2 revolves around playmaker Juan Roman Riquelme 

 dictating the pace of their short-passing game. 

 GERMANY

 Defence: Germany are bolstered 

 by two big centre-halves in Mertesacker and Metzelder. They 

 have both improved after a nervous start during the 4-2 

 win over Costa Rica and dealt well with Sweden in their 

 second round match but they have yet to face forwards of 

 the calibre of Argentinas. Lahm loves to get forward 

 on overlapping runs on the left with Schweinsteiger and 

 scored a cracking goal against Costa Rica. Friedrich on 

 the right is slower and the obvious weak point in defence.

 Midfield: Ballack gives Germany 

 great presence in central midfield. A great header of the 

 ball, he is also a danger at set pieces. The bruising Torsten 

 Frings backs him up in midfield. Schweinsteiger always looks 

 to cut in from the left or pass to Lahm rather than beat 

 his man, while Schneider on the right has more defensive 

 work to do to back up Friedrich.

 Attack: Striker Klose has been 

 superb, scoring four goals and providing a natural target 

 for long balls from the back. His 21-year-old strike partner 

 Podolski is a great natural finisher and is oozing confidence 

 after scoring three times in the last two games. Neuville 

 likes to run at defenders and will be an option as a late 

 substitute. 

 ARGENTINA

 Defence: Argentina have a classic 

 back four in which Roberto Ayala acts as the last man with 

 Gabriel Heinze generally picking up the oppositions 

 main striker, though both will be called on to make quick 

 interventions to counter Germanys fast twin spearhead 

 of Klose and Podolski. On the left flank, captain Sorin 

 defends well and also adds punch to the attack, often making 

 diagonal runs into scoring positions. The weakest defensive 

 link is at right back where the speedy Cufre is likely to 

 stand in for the injured Burdisso. 

 Midfield: Argentina appeared to have found the right midfield 

 balance with Luis Gonzalez on the right wing and Maxi Rodriguez 

 on the left against Serbia amp; Montenegro. Mascherano 

 is the tireless ball winner who plays better alone rather 

 than sharing the burden with a teammate, like Cambiasso. 

 Attack: Only this Argentina team 

 could enjoy the luxury of keeping players like Tevez and 

 Messi on the bench, keeping them in reserve for potential 

 match-saving roles. The coachs striking vote has 

 gone to Crespo, who has scored once in each of his three 

 appearances, and Saviola, playing with the freshness and 

 skill of his River Plate days. Saviola roams across the 

 front of the attack while Crespo hovers in the box, although 

 Mexicos tactics of keeping the ball in Argentinas 

 half in their second round match meant Crespo often had 

 to drop deep and he may find a similar problem with Germany.

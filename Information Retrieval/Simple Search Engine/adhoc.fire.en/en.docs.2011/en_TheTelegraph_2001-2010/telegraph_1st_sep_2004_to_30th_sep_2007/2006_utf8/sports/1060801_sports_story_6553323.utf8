 Rathore fails to qualify

Zagreb: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathores fears came true when his damaged gun cost him a place in final of the double trap event at the World Shooting Championships here on Monday. 

Rathore, whose Perazzi gun was lost in transit and found last month, shot 139 to finish eighth after the qualifying rounds. Agonisingly, his tally was one point behind the six finalists score. 

On a normal day it is a decent score. But I could not cope well in the third round, Rathore said. It was difficult to catch my form again as well after the change in the gun, he said. 

Gagan Narang and Sanjeev Rajput finished at the bottom while Artem Khadjibekov of Russia won the title in the mens rifle 3 position event at the World Shooting Championships here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Moment scrapes home 

 STAR RACER 

 Reuben on Capture 

 The Moment (top) and Afzal on Karans Choice after 

 winning their respective events the Aloritz Cup and 

 the Treasure Land Cup at the RCTC on Wednesday. 

 Calcutta: Trainer Robin 

 Corners hot-favourite, Capture The Moment, belied 

 his odds as he struggled to beat a less-fancied Star Phoenix 

 (R.Yadav up) by half-a-length in the 1,400m Aloritz Cup 

 on Wednesday. Jockey Mark Reuben, however, judged the impending 

 danger. He kept the 3-10 favourite under pressure soon after 

 assuming the charge of running from Star Phoenix, 800m from 

 the post.

 In contrast, Karans Choice (Afzal up) simply coasted home after shrugging off joint-favourite Immaculates challenge in the last 300m.

 Mysore impasse 

 SRIMAX

 Mysore: The start of the 

 regular season here has been postponed and the first two 

 fixtures, beginning from Thursday have been cancelled.

 First it was the Karnataka Race Horse Owners Association who were at loggerheads with the Mysore Race Club for publishing the prospectus without consulting them. The issue was, however, resolved last Sunday. 

 Then followed the syces problem. Syces have refused to work on more than one horse, though they had agreed to do so before the hike in their salaries. With both trainers association and the syces union not relenting, the impasse may continue.

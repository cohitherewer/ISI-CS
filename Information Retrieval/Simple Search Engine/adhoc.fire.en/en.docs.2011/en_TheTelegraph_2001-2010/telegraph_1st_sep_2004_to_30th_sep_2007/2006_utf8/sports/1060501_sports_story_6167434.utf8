Cape Town: Hashim Amla hit a maiden Test century as South Africa made it almost certain of earning a draw on the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Newlands on Sunday. 

Amla made 149 as the Proteas reached 427 for five at close in reply to New Zealands first innings total of 593 for eight declared. 

South Africa, who lead the three-match series 1-0, lost only three wickets Sunday to make a draw the only likely result with one day left to play on a batsman-friendly pitch which has yielded 1020 runs for the loss of only 13 wickets in four days. 

Amla, 23, was playing in his fourth Test. He reached his century shortly before lunch when he drove left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori through the covers for his 12th boundary.

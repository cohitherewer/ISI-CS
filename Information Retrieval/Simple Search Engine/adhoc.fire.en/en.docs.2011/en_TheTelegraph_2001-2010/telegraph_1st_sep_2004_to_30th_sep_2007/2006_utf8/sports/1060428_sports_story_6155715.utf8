 Barcelona: Third seed Guillermo 

 Coria double-faulted his way out of the Barcelona Open on 

 Thursday when he was hammered 6-2, 6-0 by Spaniard Nicolas 

 Almagro in the third round.

 On a day when 2002 French Open 

 champion Albert Costa bowed out of professional tennis, 

 the Argentine looked a shadow of the man who reached the 

 French Open final in 2004. He produced 14 double faults 

 won just six points in the second set.

 Coria said he was working hard 

 to fix his problems.

 I have had problems on my 

 serve ever since my operation (August, 2004) and I know 

 it is not back to where it was, the world No. 9 said. 

 It is all about confidence. But I am working with 

 (coach) Jose (Higueras) and I hope that in three or four 

 weeks I will be playing at a high level again.

 The good thing is that if 

 I am still winning matches when I am giving away so many 

 gifts, then that shows my basic game is good.

 In the quarter finals, the 57th-ranked 

 Almagro will face 10th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero after the 

 Spaniard beat his compatriot Albert Costa 6-1, 5-7, 7-5.

 The two friends embraced at the 

 net after the match and the 30-year-old Costa received a 

 standing ovation. Costa won 12 career titles and helped 

 Spain to win the Davis Cup for the first time in their history 

 in 2000.

 Fifth seed David Ferrer was another 

 Spaniard to exit when he was upended by Swiss Stanislas 

 Wawrinka 2-6, 6-2, 6-1. Wawrinka will next play big-serving 

 Croatian Ivo Karlovic, who ended the run of Russian qualifier 

 Evgeny Korolev 6-7, 7-6, 7-6.

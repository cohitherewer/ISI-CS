 Roddick in quarters

Los Angeles: Top seed Andy Roddick overcame spirited resistance from fellow American Scott Oudesma before advancing to the Los Angeles Open quarter finals with a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory on Thursday. 

However, Roddick suffered an abdominal muscle strain late in the match and is considering withdrawing from the event with the US Open looming large next month. 

I hit the one passing shot and strained something in my side, a subdued Roddick said. 

 It doesnt feel too good right now. If its like this tomorrow, I dont think theres a lot of hope. 

Once it happened, it was always there. When I served, and pretty much on every shot, there was pretty intense pain. 

I didnt play my best stuff but I got through tonight, added the world No. 10, who unleashed 21 aces before setting up a last-eight meeting with Dmitry Tursunov. 

The former World No.1 is now being coached by Jimmy Connors. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Two more lifters test positive 

Doha: Drug-use and an on-pitch battle stained the 10th day of the Asian Games on Sunday as two athletes were disqualified for doping and two fighting hockey teams had to be separated by security guards. 

Uzbekistan weightlifters Alexander Urinov and Elmira Ramileva failed dope tests, Urinov for a cannabis metabolite and Ramileva for a banned steroid, and were disqualified. 

They follow Myanmar lifter Than Kyi Kyi in a shameful exit from the Games the only three positive results from 750 tests so far. 

The hockey teams from Oman and Bangladesh also had little to be proud of after brawling at the end of their pool game at the Al-Rayyan Sports Club. 

Bangladesh scored twice in the final four minutes to win 5-3 and the game spiralled out of control in the final stages with players squaring up to each other. 

At the final whistle, violence broke out and security guards charged on to the pitch from all corners to pull players apart. A Bangladeshi player had to be carried off on a stretcher. (Reuters)

 Henin-Hardennes confession

 - Shouldnt have started Aussie Open final 

Dubai: Justine Henin-Hardenne believes she should never have attempted to start the Australian Open final against Amelie Mauresmo because she was too ill. 

Now I can think about what happened in Melbourne? I have the feeling I should never have walked on the court because it could have been dangerous for me, the Belgian told newsmen. 

Its not good to play with your health because you just have one life and you have many tennis tournaments. 

The Belgians decision to stop playing when 1-6, 0-2 down in last months final attracted widespread criticism. 

In Dubai to play for the first time since that Melbourne walkout, Henin-Hardenne said on Monday she had been racked with pain during the night before the match. Medication for a shoulder injury had made her feel very, very bad. 

Im upset with myself I didnt call anyone that night before the match. My stomach was in so much pain and I have regrets I should have made the call (to a doctor). 

I cannot stop people thinking something about me, but I know the way I am and Im totally fine with the fact that I left the court. 

Some people understand and some dont. Thats life. You cant make everyone happy and cant make everyone like you. 

Henin-Hardenne, the fourth seed here, she plans to draw on the positives from her Australian Open experience. 

I didnt play for four months and I came back and won in Sydney and beat Lindsay Davenport and Maria Sharapova and was again in a Grand Slam final. Thats what I have to keep. 

So its not that I had the opportunity to win another Grand Slam and didnt, because Im sure Ill have other chances.

 St Johns: Electing to bat, India were 

 144 for four at tea on Day I of the first Test against the 

 West Indies here on Friday.

 Jaffer fell in the third over of the day when he went back 

 after edging a lifting delivery from Fidel Edwards to wicketkeeper 

 Denesh Ramdin in the third over of the day.

 India were 220 for seven at the scheduled close. Anil Kumble 

 was batting on 15 while Sreesanth was on 18. Corey Collymore 

 scalped three and Dwayne Bravo claimed a couple. Rahul Dravid 

 was dismissed for 49.

 Sehwag began with two flicked fours off Ian Bradshaw and 

 generally hit at least boundary off the two new ball bowlers 

 before a tentative push cost him his wicket.

 The dashing opener cracked seven boundaries for his 36 off 

 37 balls and seemed to have had the measure of the wicket 

 when he fended at a harmless delivery from Corey Collymore.

 Collymore came into the operations in the 11th over and 

 struck off his very first ball when Sehwags edge carried 

 to Brian Lara at second slip.

 Laxman was in serene touch and was precise in his judgement 

 off Collymore who bowled an impeccable line.

 Laxman thumped both Edwards and Bradshaw for square driven 

 fours and had a straight drive that screamed to the fence 

 in no time.

 In between, there was a streaky jab at a delivery from Collymore 

 which found the fence, but showed the pitch to be of awkward 

 variety.

 Growing confident with each passing minute though proved 

 to be Laxmans failing as he aimed a loose drive at 

 a Dwayne Bravo delivery and edged a catch behind the stumps.

 He faced 74 balls and hit five fours in his knock of 29 

 runs. 

 India, three down for 72 runs in the 25th over, made a brief 

 recovery through a 54-run association between Dravid and 

 Yuvraj Singh.

 The captain was intent on batting safely and didnt 

 take any undue risk while the Punjab left-hander was relatively 

 bold in going for his favourite cover drives.

 Yuvraj, who struck three boundaries, was reprieved by Shivnarine 

 Chanderpaul off Edwards on 17.

 That, however, did not prove to be a costly miss as the 

 25-year old was deceived by the Chinaman of Dave Mohammed, 

 who had bowled him in the last match of one-day series.

 Earlier, India left out two experienced campaigners in Harbhajan 

 Singh and Irfan Pathan while capping young Punjab fast bowler 

 Vikram Rajvir Singh.

 Indeed, Indias three-pronged pace attack of Sreesanth, 

 Munaf Patel and VRV Singh have only four Tests between them.

 Anil Kumble is the lone seasoned campaigner.

 West Indies on their part opted for experience in including 

 both Bradshaw and Collymore and dispensing with the promise 

 of Jerome Taylor.

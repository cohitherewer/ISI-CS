Like the Lone Ranger, Sania rides tall in the barren landscape of Indian tennis. While her rankings have slipped from 34 to 68 since the New Year, the media hype continues unabated. The nose ring, the sparkling smile and the metallic ring in her voice hawking brands on the TV have not lost their appeal. 

But tennis-wise Sania is back in the foothills. The brief glimpse of the summit in 2005 is now shrouded in the mists of her well-known weaknesses. 

A year, which so far has 20 victories and 24 losses is by no means apocalyptical. The figures show that she had nine losses to women ranked over 50, including 1 loss to a wild card entry ranked 1144! 

The best of her victories were Martina Hingis, ranked 8, and Flavia Pennetta, ranked 16, of Italy. Since the Calcutta tournament in late September, where she reached the semi-finals, Sania has achieved a measure of much-needed consistency. With two quarter final appearances at Seoul where she beat Hingis and at Tashkent, Sanias ranking seems to levelling off in the 50s-60s. 

However, she will always be a danger to higher-ranked players specially the top-20 or so who are wary of her destructive ground shots. 

The higher-ranking players give Sania much-needed rhythm which she thrives on. Also with nothing to lose, Sania plays with fearless abandon. The absence of pressure liberates the real depth of a players talent. Other things being equal, confidence or faith in ones ability is the invisible line between the top players and the others. 

While many may be critical of Sanias performance, considering that the media had already elevated her to a place in the top 10-20, one feels that she has made good progress since last year. 

There is no missile-launcher to the top-ten. Experience of match play under varying conditions against players with different styles are the stepping stones to higher rankings provided one is able to learn from ones losses. Time is running out for Sania. She badly needs a guru with experience of play or coaching at the highest levels, to guide her along with continued physical training, else it will be too late. 

Sanias last two coaches were Asif Ismail, a great talent who failed to reach his potential and now Narendranath, a good high-ranking former Indian player. 

With their very limited international experience, one would classify them more as hitting partners than guiding lights or gurus. 

It may be a good idea to look for a former Russian-East European top notcher to help her. One cannot visualise the Indian making the top 10-20 in the next two-three years without the help of a top-level coach and physical trainer. 

Sanias pairing by the AITA with Leander Paes for the mixed doubles in the forthcoming Asian Games triggered a violent outburst from Mahesh Bhupathi. 

I will never play for India again Bhupathi thundered. The humiliation of being rated below Paes as a mixed doubles player and being overlooked as Sanias mentor and promoter was too much for the normally mild-mannered Bhupathi. 

His refusal to play for the country, for the old timers like me, is mind-boggling. Especially since the mens doubles with Paes as partner is one gold medal India were sure of winning. 

I am sure Bhupathi will reconsider his decision and not let the country down. The sparring between Paes and Bhupathi continues. 

The ripples of friendly cosmetic statements of I respect him etc. are wiped away by a torrent of ego. Like the opposite banks of a river, Paes and Bhupathi are unlikely to get together again as they meander towards the delta of their careers. For us humans, leave alone multiple Grand Slam winners, it is almost impossible to be free of ego.

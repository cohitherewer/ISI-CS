 - Second straight loss for East 

 Sourav Ganguly 

Gwalior: Propelled by a couple of brilliant knocks by Jacob Martin and Dheeraj Jadhav, West Zone snatched a convincing four-wicket victory over East Zone in the Deodhar Trophy limited over cricket match here on Tuesday. This was Easts second loss on the trot, after they lost to South Zone in Indore on Saturday. 

Electing to bat first, the East Zone put up a target of 224 with former Indian cricket captain Sourav Ganguly scoring 81 from 146 balls. But some sound batting performances by opener Dheeraj Jadhav (55) and No. 4 batsman Jacob Martin (70) enabled Westachieve the score in 47.3 overs. 

The day started well for the East Zone with Sourav regaining form and sending seven balls to the fence and hitting a fabulous six. 

While East Zone opener Subhamoy Das was sent back by Munaf Patel with Parthiv Patel lapping up his catch and Rohan Gavaskar, Deep Dasgupta and Rajiv Kumar Raja returned to the pavilion with little success, Manoj Tewari put up an impressive 55 (67) runs hitting four boundaries. 

At the end of 50 overs, East Zone managed 223for five, thanks to Laxmi Ratan Shuklas fabulous knock of 42 (21), with six fours and a six. 

Though West Zone opener Parthiv and first down batsman Ramesh Powar departed without reaching double figures, Jadhav and Martin ticked the scoreboard along for a 96-run third-wicket stand. 

Explosive batting by Yusuf Pathan (22 off 22 balls) and B. Thakkar (21 off 22 balls) led West Zone to victory with Thakkar and Ravindra Jadeja, both remaining unbeaten. 

While Aviskar Salvi took a maximum of two wickets for the West Zone, medium-pacer Randeb Bose and left-arm spinner Shahbaz Nadeem took two wickets apiece for the losers. 

Meanwhile, North Zone defeated Central Zone by 14 runs in another Deodhar Trophy match in Indore Tuesday. In reply to North Zones 233 for five, Central Zone finished at 219 in 45.1 overs.

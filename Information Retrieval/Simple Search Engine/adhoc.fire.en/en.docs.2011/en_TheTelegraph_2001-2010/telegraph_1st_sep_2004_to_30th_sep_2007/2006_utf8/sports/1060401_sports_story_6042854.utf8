The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has agreed a new two-year deal with Manchester United and plans a coaching career at Old Trafford.

 Solskjaer, who joined United 10 years ago, has been plagued by injuries in recent seasons. 

 The 33-year-old returned to first-team action only in December after an 18-month lay-off and then suffered a fractured cheekbone in a reserve game this month. His new deal takes him through to 2008. 

 Athens: Brazilian playmaker Rivaldo has signed a one-year contract extension with Olympiakos Piraeus after helping them win the Greek league and cup double last season.

 The 33-year-old World Cup winner, who joined Olympiakos in 2004, had a contract that was due to expire on June 12. Greek media reports said the new deal is worth 1.9 million euros.

 ?Olympiakos have extended the contract of Rivaldo by one more year, taking into account the excellent service given by the greatest player ever to grace Greek football,? the club said. 

 London: The new Wembley stadium will not host any soccer matches this year, the English FA confirmed on Friday after weeks of speculation.

 Constructor Multiplex was originally supposed to complete the stadium in time for the FA Cup final in May, but has been hit by a series of setbacks.

 ?Further to recent meetings with Multiplex and Wembley National Stadium Limited (WNSL), it is clear that the construction of Wembley Stadium is significantly behind schedule,? the FA said in a statement.

 Tokyo: A Japanese burglar who thought he was lucky to find an unlocked door on Friday, was shocked to be arrested by 20 massive sumo wrestlers, staying at the building. Konoshin Kawabata was rummaging inside a room in Osaka in the early hours when he was suddenly confronted by wrestler Dewanosato, who stands 180 cm and weighs 131 kg.

 Dewanosato said, ?Without thinkingI caught the guy and bear-hugged him.? 

 Shanghai: Mike Tyson may have been world heavyweight champion, but it does not look like he will ever be a citizen of Luodian.

 The Shanghai suburb?s city fathers decided to withdraw an offer of honorary citizenship to the boxer, deciding that his controversial reputation made him a poor choice for the award.

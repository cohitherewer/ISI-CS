The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CA offers 3 venues in September

 - Possibility of tri-series Down Under before Champions Trophy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Will Rahul Dravid be in Australia this September? 

 Calcutta: Cricket Australia 

 (CA) has offered three venues for an off-shore 

 ODI face-off featuring India and the West Indies, in September. 

 Eventually, we could even see a tri-series, with world champions 

 Australia being the third team. 

An exciting build-up to the October 15-November 5 Champions Trophy, therefore, is on the cards. That tournament is being hosted by India. 

 Speaking on Tuesday, former Board 

 of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit 

 Singh Bindra told The Telegraph: Weve 

 been looking at venues for a bilateral (three-match) series 

 against the West Indies? With Australia sending a proposal, 

 we could instead have a tri-series there? 

He added: As theres little time, the CA offer will be discussed by the marketing committee which meets in New Delhi on Thursday? 

Bindra has a position of pre-eminence in the present dispensation and is handling off-shore negotiations. 

The marketing men have to come into the picture as the ODIs are largely meant to add to the BCCIs millions and help the cash-strapped West Indies Cricket Board. 

According to Bindra, CA is willing to make available the Gabba (Brisbane), the Marrara Cricket Ground (Darwin) and the WACA Ground (Perth). 

Were looking at the period between September 12-23? Thats the window? Any movement forward, though, is only going to be after the marketing committee has met, he remarked. 

The BCCI had been looking to stage the ODIs in North America ? in Toronto, at least, if not in the US as well ? but the grounds arent ready. 

The West Indies own reservations apart, the move to schedule them in Singapore or Kuala Lumpur fell through as the floodlights wont be installed by September. 

Apparently, Sri Lanka Cricket is willing to act as host, but the Indians will, in any case, be there for almost three weeks next month. 

 Moreover, in principle, the fund-raisers (be it India 

 versus West Indies or India against Pakistan) are going 

 to be held outside the subcontinent.

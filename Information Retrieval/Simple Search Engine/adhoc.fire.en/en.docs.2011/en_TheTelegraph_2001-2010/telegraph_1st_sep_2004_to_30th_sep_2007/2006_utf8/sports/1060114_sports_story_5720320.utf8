The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Close watch on Patrick

 - NFL

 Bagan look for win, Md. Sporting a point 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mohun Bagans foreign trio Ebrahim, Cofi and Eduardo Coelho warm up with A. Firoze (left to right) on Friday 

Calcutta: They had given East Bengal a run for their money in the National Football League (NFL) opener on Tuesday. And now, when they lock horns with Mohun Bagan on Saturday, Mohammedan Sporting will definitely be looking to earn a point in the match versus the green-and-maroon brigade here. Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, will surely target three points. 

Mohun Bagan coach Jahar Das considers Patrick Okonji as the black-and-whites trump card. Patrick may not be a player of (Jose Ramirez) Barretos standard, but he is capable of changing the complexion of the game anytime, Das said after practice on Friday. 

However, he made it clear that they will not go all out and will wait for the right time before launching counter attacks, though he admits to winning being his top priority. We will go for victory and will not play defensive football like what we played against Mahindra United, Das said. 

Mohun Bagan is likely to field a 3-5-1-1 formation, with new recruit Ibrahim as the lone forward while Benin striker Coffi Edem Agbessi is to play from bit deep. They are also likely to stick to the XI that started against the Mumbai outfit in the previous match. 

On the contrary, Mohammedan Sporting are plagued by injuries. David, Henry and goalie Arindam Ghosh are already ruled out. 

It has been learnt that David will be out of action for 21 days, while Ghosh will also miss a few outings after he was injured in the match against East Bengal on Tuesday.

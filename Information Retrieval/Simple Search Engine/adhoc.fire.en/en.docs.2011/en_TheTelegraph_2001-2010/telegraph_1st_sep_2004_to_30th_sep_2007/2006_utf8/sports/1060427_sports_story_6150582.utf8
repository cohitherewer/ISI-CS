Barcelona: Rafael Nadal started his defence of the Barcelona Open in style on Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-2 win over fellow-Spaniard Feliciano Lopez. 

Nikolay Davydenkos title hopes were blown away as the second seed lost 6-7, 7-5, 6-4 to Croat Ivo Karlovic. 

Former French Open champion Juan Carlos Ferrero outslugged fellow Spaniard Alberto Martin 6-4, 7-6 to reach the last 16.

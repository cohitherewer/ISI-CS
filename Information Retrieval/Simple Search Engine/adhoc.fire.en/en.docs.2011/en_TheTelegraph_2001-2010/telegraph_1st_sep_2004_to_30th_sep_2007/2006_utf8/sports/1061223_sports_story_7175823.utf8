 Razzaq ruled out of Test series

- Pakistan in South Africa 

 Razzaq has muscle injury 

Karachi: Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq has been ruled out of the upcoming Test series against South Africa due to a calf muscle injury in his right leg. 

Razzaq has a grade 2 tear in his right calf muscle and has been advised complete rest for four weeks, PCB director Saleem Altaf said on Friday. 

He hurt himself during the final ODI against the West Indies this month and was complaining of pain. He underwent an MRI which showed up the tear, he said. 

Razzaq, who has played 46 Tests and 224 ODIs, has been an integral part of the Pakistan team owing to his senority and experience. 

Altaf said Razzaq had been advised an initial four-week rest period but he might require more time to gain full fitness. 

Pakistans first Test in Johannesurg from January 11 followed by Tests in Port Elizabeth from January 19 and in Cape Town from Janaury 26. 

National selector Iqbal Qasim said the selectors would now probably look for a replacement in a two-day conditioning camp being held in Lahore on December 28 and 29.

 Chandhok leads points table

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Karun Chandhok had a perfect weekend. 

According to information received here on Sunday, Chandhok won both the races at the Zhuhai circuit in China in the Asia Formula V6 series, and now leads the points table ahead of favourites Ananda Mikola (Indonesia) and Hammad al Fardan of Bahrain. 

The Chennai-based Chandhok set a benchmark time of 1.31.1 seconds to grab pole position on Saturday, just three 10ths of a second ahead of Mikola. 

In the seventh round, Chandhok and Mikola broke away from the pack on the first turn. But the latter kept the pressure on the Indian on each lap, with the lead changing hands. 

Chandhok withstood the pressure to take the chequered flag. Mikola (+0.531s) finished second and Hans Lin of Taiwan (+8.8s), third. 

Buoyed by the podium finish, Chandok kept up the momentum in the second race which went without any glitches. 

He finished a clear 2.201 seconds ahead of Matt Halliday (New Zealand). Fardan was way behind.

 - ORDER OF MERIT 

 Gaurav Ghei 

Kuala Lumpur: Indias Gaurav Ghei spiralled up the ranks to be among the top-10 in the UBS Order of Merit when he ended an 11-year-wait to win the Mercuries Taiwan Masters earlier this month. 

Ghei was placed 10th while Jeev Milkha Singh continued to lead the Order of Merit list with $470,108 and Shiv Kapur was placed fifth with a purse of $261,857.59. But, Jeev, the Volvo China Open winner, who finished joint 14th in Sanya, China is being closed on in by Thai youngster Prom Meesawat. The 22-year-old Thai is ranked second and has earned a total of $336,891. 

However, another rookie Yasin Alim, who also continued his rise on the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit after the conclusion of the Volkswagen Masters-China, said he had grown in confidence after he finished tied third with Jyoti Randhawa at the Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters last month. 

With his tied sixth place outing at the Taiwan Open two weeks ago and a tied fourth place at the Volkswagen Masters-China, the 24-year-old has already secured his card for next season as he is now ranked 29th on the UBS Order. 

His efforts over the weekend in Sanya earned him $13,545 which increased his total earnings for the season to $105,576. 

I think Johor (Pulai Springs Malaysian Masters) was huge for me. I finished third there with Jyoti Randhawa and that gave me a lot of confidence. It made me believe that I could compete with the best as it was a strong field as well, Yasin said. 

Thailands Prayad Marksaeng, who finished in joint fourth spot alongside Yasin on Sunday, improved to ninth place on the Order of Merit with a total of $225,957. The Thai was one spot above Ghei. The 17-year-old Thai Chinarat Phadungsil, who produced his fifth top-10 finish on Sunday, moved up to 24th spot on the UBS Order of Merit. (PTI)

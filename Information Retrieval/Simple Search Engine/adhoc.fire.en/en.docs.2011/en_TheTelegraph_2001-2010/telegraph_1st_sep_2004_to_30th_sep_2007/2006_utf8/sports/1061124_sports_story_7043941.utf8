The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fourth innings may be crucial

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta stood tall among the ruins with his gritty 78 in Mohali on Thursday. It was almost like last season when Deep, then the captain, proved to be Bengals saviour time and again. 

At one point Bengal were reduced to 18 for five when Deep along with Laxmi Ratan Shukla (30) steadied the ship. We would have opted for fielding, had we won the toss, Deep told The Telegraph. 

According to the former India stumper, they are not losing hope. The wicket may get better with time, but there a few cracks that might open up and prove to be crucial in the fourth innings, Deep said. 

Asked whether Bengal will miss a second spinner in the second innings, Deep pointed that Rohan Gavaskar and Avishek Jhunjhunwala are capable of playing that role, if needed. 

The highest run-getter for Bengal in the last edition of the Ranji Trophy, seems to have started from where he left off last season. 

I just batted the way I am supposed to in that situation and Laxmi did a good job to put a check on the fall of wickets, Deep remarked. 

The onus is now on seamers Ranadeb Bose, Eklakh Ahmed and Ashok Dinda to make use of the first hour on of Day II. We have to bowl perfectly in the first hour to be in the match as an outcome is certainty, Deep said.

 BCCI seeks players inputs

Ahmedabad: The BCCI is working out a road map for making the game more professional and has asked senior players to give their inputs on various issues, president Sharad Pawar said Sunday. 

Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag and Anil Kumble were among the players who were part of the discussions Saturday and gave their opinions on various issues, he told reporters here. 

We talked about improving the playing conditions, facilities for players and selection methods. We will meet the players again when they are a bit free in a week and then a road map would be prepared, Pawar said. 

He said that the Board had chalked out a pension scheme of Rs 25,000 for each of the old and retired cricketers. (PTI)

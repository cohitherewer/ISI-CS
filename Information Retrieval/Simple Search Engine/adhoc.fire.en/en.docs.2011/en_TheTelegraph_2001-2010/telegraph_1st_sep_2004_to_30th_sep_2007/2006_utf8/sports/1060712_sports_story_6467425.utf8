 Fifa to probe Zidane incident

Zurich: Fifa will open a disciplinary investigation into Zinedine Zidanes conduct in the World Cup final, when he was sent off for head-butting Italys Marco Materazzi. 

World soccers governing body said on Tuesday the incident had been spotted by the fourth official without using a monitor, who then alerted referee Horacio Elizondo through their communications system. 

Fifa will open a disciplinary investigation into Zidanes conduct to enable it to clarify the circumstances surrounding the incident as exactly as possible, Fifa said in a statement. 

Zidane and Materazzi exchanged words after Italy broke up a French attack in extra-time of Sundays final in Berlin. Seconds later, Zidane lowered his head and rammed Materazzi in the chest, knocking him to the ground. 

Investigations are regular practice whenever a red card is shown in an international match to determine how the player, and any others who may be involved, should be punished, Fifa said. 

Referring to Zidane being voted player of the tournament, Fifa said it was impossible to tell how many of the votes had been cast before, during or after the match. 

More than 700 journalists voted in the poll, but ballot boxes remained open until after the end of the final. 

The fourth official of Sundays final, Luis Medina Cantalejo, statement that he had witnessed the incident has surely added a new twist to the whole issue. 

Elizondo didnt show Zidane the red-card until about two minutes after his violent act on Materazzi, leading France coach Raymon Domenech to suggest TV replays were used because the referee and his two assistants hadnt seen the incident. 

Cantalejo, who informed Elizondo of the head-butt, denied the claim. 

I saw it happen live, I didnt invent anything, Cantalejo told a Spanish radio station on Tuesday. The ball was elsewhere and that was where the referee was looking, while the linesman was getting back into position. 

Meanwhile, the President of Algeria, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, said on Tuesday that he had sent a letter of support to Zidane. The President described Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants, as a World Cup demi-god and the best footballer in the world.

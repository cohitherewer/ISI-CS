 Title for Scott

 - Kapur up to 6th on money list 

Singapore: Shiv Kapur played a great nine holes and was looking to challenge for a better placing than his overnight fifth when rain and thunder ended the days proceedings at the $ 3m Barclays Singapore Open at the drenched Serapong Golf Club. 

The final results were declared on the basis of the standings at the end of the third round, and since Adam Scott and Ernie Els were tied at eight-under after 54 holes, they went into a three-hole play-off, which was won by Scott with a birdie on the 18th. 

Asian Tour chief executive, Louis Martin, while announcing the three-hole play-off for title and deciding on 54 holes for rest, said: We are always keen on 72-hole events, but with no guarantee of weather improving on Monday, we decided to go for 54 hole results. 

Kapurs cheque of $123,000 helped him move up to sixth on the money list, up from his previous 15th place. Jeev stays on the top at $ 470,108 with the help of $ 28,350. Randhawa, with $ 63,600, also moved up from 38th to 22nd. 

Kapur finished fifth at three-under, Randhawa tied eighth at even par, Arjun Singh and S S P Chowrasia tied 19th at three-over and Jeev and Gaurav Ghei tied 25th at four-over for 54 holes.

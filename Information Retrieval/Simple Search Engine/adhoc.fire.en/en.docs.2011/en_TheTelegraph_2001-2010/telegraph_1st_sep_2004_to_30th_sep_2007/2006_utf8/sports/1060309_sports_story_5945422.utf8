 FIH changes rule 

New Delhi: A new rule change effected by hockeys world governing body can make it more challenging for India to qualify for the mens and womens competitions at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

The FIH has ruled that there will be nine direct qualifiers for each of the mens and womens competition (hosts China plus eight from the continental federation championships). 

The five continental champions will qualify directly for Beijing, but the remaining automatic places will be allocated to the continents based on the world rankings after the World Cups later this year. 

After each continent has been allocated its quota of automatic berths, their respective championships will decide which nations fill those positions.

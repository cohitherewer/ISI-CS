Karachi: India slumped to their second biggest defeat in terms of runs here on Wednesday after their famed batting line-up produced another spineless display and allowed Pakistan to clinch the three-Test series 1-0. 

Faced with a victory margin of 607 runs, India were annihilated for 265 in just about two sessions with a full days play left, despite a valiant 122 by Yuvraj Singh. 

Yuvraj stood out amid ruins with his second Test century but that was never enough to prevent a 341-run loss, just short of 342, Indias biggest margin of defeat that came against Australia in Nagpur during the 2004 series. 

While their Pakistani counterparts plundered runs almost at will in the second innings, Indian batsmen cut a sorry figure to be dismissed in just 58.4 overs. 

This marked Pakistans first series victory over their neighbours since 1987, making amends for their 1-2 loss during Indias tour in 2004. Pakistan had drawn their return tour to India 1-1 in 2005. 

 Mohammed Asif, who bagged three for 48, did the star turn for Pakistan, castling the likes of Virender Sehwag (4), V.V.S. Laxman (21) and Sachin Tendulkar (26), while Abdul Razzaq snapped up four wickets for 88 runs. Wicketkeeper batsman Kamran Akmal, who bailed out Pakistan from 39 for six in the first innings with a mesmerising 113 under trying conditions, was adjudged the Man of the Match. 

But for Yuvraj Singhs attacking 122 in which he hit 19 fours and a six, and his 103-run fifth-wicket partnership with Sourav Ganguly (37), there was nothing to write about Indias performance. 

The main damage was not caused by Pakistans pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar, who got only one wicket in Dravid, but by rookie seamer Asif, who used the seam to good effect to leave India tottering at 74 for four before tea. 

 Razzaq, who had dismissed Laxman and Tendulkar in the first innings, then joined the party with the wickets of Ganguly, out first ball after tea, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18) and Irfan Pathan (4), as India slid from 177 for four to 216 for seven in 13 overs. 

Ganguly played across to a straight ball from Razzaq and was leg before while both Dhoni and Pathan were caught in the slip cordon, the former trying to drive and the latter fending a lifter. 

Amidst the mayhem, Yuvraj completed his second century in his 13th Test in 126 balls with 17 fours.

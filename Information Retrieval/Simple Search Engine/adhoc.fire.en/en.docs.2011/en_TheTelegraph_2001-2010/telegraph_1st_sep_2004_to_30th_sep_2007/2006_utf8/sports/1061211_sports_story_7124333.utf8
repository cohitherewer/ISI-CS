 Pratyusha closer to title

BIPIN SHENOY

Solapur: B. Pratyusha of Andhra Pradesh inched closer to the girls title as she extended her lead to 1.5 points after the ninth round of the XXth National U-9 Chess Championships for boys and girls at the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium here Sunday. 

Pratyusha won both her games beating Srija Seshadri and top seed M Mahalaxmi. Pratyusha now needs a draw to seal the title. 

In the boys category Vaibhav Suri of Delhi emerged as the surprise leader. 

It was a bad day for the Bengal players, as Sayan Majumder lost both his games and Shoumi Mukharji could win only one of her games. Both Sayan and Shoumi fell back on 6 points. 

The only solace for Bengal was Diptayan Ghoshs draw and a win.

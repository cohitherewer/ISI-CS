 Swiss need draw to progress; Korea a win

Bad Bertrich: Switzerland, with a future full of promise, clash on Friday with South Korea, a team inspired by a glorious recent past. 

Switzerland, with one of the youngest squads at the World Cup, view this tournament as a chance to gain experience for Euro 2008 while the Koreans are looking to build on their shock appearance in the semi-finals four years ago. 

The group G table favours the Swiss, who only need a draw to progress to the second round. 

Korea, however, must win to make sure of progressing. 

There is no reason why we cant finish top of the group, said midfielder Park Ji-sung. If we play like we did in 2002, who knows what can happen? 

The exploits of four years ago are still the yardstick for Korea, even though several players from that campaign are no longer involved. 

Switzerland, on the other hand, feel their best days are ahead of them. 

In 2008, they will enjoy home advantage when they co-host the European championship with Austria. 

All our efforts with this young team have been aimed at peaking at the European championship and I originally thought this World Cup would be too early for them, said coach Koebi Kuhn. 

But I couldnt have predicted how quickly players like Philippe Senderos and Tranquillo Barnetta would establish themselves at top European clubs, so it looks like were now ahead of schedule. 

Kuhn has faced calls from the media to hand Hakan Yakin a starting place after he did well on his return from injury during the second half against Togo. 

Korea coach Dick Advocaat is also being urged to recall striker Ahn Jung-hwan after twice bringing him on as a substitute. 

Fridays game looks like being a landmark occasion for Kuhn and Korea goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae. 

Kuhn coaches Switzerland for the 50th time while Lee is preparing to win his 100th cap. 

I can do without having a cake, Kuhn joked. All I want from the players is three points and qualification for the next round. 

Lee said: I will do everything I can to keep a clean sheet. My 100th game will mean nothing unless we win.

Switzerland: 1-Pascal Zuberbuehler; 3-Ludovic Magnin, 4-Philippe Senderos, 20-Patrick Mueller, 23-Philipp Degen; 8-Raphael Wicky, 6-Johann Vogel, 7-Ricardo Cabanas, 16-Tranquillo Barnetta; 9-Alex Frei, 11-Marco Streller.

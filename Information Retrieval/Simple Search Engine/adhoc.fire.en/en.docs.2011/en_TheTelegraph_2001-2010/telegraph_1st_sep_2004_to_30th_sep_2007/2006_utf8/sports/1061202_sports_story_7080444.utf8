 BCCI: No plan for bowling coach

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The BCCI has no immediate plans to appoint a bowling coach following a request from chairman of selection committee Dilip Vengsarkar. 

Weve got no plans for a bowling coach right now, secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. 

Vengsarkar reiterated the need for a bowling coach at the Eden on Friday saying, it is a must. 

The former India captain felt assistant coach Ian Frazer wasnt good enough to guide the bowlers. 

On Sourav Gangulys World Cup chances, Vengsarkar said: It will all depend on how he performs in South Africa The World Cup is too far away. I cannot talk about the future, but the criteria will be current form and fitness for any player. 

Vengsarkar said Virender Sehwags removal from vice-captaincy had nothing to do with his attitude. He supported the proposal to introduce performance-based incentives for players and said he had been advocating this for a long time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its up to the selectors now

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Sourav Ganguly is leaving it to the gods. After stroking his way to an unbeaten century in very trying circumstances, a circumspect but relieved former India captain, said: God permitting, I am looking forward to playing in the World Cup. 

Sourav said he was happy to be finally among runs but refrained from commenting on selection matters after his eventful knock. It is up to the selectors, now... I am happy to have made runs on a pitch which was turning, Sourav remarked. 

Asked whether Dilip Vengsarkars presence at the helm of the selection committee would make any difference to his recall to the national team, Sourav said: Having himself played a lot of international cricket and being a former captain, I am sure he will pick the best possible XI. 

Sourav did reveal that that he was under pressure but that cannot be an excuse for his not being among the runs. The pressure was there chasing such a big score. But some pressure is always going to be there. We have to get used to it. Guwahati is a lucky ground for me and Team India, he said. 

This is Souravs second Duleep Trophy century here. The first came in 1990 against West Zone. 

It was not only Souravwho was happy with his knock. National selector Venkatapathi Raju said that a good beginning has been made and he needs to perform consistently. It is expected of a player of such experience and calibre, Raju said. 

 His colleague and East Zone selector Ranjib Biswal observed: It is a good comeback innings. Being a selector from the East, I expected such innings and feel happy for him. Performance will still remain the yardstick for selection.

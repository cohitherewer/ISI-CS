The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sevilla rout Barcelona 3-0

 Super Cup

 Madrid: Sevilla proved 

 that Barcelona were far from invincible with their brilliant 

 3-0 demolition of the Spanish and European champions in 

 the Super Cup in Monaco on Friday.

 In a performance reminiscent of 

 their 4-0 destruction of Middlesbrough in the Uefa Cup final 

 in May, Sevilla put their opponents to the sword with an 

 expert demonstration of aggressive precision football.

 Despite having the likes of Ronaldinho, 

 Samuel Eto, Deco and Lionel Messi in their ranks, 

 Barcelona gave a listless display, and their defence which 

 was without new signings Gianluca Zambrotta and Lilian Thuram 

 was ruthlessly exposed by Sevillas livewire forward 

 line.

 They said that Barcelona 

 were the best team in the world, but we beat them, 

 said Sevilla president Jose Maria del Nido. Some people 

 doubted we could win but in the end David defeated Goliath.

 Sevilla coach Juande Ramos said 

 the key to his sides victory had been the determination 

 and enthusiasm of his players.

 Sevillas new signing Christian 

 Poulsen, ably assisted by Brazil international Renato, did 

 an expert job in stifling the Barcelona midfield, while 

 strikers Frederic Kanoute, Luis Fabiano and Adriano Correira 

 tormented the Catalans defence throughout.

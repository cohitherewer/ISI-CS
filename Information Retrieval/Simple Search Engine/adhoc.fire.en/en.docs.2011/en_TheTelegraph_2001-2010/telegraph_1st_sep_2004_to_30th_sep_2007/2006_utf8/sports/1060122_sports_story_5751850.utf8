The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. ride Pradhan strike

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Nitin Pradhan stole the limelight on Saturday. The striker scored in the 81st minute to help Mohammedan Sporting beat 10-man Salgaocar in an NFL match at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

The black-and-whites were in an attacking mode from the word go. Satyajit Bose missed the target in the sixth minute from a Mohammed Mukhtar pass. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach Mohammed Habibs decision to bring in Pradhan in place of Bijen Singh in the 72nd minute bore fruit within nine minutes. Jiten Rais firm right-footer from inside the box rebounded off the upright only to find Pradhan, who made no mistake in slotting the ball home. 

Salgaocars strategy of restricting Patrick from scoring backfired as Micky Fernandes was given the marching orders for committing a serious foul on captain Patrick. 

 TEAMS 

Mohammedan Sporting: Gopal Das, Palash Karmakar, Madhusudhan Majumdar, David Mkandwire, Madhab Das, Mir Farooque Hyder, Satyajit Bose (Jiten Rai 63), Suman Dutta (Raman Vijayan 82), Md Mukhtar, Bijen Singh (Nitin Pradhan 72), Patrick Okonji.

Referee: P.K. Bose (MP). 

Dempo lose again 

PTI adds from Margao: Air India scored through Zaheer Abbas and Bashiru Abbas to shock defending champion Dempo 2-0. Dempo, who suffered their second successive defeat, have two points from four matches, while Air India have three points from as many games.

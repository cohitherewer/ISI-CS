Mumbai: England skittled out CCI Presidents XI for a paltry 75 in the second innings to romp to a crushing 238-run victory in the three-day warm up game at the Brabourne Stadium here on Monday. 

Marcus Trescothick got among the runs with a fluent 88 and Ian Blackwell reinforced his batting prowess with a belligerent 59 before the bowlers came good to bundle out the hosts in just 26.2 overs in the fourth innings on the final day. 

Trescothick, having stayed back at the hotel on the first day due to viral infection, hit form with an innings that lasted around three hours during when he faced 128 balls and hit 11 fours and two sixes. 

Blackwell struck six fours and four sixes during his 73-ball knock that should pose selection problems for Fletcher. 

England have to decide on the spinners slot and Blackwell should be the favourite because of he can fill the No. 8 position as batsman-cum-bowler. 

But Monty Panesar, whose batting is not on par with Blackwell, also impressed with his bowling. Both the left-arm spinners picked two wickets in CCIs second essay. 

Coach Duncan Fletcher said the decision on who to play as spinner, or even two spinners, would be decided after the next three-day game against a Board Presidents XI in Vadodara from February 23. 

 For the home team, Hiken Shah 

 was the top-scorer with 21 and only two other batsmen touched 

 double figures.(PTI)

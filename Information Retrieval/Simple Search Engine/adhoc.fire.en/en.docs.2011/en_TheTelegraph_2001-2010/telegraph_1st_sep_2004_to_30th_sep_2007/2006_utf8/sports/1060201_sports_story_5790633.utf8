 ZC sacks team manager, selector

Harare: Zimbabwes national cricket team manager Mohammed Babu Meman was sacked by Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) authorities here on Tuesday after serving for 15 years. 

He has worked for ZC and previously for the Zimbabwe Cricket Union for a total of more than 20 years and had also served as a selector. 

Also sacked on Tuesday was former international spin bowler and long time selector Richie Kaschula, who has been employed for several years by the ZC as one of its three national selectors. Ethan Dube and Macsood Ebrahim, were volunteers, but have stood down. 

Both Meman and Kaschula have threatened to move court. Their termination letters gave three months notice plus an enclosed cheque, in Kaschulas case the amount was 145 million Zimababwe dollars (about $1,000). 

Meanwhile, several days of talks between the ZC technical and player welfare sub-committee chairman Crispin Tsvarai and the players association representative, Clive Field, appeared to have ended in stalemate. 

The sides have been meeting to hammer out a solution to the chaos which has seen Zimbabwe suspended from Test matches for the second time in two years. (AFP)

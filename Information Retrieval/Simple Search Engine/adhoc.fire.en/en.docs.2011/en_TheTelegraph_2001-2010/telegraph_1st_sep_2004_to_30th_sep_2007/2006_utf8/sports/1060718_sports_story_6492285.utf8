 Chopra finishes tied 10th, Atwal joint 61st

Sylvis: Daniel Chopra managed only a one-under 71 on the final day of the John Deere Classic on Sunday to end up at tied 10th place. 

The Swede of Indian origin, who has been close to the top for at least the first two days in the last two events he has played, has not been able to convert early scores into a win. 

After being joint leader on first day, he slipped to fourth on the third day and finally ended tenth. 

Arjun Atwal birdied the 10th and 13th and bogeyed the third, 11th and 12th as he carded one-over and finished tied 61st. 

Australian John Senden captured his first PGA Tour event title after 139 starts with a one-shot win. The victory qualifies him to play at the British Open at Hoylake starting on Thursday.

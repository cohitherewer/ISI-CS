 Chuck out chuckers, says Martin Crowe 

 - Im sick with hypocrisy of last 10 yrs 

London: New Zealand great Martin Crowe launched a thinly-disguised attack on Muttiah Muralidharan here on Tuesday as he called on officials to make sure chuckers were chucked out of cricket. 

Changes to international regulations brought about by investigations into controversial Sri Lanka off-spinner Muralidharans action mean bowlers are now allowed a maximum of 15 degrees of straightening in delivery. 

But there is no room for manoeuvre under the laws of cricket and former Test batsman Crowe insisted that was right. 

I have zero tolerance of chucking, said Crowe while giving the 2006 Cowdrey Lecture at Lords here. Im sick to death with the hypocrisy of the last 10 years. 

I dont care about talk of 15 degrees here or 10 degrees there... If with the naked eye a bowler is clearly chucking ? even by one degree ? he should be chucked out... To straighten your arm from any bent position is a massive advantage over other bowlers who bowl properly. 

Then, in a reference to Murali, he added: Having been pinned in the head by chuckers over 15 years, having been dubiously bowled first ball in a Test by a certain Sri Lanka bowler, having tried to bowl a decent ball myself with a straight arm, Ive had more than enough of this aspect of the game. 

Only Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne has taken more than 34-year-old Muralidharans 635 Test wickets in the history of the game. 

But the Sri Lankans career has been dogged by rows over the legitimacy of his unique action, which saw him no-balled for throwing during tours of Australia in 1995-96 and 1998-99. 

Two years ago his doosra delivery (a ball which turns away from the right-handed batsman, the opposite of a standard off-spinner) was reported by Match Referee Chris Broad, the former England opener. 

That led to a general inquiry into throwing by the ICC which in turn sparked a relaxation of the rules governing Test, one-day and first-class matches after it was found that many bowlers were bending their arms in delivery. 

Crowe also called for the World Cup to be shortened and one-day games to feature two innings per side. (AFP)

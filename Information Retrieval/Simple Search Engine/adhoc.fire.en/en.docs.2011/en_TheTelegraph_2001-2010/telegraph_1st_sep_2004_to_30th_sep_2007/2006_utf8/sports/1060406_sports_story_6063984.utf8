Mumbai: India Davis Cup captain Leander Paes on Wednesday said his team was all set to take on Pakistan in the Asia-Oceania Group I first round play-off tie beginning on Friday. 

We have worked very hard over the last 12 days in two sessions. Some players are better prepared to play in the morning but some others prefer the afternoon. 

I have ensured that they are prepared for both challenges by having two practice sessions daily, at 10 am and then in the afternoon, Paes said on Wednesday, ahead of the tie being held at the CCI. 

Paes, who refused to divulge who would be playing the singles on the opening day, did not want to draw any comparisons between the two teams. As far as our boys are concerned we have done our homework. We are prepared to take on the challenge, he replied. 

The draw is scheduled to be held on Thursday morning. 

Bhupathi, who suffered a hamstring strain in the run-up to the tie, said he was much better now and had a one and a half session on Wednesday. 

Pakistan feel home advantage and the humid weather gave India a clear edge, but vowed they would give the home team a good fight. 

India have a 60-40 advantage. The home crowd support and the weather conditions should work to Indias advantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Hot on the heels of IFA Shield, the city is gearing up for another big tournament. The 28th edition of the Federation Cup was unveiled here on Saturday with 16 teams vying for top honours. The tournament, sponsored by Peerless, has a total prize money of Rs 26 lakh and the champions and runners-up will be richer by Rs 12 lakh and Rs 7 lakh, respectively. 

 Defending champions Mahindra United will kick off the meet against Chirag United SC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday. 

 However, there will be no dope test in the tournament. Addressing a press conference on the occasion, IFA secretary Subrata Dutta, though, said that full-proof medical measures will be taken to avoid any Junior-like incident. Dempos Brazilian striker Junior died following a fall on the ground during the Federation Cup final against Mohun Bagan two years ago in Bangalore. 

 Aniket Roy and Sayantan Sikdar will play the nursery boys final of the Cossimbazar Table Tennis Meet, being played at the Khudiram Anushilan Kendra. In the semi-finals, Aniket beat Dipan Chakraborty 4-11, 12-10, 11-9 while Sayantan got the better of Raheel Khan 11-13, 11-6, 11-5. 

 Badminton Players Association (WB) with the help of sponsors Yonex-Sunrise, will start five meets in a bid to unearth talents at the grassroots level. Free kits will be given to 8 players, selected from various coaching centres and tournaments.

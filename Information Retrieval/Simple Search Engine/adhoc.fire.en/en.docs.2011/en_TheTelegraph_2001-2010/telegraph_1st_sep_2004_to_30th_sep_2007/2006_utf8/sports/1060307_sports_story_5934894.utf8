The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Berlin: The German Swimming Federation (DSV) will consider erasing national records set by swimmers from former communist East Germany that have since been tainted by evidence of doping practices.

 The move follows similar steps taken by the German Athletics Federation (DLV), who said last year it would tackle the issue for track and field records.

 ?We believe it is necessary to address this problem and we will liaise with the DLV,? DSV general secretary Juergen Fornoff said on Monday. 

 London: Britain?s Simon Dyson jumped 60 places to 140th in the world rankings issued on Monday after his win at the Indonesian Open.

 The 28-year-old Englishman finished two shots ahead of Australian Andrew Buckle in the European Tour event on Sunday.

 Tiger Woods extended his lead over Vijai Singh to 9.15 points at the top of the rankings following his one-stroke victory at the Doral Championship. 

 Madrid: Deportivo Coruna?s Portugal centre-back Jorge Andrade will miss the World Cup and be sidelined for between five and sixth months after undergoing surgery on his knee, the club said on Monday.

 Andrade, a regular in Luiz Felipe Scolari?s national side, severed the patellar tendon in his left knee during Deportivo?s 2-3 defeat at Barcelona on Saturday.

 The 27-year-old was carried off the pitch on 

 a stretcher in the 58th minute after colliding with his 

 own keeper Jose Molina as the two players tried to stop 

 Barcelona striker Samuel Eto?o reaching the ball.

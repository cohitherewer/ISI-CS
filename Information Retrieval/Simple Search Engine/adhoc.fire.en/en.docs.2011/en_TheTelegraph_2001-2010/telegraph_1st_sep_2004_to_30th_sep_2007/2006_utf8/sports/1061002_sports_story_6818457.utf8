 Moody: Not in favour of many experiments 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody on Sunday said that he was not the one who would like to do too many experiments with the team. The Australian, who arrived with the squad here, said the main idea should be to win matches and focus on the game in proper manner. 

I am not in favour of too many experiments, he said. The batsmen, bowlers and fielders should know what to do. It is basically a matter of having the focus and self-belief of the cricketers. That helps a team win. 

Moody also looked confident on the eve of the tournament. I think we can win the Champions Trophy. Our captain Mahela Jayawardene has every chance of holding the trophy after the final, he said. 

Both Moody and skipper Mahela Jayawardene warned that it would not be right to judge the present Sri Lankan squad on the basis of the thrashing the islanders had received at the hands of Team India in their last tour. 

Since then the team has matured immensely, Moody said. These players are technically a highly improved lot and a few of them like Tillekeratne Dilshan are really world class. 

According to the coach, one should not also form an opinion about his players on the basis of current ODI rankings (currently No. 6). The ranking table doesnt matter most. The result, we promise, would be different. 

Asked to comment on his recent successes, Jayawardene said that playing at No. 3 position has given him a lot of freedom. Till 2003, when Aravinda De Silva was still around, I had no permanent position in the batting order. Now that I have a fixed slot in batting, it has helped me improve my performance. 

Jayawardene said it was great to find Sanath Jayasuriya back in the team. I am not sure where he will play in the batting order, but his presence gives a balance to the side.

 on Wednesday

 Baden Baden: Michael Owen 

 will miss the rest of the World Cup after tearing the anterior 

 cruciate ligament in his right knee. 

The England striker was injured on Tuesday in the second minute of his teams 2-2 draw with Sweden in Cologne. Owen had a scan on his knee on Wednesday, near Englands team base in southern Germany. 

It has now been confirmed that the injury will prevent Michael playing any further part in the World Cup and he will return to England immediately, the FA said on its Web site. 

Obviously its a massive blow to suffer the injury ? and be out of the World Cup, Owen said in a statement. As soon as it happened I knew I was in trouble. 

Owens right knee buckled after he had played a pass. He rolled off the field and lay on the sideline clutching his leg. He was treated by doctors and then taken off on a stretcher. 

The FA said Owens recovery would be handled by his club Newcastle. 

Owen said he was clearly sorry to leave Germany but was convinced England would be a success. Ill be following all the matches very closely and giving them my full support, he said. 

Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand was given the all-clear after a scan on the groin problem he picked up in Tuesdays match, while Gary Neville is improving, the FA said.

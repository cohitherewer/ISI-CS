 Justine, Roddick in Round II

 New York: Justine Henin-Hardenne 

 began the US Open with a 74-minute victory over Maria Elena 

 Camerin, eliminating the Italian 6-2, 6-1 as the last of 

 the years Grand Slams started late and under cloudy skies. 

 Overnight rain followed by lingering 

 showers held up the start of play for about 90 minutes. 

 The No. 2 seed, however, broke Camerin early and easily 

 advanced to the second round. 

 Number 9 Andy Roddick avoided 

 a repeat of last year when he was eliminated in the first 

 round by Luxembourgs Gilles Muller, needing only an hour, 

 15 minutes to get past Florent Serra of France 6-2, 6-1, 

 6-3. Camerin took an injury timeout, leaving the court after 

 the third game of the second set to seek care for a thigh 

 injury. 

 No. 28 seed Ai Sugiyama of Japan 

 was the first to reach the second round, taking only 41 

 minutes to beat the Czech Republics Zuzana Ondraskova 6-1, 

 6-0. 

 Among other early womens results, 

 No. 21 Shahar Peer of Israel beat Vasilisa Bardina of Russia 

 6-2, 6-2; No. 26 Marion Bartoli defeated Olga Poutchkova 

 of Russia 6-4, 6-0 and 33rd seed Vera Zvonareva downed Marta 

 Domachowska of Poland 7-6 (4), 6-3. 

 On the mens side, Mikhail Youzhny 

 scored the first upset, eliminating 19th-seeded Dominik 

 Hrbaty 7-5, 6-1, 6-3. In another match, No. 20 Novak Djokovic 

 of Serbia overcame a first-set loss to beat American Donald 

 Young 4-6, 6-3, 6-0, 6-1.

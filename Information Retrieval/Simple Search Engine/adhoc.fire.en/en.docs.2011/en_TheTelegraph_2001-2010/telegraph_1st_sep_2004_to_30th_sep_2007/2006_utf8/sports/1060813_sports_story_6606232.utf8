 Chance for Dhoni to be No. 1 again

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The tri-series in Sri Lanka, which begins on Monday, will give South Africa, India and Sri Lanka a chance to improve their ICC ODI rankings. 

The players too, will get similar opportunities. 

Team India will be keen to prove that their 1-4 drubbing at the hands of the West Indies was a one-off thing and that they are well on track for the Champions Trophy scheduled to start at home in October. 

The tri-series will provide Mahendra Singh Dhoni a great chance to reclaim the top spot in the ODI batsmens list, a position he had briefly held earlier this year. 

Dhoni is 30 rating points behind current leader Adam Gilchrist. A string of good scores could help him displace the Australian, according to an ICC release.

 WI staring at defeat

Wellington: Bad light halted play early on the third day of the second Test between New Zealand and the West Indies on Sunday with the visitors struggling to save the match and series. 

West Indies were 118 for four at close, with Shivnarine Chanderpaul on 13 and Dwayne Bravo on two and needing another 62 runs to make New Zealand bat again. 

West Indies captain Chanderpaul, however, was lucky to have still been batting after he was dropped by counterpart Stephen Fleming before tea. 

Fleming was taken to hospital for X-rays on his wrist after dropping Chanderpaul, who was on five at the time, but suffered only heavy bruising and is expected to resume on Monday. 

Openers Chris Gayle and Daren Ganga were the only batsmen to appear comfortable against New Zealands attack. 

Gayle was dismissed for 68, his 22nd Test half century, while Ganga was caught behind by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Chris Martin during the first session for 23. 

West Indies had gone to the tea break on 116 for four and added just two runs before the umpires offered them the light, which they had no hesitation in taking.

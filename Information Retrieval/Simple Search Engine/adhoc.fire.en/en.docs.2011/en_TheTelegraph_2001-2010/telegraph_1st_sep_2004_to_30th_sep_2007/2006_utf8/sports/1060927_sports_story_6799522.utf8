 Tri-series was a disaster: Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev on Tuesday blamed the star-studded Indian batting line up for the debacle in the recent tri-series and said it was high time the team won matches when it mattered most. Kapil said he had no problems if the team tried out certain experiments with the batting order provided it gave the desired results. 

They have to put their heads down together and think. They (batsmen) have not played an innings when it matters to the team, Kapil said. It was a disaster and they have let the country down. I know they must be giving their best but their best in not enough. 

Our bowlers have bowled well in Malaysia but the batsmen let us down. We say that our team has the top batsmen of the world but when it matters they do not perform. They are capable of better performance and they need to think about it, he said. 

When asked whether too much of experiments with the batting line up is the reason behind their failure, he said, I dont care what experiments you do but you should win matches. The results matter to me. They should sit down and plan what is best for the team. 

On whether Rahul Dravid should follow his own instincts than be dictated by coach Greg Chappell, he said, Dravid has his own brain and he knows what is best for the team and he will do that. 

On whether Irfan Pathans promotion as a batsman is hampering his bowling, he said, Well, the team has do decide on what they want from Pathan. But my advice to him is that he should know his priorities and he is a bowler first and then a batsman. (Pti)

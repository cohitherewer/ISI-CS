The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 GFA disgusted with Fransa Pax

 - Other Goan clubs approach players 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Goas Fransa Pax seem to be getting lonelier in the Indian football circuit. After their much publicised confrontation with the All India Football Federation (AIFF) recently, it was the turn of Goa Football Association (GFA) to condemn their own affiliated club. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Thursday, GFA secretary Savio Messais said that he was disgusted with Fransas attitude, and felt the club chairman Micky Pacheco was taking things too far. He said he was also surprised that the AIFF was taking such a long time in taking a decision on this issue. 

We in the GFA had stood solidly behind Fransa in the recent AIFF meeting even after the club and its supporters created problems in the match against Mahindra United here, Messias said. But now they have criticised us in front of the AIFF disciplinary committee only to get an escape route. 

On Wednesday, Fransa manager Anthony Fernandes denied that the club supporters damaged the stadium and challenged the GFA to prove the allegations with video evidence. Fransa are only trying to make an issue out of it, said Messais. 

The GFA, Messais claimed, did not write to Fransa about damaging the stadium since it would have only aggravated the issue and damage the interest of the footballers. As it is, they would have never paid the money. Now they are picking on us to cover up for their own fault. 

Pacheco, according to Messias, has been continuously making uncomplimentary remarks in public against the AIFF that would go against the interest of Goan football. Goa has been doing well in the last couple of years. The state as well as the club teams are winning trophies all over the country. Any adverse action against Fransa by AIFF would only harm Goan football. 

Meanwhile, other Goan clubs have already started approaching Fransa players to sign for their respective sides even though the AIFF kept their decision on the Goan side pending. While Salgaocar have already approached Gordon Franco and Creston Antao, Sporting Clube de Goa are talking to Marcos Peixto and Peter Carvalho. Dempo coach Armando Colaco has also expressed his willingness to recruit a couple of Fransa players.

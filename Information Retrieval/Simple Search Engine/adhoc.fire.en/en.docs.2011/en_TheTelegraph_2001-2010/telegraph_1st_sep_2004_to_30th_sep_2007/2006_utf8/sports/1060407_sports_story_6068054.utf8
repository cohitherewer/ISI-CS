 Bopanna to face Qureshi in opener

Mumbai: A battle of big servers is to kick off the Asia-Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup play-off tie between India and Pakistan at the CCIs lawns from Friday. 

Pakistans No. 1 player Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi, ranking of 416 in the world, will face India No. 2 Rohan Bopanna (235) in the first singles, according to the draw held on Thurdsay. The second singles will pit India No. 1 Prakash Amritraj against Pakistan No. 2 Aqeel Khan. 

Pakistan sprang a surprise by naming the inexperienced combination of Jalil Khan and Asim Shafik to take on captain Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in Saturdays doubles. 

The reverse singles are on Sunday. 

Bopanna, a good friend of Qureshi, said that the match would be a battle of big servers, adding, This will be the first time I will be playing him on grass. 

Qureshi, who has beaten Bopanna in their only meeting so far, said that would not count for much. 

I have played and beaten him once last year. But the Davis Cup is a different ball game. Playing the opening match does not bother me as last year too I played all my matches first. It does not matter much, he said. 

Definitely the match will be serve-oriented. I am sure the match court would be quick. 

Aqeel said he would depend on his serve and forehand. I have played Prakash before and lost. But Davis Cup is different. 

Pakistans non-playing captain Rashid Malik said both Shafik and Jalil would be making their debut as a doubles pair in Davis Cup. Both have already represented Pakistan in singles ? against Chinese Taipei in February. 

 Thursdays draw was done by Maharashtra governor 

 S.M. Krishna.

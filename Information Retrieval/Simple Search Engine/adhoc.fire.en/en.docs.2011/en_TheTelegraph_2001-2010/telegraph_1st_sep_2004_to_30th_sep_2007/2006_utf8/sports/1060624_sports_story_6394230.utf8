 Kunderan passes away in Scotland

Mumbai: Former India wicketkeeper Budhisagar (Budhi) Krishnappa Kunderan died in Scotland on Friday. Kunderan, 66, was suffering from lung cancer. The Mangalore-born cricketer, who played 18 Tests, is survived by wife, two sons and a daughter-in-law, said his brother and former cricketer Bharat Kunderan. 

He died at 2 am, Scotland time, and the last rites will be performed there only, Bharat said. 

Kunderan slammed two Test hundreds, including a 192, and three fifties for an impressive average of 32.70. He took 23 catches and effected seven stumpings. 

Kunderan made his debut under the late Gulabrai Ramchands captaincy against Richie Benauds Australia at the Brabourne Stadium in January 1960 and last played for the country in 1967. 

He represented Mysore and South Zone in Duleep Trophy. After his playing days, he migrated to Scotland where he got married and settled down. 

Former India captain Nari Contractor described Kunderan as flamboyant while another former captain Ajit Wadekar called him as an absolute team man. 

The news has come as a shock to me. I have been in touch with him and the last time I spoke to him, about a month ago, he said he was undergoing a new type of treatment after which he hoped to get better, said Contractor. Yes, it was unfortunate that his career coincided with Farokh Engineers. 

Wadekar recalled his Test debut against Gary Sobers West Indies when the departed cricketer consoled him after his first innings failure at the Brabourne Stadium. Kunderan was slightly senior to me as far as international cricket was concerned. But we played together later for India. He was a team man to the core, a dashing opening batsman. (PTI)

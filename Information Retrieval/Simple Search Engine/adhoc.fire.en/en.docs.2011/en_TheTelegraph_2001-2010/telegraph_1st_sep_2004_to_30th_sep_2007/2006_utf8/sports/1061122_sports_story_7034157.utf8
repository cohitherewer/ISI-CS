 Sobha crosses 5800-mark

 - Andhra girl likely to join Soma on flight to Doha 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sobha is expected to pip Sushmita to the second berth 

New Delhi: The heptathlon trials at the Nehru Stadium on Tuesday went on the expected lines with lone participant J.J. Sobha duly crossing the 5800 point-barrier to stake her claim in the athletics squad for the Asian Games. 

At a time when the Bengal lobby, which includes selection committee member Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, had been pushing for the inclusion of both Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roy, Sobha managed to collect a stunning 5861 points. At the end of Day I, she was on 3287 points. 

Considering the fact that Sobhas best showing this season before Tuesday had been 5734, it was a remarkable improvement. 

It may be recalled that both Soma and Sushmita had decided to stay away from the fray after Athletics Federation of India (AFI) called for fresh trials, setting aside the impressive records of the two Bengal girls in the Federation Cup, Open Nationals and the inter-state meet. 

It was widely believed that the trials were called only to offer another chance to Sobha to get into the squad after the Andhra Pradesh girl finished third behind Soma and Sushmita in all three major meets of the season. 

Sobha, who on Tuesday scored 6.34 in long jump, 45.80 in javelin and 2.18:87 in 800 metres, has now bettered the marks of Soma (5799) and Sushmita (5761) this year. With this, Sobha is likely to fill up the second berth after Soma in the athletics squad for heptathlon. There is now every indication that Sushmita will be dropped. 

The selection committee of the AFI met immediately after the trials to select the Asian Games team, but refrained from announcing it. The AFI secretary Lalit Bhanot said the team list would be released on Wednesday.

 Robinho ruled out vs Ghana

Bergisch Gladbach: Brazil forward Robinho will miss Tuesdays World Cup second round match against Ghana due to a thigh injury, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said on Monday. 

The 22-year-old, whose speed and trickery added a new dimension to the Brazilian attack in last weeks 4-1 win over Japan, pulled up in training on Saturday. He was seen clutching his right thigh during shooting practice. 

Robinho is ruled out of the match and will continue his physiotherapy, said the CBF on their official website on Monday. We did an MRI scan today, theres no rupturing of the tendons, there is an edema but the outlook is very good, said team doctor Jose Luis Runco, adding that this type of injury usually needed five days to heal. 

Weve ruled out any possibility of Robinho being forced out of the tournament. 

Runco said that Robinho would not travel to Dortmund but would stay at the team hotel to continue physiotherapy. 

Im a bit sad and a bit upset to get injured, but fortunately it was nothing worse, said Robinho, adding he had never suffered a muscular injury before. Having to stay behind at the hotel was a bit different, Im used to going out and training. (Reuters)

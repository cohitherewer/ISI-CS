The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sachin cant get a hundred each time he bats

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Former captain Zaheer Abbas on the art of batting 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Karachi: If David Gower is regarded as arguably the most elegant left-hander of recent times, Zaheer Abbas enjoys that rating among right-handers. The former Pakistan captain, who scored 5,062 Test runs (average 44.79, 12x100) and 2,572 in ODIs (average 47.62, 7x100), spoke to The Telegraph the other afternoon. 

The following are excerpts: 

On the must qualities for batsmen 

Mental toughness... Talent, obviously... A love for staying at the wicket... Also, the ability to pick the balls coming in and those which go out. If somebody has a high percentage of the qualities Ive listed, hes going to be more than a good batsman. 

On his idol 

Hanif Mohammed... The master of the flick was a superstar... Because he was built so lightly, we would worry about him getting hit! It was special when he, too, was in the XI on my Test debut (against New Zealand, in 1969-70). It turned out to be his last appearance, but... While Hanif was my idol, I actually enjoyed Rohan Kanhais batting the most... His strokes had grace written all over. 

On interacting with Hanif 

Its not that we only talked about the game... I saw him as a guide in general and had the good fortune of being associated with him in PIA... Hanif was my guruji... Its important to rub shoulders with big achievers... I certainly gained by doing so... Its one thing to follow your idol through reports in the Media or via the radio/TV, quite another to sit with him and get an insight into a tough game... Get an insight into his technique... Learn about the attitude of a champion? 

On his era having a higher number of great batsmen 

(Laughs) Look, I wont say that the standard of cricket has declined, for its not easy getting a hundred against a blind team... However, cricket was tougher in my time... Most teams had a couple of genuine quicks and, with fewer teams, the overall standard was better. Youve got to remember we didnt have computer analysts... No physio and physical trainer, either... The facilities, too, have improved ? every country, I think, has at least one academy now... 

On the effect of ODIs on batsmen 

There are positives, certainly, but the batsmen have got into the habit of playing too many shots too early. 

 Zaheer Abbas

On the five batsmen (alphabetically) of the present times he would pay to watch 

Adam Gilchrist: Can destroy any attack and tear reputations to shreds... A matchwinner who controls the pace splendidly. 

Inzamam-ul Haq: Again, a matchwinner... Has performed exceptionally under pressure and captaincy hasnt burdened him. 

Jacques Kallis: Hes technically solid and has a wide range of strokes... A matchwinner by any yardstick. 

Brian Lara: An entertainer with a huge appetite for runs... Not just me, others will also pay to watch him... Some have questioned his attitude, but the sheer weight of his runs cant be ignored. 

Sachin Tendulkar: Ive watched him from his debut Test and, really, he has grown into such a champion... Hes not a machine, though, and cant get a hundred each time he bats... People should realise that. 

On whether he would have paid to watch a Barry Richards, somebody he played against in County cricket 

Absolutely... Had South Africa not been sent into isolation, Im convinced he would have emerged the greatest batsman... Believe me, Barry was so good... I love watching stroke-makers and there was nobody better than him. 

Finally, on his message for emerging batsmen 

Look to play a long innings and be strong both in mind and body.

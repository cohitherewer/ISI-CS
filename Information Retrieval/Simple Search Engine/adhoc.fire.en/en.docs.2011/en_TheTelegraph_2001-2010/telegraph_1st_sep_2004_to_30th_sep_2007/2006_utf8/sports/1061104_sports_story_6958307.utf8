 Duo cant move court straightaway

Islamabad: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif cant go to the court against the ban imposed on them without obtaining a clearance from the Wada. 

Dr Waqar Ahmad, part of the three-man PCB tribunal, said the duo could move court only after their case is rejected by Wada. 

Three options are available. One is to ask for a review by the tribunal within seven days. The second is to ask the PCB to constitute a new panel to conduct a fresh inquiry within one month. The third is to ask Wada to form an inquiry commission, Dr Ahmad said. (PTI)

 Narrow escape for Rohan

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rohan Gavaskar had a narrow escape when he was struck below the right ear under fading light on Wednesday. He nearly suffered a blackout as he fell to the ground after being hit by a Harvinder Singh delivery. It took a while before he was back on his feet. 

The ball did not bounce as expected and hit him just below the helmet. The ball hit him on the carotid gland. He told me he had lost control for a while but recovered instantly on his own, Dr Subrata Goswami, who attended on Rohan in the dressing room after the end of the second days play, said. 

Dr Goswami informed that no scan was needed and the batsman was doing fine. 

If that was not enough, he was hit on the hand off the very next delivery as he tried to fend. An X-ray, however, did not reveal any damage. 

Rohan was confident of resuming the innings on Thursday.

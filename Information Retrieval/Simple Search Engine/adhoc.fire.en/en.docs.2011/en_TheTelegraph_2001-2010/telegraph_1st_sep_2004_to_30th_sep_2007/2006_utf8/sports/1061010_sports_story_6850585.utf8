 Inzy refused to take field: Zaheer

London: Pakistans team manager during England tour Zaheer Abbas has said Inzamam-ul Haq has lost the confidence of officials in Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in the wake of The Oval Test debacle. Zaheer also said the refusal to play on the fourth day of The Oval Test was Inzamams choice. 

Pakistans management is not happy with Inzamam, Zaheer told a British radio. I requested him to go into the field at The Oval, chairman Shaharyar Khan and a few members of the team too, but he refused. 

Inzamam said, I dont want to go in the field; if the boys want they can. 

Meanwhile, another top PCB official Abbas Zaidi, the director for board operations, resigned on Monday. Yes I have resigned. I decided this was the best time to go. I am feeling very relieved. I felt it was fair that the new chairman should be given the opportunity to have his team to run the cricket affairs, Zaidi said. (PTI)

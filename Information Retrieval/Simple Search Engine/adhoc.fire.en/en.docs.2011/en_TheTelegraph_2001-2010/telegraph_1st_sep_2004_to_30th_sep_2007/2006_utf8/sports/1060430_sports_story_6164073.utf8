 Atwal, Chopra miss the cut

 Zurich classic meet

 New Orleans: Arjun Atwal 

 and Daniel Chopra missed the cut at the Zurich Classic of 

 New Orleans, an event, where both of them had top-10 finishes 

 last year.

 Atwal, who has been struggling 

 with his game this season, had a see-saw round with five 

 birdie, four bogeys and two doubles bogeys for a round of 

 75 that saw him finish one-over 145 for two rounds. The 

 cut came at four-under despite strong wind blowing across 

 the golf course.

 Chopra shot a 76 with four birdies, 

 three bogeys, one double and a triple on the par-5 15th. 

 He ended at four-over 148.

 Meanwhile, Joe Durant shot a round 

 of eight-under 64 with eight birdies to take a two-stroke 

 lead. He was 12-under followed by Brett Wetterich (65).

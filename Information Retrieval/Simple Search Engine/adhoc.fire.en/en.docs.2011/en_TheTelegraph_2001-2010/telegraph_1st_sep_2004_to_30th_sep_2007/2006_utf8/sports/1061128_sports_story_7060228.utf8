 Sania No. 10 on list of tennis beauties

 Beijing: The Chinese media 

 has included Sania Mirza among the worlds all-time 

 top 10 tennis beauties along with Russian star 

 Maria Sharapova and former player Gabriela Sabatini. 

 Sania figures in 10th spot, behind Belgian and world 

 No. 1 Justine Henin-Hardenne, in the list by the official 

 Xinhua news agency. 

The Indian star was shown wearing a traditional Indian dress as well as donning skimpy tennis attire, a picture apparently shot during a Grand Slam championship. 

Sania may be a big hit with her looks and the fashion statement she makes, but her game needs a great deal of improvement. 

She ended the year at world No. 66 after starting it in the thirties. None will be more aware of it than Sania herself.

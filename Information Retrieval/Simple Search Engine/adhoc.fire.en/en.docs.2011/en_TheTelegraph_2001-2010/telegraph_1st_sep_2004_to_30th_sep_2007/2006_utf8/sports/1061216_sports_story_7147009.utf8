The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We stuck to our task, 

 says Pereira

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Derick Pereira didnt thank Lady Luck for Mahindra Uniteds IFA Shield triumph at Salt Lake Stadium. Not even after Mohun Bagan had two attempts thwarted by the woodwork and one push cleared off the goalline. 

We were not lucky, we stuck to our task and put up a very professional performance, the Mahindra United coach said at the post-match conference. 

We got a goal in the first half and defended well in the latter stages. We only had 14 fit and eligible players on the bench, I had to push men up front to midfield Couldnt take too many chances, Pereira elaborated. 

Thanking the support staff for keeping the team in shape despite Thursdays bandh, Pereira said he was looking forward to the Federation Cup which kicks off at the same venue on Monday. The defending champions take on United SC on the very first day. 

Asked why the Jose Ramirez Barreto and Bhaichung Bhutia was not too effective, Pereira praised his defence for doing a fine job of containing them.

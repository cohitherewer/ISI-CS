 Fransa Paxs fate in Das Munshis hands

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The days of Fransa Pax in the ONGC Cup for the National Football League (NFL) seem number-ed after the Goan outfit refused to accept the lifeline offered to them by the All India Football Federation (AIFF). 

While the coach, manager and the goalkeeper of Fransa met the disciplinary committee of the AIFF in the capital on Wednesday to explain their conduct during the Fransa-Mahindra United tie on January 30, the federation seems to be more upset with the behaviour of the club chairman. 

Sources said that Fransas fate now lies solely in the hands of AIFF president Priyaranjan Das Munshi, who is likely to take a decision on Thursday. 

But the AIFF is extremely upset that the Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco has refused to toe the AIFF lines of rapprochement. 

According to sources, an official of the Goa Football Association (GFA), on behalf of the AIFF, met Pacheco on Tuesday and requested him to send a letter of apology to the AIFF. 

The GFA official also showed Pacheco an apology letter drafted by the federation, and asked him to sign it after typing it out on his letterhead. 

Pacheco, who is also the Minister of Agriculture of Goa, not only refused to write the letter but is also believed to have made quite a few uncomplimentary remarks against the AIFF and its bosses. 

Talks seem to have broken down and it is only a matter of time before Fransa is shown the door, said an AIFF official. 

There is every possibility that the AIFF may suspend Fransa and opt for a nine-team league. 

Meanwhile, goalkeeper Virender Singh, manager Anthony Fernandes and coach Norbert Gonsalves from Fransa ? who were asked to appear in front of the disciplinary committee, said none of them were involved in manhandling the referee and other match officials in the match against Mahindra. 

All we did was to protest the referees decision to award a penalty against us, they said.

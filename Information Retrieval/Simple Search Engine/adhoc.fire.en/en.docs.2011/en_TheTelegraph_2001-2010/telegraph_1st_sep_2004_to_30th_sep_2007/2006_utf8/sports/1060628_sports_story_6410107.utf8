 Pressure is good for me: Ronaldo

 - I sensed I had to trick the goalie somehow

Dortmund: Ronaldo broke a World Cup record by scoring his 15th finals goal in Brazils 3-0 second-round defeat of Ghana, but said the new mark had not been a particular target for him. 

The 29-year-old expertly converted a breakaway chance in the fifth minute to set the champions on their way to a quarter final meeting with either France or Spain. 

That (the record) was never my goal, its just something thats happened, he told reporters. Im happy to have broken this record; for seven World Cups it had not been broken. 

He continued: Its a great satisfaction to make this record, but lets not forget our main objective is to reach the final. The players are very confident and our team is meeting our goals. 

I hope they continue falling for my tricks up to the final, he said, referring to his clever dummy of Ghana keeper Richard Kingson in scoring. 

I sensed I had to trick the goalie somehow. I figured it would complicate things if I kept the ball too long so I decided to do that dribble. 

Despite the scoreline, Ronaldo, who scored twice in the World Cup final 2-0 victory over Germany in 2002, said it had not all been plain-sailing for Brazil against an aggressive and spirited Ghana team. 

It wasnt easy to play today. Everyone who plays Brazil will give everything, he said. 

If people put me under pressure, its actually good for me because then I can show what I can really do. 

The Brazilian defence was very good. It was a worry and today there was great calm. We knew the second half would be very difficult, as it was. It was a team playing against Brazil with nothing to lose, midfielder Gilberto Silva told reporters. 

Ghana coach Ratomir Dujkovic paid tribute to his own side who battled from first to last. 

Im very proud of our players. They fought from the first minute of the first match to the last minute today, he told reporters. 

We missed some important chances, they scored three goals. They are a fantastic team and if you give them a fraction of a second, they will finish you. 

Dujkovic was banished to the stands at the end of the first half by the Slovakian referee Lubos Michel. I said it would be better for us if he put on a yellow jersey, he explained.

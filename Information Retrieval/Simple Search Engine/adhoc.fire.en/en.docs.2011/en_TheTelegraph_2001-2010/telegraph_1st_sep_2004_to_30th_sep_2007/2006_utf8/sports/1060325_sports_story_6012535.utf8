 Aurelian may come good 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: J S Dhariwal trained Aurelian looks good to win the Sringeri Plate here on Saturday. Carrying 62-kg, the five-year-old Pennine Ridge-progeny was a game second to Minstrel Girl on the Invitation Cup day. 

 Aurelian has now been assigned a light-impost in the higher Class and may have a decisive say at the finish in the hands of jockey A. Imran Khan.

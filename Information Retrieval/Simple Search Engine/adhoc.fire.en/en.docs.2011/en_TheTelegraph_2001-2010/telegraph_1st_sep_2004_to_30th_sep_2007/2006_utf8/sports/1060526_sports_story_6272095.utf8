The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ex-cricketers hold meeting

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A clutch of former Bengal cricketers on Thursday met at a city club to garner support in Sourav Gangulys favour. Among those present was also city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 

The meeting took up issues relating to cricket in the state and held the current regime at Cricket Association of Bengal responsible for not doing much at the grassroots level. 

The meeting, which comes close on the heels of the annual general meeting at the CAB, also raised talks of the opposition contesting the elections. 

Meanwhile, state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty called on Jagmohan Dalmiya at the CAB in the evening. 

Nothing should be read into my visit. It was on the cards for the last few days since I won the Assembly elections. I am not at all involved with the CAB polls, he clarified. He, however, refused to disclose what transpired during the discussions.

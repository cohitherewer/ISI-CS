 Shiv ousts Atwal from No. 2 spot

New Delhi: Shiv Kapur ousted Arjun Atwal from the No. 2 spot among Indians in the latest world golf rankings. 

Shiv finds himself at 152nd spot in the world, losing three places after of missing the cut at the Macau Open. 

But it was a steeper fall for Atwal, who also failed to make it to the weekend at the Colonial Classic on the US PGA Tour and dropped ten places to be ranked a notch below Shiv. 

However, Jyoti Randhawa maintained his top ranking among Indians despite dropping one spot to 123rd in the world. 

Randhawa, who missed the cut at the Irish Open in Dublin, is the third ranked golfer from the Asian Tour after Korean Choi Kyung-ju (44th) and Thailands Thongchai Jaidee (96th). 

Jeev Milkha Singh held on to his 161st place on the ranking chart. 

Tiger Woods continued to head the rankings ahead of Phil mickelson and South African Retief Goosen. Vijai Singh is ranked fourth ahead of American Jim Furyk. 

The top 10 is rounded off by South African Ernie Els, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, American David Toms, Australian Adam Scott and Englishman Luke Donald. 

American Tim Herron, meanwhile, rose 27 places to 33rd in the world rankings after his win at the Colonial. 

Herron, 36, registered his first PGA Tour victory since 1999 when he beat Swedens Richard Johnson at the second playoff hole in Fort Worth, Texas on Sunday. 

Denmarks Thomas Bjorn climbed three to 30th after his one-shot win over Briton Paul Casey at the rain-affected Irish Open. 

In the only change to the top 10, Toms moved up one position to eighth, swapping places with Scott.

 Yorke set for a new role

 Dwight Yorke

Rotenburg: Dwight Yorkes old Manchester United teammates might have a hard time recognising him in his new role. Once one of the most prolific strikers in the Premier League, Yorke spent his first World Cup game for Trinidad and Tobago in a defensive midfield role. 

 Instead of creating scoring chances in Trinidads 0-0 draw against Sweden, Yorke was breaking them up with sliding tackles, headers and anticipation. 

In a million years I never thought that I would be in the midfield like I was, Yorke said. I thought Id be playing in front like I always have in my football career. But the manager had his plan and it has worked out well for us. 

Yorke will take his new role into Thursdays Group B showdown with England, the country where he spent most of his adult life while playing for Aston Villa, Manchester United, Birmingham and Blackburn. 

 After watching his teammates head off to the World Cup every four years, Yorke will get the chance to match up against former Manchester United teammates David Beckham, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville. England is something I always dreamed of wanting to play against, Yorke said. I thought that opportunity had passed. 

Yorke has already traded text messages at the World Cup with Neville and Ferdinand and talks often with Beckham. 

But, Yorke, 34, is a different player than he was in his prime, when he scored 48 goals in 96 matches for Manchester United. He helped the team win the Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League titles in 1999. 

 His star has fallen since leaving Manchester United in 2002. He struggled in stints with Birmingham and Blackburn before moving to Australia to play with Sydney. 

His former teammates still expect to see the Yorke of old instead of an old Yorke on Thursday. I have been known throughout my career as a striker but I felt over the past couple of years that I could contribute to any team I was on in the middle of the pitch, Yorke said. I have learned the game. I have been around a long time and managed to play alongside some great midfielders. 

Coach Leo Beenhakker gave Yorke a free role, allowing the veteran to decide where he can best help the team. He said Yorkes biggest attribute is helping the team get ? and keep ? the ball, which allows Trinidad not to be on the defensive. (AP)

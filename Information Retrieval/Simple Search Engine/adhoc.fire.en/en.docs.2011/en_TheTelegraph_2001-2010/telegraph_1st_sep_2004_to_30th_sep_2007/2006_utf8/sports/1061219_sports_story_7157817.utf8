 ECB: Fletcher review after World Cup

London: Duncan Fletchers position as England coach will be reviewed after next years World Cup following the loss of the Ashes, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Monday. 

Australia regained the Ashes after beating England by 206 runs in the third Test to take a winning 3-0 lead in the five-match series. 

I think that can be true, ECB chief executive David Collier told BBC Radio Five when asked if coaches have a shelf life. But were in the middle of a series still. Weve got two important Tests in Sydney and Melbourne, weve then got the one-day series, we then go into the World Cup, Collier added. 

After the World Cup is the time we will truly reflect on where we go for the next four years. We tend to work in four-year cycles. 

Fletcher has been widely criticised for Englands lacklustre performances and for selecting left-arm spinner Ashley Giles ahead of Monty Panesar for the first two Tests. 

Wicketkeeper Geraint Jones was also brought back for the series but has been short of runs.

 Paes-Damm off to smooth beginning

Melbourne: Leander Paes and Martin Damm got their Australian Open campaign off to a smooth start here on Wednesday. 

The Indo-Czech pair, seeded No. 7, defeated wild cards Peter Luczak and Shannon Nettle 6-3, 6-2 in under an hour at the Melbourne Park. 

Paes and Damm have a 2-2 win-loss record going into the years first Grand Slam, having lost in the second round at both the Chennai Open and Sydney International. On Wednesday, though, they were far too strong for the unheralded local pair. 

Paes and Damm forced seven break-points and converted four. They could run into 11th seeds Mahesh Bhupathi and Wesley Moodie if the Indo-South African combination overcomes its first hurdle. 

In mixed doubles, Bhupathi, who will be teaming up with Martina Hingis (as was reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday), open against Yeu-Tzoo Wang of Chinese Taipei and Li Na of China. 

Paes, on the other hand, will be playing mixed with experienced Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy. Paes and Dechy have a tough first assignment, as they will be up against top seeds Kevin Ullyett and Cara Black of Zimbabwe.

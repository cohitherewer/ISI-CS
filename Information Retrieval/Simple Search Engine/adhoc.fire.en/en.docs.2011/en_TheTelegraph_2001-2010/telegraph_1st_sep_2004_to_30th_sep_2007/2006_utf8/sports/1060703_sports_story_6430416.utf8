 QUICK TAKES

 Fans 

 mob Azzurri during practice 

 Duisburg: Italy coach Marcello 

 Lippi, preparing for Tuesdays semi-final showdown 

 against Germany, was forced to open his training session 

 to the public after hundreds of noisy Italian fans turned 

 up to watch. Italy, who rarely bring many fans with them 

 to major tournaments, have enjoyed plenty of support from 

 German-based Italian supporters throughout the competition. 

 On the opening day of the finals, an Azzurri friendly match 

 against the youth team of German second division club MSV 

 Duisburg was watched by a crowd of 25,000.

 Gattuso jibe 

 Berlin: Gennaro Gattuso on Saturday night 

 struck the lowest blow so far in a row that has developed 

 between sections of the German media and the Italian team. 

 A German magazine Der Spiegel kicked off the increasingly 

 vicious spat with an editorial on Wednesday, describing 

 Italians as parasites, slimy and mammas boys. 

 The comments irked the Italians, with Gattuso suggesting 

 that Germans had got the hump with Italian attitude as they 

 are sick of their wives playing away from home with Latin 

 lovers.

 Borowski rubs salt 

 Berlin: Germany midfielder Tim Borowski poured 

 salt into Englands wounds on Sunday when he said they 

 lack nerve in penalty shootouts. I think were 

 just a little bit cooler than England in front of the goal, 

 said Borowski, who scored the decisive fourth penalty in 

 Germanys 4-2 win in a shootout after extra time over 

 Argentina in Fridays quarter final. 

 Fall in injury list 

 Berlin: A clampdown on tackling from behind 

 and the less frequent use of the elbow have contributed 

 to a fall in the number of injuries suffered by players 

 at the World Cup finals compared to four years ago. Professor 

 Jiri Dvorak, Fifas chief medical officer (CMO), told 

 reporters on Sunday: From 64 matches in 2002 there 

 were 171 injuries, compared to 129 injuries from the 58 

 matches collated so far. 

 Car crash 

 Berlin: A car crashed through security barriers 

 around the Fan Mile in central Berlin where 

 soccer fans have been gathering to watch World Cup matches, 

 police said on Sunday, adding seven people had suffered 

 slight injuries. It was unclear whether it was an accident 

 and the identity of the driver was not known. 

 Cristianos future 

 Gelsenkirchen: Cristiano Ronaldos days 

 at Manchester United appear to be numbered after his bust-up 

 with teammate Wayne Rooney during the quarter final win 

 over England on Saturday. He was captured by TV cameras 

 winking at his bench as Rooney walked off the pitch. I 

 complained to the referee about the foul but I didnt 

 ask for a red card, said the Portugal winger.

 69 arrested in Paris 

 Paris: Police arrested 69 people as troublemakers 

 smashed Paris shop windows and set two cars ablaze during 

 mostly peaceful celebrations of Frances victory over 

 Brazil, police said on Sunday. A policewoman was treated 

 in hospital after a bottle hit her. Waving flags and shouting: 

 We have won!, some 500,000 fans took to the 

 boulevard Champs Elysees rollerblading, cycling or just 

 walking.

 Djorkaeff caught red-handed 

 New York: Former France forward Youri Djorkaeff 

 was caught out by his New York Red Bulls soccer team on 

 Saturday when he was spotted at the France-Brazil quarter 

 final while supposedly attending a family emergency. We 

 were told by Youri on Thursday that he had to leave the 

 team and attend to an unexpected, serious family matter 

 in France, the team said in a statement after Djorkaeff 

 was picked out in the crowd. 

 Brazilians cry a river 

 Rio De Janeiro: Brazilians across the country 

 crawled out of bed on Sunday with their eyes swollen after 

 watching France shatter their dreams of another World Cup 

 victory. Defeat was too much for Nilda Amorim, 61, who was 

 rushed to the hospital just after the defeat. Shes 

 in an oxygen tent, said one of her friends. She 

 couldnt handle the tension of the last minutes, when 

 Brazil didnt manage to score a goal.

 Osim takes over 

 Tokyo: Former Yugoslav coach Ivica Osim confirmed on Sunday that he had been asked to replace Brazilian legend Zico as coach of Japans national team following their early exit from the World Cup in Germany. 

I think I received this offer because of what Ive done for Chiba (his former club) and their players and its a wonderful thing, Osim said a day after talks with Chiba and Japanese Football Association (JFA) officials.

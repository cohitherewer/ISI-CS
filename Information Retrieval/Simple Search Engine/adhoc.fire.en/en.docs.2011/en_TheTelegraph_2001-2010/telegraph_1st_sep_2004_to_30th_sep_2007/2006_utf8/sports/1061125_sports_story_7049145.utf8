 Shastri pulls up seniors

Durban: Former India captain Ravi Shastri has questioned the team selection as well as the performance of senior players after Indias gutless showing in the second ODI at Kingsmead. 

There was no fight from any of the batsmen not even from the ones who have vast amounts of experience, Shastri said. 

He said the selectors should have opted for Gautam Gambhir instead of Wasim Jaffer. Gambhir is the form man. I could not understand why he was not in the squad for this trip, he was quoted as saying by a local daily. 

If they have to salvage anything from this tour, the Indians will have to start showing some character or this is going to end in a disgrace. It was a gutless showing, Shastri said. (PTI)

 - FEDERATION CUP ATHLETICS 

 - Anju jumps to gold

 Anju Bobby George 

New Delhi: On a day when all cameras were focussed on long jumper Anju Bobby George, Bengals Sushmita Singha Roy dished out a sparkling display in heptathlon in the Federation Cup Athletic Championships at the Nehru Stadium here on Friday. 

Sushmitas tally of 5878 points may have been well short of JJ Sobhas national mark of 6211, but the lanky girls showing was her personal best in all events except the high jump. 

My previous best was 5419 points, Sushmita said. Here I was determined to tally at least 5800. I am happy that I could live up to my expectations. 

The Bengal girl said that she has improved upon her marks in hurdles, shot put, 200m, long jump, javelin and 800m. In high jump, I could manage only 1.72m, whereas my best is 1.80. Perhaps I could have done better. 

While Sushmita bagged the gold, the silver went to Asian Championship gold medallist Soma Biswas. Soma tallied 5857 and said she was satisfied with her performance. Both have been named in the provisional squad for the Commonwealth Games. 

There were 16 finals on the concluding day, but the spotlight was on Anju Bobby George. Anju, however, was not at her best. She clinched the gold but her best jump was 6.47 which was nowhere near her personal best of 6.83, registered during the Athens Olympic Games. 

I was not at my best, Anju admitted later. Somehow, I lost my rhythm. I was also in some pain. In the last and sixth jump, I could come around. But still I am not happy. 

Anju said she was planning to jump at least 6.70, which she was doing quite regularly at the Bangalore camp. Among the athletes who are going to Melbourne, the best jumper, I believe, has a mark of 6.67. I wanted to better that here. 

Anju will be competing in the World Indoor championship on March 11 and 12 and thereafter join the Indian contingent. 

In womens 400m, Bengals Pinki Paramanik finished fourth, behind Manjit Kaur, Chitra Soman and Satti Geetha, but it was enough for her to make the team for Melbourne in case the Athletic Federation of India decides to send the 4x400m relay team.

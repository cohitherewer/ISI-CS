 Raul unlikely to start vs Ukraine

Kamen: Spain coach Luis Aragones seems likely to name the team to play Ukraine without captain Raul Gonzalez in the line-up. 

The Real Madrid striker practised with the presumed substitutes Monday afternoon while Aragones drilled 11 players likely to start in the group H opener. The coach also fielded the line-up ? including David Villa, Fernando Torres and Luis Garcia up front ? in a training match on Sunday. 

Xavi Hernandez, Xabi Alonso and Marcos Senna formed a three-man midfield, with Mariano Pernia, Carles Puyol, Pablo Ibanez and Sergio Ramos in defence. 

The players practised one-touch passing and tested their shooting against goalkeeper Iker Casillas in Spains last training session before leaving its World Cup camp for Wednesdays match in Leipzig. 

Spain is favoured to win group H, which also includes Tunisia and Saudi Arabia.

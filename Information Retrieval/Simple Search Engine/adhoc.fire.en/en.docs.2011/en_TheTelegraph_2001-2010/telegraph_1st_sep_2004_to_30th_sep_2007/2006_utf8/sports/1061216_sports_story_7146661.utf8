The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pinki echoes Soma sentiments

 - Athlete too considers quitting Bengal 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Pinki Pramanik 

 Doha: After Soma 

 Biswas, it is the turn of Pinki Paramanik to give a serious 

 thought to quitting Bengal. 

Pinki, who won the gold in the 4x400m relay, said on Friday that she too is seriously thinking about representing some other state in the national championships. 

Echoing Somas sentiments, Pinki said: We are not aptly rewarded back in Bengal for our achievements. I have heard that Soma didi (Biswas) is talking about going over to Assam. 

 It is not a bad decision. Back 

 in Bengal we dont receive much financial support for 

 our achievements. 

Asked whether she will take any offers from Assam, Pinki said it depends on the offer. If it is good, then what is the harm in winning medals for them? But, I wont do anything without talking to the officials back in Calcutta. 

 The Bengal athlete, who narrowly missed a medal in the 400m and then created a controversy, saying the Athletics Federation of India (AFI) acted partially by not sending her entry for the 800m, spoke in a different tone on Friday. 

For the world championships next year, I will concentrate on the 400m event, she said. The AFI officials told us that the camp for the world meet will begin in January in Delhi. 

Asked why she has been forfeiting her favourite event, Pinki said she would love to take part in 800m as well, but in the world championships, she would be eligible for participating in only one event other than the relay. 

Despite top show in the relay, Pinki is yet to recover from the shock of getting beaten in the 400m. 

 I was sure of a medal, but it slipped away from 

 my hands. I was quite upset, but Soma didi told me 

 not to feel bad. Dont forget, you have an Asian 

 Games gold under your belt, she told me before leaving 

 for Calcutta.

 Eddie Barlow passes away

Charles Randall

Eddie Barlow died in Jersey on Friday, at the age of 65. 

A superb allrounder and an ebullient leader, his Test career with a top-rate South Africa side was limited by the apartheid curtain to 30 caps, plus five for Rest of the World in 1970, in the series that replaced the cancelled Springbok tour of England. 

His nickname of Bunter Barlow alluded to his round face and glasses, but he had the fine physique of a pugnacious crowd-pleasing allrounder. 

Nearly every team he played for ? including Transvaal, Eastern and Western Province, a side during the Kerry Packer series, and Derbyshire ? were lifted by his energy. 

Barlow received the highest sporting awards in South Africa, but his playing and coaching careers at the highest level were guillotined by events outside his control. 

As a coach he made his name at Free State and in two English summers sowed the seeds for Gloucestershires amazingly successful one-day era. He was hauling Bangladesh towards Test status as national coach when he suffered a stroke in 2000 after less than two years in the job. Typically, he was relishing this last great challenge to overturn odds stacked against him in Dhaka. Over a cold beer he once recounted the enormity of his task with Bangladesh. There was no first-class structure in place and the pitches were dead, but he had to deal with more than that. 

Somehow I have to change their whole family lifestyle, he chuckled. One lap of the field at the start of morning practice and my players are throwing up undigested late-night curries. 

For South Africa he averaged 45.75 (2,561 runs) with the bat in the middle-order, took 40 wickets and held 35 catches, mostly at slip, with flypaper hands. Interestingly, during the Rest of the World Series in England his captain, Gary Sobers, gave him high exposure as opening batsman and early change bowler.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Easy victory for Md. Sp.

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: When there is a hill to climb, dont think that waiting will make it smaller so goes an adage and it can easily encapsulate Mohammedan Sportings 3-0 win over Eastern Railway in the Sahara CFL Premier Division at Barasat on Monday. 

Mike Okoro scored a brace and Man-of-the-Match Jamir Ali Mondal added another as Subhas Bhowmicks side notched up their biggest margin of victory so far. But sadly, it bears very little significance now as the team, once sitting pretty on the leaderboard, is out of the title contention. 

After 11 matches, Mohammedan Sporting are now on 19 points, while Eastern Railway are struggling to avoid relegation with 10 points. 

Mike Okoro returned to scoring ways he is, in fact, top-scorer now with 7 goals, one better than Mohun Bagans Dipendu Biswas, Jamir Ali was inspirational on the right wing, mobility in the midfield was also in evidence. 

A blunder from goalkeeper Tapan Karmakar handed Mohammedan Sporting a first-minute lead, when his attempted clearance got deflected off Okoro, allowing the Nigerian to follow the ball and snap it up from close. 

Bhowmick brought in Jamir Ali as the replacement of Amjad Hussain in the 28th minute and since then, his inspirational wing-play gave his team clear edge over Eastern Railway. 

Okoro set up the second goal when his exquisite back-heel following a pass from Noel Wilson set Jamir Ali free as the rival defence was standing on a parallel line. Jamir Ali advanced and beat the goalkeeper hands down with high volley. 

Their roles were reversed in case of the third goal when the right winger loped up brilliantly and delivered a perfect pass for Okoro to push in from close.

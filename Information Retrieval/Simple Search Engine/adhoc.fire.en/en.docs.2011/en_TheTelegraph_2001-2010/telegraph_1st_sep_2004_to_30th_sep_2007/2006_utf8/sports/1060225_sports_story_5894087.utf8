 Air India say no to re-match 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Surprised by the AIFFs decision for a replay of the National League match against Fransa, Air India have refused to take it lying down. 

In a letter to AIFF on Friday, the Mumbai outfit said they refuse to play the re-match on March 2 in Margao and demanded they receive a walk over. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Mumbai, the president of the Air India Sports Control Board V.A. Ferreira said: We are hurt by the AIFF decision. We have written to the federation demanding justice. According AIFF guidelines and article No. 83 of NFL rules, Air India should be awarded three points and three goals. 

On Thursday, AIFF decided that Fransa be allowed to play in the NFL and the Goan team would start their campaign from the fifth round match against Air India. 

Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said: We have pointed it out that in 1998-99 season, Churchill were fined Rs. 50,000 when they refused to field their team against East Bengal in the NFL. East Bengal then were awarded 3 points. Why should we be denied this time? 

Meanwhile, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco said: The whole day I was busy in the meeting. I havent yet seen the letter. We have fixed the match for March 2. If they (Air India) do not play, then we will see what is to be done.

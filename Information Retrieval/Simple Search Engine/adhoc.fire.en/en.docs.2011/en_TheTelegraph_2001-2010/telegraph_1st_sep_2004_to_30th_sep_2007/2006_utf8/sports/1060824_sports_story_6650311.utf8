 Juventus may face more penalties

Rome: The Italian soccer federation is prepared to open further disciplinary proceedings against Juventus if the club appeals its sentence in a match-fixing scandal to an ordinary court. 

Fifa has warned the federation that it is prepared to ban world champions Italy and all Italian clubs from international play if the federation does not prevent Juventus from such action. 

Juventus announced after a board meeting on Monday that theyr planned to appeal to an administrative court in Rome. 

A ruling on July 14 by the FIGC stripped Juventus of their last two Serie A titles and relegated the Turin powerhouse to second division.

 Walcott: Im shocked 

London: Theo Walcott had booked a driving test and a family holiday in June before his surprise national call-up which could make him the youngest player to pull on an England shirt. 

The 17-year-old Arsenal striker, who has yet to play a Premier League match, said on Tuesday he had been shocked and amazed when his father told him the news he was going to Germany instead. 

I didnt think it was true. I was shocked. My eyes were coming out of my head. I cant believe this, Walcott said. The biggest thing was Arsenal and now this is incredible. 

The driving test was due in June... and I was going on holiday with the family. We cancelled it. Its no big deal, he said. Ive been to big stadiums ? the Bernabeu when I was itching to get on ? its not going to get bigger than that really, he said. (Reuters)

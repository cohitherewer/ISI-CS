 Souravs time up: Wadekar

Mumbai: Ajit Wadekar has said time is up for Sourav Ganguly. The former captain, coach and chief selector said even if Sourav was picked for the Test series against England, it would only be a stop-gap arrangement and the ex-skipper must realise that his days as an international cricketer were over. 

There is no harm (in Sourav being included in the side) but the time has come. The Aussies told Steve Waugh when it was time for him to step down. The team is winning without Sourav, its time to tell Sourav thank you very much. This is your last year, Wadekar said. (PTI)

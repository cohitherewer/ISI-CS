 It was like a Hitchcock movie: Klinsmann

 Berlin: Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann saved 

 twice in a shootout to give the hosts a 4-2 win on penalties 

 over Argentina on Friday after their World Cup quarter final 

 had ended 1-1 after extra time. 

 Lehmann saved penalties from Roberto Ayala and Esteban 

 Cambiasso, while Germany scored all four of their spot kicks. 

There were ugly scenes after the shootout with players jostling each other on the pitch. 

It was very exciting for us on the bench, it was like a Hitchcock movie, German coach Juergen Klinsmann said. We always believed that wed come back (from a goal down in normal time). 

Penalties are always the toughest way to go out but we are very proud of this team. Five of them could still play for the under-21s and theyre backed by fantastic older players. 

Paying tribute to Lehmann, he added: We have a very strong belief in Jens Lehmann when it comes to penalties ? he proved he had the sense of where the ball will go. 

The keeper said: To win the quarter final is fantastic for us. We had super shots (in the penalty shootout). And its just expected that a German goalkeeper makes the saves. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack said the hosts deserved to win. 

That was sensational, said playmaker Ballack.The match was maybe not so interesting for spectators but it was a match at a very high level. The team fought to the end. 

Of course, theres always luck when it comes to penalties but I think the team really deserved to win. 

Referring to Argentinas opening goal by Ayala after 49 minutes Ballack added: It was their first chance on that set piece. We knew how theyd do their set pieces. It was a super header from him but our team fought back hard and scored a beautiful goal. 

Were on a good run at the moment. Since the start of the World Cup weve done very well and played at a very high level with very few mistakes, said Ballack. 

 Ayala had put Argentina ahead with a flying header 

 four minutes into the second half and the South Americans 

 looked comfortable until goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri 

 was forced off with an injury in the 71st minute. Germany 

 threw on Tim Borowski and his intervention led to the Germany 

 equaliser with 10 minutes left of normal time.

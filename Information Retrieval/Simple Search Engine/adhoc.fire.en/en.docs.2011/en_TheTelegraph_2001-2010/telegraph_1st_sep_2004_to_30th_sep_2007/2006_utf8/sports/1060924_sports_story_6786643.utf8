The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 County cricket has made me a better pro: Dinesh Mongia 

 - Im sure my performance on Friday is going to hold me in good stead in the Champions Trophy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Dinesh Mongia 

Kuala Lumpur: Fridays semi-final against Australia was Dinesh Mongias first Team India appearance after 17 months. Yet, there were no nerves and he ended up being the highest scorer (63 not out) on either side. Hed bowled well, too. Mongia spoke to The Telegraph at the team hotel (Traders) on the morning-after. 

The following are excerpt 

On his comeback 

You cant image the thrill of again wearing the 

India blue... Believe me, its difficult describing the emotions... 

On whether he had the time to mentally prepare 

Yes, as I was told in advance. 

On top-scoring (and making an impact with the ball) 

in his comeback match 

Obviously, on a personal level, I feel nice... The 

innings is definitely going to lift my confidence... However, its disappointing 

we couldnt win... We should have made 214... It hurts... 

On what went wrong 

We didnt have enough partnerships... While chasing 

a modest total, usually, a couple of them are enough. That wasnt to be, 

as we got only one 50-plus partnership (for the sixth-wicket, between him and 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni)... Wahi gadbad ho gaya. 

On his thoughts when he took guard (47 for three 

in the 13th over) 

That I had to stay till the end... If I did that, 

and got support, victory would be Indias as the asking rate was small. 

On whether captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg 

Chappell had anything to say after the match 

(Enthusiastically) They were appreciative. 

On facing a charged-up Brett Lee and the wily Glenn 

McGrath 

Well, Ive faced them before... I didnt 

feel as if Lee was often bowling at over 90 mph. 

On what kept him going in the last 17 months 

The desire to again wear the India blue... Thats 

motivation enough. 

On his experience with Leicestershire, for whom 

he played both in 2005 and this summer 

Ive learnt a lot... Learnt to shoulder more 

responsibility... County cricket has made me a better professional... In fact, 

playing for Lancashire (before Leicestershire) also helped... Exposure in both 

Counties has lifted my self-belief... I mean, if you dont believe 

in yourself, why will others have faith in you? 

On his approach 

I enjoy the game... I dont complicate things 

and dont neglect my bowling. 

On looking the fittest he ever has 

(Laughs) Dont have a choice! 

On the Champions Trophy 

Im sure my performance yesterday is going to 

hold me in good stead... Playing at home will be nice. 

Finally, on who is going to win Sundays final 

I wont say Australia start favourites... One-day 

cricket is such that playing well on the given day matters most. Not records, 

not reputations...

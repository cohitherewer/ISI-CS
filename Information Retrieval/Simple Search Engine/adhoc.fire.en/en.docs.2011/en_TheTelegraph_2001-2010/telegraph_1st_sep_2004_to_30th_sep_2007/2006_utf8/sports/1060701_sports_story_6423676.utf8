The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pride, ambition and revenge at stake

 - Scolari vague about Cristiano Ronaldos availability 

 Rooney 

Baden-Baden: Sven-Goran Eriksson gets his last chance as England coach to outsmart Luiz Felipe Scolari in Saturdays World Cup quarter final with Portugal in Gelsenkirchen after twice coming off second best. 

For Englands players, it is a chance to reach their first World Cup semi-final since Italia 90 and settle a score with Scolaris men. 

Eriksson, who leaves his job after the finals, wants to avoid a hattrick of tournament defeats by Scolari, who also masterminded his native Brazils quarter-final win over England at the 2002 World Cup. 

Scolari will also have his own agenda, having decided two months ago to break off talks with the Football Association about succeeding Eriksson in the England job. 

Playmaker Deco and holding player Costinha will miss out on Saturday after red cards in a tumultuous second-round win over The Netherlands. 

As if the match needed any extra spice, England forward Wayne Rooney will face Portugal two years after limping out of that Euro 2004 game in Lisbon with a broken bone in his foot. This time, Rooney broke his foot well in advance of Saturdays game and should last 90 minutes, if not longer. 

With England needing to break up Portugals flowing, possession football, Eriksson is expected to prefer the rasping tackles of Owen Hargreaves in the holding role. 

Midfielder Frank Lampard will play after shaking off a twisted ankle, Eriksson said on Friday 

Decos duties should pass to Luis Figo, who famously ripped Englands defence to shreds in Portugals 3-2 victory at Euro 2000 after they trailed 0-2. 

Scolari will hope Rooneys Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo recovers from a thigh injury and he could be deployed on the left flank where he would face United colleague Gary Neville, due to return at right back after a calf injury. 

Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Scolari was typically vague about whether the winger, who missed training on Friday, would play the match. He may play, he may not. I know, I dont know. I have no idea if he will be able to play or not, he said. 

Spokesman Afonso Melo said Ronaldo was still not totally fit. If hes not 100 percent fit, Scolari wont play him, he said. 

Meanwhile in Berlin, Fifa spokesman Markus Siegler said on Friday that England will play Portugal under a closed roof at the AufShchalke.

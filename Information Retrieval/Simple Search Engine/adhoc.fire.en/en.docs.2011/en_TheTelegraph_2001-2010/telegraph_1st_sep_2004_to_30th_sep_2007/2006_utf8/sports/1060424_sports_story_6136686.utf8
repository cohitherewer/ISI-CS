The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bryan Robson wants Beckham replaced as England leader

 - Gerrard and Terry have the aggression most managers like in a captain 

 Bryan Robson 

 London: Former England 

 captain and West Brom manager Bryan Robson claimed on Sunday 

 that Real Madrid star David Beckham was too weak to captain 

 the national side and should be replaced for the World Cup. 

Robson believes that 30-year-old is not a natural leader and that Chelseas John Terry or Liverpools Steven Gerrard would do a better job. 

In his autobiography serialised in the a British Sunday paper, Robson said: As for the England captaincy, David Beckham would not have been my choice. He hasnt done a bad job and he has matured, but hes not a natural leader on the pitch. 

Steven Gerrard and John Terry are more natural leaders and have the aggression that most managers like in a captain. To my mind, Terry, who is also the Chelsea skipper, has probably edged ahead of Gerrard as the best choice.

He leads by example, is an excellent organiser and has the presence that everyone in the team will respect. He also scores goals which is a great bonus for a defender. 

Robson also believes an Englishman should be appointed to manage the national team following the departure of Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

I would have no great objection to the appointment of a foreign manager if we had no Englishman good enough to do the job of managing the national team, but I believe we have coaches who are more than capable. 

 You dont get too many leading football 

 nations who employ a foreign manager and the FAs decision 

 (to appoint Eriksson) was a bit of a slap in the face of 

 our lads, he said.

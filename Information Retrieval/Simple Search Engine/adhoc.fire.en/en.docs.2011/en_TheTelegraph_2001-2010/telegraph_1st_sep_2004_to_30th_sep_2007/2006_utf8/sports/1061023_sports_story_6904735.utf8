OUR CORRESPONDENT

Jamshedpur: Fine half-centuries by Saikat Roy and Rohit Singh helped Jharkhand hold Bengal in the under-22 East Zone League tie for Col CK Nayudu Trophy on the concluding day at Keenan Stadium on Sunday. By virtue of 209-run first innings lead, Bengal bagged two points while the hosts drew a blank. 

Stakes were loaded heavily against Jharkhand who had to play to save the match. Roy, who scored 50 (101 balls, 8x4), anchored the innings with selective shots. The Jamshedpur-based southpaw batted with lots of authority and added 74 runs for the first wicket with Abhishek Moitra.

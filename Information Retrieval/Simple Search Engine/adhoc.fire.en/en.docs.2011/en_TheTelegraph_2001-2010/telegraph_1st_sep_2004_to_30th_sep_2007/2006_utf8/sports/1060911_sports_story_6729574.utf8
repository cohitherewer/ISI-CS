 FIA wants Schumi to win title: Renault

Monza: Renault team boss Flavio Briatore compared Formula One to Italian soccers match-fixing scandal and said that the outcome of the championship had been decided around a table. 

Briatores comments on Italian TV followed Renaults world champion Fernando Alonso declaring that Formula One was no longer a sport. 

Stewards at the Italian Grand Prix demoted Alonso five places on the starting grid after he was ruled to have impeded Ferraris Felipe Massa during Saturdays qualifying. 

What happened on Sunday isnt the problem, said Briatore. It is what happened before the race which is strange. This is a world championship which has already been decided at the table. 

We have understood how things go it has all been decided... They have decided to give the world championship to Schumacher and that is what will be, he said on Italys RAI TV channel. 

Compared to what is happening in Formula One, calciopoli just makes me smile, added Briatore, referring to the soccer scandal in Italy. 

His comments drew swift responses from Ferrari and FIA, the governing body. 

While I accept that there are people who talk about Ferrari from time to time, there is someone who talks too much and who missed a good opportunity to stay quiet, said Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo. In life you need to have a little bit of class and so I prefer not to respond, he added. 

An FIA spokesman said: The comments attributed to the Renault team principal have been noted by the FIA and are under consideration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tragedy of hockey may be repeated in tennis

There was a sigh of relief when Paes, stepping into the breach, clinched the fifth match against Pakistan in the recent Davis Cup tie in Mumbai. 

The revelry, which followed, celebrated victory over Pakistan and in no less measure our continued presence in Group I of the Asia/Oceanic Zone. The rising standards in Asian countries such as Thailand, Chinese Taipei, Korea and Japan and the decline in our standards have brought Indian domination of Asian tennis to an end. 

Now, even Indias presence in Group I of the Asia/Oceanic Zone is under threat. 

For more than a decade, Paes and Bhupathi have been the high-profile masks of Indian Tennis, hiding the reality of a void of high calibre younger players. Prakash Amritraj, Rohan Bopanna, Harsh Mankad have not been able to fulfil their earlier promise, and make any impact internationally. 

Cyclical rise and fall in standards is inevitable and understandable, but Indian tennis seems to be trapped in quicksand with no hope of rescue. Leander had said his last hurrah in Davis Cup singles. 

His presence in doubles with Bhupathi for another 2-3 years is a comforting factor, but will not be enough unless our youngsters can win two of the remaining four singles in our Davis Cup ties. 

This seems a most daunting task as at present only Karan Rastogi, the 20-year-old fifth member of the Davis Cup team, seems to be the lone prospect. There may be a few more but they will take at least 3-4 years to mature. What are the reasons for this drought? 

Strong family backing was the mainstay of the development of Indian greats such as Ramanathan Krishnan, Vijay Amritraj, Ramesh Krishnan, Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes. 

But now the elevated levels of skill in the game have gone far beyond the range of parental support, both financially and technically. Each aspect of the game requires specialist inputs. Margins in standards are paper thin and talent must be honed razor sharp. 

Many academies have come up all over India and hundreds of boys and girls are playing at these centres. Akhtar Ali, who runs one at the Calcutta South Club, has almost 200 trainees playing tennis, says that not even a handful play seriously. 

The good ones in the 16-18 age group want to use their proficiency in tennis as a route for admission and scholarships to American Universities, others for jobs in public and private sector companies in India. 

At other centres, one is told, some trainees, after achieving a fair standard, aspire to do private coaching, which is highly lucrative in places like Mumbai. Some coaches can earn more than successful doctors and accountants. 

Totally, In India, there may only be dozen or more youngsters seriously aspiring for stardom. The majority of pupils at the academies consist of children from affluent homes swinging a racket for show and exercise. 

However, the existing system and academies is throwing up quite a few promising youngsters in the 14-18 group. Owing to high costs and inadequate financial support there are many drop outs, leaving a struggling handful who run from pillar to post to obtain help from sponsors. 

There is no magic formula for improving standards and producing top class players. But who can contest that more courts, more coaches, more money and more domestic competition will build a much-needed broader base and improve Indian tennis? 

Domestic tournaments, restricted to Indian players, should have attractive prize money so that instead of receiving struggling subsistence level payouts, youngsters can look at making a good respectable living round the year. This will spur the left-outs from the elite schemes and allow them to persist in their efforts. Talent spotters are often wrong and many a time discards make good. 

The AITA initiative of arranging Challenger and Future tournaments is laudable. Results in these tournaments help players to collect points and move up the ATP rankings and play in higher level tournaments. 

There has been an influx of tough, hungry players from all over the world, who, in spite of the difficult foreign conditions, proved to be better than our group of youngsters. They picked up our money and more importantly valuable ATP Points. To counter this, we need to develop and sharpen the existing talent and improve their standard by intense competitive domestic exposure. 

For one who has been a part of our glorious record in the Davis Cup, it is sad for me to see the continuous decline in Indian standards. 

There is no instant solution. Our efforts should multiply and be aligned both technically and financially with international norms. 

Without this it would be unfair to expect our youngsters to attain international standards. Besides what I have stated earlier, about having more courts and coaches, it would help greatly if a residential academy for outstanding talent, attached to a school, is set up. 

The BAT academy at Chennai run by the Amritraj family would be a good model to follow ? it produced Leander Paes and many other good players for India. 

In the short term three or four of our very best youngsters should be selected and inducted into a junior Davis Cup squad with a development program in consultation with the best available expertise in the world. 

If we do not mobilise our resources, the tragedy of Indian hockey will be repeated in our tennis world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bob Houghton stays positive 

 - Bhaichung wants to make amends in return leg versus Saudi Arabia 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Chief national coach Bob Houghton on Saturday said that the Asian Cup qualifiers match against Saudi Arabia on Wednesday could prove to be Indias biggest test on foreign soil in recent time. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on his arrival in the capital with the team, the Englishman insisted that he would be leaving for Saudi Arabia on Sunday morning with a positive frame of mind, but warned that the Saudis could be a tough nut to crack on their home soil. 

I know people would expect us to do something better than we did in our home match against Saudi Arabia in Calcutta, Houghton said. They have the right to expect as my boys fought gallantly in Calcutta. But we need to do something much better than that to leave a mark in Saudi Arabia. In Calcutta, Saudi Arabia beat India 3-0 despite some good performance by the home team. 

Houghton, who had coached quite a few Saudi Arabian club teams before coming to India, said beating Saudis at home is a dream result for any team in the world. No doubt we are going to Saudi Arabia with an ambition to win the match since thats the reason football is played for, but to achieve that you have to perform something extraordinary. Frankly, I dont remember when the last time a visiting team had beaten Saudis on their home ground, Houghton said. 

Houghton also said that he was satisfied with the preparations of the team in the Goa camp. Yes, we do miss a few players because of injury and some players could only join the camp late because of their domestic commitments, but thats part of the game. You have to take all these things in your stride and perform. I know my boys are going in the right direction and something positive will come out of it, the 58-year-old coach said. 

Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia said he would like to go for a win, but the teams strategy will only depend on the situation. We had been working very hard under the chief coach for the past few days and I am sure it will reflect on our performance, Bhutia said. 

Injuries to key players, Bhutia said has been upsetting the game plan of the Indian team at times. First we lost Mahesh Gawli and now we wont be able to avail the services of Venkatesh in the midfield. Venkatesh has been one of our main functionaries in the middle for quite sometime now. He is highly skilful and experienced. His absence is certainly a setback, but the new boys in line will not disappoint. 

Talking on his personal aim for the match, Bhutia said like any other striker, he would like to find the net against the Saudis. In Calcutta, I had a chance but I failed to capitalise on it. There is a lot of difference when the ball travels inches outside the goal post than inside. In Saudi Arabia, my aim will be to make the ball travel inside. 

Meanwhile, Saudi striker Yasser Al Qahtani, who sunk India with a hattrick in Calcutta in the first-leg, has been ruled out of the Jeddah match due to injury. 

The Al Hilal forward injured his abdomen during Saudi Arabias recent friendly against United Arab Emirates and will be out of action for three weeks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Power play concept welcomed 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The opening day of the P. Sen Trophy saw the introduction of power play in a CAB-organised tournament. The move is being welcomed from all quarters, and Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta feels the young players will benefit from it. 

This is expected to do a world of good to the youngsters. The experience will help them during the National one-day meet next season. It is a great opportunity for them, said Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta, who plays for Kalighat. 

For umpire Shakti Bhattacharya, who officiated at the Eden, the experience was unique and satisfying, too. There was no problem as such. It was so well defined in the rules. We also had an interactive session among ourselves before actually putting it into practice. 

Shambazars Debabrata Das, who played in the U-19 World Cup, felt it was a great learning experience. It helps in developing temperament and getting accustomed to various match situations. 

 Dinda hattrick 

Manoj Tewari hit 133 and Asok Dinda picked up four wickets, including a hattrick as Kalighat beat CAB Presidents XI by 125 runs.

 We would never have forfeited: Buchanan

Melbourne: Australia coach John Buchanan has disapproved of Pakistans forfeiture of The Oval Test to England, saying his side would never do it even if they get embroiled in any controversial situation. 

We have never done it in the past and I cant see any reason why would want to do it in the future, Buchanan said. 

We play the game pretty aggressively but I think we always play it within the rules and the spirit of the game. So I dont think that would be part of what wed be wanting to do, if theyre the alleged facts, he said. 

Buchanan hoped that the ICC resolved the stand-off between Pakistan and Darrell Hair sooner than later. I dont think it would do cricket any good, and it obviously needs to be resolved and a way forward be found, he said. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting echoed Buchanans opinion, saying he couldnt envisage leading his team off the field over an umpiring decision. 

Ponting said Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq may not be the only person to blame and Bob Woolmer and team manager Zaheer Abbas may have triggered the protest. 

 Who knows how Id handle 

 it and how the Australian cricket team would handle it in 

 that situation, but I think wed do the right thing 

 by the game and by everybody concerned, Ponting said.

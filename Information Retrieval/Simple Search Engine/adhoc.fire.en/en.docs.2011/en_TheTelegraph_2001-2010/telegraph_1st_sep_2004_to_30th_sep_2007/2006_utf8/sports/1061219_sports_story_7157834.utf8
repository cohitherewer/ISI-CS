The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav showed the way to teammates...

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Johannesburg: Allrounder Neil Johnson was one of the unsung heroes of the 1999 World Cup. Turning out for Zimbabwe, he collected three MoM awards, but quit a year later as he couldnt live in Robert Mugabes country. Now based in Cape Town and busy with Media work, he talked to The Telegraph after Indias historic victory. 

The following are excerpts 

On the result 

I didnt expect it, not after the way India performed in the ODIs... Rahul Dravid showed courage in choosing to bat... He backed his batsmen... 

On his pre-Test series expectations 

Saw South Africa as the favourites... With the ball bouncing around, one expected the Indians to struggle... Id never imagined India would come up with a seam attack to bowl South Africa out for 84 (first innings)... For me, at least, it was a revelation. 

On what made the biggest difference 

The way Sourav Ganguly, who was supposed to be suspect against the rising ball, batted in the first innings... Under pressure, his performance encouraged others... Basically, he showed the way to teammates... His comeback has proved that nobody ought to be written off... Then, obviously, Sreesanths bowling... He has the ability to swing the ball at good pace from the right area. Its a real asset and I would give him very high marks. (Adds laughing) Seems to be a crazy guy... I mean, hes quite a character. 

On his stand-out memory 

The 44-run partnership for the last-wicket (in innings No. 1) between Sourav and young (V.R.V.) Singh... The youngsters 29, in my opinion, changed the game. 

On what should now be done by South Africa 

Simple: Get some discipline back. 

Finally, on what to expect in the last two Tests 

I visualise a green, seaming track in Durban... Being down in the series, South Africa have to put on a much improved display... Despite todays result, the remainder of the series may be very well contested.

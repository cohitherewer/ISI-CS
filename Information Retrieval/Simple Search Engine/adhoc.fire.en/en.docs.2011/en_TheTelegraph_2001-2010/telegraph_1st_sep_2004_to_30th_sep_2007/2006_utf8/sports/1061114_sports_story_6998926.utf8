Calcutta: Aakash Chopra and Ravneet Ricky hogged the limelight on the second day of the Duleep Trophy final at the Eden. Chopra remained unbeaten with a sound 135 while Ricky hit 122 to steer North Zone to 321 for two on Monday. North Zone are ahead by 25 runs with eight wickets in hand. 

The day didnt start well for the North Zone as they lost in-form Gautam Gambhir to the second ball of the day. Gambhir, who was batting on seven, returned on the same score. 

A harmless delivery that pitched on the off-stump and was going further was dragged on to the stumps by Gambhir, who tried to play it away from the body. 

After that it was left to Chopra who scored his first first-class century since 2003 and Punjab opener Ricky to steer the home side towards a big total by stumps on Day II. 

Chopra played a chanceless innings. His 135 included 18 hits to the fence, each one with sheer elegance and timing. When Chopra drove Rangana Herath through the covers after lunch, it was something that will remain etched in memory. 

On the other hand, Ricky innings included only one boundary. With Chopra looking in great touch, Ricky played the sheet anchors role to perfection. Rickys dismissal was a result of lapse in concentration. Trying to drive through covers, Ricky played it away from the body. The ball took a thin edge and Sri Lankan captain Thilan Samaraweera made no mistake in taking a regulation catch at first slip off Amarasinghe. 

The Sri Lankan mediumpacer had been given the second new ball only a couple of overs back. 

Chopra scored his last century in 2003 against the touring New Zealand side while Ricky amassed 12th first-class hundred. 

The hapless Sri Lankans had no clue to Chopra-Rickys authoritative show in the middle for more than five hours. With no options left, Herath started straying on the leg-side to curb the boundaries. That ploy didnt work as Chopra, who read the wicket very well, used his pads. 

Chopra, who was dropped from the zonal side, was given the chance on the DDCA selectors insistence. As a result, Ricky who usually opens for Punjab was left to bat at No. 3. 

Eyeing a better show on Day III, Sri Lankan selector Don Anurasiri, who is accompanying the side took the left-arm spinner to former India spinner Maninder Singh to hone the skills further after the days proceedings.

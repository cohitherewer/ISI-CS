 Narain had concentration lapses: Burgess

New Delhi: Midland Formula One team have justified their decision to discontinue the services of Narain Karthikeyan and retaining his teammate Tiago Monteiro, saying the Portugese was a real professional. 

He (Narain) would have occasional lapses in concentration, whereas Tiago wouldnt, said sporting director Adrian Burgess. 

Burgess said Karthikeyan was faster in qualifyings but that result did not reflect in the races. He (Monteiro) likes to get some miles under his belt before he goes all out, while Narain just gets into the car and drives quick straightaway. 

Meanwhile, Monteiro said it was the Indians bad luck that he lagged behind him on the racing tracks despite the two being at par. (PTI)

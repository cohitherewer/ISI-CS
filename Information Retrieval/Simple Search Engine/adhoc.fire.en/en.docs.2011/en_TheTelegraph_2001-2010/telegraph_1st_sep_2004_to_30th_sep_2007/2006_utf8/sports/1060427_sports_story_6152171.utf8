 Quick Takes

 Kaiser hoping for clean matches

 Berlin: Diving 

 and playacting are tarnishing the reputation of the Bundesliga, 

 Franz Beckenbauer said on Wednesday. We used to always 

 complain that the Italians were actors, Beckenbauer, 

 who won the World Cup as West Germany captain in 1974 and 

 coach in 1990, told a German newspaper. But they were 

 heroes compared to our league now.

 There have been a number of ugly 

 incidents in the Bundesliga this season involving players, 

 and even coaches, falling to the ground and feigning injury 

 to influence referee decisions when replays showed they 

 were hardly even touched.

 The image of the league 

 is just terrible, said Beckenbauer, a Bayern Munich 

 executive and Germanys World Cup organising committee 

 president. I just hope that well have clean 

 matches at the World Cup. 

 Cahill out for six weeks

 London: Australia midfielder 

 Tim Cahills faces a battle to be fit for the start 

 of the World Cup finals after a scan confirmed that a knee 

 injury will sideline him for six weeks, his club Everton 

 said on Wednesday. Cahill, 26, suffered ligament damage 

 to his left knee after colliding with Birmingham Citys 

 Damien Johnson in Saturdays Premier League game.

 Australia, making their first 

 appearance at the World Cup in 32 years, play Japan on June 

 12 in their opening Group F fixture in Germany. The Socceroos 

 then face world champions Brazil on June 18 and Croatia 

 on June 22. 

 Tickets in vaults

 Frankfurt: A travel agent 

 has deposited 12,000 World Cup tickets for Brazil matches 

 in a vault in a German bank for safe keeping until their 

 owners arrive for the tournament that starts on June 9. 

 The coveted tickets, which were transported in an armoured 

 car to Cologne, will be kept in the vault of Sparkasse savings 

 bank. 

 They belong to fans who booked 

 their World Cup travel and tickets through a Brazilian tour 

 operator. The fans, who will be based in Cologne, will receive 

 their tickets upon arrival in Germany.

 Pernia available

 Madrid: Getafes Argentine 

 defender Mariano Pernia is available for selection by Spain 

 coach Luis Aragones after securing dual nationality on Wednesday. 

 It is a big day for me because I wanted Spanish citizenship. 

 Dual nationality opens doors for me with a view to getting 

 to the World Cup, Pernia told the Getafe website.

 A little too late

 London: Pascal Chimbonda 

 believes Wigans being named in the Professional Footballers 

 Associations Team of the Year has come too late to 

 land him a place in France coach Raymond Domenechs 

 squad. 

 Chimbonda said: I have not 

 given up hope. The window is still open, but the manager 

 tends to look at the bigger players at the bigger clubs.

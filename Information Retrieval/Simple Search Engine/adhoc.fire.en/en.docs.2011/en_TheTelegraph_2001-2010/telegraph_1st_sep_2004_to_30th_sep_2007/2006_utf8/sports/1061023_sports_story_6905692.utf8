 Manchester see off Liverpool

London: Paul Scholes celebrated his 500th game for Manchester United in style by scoring the opener in a convincing 2-0 victory over old rivals Liverpool at Old Trafford on Sunday. 

Scholes, Manchester-born and a product of the United youth system, steered home from close range in the 39th minute to mark a milestone match in the 31-year-olds United career. 

England defender Rio Ferdinand scored a rare goal in the 66th minute, superbly bringing down a high ball with his right foot and then driving beyond keeper Jose Reina with his left. 

Victory propelled United back to the top of the Premier League on goal difference ahead of champions Chelsea, who beat Portsmouth 2-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. 

Defeat for Liverpool all but killed off their hopes of mounting a title challenge. They are already 11 points adrift of the leaders and remain mired in mid-table. 

They deserved no more than they got on Sunday, proving unable to upset a dominant United performance. 

Scholes can only have dreamed of being on the scoresheet as he became the ninth United player to reach the 500-game milestone, joining teammates on the day Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs. 

His team applied all the early pressure, but despite the enthusiasm of Louis Saha, who tried his luck with an angled shot, and strike partner Wayne Rooney, who just failed to get on the end a through-ball, there were no clearcut chances.

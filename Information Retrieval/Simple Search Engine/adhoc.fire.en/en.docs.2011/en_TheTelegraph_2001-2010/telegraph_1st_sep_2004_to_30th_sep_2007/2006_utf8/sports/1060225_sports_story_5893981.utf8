The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav should meet the selectors

Former captain Sourav Ganguly must sort out his standing with the Indian team. The news of Ganguly being dropped is hitting the headlines too often. It does not do any good to his cricket as well to Indian cricket. 

A senior player like him should meet the selectors and few senior cricketers to get a good picture on his utility to the side. He cannot be treated like Gautam Gambhir, who could be dropped disdainfully and picked at the same time. 

If Sourav should be matured enough and meet the people concerned, the decision makers should also come out saying how much cricket is left in him. The whole thing is leaving a bad taste in the mouth. 

We need to take a leaf out of Australian and English cricket to know how to handle such issues. 

Selection of Indian squad for the first Test against England did not throw up any surprise. Ajit Agarkar and Zaheer Khan were obviously overlooked to accommodate youngsters like Sreesanth and Vikram Rajvir Singh. In my opinion, the only way for Zaheer to get back in the team is to bowl at an average speed of 135 kmph. 

Though Munaf Patel may consider himself a bit unlucky, VRV could be the answer for Indian pace requirements. Six-and-half foot tall, he possesses all the ingredients of a true fast bowler. Since spinners usually call the shots here, it would be interesting to see who partners Irfan Pathan with the new ball against England. 

England continue to enjoy the status of heavyweights in the forthcoming series against India. They earned this status after winning the Ashes in the home series last summer. 

At the back drop of that colossal win, which was a hard-earned and deserving one, the defeat in Pakistan could be construed as Englishmens irrational fear of many things on the Pakistan soil. England, while analysing the new hosts, would consider Indias recent mixed results in Pakistan as well as their reasonable success in the previous tour of India. 

What perhaps worry England is not their batsmen struggling on Indian wickets but their bowlers inability to contain the home batsmen from scoring huge runs. 

The first casualties on the subcontinent wickets are always the fast bowlers. The hot and humid conditions along with lifeless tracks can make them feel negative and paranoid about things around them.

Madrid: Primera Liga leaders Barcelona had two players sent off during a 1-2 defeat at fourth-placed Osasuna on Sunday. 

The visitors went 1-0 down when Valdo cashed in on a goalkeeping error and Osasuna captain Patxi Punal added a second from the penalty spot after Edmilson was sent off for bringing down Savo Milosevic. 

Substitute Henrik Larsson pulled a goal back 18 minutes from time but could not prevent Barcelona suffering their fourth league defeat of the season. Thiago Motta was also dismissed in injury time for a foul on substitute Pierre Webo. 

Champions Barcelona remain nine points clear of Valencia and Real Madrid, who drew 0-0 at the Mestalla on Saturday after Ronaldo missed a last-minute penalty for the visitors. 

Barcelona have 61 points with 11 games left. Osasuna are on 49, four clear of Celta Vigo who lost 2-0 at Espanyol on Saturday. 

Relegation-threatened Alaves put the brakes on Sevillas drive for a Champions League berth despite having two players sent off in the closing stages of their 2-1 home win over the Andalucians. 

The defeat left Sevilla five points adrift of Osasuna and one ahead of Villarreal, who were held 1-1 at Real Mallorca. 

Osasuna threw down the gauntlet at the Reyno de Navarra Stadium with a high-tempo start and never let Barcelona settle on the ball as they pressed in every area of the pitch. 

Former Real Madrid player Valdo pounced on a blunder by Victor Valdes, hooking the ball into an open goal after the keeper dropped a 19th-minute cross. Osasuna kept up the pressure in the second half and extended their lead through Punal on 59 minutes. 

Larsson scored for Barcelona with a fine first-time shot after Ronaldinho had threaded a marvellous ball through the back four. 

Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao scrambled a 1-0 victory over fellow strugglers Cadiz despite having defender Fernando Amorebieta sent off in the 18th minute. 

Midfielder Tiko scored the winner from the penalty spot deep into stoppage time after Alejandro Varela was red-carded for handling on the line. Six points separate the bottom seven teams with Malaga bringing up the rear on 22 points after their 1-1 draw at Real Betis. 

Cadiz have 25 points with Betis, Alaves and Bilbao all on 26. Mallorca have 27 and Real Sociedad 28. 

Meanwhile, Juventus moved closer to retaining their Serie A title after a goalless draw with 10-man AC Milan in a top of the table clash on Sunday, adds Reuters from Rome. 

Juventus have 74 points from 29 matches, 10 more than Milan, who have just nine matches to reel in the champions. 

Milan, who came into the match following five successive league wins, created more chances to score but were forced back after midfielder Gennaro Gattuso was sent off in the 69th minute for a second bookable offence. 

Asked whether referee Massimo De Santis had made the right decision to send off Gattuso, Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said: I dont know. I was too far away to see properly. Certainly it had an effect on us because it happened at such a crucial point. If wed had him during the last 20 minutes we could have done a lot more. 

The showdown at Turins Stadio delle Alpi began in lively fashion, with a one-two by strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Trezeguet forcing a diving save from Milan keeper Dida. 

At the other end Juventus defender Jonathan Zebina cut out a dangerous low cross by Jaap Stam. 

As the first half wore on, however, it was the visitors who began to apply the pressure. 

Milan winger Serginho controlled an Andrea Pirlo long ball, cut into the area from the left and teed up for Andriy Shevchenko to blast in a shot that was saved by Gianluigi Buffon. 

Playmaker Kaka also exploited Juventus weakness on the left. He dribbled into the area and threaded a pass through the defence to Filippo Inzaghi at the far post but the ball ran behind the 32-year-old striker, who was caught off-balance and sent his shot wide. 

Striker Alessandro Del Piero replaced Ibrahimovic at the restart but he failed change Juventus fortunes. 

Milan continued to dominate, a defence-splitting pass by Kaka almost put Inzaghi through on goal but Buffon reacted quickly. 

Gattusos expulsion following a heavy challenge on Pavel Nedved finally gave Juventus the space they needed to push forward. They came close to scoring in the 75th minute through Nedved but his effort lacked power. 

Fourth-placed Fiorentina stayed on 56 points after their game at Cagliaris SantElia stadium was suspended because of strong winds.

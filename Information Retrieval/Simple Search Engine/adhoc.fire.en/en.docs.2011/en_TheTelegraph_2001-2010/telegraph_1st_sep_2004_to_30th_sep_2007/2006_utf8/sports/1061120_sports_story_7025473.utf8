Johannesburg: Rain washed out the first one-day International between India and South Africa at the Wanderers here Sunday without a ball being bowled. 

Weather, true to predictions, played a cat and mouse game and heavy intermittent rains swept the stadium for much of the day after which umpires Billy Doctrove and Brian Jerling called off the match at around 10 pm IST. 

There were couple of brief moments when it appeared that the day-and-night game might start after the umpires privately suggested that the match could be a 39-over affair. However, the idea had to be abandoned as fresh rain set in. 

There is no reserve day in this series and the second game is scheduled in Kingsmead, Durban, on Wednesday. 

Although the toss wasnt possible, both teams had more or less finalised their XI, with Virender Sehwag the surprise inclusion for India. Sehwag was uncertain after damaging his finger while warming up for the opening match of the tour last Thursday. 

The opener had batted during indoor nets Saturday but a decision on his playing was taken only Sunday morning. 

It was also decided that Anil Kumble would be rested with Harbhajan Singh being the only spinner. India had decided to go in with four bowlers, Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and Sreesanth completing the pace line-up. 

South Africa retained the same team that lost to the West Indies in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-finals in India last month. It meant there was no role for spinner Robin Peterson. 

The Indians were keen to start the one-day series on a bright note, and Rahul Dravid, the captain, and Greg Chappell, the coach, had said as much. However, sitting around in the dressing-room has only made their task harder. 

Indias tour had earlier started on a dismal note with a 37-run loss in their warm-up match against South Africa A. 

For India, it is the third instance that rain has ruined their series in last few months. First the series in Sri Lanka was washed out and then some of the matches were abandoned in Kuala Lumpur. (Agencies)

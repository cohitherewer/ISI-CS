The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We can do without another Constantine

 - Indian assistance a must for foreign coach

 FREE-KICK

 P. K. Banerjeer

 Now that the AIFF has decided 

 to replace Syed Nayeemuddin with a foreigner, I am keeping 

 fingers crossed. In fact, you can say I am praying hard 

 and hoping that the AIFF gets someone of stature and proven 

 pedigree, rather than a foreigner just for the heck of it.

 Even at the peril of sounding 

 familiar, I would like to reiterate that Im not a 

 big supporter of the foreign coach theory. It can still 

 work at the club level where there are three-four foreign 

 players in every side, but to expect a man to fly in from 

 abroad and work wonders with our national team is too far-fetched 

 an idea.

 But since my thoughts arent 

 going to influence the decision-makers, they should at least 

 address some important issues before taking the plunge. 

 Firstly, whoever they bring in to coach the national team 

 will need an Indian assistant to (a) help him understand 

 this vast country and its players coming from varied socio-cultural 

 background and (b) help overcome the language barrier by 

 conveying his ideas and instructions to the players.

 All credit to Biswajit for recreating 

 a healthy, conducive atmosphere

More importantly, the AIFF has 

 to provide better infrastructure and facilities if it expects 

 the foreign coach to give shape to his dreams. Right now, 

 there is no proper planning, not even for the next five-year 

 period. Policies are still being worked out on a trial-and-error 

 basis. Even after having decided to spot and nurture talent 

 in the under-12, under-15, under-17 and under-19 age-groups, 

 precious little has been done to translate theory into action.

 Last but not the least, any foreign 

 coach of some stature will have to be given complete power 

 and freedom. He wont tolerate any kind of interference. 

 To give an example, the Japanese federation wanted to field 

 the under-23 national team in the Asian Cup qualifier against 

 India in Yokohama last month, but Zico would have nothing 

 of it, his argument being that he wouldnt like to 

 experiment in a competitive match months before the World 

 Cup. By putting his foot down, Zico made it abundantly clear 

 that as far as the national team was concerned, he was the 

 boss, not federation officials.

 Has the AIFF given a serious thought 

 to all this? Im not too sure.

 The federation has happily announced 

 that 30 foreign coaches have applied for the India job, 

 including Michel Hidalgo. Anyone with basic football knowledge 

 wont dare question Hidalgos credentials. Age 

 is not on his side, as hes well into his 70s, but 

 he should still be able to bring in some fresh ideas. The 

 question to ask is, can the AIFF afford him?

 Even if he hasnt coached 

 any famous side of late, someone of Hidalgos reputation 

 is almost certainly going to cost a bomb. Why Hidalgo, even 

 the former national coaches of Ireland or Romania will be 

 quite expensive. As far as my knowledge goes, the AIFF doesnt 

 have the funds to pay such high salaries. That is precisely 

 why I fear that we will end up appointing a third-grade 

 foreign coach. And Im convinced that we dont 

 need another Constantine.

 Spending precious dollars on someone 

 like Constantine will be a waste. We have quite a few young 

 desi coaches who can do a better job for a lesser 

 salary.

 Talking of Indian coaches, I have 

 to give it to Biswajit Bhattacharya the way he has transformed 

 an ailing Mohun Bagan to a winning unit. For a team which 

 managed five draws and two losses in its first seven outings 

 in the National League, winning the next three games in 

 a row was a wonderful achievement. All credit to Biswajit 

 for getting the players together and recreating a healthy, 

 conducive atmosphere which must have been missing.

 Biswajit adopted a simple style 

 and let the footballers play in a carefree fashion. As a 

 result, everyone in the Mohun Bagan ranks are flowing freely 

 now, like birds let loose from their cage. 

 Mehrajuddin Wadao is the fixed 

 man at the heart of the defence, the others are all running 

 and passing constantly. The shortest route to the goal is 

 being taken and, consequently, many openings are being created.

 Biswajit had a good footballing 

 brain in his playing days. I used him in the midfield, as 

 a striker. Its good to see him using his intelligence 

 while he is coaching as well. I was particularly happy to 

 see him putting the players in the forefront and not taking 

 any credit for the amazing resurgence.

 Of course, it wont be a 

 bed of roses all the way. The test for him and the players 

 will be when the team concedes a goal first in away matches 

 against teams like Mahindra, Sporting Clube de Goa and Dempo.

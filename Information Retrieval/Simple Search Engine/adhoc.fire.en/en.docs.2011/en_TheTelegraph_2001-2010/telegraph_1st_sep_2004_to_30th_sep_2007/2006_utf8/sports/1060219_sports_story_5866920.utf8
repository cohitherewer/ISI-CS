 Liverpool break United jinx

London: Liverpool ended their 85-year Manchester United jinx when a first-half Peter Crouch header gave them a deserved 1-0 win in the fifth round of the FA Cup at Anfield on Saturday. 

Third division Brentfords run came to an end across London at Charlton Athletic where the Premier League side eased through 3-1 while Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United drew 0-0 in a turgid all-Premier clash at the Reebok Stadium. 

Liverpool had not beaten United in nine FA Cup ties, spanning 85 years, including the 1996 and 1977 finals, but were always in command of a shot-shy lunchtime kick off at Anfield. 

United, a record 11-times winners of the Cup and runners-up last season, were desperately disappointing despite fielding an attacking side and Liverpool keeper Pepe Reina was not forced to make a worthwhile save. 

Although Liverpool face Benfica in the Champions League on Tuesday, coach Raphael Benitez also put out a full-strength side who took control of midfield from the start. 

The goal came in the 19th minute when a deep Steve Finnan cross reached an unmarked Crouch whose excellent header went in off both posts.

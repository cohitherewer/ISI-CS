The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB win 2-0 to widen lead

 - CFL PREMIER DIVISION 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal rode their luck to a 2-0 win over Amal Duttas Chirag United Sports Club in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match at the Howrah Stadium on Saturday. Syed Rahim Nabi struck in the 69th minute followed by an own goal by Wajid Ali in the 80th. 

East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silvas master stroke bringing in Mohammed Mukhtar in the 65th minute drifted the tide in East Bengals way. Within four minutes, they took the lead when a Mukhtar through was intercepted by Vincent Pires, who essayed it for Nabi inside the box. Nabi made no mistake in doing the final job with a precise header. 

The second goal was a sort of an accident. Snehasish Chakraborty, on the left, lobbed the ball inside the danger area, where Wajid attempting to clear, shot into his own goal to seal the fate of the match. East Bengal, now, have 22 points from nine matches while the losers remain on 10 from as many outings. 

Mukhtar had to return empty handed as there was no provision for the Man-of-the-Match award on Saturday. Otherwise he would have been the right person to bag a purse of Rs 5000 for his efforts which saved the league leaders from the blushes. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal coach, quite aptly, rued at the end that he lacks a striker who can convert half chances. I had to wait till the 69th minute to draw the first blood as I dont have a striker like Bhaichung (Bhutia), he said after the match.

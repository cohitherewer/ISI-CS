The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I tend to spend most of my time as the proverbial fox in the box

 - Thierry Henry is really impossible to contain, feels Luca Toni 

 Luca Toni 

In 2003 he kick-started his career by stepping down to Serie B. Today he is one of the most prolific goal-scorers in Europe, and the whole of Italy is expecting him to produce the goods at the World Cup. 

Luca Toni is his name and for him the road to Germany began in the 2003-04 season, when aged 26, he first donned the Palermo colours. He had joined the Sicilians from Brescia, then a Serie A club, and proceeded to make an immediate impact in the second tier by netting 30 times in 43 matches. 

His reward was a call from national coach Marcello Lippi, who gave him his debut in Reykjavik in a 0-2 loss to Iceland. Toni subsequently scored his first international goal in the opening World Cup qualifier against Norway at his home ground. 

The leading scorer in Serie A, Toni is now Italys first-choice striker and underlined his importance to the Azzurri with strikes in the recent friendly wins over the Netherlands and Germany. 

[Toni struck twice in his teams 5-2 win over Reggina on Sunday to become the first player in 47 years to score 30 goals in Serie A, accoring to Reuters report. The last man to reach 30 goals in a season was Argentine Anton Valentin Angelillo who scored 33 in the 1958-1959 season for Inter Milan.] 

Q Apart from your six goals in 16 games during the last couple of years, your international experience is limited. How do you feel about playing in the World Cup? 

A Youre right. At 29, this will be my first major international event. On the one hand Im looking forward to being involved, seeing as everyone says that the World Cup is something special. On the other, I want to do a good job for the team, and am sure that I will. Im feeling very relaxed about matters and I think that is one of my strong points. 

Antonio Cabrini has said that a players first World Cup can sometimes prove tricky. In Argentina, in 1978, Italy were a very strong side yet came fourth. In 1982 they had more experience and won. Do you think your lack of World Cup experience will count against you? 

I doubt it. Im hardly going to Germany for the ride ? Ill be playing to win right from the first whistle. Im lucky to have many highly experienced big-name players who have already played in World Cup finals alongside me in the squad. They will be on hand to provide any support I might need. 

How does your personal way of playing the game change when youre playing for your country? 

(Fiorentina coach Cesare) Prandelli expects slightly different things of me than, for example, (Francesco) Guidolin used to last year. My role depends on whether Im a lone striker or have someone alongside me, as was the case this season with Pazzo (Giampaolo Pazzini) or (Valeri) Bojinov. In the latter case you have to work harder to protect the midfield, and maintain the balance of the side. In any case, the international team definitely has less balance. 

So those people who are expecting to see the traditionally defensive Italy are mistaken? 

Definitely. Lippi has changed our way of thinking. It is no coincidence that we scored thrice against the Netherlands away from home and put four past Germany in Florence. One of our possible formations contains two strikers, a playmaker (Francesco Totti or Alessandro Del Piero), and an attacking midfielder like (Mauro) Camoranesi on one side of midfield. 

How would you describe yourself to those outside Italy who know very little about you? 

As a forward I bear a physical resemblance to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but although I like to roam every once in a while, I tend to spend most of my time as the proverbial fox in the box. I think it is now more important than ever to dominate your opponents physically, although obviously good technique also has a part to play. 

You and American Landon Donovan are favourites to top the group E goal-scoring charts. Who do see as your main rival in the strikers stakes? 

There will be a lot of great forwards in Germany. (Thierry) Henry, for example, is currently out there on a level of his own; he really is impossible to contain. Another striker who Ive played against and thought was excellent is (Didier) Drogba. 

Which team do you think will spring a surprise? 

Im hoping the Czech Republic, who my friend and teammate Tomas Ujfalusi plays for, will make it through the group stage with us. 

Tell us a bit about Ujfalusi, who may well end up marking you in Hamburg. 

Ufo is excellent. I didnt know anything about him before I joined Fiorentina and now I realise just what a good player he is. He can play in the centre of defence or on the flanks, is full of determination and never stops running. All that is lucky for Fiorentina but unlucky for us in the World Cup. 

How will you pass your spare time during the tournament? 

There will be a video games area available, for example. Its not really my thing, but Ill have the odd go. Well meet up and some of us will play cards, some the video games, others will just have a chat. Its a good group, and we get on well together. 

Who will you be sharing a room with? 

I dont know yet, obviously, but recently Ive been sharing with Cristian Zaccardo, whos from Modena, like me. He was a teammate at Palermo, so weve roomed together since he was first selected. 

Andrea Barzagli could have a crucial role to play in the absence of either of the two stalwarts, Fabio Cannavaro or Alessandro Nesta. Tell us about him. 

Hes young and strong. Like me, he doesnt have a great deal of international experience, but is definitely one for the future. If either Fabio or Alessandro is out for whatever reason, we have quality replacements available. Having said that, in spite of their differences, they are quite simply the two finest defenders I have ever met.

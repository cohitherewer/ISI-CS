 Australian umpires may form union

Melbourne: Australian umpires for the first time feel the need to unionise follo-wing The Oval fiasco involving compatriot Darrell Hair. 

An unprecedented move to unionise has been made to improve the support mechanisms for officials at international and state level after the forfeited Test controversy highlighted the immense pressure on umpires and, in the case of Hair, the lack of support, according to a report in an Australian newspaper on Saturday. 

The officials have contacted the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) in this regard, which will discuss the matter at a board meeting on Monday. 

We can confirm that an approach has been made, ACA spokesperson Tarryn Paten said. 

We are very sympathetic to the umpires cause and will see if there is something we can do, he said. 

The ACA may also consider admitting women cricketers for the first time to diversify their membership base. 

The Australian officials would be the first in international cricket to union- ise should the ACA accept them.

 Becks new Real deal in 3 weeks 

 David Beckham 

Madrid: Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has said the club will reach an agreement with David Beckham on a new deal within the next three weeks. 

Beckhams new contract will be sorted out in the next 15 to 20 days, because the club and coach Fabio Capello are very pleased with him, Calderon was quoted as saying in an interview published on Real Madrids website on Wednesday. 

Calderon has previously said he hopes the 31-year-old midfielder will sign a two-year extension to his current deal which expires at the end of the season. 

Spanish media have speculated over Beckhams future in the last few days after Capello put him on the bench for the Primera Liga match at home to Real Sociedad on Sunday. 

Former Arsenal forward Jose Antonio Reyes started in his place on the right of midfield and scored his first goal for the club with a free-kick. 

Reyes made way for Beckham in the 73rd minute, who scored a superb individual goal, running from his own half to make it 2-0 just before the end of the game. 

Beckham joined Real Madrid on a four-year contract from Manchester United in 2003, but has yet to win a major trophy at the club. 

He has said on a number of occasions that he is happy at Real and plans to remain with them until the end of his career.

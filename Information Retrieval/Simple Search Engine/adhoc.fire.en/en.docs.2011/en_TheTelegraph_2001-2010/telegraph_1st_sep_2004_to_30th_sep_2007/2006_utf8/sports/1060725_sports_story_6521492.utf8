 Atwal finishes tied 17th

 BC open

 New York: Arjun Atwal equalled 

 his best round for the season with a five-under 67 on the 

 final day to finish tied 17th at the $3 million BC Open 

 Golf Tournament.

 That finish also earned him only 

 third top-20 finish in a season that has been a struggle.

 Atwal finished with a total of 

 12-under, his best since 13-under Bob Hope Chrysler in January, 

 to pick up a cheque of $45,000.

 Daniel Chopra faltered on the 

 final day, as he has so often this year, with a double bogey 

 on 11th and three bogeys from 15th to 17th, and had a card 

 of 73 for an eighth-under 280 and tied 41st place. John 

 Rollins sank a five-foot birdie putt on the final hole for 

 an eight-under 64 to edge out Bob May for the title. Rollins 

 looked at the scoreboard on the final hole and then putted 

 for a birdie that gave him the title at 19-under 269.

 Atwal slotted five birdies on 

 second, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth to be five-under. 

 He then bogeyed the 16th and birdied the 18th for a 67.

Chennai: Rohan Bopannas bumper singles run at the Chennai Open ended in a bit of a whimper on Thursday evening. He can jolly well blame it on Gilles Muller, the first man from Luxembourg to make a mark in the world of tennis. 

The left-handed Muller showed just why he had risen to world No. 59 last September with the scalps of Rafael Nadal (at Wimbledon) and Andy Roddick (US Open) in his bag. Not the archetypal European, the 22-year-old controlled the back of the court with a swinging forehand and needed the slightest invitation to charge the net. 

Muller showed some deft touch too, catching his slower opponent on the wrong foot a couple of times. Bopanna did well to dodge six of the eight break-points he faced, but his inability to make an impression on Mullers serve left him fighting an uphill battle all the time. 

A break in each set did the trick for Muller. It came early in the first set, Muller going 3-1 up with on a perfectly struck forehand top-spin winner. 

The second set went with serve for eight games before Muller manufactured an opening. He chased a fine crosscourt return and got it back to the amazement of Bopanna. At 30-40, Bopanna came up with only his second double-fault of the match and that was the end of the road for him. 

Waiting for Muller in the quarter finals is Ivan Ljubicic. The top seed came through a searching test from Czech Jiri Vanek to win 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. 

Playing on Court I, the tall and wiry Belgian Kristof Vliegen advanced to his second successive quarter final here with a surprisingly straightforward 6-2, 6-4 shutout of sixth seed Rainer Schuettler. 

Vliegen will face the Thai test on Friday. The fourth-seeded Paradorn Srichaphan, pushed to a third set by unknown French qualifier Marc Gicquel, squeezed out a 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2 verdict. 

Bopanna resurrected his evening in the company of Prakash Amritraj, the Indian wild cards storming into the doubles quarter finals with an impressive 6-3, 6-2 win over third seeds Yves Allegro (Switzerland) and Michael Kohlmann (Germany). 

The cynosure on centre court was Ljubicic, whose predominantly black outfit made him look like a colossus from outer space. He strode on court like one in the first set but was reduced to a mere mortal in the second. 

Vanek, a typically hard-hitting Czech, went a break down in the fourth game as his best weapon, the forehand, let him down thrice. This was immediately after Ljubicic had fought off two break-points with that accurate serve of his which took him to No. 2 on the aces list (897) in 2005. 

What seemed to be a smooth ride suddenly turned bumpy for Ljubicic. Vanek played a superb return game and broke the Croat with one of his several winning drop-shots. 

Ljubicic was not only struggling with his serve ?? which in itself is a rarity ?? but mistiming the returns as well. 

By the time Ljubicic got his bearings back, the second set was Vaneks. 

The Czech was on a roll and the Croat had to do something about it pretty soon. It was the first real test for a man who had taken giant strides to force his way into the worlds top-10. 

As Vanek realised soon enough, he had stepped on the tail of a wounded tiger. Refusing to entertain thoughts of an early exit from the years first tournament, Ljubicic willed himself back to top form. The serves again landed at the right spots, the groundstrokes stopped misbehaving. 

A break in the fourth game was all Ljubicic needed to have the last laugh. He didnt put a step wrong thereafter. 

QUARTER FINAL LINE-UP 

Ivan Ljubicic (Cro, 1) vs Gilles Muller (Lux, 5); Paradorn Srichaphan (Tha, 4) vs Kristof Vliegen (Bel); Bjorn Phau (Ger, 7) vs Carlos Moya (Spa, 3); Thierry Ascione (Fra) vs Radek Stepanek (Cze, 2).

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar has been declared fit and available for selection for next months triangular series in Sri Lanka, a senior Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) official said on Tuesday. 

Sachin has been undergoing graded physical testing of his right shoulder for the last five days under the supervision of BCCI physiotherapist John Gloster and has made satisfactory progress to make him available for selection for the tour of Sri Lanka, Board secretary Niranjan Shah said in a statement. 

Sachin had a final assessment of his shoulder by his doctor (Andrew Wallace) in London prior to playing the matches for Lashings club, Shah said. 

He added, there would be no need for a fitness test which the batsman was scheduled to undergo here on Wednesday. 

Sachin underwent shoulder surgery in March after the home series against England which sidelined him from the subsequent tour of the West Indies. 

After the operation, Sachin spent six weeks in England for rehabilitation and used a series of club and charity games as match practice. 

Sachin tested his shoulder by playing a few matches in England and is feeling comfortable, Shah said. 

The selectors meet on Thursday to pick the team for the series involving South Africa and Sri Lanka with all matches to be played in Colombo from August 14-29.

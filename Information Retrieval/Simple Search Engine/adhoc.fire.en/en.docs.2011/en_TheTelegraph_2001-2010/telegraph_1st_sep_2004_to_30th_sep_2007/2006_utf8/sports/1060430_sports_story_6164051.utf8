 Dhoni displaced by Gilchrist

 - ODI Rankings

 - Pathan up to No. 2 in bowling Rankings

Dubai: Mahendra Singh Dhoni lost his world No. 1 ranking in ODI batting to Adam Gilchrist, but Irfan Pathan moved up one place to second position in the ICC bowling charts. 

Gilchrist leapfrogged his captain Ricky Ponting and Dhoni on the strength of his consistent performances in Bangladesh. The left-hander now holds a three-point advantage over the explosive Indian wicketkeeper-batsman, who had taken the top position from Ponting less than a fortnight ago. 

Pathan is second in the ODI bowling list behind South African veteran Shaun Pollock. Pathan is third on the allrounders list behind Pollock and Englands Andrew Flintoff. Pontings modest series in Bangladesh saw him slip to third, but the world champions still dominate the ODI batting rankings with the presence of Andrew Symonds (No. 4) and Michael Hussey (No. 5) ensuring four Aussies in the top-five. 

Symonds has his best-ever haul of rating points while Hussey entered the top-five for the first time. He gained one spot at the expense of South African skipper Graeme Smith. 

Indian captain Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh are No. 9 and 10, respectively, while Sachin Tendulkar has fallen out of the top-20. Harbhajan Singh is No. 10 among ODI bowlers. 

Australias clean sweep in Bangladesh means they retain a 13-point lead over South Africa at the top of the ODI team rankings. 

India are No. 3 a further three points back. 

Fourth-placed Pakistan trail their arch-rivals by two points, and are followed by New Zealand.

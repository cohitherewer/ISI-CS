 Rahil Gangjee 

Bandar Seri Begawan: Promising youngster Rahil Gangjee, returning from a hand injury, shot a sizzling seven-under 64 to take sole lead on the opening day of the $300,000 Brunei Open golf tournament here on Thursday. 

The winner of the Volkswagen Masters in 2004 and currently 45th on the Asian Tours Order of Merit, Gangjee fired eight birdies against a lone bogey at the Empire Hotel and Country Club. 

He was one shot clear of the three-way tie for second place between the Chinese Taipeis trio of Chen Tze-chung, Sung Mao-chang and Lu Wei-chih. 

 Harmeet Kahlon showed signs of returning to form with a five-under 66 that gave him joint fifth position with Filipino talent Juvic Pagunsan. Kahlon had seven birdies and two bogeys, one on the eighth, his second last hole. 

Four other Indians shot one-under 70 each but were tied in 42nd place as the opening day saw some low scores. They were S.S.P. Chowrasia, 15th last week, Amandeep Johl, Gurbaaz Mann and Digvijay Singh. 

 Other Indians in the fray were 

 Arjun Singh (71, tied 68th), Jyoti Randhawa (73, tied 101st), 

 Amritinder Singh (75, tied 128 th), Uttam Mundy (76, tied 

 140th) and Kanwar Sekhon (78, tied 151st).

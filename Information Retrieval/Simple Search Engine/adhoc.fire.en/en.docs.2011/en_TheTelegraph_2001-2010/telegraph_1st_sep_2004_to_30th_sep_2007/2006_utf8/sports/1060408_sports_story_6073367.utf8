Visakhapatnam: Defending 

 champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly played a fine technical game 

 to beat PSPB teammate and International Master S. Arun Prasad 

 in the sixth round of the 43rd National A Chess Championship 

 here.

 On a day when tournament leader 

 Koneru Humpy had a bye owing to the withdrawal of Grandmaster 

 Tejas Bakre, International Master S. Kidambi inched closer 

 to the title with a comprehensive victory over Vikramaditya 

 Kamble of Maharashtra.

 With 14 rounds still to go in 

 the premier event, Humpy remained in sole lead with 5 points 

 while Kidambi now has 4.5 points from six games.

 Jharkhands D. P. Singh, 

 the surprise packet of the 21-player round robin event, 

 came up with yet another fantastic performance to beat M. 

 S. Thej Kumar. Sriram Jha went down to Sandipan Chanda. 

 Bengals Arghyadip Das defeated Himanshu Sharma while 

 Lanka Ravi lost to Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury.

 Singh, Ganguly and former Asian 

 junior champion Deepan Chakravarthy of Tamil Nadu are in 

 third spot with 4 points each while a pack of four players, 

 including Grandmaster R B Ramesh, are next with 3.5 points 

 apiece.

 In womens event, topping 

 the casualty list was none other than top seeded International 

 Master S. Vijayalakshmi of Indian Airlines, who found her 

 nemesis in Eesha Karavade.

 Vijayalakshmis younger sibling 

 WGM S. Meenakshi also went down to last years runner-up 

 Mary Ann Gomes of Bengal. Championship leader Swati Ghate 

 was beaten by Keralas Nimmy George. D. Harika and 

 Nisha Mohota split the point.

 After the fifth round of the event, 

 Ghate was joined in the lead by Mary Ann, with four points 

 each. Kiran Manisha Mohanty of Orissa, who went down to 

 Bengals Swati Mohota, is sole third with 3.5 points 

 while Nimmy George and Eesha Karavade have 3 points each 

 in their bag.

 Arun Prasad failed to trouble 

 defending champion Ganguly, who played the white side of 

 a Sicilian defence. The Grandmaster came up with an exchange 

 sacrifice in the middle game only to win it back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mentor branded as villain 

 - one-time prot?g? sourav, too, turns heat on dalmiya 

OUR STAFF REPORTERS

Calcutta: Its not official, but those in the know are aware that Jagmohan Dalmiya played an important role in Sourav Gangulys first comeback ? back in the summer of 1996. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, there was a strong move to include rookie V.V.S. Laxman, but Dalmiya (as the Board secretary) facilitated the Bengal left-handers comeback after more than four years of being out in the cold. 

That, however, isnt the only instance when Dalmiya (in different capacities) came to the rescue of the younger son of a family known pretty well to him. Its another matter that today Sourav has chosen to attack Dalmiya ? albeit indirectly ? at a time when the rest of the cricket fraternity is also after his head. 

 The list of other such instances 

 is long.

 Ajay Jadeja was in the running for the India captaincy once 

 Sachin Tendulkar announced he would relinquish the top job 

 in early 2000. Dalmiya, however, did quite a bit of lobbying 

 to ensure that the captaincy went to Sourav and not Jadeja 

 ? who, by the way, wasnt even a regular in the Test 

 squad. 

 Sourav went through a slump in late 2001 and early 2002 

 and Dalmiya, as Board president, made sure that the heat 

 on Sourav didnt become unbearable. 

Cut to more recent times. 

 Sourav was banned by Match Referee Clive Lloyd in November 

 2004 for two Tests after the India-Pakistan platinum jubilee 

 ODI at the Eden. Dalmiya worked overtime ? thanks to an 

 excellent rapport with ICC president Ehsan Mani ? to get 

 it overturned. 

 Again, owing to a slow over-rate, Sourav got a stiffer sentence 

 ? banned for six ODIs ? from Match Referee Chris Broad during 

 the ODI series against Pakistan in April 2005. Dalmiya was 

 back in the thick of action, and eventually Souravs 

 sentence was curtailed to four matches. 

 Dalmiya pulled the strings (it helped that Board president 

 Ranbir Singh Mahendra was no more than a puppet) to ensure 

 Sourav got back the captaincy after the tour of Sri Lanka 

 ? July-August 2005 ? when the top job had gone to Rahul 

 Dravid. 

Till relations soured, Sourav would often say, dekhi Jaguda ki bole. 

Souravs injury after the tour of Zimbabwe last year marked the start of the divide between Dalmiya and him. Sourav repeatedly told confidants that Dalmiya just didnt do enough to get him back into the ODI team as he was more intent on holding on to his position of pre-eminence in the Board. Basically, Sourav felt let-down and was known to have told friends that Dalmiya had sacrificed him at a crucial time in his career. 

Where their relationship is concerned, it didnt help that Dalmiyas group got wiped out (in the Board) last November. Even if Dalmiya wanted to help Sourav, he found himself in a situation where he couldnt even have helped himself. 

Of course till Friday, Sourav hadnt blamed Dalmiya for leaking Greg Chappells sensational e-mail. Now that he has, a point of no-return has been reached. 

Given what has happened, though, be prepared to hear some more?

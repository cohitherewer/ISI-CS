 Popular Ribery included

 - Barthez named No. 1 keeper Pires, Giuly left out

 Franck Ribery 

Paris: France coach Raymond Domenech bowed to popular demand by picking Olympique Marseilles Franck Ribery in his 23-man squad for the World Cup finals on Sunday. 

Arguably the finest player in Ligue 1 this season, the 23-year-old attacking midfielder is being hailed in France as the new Zinedine Zidane but had so far been overlooked by Domenech. 

Ribery is one of two uncapped players on Domenechs list with Pascal Chimbonda, a 27-year-old defender who plays for Wigan Athletic in the Premier League. 

The choice of Chimbonda, who says his dream has come true, came as a total surprise. I was looking forward to the squad announcement, the 27-year-old told the French federations website on Sunday. 

 The coach has always said the door was open. Its a dream coming true, Im very happy. 

He joined Wigan Athletic last summer from Bastia for a ?500,000 ($943,000) transfer fee, was voted this season Premier Leagues best right fullback by the Professional Footballers Association. 

He stunned Wigan though by handing a transfer request moments after his sides final game of the season. 

The versatile Ribery, both a fighter and an artist whose only international appearances so far were for Frances under-21 side, was listed as a forward on Domenechs list. 

Up front, alongside Frances top two marksmen, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet, Domenech also picked Louis Saha. 

Missing from the list are Arsenals Robert Pires and Barcelonas Ludovic Giuly, who will face each other in the Champions League final on Wednesday at the Stade de France. 

Domenech said that World Cup and European championship winner Fabien Barthez would be his No. 1 goalkeeper at the World Cup ahead of Olympique Lyons Gregory Coupet. 

Barthez is one of six survivors from Frances 1998 World Cup-winning squad with Lilian Thuram, Patrick Vieira, Zidane, Henry and Trezeguet. Zidanewill end his prolific career after the World Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Both teams want trophy badly: Lara

 - TRI-SERIES FINAL Hayden left out as he isnt in 14 for Champions Trophy

Kuala Lumpur: The pressure will surely be on Australia in Sundays tri-series final. After all, as West Indies captain Brian Lara put it, his team arrived as third favourites, behind the world champions and India. There werent a lot of expectations on us making the final... 

In Laras view, though, the pressure is going to be even. He said Saturday: Both teams want the trophy (DLF Cup) badly... The pressure will be even, but weve got a tough match on our hands and my batsmen have got to value their wickets... The Australians havent got this far to lose... Same for us. 

In the league stage, both Australia and the West Indies beat each other once. However, had the West Indies batted sensibly in the opener (while chasing), the head-to-head count wouldve been 2-0 in their favour. 

Ricky Ponting, the Australian captain, is hoping to capitalise on the West Indies vulnerability when batting second. Theyre a bit shaky chasing, which is a good sign for us... Getting a (big) total on board is going to be nice... Were here to win... 

While Lara has been among the runs, Ponting hasnt done anything of note after 54 in match No.1. Yes, it will be good to get some runs... Ive actually been a bit stiff in a couple of games... Thats how it goes... 

Lara had this to say: Ive worked on a few things and my confidence is right up there... Im feeling nice, but its a team sport... Incidentally, he wouldnt like to inhibit either Chris Gayle or Shivnarine Chanderpaul because of the quality of Australias opening attack. 

Glenn (McGrath) hasnt got many wickets, but has put pressure from one end... Brett Lee, as we all know, can be fast... Of course, seeing off the first ten-odd overs is going to be important, but I wouldnt like to inhibit Chris or Chanderpaul, Lara maintained. 

Asked if he knew which of the two pitches the final would be played on, he replied: No... At the end of the day, it will just be cricket... Tournament director Brendan McClements told The Telegraph: Were going to take a call in the morning. 

The one where the ridge developed didnt host Fridays semi-final between India and Australia. The one that did saw much deterioration as the face-off went long into the second session. Clearly, a poor surface shouldnt mar what promises to be a blazing contest. 

While the West Indians are keeping options open theres concern that Corey Collymore still isnt hundred per cent fit, the Australians have named 12. Surprisingly, senior pro Matthew Hayden, who top-scored not many hours ago, has been omitted. 

Sources explained that Ponting and coach John Buchanan favoured looking ahead (to the Champions Trophy) and, so, the opener had to miss out as he isnt in the 14 for that competition. Given that Hayden is so passionate about the Australia colours, the move must have upset him. 

With rotation ending, key players Michael Clarke and Shane Watson are back (as is Nathan Bracken). Eventually, Damien Martyn is the one who may not make the XI. 

It didnt necessarily come down to who performed the best... Andrew Symonds hasnt made many runs, but you wont leave him out because hes a matchwinner, Ponting remarked. Well, theres no doubt that he knows exactly how to get the best out of whoever is in. 

Its to be seen, by the way, how many turn up 

at the Kinrara Oval. Many had bought tickets expecting India in the final, but 

theres no guarantee each one of them will show up. The tri-series was put 

together by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, but Rahul Dravids 

men went home with the wooden spoon.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I need to be consistent outside the subcontinent too

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Winning has its rhythm and people must be patient, says Dhoni 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: The one and only Mahendra Singh Dhoni completed two years of international cricket on December 23. He has done very well, but is intent on doing much better. Dhoni spoke to The Telegraph not too long ago on condition that there be no questions about individuals and specific tours, all the result of Board of Control for Cricket in India guidelines. 

The following are excerpts from that one-on-one 

On being an International since December 2004 

Im happy with my performances... Satisfied with the work Im putting in... Im sure I can be happier, feel more satisfied... Having said that, Im aware there will be obstructions, there are going to be fresh challenges. The more you play, more the opportunities for the opposition to plan for getting you quickly. 

On the best way to stay a step ahead 

Changing ones game. 

On his emotions when he took the field in Chittagong (first ODI of that series) 

It was, in a way, nice that my debut wasnt against a tougher opposition... Had it been Pakistan, for example, then the pressure wouldve been much more... Because it was Bangladesh, I wasnt overwhelmed (by the pressure)... 

On what he has learnt most 

That one needs time getting used to conditions... The expectation is that I should score on landing in South Africa, England, Australia... Surely, that cant always be the case. But, yes, I accept I need to be consistent outside the subcontinent, too... Its easy to sit in judgement while watching TV, but quickly getting used to conditions isnt so. One may practise on concrete with a plastic ball, but that wont be a true indication of the bounce that will actually be there in South Africa or Australia... Im sure what I learn in South Africa is going to be handy when I tour the country next time. Could help me on next seasons trip to Australia as well. 

On whether his mental preparation differs from series to series 

Not much... I have a fair idea of what to expect both from the conditions and the attack. I dont complicate my game. The first couple of matches on any tour are important... Allows you to assess the opposition and, as important, allows you to adjust your game if required. However, its not that success is guaranteed. 

On exposure in countries like South Africa 

Im sure whatever I learn will make me a better cricketer. I take to all tours with that attitude... I realise that much remains to be learned... Realise that my education as a cricketer continues. 

On India beginning the season on a low, in Kuala Lumpur and during the Champions Trophy at home 

Look, people must realise that no cricketer can be consistent throughout the year. Similarly, no team is going to be consistent right through... There was the perception that India couldnt chase, but we set the record (in 2005-06) for the most wins while chasing 17... It wasnt long ago and should not be forgotten... Just as batsmen or bowlers need a couple of good matches to get out of a slump, so do teams... Winning has its rhythm and people must be patient. 

On the pressure on him 

(Smiles) Its obvious that if I dont score in one match, there will be pressure in the next... But its a different kind of pressure more like I need to do well, rather than Ive got to do well... In any case, Ive got to keep raising the bar... Pressure isnt that bad a thing and should be there in some degree. 

On whether he seeks anybodys guidance if the pressure starts to get too much 

I stick to my normal routine... I do watch videotapes of my better performances... I watch the 183 not out versus Sri Lanka (Jaipur, last year)... Some of my innings in Pakistan this year... It depends... I watch the ones which help boost positive thoughts. (After a pause) I religiously listen to the seniors. 

On criticism 

No one likes to be criticised, but criticism doesnt weigh me down... Doesnt push me on the backfoot... Im the sort to neither get carried away by success nor get affected by what people say when the going isnt good... Im a practical person... My feet stay on the ground. This wont change. 

On whether he got to interact with idol Adam Gilchrist during the Champions Trophy 

Very briefly, after the match in Mohali... It was, intentionally, a casual conversation... I didnt want to throw a thousand questions at our first meeting... The next time, yes, Im going to talk cricket. 

On the World Cup getting nearer 

Absolutely... The two series at home before that, against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, will be crucial... Conditions in the West Indies are nowadays quite similar to India and, so, its going to be really helpful. Im fortunate that Ive toured the West Indies (earlier this year). 

On whether he intends modelling in the off season 

(Laughs) We wont have an off season... Not after the Twenty20 game, too, takes root in a big way... Where will I get the time? I do shoot once in a while, but Ive got to honour commitments related to endorsements... My cricket doesnt suffer. 

On home town Ranchi coming to a standstill on his last visit to a saloon there 

The lesson Ive learnt is that its better to have a hair cut in Mumbai! 

On whether, being an icon, hes conscious about behaving in a particular way 

Ive got to behave in a particular way, as youve put it... At the same time, Im never over-conscious. Its like being confident, but not over-confident. 

Finally, given a chance, if theres anything he would differently 

(After the briefest of pauses) Wouldnt get out to Brett Lee in the manner I did in Kuala Lumpur... That match was a virtual semi-final and I ought not to have thrown away my wicket... We lost... In a similar situation, I wouldnt play the same shot... Its a regret.

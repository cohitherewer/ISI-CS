The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 After ICC, Dubai is now wooing ACC 

 - DSC has made a very attractive offer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: The Dubai Sports 

 City (DSC) pulled off a coup when it got the International 

 Cricket Council to relocate, from Lords, in August 

 last year. The facility isnt quite ready it will 

 be within 12 months but DSC has made temporary arrangements. 

 Now, DSC (part-owned by Abdul Rehman Bukhatir) is 

 wooing the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), which is headquartered 

 in the Malaysian capital here. 

 The DSC has made a very 

 attractive offer and would like the Asian body to shift 

 immediately... In fact, its willing to make alternative 

 arrangements, till its ready for occupation, at no 

 cost to the ACC, a well-placed source told The 

 Telegraph from Dubai. 

A senior ACC official confirmed the offer, but declined to go into details. Speaking on Saturday afternoon, he said: The offer must first be placed before the finance committee. After that, it has to go to the Executive Board and the general body... It cant be discussed in public... 

According to the well-placed source, DSC has offered the following: (a) Rent free office space totalling 3,500 square feet; (b) Relocation charges, which may be in the region of $ 400,000; (c) Subsidy for the accommodation of ACC staff; (d) Sponsoring of ACC tournaments U-15, 17, 19 and the ACC Trophy in all probability to the tune of $ 1,000,000 each year. 

While the ACCs operational costs could go up substantially, as Dubai is far more expensive than Kuala Lumpur, theres no taxation in the Emirate... For the employees, therefore, it can be a big attraction, the well-placed source pointed out. 

The ACC dropped anchor here in January 2003. 

 For good reasons, Indias stand is going to be 

 watched. After all, the Board of Control for Cricket in 

 India has the loudest voice within the ACC. The DSC, incidentally, 

 will (among other things) be housing an academy. Rodney 

 Marsh is going to oversee its operations.

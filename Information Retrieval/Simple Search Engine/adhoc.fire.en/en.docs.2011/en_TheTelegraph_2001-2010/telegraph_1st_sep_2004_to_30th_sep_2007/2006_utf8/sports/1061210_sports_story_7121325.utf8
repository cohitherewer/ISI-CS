 Shoaib, Asif to play in Twenty20 meet

Lahore: Pakistan fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif will return to action in a Twenty20 Cup domestic tournament later this month after being cleared of doping charges. 

The duo had their long-term bans set aside on Tuesday by a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) appeals tribunal. 

Both have been cleared by the board to resume playing domestic cricket. They have shown willingness to play in the Twenty20 tournament which starts from December 21, Saqib Irfan, a PCB official said. 

PCB selectors said both will only be considered for the tour of South Africa early next year after they have proved their match fitness and form in domestic cricket. (Reuters)

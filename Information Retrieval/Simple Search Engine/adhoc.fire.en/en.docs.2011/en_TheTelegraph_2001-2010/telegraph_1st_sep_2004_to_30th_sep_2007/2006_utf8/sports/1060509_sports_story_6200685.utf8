 Selectors set for 3-yr term

Mumbai: The national selectors are poised to get a three-year term without the need to be re-nominated annually by their respective five zones once the constitution of the BCCI is amended at its special general meeting here on June 1. 

They are all grouped under the constitutional amendment motions, including the three-year term for office bearers and selectors, without the need to be re-elected or re-nominated every year, a top Board source said. 

The other proposed amendment that would come up for voting at the meeting is the incorporation of the clause for earmarking of Rs 50 crore corpus for training and coaching of young and talented athletes representing Olympic sports, the source said. 

The BCCI, at its last working committee meeting in Mumbai, had taken a decision to this effect but it needs a constitutional amendment recommended by the review committee for this to be implemented.

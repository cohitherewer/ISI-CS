The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Argentina failed to cash in on German 

 mistakes 

 Talking Tactics-PK Banerjee

 It was labelled as the final before 

 the finale. In reality, it turned out to be a hard battle 

 of attrition. Argentina and Germany blinked once each in 

 120 minutes. And in the shootout, the experienced Lehmann 

 kept his nerve to take Germany through. 

 They sweated it out for two hours, 

 spilling blood and guts on the pitch. It didnt make 

 for beautiful football, few clear chances were created, 

 not many artistic moves were visible. The accent was clearly 

 on safety. 

 Not an inch of space was yielded 

 by either team. Riquelme, who loves building moves slowly 

 from his own half, was just not given the space to create. 

 But for two intended defence-splitting passes, which were 

 well handled by Metzelder, the Argentine playmaker was rendered 

 ineffective. Pekerman wasnt wrong in taking him off. 

 If I were to be critical of the 

 Argentine coach, it would be his timing of introducing his 

 third and final substitute. He took victory for granted 

 with 10 minutes left. As it turned out, Klose equalised 

 right then. Had Pekerman waited three-four minutes more, 

 he would have had the option of bringing on someone like 

 Messi for the extra-time push. 

 I also didnt understand 

 Klinsmanns move to bring on Neuville in place of Klose. 

 I would have benched Podolski, who had a forgettable game. 

 The Argentines had more of the 

 ball, but when it came to penetrating the last line of German 

 defence, they were found wanting. 

 Germany, on the other hand, were 

 playing against themselves. The pressure of playing at home, 

 the pressure of sky-high expectations made them laden-footed. 

 None symbolised all this better than Ballack. 

 The first 20 minutes saw football 

 at a frenetic pace. Argentina, aware that Klinsmanns 

 men have been good at scoring early goals, consciously took 

 the game to Germany in an effort to rock the hosts. The 

 German defence staved off the early threat efficiently and 

 then tested their opponents thrice. Podolskis left-footed 

 free-kick curled in and rebounded off Abbondanzieris 

 chest. 

 Schweinsteiger and Schneider then 

 combined to set up Ballack who produced a fine third-man 

 run but couldnt finish the move. The German captain 

 had left his shooting boots behind. Otherwise, how can you 

 explain Ballack not taking a single shot from 25-30 yards, 

 a quality which has made him so feared around the world? 

 Ballacks trapping let the 

 team down too. I cant remember more than a solitary 

 decent pass and cross (which produced the equaliser) from 

 his boot. He also failed to trap the ball a number of times. 

 The tide turned during the shootout 

 when nerves betrayed the Argentines. Ayalas shot was 

 too weak and Lehmann had no problem stopping it. Cambiassos 

 left-footer had much more power but Lehmann read correctly 

 and kept it out. 

 Germany are through to the last 

 four, but after surviving their worst game of the tournament. 

 Klinsmann will have to help his men regroup if the big dream 

 is to be kept alive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 QUICK TAKES

 Even 

 if they win, Brazil cant keep the Cup: Fifa 

 Berlin: Brazil wont 

 get to keep the World Cup trophy even if they clinch their 

 sixth title on July 9 in Berlin. Fifa official Markus Siegler 

 would not even entertain speculation that Brazil, or any 

 other team, would get to keep one of the most globally recognised 

 prizes in sport. Brazil were allowed to keep the original 

 Jules Rimet trophy in 1970 after becoming the first three-time 

 winner of the World Cup. The Brazilians have won it twice 

 since then and so have Germany, leading to the perennial 

 question about Fifa handing over the existing cup. Siegler 

 responded with a flat no to the question on 

 Thursday at a daily news conference, not entering into any 

 debate.

 Pitches disappointing 

 Berlin: The World Cup organisers admitted 

 on Thursday that they were disappointed by worn-looking 

 pitches, but blamed unseasonable cold weather in Germany 

 in May for the problems. We didnt achieve the 

 optimum objective we set, we have to concede that, 

 the vice-president of the organising committee, Wolfgang 

 Niersbach, admitted. 

 Van Basten fan 

 Marienfeld: Portuguese striker Helder Postiga 

 said he wanted Dutch coach Marco van Bastens autograph 

 after the two meet on Sunday, but he wanted to beat The 

 Netherlands even more. Van Basten was my idol as a 

 player, Postiga told a news conference on Thursday. 

 Maybe Ill get his autograph after the game. 

 Free taxi 

 Shanghai: Shanghai soccer fans will be offered 

 free taxi rides home after upcoming matches to help keep 

 drunken drivers off the roads, a Shanghai daily newspaper 

 said on Thursday. The service, paid for as part of a promotion 

 by an international liquor distributor, will operate after 

 selected matches from a handful of bars chosen by police, 

 the paper said. 

 Catcalls for Costa Rica 

 San Jose: After losing all their matches in 

 Germany, a disheartened and jet-lagged Costa Rican World 

 Cup squad returned home to face taunts from angry hecklers 

 on Wednesday. Receiving the loudest catcalls was national 

 team coach Alexandre Guimaraes, who emerged from the airport 

 to chants of of Dog! dog! from a small group 

 of unhappy soccer fans. 

 Torres not for sale 

 Madrid: Atletico Madrid have no intention 

 of selling Spain striker Fernando Torres and have instead 

 offered to extend his contract for a further year, according 

 to president Enrique Cerezo. Torres, 22, who has scored 

 three goals in Spains opening two games, has been 

 linked with moves to England and Italy as well as to city 

 rivals Real Madrid. We havent changed our position: 

 Torres is not for sale, Cerezo said.

 Birthday wish 

 Leipzig: Lionel Messi turns 19 on Saturday 

 and is determined to make it a double celebration by outfoxing 

 Barcelona teammate Rafael Marquez and firing Argentina into 

 the World Cup quarter finals.

 Dangerous animals 

 Hamburg: Germany are dangerous animals who 

 can win the World Cup, Ireland manager Steve Staunton said 

 after the hosts finished top of their group to qualify for 

 a clash with Sweden in the second round at the finals. Irelands 

 most-capped player and veteran of four World Cups is in 

 Germany to analyse the host nation. Germany are a 

 dangerous animal and capable of winning the tournament, 

 based on what I have seen so far, Staunton said.

 Father bets on son 

 Kiev: The father of Andriy Rusol, who stroked 

 Ukraines first goal in their 4-0 rout of Saudi Arabia, 

 won nearly $445 ? three times the average monthly wage in 

 the ex-Soviet state ? after betting on his son. I 

 dont really like betting. But an hour before our game 

 with the Saudis I finally decided to go to the bookmakers, 

 Anatoly Rusol told the a local daily. 

 Better view 

 Berlin: With Germany playing their match against 

 Sweden in Munich, fans in Berlin, going to watch the game 

 on the fan-mile by the Brandenburg gate, will get a better 

 view with two more giant screens being brought in to take 

 the total to nine. Up to 750,000 fans are expected. 

 World Cup virus 

 London: Security firms are warning football fans about a new computer worm doing the rounds that uses World Cup-themed e-mails to infect Windows PCs. The Sixem-A worm is spread in messages with subject lines such as naked World Cup game set and crazy soccer fans.

 Rathores gun goes missing

 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore

New Delhi: The prospects of Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore in World Shooting Championship suffered a setback after the marksman lost his costly Perazzi gun, the same weapon that won him the Olympic quota place two days ago. 

The airlines in which, Rathore was travelling from Cairo to Delhi misplaced the gun, which was part of his travel baggage. A gun is not a normal baggage. Losing a gun at airport means it is a security issue, Rathore said. 

It is strange for the airlines to say we dont know where the gun is because all baggages are tagged and computerised and can be located. 

What bothers Rathore is the fact that trap shooter Ranjan Birendeep Sodhi too had lost his gun while travelling on the same airlines 10 days ago and was yet to find his gun. 

The loss of the gun has put Rathores participation in the ISSF World Cup in Germany from June 11 in doubt. 

The major event for the shooter though would be the shooting World Championship from July 30. 

Even if Rathore gets a new gun at the earliest, he would need time to adjust to it. 

But 36-year-old Rathore sought to play down the setback. I still feel winning Olympic quota is important. Frankly, I am not overly perturbed by this, am very happy that my performance in (Cairo) went well, the ace double-trap shooter said. 

The Athens Games silver-medallist now has two options ?? either to wait for the airlines to locate his gun or import another weapon from his manufacturers in Italy.

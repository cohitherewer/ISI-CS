 Quick Takes

 Germanys tough stance on racism

 Berlin: Germany pledged 

 on Thursday to take a tough stance against xenophobia at 

 the World Cup and dismissed a warning that black fans risked 

 attacks in some parts of the country. I think during 

 the world championship everyone can feel safe, wherever 

 he will be in Germany. We are prepared, interior minister 

 Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters. No one who would 

 try to make attacks on foreigners, people of colour, will 

 succeed.

 He was speaking a day after a 

 former government spokesman said non-whites should avoid 

 parts of Brandenburg, the former east German state surrounding 

 Berlin, because they would possibly not leave there 

 alive.

 Banking on Brazil

 Sao Paulo: Banks in Brazil 

 can shorten their hours to give employees a chance to watch 

 the teams World Cup games on TV, the Central Bank 

 said on Wednesday. Banks and other financial institutions 

 must open for at least four hours on match days, but can 

 otherwise set their own sche- dule, the bank said in a statement.

 Under Brazilian regulations, banks 

 must normally be open for at least five hours a day including 

 from noon to 3 pm.

 The young and the old of 

 it

 London: Englands 

 Theo Walcott will be the youngest player at the World Cup 

 finals in Germany, Fifa said on Thursday. Tunisias 

 40-year-old goalkeeper Ali Boumnijel will be the oldest 

 player at the tournament that starts on June 9. 

 The 17-year-old Walcott could 

 become the youngest player since Pele at Sweden 1958 to 

 score a goal at the finals. Boumnijel, should he play, will 

 become the fifth oldest player in World Cup history behind 

 Cameroons Roger Milla, Northern Irelands Pat 

 Jennings, Englands Peter Shilton and Italian Dino 

 Zoff.

 Double cover

 Dhaka: Fifa president Sepp 

 Blatter has more than doubled the coverage of next months 

 World Cup in Bangladesh. Journalists, originally granted 

 only four accreditations, asked Blatter to help when he 

 visited their country to open last months AFC Challenge 

 Cup in Dhaka and they have now received six extra passes 

 to cover the tournament.

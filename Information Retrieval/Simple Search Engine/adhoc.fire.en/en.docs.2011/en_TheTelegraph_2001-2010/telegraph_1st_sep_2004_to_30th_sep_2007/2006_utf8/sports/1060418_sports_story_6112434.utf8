 India manage a win

 - FOUR-NATION HOCKEY 

Monchengladbach: India stave-off a late challenge from Argentina to win 3-2 in their final group match of the four-nation Invitation Hockey Tournament at Warsteiner Hockey Park here on Monday. 

After Sandeep Singh (11th), Rajpal Singh (18th, 25th) put the team 3-0 up, the South Americans fought back through goals by Ezequiel Paulon (61st) and Tomas Maccormick (66th) in the last 10 minutes. 

Sandeep opened the account for India by converting the first penalty corner. 

Rajpal Singh put it past the Argentina goalkeeper after getting a nice pass from Tushar Khandekar. 

The Indians initiated another attack on the left flank. But striker Tejbir Singh to get control of the final pass just in front of the D. The third goal was not far, though. After thwarting an Argentinian attempt to score, the Indians raided their opponents citadel. 

An opportune Rajpal deflected a free hit from outside the striking circle to make it 3-0. 

India kept up their momentum with a couple of good moves led by captain Gagan Ajit Singh early in the second half. Just nine minutes before the final hooter, Paulon earned the first goal for them scoring off a rebound after Carlos Reteguis stroke was held by goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri. 

Chhetri was unlucky once more after blocking a Retegui shot, only to see McCormick flicking the ball into the net. 

In their second match on Sunday, India conceded two late goals to lose 3-5 to Spain. 

India displayed a superb fightback in the second half to level the score 3-3 after trailing 2-0 at the breather. But the defensive lapses cost them the match as the European champions pumped in two goals in the last seven minutes. 

After Paolo Amat (ninth, 21st) took Spain to 2-0, Eduard Tubau (37th, 63rd, 69th) netted a trio. 

For India, Khandekar (44th), Gagan Ajit (55th), Sandeep Singh scored.

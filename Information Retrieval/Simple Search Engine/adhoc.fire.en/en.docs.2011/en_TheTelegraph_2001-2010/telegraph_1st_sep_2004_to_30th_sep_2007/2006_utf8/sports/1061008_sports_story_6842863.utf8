 Atwal manages to make the cut

 - GREENSBORO CLASSIC 

 Nick Watney moved into sole lead 

Greensboro: A late bogey saw Arjun Atwal card a one-over 73 and slip to tied-28th spot after the second round of the Chrysler Classic golf tournament here. 

Atwal, currently world No.143, needs a good finish to come inside the top 125 of PGA Tour money ranking and is fighting hard to find the touch that made him the best putter on the tour last year. 

The No.2 Indian golfer, tied 10th overnight, was four-under 140 after two rounds, just about making the cut. 

Daniel Chopra, tied-22nd overnight, also joined Atwal as he shot six bogeys and four birdies in his 74 that gave him a three-over total, the score where the cut was applied. 

After a strong 67 on the opening day, the 33-year-old Atwal struggled to keep pace. Starting on the tenth, he birdied the 13th but dropped bogeys on 12th and 16th. He picked a second birdie on fourth, but a bogey on eighth saw him go over par. 

Chopra had a disastrous start with three bogeys in first holes between the tenth and 13th. He picked two birdies on 15th and 17th, but three other bogeys from third to fifth almost saw him miss the weekend round. His two other birdies were on second and seventh. 

American Nick Watney shot a 71 and took the sole lead in the second round. Watney played it safe to move to nine-under 135 and remain in the lead during a rainy, blustery second round. 

Boosted by a birdie-birdie start, the 25-year-old Californian fired a one-under-par 71 at Forest Oaks Country Club to finish on top of a congested leaderboard at nine-under 135. 

Compatriot Ryan Palmer, who spectacularly holed out with a wedge to eagle the par-four fifth on his way to a best-of-the-day 65, was tied for second with Australias John Senden (70). 

Briton Greg Owen (69) was a further stroke behind at seven under, level with Americans Chris Couch (68), Tim Petrovic (69), Charley Hoffman (71), Ryan Moore (70) and Eric Axley (69). (PTI)

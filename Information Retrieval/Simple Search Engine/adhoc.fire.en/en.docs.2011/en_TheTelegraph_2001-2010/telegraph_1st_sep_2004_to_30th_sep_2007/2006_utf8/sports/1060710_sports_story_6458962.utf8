 Pathan back to basics

Vadodara: Irfan Pathan believes his rough patch is only temporary and he will be back to his best sooner than later. 

The left-arm pacer could take only six wickets in the five ODIs and returned a modest two for 93 in the only Test he playedin the West Indies. 

Bad performance in a few matches cannot be taken as a failure. Bad phase is part of any sport and I am very confident about improving my performance and doing well in future matches, Pathan said. 

Pathan said the only way to recapture form would be to go back to the basics. I am a bowler first and I want to continue to better my technique. My aim is to capture more wickets, he said. 

Pathans omission from the Tests was a subject of debate with former cricketers also criticising the team managements tendency to promote him up the batting order frequently. The player himself reiterated his full faith in the team management, though.

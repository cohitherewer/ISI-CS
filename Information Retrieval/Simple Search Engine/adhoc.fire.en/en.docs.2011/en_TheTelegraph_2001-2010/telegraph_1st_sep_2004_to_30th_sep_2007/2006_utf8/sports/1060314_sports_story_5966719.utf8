Indian Wells: Andre Agassi is attempting to put together a consortium to buy Bjorn Borgs five replica Wimbledon trophies. Financially-strapped Swede Borg is planning to auction off the five trophies he won between 1976 and 1980 as well as two signed rackets he used. 

The sale is due to go ahead on June 21 at Bonhams salerooms in London and the trophies and rackets are collectively expected to bring in between ?200,000 and ?300,000. 

Ive discussed it with my own people to find a way of gathering the right people together to buy those trophies and do right by the game to purchase them, Agassi told reporters at the Pacific Life Open. I think theres a lot of people who could step up to help for sure ? Wimbledon being one and myself another. 

In a statement, the 50-year-old Borg said he had decided to put the items up for auction because he and his family need long-term financial security. 

Agassi, who won the 1992 Wimbledon title, was saddened by the news. 

Its not right, he said. The only way you should have a Wimbledon trophy is if you win it, not buy one. I cant make any judgements on Bjorn, but I can say that the thought of a Wimbledon trophy being in the hands of somebody who has a lot of money is upsetting. Wimbledon is the greatest tournament in the world. 

Agassi said he wants to ensure the trophies stay in tennis. The 35-year-old wouldnt reveal who he is working with, but did say hed like to see them put in a museum. 

I think it would be amazing for the fans of tennis to be able to see them, Agassi said.But first things first. Id like to see the sport come together to figure out a way to make sure they dont get into wrong hands. (Reuters)

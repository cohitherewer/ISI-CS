 Totti ready for battle

Duisburg: Italy forward Francesco Totti said on Friday that he was not yet fully fit but was still ready to start against Ghana in the Azzurris opening World Cup Group E game. 

I am at around 60-70 percent of my condition, Totti said after playing the second half of a training match on Friday. 

Like everyone, Im here to play and I feel ready to play. But it is down to the coach to make his decision and if he chooses not to play me I will accept that, said Totti. 

The forward, key to Italys hopes at the finals, has only recently returned from a three months absence following a broken ankle. I am happy to have got those 45 minutes in because the only way to get back to full form is through playing, said Totti who has only once managed to play a full 90 minutes since his injury in February.

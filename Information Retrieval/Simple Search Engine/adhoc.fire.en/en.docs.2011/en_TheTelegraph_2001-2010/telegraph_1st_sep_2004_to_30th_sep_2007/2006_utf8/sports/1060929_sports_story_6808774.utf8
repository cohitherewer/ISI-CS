 Mumbai banks on Shanghai factor

 - Week after Davis Cup not a problem, says Mahesh Bhupathi race For Shanghai

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Roger Federer

Mumbai: Mario Ancic was the only one among the top four seeds to have arrived in Mumbai well before the Kingfisher Airlines Open, the inaugural ATP event in Indias commercial capital, got underway. The other three Tommy Robredo, Tomas Berdych and Dmitry Tursunov all landed late on Monday or in the early hours of Tuesday. 

Ancic was lucky to get a week off because Croatia were not involved in Davis Cup action, either in the semis or World Group play-offs. 

But Tursunov turned in an epic performance to beat Andy Roddick and earn Russia a berth in the final, while Robredo and Berdych were part of the Spain and Czech Republic teams which beat Italy and Holland, respectively, to retain berths in next years World Group. 

All three wanted a Wednesday start this week and their wish was granted. Now if two of these men advance to Sundays final, both would have to play five consecutive days. Not a matter of joke for anyone, leave alone Europeans in sultry weather conditions. 

This is a dilemma tennis pros face: whether to play or rest the week after a Davis Cup tie. Robredo and Tursunov werent exactly complaining after winning their first matches, but did mention the difficulties of having to travel from Europe to Asia and then quickly adjust to entirely different conditions in Mumbai. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, the head of event owners Globosport and the man responsible for convincing top players to perform here, isnt however complaining about the scheduling of the Mumbai meet. 

 Rafael Nadal

 Firstly, its not in 

 my hands to get a slot on the ATP calendar in any case, 

 I am happy with this week. Why should I bother after seeing 

 three top-20 guys flying in after a tough Davis Cup weekend? 

 he told The Telegraph. 

One solid reason why these players are putting in that extra effort is the lure of qualifying for the prestigious (and lucrative) season-ending championship in Shanghai. The top eight in the ATP Champions Race will qualify for the Masters Cup to be held from November 13-19. 

Only two of the eight slots have been booked so far, by super Swiss Roger Federer and Spanish ace Rafael Nadal. The next eight, including top two seeds here Robredo and Ancic, are battling for the remaining six slots. 

Even players like Berdych and Tursunov have an outside chance, provided they can produce a string of excellent results in the six weeks before Shanghai. 

The race to reach Shanghai is well and truly on. None of the contenders can afford to take any tournament lightly and will go all out to win their matches to log in as many points as they can. 

As Robredo said the other day, if he can win most of his matches, hell make the cut. I am well placed at No. 6 in the Race. I dont have to keep an eye on those who are in pursuit as long as I can keep winning, the top-seeded Spaniard remarked. 

That is what Bhupathi is banking on. Good players will come even after playing Davis Cup because they want to strengthen chances of qualifying for Shanghai. 

 Good for Bhupathi. Good for Mumbai and India, too. 

 So what if we dont have one singles player in the 

 worlds top-200. Well at least be able to watch 

 some of the top guns firing from close quarters.

 RACE For SHANGHAI 

Already qualified: Roger Federer (1324 points), Rafael Nadal (825) 

 In the hunt: Andy Roddick (434), Ivan Ljubicic (420), Nikolay Davydenko (418), Tommy Robredo (374), David Nalbandian (370), Marcos Baghdatis (369), James Blake (365), Marion Ancic (339).

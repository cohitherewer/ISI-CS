 Sharper Italians 

 wore down fighting Germans

 Talking Tactics 

 PK Banerjee

 The 

 world saw on Tuesday night what footballing pedigree is 

 all about. Germany and Italy, three-time champions both, 

 clashed in the penultimate round of the 2006 World Cup and 

 produced a match worthy of a final. The better team won, 

 courtesy two high-quality goals at the fag end of extra-time. 

 But if I were to pick a winner from the duel in Dortmund, 

 it had to be the game of football.

 The most striking ? and amazing 

 ? thing about this match was the speed at which the two 

 sides operated for most of the 120 minutes. They attacked, 

 defended, counter-attacked each other at breathtaking pace. 

 There must have been 25 sorties by each side. Not all of 

 them resulted in clear openings at goal, in fact more half-chances 

 were created and missed than real sitters, but it was an 

 engrossing encounter all the same.

 Italy were more compact in defence, 

 sharper and better organised in attack. Cannavaro was the 

 central figure in an absolutely air-tight defence. In Nestas 

 absence, the Juventus stopper took it upon himself to block 

 every serious German threat.

 Just once in the two-hour battle 

 was Cannavaro not in position, giving Podolski a free header. 

 Luckily for Italy, the young German guided the ball wide 

 with just Buffon in front of him.

 If Cannavaro stood like the Rock 

 of Gibraltar, it was Pirlo who drove the Italian engine. 

 I cant remember seeing a midfielder working so hard 

 in a match of this level. He foiled German forays, initiated 

 Italian attacks, ran into free areas and wanted the ball 

 to be passed to him. In short, he never stopped running.

 The way Pirlo bluffed the German 

 defence and pushed a soft but measured pass to set up the 

 first goal for Grosso after 119 minutes, spoke of the mans 

 football intelligence. And the way the Palermo side-back 

 met the ball in motion and bent the left-footer into the 

 far corner ? we call it the rainbow shot ? past an airborne 

 Lehmann, it was finishing of the highest class.

 Lehmann had another brilliant 

 game, but cant be faulted for any of the goals. The 

 second one came off a typically fast counter-attack, when 

 the desperate Germans went up en masse to manufacture a 

 stoppage-time equaliser. This time, the classy final pass 

 came from Gilardino. He delayed releasing the ball to draw 

 two defenders to him before pushing it square for Del Piero 

 to run in and curl a right-footer into the far corner ? 

 this time to Lehmanns left.

 Italy, who were well served by 

 Zambrotta, Totti and Gattuso as well, should have scored 

 early in extra-time. First Gilardino fooled a tired Ballack 

 and shot to the base of the left post. A minute later, Zambrottas 

 power-packed right-footer thudded into the crosspiece.

 It was good to see Italy play 

 positively and look for goals, rather than stick to their 

 traditional defence-oriented and counter-attacking style. 

 The 4-1 thrashing of Germany in a friendly four months ago 

 seemed to have given Lippis men oodles of confidence.

 The Germans, on the other hand, 

 were wary of the famed Italian counter-attack and didnt 

 dare push enough men up field to aid Klose and Podolski. 

 Even Ballack was defending more than he normally does.

 Klose was totally bottled up by 

 Cannavaro and Materazzi, but Podolski did get two clear 

 looks at goal which he should have taken. The misdirected 

 header apart, he fired a left-footer straight at Buffon.

 The German dream may be over, 

 but they can be proud of their performance. Klinsmanns 

 team surprised quite a few experts during the course of 

 this championship and even on Tuesday night, fought like 

 only the Germans can: till the bitter end.

 It was just that they came up 

 against an inspired team which raised its level to championship 

 class for the first time in the tournament. Thank you, Germany, 

 and good luck Italy.

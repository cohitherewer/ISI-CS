Karachi: Beneath the Indian dressing room balcony, a young band of Indian supporters waited impatiently for Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Chants of Mahi, we love you, and Mahi we are here for you filled the air. 

Almost an hour after the match ended, the Jharkhand superstar emerged, kit bag in one hand, the other trying to keep his unsettled hair in place. The security barricade went haywire as the gang broke free in an effort to get a closer glimpse of their hero. 

Not just this group, there were another few hundreds, mostly Pakistanis, waiting near the team bus, to cheer Dhoni. He is not just a matchwinner, he is an enigma Pakistan have failed to solve in the Hutch Cup. Even Bob Woolmer admitted struggling to find ways to stop him. 

Todays unbeaten 77 from 56 balls is not my best. I think the Lahore knock was better. Nothing can beat the feeling of defeating Pakistan at their homeground, said Dhoni. 

Yuvraj Singh may have won the Man of the Match and Man of the Series for his brilliant unbeaten 107, despite battling a hamstring strain for the latter part of his innings, but it was Dhoni who really captured the imagination of the common man. 

With six boundaries and four huge sixes, he battered the Pakistan attack into submission. Dhoni used his bat like a AK47, firing bullets at will. 

Yuvrajs innings was another confirmation of his growing stature as the most dependable in the line-up on current form. The 93-ball knock included 15 fours. In the five matches, he totalled 344. 

The unbroken 146 the pair added for the third wicket reminded their super chase at the Gaddafi under lights a few days earlier. It was their brutal presence that singed the hosts and helped India clinch the series 4-1, the best showing in Pakistan ever. The 287-run target looked so easy. 

I wouldnt like to pick any of the four wins as the best, but todays was special in the sense that four of our regulars were not playing. Dhonis innings was just amazing, Greg Chappell told The Telegraph. 

This Indian side is now ready for any challenge. The presence or performance of individuals hardly matter, it is the team effort that counts. This is what Chappell has aimed for and is starting to achieve. 

Having decided to rest Sachin Tendulkar and Irfan Pathan (Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh have gone home), the Indians did not panic. Each individual contributed in their own way, which made Sundays success possible. 

Pakistan seemed physically and mentally drained. It will take a while for them to recover from the humiliation they were subjected to in their own backyard. 

If Asif Iqbal is to be believed, Sreesanth and Suresh Raina are the future stars of Indian cricket. Sreesanth proved himself with a disciplined spell in Multan and followed it up with a career-best four for 58 Sunday. 

He did not open the attack but came as first-change and troubled the batsmen with his late movement and persistent line. He showed his talent in this series and this experience will carry him a long way in near future. 

Pakistans problem has been their batting and the way some of the batsmen surrendered their wickets. According to Asif, Inzamams fitness will decide his future. 

The way the Pakistan captain stopped short of being run out on a couple of occasions on Sunday does focus on the need to set things right. His failures have also been reflected in the teams overall showing. 

Inzamam was right in saying that fielding decided the series. The way catches were dropped ? Sami dropped a sitter off Gambhir ? and runs given away, proves that the team needs to work on their physical abilities. 

Pakistan were fortunate enough to see Mohammed Yousuf (67 off 85 balls, 6x4) and Younis Khan carry on the good work after the top-order failure. While Yousufs return to form ahead of the Sri Lanka tour does augur well for the team, Younis unbeaten 74 (79 balls, 3x4, 2x6) once again puts forward Imran Khans argument to promote him in the batting order. 

The pair added 95 in 110 balls for the fifth wicket, the only notable partnership in the innings. In the end it, however, seemed even a couple more wouldnt have been enough to escape the Yuvraj-Dhoni onslaught.

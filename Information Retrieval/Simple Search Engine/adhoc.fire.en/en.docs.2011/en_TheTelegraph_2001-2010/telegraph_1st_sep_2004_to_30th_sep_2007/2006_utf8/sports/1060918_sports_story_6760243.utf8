 Sanaa Bhambri upset Sabine Lisicki 

Calcutta: The $175,000 WTA Sunfeast Open will witness as many as five Indians in the main draw. 

Two more Indian qualifiers made it to the tournament proper on Sunday, with Sanaa Bhambri causing another upset by beating higher-ranked Sabine Lisicki of Germany 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 and Rushmi Chakravarthy getting the better of compatriot Tara Iyer 7-5, 6-4. The veteran Tamil Nadu player will take on the formidable Sania Mirza. 

Sanaa, on a high after getting the better of two fancied opponents, faces a tough tie against world No.321 Angelique Widjaja of Indonesia, whos coming fresh of a moderate outing in Bali. 

The other two qualifying spots went to Iroda Tulyaganova of Ukraine and Chia-Jung Chuang of Chinese Taipei. Fresh from their victories, they will lock horns in the first round. 

Hot favourite Iroda walloped Sandy Gumulya of Indonesia 6-1, 6-3, while Chuang defeated Sandhya Nagaraj of India 7-6 (7-4), 6-4. 

Sanaas tactics of slowing down the game seemed to upset Lisicki, who was visibly tired and called for the trainer midway into the second set.

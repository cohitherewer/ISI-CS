 Faridabad: Having gone 2-0 up in the ODI series, Rahul Dravid shed off his defensive posture. While defending his team members, including the batting of Virender Sehwag, the Indian skipper said his batsmen did well under the given conditions. 

It was not easy to bat on a wicket like this, Dravid said. Chasing 226 was difficult. Yet, we did it. Dont forget that at the end of the day, the batsmen won the match for India, he said it like a polite reminder. 

It was Indias 14th straight win chasing a target this season, equalling the West Indies feat in the mid-80s. 

Dravid said it was a special occasion for him. It is very satisfying. It gives us confidence to know that we can struggle and still go on to win, particularly given that we were considered to be bad chasers not a long while ago .

Dravid said he believed the new crop of players would bring more success to India. Thats what I have been talking about all these days. Youngsters like Raina, Yuvi (Yuvraj) and Dhoni will bring more glory for the country. We have been trying to create a good environment in the dressing room so that these boys develop further. 

The Indian captain was not ready to buy the theory that Sehwag dished out a below par performance again. I think he batted quite well. There were some positive signs, his foot movement was good and he played some good shots but was unfortunate to get out. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff felt that given the nature of the wicket, 226 was a good total, but Raina and Dhoni took the match away. He defended his decision of going in with one spinner, saying the team was picked keeping in mind the conditions.

 Kapur in tied 29th spot

Singapore: After a disastrous start, Shiv Kapur recovered to card one-under 71 to be tied 29th, the best among seven Indians, at the $1 million Sinagpore Open here on Thursday. 

Singaporean Mardan Mamat, former Indian Open winner, shot the days best of seven-under 65 with eight birdies and one bogey. 

Amandeep Johl (72), in 43rd place. Gaurav Ghei finished at one-over 73 and was in tied 64th place. Jyoti Randhawa, with just two birdies was two-over 74 in 92nd place, while Jeev Milkha Singh went three over for a 75 and Rahil Gangjee shot a 77 and Harmeet Kahlon a 78. 

Kapur, currently having a fairly good first season on the European Tour, opened on the tenth with two bogeys. 

I hit a bad drive on the first hole (the 10th) and lost the ball and made bogey. And the second hole, I hit my second shot just left of the green in the rough and lost the ball and had to walk back. Then I went through a stretch of four straight birdies from 14th to 17th. (PTI)

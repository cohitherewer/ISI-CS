 Doha pairing surprises Bhupathi

Mumbai: Sania Mirzas pairing with Leander Paes for the Doha Asian Games has upset Mahesh Bhupathi. 

Of course, I am surprised, Bhupathi said. Im not sure whose decision it was. All I know is that everybody is pretending its the other persons decision but I know I wasnt consulted, Bhupathi said, reacting to Sanias comment that it was an AITA decision. 

Bhupathi, however, added that what counted most at the end of the day was the gold medal and that he would not want the issue to cloud his partnership with Paes at the Games. 

Thats one place where Im playing with Leander. Were looking forward to bringing home the gold medal, he said on a TV channel. 

Paes and Bhupathi had won the doubles gold at the 2002 Busan Asian Games. In mixed doubles, Paes and Sania, who was all of 15 then, had managed a bronze medal. 

AITA selection committee chairman Shyam Minotra said although the body picks the players, the pairing is done by the captain and individual players themselves.

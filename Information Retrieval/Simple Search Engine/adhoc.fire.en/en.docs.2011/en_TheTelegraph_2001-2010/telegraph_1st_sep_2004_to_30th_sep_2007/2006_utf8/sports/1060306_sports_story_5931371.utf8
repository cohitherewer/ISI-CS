 Dravid relishes giving England a little 

 scare

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Nagpur: Following an extraordinary attempt to make the improbable look nearly probable, Rahul Dravid admitted on Sunday that Team India were out to give England a little scare on the final day of the first Test. And the genesis of all this lied in a brief meeting in the dressing room during the tea break. 

We were at 131 for one at tea and discussed the situation in the dressing room. And we thought we would give England a little scare, the Team India captain said after the match, which ended in a stalemate, but with plenty of excitement. Dravid believed a little more of Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the crease might have made the chase a reality. 

Chasing 368 on a final day wicket, which was slow and low, was always a challenge and its never going to be easy. But if Dhoni or Irfan has a good day, you can never say, Dravid later maintained. But looking back, we could have gone for it 40 minutes earlier, he conceded. 

The captain, however, made it clear that he had full support for both Harbhajan Singh and Virender Sehwag, who struggled in the match in both innings. 

The spinners didnt get as much bounce as we had anticipated. Its easy to be critical but Harbhajan is a proven performer for us, he said. 

About the opener, who made 2 and 0, the captains take was: Viru is kind of a batsman who tends to go through a few low scores and then come up with a big match-winning knock. He will have a few lean patches and you have got to accept that sometimes. 

Dravid also praised Wasim Jaffer and Mohammed Kaif for their contribution to the teams cause here. Wasim played two lovely knocks He has been out of international cricket for quite sometime. He performed well in domestic cricket and earned his place. 

Hopefully, this will kick-start a successful career for him, he remarked about the Mumbai opener. 

Stressing that there were quite a few positives for his team from the match, Dravid maintained that he would go in Mohali with a good spirit. But if we need to take 20 wickets, we need to do better, he added. 

He, however, had some words of warning as well. A week back, England had a lot of problems. This just goes to show that they are a good team and weve to get ready for the challenge, he observed. 

If it was a move to go back to the board room for Dravid, his English counterpart paid tribute to his young side. This is our youngest side in 40 years. The lads character and calmness was simply superb, Andrew Flintoff said. Even if India decided throwing the bat around the bowlers stuck to the basics, and we even might have won it.

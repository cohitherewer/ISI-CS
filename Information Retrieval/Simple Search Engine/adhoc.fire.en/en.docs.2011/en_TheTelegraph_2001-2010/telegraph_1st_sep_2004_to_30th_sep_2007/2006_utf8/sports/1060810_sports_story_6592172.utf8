 Gupta goes down to Sharma

Panaji: Rajasthans International Master and GM norm holder Abhijit Gupta went down to Umakanth Sharma of Jharkhand in the fifth round of the Hirabai Salgaocar Fide Rating tournament held at Miramar on Wednesday. 

Sharma employed the Richter Rauzer attack in the Sicilian defence and subsequently the game took on a very complicated demeanour. After 49 moves, Gupta resigned. 

Gupta who has been in top form, had recently completed his first GM norm in Andorra. 

In another exciting game, Goan youngster Shubham Pinge drew with world U-12 champion N. Srinath. 

Srinath went in for the attack by employing the ultra sharp Benko Gambit. However, Pinge seemed to have an answer for everything that Srinath threw at him. 

The queens were eventually exchanged and the match was subsequently drawn. This is the second time in the tournament that a world champion has been forced to draw against a Goan youngster. 

Unrated Celianne Carvalho continued her fine run by holding British player Jessica Abrame to a draw. With the queens gambit declined, both the players did not really seem keen to take up the cudgels and the peace treaty was signed hurriedly in just 22 moves. 

Manmesh Naik also did well to hold Charudatta Desai in a French defence which ended in 60 moves and is now certain of a decent initial rating when the Fide list is released in October. (PTI)

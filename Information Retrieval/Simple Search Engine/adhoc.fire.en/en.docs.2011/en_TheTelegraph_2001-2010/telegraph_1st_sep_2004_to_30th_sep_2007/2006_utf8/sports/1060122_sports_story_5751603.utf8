The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal chug past Baroda total

 - RANJI SEMI-FINALS 

 Subhamoy (115) gets a century after five years 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Subhamoy Das celebrates his century at the Eden on Saturday 

Calcutta: A week ago, Subhamoy Das was struggling to retain his place in the Bengal squad. Runs had dried up and his confidence hit rock-bottom. It was almost a do-or-die battle for him in the second innings against Railways. An accomplished 83 paved the way for Bengals semi-final entry and put him back in the reckoning. 

That it was no flash in the pan was confirmed at the Eden on Saturday with an innings of superb application and temperament. His 115 not only helped the hosts take the first innings lead against Baroda, but also put them in a position of strength. The visitors, five runs in arrears at the close, will need to dismiss the remaining five batsmen in the first session to harbour hopes of a turnaround. 

This was only his third century in Ranji Trophy and came after a gap of five years. The composed knock took 312 minutes and included 15 boundaries. 

There is still a lot of cricket left? Its a five-day game and there are three more days to go, a confident Balwinder Singh Sandhu said. 

The former India seamer and Baroda coach added: Remember Bengal have to bat last on this wicket. We did well with whatever we had in hand. I will give some allowance to the inexperienced bowlers on a wicket where there was very purchase for them. Hopefully in the second innings, the bowlers will be in a better position to make use of the conditions. 

The wicket hasnt shown any sign of deterioration, apart from the usual wear and tear, but the slowness will make batting difficult. 

Bengal were reduced to 10 for two in the morning, Rakesh Patel sending back Arindam Das and Avishek Jhunjhunwala for noughts. Subhamoy and Manoj Tewari (35) then added 98 runs for the third wicket to restore some order. 

Sandhus candid admission to Subhamoy at the end of the day that his plan against the batsman failed miserably tells the entire story. With supreme confidence, he went about his task of negating whatever the bowlers had on offer. There were some rasping drives on both sides of the wicket, besides a few delicate hits behind square. 

Tewari was unlucky to be dismissed, the ball ricocheting off the wicketkeepers pads into the hands of first slip. Kamal Hasan Mondal wouldnt like to remember his debut for long. 

Deep Dasgupta played a useful innings at a very critical stage. The Bengal captain showed resolve in reaching his half-century in 169 minutes with six boundaries. He timed the ball well and a straight drive off Irfan Pathan in the final session was the highlight of the innings. The unbroken 55-run partnership with Laxmi Ratan Shukla ensured Bengal get past the 214-run mark. 

It was an uncharacteristic knock from the Bengal allrounder (22 in 62 balls) and he will need to stay at the wicket with Deep in an effort to extend the lead. There was very little of note in the bowling apart from Patels opening spell. The spinners, Rajesh Pawar and Yusuf Pathan, bowled well only in spells, but never looked threatening.

 Chawla stars in colts 

82-run win

 Chawla 

Lahore: The Indian Under-19 team trounced Pakistan colts by 82 runs in the first one-dayer at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Tuesday. 

The Indians, who had won the preceding two-match Test series by huge margins, scored 250 in the allotted 50 overs before dismissing Pakistan for 168 in 39.4 overs. 

Skipper Piyush Chawla took three for 38 and pacer Ishant Sharma three for 31 to star in Indias commendable win. 

The home side had made nine changes to their squad for the one-day series, but it did not seem to have helped their cause. 

Earlier, Uday Kaul made 67 and Sanjeev Sharma 65 to give their side a fighting total. 

After the loss of two early wickets, the left-handed Kaul batted confidently, hitting seven fours in his 90-ball knock while Sanjeev hit two fours and three sixes from 75 balls. Chawla, a centurion in the last Test, contributed 43 from 25 balls and Ravindra Jadeja made 32.

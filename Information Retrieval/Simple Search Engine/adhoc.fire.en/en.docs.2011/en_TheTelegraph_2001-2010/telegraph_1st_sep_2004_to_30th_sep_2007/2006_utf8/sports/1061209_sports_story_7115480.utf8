 French fans challenge Cup final result 

Paris: France soccer fans still fuming over defeat in last Julys World Cup final, took their grievance to court on Thursday in a bid to prove match officials wrongly sent off captain Zinedine Zidane. 

Zidanes red card, after he butted Italian defender Marco Materazzi in the chest, was the turning point in a tight match in Berlin that ended in a win for Italy on penalties. 

Two Paris-based groups calling themselves the National Collective for Truth on the Final of the 2006 World Cup and World Cup Justice 2006, filed a suit against the French soccer federation and world governing body Fifa. 

Their lawyer Mehana Mouhou said match officials relied on video evidence of Zidanes attack, which he said was against Fifa rules that require officials to witness incidents directly. 

Lawyers for the French federation and Fifa dismissed the case as a publicity stunt and a judgement is expected on December 15.

London: Amelie Mauresmo won an emotional first Wimbledon singles title on Saturday, recovering from a torrid start to beat Justine Henin-Hardenne 2-6, 6-3, 6-4. 

The world No. 1, who also took this years Australian Open when a sick Henin-Hardenne retired, is the first Frenchwoman to win here since Suzanne Lenglen in 1925. 

It feels great. I had a great two weeks, Mauresmo said. I definitely wanted this win today. I dont want anyone to talk about my nerves anymore. 

Defeat denied French Open champion Henin-Hardenne the only Grand Slam title missing from her collection. 

She played better than me, she was just too good today, said the Belgian. Im pretty tired but its been a couple of good weeks for me. 

Henin-Hardenne came out firing on all cylinders on a sunlit Centre Court to blaze through the first set in just 31 minutes. The third seed, runner-up here five years ago, seized control when she broke an ill-at-ease Mauresmo in the first game of the match with a flowing volley. Then Mauresmo turned the match around. 

Top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan completed a career Grand Slam when they beat No. 6 seeds Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2 to win the mens doubles crown. 

The American twins joined Dutch duo Jacco Eltingh-Paul Haarhuis and Aussie pair Mark Woodforde-Todd Woodbridge as only the third doubles team to win all four Grand Slam titles in the professional era. 

The Indian challenge came to an end when Rupesh Roy and Hsin Han Lee (Chinese Taipei) lost 3-6, 7-6 (7-4) 3-6 in the boys doubles semis to Slovak pair Martin Klizan and Andrei Martin. 

The second seeds will take on US Kellen Damico and Nathaniel Schnugg.

 Vaughans captaincy scare

London: Michael Vaughan feels that his prolonged absence from the England team might mean that he wouldnt get another opportunity to captain the side again. 

Thats the one thing that scares me most, that I wont get an opportunity to do that again, said Englands regular captain, in an interview to a London daily. 

Vaughan, who last year led England to their first Ashes series victory 1986-87, also said: I would like to think that the team would allow me to return and be their leader. If I get fit again, whether its this week, two weeks or in four weeks. 

Id like to think that Id done enough to get another opportunity if I come back. That is the most important thing.

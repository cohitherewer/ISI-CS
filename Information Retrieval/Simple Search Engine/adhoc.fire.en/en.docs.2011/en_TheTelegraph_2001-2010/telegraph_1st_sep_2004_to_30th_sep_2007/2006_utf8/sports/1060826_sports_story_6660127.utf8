Colombo: Archers Jayanta Talukdar and Dola Banerjee ensured a double triumph for India by winning the recurve individual gold medals at the SAF Games here on Friday. 

National champion Talukdar held nerve to pip compatriot Tarundeep Rai 111-110. Dola outshot teammate Reena Kumari 108-99. 

Anju Bobby George, on her return to competition, struck gold, as did Pinki Pramanik who romped home in the 400m in 52.54 seconds. But the Indian hockey team lost 2-3 to Pakistan who finished first. 

World No. 8 Anju expectedly won the womens long jump event but the winning effort of 6.42m well below her personal best of 6.83m did not please the athlete. 

I am certainly not happy with my performance. I am competing for the first time since may, was all that Anju had to say after the disappointing show. 

Anju, one of the very few high-profile athletes in the fray at these Games, was banking on a good performance to book a ticket to the World Cup in Greece next month. 

The best performer from every discipline gets to represent the continent in the elite event, and Anjus performance was way inferior to the 6.86m by Japans Kumiko Ikeda. 

Indias other athletics golds came from Anuradha Biswal (100m hurdles), Saurabh Vij (shot put), Preeja Sridharan (10,000m) and the mens 4x100 relay team. 

In the hockey clash, Pakistan took the lead in the fifth minute through Shabbir Ahmed. 

The Indian team, comprising mainly of under-21 players, went all out for the equaliser and got it in the 35th minute when Sardara Singh found the net. 

Imran Warsi then scored twice as India crumbled under pressure. 

A last-ditch effort by India earned a goal through Vikram Kanth in the 60th minute. 

In shooting, the promising Harveen Srao led the medal hunt as India scooped five out of six golds on offer. 

Srao won the honours in womens 10m air pistol with a new Games record of 480.5 (382+98.5) points. Nausheen Fatima bagged the silver with 474.8 (377+97.6). 

The top two scores, in combination with the 369 shot by Shilpi Singh, also gave India the team gold. Veteran Ashok Pandit bagged gold in 25m centre fire pistol mens event with a total of 570. (PTI)

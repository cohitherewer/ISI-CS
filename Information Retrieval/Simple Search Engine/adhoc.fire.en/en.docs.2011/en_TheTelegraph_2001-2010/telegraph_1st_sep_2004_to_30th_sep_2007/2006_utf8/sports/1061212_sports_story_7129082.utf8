The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia to continue 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The Doha Asian Games turned out not to have been Bhaichung Bhutias swansong. 

The India captain said on Monday that he was still enjoying wearing the national colours and would con- tinue playing under Bob Houghton. 

While in Doha, Bhaichung had hinted at retiring after the Asian Games. 

Let me go back to Calcutta and talk to my wife first I would be more than happy if a deserving player takes my place, the ace striker said then. 

Back in the city, and having paired up with Jose Ramirez Barreto once again for Mohun Bagan, Bhai- chung has now changed his mind. 

I have spoken to my wife and family. And they inspired me to continue. As long as I enjoy representing the country, Ill continue, he said. 

Bhaichung is also confident that Mohun Bagan will fare well in the IFA Shield. We are a very good side and well improve as the days go by, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont want a repeat of 2003

 - Masters Cup 

 Injured Paes determined to win battle against time 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Calcutta: Leander Paes is battling against time to be fit for the season-ending Masters Cup Doubles Championship in Shanghai. 

The tennis icon is nursing a finger which he hurt at the Madrid Masters about two weeks ago. It was quite a freakish injury, Paes throwing the racket which bounced off the surface to hit his right hand. 

Scans and MRIs have been done and those have revealed no broken bones Its a hyper-extension of the right index finger, Paes told The Telegraph. 

Such injuries take three-four weeks to heal. With the Shanghai Masters Cup beginning on November 13, the Indian will just about get that minimum time to recover. 

There wouldnt have been any worries had the injury been on the non-playing hand. Yes, I have to be careful as it is the right hand, but the doctors are saying Ill be able to play in Shanghai, said Paes. 

Indeed, he is very determined to feature in the prestigious event (with Czech partner Martin Damm) after having ensured a berth well in advance. Only the top eight teams in the world get the right to play in the season-ending championship. 

Paes remembers, ruefully, how he had missed out competing in the 2003 Masters Championship despite having earned a ticket with David Rikl, another Czech. That was the year a potentially life-threatening brain lesion laid him low for the last three months of the season. 

Its never a good feeling to sit out of such a big event even after qualifying I wouldnt want a repeat of that, Paes said from Mumbai. 

Logging enough wins and points to make it to the elite eight-team field is in itself a tough ask. Paes has done it eight times in the last 10 years. And, even more significantly, with four different partners. 

On five of those occasions, Paes did it with Mahesh Bhupathi (1997, 98, 99, 2000 and 01). Rikl was his partner in 2003, Nenad Zimonjic last year and Damm this time around. 

None of the eight visits has, however, culminated in ultimate glory. Paes has featured in four finals (three of which were with Bhupathi) but not managed to cross that most crucial hurdle. Last year Zimo (Zimonjic) and I came mighty close before losing in a third set tie-break to (Fabrice) Santoro and (Michael) Llodra, the Olympic bronze-medallist recalled. 

Indias most versatile tennis player of the last two decades is very much aware of this one piece of silverware missing from his cabinet. Ive got one more chance to win it (the Masters Cup) this year there will be no dearth of motivation for Martin and me in Shanghai. 

For a moment, it didnt seem like Paes had a dodgy finger to contend with.

 Federer not taking anything for granted

London: After failing narrowly in his attempt to match Rod Laver and Don Budge, world number one Roger Federer will seek consolation by trying to emulate two more tennis greats when he starts the third defence of his Wimbledon title next week. 

If he wins again at the All England Club, the Swiss will join American Pete Sampras and Swede Bjorn Borg as the only men to win four consecutive titles at the grasscourt Grand Slam in the professional era. 

Federer has a year to stew over his poor display against Rafael Nadal in the French Open final on June 11 when months of careful preparations came to nothing as he once again failed in his bid to complete the full set of Grand Slams achieved by Laver and Budge. 

As he showed last week, though, success has not affected the Swiss work ethic. Even Federers fitness coach told him it would be understandable if he did not defend his Halle title following his exhausting and ultimately disappointing campaign on the Paris clay. 

Instead, Federer won five tough grasscourt matches to flush the red dirt out of his system, and in beating Czech Tomas Berdych in Sundays final he equalled Borgs record grasscourt winning streak of 41 matches. He (fitness coach Pierre Paganini) wasnt too sure whether I should play but I told him that I would like to. He couldnt believe that I came through. For me, thats a sign of my physical and mental strength paying off. I have never been as fit as today. Im back in top shape and thats important for the rest of the season. 

But I dont think that matches are decided by physical fitness, but rather mentally. It can be very frustrating on grass, because you dont get a lot of chances. If you miss your chance, it can be very frustrating. 

Sampras was the last man to win four straight titles at Wimbledon in 2000. 

Berdych, though, echoed the views of the majority on the mens Tour when he suggested Federer was pretty much unbeatable on grass. 

The Swiss finds the suggestion almost insulting. Its easy for him to say. I have to start an entire tournament from scratch. Obviously he doesnt quite understand how tough a Grand Slam tournament is. Its easy to come once in your career into the quarters, but to do it on a consistent level is a different question. (Reuters)

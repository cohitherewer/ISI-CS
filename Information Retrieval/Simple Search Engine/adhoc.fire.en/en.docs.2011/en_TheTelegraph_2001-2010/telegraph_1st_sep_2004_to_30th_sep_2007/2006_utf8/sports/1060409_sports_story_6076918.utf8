Augusta: The booming gallery roars that usually punctuate these annual proceedings were not as loud or as plentiful Friday at the 70th Masters. As the wind kicked up shortly after noon, Augusta National toughened up even more, and agonizing groans became the operative sound of the day. 

By the end of play on Friday, Texan Chad Campbell, 31, sat atop the leaderboard, having taken advantage of the mornings dead calm to shoot a five-under-par 67 and 36-hole total of six-under 138. Hell take a three-shot lead into a weekend that promises to frazzle the nerve endings of the 47 survivors who made the cut of four-over 148. 

I dont think theres anything to celebrate yet, said Campbell, who three years ago was selected in a poll of his peers as one of the 20-somethings most likely to succeed on the PGA Tour. I havent really accomplished much. Theres a lot of golf left. 

 Though first-round leader Vijai Singh hardly looked like the No. 2 player in the world with three double bogeys through his first 13 holes, he avoided a total meltdown with birdies on two of his last four for a 74. Singh was tied for second at three-under 141 with 1992 champion Fred Couples (70) and Rocco Mediate (73). 

Not too many good things were happening early on for Tiger Woods, the defending champion aiming for his fifth Masters title and the 11th Major championship. With two bogeys in his first four holes and another at the brutally difficult 505-yard 11th, Woods also was heading in the wrong direction. But he made two-putt birdies at the 510-yard 13th and 530-yard 15th and parred in for a 71 and one-under 143. 

Im in good shape, said Woods, who has won all 10 of his Majors with a third-round lead. Today was really tough out there ? windy, swirly. A good shot would end up in a bad spot, and you just had to accept the consequences. Today at the fourth hole, I hit a six-iron, and a gust of wind came up and put me in a bunker. The wind was all over the place, changing all the time. You just hope you can time it right. 

While Woods was lamenting at least four missed putts of less than 10 feet, Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els also were moaning about lost opportunities. 

Playing together over the first two days, they were both in a group of five tied for fifth at two-under 142. And Retief Goosen, the two-time US Open champion, was among seven players tied for tenth at one-under 143.

 Dhoni promises to continue fireworks

 Dhoni

 Ranchi: After his splendid show against Pakistan, wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni Wednesday promised to carry his form into the three-Test series against England, beginning early next month. 

Dhoni said he was all set to take on the Englishmen, but admitted that the visitors could not be taken lightly. 

The conditions may suit us but England cannot be taken lightly, said Dhoni when asked to comment on Indias prospects in the three-Test series beginning on March 1. 

I will try my best to continue performing as I did against Pakistan, said the dashing Jharkhand cricketer. 

Asked about his batting heroics on the Pakistan tour, Dhoni said he had benefitted with tips from coach Greg Chappell and his senior colleagues. 

The tips given by the coach and the senior players improved my game a lot, said Dhoni, who returned to his hometown Tuesday to a rousing welcome. 

Dhoni, who was instrumental in Indias emphatic 4-1 win in the one-day series over Pakistan along with Yuvraj Singh, totalled 219 runs at an average of 219 and an explosive strike rate of 136.87. (PTI)

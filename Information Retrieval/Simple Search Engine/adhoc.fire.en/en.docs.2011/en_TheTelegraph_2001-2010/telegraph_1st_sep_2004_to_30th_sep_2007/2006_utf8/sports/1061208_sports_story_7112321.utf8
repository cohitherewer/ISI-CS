London: Manchester United, Arsenal, FC Porto and Lille qualified for the second round of the Champions League on Wednesday, completing the 16-team field for the first knockout stage. 

Manchester United rallied to a 3-1 win over Benfica, the team that eliminated the English club from last seasons competition, and Arsenal and Porto both advanced after a 0-0 draw. Lille beat AC Milan 2-0 to join the Italian club in the next round. 

The four clubs join defending champion FC Barcelona and AS Roma, who qualified Wednesday. Ten others had already qualified: Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Inter Milan, Liverpool, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia, Lyon, Real Madrid, Celtic and AC Milan. 

Werder Bremen, Spartak Moscow, Bordeaux, Shakhtar Donetsk, Steaua Bucharest, Benfica, CSKA Moscow and AEK Athens all finished third in their groups. 

Dynamo Kiev held Real Madrid 2-2 and Lyon and Steaua Bucharest drew 1-1. 

Benfica scored first, with Nelson curling the ball high into the Manchester United net in the 27th minute after taking a cross from Simao. 

The Red Devils pushed hard for an equaliser and got it in first-half injury time when Nemanja Vidic scored with a header off a free kick by Ryan Giggs. 

Cristiano Ronaldo set up Giggs to head in Uniteds second goal in the 61st, and Louis Saha headed in Uniteds third in the 75th.

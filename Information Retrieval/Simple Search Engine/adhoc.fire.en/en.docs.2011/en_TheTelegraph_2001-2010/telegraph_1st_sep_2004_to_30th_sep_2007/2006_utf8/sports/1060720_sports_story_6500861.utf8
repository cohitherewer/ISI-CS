 Kapur aims to play all four rounds

 - Opportunity to show I can stack up against the best 

 Shiv Kapur 

Hoylake (Liverpool): Shiv Kapur will look to play all the four rounds as he makes his debut appearance at the oldest major in the world ? the British Open ? on Thursday. 

Kapur knows that the open is a tremendous opportunity to showcase his skills and make up for what has been a poor run of form of late. 

Im playing the best players in the world and its an opportunity to showcase what I have and show that I can stack up against the best, he said. 

The last few months have been a lean patch for me. But the game is feeling good again. Ive got this week, next week in Germany and the World Golf Championship Bridgestone Invitational coming up over the next month and it will be an exciting time, he said. 

One of my goals this week is to play four rounds. But the key is to go out there and play well, especially on a golf course like this. If I play well, a lot can happen. Itll be nice to be somewhere in contention, said Kapur, who joins Gaurav Ghei, Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa as the only Indians to play at the Open. 

The only one to make the cut so far is Randhawa, who is also the only Indian to have played here three times. Kapur hopes to follow in those footsteps and hopefully do even better. 

The majors are what it is all about, say the pros. The last time Kapur turned up at a major was in 2004 and he kept waiting and in the end all he managed was almost 5,000 hits at the driving range. Then flew back as he failed to get in despite being the first alternative at the US Open. 

This year he is in there with a confirmed place, one which he earned by finishing third ? winning a play-off ? at the international final qualifiers in Singapore in April. 

Kapur admits to feeling like a celebrity. But he is not letting the occasion or the awe of the setting to get to him. He has been signing autographs alright and even visited the family his caddie Neeraj Sareen is staying with. 

The 24-year-old Delhi golfer has enjoyed a meteoric rise on the Asian Tour since turning professional 18 months ago. 

This year, he has continued to sparkle with three top-15s and has impressed the likes of former US Masters champion Fred Couples, who said Kapur reminded him of Justin Leonard. Last week, the young Indian played in all four rounds of the Barclays Scottish Open. 

Hes got his future ahead of him. I like his temperament. He hits the ball really solid. Hes not long, hes not short. Hes like Justin Leonard. I like the way he plays and I think he will do really well (in his career), said Couples, who played with Kapur at the Johnnie Walker Classic in Perth earlier this year. (PTI)

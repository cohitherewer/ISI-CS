 BCCI files petition in High Court

OUR LEGAL REPORTER AMP; PTI

Calcutta: The BCCI on Monday filed a petition in the High Court challenging the interim order of the City Civil Court directing the board not to proceed with the showcause notice issued by it against former board president Jagmohan Dalmiya till disposal of the case. 

S.K. Bajoria, counsel for BCCI moved a plea before the division bench of Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice P.N. Sinha seeking the leave of the court to allow him to move petition against the trial courts order. 

The case will come up for hearing on Thursday before the division bench of Justice Bhattacharya and Justice Sinha. The board will seek an order from the High Court allowing it to continue the proceedings against the former board president. 

Dalmiyas counsel Siddhartha Shankar Ray had moved the petition before the City Civil judge on Wednesday saying that, The BCCI asked my client to explain why he issued cheques for Rs 39.41 lakh when the balance in Pilcom (Pakistan-India-Lanka Committee) account was only Rs 17.67 lakh. The BCCI granted seven days for giving his explanation. Even though he gave his explanation on time, the BCCI on February 27 issued the showcause notice. 

But as BCCIs counsel moved the petition without annexing the certified copy of the order of the trail court, the bench asked the lawyer to file a petition after obtaining the copy from the City Civil Court. 

Later in the day, Bajoria managed to file the appeal before the filing section of the court. 

Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, who was in the city with board lawyer denied Dalmiyas charge that a witchhunt was being carried out against him and said that allegations of serious nature needed to be probed to unearth the truth. 

There is no question of any witchhunt against anybody. During Dalmiyas tenure also lot of investigations were conducted against several BCCI members. When allegations of such serious nature have been made, they need to be probed. If nothing comes out, then that will be the end of it, Shah said.

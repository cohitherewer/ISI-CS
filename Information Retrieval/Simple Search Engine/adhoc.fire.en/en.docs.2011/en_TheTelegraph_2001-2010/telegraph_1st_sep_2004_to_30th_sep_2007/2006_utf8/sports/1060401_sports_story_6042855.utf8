Miami: Roger Federer fired his way into the semi-finals of the Miami Masters on Thursday but Andy Roddick ran out of firepower and womens world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo fired blanks. 

Maria Sharapova advanced to the final after her French opponent Tatiana Golovin was forced to retire due to an ankle injury. 

Federer swept past James Blake for the second time in a month with a 7-6, 6-4 win for his 46th straight win on US soil and 25th consecutive victory against an American player. 

There were tough conditions and I handled them well, Federer told reporters, referring to the swirling wind. 

The Swiss world No. 1 will next face Spains David Ferrer, who pulled off a 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 upset of Roddick to prolong the Americans career crisis. 

Mauresmos bid to reach the Miami final disintegrated as she was hammered 1-6, 4-6 in the semis by Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

Kuznetsova capitalised on 29 unforced errors from the Australian Open champion, who was erratic throughout the 78-minute contest. 

She struck 33 winners and denied Mauresmo three second-set break chances as the top seed struggled to get into the contest. 

Mauresmo saved two match points before suffering only her fourth defeat of the season. 

Kuznetsova will face Sharapova in Saturdays final after the latters semi-final opponent, Golovin, rolled her ankle and had to retire from an enthralling contest. 

Sharapova took the first set 6-3 but the French teenager battled back to take the second 7-6. The 18-year-old was then forced to retire in obvious pain with Sharapova leading 4-3 in the third. 

Meanwhile, Indias Sania Mirza and her Serbian partner Ana Ivanovic lost in the doubles quarter finals. 

Sania and Ana handed an easy 7-5, 6-0 victory to eighth seeds Shinobu Asagoe of Japan and Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia.

 Scolari offered England job

 - Imminent appointment appears to be a case of if you cant beat them, recruit them 

 HENRY WINTER

 Liuz Felipe Scolari 

Luiz Felipe Scolari, the coach of Portugal, was on Wednesday night offered the job of England manager by Brian Barwick, the chief executive of the Football Association. Barwick flew to Lisbon to meet Scolari on Wednesday evening with the full blessing of the Portuguese Football Association and an appointment is imminent. 

[Barwick flew back to London on Thursday from Lisbon after talks with Scolari, but refused to say if the ex-Brazil coach had been offered job, according to a Reuters report from London. 

[Walking off the flight, Barwick said: I think it is well evident now that we were in Lisbon speaking to Luiz Felipe Scolari as part of the process of recruiting the next coach and that process continues.] 

Although FA sources indicated Wednesday night that nothing had been signed or sealed, the fact that company secretary Simon Johnson also jetted to Portugal signalled the FAs intent to land the Brazilian, who has proved Englands nemesis in recent tournaments. 

This was Scolaris third interview and senior FA figures would not have travelled to Lisbon unless they had quelled the rebellion from the Little Englanders within the FA and decided on the Brazilian. In his main interview with the FA two weeks ago, Scolari impressed with his personality and grasp of tactics, although he will need to improve his English. 

His appointment is a victory for David Dein, the Arsenal vice-chairman and FA dignitary who lobbied hard for Scolari. 

Dein was not even on the original FA sub-committee charged with finding Sven-Goran Erikssons successor. 

The appointment of Scolari appears a case of if you cant beat them, recruit them. Scolari masterminded Brazils defeat of England at the 2002 World Cup, which they went on to win, defeating Germany in the final. His world-wide reputation assured, Scolari then landed the Portuguese job and guided the hosts to the final of Euro 2004, beating England on penalties along the way. 

Nicknamed Big Phil, Scolari boasts a reputation for being a no-nonsense manager with a shrewd grasp of tactics. He did not shy away from making major decisions at Euro 2004, removing the Portugal legend, Luis Figo, during the quarter final against England. Portugal immediately improved when Figo went off. The boldness of Scolaris substitutions contrasted with Erikssons less effective ones. 

Scolaris appointment will come as a blow to those within the FA who had hoped for a British manager like Martin Neill, who was Barwicks initial preferred choice. The appointment is liable to cause apoplexy at the League Managers Association, who have campaigned for the promotion of a home-grown coach. 

Yet Scolari will simply be able to remind everyone that he orchestrated a World Cup success, and twice defeated Eriksson. How the players take to another foreigner remains to be seen, particularly one who has no fears about dropping under-performing big-name players. 

Doubtless the first question Scolari will be asked will refer to David Beckhams captaincy. 

Keen to cut costs after the Eriksson era, the FA is believed to have offered ?2.5 million a year to Scolari, who knows Eriksson was on ?4 million. An agreement will soon be reached and the official announcement about Scolaris appointment is only a matter of time.

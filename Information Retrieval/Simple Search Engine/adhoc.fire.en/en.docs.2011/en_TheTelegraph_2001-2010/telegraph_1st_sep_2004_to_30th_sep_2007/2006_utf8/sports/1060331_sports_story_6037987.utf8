 Sharapova overpowers Myskina to enter semis

Miami: Maria Sharapova powered into her fifth semi-final in as many events this season with a 6-3, 6-3 defeat of Russian rival Anastasia Myskina at the Miami Masters on Wednesday. 

The fourth seed will play Moscow-born Frenchwoman Tatiana Golovin, who ended the run of Chinas Zheng Jie with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 win in the quarters. 

Mens sixth seed Ivan Ljubicic had an easier outing after he produced 34 winners to sweep past Argentine Agustin Calleri 7-6, 6-3 and moved into the semis. The win kept the Croatian second behind Roger Federer in match victories this season. While the world No. 1 boasts a 25-1 record in 2006, Ljubicic stands at 24-3. 

Ljubicics fellow Croat Mario Ancic was unable to get past his Argentine opponent, third seed David Nalbandian, though, falling to a 6-2, 6-2 loss. 

Sharapovas triumph in the battle of former Grand Slam winners put her within two more victories of a second consecutive title after winning in Indian Wells less than a fortnight ago. 

I knew I had to be consistent against her, Sharapova told reporters. Shes not going to overpower me, shes just going to try to make me hit another ball. 

I took my opportunities, took my chances, and that was important. 

The 18-year-old, runner-up here to Kim Clijsters last year, held her nerve after losing three of four times against Myskina in 2004. 

Five of the nine games in the second set were breaks of serve as momentum shifted back and forth. Sharapova finished the winner on Myskinas forehand wide. 

Sharapova has beaten fellow teenager Golovin both times they have met.

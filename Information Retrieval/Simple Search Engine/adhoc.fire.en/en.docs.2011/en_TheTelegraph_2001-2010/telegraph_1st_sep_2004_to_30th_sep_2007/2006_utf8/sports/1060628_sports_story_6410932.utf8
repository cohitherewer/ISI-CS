 Berlin: Germany midfielder 

 Torsten Frings has warned Argentina that the hosts are a 

 much stronger outfit than the team they faced at the Confederations 

 Cup last June. Germany will cross swords with Argentina 

 on Friday in a quarter final tussle in Berlin and Frings 

 said Jurgen Klinsmanns team had made giant strides 

 since the two 2-2 draws last year. We were close to 

 beating them on both occasions and were arguably the better 

 side, Frings said on Tuesday.

 German patriotism

 Berlin: If nothing else, 

 hosting the World Cup with their red hot team has helped 

 Germans finally learn the words to their national anthem. 

 Top German soccer official Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said 

 on Tuesday he was stirred by his countrys rather unexpected 

 embrace of patriotism so suddenly at the World Cup after 

 six decades of shunning national symbols because of the 

 Nazi past. Its been a most beautiful experience, 

 Mayer-Vorfelder, president of the German soccer association 

 said.

 Terror watch

 Berlin: A western German 

 state has been watching suspected Islamic militants around 

 the clock during the World Cup, an official said on Tuesday. 

 The surveillance operation in north Rhine-Westphalia was 

 revealed when a newspaper reported that a man who discovered 

 he had been under observation complained that his rights 

 were being violated. A court in Muenster rejected the mans 

 request, arguing that the interests of state security outweighed 

 the rights of the plaintiff during the soccer tournament.

 Fifa rules out 2-ref theory

 Berlin: Soccers governing 

 body is not ready to use two referees on the pitch at World 

 Cup games. Match officials have come under heavy scrutiny 

 amid the record number of red and yellow cards being issued 

 and a spate of questionable decisions at the finals so far. 

 Fifa communications director Markus Siegler said trials 

 using two referees in tandem was not the right path 

 to follow right now.

 Petkovic resigns

 Belgrade: Serbia-Montenegros 

 coach Ilija Petkovic resigned on Tuesday after his teams 

 poor performance at the World Cup. As of today, my 

 function as the national team head coach ceases to exist, 

 Petkovic said. I had the ambition to lead our country, 

 which is faced with the worlds mixture of fear, hatred 

 and scorn, toward a new image, Petkovic said. But 

 I failed.

 Cohen shirt at pound;38,400

 London: The shirt worn 

 by defender George Cohen during Englands 1966 World 

 Cup final victory fetched ?38,400 ($69,970) on Tuesday when 

 a German family sold it at auction. Cohen swapped shirts 

 with West German rival Lothar Emmerich after Englands 

 4-2 win in the game. An anonymous bidder bought the red 

 No.2 shirt, which had been kept by Emmerichs family 

 for 40 years.

 Brazilian fans on 

 Tuesday

 Ashley confident

 Berlin: Ashley Cole finally 

 looks to be back to his best after turning in his finest 

 display of the competition so far in the 1-0 win over Ecuador 

 It is getting there, he said. We have 

 been training hard and these games are getting me fitter. 

 I need my touch to be a little bit better but I am feeling 

 fitter than before. We are not playing as fluently 

 as we can but it is quite hard on these pitches because 

 they are really dry and it is hard to get our passing game 

 going.

 Deja vu for police

 Berlin: Police on the normally 

 tranquil British island of Jersey are mounting a major security 

 operation to prevent a repeat of trouble that flared after 

 Englands match against Portugal at the 2004 European 

 Championship. About six percent of the population of Jersey 

 were born in Portugal. In June 2004, after Portugals 

 victory, England supporters chanted racist abuse and threw 

 bottles, cans and coins at Portugal supporters and riot 

 police deployed CS gas and made 14 arrests.

 Commentators bias

 Beijing: The dramatic climax 

 of Italys 1-0 victory over Australia on Monday proved 

 too much for Chinas most popular TV commentator, who 

 sang passionate paean to Italian football. Huang Jianxiang 

 was unable to control his enthusiasm when Fabio Grosso went 

 down in a challenge. Penalty! Penalty! Penalty! 

 he screamed. Grossos done it, Grossos 

 done it! He succeeded in the glorious traditions of Italy! 

 More was to come when Francesco Totti converted the 

 penalty to win the match. Goooooal! Game over! Italy 

 win! Beat the Australians! They do not fall in front of 

 Hiddink again!

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Procter will be on duty

Mumbai: Match Referee Mike Procter, who featured in The Oval controversy, will be on duty during the Champions Trophy in India. The International Cricket Council had on Thursday decided to keep umpire Darrell Hair out of the tournament while Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is also set to miss the event after being banned for four one-day Internationals. 

Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle and Jeff Crowe will be the others, besides Procter, on duty. 

The list of umpires for the tournament are Aleem Dar, Asad Rauf (Pakistan), Mark Benson (England) Brent Bowden (New Zealand), Steve Bucknor, Billy Doctrove (West Indies), Daryl Harper, Simon Taufel (Australia) and Rudi Koertzen (South Africa). 

Meanwhile, two players from each of the ten participating teams would be selected at random for dope tests by the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA). 

This is the first time dope test has been introduced by the ICC in Champions Trophy. It had been done on a trial basis during the last World Cup in South Africa but officially this is being done for the first time at the top level, tournament director Ratnakar Shetty said on Friday. 

The testing would be at random decided by WADA personnel, Shetty said. 

He said that the test samples would be sent to the nearest WADA-accredited lab in Kuala Lumpur. (Agencies)

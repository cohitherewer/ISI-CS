The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The attention will be on...

 - AFTER SOURAVS COMEBACK 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly has made his fourth comeback (after 1996 and twice last year) and, as on each occasion in the past, every move of his and the principal characters towards him will be watched with interest of the unusual kind. 

This time, in The Telegraphs opinion, the attention (in South Africa) is probably going to be more on 

First, off the field: 

The warmth (or its absence) towards Sourav in the dressing room. It will be interesting how captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell react to his presence. 

Senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkars attitude. 

The reception given by Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan, widely acknowledged as being closest to Sourav. 

Newly-appointed vice-captain V.V.S. Laxmans role. 

The posture adopted by Virender Sehwag, who has lost the vice-captaincy for the Test series. 

The reaction of relative newcomers like Munaf Patel. 

Also, the Mediapersons Sourav interacts with. 

Then, on the field: 

Souravs ability to handle pressure. Specifically, is he still mentally tough? 

The pace at which he adjusts to the wickets, which are going to be demanding to say the least. 

Whether he can look Makhaya Ntini in the eye 

Souravs fielding and running between wickets. Have kick-boxing lessons in the city actually made him fitter? 

Whether Dravid takes the initiative in drawing on Souravs experience as captain 

Whether Sourav himself offers suggestions to his successor

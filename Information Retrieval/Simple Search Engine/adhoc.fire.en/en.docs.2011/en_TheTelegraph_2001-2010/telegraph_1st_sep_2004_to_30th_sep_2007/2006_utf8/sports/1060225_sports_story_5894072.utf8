 targets help in pressure situations

 RAVI SHASTRI

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 My coach says that I tend to be open chested when playing 

 shots. Will this cause any problems in my career?

 (Ratul Dey, 21, Calcutta-42)

 Yes it will, especially when you are driving through the off-side and off the front foot. So get it corrected as early as possible.

 I am a righthanded batsman 

 and am often adjudged leg before when playing off the backfoot. 

 Why does this happen?

 (Tamal Roy, 19, Calcutta-16)

 You are not picking the right line or length of the ball and going too far across.

 I am a lefthanded batsman 

 and often get caught in the square leg-mid wicket region 

 when attempting the pull. Why does this happen?

 (Avishek Datta, 21, Rourkela)

 Check the position you are getting into. Make use of the depth of the crease to go back and across, and make sure the ball is short enough to allow you to pull. Most importantly, roll your wrists at the time of contact.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. 

 My coach says that I dont finish my follow-through 

 after delivering, which leads to my line going haywire. 

 Please help if that be the reason.

 (Robin Roy, 23, Calcutta)

 Could possibly be the reason. Your head should be nice and still and watch the spot you want the ball to land.

 I am a left-arm spinner. 

 When the batsman is in a murderous mood, should I continue 

 to flight the ball?

 (Rajat Bhowmik, 19, Calcutta-21)

 Youve got to vary your pace and flight and make sure you set the right field.

 I often misjudge high catches. 

 I get beneath the ball but then somehow fail to hold on 

 to the ball. Please help.

 (Md Salim, 22, Calcutta)

 Dont take your eyes off the ball and make sure you are nicely balanced.

 I am a righthanded batsman. 

 I often get caught at backward short leg or bowled when 

 trying to play a leg-spinner. Please help.

 (Prabir Roy, 18, Calcutta-60)

 You are getting too far across and exposing your leg stump. So watch that and let the ball come to you when playing the shot. Your eyes should always be on top of the ball. 

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer 

 and often change my action to suit my needs. Can it pose 

 problems to my bowling?

 (Siddharth Banerjee, 16, Howrah)

 As long as it involves subtle changes, it is fine.

 I am a righthanded batsman 

 and would like to know the secret behind batting well under 

 pressure. Also, how can one get mentally stronger?

 (Ravi Paul, 23, Calcutta)

 It is all about self-belief. Setting yourself small targets at a time also helps.

 Borde wants Indians to inspire schoolkids

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: Former India captain and selection committee chairman Chandu Borde is in the Malaysian capital for a few days. 

Besides watching a couple of the tri-series matches, he intends requesting some of the Indian players to interact with students of the Global Indian International School here. 

Im one of the trustees of the School (which also has a branch in Singapore) and its going to be great if somebody like Rahul Dravid can spare time... The Dravids are role models and their presence is bound to inspire, Borde told The Telegraph on Monday. 

He will, of course, be hoping that his stay is sans the drama of the morning when he dropped his passport and other important things in the cab which brought him from the airport to the hotel. 

Thankfully, Id kept the receipt and, so, the agency could be called... The people there got in touch with the driver and, after two hours or so, I got everything back... I cant express the relief adequately enough, Borde remarked.

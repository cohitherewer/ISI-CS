 Inzy for 3-match Test series

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has urged the International Cricket Council to do away with two-match Test series, saying it made it difficult for the players to motivate themselves. 

Its very difficult to get your players motivated and focused when you are playing a two-test series, Inzamam said. 

Its always difficult to get a result in such circumstances as the players cant really focus properly, he was quoted as saying in a local daily from Kandy where the second and final Test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka began on Monday. 

Inzamam said in a three-Test series, the sides had a chance to stage a comeback as against a two-Test rubber.

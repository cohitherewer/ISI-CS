 Mahesh-Mario makes final

Beijing: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Croatian partner Mario Ancic stormed into the final of the Beijing Open ATP tournament, defeating Kristian Pless of Denmark and Danai Udomchoke of Thailand in straight sets here on Sunday night. 

The Indo-Croat duo did not allow their rivals to settle down and dominated the match throughout with some excellent passing shots and powerful serves to score a 6-1, 6-2 victory. 

In the final to be played on Sunday, Bhupathi and Ancic will meet Michael Berrer of Germany and Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark. 

For Ancic, it would be a gruelling day, as he has also entered the final of the mens singles and would face Marcos Baghdatis from Cyprus. (PTI)

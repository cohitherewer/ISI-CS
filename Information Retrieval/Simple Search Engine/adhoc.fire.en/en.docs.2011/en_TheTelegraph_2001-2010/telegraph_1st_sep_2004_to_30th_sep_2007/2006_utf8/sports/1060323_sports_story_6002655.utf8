 Rajinder: Im frustrated

Melbourne: After the Indian hockey teams disappointing show at the 18th Commonwealth Games, coach Rajinder Singh on Wednesday indicated that he may step down. 

Such performance by our team creates frustration. The attack has been the biggest problem for us right from the Champions Trophy, the national coach said after India failed to make it to the semi-finals of the quadrennial sporting extravaganza. 

As the coach, I am very frustrated. But, I should not take such steps (resignation) hurriedly. Let me think about it, Rajinder said when asked about the possibility of his stepping down. 

Our start against Malaysia was not good. We should have won that match but our forwards were to be blamed for that. They were not able to trap properly, he added. 

A coach can only give guidance, plan schemes on match situations but the players do not seem to put all these into effect for positive results, he rued. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wright returning, this time as commentator

 - Former Team India coach on panel for Champions Trophy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Wright 

Kuala Lumpur: John Wright, who has been in the news of late for comments in his book, Indian Summers, will be in India as a TV commentator during the forthcoming Champions Trophy. The tournament proper is going to be held from October 15-November 5. 

A former New Zealand captain, Wright was the Team India coach from November 2000 to April 2005. Greg Chappell took over a month after the end of Wrights record-creating innings. 

Wrights name is on the panel of commentators and unless theres an 11th-hour change, he will be in India not many weeks from now. Wright doesnt like attention from the Media, but hes going to be an attraction, a source told The Telegraph Monday. 

As the contents of Indian Summers have ruffled quite a few feathers, it will be interesting how Wright handles the fallout should he come face to face with some of those mentioned in the book. 

Incidentally, Wrights only coaching assignment since finishing with Team India a high profile job with high pressure was in last October when he was given charge of the World XI for the Super Series in Australia. 

 Recently, during a telephonic interview, Wright had 

 said he was looking for a job. Its to 

 be seen whether the search is going to end in the commentators 

 box.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Waqar slams choice of ball, wicket

 - Use the Duke or SG-Test 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Lahore: Former Pakistan captain and legendary 

speed merchant Waqar Younis wants the Australian Kookaburra ball, being used in 

the ongoing series, banned in the sub-continent. 

The seam sinks after the first eight-ten overs 

and theres nothing for the bowlers... Obviously, it gets worse on wickets 

such as the one prepared at the Gaddafi, Waqar told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Monday afternoon, he added: The Boards should look at using the Duke or even the SG-Test balls... The seam is prominent and visible for much longer. Then, the balls stay harder for a longer duration and even the batsmen wont complain. 

Duke is manufactured in the UK, while the SG-Test is made in India. 

Waqar also slammed the Pakistan Cricket Board for the bland wicket here. I cant understand the objective... Never have I seen the Gaddafi like this... Its shocking... Im glad I didnt have to bowl... 

Incidentally, even some of the current Indian bowlers 

have reservations about the Kookaburra. 

Footnote: Waqar confessed he was relieved 

at not having to bowl at Sehwag. If I did, I would have had to wear a helmet... 

Hes amazing... He just punches and the ball is past the boundary... As he 

doesnt use his feet, hes best equipped to negotiate the reverse swing...

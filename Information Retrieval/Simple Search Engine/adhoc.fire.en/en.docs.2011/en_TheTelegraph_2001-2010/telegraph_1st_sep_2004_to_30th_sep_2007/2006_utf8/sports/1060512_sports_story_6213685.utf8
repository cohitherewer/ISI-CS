 Arsene Wenger surprised at Theo inclusion

London: Arsene Wenger says he was surprised England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson included untried Arsenal teenager Theo Walcott in his World Cup squad. 

But the Frenchman, who has not yet selected the 17-year-old to play a first team game for Arsenal, said the forward had the ability to make a real difference to Englands World Cup hopes. 

It was a surprise because he has no real experience, Wenger told reporters. But its a pleasant surprise because he is a big prospect and it will mature him to be exposed to such a top level competition. 

The Arsenal boss said he expected Walcott to take all the attention in his stride. 

Hes a quiet personality but hes a strong personality. I believe he will cope with it surprisingly well. 

I believe he is still a little bit in shock because it was a little bit unexpected for him... You dont realise too much whats happening to you and you just try to do well. He can be an interesting weapon to come on because he can play wide and central. 

England cant rely on Theo Walcott, but he can come on and make a difference.

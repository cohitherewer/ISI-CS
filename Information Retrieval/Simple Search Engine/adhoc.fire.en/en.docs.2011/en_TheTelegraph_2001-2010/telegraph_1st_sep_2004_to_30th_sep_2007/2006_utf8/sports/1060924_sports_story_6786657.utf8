 Pakistan have weakened their case: Imran

Karachi: With four days to go for the ICC disciplinary hearing in London, former Pakistan captain Imran Khan has said Pakistan had weakened its case in the ball-tampering row by not opting to approach the court in the first place. 

Imran told an Urdu paper that PCB should have gone to court against the ICC immediately after The Oval Test. 

Pakistan could have gone to court and asked to produce evidence of the ball-tampering allegation levelled against our players in The Oval Test. It could have asked the ICC to show the ball in court. This would have also got Hair into trouble, he said. (PTI)

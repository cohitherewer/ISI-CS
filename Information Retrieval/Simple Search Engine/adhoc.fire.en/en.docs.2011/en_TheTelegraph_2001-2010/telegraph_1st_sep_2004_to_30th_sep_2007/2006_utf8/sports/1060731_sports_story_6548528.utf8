 Tursunov, Haas enter final

Los Angeles: Germanys Tommy Haas stayed on track for his third ATP title of the year with a comfortable 6-2, 7-5 win over Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty in the Los Angeles Open semi-finals on Saturday. 

The 2004 champion will meet eighth-seeded Dmitry Tursunov after the Russian upset third seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 6-4, 6-2 to reach his first ATP final. 

Haas breezed through the first set by twice breaking Hrbatys serve, cleverly varying his pace and delivering a mix of slices and top-spins to keep his opponent under pressure. 

Seventh seed Hrbaty, playing only his second semi-final of the year, provided stiffer opposition in the second set which went with serve until Haas again broke in the 11th game.

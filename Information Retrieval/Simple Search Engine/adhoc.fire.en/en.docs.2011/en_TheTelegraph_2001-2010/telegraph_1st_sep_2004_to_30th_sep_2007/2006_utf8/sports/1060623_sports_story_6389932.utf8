 Federer: Theres a lot of pressure

 - World No.1 eyes Borg, Sampras records 

 Federers domination on grass is absolute 

London: After failing in his bid to snatch Rafael Nadals claycourt crown, Roger Federer will try to mimic the Spaniard by breaking a record and then retaining one of his own Grand Slams at Wimbledon. 

Last month Nadal opened his successful defence of the French Open by beating Guillermo Vilas record of 53 consecutive wins on clay and Federer will surpass Bjorn Borgs grasscourt streak of 41 wins in a row if he wins his first round match on Monday. 

Nobody sensible would bet against either that, or the Swiss going on to join Borg and Pete Sampras as the only men in the professional era to win four consecutive titles at the home of lawn tennis. 

Federers dominance on grass is absolute, and the series of close shaves he survived last week at Halle ? notably saving four match points in the quarter finals against Belgian Olivier Rochus ? will only have enhanced his aura of invincibility. 

That tournament allowed the Swiss to ease the psychological damage of his defeat in Paris by Nadal, a loss that prevented him from becoming only the third man to hold all four Grand Slams at once. 

Now when I go to Wimbledon, people will not ask me about Paris, but about Halle, Federer said. Thats great mentally. It paid off that I came, and that makes me even more happy. 

Ever modest, Federer likes to point out that Borgs 41 wins were all achieved at Wimbledon, while his own run includes four victories at the less competitive Halle event. He is also is taking nothing for granted in the first round. 

Its very difficult to open the tournament in Wimbledon, he said. It maybe a privilege and an honour, but at the same time you can be the first guy out So, theres a lot of pressure. 

 Kiefer withdraws 

Meanwhile, Germanys Nicolas Kiefer has withdrawn, organisers said on Thursday. Kiefer, who had been seeded 18th, did not reveal a reason for pulling out, although he had to quit during the French Open with a wrist injury. 

Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan has been elevated into the seeding list and under the surface-based system, will be the 29th seed.

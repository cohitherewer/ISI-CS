Melbourne: Top seed Roger Federer spanked German bad boy Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 5-7, 6-0, 6-2 on Friday to join giantkiller Marcos Baghdatis in the Australian Open mens final. 

The seemingly invincible Federer stormed into his seventh Grand Slam final in three and a half years with another imperious display to set-up a promoters dream final aganst the newest kid on the Grand Slam block. 

I think were all surprised he got so far, Federer told a news conference. There are other very talented youngesters who I thought would make the break before him but hes proved us all wrong. 

Baghdatis has captured the sporting worlds imagination with his fairytale run to the final when he defeated fourth seed David Nalbandian 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in the semi-finals on Thursday. 

Ill have to wake up and check if Im dreaming, the unseeded Baghdatis said in a courtside interview. I dont know what to say ? its amazing, he added. 

However, the Cypriot showman will need to conjure up another miracle to beat the world number one after his impressive form against the feisty Kiefer. The German has been fined $6,000 during the tournament for various offences, including unsportsmanlike behaviour and swearing. 

They split the first two sets but Federer, struggling initially to cope with variations of playing indoors after rain forced the closure of the Rod Laver Arena roof, raised his game when he needed to and ran away with the final two sets. 

Im really happy to be back in the final. This is what I was hoping for at the beginning at the tournament but its a long road, Federer said. 

Meanwhile, womens tennis took a sneak preview at the future when China claimed their first Grand Slam title. 

Zheng Jie and Yan Zi teamed up to win the womens doubles final, beating the top seed pairing of Stosur and American Lisa Raymond 2-6, 7-6, 6-3, in a sure sign of things to come. 

It will be good for Chinese tennis, said Yan, speaking through a translator.

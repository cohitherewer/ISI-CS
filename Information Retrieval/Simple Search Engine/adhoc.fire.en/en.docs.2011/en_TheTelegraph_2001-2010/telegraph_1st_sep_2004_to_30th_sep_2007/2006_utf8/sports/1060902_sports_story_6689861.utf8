 Not scoring is a problem: Pereira

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal had made a dream start under Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva. But four wins out of four now seem distant history. In their last two matches, the red-and-golds havent scored a goal and earned a solitary point. 

The Brazilian coach, though, is unflustered about the results. What is bothering him is the lack of goals. 

Not scoring is the problem. We have been getting chances, today we got a penalty, but could not score, Pereira said. 

The coach admitted that his team played a very bad match on Friday. Im not happy with the game we played. But that doesnt mean we dont have a good team. Even teams like Brazil, Real Madrid have poor results. Its not easy for any team to play very good football all matches. There will be good, medium and bad performances which will help me understand who can play the way I want, remarked Pereira. 

The coach defended Ashim Biswas who had another forgettable game and missed a penalty. There is no pressure on him. He is still a good player. 

Agreeing that Luiz Octavio de Souza didnt have a good game, Pereira said his countryman wasnt feeling well before the match. He was feeling weak but was eager to play, said Pereira and added that he was waiting for a striker to come from his country, possibly next week. 

The Eastern Railway camp didnt have kind words for the referee. Both coach Shankar Moitra and goalkeeper Tapan Karmakar said that the penalty awarded to East Bengal was unfair. 

Also, Ashim (Biswas) should have been showed the red card for kicking our defender Shubhankar (Maity), added the coach.

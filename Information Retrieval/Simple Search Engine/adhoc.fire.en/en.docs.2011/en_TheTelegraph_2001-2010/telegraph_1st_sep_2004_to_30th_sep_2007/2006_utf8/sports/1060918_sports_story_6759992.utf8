 38th doubles title for Mahesh

 - Singles crown for Baghdatis 

 Bhupathi struck gold with new partner Ancic 

Beijing: Mahesh Bhupathi and his Croatian partner Mario Ancic routed Michael Berrer of Germany and Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark 6-4, 6-3 to win the doubles title at the $475,000 China Open here on Sunday night. 

This was Bhupathis 38th ATP title and first in 2006. The Indo-Croat duo, who were playing together for the first time, played aggressive tennis before an appreciative crowd, who cheered them all along. 

Bhupathi was at his best at the net and made several passing shots. He also made up for his slightly injured partner Ancic who, however, continued to torment his opponents with his trademark super-fast serves and aces. 

Bhupathi-Ancic made the crucial breaks in fifth game in the first set and seventh game in the second set, never allowed the German-Danish duo to overwhelm them in all aspects of the game. 

Meanwhile, third-seeded Marcos Baghdatis won his first career title when he beat Croatias Mario Ancic 6-4, 6-0 in the singles final. 

Australian Open runner-up Baghdatis of Cyprus upped the tempo in the second set roll past fourth-seeded Ancic, who was contesting his first tournament after a two-month layoff due to injury. 

After making the quarter finals at Wimbledon this year, Ancic hurt his back and knee in a yachting accident and was sidelined until this week. The China Open was his fourth finals appearance this season. Baghdatis, who reached this years US Open semi-finals, is now 1-3 against Ancic including two losses this year. 

Also on Sunday, the 2006 Australian Open and Wimbledon champion Amelie Mauresmo from France was named top seed for the China Open WTA Tournament. (AGENCIES)

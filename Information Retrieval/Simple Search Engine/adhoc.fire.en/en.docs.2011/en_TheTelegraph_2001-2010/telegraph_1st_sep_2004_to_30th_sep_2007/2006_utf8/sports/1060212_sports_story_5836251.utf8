 Indian colts whip WI to enter semis

Indies and move into the Under-19 World Cup semi-finals on Saturday. 

Favourites India posted 284 for nine in 50 overs before bowling out the Caribbeans for 158 in 38.5 overs.

Electing to bat first, India got off to a flying start as openers Dhiman and C. Pujara (94, 134 balls, 9x4) put 110 in 13.5 overs. Dhiman was especially ruthless, smashing 10 fours and three sixes. 

Fridays Man-of-the-Match Rohit Sharma clicked with the bat, notching up another half century. His 50 off 57 balls consisted of six boundaries. 

The run chase was never easy for the West Indians 

as new ball bowlers Yo Mahesh (4/25) and Dhiman (3/27) delivered the goods early 

on, reducing their opponents to 68 for seven.

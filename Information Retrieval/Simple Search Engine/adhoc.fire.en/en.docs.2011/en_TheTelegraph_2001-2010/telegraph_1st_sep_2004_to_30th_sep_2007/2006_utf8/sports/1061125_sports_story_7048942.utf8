New Delhi: It the end, it proved to be much ado about nothing. Those, sitting in the stands at the Ambedkar Stadium on Friday were loudly calling Dempo and JCT names for conspiring to oust East Bengal from the Durand Cup, were made to look for cover by their favourite team. 

After JCT and Dempo played a 1-1 draw to ensure East Bengals exit, the Calcutta side were at least expected to play for their pride. But the 16-time champions looked even incapable of that and lost to Army XI 1-2. 

In three matches, East Bengal logged just one point. They have conceded six goals and took 223 minutes to score their first and only goal of the tournament. They have suffered two back-to-back defeats and failed to win even one match. 

But, then, no one in the East Bengal camp looked too bothered about such things. The skipper Alvito DCunha was seen in a smiling mood after the match. Others walked off in a manner as if they were used to it. The coach blamed everyone except himself. 

In the first half, East Bengal looked listless. They were simply pathetic after the change of ends. Vijay Thapa put Army XI in the lead in the 47th minute leaving the East Bengal defenders stranded. Twenty minutes later, Thapa was once again allowed to add another to his tally. This time he turned the ball with his knee to beat Abhra Mondal under the bar. Others just watched. 

In between, Alvito DCunha scored East Bengals only goal of the tournament in the 53rd minute off a fine cross by Freddy Mascarenhas. For the rest of the period, the red and yellow brigade looked lost in the middle. 

The days first match was simply a poor advertisement for football. Neither Dempo nor JCT looked in any hurry to move the ball in the opposite direction. They played at a walking pace and were visibly refraining themselves from making any move. Once their designs were clear, the crowd started booing them. 

While both JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh and Dempo assistant coach Maurice Afonso denied playing a fixed match and said they didnt want to take a chance, the way two goals were scored left a question mark on the intentions of the teams. 

JCT took the lead in the 65th minute through Mandeep Singh. It took Dempo just two minutes to equalise through Ishfaq Ahmed. While full credit to Ahmed for scoring the goal, one found JCT defenders too lethargic to thwart the attackers. 

On Saturday, Mohun Bagan will play the first semi-final against Dempo, followed by the JCT versus Sporting Clube de Goa match. JCT said they were eager to avoid playing the first semi-final.

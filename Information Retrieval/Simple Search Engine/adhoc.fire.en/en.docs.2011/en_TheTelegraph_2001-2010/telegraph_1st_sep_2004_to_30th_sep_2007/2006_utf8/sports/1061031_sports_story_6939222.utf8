 Harikrishna in quarter finals

 International Rapid Chess 

Cap Dagde (France): Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna booked his quarter final berth with a quick draw against Laurent Fressinet of France in the final round of the group A preliminaries of the Cap Dagde International Rapid Chess Tournament here. 

In the quarter finals, Harikrishna will meet Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine who won the group B with awesome ease scoring a whopping 5.5 points. 

On a day when Grandmasters Koneru Humpy and Parimarjan Negi were ousted from the competition, Harikrishna kept his cool and took his chance of fighting a tie-breaker after getting into some difficulties against Fressinet. 

As the events unfolded, Haris nearest rival Antoaneta Stefanova of Bulgaria was held to a draw by lowly placed Marie Sebag of France and that gave the Indian an easier passage to the last-eight stage. 

Stefanovas victory would have forced Harikrishna to play a blitz tie-breaker which in his own words, he was glad to avoid. 

Meanwhile Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine comprehensively won this section after an easy draw with Negi who had to be content with sixth place on three points. 

Karjakin scored five points out of a possible seven and was half a point adrift of Teimour Radjabov of Azerbaijan and Fressinet who finished second and third, respectively. Harikrishna scored four points in all.

 Rathores gun traced

New Delhi: Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore heaved a huge sigh of relief after his Olympic quota-winning Perazzi gun was retrieved on Wednesday, exactly a fortnight after it was lost on his way back from Cairo. 

A Lufthansa Airlines official said the weapon was lying at the Frankfurt custom warehouse and would most probably be handed over to the Athens Olympics silver-medallist by Thursday. 

The weapon was found in the custom warehouse in the custody of the Frankfurt airport authorities, he said. 

Because it is a gun and not a normal baggage, it will be given special treatment and needs certain formalities for its shipment. It should most probably reach here by Thursdays direct flight from Frankfurt, he said.

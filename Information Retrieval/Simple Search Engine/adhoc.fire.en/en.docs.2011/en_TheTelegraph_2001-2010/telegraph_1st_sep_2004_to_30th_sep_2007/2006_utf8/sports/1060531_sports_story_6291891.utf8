The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian bowlers fail to impress

 Tie vs Antigua XI

 Antigua: Indian bowlers 

 did not look in good form against the Antigua XI on the 

 opening day of the two-day match here on Tuesday.

 The locals were 74 for one after 

 25 overs, with Munaf Patel reaping the lone success.

 Opener Daniel Thomas was batting 

 on 30 (3x4) and captain Sylvester Joseph on 20 (2x4) at 

 lunch.

 Irfan Pathan and Sreesanth opened 

 the bowling but Pathan looked jaded and tired and bowled 

 with hardly any pace.

 Sreesanth showed more spunk but 

 it was V.R.V. Singh who delivered the best in his five overs.

 Kumble bowled just one over before 

 the break.

 It must be said that police ground 

 did not appear the right venue for the visitors as there 

 is a pronounced slope on one side of the wicket and out 

 field was also bumpy.

 The first match of the four Test 

 series will begin on Friday.

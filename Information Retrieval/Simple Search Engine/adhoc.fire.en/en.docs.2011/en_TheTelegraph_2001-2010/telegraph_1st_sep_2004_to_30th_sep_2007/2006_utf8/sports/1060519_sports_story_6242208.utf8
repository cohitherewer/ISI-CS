 Ruff guide to how the Cup was nicked 

 - When the Jules Rimet Trophy went walkabout in 66... 

 JIM WHITE

Alan Ball was recently quoted saying that every night he prays to the sporting gods, begging them to let England win the World Cup again. If nothing else, he said, it would give people something to talk about other than 1966. Anyone switching on their televisions right now will know how he feels. It seems that every night we are treated to a new angle on that solitary English victory. 

 One such was Who Stole The World Cup?, a memoir of an embarrassing few days in the spring of 1966 when the Jules Rimet Trophy went walkabout. As a piece of history, this was about as thin as Peter Crouchs legs: trophy gets nicked, dog finds it was roughly the sum of its plot. But along the way there was much fun to be had at the incompetence of everyone involved. 

Soon after the trophy arrived in England, the FA, in a marketing campaign that hardly demands the adjective ambitious, loaned it out to be displayed at a philately exhibition. The shows organisers hired a firm called Alsa Security to keep an eye on it. Alsas motto, we learned, was as alert as an Alsatian. In this instance they were about as alert as an Alsatian that has been attached to an intravenous drip of liquid prozac. Talk about dopey. 

On the first Sunday of the exhibition, when the show was closed but the building where it was being held was still open to the public, Alsa decided not to bother stationing a guard in the room where the solid gold trinket was on display. Instead, someone was instructed to stick their head round the door every so often to check the thing was still there. It soon wasnt. 

The amateurishness of the security operation was hardly helped when Alsas boss ? a certain Mr Reid ? faced the media. This was clearly not someone who employed a corporate spin-doctor. Once Ive had a chance to gather my somewhat scattered wits I will talk to you, the poor man spluttered to the waiting pressmen. 

Imagine if such a robbery had happened nowadays. Full public inquiries would be demanded, David Cameron would rise in the House of Commons insisting on the Home Secretarys resignation, while newspaper columnists would suggest a replacement trophy be fashioned out of Mr Reids head. 

Back in 1966, the response was restricted to getting the finest detective mind on the job. Which turned out to be that of Ted Harris of the Flying Squad. It was a case of get yourself round your manor and lean on the local villains, he recalled of his investigative strategy 40 years on. 

As it happened, Harris didnt need to do much leaning. A local villain made contact with the authorities himself, ringing the chief executive of the FA and demanding a ransom. The Flying Squad took charge and in a magnificently bungled operation, managed to botch the hand over, grabbing the thief, but getting about as close to the Cup as Englands captains have been ever since 66. The programme suggested a deal was made with the robber, who arranged for the booty to be left in a prominent spot, where it was found by a dog. 

Pickles, the mutt concerned, became an instant celebrity. Pickles fame, though, was not sufficiently well known for Jack Charlton to recall what he was called. Was it Dixie? Trixie? Charlton said , forgetfulness which will make Jason McAteer feel a little better: it is not just names of Irish footballers Big Jack cant remember, it is important names too. 

As for the rest of it, well, after revealing that Pickles strangled himself six months later on his own lead chasing a cat down an alley, the programme went off down a bit of a blind alley of its own.

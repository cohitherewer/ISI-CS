 Bengal focus on Hyderabad tie

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Its not making the semi-finals but doing well in their next match against Hyderabad that is the immediate target for Bengal skipper Deep Dasgupta. 

With eight points in their kitty, the away tie is a crucial one for Deep. They are a good side and definitely well have a good game there. Asked about their chances to make the last four, Deep said: Our immediate target is the crucial Hyderabad match. Weve to concentrate on playing better there and not think of the semi-finals. If we perform well, this (reaching semis) will just follow 

But at the moment before they leave for their Hyderabad campaign Saturday the team is taking the positives. The match will be memorable for Souravs debut. Also Rana bowled well and Sourashish chipped in with the bat Theres quite a few positives from the match which will definitely boost our confidence ahead of the crucial Hyderabad match, Deep said. 

For Maharashtras Hrishikesh Kanitkar the Eden has been lucky. It seems it has been my lucky ground I had a great knock against East Zone two years before. But this knock cant be compared with the previous one as that time we were setting up the total. Todays knock came in the second innings and at a time when we were trailing Bengal.

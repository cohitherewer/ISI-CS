 World Cup gold a dream 

 come true 

 Narang to focus on 3-position event at Olympics

New Delhi: As Gagan Narang emerged through the arrival lounge of the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Sunday night, one could sense a new-found confidence in his approach. 

Only the third Indian to win a World Cup shooting gold and first to earn a quota for the Beijing Olympics, Narang looked at ease when he faced fans, journalists and countered a barrage of questions. 

Yet, not for once the 23-year-old shooter from Hyderabad lost his cool. 

Four gold medal in Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, followed by the spectacular show in Guangzhou (China) has elevated him to the status of a sporting icon, but Narang sounded down to earth as he spoke about his achievements. 

At the moment, I am too tired, Narang said. 

At Melbourne, I did well, but wasnt too sure about China since I was mentally tired after a long competition in Australia. That I could win the gold was extremely satisfying. 

What was even more satisfying was that my aggregate score in China was 700.2 in 10m air rifle, equal to my personal best which I shot in the Australia Cup just before the Commonwealth Games Narang said. 

Narang scored 103.2 in the World Cup final in Guangzhou. While Chinas Tianyou Liu won the silver, Artem Khadijibekov of Russia bagged the bronze. 

First I didnt realise that I had made it. Only when I looked back and saw my mates jumping, I knew I won the top spot. To do it in the World Cup was simply like a dream come true. 

On his plans for the Olympics after securing a quota, Narang said he would now focus on the three-position event. 

My place in the Olympics has come in the 10m air rifle. But I think I have got a good chance in three position as well, Narang felt. 

The top shooters in the world score around 1171. I generally score around 1164, so, I am not too far behind in this area, Narang claimed. 

Asked to compare his performance in China with that in Melbourne, Narang said he rated the World Cup gold higher. 

The World Cup medal is much bigger than the Commonwealth Games one because in China all the top shooters participated. Competition was much tougher. 

Among the gold medals he won in Melbourne, Narang said he cherished the one in the three-position most. 

For me, it was a new event. I took to it only a few months ago when the National championship was held in Hyderabad in December last. Yet I managed the gold there. 

Of course, my coach Suchak Laszlo had a big role to play in my success. He worked tirelessly for me and made me improve in this event, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We imposed our quality, says Scolari

Frankfurt: Portugal reached the World Cup second round for the first time in 40 years on Saturday after a quality display, said coach Luiz Felipe Scolari. 

We respected Iran but we imposed our quality, said Scolari after his team qualified from Group D with a comfortable, if not dynamic, 2-0 victory over Iran who have been eliminated. 

It was the first time they had got through the first round since 1966, when inspired by Eusebio they reached the semi-finals before losing 1-2 to eventual winners and hosts England. 

I thought Portugal played better than they have done in the last seven or eight games, added Scolari, who led his native Brazil to World Cup success in 2002 in Japan. 

Iran battled gamely but wilted in the second half just as they had against Mexico in a 3-1 defeat in their opener. 

We played a very good game but, unfortunately, it was hard to make something happen on the field against a good Portugal team, said Iran coach Branko Ivankovic. 

It was an evenly balanced match, but Deco scored a quality goal and after that it was very hard for us to equalise. 

Man of the Match Deco lit up a pedestrian match with a superb 25-metre strike to open the scoring just past the hour before Cristiano Ronaldo got the second with an 80th minute penalty. 

Iran striker Vahid Hashemian added: Forty-five minutes are not enough. You have to run for 90 minutes. We were the better team against Mexico but today we deserved to lose. 

A stunning strike from Deco and a Cristiano Ronaldo penalty gave Portugal the 2-0 triumph. 

In an often tetchy and generally drab Group D encounter, Iran held Portugal at bay for 63 minutes. 

Playmaker Deco, back in the side after injury, broke the deadlock by thumping in a sweet right-foot shot following a left-wing cross from captain Luis Figo. 

Iran went close to an equaliser four minutes later when substitute Rasoul Khatibi shaved the woodwork. Portugal had much more of the possession but Irans defence did well to keep lone striker Pauleta quiet. 

Ronaldo made sure of victory with 10 minutes to go, clipping his spot kick high into the net after Figo was sent flying by a tackle from skipper Yahya Golmohammadi. 

After converting his penalty, winger Ronaldo fell to his knees and screamed with joy.

 Hair shouldnt be there: PCB

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has told the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shun Australian umpire Darrell Hair for next months Champions Trophy in India. 

A well-placed PCB source said on Tuesday that the ICC had been informed in writing that if Hair was put on the umpires panel for the Champions Trophy, it would consider a strong action including a pull-out option from the event. 

The PCB is due to take on Hair in a disciplinary hearing of the ICC in September 27 and 28 which will hear charges of ball-tampering and bringing the game into disrepute against captain Inzamam-ul Haq. 

He stated that the PCB had also sent another strong letter to ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed with reference to the warning he issued to Inzamam and the PCB to refrain from speaking on The Oval incident. 

The Board Chairman has asked Speed that whether the ICC Code of Conduct allowed (Speed) or Hair to also make public comments. 

PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, when asked if Pakistan would accept Hair in the Champions Trophy, said the Board had taken the desired steps to ensure no crisis arose. 

He confirmed that Hair and umpire Billy Doctrove reported Pakistan for ball-tampering to Match Referee Mike Procter after The Oval Test. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan were well prepared and armed with a strong defence for Inzamam in the ball tampering case, a top PCB official said.

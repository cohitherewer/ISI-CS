The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Got to respect Musharraf: Dhoni

 - Indias newest pin-up boy has no plans for haircut till 2007 World Cup

 Nagpur: Respecting Pervez Musharrafs opinion, 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni doesnt intend having a haircut 

 ? not till the 2007 World Cup, at least. 

The Pakistan President, it may be recalled, not only complimented the newest Indian pin-up boys explosive batting in the Lahore ODI (February 13) ? an unbeaten 72 off 46 balls, which earned the MoM award ? but commented on his hair style. 

Breaking protocol, Musharraf had observed: I saw a placard which said Dhoni have a haircut. If you want to take my opinion, you look good... Dont have a hair cut. 

 Ive got to respect 

 his views... The President of Pakistan is, after all, no 

 ordinary person... In fact, hed even commented about 

 my hair style during the reception he hosted in Rawalpindi, 

 Dhoni told The Telegraph on Monday. 

However, speaking in his hotel room, he confirmed having undergone a trim in Mumbai a couple of days ago. 

It was necessary for a commercial shoot... Of course, I ensured the hair was just trimmed and not cut, Dhoni, who was browsing the net (on his lap top) for spare parts for one of his Yamaha bikes, explained. 

Incidentally, one of the companies he endorses (TVS Motors) has promised to present him with a drag-sports bike. As you know, bikes and dogs are an absolute passion... Ive been touched by their gesture and, frankly, cant wait to unwind on that machine, Dhoni remarked. 

While he has to stay off his Yamahas (garaged in Ranchi) when on India duty, he actually isnt very far removed from bikes: Courtesy Hugo Wilsons Hot Bikes ? which has profiles of 300 mean machines. 

 If somebody put together a list of even 30 mean batsmen, 

 Dhoni would surely be somewhere at the top. 

 Footnote: The Union agriculture 

 minister, Sharad Pawar (who is also the Board president), 

 has called for an end to the boycott of chicken and eggs, 

 but Dhoni and quite a few others arent tucking into 

 chicken bhartas and tandoori chickens. Better 

 to be safe than sorry... he quipped.

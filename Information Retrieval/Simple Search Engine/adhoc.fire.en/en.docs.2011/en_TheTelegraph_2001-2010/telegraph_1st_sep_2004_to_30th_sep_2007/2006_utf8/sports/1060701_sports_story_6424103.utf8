 Ravi Shastri

 Relaxed mind helps to stay focused

 I am strokeplayer, but often get out early going for the big hits. Should I change my attitude? 

 No. If you are a strokeplayer wait for the time and opportunity when you can play the strokes. Respect the pitch, conditions and the bowling. When you are ready, go for it.

 How can one concentrate better while playing? 

 When you are in a free and relaxed mind, it will help you to stay focused.

 What should be stressed on during off-season training? 

 First learnt to relax. Do things that are specific to enhance performance.

 I am a mediumpacer. When the batsman is in a defensive mode how should one bowl at him? 

 Its a game of patience. Variation in your bowling is very important. Also, your gameplan will depend on the attitude of the batsman every 15/20 minutes.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. Can swing be developed with practice at nets or is it in-born? 

 Practice. A good grip and wrist position is very important. A good coach can also be of great help.

 I am a mediumpacer and often end up bowling wide when striving for pace. Please help? 

 Check your action at the time of delivery.

 How can one swing with the old ball? 

 If you can swing the new ball properly, then the same qualities will stand you in good stead when it comes to swinging the old ball. A steady head at the time of delivery, good action, wrist position and extra pace could be of great help.

 I am a top-order batsman. I often fall leg before when going across to incoming deliveries. Please help. 

 Dont go across. Wait for the ball and play late so that you are in a position to move your feet once you know where the ball is. Bottomline is dont commit yourself.

 I am a slip fielder. I have poor reflexes and is there anyway I can improve it? 

 As long as you have reflexes, work on it and improve it. There is nothing called poor reflexes? Either you have it or you dont.

 I am a righthanded batsman. Should I stand outside the crease or within it while taking stance? 

 All depends on who is bowling to you. If the ball is swinging too much, then it will be a good idea to stand ahead and negate the swing. If a spinner is bowling, always stand within the crease. Otherwise, you could get stumped.

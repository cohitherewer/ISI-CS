 Iraq hold Saudi Arabia 2-2

Bangalore: Iraq made a late surge and held fancied Saudi Arabia 2-2 in the group D match of the AFC Youth Championship at Sri Kanteerva Stadium here on Monday. 

Ahmad Kabee (ninth minute) and Al Sahlawi Mohammed (51st minute) scored for Saudi Arabia while Alaa Khshen (26th minute) and Halkard Mohammed (82nd minute) scored for the Iraqis. 

Opening their campaign, two-time champions Saudi Arabia shot into the lead as early as the ninth minute when Kabee made no mistake in landing the ball passed by forward Naif Hazazi. Naif carried the ball in a solo effort near the goalmouth and Kabee quickly pushed the ball into the net. 

Undeterred, Iraq went on the hunt for the equaliser, which they found in the 26th minute through Alaa Khshenm who scored off an accurate move by skipper Kaldooni Mohammed. The teams went into the lemon break at 1-1. 

Most part of the second session belonged to Saudi team as they stepped up their attack and succeeded in going into the lead once again through forward Al Sahlwi Mohammed. 

Al Sahlwi, who was working on the left wing, got the ball and passed on to Kabee, who in turn fed Naif. Al Sahlwi, who had moved near the goalmouth by then, beat the Iraq goalkeeper Alla Jias. 

Stung by the second goal, Iraq made repeated forays to outwit their rivals. Iraq could have found its second goal in the 60th minute itself, as Halkard came near scoring, but Saudis Ibrahim Shranili cleared the ball. 

However, Halkard came good in 82nd minute when his kick off a pass from Amar Abdal Naba bulged the net. Iraq goalkeeper Alla Jias and defender Amar were shown yellow cards by referee Junjie Huang of China. 

Saudi midfielder Motaz Al Mosa and forward Naif also received yellow cards. (PTI)

 Dhorasoo suspended by PSG

 Dhorasoo

Paris: Paris St Germain said on Tuesday that they had suspended international midfielder Vikash Dhorasoo after the player publicly challenged coach Guy Lacombe. 

In an interview published by a French sports daily last week, Dhorasoo disputed Lacombes tactics after he was dropped from the professional squad and was sent back to play for PSGs amateur team. 

Dhorasoo, who has not played in PSGs last four outings, said he felt humiliated and called the coach a liar. 

The public statements and the behaviour of Vikash Dhorasoo led the clubs managing staff to summon him for a meeting which is to take place early next week with chairman Alain Cayzac in order to collect the players comments about the events which occurred recently, said a statement issued by the club. 

Taking the seriousness of the facts into account, the club has decided that the player is suspended from this day until further notice the statement said. 

His club coach said Dhorasoo did not train with enough dedication. When you consider his skills, his biggest mistake is his lack of professionalism, Lacombe said last week. 

Dhorasoo says he wants to stay at PSG until his contract expires in June 2007. But hes not happy to continue playing with the reserve team. 

I want to go to the end of my contract, Dhorasoo said. I hope I will do so. If I have to apologise, I will do so to my president. Well see how the meeting goes. I have faith in this meeting. I dont see the point of playing in the reserves. I dont see the point for me, for PSG, for the fans.

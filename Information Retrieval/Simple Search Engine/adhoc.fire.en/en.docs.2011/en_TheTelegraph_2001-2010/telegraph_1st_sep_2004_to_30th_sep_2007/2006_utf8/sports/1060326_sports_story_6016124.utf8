The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Velvet Rope may lift Leger 

 HONKY DORY

 Velvet Rope

Four of the 11 horses in the fray 

 ? Mystical, Holding Court, Velvet Rope and Romantic Liaison 

 ? are capable of landing the last and the longest Classic 

 of the Mumbai winter season, the 2,800m Indian St Leger, 

 on Sunday. The over-raced and extensively travelled Mystical 

 and Holding Court may find the going tough against the well-rested 

 Indian Derby winner, Velvet Rope and Romantic Liaison, who 

 was ridden poorly in the same race. All things considered, 

 Vinayaks Velvet Rope appears to have an edge over 

 the three.

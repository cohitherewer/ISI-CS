 Quick Takes

 Rooney clears footwear of fault 

 London: Wayne Rooney insists 

 new boots were not responsible for his foot injury. The 

 Manchester United and England striker was wearing the new-design 

 Nike Total 90 Supremacy boots at Stamford Bridge 

 on Saturday.

 He dismissed any suggestion they 

 might have contributed to the injury that even in the best-case 

 scenario will rule him out of action for six weeks. 

 He told MuTV: I dont 

 think my football boots had anything to do with the injury. 

 Before we actually wear the boots they get tested out to 

 make sure theyre suitable for playing in. The boots 

 have been checked out and the boots are fine.

 for midfielder Andrius Gedgaudas to volley home unchallenged

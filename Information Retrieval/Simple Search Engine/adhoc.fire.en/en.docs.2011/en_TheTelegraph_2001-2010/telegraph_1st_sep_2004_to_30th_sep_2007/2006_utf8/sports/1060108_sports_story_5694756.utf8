Lahore: Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and the openers hit early form with half-centuries to help India to 298 for four on the opening day of their three-day tour match against Pakistan A on Saturday. 

Batting in bitter cold, openers Gautam Gambhir (53) and Wasim Jaffer (58) gave India a good start on a flat track after the visitors won the toss. 

VVS Laxman (25) and Yuvraj Singh (11) were batting at the close. The tour game is Indias only practice match before the first Test from January 13. 

Tendulkar was in fluent form hitting 10 fours in his 74 while Dravid made 63 from 100 balls with seven fours. 

Dravid was caught in the final over before tea by Hasan Raza off Imran Farhat in the covers and Tendulkar edged pacer Yasir Arafat behind to keeper Zulqarnain Haider. 

The home side includes nine Test and international players. 

Gambhir was the first man out caught at point by Rao Iftkhar off pacer Mohammed Irshad while Jaffer, who made 58 from 102 balls with eight fours, was caught behind off Umar Gul. It was a welcome return to form for the Delhi batsmen who failed in the series versus Sri Lanka. 

Gambhir fell just before lunch, taken with India on 88 for one, and immediately after the post-lunch session it was the turn of Jaffer, who has forced his way back into the national squad with big scores in domestic cricket, to depart. 

The righthander was out to a good ball off Gul, who is on a comeback trail after bowling Pakistan to a victory in the Test against India in 2004 and suffering a back injury that robbed him of 20 months of cricket. 

Gambhir played some pleasing shots square of the wicket shots on the off side while Jaffer played well off the back foot and it is going to be a tough decision for the tour selection committee to pick between the duo to partner Sehwag. 

Also running into encouraging form were Dravid and Tendulkar, who too looked very good and batted fluently before being out to a poor shot, caught behind while trying to slash a short, wide ball. 

Jaffer hopeful 

Jaffer hoped his performance in the tour-game Saturday would hold him in good stead. 

Its important to start a tour game on a good note as it has been observed in the past that there have been instances when happenings in a tour game have made an impact on a Test series, said the opener. 

I am happy with my performance. The wicket was good to bat on though there was some movement earlier on. Gul bowled well. Hes an international quality bowler, Jaffer told reporters at the Bagh-e-Jinnah ground here.

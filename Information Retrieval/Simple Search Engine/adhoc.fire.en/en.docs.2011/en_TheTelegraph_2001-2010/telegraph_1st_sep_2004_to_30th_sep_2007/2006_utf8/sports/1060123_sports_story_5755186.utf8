The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Aperitivo set to win again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Aperitivo will be the cynosure of all eyes in Mondays eight-event card. Vijay Singhs money-making machine takes on six rivals vying for the Indian Champion Cup ? a race to determine the champion among champions. Although the race has lost some of its shine owing to the absence of Romantic Liaison, Aristotle and Arturo, yet the second line of youthful challengers like Rasalas and Supreme Princess could provide some competition to the Diffident-Dramatic Irony son who is going to be the hot-favourite to win the crown.

 The Indian Champagne Stakes may draw an equal amount of interest thanks to the presence of Vijays Ardelis in the line-up. The three-year-old colt had made a smashing debut.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

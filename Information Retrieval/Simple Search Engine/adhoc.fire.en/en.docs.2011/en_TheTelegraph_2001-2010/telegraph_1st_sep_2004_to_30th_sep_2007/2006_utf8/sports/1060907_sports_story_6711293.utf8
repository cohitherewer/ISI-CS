 Anand named top seed

Rishon-Lezion (Israel): World No. 2 Viswanathan Anand starts as the top seed and hot favourite in the World Blitz Chess Championship which starts here on Thursday. 

The 16-player round-robin event will see some top stars even though world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria will be sorely missed. 

For Anand, the biggest challenge could come from Norways Magnus Carlsen who had beaten the Indian ace in their last blitz encounter earlier this year at Reykjavik. (PTI)

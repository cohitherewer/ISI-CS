 Sehwag clarifies on Sourav

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Jamshedpur: A day after commenting that the Sourav Ganguly episode is a thing of the past for Team India, Virender Sehwag clarified on Wednesday that he was referring to the past controversy over the former captain. 

 Im not saying that I have forgotten Sourav. I actually wanted to say that weve forgotten the controversy which had cropped up over him in the past, Sehwag opined, clarifying his comments on Tuesday when he said past is past and we are looking ahead to the World Cup. 

Incidentally, the bring-back Sourav chorus reverberated across the Keenan for quite some time when the Indian top-order once again failed and eventually lost the match to England. 

Sehwag, however, played down such public stand, saying that, They always back one who plays well and jeer others who fail. But the team is not picked on the basis of public opinion.

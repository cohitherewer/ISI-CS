 in by Polaks red card

 On Target

 In 

 an open group in which none of the four teams 

 were sure of qualifying till their final game on Thursday, 

 Italy went on to face the Czech Republic knowing that a 

 draw would suffice. 

 The situation, however, begged 

 for attention in other respects as well. Meeting of familiar 

 foes like Pavel Nedved, who has won three Serie A titles 

 with Juventus, and AC Milan defender Marek Jankulovski, 

 meant the Czechs were not strangers to Italys strengths 

 and weaknesses. The Czechs may not boast of having a domestic 

 league like Serie A, but they are No. 2 in Fifa rankings. 

 Then, there was an urgency from both teams to top the group, 

 because emerging as the second-best was an invitation to 

 bump into Brazils path in the next round. 

 All this led to a cautious start 

 for Lippis side, almost true to their tradition: A 

 safety-first policy with no fuss about the job, however 

 exigent it appeared to be. The Czechs, on the other hand, 

 had to win to guarantee a place in knock-out stage and so, 

 their start was in juxtaposition with the need: Forays into 

 the rival box right from the word go. 

 Milan Baros ? who returned to 

 the side after being forced to miss the first couple of 

 matches with injury ? missed a sitter with an awful trapping 

 in the eighth minute. Had he scored at that time, the Czechs 

 might have got the momentum, they were looking for in surviving 

 this battle of nerves. The Italian keeper then brilliantly 

 negotiated two Nedved shots in quick succession. Soon after 

 Nesta ? the fulcrum of Italian backline ? limped off the 

 field. 

 So just when the Czechs were sniffing 

 at a breakthrough by dint of continuous attacks into the 

 Italian box, Marco Materazzi ? Nestas 17th-minute 

 replacement ? changed the complexion of the game. 

 Not only did he hand his team 

 a goal against the run of the play in the 26th minute ? 

 his header off Francesco Tottis corner was a clinical 

 finish ? and helped his teammates win back confidence, but 

 also upset the opponents plans. As if that was not 

 enough, the Czechs were condemned into further difficulty 

 when midfielder Jan Polak was given marching orders following 

 a double booking in the first-half stoppage time. 

 It was not easy fighting for a 

 cause with 10 men in the stage as big as the World Cup and 

 I must say, the Czech Republics ambitions were shattered 

 with this setback. 

 During the break, Ghanas 

 surprise 2-1 lead over the US must have reached the Czech 

 camp, and understandably, they had no option but to go for 

 an all-out attack in the second session. Nedved tried his 

 best constantly distributing the balls towards flanks whenever 

 the team was on the attack and even tasted Buffon time and 

 again with his long-range shooting. 

 With the injured Baros being a 

 shadow of his past (he had to be substituted in the 64th 

 minute), the Czechs clearly missed the service of injured 

 Jan Koller and suspended Vratislav Lokvenc upfront. So the 

 attacking inspiration from Nedved didnt have a proper 

 channel to meet its destination. 

 You should also keep in mind Italys 

 reputation as a defensive organisation. Hardly a weakness 

 will be detected in this backline and from right back Fabio 

 Grosso, to central defenders Materazzi and Cannavaro, to 

 left-back Zambrotta, everybody put up a near flawless rearguard 

 performance. In case such a strongly-guarded line of defence 

 was breached, there was Buffon to frustrate Nedved amp; 

 Co. 

 When a team goes on the full-range 

 offensive, they do it being aware that their very own backline 

 is exposed to quick counter-attacks. Thats exactly 

 what happened to the Czechs when Filippo Inzaghi, another 

 Italian substitute, made it 2-0. 

 You need luck as well as a good 

 strike force to stay afloat in the World Cup. Sadly, the 

 Czechs missed out on both counts. Conversely, its 

 the big-club experience of the players which helped Italy 

 sustain the Czech pressure and avoid an immediate clash 

 with Brazil. But they are slated to meet the champions in 

 the quarters. What a match it would be!

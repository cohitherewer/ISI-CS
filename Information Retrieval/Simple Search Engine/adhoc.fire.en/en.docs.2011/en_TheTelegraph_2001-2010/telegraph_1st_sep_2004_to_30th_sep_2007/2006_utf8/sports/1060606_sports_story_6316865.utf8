 ACA proposal to BCCI

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Guwahati: The Assam Cricket Association (ACA) has requested the BCCI to convince the International Cricket Council (ICC) to constitute a panel of experts to decide on the fate of a match hit by inclement weather or crowd trouble instead of leaving the decision to the umpires. 

Claiming that the BCCI as well as the ICC have expressed satisfaction over the ACA report on the crowd trouble following the abandonement of the April 9 Guwahati one-dayer between India and Engalnd, ACA secretary Bikash Baruah Monday said the ACA placed the said proposal at the June 1 BCCI special general meeting in Mumbai. 

The same proposal was also incorporated in the ACA report to the BCCI for the abandoned tie wherein it had blamed the umpires for calling off the match.

 Afro-Asian Cup in June 2007

Mumbai: The second edition of the Afro-Asian Cup will be held in June 2007, in Africa while the twice postponed Asia Cup will now be held in April 2008, in Pakistan. 

The dates for the two events were finalised after a meeting of the Asian Cricket Council executive board in Colombo Sunday. 

Also, the third episode of the Afro-Asian Cup would be hosted by Malaysia in June 2008, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said from Colombo. 

The inter-continental event, pitting collection of Asian players against their African counterparts in a series of limited-overs Internationals, was first held in South Africa last August. (PTI)

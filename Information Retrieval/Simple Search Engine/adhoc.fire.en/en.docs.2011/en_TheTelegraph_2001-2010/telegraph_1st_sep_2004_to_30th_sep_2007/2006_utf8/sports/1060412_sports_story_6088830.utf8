Fatullah (Bangladesh): Adam Gilchrist struck a robust century to lead an Australian fightback against Bangladesh on the third day of the first Test here on Tuesday. 

The hard-hitting left-hander struck a gritty 144 to help avoid the ignominy of a follow-on before the Australian bowlers struck crucial blows in Bangladeshs second innings. 

Bangladesh, who dismissed Australia for 269 in reply to their 427, were 124 for five in their second innings. Rajin Saleh (29) and Khaled Mashud (zero) remained unbeaten at the end of the day. 

After gaining a 158-run lead, the home side were 282 runs ahead with four wickets still remaining in their bid to set a big target and try for only their second win in 43 Tests. 

Bangladesh failed to capitalise on the lead, while Australia ? who had a forgettable opening days ? looked determined to show why they are the worlds top team. 

Bangladesh, who have lost both their previous Tests to Australia by innings margins, squandered a fine start to their second innings. 

Openers Shahriar Nafees (33) and Javed Omar (18) failed to get big knocks while captain Habibul Bashar (7) was run out by a direct throw from Michael Clarke. 

Bangladesh fell from 48 for no loss to 77 for four when Stuart Clark tapped Mohammed Ashraful (4) leg before to pick his first wicket of the match. 

Aftab Ahmed (17) became leg-spinner Stuart Macgills victim to raise Australias hopes towards the end of the day. 

Australia, who came here after a 3-0 Test series triumph in South Africa, suffered a batting collapse on the second day, but Gilchrist produced a fine knock under pressure. 

Gilchrist, who was unbeaten on 51 on Monday, batted with purpose to take his team past the target of 228 to avoid batting again. 

The 34-year-old completed his 16th ton in 84 Tests with a drive through the covers off part-time spinner Saleh and continued to plunder runs in the company of tail-enders. 

He smashed 14 fours and six huge sixes, much to the home sides frustration. 

Gilchrist added 73 valuable runs with Jason Gillespie (26) for the eighth wicket and 39 with Clark (zero) for the next, forcing the Bangladesh bowlers to end up bowling a restrictive line and length. 

Gilchrist, who on Monday passed 5,000 runs in Tests, helped Australia wriggle out of an embarrassing position as Bangladesh have never managed to force a follow-on upon any team since gaining Test status in 2000. 

For the home side, left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique worked hard to bag his seventh five-wicket haul in 25 Tests, which included the prize scalp of Gilchrist. 

Rafique finished with five for 62 as Gilchrist was the last man out for the Aussies when he holed out to Shahadat Hossain at deep mid-wicket. 

Australia, meanwhile, have included left-arm seamer Nathan Bracken and rookie off-spinner Dan Cullen in their squad for the second Test, CA said on Tuesday. 

The 28-year-old Bracken has played five Tests and 36 one-day Internationals.

 The Hair controversies

Australian umpire Darrell Hair got embroiled in yet another controversy on Sunday. The following is the list: 

 The Adelaide Test between Australia and the West Indies 

 (January 23 to 26, 1993) was a fluctuating match won by 

 the visitors by one run. Victory was achieved when Australias 

 No. 11 batsman Craig McDermott was dismissed after a 40-run 

 partnership with Tim May. Hair ruled that a short-pitched 

 ball from Courtney Walsh had brushed McDermotts glove 

 and upheld the appeal for a catch, but many observers believed 

 that McDermott had not gloved the ball. 

 According to Wisden (1995 ed., pp1086-7), during the Adelaide 

 Test between Australia and South Africa (January 28 to February 

 1, 1994), Peter Kirsten had an animated conversation 

 with Hair after three of his teammates were given out lbw. 

 This was followed by another outburst when he was 

 given out leg-before himself in the second innings, 

 resulting in Kirsten being fined a total of 65 per cent 

 of his match fee. 

 In his only match between Australia and Sri Lanka in Melbourne 

 on December 26 to December 30, 1995 Hair called Muttiah 

 Muralidharan seven times in three overs for throwing. Wisden 

 (1997 ed., p.1129-30) stated that unusually, he (Hair) 

 made his judgement from the bowlers end, and several 

 minutes passed before the crowd realised that Muralidharans 

 elbow, rather than his foot, was at fault. Muralidharan 

 was brought on at the other end, and was not called by either 

 Hair or his colleague, New Zealander R.S. Dunne, although 

 Hair told the Sri Lankans at tea on Day II that he was ready 

 to call him from the strikers end. Hair did not umpire 

 another Test match involving Sri Lanka until their tour 

 of the West Indies in 2003. 

 In the final Test between England and Pakistan at The Oval 

 on August 20, 2006, Hair decided that the ball had been 

 tampered with by the Pakistan players. During tea, visitors 

 decided not to return to the field in protest against the 

 decision. Umpires Hair and Doctrove, along with the English 

 batsmen, returned to the field and spent the allowed two 

 minutes waiting at the crease to no avail. Given that the 

 Pakistan team was not willing to play at that time, Hair 

 removed the bails and the game was officially called off 

 for the day.

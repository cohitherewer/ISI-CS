 Lehmann wants to coach England 

Melbourne: Former Australian Test batsman Darren Lehmann has thrown his hat in the ring to take over from Duncan Fletcher after the Zimbabwean steps down as England coach next year. 

If the opportunity came up to coach England, Id certainly want to do it, Lehmann, who is president of the Australian Cricketers Association, said on Saturday night. 

To be perfectly honest, you never say never, do you? I know the England players quite well. At the moment, Ive got a lot of things on and Im still playing cricket, which makes it difficult to coach anyone, he was quoted as saying by a daily. 

Lehmann has spent seven fruitful seasons at Yorkshire and is regarded as one of the games shrewdest thinkers. 

At the traditional Test dinner in Adelaide on Thursday, Darren Gough said Lehmann would be the ideal successor to Fletcher.

 India open with 6-0 victory 

 - We lacked punch, says Tirkey after netting three goals vs Bangladesh 

JAYDEEP BASU

 Doha: India opened their Asian Games hockey campaign with a thumping 6-0 victory over Bangladesh at the Al Rayyan Hockey Field on Monday, but the post-match smiles appeared to be a forced one. The margin of victory was huge on paper, it was not exactly an authentic triumph. 

The biggest problem was the lack of fluency and coordination in the forwardline that resulted in India not being able to push through the Bangladesh defence despite dominating for the entire period. On Tuesday, when India take on a vastly improved China, such mediocrity might not take them very far. China defeated Oman 6-1. 

The pick of the lot, however, was captain Dilip Tirkey, who scored three goals from the penalty corners. Indias rate of penalty corner conversion was the biggest plus of the day they scored from four of the seven they got. 

Still, Tirkey didnt sound happy. It was a good beginning, but we lacked the punch. 

Coach Vasudevan Baskaran, however, remained unperturbed. It is a new team and only the beginning of the tournament. The youngsters should be given more time. 

But those in the know are well aware that assistant coach Harendra Singh has more say in running the team than his immediate superior. Harendra was seen sitting beside the press box and loudly issuing instructions during the the match. Sitting a few rows away, IHF secretary Jyothikumaran was watching quietly. 

Even Harendra had to admit that all is not well with the forwardline. While Shivendra Singh and Ajmer Singh were fumbling at the rival goalmouth, the induction of Adam Sinclair also did not improve the situation. 

Harendra said: Our aim was to score eight goals. 

For the handful of fans who were dutifully waving the tricolour after every Indian move, it was a good beginning as Tirkey struck in the third minute from the first penalty corner. It was a straight hit that entered the goal exposing the chinks in the Bangladesh defence. 

Three more goals came in the first half. After Tirkey increased the lead with a similar penalty corner strike in the 29 th minute, Shivendra Singh got the better of Bangladesh goalkeeper Rehman Khan with a reverse flick. Tirkey added one more, two minutes before half-time. 

Drag flicker Raghunaths goal was the only talking point in the second half. Adam Sinclair struck the last goal in the 54 th minute.

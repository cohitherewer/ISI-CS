 Fiery SA feast on Pak

 - Pak cave in for 89 as Ntini takes 5/21

 - Treble for Pollock 

Motera: Makhaya Ntini claimed five for 21 in a devastating display of seam bowling as South Africa steamrolled Pakistan by 124 runs to move to the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy here on Friday. 

The 29-year-old speed gun whipped the cream off Pakistani top order before Charl Langeveldt (3 for 20) and veteran Shaun Pollock (2 for 20) joined in the party to restrict Pakistan to a lowly 89 in 25 overs in what turned out to be a one-sided clash. 

Pollock alsocaught Imran Farhat, the 100th catch of his career. He also became only the sixth player in ODIs to complete the unique record of scoring 1000 runs, while taking 100 wickets and 100 catches. 

Credit for the comprehensive South African victory should also go to Mark Boucher (69) and Justine Kemp (64) who put on 131 runs off 187 balls for the sixth wicket to lift their team from a precarious 42 for five and post a competitive 213 for eight on a track, which had a lot of carry and bounce. 

The win helped South Africa finish on four points from their three games and become the second team from group B after New Zealand to make it to the last four of the elite tournament. 

South Africa, in fact, topped the group on net run rate and would now play the second semi-final at Jaipur on November 2, while New Zealand will play the first semi-final here a day before. 

Their opponents would be decided after the last group A league match between India and Australia here on Sunday, with the West Indies having confirmed their berth from that group. 

Pakistan, who were skittled out for their lowest total against the Proteas, were chucked out after finishing with two defeats from three matches. 

Pakistani batsmen showed neither the application nor the desire to resurrect their innings as eight of them were dismissed in single digit scores. 

Ironically, tailender Yasir Arafat was their top scorer with 27 and extras were the second highest contributor to the total at 16.

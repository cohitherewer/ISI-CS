 Montoya is done with F1

 Chicago: McLarens Juan Pablo Montoya 

 will leave Formula One at the end of this season to drive 

 in Nascar, reuniting the Colombian with car owner Chip Ganassi. 

Ganassi announced the surprise move ahead of Sundays Nascar race at Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Illinois. 

We are thrilled to be getting a driver of this calibre to put into the No. 42 Texaco/Havoline Dodge, added Ganassi in a statement. Juan Pablo is one of the best race car drivers in the world. He is a former Cart Champion, Indy 500 winner and Formula One driver that will bring a much needed veteran presence to our team. 

Montoya captured the Indy 500 in 2000 and the Cart championship in 1999, driving for Ganassi, but has never raced in a Nascar event. 

 I am so happy to be entering the fastest growing 

 racing league in the world, said Montoya. Ive 

 thought about this for quite some time but the opportunity 

 had to be right.

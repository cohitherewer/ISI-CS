The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Playing Sourav will mean a little injustice to him

Stump View

Who would have thought before the Indians had landed 

in Pakistan that both teams would arrive for the third and final Test in Karachi 

after two high-scoring drawn games?

And to make the finale more intriguing and result-oriented, 

we hear that a green-top has been prepared.

I am sure that there would be butterflies in the bellies 

of batsmen while the seamers must be smiling ear-to-ear. Obviously, their contrasting 

moods are quite understandable.

After all, batsmen from either side made a mockery 

of the bowlers in the first two games and now it seems to be payback time.

Pakistan, being the home team, have the luxury of 

including players as they choose and thats exactly what they have done by 

naming Umar Gul in the 16-man squad. He is more or less like Glenn McGrath ? not 

express fast but keeps teasing the batsmen outside the off-stump with controlled 

swing.

Pakistans real problems are not in the bowling 

department but in batting.

There are question marks on the fitness of Inzamam-ul 

Haq, while Shoaib Malik is absent owing to the demise of his father. Salman Butt 

too has not played a big innings in the series so far.

Knowing Inzamam for the last 15 years, I am willing 

to put my money on him taking the field on Sunday because he is a great competitor 

and this series means a lot to him. 

I think Pakistan should persist with Kamran Akmal 

as Salmans opening partner for the simple fact that he showed better technique 

and temperament in Faisalabad.

To fill Kamrans slot in middle-order, Pakistan 

have two options ? play Farhat at one-down and push all the batsmen one position 

down or include an in-form Faisal Iqbal at No.6. If I was the captain, I would 

play Faisal because he has been consistent this season, having hit eight first-class 

centuries and looks more mature than he was when he last played for Pakistan. 

I hear India are also contemplating the inclusion of Sourav Ganguly in place of 

Harbhajan Singh.

If true, it is a wise move but will mean a little 

injustice to Sourav who is involved in a musical chair with Yuvraj Singh for a 

middle-order berth.

Sourav is badly short on match practice and his confidence 

level would also be low after what has happened to him in the last five Tests.

While he would be determined and motivated to prove 

his critics wrong, I am sure he would also be aware of the fact that if he gets 

a chance, then this Karachi Test would be a make-or-break one for him. Toss will 

be crucial but I believe both captains would love to lose it so that they do not 

have to make a decision. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Still a long way to go: De Ridder

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The look on his face said it all. Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya admitted that Mohun Bagans chances in National League are as good as over. 

The title race is now between East Bengal, Mahindra United and to a certain extent, Sporting Clube de Goa, Bhattacharya conceded after the green-and-maroons 1-3 loss against arch-rivals East Bengal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday. 

Terming Dharamjit Singhs red card and Tomba Singhs dislocation of the left-knee as turning points of the match, Bhattacharya said, (Awudu) Ibrahims miss was a debacle. The way he missed an open net in the very first minute, has to be seen to be believed. 

On whether Dharamjit Singh should be penalised further for his off-the-ball retaliation against Jayanta Sen, which resulted in him being sent-off and put Bagan at a disadvantage, Bhattacharya said, he is a professional and hence shouldnt have reacted the way he did. But I dont think we need to penalise him any more. He has learnt from his mistake. 

But if Bhattacharya felt his arch-rivals are ahead in race for being champions, East Bengal coach Philippe de Ridder appeared in no mood to harbour such thoughts. 

Its a fantastic victory, but there is still a long, long way to go, Ridder said during the post-match press conference. 

We wanted a win very badly and were in a better shape today. We hardly gave them space to operate, the East Bengal coach said, adding We kept on pushing and prodding till we had the match in hand. 

Despite being given a tough time in the second half by a 10-man Bagan ? when they also scored their lone goal ? Ridder felt there were no chinks in East Bengals armour. 

Im happy with the defence? With the overall performance. No match is perfect, but still we ended up winning 3-1. Isnt that amazing?

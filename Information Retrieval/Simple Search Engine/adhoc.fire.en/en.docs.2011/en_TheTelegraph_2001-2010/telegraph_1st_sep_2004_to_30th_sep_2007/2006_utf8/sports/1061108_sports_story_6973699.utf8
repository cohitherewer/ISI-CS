 Umrigar passes away at 80 

 Mumbai: Former 

 India captain Polly Umrigar died on Tuesday of cancer, his 

 family said. He was 80 and is survived by his wife, two 

 sons and a daughter. 

A former Test batsman of repute, Umrigar died at 8:30 pm at his residence here. 

Dilip Vengsarkar, also former India captain and current chief selector, said the news of Umrigars death was shocking. 

He was our manager. I learnt a lot from him. I cannot express my grief in words, he said, adding that the void left by Umrigar would be difficult to fill. 

Umrigar, known as the Palm Tree Hitter for his ability to strike huge sixes, was one of the reliable middle-order batsmen during the 1950s and represented India in 59 Tests. 

He led India in eight Tests from 1955 to 1958, winning two and losing two. 

Umrigar, affectionately addressed as Polly kaka, was one of the few cricketers who could not only prepare good wickets, but also read wickets well. For years, the wickets at the Wankhede were prepared by him. 

Umrigar was also chairman of selectors, team manager and BCCI executive secretary. 

Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar described Umrigar as a perfect gentleman and said that Indian cricket was passing through a bad phase and the death of Umrigar was part of this cup of woes. 

The time is not good for Indian cricket and the passing away of Umrigar is another sad event. He was a great cricketer, and even more importantly, a perfect gentleman. 

Nari Contractor, who was among Umrigars closest friends, said: He was a great cricketer, a superb strokeplayer, a fine allrounder and brilliant fielder. 

 Sharad Pawar said the BCCI was 

 likely to institute a trophy and a cash award of Rs 5 lakh 

 for the most promising cricketer of the year in his memory.

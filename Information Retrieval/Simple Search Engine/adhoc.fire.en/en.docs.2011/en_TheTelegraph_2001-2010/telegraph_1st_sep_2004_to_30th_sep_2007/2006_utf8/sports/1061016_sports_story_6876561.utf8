Jaipur: India relied on a clinical display by their bowlers to launch their Champions Trophy campaign with a four-wicket victory over England in a group A contest here on Sunday. 

After the bowlers bundled out the visitors for 125 in 37 overs, the home team faced some anxious moments before overhauling the target with 20.3 overs to spare in a floodlit match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium. 

The Indians were cruising comfortably at 98 for two at one stage before losing four wickets in quick succession to make things a little too tight for themselves. Yuvraj Singh (27 not out) remained till the end as India scored 126 for six to notch up the victory. 

The hosts were well served by left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan who spearheaded an immaculate bowling performance. Munaf Patel (3/18) and Ramesh Powar (3/24) complimented Pathans extended new ball spell of 8-3-20-2 to rout the visitors to their lowest ever total against India. 

Sachin Tendulkar then guided the chase with an innings of 35 from 41 balls. and contained five fours. 

Sachin on Sunday became the worlds most capped one-day player. Sachin, who played in his 368th ODI match, surpassed Pakistan skipper Inzazmam-ul Haq and Sri Lankan veteran Sanath Jayasuriya, both of whom have played one less till now. 

The victory was worth two points for India who next face title holders, the West Indies, in their next clash in Ahmedabad on October 26. 

England await Ashes rivals Australia at the same venue on October 21. 

The previous lowest total by England against India was 149 in a World Cricket Series match in Australia in 1984-85. 

It turned out to be a pathetic batting performance with only Paul Collingwood (38) and Kevin Pietersen (27) being the notable scorers for England. 

England, who were routed 1-5 in the one-day series when they visited India early this year, showed no signs of having familiarised themselves with the subcontinent conditions. 

The 49-run partnership between Collingwood and Jamie Dalrymple (24) for the sixth wicket was the only bright phase of the England innings which ended in 37 overs, before the sunset. 

The Baroda left-arm seamer has struggled with the ball for most part of the year, and was dropped from the Test team on the tour of Caribbean in May-July and then from the one-day squad in the tri-series in Malaysia last month. 

Patel and Pathan combined to rip through the England top order and the visitors never really recovered from 55 for five after 19 overs. 

Patel provided the opening breakthrough by trapping Ian Bell leg before wicket. 

The innovation of sending captain Andrew Flintoff at No. 3 backfired with the all-rounder registering a blob, Pathan rapping him on the pads while trying to work across the line. (Agencies)

 QUICK TAKES

 Klinsmanns 

 Beetle sets off auction frenzy 

 Stuttgart: A 39-year-old 

 Volkswagen Beetle that once belonged to Germany coach Juergen 

 Klinsmann is on sale in a frenzied auction and has surpassed 

 the price of another Volkswagen once owned by Pope Benedict 

 sold a year ago. The blue 1967 VW convertible that Klinsmann 

 drove in 1994 and 1995 while playing at Tottenham Hotspur, 

 has jumped from 105,000 euros to over 300,000 euros ($383,200) 

 in an Internet auction site. The cars owner, who lives 

 in the Stuttgart suburb Boeblingen, wants to remain anonymous 

 but has registration papers that includes Klinsmanns 

 name as a previous owner, according to a local daily on 

 Saturday. I really couldnt recommend bidding 

 for that car, Klinsmann had said recently. It 

 was already completely rusty when I got rid of it.

 Storm cancels concert 

 Berlin: A heavy thunderstorm forced organisers 

 to cancel a major concert in Berlin on Friday intended to 

 thank fans for coming to the World Cup in Germany and offer 

 a foretaste of the 2010 finals in South Africa. The line-up 

 for the free Friday night concert at the landmark Brandenburg 

 Gate included US rapper Wyclef Jean, Jamaican singer Sean 

 Paul and an all-African super group put together by Senegalese 

 singer Youssou NDour. We are cancelling the 

 show with a heavy heart but the safety of visitors and artists 

 has absolute priority, said Fifa president Sepp Blatter.

 Rumtek monks to back Azzurri 

 Rumtek: When Italy take the field on Sunday, 

 it will have some unusual support ? some 300 monks at one 

 of Tibetan Buddhisms holiest monasteries will be praying 

 and cheering for the Azzurri. Its Italys fair 

 play during the tournament that has impressed the holy men 

 at the Rumtek monastery, high in the Himalayan mountains, 

 monks said. I am praying for Italy like many of my 

 colleagues here. The team has reached the finals after a 

 long gap and (are) playing in a fair manner, said 

 Tenzing Dorji, a 27 year-old monk.

 Italy may not be allowed 

 to bid 

 Berlin: Favourites Italy are in danger of 

 losing out on their bid to stage the European Championship 

 in 2012 as a result of the Serie A match-fixing scandal, 

 a Uefa official has said. A member of Uefas executive 

 committee, who has a vote when the decision is made in December, 

 has said that unless the management committee of the Italian 

 football federation (FIGC) is totally overhauled, Italy 

 cannot be awarded the 16-team tournament. Italy are competing 

 against joint bids from Poland/Ukraine and Hungary/Croatia.

 Gallagher for Del Piero 

 Berlin: Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher plans 

 to appear in final wearing a special outfit at the request 

 of Alessandro Del Piero. The Manchester City fan, who has 

 already seen Germany-Italy and England-Sweden, told www.fifaworldcup.com 

 that Del Piero is an Oasis fan. He comes to see us 

 when were over in Italy and hes been to see 

 us in France, Gallagher said. We did an interview 

 with him once and we got to know him. He gives us shirts 

 and he gave me a pair of his boots once, but I had to split 

 them with (brother) Liam ? hes got one boot and Ive 

 got the other.

 Buffons safe hands 

 Berlin: Italys Gianluigi Buffon can 

 enter the World Cup record book on Sunday. Buffon, who has 

 only given up an own-goal at the tournament, has not been 

 beaten for 453 minutes to rank fifth in the all-time ranking 

 for goalkeepers. A shutout against Italy will give Buffon, 

 last beaten in the 27th minute of Italys second group 

 game against the US, the tournament record. The current 

 mark is held by Italian Walter Zenga, who went 517 minutes 

 without conceding a goal at Italia 90.

 Sagnol plays defender 

 Berlin: While Franz Beckenbauer yesterday 

 berated the lack of courage from some teams 

 and how afraid the coaches were in the World 

 Cup finals, Willy Sagnol, the France defender, was lauding 

 the bravery of Raymond Domenech in allowing his players 

 to concentrate on defence. France have conceded only two 

 goals so far and their progress has been gritty and determined. 

 We have been lucky to have a coach who placed us in 

 front of our responsibilities and gave us the keys, 

 Sagnol said.

 Sagnol plays defender 

 Berlin: A little piece of the World Cup could be yours. Hamburg auction house Dechow says the organising committee has chosen it as a partner in disposing of tournament equipment ? and ensuring that not too much will end up in the garbage. A lot of the inventory can be reused, even if it is just to take a piece of the World Cup home, and enjoy that even if it has no practical use, Dechow manager Jan Broeker told a daily newspaper on Friday.

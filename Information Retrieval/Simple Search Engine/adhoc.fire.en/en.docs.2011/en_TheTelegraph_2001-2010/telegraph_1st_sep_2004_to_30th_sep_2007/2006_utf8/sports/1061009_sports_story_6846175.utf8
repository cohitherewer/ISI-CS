 Chopra two shots off lead

Greensboro: Daniel Chopra was in blazing form as he overcame icy conditions to shoot the days best six-under 66 and jump to tied sixth at the Chrysler Classic golf meet. 

At eight-under 206, Chopra, a Swede of Indian origin who just made the cut at 56th place is just two shots off joint leaders Davis Love III (68) and Chris Couch (69). 

Arjun Atwal continued to stay in there with his second eagle of the week and two birdies in his even par round of 72 that pegged him at tied 37th after being 28th overnight. 

It was Chopra who was the talk of the day, as he shot two batches of three birdies in a row, one each on front and back nine as the conditions became cold and icy. 

Chopra went out in the first group, but before that he warmed up on the range and went into the pro shop looking for mittens, which had to be brought out from storage. With that, he did well to shoot a score that once again gives him a chance of finding a breakthrough win on PGA Tour. He opened with a birdie on first and added three more in a row from fifth to seventh. On the back nine, he did the same with three in a row from 12th to 14th at which point he was seven under and blazing all the way. He cooled off with pars and a bogey on 16th during his superb round. 

I played really well and struck the ball just beautifully, the 32-year-old Chopra said after posting a 54-hole total of eight-under 208. 

It wasnt quite as windy as yesterday but it was colder and the air was heavier. The ball wasnt going anywhere near as far and therefore the wind was affecting it. Every shot that I had to shape one way or the other, I just shaped it perfectly. 

The Stockholm-born Chopra was briefly in lead with four holes to go. His 66 was later matched by American Lucas Glover. (PTI)

Calcutta: Sporting Union edged past Shambazar Club in dramatic fashion to lift the CAB Senior Knockout trophy at the Eden on Friday. 

Electing to bat, Sporting made 238 for five in allotted 45 overs, thanks to Arindam Das 122. In reply, Shambazar also finished their innings at the same score, but lost three more wickets than their opponents ? due to which Sporting emerged champions. 

Shambazar were cruising at 200 for two with Kamal Hasan Mondal (85) and Rakesh Krishnan (68) well-settled. But Ranadeb Bose dismissed Mondal in the 40th over, forcing Shambazar to lose momentum. 

When Avishek Jhunjhunwala started the final over, Shambazar needed 12 runs with four wickets in hand. B. Amit was run out and Anirban Chatterjee was dismissed. Debabrata Pal hit the penultimate ball for four but managed only a single when one more would have seen them through.

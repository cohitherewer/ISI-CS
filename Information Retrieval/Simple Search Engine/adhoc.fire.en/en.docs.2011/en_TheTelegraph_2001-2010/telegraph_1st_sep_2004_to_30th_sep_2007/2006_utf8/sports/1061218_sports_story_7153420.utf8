Johannesburg: Kerala seamer Sreesanth produced yet another lively spell of fast bowling to expose the chinks in the South African batting and bowl India to the brink of a rare overseas win in the first cricket Test Sunday. 

Set a daunting fourth innings target of 402, South Africa were looking down the barrel at 163 for five at close on the third day at the Wanderers here.The hosts were down to their last recognised pair of Ashwell Prince (54 not out) and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher (3 not out) with another 239 runs needed for victory. 

With two full days play remaining, a result is assured. 

Should India manage to win Monday, or the last day Tuesday, it would be only their first ever in South Africa and 27th in foreign soil from 194 matches a staggering low percentage of 13.47 of win abroad. 

Sreesanth, as in the first innings, was the hero again, capturing three for 47 from 17 overs, bowling consistently over 140 kmph even at the fag end of the day. 

After Zaheer Khan gave the opening breakthrough, having Herschelle Gibbs caught for nought in the first over of the innings, Sreesanth got into the act and picked up the next three wickets of Graeme Smith (10), Hashim Amla (17) and Jacques Kallis (27). 

A.B. de Villiers was then run out when he went for a non-existent run to plunge South Africa into crisis. 

Earlier, V.V.S. Laxman (73) shepherded the lower order to enable India post 236 in the second essay. Laxman featured in an impregnable stand with Zaheer Khan (37) of 70 runs from nearly two hours, helping the Indians take an overall lead of 401 runs. 

The visitors, resuming at overnight score of 146 for five, lost two wickets of Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18) and Anil Kumble (1) early but then capitalised on an unimpressive bowling performance by the hosts. 

The hosts, with the exception of Shaun Pollock, rarely bowled on to the stumps as Indians grafted their way to 90 runs in the morning session. 

Zaheer was very much the surprise packet as he presented a straight bat and concentrated hard in allowing Laxman to prosper. 

Smith, in desperation, brought himself on to the attack and Zaheer replied by first smashing him for a six over widish midwicket and later cutting him for four. 

In the four balls possible before lunch break, South Africa lost Gibbs who edged a catch to Sachin Tendulkar in the slips off Zaheer Khan for nought. The afternoon success was reserved for the first innings bowling hero Sreesanth who first fooled Smith into chasing a widish delivery and then had Amla in more conventional manner behind the stumps.

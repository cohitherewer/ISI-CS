 Atwal misses cut, again

 USPGA Duluth Meet

 Mickelson has taken 

 a 6-shot lead 

 Duluth: Arjun Atwals 

 struggle continued as he missed his fourth successive cut 

 after a forgettable second round of five-over 77 to crash 

 out of the Bellsouth Classic Golf tournament here.

 Atwal, who had come close to winning 

 here last year, had a first round of 73 but fell short by 

 six shots at TPC Sugarloaf.

 Daniel Chopra missed the cut too 

 as he finished with rounds of 73 and 73. Chopra might still 

 have squeezed in but for bogeys on 14th and 16th holes that 

 spelt disaster for him.

 Phil Mickelson, the defending 

 champion, who is using the Bellsouth Classic as a preparation 

 for the Masters, shot a 65 to take a 6-shot lead as he went 

 through the course at a record pace.

 His first round 63 matched the 

 course record and the 65 in second led to a 36-hole record 

 at 16-under 128. 

 The Tour record for four rounds 

 is 29 under by Joe Durant at 2001 Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.

 Atwal started with a double bogey 

 and never recovered. He had a birdie on third but bogeys 

 on fifth, eighth and ninth meant he turned in four-over 

 40 and then a birdie on a 13 th was more than neutralised 

 by two more bogeys on 15th and 18th as he signed for a 77 

 and went out.

 Chopra had two bogeys on either 

 side of the round and three birdies in his 73, which required 

 31 putts from him.

 Those chasing Mickelson included 

 Jose Maria Olazabal, who has a two-day total of 135, but 

 is still seven behind. J.J. Henry matched Mickelsons 

 65 to move into second at 134.

 Interestingly, Mickelson won the 

 2000 and 2005 Bellsouth in play-offs.

 Jeev in fifth spot

 Japan Golf

 Nagoya (Japan): Jeev Milkha 

 Singh added a one-under 71 to stay fifth at the midway stage 

 of ? 120m International Crowns Tournament at the Nagoya 

 Golf Clubs Wago course.

 Jeev, one of the early finishers 

 on the second day, is three behind co-leaders Nozomi Kawahara 

 (63) and Shingo Katayama (67), who are both at 10-under 

 130.

 First round leader Soushi Tajima 

 (69) is third at nine-under, while Brendan Jones (67) is 

 fourth at eight-under 132, one shot ahead of Jeev.

 The Indian needed just 24 putts 

 in his round, but had lot of problems reaching the greens 

 in regulation which hampered his scoring.

 He managed only 38 per cent greens 

 in regulation and had a roller-coaster of a round with five 

 birdies and four bogeys. His birdies came on second, fourth, 

 10th, 11th and 16th but bogeyed third, 12th, 13th and 18th.

 I am playing well and am 

 in a good position (three behind the leaders) at this stage, 

 Jeev said.

 For the second day in a row, the 

 consistent Katayama had a bogey-free round with three birdies 

 in his 67. Co-leader Kawahara opened with a bogey, but immediately 

 came back with an eagle on the next hole. He had three more 

 birdies on the front nine and another three on his way back, 

 including two on the 17th and 18th for a splendid 63. (PTI)

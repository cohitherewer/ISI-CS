The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sreesanths New Year gift to Malayalees

 - Strauss scalp was most satisfying 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Indore: To evict six batsmen on an absolute featherbed is no ordinary achievement, but Sreesanth did so at the MPCA Stadium (on Saturday) and walked away with his maiden Man-of-the-Match award. 

The 23-year-old quick had good reasons to be emotional. 

Yesterday was Vishu, the Malayalee New Year, and for the first time I wasnt at home... That was a regret, but if my family missed me dearly, Ive given them and all Malayalees a New Year gift... I dedicate my first award to every Malayalee, Sreesanth told The Telegraph at the team hotel. 

He has, in fact, become the fourth Indian (after Anil Kumble, Ashish Nehra and Ajit Agarkar) to bag six wickets in a one-dayer. 

The first (that of stand-in captain Andrew Strauss) gave most satisfaction as Id been hit for a couple of boundaries and quickly wanted his scalp... Of course, its not that Im going to forget the other dismissals, Sreesanth remarked, smiling. 

Understandably, he called his parents (V.S. Nair and Savithri Devi) in Kochi as soon as the Team India bus left the Stadium. 

Sreesanth, it may be recalled, made his ODI debut in the seasons first match at home ? in Nagpur against Sri Lanka, last October. He was impressive then and consistent performances saw him make his Test debut at the same centre, versus England, early last month. 

Im still learning and hope to build on the confidence gained in the past six months or so, he said. After the two ODIs in Abu Dhabi next week, Sreesanth will have much time to reflect on an excellent season and mentally prepare for the West Indies. 

 Incidentally, he believes sticking to basics 

 pays and, so, his approach wont be any different when 

 the 2006-07 season gets underway. Perhaps, Vikram Rajvir 

 Singh, who keeps getting exposed, can learn.

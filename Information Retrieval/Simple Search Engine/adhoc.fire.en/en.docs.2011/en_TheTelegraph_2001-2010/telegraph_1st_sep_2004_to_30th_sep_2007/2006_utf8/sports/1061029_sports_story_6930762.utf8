The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India to start cautiously, says Akhmedov

 - AFC youth championship kicks off today 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The city leg of the 33rd AFC Youth Championship kicks off on Sunday with two group A outings defending champions South Korea facing Jordan followed by hosts India taking on Kyrgyzstan. 

The Koreans will again start as favourites, but for the hosts, this is a big opportunity to reclaim some of the lost ground. India are given very few opportunities to rub shoulders with the Asian powerhouses. So, it remains to be seen how the likes of Lal Kamal Bhowmick, Shilton Paul and Sushil Kumar Singh grab it. 

Jordan, who have qualified after a long gap of 28 years, also claim to be strong contenders for the last-four position from Indias group. Group B consists of Thailand, UAE, China and Australia. Japan, Iran, Tajikistan and DPR Korea are in group C while Iraq, Malaysia, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia comprise group D. All the league matches of Group C and D will be held at the Kanteerava Stadium in Bangalore. 

The top four sides in the meet will advance to the Fifa under-20 World Cup, to be played in Canada from June 30 to July 22 next year. 

Its now time for the under-pressure Indian coach Islam Akhmedov, who has been in the post for quite some time, to deliver the goods. The match against Kyrgyzstan at the Salt Lake Stadium under the lights might give us a clue if his team can live up to expectations. 

We are happy with our preparations and I have a fit team, Akhmedov told a media conference on Saturday. 

Its also time to redeem the image following his teams below-par performance in the SAF Games in Colombo, where they finished fourth. 

The most memorable moment in the meet for India came in as far back as 1974, when they finished joint champions with Iran in Bangkok. Both teams were locked 2-2 in the regulation time and there was no provision for either extra time or shootouts at that time. 

Akhmedov, who is from Uzbekistan, stressed on cohesion in the squad, saying that the team is together for one year and understanding among the players is very good. But lack of knowledge about the opponents is bothering him. I havent even seen any video clippings of their matches in the qualifying stages, Akhmedov admitted. Yet, he remained positive. 

Those who have seen this Uzbek coach for some time know that he likes to play with one forward. But the strategy, he said, would be decided later. Our team will have a defensive orientation and, depending on the merit of the opponents, we will decide on our strategy well take a wait-and-watch policy, he said. 

On the contrary, Kyrgyzstan coach Zagid Valiev sounded upbeat and added that we are a strong side and hope to do well. However, we did not get much time to prepare, he said. 

While Kyrgyzstan landed in the city only on Saturday morning, Korea came five days ago, a fact that how serious they are in defending the title. According to the Korean coach, they have 11 players in their ranks who played in this years Korean league.

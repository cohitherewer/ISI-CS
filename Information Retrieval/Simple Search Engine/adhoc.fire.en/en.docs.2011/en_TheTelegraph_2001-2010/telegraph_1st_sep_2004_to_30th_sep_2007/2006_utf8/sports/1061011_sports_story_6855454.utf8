 Allan Border steps down as selector

Melbourne: Former Australia captain Allan Border has resigned as a member of the Cricket Australia national selection panel, saying he was unable to give the job its deserving attention. 

The veteran of 156 Tests and 273 one-day Internationals, who also serves on the boards of Queensland Cricket and Cricket Australia, was a selector between 1998 and 2005 before rejoining the panel in June this year. I loved working as a selector and this influenced me to accept the invitation to rejoin this year, he said. 

But my various commitments are far heavier than I had expected back in mid-year and I dont think it is appropriate to do what is a really important job if I am not able to give it the full attention it deserves. 

I am really passionate and absolutely committed to making a continuing contribution to cricket through my board work and through my involvement in the CA committee that will decide the next national coach. (Agencies)

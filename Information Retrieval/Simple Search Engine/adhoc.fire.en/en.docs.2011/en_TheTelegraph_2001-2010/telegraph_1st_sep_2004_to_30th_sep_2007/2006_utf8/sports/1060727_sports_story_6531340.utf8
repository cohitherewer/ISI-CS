Manchester: Captain Andrew Strauss called on England to show they have rediscovered their self-belief and hunger for victory on the eve of the second Test against Pakistan. 

We have had a lot of problems off the pitch, with injuries and stuff like that, it has been harder to go out and believe we are going to win every Test match, Strauss told a news conference at Old Trafford on Wednesday. 

We need to make sure we do things very well for the rest of the summer. If we show that hunger and self-belief that is going to serve us very well in this series and in the winter as well. 

Strauss rejected suggestions by former Australia captain Steve Waugh that England had become too casual, arguing that the team were preparing in exactly the same way they had done previously. 

England will name their team on Thursday morning. Strauss said there were several options to consider, with seamers Sajid Mahmood and Jon Lewis in contention to replace the injured Liam Plunkett. 

England released off spinning allrounder Jamie Dalrymple, indicating they believe the pitch will favour the pacers. 

Pakistan are equally hard-hit as their pace trio suffers from injuries. Shoaib Akhtar has an ankle injury, Mohammed Asif is suffering from an elbow injury, and Rana Naved-ul Hasan has been ruled out of the whole series with a groin problem. 

Batsmen Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik are, however, available for selection once again. 

Seamer Rao Iftikhar Anjum, who summoned as Shahid Afridis replacement, had to return home for a family bereavement. 

When asked about Flintoffs absence, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said: We cant look at individuals. 

We must look at the England team as it comes and get on with the game of cricket. Well just carry on with the game. 

As for Plunketts injury, he added: Whether it reduces Englands capacity to bowl us out remains to be seen. They have other bowlers ? and as Kevin Pietersen has been pointing out, it gives other people the opportunity to show what they can do. 

Pakistan have slow bowling issues of their own, with a decision on whether to recall leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed, currently playing for English County Sussex, yet to be taken. 

Weve looked at the pitch hard; weve seen the records over the last few years on the pitch, and the spinners havent been that successful here, said Woolmer. 

 As for Afridi, he added: He 

 can move the arm ? its not broken.

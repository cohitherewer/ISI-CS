 Dravid: Wish to control our destiny

 - Injured Lara remains doubtful starter 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Ahmedabad: Brian Lara didnt sound despondent when he announced that his participation was in doubt on Thursday. Like a true leader, he exuded the confidence of a man who has learnt to sacrifice individual interests for the sake of team cause. 

Their victory over Australia has no doubt done wonders to their confidence. The recent record against India is also sure to put them in good stead. 

The Indians, though, will be counting on the home advantage. The Motera is set to witness the second full-house of the Champions Trophy and that is bound to inspire the home team. 

Rahul Dravid didnt seem too interested in harping on the past. The past has nothing to do with what can happen tomorrow. The performance on the given day is what counts the most, he explained. 

The match will be played on a wicket adjacent to the one, used on Tuesday, but that shouldnt let the Indians breathe easy. Shaun Pollock and Makhaya Ntini have showed that this wicket has carry and movement in the first 15 overs and Jerome Taylor and Dwayne Bravo might just have another party. 

The excessive dew will be a factor but, as the Proteas showed, such obstacles can always be overcome if there is strong will. Dravid, however, appeared pragmatic. The dew does play its part, especially with teams bowling in the second session. But weve got to look at ways to counter it, with strategy or combination. Im not sure if it (dew) will have a bearing on the final outcome, Team India captain said. 

If the dew turns out to be above normal limits, plans are already afoot to spray APSA 80 on the track, a chemical used in farming. The move, taken by the ICC itself, follows the adhesive used to bind the Brabourne Stadium pitch last week. 

I dont have much to say on this, Lara said of the new initiative. Youve got to see how it behaves. Im focused on ensuring we emerge the better team tomorrow... Other things matter little. 

The way Pollock-Ntini duo flourished has prompted India to rethink their team combination. To play two spinners or an extra batsman in Dinesh Mongia is what the Indians are debating upon. This means the plans to drop Suresh Raina has for the time been shelved. 

Greg Chappell is learnt to have reminded the players of their responsibility and that the time had come for them to get their act together. The Australians hard talk is sure to keep his wards on their toes. 

The form of the top-order batsmen in Jaipur, thus, may prompt the thinktank to play an extra batsman. If Sachin Tendulkar has returned to his own self, it has been 18 months since Virender Sehwag last scored an ODI hundred. 

Dravid needs to remind us of his dependable status and Raina will have to come out of his comfort zone. Dinesh Mongias form in such circumstances will be crucial. 

Though the visitors have kept options open, it is unlikely that the West Indies captain will play Thursday. I felt a bit sore after training last evening. I am sure we still have XI that can do the job. 

If Lara doesnt play, the West Indies will have 12 to choose from since Corey Collymore is yet to return from home. 

And even without Lara, the visitors will be a force to reckon with. Greg Chappell and his team know it the best. The Indian captain provided a clue to this urgency: Im not thinking about defeat or losing the tournament. We have put ourselves in a position where we can control our destiny and wish to keep it that way, he remarked. 

The reality is that whatever Dravid thinks does not always reflect on his team. One hopes Thursday turns out to be a different story.

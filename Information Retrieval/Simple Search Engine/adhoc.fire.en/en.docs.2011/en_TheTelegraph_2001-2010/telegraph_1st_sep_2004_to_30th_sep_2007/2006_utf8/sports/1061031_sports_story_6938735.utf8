New Delhi: Indias golfing fraternity rose in celebration following Jeev Milkha Singhs victory in the Volvo Masters on Sunday. 

The following are some of the reactions (alphabetically): 

Gaurav Ghei: My spirits have gone up since I heard the news yesterday. Jeev has simply taken the game in India far ahead. We hope to follow his course. 

Shiv Kapur: It is the greatest achievement by an Indian sportsperson. Im sure now the media and the Indian people will take note of it. This one achievement by Jeev could change the fate of Indian golf. 

Jeevs win could be equated with Indian cricket teams World Cup win in 1983. The game became more popular overnight. I am sure the same will happen to Indian golf. More and more juniors will now become interested in pursuing the game as a career. 

Jeev is a close friend of mine. Perhaps no one has followed his progress more closely than me. He had his low in the international circuit, but has worked his way through to the top. He has proved that the system works. By winning the Volvo title, Jeev, in one stroke, has made Indian golf far richer than it was. 

Jyoti Randhawa: What Jeev did yesterday was simply sensational. An Asian winning a European tour is something unthinkable. Yet I didnt see too many people around getting excited. This Sunday should go down in the history of Indian sport as a red letter day. It is a pity that only a handful of Indians so far have been able to gauge the magnitude of Jeevs win at Valderrama. 

Jeev has set a landmark. It is now our job to follow his path and do better. He has set the standard. 

We in India have shown that golf could be played professionally. Look at major tours in the world. There is not one tour Asian, Japanese, European or the US where an Indian is not playing at the moment. Jeev has strengthened our hands further.

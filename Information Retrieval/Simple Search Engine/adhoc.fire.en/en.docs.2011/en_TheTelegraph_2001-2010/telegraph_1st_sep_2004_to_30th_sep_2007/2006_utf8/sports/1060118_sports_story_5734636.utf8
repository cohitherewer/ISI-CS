 Australia to still bid 

Melbourne: Australia will proceed with a bid to stage the 2011 World Cup, a Cricket Australia (CA) official said on Tuesday. 

The news comes just two days after Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh announced they were launching a joint bid. Pakistan officials had told reporters they understood Australia would not bid against them. 

But CA general manager Peter Young said Australia was still interested in staging the event. At this stage the ICC is just asking for expressions of interest and we are interested, he said over the phone. The deadline is February and we will be going ahead with that. 

Young said details of Australias bid had yet to be finalised but it was likely to form a partnership with New Zealand. (REUTERS)

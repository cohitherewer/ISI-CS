 Woods caps off brilliant year with 11th title

 - WORLD CHALLENGE GOLF 

 Tiger Woods with his trophy on Sunday 

Thousand Oaks (California): Tiger Woods rated his 2006 season as superior to his brilliant 2000 campaign after clinching his 11th title of the year at the Target World Challenge on Sunday. 

The telling difference for the world No. 1 was that he had to deal with the illness and subsequent death of his beloved father Earl on May 3 after a lengthy battle with cancer. 

If you compare the two years, I think this year would have to be better because of things ve been dealing with off the golf course, Woods said after charging to a four-stroke victory at Sherwood Country Club. 

In 2000 I didnt have to deal with that. I won my first two events of the year, got off to a quick start. But hey, life is full of mysteries and youve got to deal with things as they come. 

Whos to know that if Dad didnt struggle and end up passing that I wouldnt have played that well in the summer? 

In 2000, Woods won 11 individual titles worldwide, including the last three majors of the year. He and David Duval also triumphed at the WGC-World Cup. 

This year, Woods haul includes major victories at the British Open and the PGA Championship. 

He has been virtually unstoppable since the US Open at Winged Foot in June, when he missed the cut for the first time in a major as a professional.

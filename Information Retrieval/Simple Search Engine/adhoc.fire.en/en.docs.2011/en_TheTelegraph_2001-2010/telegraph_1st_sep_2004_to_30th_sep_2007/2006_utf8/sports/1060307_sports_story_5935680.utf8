 More draws Jadeja flak

Varanasi: Selection committee chairman Kiran More drew flak from former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja on Monday for his statement that the doors are shut for former captain Sourav Gangulys return to the national squad. 

Before making his stand public that the former skipper did not fit in the schemes of things, more should have shown respect for Souravs contributions as a player and a captain during a distinguished career spanning over a decade, Jadeja said. 

He felt only the performance and fitness of any player should be the basis of his selection to the national team. 

In any case, the selection of a player should entirely depend on his performance and fitness, notwithstanding his age or other extraneous considerations, the Rajasthan captain said. 

Jadeja lauded BCCIs proposed move to give a pension of Rs 25,000 to each of the retired cricketers and said such schemes would come in handy to the retired and aged cricketers to meet their needs.

Chittagong: Leg-spinners Shane Warne and Stuart MacGill helped Australia crush Bangladesh by an innings and 80 runs in the second and final Test on Thursday. 

With this win the world champions reasserted their dominance after a tight three-wicket in the opening Test. 

 Warne finished with five wickets for 113 runs while MacGill scalped four wickets for 95 runs to trigger a familiar Bangladesh collapse after the home side resumed at 195 for four, chasing 384 to make Australia bat again. 

Bangladesh were bowled out for 304, with Warne claiming his 36th haul of five or more wickets in 140 Tests. 

The 36-year-old, who took three wickets on Wednesday, bagged the important scalp of Shahriar Nafees (79) before MacGill joined him in wrapping off the Bangladesh tail. 

Warne, who struggled in the first match with a sore shoulder, finished with eight wickets in the match after bagging three in the first innings. 

The only time the worlds most successful Test bowler was in trouble was when left-handed all-rounder Mohammed Rafique (65) went after him to clobber some huge boundaries. 

Rafique took three sixes off Warne and as many off MacGill during his cameo 53-ball knock. But his heroics came too late as Bangladesh were already nine down when he decided to open his shoulders. 

However, Rafique had the satisfaction of setting a Bangladeshi record last-wicket stand of 69 with Shahadat Hossain, which bettered the previous mark of 46 runs achieved on three occasions. 

I thought they played well in the series but we were nowhere near our best, Australian skipper Ricky Ponting said after the match. They lost this match on the first day when they scored only 197. 

Ponting felt the teams did not have enough time to recover during the series. 

Test cricket is very demanding nowadays and injuries are always a worry. In trying conditions, a two-day break between Tests like it was here is not enough, he said. 

Any hopes Bangladesh had of putting up a fight were shattered early in the day when first-Test centurion Nafees fell to Warne. 

The left-hander had added just four runs to his overnight 75 when he shaped for a drive but inside-edged the ball to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist. His innings lasted 180 balls in which he hit nine boundaries. 

MacGill then struck with his very first delivery of the day. Aftab Ahmed (18) also inside-edged a ball to the wicketkeeper in trying to withdraw his bat from the line of the delivery.

 Cairns quits for good

Wellington: New Zealands Chris Cairns announced his retirement from all international cricket on Monday, putting an end to a stellar career spanning 15 years as one of his countrys finest allrounders. 

Cairns, who notched a world record 87 Test-match sixes and is one of very few batsmen to average more than one six per Test, said his last match will be a Twenty20 encounter against the West Indies in Auckland next month. 

I feel that the time is right for me to retire from international cricket, said Cairns, the Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 2000. 

I still enjoy playing for the Black Caps and want to leave at a time when that enjoyment has not diminished, and when I feel that I am still performing at the top level and contributing to the success of the team.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Hewitt looks to be the only obstacle in Federers 

path

In the searing heat of Melbourne, the Australian Open, 

the first Grand Slam of 2006 gets underway on Monday. Victory for Roger Federer, 

with six Grand Slams under his belt, would be another step forward in becoming 

the greatest of all time. The absence of Rafael Nadal, Marat Safin and Andre Agassi 

due to injury seems to have crippled the tournament. It is impossible to fill 

the void left by the charismatic trio of Grand Slam winners.

Going through the draw, it is difficult to find a 

serious challenge to Federers domination, provided he stays injury free. 

Federers expected semi-final clash with Hewitt may be his toughest assignment. 

In the past, Hewitts terrier like tenacity, fist-pumping and high decibel 

screams of Come on have had no impact on the calm Federer. Hewitt 

just does not have the weight of shot to penetrate the Swiss armour.

In the lower half, second seed Andy Roddick has a 

tough quarter. According to the seeding, Roddick should play Ivan Ljubicic, seeded 

seventh, for a place in the semi-finals. Ljubicic is 6 feet 4 inches tall, very 

strong and athletic. He moves well and can (as we saw in Chennai) thump a 230 

kmph service ace when required. With powerful groundshots and a deadly one-handed 

backhand and a good net attack, he is a formidable foe. Twice he has pushed Federer 

to a final set tie-break in tournament finals. Ljubicics victory in the 

recent ATP tournament in Chennai where he played the semi-finals at noon and the 

final at night, shows that he is very fit and in fine fettle.

One cannot ignore the resolute and consistent David 

Nalbandian of Argentina who is seeded No. 4 and who should find a place in the 

semi-finals. Roddick has not fulfilled the great promise he has shown earlier. 

His bruising aggressive game, spearheaded by the fastest serve in the world, is 

one-dimensional. 

When Roddick is not at his best, he does not have 

a sound defence to fall back on. Summing up, it seems that the mens semi-finalists 

would be Federer vs Hewitt in the top half and Nalbandian vs Roddick/Ljubicic 

in the lower half.

The womens singles, surprisingly, features all 

the top ten players for the second time in 30 years. Every one of them is coming 

back from injuries and one really wonders if this patched-up lot can take the 

field to Olympian heights. The results will be dictated by the physical condition 

of the players. Davenport is in very good form and should win if she can last 

out the tough fortnight.

For Sania, a lucky wild card entrant in 2005 to No. 

32 seed in 2006 in a Grand Slam is a giant leap. The exhilarating climb we all 

enjoyed on Sanias coattails seems to have levelled out and Sania is now 

cruising comfortably at the above 30 levels of womens rankings.

Sanias seeding at No. 32 is a great boon for 

her as she will not meet any of the top 31 players till the third round. She is 

pitted against a qualifier, 16-year-old Victoria Azarenka of Belarus in the first 

round. But, this is nothing to rejoice about. The qualifying rank consists of 

a hungry pack of tough, young hopefuls and some highly-ranked players coming back 

after injury. Also, winning three qualifying matches sharpens their game and gives 

them confidence.

So, Sania will have to be alert and at her very best 

from the very first round. Her second round opponent will be the winner of the 

Michaela Krajicek-Kristina Brandi encounter. Amelie Mauresmo of France, seeded 

No. 3 awaits Sania in the third round. Apart from a very recent first-round loss, 

Mauresmo has been in very good form. 

If Sanias giant-killing spree continues in 2006 

and she happens to beat Mauresmo, she then plays Nicole Valdisova for a place 

in the quarter finals. At this stage one should not look further and fall back 

on that hackneyed clich? repeated by all players ad nausem ? I am taking 

one match at a time ? when asked about their prospects in the tournament.

I watched Sania on the TV playing against Valdisova 

at Hong Kong and am happy to say that she is in good shape and on present form 

can give any of the higher-ranked players a run for their money. But it would 

be a flight of fancy to consider her to be a contender for a Grand Slam singles 

title in 2006.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF buckles under Fransa pressure

 - Tie vs Air India to be replayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: The All India 

 Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday cowed down before 

 Fransa Pax, acceding to the Goan clubs demand of having 

 the Fransa-Air India match replayed in the National League.

 In a letter written to the Fransa 

 secretary, the AIFF has not only allowed the club to play 

 in the NFL, but has also made it clear that Fransa 

 will resume their campaign from the match against Air India.

 It may be recalled that Fransa, 

 after losing to Mahindra United in the NFL on January 30, 

 did not turn up for their match against Air India, demanding 

 a replay of the Mahindra outing.

 Air India duly came to the ground 

 along with the supervising officials and the match commissioner. 

 Logically, the Mumbai team was entitled to receive a walkover.

 Since then, Fransa chairman Micky 

 Pacheco has been openly criticising the AIFF and its president 

 Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. He even threatened to withdraw 

 his team in case the federation did not order a replay of 

 the Fransa-Air India match.

 Air India coach Bimal Ghosh said 

 he was shocked and disappointed with the AIFF 

 decision.

 Speaking to The Telegraph 

 from Mumbai, Ghosh said: I am not sure under which 

 rule the AIFF has awarded a replay. I will talk to my bosses 

 and most probably will protest against the decision.

 While acceding to Fransas 

 main demand, the AIFF has made an effort to put up a brave 

 front in the second part of the letter. It has declared 

 Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco a persona non-grata.

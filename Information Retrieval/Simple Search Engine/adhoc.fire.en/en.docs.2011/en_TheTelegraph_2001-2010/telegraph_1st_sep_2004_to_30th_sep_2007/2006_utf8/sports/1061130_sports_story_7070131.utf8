The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We mustnt 

 repeat our World Cup mistakes

 Stickwork 

 Gurbux Singh

 Shivendra Singh can be 

 a big force up-front.

 Fear 

 is a habit. So is self-pity, defeat, despair and resignation. 

 Following the World Cup debacle, the Indian hockey team 

 is bracing up for another moment of truth. Do we have good 

 enough players to seize the opportunity? Will we be able 

 to make amends for the wrongs we committed in Germany and 

 shine in Doha? Will the seeds of a new revolution be sown 

 in Doha? 

 These questions and doubts often 

 revolving around based on a plethora of negative habits 

 are bound to cloud the mind ahead of our Asian Games campaign, 

 because there has been very little to cheer about for Indian 

 hockey in recent times. Its time to change this trend. 

 Following two trial matches in 

 Rourkela and Delhi, weve finally selected the 16-member 

 squad. A lot of emphasis was given on fitness level and, 

 sad to say, old warhorses like captain Dilip Tirkey, Ignace 

 Tirkey, Rajpal Singh and Viren Rasquinha were found wanting 

 on this count. Viren couldnt make it to the final 

 squad and his place has gone to the young Gurbaj Singh. 

 In Doha, we are going to play 

 back-to-back games against Bangladesh and China. We discussed 

 this issue at length in the selection meeting, because under 

 similar situations in the past, India have played horribly 

 in the second game, even against weak opponents.

 South Korea remain our No. 1 rival 

 in the Asian Games and if we can top the group, we can expect 

 easier opponents in the semi-final stage. There is also 

 an added incentive for Dilip amp; Co: A place in the final 

 means automatic qualification for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

 Any slip-up in Doha will lead 

 us to the Olympic qualifiers, inviting more disappointment 

 and criticism. 

 Our main weakness is the midfield. 

 If the likes of Ignace, Vinay and Gurbaj are able to hold 

 up their zone, we can hope to advance convincingly. Our 

 forwardline is pretty penetrative, especially with Shivendra 

 Singh and Tushar Khandekar showing that they have it in 

 them to take on the best of defences. Adam Sinclair is another 

 prospect and I hope coach Baskaran does try him out.

 The real concern is the tendency 

 to lose focus in the middle. Throughout the World Cup, we 

 suffered because of our old malady of conceding soft penalty 

 corners. Kamalpreet Singh was the main culprit then. 

 He wont be in Doha, but 

 the defenders need to be on their toes and ensure that all 

 the good work up front doesnt go waste because of 

 silly mistakes in the backline. 

 We failed to earn enough penalty 

 corners as well. Since the rules have changed, there is 

 no harm in hitting the ball at the opponents legs 

 inside the D to earn penalty corners. Nothing 

 is unfair in a battle and the forwards must explore all 

 options to win. 

 Sandeep Singh could have come 

 in handy, but his fitness was suspect.

 Indian crickets new chief 

 selector Dilip Vengsarkar has recently rued lack of talent 

 at domestic levels. Its a similar case in Indian hockey 

 as well. We kept a tab on the Nationals in Jalandhar, but 

 truth to tell, no exceptional talents caught our eyes.

 There may be a shake-up in the 

 teams composition post-Doha, but now its back 

 to a bunch of old-timers, who will carry the nations 

 expectations at the Asian Games. Those negative habits can 

 be overcome with the resolve: I can and I will! 

 Isnt it true that who dares, 

 wins?

 Randhawa, Ganapathy, Kahlon share lead

Noida: Jyoti Randhawa, Harmeet Kahlon and Rahul Ganapathy carded identical six-under-par 66 to be in joint lead on the opening day of the Bilt Open, the first event of the inaugural PGTI tour, here on Thursday. 

Randhawa carded a bogey-free 66 with birdies on fifth, seventh, ninth, 11th, 13th and 16th holes to set the Jaypee Greens Course on fire. 

While Randhawa holed out for birdies from within six feet on the fifth, 13th and 16th, he holed a ten-footer on the ninth and a 20 foot putt on the 11th for birdie. However, his best shot of the day was an eight-iron that he hit to a foot and a half on the par-three seventh hole. 

Kahlon, who teed off from the tenth, made eight birdies and two bogies en route to a 66. Teeing off from the 10th, Ganapathy birdied the 12th, 14th, 15th and 18th holes to make the turn at four-under-par. 

Gurbaaz Mann, C. Muniyappa and amateur Gagan Verma tied for fourth place, a stroke behind, at five-under-par, 67. Meanwhile, Shiv Kapur and Guarav Ghei both carded a three-over-par 75.

 Nalbandian to face Federer

Madrid: World No. 1 Roger Federer continued his progress towards a 10th title of the year with a clinical 6-3, 7-6 win over unseeded American Robby Ginepri in the quarter finals of the Madrid Masters on Friday. 

The 25-year-old, who has never won the Madrid title, will face world No. 4 David Nalbandian in the semis after the Argentine clinched a 6-4, 6-7, 7-6 victory over Marat Safin. 

Although Ginepri played some high-quality tennis, he was unable to match Federer on the crucial points and could not find a chink in the Swiss armour. The win was Federers 80th of the year and extended his winning streak to 17 matches. (Reuters)

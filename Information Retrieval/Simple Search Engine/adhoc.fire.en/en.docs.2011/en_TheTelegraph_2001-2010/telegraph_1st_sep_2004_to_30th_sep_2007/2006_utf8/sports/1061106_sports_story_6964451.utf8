 A tragedy: Simpson

Sydney: Australians have responded with a mixture of disbelief and anger to the ICCs decision to ban Darrell Hair from umpiring international matches, labelling it tragic and disgusting. 

Its disgusting, former Australian captain Neil Harvey said. Hes probably the best around but it shows you the influence of the Asian nations. 

Another former Australia Test captain, Bob Simpson, said: Its just a tragedy, Simpson said. He has shown great courage in making decisions which other umpires are not brave enough to make. 

Australian cricket officials pledged their ongoing support for Hair, saying he was welcome to continue his career in the domestic first-class competition. (Reuters)

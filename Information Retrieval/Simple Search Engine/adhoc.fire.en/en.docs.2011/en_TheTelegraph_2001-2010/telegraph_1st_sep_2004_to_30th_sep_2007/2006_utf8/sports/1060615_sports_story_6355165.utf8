The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A big day for Indian golf, says Jeev

 - US Open begins today

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

New York: Ace Indian golfers Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa are hoping their historic double-act will capture the imagination of the golfing world at the US Open starting here on Thursday. 

Jeev, the Asian Tours Order of Merit leader, and 2002 Asian No. 1 Randhawa carry the regions flag at Winged Foot Golf Club where they will face the likes of title-holder Michael Campbell and world No. 1 Tiger Woods. 

This is the first time two Indians are featuring together at the US Open, with Jeev making his second appearance and Randhawa his debut. They earned their berths in the years second major through qualifying in England earlier this month. 

It should be a big day for Indian golf, said Jeev. Whenever you qualify for a major, you want to play well for personal reasons. But coming from an Asian background, both of us being here is fantastic for the Asian tour. The more Asians we have in big tournaments and majors, the more recognition well get. 

Jeev, who qualified and played in all four rounds in the 2002 US Open in Bethpage, New York, is riding on a crest of new-found confidence. Since April, he has notched one victory, his first since 1999, and posted three other top-10 finishes. 

Im playing well, said Jeev. Ive got a lot of confidence after winning the Volvo China Open (in April). I now trust my game under pressure and I believe in myself. Thats taken me ahead. Im looking forward to this week. There is self-belief. Ive worked quite hard although there could be a lot more improvements. 

Jeev will have a small band of supporters cheering him on this week. His parents have flown to New York while his two sisters live here. I am fortunate to play in New York all the time. Im excited about it. I always like to play on tough courses and it doesnt get any tougher than this. 

 I will try to take it like 

 a normal week. Im pretty excited with the large crowds 

 as its a different atmosphere, said Jeev. He 

 will tee off in the first round at 12.30 pm (local time) 

 on Thursday and 7 am for Fridays second round.

Colombo: Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh came good with the bat but India had to rely on the lower order to win their warm-up match against Sri Lanka A here on Saturday. 

Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh Powar shared an unbeaten 54-run partnership for the eighth wicket to help India avoid an embarrassing defeat ahead of the Unitech Cup tri-series which starts on Monday. 

After restricting their opponents to 202 for nine in 50 overs, the Indians were looking down the barrel at 153 for seven before the Mumbai pair rescued and guided them home in 44.3 overs. 

Agarkar and Powar batted for nearly an hour with the former hitting a six and a four in his unbeaten 32. Powar was 13 not out. 

Dravid opened with Sachin Tendulkar, while Virender Sehwag came in at No. 4, after Irfan Pathan. 

Sachin, playing his first match for Team India after nearly five months, got a start before perishing to Nuwan Zoysa. The right-hander hit three fours in his 19 which came off 27. 

It must be worrying for Dravid that the team did not handle the middle overs well, one area he had mentioned as key to success. 

Between them, Virender Sehwag (1), Mohammed Kaif (0) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (9) utilised only 18 balls. 

 But the Indians took heart from the form displayed by the skipper and Yuvraj. 

 Dravid was fluent during his 70-ball 47 that contained five fours, while Yuvraj top-scored with 61 aided by eight fours. The bowling performance, too, was pleasing. 

 Pathan, who was dropped from the XI during the Test series in the Caribbean, returned tidy figures of one for 33 in 10 overs. 

But it was the slow bowlers who controlled the match. Sehwag was wrecker-in-chief with three for 16. Harbhajan Singh and Powar went wicketless, but did the job of containment well. 

Opener Upul Tharanga stood out with a fine 88. 

 Dravid said nothing should be read into the changes in the batting line-up. 

We are trying a few things. It was good to see the batsmen getting starts and it was also important that the bowlers came good, said the skipper at the official captains press conference, which was scheduled while the Indian innings was still on. 

BRIEF SCORES 

Sri Lanka A 202/9 in 50 ovs (Upul Tharanga 88; V. Sehwag 3/16). India 203/7 in 44.3 ovs (Y. Singh 61, R. Dravid 47; N. Zoysa 2/37, Suraj Mohammed 2/50). India won by 3 wkts.

 Giles feels the Monty heat

London: Veteran England left-arm spinner Ashley Giles is feeling insecure after sparkling performances from Monty Panesar in the Test series against Pakistan. 

Giles, out of action due to a hip injury, said it wont be easy to come back into the team even after he gained fitness. 

Monty performed superbly and hes now the man in possession. I have to get my place back. Thats the danger when you get injured, Giles told a TV channel. (PTI)

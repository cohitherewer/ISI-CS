Madrid: Second-placed Osasuna dropped their first home points of the season and handed leaders Barcelona the symbolic title of winter champions when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Racing Santander on Sunday. 

The result left Barcelona four points clear at the top of the Primera Liga with one match to go before the halfway mark in the season. Arch-rivals Real Madrid are 13 points adrift of the leaders back in sixth place after a 0-0 draw at Villarreal. 

Osasuna took the lead when French midfielder Ludovic Delporte scored with a marvellous curling free kick on the half hour but Santander striker Antonito poached an equaliser on the stroke of halftime to end the Navarrans perfect home record. 

Champions Barcelona had continued their imperious progress with a 2-1 victory over city rivals Espanyol on Saturday to chalk up their 15th straight win in all competitions. 

Frank Rijkaards side have 43 points from 18 games, while Osasuna follow on 39, six ahead of Valencia who were held to a 0-0 draw at Atletico Madrid in Sundays late match. 

Deportivo Coruna are in fourth a further point behind following their 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, one clear of Villarreal and two ahead of Real Madrid. 

Real, missing the suspended David Beckham but with Jonathan Woodgate back from injury for his first start in two months, enjoyed the better of the opening exchanges at El Madrigal. 

Villarreal soon got into their stride and played the more fluent football with Juan Roman Riquelme leading the way. 

The Argentine international almost put his side ahead when he shaved the post with a curling shot after a marvellous piece of interplay with fellow countryman Juan Pablo Sorin and striker Diego Forlan went close with a well struck volley soon after. 

Zinedine Zidane replied for Real with a rasping drive, but Villarreal keeper Sebastian Viera made a superb fingertip save to turn the Frenchmans shot around the post. 

Real suffered a major blow when leading striker Ronaldo went off injured with what looked to be a recurrence of a recent calf strain 12 minutes before halftime. 

With Italian striker Antonio Cassano remaining in Madrid to regain his fitness after signing from AS Roma, coach Ramon Lopez Caro decided to give his other new signing Cicinho his debut. 

Villarreal continued to hold the upper hand in the second half and Forlan spurned a great chance to give them the lead when he scooped the ball over the bar after Jose Mari had threaded a neat pass through Woodgates legs. 

Woodgate, who had showed occasional glimpses of the form that caused Real to sign him at the start of last season, was fortunate to stay on the pitch when he brought down Jose Mari as the striker raced clear in the 73rd minute but he escaped with a booking. 

Both defences remained firm for the remainder of the game and the two sides had to settle for a draw. 

At the other end of the table, basement side Alaves were left three points adrift of fellow strugglers Bilbao after losing 2-0 at home to Real Zaragoza, the goals coming courtesy of in-form strike partners Diego Milito and Ewerthon. 

Meanwhile, three goals in nine first half minutes helped AC Milan come from behind to beat Parma 4-3 and climb to second in Serie A behind Juventus on Sunday, adds a report from Rome. 

The win gave Milan 40 points from 18 matches, one point ahead of city rivals Inter who could only manage a goalless draw with Siena. Champions Juventus still comfortably lead the division on 49 points after a 2-1 defeat of Palermo on Saturday. 

In the early stages at the San Siro, the visitors were pressed back into their own half and Milan strikers Andriy Shevchenko and Alberto Gilardino both narrowly missed the target. 

It was Parma, however, who took the lead in the 24th minute courtesy of a howler by Milan keeper Dida, who fumbled a corner leaving Paolo Cannavaro the easiest of tap-ins. 

Milan hit back with three goals in nine minutes, starting in the 27th minute when Parma defender Giuseppe Cardone deflected Kakas low cross past his own keeper. 

Gilardino then put Milan ahead. The 23-year-old Italy international, who moved to Milan from Parma during the close season, headed a Shevchenko cross past keeper Matteo Guardalben. 

Kaka grabbed their third, taking advantage of a poor clearance to beat Guardalben from the edge of the area. 

Parma showed flashes of class and Marco Marchionni pulled a goal back in the 70th minute but a poachers goal by Shevchenko restored Milans two-goal cushion. 

FA Cup 

Meanwhile, Manchester United were held to a humiliating goalless draw by minor league Burton Albion in the FA Cup third round on Sunday as Alex Fergusons policy of playing a weakened team backfired for the second year running (as reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

United, Cup winners on a record 11 occasions and runners-up last season, fielded only a handful of first team regulars and looked distinctly ordinary on a sandy, bumpy pitch against a spirited Conference side of part-timers.

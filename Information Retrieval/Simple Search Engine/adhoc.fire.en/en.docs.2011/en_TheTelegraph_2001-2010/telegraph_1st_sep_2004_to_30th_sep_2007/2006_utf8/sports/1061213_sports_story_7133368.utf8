 For the book

 Reggina had their 15-point penalty for their role in Italys match-fixing scandal reduced to 11 on Tuesday by an independent arbitration board. The Serie A team was docked the points in August by a soccer federation sports court for allegedly trying to have friendly referees assigned to its games. The reduction would lift the club one place off the bottom of the standings to 19th.

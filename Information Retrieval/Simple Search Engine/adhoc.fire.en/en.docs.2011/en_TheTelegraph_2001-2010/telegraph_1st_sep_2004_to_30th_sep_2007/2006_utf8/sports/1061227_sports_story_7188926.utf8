 Pretty amazing day: Warne

Melbourne: Shane Warne never imagined his farewell to be so successful after he captured five wickets and became the first player to claim 700 Test scalps on the opening day of the fourth Ashes Test against England on Tuesday. 

Warne clean-bowled Andrew Strauss in his fourth over to reach 700 Test wickets, then added the scalps of Kevin Pietersen, Chris Read, Steve Harmison and Monty Panesar to finish with five for 39. 

Whoever writes my scripts is doing an unbelievable job, he told a news conference. 

I cant stop shaking my head just believing it actually happened... it was a pretty amazing day. 

Warnes five-wicket haul was his 37th in Tests and while it was well short of his career-best figures of eight for 71, the leg spinner said it was still an unforgettable day. 

Theres some special things that happen in your life and some special days in your life and this is definitely one of them, he said 

Theres the birth of your children, getting married, playing your first Test, theyre all pretty special. 

But from an individual point of view thats got to be one of the best days Ive ever had. 

Warne celebrated his 700th wicket by raising the ball aloft and almost set off on a lap of honour after collecting his fifth of the day to end the innings when he suddenly had a change of heart. I got tired so I stopped, he said. 

But seriously, I thought all the bowlers did really well today. I think they all deserve a lot of credit for bowling extremely well, rather than England capitulating. (Reuters)

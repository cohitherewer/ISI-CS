The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhowmick ready for the new challenge

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: As far as East Bengal are concerned, he is the one who engineered the exodus from the red-and-gold ranks to Mohammedan Sporting. But Subhas Bhowmick couldnt care less about what is being said about him. He is determined to ensure that Mohammedan Sporting perform well in the ensuing season at any cost. 

The team having survived relegation in the NFL by crushing Salgaocar 4-1 in the final match, its going to be a new and different challenge for the Mohammedan Sporting coach. It is too early to predict how things would shape up in the future, but I am hopeful the team I am preparing would do something worthwhile in the coming season, Bhowmick told The Telegraph on Tuesday. 

Bhowmick is thankful that the club management has accepted all his demands. At the end of the season, I was handed over a three-year contract but I told them I will only stay if I get a good team. I prepared an initial list of 42 players and then we zeroed in on 25, said Bhowmick. 

The coach dismissed suggestions that he had instigated players to leave East Bengal. This is a baseless allegation. If we offer the players more money, why wont they play for us, Bhowmick argued. 

The Mohammedan Sporting coach is confident that he will get a full term. 

After I took over as coach, we lost four matches on the trot. It was a crucial time for my team but none of the officials said anything to me, Bhowmick observed. 

Working on the players fitness is priority No. 1 for Bhowmick. There are some good players who spent the previous season on the reserves bench. I have to work on their fitness, Bhowmick signed off. Mohammedan Sportings latest recruits will be goalie Prasanto Dora and forward Surojit Roy who are expected to sign on Wednesday.

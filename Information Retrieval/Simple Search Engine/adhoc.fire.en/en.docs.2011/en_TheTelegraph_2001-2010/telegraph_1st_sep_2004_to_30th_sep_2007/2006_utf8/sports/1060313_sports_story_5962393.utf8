 Fake journalist thrown out

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: A 21-year-old of Indian origin, with a British passport, and posing to be a freelancer was thrown out of the media enclosure at the PCA Stadium in Mohali for allegedly placing bets on an online portal on Sunday morning. 

The London-based man, with a valid accreditation issued by the PCA, had been covering the second Test for the past three days. His movements aroused suspicion in the minds of other journalists who requested the PCA to look into the matter. 

When questioned by the PCA officials Sunday he denied being associated with any unofficial dealings and claimed to be writing for a web paper in Australia. The PCA, however, decided to evict him for not indulging in media-related work inside the press box. 

Word soon spread around and he was accosted by television cameras near the gates. He found the attention too tough to handle and fled in an autorickshaw. It was later learnt that he was basically a punter who placed his bets on betfair.com. 

The mystery, however, revolved around how he managed to get an accreditation. Moreover, he worked unnoticed by the authorities for three days. It showed the PCA in poor light, and unfortunately, they failed to come up with a suitable reply. 

All British journalists covering this series have been issued central accreditation by the BCCI. The Board refused this man saying that the quota for foreign journalists had already been exceeded and he could approach the local organisers. 

G. S. Walia, PCA treasurer and the man in charge of media, admitted it had been a mistake.

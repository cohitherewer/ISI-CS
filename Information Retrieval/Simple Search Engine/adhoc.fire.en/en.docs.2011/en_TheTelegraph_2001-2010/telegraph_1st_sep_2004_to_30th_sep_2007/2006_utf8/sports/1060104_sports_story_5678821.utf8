 Latif: No need for India to experiment 

 Latif 

Jalandhar: Indias frequent shuffling of the batting order may have bamboozled the Sri Lankans but former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif says such experiments may backfire and have a destabilising effect on the team. 

Latif finds it hard to see any logic behind Indias penchant for changing the batting order, saying there was no need to do that since the Indians had a strong batting line-up. 

India has such a strong batting line-up that there is no need to indulge in such experiments. In fact, it is Pakistan who need such experiments to find a suitable middle order, Latif said in an interview. 

Sometimes too much experiments can shatter the confidence of the batsmen and can lead to unnecessary controversies. Even an accomplished batsman may find it difficult to adjust in a new batting position, the former wicketkeeper said. 

Commenting on the upcoming India-Pakistan series, Latif said Pakistan would largely depend on Shoaib Akhtar and Danish Kaneria to deliver the goods in the bowling department. 

As far as bowling is concerned, Shoaib and Kaneria should again deliver the results as they did in the series against England. 

Latif said Shoaibs reported statement that the Indian batsmen were scared of his bowling should be seen as a pressure tactic but felt that top players should refrain from making such comments. 

Players of both sides should avoid making such statements which can lead to controversy. Players should concentrate only on the game. 

The former player also said recent selection controversies involving Sourav Ganguly could affect Indias performance. 

The kind of treatment that has been meted to Sourav has not only shattered his confidence but of other team members as well. It has also instilled a sense of insecurity among players which can affect their performance.

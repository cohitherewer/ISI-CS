 India beat Pak 

Jaipur: Defending Champions India started their Womens Asia Cup campaign on a winning note by thrashing Pakistan by 80 runs at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium on Wednesday. 

Rumeli Dhar (53) struck a timely half-century to help India post 239/9 in their allotted 50 overs before debutant Trish Kamini claimed three wickets to restrict Pakistan to 159/6. 

Indian skipper Mithali Rajs decision to bat nearly backfired when medium pacer Quanila Jalil (five for 62) made vital inroads in the top order. But Dhar (53) and Hemalata Kala (45) helped bail out the hosts after they were tottering at 51 for four in 10 overs. 

Amita Sharma also struck an unbeaten 45 lower down the order to accelerate the score in the slog overs. 

India lost quick wickets with Jalil and Asmavia Iqbal (two for 47) rocking them.

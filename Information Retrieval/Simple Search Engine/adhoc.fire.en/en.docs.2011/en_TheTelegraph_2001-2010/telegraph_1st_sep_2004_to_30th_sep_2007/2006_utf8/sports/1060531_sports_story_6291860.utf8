 Myskina too good for Sania

Paris: Sania Mirzas singles campaign at the French Open came to an early end at the Roland Garros here on Tuesday. 

Russian 10th seed Anastasia Myskina, the 2004 champion and world No. 12, was too good for the 19-year old Indian and won the first-round encounter 6-4, 6-1 at the Suzanne Lenglen Court. 

Sania matched her 24-year old opponent shot for shot initially, breaking her twice in the first set, but could not hold on to the advantage either time. 

The Hyderabad girl had two chances for a third service break, but Myskina used her skill and experience to dodge those tight situations. 

Myskina, the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam, was on a roll in the second set. 

After Sania held serve in the second game, Myskina won five games in a row to cruise into the second round.

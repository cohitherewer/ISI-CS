 Blue, Red joint winners

 - Rain spoils Sehwag blitz 

 - VRV best 

 Virender Sehwag in action on Wednesday 

Chennai: India Blue and India Red were declared joint winners of the Challenger Trophy after rain played spoilsport in the summit clash of the meet here on Wednesday evening. 

India Blue were 210 for four in 31.2 overs with Virender Sehwag going strong on 90, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni on 6 when play was stopped at 5.12 pm after a downpour. 

Sehwag blasted 14 boundaries and a six in his knock. 

It rained heavily for an hour and then stopped. The umpires made one inspection and preferred to have another one before deciding on the fate of the match. 

When it rained heavily for the second time after 15 minutes, the umpires did not conduct any inspection before calling off the match at 7.45 pm. 

Vikram Rajvir Singh was declared Player of the Series. Each team got Rs 3.75 lakh as prize money. 

Rahul Dravid included Sehwag in the XI dispelling the rumour that he was not fit after an ankle injury he had sustained on Sunday. Sehwag opened the innings with Sachin Tendulkar. 

India Red captain Venugopal Rao opted for S. Badrinath for Delhis Gautam Gambhir. 

Tendulkar, who had scored 61 and 139 in the earlier two matches, could not open his account as Zaheer Khan dismissed him in the last ball of the first over of the innings, caught brilliantly by Robin Uthappa at covers. 

Sehwag then added 49 runs for the second wicket with Irfan Pathan (22) before the latter was dismissed off Zaheers bowling. 

Sehwag along with Dravid, who survived two chances, systematically destroyed the attack. The pair traded stroke for stroke and boundary for boundary, at times, in a superb display of one-day batting. 

Dravid was dropped before he could open the account, by the rival captain off the very first ball from Zaheer and in the very next over, T.P. Singh from short third man missed the stumps narrowly. Sehwag too had a reprieve when on 39 as Singh fielding at point allowed the ball to pop out of his hands off Sreesanths bowling. 

Dravid was run out when he took off for a run after Sehwag drove to mid-off but Uthappa threw the ball to keeper Dinesh Karthik, who cleared the bails before he could get to the crease.

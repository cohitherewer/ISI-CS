 Gudjohnsen stars in Barcelonas dramatic win 

Madrid: Champions Barcelona fought back from a goal down to earn a thrilling 3-2 win at Celta Vigo in their opening Primera Liga match of the season on Monday thanks to a late goal by substitute Eidur Gudjohnsen. 

The Catalans, bidding for a third consecutive league title, looked to be suffering from the after-effects of Fridays 0-3 mauling at the hands of Sevilla in the European Super Cup as they fell behind to a Fernando Baiano goal just before half-time. 

But they fought back in a pulsating second half and quick-fire goals from Samuel Eto and Lionel Messi rounded off by Gudjohnsens last-gasp strike earned Frank Rijkaards side a dramatic win. 

Barcelonas arch-rivals Real Madrid were held 0-0 at home to Villarreal on Sunday while Valencia, one of the other favourites for the title, won 2-1 against visiting Real Betis on Saturday. 

Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes blocked a low shot from Nene after he had cut inside centre back Rafael Marquez and Baiano was on hand to stab the ball into the net. 

The goal brought Barcelona out of their shell and they looked far more lively at the start of the second half. 

Last seasons leading scorer Eto put the visitors back on level terms when he drilled in low past Pinto after beating the offside trap with a slick one-two with the live-wire Messi. 

Four minutes later Messi put the visitors in front when he turned away from his marker and fired home after Andres Iniesta surged through the midfield and burst past four Celta players. 

But the celebrations were short-lived as Celta midfielder Gustavo Lopez snapped the ball home after the Barcelona back four had failed to deal with a free kick. 

Gudjohnsen controlled a lofted pass from Deco with his chest and volleyed home at the second attempt after his first effort had spun off the foot of a Celta defender. (Reuters)

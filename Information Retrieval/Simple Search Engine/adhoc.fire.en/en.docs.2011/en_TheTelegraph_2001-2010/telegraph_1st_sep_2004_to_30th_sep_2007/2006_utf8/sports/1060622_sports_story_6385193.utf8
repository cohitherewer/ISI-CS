 Dravid: Sehwag adds extra string to our bow

 Rahul Dravid in Basseterre on Tuesday 

Basseterre: Team India captain Rahul Dravid has rebutted criticism about leaving out Harbhajan Singh for the first two Tests, saying Virender Sehwag as part-time bowler has performed the fifth bowlers role efficiently. 

Harbhajan is a good bowler, so when he is fit, he always comes into consideration. But then four bowlers did the job for us in the last game, Dravid said on Tuesday. 

In an ideal scenario, we would have liked to have five bowlers but Veeru has done the job for us. He adds extra string to the bow for us. 

Dravid, however, was too worried about the inexperience of his bowlers. 

These boys dont have much experience but they have done a good job, he said. Munaf (Patel) has been brilliant in the series. Sreesanth bowled particularly well in the second innings (of the first Test). VRV Singh has shown a lot of promise and good ability. 

If we get big scores and get them out cheaply in the first innings, and if we can keep up the good work in the second, we can give good account of ourselves. 

Dravid also didnt read too much into the presence of grass on the strip in the middle. 

I am not the one who worries too much about grass. I rather look at the moisture content in the wicket, whether it can break up or if it slows up. 

He felt the break after the second Test did a world of good to the players who were carrying niggles and injury. 

Holiday has ensured that there is a fit squad to choose from. The break has been a help in that sense.

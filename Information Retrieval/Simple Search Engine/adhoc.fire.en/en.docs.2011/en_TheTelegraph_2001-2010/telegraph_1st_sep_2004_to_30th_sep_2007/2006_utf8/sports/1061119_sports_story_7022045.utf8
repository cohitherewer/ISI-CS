 India out to halt slide

 - ICC ODI RANKINGS 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: India will be out to halt their slide down the LG ICC ODI Championship table when they starts their five-match ODI series against South Africa in Johannesburg on Sunday. 

Rahul Dravids line-up was one of the in-form sides in ODIs in the first half of 2006 and at the end of April lay third in the table, three rating points behind the Proteas. 

But since then India have won just three of its last 13 outings, results that have seen it slip to fifth spot, 21 rating points adrift of leaders Australia and 12 points behind South Africa. 

According to an ICC release, a 2-3 series defeat will see India remain on 110 rating points but even that will be enough to lift it back above Pakistan and into fourth spot when the ratings are recalculated to three decimal places. 

A 3-2 win will lift India to 112 points (South Africa 119), a 4-1 success will see it rise to third place with 114 points (South Africa will drop to 116) and a 5-0 clean sweep will see Dravids team move into second place with 117 rating points (South Africa will drop to 113 points, although it will remain ahead of New Zealand). 

The batting list is headed by the ICC ODI Player of the Year Michael Hussey of Australia, clear of Chris Gayle, Englands Kevin Pietersen and Adam Gilchrist of Australia. 

Dhoni is Indias highest ranked batsman, in joint sixth placed alongside Australia captain Ricky Ponting.

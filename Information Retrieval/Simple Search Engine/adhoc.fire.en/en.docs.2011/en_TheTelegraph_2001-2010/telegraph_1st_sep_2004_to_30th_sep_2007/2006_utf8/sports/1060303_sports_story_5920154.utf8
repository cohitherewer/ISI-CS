The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sprinters Cup, a graveyard for favourites 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Romantic Fire

 Bangalore: The Bangalore 

 Turf Club has been well spruced up to host the four Grade 

 I races which form part of the Invitation Cup weekend package.

 The first major event of the weekends races. on Saturday, is the running of the Sprinters Cup. It was first introduced in the year 1980 to find out the best sprinter in the country. 

 The first Sprinters Cup was won by a filly ? Guindy Girl, in Calcutta. The filly was ridden by Nasir Baig.

 The only horse who has left a lasting mark on this event has been Common Land. Now a stallion, Common Lands eight progeny have also won this coveted event.

 Among Saturdays contestants for the sprint, three horses merit attention more than the rest. The first one is the Bangalore Sprinters Trial winner Caprese who scored authoritatively over Opera Queen. The win came in one minute 13.25 seconds. Caprese is in fine fettle as indicated by her track work. Hesperus is another strong contender, in the field of 13, having proved his versatility and class.

 Although Caprese is at an advantage because of the home turf, she would have a tough job in hand to contend with the Mumbai hattricker, Oyster Cove, who is also in irresistible form. 

 Calcuttas challenger Romantic Fire, who won in record time back home, may also figure at the finish. 

 Hyderabads Onnu Onnu Onnu has an amazing number of wins ? over 20 back home. He also deserves some support on the basis of his current form. All said and done, the Sprinters Cup has often proved to be a graveyard for favourites.

 The real test of endurance for horses is the 3,000m Stayers Cup. It may well see Star of Windsor bring off a repeat win as he is in good form and appears a cut above the rest. The only realistic threat to him may come from stablemate Forever Elegance.

 Ardiles in the recent past was the one who won this event back-to-back. Jockey Robin Corner, now a trainer in Calcutta, holds the record of winning the event six times and owner D. Khaitan seven times.

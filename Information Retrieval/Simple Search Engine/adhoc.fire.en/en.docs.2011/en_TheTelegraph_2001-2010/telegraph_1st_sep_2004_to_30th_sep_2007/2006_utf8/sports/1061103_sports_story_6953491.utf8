Calcutta: Mohun Bagan won their penultimate CFL Premier Division match against Railway FC to keep frontrunners East Bengal under pressure. The 0-2 defeat confirmed the railway teams demotion to the Super Division ranks next season. 

Ayan Chowdhury scored five minutes after kick-off, while Dipendu Biswas found the mark five minutes from the final whistle to take Mohun Bagans tally up to 27 from 13 matches. 

Railway FC remained on seven points from 13. Even if they win their last game, they will finish behind Eastern Railway who are currently on 11. 

Ayan, who had scored in the previous match against Eastern Railway too, had to leave the pitch with an injury close to the half-hour mark. 

Dipendus goal helped him catch up with Mike Okoro atop the scorers list. Both strikers now have seven goals. 

Dipendus goal was a typical strikers effort. The ball floated into danger zone from the right flank, eluded Eduardo Coelhos head and fell into Chinmoys path. His goalward push rebounded off a defender and Dipendu, who had followed the movement right through, pounced on the ball to slot it home. 

The gap between the two goals was an eternity, but that didnt mean Mohun Bagan had taken the foot off the accelerator. Thanks to Cameroonian Ndems enterprising efforts in Railway FC territory, Mohun Bagan always looked positive and goal-hungry. 

Ndem himself had a couple of misses, as did the strikers. 

As for the railway team, they tested Sangram Mukherjee with the occasional long-ranger.

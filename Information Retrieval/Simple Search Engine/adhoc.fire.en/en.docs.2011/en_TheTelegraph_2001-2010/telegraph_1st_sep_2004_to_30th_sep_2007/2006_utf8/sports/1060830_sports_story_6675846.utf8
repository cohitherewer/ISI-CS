 Houghton running out of patience with AIFF

 - Coach unhappy with lack of support staff 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Houghton wants a more professional attitude 

New Delhi: Bob Houghtons image, since his arrival in India, has been one of a genial man who can take a lot in his stride without much of a fuss. But after watching the way things are moving in the All India Football Federation (AIFF), even his patience seems to be running thin. 

According to federation sources, the British coach is unhappy with the way the national camp, currently underway in Goa, is being conducted and has conveyed his feelings to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco. 

Without permanent support staff, that includes the assistant coach and the physical trainer, Houghton is believed to have told Colaco that it wont be in the best interest of the team to run the camp on such an ad hoc manner. 

The chief coach has been canvassing for permanent support staff for a long time, but his request has still not been honoured. He is very disappointed. However, he has not made his feelings public, Indian team sources said. He has had a discussion with Colaco over this issue. 

On Monday, Houghton met around a dozen club coaches, including six National League clubs, and requested them to follow his physical training and endurance methods even when the footballers were playing for their clubs. Ironically, Houghton does not have a physical trainer with the team at the moment. 

Pradeep Dutta, a qualified physical trainer, was supposed to join the camp but failed to do so as he has not been released by his employers, Sports Authority of India. 

Lack of a physical trainer is certainly harming our preparation as Bob gives a lot of importance to this aspect, a team official said. 

The AIFF has also failed to identify an assistant coach, another important cog in Houghtons wheel. Both Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira and Dempos Maurice Afonso are taking turns as assistant coach every evening during the practice session. 

Both are busy with their clubs in the Goa Professional League and are helping out the national team whenever possible. 

When contacted, Colaco told The Telegraph that a permanent assistant coach on a three-year contract would be appointed very soon. We have shortlisted a few names who would be approached for this job.

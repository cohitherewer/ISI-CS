 Faisal to replace Inzy

Karachi: Right-handed batsman Faisal Iqbal has been named as replacement for banned Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq in a 14-member squad for the Champions Trophy. 

But the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is awaiting ICCs confirmation on the inclusion of the youngster because the squad for the one-day tournament was announced before ICCs disciplinary hearing in which Inzamam was slapped with a four-ODI ban for bringing the game into disrepute following The Oval fiasco. 

The selectors have chosen Iqbal as the replacement. We are now just awaiting the ICC confirmation on this and when that happens he will go with the squad to India, a PCB official said. 

Iqbal had replaced Inzamam in the past during the Karachi Test against India last year and scored his first century in the longer version of the game to help the home team clinch the Test series 1-0. 

Iqbal has played in all of Pakistans six Tests since then notching up some impressive performances. 

But Iqbals selection ahead of some top middle-order batsmen like Shahid Yousuf and Asim Kamal was not an easy task because he has not been so successful in one-day Internationals. 

Meanwhile, Bob Woolmer has urged his young side to learn to live without Inzamam. 

Obviously losing Inzamam is a big loss, both as a player and as captain, but in a way at some stage Pakistan will have to learn to live without Inzamam, Woolmer said.

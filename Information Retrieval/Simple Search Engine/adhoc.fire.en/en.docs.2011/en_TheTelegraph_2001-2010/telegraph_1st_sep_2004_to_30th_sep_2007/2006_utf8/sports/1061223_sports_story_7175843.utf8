 - FEDERATION CUP

 Bijen Singh takes a crack at the Mahindra United goal past defender N. Pradeep at Salt Lake Stadium on Friday. Mahindra won 2-1. A Telegraph picture 

Calcutta: The last four minutes of the first quarter final of the Peerless 28th Federation Cup football tournament at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday was action-packed, with Mahindra United scoring twice and Mohammedan Sporting once. 

Manjit Singh opened the scoring for Mahindra in the 89th minute and three minutes later, Habibur Rehman Mondal restored parity. Within a minute Yasir Yakubu capitalised on an opportunity to throw the black-and-whites out of the Federation Cup. 

During the fag end of regulation time, as the spectators were settling down for another 30 minutes of extra-time, Manjit got into the act. After getting a loose ball, he took a sharp turn to get a better view of the framework and kept it there with great accuracy. 

The joy was short-lived for Mahindra, as Subhas Bhowmicks boys put one across after Bijen Singhs addressed cross was headed down by Jatin Bisht nicely. Habibur, lurking nearby, took a side-volley that found the left corner of the net. 

The next minute, Sushant Mathew, after doing all the hard work on the right, lobbed the ball for unmarked Yakubu, who made no mistake in diverting the ball towards the goal through a precise header. 

Had Eric Bolwe Mputu not left the field after complaining off a right leg sprain, it would have been difficult for Yakubu to get to the ball undisturbed. If Mputu was given the charge of keeping Yakubu in check, he did it with perfection. 

The first session hardly saw any will among players of both the teams to play better. Bhowmicks boys were more keen to thwart the Mahindra moves than make one themselves. 

But both teams showed some zeal in the second half to press for a result. Mahindra played better after the lemon break but Mohammedan Sporting also didnt disappoint. For the latter, things vastly improved after Jamir Ali Mondal replaced Surojit Roy in the 81st minute.

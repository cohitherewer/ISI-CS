 Shane Warne breaks the 1000 barrier

 Melbourne: One thousand not out ? that is Shane 

 Warnes score as far as sleeping with women is concerned!

 Suggestions that Test crickets highest wicket-taker 

 has taken 1,000 women to bed but caught only five times 

 threaten once again to shift public focus from his on-field 

 exploits to those off it. 

The scandalous revelations appear in an unauthorised biography by journalist Paul Barry, titled Spun out. 

It is believed Barry hired an investigator to dig into the spinners private life for the book. 

One of Shanes mates at Channel Nine told me that he reckoned Warne probably had 1,000 women and only got caught five times, Barry says in the book, which is being serialised across some Australian newspapers starting Saturday. 

I thought at the time this was a crazy exaggeration. But now Im not so sure. I personally know two other women who have been propositioned (or more) by him, and my limited knowledge of statistics says there must be a host of others with similar stories.

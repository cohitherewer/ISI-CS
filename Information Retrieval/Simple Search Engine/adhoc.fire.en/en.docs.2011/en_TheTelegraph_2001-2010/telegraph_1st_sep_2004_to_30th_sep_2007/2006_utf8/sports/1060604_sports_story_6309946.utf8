 Quick Takes

 Beckenbauer set for summer wedding

 Berlin: World Cup organising 

 committee president Franz Beckenbauer and his partner of 

 seven years, Heidrun Burmester, will marry in a small ceremony 

 later this summer, Burmester told a German daily on Saturday. 

 Burmester said that the wedding should take place after 

 the World Cup which ends on July 9 and before their five-year-old 

 son Joel returns to school following the summer holidays.

 If we were to invite all 

 those whom Franz knows and likes, we wouldnt find 

 a room big enough. It has to be our day, without stress, 

 she said. It will be the third marriage for 60-year-old 

 Beckenbauer.

 Brazil best bet: Mourinho

 Lisbon: Chelseas 

 Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho believes defending champions 

 Brazil are the favourites as their squad is in even better 

 shape than four year ago. Brazil is the only team 

 which is full of good players, which has maintained the 

 same structure for a very, very long time, he told 

 a news agency on Saturday.

 Not Brazil, says Stoichkov 

 Sofia: Bulgarian coach 

 Hristo Stoichkov tips Ivory Coast to be the surprise package 

 of the World Cup and says Brazil will struggle to retain 

 their title. I cant understand why everyone 

 is afraid of Brazil, he said. I think Brazil 

 will reach the knockout stage but then theyll have 

 to play against stronger teams and itll be difficult 

 for them going all the way.

 Family affair

 London: Croatia will head 

 into the World Cup with two sets of brothers and a father-son 

 combination. Robert and Niko Kovac, and Ivan and Jerko Leko 

 all were selected to play for Croatia by coach Zlatko Kranjcar. 

 The coach also picked his son, Niko. Switzerland also has 

 a pair of brothers, twins Philipp and David Degen. 

 Ball inscription

 London: All 960 soccer 

 balls to be available for use at the World Cup will be inscribed 

 with the date, the names of the teams playing, the venue 

 and the match number. Each of the 64 games at this years 

 tournament will have 15 balls ready for use.

 Referee named

 Berlin: Argentine referee 

 Horacio Elizondo will referee the opening World Cup match 

 between hosts Germany and Costa Rica in Munich on Friday, 

 Fifa said on Saturday.

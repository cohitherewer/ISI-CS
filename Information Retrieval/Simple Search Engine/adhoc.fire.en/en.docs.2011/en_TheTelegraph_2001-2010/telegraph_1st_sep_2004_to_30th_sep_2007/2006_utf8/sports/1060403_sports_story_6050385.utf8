 Madrid: A classy solo goal by Brazilian striker Ronaldo and some outstanding goalkeeping from Iker Casillas helped 10-man Real Madrid come from behind to hold leaders Barcelona to a 1-1 draw at the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

The result did little to stop Barcelonas progress towards a second consecutive league title, however, as they remain a comfortable 11 points clear of their arch-rivals at the top of the table with seven games left to play. 

Real fell behind to a controversial Ronaldinho penalty midway through the first-half and suffered another setback soon after when Roberto Carlos, who had conceded the spot-kick, was red-carded minutes later for saying something to the referee. 

But Real, who were crushed 0-3 by Barcelona at the Bernabeu this season, salvaged a draw and some pride when Ronaldo roared on to a clever through-ball from Julio Baptista and netted with a deft chip eight minutes before the break. 

The win pushed Manuel Pellegrinis side up one place to seventh, while Cup finalists Zaragoza remain 10th. At the other end, basement club Malaga look to be heading for relegation after a 0-3 defeat by fellow strugglers Real Sociedad. 

Ronaldinho sent Casillas the wrong way when he fired low into the corner with his spot-kick. 

Roberto Carlos picked up a booking as he complained about the decision and moments later lost his head and was given a straight red-card after exchanging words with the referee when he was penalised for a foul on Henrik Larsson. 

Minutes later Baptista and Ronaldo manufactured an equaliser out of the blue. Baptista dinked a perfectly-weighted pass over the halfway line into Ronaldos path and the striker powered past the Barcelona defence before sending a classy chip over keeper Victor Valdes and into the net to score against his old side. 

Meanwhile, Italian Champions League quarter-finalists Juventus and AC Milan failed to beat the bottom two clubs in Serie A on Saturday, with Milan suffering a humiliating defeat. 

Milan fell 0-1 to a 54th-minute Cedric Konan goal at Lecce while leaders Juventus were held to a 0-0 draw at bottom club Treviso, who have not won in their last 16 games. (Reuters)

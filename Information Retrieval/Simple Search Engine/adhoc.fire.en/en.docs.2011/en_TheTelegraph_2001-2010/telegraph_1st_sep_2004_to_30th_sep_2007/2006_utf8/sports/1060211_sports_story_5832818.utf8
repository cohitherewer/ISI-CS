The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Agarkar is too predictable

 - Sarfraz assesses Indian pacers 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Sarfraz Nawaz 

Islamabad: Bowling remains one of Indias biggest problems on this tour. Even a score of 328 was not enough to beat Pakistan in Peshawar. 

Former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz feels that the Indians have failed to use the conditions effectively. Fast bowling is not just about speed? It needs imagination and it involves hard work? People should be ready to assess their problems on a regular basis and accordingly work on them, he told The Telegraph on Friday. 

It seems that Virender Sehwag is unplayable if he gets going? But it may not always be so? You have to keep thinking and find ways to get him out. If you have noticed Pakistan are trying to utilise his weakness against the outgoing delivery. He doesnt move his feet and that lands him in trouble, he explained. 

Sarfraz, who recently worked with Shabbir Ahmed on his action, has already spoken to Greg Chappell, Ian Frazer and the bowlers during the reception at the Indian High Commission the other day. 

The following is Sarfrazs assessment of the Indian pacers and the technical frailties that have crept into their bowling: 

 AJIT AGARKAR: He is very stereotype? I havent seen much difference between the Agarkar of today and the one five years ago. The rhythm remains the same and there is absolutely no variation? With his experience he should be able to read into the batsmens weaknesses and utilise them more effectively. 

 ZAHEER KHAN: I believe he is not bowling at his best? He has been out of the side for sometime, and for someone making a comeback, it is difficult. His last stride seems too high during delivery. He shouldnt take that huge jump, but rather focus on going forward in his run-up. That way the pace will also increase. 

 IRFAN PATHAN: His final stride at the time of delivery is causing all the problems. The knee shouldnt bend when the weight is on the front foot. The arm is not co-ordinating with the body. To make a good finish, he has to deliver the ball late. He also has to increase his build if he is to improve on his speed. 

 RUDRA PRATAP SINGH: He can increase his pace by developing his last three strides. He has a good height and has to make full use of it. His finishing is not good and a little more effort should be enough. He, though, seems to be a keen learner and I hope he will correct the flaws quickly. 

 SREESANTH: With what little Ive seen of him, he can develop into a very good fast-cum-stock bowler. But he should learn how to use the crease more effectively and more often.

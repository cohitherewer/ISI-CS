 Zaheer makes a comeback

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The national selectors on Sunday decided to reward the performances during the home series against Sri Lanka and South Africa in picking the 15-member squad for the five one-day Internationals against Pakistan. 

Mohammed Kaifs inclusion was a formality but that the likes of Suresh Raina, S. Sreesanth and Murali Kartik have been retained proves that the selectors have full faith in coach Greg Chappells 2007 World Cup vision. The big comeback has been of Zaheer Khan, who has proved his worth with performances in the Test series. 

Jai Prakash Yadav was hardly convincing in the several opportunities during the two home series and his exclusion was in the offing. 

The cricketers who will take the flight back home after the Karachi Test are Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble, VVS Laxman, Wasim Jaffer and Parthiv Patel. 

We decided to retain the combination that played against Sri Lanka and South Africa. This is the best team that we have chosen, selection committee chairman Kiran More said after announcing the team in Mumbai. 

The squad includes five fast bowlers ? Zaheer, Irfan Pathan, Ajit Agarkar, R.P. Singh and Sreesant ? and two spinners.

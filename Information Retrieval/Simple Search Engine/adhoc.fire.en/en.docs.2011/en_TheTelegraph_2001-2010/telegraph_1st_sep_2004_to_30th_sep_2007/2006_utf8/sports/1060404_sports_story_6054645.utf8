Duluth: Phil Mickelson completed his US Masters preparations in emphatic style on Sunday, coasting to a record third BellSouth Classic title by 13 shots at the TPC at Sugarloaf. 

The defending BellSouth champion, eight strokes clear overnight, eagled two of the last six holes for a seven-under-par 65 and a four-round total of 28-under 260. 

His winning margin was the largest on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods clinched the 2000 US Open at Pebble Beach by 15 strokes, and has been bettered only six times in Tour history. 

It was certainly a fun week and I was very pleased with the way I played, a beaming Mickelson told reporters after competing the second wire-to-wire victory of his career. 

I had some good practice days but it really means a lot to actually have the scores reflect the way I felt I was playing, in fact, maybe even a little bit lower. That was nice. I feel as though Im starting to get really sharp as far as distance control and some of the areas Ive been working on. 

I think those areas are going to be critical next week for a good performance at Augusta, especially given the changes and how difficult its playing. 

BellSouth champion in 2000 and again last year, the American left-hander birdied three of the first six holes to stretch his lead to 10. 

Play was delayed for 45 minutes because of the threat of lightning after he reached the 15th tee, but Mickelson went on to record the 28th PGA Tour win of his career by holing an eagle putt at the last. 

Mickelson also became the tournaments first repeat winner since compatriot Hale Irwin in 1977. Irwin is among seven players who have triumphed twice at the BellSouth. 

American Zach Johnson birdied the last four holes to close with a two-under-par 70 and a tie for second place with Spains Jose Maria Olazabal (69) on 15-under 273. 

Asked if he had any concern about peaking too early for next weeks Masters, Mickelson replied: I dont think so. It was a great week, dont get me wrong, but I didnt feel like it couldnt be repeated. 

Mickelson, who produced sparkling form all week from tee to green, broke the BellSouth record for 72 holes. 

The previous mark was jointly held at 23-under 265 by American Andy Bean (1979) and Canadas Dave Barr (1987), both doing so when the event was staged at Atlanta Country Club. (Reuters)

 Powell powers to 100m gold; Pini creates history

 Melbourne: Jamaicas 100m world record holder Asafa Powell won his first major title on Monday at the Commonwealth Games. 

Leisel Jones smashed a world record in the 100m breaststroke as Australias women swimmers delivered on their promise to turn the Melbourne Aquatics Centre into their private golden pond. 

Powell never threatened the world record of 9.77 seconds he set last year, racing across the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 10.03 seconds. I can run sub-10 any time but Im just not ready, Powell said. 

Im pleased. I didnt want to push too hard because Im just coming off an injury, he said. 

Sheri-Ann Brooks won the womens 100m in 11.19 seconds to seal a Jamaican sprint double in front of more than 80,000 spectators. 

Jones slashed more than six-tenths of a second off her breaststroke world mark to capture her third gold of the Games. Teammate Libby Lenton picked up two in two hours to take her total for the week to four, with another one in the pipeline. 

My goal was definitely to go out and get the world record, but Im pretty shocked by the time, Jones said. 

The absence of Australias serial record-breaker Ian Thorpe has thrown up surprising results in the mens swimming this week, with England and Scotland the main beneficiaries. 

Nothing compared, however, with Ryan Pinis achievement in winning the 100m butterfly. He beat former world record holder Michael Klim to win gold for Papua New Guinea, a country which has just one full-length swimming pool. 

It was Papua New Guineas second Games title after a gold in bowls at Auckland in 1990 and Pinis victory made him, in an instant, his countrys greatest sportsman. 

Its going to be so huge. I cant wait to get back there and show off my medal, he said. 

Kenya won their second gold in Melbourne when former junior champion Augustine Choge won the 5,000m, kicking clear of Australias Craig Mottram on the final bend. 

Australia won four golds in the pool and on the track on Monday, the busiest day of the Games, and another six across bowls, shooting, squash and gymnastics to raise their overall total to 42 after five days of competition and with six left.

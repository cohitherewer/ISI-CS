 Ive enjoyed working with Rudi

 - Some may not need sports psychology at all, but that doesnt mean it should be dismissed: Dravid

Team India captain Rahul Dravid had a few things to say about sports psychologist Dr Rudi Websters ongoing sessions with Team India. This is what he said Saturday afternoon: 

If we keep telling players that the mind is critical in sport, then we also need to tell them how its to be kept tough... I do believe a certain amount of sports psychology is good... Of course, its a personal thing... Like medicine, which could work on some and not work on others... Some may not need sports psychology at all, but that doesnt mean it should be dismissed... Its not a must, but does give an opportunity (to look at things differently)... Personally, Ive enjoyed working with Rudi, who has worked with top sportspersons having varying levels of intelligence... The language of cricket is the same, as is the terminology... So, communication isnt a problem... That he was himself a very good first-class cricketer (a fast bowler) helps... Rudi will be working with us before the World Cup as well...

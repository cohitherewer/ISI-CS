Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goa took sweet revenge of last years Federation Cup final defeat, when they came out with flying colours outplaying Mahindra United by a 72nd minute Dudu Omagbemi strike at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

Though the result doesnt say much about the pattern of the first semi-final of the Peerless 28th Federation Cup, for the record it was Sporting who made the title-round within the regulation time. They will play the winners of Mohun Bagan versus Dempo match to be held on Wednesday. 

Both the teams started on a cautious note as most of the recent battles between the two tilted in favour of the Goans. The two have now met thrice this season with Sporting winning on two occasions (other one in Durand Cup) while the match ended in a draw in the IFA Shield. In the Durand Cup too, Dudu scored the winner. 

Mahindra United were without the services of former India captain Shammugam Venkatesh while Mahesh Gawli, who started in the midfield, returned to action after recovering from injury. Chandrasekhar Chinta took Venkateshs place in the midfield. 

This match was also a duel between two foreigners Dudu and Yusif Yakubu of Mahindra in which Dudu had the last laugh on Boxing Day. Dudu kept the Mahindra defenders on their toes all the time while Yakubu was bottle-necked. Seeing Yakubu under strict vigil, Manjit Singh tried to penetrate on a few occasions but was outnumbered in front of Bello Rassaq, Mathew Gonsalves and others. 

Though on paper Mahindra were a better side, the proceedings all through proved just the opposite. Dudu was brilliantly supported by Ernst Jeremiah, who did all the hard work to keep the supply line intact. 

Quite early in the 13th minute, a Dudu header missed the target after Jeremiah essayed a long ball from left flank. Dudu with his subtle touch made the Mahindra defenders lives miserable, especially after the change of sides. 

Just before the winner, Sporting could have conceded one when Felipe Gomes clearance hit the horizontal. 

The all-important goal came in the 72nd minute when a Nicholas Rodrigues free-kick from right was nicely placed to the far post by Dudu through an impeccable header. 

In an unnecessary incident, frustrated NS Manju was given the marching orders for hitting Bello Rassaq on his face in the dying moments of the match.

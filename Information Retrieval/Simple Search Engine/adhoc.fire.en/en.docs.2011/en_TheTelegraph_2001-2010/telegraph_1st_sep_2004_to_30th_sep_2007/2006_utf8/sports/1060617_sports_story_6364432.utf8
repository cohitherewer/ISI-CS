 Ecuadors dream to win over Germany

Hamburg: Ecuador, double winners so far in group A of the World Cup, is dreaming big of winning the group with a victory over host Germany Tuesday. 

We want to win each and every match and we will try that against Germany on Tuesday in the closing group match, said midfielder Edwin Tenorio. 

The match will determine the winner of the group, as both Ecuador and Germany have already advanced to the eighth finals. Ecuador trounced Costa Rica 3-0 Thursday night. It had beaten Poland 2-0 in the debut. 

Tenorio, who plays for Barcelona of Guayaquil, Ecuadors largest city, says the consistency and self-confidence shown by the team so far allow us to dream big. 

Some praise to Ecuador came also from outside. German coach Juergen Klinsman said that Ecuador have a very strong team which has shown why it placed third in the South American World Cup qualifiers. (AP)

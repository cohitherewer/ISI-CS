Calcutta: Avishek Jhunjhunwala and Manoj Tewari have been roommates for a while. Their transition from the junior stages to the big league have been almost together and the duo has played a huge role in ensuring Bengal sit pretty in their Ranji Trophy match against Mumbai at the Eden. 

At close on the second day, Bengal were 540 for six, their highest-ever total against Mumbai, with Avishek making 114 (340 minutes, 264 balls, 18x4) and Manoj unbeaten on 182. A personal milestone awaits Manoj if he manages to get past Arun Lals 189 not out the highest individual score for Bengal against Mumbai at the Eden in 1989-90. 

Avishek completed his second Ranji hundred in the morning and the pair put on 99 for the third wicket. Their understanding and running between the wickets put the visitors in disarray in the morning. Their application along with the ability to play each ball on merit was the reason behind their superb performances. 

Avisheks dismissal and the fall of two other quick wickets helped Mumbai bounce back, but Manoj along with Laxmi Ratan Shukla ensured that the advantage was not lost. Bengal will bat on the third morning to allow Manoj to complete his double century. 

With the wicket showing signs of wear and tear, the inexperienced Mumbai players will face a tough task. The variety in Bengals bowling, coupled with home advantage, will make things difficult for the visitors. 

It will all depend on how things turn out tomorrow morning. Nilesh Kulkarni has turned a few deliveries I feel the wicket will afford spinners on the last two days The idea will be not to give them a chance. We want to bat them out, Deep Dasgupta said. 

Manoj, Indias former under-19 captain and best cricketer during 2004-05 season, was confidence personified during his 419-minute vigil at the wicket. He moved into the nineties with a straight six and completed his maiden hundred with a reverse sweep. The 21 fours were timed to perfection and he was never bothered by the circumstances. Coming in at No.4, he held the innings together. 

Rohan Gavaskar sacrificed his wicket following a misunderstanding and Deep played too early, but nothing was able to unsettle Manojs focus. Chairman of selection committee Dilip Vengsarkar was also around to witness his superb effort. 

These are early days, but the youth brigade in Bengal cricket has certainly made their mark. Even the Bengal captain was effusive in praise. These guys are our future There has been a major change in their approach and thinking. They bring in a lot of exuberance and spirit. With the experienced guys around too, things have never been difficult in tricky situations. Thats why were potentially the best team in the country, Deep said. 

Mumbai bowling was largely unimpressive, though they have reasons to feel let down by some poor umpiring decisions.

 BCCI to stake claim for final

 - 2011 World Cup

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Senior BCCI official I.S. Bindra said on Friday that he was hopeful of India hosting the final of the 2011 World Cup to be co-hosted by Asias Big Four. 

Speaking on the sidelines of a press conference on Asias successful bid, Bindra said: No decision has been taken on this, but there is a chance of the final being held in India. In 1996, India hosted the two semis and Pakistan the final. This time we have reasons to stake our claim for the final. 

Bindra claimed the World Cup will generate $400 million more than any other bidder. I told them that the international body makes $2 million from a match day whereas we make $8.77 million, which is more than four times. 

Bindra said that the West Indies voted for the Asian countries because they thought it was in the best interest of world cricket, while BCCI president Sharad Pawar said Asias position was quite weak on the eve of the meeting in Dubai. 

I must say our position was weak. Australia and New Zealand had submitted their bid in time and were well prepared, Pawar said. They had all the necessary guarantees from the respective governments. 

Without naming anyone, Pawar said the ICC had sent letters to the BCCI about the compliance document last year but full details were not known then and the correspondence was lost during the change of regime in the BCCI. 

We were informed about all these thing by Pakistan officials after reaching Lahore, Pawar said. We decided about the joint bid there only. 

The president conceded that facilities at Indian grounds need to be improved and promised a facelift before the World Cup. 

We are even planning to build a stadium of our own in Delhi. The land has been acquired long ago, we hope to build a top-class stadium with an indoor academy, a club and a residential wing, Pawar said.

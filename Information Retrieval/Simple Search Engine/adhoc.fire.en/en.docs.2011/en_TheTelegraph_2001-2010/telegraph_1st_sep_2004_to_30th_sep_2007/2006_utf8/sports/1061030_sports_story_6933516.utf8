Calcutta: Thanks to Indian forwards wayward finishing, Kyrgyzstan escaped with a 1-1 draw in a group A match of the AFC Youth Championship at Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday evening. 

Ildar Amirov put Kyrgyzstan ahead quite against the run of play in the 44th minute. However, India equalised in the 69th minute when substitute Lalkamal Bhowmick converted the only spot-kick of the match. 

Indian colts had only themselves to blame for not getting the full points. The onus for letting the visitors share points should be on Sushil Kumar Singh, rated as a highly talented youngster. The Mohun Bagan striker needs a few lessons from his senior pro Bhiachung Bhutia on how to score. 

Sushil missed at least four opportunities, which even a half-fit Bhaichung would have converted at ease. It was a wonder why Indian coach Islam Akhmedov persisted with him till the 90th minute. Sushils miss in the 53rd minute was the easiest of the lot when he failed to control gem of a through from his Mohun Bagan teammate Lalkamal. 

Lalkamal, on the other hand, showed impeccable touch and ball control. The only area where he needs to work on is his off-the-ball game. That the chances created by him were squandered by his colleagues were besides the point, but this little star promises to be an asset for Bob Houghton. 

Kyrgyzstan side couldnt produce much as they were busy defending all through the 90-minute affair. It will be grossly wrong to blame them for their lacklustre display. Any side, which landed in the venue just on the eve of the match, needs some time to get used to the conditions. 

Indians played well in both sessions, though the display was superb in the final half, courtesy the advent of Lalkamal. 

The first goal showed that Kyrgyzstan were not going to be the push-overs. Roman Ablakimovs forward pass to Vladimir Verevkin and the latters minus to Amirov found the latter in an unmarked position. Amirov made no mistake slotting the ball to the left of the goalie. 

Indians, 0-1 down, looked to score on every opportunity and ultimately they got it through a penalty. Another talented forward Branco Vincent Cardozo, who put the opposition defenders in all sorts of trouble, advanced from the right dodging past one inside the penalty box, but he was tackled by defender Stephan Miagkih and the Iranian referee Mohsen Torky pointed to spot. 

Lalkamals grounder went in despite the custodian Pavel Matiashs well-stretched effort. 

India could have pumped in at least three after the equaliser, but unfortunately, their wish for a winner never returned fulfilled.

 Caprese may call the shots 

 SRIMAX

 In her lead up race to the Sprinters Cup, Caprese beat Opera Queen in a convincing manner. Since then she has been working attractively and is in pink of condition. She may well do the trick from the start in the hands of Mark Gallagher.

 Darius Byramji trained Hesperus who was beaten by Caprese in her last outing over seven furlongs, should run the favourite close.

 Onnu Onnu Onnu is the one who can upset all. The Narayan Rao-trained six-year-old horse is in great form but he may find the young ones a hard nut to crack. 

 In the other Grade I race, the 3,000m Stayers Cup, the S Ganapathy trained Star Of Windsor seems to have an edge over his stablemate Forever Elegance. Star Of Windsor, who won the event last year, has struck form at the right time. Having won his last outing over 2400 meters with much to spare, he is expected to repeat his performance in the hands of Donoghue. Forever Elegance and King Of Hearts can follow Star Of Windsor home in that order.

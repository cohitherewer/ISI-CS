 Shoaib, Asif hearing put off till Monday

Karachi: The hearing of Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif against their doping bans by an appeals commission was on Wednesday adjourned till Monday. 

Both tested positive for nandrolone before the start of Champions Trophy. 

The three-member commission, headed by Justice Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim, was forced to adjourn the hearing after Shoaibs lawyer Abid Hasan Manto said the Pakistan Cricket Board had still not provided him with certain documents without which he was unable to prepare for the case. 

Ebrahim told reporters in Lahore that from November 20 onwards, day-to-day hearings would be held till the case was concluded. 

Today we couldnt make much progress but we have told all parties that the appeals need to be disposed of expeditiously and they should come prepared for the next hearing, he said. 

However, Mark Gay, a London-based legal consultant brought in by PCB, made a brief presentation on the case from the PCB point of view. 

Gay, who had also helped the board fight its case against the ICC after the Oval Test fiasco in August, specialises in dope ban cases. He will assist the tribunal if they so require, Ebrahim said. 

Sources said that Shoaib, whose career is on the line, had asked his legal advisor to prepare a defence based on previous cases of athletes who tested positive for nandrolone and successfully argued that their trainers had given it to them by mistake in nutrition supplements. 

British tennis player Greg Rusedski was cleared in March 2004 after having tested positive for nandrolone. 

Ebrahim said he wanted to see justice done in the case and had set no date to conclude the case. But obviously we want a conclusion as soon as possible but only after the legal counsels of both players have had a full opportunity to present their cases, he said.

 Landis result on Saturday

Paris: Tour de France winner Floyd Landis, who tested positive for testosterone on his way to victory in cyclings showpiece event, will know on Saturday if the counter-analysis he has requested, confirms the result. 

On Saturday morning we should know, that is what the French laboratory told us, International cycling union (UCI) spokesman Enrico Capani said by telephone on Tuesday. 

The sample will be tested at the Laboratoire National de Depistage du Dopage (LNDD). 

On Monday afternoon we have asked them to analyse the B sample because Mr Landis had not asked them to do so, he added. The laboratory will communicate the results to the Phonak team and to us. 

If the test is confirmed positive, the American would be stripped of his Tour title and Oscar Pereiro Sio of Spain, who finished second overall in this months race, would be declared the winner. 

It would be the first time in the history of the sports biggest event that a Tour winner has been disqualified for doping. 

His Phonak team said Landis would be dismissed if the B result was also positive. 

The American, who has denied any wrongdoing and said his body naturally produced high levels of testosterone, has said he intended to continue racing once he has had an operation on his hip. 

The 30-year-old tested positive for the male sex hormone after an astounding comeback in the last mountain stage of this years Tour in the French Alps, just a day after a very poor performance which all but knocked him out of contention. 

If the positive test is confirmed, USA Cycling, the American federation, would have a month to make a ruling, the most likely decision being a two-year ban. 

Landis lawyers could then take the matter to CAS and a long procedure would begin.

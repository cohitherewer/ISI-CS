 Ljubicic tops in Vienna

Vienna: Top seed Ivan Ljubicic won his third title of the year by beating fifth seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 in the Vienna Open final on Sunday. 

The lanky Croatian, who added to his championships in Chennai and Zagreb, is the first player since Roger Federer in 2002 and 2003 to successfully defend the title 

Its great to (successfully) defend a title. Its the first time in my life, said Ljubicic. And I defended the biggest title I have, so its great. 

Ljubicic was also runner-up this year in Miami and Bangkok. He is the second player this year to win a title without dropping serve after Mark Philippoussis who won in Newport. Last year, too, he won in Vienna without dropping serve. (Reuters)

 Want to win it for Inzy: Younis

Islamabad: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan will lead his country in the Champions Trophy after regular skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq was banned for four one-day Internationals on Thursday. 

I have been told today that I have to captain the side, Younis said on Friday. 

A Pakistan Cricket Board official said Younis would be formally confirmed as captain in the next few days. 

We are going to miss Inzamam in the Champions Trophy and we want to win it for him because he took a stand for us and the country, Younis said. 

It is not going to be easy as the players are comfortable with his style of captaincy and he is our best batsman.

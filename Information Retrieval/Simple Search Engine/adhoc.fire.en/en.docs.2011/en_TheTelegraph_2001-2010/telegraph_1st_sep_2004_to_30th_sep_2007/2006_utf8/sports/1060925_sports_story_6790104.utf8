 Atwal shares 45th place

San Antonio: Two birdies on either side of the turn and just one bogey during the round helped Arjun Atwal make a small recovery from tied 66th to tied 45th after three rounds of the Valero Texas Open Golf Tournament. 

Needing some good finishes to ensure a full PGA Tour card for 2007, Atwal shot a three-under 67 and is now two-under 208 after 54 holes. 

Eric Axley, still looking for his first PGA Tour win after nine years as a pro, fired a second successive 63 and is now four shots clear of the field. 

Three players were tied for second at 12-under, including Ted Purdy, who shot a 64. Alongside Purdy in a tie for second were Frank Lickliter (65) and 2004 Ryder Cup player Chris Riley (64). (PTI)

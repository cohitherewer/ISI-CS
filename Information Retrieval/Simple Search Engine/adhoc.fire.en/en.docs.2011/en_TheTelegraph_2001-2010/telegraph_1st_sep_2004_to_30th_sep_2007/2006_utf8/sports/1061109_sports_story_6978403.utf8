 Zidane gets a job offer

Dhaka: Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed offered Zinedine Zidane a new job on Wednesday as an election observer in the nations parliamentary polls this January. 

The proposal came after Zidane, who has spent two days in Bangladesh at the invitation of Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, said he was overwhelmed by his reception and promised to return. 

The President told Zidane that he was very popular in Bangladesh. He invited him to be an election observer for the upcoming general elections, an official statement said after Zidane met with the President. 

Bangladesh has been rocked by violent protests ahead of the polls as opposition parties contest the independence of the election commission and call for its chief to quit. (AFP)

 Botham says Warne greatest ever cricketer

Melbourne: Legendary England allrounder Ian Botham believes Shane Warne is the greatest player to have set foot on a cricket field. 

In my opinion, Shane Warne is the greatest cricketer whos ever lived, Botham said. 

Warne, who announced his retirement after Australia reclaimed the Ashes from England taking a 3-0 lead in the five-Test series, is being described as the second greatest cricketer of all time behind Sir Donald Bradman, but Botham said the spin-wizard deserved the highest accolade. 

Im sorry, but I cant judge people who played 30 or 40 years before I was born because I think you can only really comment on what youve seen first hand. 

And of the players Ive seen, Warnie is out on his own, Botham was quoted as saying by a local newspaper. 

Botham appreciated Warne for signing off in style when he was still on the top of his career. 

Just like the showman he is, with the job done, the stage set and the applause raining down he is making his exit and all I can say is well done mate, he said.

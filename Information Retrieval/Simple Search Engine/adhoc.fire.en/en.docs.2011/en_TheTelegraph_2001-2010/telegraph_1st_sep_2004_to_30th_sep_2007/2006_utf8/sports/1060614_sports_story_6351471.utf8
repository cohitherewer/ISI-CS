 Player of the Day

 Tomas Rosicky

 Tomas Rosickys stunning 

 double strike against the US on Monday proved that there 

 are few players in the world today who have as much talent 

 as the Czech Republics attacking midfielder. Nicknamed 

 Little Mozart, Rosicky plays the game with elegance 

 and has phenomenal work-rate. 

His dribbling skills are a treat to watch and he has a sensational peripheral overview when he takes shots at the opponent goal. No wonder Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger has recently snatched him away from Borussia Dortmund on a rumoured transfer fee of $6.8 million. 

Rosicky, who became mildly unpopular in Dortmund in the last couple of years because of his inconsistency, struck the first goal in the 36 th minute. 

 It was simply superb when he fired a curling right-footed drive that flew past goalkeeper Kasey Keller, who dived in vain. Rosickys second goal was equally good. He broke away from the centre of midfield, ran past the US defenders and then flicked a left footed shot past Keller. 

Son of a famous former Czechoslovakia footballer, Rosicky is sometimes described as a striker. But he is at his best as an advanced midfielder with the freedom to move behind the main striker. That is the role that hes often taken up with the Czech Republic to great effect, especially with fellow Dortmund player Jan Koller up-front.

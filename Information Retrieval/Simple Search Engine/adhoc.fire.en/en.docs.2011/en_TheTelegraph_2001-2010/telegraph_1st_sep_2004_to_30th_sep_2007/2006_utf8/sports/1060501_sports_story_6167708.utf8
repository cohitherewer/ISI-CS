 Zurich Classic Meet

 New Orleans: Unheralded 

 American Chris Couch defied gusting winds to take charge 

 at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans on Saturday while Phil 

 Mickelson climbed into contention.

 Journeyman Couch, who has made 

 just two cuts in nine starts on the 2006 PGA Tour, fired 

 an eight-under 64 to forge one shot clear in the Round III.

 The 32-year-old reeled off nine 

 birdies at a blustery English Turn Golf amp; Country Club 

 before dropping his only shot at the par-four last, finishing 

 at 12-under 204.

 Overnight leader Joe Durant battled 

 back from six bogeys in the first 10 holes to card a 73.

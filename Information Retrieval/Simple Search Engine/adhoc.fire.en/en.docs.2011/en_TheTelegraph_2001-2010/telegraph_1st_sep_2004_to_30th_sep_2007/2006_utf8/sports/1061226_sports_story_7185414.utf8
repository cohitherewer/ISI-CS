The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inquiry about Maharashtra player 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The touring Maharashtra side may find themselves in a soup. The CAB Sunday sought a clarification from the BCCI administrative head Prof Ratnakar Shetty, inquiring about a Maharashtra debutant who is apparently registered with the Mumbai Cricket Association. 

Prof Shetty also did confirm to The Telegraph that: A member from the Bengal camp had called me up in the morning inquiring about a player However, today being a holiday, I could not look into the details. 

According to sources, there are two players affiliated with the Mumbai association while Pratik Desai represents Hindu Gymkhana, Prashant Bhoir plays for the New Hind Club. If the protest is upheld, according to BCCI rule, the concerned team can be disqualified for the season and the player for two seasons. 

Maharashtra Cricket Association president Ajay Shirke, however, said: These players have played in the Maharashtra U-17 this year This is no issue at all since they have never represented Mumbai. 

Bengal manager Samir Dasgupta, however, pleaded ingorance about the development.

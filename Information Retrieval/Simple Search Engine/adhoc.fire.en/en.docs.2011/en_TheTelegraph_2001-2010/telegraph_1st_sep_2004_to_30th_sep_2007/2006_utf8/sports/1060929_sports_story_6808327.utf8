 India to play Uzbekistan

New Delhi: India were drawn to visit Uzbekistan for the first round tie in Asia-Ocenaia Group I of the 2007 Davis Cup tennis competition. 

A victory in the February 9-11 tie would see India play either Kazakhstan or Korea in the second round from April 6-8. Winning that tie would promote India to the September 21-23 play-off for World Group. 

India avoided relegation to Asia-Oceania Group II this year by beating Pakistan in a play-off. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 WI need 243 more in 2 days

Auckland: The West Indies need a further 243 runs with two days and all 10 wickets in hand to win the opening Test against New Zealand. 

The tourists ended the third day at Eden Park on Saturday on 48 without loss, chasing 291 for their first Test win in over nine months. 

Chris Gayle was unbeaten on 28 and fellow-opener Daren Ganga on 20, with the temporary drop-in pitch, which had been notoriously difficult for the first two days, suddenly showing signs of flattening out. 

If someone told us at the start of the Test that we had to score 240-odd with two days left, we would happily grab it, Ganga said. 

New Zealand were bowled out for 272 midway through the final session after starting the day on 98 for four. 

Brendon McCullum top-scored with 74 off 126 balls while Stephen Fleming and Daniel Vettori made 33 apiece. 

History is still with the home team. Its been nearly 40 years since a side has scored more than 291 in the fourth innings to win at Eden Park and Ganga said the visitors werent taking anything for granted. 

New Zealand were in all sorts of trouble when they lost skipper Fleming (33), nightwatchman James Franklin (20) and injured batsman Nathan Astle (13) before lunch to slump to 146 for seven, McCullum and Vettori came to the rescue. 

McCullum struck seven boundaries and a pulled six off Fidel Edwards to register his sixth Test fifty.

Miami: Roger Federer lost his first tie-break this year before beating Arnaud Clement 6-2, 6-7, 6-0 as he began his title defence at the Nasdaq-100 Open on Saturday. 

Womens champion Kim Clijsters suffered a shock, though, as she lost 5-7, 6-3, 5-7 in the second round to Jill Craybas. 

Federers victory enabled him to equal former world number one Pete Samprass 19-match Masters Series winning streak. The Swiss began his run in Hamburg last year while Samprass took place from Indian Wells to Stockholm in 1994. 

The Swiss top seed seemed headed for a straight sets win against Clement but squandered a 4-0 lead in the second set tie-break as he tried to close out the contest against the Frenchman who beat Rafael Nadal in Marseille last month. 

Federers uncharacteristic lapse saw him drop seven straight points as 53rd-ranked Clement forced a deciding set. It was the world number ones first loss in nine tie-breaks in 2006. Federer quickly snapped back with a break at the start of the third set and quickly wrapped up the match as he earned his 23rd win of a season that so far includes just one defeat. 

He will face German Tommy Haas in the third round after the former world number two beat Perus Luis Horna 6-0, 6-3. 

Second seed Clijsters of Belgium was joined at the exit door by her former fiance Australian Lleyton Hewitt, who lost for the first time in nine meetings toTim Henman. The Briton ended the streak with a 7-6, 6-3 victory over the mens 13th seed. 

Clijsters, deposed as world number one by Amelie Mauresmo on Monday, showed signs of rust as she played her first match since losing the Antwerp final to the Frenchwoman in February. 

The US Open holder committed 78 unforced errors against unseeded American Craybas and was broken six times during the two hour 15 minute contest. 

Last weekends Pacific Life Open finalist Elena Dementieva, seeded sixth, defeated Anna Tatishvili 6-3, 6-1.

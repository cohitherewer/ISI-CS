 Leipus stresses on education

 - Boards must ensure complete monitoring... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Jaipur: Besides educating players, cricket boards must ensure complete monitoring six months before competitions with random dope testing. This is former Team India physio Andrew Leipus opinion. 

Having worked with the Sachin Tendulkars from October 1999 till December 2004, hes currently a consultant with the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced random dope testing during his India-innings early 2002. 

The players need to know about drugs which are prohibited and theyve got to be careful with medication... I cant recall the name, but there was an easily available medicine for the common cold which contained a banned substance... So, unintentionally, the popping of a pill may have very serious consequences, Leipus told The Telegraph Tuesday. 

Speaking from Mumbai, where he has based himself for some months now, he added: Id in fact asked the players not to take any medicine without my permission in the lead-up to the 2003 World Cup... Also, I think a file was prepared for each one of them and the ICC intimated about any ongoing treatment... Youve got to tell the world body before a dope test, not after... 

Leipus informed that the Indians had even undergone dope tests in New Zealand, the tour which preceded the last World Cup, in southern Africa. That was done as a precautionary measure... Id made a power point presentation, listing what needed to be known by the players... I guess one has to handle this professionally... 

He confirmed that Nandrolone, which has led to the mess which Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif are in, could be used to enhance recovery from injuries. Yes, it can quickly regenerate muscles, but cant be taken like any other drug... I wouldnt like to guess how Shoaib and Asif got hold of it and in what form... 

Leipus continued: You know, the thing about being tested positive is that youre guilty till youre able to prove otherwise... And, that may be tough... 

Asked whether cricket would no longer be seen as a low risk sport (for drugs abuse), he said: I disagree... Cricket, you see, is a skills-driven sport unlike sprinting or middle-distance running... Thats where athletes try to enhance performance... Because of the very nature of cricket, I think it will continue to be seen as having a low level of risk... 

Frankly, the jury is out.

Chandigarh: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, whore at the centre of a doping scandal, have declined to get their B sample tested at the same World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada)-accredited lab in Malaysia where the A sample showed theyd taken the banned nandrolone. 

Earlier reports coming out of Pakistan, stating that the B sample had tested positive, were incorrect. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the offer to get the B sample tested was made by the three-member Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) tribunal which formally met in Lahore for the first time, Friday.

Besides making that offer, the tribunal took written statements from the tainted duo and called them again, Saturday. One understands that two doctors have been invited to lend their expertise. 

Its not clear whether the special invitees can cross-examine Shoaib and Asif.

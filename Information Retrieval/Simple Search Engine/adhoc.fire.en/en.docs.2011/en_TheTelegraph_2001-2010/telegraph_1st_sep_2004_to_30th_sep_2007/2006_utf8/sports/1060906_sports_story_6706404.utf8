Southampton: Paul Collingwood and Jamie Dalrymples 101-run partnership helped England to reach 271 for nine against Pakistan in the third one-day cricket International on Tuesday. 

Pakistan were 44 for two after 10 overs with Younis Khan (19) and Mohammed Yousuf (0) were at the middle. They have lost the Shoaib Malik (1) and Mohammed Hafeez (20). 

Dalrymple hit 62 and Collingwood contributed 46 in their fifth-wicket partnership, steadying the England innings from 125 for four to 226. Both were dismissed by Rana Naved-ul-Hasan, who finished with figures of four for 58. 

Naved-ul first removed the leg stump of Dalrymple, then four overs later, dismissed Collingwood for 61, with Shoaib Akhtar catching him at square leg, and England on 250. That prompted a tail-end collapse. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq won the toss and elected to field in the day-night match at the Rose Bowl. England need to win to keep alive their chances of a series victory after they lost the second one-dayer by seven wickets on Saturday and the opening game was declared a no result because of rain. 

Marcus Trescothick was out on the first ball of the day, with Shoaibs inswinging yorker hitting first his pads, then the stumps. 

 England reached 79 for two before Andrew Strauss edged to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal off Abdul Razzaq on 50. Hed hit eight boundaries in his 67-minute innings. 

Kevin Pietersen fell at 113 for three, edging the ball with his inside edge to Mohammed Hafeez for 20. 

England put on 12 more runs before Shoaib took his second wicket, with Bell caught by Hafeez at point for 62.

 AIFF may change Santosh venue 

 - 3 players of Indian origin join U-20 camp 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF), it seems, has started the process of shifting the venue for the Santosh Trophy from Srinagar. 

Though a two-member AIFF team, led by general secretary Alberto Colaco, is leaving for Kashmir on Saturday for inspecting the venues and other facilities, there are strong indications that Srinagar now stands little chance of hosting the national meet in September. 

A final decision on this issue will be taken during the executive committee meeting of the AIFF to be held in the capital on July 29. It may be recalled that two major state associations ?? Bengal and Goa ?? have already expressed their reservations about playing the Santosh Trophy in Srinagar in light of the terrorist activities there. While the Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Subrota Dutta said he would not send the team to Srinagar, the Goa Football Association (GFA) has already passed a solution requesting the AIFF to change the venue. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Colaco said: The federation has already received offers from three state associations, who are willing to host Santosh Trophy. While the AIFF has already made inspection of facilities in Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Orissa have also come forward to stake their claims. 

 Asked in that case why he is going to Srinagar, Colaco said: The AIFF president has asked me visit Srinagar and submit a report. The report would also include the security aspect and state of other facilities. 

Haryana Football Association (HFA) on the other hand, if allotted, is keen to stage the tournament on a grand scale. HFA secretary Sunil Bhardwaj claimed that the state government has promised to sanction Rs 1.50 crore if the AIFF sanctions the Santosh Trophy to the state. 

Colaco indicated that if the venue is changed then the tournament will be held only in October and may be played without leading players. 

Meanwhile three players of Indian origin ?? Simran Singh, Arvind Narayanand Umesh Kaushal ?? have joined the national U-20 camp in Goa on Friday. 

While attacking midfielder Simran plays for second division Danish side KFUM Copenhagen, Kaushal is defender from Canada, who plays for Palatine Celtic in the US. Like Kaushal, midfielder Arvind Narayan is also a product of Illinois State Olympic Development Programme.

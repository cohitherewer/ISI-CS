 Federer bowled over by kids

Cuddalore: Impressed with his first visit to India, world No. 1 Roger Federer, Unicefs Goodwill Ambassador, on Friday said he will visit the country again and try to garner more assistance for tsunami victims. 

After spending nearly 45 minutes at an orphanage here, the nine-time Grand Slam champion said he would devote more time for social service. 

I would rather step in early than late. I am in the prime of my career. I am making so much money and I realise how lucky I have been. 

I have been trying to tell them (the children) that I shall always be there for them. This is my first trip to India. Has been great. I will come back, said Federer, here as a part of the Unicef Tsunami Recovery Programme. 

Federer, who refrained from fielding any questions on tennis, said: Kids are the future. I inspire them and in turn they inspire me. I have made some really good friends here today. I spent quite some time with the children. I know what their names are, what they study, he said. 

I am happy to see the happy faces of all the kids here... Both young and old. Its nice to see that a great programme is happening here. You can be proud of the government and the people and Unicef who have helped in this, Federer said. (PTI)

 McGrath ahead of schedule

Sydney: Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath believes he is ahead of schedule in terms of returning to full fitness to play in the Ashes series later this year. 

The 36-year-old, who has not played for his country since January because of his wife Janes ongoing health problems, underwent a successful practice session in Brisbane last week. 

It will take a little while to build it up but Im probably in front of where I thought I would be, McGrath said on Tuesday. It felt great. To have six months off and to go up there and feel that good, it doesnt take long to feel like you havent had a break, he added. 

It just feels like another day at the office, the body feels good, just running in to bowl, so that was very good to get into the outdoor nets. 

McGrath, third on Test crickets all-time list with 542 wickets, said he would not be targeting any England batsman in particular. 

There are a few new guys that are coming who are doing well, McGrath said. Theres the young fellow (Alastair) Cook whos done well so far. Hes one of many. 

McGrath said he still had an open mind about when to aim to return to the Australia side, with the Champions Trophy in India in October his current preference. 

I guess the selectors are meeting later this week and I will have a chat to them before that, he said. Theres that pre-ICC tour coming up in Kuala Lumpur, which is out of season theres nothing in Australia so that might be a good hit-out to see how things are going. My preference would probably be to go to India, its a good place to really build it up. 

On previous tours Ive been there, Ive always come back to Australia and bowled well straight away, whether its been a one-day tour (or a) Test tour. I sort of look at it a bit like our players doing altitude training. Theres no harder place for a fast bowler than india, so when you come back to australia to bowl on the wickets here it gives you a huge lift. (Agencies)

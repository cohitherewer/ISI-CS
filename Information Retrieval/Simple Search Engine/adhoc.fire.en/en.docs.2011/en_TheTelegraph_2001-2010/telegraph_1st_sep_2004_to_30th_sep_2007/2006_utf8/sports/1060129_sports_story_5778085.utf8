 Bryan twins edge out Paes-Damm

Melbourne: Top seeds Mike and Bob Bryan of the US came from a set down to beat Czech Republics Martin Damm and Indias Leander Paes 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in the Australian Open mens doubles final on Saturday. 

In a tense, dramatic match full of superb net play by both pairs, Paes and Damm broke Mikes serve in the seventh game to give the Indo-Czech pair the first set. The Bryan twins broke Paes in the eighth game of the second set to send the match into a decider. 

The Americans broke Damm early in the third set before facing intense pressure on their own serve. The Bryans saved one break-point in the sixth game and four in the eighth to set up the opportunity to serve out for the match. 

I had nothing left in my body by the end of that match, Bob told a news conference. 

Bhupathis chance 

An Indian could still be on the winners podium on Sunday, if Mahesh Bhupathi and Martina Hingis manage to overcome Daniel Nestor and Elena Likhovtseva. 

Bhupathi, chasing his third straight mixed doubles 

crown after triumphing with Mary Pierce and Daniela Hantuchova at Wimbledon and 

US Open, has had a great run here, too, on his maiden stint with Hingis. The Indo-Swiss 

pair is not seeded but should start as the favourites.

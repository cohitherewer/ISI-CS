 Sania moves into Round II

 Sania Mirza in action on Wednesday 

Seoul: Indias Sania Mirza of India overcame a poor first set to crush South Koreas Lee Ye-ra 3-6, 6-0, 6-0 in the first round of the Korea Open Wednesday. 

Top-seed Martina Hingis, meanwhile, coasted into the second round with 6-3, 6-2 win over Danish teenager Caroline Wozniacki. 

Hingis, a former world No. 1, won six straight games and took little over an hour to beat 16-year-old Wozniacki, who won this years Wimbledon junior title. 

It was stressful to get here from India, said Hingis, who won the Sunfeast Open title in Calcutta on Sunday. I was able to step up my game even though I was tired. 

In second round play, fifth-seeded Vera Zvonareva of Russia downed Finlands Emma Laine 6-4, 6-0, Japans Akiko Morigami beat countrywoman Aiko Nakamura 7-5, 6-2 and Eleni Daniilidou of Greece rallied to beat Russias Vera Dushevina 1-6, 6-1, 6-0. 

Hingis, who is looking for her third WTA title since returning this year from a three-year hiatus, said the competition was stiffer this time round. The players are better, more relentless, she said.

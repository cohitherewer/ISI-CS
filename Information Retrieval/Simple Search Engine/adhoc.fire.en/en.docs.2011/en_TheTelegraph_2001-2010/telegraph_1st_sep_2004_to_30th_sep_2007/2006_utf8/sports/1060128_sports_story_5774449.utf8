 Mauresmo seeks elusive title

Melbourne: The Australian Open final between Justine Henin-Hardenne and Amelie Mauresmo pits a player grateful for the chance to revisit past glories against one still seeking her elusive first Grand Slam title. 

In what is shaping up as a battle of the backhands, eighth seed Henin-Hardenne is hoping to put an injury-plagued year behind her by winning her second Australian title and fifth Grand Slam crown. 

In the semi-finals on Thursday, a heart-breaking injury to newly-crowned world No. 1 Kim Clijsters propelled Mauresmo into the final. Clijsters, plagued by injuries for the last two years, fell and hurt her right foot and was forced to quit with Mauresmo leading 5-7, 6-2, 3-2. 

Clijsters expects to be out of action for at least eight weeks after injuring herself in the Australian Open. Its bad news concerning my ankle. The scan showed a torn anterior ligament which means Ill be absent for at least eight weeks, she said. 

Henin-Hardenne beat fourth-seeded Russian Maria Sharapova 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. Both matches were played indoors because of the extreme temperatures. 

Third seed Mauresmo showed immense potential when she made the 1999 final in Melbourne as an unseeded 19-year-old, losing to Martina Hingis, but has since failed to live up to that promise at Grand Slams. 

The muscular Frenchwoman went some way to removing doubts about her ability to close out big matches by winning the season-ending WTA Championships in Los Angeles in November for the biggest win of a career which includes 19 singles titles. 

I think after LA I really convinced myself I was capable of doing it, Mauresmo told a news conference on Friday. It came at the right time for me. 

A clear favourite with the bookmakers, the Belgian holds a 4-3 career record over Mauresmo, winning their last two meetings, including the 2004 Athens Olympics final.

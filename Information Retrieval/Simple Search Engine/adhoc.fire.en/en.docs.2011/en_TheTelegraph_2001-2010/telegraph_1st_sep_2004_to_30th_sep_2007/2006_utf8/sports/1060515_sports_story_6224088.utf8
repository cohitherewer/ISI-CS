 Petrova beats Justine to title

Berlin: World number four Nadia Petrova beat French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 in the German Open final on Sunday. 

The Muscovite dug deep in the deciding set and gained revenge for her defeat by the Belgian in last years final. 

The decisive thing was my fighting spirit, Petrova said. I dont think I made the best start today but I really put my heart into this match.

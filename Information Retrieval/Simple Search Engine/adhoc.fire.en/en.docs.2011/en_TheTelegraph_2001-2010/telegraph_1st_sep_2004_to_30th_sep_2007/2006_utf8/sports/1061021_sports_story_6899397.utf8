 PCB appoints Dr Ahmad as third member

Karachi: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday appointed senior sports medicine specialist Dr Waqar Ahmad on the drugs inquiry tribunal set up to hear the version of pace duo Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

With the appointment of Ahmad, who is head of sports medicine in the Pakistan Sports Board, the tribunal is now complete and will begin work at 9 am on Saturday. The three-member tribunal, led by noted barrister Shahid Hamid and also including former Test captain and coach Intikhab Alam as the other member, is expected to complete its task in three weeks time and submit its recommendations to the Board. 

Shoaib and Asif face a possible one to two-year ban from all cricket if the tribunal decides they intentionally took steroid nandrolone to enhance their performances. 

But, the official said, the hearing was an internal matter of the Board and could recommend a softer punishment. 

First let us see what the results of the B sample show up. Until those results come out as positive the players to my mind are not guilty as yet of taking performance enhancing drugs, Dr Ahmad said.I dont think there has ever been a B sample in a nandrolone case that doesnt confirm the A sample. We have to presume it will be likely to happen, said one expert. 

However, he pointed out that since nandrolone was also found at times in supplements and protein diets used by athletes, Shoaib and Asif had a fair chance of getting a lenient punishment if they could convince the tribunal they did not take the drug intentionally or knowingly. 

Meanwhile, Bob Woolmer gave a new twist, saying the pace spearheads could have bought over-the-counter products designed to help them bulk up. Woolmer said if the players had taken some medicines on their own, it was something to worry about. If anything is happening outside our sphere of influence, thats what will worry me, he said.

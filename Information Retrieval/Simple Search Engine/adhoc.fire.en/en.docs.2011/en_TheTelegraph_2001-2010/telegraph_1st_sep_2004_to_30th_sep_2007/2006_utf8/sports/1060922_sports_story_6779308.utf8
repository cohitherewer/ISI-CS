The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Changes in rankings, points structure on anvil

 - Steps to keep Tour in tune with times

Calcutta: It was in 1973 that Billie Jean King founded the Womens Tennis Association (WTA), bringing all lady professional tennis players under one umbrella. The US Open, for the first time, offered equal prize money to men and women. In 1995, the WTA Players Association merged with the Womens Tennis Council to form the WTA Tour. 

In 2005, Sony Ericsson became the Tours worldwide title sponsors in a landmark $88-million, six-year-deal. It was the largest sponsorship deal in the history of tennis and in womens professional sport. 

The Tour is growing everyday and experimenting along the way, to improve and keep pace with evolving trends and changes. 

This year saw the Tour experimenting with on-court coaching whereby coaches could come on court to speak to and advise players. This was a huge success, as was the system of electronic line-calls, whereby players could challenge line-calls, Tony Cho, WTA Tours tournament supervisor at the Sunfeast Open, told The Telegraph. 

Both changes have come in for much praise from players and will be tried at three more tournaments this year in Stuttgart, Zurich and Linz. 

Next year, the WTA is mulling some more changes. Different ranking and points structure for one, elaborated Cho. Some changes in doubles are also on the anvil like two sets and a match tie-break in the third, as the ATP has already started. This too, will be tried out in three tournaments this year itself. 

The Korea-born supervisor who has been an official for 20 years (and a tournament supervisor for 10 odd years) is very impressed with the organisation of the meet here. By the time he reached the city on Friday, everything was in place. The courts are playing well, the quality of surface is fantastic and the colour contrast (purple courts and yellow balls) are just right for the players and TV audience. 

But what about the issue bothering all sports right now, doping? 

Earlier this month, Cho informed, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and WTA Tour announced that starting January 2007, the former will assume full responsibility for the management, administration and enforcement of the Anti-Doping Programme at all WTA Tour-sanctioned events. 

The agreement, to run till the end of 2011, will see the ITF undertake a full testing programme at all Tier I to IV WTA Tour events, as well as the season-ending Championships. 

The ITF believes that getting the entire Tennis Anti-Doping Programme to be managed under one umbrella is the most efficient and sensible way forward for tennis, ITF President Francesco Ricci Bitti had said. All three governing bodies, the ITF, ATP and Sony Ericsson WTA Tour, have the same objective to protect our players and keep our sport drugs-free ...

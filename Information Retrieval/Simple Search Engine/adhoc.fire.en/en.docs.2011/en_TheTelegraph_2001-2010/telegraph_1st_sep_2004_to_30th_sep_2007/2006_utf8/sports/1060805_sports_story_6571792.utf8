 RCTC, bookies to meet again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Bookmakers meeting with the RCTC stewards, on Friday, failed to yield any compromise formula pertaining to dues, demanded by Amusement Tax department. They will meet again on Sunday, informed a bookmaker.

 Fridays meeting was fixed between the two after bookmakers threatened to quit last Wednesday as bookies felt that the club was trying to put its financial liability on them. 

 RCTCs misinterpretation of a tax department notice in 1986, not only landed the club into a financial burden of about Rs 4 crore, during the next four years, but it also left the bookies having to cough up an equal amount of money. 

 Phone calls made by The Telegraph were not received by the stewards.

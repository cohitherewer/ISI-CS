 Super-fit Michael Owen thrills Eriksson

 - Striker may lead in friendly vs Belarus tomorrow

Michael Owen is in his best shape for many years, according to Englands delighted head coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, on Monday. Eriksson plans to make Owen his captain and partner him with Peter Crouch for the B international against Belarus at the Madejski Stadium on Thursday. 

Owen has managed only 29 minutes of football since fracturing a metatarsal on New Years Eve but is clearly over the problem, judging by his flying form in training on Monday when he was smashing the ball as hard as ever. Hes super-fit, Eriksson said. Owen is physically fantastic. You can see how hungry he is to play football. 

Probably well play Crouch and Owen up front for this game. Owen needs games. Im not worried. What I saw last week, Im very, very happy. He trained excellently. He was on fire. I dont think Ive seen Owen in such a good shape for many years. I guess when he got the injury his mind was always on the World Cup. He was afraid of not playing in the World Cup. I saw a happy face last week. Hes better today than he was in his first or second World Cup. 

Eriksson added that many of his first-team regulars would be rested on Thursday, including Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Gary Neville, John Terry, David Beckham and Paul Robinson. 

David James is expected to keep goal at the Madejski while Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole will start in defence to sharpen their competitive edge after injury, probably alongside Michael Dawson at centre-back and Jamie Carragher at right-back. Eriksson confirmed Carragher as Gary Nevilles understudy on Monday. 

With Theo Walcott scheduled to come on during the game, Eriksson said that Aaron Lennon and Stewart Downing will probably start against Belarus either side of Jermaine Jenas and Owen Hargreaves in midfield. 

If Michael Carrick is omitted, it will intensify speculation that Eriksson will start with a 4-5-1 formation with Carrick anchoring, Lampard in central midfield and Gerrard operating almost as a second striker behind Owen. 

Much will depend on Thursdays scan on Wayne Rooneys metatarsal. Ive always been very positive ? maybe more with my heart than with my head ? and Im quite sure Rooney will at some stage during the World Cup be ready, said Eriksson. Rooney is desperate to play. I spoke to him last week. He thinks he will be okay. 

The stand-by striker, Andy Johnson, was allowed to leave training on Monday for what the FA described as unspecified reasons believed to be a meeting with his club, Crystal Palace, who have received offers for him from Premiership teams. 

Another stand-by player, Nigel Reo-Coker, has withdrawn owing to a back injury and been replaced by Phil Neville.

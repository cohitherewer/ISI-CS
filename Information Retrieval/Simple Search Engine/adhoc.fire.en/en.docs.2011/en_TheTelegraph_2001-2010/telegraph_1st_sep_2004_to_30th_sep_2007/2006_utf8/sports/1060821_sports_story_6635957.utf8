 Two world records fall

 - Peirsol betters own mark

Victoria (Canada): American Aaron Peirsol set a world record in the 200m backstroke and the US team did likewise in the 4x100 freestyle relay at the Pan Pacific Championships on Saturday. 

Peirsol reaffirmed his place as an unbeatable force in the 200m backstroke with a time of 1:54.44, breaking his own world record by more than two-tenths of a second. 

Peirsol now holds nine of the fastest times posted in the event and has not lost an international competition in more than six years. 

With the backstroke you can really hear the crowd, and the crowd was great tonight, he said. If I can take it out that fast, I can always bring it home. I realised I had a lot left in my tank. 

Led by multiple Olympic gold medallist Michael Phelps, the US 4 x 100m freestyle team also set a world record en route to a gold medal. Phelps, Cullen Jones and veterans Neil Walker and Jason Lezak turned in a blistering time of 3:12.46, more than six-tenths of a second better than the previous mark set by South Africa at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. 

Among the other highlights was South Korean teenager Tae Hwan Parks win in the mens 400 freestyle, his countrys first gold medal at a major international meet. 

Park, who turns 17 in September, outlasted American favourite Klete Keller to a time of 3:45.72. 

Japans Reiko Nakamura took gold in the womens 200m backstroke with a meet record of 2:08.86. Margaret Hoelzer of the US nabbed the silver and Takami Igarashi bronze. 

 Ian Crocker cruised to an easy 

 victory in mens 100m butterfly with a meet record 

 of 51.47 seconds ahead of Japans Ryo Takayasu and 

 Takashi Yamamoto.

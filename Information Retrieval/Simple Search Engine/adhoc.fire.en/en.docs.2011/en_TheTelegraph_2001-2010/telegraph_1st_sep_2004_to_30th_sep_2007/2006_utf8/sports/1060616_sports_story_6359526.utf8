 Rana joins injury list

Karachi: Pakistan received a fresh setback on Thursday with pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan being rendered doubtful for the first two Tests against England owing to a groin injury. 

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman said Rana Naved would fly to England on Saturday and will meet Sussex medical commission for an assessment of his injury which he picked while playing for Sussex earlier this month. 

The news comes as a double blow for Pakistan who are already without the services of pace spearhead Shoaib Akhtar, recuperating from a stress fracture in the ankle. 

The spokesman said the injury was serious and could rule the bowler out of the first two Tests. 

Rana Naved returned from England on Tuesday and looks in serious discomfort. His injury would be examined by PCBs medical commission. He will also undergo a series of tests and the reports would be sent abroad for opinion, he said. 

Fast bowlers Rao Iftikhar Anjum and uncapped left-armer Samiullah Niazi have been called to attend the camp as Rana Naveds cover.

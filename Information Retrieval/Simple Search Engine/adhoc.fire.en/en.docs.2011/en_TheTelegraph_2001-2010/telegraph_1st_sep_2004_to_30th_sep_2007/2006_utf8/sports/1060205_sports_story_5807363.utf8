 Mystical may upstage Liaison 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: The Mahalaxmi racecourse had a dress-rehearsal for Sundays mega event on Saturday. The attendance was much bigger, taking the usual weekend crowd by surprise. The Derby-magic is working again.

 Its going to be a close contest for about Rs 5 million winners purse in the 2,400m McDowell Indian Derby. Of 11 aspiring winners, Mystical, Aristotle, Holding Courtand Romantic Liaison, the only filly in the field, are the four horses who have the right credentials to lift the coveted trophy.

 Mystical has not done anything wrong since the S. Ganapathy-trainee struck form. The Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memory son is the Derby ante-post favourite. Ganapathy has enormous belief in his money-spinner. He is looking and working well. He is also performing on expected lines. Ive full faith in his abilities; said Ganapathy.

 Trainer Vijay Singhs duo of Aristotle and Romantic Liaison, too, has done well for stable. Aristotle, started his innigs late but gone on to win the Calcutta 2000 Guineas and the Derby. Romantic Liaison, on the other hand, already has the Indian Oaks under her belt, after her cantering win in the Calcutta 1000 Guineas. Vijay expects his two horses to be right there at the finish. Very little separates the two. In fact, it was a tough call for 

 Cristopher to make the choice in favour of Romantic Liaison; said Vijay. Its a very strong Derby field. Everything will have to go right for my horses to win; Vijay added.

 Holding Court had a very fruitful summer season in Bangalore but the Royal Kingdom-Confiture son went backwards early in the winter. A minor ailment, which bothered the S.Padmanbhan-trainee, was attended to and corrected subsequently. His recent victory over Flareon, in an open Class handicap, was indicative of his return to form.

 In the final analysis, Mystical, in the hands of jockey B. Prakash, appears to have a thick edge over the rest. He has been producing a workmanlike performance since his Juggernaut started rolling on. The MAM Ramaswamy-property is unbeaten in his five start, though he will be testing his hooves over the Derby trip for the first time. 

 The challenge to Mystical may come from Romantic Liaison and Aristotle ? the Vijay-duo. But considering the fact that that Romantic Liaison has already displayed her superior Class against the western India youngsters, the Razeen-Veenas Pet daughter is expected to trouble Mystical in the final stretch.

 Justine, Amelie in quarters

 - NEW HAVEN MEET 

New Haven: Justin Henin-Hardenne looked anything but rusty on Wednesday night in her first match since Wimbledon. The second-seeded Belgian cruised into the quarter finals of the Pilot Pen with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Anabel Medina Garrigues. 

Recovering from a right knee injury, Henin-Hardenne accepted a wild card to New Haven last week hoping to regain the form thats earned her 27 singles titles, including five majors. Henin-Hardenne takes on Mara Santangelo of Italy in the quarter finals. 

Amelie Mauresmo, the top-seed, lost the first set then came back to beat Galina Voskoboeva 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. 

Mauresmo withdrew from last weeks Montreal Masters because of a strained right shoulder and is using this event to test the injury before the US Open, which starts on Monday. She is seeded No. 1 there. 

She will play seventh-seeded and defending champ Lindsay Davenport in the quarter final. Davenport advanced with a 6-4, 6-2 win over Francesca Schiavone. 

Fourth-seeded Nadia Petrova lost to Marion Bartoli of France 6-4, 4-6, 6-7 (4-7). Wednesdays setback was her fifth consecutive loss in her first match of a tournament. 

Santangelo, the lucky loser, reached the quarter finals when Li Na had to withdraw with a sprained ankle. 

In mens action, second-seeded Nikolay Davydenko beat Paradorn Srichaphan 6-4, 6-1 to reach the quarters. 

Third seed Marcos Baghdatis was ousted 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), 5-7 by unseeded Swede Robin Soderling and No. 5 David Ferrer was crushed 3-6, 1-6 by No. 10 seed Agustin Calleri of Argentina. Belgian Olivier Rochus, Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela, lucky loser Juergen Melzer of Austria, Belgian Xavier Malisse and Chilean Nicolas Massau all advanced to the last eight. (Agencies)

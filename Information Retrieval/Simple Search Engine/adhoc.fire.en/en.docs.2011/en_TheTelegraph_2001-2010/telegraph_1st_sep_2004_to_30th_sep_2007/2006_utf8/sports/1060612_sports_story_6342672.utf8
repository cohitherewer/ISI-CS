The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 DAY I HIGHLIGHTS

 The 

 159-run first wicket stand between Wasim Jaffer and Virender 

 Sehwag surpassed the following landmarks:

 The 

 unbeaten 126-run stand between Sri Lankans Maravan Atapattu 

 and Sanath Jayasuriya in 2002-03 was the previous best for 

 the first wicket at this venue.

 The 

 136-run stand between Sunil Gavaskar and Aunshuman Gaekwad 

 in Kingston,1975-76 was Indias previous best for the 

 first wicket in the Caribbean.

 Sehwag 

 (99 not out at lunch), who missed the opportunity of becoming 

 the fifth batsman in Test history to make a century before 

 lunch on the first day of a Test, set a new record by scoring 

 his eighth consecutive 150-plus score. Since his 195 against 

 Australia in Melbourne in December 2003, Sehwags scores 

 have been: 309, 155,164, 173, 201, 254, and 180. He thus 

 betters the previous best 150-plus score sequence (seven) 

 held by South African Gary Kirsten, who from December 1999 

 to October 2002, had scores of: 275, 180, 150, 220, 153, 

 150,160.

 Sehwags 

 33-ball fifty was the second fastest by an Indian batsman 

 in Tests after Kapil Devs 30-ball fifty against Pakistan 

 in Karachi, 1982-83. Sehwag now shares his effort (off 33 

 balls) with two other batsmen ? Kapil (twice) and Harbhajan 

 Singh.

 It 

 was, however, the fastest fifty by any batsman against the 

 West Indies bettering the 36-ball effort by New Zealands 

 Bruce Taylor in Auckland, 1968-69. For the record, Sunny 

 Gavaskar needed 37-balls to reach fifty during his knock 

 of 121 against the West Indies in Delhi, 1983-84.

 Sehwags 

 78-ball century was the second fastest by an Indian batsman 

 in Tests after the 74-ball efforts by Kapil Dev (versus 

 Sri Lanka in1986-87) and Mohammed Azharuddin (versus South 

 Africa in 1996-97). However, he equalled the record for 

 the fastest century against the West Indies held by Pakistans 

 Shahid Afridi, who, too, needed 78 balls to reach his century 

 during his 122 in Bridgetown, 2004-05.

 The 

 wicket of Yuvraj Singh was Pedro Collins 100th in 

 his 30th Test match. He becomes the 17th West Indian and 

 138th bowler overall to claim 100 or more wickets in Tests. 

 Incidentally, Collins becomes the first genuine West Indian 

 left-arm pace bowler to achieve this feat and also the tenth 

 such bowler in Tests. 

 Indias 

 361/4 is the second highest score made on the opening day 

 of a Test by any team in the Caribbean. Australia had made 

 391/3 in Port-of-Spain in 2002-03.

 The 

 above total was also Indias second highest-ever on 

 the first day of a Test match. India had made 372/7 against 

 South Africa in Bloemfontein in 2001-02.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Narrow wins for Milan, Liverpool

London: AC Milan settled for a 1-0 victory over Red Star Belgrade and there was a scare for 2005 Champions League winners Liverpool before they edged Maccabi Haifa 2-1 in Wednesdays third qualifying round action. 

Ajax Amsterdam were 2-1 winners at FC Copenhagen, as were AEK Athens at 10-man Hearts following two late goals. Hamburg SV drew 0-0 at home to Spains Osasuna in other first-leg games. 

A month to the day since Italy won the World Cup, four of their squad Filippo Inzaghi, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso and Alberto Gilardino helped Milan to a morale-boosting win. It was Inzaghis 33rd birthday and the striker celebrated in style by poaching the winner after 22 minutes at San Siro. 

At Anfiled, Liverpool went behind when Gustavo struck in the 29th minute for the Israeli side, but were spared further embarrassment by two of their new signings. 

Welsh forward Craig Bellamy equalised four minutes later, but the Reds looked to be heading for a surprise draw until Chile winger Mark Gonzalez rifled home the 88th-minute winner. 

Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored both goals for Ajax in Copenhagen as the Dutch side staked claim to a place in the money-spinning group phase of the competition.

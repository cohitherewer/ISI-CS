The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Out, in and out again

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Test specialists Anil Kumble, V.V.S.Laxman (with wife) Wasim Jaffer and Parthiv Patel checked out of the Sheraton here twice in not many hours. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, they left for the airport late on Wednesday night, intending to take a chance on a Sri Lankan flight from Colombo to Mumbai via Karachi. No seats were possible as it was over-booked. 

So, the quintet returned to the Sheraton and checked-in afresh. They checked-out yet again, on Thursday morning, this time to board a PIA flight for Mumbai. 

The other Test specialist, former captain Sourav Ganguly, leaves for Calcutta (via New Delhi) on Friday morning. National selector Ranjib Biswal will also be on the same PIA flight.

 JCT ride Chettri brace to sink Salgaocar

Panaji: Sunil Chettri struck a brace to guide JCT to a 3-1 win over struggling Salgaocar in the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup, at Mapusa on Friday. 

JCT put up a spirited performance and dictated terms for the major part of the game. Chettri combined well with Brazilian Marcos Pereira gave JCT the lead in the seventh minute when he fired home a pass from Pereira, which left the Salgaocar custodian Juje Siddi speechless. 

Seven minutes later, Chettri scored his second goal after again being fed by a Pereira free-kick. Jaswinder Singh then sealed the fate of the Goan outfit when he volleyed home a Pereira shot. 

Salgaocar, came close to scoring only on one occasion as Fabio dos Passos shot hit the post. 

The win took JCT tally to 13 points from 11 matches while Salgaocar are still lying at the bottom of the points table with eight points from 12 matches.

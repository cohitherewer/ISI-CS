 We are losing a big legend: Federer

London: World No.1 Roger Federer spoke of his admiration for Andre Agassi on Sunday following the Americans announcement that he will retire after this years US Open. 

We are losing a big legend of the game, so its never pleasant, said triple Wimbledon champion Federer. 

But I think hes had a terrific career. I was lucky enough to play against him. Maybe well play more, maybe here, maybe down in America. 

Federer failed in his bid to complete his Grand Slam collection by winning the French Open earlier this month and the Swiss hailed Agassis achievement in winning all four Grand Slams during his career. 

Its an incredible effort. It is an incredible achievement to win all four Grand Slams. 

The way he did it, it was basically unexpected both times. To win Wimbledon, he beat Goran (Ivanisevic in 1992). Nobody expected him to win here. 

To win at the French (Open in 1999) against (Ukraines Andrei) Medvedev, that came as a surprise, too, although he should have won earlier. 

Federer last played Agassi in the US Open final last September when he subdued the Las Vegan to win in four sets. 

Hes aggressive non-stop. Thats his game. Hes definitely not going to change it because of the opponent or anything, Federer said. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and partner Martin Damm feel that their seasons first victory at the Ordina Open marks the end of a disappointing year, another report adds from New Delhi. 

Martin and me lost a bunch of matches that were really close. So winning the tournament here gives us a lot of confidence for the rest of the year, Paes said on Saturday. 

Its a double-edged sword for Wimbledon. You go in with a lot of confidence, but the flip side of that is you get to Wimbledon only two days before the event. You have to acclimatise, he said. (Reuters)

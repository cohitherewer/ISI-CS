 TITAN BOY

 Prakash

 S. Ganapathys ward Mystical, 

 ridden by B. Prakash, scored an emphatic victory over seven 

 rivals to lift the 1,600m Karnataka Cup at the Bangalore 

 races on Sunday.

 The afternoon was otherwise ruled by jockey C.Alford, who notched up a popular treble through Ryeback, Three Of Arts and Exclusive Gesture. The last named horse, in particular, was the most impressive of the Alford-winners while winning the Sir M.Visvesvaraya Memorial Cup (Div-II).

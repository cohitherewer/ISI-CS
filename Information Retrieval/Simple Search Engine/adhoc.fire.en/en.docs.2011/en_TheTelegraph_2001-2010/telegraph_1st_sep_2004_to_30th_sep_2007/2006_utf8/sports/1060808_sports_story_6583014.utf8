 Lynette recovering after brain surgery

 Steve Waugh with wife Lynette 

 Sydney: The wife of former 

 Australia captain Steve Waugh is recovering from brain surgery 

 to remove a blood clot after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage 

 last week. 

Lynette Waugh, 38, was taken to the Prince of Wales private hospital here on Friday after complaining of feeling unwell and was operated on by neurosurgeon Charles Teo. 

The haemorrhage was very serious and the blood clot was removed to expedite her recovery, Steve Waugh said in a joint statement with Teo. 

She remains in hospital and is currently undergoing further investigation to find the cause of the haemorrhage. Her progress has been encouraging. 

Steve Waugh would like to acknowledge the enormous public support we have received in relation to Lynettes illness. This is much appreciated by all of the Waugh family. 

The 41-year-old Waugh, renowned for his gritty approach to the game, captained Australia 57 times and achieved 41 victories the most by any Test captain. 

Waugh, who made his debut in 1985, hit 32 Test centuries and led Australia to victory in the 1999 World Cup. 

 The couple, married in 1991, has three children.

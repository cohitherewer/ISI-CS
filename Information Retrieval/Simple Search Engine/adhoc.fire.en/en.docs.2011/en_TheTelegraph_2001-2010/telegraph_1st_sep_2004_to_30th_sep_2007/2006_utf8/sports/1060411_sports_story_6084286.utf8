The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players hope for better results under new coach

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Subhas Bhowmick is yet to arrive in Goa to take up his new coaching assignment, but Mohammedan Sporting footballers have already started practising in accord with his schedule. 

According to Mohammedan Sporting sources, Bhowmick called up his boys in a Margao hotel on Sunday night and chalked out a practice schedule. He asked us to follow it till he arrives on Tuesday morning, striker Raman Vijayan said. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Raman Vijayan said: Only a few senior footballers like us knew about Bhowmicks appointment on Sunday. He asked us over the phone to skip practice on Monday morning and instead do a few stretching exercises in the pool in the evening. 

The black-and-white brigade is quite confident that things would change under Bhowmicks regime. 

Some of us including Raman Vijayan, Madhab Das, Bijen Singh, Amjad Khan and Gopal Das have already played under him in East Bengal, said a player. We all know how professional he is. We welcome him. 

Most of the players came to know about Bhowmicks appointment through a TV channel on Monday afternoon. 

The recent controversy over his role as a Central Excise officer wont affect our morale in any way, said a player. 

The players have been taken aback by the abrupt way in which the erstwhile coach, Mohammed Habib, left. 

We are surprised and rather disappointed by the way he left us, said Raman Vijayan. 

Habib left the team in a huff after Mohammedan Sportings 0-3 drubbing against Sporting Clube de Goa on Saturday. 

On Sunday morning, Habib asked his wards to practice on their own and had his baggage packed. 

He told us that he was leaving for Hyderabad as his daughter was unwell and promised to come back the next day. Only later we realised that he has left us for good. 

Bhowmicks return has elicited mixed feelings in Goa. 

While Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira refused to comment, Sporting Clube coach Clifford Chukuwama said it wont make any difference. 

Its good that Bhowmick is back, but I dont think he can perform any magic for Mohammedan Sporting. As far as NFL is concerned, its too late.

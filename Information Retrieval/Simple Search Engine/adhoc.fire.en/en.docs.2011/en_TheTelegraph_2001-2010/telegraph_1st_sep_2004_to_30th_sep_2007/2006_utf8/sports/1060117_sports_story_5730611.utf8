Honolulu: Arjun Atwal and Daniel Chopra opened their 2006 season on the US Tour with a modest 42nd place tied finish at the $5.1m Sony Open in Hawaii on Sunday. 

Atwal, the 2003 Asian No. 1, who was 17th at the midway stage, dropped a double bogey on the 15th and a bogey on the 16th before he recovered a little with a birdie on the closing 18th for a 72 that saw him total an even par 280. 

Atwal signed off the week with rounds of 70, 69, 69 and 72, while Chopra bounced back from an opening 76 with cards of 65, 70 and 69 as they finished on 280. Chopra had three birdies and two bogeys in his final round of 69. 

South Koreas Choi Kyung-ju was the best Asian as he fired a closing one-under-par 69 to settle for tied 13th place. The Asian stalwart accumulated rounds of 66, 71, 68 and 69 for a six-under-par 274 total. 

American David Toms (65) stormed to victory with a 19-under-par 261 aggregate. He ended five shots clear of second place Rory Sabbatini who shot a brilliant eight-under 62 on final day. 

This was Tomss 12th career PGA Tour title, coming two months after surgery to correct a rapid heart rate. 

I played another solid round today (Sunday), kept the ball in play and just kept the pressure on Chad, a relaxed Toms said after securing the first prize of $918,000. I feel good. Im confident in my game and my ability and thats what I want to do, to win. 

Toms, rushed off the course at the 84 Lumber Classic last September with his heart beat racing, no longer has any concerns over his health. Im fine, he added. That is definitely behind me. Ive come a long way from that day in Pennsylvania. 

Chad Campbell, overnight joint leader with Toms, slipped brought in an even par-70 and ended tied second with Sabbatini. 

Defending champion Vijai Singh (66) was sole sixth at nine-under 271. Reigning Asian Tour No. 1 Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand, Indias Shiv Kapur and South Koreas Charlie Wi missed the cut.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I knew I had it in me, says Bindra

 - Shooting is the No. 1 sport in our country 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: Abhinav Bindras 

 gold-winning performance in 10m air rifle at the Zagreb 

 World Championship may have surprised many, but not the 

 man himself.

 Smartly attired in a printed shirt 

 and cream trousers, the 24-year-old shooter from Chandigarh 

 was a picture of calmness when he faced the media shortly 

 after landing at the Indira Gandhi International airport 

 Friday morning.

 I knew I had it in me, 

 said the shooter on arrival, where he consulted a specialist 

 for a chronic back pain.

 The Athens Olympics was 

 a big boost. When I finished seventh there, I was confident 

 I could do it on the big stage some day, said Bindra, 

 who was a world record-holder at the junior level as well.

 Asked to explain his feelings 

 the moment he ensured the gold medal in Zagreb, Bindra said: 

 Not much really. One could be tempted to interpret 

 that as snobbish, but it was clear from his next answer 

 that Bindra was very honest in assessing his performance.

 Now that he had become the countrys 

 first shooting World Championship gold-medallist, will he 

 be able to get Indias maiden individual Olympic gold 

 in Beijing two years from now?

 How can I say about it now? 

 Bindra said with a wry smile. Shooting is a highly 

 competitive sport. Today I am a world champion, things could 

 be different in the next meet. I have no control over others 

 performance.

 Bindra made a strong statement 

 for his sport. In my opinion, shooting is the No. 

 1 sport in the country. We have had Olympic medallists, 

 world champions and world record-holders. No other game 

 can match the success achieved by Indian shooters, 

 Bindra said.

 We have a very talented 

 group of shooters at present. This is one sport in which 

 we are very strong. We always have the confidence that we 

 can win. The important thing is to keep going, he 

 said.

 The news on Bindras health 

 front is good. The doctor in Germany is convinced that the 

 shooters back pain is not bone-related and only a 

 muscular one. He has advised Bindra to undergo three months 

 of physiotherapy.

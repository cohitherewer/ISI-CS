New Delhi: Friends, former teammates, family members and a large number of fans bid a tearful adieu to former India captain V.P. Sathyan, who was cremated with full stage honours in his home town Tellicherry in Kannur district, Kerala, on Wednesday afternoon. 

Sathyan was run over by a train near Chennai on Tuesday morning (sources in Chennai have since confirmed his death was a case of suicide) and his body was brought to Tellicherry for last rites. 

Among those present were athletes P.T. Usha, Shiny Wilson, former India and Kerala teammates I.M. Vijayan, Jo Paul Ancheri, Chako, Papachan and Sharaf Ali. Senior officers from the home department were also present. 

While Shiny, Sathyans colleague in the Indian Bank, accompanied the body from Chennai, all others joined en route to Tellicherry. A highly popular figure during his playing days, fans poured in from all corners of Kerala to have a last look at their favourite footballer. 

Fans in Palakkad waited since morning for the procession to arrive and there was a huge outpour of emotion when it finally came. 

Thousands of people lined up on both sides of the road throughout the journey to pay their last respects to Sathyan, D.V. Sundar, sports secretary of the Indian Bank, said. 

In all the places like Palakkad, Malappuram and Kozhikode, people came out of their houses. They showered Sathyans body with flowers. 

Sathyan is survived by his mother, wife and daughter. 

A wreath, on behalf of the Kerala chief minister, Achuthanandan, was placed near the former footballers body.

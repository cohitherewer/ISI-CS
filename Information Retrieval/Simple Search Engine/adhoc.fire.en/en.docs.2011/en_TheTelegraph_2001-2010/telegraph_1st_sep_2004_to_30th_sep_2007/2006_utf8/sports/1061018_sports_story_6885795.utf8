The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, a cannabis case against Shoaib, Asif 

 - More trouble brewing for tainted duo 

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Karachi: As if the drugs scandal wasnt enough, Shoaib Akhtar and fellow-paceman Mohammed Asif may have more to contend with in the coming days. It is being alleged that the Pakistan duo had smoked cannabis during the recent ODI series in England. 

According to a leading daily, both Shoaib and Asif were seen smoking the stuff after Pakistans win in the third ODI at the Rose Bowl in Southampton, just days after the Oval Test controversy. 

Shoaib was seen allegedly smoking cannabis-filled cigarette on the lawn of the team hotel along with bowling coach Waqar Younis, the daily quoted an eye witness as saying. 

Asif, meanwhile, practised something similar in the privacy of his room, (where) he pulled out some of the tobacco from his cigarette to stuff it with the banned substance. He then lit up his cigarette.

The eye-witness, who had come to watch the matches from the United States and was at the hotel to meet players that day, said he saw England-based recruiting agent Azhar Mota passing on two small boxes, used for storing naswar, to the players. 

He also said Asif asked Azhar to fetch him a lucrative County deal. 

Azharbhai, I am interested in a contract worth 100,000 because only then I would be in a position to give you 10,000 (as commission), Asif was quoted as saying by the witness. 

The incident went unreported, unlike a similar case during the 1992-93 tour of the West Indies where Wasim Akram, Waqar, Mushtaq Ahmed and Aaqib Javed were detained and then released on bail for possessing marijuana.

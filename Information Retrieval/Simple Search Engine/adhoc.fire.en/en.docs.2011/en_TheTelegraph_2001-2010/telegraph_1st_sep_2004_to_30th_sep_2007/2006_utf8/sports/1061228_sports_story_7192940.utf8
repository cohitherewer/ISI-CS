The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourashish ensures lead

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: For cynics, Ranji matches are normally synonymous with boredom. At the Eden on Wednesday, it became evident during the Round IV Group B encounter between Bengal and Maharashtra in the Ranji Trophy Super League. 

With bowlers toeing a negative line, batsmen in no hurry at all and, of course, Jagmohan Dalmiyas resignation from the CAB taking centrestage off the field Day Threes match was just reduced to a formality, no sooner than Bengal edged past Maharashtras first innings total (215) early in the first session. 

At the end of Day Two on Tuesday, skipper Deep Dasgupta had said that the first session will be crucial for him and Rohan (Gavaskar). And on Wednesday, the duo did just that, gingerly getting past the target which will ensure them two points, unless of course theres a huge turnaround from Maharashtra, who ended the day with 78 for one with opener Dheeraj Jadhav (25) and former skipper Hrishikesh Kanitkar (25) looking vigilant. 

In fact, it was off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri who surpassed Deep on Day 3 to notch his third half-century in Ranji. 

Having persisted with their seamers without any breakthrough, skipper Sairaj Bahutule finally took the responsibility and went on to break the 82-run partnership (which incidentally was Bengals highest of the match) between Deep and Sourashish. 

With Sriram and Sairaj running through the tail, Bengal finished with 325 a first innings lead of 110 runs. 

Unless Bengal give early blows to the visitors on the morrow, another dull day of Ranji cricket will be on display on Thursday. 

Footnote: If Bengal get two points, they will be on a par with Hyderabad (eight points) after four matches. Punjab, meanwhile, are eyeing a first innings lead over Rajasthan at Jaipur, which means the fight for the last four berth could boil down to Bengal, Rajasthan and Hyderabad. Bengal, by the way, face a Hyderabad test in their away match (from January 2) before taking on Rajasthan at home (from January 10).

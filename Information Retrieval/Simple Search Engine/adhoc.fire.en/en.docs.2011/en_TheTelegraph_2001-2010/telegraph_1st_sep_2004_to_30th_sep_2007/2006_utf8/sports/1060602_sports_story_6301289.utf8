 Justine slips into Round 3

 - Baghdatis loses 5-setter; Paes-Damm out 

 Lleyton Hewitt 

Paris: An edgy Justine Henin-Hardenne beat the rain to slip through to the French Open third round with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over Belarussian Anastasiya Yakimova on Thursday. Mens seeds Lleyton Hewitt and Tommy Robredo also progressed but Australian Open runner-up Marcos Baghdatis lost in five sets on another wet day. 

 Playing on her 24th birthday, defending champion Henin-Hardenne was short of her best against 19-year-old Yakimova on centre court in a match played in steadily worsening weather. 

The fifth seed took the first set comfortably but lost control of the second and the match looked certain to go into a decider when Yakimova held three set-points at 5-4, 40-0. However, Henin-Hardenne saved all three, the last with an audacious drop shot that left Yakimova sprawling. The Belgian sealed victory two games later when Yakimova sent a wild forehand long as rain tumbled on to centre court. 

Baghdatis lost 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 7-6, 4-6 to Frances Julien Benneteau. The Cypriot, seeded 19, has suffered from injury and illness since losing to Roger Federer in Melbourne. He saved two match-points in the fourth set before forcing a fifth but Benneteau, ranked 95, proved the stronger in the decider. 

No. 14 seed Lleyton Hewitt saved a set-point before beating Frenchman Mathieu Montcourt 7-5, 6-3, 6-3. 

British involvement in singles ended when Russian Dmitry Tursunov, who had led by two sets overnight, completed a 6-3, 6-2, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Tim Henman. Croatian Mario Ancic and Chilean Paul Capdeville were fined $3,000 each for a spat at the end of their second-round match on Wednesday. Former champion Anastasia Myskina eased past Hungarys Melinda Czink 6-2, 6-4. 

In mens doubles, Leander Paes and Martin Damm crashed to a straight-set loss in the first round Thursday. The Indo-Czech pair lost 1-6, 6-7 (4-7) to Janko Tipsarevic and Mikhail Youzhny. 

In mixed doubles, Paes will be playing with young Russian Maria Kirilenko. Mahesh Bhupathi has rejoined forces with Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza has paired up with Paul Hanley.

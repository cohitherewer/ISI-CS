Durban: Ricky Ponting surpassed the great Don Bradman to boost Australia in their push for victory in the second Test against South Africa on Monday. 

South Africa, set a target of 410, were 29 for no wicket at close when bad light ended play early, 13 balls after tea on the fourth day. 

Australia had declared their second innings on 307 for four after Ponting added 116 to the 103 he made in the first innings. 

He now has 30 Test centuries to his credit, one more than Bradman, and is only the second man after Indias Sunil Gavaskar to score centuries in each innings of a Test three times. 

While Gavaskar first achieved the feat in 1970-71 and repeated the feat for the third time in 1978-79, all of Pontings twin century matches have come this season. 

Mondays ton was his fifth in his last eight innings against South Africa. 

Australia resumed on 125 for one and Matthew Hayden and Ponting took their second-wicket stand to 201 before they were separated in the eighth over after lunch. 

Later, Hayden hit out at repairs which were made to the pitch before the fourth days play. 

 Hayden said the Australians brought the repairs to the attention of the umpires at the start of play.

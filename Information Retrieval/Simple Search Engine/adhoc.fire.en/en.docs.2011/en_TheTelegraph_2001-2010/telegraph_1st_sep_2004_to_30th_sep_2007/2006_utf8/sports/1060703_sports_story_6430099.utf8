The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Parreira erred 

 in assessing France 

 Talking Tactics - 

 PK Banerjee

 France 

 played their best match in six years, Brazil didnt 

 pay heed to the danger signals emanating from their previous 

 game in Germany. The consequence was there for all to see 

 on Saturday night when Zinedine Zidane did with a football 

 what a magician would have done with his wand.

 Having given a hint of what he 

 is capable of in the game versus Spain, Zidane was at his 

 imperious best in the quarter final. It was as if he had 

 reserved this marquee show for Brazil. It was as if he wanted 

 to point a finger at Ronaldinho and say, this is how 

 the worlds best ought to play.

 Zidane worked his magic down the 

 left, middle and right. The ageing star used all his tricks, 

 vision and football sense to throw the opposition at sixes 

 and sevens.

 For all of Zidanes wizardry, 

 it wasnt a one-man show. Makelele had a fantastic 

 match, aborting Brazils intended build-ups just inside 

 the French half. The back-four was safe and secure, not 

 showing unnecessary bravado. Vieira once again put in an 

 untiring effort, Ribery added cutting edge to Zidanes 

 creations. Henry may not have dazzled like some others, 

 but he shone at crunch time and did what the country expected 

 him to.

 At times, Zidane and his mates 

 toyed with the Brazilians, who were reduced to a second-grade 

 outfit. Brazil, in fact, can consider themselves lucky not 

 to have lost by a bigger margin.

 So impotent were Brazil that Barthez 

 almost had a stroll in the park.

 Ronaldinho was a mega flop. He 

 got five games over three weeks to rediscover his game-making 

 and scoring touch, but alas, we never got to see the two-time 

 worlds best player, not even in half bloom.

 We kept on thinking he would step 

 on the accelerator in the next game, and he kept on playing 

 safe, bland football. I dont remember Ronaldinho advancing 

 to the rival six-yard box even once in five games.

 I wish Parreira had benched the 

 hopelessly-out-of-form Ronaldinho. And if he couldnt 

 muster that courage, the coach should have definitely left 

 out Roberto Carlos and Cafu, and played young side-backs 

 Gilberto and Cicinho. Cafu was too slow, Carlos was not 

 there mentally. 

 Parreira also erred in assessing 

 the opposition. He didnt expect Zidane and this French 

 team to turn the clock back eight years. The France versus 

 Spain match should have served as a warning bell. The Brazil 

 coach should also have taken lessons from the none-too-convincing 

 performance against Ghana. 

 In a nutshell, Parreira paid the 

 price for keeping faith on three-four established players 

 who were just not in sync with the rest of the team.

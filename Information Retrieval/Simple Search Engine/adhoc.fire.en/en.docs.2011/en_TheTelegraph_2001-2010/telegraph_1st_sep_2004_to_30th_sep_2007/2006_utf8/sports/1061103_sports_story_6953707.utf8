 Pak hope Shabbir will clear tests

Karachi: Pakistan will try to resurrect the career of banned pacer Shabbir Ahmed following the doping bans imposed on Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif, an official said on Thursday. 

Shabbir has been serving a 12-month ban from the International Cricket Council (ICC) since last December for having an illegal bowling action. 

Obviously when you lose two key bowlers like Shoaib and Asif it does affect the team, Saleem Altaf, director of cricket operations said. Which is why we will be sending Shabbir to Australia on November 20 for biomechanic tests on his bowling action. 

Shabbir has been reported three times for his action, which can be reviewed again once the ban ends next month, Altaf added. 

Shabbir has 51 wickets from 10 Tests, and grabbed 18 wickets in his last three Tests against England and West Indies before being banned. 

We have done a lot of work on Shabbirs action this year and there is definite improvement. Hopefully he will also clear the biomechanical tests under the supervision of experts in Australia, Altaf said. 

If he is available with a modified action for the tour of South Africa and the World Cup, it would be a big boost for the team. (Reuters)

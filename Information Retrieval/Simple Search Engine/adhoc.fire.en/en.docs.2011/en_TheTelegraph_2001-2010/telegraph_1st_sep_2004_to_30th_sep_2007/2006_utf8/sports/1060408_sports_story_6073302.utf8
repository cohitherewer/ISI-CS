Frankfurt: Coach Juergen Klinsmann has named Jens Lehmann as Germanys first choice goalkeeper for the 2006 World Cup ahead of former captain Oliver Kahn. 

Kahn, who was extremely disappointed by the decision, says he will now chew over whether to retire. 

Klinsmann decided to pick Arsenals Lehmann ahead of Bayern Munichs more experienced Kahn after a meeting with his coaching team on Friday. 

It was the hardest decision of my time as coach, Klinsmann said in a statement released by the German football association. 

Both Germanys senior goalkeepers are 36. Kahn has played 84 times for the World Cup hosts, while Lehmann has won 29 caps. 

Kahn captained Germany to the final of the last World Cup in South Korea and Japan, and was named Player of the 2002 tournament. 

Im very surprised and extremely disappointed, Kahn said in a statement on the website of champions Bayern. 

In the coming weeks Ill concentrate on my work with Bayern in the Bundesliga and German Cup. As to my future in the national team, Ill think it over in the coming weeks and comment in due course.

San Jose: John McEnroe capped his comeback to the ATP Tour with a surprise doubles victory in the SAP Open final on Sunday, the veteran partnering Swede Jonas Bjorkman to a 7-6, 4-6, 10-7 win over Paul Goldstein and Jim Thomas. 

Appearing in his first ATP tournament since 1994, the 47-year-old American displayed plenty of the trademark deft touches that once made him the number one player in the world. 

I didnt know what was going to happen, but I felt good that first day, so I thought we had a chance, McEnroe said. The key to success is working together with your partner and picking a good partner and I did that. We pumped each other up. 

They beat the first and third seeds and we beat the second and fourth, so we knew it was coming down to the end. Not surprisingly it went to the final tie-break, but the right team won. 

McEnroes 78th doubles title came 14 seasons after his last, won with brother Patrick at the Paris Indoors in November 1992. 

While McEnroe sports a full head of grey hair and has slowed his pace around the court, the seven-time Grand Slam champion stood firm against the weight of his opponents heavy shots. 

Im not surprised, Bjorkman said. Hes so smart. He plays with his head. What really impressed me was how he managed to take the power of the younger guys so well. 

Its always tough to come through and win a title like this, but weve playing great from the start. 

Although he has a busy schedule of television broadcasting and senior events this year, McEnroe did not rule out playing another ATP tournament. Maybe I can find some of the younger American guys to play with, he said. 

Ive got to enjoy this for a little bit, so Im going to take a few months off and then go back to where I belong on the Seniors tour and then enjoy this (win) and let them think about (this win) for a little while and well see what develops. 

Meanwhile, Britains Andrew Murray battled from a set down to stun Australian third seed Lleyton Hewitt 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 in the singles final to register a first victory on the ATP Tour. 

In by far the biggest victory of his career, the steely 18-year-old Scot played a smart, ambitious contest, dictating much of the match with blistering returns and steady play from the backcourt. 

This is perfect, Murray said after winning an event where he defeated former Grand Slam winners Andy Roddick and Hewitt en route to the title. I played solid all week. Its been the best week of my life. 

After making a slow start, Murray appeared on course for a mauling as the Australian pushed the error-prone teenager all over the court to cruise through the opening set. 

However, the Britons never-say-die attitude paid dividends in the second set as he raised his game up a notch to level the match and take control of the contest. 

Adeptly picking off Hewitts serves, Murray found his rhythm from the service line and only attacked at opportune moments. He broke Hewitt three times in the second set and so frustrated the 24-year-old Australian that Hewitt double-faulted on set point. 

Murray carried the momentum into the third set and broke Hewitt to lead 2-0 with brilliant backhand winner. 

Unbowed, Hewitt broke back immediately and the 2002 champion repeated the feat at 4-2 after Murray had forged ahead with a second break of serve. 

The Briton continued to press and was denied victory in the 10th and 12th games of the deciding set when Hewitt blasted an ace when facing match point each time. 

Murray, however, was undaunted by the setbacks. Ive been working on not showing too much emotion because against the top guys, they give you so little and can come back from any position, he said. 

Serving at 5-3 in the tiebreak, Murray blasted a 126 mph service winner before sealing the contest with a sublime crosscourt backhand. 

On sealing victory, the world No. 60 yelled out, pumped his fist and wrapped himself in a British flag given to him by a fan. (Reuters)

 Aura fancied in Bangalore

SRIMAX

 Srinath 

 Bangalore:Sriram Komandur-trained 

 Aura is expected to make amends and win the Sandur Cup here 

 on Thursday. Aura, who despite a long lay-off had decimated 

 the opposition in her first start this season, had failed 

 in the higher class as a favourite when she found Royal 

 Assault too good to tackle. However, she has been blazing 

 the tracks now and in the hands of jockey Y.Srinath, she 

 may contain the challenge of Smart N Unique at the finish. 

 Last start easy winner Hawaiian Sunrise can fill in the 

 frame.

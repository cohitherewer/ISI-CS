 Deepan keeps sole lead

Visakhapatnam: Grandmaster Koneru Humpy suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Diwakar Prasad Singh in the 13th round of the 43rd National A Chess Championships here on Thursday. 

With seven rounds still to go in the 21-player event, former Asian junior champion Deepan Chakravarthy maintained his sole lead with a hard fought draw with Arghyadip Das. Chakravarthy took his tally to 10.5 points, and is now trailed by defending champion GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly, who is just half a point behind. Humpy and Singh are next in line on 9.5 points, while M. R. Venkatesh is on their toes on nine points for his fifth spot. 

Former national champion GM Abhijit Kuntes turnaround continued as he nailed B. S. Shivanandan to reach 8.5 points and right behind him is GM Sandipan Chanda, who is on 8 points. 

It seems that the race for the title will be between Surya Sekhar and Chakravarthy, and the former might have an edge as he has an extra game up his sleeves with Chakravarthys bye slated in round 18. 

The fight for the third place is getting closer with each passing round and all five ? Kunte, Sandipan, Singh, Humpy and Venkatesh ? can clinch that spot which will also ensure a ticket to the next Chess Olympiad in Turin. 

However, there were no upsets in the womens championship. WGM Swati Ghate continued her dream run and crushed Maji Supriya in the 13th round to remain in sole lead with 9.5 points. 

Mary Ann Gomes made sure she remained on the heels of Ghate with a superlative effort against Nimmy George of Kerala and took her tally to 9 points. 

Behind them are top seed S. Vijayalkashmi and her younger sister WGM S. Meenakshi on 8.5 points, while WGM D. Harika and defending champion Nisha Mohota are also in contention for top honours with 8 and 7.5 points, respectively. 

Singh was in a way lucky to beat Humpy who had a good position. (PTI)

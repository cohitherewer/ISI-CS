 Saptarshi, Roktim win

Ahmedabad: Saptarshi Roy and Roktim Bandopadhyay registered victories in the 44th National B Chess Championship here on Friday. While Saptarshi beat Milind Gaude, Roktim outwitted A.K. Verma. 

The start of play on Day I got delayed by over two hours because of some players late registration. Once the meet got underway in the evening, IM Varugeese Koshy scored a quick victory over K. Pajat. 

Former India team member Koshy had it easy with white pieces against Pajat who played the English opening with great success. Koshy won in 47 moves. 

IM S. Poobesh Anand also carved out a quick victory, accounting for Shrikrishna in a one-sided affair. 

World U-10 champion Sahaj Grover of Delhi went down fighting to N. Sudhakar Babu, while V. Saravanan defeated Chinmoy.

 Diego back to reinvent myth

 - He is passionate about Boca and still desperate to win a game of football 

 Niall Sloane

The first thing you have to say is that the worlds greatest footballer is in remarkably good physical condition. From cocaine addiction and the brink of death to running the show in a Masters tournament game against Brazil, the transformation of Diego Armando Maradona is little short of staggering. 

When I travelled to Buenos Aires with Gary Lineker and a television crew, we werent sure what we were going to get. Yes, we had seen the pictures of a much slimmer man and the surprising shots on the Argentinian version of Strictly Come Dancing. We had been told about the huge success of his chat show. 

But despite being armed with a contract our initial question was, will he turn up? Well, yes he did. And the man who committed the games most infamous act of cheating delivered: he was welcoming and charming, reflective in a way we hadnt expected, passionate about his beloved Boca Juniors and still desperate to win a game of football. 

We came home to questions about why we would want to interview him. Moral ambivalence? My personal view is that he was the most extravagantly skilled footballer ever. Does that forgive the cheating and the subsequent chaotic private life? Many professional sportsmen bend the rules and a lot dont live like saints. The Azteca Stadium, 1986, and the subsequent claims of divine intervention were the starkest examples. His is a compelling human tale and that is the core of the film. 

As we arrived in Buenos Aires on Friday, the circus started. We had been told that the main interview would take place on Sunday. Checking into our hotel, we were warned we might have to set off immediately to do it. Half an hour of phone calls to his former wife, Claudia, and we were told it was back on track for Sunday. Claudia and Diego divorced three years ago, but she is clearly a central figure. 

So we started to prepare for the first shoot. Argentina vs Brazil at Masters football. Masters football can often be a group of forty-somethings plodding around for a few beer tokens. This was something else. They ripped into each other from the off. It was a battle, loaded with great skill and an Argentinian comeback from three goals down to draw 7-7. 

As he blew for full time, the referee signalled for five minutes of extra time. Maradona, who had run the game for Argentina, then told the referee that he was, indeed, running the event and that it should all stop there. Honours even, he was man of the match and Dunga, who earlier had tried to provide some further weight loss by removing his legs, looked on adoringly. 

And that is roughly the point. Pele, Cruyff, Platini, Best, Beckenbauer. All the great players are liked, respected or loved in their own countries. But in Argentina it is different. The elevation of Maradona approaches that accorded to the Perons 50 years ago. 

On Sunday I got to go to church. Well, join one actually. From holy orders we moved on to Maradonas mums house for Sunday lunch. 

Diego gave Gary a terrific interview, conducted in Spanish, covering the football, the cocaine, the recovery and ducking no aspects of his life. He spoke of tournaments, championships, Burruchaga and Butcher, Reid and Rooney. He thinks England stand a chance in June. The respect between the two former opponents was transparent. What also shone through was Maradonas love for Dalma and Giannina ? the daughters he contends saved his life and who give him purpose. 

Then it was off in the Maradona family car to see Boca play Quilmes. River Plate and Independiente had drawn earlier and victory would take the blue-and-yellows top. They duly delivered with a 3-1 win and some of the films outstanding moments. 

Maradona is as failed a human being as the rest of us. But only he has played like a God and spoken of His compliance. There is no attempt to condone some aspects of his life. But when you see the exuberance of this small frame compared to the bloated wreck who was almost called home, most should feel only joy.

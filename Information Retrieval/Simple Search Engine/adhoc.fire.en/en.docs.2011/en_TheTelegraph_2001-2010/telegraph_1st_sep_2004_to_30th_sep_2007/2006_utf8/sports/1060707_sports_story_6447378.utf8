 Vaughan out, confirms ECB

 - ASHES TOUR 

London: England captain Michael Vaughan has been ruled out of the Ashes tour of Australia after a fourth operation on his right knee, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed Thursday. 

The Yorkshire batsman went under the knife on Monday still clinging to the hope that he could be fit in time to lead England on the tour, which begins in November. 

But according to a radio channel, the surgery revealed more extensive damage to the joint than expected, a development which will intensify fears that Vaughans career could effectively be over. 

Later, an ECB spokesman said: I can confirm that Michael will miss the Ashes tour. 

Vaughan has not played for England since being forced to return home early from the tour of India in March. 

He attempted a comeback for Yorkshire last month but the injury flared up again and he was advised that further surgery was necessary.

 United keep Chelsea waiting

London: Chelsea swaggered to a 3-0 victory over 10-man Everton on Monday but were denied the chance to celebrate a second consecutive Premier League title by Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney. 

Chelsea now only need one point from their remaining three league games to pop the champagne, having restored a nine-point lead at the top with three games left to play. 

Ivory Coast forward Didier Drogba scored one and made another for Frank Lampard before Michael Essien thundered home Chelseas third at Stamford Bridge. Lee Carsley was dismissed for Everton two minutes after the re-start with Chelsea 1-0 up. 

Jose Mourinhos men had known before kickoff the title would not be theirs on the day after Rooneys brace had earlier given United a 2-1 victory at Tottenham Hotspur. 

Still firmly on course for the title, Chelsea have 88 points from 35 games, with United lying second on 79 points and Liverpool third on 73. 

With an FA Cup semi-final looming against Liverpool on Saturday, Chelseas next chance of winning the league will be a much-awaited showdown against United at Stamford Bridge on April 29. 

Down at the other end of the table, Portsmouths fine run ended on Monday with a 1-2 defeat at Charlton Athletic that will revive fears of relegation. 

Middlesbrough beat West Ham United 2-0 while Newcastle United came from behind to beat relegated Sunderland 4-1 in the northeast derby. 

Manchester Uniteds victory failed to dent Mourinhos optimism about the title. 

It is not easy for us to lose the three matches, it is not easy for Manchester United to win the three matches and it is not easy for them to turn around the goal difference (of 12). 

But football is football, you never know, he said. We need a minimum of one point to celebrate. 

Asked about the title race, United manager Alex Ferguson told MUTV: If we can win at Stamford Bridge you never know. It keeps our fans interested and everyone at the club motivated. 

Sometimes complacency and relaxation can creep in at this stage of the season, but the result against Spurs will keep us going. 

Fifth-placed Arsenal, who have a game in hand and trail Spurs with 57 points to 61, will host Tottenham at Highbury on Saturday in what should be a thrilling derby.

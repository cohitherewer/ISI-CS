The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nabis participation raises eyebrows 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Syed Rahim Nabis name in East Bengals starting line-up against George Telegraph raised a few eyebrows on Wednesday. 

He is one of the four players staring at punishment from the IFA disciplinary committee following disputes over their status as players. The IFA body is expected to announce verdict on M. Suresh, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, Mukhtar Ahmed and Nabi on next Tuesday. 

So how was Nabi allowed to play despite the fact that his case was heard by the IFA Players Status Committee and is pending? 

According to a senior IFA official, Nabis case is different from the rest. 

Though he had admitted to taking money from Mohammedan Sporting, he has signed for East Bengal. But in case of the others, its still not decided which club they will play for. They havent signed for anybody. This is why, as long as the verdict on Nabis case is not announced, he can play, the official said. 

Suresh, Malsawmtluanga and Mukhtar have been practising with Mohammedan Sporting, but didnt feature in the sides opening match against Railway FC in the CFL Premier Division on Tuesday. 

In another development, Mohun Bagan have to seek IRTC from Bangladesh for recruiting Guy Herve Ndem. As his term with East Bengal is over, Ndem has now become a foreigner playing in Bangladesh. 

Unless Mohun Bagan attain his IRTC from Bangladesh, he cant play for them, said an IFA official.

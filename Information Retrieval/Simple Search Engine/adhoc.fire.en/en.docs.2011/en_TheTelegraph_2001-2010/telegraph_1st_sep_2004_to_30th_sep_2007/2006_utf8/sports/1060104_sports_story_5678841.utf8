 Astle leads NZ to series win

Wellington: Nathan Astle produced a timely return to form with an unbeaten 90 to anchor New Zealand to 256 for five for an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five match one-day series against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. 

Chasing 255 for seven in the third match at Christchurch, Astle held the innings together while Lou Vincent smashed 46 off 44 balls to give New Zealand run chase momentum at the top of the order. 

Upul Tharanga scored his second one-day International century for Sri Lanka and combined with Kumar Sangakara (36) in a 109-run second-wicket partnership.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dravid, Yuvraj, Pathan in contention

 - Dhoni overlooked 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: Indian captain Rahul Dravid, the ICC Player of the Year in 2004, has once again been nominated in four categories on the list of nominees for the Hyundai ICC awards which was declared in the capital on Wednesday. Speaking on the occasion, the ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said the final list of awardees will be announced in Mumbai on October 23. 

While Dravids name has found place on both the ODI and Test Player of the Year lists, he also remains a common choice on the list of Cricketer of the Year and Captain of the Year nominees. 

Speed said the ICC this year has introduced two new awards Captain of the Year and Womens Cricketer of the Year. 

Apart from Dravid, Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh remain the only other Indians to get the nod of the selection committee for nominations. Both have been included on the list of 17 players picked up for the ODI Player of the Year award. 

Two Indian women cricketers, however, are among the seven probables, who are tipped to receive the Cricketer of the Year award. Anjum Chopra with an average of 47 in 19 one-dayers and Neetu David with 25 wickets have really done well at the womens front, Speed said. 

 Asked why Mahender Singh Dhonis name wasnt 

 on the list of ODI players, Speed said the selection committee 

 would be in a better position to explain the omission. None 

 of the selectors chairman Sunil Gavaskar, Allan Donald, 

 Ian Healy, Arjuna Ranatunga and Waqar Younis were present 

 on the occasion.

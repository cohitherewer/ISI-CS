 Indian eves go down

Madrid: Indian eves paid the penalty for their lethargic start as six-time champions Holland sneaked home 3-2 in the opening match of the womens World Cup hockey here on Wednesday. 

Holland caught their rivals napping, pumping in two goals in the first half and then another early in the second half before the Indians woke up. Surinder Kaur scored a brace to narrow the margin but by then the damage had been done. 

Maartje Paumen opened the scoring for Holland in the third minute. (PTI)

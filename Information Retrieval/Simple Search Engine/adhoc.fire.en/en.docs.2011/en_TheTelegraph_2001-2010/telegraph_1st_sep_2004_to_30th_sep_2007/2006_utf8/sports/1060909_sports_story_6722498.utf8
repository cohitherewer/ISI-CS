 3 Aussie spots under scrutiny

Sydney: Three positions in the Australian team will be under World Cup selection scrutiny in the tri-series in Malaysia, coach John Buchanan said on Friday. 

Buchanan said selectors will be looking at an opening batting position along with the spinner and third seamers roles in the two-week tournament in Kuala Lumpur. 

Simon Katich, Brad Hogg and Nathan Bracken all limited-overs regulars since the 2005 Ashes tour to England will get their chances in the lead-in tournament to Champions Trophy in India.

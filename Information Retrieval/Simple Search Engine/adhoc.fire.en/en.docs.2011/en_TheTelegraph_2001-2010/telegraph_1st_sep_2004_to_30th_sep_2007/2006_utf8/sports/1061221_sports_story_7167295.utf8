 VRV: Im quite serious about batting

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Durban: Vikram Rajvir Singh picked up just one wicket at the Wanderers, but nobody is ever going to forget his entertaining (and very crucial) 29 off 19 balls in the first innings. Indeed, but for his last-wicket partnership with Sourav Ganguly, the Indians wouldnt have got to 249. 

I batted the way I know... I didnt try to do anything special, Singh told The Telegraph. 

He added: At nets, I try to bat for as long as possible... Im quite serious about my batting... If the ball is there to be hit, Ill do so...

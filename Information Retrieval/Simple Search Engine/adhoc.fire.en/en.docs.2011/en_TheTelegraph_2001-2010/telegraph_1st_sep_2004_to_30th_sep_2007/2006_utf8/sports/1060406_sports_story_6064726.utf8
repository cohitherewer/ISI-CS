 Sanath made the right decision: Mahanama

Kochi: In one-time teammate Roshan Mahanamas opinion, Sanath Jayasuriya made the right decision by quitting Test cricket to focus exclusively on the one-day game. 

On his first assignment to India as Match Referee, Mahanama told The Telegraph on Wednesday evening: Now, Sanath will be able to prolong his one-day career... Till the (2007) World Cup if not even beyond that... Had he continued in both forms, injuries could have completely ended his cricket... 

A former one-day captain, Mahanama added: Its always difficult determining when to leave, but Sanath made the right decision... Remember, hes 36... If he stays fit, Sri Lanka is bound to benefit in the World Cup... You cant, after all, argue with his record... 

Both Mahanama and Jayasuriya were in the XI which won the 1996 World Cup. Even if Sanath doesnt play any more, history is going to remember him and Romesh Kaluwitharana for changing everybodys approach to the early overs... 

Mahanama, whose last Sri Lanka appearance was during the 1999 World Cup, met Jayasuriya (a former captain both in Tests and ODIs) just a couple of days before coming to India. Their interaction took place during the 10th anniversary celebrations of the World Cup success. 

It was great catching up with the rest of the team, Mahanama said.

 Indians in a dilemma over changing winning XI

 - Weve got to handle Munaf carefully: Chappell 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: The Indians, it appears, are in a dilemma over whether to retain the winning XI or effect a change at the very top of the order. 

Its a tough call as Wasim Jaffer hasnt been getting runs... In fact, Virender Sehwag hasnt done much either... At the same time, there are some whore arguing that the winning combination must not be disturbed, somebody connected with the selection process on tour told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Wednesday, the gentleman added: Theres also the issue of Munaf Patel... If he does well in the two-day game here, then he has to come into the reckoning... In that case Vikram Rajvir Singh may have to sit out... Then, again, changing the winning XI is going to come up... 

Coach Greg Chappell, however, is clear about not risking Munaf (who hasnt played for almost a month owing to an ankle injury). Weve got to handle him carefully as hes an important member of this group... Lets see how he shapes up in match-conditions, but I wont be looking only at short-term benefits, is what hed said in Johannesburg. 

The two-dayer (from Friday) is against a KwaZulu-Natal Invitation XI comprising some first-class cricketers and will be held at the Crusaders Club. The local outfit is going to be captained by Rivash Gobind. 

For obvious reasons, it will be important for opener Gautam Gambhir, who has just been having nets outdoors and indoors since arriving over a fortnight ago. 

Except for a run on the beach (which is metres away from the team hotel) and volleyball there itself, Wednesday was a day off cricket.

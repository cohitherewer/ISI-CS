 Chopra hits unbeaten century 

Jaipur: Solid half-centuries by captain Anirudh Singh and Ambati Rayudu helped Hyderabad reach 246 for 5 against Rajasthan on the first day of their Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here. 

Anirudh smashed 87 and Rayudu hit 62 on a docile wicket after Hyderabad won the toss and chose to bat. The duo also put on a partnership of 110 runs. 

In New Delhi, Aakash Chopra hit an unbeaten century but it was defending champions Uttar Pradesh who returned with the opening days honours. 

Chopra, ignored in favour of Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir in the Test squad for the South Africa tour, made a well paced unbeaten 128 but Delhi lost two wickets in three balls in the extended 20 minutes of the final session to be 257 for six to concede some ground.

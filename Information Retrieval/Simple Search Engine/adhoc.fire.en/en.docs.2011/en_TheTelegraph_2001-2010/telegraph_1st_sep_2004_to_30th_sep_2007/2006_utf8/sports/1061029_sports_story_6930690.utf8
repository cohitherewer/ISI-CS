The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Double blow puts Indians in a fix

 - Dilemma over who fills in for Agarkar 

 - Mongia to take Yuvrajs place 

 LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI 

 Sachin Tendulkar in Mohali on Saturday 

Chandigarh: Before leaving for the match-eve nets in neighbouring Mohali, Saturday morning, the talismanic Sachin Tendulkar told a well-wisher Im hoping to be busy till November 5... That, incidentally, is the Champions Trophy final date. 

Not much later, Indias hopes of getting there took a mighty hit when Yuvraj Singh twisted his left knee in a warm-up session for the quarter final against the No.1 team, Australia. A day earlier, a fractured left thumb took Ajit Agarkar out of the tournament. 

If that was bad enough, Yuvrajs non-availability has made it worse. The Indians have been struggling and both Agarkar and Yuvraj had the potential to ignite the spark that just hasnt been there. Their absence means opportunities for others, but the thinktank is in somewhat of a fix. 

The double blow, by all accounts, has proved a bit too much. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, till late in the evening, captain Rahul Dravid and coach Greg Chappell (in particular) couldnt make up their mind on whether Agarkars berth should go to replacement Sreesanth or Mohammed Kaif. 

The UP captain will get the nod if theres a consensus on strengthening the batting. Otherwise, Sreesanth (who arrived from Kochi via Bangalore and New Delhi) is going to make a comeback. I know the circumstances are unusual, but Im here by Gods grace and because of the good wishes of so many, he pointed out. 

Yuvrajs slot is certain to be taken by another Chandigarh da puttar, Dinesh Mongia. In fact, he has been the Punjab captain and, so, the PCA Stadium in Mohali is his home ground. The match, by the way, will be played on the wicket which hosted New-Zealand Pakistan a few days ago. That surface produced big runs, unlike Fridays wicket (South Africa versus Pakistan). 

The basic nature wont change... The surface is bouncy... Weve got to play good cricket... We need to win the key moments, do well in the critical stages... The guys have to stand up and be counted, observed Dravid, who appears to be feeling the heat fuelled by lacklustre performances. 

He added: History shows that performances have won matches... The pressure is there, but weve got to create opportunities... It has to be enjoyed, not seen as a burden... Its an opportunity to succeed, not fail... Its the time to stamp authority and be remembered... Batting has been a problem, but if we go back to averaging what we did ten matches ago, then a lot of questions are going to be answered... 

Dravid didnt seem impressed by the raging debate over Irfan Pathan getting the No.3 position and declined to specifically speak about deputy Virender Sehwags failures (we can do better as a batting unit). Clearly, its a cosy club and opinions dont have to be given credence. 

The question is: Is that the way forward? 

Its not insignificant, perhaps, that the Indians have won only once (back in January 2004) in the last ten completed matches against Australia. Just over a month ago, we needed to beat them in order to make the tri-series final in Kuala Lumpur, but the Australians were much too strong. 

Its a huge ask, really. 

The pressure is on India and the wicket will probably suit us more... I know weve never won the Champions Trophy and are desperate to do so this time... is what Australian captain Ricky Ponting said. He acknowledged hed been short on runs, but emphasised hed worked hard over the past week. 

Australias only worry (on the fitness front) is over Michael Clarke. Hes down with tonsillitis and may be replaced by Simon Katich. 

Both teams have beaten England; both have lost to holders West Indies. The face-off is going to bring the curtain down on the league phase. A full house is expected for (potentially) the most throbbing match of the tournament.

 DRAVID ON THE MOTERA DRESSING-DOWN 

Team India captain Rahul Dravid had something to say, Saturday, about the very public dressing-down given by coach Greg Chappell to the players on the eve of the last match (against the West Indies), in Motera... 

Here goes: 

It happens in sports... You say things which are taken out of context... It was a very private conversation which was heard and used out of context... People eavesdropped and used it (in the Media)... I wouldnt do it... Without understanding, a lot of things get assumed... Its (a sign of) the times we live in... Such conversations keep happening...

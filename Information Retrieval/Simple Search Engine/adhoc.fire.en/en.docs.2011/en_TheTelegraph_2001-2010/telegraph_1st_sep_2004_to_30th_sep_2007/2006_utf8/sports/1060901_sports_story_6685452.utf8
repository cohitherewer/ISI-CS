 Jhulan (5/33) forces England to follow on

London: England women, after being asked to follow on, were on the path of recovery to save the second Test against India on the third day of the match in Taunton on Thursday. 

Skipper Charlotte Edwards led the fightback in the second innings with a brilliant unbeaten knock of 100 to take the home team to 205 for two at stumps. Caroline Atkins (68 batting) was holding fort at the other end. 

With three sessions of play remaining, England need three more runs to make India bat again. 

After being bundled out only for 99, England lost two wickets for 34 in the second innings. But, Edwards led from the front to revive some hope for the hosts. 

Seamer Jhulan Goswami, who claimed five wickets in the first innings, took one more in the second. 

Charlotte was the top-scorer for the home side in the first innings with a defiant 26 off 54 balls. 

Brief scores 

India 307. England 99 (Jhulan Goswami 5/33) amp; 205/2 (Charlotte Edwards 100 batting, Caroline Atkins 68 batting; Jhulan Goswami 1/26).

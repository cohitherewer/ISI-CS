 India slip 

8 places

New Delhi: The two successive defeats against Asian powerhouse Saudi Arabia have hit Indian football hard as it fell eight spots to joint 136th in the latest Fifa world rankings. 

The overall rankings are still led by Brazil but the big gainer is France, who after a strong beginning to their Euro 2008 qualification campaign, have climbed two places to No. 2. 

They also gained a 3-1 revenge victory over Italy for their World Cup final defeat in a penalty shootout. Argentina are ranked third. (PTI)

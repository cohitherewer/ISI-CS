The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Australians allow their players to express themselves: Butt

 - The Peshawar MoM talks of the pressure he faced at the Eden 15 months ago and more... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Salman Butt

 Each of Salman Butts three ODI hundreds has 

 been against India, with Pakistan winning all three ? the 

 last, of course, being in Peshawar on Monday. But for an 

 important 53 in the second innings in Karachi, the 21-year-old 

 opener had a disappointing Test series, yet the 101 at the 

 Niaz Arbab Stadium has given the perfect launch for the 

 remaining four ODIs. Butt, who got engaged to Maria Rahim 

 last month, is rather shy. Hes clear about his goals, 

 though, and that came through during a one-on-one with The 

 Telegraph

 The following 

 are excerpts

 On his beginnings as a cricketer

 Started young, like most in this 

 part of the world... It didnt take long for cricket 

 to become a passion... Actually, I started playing in our 

 Lahore house... Inside, in the garage... (Adds laughing) 

 I must have broken dozens of lights and cracked quite a 

 few mirrors!

 On whether he was always 

 an opener

 Absolutely... Be it playing in 

 the house or out on the street.

 On his family

 Nobody in the immediate family 

 played cricket... My father (Zulfiqar Ali) is the project 

 manager in a construction company and mother Sofia is a 

 housewife. I have two sisters, one being elder to me...

 On his inspiration

 I followed Saeed Anwar and Aamer 

 Sohail... Later, I began to admire Matthew Hayden... However, 

 Imran Khan has been my role model... He was a complete cricketer... 

 Batted, bowled and captained with distinction... More than 

 that, Imranbhai had the killer-instinct and remains 

 among the most positive of individuals... I liked Wasim 

 Akrams positive approach, too.

 On interacting with Imran

 Mostly at Shapes (the hi-tech 

 gym in Lahore)... Im a regular there and Imranbhai 

 turns up whenever hes in Lahore... I remember bumping 

 into him on the eve of our tour to India last year and his 

 advice was simple: Stay at the wicket and build your 

 innings... Merely talking to him lifts the confidence...

 On whether he interacted 

 with Hayden on the 2004-05 tour of Australia

 I did, after I got a hundred in 

 the Sydney Test... He said I didnt need much advice 

 and added that the new ball has to be played with a straight 

 bat... I try and remember that... (After a pause) 

 Justin Langer was also around in the dressing room and even 

 he gave some tips ? for example, that I should never compromise 

 on focusing.

 On being captained by Inzamam-ul 

 Haq, one of the greats of the modern era

 Of course, Inzybhai is 

 always there... Hes not only a pillar of strength 

 for the team, but a huge source of inspiration...

 On the pressure as he took 

 guard versus India for the first time, in the Platinum Jubilee 

 ODI at the Eden (November 2004)

 Id played a couple of times 

 at the U-19 and U-17 level, but those outings were sans 

 the pressure I faced at the Eden... I recall fielding on 

 the boundary and a section of the crowd kept asking me to 

 look back. When I did, somebody taunted why are you 

 looking back? Dont you know the population of your 

 country will fit into this stadium? It was quite an 

 experience, believe me.

 On emerging the MoM by scoring 

 an unbeaten 108

 I think that match was a day after 

 Diwali and a day before Eid... It was, therefore, more than 

 a Platinum Jubilee ODI... Inzybhais words in 

 the lead-up ? expect no support and look to beat the 

 100,000 crowd as well ? had been motivating. Basically, 

 that there couldnt be a bigger achievement and no 

 bigger moment to make headlines. But for that effort, I 

 probably wouldnt have been picked for Australia.

 On the trip to Australia

 It was a dream to do well as the 

 wickets there are most challenging... I got a Test hundred, 

 but could have done better... What I learnt most is that 

 youve got to be aggressive if you want to beat the 

 champions... If you give them even the hint of an opening, 

 theyre going to get through. Even if theyre 

 five down for 50, the No. 7 can come and set things right. 

 Thats Australia... Whats remarkable is that 

 they allow their players to express themselves and the benefit 

 is collective.

 On playing against India 

 and Australia

 If you keep the emotional content 

 on one side, then doing well versus Australia gives the 

 most satisfaction... Because of the passion associated with 

 India, though, one makes a bigger name by doing well... 

 The pressure, obviously, is more in an Indo-Pak fixture.

 On failing in the solitary 

 Test (Mohali) he played in on the tour of India, but scoring 

 101 in the Jamshedpur ODI

 I ought to have capitalised on 

 the chance in that first Test... The Jamshedpur innings 

 was important as it helped establish me in the one-day XI... 

 I would work very hard and didnt want to see myself 

 as a batsman with limited ability... That 101 will stay 

 as a landmark.

 On excelling against England 

 earlier in this season

 Lets say it was a turning 

 point in my career ? I got one hundred (122 in Multan) and 

 two fifties in five Test innings and had good contributions 

 in the first two ODIs... I grew as a cricketer in what was 

 a big series for everybody.

 On hobbies

 I follow other sport, but if theres 

 time, I like spending it either with the family or friends... 

 We go out to the malls... Eat out as well...

 On being fond of squash

 It improves footwork and sharpens 

 the hand-eye coordination... Sadly, nowadays, I dont 

 get much time... Earlier, at Shapes, I would warm up with 

 squash.

 On his fiancee being a top-ranked 

 tennis player

 (Grins) Look, I wouldnt 

 like to speak about her... Were conservative and it 

 may not look good...

 On whether hes superstitious

 Not at all... Whatever happens 

 is with the blessings of Allah... Wearing a particular pair 

 of gloves or carrying a certain bat cant guarantee 

 a hundred!

 On Imran and Rameez Raja 

 seeing him as a future Pakistan captain

 Its flattering... Ive 

 captained at the U-19 and U-17 levels, but... If I do become 

 the Pakistan captain with the blessings of Allah, Im 

 confident the demands wont affect my batting... Whatever 

 the level, Ive never felt burdened whenever Ive 

 been the captain. Im my own man and, if the top job 

 comes my way, Im going to captain my way.

 Finally, his approach to 

 cricket

 Theres no point crying over 

 whats past... A chance lost is a chance lost, but 

 theres always a next time... Ive been brought 

 up to believe whatever happens is for the good only.

 Narain sets scorching pace

New Delhi: Narain Karthikeyan set a scorching pace on the first of four-day testing for Williams at the Catalunya circuit in Spain. 

According to information received here, the Indian ? in only his second testing session with the British team this season ? drove 97 laps and had a best timing of one minute and 16.456 seconds, just a tenth of a second behind his teammate Nico Roseberg. 

I carried out a lot of suspension work on the FW28 today which produced some positive results. I matched the pace of the other drivers on track, said Narain. 

Im very happy with the way the test went. (PTI)

 Randhawa moves up to 14th 

Kuala Lumpur: Jyoti Randhawa has risen to 14th spot on the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit following his play-off victory at the Hero Honda Indian Open. The 2002 Asian Tour No. 1 ended his two-year winless run at Delhi Golf Club, beating compatriot S.S.P. Chowrasia with a birdie on the second hole of a sudden-death play-off on Monday in an extended match. 

The winners cheque of $63,400 took Randhawas season winnings to $188,485. 

A six-time winner on the Asian Tour, Randhawa conceded that his second Indian Open triumph was one of his hardest in his career. 

Chowrasias biggest career cheque of $ 33,900 pushed him up to 36th and he remains in contention to lift Rookie of the Year honours with two events remaining, the Hong Kong Open and Volvo Masters of Asia in Thailand. 

Thailands Prom Meesawat earned $ 14,9080 to raise his seasons earnings to $351,871. Jeev Milkha Singh, however, leads with $ 470,108.

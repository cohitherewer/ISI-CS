 Steffi saves Agassis rackets 

Las Vegas: Andre Agassi nearly lost a grip on two special rackets at a benefit auction before his wife, Steffi Graf, bought them for $360,000 (euro 284,270). 

In the live auction before Agassis 11th Grand Slam for Children on Saturday at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, the tennis star was almost ready to donate the racket with which he won his first professional match, and the racket he used in his final US Open. 

Bidding topped $320,000 (euro 252,690) before Graf intervened. 

Those rackets are supposed to stay with us, she said, after making the final, top bid. 

Agassi offered the next highest bidder a free tennis lesson. Its all crazy money, so thank you, he said from the stage. 

In all, $8.6 million (euro 6.79 million) was raised at the benefit. Agassi called it an amazing night in an amazing year.

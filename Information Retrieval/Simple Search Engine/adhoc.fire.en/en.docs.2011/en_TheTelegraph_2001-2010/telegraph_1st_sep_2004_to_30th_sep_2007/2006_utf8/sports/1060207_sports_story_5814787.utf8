 Onus on Prakash, Rohan: Ramesh

Chennai: India would be looking to youngsters Rohan Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj to deliver the goods when they take on Korea in the Davis Cup tie this weekend, former captain Ramesh Krishnan has said. 

Krishnan said the onus of fetching the singles rested on Bopanna and Amritraj in the Asia-Oceania group I first-round tie in Changwon, Korea, from February 10 to 12. 

This is the time for them to deliver, Krishnan, who guided India to the Davis Cup final in 1987, said. 

Krishnan rated Indias chances against Korea as 50-50.

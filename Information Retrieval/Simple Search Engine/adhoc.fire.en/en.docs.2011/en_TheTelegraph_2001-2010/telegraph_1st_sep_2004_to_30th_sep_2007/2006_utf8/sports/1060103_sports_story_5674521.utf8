 Owen opts for operation 

London: England striker Michael Owen has chosen to have an operation on the broken bone in his right foot to hasten his return to full fitness in time for the World Cup. 

The Newcastle player fractured his fifth metatarsal in colliding with Tottenham goalkeeper Paul Robinson during his sides 2-0 defeat in London on Saturday. 

There were fears the 26-year-old could be sidelined for up to 13 weeks having spoken to former Liverpool teammate Steven Gerrard, who has had a similar injury. 

But Owen says he is fully confident that he will join Gerrard in Sven-Goran Erikssons England squad for the summer spectacular in Germany. 

I have been given the name of a good surgeon and I am going to have a pin inserted, said Owen. 

It is not essential, and some players have done without it, but I have been advised that it should give me the best chance of a strong and quick recovery. 

I dont need any miracles to be playing again this season and, fingers crossed, I will see at least a month of the Premiership season as well as the World Cup. 

 The experiences of so many of my colleagues provides some reassurance that I should back in two to three months.

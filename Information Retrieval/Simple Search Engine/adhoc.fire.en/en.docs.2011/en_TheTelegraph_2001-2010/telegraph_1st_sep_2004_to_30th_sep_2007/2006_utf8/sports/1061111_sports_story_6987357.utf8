A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Leander Paes and Martin Damm will open their campaign in the Shanghai Masters Cup Doubles Championship with a clash against Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett on Sunday. 

Paes, who has just about recovered from a finger injury, and Damm will also be facing world No. 1 American pair Bob and Mike Bryan, and Israeli duo Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in Red Group round-robin play. 

The top eight pairs have qualified for the season-ending meet. This is the second time Shanghai is hosting the singles and doubles events simultaneously. Paes, who qualified with Nenad Zimonjic in 2005, lost to Michael Llodra and Fabrice Santoro.

 NZ maintain winning run

Wellington: Off-spinner Jeetan Patel conceded just 16 runs from eight overs on Friday to inspire New Zealand to a 21-run victory in the fourth one-day International against Sri Lanka. 

Patel, 25, finished with two for 23 off 10 overs after opening batsman Jehan Murbarak (53) and Kumar Sangakkara (52) had set about New Zealands attack in the first 15 overs. 

Earlier, Sri Lanka left-arm pacer Chaminda Vaas captured five for 39 to restrict New Zealand to 224 for nine. 

The visitors were cruising to victory in the first 15 overs before Patels match-winning spell allowed New Zealand to dismiss them for 203 in 46.4 overs. 

Fast bowler Shane Bond finished with three for 39, including two in one over. Bond ended the match when he had Malinga Bandara caught in the deep by Styris for 12. 

New Zealands innings had been held together by useful contributions from Hamish Marshall (50), Peter Fulton (50) and Fleming (37).

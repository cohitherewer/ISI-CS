 Captaincy will drain Flintoff: McGrath

 - Australians take pre-Ashes dig at England allrounder 

 McGrath 

Sydney: Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath has launched into the Ashes mind games, querying whether it will be possible for Andrew Flintoff to bat and bowl well while captaining England. 

McGrath, who has a history of niggling opposing sides before a Test series, made the remarks less than two months before the opening Gabba Test in Brisbane on November 23. 

Its a massive ask, theres no doubt about it, McGrath told a newspaper. 

Hes (Flintoff) such a key player, not only with their bowling, but in the field and in the batting. So if you throw the captaincy on top of it, maybe it will take the focus off his bowling and batting a little bit more and onto the captaincy and have an effect on his game. But hes a class player, and if anyone can handle it, he can. 

McGrath, Test crickets leading wicket-taking fast bowler with 542 wickets in 119 matches, said the England captaincy would drain Flintoff. It makes you think a lot more about the game, he said. 

Instead of Flintoff just focusing on his batting or his bowling and putting all his efforts and energies into that, now he has to think about whos going to bowl next, what field placements to use, where the game is going and so on. It will take a lot out of him.

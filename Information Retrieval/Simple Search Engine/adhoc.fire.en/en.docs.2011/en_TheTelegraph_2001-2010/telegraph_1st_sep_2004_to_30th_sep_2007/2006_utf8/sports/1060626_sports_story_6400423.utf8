 Mexico matched Argentina all the way

 - Pekerman must seriously think of starting with Messi or 

 Tevez vs Germany

 Talking Targets

 PK Banerjee

I expected Mexico to be competitive, but didnt 

 think they would put up such a stellar show against Argentina. 

 The Argentines themselves must have been taken aback by 

 the furious pace at which the Mexicans came at them. In 

 the end, it took a dream extra-time goal by Maxi Rodriguez 

 to make the difference. 

For a team which failed to score against Angola and lost to Portugal in the group stage, it was quite a revelation to see Mexico get off to a whirlwind start. Rafael Marquez, a central defender, took up position at left wing to drive home a clever Borgetti back-header after only six minutes. 

Argentina were a trifle lucky to find the equaliser in the 10th minute. Borgetti, who had fallen back to help the defence, couldnt quite clear a Riquelme corner and Crespo managed to get a touch, which took the ball past the Mexican goalie. 

Having been pushed back by the early Marquez goal, Argentina needed to get back on level terms quickly. Otherwise, they would have been in trouble. Had Mexico managed to maintain their lead till half-time, they would have had a great chance of causing one of the biggest World Cup upsets. 

There wasnt much to choose between the two. Argentina had a little more variety in their moves and created the better openings, but otherwise Mexico matched them step for step. 

The pony-tailed Marquez was all over the field, denying Crespo one moment, sprinting up-field to lend his midfielders and forwards a helping hand the next. Osorio and Salcido, too, played their hearts out in defence. 

Borgetti was a constant source of threat to the Argentine defence. Keeper Abbondanzieri had to be at his very best to keep out two shots from the energetic Mexican striker either side of half-time. 

Riquelmes presence gave Argentina a slight edge in midfield but their fluent passing game was visible only in patches. 

The quick-running and hard-tackling Mexicans denied the Argentines the rhythm they thrive on. The Mexicans didnt just lie low and depend on counter-attacks, they looked for opportunities to push forward all the time. The introduction of Messi and Tevez late in the game gave Argentina a much-needed boost and renewed energy. The more I see Messi, the more I am convinced that he has the attributes to make it big. 

His ball control, speed with the ball and football sense tell me that hes fast maturing into a complete player. I think Pekerman will have to seriously think of playing him or Tevez (at Saviolas expense) from the start in the quarter final against Germany. 

Messi initiated the move which resulted in the winning goal. He smartly switched play to the left with a 35-metre cross pass. 

The overlapping Sorin swung back an accurate 45metre cross for Rodriguez to chest-trap and launch into a left-footed volley. The ball went in like a guided missile into the top right-hand corner. Sanchez did not have a semblance of chance to stop the ball. 

For me, it was the goal of the tournament. A goal which helped the Argentines and their millions of fans breathe a sigh of relief. The last thing they wanted was the match to go into a penalty shootout. 

Its Germany up next for Argentina. Pekermans team had got a real jolt from Mexico, which could stand them in good stead against the high-flying hosts. Still, I would say Germany will go into Fridays quarter final as marginal favourites. 

 Firstly because they are high on confidence after 

 notching up four consecutive wins, all pretty convincing. 

 No less important is the home factor. Klinsmanns 

 men can feed off the vociferous support to keep alive dreams 

 of lifting the trophy on July 9.

 Negi begins with win

 Negi 

Moscow: Double Grandmaster-norm holder Parimarjan Negi gave himself the best birthday present by scoring a fluent win over former womens world champion Zhu Chen of China in the first round of group A2 in the Aeroflot International Open Chess Tournament here. 

Having scored two back-to-back GM norms in Hastings and New Delhi, Negi, set to celebrate his 13th birthday, displayed his superior opening preparation against Chen who fretted and fumed without really making any headway in the one-sided encounter. 

However, Krishnan Sasikiran, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda could not get off to a favourable start in the A1 section. 

Sasikiran and Ganguly lost to Namig Guliyev of Azerbaijan and Arkaditsch Naiditsch of Germany, respectively, while Chanda settled for a draw with Ashot Anastasian of Armenia. 

The tournament is played on a Swiss league basis and the players are divided into four groups. There is A1 for the elite, A2 for the Grandmasters and norm seekers, B for lower-ranked International Masters and C for the beginners hoping to join the list of advance players. (PTI)

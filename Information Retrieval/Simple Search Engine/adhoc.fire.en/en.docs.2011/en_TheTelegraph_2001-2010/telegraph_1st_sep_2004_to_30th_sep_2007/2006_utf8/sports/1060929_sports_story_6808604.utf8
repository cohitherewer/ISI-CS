The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im going to take Sunnys guidance

 - Theres no awkwardness, says Kapil Dev 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev, appointed to chair the National Cricket Academy (NCA) board on Wednesday, intends seeking the guidance of his predecessor Sunil Gavaskar, also a former captain and, like him, a giant among cricketers. 

Theres no awkwardness that Ive replaced Sunny The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) appointed him, now theyve appointed me In fact, Im going to take Sunnys guidance Both of us have the good of Indian cricket at heart Theres no other agenda, Kapil told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from the Far East on Thursday, he added: However, before talking to Sunny, I want to be clear about my role I need to understand what the thinking is (within the BCCI) More important, Ive first got to chat with colleagues on the board. I need to understand them, too. 

According to Kapil, he wont call for discontinuing any programme initiated by Gavaskar (who replaced Raj Singh Dungarpur when Jagmohan Dalmiya became the BCCI president in 2001) only because of a change at the top. 

If Sunny started something good, then my view is that it should be promoted in a big way Of course, I cant say more till Ive spoken to the board members. 

Asked if he would like the Bangalore-located NCA to function like Cricket Australias Centre of Excellence (widely called the Academy) in Brisbane, Kapil replied: No It must be driven by Indian values We have a rich tradition, in cricket and outside of it The NCA should be unique as, given our diversity, were a pretty unique country. 

Trust him to take that line. 

The ruling Sharad Pawar group, it may be recalled, wanted to replace Gavaskar last year itself, but there was pressure from the Mumbai Cricket Association (incidentally, also headed by the Union minister) to maintain status quo. 

Obviously, Gavaskar viewed by many in the BCCI as having been too close to the cornered Dalmiya lost much ground in the last ten months. 

It would have been much nicer, though, had Gavaskar been given the opportunity to step down. That he remains the technical committee chief wont lessen his embarrassment. 

Stalwarts (past and present) must be treated with respect.

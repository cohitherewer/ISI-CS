 Sreesanth fined for breach of conduct

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India seamer Sreesanth has been fined 30 percent of his match fee after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct on two counts during the first Test against South Africa that concluded in Johannesburg on Monday. 

According to an ICC media release from Dubai, Sreesanth was found guilty of two Level 1 offences after a hearing conducted by Emirates Elite Panel ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama. 

The first charge related to clause C1 of the Code, which states that Players and/or Team Officials shall, at all times, conduct play within the spirit of the game 

Sreesanth was deemed to have acted contrary to that spirit when, after dismissing Hashim Amla in South Africas second innings, he ran towards the batsman. 

The charge was brought by on-field umpires Mark Benson and Daryl Harper and third umpire Karl Hurter and Sreesanth pleaded guilty. 

In fining Sreesanth 20 per cent of his match fee for the offence, Mahanama said: At the pre-series meeting both captains and the two sets of management were reminded about the need for everyone to show respect for their opponents. 

The other charge against Sreesanth related to a breach of clause 1.1 of the Code, which concerns the ICC Logo Policy. 

That policy states that all garments worn under the playing shirt in a Test match must themselves be plain white and this was something that was also referred to in the Match Referees pre-series meeting. 

Contrary to that instruction, Sreesanth wore a black garment under his shirt while batting and then later in the day, after this had been pointed out, although he took to the field in a white garment under his playing shirt, it displayed a commercial logo.

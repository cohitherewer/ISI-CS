The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Members may confront govt 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Some of the RCTC club members are ready for a confrontation with the state government about the legalisation of cellphones. About three years ago, talks on this issue had met with a strong opposition from the state home department. However, the phone-happy member-brigade is pushing the stewards to take a reverse course getting the resolution passed in the next stewards meeting and then confronting the government.

 Stewards are meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue, said a member.

 Some members are playing to the tunes of bigwigs, who have no respect for club rules, said another. 

 Assuming the phones are legalised, it is debatable whether RCTC stands to gain. RWITC (Mumbai) collects about Rs 3 crore per annum from the phone users at the racecourse. More than half the collection goes to the Maharashtra governments coffers by way of 55 per cent tax. 

 If phones are legalised, RCTC doest expect more than 30 phone users on each race day. Even if the the club charges Rs 1,000 per phone a day, the annual collections may not exceed 

 Rs 75 lakh, of which the state governments share works out to be Rs 40 lakh. It may not be worth the effort. More importantly, all the big bets would definitely be diverted in to the illegal channels outside, leaving tax collections with the bookmakers and clubs commission suffer drastically. No wonder why most of the bookmakers are against cellphones.

 Stewards, in their June 2003 meeting, had minuted that ...all efforts will be made to ensure that no one is allowed to use mobile phones within the Race course and that action will be taken on any one found to be violating the rule ....security staff is to ensure strict compliance and to report, in writing...

 Yet a couple of years ago, a senior RCTC functionary, now retired, was rudely asked to shut up when he politely requested some club members against the use of cellphones. He was further told that members were the actual owners the club and the RCTC functionary was merely an employee who could be risking his job if he did not turn a blind eye on their activities.

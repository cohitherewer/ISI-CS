 PK, Akhtar making good recovery

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: P.K. Banerjee and Akhtar Ali, two of the most respected elder citizens of the citys sporting world, are recovering satisfactorily after both suffered setbacks last month. 

Football guru PK, who had to be admitted to a nursing home after suffering a mild cerebral stroke, has shown significant improvement. He is still in the nursing home, though he was shifted from the ICU to a private cabin three days ago. 

According to a family member, the former India international and renowned coach will be allowed to go home next Monday. He will have to rest fully for the entire month, at least. Doctors have said he should be able to resume most of his normal activities from early December. 

Former Davis Cupper and Indian coach Akhtar is recuperating at home after having had a bypass surgery. 

He is improving on a daily basis, informed a family member. He has started visiting the South Club for evening walks. He is also doing a few light exercises. He should be able to resume coaching and do his other normal activities by the middle of December.

 Bonanza for Ukraine

Potsdam: Ukraine players will receive a shared $8 million bonus for reaching the World Cup quarter finals and coach Oleg Blokhin said on Wednesday that hard work should always be well rewarded. 

Do you think they should just play for a thank you? Blokhin posed. For good work you receive good money. If the players had been playing badly, they wouldnt have got a penny. 

Blokhin stressed that money was not the main motivation for the players, but rather national pride. 

They are playing for national honour... it is also work. I told them that they should play first of all for prestige and not the money.

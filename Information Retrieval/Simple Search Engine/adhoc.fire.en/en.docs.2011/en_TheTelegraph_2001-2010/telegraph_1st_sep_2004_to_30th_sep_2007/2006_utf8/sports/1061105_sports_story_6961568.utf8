 Anju role in relay gold 

Chennai: Ace long jumper Anju Bobby George turned sprinter as she helped Tamil Nadu win the gold medal in the womens 4x100m relay on the penultimate day of the 46th National Athletics Championship here Saturday. 

Anju was one of the few bright spots on a day affected by incessant rains and wet conditions, which hindered the performance of athletes, in both track and field events. 

Running the anchor leg, Anju was behind leader Poonam Tomar, but breasted the tape well ahead of second place finisher Karnatakas G.D.Gowramma. 

Tamil Nadu (Nagalakshmi, Jessy, N Sharadha and Anju) returned a timing of 47.17 and Karnataka (47.89) and Kerala (47.55) came second and third, respectively. 

Tomar was representing the AFI team on a trial basis along with H M Jyothi, V D Sheijla and Deepti Jose.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Botham backs Hair

Two days after the International Cricket Council revealed that Darrell Hair had asked for $500,000 to quit following The Oval fiasco, reactions continued to flow in. The following are some of the reactions (in alphabetical order): 

 Ian Botham: Darrell Hair has always applied 

 the laws of cricket as he saw fit, and the standard of decision-making 

 at the Test level would not improve without his presence. 

 Aleem Dar: There are other ways of protesting, 

 and the avenue they (Pakistan) chose, I believe, was wrong. 

Strictly according to the law, the decision by Hair is correct. The problem is that if one country attempts it, others will follow and that cannot be good for the game in the long run. 

It is not about one umpire. Both umpires and even those off the field are involved. 

Those decisions on ball tampering and the forfeiture were not taken by Hair alone. 

 Imran Khan: If there is a controversy and you 

 say you pay me money and I will go away, that 

 is going to hit your credibility. It casts doubts over Hairs 

 future commitments. 

 Javed Miandad: The truth must come out. Both 

 the ICC and Hair have set a bad precedent. Hair has made 

 his position more controversial. Umpires cannot be allowed 

 to do this, otherwise every second one will start doing 

 this.

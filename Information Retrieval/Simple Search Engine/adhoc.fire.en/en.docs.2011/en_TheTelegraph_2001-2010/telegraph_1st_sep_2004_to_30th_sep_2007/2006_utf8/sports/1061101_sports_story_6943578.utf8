 Suspend players, says Cedric Pioline

 - Star pullouts leave organisers livid 

Paris: Roger Federer and other top players withdrawal from the Paris Masters have made organisers consider greater sanctions against players who fail to honour their commitments. 

Federer cited fatigue for withdrawing, a day after winning his fourth straight title of the year in his hometown Basel. 

It meant the Paris Masters started without the worlds top three players Federer, Rafael Nadal and David Nalbandian and No. 6 Andy Roddick. 

Nadal withdrew because of an abdominal strain in training and Nalbandian had a stomach illness. Roddick decided to save himself for the Masters Cup in Shanghai starting on November 12. 

This reinforces my determination to introduce significant reforms in the calendar, of its structure, of bonus payments, and the necessary sanctions needed to permit the best players to play in our biggest tournaments, ATP chairman Etienne de Villiers said in a statement. We are determined to assure the future of this fantastic tournament. 

Paris Masters directors Alain Riou and Cedric Pioline were annoyed at losing their headliners before the event. This is devaluing our product, Riou said. It does not meet the expectaion of the fans. The arena is not very full today. After two years of a damaged tournament, our fans are asking themselves questions. We are suffering. 

Pioline, a former top-10 player, said players should be penalised for pulling out. 

The only sanction that can work is a suspension, Pioline said. Thats the only argument a player will understand. Financial penalties dont make much of an impact on earnings. 

Riou said the Paris Masters was vulnerable to withdrawals because it was the last event before the elite, eight-man Masters Cup. 

Obviously it is a lot harder to go (to China) than Europe after a long season, Riou said. 

ATP rules also allowed players to skip two out of the nine Masters Series events without incurring a fine or suspension, and Federer had previously missed only the Hamburg Masters in May. 

Roger phoned this morning to say he is suffering from a general fatigue, Riou said. Hes scared of pushing too hard, so hed rather not take the risk. 

Federer has not appeared at the Paris Masters since 2003, while Nadal promised hed make his debut next year.

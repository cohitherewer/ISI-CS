The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Now, Board cautions Yuvraj for backing Sourav Ganguly

 - Former captain set to be picked for first Test; Raina, Sreesanth are in frame 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: The freedom of speech and expression 

 is guaranteed (with reasonable restrictions) by our Constitution, 

 but any teammate who speaks up for Sourav Ganguly is either 

 reprimanded or cautioned by the Board. 

 Obviously, its too much for the Establishment. 

Harbhajan Singh received a rap on his knuckles ? both from the Board and his home association, Punjab ? when he sided with the former Team India captain in his row with coach Greg Chappell. That was in end-September. 

On Wednesday, Yuvraj Singh (Man-of-the-Series in the just-ended ODIs against Pakistan) was cautioned for telling a TV channel that Sourav deserved to be in the (Test) team in his own right and not merely as his replacement. 

That interview was aired on Tuesday, the day it got confirmed Yuvraj would miss the first Test versus England owing to a hamstring injury, and two days before Kiran More and his colleagues picked the 14/15 for the face-off in Nagpur (from March 1). 

I read about the interview in the newspapers and felt Yuvrajs comments were unwarranted? If players start talking on matters of selection, then what remains for the selectors to do? Board secretary Niranjan Shah asked. 

 Speaking to The Telegraphfrom 

 his cellphone, he added: Ive formally cautioned 

 Yuvraj? A letter has gone and he has been told not to talk 

 about selection? 

Shah confirmed that selection committee chairman More had complained about Yuvraj: Not only More, nobody liked what he said? 

He didnt elaborate on exactly who comprised the nobody. 

The caution to Yuvraj, therefore, forms the backdrop to Thursdays selection meeting in Vadodara. 

In Pakistan, Sourav just got to bat in the Karachi Test and while he didnt score big (only Yuvraj did), he was comfortable against the intimidating pace of Shoaib Akhtar and the lethal swing of Mohammed Asif. 

A majority of the selectors, it seems, are convinced Sourav should get another chance. So, be it 14 or 15, hes set to head for Nagpur at the weekend. 

Of course, its to be seen whether Gautam Gambhir will get one more chance. He managed a best of 30 in his last Test series (versus Sri Lanka) and was unprofessional in the last two ODIs in Pakistan. 

In fact, Sunil Gavaskar has already questioned his temperament. 

With Virender Sehwag fit, Gambhir could well get the boot, allowing Wasim Jaffer to make a comeback. 

[Speaking to the Media in Vadodara, More announced that specialists are going to open. Captain Rahul Dravid will be back in the middle-order.] 

Actually, Gambhir may be replaced by a middle-order bat, rookie Suresh Raina, whose appearances have been limited to ODIs. Mohammed Kaif isnt in the frame as he flopped in the recent ODIs. 

But, then? 

Another ODI specialist in contention is quick Sreesanth. It wont surprise if he ousts Zaheer Khan, who was anything but impressive (except for one spell in Faisalabad) on the tour of Pakistan. 

 Incidentally, theres talk that young leggie 

 Piyush Chawla, who had an excellent U-19 World Cup, is going 

 to get a call-up under the looking-to-the-future 

 scheme. 

 PROBABLE 

 14 

 (As of Wednesday night) 

Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S.Laxman, Wasim Jaffer, Suresh Raina; Mahendra Singh Dhoni; Anil Kumble, Harbhajan Singh; Ajit Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Rudra Pratap Singh, Sreesanth. 

Note: Piyush Chawla could be the 15th player. According to the Board secretary, the 14/15 bit hasnt been decided. 

Dark horse: Vikram Rajvir Singh.

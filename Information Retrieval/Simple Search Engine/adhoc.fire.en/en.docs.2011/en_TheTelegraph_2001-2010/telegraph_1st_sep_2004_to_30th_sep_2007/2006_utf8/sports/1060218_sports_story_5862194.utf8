 Indian men in finals

Jaipur: India booked a berth in the Thomas Cup Badminton final by upsetting Hong Kong 3-2 in a thrilling encounter at its Asian Zone Qualifiers on Friday. 

Chetan Anand, Anoop Sridhar and a duo of Rupesh Kumar and Thomas Sanave displayed brilliant skills to carve out the narrow win to storm into the finals of the World Team Badminton Championship to be played in Japan in May. 

India have reached the final only for the third time after playing at the top level in 1988 and 2000. 

Indian women, however, missed the bus as they could not match the guiles of Singapore girls and bowed out 0-5 in last match on Thursday. 

It was the mens team, which gave a heartening display. 

Top ranked Indian shuttler Chetan Anand started the tide by beating NG Wei, a higher ranked player in a gruelling encounter.

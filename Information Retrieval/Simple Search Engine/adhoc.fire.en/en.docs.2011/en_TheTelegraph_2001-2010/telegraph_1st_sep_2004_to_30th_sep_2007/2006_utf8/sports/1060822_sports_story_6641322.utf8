 Anand clinches 6th Mainz title in a row 

 Mainz (Germany): World 

 No. 2 Viswanathan Anand reserved his best for the final 

 day, scoring two thumping victories to stamp his authority 

 in the World Rapid Championship in the Mainz Chess Classic 

 here. 

The Indian won his sixth title in a row here, seventh on the trot in classic and ninth overall, a record that is unlikely to get surpassed according to the pundits of the game. 

Anand, who was tied 3-3 when the seventh game commenced, won the match against Teimour Radjabov by a 5-3 margin on the final day of the week-long chess extravaganza. 

After a few initial hurdles, Anand was at his best in crushing Radjabov with black first and as the pressure of winning the final game downed on the Azerbaijani talent, the eighth and the final game also went the Indians way. 

Apart from Anand, the other Indian contestant also came up with flying colours in the Ordix Open rapid tournament finishing joint third and fourth overall in the strongest open of the world in this variant of the game. 

Former world champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan and twice world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan tied for the first spot here, both tallying 9.5 points out of a possible 11. Harikrishna scored nine points to figure in the 3-7 place. 

 Earlier in the event, Harikrishna had done well to 

 win the chess960 junior championship match against Arkadij 

 Naiditsch of Germany.

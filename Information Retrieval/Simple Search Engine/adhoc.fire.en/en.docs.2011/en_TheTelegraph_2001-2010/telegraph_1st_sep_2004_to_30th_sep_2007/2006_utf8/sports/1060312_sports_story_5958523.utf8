 Rasalas upsets 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Making a mockery of the 2,800m Queens Cup form, trainer Daniel Davids Rasalas upstaged course-favourite Supreme Princess in the Calcutta St Leger over an identical trip on Saturday. Imran Chisty partnered the four-year-old by Storm Trooper out of Ruddles to a shade under a length victory over the Princess.

 Chisty had the Indian Champion Cup winner settled off the pace while the stable-jockey, B. Prakash, on the favourite, was a man in-a-hurry from about the 1,000m marker ? getting closer to leaders, his yard-mates, Proud Native and Star Memories. Prakash sent the Princess into a two-length lead much before the final turn which brought about the fall of the Classic filly 50m from the winning post.

 Javed Khans Chitralekha won the Acorn Stakes, but only just about, from the Prakash-ridden Favourable Returns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chris Cairns to launch Foundation tomorrow

 - Sourav must go out on his terms, not as a result of a decision taken by somebody else 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Chris Cairns

 Mumbai: Inspired 

 by Steve Waughs charity work, particularly at Udayan 

 in Calcutta, former New Zealand (one-day) captain and one 

 of the finest allrounders of the present era, Chris Cairns, 

 is launching The Chris Cairns Foundation here on Wednesday. 

 Essentially, its an 

 initiative for the education of underprivileged children. 

 The launch (sponsored by Deutsche Bank) is in Mumbai, but 

 we intend working in other Indian cities as also back in 

 New Zealand, Cairns told The Telegraph. 

For starters, the Foundation has tied-up with Pratham, an NGO. 

Cairns, who dropped in at the Wankhede on Monday afternoon, wished Sourav Ganguly good luck and said the former India captain must leave the sport on his terms alone. 

Ive been following Indian cricket and know Sourav is still playing domestic matches... Obviously, he wants to make a comeback and good luck to him... My advice is that he must go out on his terms, not as a result of a decision taken by somebody else... I regard Sourav highly and he has served India very well, he remarked. 

Cairns added: I dont have an insiders view to the spat between Sourav and Greg Chappell, but everybody knows both are such strong individuals... I hear, though, some politics also crept in... Incidentally, his father (Lance) and Chappell were contemporaries. 

Citing his example, Cairns pointed out: I got dropped from the tour of South Africa late last year, but didnt call it a day... I played one of the ODIs versus Sri Lanka at home (Napier) and, then, a Twenty20 match... I finished off there... Except, perhaps, for a bit of County cricket, Im through with the sport. 

Till not too long ago, the 35-year-old Cairns had been planning to quit after the 2007 World Cup. He retired from Tests in the summer of 2004. 

Moving away from Sourav, he said Englands performance in the ongoing Test came as a surprise. I didnt expect India to be under such pressure after taking a a 1-0 lead (Mohali)... That India chose five specialist bowlers has also surprised me... 

In Cairns opinion, India have an excellent chance of winning their first Test series in the West Indies in 35 years: Look, the West Indies have become weak... And, so, youll have an excellent chance there later this year. 

Saying he was impressed with Irfan Pathans development as an allrounder, Cairns asked fans to be patient. Youve got to give him four years (more) to peak... Hes on the right path and should be counted as a full-fledged allrounder. 

Asked whether the definition of allrounders needed to be amended, to include the Adam Gilchrists and Mahendra Singh Dhonis, Cairns laughed: Why not? So many things change... Even a conventional definition can... I dont have a problem. 

Cairns remarked he was pleased with the way New Zealand have been playing. The return of Shane Bond has made a big difference... Im happy for the guys and while the West Indies have become weak, it was nice to thrash them by ten wickets in the Wellington Test today. 

 Barring injuries (and, to a much lesser extent, a 

 spat with Glenn Turner in the mid-Nineties) Cairns would 

 have played a lot more than 62 Tests (3,319 runs and 218 

 wickets) and 214 ODIs (4,950 runs and 201 wickets).

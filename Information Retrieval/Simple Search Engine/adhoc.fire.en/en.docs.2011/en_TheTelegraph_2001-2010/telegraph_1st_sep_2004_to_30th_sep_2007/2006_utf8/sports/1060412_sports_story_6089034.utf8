 AIFF plans bigger role

 - New National Coach

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Fifa is yet to comply to All India Football Federations (AIFF) request to suggest a suitable foreign coach for the national team, but the national body is determined to fill up the post by the end of this month. 

According to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, the AIFF will choose from among the 25-odd applicants. The final decision will only be taken after consulting with the technical committee. 

The AIFF has already received applications from some of the top European coaches like legendary French coach Michel Hidalgo and former national coach of Republic of Ireland, Brian Kerr. We have been receiving at least two applications per week and quite a few of them have an impressive bio-data, Colaco said. 

Former Argentine World Cupper Jose Mario Oiguins application has been recommended by one of the Fifa vice-presidents. While the AIFF secretary was not ready to reveal the entire list of applications he has received in the past couple of weeks, some of them, according to him, could be considered for the top job. They are Ian Porterfield from England, Roy Barreto (Portugal) and Badru Vieira(Brazil). 

The new coach will be expected to handle the job of the technical director of the federation, who would chalk out the plans for not only the senior team, but also the age-group sides and the womens wing. 

The AIFF will also not mind if the designated coach makes a demand to bring his entire group of technical staff. We have already written to all the applicants requesting them to send details of their career, planning and programmes and expected salary, Colaco said. 

The process will start only after we receive the details. At the moment, there is no frontrunner, he said.

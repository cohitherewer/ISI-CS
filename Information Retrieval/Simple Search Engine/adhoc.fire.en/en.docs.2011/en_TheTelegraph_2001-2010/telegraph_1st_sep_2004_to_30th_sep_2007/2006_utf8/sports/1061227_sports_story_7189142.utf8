Calcutta: The 1000 Guineas failed-favourite, Amorina, bounced back into form with an authoritative two-length-plus victory in the 2,400m Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks on Tuesday. In the Process, the Steinbeck-Alvarada daughter also avenged her Guineas defeat, suffered at the hands of Star Perfection the half-money favourite who was looking for a Classic double. 

 The Daniel David- trained filly, however, was no match for Silver Print, leave alone the winner. With the fluent victory in the Ladies Derby, Amorina now walks into the reckoning for the main Derby on January 7. C. Rajendra partnered the winner.

 Meanwhile, the RCTC trainers and the syces union signed the long pending agreement late on Tuesday night. It means, the city turfites may look forward to a hassle-free sport on the New Years Day, the Derby, and, of course, the Invitational weekend in the second week of March.

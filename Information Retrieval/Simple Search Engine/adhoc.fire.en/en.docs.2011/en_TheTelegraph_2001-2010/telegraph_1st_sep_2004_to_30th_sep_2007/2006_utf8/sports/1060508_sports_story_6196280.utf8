 Shane Warne at it again, off the field

London: Shane Warne, no stranger to off-field shenanigans, was caught out again Sunday when he was pictured in a British newspaper allegedly romping with a pair of models. 

A tabloid published pictures of Warne standing in his underpants while a blonde and a brunette, both topless, fooled around with a blow-up sex toy. 

The weekly tabloid also ran explicit text messages allegedly from the spin bowling ace, who is facing an expensive divorce battle with his wife Simone. 

The threesome allegedly were pictured on Thursday night in a plush London flat ? before the 36-year-old racked up some more impressive figures the following morning, taking seven for 99 against Middlesex, his best performance yet for Hampshire. 

Coralie eichholz, 25, hailed Warnes innings. Shane blew our minds. He was so fit. Id give him top marks for more than satisfying us, she said. 

He was talking dirty all the time. It was full-on, hardcore and we had a great time. In the trouser department, he was above average. 

Ive known him for years but nothing happened before because I knew he was married, said the New Zealand-born brunette. 

But since his split hes been texting like mad. He even sent me one during a match. 

Blonde television presenter Emma Kearney, also 25, said warne had likewise bowled her over. 

Shanes a stallion and very willing to experiment. He loved playing around with the inflatable and was up for anything, she told the tabloid. 

Warne has had several well-publicised extra-marital sexual escapades. (AFP)

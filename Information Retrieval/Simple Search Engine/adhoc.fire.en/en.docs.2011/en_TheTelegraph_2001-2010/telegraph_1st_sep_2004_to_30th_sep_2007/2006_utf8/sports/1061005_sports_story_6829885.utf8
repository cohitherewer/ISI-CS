Durban: South Africas opening batsman Herschelle Gibbs will leave for Delhi on Tuesday to appear before the police in connection with the match-fixing allegations against him, coach Mickey Arthur said Wednesday. 

Herschelle will fly out on the night of October 10 straight to Delhi and will be accompanied by his lawyer, Arthur told a press conference just before the rest of the team left Johannesburg for Mumbai to take part in the Champions Trophy.

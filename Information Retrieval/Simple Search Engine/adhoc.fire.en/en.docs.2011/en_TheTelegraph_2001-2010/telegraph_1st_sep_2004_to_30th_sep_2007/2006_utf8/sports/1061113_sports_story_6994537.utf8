 Yousuf hits 20th Test century

Lahore: Mohammed Yousuf plundered his 20th Test hundred as Pakistan took control of the first Test against the West Indies, reaching a comfortable 265 for four on Day II on Sunday. 

Pakistan had a 59 runs lead when bad light again ended play early with Yousuf on a entertaining 107, having put on 125 with Shoaib Malik (61). 

On a pitch described as flat by Yousuf and unlucky West Indian paceman Jerome Taylor, Yousuf stood out with his fifth hundred at the Gaddafi Stadium despite giving two chances. 

He was also fortunate to survive a stumping decision off the bowling of spinner Dave Mohammed when Sri Lankan umpire Asoka de Silva did not refer the line decision to the third umpire. 

Television replays suggested Yousuf had got a lucky break, apart from his dropped chances on 43 and 101. 

Those blemishes aside, he batted with complete control against the hostile pace of Taylor and Fidel Edwards and the guiles of Mohammed. 

The last two sessions were dominated by Yousuf and Malik who played some spectacular shots on the off-side as the bowlers wilted under the pressure. 

Taylor, bowling fast and straight, saw a number of chances dropped off his bowling and deserved more than his two wickets. 

We were somewhat unlucky, I am disappointed a little bit with the dropped catches. Hopefully, tomorrow the boys will be able to do better, Taylor said. 

Yousufs innings from 190 balls with 14 fours was all about grace and timing. Malik packed power in his shots, hitting eight fours and a six in his 149-ball knock. 

Pakistan, resuming on 39 for one, in reply to the West Indies 206, lost Younis Khan (11) early on when he miscued a pull off Edwards to Ramnaresh Sarwan at short mid-wicket. 

Mohammed Hafeez and Yousuf put on 88 before the West Indies struck with two quick wickets. 

Hafeez was trapped leg-before by Taylor for 57 with the total on 133 and seven runs later Mohammed bowled Inzamam for a duck. 

Inzamam, returning after a four-match ban for bringing the game into disrepute during The Oval Test row, looked at sea. 

Yousuf reached his century after tea, flicking Taylor to fine-leg for four. Next ball he miscued a pull-shot high in the air but Taylor floored the chance to cap a bad day for his team.

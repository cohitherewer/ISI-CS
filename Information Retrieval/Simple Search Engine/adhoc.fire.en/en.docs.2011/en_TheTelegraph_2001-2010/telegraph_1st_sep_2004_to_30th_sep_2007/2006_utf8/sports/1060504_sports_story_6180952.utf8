 Pak A set up final date with India A

Abu Dhabi: Pakistan A set up a revenge clash with India A after storming into the final with a thumping eight wicket win over Sri Lanka in the Eurasia Series limited overs tournament here on Wednesday. 

Opener Mohammed Hafeez hit an unbeaten 105 to guide Pakistan A past Sri Lankas meagre total of 209 with more than four overs to spare in the last group D engagement of the second league phase at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. 

Pakistan had earlier lost to arch rivals India in a group match of the first league phase in the six-nation tournament. The final between both the arch rivals will be played on Friday. 

Captain Hasan Raza made 62 not out and combined with Hafeez for the match-winning 110-run unbroken third-wicket partnership. 

Lankas Warnapura made a patient 49 from 71 balls with six fours while the right-handed Silva hit an accomplished 41 off 55 balls with five fours. 

Seamers Umar Gul, Samiullah Khan and Yasir Arafat and leg spinner Mansoor Amjad all picked two wickets each.

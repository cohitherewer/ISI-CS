 IN THE CITY

 With just a couple of days left for the transfer window to open, the old days? drama is revisiting the Maidan. 

 Following the prospect of an exodus of players to Mohammedan Sporting, East Bengal filed an FIR with the police on Sunday, and the players reacted to it on Tuesday. Syed Rahim Nabi and Shylo Malsawmtluanga ?? who have decided to shift base to Mohammedan Sporting ?? moved the police alleging that their ?transfer tokens? were stolen from the locker room of the East Bengal club. Acting on the complaint, the police raided East Bengal compound on Wednesday morning but the exercise bore no fruit.

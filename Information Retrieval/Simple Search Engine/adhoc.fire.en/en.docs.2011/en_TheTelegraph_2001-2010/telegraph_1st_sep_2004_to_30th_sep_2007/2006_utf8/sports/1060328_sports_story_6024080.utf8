 Third day washed out

Wellington: Day III of the third and final Test between New Zealand and West Indies was washed out without a ball being bowled on Monday. 

Umpires Mark Benson and Ian Howell inspected the Napier outfield at 12.30 local time and decided soon after that no play would be possible due to the waterlogged conditions following heavy overnight rain.

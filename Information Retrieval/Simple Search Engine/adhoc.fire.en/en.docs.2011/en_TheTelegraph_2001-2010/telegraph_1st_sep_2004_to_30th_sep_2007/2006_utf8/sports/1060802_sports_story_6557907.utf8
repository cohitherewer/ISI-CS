 Second term for Basile 

 - Im very proud to coach Argentina again 

Buenos Aires: Alfio Basile has been appointed coach of Argentina for the second time, he told reporters on Monday. 

Obviously, Im very proud to coach the Argentina national squad again, like any Argentine would be, he said at a media conference held by his club Boca Juniors. 

Im looking forward to it greatly, especially seeing the quantity of great players we have. 

Basile will replace Jose Pekerman, who resigned after taking Argentina to the World Cup quarter finals where they lost on penalties to hosts Germany. 

The 62-year-old former defender, regarded as an exponent of attacking football, was also at the helm from 1991 to 1994. 

He won the Copa America twice in 1991 and 1993 and led Argentina to the second round of the 1994 World Cup. 

Argentina had looked potential world champions in that tournament hosted by the United States but their campaign fell apart after Diego Maradona failed a doping test. 

Basiles reign was also marred by a 0-5 home defeat against Colombia in a World Cup qualifier. 

Basile will take up his post on September 15 after an agreement between Boca and the Argentina Football Association (AFA). 

He declined to discuss his plans for the job. 

We can talk about the details later, said the gruff, gravel-voiced coach. This only happened ten minutes ago.

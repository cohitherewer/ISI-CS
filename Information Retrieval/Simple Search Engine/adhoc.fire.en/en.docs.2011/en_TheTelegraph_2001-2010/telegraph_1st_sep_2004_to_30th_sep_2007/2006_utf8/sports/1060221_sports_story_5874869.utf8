 Cole brace in Chelsea victory

London: Chelsea needed two late goals by Joe Cole to beat Colchester 3-1 in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday after the third division side had taken the lead and threatened to hold on for a notable Stamford Bridge draw. 

A Ricardo Carvalho own goal put Colchester ahead in the 28th minute with Ferreira equalising nine minutes later. 

Champions Chelsea looked increasingly nervous until substitute Cole scored in the 79th minute and the England midfielder then curled in a sublime second in injury time. 

Manchester City snatched a 1-1 draw at Aston Villa as 17-year-old defender Micah Richards headed a deserved injury for City in injury time. 

In Primera Liga, two goals from Mario Regueiro secured Valencia a 2-1 comeback victory at Real Sociedad in the Primera Liga on Sunday and put them back in second place. 

Valencia have 49 points, six behind leaders Barcelona who hammered Real Betis 5-1 in the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

Third-placed Real Madrid have 48 points following their comfortable 3-0 home win over Alaves. Sociedads Danish striker Morten Skoubo scored inside the first minute but Quique Sanchez Flores side dominated from there on. 

In Italy, AS Roma equalled the all-time Serie A record of 10 wins in a row on Sunday with a 1-0 defeat of Empoli in which their captain Francesco Totti broke his ankle. 

Romas run matched those put together by the Juventus side of the 1931-32 season, AC Milan in 1950-51 and Bologna in 1963-64. (AGENCIES)

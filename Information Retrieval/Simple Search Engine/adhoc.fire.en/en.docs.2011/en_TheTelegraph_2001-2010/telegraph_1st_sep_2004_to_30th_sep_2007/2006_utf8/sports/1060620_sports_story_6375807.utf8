 I dont expect to go far, says Nadal

Madrid: French Open champion Rafael Nadal is focusing on improvement rather than success at Wimbledon next week, after recovering from an injury that forced him out of the Stella Artois event last Friday. 

The Spaniard had to retire with a pain in his left shoulder midway through his quarter-final Lleyton Hewitt, who went on to win the title. 

I pulled out on Friday as a precaution after I started to feel some pain, but now I have overcome the problem, the world No. 2 was reported as saying. 

All Im thinking about now is playing at Wimbledon again. I am very excited and have a week left to prepare well. 

Nadal, unbeaten on clay in a record 60 matches, does not believe he is ready yet to win the title. I need to take it one game at a time. My only objective is to improve my play on a surface I find difficult, and I dont expect to go far, Nadal added. (Reuters)

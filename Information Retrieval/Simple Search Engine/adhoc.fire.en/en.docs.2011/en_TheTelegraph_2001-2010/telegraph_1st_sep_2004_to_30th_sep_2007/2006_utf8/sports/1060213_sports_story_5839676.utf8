 Armaan finishes 15th

Sentul (Indonesia): A weekend of intrigue and suspense ended in an anti-climax for Armaan Ebrahim as the 16-year old Indian finished 15th despite a stunning start at the Indonesian A1 Grand Prix of Nations here on Sunday. 

Starting the feature race from the 18th position, Armaan moved ahead to an incredible ninth by the end of first lap and then to fifth by the ninth lap. 

But two drive through penalties and a tragic pit-stop for tyre change ruined a fantastic chance for the Indian teenager. 

Team Canada fought their way from back of the grid to claim their first victory of the season. 

At the start of the sprint race on Sunday afternoon, Armaan used his experience in rolling starts from his karting days and jumped from 23rd on the grid to 19th by the end of the first lap. 

He followed up this with a steady drive over the 18 laps of the sprint race to finish in a solid 18th place, despite suffering from tremendous oversteer, which was making the car a real handful to control. 

The standing start for the feature race was even more mercurial for Armaan.

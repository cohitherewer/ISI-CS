 Dilip: Batting can improve

Chennai: Newly-appointed chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar felt Tuesday that there is scope to improve Indias batting. There are many players who are in form and doing well in domestic cricket, he said. 

He also reiterated that he was not in favour of frequent changes in the batting order and every batsman has a slot which should be maintained. 

Meanwhile, Virender Sehwag of India Blue had twisted his ankle on Monday, but Vengsarkar said that his injury was not a worrying one. (PTI)

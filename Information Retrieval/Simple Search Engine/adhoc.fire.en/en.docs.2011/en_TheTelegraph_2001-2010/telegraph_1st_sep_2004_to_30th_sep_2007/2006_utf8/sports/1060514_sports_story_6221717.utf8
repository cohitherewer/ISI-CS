Sutton Coldfield (England): Jyoti Randhawa carded a 72 to return a two-under 214 in the third round of the British Masters on Saturday. He was tied 27th with nine others. 

Briton Paul Casey, helped by friendly advice from rival Michael Campbell, was poised to win his sixth European Tour title after a third-round two-under-par 70. 

Shiv Kapur had a none-too-happy day, carding an 80 to return a 224 and was placed in the 70th spot. 

The Briton stayed ahead of the Masters field for a second day on Saturday with his mentor Campbell in second place, two strokes behind on 205 after a 68. 

Although Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland was only a further stroke back after a 70, Campbell and Casey, who have devised a betting system for each tournament to drive each other on, talked in terms of head-to-head between them for Sundays final round. 

Michaels more than just another player, said Casey after a tough, drizzly day when he dropped shots, having had two pristine cards before the third round.

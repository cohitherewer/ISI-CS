 Smicer, Vonlanthen in doubt

Prague: Czech Republic midfielder Vladimir Smicer and Switzerland striker Johan Vonlanthen are in doubt for the World Cup finals. 

Smicer strained a thigh muscle in training and was taken to a hospital in Innsbruck on Tuesday for medical checks. 

He was not hospitalised and remains with the team at its World Cup camp in Seefeld, Austria, a team spokesman said Wednesday. 

Coach Karel Bruckner said he would wait until just before the teams departure for Germany to decide whether to take Smicer. 

Vonlanthen also looks likely to miss the Cup after damaging a hamstring during a training session. According to team doctors, the forward partially tore his left hamstring during training on Monday, although the seriousness of the injury only showed up during a scan on Tuesday. 

US captain Claudio Reyna, meanwhile, did not suffer any muscle damage when he limped off in the 0-1 defeat against Morocco on Tuesday. It was feared he had pulled his hamstring when he over-extended his leg trying to intercept a pass. 

However, a scan on Wednesday showed there was no serious damage. 

Spain defender Michel Salgado, too, suffered a muscle strain in training at their camp in Las Rozas and will miss the World Cup warm-up game against Russia on Saturday. 

The team doctor said he did not think the injury was serious but the player would need a scan in the next two days to determine the precise extent of the strain.

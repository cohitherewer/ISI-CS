 Ancic takes on Kunitsyn today

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Robredo is the top seed 

Mumbai: The Davis Cup encounter against Pakistan brought Indias commercial capital back on the international tennis map five months ago. Come Monday, Mumbais comeback will be complete when the $3,80,000 Kingfisher Airlines Open kicks off at the CCI courts. 

Not only Mumbai, its heady days for India as well. This is the second ATP event after the Chennai Open which has completed 10 years to be hosted by a country which has champion doubles players but not a single man in the top-200 of the singles list. Add two WTA Tour events (Calcutta and Bangalore), and you have a sumptuous feast of international tennis. 

The inaugural Mumbai meet has been hit by a number of late withdrawals. Czech Radek Stepanek, Chilean Fernando Gonzales, German Nicholas Kiefer, Frenchman Fabrice Santoro and Briton Greg Rusedski have all pulled out. The field, which would have boasted of half-a-dozen players from the top-20, now has just three highly-ranked men. 

It will still be a decent field, thanks to the presence of Tommy Robredo, Mario Ancic, Tomas Berdych and Russias Davis Cup hero Dmitry Tursunov. 

Second seed Ancic, who lost to Marcos Baghdatis in the China Open final a wee ago, will open versus Russian Igor Kunitsyn on Monday. Before that, Indian wild card Karan Rastogi and German Bjorn Phau will open centre court proceedings at 5 pm. 

As expected, no Indian came through the final round of qualifying action on Saturday. Mustafa Ghouse took Frank Moser to two tie-breaks before losing both, while young Sanam Singh went down 6-7, 2-6 to Gouichi Motomura. The Indian interest will largely centre around doubles, where player-turned-MD Mahesh Bhupathi and Ancic will be favourites, especially after their China conquest. 

It will be interesting to see how Leander Paes fares with Aisam Qureshi after Martin Damm opted to stay away following the Davis Cup weekend when he did duty for the Czech Republic.

 Bengal refuse to visit Srinagar 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After defending champions Goa, it was the turn of IFA secretary Subrata Dutta on Monday to refuse to take part in the national football championships for the Santosh Trophy if the All India Football Federation (AIFF) sticks to its decision to hold it in Srinagar in September-October this year. 

While the Goa Football Association (GFA), in a resolution passed in its annual general meeting on Sunday has decided to request the AIFF to shift the venue for the Santosh Trophy from Jammu and Kashmir in light of the recent spate of terrorist activities in the state, the IFA secretary said the 29-time champions would not play in Srinagar. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, Dutta said: GFA, I am told, has passed a resolution to this effect. My stand is very simple. Bengal will not play if the venue is not shifted to any other state. I am not going to expose my players to such a high-risk area, especially after what has happened there in the past few days. 

The AIFF initially said that it would send a team of observers to Srinagar to asses the situation and there was a talk of shifting the meet to Punjab or Haryana, but nothing happened thereafter. AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco, who is currently in Malaysia, said he would personally visit Srinagar to gauge the position. 

However, a senior office bearer of the Jammu and Kashmir Football Association has gone on record saying that all arrangements have been made to host the tournament there from the first week of September. 

GFA secretary Savio Messias said: We have not refused to play in Kashmir but has only made a request to AIFF to change the venue. In case, the AIFF does not comply with our request, we have decided to ask the players whether they are willing to go to Kashmir. 

The dilly-dallying on the part of AIFF is also adding to confusion. The federation has not only failed to finalise the venue, but has also not announced the date and venue for the Federation Cup. It is still undecided whether to hold the Federation Cup or the Santosh Trophy first.

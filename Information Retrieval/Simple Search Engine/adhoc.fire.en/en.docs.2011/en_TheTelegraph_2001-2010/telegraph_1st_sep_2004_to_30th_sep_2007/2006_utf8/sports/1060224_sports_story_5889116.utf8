Calcutta: Two-time champion Vikramjit Singh consolidated his lead after the second round of the All-India Seniors and Mid-Amateur Golf Championship being played at the par-72 RCGC course. 

According to a press release, Vikramjit carded 74 on Thursday to open up a three-stroke lead at six-over 150. Lakshman Singh fired a 76 to remain at second place with 153. K.K. Bajoria moved up to third place with 155. Ashit Luthra (157) and Ashok Malik (159) occupied the next two spots. 

In the mid-amateur category, Sudeep Chitlangia went further ahead of the rest of the field after Round III. His 76 took him to 217, which put him 25 strokes clear of Gaurav Ghosh (242). Lt Col S.D.S. Batth was third with 252. 

In the opening round of the super-senior category, T.K. Bose shot 97 to emerge on top. R.N. Singh (112) was second and B.K. Chaturbedi (118) third. 

In a nine-hole contest in the same category, N.F. Sarkar carded a 40 to be well clear of J.P. Goenka (46). P. Sen (47) was placed third. 

Note: Owing to an error on the part of Tiger Sports Marketing, which provided the press release, Thursdays report mentioned Amit Luthra as being tied third, when it should have been Ashit. Thats regretted.

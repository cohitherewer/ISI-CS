 Zidane all set for 100th cap 

Paris: Zinedine Zidane will win his 100th cap on Saturday, making his final appearance at the Stade de France where he became one of French soccers immortals. 

The World Cup warm-up against Mexico will bring the memories flooding back for the gifted son of Algerian immigrants, and one in particular. 

It was in that same high-tech arena on the outskirts of Paris that the balding 33-year-old with the magic touch scored two goals in Frances 3-0 defeat of Brazil in the 1998 World Cup final.

 Akhmedov aims for last-4 berth in Asian U-20 meet

 - Sushil, Vimal could be the trump cards 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: His salary is only one fifth of what his counterpart in the senior national squad, Bob Houghton, receives from the All India Football Federation (AIFF). Federation sources also say that he still does not have a permanent contract. Yet, Islam Akhmedov, Indias under-20 coach for the past one year, vows to chase a dream that seems almost impossible to achieve under the present circumstances. 

The Uzbek coach, in the capital on Wednesday, said that though his team has returned without a medal from the SAF Games, he still hopes to reach the semi-finals of the Asian under-20 championships to be held in Calcutta and Bangalore from October 29. 

Yes, my boys have not done too well in the AFC meet in Dhaka and in the SAF Games, but on both occasions we have to compete against senior teams, argued Akhmedov. In Asian championships, it will be different as we will compete against boys of our own age group. 

Four semi-finalists of the Asian championships would be eligible for the under-21 World Cup in Canada next year and Akhmedov is convinced India could be one of them. 

I am sure we will qualify from the group where Jordan, Kyrgyzstan and South Korea are the other teams. Then in the quarter-final, we may play China or Australia on November 8, which is also my birthday. I know my boys will have a birthday gift ready for me that evening, said the genial coach. 

But then, his boys have so far done nothing to raise any hope. Rather it has been levelled as an ordinary team and the Uzbek coach too defensive in his tactics. Naturally, Akhmedov does not agree with this observation. Its wrong to say I am a defensive man, Akhmedov said. 

I have some good attackers like Sushil Singh and Vimal Pariyar, who could be my trump card in the Asian meet. Pariyar, the coach said, had a forgettable tournament in Colombo, but will certainly come back strongly.

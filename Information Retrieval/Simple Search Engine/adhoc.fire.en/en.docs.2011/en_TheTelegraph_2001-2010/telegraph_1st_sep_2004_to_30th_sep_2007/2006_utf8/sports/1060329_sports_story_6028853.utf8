 ICC should prohibit pitch repairs: Broad 

Durban: Match Referee Chris Broad is planning to ask the International Cricket Council (ICC) to prohibit repairs being made to a pitch during a match. 

The fourth day of the second Test between South Africa and Australia in Durban on Monday was shrouded in controversy when the Kingsmead groundstaff repaired a hole in the pitch before the start of play. 

There is nothing specific in the laws of the game that says you cant, so I will recommend to the ICC that something like that is put in, Broad said in a televised interview on Tuesday. 

There are obviously cracks here and they have got wider as the games gone on, and they will break up and thats the nature of the pitch over five days. 

You just have to accept that sometimes a ball will find the edge of the crack and will take pieces out. Thats just wear and tear on the pitch and it should be allowed to so that it becomes more difficult to bat on as the game goes on. 

Broad, who ordered the repair to be undone at first drinks break on Monday, referred to a similar situation that arose in the first Test between New Zealand and South Africa in Hamilton in 2003-04.

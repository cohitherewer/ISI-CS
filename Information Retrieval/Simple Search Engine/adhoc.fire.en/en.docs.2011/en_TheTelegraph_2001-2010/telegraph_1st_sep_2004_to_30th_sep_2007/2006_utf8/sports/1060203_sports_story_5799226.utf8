The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont have nostalgia and dont carry memories: Imran

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Iconic cricketer-turned-politician opens up on just about everything 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Imran Khan 

Karachi: Pakistans solitary World Cup-winning captain Imran Khan, a Member of the National Assembly (MNA) from Mianwali, spoke to The Telegraph (over the phone from Islamabad) the other day. The questions had nothing to do with cricket and the head of the Tehrik-e-Insaaf party wasnt uncomfortable answering any. 

The following are excerpts: 

Q Fourteen years after quitting cricket, you still remain the No.1 star. Have you ever asked yourself why? 

A (Grins) I havent... I really dont have an answer for the adulation I continue to receive... However, Im sure its the same for Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. 

Surely, the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital lifted your standing even more... 

Perhaps, but that wasnt why I conceived of it and, today, Shaukat Khanum is the recipient of a World Health Organisation award... 

There has been talk that the Shaukat Khanums Karachi project ran into problems because youre in the Opposition. Is that correct? 

We did have hassles with the bureaucracy, but things have been sorted out. Were beginning with a diagnostic centre-cum-chemotherapy bay and the full-fledged hospital is to come up in the next phase. 

How are you placed on the political front? 

Politically, this is an exciting time in Pakistan... The country is going through a change in that theres a consensus among opinion-makers that theres no substitute for democracy... Whats more pleasing is that the political parties (in the Opposition) have reached a consensus on the need for an independent judiciary and an independent election commission... If I may add, the genuine political parties are all in the Opposition... The so-called Kings Party will disappear with Gen. (Pervez) Musharraf... You cant have democracy unless theres an independent election commission and an independent judiciary. 

Have you met Gen. Musharraf recently? 

No... I dont see any point in meeting him... His stand is clear: Like military dictators of the past, he wants to remain in power... For me, theres no meeting-point with him. 

But he offered you the Prime Ministership twice... 

Thats past... Initially, I did think he would be different... I was proved wrong. 

What if youre offered it for the third time? 

(Laughs) Wont happen... In any case, Ive already told you I cant be a puppet Prime Minister. Im in politics to fight for democracy... I believe Pakistan has loads of potential, but needs a democratic set-up to go forward... Manipulation is what stands out in any other system... I certainly wouldnt like to be controlled. 

As a MNA, whats your assessment of Pakistan today? 

Bear in mind that Im a born optimist... Even when things werent going my way in cricket, I would think positively... No matter how bad the scene, I still see a light at the end of the tunnel... What gives me hope is that even the people feel the way forward is through democracy. 

How can you be so sure? Youre the sole MNA of your party and theres just one member in a provincial assembly... 

(Interrupting) But I work at the grassroots... I travel to remote corners and interact with very basic people... Except the tiny elite, which has got richer under the current dispensation, others want a change... Youve got to remember the present system, and I call it the Musharraf system, favours the wealthy... The majority continues to suffer. 

Frankly, given the reach of your party, is it actually ever going to be a serious player? Isnt it a one man show? 

Parties arent counted by the personalities they have... They depend on (a) the manifesto/ideology and (b) credibility... I accept we need to work on the other areas, but we have an ideology and dont lack credibility. (After a pause) The last elections (2002) werent free and fair and I suggest you read the European Unions report on it. When the (government) agencies were able to destroy the bigger parties, what chance did we have? 

Any plans to celebrate a decade of the Tehrik-e-Insaaf? 

Yes, come April 25 and we will start a massive membership drive... For various reasons, we havent had one for some time... Once it begins, youre going to get an idea of our support base... We dont carry the baggage of corruption and we arent tainted. 

Whats your take on Indo-Pak relations? 

The momentum, I fear, has been lost. 

But more bus and train services are being operated... 

Its too little and its superficial... Mr (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee made positive statements, but the goodwill generated by the last tour (early 2004) wasnt really capitalised upon... The public had then egged the leadership (on both sides) on... It wanted a change, but Ive been disappointed with the pace... Moreover, the core issue ? Kashmir ? isnt being addressed. I expected Kashmir to be demilitarised... Beyond a point, confidence building measures dont mean a thing. 

Youve mentioned demilitarised, but you cant condone terrorist strikes by militants owing allegiance to groups in Pakistan... 

Sporadic attacks cant be ruled out anywhere... There has to be some movement on Kashmir. 

What are your views on the Manmohan Singh government? 

Its scared of the hard right... The government probably fears it will be accused, by the right-wing, of giving in too much... Of course, this is strictly a personal opinion. 

Do you feel awkward on seeing photographs of Jemima with a certain star? 

(After a pause, emotionally) My philosophy in life has always been clear: I close the chapter on my past... After quitting, I didnt ever return to cricket... Have never gone back to Aitchson College or Oxford because I missed the institutions... I dont have nostalgia and dont carry memories... Dont look at old photographs, dont look at old videos... For me, the past has no significance except if theres something to learn... Jemima and I had our ups and downs, but everything finished with the divorce (in mid-2004)... Its her life now, Im isolated from it... Because of our sons, though, we continue to be in contact... 

The last one: What has life taught you? 

Lets leave it for the next interview!

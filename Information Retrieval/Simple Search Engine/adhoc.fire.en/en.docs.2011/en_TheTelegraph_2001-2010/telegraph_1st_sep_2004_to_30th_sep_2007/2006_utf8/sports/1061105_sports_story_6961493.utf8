The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My job is to keep scoring runs: Gambhir

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: The morning did not exactly start on a bright note for North Zone opener Gautam Gambhir with Sunil Gavaskar saying he would have been a sitting duck on the fast and bouncy pitches of South Africa. Clearly, not the ideal way to go into a big match. 

By the end of Saturday, however, he had hit 86, an innings that could prove decisive in the Duleep Trophy tie against East. 

Gambhir could afford to smile, and take Gavaskars observations sportingly. 

Sunny Sir was too great a player for someone like me to comment on. I have the highest regard for him as a cricketer and observer of the game. I had just read the headlines before leaving for the ground. I am more focused on the game at hand. My job is to get runs and force my way into the team, he said. 

Gambhir said he was presently dwelling on making the most of the good run.

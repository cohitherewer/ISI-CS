Calcutta: East Bengal fans had multiple reasons to rejoice on Monday. 

Brazilian Luiz Octavio de Souza scored on debut, and promised to be an asset as a central midfielder. Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), a team which had beaten Mohun Bagan and drawn with Mohammedan Sporting, had been mastered with ease. Midfield general Dipankar Roy put up another fine show, setting up the first goal and scoring the second. MoM Sasthi Duley worked overtime to ensure that the absence of regulars Chandan Das and Jayanta Sen was not felt. 

It was East Bengals fourth win in as many games in the Sahara CFL Premier Division. More importantly, the team was back to its smooth functioning ways four days before the big clash with Mohun Bagan. 

Talking of Octavio first, the Brazilian couldnt have given a better account of himself on debut in this country. The Maidan in the monsoon season is not the ideal place for football, least of all for a foreigner who has landed in the city only a week ago. 

Octavio not only made light of the heavy underfoot conditions, he actually made an effort to take charge of the midfield. Gifted with a fine first touch, Octavio has a good header and a nose for goals as well. What must have pleased the fans most was a knack to be involved with the game all the time. 

It took nine minutes for Octavio to win the fans hearts. Dipankar did well to control the ball in the slush and floated in a centre which Ashim couldnt get his head on. As the ball fell between Duley and CPT defender Soumen Sarkar, Octavio quickly pounced on it and volleyed home. 

Octavios 15th-minute header had power but went over the crosspiece. Minutes later, the Brazilian initiated a move which culminated in Ashim Biswas shot being palmed away for a corner. Another Octavio header missed narrowly, this time coming to grief in the side-netting. 

It was 10 minutes after half-time that East Bengal got their second goal, thanks to an Ashim-Dipankar combine. Ashim evaded the left-backs challenge, took the ball out of a sticky patch and sent a measured centre for Dipankar to shoot home. 

Ashim could have added a third one had his 25-yard shot not been fisted away by Sandip Guha. Fredy Mascarenhas, too, had his chance to get into the scoresheet, but after being well fed by Dipankar, he managed a wild shot.

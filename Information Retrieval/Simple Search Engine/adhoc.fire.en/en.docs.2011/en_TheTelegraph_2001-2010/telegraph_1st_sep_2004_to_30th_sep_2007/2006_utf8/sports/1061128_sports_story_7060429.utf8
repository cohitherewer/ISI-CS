The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI to warn Greg Chappell

 - Team India Coach to be told not to comment on anything outside cricket 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell 

 Calcutta: The 

 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will warn 

 coach Greg Chappell, asking him to refrain from commenting 

 on anything outside cricket.

 I havent spoken to 

 the president (Sharad Pawar) as yet, but were going 

 to warn Chappell At this stage, I dont think we can 

 do anything else, a top official told The 

 Telegraph on Monday. 

At this stage was, obviously, a reference to the World Cup till when Chappell is on contract getting closer by the day. 

The quadrennial blockbuster begins in mid-March. 

Speaking some hours after many MPs (and members of the West Bengal legislature) had taken strong exception to a Chappell observation in Cape Town, he added: Its possible that the (print) Media could have misquoted the coach, but he has been caught on tape He has to be warned. 

Responding to a question on Indias poor performances being raised in Parliament, Chappell had said: Im not surprised. They (MPs) are paid to do so in Parliament. 

Another official, who also didnt wish to be identified, remarked: Chappell may not have intended to cast a slur, but ought to have been careful with words We Indians are a sensitive lot and, unbelievably, he forgot that Pawar is himself an MP 

In his opinion, the BCCI should act quietly and not add to a troubled situation. 

Whatever his personal views, though, Pawar took to defending Chappell publicly. He even went to the extent of accusing TV channels of instigating MPs. 

Till late in the evening, it wasnt clear what form verbal or otherwise the warning would take. Moreover, one isnt sure just how effective it will be. 

Chappell (who seems obsessed with moolah-matters), after all, had been cautioned during the first Test against England in Nagpur. That was in March. 

On that occasion, hed specifically been directed by Pawar to desist from talking about anything except the teams performance and prospects. 

It followed a written complaint from former captain Sourav Ganguly, whod rightly been offended by a Chappell quote to a UK-based daily: What I didnt realise at that stage (the 2005 tour of Zimbabwe) was how important to his life and finances being captain was 

The Sourav-Chappell relationship soured on that trip, resulting in one of the most unfortunate chapters in our cricket. 

While the bit about MPs has drawn the maximum attention, one is amazed that Chappell actually confessed he has no answers to Team Indias current problems. 

 If the coach is clueless, where do the players go? 

 Whats he there for?

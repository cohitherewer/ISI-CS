 Cech to stay away from Essien

Westerburg: Czech goalkeeper Petr Cech is happy to share his views with his Chelsea teammates at the meet with one exception ? Ghana midfielder Michael Essien. 

The two dont have any unresolved problems with each other, rather the teammates became rivals as Essiens Ghana would take on the Czech Republic on Saturday. 

We have a good relationship but that means nothing ahead of the match, Cech said. 

Im in touch with Arjen Robben, John Terry and Frank Lampard, but not with Michael Essien. His team is in our group, he said. (AP)

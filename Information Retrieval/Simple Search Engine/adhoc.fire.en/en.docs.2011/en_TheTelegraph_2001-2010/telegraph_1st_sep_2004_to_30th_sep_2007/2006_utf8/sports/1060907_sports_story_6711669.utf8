 Inzamam stays captain

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Inzamam-ul Haq was retained captain of Pakistans 14-member squad for the forthcoming Champions Trophy in India in October-November. 

According to a PCB press release, Inzamam was chosen the leader on the recommendation of the national selection committee. 

By naming Inzamam the leader, the Pakistan Cricket Board reaffirmed its stand that it did not consider him guilty of ball-tampering charges or bringing the game into disrepute during last months controversial fourth Test at The Oval. Inzamam is due to attend the International Cricket Council hearing later this month. 

However, there were no major surprises in the squad . Fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, after returning to action in the one-day series against England, is also in the squad. 

 THE SQUAD 

Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Rana Navedul Hasan, Kamran Akmal, Imran Farhat, Muhammad Asif, Umar Gul, Mohammed Hafeez, Rao Iftikhar Anjum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A podium finish will be tough for India

 - The Nerthlands will start favourites

 Expert View Pargat Singh

 Sohails contribution has been enormous

The hockey World Cup will be a 

 real test of character for India who have been struggling 

 to make a mark at the highest level of late.

 Keeping in mind the Indian teams 

 inconsistency in big events, I will be very happy to see 

 the side figure in the semi-finals. If they can make the 

 last-four stage, anything can happen. But realistically, 

 that is going to be very tough. Yet, there is a chance of 

 finishing in the top six, which to my mind is a decent finish.

 Sure India have one gold and two 

 other medals a silver and bronze but it also needs to 

 be borne in mind that all these three medals came in the 

 first three editions of the World Cup, the title-winning 

 feat coming in 1975.

 Since then in nine editions, India 

 have never figured on the podium and that is indeed a tragedy 

 for there have been times when the team has indeed looked 

 good. The fact is a team needs to get into the semi-finals 

 to contend for a medal and India have not done that.

 India have both Germany and Holland 

 in their group, besides England, South Africa and Japan. 

 They will need to make sure they beat the last three teams 

 and ensure a decent result against Germany and Holland to 

 have a chance of making their first semi-final in more than 

 30 years. 

 This team will miss Sandeep Singh, 

 for he was capable of pulling India out of a hole in a tense 

 situation with his conversion through drag-flicks. With 

 an unfortunate accident putting him out of action, his replacement 

 Raghunath will have a big responsibility, but he is not 

 one in the same mould.

 Often we hear that one of the 

 keys of todays hockey is that tournaments are being 

 won on the strength of their penalty corner specialists. 

 Time and again, it is the penalty corner specialists who 

 have been the top-scorers for their side. And that provided 

 them the winning edge.

 While penalty corner specialists 

 may seem to have become all important now, the fact is they 

 always have been.

 I still remember one of my early 

 heroes, Late Surjit Singh being the star for India in the 

 early editions of World Cup and later we had Rajinder Singh, 

 who was the leading scorer for India in 1982. We are aware 

 of Tanvir Dar or Sohail Abbas contribution to Pakistan 

 So the onus for India will be 

 on Kamalpreet Singh and Dilip Tirkey, who will also be expected 

 to take the set pieces. A few days ago I met Gagan Ajit 

 Singh and he looked confident. He said the boys were combining 

 well. I hope they do so in Germany, too. 

 That brings me to Indias 

 first opponent for the 11th edition of the World Cup. India 

 have always managed to draw a very strong opponents in their 

 first game and that often sets the tone for the tournament.

 The first opponent will be hosts 

 Germany this time. We have often played them in first games. 

 Though the teams are closely matched, the Germans generally 

 manage to enjoy the advantage. In 1992 Olympics, we lost 

 0-3 and after that we were always fighting to find our confidence.

 So our first match against Germany 

 will tell us a lot in which direction we are headed in this 

 time. The hosts, who could not manage to win the World Cup 

 of football on home soil will be aiming to set that right 

 in hockey. They are an extremely fit, aggressive and skilful 

 side and India will do well to keep them in check.

 Pakistan have a great World Cup 

 record with four wins, the maximum by any side, but of late 

 they have struggled which is why Sohail is back. The Dutch 

 with Teun De Nooijer, one of the finest forwards in the 

 world today, besides the likes of Ronald Brouwer and Roderick 

 Weusthof start as favourites. And they also have Jerome 

 Delmee and Taeke Takema, which makes them a solid side.

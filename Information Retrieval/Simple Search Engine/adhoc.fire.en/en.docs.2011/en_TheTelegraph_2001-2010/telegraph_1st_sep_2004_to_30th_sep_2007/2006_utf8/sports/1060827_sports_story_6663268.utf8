 Venus pulls out of US Open

New Haven: Two-time US Open champion Venus Williams has withdrawn from the final Grand Slam of the year after failing to recover from a wrist injury. 

The American, the winner in 2000-2001 and the No. 30 seed this year, said her left wrist injury had not healed in time for the event which begins on Monday. 

I have many great memories of competing at the US Open and I regret that I will not be able to participate in 2006, a statement from Williams read on the US Open website. I look forward to returning in 2007, she said.

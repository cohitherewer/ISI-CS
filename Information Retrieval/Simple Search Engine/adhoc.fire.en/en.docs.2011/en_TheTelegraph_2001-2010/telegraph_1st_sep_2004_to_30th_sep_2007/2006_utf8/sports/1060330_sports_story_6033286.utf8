 Chistys 5 helps Daniel win 6 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Jockey Imran Chisty was on a roll, winning five races for trainer Daniel David on Wednesday. The champion jockey also helped the trainer push his days tally to six in the 10-event card, as he went easy on Errol Bhungards course-favourite, Decameron, in the 1,600m Cooch Behar Memorial Cup. Daniels quiet-fancy, Proud Native, won the race from a heavily-wagered The Polynesian after Decameron lost about 5 lengths at the start and finished only about a length behind the winner.

 The Grand Annual Handicap and the B.S.F. Trophy were easy pickings for Chistys Favourable Returns and Star Phoenix. But, in the Mysore Race Club Cup, Chistys Diffidence had to overcome a stiff challenge from Robin Corners ward, Supreme Power. 

 Star Magic returned to winning ways. The eight-year-old gelding claimed the Midnight Cowboy Cup, a terms race.

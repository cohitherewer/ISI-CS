 ICC concerned over too many Indo-Pak ties

Margao: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is concerned that the proliferation of India-Pakistan matches in recent times may kill the appeal. The arch-rivals are slated to meet in Abu Dhabi later this month for two one-dayers. 

It is a matter of concern, ICC president Ehsan Mani told a media conference on Sunday. 

The ICC had agreed on a four-year cycle where both countries would play each other once every two years on a home and away basis. To top it all, both the Boards have now started playing in neutral venues. 

The ICC is concerned that such increase in number of matches will dilute its value. We do have some reservations, Mani said. 

He informed the reporters that the ICC had finalised all matters regarding the hosting of Champions Trophy with the BCCI. 

There remain a couple of unresolved areas such as the amount of tickets to be allotted to the ICC sponsors and finalising the fourth venue. 

Mohali, Jaipur and CCI (Mumbai) are the three venues that would host the matches. A fourth venue in Ahmedabad will be agreed upon after taking into account cost-related factors. 

There is no confusion. Every member country is committed to playing in the Champions Trophy, Mani clarified. 

The ICC president felt the issue of player burnout should be resolved by individual Boards. 

Player burnout is a matter of concern. It is for the individual Boards to manage. The responsibility lies with the Board. The ICC has suggested in its guidelines at least six-week rest period for players between two series. 

The Indian players end up playing 40 ODIs in a season when they should be playing 30. The BCCI says this is in agreement with their players. The players should also talk to the Board and take it from there. 

On the Faridabad ticket scandal issue, Mani felt the ICC could do nothing as it would tantamount to one step too far on their part. 

But he stressed that the BCCI needed to professionalise its management, and was pleased to hear from Sharad Pawar the other day that they were working in that direction.

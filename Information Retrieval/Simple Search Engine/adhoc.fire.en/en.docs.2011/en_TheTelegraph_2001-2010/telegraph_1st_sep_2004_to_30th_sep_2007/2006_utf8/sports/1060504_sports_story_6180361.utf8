 Sourav career far from over 

 - He should take a break and come back fresh: Srinath 

 Sourav Ganguly 

Srinagar: Jawagal Srinath said on Wednesday that former Team India captain Sourav Gangulys career is not finished and he should take a break and come back fresh. 

Souravs career is far from over. In todays set-up, you cannot shut the doors on anyone. I think he needs to take a break and come back fresh, Srinath said. 

The former pace spearhead, accompanied by MRF Pace Foundation chief T.A. Sekhar, was in Jammu and Kashmir for a two-day camp to hunt for fast bowling talent in the region. 

Srinath also feels that leg-spinner Anil Kumble had a lot to contribute to the shorter version of game and he should be a part of the team for next years World Cup. 

Kumble should be an integral part of the Indian team for the 2007 World Cup? he still has an important role to play, Srinath commented. 

Srinath was all praise for the young crop of pace bowlers, saying they were all shaping up well but refused to predict if they would be able to pose a strong challenge in the World Cup next year. 

Pathan, Sreesanth, R.P. Singh and Munaf Patel have been performing well at the international level, he said. 

On the burnout issue, Srinath said cricketers in mid-twenties can play any number of games they wish to. 

At that age, it does not affect the players too much, Srinath said adding that the rotation policy of the Indian team management is working well for them at the moment and it would help in reducing the players burnout. 

He also said introducing the youngsters into international arena at an early age would benefit them, specially the fast bowlers. 

The fast bowlers get a new sense of direction if they are exposed to international cricket at a young age. They learn a lot while playing and know which areas they need to improve upon, he said. (PTI)

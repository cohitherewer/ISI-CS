The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiya queries

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: There is no end to the allegations and counter-allegations in the BCCI versus Jagmohan Dalmiya battle. 

It was Dalmiyas turn on Thursday to rubbish the new charges levelled against him by Inderjit Singh Bindra amp; Co. 

Dalmiya stuck to his query as to why the BCCI got Rs 82 crore less from Nimbus Communications (India) for the telecast rights and demanded the appointment of an expert agency to inquire why the board suffered such a huge loss. I had asked them to furnish documents of the tender details, its our legal right as an affiliate? but they havent provided anything so far, Dalmiya said on Friday. 

I am ready to sort out the matter on the table. I invite them to sit with me. There are expert agencies like PricewaterhouseCoopers and McKinsey. Let us take their help. 

The former BCCI chief claimed that Bindra, who is president of the PCA, is yet to provide accounts of the Challenger Trophy hosted by his association in October 2005. 

Dalmiya brushed aside allegations of financial irregularities vis-?-vis the 2004 platinum jubilee ODI at the Eden, the Holland tri-series and the BCCI-commissioned book on social history of Indian cricket. 

They arent serious about sorting out matters. They only want to divert attention, he said.

 Humour keeps Spaniards going

Kamen: Spain coach Luis Aragones is using his strong character and mischievous sense of humour to keep players on their toes during the long wait for their first game against Ukraine, says defender Michel Salgado. 

He told me off the other day and he gave Joaquin a dressing down too, but thats the way he is, Salgado said on Sunday. It isnt anything serious and he does it for the good of the team. 

Aragonesappeared to scold Santiago Canizares in training on Saturday but the coach and his goalkeeper played down the incident saying it was nothing more than a joke. (REUTERS)

 Alonso grabs crucial pole in China

Shanghai: Fernando Alonso captured a crucial pole position for Sundays Chinese Grand Prix and a chance to lengthen his narrow Formula One championship lead over Michael Schumacher. 

With rain falling in Shanghai, defending champion Alonso led Saturdays qualifying with a time of 1:44.360 seconds at the 5.451km Shanghai International Circuit, almost 10 seconds slower than Fridays time in dry conditions. 

Alonsos Renault teammate Giancarlo Fisichella was second with 1:44.992. 

Ferraris Schumacher couldnt master the wet conditions and mustered only a sixth place finish, characterising the qualifying session as a damage limitation operation. 

We still have the race ahead of us and from the third row of the grid, said Schumacher, who plans to retire at the end of this season. We can still aim for a good result, given that in the dry, we have proved to be very competitive. 

Rain threatened throughout the morning, then fell harder just as qualifying began. Ominously for Ferrari, whose Bridgestone tyres have performed poorly in the wet, more rain is forecast for Sunday. 

The varying conditions didnt bother Alonso or Fisichella, with the Renaults finishing 1-2 in all three sections. 

Sundays formation marks the third time this year that Renault has occupied the entire front row of the grid. 

Hondas Rubens Barrichello, who won the inaugural Chinese GP in 2004, was third with 1:45.503. Schumacher clocked 1:45.775, just behind McLarens Kimi Raikkonen. 

Barrichello showed his good form in the wet. I love the wet, said the Brazilian, who posted a final period best lap of 1:45.503 seconds. 

His teammate Jenson Button finished in the same time down to the thousandth of a second, but Barrichello goes ahead for recording his time first.

 Scolari keeps options open

Stuttgart: Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari denied reports that he would quit after the World Cup, saying he was still discussing continuing. 

Theres a possibility I will stay and theres a possibility I wont, he told reporters on the eve of the third-place playoff against hosts Germany. 

Scolari has given Portugal a new cutting edge during his three-and-a-half-years as coach, leading the previously underachieving team to runners-up in the European Championship and the semi-finals of the World Cup. 

Their hopes of a first World Cup final appearance ended with Wednesdays 0-1 defeat to France. 

The Brazilian said that money was not his priority. 

At this stage in my life, I want sun, Bermuda shorts and sand, said Scolari, who won the World Cup with Brazil four years ago. 

He added: If I show you the offers Ive had in the last three years from clubs and other nationals, then I can say Ive lost a lot of money. 

But, in truth, Ive come out winning because of everything I have in Portugal, with the federation, the directors, the people who work with me and the players. 

I have a fantastic atmosphere with most of the Portuguese population and I couldnt ask for more. Money is not everything in life. 

He added: I did a lot of things in my life for financial motives. When I needed it, I chased after it and I saved it. Now, I have no worries in that sense. 

Earlier on Friday, a Portuguese sports daily had reported that Scolari would be leaving the job, although it said he might continue to live in the country.

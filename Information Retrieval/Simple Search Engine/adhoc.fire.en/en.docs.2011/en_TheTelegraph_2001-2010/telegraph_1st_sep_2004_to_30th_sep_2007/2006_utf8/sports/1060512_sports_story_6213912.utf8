 Not what the doctor ordered for McClaren

 - Sevilla outclass Middlesbrough to lift Uefa Cup 

HENRY WINTER IN EINDHOVEN

The matadors of Sevilla toyed with John Bull here on Wednesday night, brutally weakening an English side sent out by Steve McClaren with a goal in the first half, and then finishing Middlesbrough off with a series of brutal rapier thrusts late on (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition). The last 10 minutes must have felt like a wake for McClaren, let alone a farewell to Boro arms. 

McClarens Boro career began and ended with a 0-4 defeat. He has achieved much since that early drubbing by Arsenal, only to fall on the final furlong towards the promised land of Uefa Cup glory. 

Boros legion of fans had been here for the party, but for McClaren the assignment carried as much weight for country as club. Watching McClarens men being utterly outclassed was not what the Football Association had in mind when they installed the Boro manager as Englands head coach. 

Any chance of McClaren commencing his England era with his credibility enhanced by a Uefa Cup winners medal stood no chance in the teeth of Sevillas dexterous attacking, led by their outstanding right-back Daniel Alves, comfortably the man of an entertaining match. 

Here was the test for McClaren. His side was stretched to distraction in the first half, constantly troubled by the runs of Alves, who created Luis Fabianos 27th-minute headed goal, and the lively movement of midfielders like Adriano, Marti and Enzo Maresca. McClarens defence was too deep, his attack too distant and his over-run midfield simply being played around. 

McClaren was bold, throwing on striker after striker, Massimo Maccarone and then Ayegbeni Yakubu, but he missed one key replacement. George Boateng struggled in central midfield, leaving Fabio Rochemback to fight all the fires lit by Marti and company. Spaniards flooded through. 

While the heart went out to Steve Gibson, Boros chairman who has backed his beloved club with money and wisdom, one shuddered to imagine what this match had done for the heart rate of the FAs chief executive, Brian Barwick. 

Snubbed by Luiz Felipe Scolari, Barwick rushed into the eager arms of McClaren. As the Boro managers tactical tweaks failed to repel the gathering ignominy, the fear persisted that Barwicks decision to act in haste may mean he eventually repents at leisure, at Englands expense. 

The nimble Brazilian clipped over a magnificent 27th-minute cross that begged to be met by a Sevilla head. Luis Fabiano reached it first, seizing on slow reactions from Chris Riggott to bury a bullet header past Mark Schwarzer. 

Chances came and went, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink driving a free-kick over, Viduka flashing a shot wide and then Herbert Fandel ignoring legitimate-looking penalty claims when Viduka fell under Javi Navarros heavy challenge. Lady Luck, let alone a German referee, ignored Middlesbrough here. 

Yet Lord Logic demanded Sevilla were well worth their victory. Enzo Maresca began and ended a wonderful flowing break, working the ball to Alves, who in turn slid the ball inside to the sub, Fredi Kanoute. His shot was superbly saved by Schwarzer, but Maresca pounced to sweep in the rebound. 

Boros dreamwas sent hurtling towards oblivion by Maresca, who latched on to a Riggott clearance and squeezed a shot past Schwarzer. Kanoute then knocked in a fourth. 

Sevilla, worthy winners, set off on their raucous celebrations. Boro were buried, but will rise again. Gibson will guarantee that. McClaren, though, has plenty of proving to do with England.

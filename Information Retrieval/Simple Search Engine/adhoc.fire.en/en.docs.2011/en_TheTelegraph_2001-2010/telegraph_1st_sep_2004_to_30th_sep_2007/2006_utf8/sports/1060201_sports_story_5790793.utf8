 Inzy fit for ODI series

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq, who had to miss the ongoing Test here owing to a back problem, is fit for the five-match ODI series which starts in Peshawar on February 6. 

Inzy is fine... In fact, he has already communicated that hes available for the entire series, chief selector Wasim Bari told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

Bari and his colleagues will pick the ODI squad ? perhaps, for the first two/three matches to begin with ? on Thursday, the scheduled last day of the final Test.

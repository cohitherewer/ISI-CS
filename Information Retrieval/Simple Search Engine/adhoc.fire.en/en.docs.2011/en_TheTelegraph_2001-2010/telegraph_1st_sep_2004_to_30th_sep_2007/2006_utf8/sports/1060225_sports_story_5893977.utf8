 Sunny: 33 no age to quit

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Sunil Gavaskar have urged Sourav Ganguly not to consider quitting and to fight his way back. They spoke at a function by Aajkaal, to mark its silver jubilee, on Friday: 

BUDDHADEB BHATTACHARJEE: I know he must be feeling insulted and humiliated? We, too, are feeling humiliated, not because he is a Bengali, but because he is Sourav Ganguly. He has to play and prove his worth. He cannot leave the battlefield untried? He has to prove he is Sourav Ganguly. We are all with him. 

SUNIL GAVASKAR: Thirty-three is no age to quit. If that was the case, then I wouldnt have got my 34th hundred. I would only remind Sourav to let his bat do the talking. Only runs and performance count, though, sometimes it hasnt worked that way for him. But thats the way life is.

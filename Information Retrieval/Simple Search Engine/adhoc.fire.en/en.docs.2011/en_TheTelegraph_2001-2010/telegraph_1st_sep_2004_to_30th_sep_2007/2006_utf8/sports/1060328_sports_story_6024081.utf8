 Asif rocks Sri Lanka 

Colombo: Fast bowler Mohammed Asif and opening batsman Imran Farhat handed Pakistan the initiative in the opening Test against Sri Lanka on Monday. 

Asif snared four for 41 as Sri Lanka were skittled for a modest 185 and then the left-handed Farhat scored 69 from 90 balls to consolidate his teams advantage. 

Pakistan finished the first days play after Sundays total washout on 124 for four, trailing by 61 runs with captain Inzamam-ul Haq unbeaten on 30. 

Just after tea, Sri Lanka fought back as three top order wickets tumbled in quick succession and Pakistan slumped to 28 for three. Farhat and Inzamam rescued Pakistan with a 94-run stand though Sri Lanka did strike again just before bad light stopped play when Farhat skied a bouncer and was caught at long leg. 

Asif was well supported by Umar Gul (two for 41) and leg spinner Danish Kaneria (three for 44).

 Indian refs can only dream of Cup fees

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi: If there were some people on Wednesday who didnt really believe that Fifa has decided to double the referees payment for the forthcoming World Cup in Germany, it was the referees from India. Frankly, I read the news item that appeared in a local newspaper here twice before believing it, said a Delhi referee. 

After all, we have grown up in a system where accepting a pay cut at the start of every season is only a part of the normal procedure. For us, receiving a payment of 40,000 dollars for a month long tournament is a kind of dream that could never be realised. 

While the Indian referees welcome the Fifa move and feel it has once again underlined the importance of supervisors in modern day football, they say that All India Football Federation (AIFF) are completely moving in the opposite direction. 

The world body has increased the payment of referees by 100 per cent, but in India it has actually been decreased, says one of Indias Fifa supervisors. 

When the National Football League began in 1996, we used to receive Rs 3,000 for every month. Today, ten years later, the pay we get for one match is Rs 2,100. 

It was decided in 1996 that referees would receive Rs 1000 per day for every match for three days starting from a day before the match. 

Later, the payment was increased to Rs 1,200 per day, but the AIFF decided not to pay any money for the third (the day after the match), thus effectively reducing the match fee by Rs 600. 

It turned out to be the worst last season, said a referee.They further reduced the payment to Rs 800 for two days. The AIFF also pays a special allowance of Rs 500 on the day of the match, but in total it comes to only Rs. 2,100, which is much less than what we used to get ten years ago. We had no choice but to accept this cut, rues the referee. 

Things are no better at the Asian level. The payment structure for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) matches have not been reviewed for nearly a decade. 

For supervising in any AFC tournament match, the referees receive $100 per day for four days even though at times it takes more than four days for an outstation referee to get the connecting flight to his own country. 

The payment structure in AFC is same for the referees, assistant referees, match commissioners and the fourth officials. 

It is Fifa that offers the best deal to the referees. In the pre-World Cup matches this time, the referees were paid $500 per day. The allowance started from the moment the referee left his home and ended only after he returned to his residence. 

By Indian standards, every referee was richer by at least a couple of lakhs of rupees after every Fifa assignment. 

But then, Fifa does not show equal generosity towards other supervising staff. While the assistant referees receive $350 per day, the match commissioner gets only $200. 

It only proves that in the eyes of the world body, referees are the most important lot.

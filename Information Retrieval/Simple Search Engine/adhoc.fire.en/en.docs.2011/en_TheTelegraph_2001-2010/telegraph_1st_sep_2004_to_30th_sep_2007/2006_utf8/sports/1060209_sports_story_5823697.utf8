 Pakistan worried about County workload 

Islamabad: Pakistan cricket authorities will ask English Counties to avoid giving Pakistani players too heavy a workload this season before their tour. 

We have a full tour of England from mid June to September and we dont want our players who are signed on by Counties jaded or overworked before the series, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said on Wednesday. 

Pakistan play four Tests and five one-day Internationals in England, in addition to a number of side matches. Before visiting England, they will also tour Sri Lanka from March 12 to play two Tests and three one-dayers. 

The English County season begins from late April. 

Leg spinner Danish Kaneria and pacers Rana Naved-ul Hasan and Mohammed Asif have signed to play for Essex, Sussex and Leicestershire, respectively, this season. 

Senior batsman Mohammed Yousuf has had an offer to play for Derbyshire in the early part of the season. 

Captain Inzamam-ul-Haq said he was also worried about players workloads before the tour. 

I am especially concerned about Kaneria because last season he also bowled a lot of overs for Essex and the board had to write to them. We want him fresh for the Pakistan team, he said. 

Inzamam said Kaneria might be released to play for Essex during some of the side games. 

But he remains our most potent bowler and we dont want him joining us having bowled too many overs for Essex. The same thing applies to Rana and Asif, who will be required to do lot of bowling for Pakistan. (Reuters)

 ATP aims for more changes in 2007

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chennai: The changes ATP has brought in this year and some more they are planning for 2007 are aimed at making tennis a more entertainment-oriented sport. So said Brad Drewett, managing director, International Group. 

Defending the yearly calendar of events, Drewett didnt agree that it was too long and needed to be shortened. But for the eight who qualify for the year-end Masters Cup and the eight featuring in the Davis Cup final, the year for the others is over around mid-October. That gives most of them a two-and-a-half month break, which we think is fine, Drewett said. 

The facilities at CCI, a new Tour stop, came in for praise. The centre court is one of the most charming I have seen dotted by trees the courts and other facilities are excellent. 

India has a rich tennis tradition and we had been wanting to slot a second Tour event (after Chennai) we are delighted to have brought this one to Mumbai, Drewett said.

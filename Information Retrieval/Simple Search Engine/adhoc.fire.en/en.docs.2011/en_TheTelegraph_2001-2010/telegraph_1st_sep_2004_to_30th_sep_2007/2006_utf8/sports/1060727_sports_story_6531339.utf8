 BCCI defers Dalmiya hearing

 - Affidavit to be submitted in two weeks 

OUR LEGAL REPORTER/AGENCIES

Calcutta/New Delhi: The city civil court in Calcutta on Wednesday admitted the petition moved by Jagmohan Dalmiya for hearing, but refused to pass any interim order staying the notification asking him to appear before the BCCI disciplinary committee on Wednesday. 

Dalmiya had filed a suit on Tuesday, challenging the legality of the BCCI summons. Based on that, the BCCI deferred the hearing. Dalmiya had been asked to appear before a three-member committee (Sharad Pawar, Shashank Manohar and Chirayu Amin) on Wednesday afternoon for his alleged failure to answer showcause notices pertaining to 1996 World Cup accounts. 

The communication faxed by your lawyer Mr Soumendra Nath Banerjee was forwarded to the members of disciplinary committee. They have considered your request for adjourning the proceedings, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said in a letter addressed to Dalmiya. 

The committee felt that only filing of a suit without any interim order is no ground for adjournment of the matter. However, to give you a fair opportunity in the interest of justice, the proceedings are adjourned. The next date of hearing will be communicated to you in due course, the letter said. 

Dalmiya did not wish to comment since the matter was sub judice. 

Dalmiya, in his suit, had appealed to the city civil court that the BCCI notice dated July 17, which asked him to appear before the disciplinary committee at 1 pm on Wednesday, not be given effect to. 

When the matter came up for hearing, his lawyer informed the court that BCCIs act was vindictive. 

The case was moved by Shyamal Kumar Chatterjee and S.K. Banerjee before Justice P.K. Sarkar. No prayer was made for any ad interim order of injunction and only prayed for issuance of showcause notice to BCCI which the court granted. 

The court directed the BCCI to show cause within 15 days as to why appropriate orders as prayed shall not be granted. 

The BCCI will have to submit its affidavit by two weeks and fixed the matter for hearing after two weeks.

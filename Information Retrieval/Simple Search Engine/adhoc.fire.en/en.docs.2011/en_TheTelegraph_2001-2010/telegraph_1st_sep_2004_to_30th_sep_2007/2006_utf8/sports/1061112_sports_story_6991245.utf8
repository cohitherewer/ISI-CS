New Delhi: Sixteen-year-old Saina Nehwal, who lost to top seed Wang Yihan of China in the girls singles final at the World Junior Badminton Championships in South Korea on Saturday, is undoubtedly the countrys most promising shuttler after Aparna Popat.

Following is a list of current Indian world champions: 

 BILLIARDS 

Pankaj Advani: Nineteen-year-old Pankaj Advani outplayed compatriot Devendra Joshi 6-2 to win his maiden world title (points format) in Qawra (Malta) in March, 2005. He also won the time format title beating Geet Sethi in the final. Advani became only the second cueist after Maltas Paul Mifsud to have won both the billiards and snooker amateur world titles.

C. Mohineesh: The Visakhapatnam kid won the boys under-8 title, one of Indias five gold medals in the World Youth Chess Championship held in Batumi (Georgia) last month. Mohineesh won nine games and drew one against compatriot Prince Bajaj to tally an amazing 9.5 points (out of a maximum 10).

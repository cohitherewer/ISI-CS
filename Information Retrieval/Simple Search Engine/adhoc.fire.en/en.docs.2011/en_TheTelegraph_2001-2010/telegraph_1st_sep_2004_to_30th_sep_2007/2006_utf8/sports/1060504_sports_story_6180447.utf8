 Malik hopes to be fit by June

Islamabad: Pakistan allrounder Shoaib Malik, who recently underwent an elbow surgery, is confident of regaining full fitness before the tour of England in late June. 

I suffered pain in my right elbow while batting or bowling and it was one of the reasons why I had problems extending it properly, Malik said. 

I am happy that this problem is done with now. Im confident Ill be fit by the time the team leaves for England. Its a tour I have been looking forward to for a long time, he was quoted as saying by a Pakistan based news daily. 

The operation, which took place in Cape Town, removed floating bones from his right elbow and also repaired some tissues. He has been advised to rest for six to eight weeks before batting and bowling again. (PTI)

 Jeev tied 21st in Japan

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh went on a birdie spree after a none-too-good start to come one-under par 71 for the first round in the 150-million-yen Fujisankei Classic Golf on Thursday. 

Jeev fired three birdies in last five holes on the last stretch in his first tournament on the Japanese Tour after more than a month. 

The 34-year old was lying tied 21st at the 7,454 yards long Fujizakura Country Club. 

Nobuhiro Masuda, Shingo Katayama and Koichi Kashimura shared the lead at five-under 66. Four others including Prayad Marksaeng and Fijian Dinesh Chand were at four-under 67. 

Defending champion, Daisuke Maruyama, who recorded his first win in Japan at this event last year, shot three-under 68 and was tied eighth. 

He has had four top-10 finishes in US Tour this season.

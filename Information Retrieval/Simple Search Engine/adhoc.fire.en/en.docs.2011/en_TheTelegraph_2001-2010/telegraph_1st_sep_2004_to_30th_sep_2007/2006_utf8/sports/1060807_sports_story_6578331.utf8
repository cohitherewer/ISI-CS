 United win, but pay a price

Amsterdam: Manchester United won the pre-season Amsterdam Tournament after beating Ajax 1-0 on Saturday but paid a heavy price. 

Uniteds costly new signing, England midfielder Michael Carrick, suffered an ankle injury and left the ground on crutches. 

Hes going to be out for a few weeks, manager Alex Ferguson told a TV channel. 

Carrick was making only his second appearance for United since completing a 18.6 million move from Tottenham on Monday. 

The midfielder lasted just 16 minutes before being helped off after sustaining the injury. 

The winning goal came off a free-kick by Ryan Giggs, 14 minutes from time. The ball hit the bar and bounced back into play but the assistant referee ruled it had crossed the line. On Friday, United beat Porto 3-1 but had both Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes sent off. 

On Saturday, Inter Milan scored three first-half goals to beat Porto 3-2 to finish second in the tournament. (Reuters)

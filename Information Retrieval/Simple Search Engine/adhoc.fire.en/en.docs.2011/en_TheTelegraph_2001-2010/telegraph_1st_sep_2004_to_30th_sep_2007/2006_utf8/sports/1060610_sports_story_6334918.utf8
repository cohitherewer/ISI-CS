 Loopholes in German defence exposed

 OnTarget

A 4-2 scoreline in the opening match of a World Cup is always exciting, and in that sense, Germany have started their campaign on a confident note. The first match of any major tournament is always dangerous. Germany must have felt the pressure of playing at home. Home support has its merits and demerits. If the team fails to find a breakthrough or rise to the public expectation, the players always feel tense and edgy. 

Also, Germany were aware that Senegal produced one of the most sensational upsets against France in the opener of the 2002 World Cup. This fear appeared to be lurking at the back of their minds. 

Considering all this, I must say, Klinsmanns side was lucky to have got a goal in as early as the sixth minute. Philipp Lahm did well to come from behind and feigned two defenders before unleashing a thunderous shot, beating the goalkeeper all ends up. If the goal was all about individual brilliance, Wanchopes equaliser was the perfect execution of a marvellous move ? the example of a team effort. It started around the central line and after 4-5 one-touch passes, Wanchope burst ahead timely, leaving the German backline stranded. 

Within five minutes, Klose ? who celebrated his 28th birthday on Friday ? scored an opportunistic goal, being at the right place at the right time. 

After the break, Klose showed another moment of opportunism in handing his team the 3-1 lead. The Costa Rican keeper thwarted his first attempt, but the striker showed his opportunism and agility to snap up the rebound. 

Just when Germany started breathing easy, Wanchope struck again ? converting Costa Ricas only second constructive move of the match. Eventually, it was left to Torsten Frings goal of the match ? a pile-driver from about 30 yards ? in giving Germany the 4-2 win. 

True, scoring as many as four goals in the first match will surely give Germany a lot of confidence, but Wanchopes double strike proved that their backline still needs to improve. On both occasions, the defenders were standing in parallel position, watching the ball instead of the man. Wanchope is no Ronaldo or Adriano and is Costa Ricas lone quality striker. So, there should have been a covering for him. 

Perhaps Klinsmann being a striker himself, the focus has been on the attacking and not much on defensive organisation. Costa Rica were committed to a lets-not-concede-more-goals style, and therefore, we hardly saw any support play from defender to midfield or midfield to the attacking third. 

Despite the win, Klinsmann needs to plug some loopholes in the midfield and defence immediately. Otherwise, quality teams like England or Brazil may wreck havoc in their defence. Ballack was surely missed, and thats why we hardly saw a constructive move from the midfield. Lets see, how his presence in the next matches inspire Germany to a more organised and flawless display.

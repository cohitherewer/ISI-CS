 King has too much power: Roberts

St Johns: Former West Indies fast bowler Andy Roberts has questioned the criteria for picking the national squad while suggesting that coach Bennett King enjoyed too much power. Roberts, who has also served as a regional team selector, said a coach should not have absolute powers. 

On whether he felt the Australia-born King, who has been in the job for 19 months, had too much say on selection matters, Roberts said: I think so. 

As a former coach, we didnt have a quarter or one-tenth of the power Bennett has. He negotiated that, so be it. But if he wants that and I know what I want for my cricketers, I am not going to go along with that, he said. 

Meanwhile, Pedro Collins was named as replacement for Fidel Edwards in a 13-member West Indies squad for the second Test. (PTI)

 Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Ramesh Powar in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday 

Kuala Lumpur: Yuvraj Singh, who arrived on Thursday morning, has said he will require a couple of days to get into rhythm. 

 I suppose Im going to need a couple of days... Physically, however, Im feeling fine, Yuvraj told The Telegraph at the team hotel, before setting out for the Kinrara Oval. Its unclear whether he will be available for Indias next match against Australia, on Saturday. 

At the ground, Yuvraj had a light workout his first in many days. 

Yuvraj didnt leave with the team from Chennai, late last Saturday, owing to the after-effects of viral fever. He clarified there had been no reaction to medication.

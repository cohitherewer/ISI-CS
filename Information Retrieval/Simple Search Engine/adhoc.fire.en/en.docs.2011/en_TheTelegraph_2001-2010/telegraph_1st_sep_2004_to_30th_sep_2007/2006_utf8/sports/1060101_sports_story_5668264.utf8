 Doubles wild card for Amritraj, Bopanna

Chennai: The Chennai fans will get a chance to cheer for their home team with Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna getting wild cards in the main draw of the doubles event of the Chennai Open Tennis Tournament beginning here on Monday. 

We are pleased to announce that Prakash Amritraj and Rohan Bopanna have accepted a wild card for the Chennai Open 2006 doubles draw, the organisers said in a statement on Saturday. 

Legendary Vijay Amritraj said the two players have a good co-ordination and that should work for them. 

Both Prakash and Rohan share a great relationship off the court and I am sure it will help their game together on the court. The good part is that Rohan plays a deuce court and Prakash a back court game and this equation should work well for them, he said. 

Rohan has one of the fastest serves on the Indian circuit and complements his big serve with smooth flowing strokes on both flanks of the court and has very strong forehands. 

Among the other Indian challengers Leander Paes will be playing with Martin Damm of Czech Republic. Mahesh Bhupathi will, however, not take part in the meet as he will be busy playing in Doha. 

Prakash and Rohan have grabbed it as a great opportunity to play in front of their home crowd. 

This is great opportunity for us. We would like to thank the organisers for giving us a chance to play in front of our fans. We will put forward our best efforts to match up to their expectations and start the year on a winning note, the duo, who had an impressive last season, said.

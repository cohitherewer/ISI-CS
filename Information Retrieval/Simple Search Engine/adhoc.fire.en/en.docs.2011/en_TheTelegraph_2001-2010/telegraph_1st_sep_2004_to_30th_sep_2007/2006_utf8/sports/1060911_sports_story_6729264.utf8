 Schumi to quit at end of season

Monza: Michael Schumacher, seven-time world champion and the most successful Formula One driver of all time, said on Sunday that he was retiring from the sport at the end of the season. 

Ferrari announced the Germans decision just minutes after Schumacher won the Italian Grand Prix. 

Kimi Raikkonen, who finished on second spot, has been named as Schumachers replacement following his three-year contract. The 26-year-old Finnish driver moves over from McLaren-Mercedes, where he is finishing his fifth season. 

It has been a really tough decision not to work together at this level but I knew that one day it had to come, Schumacher said after closing to within two points of leader Fernando Alonso in the drivers standings. 

Schumacher said he had decided to quit over two months ago after the Indianapolis Grand Prix on July 2. 

I decided after Indy and after Indy I informed the team, the 37-year-old told a post-race news conference. 

I dont want to go away while I am over it that is one of the reasons why I am leaving now, said the German. 

Schumacher, who picked up his 90th race win on Sunday, said the contractual situation of teammate Felipe Massa had contributed to the timing of his decision. 

The German said that after Ferrari had made their decision to sign Finn Kimi Raikkonen from McClaren for next season, Massa needed to know my plans so that he could negotiate. Massa has extended his deal with Ferrari until 2008. 

Asked what he would miss most about the sport when he was gone from competition, Schumacher remained silent for several seconds and after taking a deep breath said only excuse me. 

Meanwhile, Schumacher was called a legend by figures within Formula One on after he announced his decision. He will become a legend as a driver, Ferrari director Jean Todt said. Michael has been the author of a unique chapter in the history of Formula One. 

You have to recognise hes been a great champion, Red Bull driver David Coulthard said. Its the end of an era. It was a fitting way for him to announce it with a victory, Coulthard added. 

In Germany, Schumacher was praised as one of the greatest sports personalities of his era. 

 Franz Beckenbauer, the former soccer star and Germanys 

 most popular sports personality, said Schumachers 

 retirement was a pity. Its always 

 too bad when such a great personality steps down, 

 he said.

 SOME OF ... THE 

 BEST

 Belgium 1992

 Schumachers first race 

 win, in the wet, and one in which he showed all his tactical 

 brilliance. Overtaken by Benetton teammate Martin Brundle 

 after sliding off, Schumacher noticed that the Britons 

 tyres were worn out. Reckoning that his must be as well, 

 he pitted immediately for rain tyres. It was a masterstroke 

 of timing that won him the race. 

 Belgium 1995

 A victory from 16th place on 

 the starting grid in changing conditions and with the German 

 staying out on slick tyres in the wet. The outcome was also 

 tainted by controversy, with the German receiving a suspended 

 one-race ban for weaving on the straights to prevent Damon 

 Hill overtaking.

 Europe 1995

 In his last race in Europe for 

 Benetton, Schumacher reeled in Jean Alesi and overtook him 

 two laps from the finish to win in front of his home fans 

 at the Nuerburgring in a race hailed as the greatest of 

 his second championship year.

 Spain 1996 

 Schumachers first win for 

 Ferrari, again in the rain, and he lapped the entire field 

 bar the two men on the podium with him although 

 he was 45 seconds clear of second placed Alesi. If 

 anyone had asked me how much I would bet on me winning here 

 I would have said not one penny, declared Schumacher.

 Hungary 1998 

 An inspired drive, coupled with 

 a three-stop strategy at a circuit where overtaking is deemed 

 almost impossible. Schumacher had to drive a series of sprints 

 after technical director Ross Brawn asked him to make up 

 25 seconds in 19 laps. Schumacher replied Thank You 

 and did just that.

 Japan 2000 

 The race that clinched Schumachers 

 first title for Ferrari, ending their 21 year wait for a 

 drivers crown. Schumacher had trailed McLaren rival 

 Mika Hakkinen for almost 40 laps before getting ahead with 

 pit stop strategy. Not the most thrilling of races, but 

 one of the most emotional.

 ... THE WORST

 Australia 1994

 Schumacher faced furious accusations 

 of cheating after an infamous collision with Briton Damon 

 Hill in the title-deciding Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide. 

 The incident on the 31st of 81 laps knocked both drivers 

 out of the race and Schumacher won the crown by one point.

 Europe 1997

 Another collision, this time 

 at Jerez with Schumacher trying to ram Canadian Jacques 

 Villeneuve off the track in the title-decider. This time 

 it backfired, Villeneuve won the championship and Schumacher 

 was excluded from the final classification.

 Austria 2002 

 A black day for Formula One, with 

 world-wide outrage after Ferrari ordered Rubens Barrichello, 

 who had dominated the entire weekend and led from start 

 to finish, to slow and allow Schumacher to win. He did so 

 at the last corner. There was no need for it. The German 

 had won four of the five previous races and ended up winning 

 the title by a record margin.

 ... AND A BIT OF BOTH

 Monaco 2006

 Schumacher again revived accusations of cheating when 

 he was sent to the back of the grid for deliberately blocking 

 the track in the dying seconds of qualifying, preventing 

 rivals from beating him to pole position. He atoned for 

 it during the race, storming through to finish fifth and 

 with the fastest lap.

 CA urges Hair to continue

Sydney: Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has urged Darrell Hair to continue umpiring following repeated complaints from Pakistan about his role in the ball tampering row. 

Sutherland refused to be drawn on the incidents which led to Pakistan forfeiting the final Test against England in response to being penalised five runs for ball tampering, but said the Australian official had his full support. 

Sutherland said he had personally e-mailed Hair at the height of the controversy and hoped he would continue umpiring despite being under pressure to quit. 

Meanwhile, in Dubai, thousands of fans have signed an online petition calling on the ICC to sack Australian Darrell Hair from the elite panel of umpires. Launched less than a week ago, there has been unprecedented support from cricket fans from around the world for this petition. Organised and run by pakistancricketnews.com, the petition says Hairs days as a top-level umpire should be brought to an end, a Dubai daily reported citing a press release from the portal.

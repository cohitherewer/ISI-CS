 SA have NZ on ropes

Johannesburg: Makhaya Ntini took five for 35 and Dale Steyn three for 35 to dismiss New Zealand for 119 on the first day of the third and final Test on Friday. 

Captain Graeme Smith then scored 63 and Hashim Amla 56 to take South Africa to 133 for four before play was halted by bad light 13 overs early. 

Stephen Fleming top-scored with 46 and the 55 he shared with Nathan Astle for the fourth wicket was New Zealands best partnership. 

Four New Zealanders were dismissed without scoring. 

South Africa lead the series 1-0 after Ntini took 10 wickets in a 128-run first Test win.

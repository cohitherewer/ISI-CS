The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Theres more responsibility and Ive accepted it, says Clarke 

 - The captaincy issue is something thats farthest from my mind... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Michael Clarke 

Kuala Lumpur: Michael Clarke had already played quite a bit of one-day cricket when he made his Test debut, against India (in Bangalore), almost two years ago. It became memorable, for he got an excellent 151 which helped Australia win without much of a bother. Since then, the MoM on Test debut has had ups-and-downs, but is still seen as somebody to be counted upon. And, of course, hes regarded as captaincy material. On Wednesday, Clarke had an interaction largely with the Australian Media and, then, spoke briefly to The Telegraph at the Traders Hotel. 

 The following are excerpts 

 On whether some of 

 the pressure, at the start of the season, is off after top-scoring 

 (81) in the first match 

 Thats one way of looking 

 at it... However, whats more satisfying is that I 

 had a reasonably long hit... After weeks of pre-season training, 

 it was nice to actually go out in the middle... Im 

 more happy about that, not the runs I got. 

 On the West Indies

 Theyre a good team, make 

 no mistake. 

 On 2006-07 being a huge season 

 Of course, it is... The two biggest 

 one-day tournaments (Champions Trophy and the World Cup), 

 with the Ashes in between. Im motivated to do the 

 best I can. 

 On whether his role has, in the past two 

 years, changed 

 With experience, roles change... 

 A couple of years ago, I was finding my feet... Today, theres 

 more responsibility and Ive accepted it... Im 

 not so old, though, Im just 25! Moreover, I continue 

 to learn. 

 On Australian crickets USP

 The domestic structure is our 

 strength, from the level of juniors upwards... Thanks to 

 that, quality players are ready to step in when theres 

 a vacancy... As a team, we bond really well. 

 Ricky Pointing

 On captain Ricky Pontings 

 decision to publicly apologise for showing dissent in the 

 tri-series opener 

 My respect for him has gone up 

 even more... To accept that an action was wrong and, then, 

 to apologise... Thats the ultimate... He wants us 

 to be the best in all respects, to be the most disciplined... 

 Ricky believes that discipline has to be one of our strengths. 

 [Ponting, incidentally, is one of the cricketers Clarke 

 admires. Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara are the others. 

 As a kid, he used to idolise Michael Slater.] 

 On playing alongside Glenn McGrath 

 (Laughs) I wish I could play all 

 my life with him... Hes a great bowler and a great 

 teammate... One of the gains yesterday (Tuesday) was his 

 strong comeback... He hasnt indicated when he intends 

 to retire, I suppose that will be when hes 45! (After 

 a pause) Ive spoken about the quality of players 

 ready to step in and somebody like Mitchell Jonhson confirmed 

 that yesterday, in what was only his sixth ODI. 

 On Andrew Flintoff being named Englands 

 captain for the Ashes 

 Hes a great player and we 

 respect him... Any team which has a Flintoff or a Ponting 

 or a McGrath or a Shane Warne is going to be strong... Right 

 now, however, Im not thinking of the Ashes... Our 

 immediate priority is this tournament and the Champions 

 Trophy, which begins next month... Yes, Ill be thinking 

 about the Ashes once we get closer to the start. We do want 

 the Ashes... 

 Finally, on having been the vice-captain (in Mike 

 Husseys absence) in the season-opener and always being 

 talked about as somebody who could captain Australia sooner 

 rather than later 

 It was an honour yesterday, definitely, 

 but the captaincy issue is something thats farthest 

 from my mind... Ive got a role and am intent on exclusively 

 focusing on that... The captaincy thing isnt at the 

 back of my mind.

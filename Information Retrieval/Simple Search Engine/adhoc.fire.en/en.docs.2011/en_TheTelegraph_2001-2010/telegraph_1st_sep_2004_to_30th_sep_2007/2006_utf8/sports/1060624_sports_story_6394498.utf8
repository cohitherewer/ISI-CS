 Socceroos dealt the best cards

 - Aussies pushed past chaos to make Round II

Amid the madness in Stuttgart Thursday night, as Graham Poll, the English referee, saw this astonishing match cascade out of his control, Australia qualified for the second round for the first time with a point that proved that although they may be relative football novices, the nations traditional sporting hallmarks ? determination, athleticism and a never-say-die attitude ? hold true in this game as much as any other. 

It was a triumphant end for Australia but an awful one for Poll, who showed Josip Simunic, the Croatia defender, a second yellow card near the end but failed to produce the red, so Simunic stayed on until the last seconds, when he was booked for a third time and at last saw red. 

There was always likely to be a potential flashpoint, not just because of the significance with Croatia needing a win and Australia a draw to progress from group F but also given the close relations between the teams. 

All the players cleared the first hurdle: not singing the other countrys national anthem by mistake. Two of Croatias squad were born in Australia, while another studied at the Australian Institute of Sport and seven of Australias roster are of Croatian descent. 

The choice of Poll as referee was surprising as he is familiar to the Australians who play in the Barclays Premiership. Mark Viduka was incandescent early on when the Englishman failed to give a penalty after the Middlesbrough striker was manhandled by Simunic. 

Poll did point to the spot later in the half, though, when Stjepan Tomas crassly handled a cross. Craig Moore, the Newcastle United defender, thumped home the penalty in the 38th minute, and Croatia rediscovered the ambition that had vanished as early as the second minute when Darijo Srnas marvellous free-kick gave them a dramatic lead.

 Time Dravid exerted himself: Shastri

 Shastri 

Dubai: Rahul Dravid has come under flak from former captain Ravi Shastri who said it was time he asserted himself and called the shots instead of coach Greg Chappell. 

Its time Dravid exerted himself and told Chappell that in future he will call the shots, Shastri said in the wake of Indias disastrous showing in the Kuala Lumpur tri-series. 

A coach must only help the captain but the final decision must rest with Dravid. He should decide who should bat at No. 3 and not the coach, he was quoted as saying in a newspaper Sunday. 

The cricketer-turned-commentator said Dravid should be allowed to field an XI of his choice. 

Dravid should stand up and say that he is the boss and that he controls matters once he crosses the boundary line. He should get an XI of his choice, he said. 

Shastri also slammed Chappells experiments with the batting orders of Virender Sehwag and Dravid which, he believed put paid to Indias chances in the tri-series. 

Its time Chappell stopped his experiments with the team. I cannot understand how he could send Sehwag at No. 4. I will always prefer Sehwag as an opener. If he gets going even three out of ten times, it would bring victory to the team, he said. 

He said Chappells decision to make Dravid open was shocking. 

To ask Dravid, known as the worlds finest middle-order batsman, to open the innings, is a big blunder. One must have a solid batsman like Dravid coming in at No. 4.

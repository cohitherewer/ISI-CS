 Im the oldest, not the slowest: Schumi

Shanghai: Michael Schumacher was over the moon after a Chinese Grand Prix victory that returned him to the top of Formula One and fuelled his hopes of retiring with an eighth title. 

From the last three races, this was the one race that gave me the most headaches about what could happen because in the past we didnt always do well here, he told a post-race news conference. 

Thats behind us now. And I think there are races now coming that are better suited for us. We need everyone out there to cross their fingers for us and then well get it. 

Schumacher had started sixth on the grid after performing heroics in qualifying when he was the only driver on Bridgestone tyres in the top 10. 

Renaults Fernando Alonso, last years winner, had started on a pole and led from the start. 

It was more than I had wished for being able to hold my position at the start and then I was able to overtake a few, Schumacher told a German TV channel. 

I went into the race today with the motto of damage limitation. That I was able to get the victory makes it all the more beautiful... Its quite a miracle we are there. 

I am the oldest driver in the field. I can live quite well with that. Fortunately Im not the slowest, he said of the rivalry between him and Alonso that has seen the Spaniard question his sportsmanship.

Calcutta: There was a sense of optimism in the Bengal ranks at practice on Thursday that was hard to miss. This positive attitude is their biggest forte going into the Ranji Trophy semi-final against Baroda from Friday. 

From a team just about managing to cling on to the Elite group last season to making the last four this time around, the transformation has been hard to fathom. The nucleus of the side has remained the same, but new coach Paras Mhambrey has made a world of difference. His mental make-up and ability to motivate the players have been exceptional and the results are showing. 

As captain Deep Dasgupta said, everyone in the team has been contributing. If Avishek Jhunjhunwala and Subhamoy Das did it in their last match, the others ? Ranadeb Bose, Shib Shankar Paul, Deep himself, Rohan Gavaskar and Sourashish Lahiri ? have also played their part during the season. 

The uncertainty over Rohans availability is a cause for concern. The former captain was down with temperature and skipped Thursdays mornings practice. His condition will be assessed on Friday, but blood tests have revealed nothing unusual. If Rohan doesnt make it, Kamal Hasan Mondal will get into the XI. 

Baroda will be no pushovers and the hosts are aware of the task at hand. The group B champions havent lost a match this season and qualified for the knockout stage with three straight victories. They garnered 19 points from six matches, the highest tally by any of the 15 Elite division teams. 

Despite the absence of the injured Satyajit Parab, Baroda will not be short of batsmen who have been among runs. Captain Jacob Martin has 486 runs this season while wicketkeeper Pinal Shah is second at 377 from five games. 

The bowling, too, looks formidable. 

Well treat it as just another game? Just go out and enjoy it. Baroda could well have been in our group and we would then have had to play against them as any other team, remarked a relaxed Deep. 

Mhambrey also played down all talk about his battle with rival Balwinder Singh Sandhu. This is not about individuals. The team is doing well and Ill have to focus on my job. This match is not about two coaches? For me, the most important thing is my team. 

The pitch, with a tinge of green, appeared to be a typical Eden track, though a bit of rolling and trimming still remained to be done. Whatever the conditions, the first innings lead will be crucial. The approach will be the same?The basic idea will be to gain the lead. Once that is achieved, other things will fall into place, said Deep.

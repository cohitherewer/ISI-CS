 Prakash on Spectacular Quest 

Bangalore: Spectacular 

 Quest, hardly known for his sprinting abilities, scored 

 a handsome victory in Saturdays showpiece, the 1,200m 

 The Hindu Sprinters Cup. B. Prakash partnered the 

 less-fancied S.Ganapathy-trained ward to a shade under three-length 

 victory over Adams Star and Stara Zagora ? both Mumbai 

 nominees.

 Spectacular Quest, who travelled in the mid group, slowly inched his way up towards the frontrunning Caprese and Opera Queen as the horses entered the straight. Despite hanging out a bit, Spectacular Quest responded well to the urgings of Jockey B. Prakash and produced a scintillating turn of foot in a trice to burst into lead and sealed the issue a long way from home. Adams Star flashed on to the scene from behind. The frontrunning Caprese went down like a punctured balloon while Hesperus gave a poor account of himself. 

 In the 3,000m Stayers Cup, Forever Elegance demonstrated her staying prowess by decimating the opposition. Kept well off the pace, Forever Elegance came into his own entering the straight, even as Aperitivo hit the front rounding the final bend. But Prakash switched gears on the five-year-old mare, who responded well. 

 The victory of the two MAM Ramaswamy-owned horses also justified the myth that the Bangalore race-track is a tough place for visiting horses. The supremacy of the local brigade was complete during the afternon.

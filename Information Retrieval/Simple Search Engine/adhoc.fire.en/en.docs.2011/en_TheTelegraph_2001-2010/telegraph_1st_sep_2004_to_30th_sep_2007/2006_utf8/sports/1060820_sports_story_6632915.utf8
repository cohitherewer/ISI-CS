 BCCI works out extra ties

Mumbai: Team India will get to play some extra ODIs at home next January-February, following the BCCIs decision to host two bilateral series instead of a tri-series in the lead-up to the World Cup. 

We have decided to hold two bilateral series, consisting of eight to ten matches, against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, in January-February instead of the previously planned tri- series to give all the teams a chance to play more ODIs before the World Cup, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Saturday. 

Our tour of South Africa ends on January 7 and we plan to give the players 10-15 days rest before (back-to-back) series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka, he said. 

Shah said the idea was to finish off the two series, at least one of which will be a five-game affair, by February 17 or 18 to give the players time to recover for the March 13-April 28 World Cup. (PTI)

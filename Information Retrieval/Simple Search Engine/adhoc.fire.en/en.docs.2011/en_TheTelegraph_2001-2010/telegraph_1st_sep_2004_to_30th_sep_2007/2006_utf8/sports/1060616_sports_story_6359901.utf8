The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We never give up... thats the message: Beckham

Nuremberg: England had to endure 83 minutes of frustration against Trinidad amp; Tobago before Peter Crouch and then Steven Gerrard powered them into the World Cup second round with a hard-earned 2-0 Group B win on Thursday. 

Captain David Beckham floated a perfect ball from the right to the far post where Crouch headed the first powerfully into the net. With a minute remaining Gerrard made sure with a left-foot drive from the edge of the box. 

The three points followed a scrappy 1-0 win over Paraguay on Saturday and ensures England will finish first or second, depending on their final match with Sweden on Tuesday. We never give up, Beckham told reporters. Thats the message we give out ? thats the message we always give out. 

We knew if we kept to our game plan wed break them down. And the good thing about the game was that we finished strongly. 

Theres always tension when you are expected to win. The plus of the game is that we got those goals in the second half which we havent being doing lately. 

Until their late charge in the last seven minutes, England had looked likely to follow in the path of the Swedes who had proved unable to break down the Caribbean outsiders. 

England were boosted by the long-awaited return of Wayne Rooney fom a broken foot. 

His 58th minute arrival, met with loud cheers by Englands fans, came hours after two medical experts had pronounced him fit to play after a faster than expected recovery from a broken foot. 

England looked sharper with Rooney and fellow substitute Aaron Lennon on the pitch, but their finishing remained poor and the well-organised Soca Warriors defended in numbers attempting to get a draw. 

Striker Michael Owen, who lasted only 55 minutes against Paraguay and is far from his best after long-term injury, ballooned an early chance when Frank Lampards shot was only parried by Shaka Hislop. 

England, looking much better than on Saturday, kept stringing their passes together but could only create half-chances against some determined defending. 

Crouch nearly tipped the ball past Hislop at the far post after a Joe Cole cross. Beckham aimed a series of corners at John Terry to no avail and the Warriors defence also charged down his free kicks. 

England squandered two great chances before the break, though, when Lampard skied an Owen cut back from close range and Crouch fluffed a volley from Beckhams inviting cross, his shot heading towards the corner flag.

 Shah: Guwahati may escape ICC censure

 - Crowd Trouble 

New Delhi: Guwahati could escape censure from the International Cricket Council (ICC) with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Thursday, saying the games world governing body might take a lenient view of the crowd trouble witnessed there during the recent India-England one-dayer. 

What happened at Guwahati was not something serious. The important thing is that none of the players received any injury. Had the players been involved, then it would have been a serious issue, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here. 

What happens during football matches in England and elsewhere is worse. We do not think any action would be taken against the centre, he said. 

The ICC has slapped a show cause on BCCI, asking why action should not be taken against Guwahati for the serious breach of security during the one-dayer on April 9. 

Shah said BCCI had forwarded the show cause to the Assam Cricket Association and were awaiting a reply. 

We are yet to hear from them, Shah said. 

The April 9 tie was called off by the umpires because of damp ground conditions, a decision that incensed a section of the crowd at the Nehru Stadium which turned unruly, throwing missiles to the ground and burning posters in the galleries.

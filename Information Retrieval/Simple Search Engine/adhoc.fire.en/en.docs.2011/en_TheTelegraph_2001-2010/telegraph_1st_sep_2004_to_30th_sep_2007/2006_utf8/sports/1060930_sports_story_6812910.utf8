 Jeev slips to tied fourth 

Shizuoka: Jeev Milkha Singh hung on in windy conditions to card a one-over 72 for a tied fourth place after the second round of the Coca Cola Tokai Classic here on Friday. 

Jeevs effort saw him end the day with a two-round score of one-under 141 and just five shots behind Ike-Je Chang of Korea (67). 

With strong winds blowing, finding the fairway was rather difficult and Jeev managed only eight of the 14 fairways on par-4 and par-fives. When he did get onto to the greens, Jeev did well, needing just 27 putts for the second successive day. 

Jeev, second overnight, began disastrously with two bogeys in first three holes on second and third. He recovered slightly with a birdie on sixth, but again dropped a shot on par-3 13th hole. Fortunately, he knocked in a long birdie putt on 14th to come to one-over which is where he finished for the day. 

Katumasa Miyamoto (69) was tied second with special invitee Camilo Villegas (69) of Colombia at three-under total of 139. Hiroo kawai (70) and Satoru Hirota (71) were tied with Jeev at fourth at one-under 141.

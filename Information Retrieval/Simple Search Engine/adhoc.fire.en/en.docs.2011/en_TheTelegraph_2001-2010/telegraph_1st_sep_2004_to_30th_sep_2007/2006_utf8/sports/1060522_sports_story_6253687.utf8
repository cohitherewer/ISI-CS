Macau: Indias Ashok Kumar was hit by the wind as he finished six-over 77 and tumbled to tied 35th at the $300,000 Macau Open on Sunday. 

Other Indians in fray also had a tough time as Amandeep Johl (76) was tied 42nd, S. S. P. Chowrasia had a round of 76 and was tied 44th, Arjun Singh (81) was tied 56th and Digvijay Singh (78) was tied 63rd. 

It was one of the worst results for Indians in this years Asian Tour. Seven of the 12 Indian starters, including Shiv Kapur, had missed the cut. 

I learnt a lot of lessons last week at Aamby Valley and now this was another experience playing in such tough conditions, said Ashok. 

Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra had a disastrous front nine but recovered somewhat on the back nine to card a two-over 72 that brought him down to tied 24th after three rounds in the $6 million Bank of America Colonial tournament, another report adds from Fort Worth.

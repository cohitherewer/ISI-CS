 Crucial for me to lead the way: Kumble

Gros Islet: Old warhorse Anil Kumble is determined to lead the way for his young bowlers after having put India in a winning position in the second Test. 

I am senior and a key member of the side having played for this long. The pressure is on everyone and more so on me. Its important for me to lead the way, the ace leg-spinner said after the third days play. 

Kumble, who took three wickets in West Indies first innings to cross Courtney Walsh (519 wickets) as the fourth highest wicket-taker in the history of Test cricket, was confident that India would dismiss the Caribbeans in the second innings to take a 1-0 lead in the four-Test series. 

There are a lot of overs, so we definitely expect to pick up the nine remaining wickets. 

Kumble acknowledged the support he received from Munaf Patel, VRV Singh and Virender Sehwag, who played their part in dismissing West Indies for 215 in their first innings, forcing them to follow on. 

He (Sehwag) again gave us the breakthrough and has been bowling well. We would again need his help on Day IV. 

Both Munaf and VRV have done really well. Theyve put the ball in good areas consistently. Its a matter of time before VRV gets the results, the veteran said. Kumble found the pitch extremely slow and wicket-taking a hard grind. 

Its on the slower side. Its a wicket-to-wicket type of pitch. The odd ball is keeping low. There is little bit of spin. But the total of 588 has been a help (in keeping pressure). 

You definitely need to work harder here. These days I rely on varying the pace and bowling according to conditions, Kumble said. 

West Indian opener Daren Ganga was fulsome in his praise of the Indian leg-spin champion. Its a big challenge. He is very consistent in his length, bowls a lot straighter than other spinners. 

It brings into equation leg before wicket, bowled and caught behind. So there are a lot of factors which come in as compared to other orthodox leg-spinners, the Trinidad player said. (Agencies)

 Banned duo plans to appeal 

Karachi: Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were planning to appeal against the ban imposed on them by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for doping offence. 

Shoaib would fight his case on grounds that that he did not take the steroid intentionally, Tauseef Razzak, personal trainer of the bowler said on Thursday. 

Shoaib is devastated by the decision of the tribunal. His career would be over if the ban stays. He is consulting his lawyers to make an appeal because he has maintained he did not take the banned substances intentionally, Tauseef said. 

A PCB tribunal, headed by legal eagle Shahid Hamid, found Akhtar and Mohammed Asif guilty of taking banned steroid nandrolone. While Shoaib was handed a two-year ban from international and domestic cricket, Asif was punished for one year. 

The tribunal, however, has given the players and even the PCB seven days to lodge an appeal against the suspensions. 

A PCB source said on Thursday that chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf and Saleem Altaf, the director (cricket operations) would decide whether to go ahead with an appeal. 

The source said that Asif was also contemplating to appeal against the ban and was consulting his close aides on his next step. (PTI)

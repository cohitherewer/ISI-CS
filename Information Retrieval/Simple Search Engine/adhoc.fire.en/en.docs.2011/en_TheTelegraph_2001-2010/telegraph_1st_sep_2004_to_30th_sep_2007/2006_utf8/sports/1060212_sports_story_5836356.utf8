 Vaughan ready for India battle

London: Michael Vaughan will step on to a plane for India on Sunday relishing the prospect of swapping full-time fathers duties for 24x7 cricket. 

From the moment we arrive in Mumbai its going to be cricket 24x7, he said. 

You wont be able to get away from it. Its a great, great place to play, but when I look around our team there arent that many who have played out there before so its a great challenge for us. 

There are a lot of young players in this squad and a lot of energy and were going to need a lot of that in hard conditions. 

Our expertise might not be as good as their expertise on their home soil so we have to make up for it in other areas to try and develop a way of winning that is slightly different.

 Dias moving to England

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Former India star and Dempo Sports Club midfielder Jules Alberto Dias has decided to immigrate to England and is leaving on Friday. 

According to Dempo sources, Jules has informed about his departure to coach Armando Colaco only on Thursday. 

I am taking off with a heavy heart. It feels bad, really bad, he reportedly told a shocked Colaco. 

I was due to leave in February but shouldered on as Dempo couldnt do without my services. I cannot delay it any further, he said. 

Jules, who had played for Salgaocar, Fransa and Mahindra United with distinction before joining Dempo, is best remembered for his superb goal against United Arab Emirates in Indias memorable victory in the World Cup qualifiers in 2001.

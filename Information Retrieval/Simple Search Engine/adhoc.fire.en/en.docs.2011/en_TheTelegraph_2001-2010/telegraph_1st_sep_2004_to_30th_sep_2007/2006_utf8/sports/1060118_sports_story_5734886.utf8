 Anand in sole lead after win

 - WIJK AAN ZEE MEET 

 Humpy loses 

 Anand defeated Ivanchuk 

Wijk Aan Zee (Netherlands): Vishwanathan Anand shot to the sole lead in the Corus Super Grandmasters Chess tournament after defeating Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine in the third round of the competition. 

With his second victory with black pieces on the trot, Anand took his tally to 2.5 points out of a possible three and snatched the lead from Ivanchuk who had been thus far sitting pretty with two victories in the first two rounds. 

World champion Veselin Topalov was a bit lucky to get a full point against the highest rated Frenchman Etienne Bacrot and remained on Anands heels with 2 points in his kitty. 

Also making merry were Israeli Boris Gelfand who brought down Michael Adams of England, and worlds youngest ever grandmaster Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine who scored over Russian turned American Gata Kamsky. 

After the third round, Anand is now trailed by Topalov and Ivanchuk who both have two points apiece. Not far behind are Adams, Gelfand, Karjakin world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan, Loek van Wely and defending champion Peter Leko of Hungary who all are on 1.5 points each. 

With 10 rounds still to come in the category-19 all-play-all event, the remaining contestants ?? Levon Aronian of Armenia, Ivan Sokolov and Sergei Tiviakov of Holland and Kamsky ?? share the last spot jointly with one point each. 

While Anand won a nice game, Grandmaster Koneru Humpy was on the receiving end against Dortmund winner Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany in the B group being held simultaneously. 

After beating Topalovs second Ivan Cheparinov of Bulgaria in the second round, this was a blow to Humpys hopes as she went down from a seemingly innocuous position. 

Naiditsch now leads this section with a score of 3 points from as many games. 

For the second time in three days, Anand was brilliance personified in tackling his opponent despite having the slightly unfavourable colour in the game. 

Playing the black side of an English symmetrical, Anand had little to worry about in the opening phase as Ivanchuk allowed him to attain easy equality right when the middle game surfaced. 

The complications started on the 15th move when Ivanchuk opted to grab a queen side pawn at the cost of his bishop getting shunted. Anand soon got his counter-play rolling through tactical means and found a big hole in Ivanchuks calculation to win a rook for bishop on the 24th move. 

It took just four moves for the Indian stalwart thereafter to notch the full point. 

Topalov was a bit lucky when Bacrot misjudged the final landing after getting an equal position in the middle game arising out of a Petroff defence. (PTI)

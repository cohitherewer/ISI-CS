The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Finally, a home title for Federer

Basel: Roger Federer finally celebrated his first hometown title on Sunday after a 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 win over Fernando Gonzalez in the final of the Swiss Indoor tournament. 

Federer took control of the first set when he broke Gonzalez with a backhand down-the-line winner in game six and then tore through the second set after taking the first four games. 

Having collapsing dramatically against Federer in last weeks Madrid Masters Series final, the world No. 7 managed to put up a fight in the third set and earned two break-points. 

Federer defended both but was unable to kill the match off after failing to convert six break chances of his own. 

He made up for that in the subsequent tie-break, however, earning a mini-break with a fierce return on the opening point before going on to win 7-3. 

The victory earned Federer his fourth successive title, his 11th of the year and more emotionally meant he completed an unlikely journey from Basel ball boy to tournament champion. 

Its one of the most beautiful moments of my career, Federer told the crowd. 

Although I always wanted to be a professional tennis player, I never dreamed as a ball boy that I would one day be the champion here. Its unbelievable.

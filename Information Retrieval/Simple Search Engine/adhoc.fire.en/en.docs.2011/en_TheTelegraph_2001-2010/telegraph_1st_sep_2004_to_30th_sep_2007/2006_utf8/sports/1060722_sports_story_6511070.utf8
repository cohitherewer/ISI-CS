 Canada not to host ODI series

New Delhi: The proposed ODI series between India and the West Indies in Canada will not be held as the hosts are not prepared to stage the matches this year. 

[That the Canadians had been set a July 20 deadline was reported in these columns on July 10.] 

BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the Canada Cricket Association had conveyed its inability to host the ODI series in September this year, so the board was contemplating shifting the matches to another venue. 

They have said they cant provide all facilities and make necessary arrangements for the teams by September, said Shah. The series can he held at other places, maybe in Holland, Singapore or Malaysia, or anywhere else. 

We have received a number of proposals and are trying to see what can be worked out, Shah said, adding that the West Indies Cricket Board has been informed about Canadas inability. (PTI)

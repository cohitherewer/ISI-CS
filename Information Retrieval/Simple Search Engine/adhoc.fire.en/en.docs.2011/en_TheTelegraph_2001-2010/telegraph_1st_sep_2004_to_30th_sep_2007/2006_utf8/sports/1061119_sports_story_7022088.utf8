 Win for United, Arsenal held

London: Wayne Rooney scored twice as Manchester United came from behind to beat Sheffield United 2-1 and stay three points clear of champions Chelsea at the top of the Premier League in Saturday. 

Chelsea beat West Ham United 1-0 at Stamford Bridge where Geremi scored the only goal with a 22nd-minute free kick to stretch Chelseas unbeaten home league run to 51 matches. 

Arsenal, though, who moved into third place last week, lost ground after being held to a 1-1 draw at home by Newcastle United. They dropped back to fourth after Portsmouth beat Watford 2-1 to move above them. 

Kieron Dyer scored for Newcastle after 30 minutes, with Thierry Henry, who came on as a second half substitute, equalising for Arsenal with a 70th-minute free kick. 

United top the table with 34 points from 13 matches, Chelsea have 31 from 13, Portsmouth 23 from 13 and Arsenal 22 from 12. (Reuters)

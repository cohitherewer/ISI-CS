 SA threaten to boycott future tours

Durban: South Africa would consider boycotting tours of Australia if their players continue to suffer racial abuse on the current tour, a local newspaper reported on Monday. 

A Durban daily quoted Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola as saying: It is very serious and if it continues, yes, we would look very seriously about whether we return here for another series. 

Makhaya Ntini, Garnett Kruger, Herschelle Gibbs and Ashwell Prince, who are black, were targets of racial abuse by a section of the crowd during the first Test in Perth in December. 

It is not right when a country has a history like ours, the paper quoted Majola as saying in Perth. It is something we never thought we would hear about. 

The sad thing is that it has continued around Australia. It hasnt just been limited to one state or one city. 

South Africa play Sri Lanka in a one-day International in Perth on Tuesday. 

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said a crackdown on racist fans was planned. 

Look at the way they address the issue of hooliganism in England, he said. 

They make attempts to identify serial offenders and keep them out. That certainly is an option, and something we want to understand better before we go forward. These types of people are not wanted at cricket matches. 

If there is a cost-effective method of keeping them out, we will certainly look into it. 

Australia are scheduled to play in South Africa for a Test and one-day series beginning on February 20.

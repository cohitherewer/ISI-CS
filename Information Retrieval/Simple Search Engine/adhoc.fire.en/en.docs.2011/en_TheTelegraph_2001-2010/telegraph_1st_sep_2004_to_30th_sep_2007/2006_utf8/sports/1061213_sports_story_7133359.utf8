 Martyn may miss golden handshake

Melbourne: Damien Martyn is likely to lose a $280,000 golden handshake from Cricket Australia (CA) as he surprisingly retired from all cricket midway through the Ashes Test series. 

CA may refuse to pay out the 35-year-old batsman his full retainer, considering his shock retirement even from the state-level cricket last Friday, which has ended its contractual obligations to him. 

Although Cricket Australia has not negotiated a settlement with Martyn, who left for a two-week overseas holiday immediately after quitting, it considers his retirement to have ended its contractual obligations to him, an Australian newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

Martyn, who got a retainer (understood to be) worth about $460,000 a year, will lose about 60 per cent of it by retiring early. 

He has also turned his back on a potential $300,000 in match payments, including about $200,000 forecast for next years World Cup, as well as an estimated $120,000 from his bat contract. 

The residue of Martyns contract will go back into the player pool and could be distributed to Australias other contracted players, the paper said. 

But CAs expected refusal to pay Martyn could lead to a dispute with the players union, the Australian Cricketers Association, which is pushing for the batsmans cause. 

Meanwhile, Australian batsman Justin Langer has said Martyns sudden exit may cause other senior players to put their retirement plans on hold to avoid the repetition of 1980s joint exodus which had hit the team hard.

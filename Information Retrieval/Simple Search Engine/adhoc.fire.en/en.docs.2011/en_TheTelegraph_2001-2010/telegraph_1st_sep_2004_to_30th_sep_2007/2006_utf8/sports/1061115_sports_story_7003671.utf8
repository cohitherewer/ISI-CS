 Flintoff better than Botham: Sobers 

London: Sir Garfield Sobers has rated Andrew Flintoff as a better allrounder than Ian Botham, saying the current England skippers ability to make things happen on the field weighed the scale in his favour. 

The way Flintoff plays inspires belief in the rest of his team, and he drags them with him. He can now go out and run it around, play himself in, and then attack, he said. 

Ian didnt make things happen, hed go out and smack it about, and if it didnt come off, that was just the way he played, he was quoted as saying in a website. (PTI)

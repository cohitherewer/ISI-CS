The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Intikhab game for return 

 - Im not considering any offer from the PCB 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Intikhab Alam 

 Calcutta: Former Pakistan 

 captain and World Cup-winning coach Intikhab Alam is game 

 for yet another season with the Punjab Cricket Association 

 (PCA). Im waiting to hear 

 from them? The work I started in 2004-05 isnt, to 

 my mind, complete and Ill be happy to return, 

 Intikhab told The Telegraph, when contacted in Lahore 

 on Wednesday evening. 

The 64-year-old rubbished talk in some quarters that hed been considering an offer from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). 

I was approached to take up the directorship of the PCB Academy, but declined? In any case, that offer was made some time ago, not since the last season ended (in India), Intikhab said. 

That should please PCA president Inderjit Singh Bindra, who wasnt absolutely sure about his availability when one got in touch with him earlier in the day. 

For his part, Bindra intends recommending to his working committee that Intikhab be taken on board for another season. 

That committee meets on August 5. 

When we renewed Intikhabs contract last season, the terms were finalised for two years. The contract, though, has to be signed afresh before each season, Bindra pointed out. 

Punjab made the Ranji final (losing to Railways) in Intikhabs first season, but didnt do well in 2005-06. 

In the shorter version, Punjab emerged zonal toppers both times, but didnt go beyond the quarters in the national competition. 

Under Intikhabs guidance, however, captain Dinesh Mongia has grown as a batsman and become a pretty reliable left-arm spinner, too. 

Sir has helped me become a better professional? Made me more hungry for big scores? He has changed my mind-set, is how Mongia put it, speaking exclusively, after being recalled to Team India last week. 

Intikhab, incidentally, became a tad emotional when Mongias comments were conveyed to him. 

Im thankful he has remembered me in that manner? I have plenty of time for somebody like Dinesh? Hes disciplined and very focused? I hope he makes the most of the opportunities in Sri Lanka (next month), he remarked. 

Intikhab added: Im going to follow Dineshs comeback with much interest? 

 Even if he didnt say so, one is confident he 

 would be doing just that.

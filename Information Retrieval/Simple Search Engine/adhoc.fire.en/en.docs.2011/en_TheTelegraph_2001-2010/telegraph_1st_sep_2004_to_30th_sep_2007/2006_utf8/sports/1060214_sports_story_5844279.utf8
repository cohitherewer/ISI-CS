 Bhutia to lead 

New Delhi: Ace striker Bhaichung Bhutia would lead an injury-hit Indian squad for the first qualifying match of the AFC Asian Cup against defending champions Japan in Yokohoma on February 22. 

The East Bengal striker would captain the 20-member squad in the campaign which has continental powerhouses Saudi Arabia and Yemen as the other two nations in the group. Only the top two sides will qualify for the Asian Cup to be staged next year in Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia. 

Chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin has had to cope with injuries to several key players like defender Sameer Naik and midfielders Shanmugam Venkatesh and Climax Lawrence. 

Nayeemuddin had called defenders Deepak Mondal and N. P. Pradeep and striker Sampath Kumar Kuttimani to the preparatory camp as replacements. However, Mondal failed to make it to the final list. 

Bhutia himself is coming back from an injury, but a top official of the All India Football Federation said the talismanic player was now fit. Four additional players were nominated as stand byes to meet any last minute requirement. 

The team would stop over in Hong Kong on its way to Japan to play a friendly match as part of its preparation. 

It would be accompanied by coach Gabriel Joseph, manager P. K. Banerjee and goalkeeping coach Atanu Bhattacharya.

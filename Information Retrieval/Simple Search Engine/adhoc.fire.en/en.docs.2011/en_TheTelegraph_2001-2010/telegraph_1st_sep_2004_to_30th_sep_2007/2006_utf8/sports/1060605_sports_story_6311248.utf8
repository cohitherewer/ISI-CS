The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 1970s: Era of total football

 Mexico 1970

 The ninth World Cup also became 

 a major TV spectacle and to fit in with television company 

 requests, some matches kicked off at 12 noon. This was an 

 unpopular decision with many players and managers because 

 of the intense heat in Mexico at that time of day. There 

 was none of the violence throughout the tournament that 

 had plagued the two previous competitions. The 1970 World 

 Cup passed without a single player being sent off, equalling 

 the 1950 World Cup record. For the first time substitutes 

 were allowed, as well as yellow and red cards being introduced.

Pel? returned after vowing never 

 to play in another World Cup and Brazil won the Jules Rimet 

 trophy outright with a near-perfect team including Clodoaldo, 

 Gerson, Rivelino, Tostao, Jairzinho, Pel? and Carlos Alberto. 

 In the final at Mexico Citys 

 Aztec Stadium, Brazil dazzled and danced to a memorable 

 4-1 win over Italy with Jairzinho becoming the only player 

 to have scored in every match. Italy had beaten West Germany 

 4-3 in an astonishing semi-final, the only match in World 

 Cup history to have produced five goals in extra time.

 There were three big winners in 

 the 1970 World Cup: The Brazilians naturally, and their 

 king, Pel?, victors for the third time after 1958 and 1962 

 but also football itself, with many games and individual 

 feats entering football legend. 

 Those who had been dissatisfied 

 with the standard of play during the 1966 World Cup had 

 nothing to complain about four years later in Mexico, where 

 the beautiful game was really seen in all its 

 glory. Three of the games all-time greatest matches 

 were played to huge and rapturous crowds: England vs Brazil, 

 England vs West Germany and a simply sensational semi-final 

 between Italy and West Germany. And nobody will ever forget 

 Pel? and his glorious attempt to lob the Czech goalkeeper 

 Viktor from 50 metres out! 

 Did You Know?

 The Moroccans, who became the 

 first African Confederation representative (CAF founded 

 1957) to qualify for the finals (the first African finalist, 

 Egypt in 1934, had qualified without playing a single match), 

 were one of the star attractions of the first round along 

 with Peru. The Peruvians, in fact, reached the quarter finals 

 where they held their own gamely against Brazil before finally 

 going down 4-2. But the match of the quarter finals 

 pitted the two 1966 finalists England and West Germany. 

 Two-nil down with 20 minutes to go, the Germans miraculously 

 fought back to win 3-2 in extra-time. But a fiercer and 

 even more nerve-racking struggle awaited the Germans in 

 the semi-final against Italy in the brand new Aztec stadium, 

 built especially for the World Cup. 

 After 90 minutes the two teams 

 were locked at 1-1. What followed in extra-time has entered 

 football folklore, with both teams leading at different 

 times in a heart-stopping battle. Franz Beckenbauer remained 

 on the field even with a dislocated shoulder, his arm in 

 a sling strapped to his body. His courage, however, was 

 not to be rewarded, as it was finally the Italians who had 

 their way (4-3), and reached the final. There, a tired Squadra 

 Azzurra could do nothing to stop the rampant Brazilians, 

 who coasted to a 4-1 win. Carlos Alberto, the Carioca 

 captain, stepped up to receive the Jules Rimet trophy, which 

 would remain forever in Brazilian hands. Pel?, in tears, 

 was carried triumphantly on his teammates shoulders. 

 He had not only won his third World Cup winners medal, 

 but also played his last match in a World Cup. 

 Off-side

 The Jules Rimet Cup became Brazilian property outright 

 with the teams victory in Mexico. That, however, 

 was not the end of the saga of the Golden Goddess. 

 The trophy was stolen in Brazil and, unlike in England 

 in 1966, was never seen again. The CBF was given a replica 

 for their trophy cabinet. 

 1970 was the first year to see the use of yellow and 

 red cards. The first player to be sent off with a red 

 card was Carlos Caszely of Chile, who had this dubious 

 honour in 1974. This was 34 years after the first expulsion 

 of all ? that distinction goes to Galindo 

 of Peru. There are a more than half a dozen players who 

 have seen yellow in the first five minutes of a match. 

 A unique record is held by Jos? Batista of Uruguay who 

 was sent off within the first minute on 13 June 1986. 

 Mario Zagallo became the only one to lift the trophy 

 both as a player (1958-1962) and coach (1970) till Germanys 

 Beckenbauer matched his feat ? in 1974 as a player and 

 in 1990 as a coach.

 Germany 1974

 Pele had retired, aged only 31, 

 and Brazils great team had broken up by the time West 

 Germany hosted the 10th World Cup. Unlike the heat of Mexico, 

 most of the matches were played in cold, wet conditions, 

 even though the organisers had used a computer to forecast 

 the period for the best weather. But more than the weather 

 had changed since Mexico. FIFA had a new president, Brazilian 

 Joao Havelange, who was to oversee massive changes in the 

 game during his 28-year tenure.

 The Netherlands, having shaken 

 off their amateur game in the early 1960s, were back for 

 the first time since 1938 and had developed a new pattern 

 of tactical play under coach Rinus Michels dubbed Total 

 Football. It was a system that demanded every player, 

 bar the goalkeeper, have the ability to play in any position 

 at any time. Johan Cruyff was the focal point of the team, 

 one of the greatest players in history, and he led the Dutch 

 all the way to the final.

 Did You Know?

 Like its predecessor, the new 

 trophy, sculpted by Silvio Gazzaniga, was coveted by many, 

 and 98 nations took part in the qualifiers. Notable first-time 

 qualifiers for the finals were East Germany, Haiti, Australia 

 and Zaire, the first sub-Saharan African nation to reach 

 the World Cup proper. But Hungary, Spain, France and most 

 surprisingly England all failed to make it through. As a 

 prologue to its vanguard tournament, Fifa appointed itself 

 a new President, the first non-European, when the Brazilian 

 Havelange replaced Englishman Sir Stanley Rous, who had 

 held the post since 1961.

 The final began dramatically 

 as Cruyff was brought down in the German penalty area following 

 a solo run. The Dutch took the lead from the ensuing Neeskens 

 penalty before the Germans had even touched the ball and 

 with just a minute gone on the clock. German pride was stung. 

 Maier, Beckenbauer, Vogts ? who thereafter stifled Cruyffs 

 influence ? Hoeness and Overath soon fought their way back 

 into the game and finally triumphed 2-1 with goals from 

 Breitner (penalty) and M?ller. This was the Germans 

 second world title, twenty years after their first victory 

 in Switzerland in 1954. 

 Off-side

 East Germanys 1-0 win over their political enemies 

 from the west, on opposition territory too, may not have 

 had much meaning in the sporting sense since both teams 

 had already qualified for the next round. It certainly 

 had an emotional effect, however: the West Germans were 

 shaken and Beckenbauer reacted in a manner unusual for 

 this part of the world ? he held a crisis meeting with 

 the team and later appeared on television to explain the 

 situation to an unsettled public. Beckenbauer was also 

 begged by his teammates to urge coach Helmut Sch?to make 

 changes in the teams line-up and tactics.

 Scotland, as has since become their wont, failed to 

 qualify for the second round of the World Cup finals, 

 but they came very close. One win and two draws in their 

 group matches were still not enough and they were eliminated 

 early. To add to their disappointment, they finally proved 

 to be the only undefeated team of the competition. 

 The 10th World Cup tournament was marked by the arrival 

 of colour television! 

 And as if to highlight this cultural revolution even 

 more, the Weltmeisterschaft 74 featured a major change 

 in tournament rules. The first round group system followed 

 by knock-out in the second round was replaced by a group 

 system in both rounds.

 Argentina 1978

 Having reached the final in 1930, 

 Argentina had to wait a while before winning the World Cup, 

 which they eventually did on own soil in 1978. The great 

 support for the home team helped carry them to victory over 

 The Netherlands in the final, Cruyff having turned his back 

 as he refused to travel to Argentina because of the political 

 situation.

 Argentina were outplayed by Italy 

 in the opening round group games, but charged back to reach 

 the final with a 6-0 win over Peru. 

 In Daniel Passarella, Osvaldo 

 Ardiles and Mario Kempes, top scorer with six goals, they 

 had outstanding players. They beat the Dutch 3-1 after extra 

 time in the final. 

 Did You Know?

 Rarely has the run-up to a World 

 Cup been so filled with controversy as the 11th tournament. 

 Football, in fact, took a back seat as the powers that be 

 debated whether or not to boycott the tournament in protest 

 against General Videlas totalitarian regime and its 

 violation of human rights. Finally, however, despite a widespread 

 call to stay away, the worlds footballing nations 

 all made the trip to Argentina. All, that is, except those 

 that had failed to qualify, such as England (for the second 

 time running), Yugoslavia and the USSR. 

 All the tournament favourites 

 made short work of their first round opponents except the 

 Netherlands, finalists in Germany four years before but 

 now without Cruyff, who had bowed out of the competition. 

 But the Dutch managed to survive and in the second round, 

 led by a rejuvenated Robbie Rensenbrink, they began to show 

 what they were capable of and reached the final by trouncing 

 Austria 5-1, defeating Italy 2-1 and then drawing with the 

 title-holders from West Germany (2-2), who never really 

 got into their stride.

 In the other second round group, 

 meanwhile, there was a much tougher struggle between Argentina 

 and Brazil. With the host nation needing to beat Peru in 

 their last game by at least four clear goals, the Brazilians, 

 for a time at least, seemed to have booked their berth in 

 the final. But contrary to all expectations, Passarella 

 and his teammates put no less than six goals past the Peruvians, 

 including two by Mario Kempes. 

 This goal avalanche raised eyebrows 

 among even the most casual of observers. In the final, however, 

 Cesar Luis Menottis men were worthy winners (3-1 after 

 extra-time) over a Dutch side out of sorts again at the 

 final hurdle. 

 Off-side

 The French team was coached by Michel Hidalgo. Interestingly 

 just a few days ago, he was on the All India Football 

 Federations shortlist as one of the potentials candidates 

 for the national coachs post. The post eventually 

 has gone in favour of Englands Bob Houghton. 

 Iran and Tunisia made their debut in the World Cup finals.

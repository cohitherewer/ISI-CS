 Zaheer wrecks Derbyshire 

London: Speedster Zaheer Khan produced a lethal spell to claim six wickets and helped Worcestershire restrict Derbyshire to 338 in the Division II County match. 

Zaheer returned with figures of six for 60 and left Derbyshire reeling at 138 for six in 40 overs at one stage after accounting for three crucial blows at the top of order. 

Worcestershire were two for no loss at close on Day I at New Road on Wednesday. 

Wicketkeeper Graeme Welch put Derbyshires innings back on track by scoring 94 runs. He got an able support from captain James Pipe, who scored 57 runs. 

The Baroda paceman came back to halt their partnership as he claimed both the wickets. 

 Read disciplined 

Meanwhile, former England wicketkeeper Chris Read has been disciplined by English cricket chiefs after an extraordinary pitch-side bust-up with Pakistani leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed. 

Read was given three penalty points under the England and Wales Cricket Boards disciplinary code for breaching provisions relating to the use of obscene or insulting language towards another player. 

After Sussex spinner Mushtaq trapped Read leg before fifth ball for a duck, he briefly returned to the pavilion before coming out to confront the bowler on the third-man boundary. They also exchanged heated arguments. (PTI)

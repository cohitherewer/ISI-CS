Las Vegas: James Blake recorded a shock 7-5, 2-6, 6-3 win over top seed Lleyton Hewitt in the final of the Las Vegas International Tennis Channel Open on Sunday. 

American Blake relied on big forehands, pinpoint service returns and solid net play to defeat the Australian for the first time in seven attempts. 

Im happy to finally get a win against one of the best players of all time, the fifth seed said after scooping his fifth career title. 

It was big hurdle. We had played a lot of matches that went back and forth where he came out on top every time. 

To get a win in the final, were the top players are usually playing their best, its a pretty good feeling. 

Two of the fastest players in the game, Blake and Hewitt stood toe-to-toe trading groundstrokes from inside the baseline during the first set. 

Hewitt, who hasnt won a title in 14 months, said he was unlucky in the third set, when Blake got a couple of favourable net cords. 

Then he hit some cold winners and flattened some out, Hewitt said.He just goes for it and stepped it up when he had to. 

Blake said he feels he is hitting his stride.

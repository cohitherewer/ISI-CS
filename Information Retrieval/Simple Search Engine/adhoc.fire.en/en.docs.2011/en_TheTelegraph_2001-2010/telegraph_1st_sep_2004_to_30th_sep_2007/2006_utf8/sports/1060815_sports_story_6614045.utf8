 Captaincy no big deal: Mahela

Colombo: Sri Lankas record-breaking batsman Mahela Jayawardene says he does not deserve the accolades being showered on him for leading the side in the absence of Maravan Atapattu. 

Jayawardene, who came close to breaching Brian Laras world record 400 not out when he made 374 in the first Test against South Africa recently, said his team had such abundant talent that anyone could lead it with aplomb. 

When a team does well, the captain gets praised. I have done nothing special to deserve all the accolades, the 29-year-old player said. 

The players know their roles. It is well defined. For me captaincy is no big deal. I have no theories, I just go by my instincts. It depends on the conditions, the situation of the match and what mood the bowler or the batsman is in. 

And I have a few seniors around me who are ready to give their ideas. I dont think anyone will find leading this side difficult at all. 

Jayawardene said it did not bother him that he was captaining a side that has two captains and he was aware that he has to relinquish the crown once Atapattu, recovering from a lower-back injury and included in the squad for the Unitech Cup tri-series, was ready to take over. 

No issues at all. In fact, there are other seniors as well and I enjoy playing with them, he said. 

When we toured India, there was a lot of youngsters in the team. They were still getting used to power play and things like that, he said. 

It is not an excuse but it takes time to adjust. We always wanted to bring in youngsters because when injury happens to a key player, then the guy who comes in takes time to adjust to international cricket. (PTI)

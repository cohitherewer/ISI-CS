 Footballer shot dead

Bogota: Elson Becerra, Colombias national soccer teams forward, was shot and killed along with a friend in a Cartagena discotheque, police said on Monday. 

The 27-year-old Becerra was dancing in a nightclub on Sunday when attackers shot him four times, said Col. Mauricio Agudelo, police chief of Bolivar state. 

Becerra and his friend Alexander Rios apparently had an argument some days earlier with the unknown assailants, who then came to the bar looking for them, the police chief said. 

The attackers were looking for a chance in the discotheque, and in the middle of the music they shot them, Agudelo said. (AP)

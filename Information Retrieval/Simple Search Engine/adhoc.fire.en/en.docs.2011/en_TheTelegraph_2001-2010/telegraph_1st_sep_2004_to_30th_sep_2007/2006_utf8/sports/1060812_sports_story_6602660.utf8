 Srinath: Sourav deserved to be among 

 30

 Champions Trophy

 Mumbai: Jawagal Srinath 

 said on Friday that Sourav Ganguly deserved to be among 

 the Champions Trophy probables.

 He definitely deserved to 

 be among the top 30 players, the former India pacer, 

 now an ICC Match Referee, said at a function here on Friday.

 As captain he had his way 

 with the board (selectors) in getting the team he wanted. 

 Now, its mere speculation that he has worked his way 

 into the probables list through the board. We have 

 to stop this cat-and-mouse game and see whether Ganguly 

 has it in him to stage a comeback (into the main squad), 

 Srinath said.

 According to Srinath, the former 

 India captains hopes of making the Champions Trophy 

 squad depends on Dinesh Mongia and Suresh Raina. They 

 (Mongia and Raina) are the two left-handers in the squad 

 for the Sri Lanka tri-series. His (Souravs) chances 

 of making the (Champions Trophy) squad depends on Mongia, 

 Rainas performances.

 Srinath also urged the Team India 

 management to stop tinkering with the batting order and 

 composition, and start winning. Its time India 

 stopped experimentations and start winning. We have not 

 done well in Sri Lanka since 1995, its a difficult 

 place to play because of the sapping conditions and slow 

 wickets, Srinath said.

 Srinath cautioned Mahendra Singh 

 Dhoni to refrain from trying out too many shots against 

 Muttiah Muralidharan. (PTI)

 Irfan is looking to improve: Dravid

 - Sreesanth has taken his exclusion from Champions Trophy well 

 Dravid 

On Wednesday, Team India captain Rahul Dravid had some things to say about Irfan Pathan (who didnt make the XI in all four Tests in the West Indies) and Sreesanth (who has been omitted from the Champions Trophy squad). Here goes: 

ON PATHAN: Weve worked with him in different areas... There has never been a doubt about his one-day capabilities, that hasnt been an issue... He has had a blip in Tests, but people shouldnt forget hes young (21) and is still learning about his trade and craft... Players have ups and downs, but what matters is how they respond... How they bounce back... Irfan is looking to improve and thats good... 

ON SREESANTH: He has taken it (Champions Trophy exclusion) well... Whats important is how you face up (to the downs)... I keep telling youngsters theyve got to establish themselves so that their selection is never in doubt... Many can offer sympathy and blame certain people when one gets dropped, but the player has to make his own realistic assessment as to where he stands... He has to be honest...

 Bajwa quits as Pak hockey coach

 - Decision a fallout of teams humiliating 2-9 loss to The Netherlands 

Karachi: Pakistan hockey plunged into deeper crisis when chief coach Asif Bajwa resigned following his teams humiliating 2-9 defeat against The Netherlands in the Champions Trophy. 

Bajwa, who was promoted as chief coach before the Azlan Shah Hockey tournament, sent his resignation to Pakistan Hockey Ferderation (PHF) president Tariq Kirmani. 

PHF president has accepted Asif Bajwas resignation but has asked him to complete his Spanish assignment and try to help Pakistan retain its place in next years tournament, PHF insiders said. 

Two weeks ago, Kirmani had revealed that PHF secretary Musarratullah Khan had submitted his resignation which he had accepted. 

However, Khan has been asked to continue till a new secretary is appointed in September. 

Khan is accused of human trafficking on European tours besides manipulating hockey affairs to protect his position in the federation as well as in international hockey federation (FIH). 

Insiders say senior players Sohail Abbas and Waseem Ahmed had fallen out with Khan in 2004 which eventually forced them to hang their boots only to wear them again earlier this year. 

Pakistans embarrassing defeat had evoked scathing criticism in the media with one paper linking the thrashing to a wild beach party enjoyed by the indisciplined players on the eve of the match. 

Instead of resting in their team hotel and preparing for the match by focusing on the Dutch, senior Pakistan players spent the day swimming and enjoying on a Barcelona beach, a report said, adding, as a result, the players were drained, tired and focusless. 

Three-time Champions Trophy winners Pakistan conceded the first of the nine goals in the 38th second before suffering their worst defeat in the tournaments history on Tuesday. 

The drubbing ended Pakistans hopes of reaching the final of the tournament, being staged at Terrassa, and left them struggling to avoid relegation. 

The attitude of (goalkpeeper) Salman Akbar was embarrassing and unsporting when he threw his gloves in the wash basin and then kicked the door of the locker room after he was replaced after the first half (in which he conceded four goals), the newspaper commented. 

 The (senior) players are 

 a bunch of indisciplined characters who are totally out 

 of chief coach Asif Bajwas control, it added.

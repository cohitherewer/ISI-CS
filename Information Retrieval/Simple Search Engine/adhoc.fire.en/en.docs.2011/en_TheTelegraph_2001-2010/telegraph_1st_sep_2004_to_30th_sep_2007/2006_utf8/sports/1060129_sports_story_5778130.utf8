The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzy to play only if absolutely fit

 - Itna treatment chal raha hai, main kya kahun... Im getting confused 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: The Pakistan captain, Inzamam-ul Haq, is more than keen to play the third and final Test. However, the decision has been put on hold till Sunday morning. 

Itna treatment chal raha hai, main kya kahun... Im getting confused, Inzamam told The Telegraph on Saturday afternoon. He added: The back is much better, but its a five-day match and I have to be absolutely fit... 

Earlier, interacting with the Media, Inzamam disagreed that all the pressure was on his team. He said: The pressure is also on India... We wont be focusing on one player and realise that wickets will come only with mehnat... 

With Shoaib Malik not around, one change has to be made. Its not clear whether Imran Farhat is going to open with Salman Butt. Also, what isnt clear is whether allrounder Abdul Razzaq will be retained ? it seems he wont if Inzamam plays. In that scenario, his place may go to a specialist new ball bowler, possibly Umar Gul. 

A (specialist) 3-1 attack wont surprise. 

Asked whether the Board should look at importing a (chief) curator, Inzamam replied: Yes... If the existing people cant prepare good wickets, then why not? Agha Zahid isnt going to be too amused though. 

Meanwhile, with there being no risk of an early sunset here, the Test will begin 15 minutes later ? at 10.30 am (IST).

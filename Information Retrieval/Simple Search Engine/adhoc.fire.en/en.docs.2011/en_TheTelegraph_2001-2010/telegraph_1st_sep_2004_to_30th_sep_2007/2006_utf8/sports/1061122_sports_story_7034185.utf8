Multan: Master left-handed batsman Brian Lara rewrote record books Tuesday and smashed a century before lunch as the West Indies built a strong lead against Pakistan in the second Test. 

Laras unbeaten 196 off 230 balls led the West Indies to a commanding 509 for 5 at stumps on the third day and overshadowed his teammate Dwayne Bravos brilliant 89. 

The West Indies now lead by 152 runs after fast bowler Jerome Taylors five-wicket haul had restricted Pakistan to 357. 

Lara hammered 21 boundaries and seven big sixes in his superb strokeplay of six hours unbeaten knock. 

Lara joined three Australians V.T. Trumper (1902), C.G. McCartney (1926) and Sir Don Bradman (1930) along with Pakistans Majid Khan (1976) as the only other batsmen who scored centuries before lunch in Test history. 

The pair of Lara and Bravo put on invaluable 200 runs which bettered the West Indies previous best fifth wicket stand of 185 runs against Pakistan between Collie Smith and Everton Weekes at Bridgetown in 1957-58. 

Pakistan had their share of chances in an otherwise frustrating day in the field. Imran Farhat dropped Lara on 131 before wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal missed a legside catch when the West Indies captain was on 181. In the same over of leg-spinner Danish Kaneria (3-159), Akmal also let off a leg-side stumping chance that could have terminated Bravos innings on 79. 

Kaneria finally broke the threatening stand late in the day when Bravo edged a low catch to Younis Khan after hitting 12 boundaries in his 177-ball knock. 

Earlier in a boundary-filled first session, Lara raised his 34th Test century off 77 balls before lunch with a dozen delightful fours and five huge sixes when he pulled Shahid Nazir for two runs in the penultimate over before the break. 

Opening batsmen Chris Gayle (93) and Daren Ganga (82) both missed their hundreds and were trapped leg before by Kaneria after the West Indies resumed at the overnight 151 without loss.

 ICC shouldnt have a problem: Ashraf 

 Inzamam-ul Haq 

Rawalpindi: While Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Tuesday welcomed the decision of lifting the ban on pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, some have wondered how Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is going to contend with the ICC and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) about the latest decision. 

The following are reactions from players and officials (alphabetically) on the PCB-appointed appeals commissions decision: 

Dr. Nasim Ashraf (PCB chairman): We carried out our own anti-doping process starting from the tests before the Champions Trophy because we firmly believe in a zero tolerance policy towards drugs in sports. So I dont think the ICC should have any problems with this verdict and the chapter is closed I am pleased with the decision because it will strengthen our team for the World Cup... (But) We feel they should first be allowed to play couple of domestic games to ascertain their form and match fitness before recalling them 

Inzamam-ul Haq: We missed them in the Tests against the West Indies, although the other bowlers bowled very well. Thei return will only add firepower to our bowling attack for coming matches. 

Moin Khan: It is good news for Pakistan cricket that they are available for selection now. It will strengthen our bowling a great deal on the South Africa tour and in the World Cup. 

Sarfraz Nawaz: Now I think officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board should apologise to the whole nation for mishandling the case 

Dick Pound (WADA chief): Its quite clear that if you are an international athlete, youve got to be aware of the risks You dont get any points for saying someone forgot to warn me If there is a problem with the decision we will tell the ICC what do you intend to do? Only if the ICC neglects or refuses to act, do we then step in.

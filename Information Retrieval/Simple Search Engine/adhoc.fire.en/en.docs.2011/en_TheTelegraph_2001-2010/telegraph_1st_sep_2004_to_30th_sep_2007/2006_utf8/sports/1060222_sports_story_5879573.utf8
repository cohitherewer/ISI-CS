 Focus on Barcelona, Chelsea and a muddy Stamford pitch

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - We must not repeat last years errors: Ronaldinho

London: Controversy over the Stamford Bridge pitch and memories of last seasons momentous tussle have added an extra spark to Chelseas Champions League showdown with Barcelona on Wednesday. 

Chelseas muddy and balding pitch, described as a potato field by Jose Mourinho and criticised in the Catalan media, is unlikely to help either the Spanish or English champions in the first leg of the first knockout round tie. 

Mourinho, reacting to suggestions they had deliberately allowed the pitch to deteriorate to hamper Barcelonas passing game, said: Only stupid people can think that a team like Chelsea with the quality Chelsea have can be happy with a pitch like this. 

He added that it looked worse than it played. Sometimes you see beautiful people with no brains but you see ugly people who are intelligent scientists. Our pitch is a bit like that. 

Barcelona are still smarting from last years 2-4 defeat at Stamford Bridge (having won the first leg 2-1) and know that they can ill afford a repetition of the lapses that gifted Chelsea three goals in the first 20 minutes. 

Ive still got the images in my head of when the match finished and we were out, Brazilian Ronaldinho told newsmen. I dont want it to happen again this year. We made errors and we have to make sure we dont repeat them. 

One of the keys will be to play football the way we know how. We have got an advantage in having the second leg at the Nou Camp and we have got to make the most of that. Ronaldinho has no concerns about Chelseas pitch. We know the grass is in a bad state but it will be the same for both teams and Im not worried about it, he said. 

Mourinho will make wholesale changes from the side that defeated Colchester in the FA Cup on Sunday, with suspended captain John Terry, midfielder Frank Lampard and keeper Petr Cech returning. 

Spanish left-back Asier Del Horno will be fit after injury but there are serious doubts over French defender William Gallas (hamstring) and midfield compatriot Claude Makelele (knee). 

Ghanaian midfielder Michael Essien is suspended for both games in the tie. Uefa made their decision after watching a video of a tackle he made on Didi Hamann during a group match against Liverpool in December. 

Wednesdays first-leg matches also feature Ajax Amsterdam against Inter Milan, the only tie between teams that have met in the final ? the Amsterdam side triumphing 2-0 in Rotterdam in 1972. 

Ajax coach Danny Blind must contend without his entire first-choice midfield, as well as influential Czech defender Zdenek Grygera and will hope Inter striker Adriano does not rediscover his scoring touch. 

The Brazilian has not hit the target in his last nine games. 

Im going through a difficult period, I cant hide the fact. But Im not going to let it worry me too much either, he said. 

Werder Bremen host Serie A leaders Juventus with midfielder Johan Micoud warning his teammates they will be up against possibly the worlds best striker. 

Juventus have high class forwards, and with David Trezeguet you have in my opinion one of the best, maybe the best striker in the world, Micoud said of his fellow-Frenchman. 

Werder Bremen striker Miroslav Klose is confident of being fit to play. 

Klose, top scorer in the Bundesliga with 16 goals and a key member of Germanys World Cup squad, injured his shoulder in a domestic Cup match at the end of January. (Reuters)

Napier: Chaminda Vaas took four wickets to help Sri Lanka win by 20 runs against New Zealand and prevent a Black Caps sweep of the five-match limited-overs series here on Sunday. 

Vaas took the vital wicket of New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming for a duck in the very first over, then returned to take three wickets in his last two overs, to cut the hosts series-winning margin to 4-1. 

An innings of 112 by New Zealands new batting hope, Peter Fulton, seemed likely to give the home team a convincing win and complete a sweep of a series which was postponed after massive tsunami that struck Sri Lanka on December 26, 2004. 

The tall right-hander followed half-centuries in the second and fourth matches of the interrupted series with a century from 120 balls to cement his place in New Zealands middle order and to provide his team with a winning chance. 

He confidently guided New Zealands chase after Sri Lanka made 273 for six batting first after winning the tossand with the home team having lost Fleming and Lou Vincent inside the first two overs. 

Fulton combined in partnerships of 108 with Nathan Astle (47) and 78 with Hamish Marshall (35), coming to the wicket with New Zealand at 13 for two and leaving 180 minutes later when they were 224 for five and within 50 runs of victory.

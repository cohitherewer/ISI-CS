 Dravid: We dont live in a perfect world 

Colombo: Indian captain Rahul Dravid said on 

 Wednesday that he shared South Africas concerns over 

 the security situation in Sri Lanka and that his team decided 

 to stay back following assurances of safety given to them 

 by the Sri Lankan government. 

 The South Africans decided to 

 pull out of the Unitech Cup tri-nation series, in the wake 

 of a fatal bomb blast here on Monday, but India opted to 

 stay put to play a three-match ODI series against the hosts. 

 Dravid did not see any contradiction in India preferring 

 to stay on while the African team headed back home. 

South Africa have gone by the recommendations of their people. We have spoken to the officials in the Sri Lanka Cricket, the Sri Lankan government and the Indian High Commission, Dravid said at a media conference here. We have full confidence and faith in what they have to say and made our decision based on that. 

Asked if terrorism was a constant threat to visiting teams and would affect cricket in the subcontinent in the long run, Dravid said: I dont know. It is sad, and it is unfortunate that the (triangular) series had to be called off. We dont live in a perfect world. 

Dravid said he hoped that the new schedule of three matches between India and Sri Lanka would give the people of the island nation something to cheer about. 

We share a good relationships with Sri Lankan cricket. These are difficult times and we cannot blame anyone. We have come here to play cricket and everyone in our team is conscious of the importance that cricket enjoys in Sri Lanka as well as India. 

 Hopefully we can bring some 

 joy to the people here, and they will have something to 

 cheer about. (PTI)

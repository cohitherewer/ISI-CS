 Harbhajan made me feel confident: Cook

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Alastair Cook in action during his knock of 60 in Nagpur on Wednesday 

Nagpur: If it was Sreesanth taking his Test debut as a normal course of life, for Alastair Cook, it was a tryst with nervousness in the beginning. 

Once he overcame that stage, his negotiation with the Indian attack was indeed a pleasant surprise. 

The pitch was keeping low. So I just kept looking for the gaps and hitting through those areas. So you can see I was trying to take a few singles. But honestly speaking, I was a little bit nervous till the first drinks break. When I was in the middle, I just wanted to enjoy the experience, the Essex opener, who was called in straight from England A tour of the West Indies, said after the match on Wednesday. 

It was also a learning experience for the 21-year-old to get to the swing of things against two world-class spinners (Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble). 

Initially, I didnt know how to handle Harbhajan, but the more I saw him the more I felt comfortable and confident, he remarked. 

He also admitted that his brief stint in the Caribbean helped him come to terms with the hot and humid conditions in the subcontinent. Since I was in the West Indies, I got used to the heat. I think it was the best way ? just go straight there and play, he pointed out. 

Cook didnt want to let the situation go without mentioning former England and Essex captain Graham Goochs contribution towards his game. He was fantastic. He had the experience of over 100 Test matches and Im lucky to have him (as a mentor). If I can be half as good as him, I will be happy, he said. 

That a thinking head is lying on the youngsters shoulders became clear when he said: Its a good sign that the ball is reverse swinging. Our bowlers can also take the advantage of it, he observed.

 ICC, PCA fail to resolve issues

 Mohali: The pre-tournament row on the issue of profit-sharing between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) intensified on Friday with the games governing body asking the host venue to sort out the contentious issues through its grievance redressal mechanism. 

The PCA has not taken the ICC advice too kindly. Some issues are still pending with the ICC. They have told us to sort out those through the grievance redressal mechanism. We have told them that they can take their problems to that the forum, PCA chief I.S. Bindra told reporters here on Friday. 

The ticket revenue is 100 per cent with the PCA. To accommodate some of the ICC requirements we had to dismantle a number of corporate boxes. We want ICC to compensate for the losses which will be to the tune of Rs 90 lakh per match, Bindra said. (PTI)

 Bangla call up Baisya

Dhaka: Bangladesh have called up fast bowler Tapash Baisya as they bid for a first ever series victory in Saturdays third and final one-day International against Sri Lanka in Chittagong. 

Bangladesh levelled the three-match series 1-1 with the four-wicket victory in Bogra on Wednesday, only their 11th win in 117 ODIs. 

We have called for Tapash Baisya to strengthen the squad in the final one-dayer, Farook Ahmed, Bangladeshs chief selector, said. He will fill the gap left by allrounder Khaled Mahmud, who quit international cricket after the first match against in Bogra on Monday, Ahmed said. 

Baisya has played in 51 one-day Internationals, taking 56 wickets at an average of 39.71.

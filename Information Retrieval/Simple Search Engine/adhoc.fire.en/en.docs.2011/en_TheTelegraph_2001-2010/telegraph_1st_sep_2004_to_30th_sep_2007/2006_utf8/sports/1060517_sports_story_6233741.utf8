The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Powar as good as out of 1st ODI 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Powar has a right ankle 

ligament strain 

Montego Bay: Ramesh Powar, who hurt himself during Mondays nets outside Kingston, is as good as out of the first India versus West Indies ODI ? at Sabina Park on Thursday. 

Powar has a right ankle ligament strain. While the good thing is that theres no fracture, its unlikely that hes going to be fit for Thursday, Team India physio John Gloster told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon. 

Sreesanth, too, has a problem ? a bruised left heel. Gloster, though, is hopeful that he will be available for selection when the five-match series gets underway. 

While theres backup in the new ball department, the squad only has two specialist spinners.

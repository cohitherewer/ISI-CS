The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are transparent: Dalmiya

 - No objection to independent observers 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

Calcutta: CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Sunday said he has no objection to the appointment of independent observers for Sundays elections, even though it is against the rules of the association. 

Our lawyers were asked by the court whether we have any objections to this proposal. I called a meeting of our office-bearers on Sunday. We are ready for any number of joint observers? two, four or six. We have nothing to hide, Dalmiya said at a press conference. 

The court has sought our opinion on this issue and we welcome it. 

The opposition had moved the city civil court on July 17. The court suggested that the petitioner and the respondent propose a name each for the observers post. Dalmiya said his group has no reason to oppose the move. 

The CAB has been run in a professional manner. It is considered to be a well-administered body. If anybody has any doubts, we would be happy to clear those, the CAB president said. 

Without naming the petitioner, an Aryan club official, Dalmiya said: We hope he comes out into the open. 

Calling city police Prasun Mukherjee a perfect gentleman, Dalmiya said: I hold him in very high regard. He is a man of reason. If he asks for something or has any misgivings, I would be only too pleased to clarify those. I am just a phone call away.

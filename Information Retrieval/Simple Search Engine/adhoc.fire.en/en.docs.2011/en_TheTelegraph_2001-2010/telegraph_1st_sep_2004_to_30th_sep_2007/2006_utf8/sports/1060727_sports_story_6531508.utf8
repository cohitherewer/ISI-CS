 India colts restrict England 

London: Indian bowlers restricted England U-19 to 231 in their first innings on the opening day of their four-day match at Canterbury on Wednesday. 

V. Yo Mahesh, Sumit Sharma and Shahbaz Nadeem picked two wickets each while Ishant Sharma, Harshad Khadiwale and Karan Singh took one each to complete the rout in 88.4 overs. 

Indians appeared to be in high spirits after their 3-0 clean sweep in the one-day series. Khadiwale gave an early breakthrough to the visitors by trapping captain Varun Chopra leg before at a cheap score of 14 after he elected to bat at the St Lawrence Ground. 

Khadiwale returned with one for seven in his three overs. 

Sumit scalped two consecutive wickets in the space of 46 runs to reduce the hosts to 89 for four at one stage, but Adam Lyth came to stabilise their innings with a defiant half century.

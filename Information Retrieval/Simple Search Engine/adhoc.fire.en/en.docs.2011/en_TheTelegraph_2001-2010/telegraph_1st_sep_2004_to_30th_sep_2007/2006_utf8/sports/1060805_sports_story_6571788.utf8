Calcutta: It was a great escape for Mohun Bagan. After losing 0-1 against Port Trust, they were on the verge of dropping another couple of points against Eastern Railway at the Barasat Stadium on Friday. 

It was sheer luck that they managed to get past the Railway hurdle 2-1 via a stoppage time winner from Deepak Mondal in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match. 

The green-and-maroons drew first blood in the second minute when Mehrajuddin Wadao converted a spot-kick. Bapon Bera levelled the score with a goal in the 54th minute. 

In soggy ground conditions, it was hard to differentiate between Mohun Bagan and Eastern Railway in terms of the quality of the game. Bhaichung Bhutia had to play a lone hand due to lack of support from Ayan Chowdhury in the first half, and veteran Dipendu Biswas later in the match. 

Bhaichung showed flashes of brilliance but they were of no use as he was halted by a group of Eastern Railway defenders whenever he tried to penetrate. But it was only because of Bhaichung that Mohun Bagan got the early lead. 

A Dulal Biswas cross was just about to be headed in by Bhaichung when he was pulled down by Babun Kar inside the box and Mohun Bagan were awarded a penalty. Mehrajuddin converted with ease. 

After that, Mohun Bagan put pressure on the Eastern Railway defence. The first session ended 1-0 in favour of the green-and-maroons. 

Sensing trouble, Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya brought in Suman Dutta in the midfield in place of Chinmoy Sarkar. 

The goal their conceded was quite against the run of play. Receiving a loose ball on the right of the box, Bapon, with his neat footwork, dodged Deepak and placed the ball to the far post. The goal fetched him the Man-of-the-Match award. With the score 1-1, the pace slowed, as by that time the ground conditions had become even worse. 

Mohun Bagan got close to scoring on occasion, but the all-important goal eluded them till the 90th minute. Just when referee Biswajit Kar was about to blow the long whistle, a Dulal cross headed by Bhaichung hit the horizontal. Deepak scored from a melee off the rebound.

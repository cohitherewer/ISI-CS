The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Coach: Boys played on empty stomachs

Kuala Lumpur: The three-hour rain-induced 

 stoppage on Wednesday night during the deciding pool A match 

 in the 15th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup Eight-Nation Hockey tournament 

 here, caused more worries to the Indian team than their 

 opponents Korea as coach V. Baskaran had to contend with 

 hungry, thirsty and restless players. 

The match was halted seven minutes to half-time due to torrential downpour accompanied by thunder and lightning with India ahead 2-0. After a three-hour break, the match resumed and India went on to win 3-0 to qualify for the semi-finals. 

During the extended break, Baskaran and physio Ravi Kankamedala waded through shin-deep water in search of snacks for the players. 

The players had their lunch at 12 noon and some of them had eaten only fruits. So, with the extended stoppage, they were obviously hungry and thirsty, Baskaran said on Thursday morning. 

We had run out of drinking water as the players had consumed all the 48 half-litre bottles and also the additional supplies we had carried to the ground. We had not packed food since we had not expected such a situation, he explained. 

 They finally located a stall selling hamburgers. But 

 four of our players are pure vegetarians and so I helped 

 cut cabbage to prepare sandwiches. I knew it was not sufficient, 

 but then, at least, the players had some nourishment, 

 he said.

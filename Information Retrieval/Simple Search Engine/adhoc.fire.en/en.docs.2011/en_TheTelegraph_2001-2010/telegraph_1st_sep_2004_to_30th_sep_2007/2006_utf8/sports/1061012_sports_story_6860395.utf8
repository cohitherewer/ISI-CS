 PCB wants ICC assurance on teams safety

Karachi: The PCB has asked the ICC to ensure its teams security in India during the Champions Trophy in the wake of the threats from Shiv Sena. 

A PCB official said the matter of the constant threats issued by the nationalist party had been taken up with the ICC as the safety of the players was paramount to the board. 

We know every time our team has toured India this party has made such threats and tried to disrupt our games. But a threat is a threat and cannot be disregarded, the official said. 

He said the board was in regular touch with its team management in India, which had conveyed that the players were comfortable and in good spirits despite the threats. 

We remain confident that the home board and ICC are aware of what needs to be done to keep our players comfortable and safe. We are monitoring the situation, he said. Pakistan will only play in Mumbai a stronghold of the Sena if they qualify for the final on November 5.

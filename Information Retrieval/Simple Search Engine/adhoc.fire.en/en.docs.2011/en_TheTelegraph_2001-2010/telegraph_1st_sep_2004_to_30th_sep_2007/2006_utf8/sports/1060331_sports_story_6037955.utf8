 Comeback not easy, feels Balaji

 Balaji 

Kochi: Striving to make a comeback after injury, medium-paceer Lakshmipathy Balaji admitted on Thursday that it was tough to get back into the side. 

It is not easy to get back into the side. Performance counts, the lanky bowler said when questions on Indias new fast bowlers Munaf Patel and Sreesanth were put to him. 

Everybody likes to play for the country and perform for the country and contribute for the country. It is not the competition. It is an honour for the player to represent the country. Whoever gets the opportunity and try to make full use of it will be there, he said. 

Asked about the performance of Sreesanth and Munaf, he said: We have played together for long. They can bowl fast and get wickets. Sreesanth puts in 100 percent on the field. Balaji was here to inaugurate the ticket sales of the one-dayer between India and England to be played on April 6. 

On his own form and fitness, he said his injury was healing fast and he was ready for competitive cricket. (PTI)

Tokyo: Buoyed by a birdie on the final-hole, Jeev Milkha Singh kept himself in contention with a hard-earned two-over 72 after Day II of the UBS Japan Golf Tour Championship at the Shishido Hills Country Club outside Tokyo. 

Jeev, the current leader of the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit, aggregated 142 on Friday to be tied in 19th place. 

Amandeep Johl after the second-round 77 finished at nine-over par 149, missing the cut by three strokes. 

Toru Taniguchi, whose four-under 66 followed an equally impressive 67 on Thursday, leads at seven-under 133. Four players are tied for second four shots back at the $1.3 million tournament, including evergreen 51-year-old Tommy Nakajima. 

Jeev had a disappointing start with bogeys on second and third, but a birdie on the fifth and then another on the ninth, with a bogey in between eighth saw him turn in one-over. He had bogeys on 10th, 12th and 13th, but birdies on 11th and 18th saw him end the day at 74 and a total of two-over 142. 

That was a great finish after not starting out too good. I made a few mistakes and did not hit the ball in the fairway on a couple of occasions. It was an up and down round. These last two holes are pretty tough, so I am pretty happy with the way I finished, Jeev said. 

 About his fightback, Jeev said: You just have to keep trying. You say: Hey man, this is the last few holes. You just try to follow your normal process and game plan and see what happens. (PTI)

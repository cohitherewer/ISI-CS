 - Tie vs Saudi Arabia

Calcutta: Though eyeing the 2010 World Cup, Indias chief football coach Bob Houghton wants to take it one at a time. And if Houghton is to be believed, India would go with a positive approach when they take on Saudi Arabia, who have the experience of playing four World Cups, in the August 16 AFC Asian Cup qualifier here. Only a win will satisfy him. 

Can we win? You have chances in every game. We are preparing with a win in our mind, Houghton said, while admitting that it would be a tough ask for the hosts, knowing the fact that Saudis are placed seventh on the Asian list compared to Indias 26th. 

They will bring several players whove done duty in the recent World Cup. They have raw power. Im afraid, we will be out-physiqued, said Houghton. 

But were taking the match positively. If we play with the mindset of not wanting to concede many goals, that will be a negative approach, which I dont like. Against the Saudis, well try to push the ball quickly into the opponent half, and put pressure on them, the chief coach said. 

The coach, however, felt that Indias Asian ranking of 26 is an underachievement. We can do much better Maldives, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Jordan, Bahrain and many other countries with higher rankings than us, he stated. 

Houghton disclosed his vision 2010 on Sunday. The British coach has shortlisted three major outings for the Indians as a build-up to the 2010 World Cup. According to the seasoned campaigner, seniors will be concentrating on the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers with Saudi Arabia, Japan and Yemen. The Under-23 side will prepare for the Doha Asian Games while the under-20 boys will start thinking about Olympic qualification in 2007. 

If the programme goes right, then around this time next year we will get the nucleus of the squad for 2010, he said. 

The coach said he would get about two-and-a-half years to prepare for the mega show, as the qualifiers would be played in 2009. 

Whether it is possible for India to make it to this World Cup I dont know. But to do it, we have to take a huge leap forward. But I think, World Cup 2014 will be a more realistic target, he admitted. 

To make the Indians dream come true, Houghton is also very keen on importing players of India origin like Prince Rajcoomar, Michael Chopra and Harpal Singh. Only two or three players like them can speed up the upward mobility of the whole squad, he said. 

Apart from the technique and tactics (where the Indians need to improve), Houghton stressed on the psychological aspect. You need players who are team-oriented and individualistic. They have to be winners, who can come back harder when the chips are down. The coach, however, ruled out any need for a sports psychologist to help the national squad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 5th-best rating for Ponting

Calcutta: Australia captain Ricky Ponting now has the fifth best batting rating of all time in Tests after an outstanding innings during the first Test of the Ashes series, against England in Brisbane. 

Pontings scores of 196 and an unbeaten 60 not only helped his side to a 277-run win, but also earned him nine rating points in the LG ICC Player Rankings, according to a release. 

It has lifted him to a new mark of 940 points and only four players in the history of the game fellow countryman Donald Bradman and the England trio of Len Hutton, Jack Hobbs and Peter May have achieved a higher rating. 

Pontings outstanding form means that Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf has so far been unable to assume top spot in the ICC rankings for Test batsmen. 

The two players have been trading blows like prize-fighters in recent ties, matching each other hundred for hundred.

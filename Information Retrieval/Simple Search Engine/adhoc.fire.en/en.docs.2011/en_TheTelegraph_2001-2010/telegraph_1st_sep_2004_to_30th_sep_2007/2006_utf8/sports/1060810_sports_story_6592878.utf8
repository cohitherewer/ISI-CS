Los Angeles: Sania Mirza charged up late against Jelena Jankovic but was forced out in straight sets in the singles first round of the $600,000 J.P. Morgan Chase Open tournament in Los Angeles. 

Sania, who threw away the first set, stretched the second set into a tie-breaker, but the world No. 28 clinched the match 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) in one hour and 23 minutes on Tuesday. 

According to information received here, the 44th ranked Indian, who struggled to hold her serves in the first set, tried to make a comeback in the match by exchanging two break points in the second. 

The experienced Jankovic put paid to her plans by dragging the match into a tie-breaker, where she sealed the matter without much effort. 

Sanias challenge in the doubles has already ended. 

In other matches, Russian Nadia Petrova became the first big-name casualty, while twice champion Serena Williams won her opening match in convincing style on Tuesday. 

Second seed Petrova, who has struggled with injury since winning three consecutive titles on clay earlier this year, lost 6-3, 6-2 to Spanish doubles specialist Virginia Ruano Pascual in the second round. 

The problems are especially in my head, Petrova told reporters at the Home Depot Centre. I feel like Im not on the court, I am somewhere next to it. Its ridiculous to lose 6-3, 6-2. Im really fighting with myself with just focusing on what Im doing. 

Im trying to push myself, I try to tell myself to fight but my whole body is against it, added the Russian, who also lost her opening match at the Acura Classic in San Diego last week. The 24-year-old from Moscow won four tournaments this year before suffering a groin injury at the French Open where she lost to Japans Akiko Morigami in the first round. 

She was sidelined for two months, pulling out of Eastbourne and Wimbledon with a hip injury, before losing her first match back in straight sets in San Diego where she was the third seed. 

Williams, playing only her second tournament in seven months because of a chronic knee injury, breezed past 11th seed Maria Kirilenko of Russia 6-2, 6-1 in a first-round match. 

The seven-time Grand Slam champion dominated her opponent from inside the baseline, blasting her groundstrokes and moving quickly from side to side. 

I feel Im going in the right direction, Williams said after firing down eight aces. I dont want to peak too soon. I just want to make some improvements here and there and keep training and keep working hard. 

Williams, a winner here in 1999 and 2000, had not competed since losing to Russian Vera Zvonareva in the semi-finals of the Cincinnati Open last month, her first tournament since the Australian Open in January. 

Tuesdays performance, she felt, was a significant improvement. Its a total turnaround, said Williams, who had planned to return at last weeks Acura Classic but withdrew on the advice of her doctor. 

In first-round upsets, Japans ninth seed Ai Sugiyama lost to American Laura Granville 7-5, 6-2 and Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy, the 17th seed, was knocked out by American Meghann Shaughnessy 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 after a three-hour contest. 

Thirteenth-seeded Anabel Medina Garrigues also made an early exit, going down 6-4, 6-3 to Russian Anna Chakvetadze in their first-round encounter. However, Russian third seed Elena Dementieva moved smoothly into the third round with a 6-2, 7-5 win over German Julia Schruff.

 Atwal misses the cut

Ancaster (Canada): Arjun Atwal and Daniel Chopra missed the cut at the midway stage of the Canadian Open on the US Tour here. 

Chopra, who had a 69 in first round, added a two-over 72 and was one-over 141 for 36 holes. Atwal, 72 in first round, added an even par 70 in second but with the cut coming at even par, both were out of the weekend rounds. 

Arron Oberholser shot a 2-under 68 to share the second-round lead with Jesper Parnevik, Camilo Villegas and Jonathan Byrd. (Pti)

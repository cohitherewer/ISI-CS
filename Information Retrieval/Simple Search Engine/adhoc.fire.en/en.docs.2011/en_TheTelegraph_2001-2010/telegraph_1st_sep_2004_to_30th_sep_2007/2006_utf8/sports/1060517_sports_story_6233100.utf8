London: Gone are Argentinas 2002 losers, tainted by the debacle in Asia four years ago, and in come Jose Pekermans junior champions. 

Coach Pekerman left out former defence stalwarts Javier Zanetti ? the former captain ? and Walter Samuel when he named his World Cup squad on Monday. 

He picked a squad littered instead with players who have won the World Youth Cup or the Olympic Games gold medal, and in some cases both. This is a very strong group... theres a historic potential and thats because of the richness of Argentine football, Pekerman told a news conference in Buenos Aires when he named his squad. 

The only players in Pekermans squad who went to Asia in 2002 under his predecessor Marcelo Bielsa are Roberto Ayala, who saw no action in his second World Cup because of injury, midfielders Pablo Aimar and Juan Pablo Sorin, both key figures in Pekermans successful junior teams, and striker Hernan Crespo, a reserve in Japan. 

Pekermans new guard, looking to win the World Cup for Argentina for the third time, is captained by Sorin and inspired by the midfield genius of Juan Roman Riquelme. 

He is taking some chances on the fitness of defender Gabriel Heinze, who is coming back from a long injury layoff and in dire need of match practice. 

Pekerman, however, believes in a project he began 12 years ago in 1994 when he took charge of Argentinas junior teams and set off on a winning streak in which his country landed four World Youth Cups between 1995 and 2005. 

In San Jose, defender Roy Miller was the unlucky player as Costa Rica confirmed their final 23-man squad on Monday. 

Poland and Portugal also announced their 23-man squads on Monday (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition), with coach Pawel Janas leaving out two of the biggest stars. 

Janas shocked fans and media by dropping Liverpool keeper Jerzy Dudek and the teams top scorer in qualifying Tomasz Frankowski, opting instead for inexperienced youngsters. 

Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari left out Ricardo Quaresma from his 23-man squad. Central defender Jorge Andrade, who has been ruled out of the June 9 to July 9 finals after undergoing knee surgery, has been replaced by Ricardo Costa of Porto.

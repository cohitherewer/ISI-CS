The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Semi-final berth our target: Baskaran

 - Sandeep will be missed, but we need to move on 

 Dilip Tirkey 

Moenchengladbach: Weighed down by history and unpredictable form, India would get another chance to improve their track record in the World Cup when they launch their campaign in the premier hockey competition here on Wednesday. 

The Indians run into hosts and defending champions Germany in the opening match of the tournament, which they have won only once in the last 10 editions. 

With a refurbished team and a new coach in Vasudevan Baskaran, Dilip Tirkeys men will also have to contend with Champions Trophy winners The Netherlands, grouped along with India in pool B. 

The Indians have been through a testing period since finishing 10th at the 2002 World Cup in Kuala Lumpur, the scene of their only triumph back in 1975. The players are motivated and we hope to do well here. Realistically, our target is to qualify for the semi-finals, said Baskaran. 

 Since he took charge of the team earlier this year, India have had little international experience and this is something Baskaran is conscious of. 

A four-nation tournament here followed by the Azlan Shah Cup in Kuala Lumpur have been the only preparatory events for India, besides the three warm-up games since their arrival in Germany. 

Even before the Indians left, they suffered a huge setback when their penalty corner specialist Sandeep Singh was injured in a freak accident. 

His absence will be felt, but then, we need to look forward, said Baskaran. 

The Indians have included rookie V. Ramachandra Raghunath from Kodagu, Karnataka, as Sandeeps replacement. For this youngster, it is a huge leap from the junior ranks. He was selected from among the three probables, who were tried in the matches with Belgium and Japan. 

Indias aim in the league phase would be to drop as few points as possible, but their route to the semi-finals has two big hurdles in Germany and The Netherlands, the teams that India have never beaten in the World Cup. 

The Germans have rebuilt a strong side after winning the 2002 edition and boast of a team that has a good mix of youth and experience. They would be keen to present a farewell gift to their coach Bernhard Peters, who is to move to football at the end of this World Cup. 

But it is the Dutch that look the favourites to win their fourth World Cup, a record that would tie them with Pakistan. They have been on a roll this year, winning the Azlan Shah Cup, the Champions Trophy and the four-nation Hamburg Masters. Among other contenders, Spain and Australia are also among title-reckoning. 

 Pakistan would be spearheading the Asian challenge 

 that also includes 2002 semi-finalists Korea. But Pakistans 

 recent record has been far from impressive, especially after 

 the departure of coach Roelant Oltmans last year.

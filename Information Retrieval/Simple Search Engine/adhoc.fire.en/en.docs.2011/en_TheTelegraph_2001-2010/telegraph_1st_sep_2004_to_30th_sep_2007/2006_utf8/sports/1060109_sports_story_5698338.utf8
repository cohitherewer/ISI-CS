 2-0 victory for Dynamos 

Chandigarh: A goal in each half helped local favourities Chandigarh Dynamos beat Sher-e-Jalandhar in a Premier Hockey League Tier I match on Sunday. 

Deepak Thakur scored a field goal in the 31st minute and captain Rajpal Singh sealed Sher-e-Jalandhars fate with his strike in the 65th minute of the fast-paced match. 

This was the second consecutive defeat suffered by Sher-e-Jalandhar. 

Meanwhile, in a Tier II match, Chennai Veerans brushed aside the challenge of newcomers Orissa Steelers by a silver goal in the extra-timeon Sunday. 

Raghunath and Alfred Asir did a commendable job in the defence for the Veerans whereas forwards Raja and Adam Sinclair were starved of passes and their midfield looked disjointed as Orissa Steelers gave some anxious moments to the Veerans in the keenly-contested match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chance for us to take the lead, says Flintoff

 - We cant be complacent at this stage 

Mohali: Having surprised India by their resilience in Nagpur, England captain Andrew Flintoff sought to gain a few psychological points ahead of the second Test, saying his side was capable of taking the lead if the Mohali track offers some assistance to his pace battery. 

Should the pitch offer more bounce and more pace, we have a decent chance to take the lead, Flintoff said after the teams practice session on Tuesday. 

It rained in Mohali on Monday night and the upper hills in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh experienced snowfall. 

Conditions are likely to stay slightly overcast till Thursday, the opening day of the second Test. 

England went into the series as underdogs after captain Michael Vaughan, his deputy Marcus Trescothick and fast bowler Simon Jones were forced to fly back home before the Test series began. 

But the visitors defied the odds and displayed a gritty performance in Nagpur last week. 

Flintoff, however, said his team needed to maintain the good show they had put up so far and not allow complacency to take over. 

As long as we do things we did last week, we should be okay. We cant be complacent at this stage of the series, he said. 

On his boys, Flintoff said, It is a young side, lads have been doing great and they have taken the ownership. 

The three debutants also received some praise from Flintoff, who is captaining the side in absence of Michael Vaughan. 

The 28-year old allrounder said he wont allow captaincy to curb his natural game. 

I have been given the job for a few weeks and will behave the way I do and do things that I do, he said. 

He also said he sought his teammates opinion and if they were worthwhile, we take them on board. 

Referring to the drawn Nagpur Test, he said, we went out there with a definite plan and we stuck to that. 

Meanwhile, England suffered another blow with vice-captain Trescothick being ruled out of the remaining two Tests. He is also highly unlikely to take part in the one-day series. 

He has been ruled out for personal reasons which cannot be revealed at the moment, England media manager Andrew Walpole said on Tuesday.

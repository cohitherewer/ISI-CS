The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Another scandal at the Games 

 Melbourne: In the second 

 sex scandal to hit the Commonwealth Games, a Bangladeshi 

 shooter was arrested on charges of sexual abuse of a young 

 paid worker in the Games village here. Taufiqur M. Rahman was nabbed 

 on Saturday for making sexual advances at an Australian 

 paid workforce member in her early 20s but was released 

 later on bail after five hours in detention. 

He has been charged with indecent and unlawful assaults, the same charges that were slapped on Indian masseur Diwan Asgar Nabi, who allegedly tried to kiss, fondle and embrace a 16-year-old Australian volunteer. 

 Rahman has denied the charges. 

 According to the official, Rahman claimed he was acting 

 playfully and did not mean any harm. 

Meanwhile, the hearing on disgraced Indian wieghtlifters Tejinder Singh and Edwin Raju, who failed dope tests at the Games, was adjourned yet again on Sunday, but CAS said that a decision was likely in the first half of next week.

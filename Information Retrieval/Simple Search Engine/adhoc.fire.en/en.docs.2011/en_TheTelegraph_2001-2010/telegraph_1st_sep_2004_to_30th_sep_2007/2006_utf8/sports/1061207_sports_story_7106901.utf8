 PCB vetoes move to select duo vs WI

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has vetoed a move by the selectors and the team management to have fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif join the team for the last three one-day Internationals against West Indies. 

Sources in the board said chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf did not agree with captain Inzamam-ul Haq and the selectors that the two fast bowlers, who were cleared of doping bans Tuesday, should join the team immediately. 

The chairman was very firm about it and said the two must first play some domestic games before they are considered for selection, one source said. He said Inzamam had been particularly insistent about Asif who he pointed out had been training at the cricket academy in Lahore for the last two weeks and had played couple of club matches. 

Ashrafs decision, the source said, had not pleased Inzamam who had earlier already had differences with him over the omission of allrounder Shahid Afridi for the series. Inzamam and coach Bob Woolmer wanted Afridi in the side but didnt get their wish, the source said. 

Meanwhile, Dr Danish Zaheer, a member of the drug tribunal which lifted doping bans on Shoaib and Asif, has said the PCB should conduct fresh dope tests on the duo before allowing them to play international cricket again. 

 The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is to take up 

 the case with the ICC. A WADA official told a Pakistani 

 newspaper that the appeals commissions decision appeared 

 to be unreasonable and a violation of the anti-doping code.

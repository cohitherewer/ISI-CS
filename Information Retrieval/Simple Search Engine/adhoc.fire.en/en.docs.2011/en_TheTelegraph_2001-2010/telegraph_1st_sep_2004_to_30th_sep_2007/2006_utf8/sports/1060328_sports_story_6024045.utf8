 Bjorn Borg changes his mind

 Borg will not sell Big W trophies, rackets 

London: Bjorn Borg has decided not to sell 

his five replica Wimbledon trophies and two rackets he used during his winning 

streak at the tournament. 

Borg had said he was putting the items up for sale 

because he and his family needed long-term financial security. 

After great consideration, I have decided that I will never sell my Wimbledon trophies and rackets and I have withdrawn them from sale, the Swede said in a statement on Monday. 

I now realise how closely connected they are to my success as Wimbledons winner in 1976-80 and this revelation has caused me to reconsider my earlier intention to sell them. 

The trophies and two of the rackets he used in that winning streak had been expected to fetch up to ?300,000 at Bonhams auction in London of sports memorabilia on June 21. 

Andre Agassi had expressed interest in acquiring the trophies and rackets to keep them out of the wrong hands. 

Trophies of this kind have a meaning that goes beyond my comprehension of the victories, as they emphasise the bond between me as a player and all the people, family, friends and fans that have stood behind me through the years ? people that have my love and respect, Borg said. 

Dubbed Ice Man by the media for his emotionless 

performances, Borg raked in millions of dollars in prize money. (Reuters)

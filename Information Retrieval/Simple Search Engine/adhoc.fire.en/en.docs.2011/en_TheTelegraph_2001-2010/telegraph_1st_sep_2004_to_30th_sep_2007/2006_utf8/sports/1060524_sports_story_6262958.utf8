 Ronaldo is better: Parreira

Weggis (Switzerland): Brazil striker Ronaldo has recovered from the nagging thigh injury which forced him to miss the last six weeks of the Spanish season, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said on Tuesday. 

Parreira intends to field Ronaldo in Brazils opening World Cup match against Croatia on June 13, even though the 29-year-old will only regain full match fitness during the tournament. 

It seems that Ronaldo is better, hes been working with the ball and doing exercises of medium intensity, Parreira said on Tuesday. Ronaldo has been running and he just needs to regain match fitness. His weight is perfect. 

He last played in Reals 1-1 draw at home to Socieded on April 8 when he scored before limping off after an hour with an injury to his right thigh. 

Parreira said he had no intention of resting him from Brazils two warm-up games on May 30 and June 4.

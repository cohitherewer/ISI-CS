Mumbai: India dug themselves into a hole after an inept batting display and allowed England to seize the initiative at close on the second day in the third and final Test here Sunday. 

At 89 for three, in response to Englands first innings score of 400, the home side were battling for survival, their hopes resting on the ever-dependable skipper Rahul Dravid (37 batting) and Yuvraj Singh (32 batting) after being let down again by Virender Sehwag, Sachin Tendulkar and Wasim Jaffer. 

In an improved performance, the Indian bowlers restricted England to 400, taking the last six wickets for the addition of 74. Mediumpacer Sreesanth took four wickets, Harbhajan Singh three and Munaf Patel two, a meagre reward for his brilliant bowling. 

India, who had gifted the initiative to the visitors by putting them in after Dravid won the toss, required their batsmen to respond well thereafter, but that was not to be. 

Sehwag (6) fell in a now familiar fashion ? fending a short pitched ball from Matthew Hoggard into the slips ? and a nervous Sachin played an atrocious shot to be out for one. Opener Wasim Jaffer did no better by gloving Hoggard down the leg side to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones. 

Reduced to 28 for three, India managed to stem the rot somewhat through the 61-run fourth wicket partnership between Dravid and Yuvraj. 

The Punjab lefthander hit six fours in his counter-attacking 47-ball knock but a big battle awaited the Indian pair against Englands three-pronged pace attack on a wicket offering good bounce. 

Earlier, India fought back to stop a rampaging England from running away to a mammoth score. 

They were able to do so despite the fact that the fielders gave chances galore to rival captain Andrew Flintoff who made a hard-hitting 50 in 85 balls, embellished with six fours and three sixes. 

Flintoff and the other overnight unbeaten batsman Paul Collingwood (31) put on 84 runs in 27.4 overs and the going looked good for the visitors when this pair was at the crease with the indian fielders too in a generous mood. 

But once this stand was broken at 326, Collingwood falling to Sreesanth, the innings was thrown into disarray and ended half an hour before tea. 

The lone man to keep the innings going towards the end was Owais Shah, who had retired due to cramps in both the arms when on 50 Saturday. He resumed his interrupted innings at the fall of Collingwood and was ninth out for 88. 

Shah, who hit 13 fours and a six, was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh when Dravid, who had dropped the batsman four runs earlier off the same bowler, brought off a superb one-handed catch to his right. 

Munaf had earlier sent back Shaun Udal and Hoggard off successive balls only to be denied a hat-trick by Shah off the first ball of his next over. Munaf, unlucky not to have been rewarded for some spirited bowling late last evening and this morning, finally broke the jinx when he trapped Udal leg before with an in-swinger in the fifth over after lunch. 

Munaf then knocked over Hoggards leg stump with another big in-swinger off the sixth and last ball of the over. Harbhajan later sent back Shah before terminating the innings by having Anderson caught bat-pad at short leg. 

In the morning, England gained steadily before the hosts struck three mighty blows in the last half-hour to storm their way back into the match. 

Sreesanth and Anil Kumble struck twice in successive overs to send back both the batsmen within a span of eight balls and for the addition of only two runs to snatch back for the hosts some of the ground lost Satyrday and this morning.

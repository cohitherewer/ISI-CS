 Pakistan cricketers may seek pay-hike

 - Players ?unhappy? over missing lucrative deals 

 Inzamam 

Karachi: Dissatisfied with the present retainership fees being offered under the new contract system, Pakistani cricketers are all set to demand a pay-rise before they proceed on the tour of England. 

The cricketers want the PCB to either double their fees or release them from existing contracts so that they may strike individual deals. 

A verbal request in this regard has already been communicated to the PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan. 

With the World Cup just nine months away, we are receiving several lucrative offers but our hands are tied up. We are not trying to blackmail the PCB, but we want a pay-rise when the contracts are offered next month, sources in the Pakistan cricket team said on Monday. 

Under the existing central contracts that expire early June, cricketers contracted under category-A receive monthly retainer fees of Rs 200,000 ($3,333) while those who come under category-B are paid Rs 125,000 ($2,083). Players belonging to category-C get Rs 75,000 ($1,250). 

A top beverage company is the Pakistan team sponsor till 2009. According to the contract between the PCB and that firm, each cricketer receives Rs 1.4 million a year for using its logo, while the PCB receives more than a million dollars. 

Frankly speaking, the PCB contracts are damaging the interests of the cricketers. Lets face the fact that the PCB is minting money because of the players. And in return, the players are not getting their shares. PCB contracts with a beverage and cellular company are a case in point, the sources said. 

Another point of contention among the cricketers is that some of the leading players, including captain Inzamam-ul Haq, were receiving huge contracts. 

Meanwhile, Javed Miandad believes the ICCs endorsement of players being allowed to make appeals to the third umpire would make a mockery of the game. 

This will complicate things. It basically sends a message to the on-field umpires we dont have confidence in you, he was quoted as saying in a TV channel.

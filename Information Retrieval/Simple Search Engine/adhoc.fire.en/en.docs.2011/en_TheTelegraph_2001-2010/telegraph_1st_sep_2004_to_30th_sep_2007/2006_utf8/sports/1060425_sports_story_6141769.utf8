 Intensity same, ideas different: Yuvraj

New Delhi: Middle order batsman Yuvraj Singh on Monday said the arrival of Greg Chappell as the coach had made subtle differences to Team India which is fitter and chasing targets better than before. 

Yuvraj, who has been in scorching form this season, said the current intensity level of Indians while training remains the same as it was during the tenure of John Wright of New Zealand, but Chappell had more ideas. 

A few things have changed (since Chappell took over). The emphasis is on fitness. The intensity is the same as when John (Wright) was there, but the ideas are different under Chappell, Yuvraj said. 

The Punjab left hander was quick to point out that the team had their moments of glory under Wright. Remember we had beaten Australia in Australia and Pakistan in Pakistan, he said. 

Yuvraj, however, said the improvement in fitness did have a role to play in India becoming a strong chasing team in the one-dayers in recent times. Yes, we have young guys now who are fit. It is important to concentrate on fitness because we now have an 8-9 month calendar, he said. 

From his sensational debut in the International Cricket Council (ICC) Knock-Out Trophy in Kenya in 2000, through the euphoria of winning the NatWest final at Lords in 2002, to being dropped from the Test squad and being among the senior members of the team now, it has been a roller coaster ride for Yuvraj. 

It has been up and down, but that is the way you learn, the 24-year old Chandigarh player said. As a senior in the team I have responsibilities. I am focussing on doing my job better. 

There have been some vital lessons learnt on the way, like when he offered to open in the Nagpur Test against Australia in 2004 and was subsequently sacked before being reinstated. 

That is part of life. Everyone goes through it, but I wont make that mistake again, he said. 

He played down talks about him being touted as future captain. 

Every player wants to become captain. I have responsibilities but I have to go out there and prove myself, he said. 

Yuvraj sympathised with Mahendra Singh Dhoni who recently said the fans were not supporting the players when they were not doing well. 

Dhoni is young, he has just come into the team. He will slowly learn that that is the way with the media and the public, Yuvraj said. 

That (the fans fickleness) is not right, but the players have to learn, he said. 

Meanwhile, it turned out to be better late than never for Yuvraj. 

The Punjab batsman on Monday received his Man of the Series award ? a Ford Fiesta ? for the four-match limited overs contest against South Africa in October last year. But the fact that the prize was given to him almost six months after the series was over did not diminish the joy for the cricketer. 

I am still the Man of the Series, and you still remember it, Yuvraj said with a smile. 

Yuvraj said he has a passion for cars. I have a Honda CRV now ... The first car I had was a Maruti 800. 

On the upcoming West Indies tour, Yuvraj said it would serve as recce for the 2007 World Cup which is to be held in the Caribbean. 

It would be a good opportunity for the players to have a feel of the conditions and the climate there, the left-handed batsman said.

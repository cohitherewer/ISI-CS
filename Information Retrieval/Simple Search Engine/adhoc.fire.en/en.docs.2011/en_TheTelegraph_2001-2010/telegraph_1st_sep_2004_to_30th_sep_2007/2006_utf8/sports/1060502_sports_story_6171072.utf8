 Flexibility key to success: Dravid

New Delhi: Flexibility in the batting line-up and the ability of young players to perform various roles have been the key to Indias recent success in one-dayers, according to skipper Rahul Dravid. 

We have been able to develop players and give ourselves flexibility. People have been able to bat up the order, down the order, opening, anywhere. Theyre able to set up games, and equally, finish games, Dravid said. 

We have built a squad where were not reliant on a few people. Weve taken pressure off a few people and taken load off some of the senior players, he said in an interview to a magazine. 

He also admitted that Irfan Pathan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni had been critical to the balance of the side while a Yuvraj Singh and a Virender Sehwag had given him the option to play an extra batsman or an extra bowler. 

Its great to have multi-skilled , multi-faceted cricketers like these. Everyone cant be that way but there is room for a few guys in the squad who can do this. The key to this, though, is that these players must be able to hold their own with one discipline, and then contribute in another. Bits and pieces cricketers dont do the job for you. (PTI)

 Dempo held by Sporting

Panaji: Dempos keeper Abhijit Mondal fine performance under the bar helped them to draw against Sporting Clube de Goa in the opening match of the 10th ONGC National Football League, played at Nehru Stadium, here on Tuesday. 

The second half of the match was played under floodlights and both the teams complained about the fading light as one of the floodlight tower at the western stands failed to function. Referee K. Shankar stopped the play for nearly 22 minutes but continued after the local organising committee failed to rectify the fault. 

Sporting dominating the match throughout had to blame themselves for not collecting full points as they missed chances. Dempo coach, Armando Colaco said he gives full credit to his boys who snatched a point from Sporting inspite of injuries to their key players. Mondal was named MoM. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma blamed referee for not awarding a penalty in the first half for a handball on one of the Dempo defender. 

Sporting had possession for long in both the session but were frustrated by rival keeper Abhijit Mondal who made saves of Edeh Chidi and Joseph Pereira to deny Sporting the lead in the first half. 

Dempo had the best chance to forge ahead towards the end of the first half when Jules Dias powerful shot was blocked by keeper Luis Baretto, the deflection went to Sameer Naik whose shot was saved on the goal line by defender Vincent Pires. 

Earlier, Luis had to stretch himself to put out a back pass by Adebayo Adewusi. The change of ends, saw Sporting exerting tremendous pressure on the rival defence with Chidi constantly posing threat, was unlucky in the second half when his powerful shot hit the post and went out. (PTI)

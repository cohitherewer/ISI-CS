 Japan hold Croatia 0-0

 - Its a crime that we Again had to play in this heat: Zico 

Nuremberg: Japan and Croatia played to a 0-0 draw on Sunday, a result that leaves both teams in danger of failing to advance at the World Cup. 

 Both teams had numerous chances to win the Group F match, but solid goalkeeping on both sides left the teams with just one point with one match remaining. 

 Japan face defending champion Brazil in their final match, while Croatia play Australia. 

Croatia came close in the 54th minute with Niko Kranjcar lunging for a pass from Ivan Klasnic and missing wide of the post. 

Trying to boost his offensive chances, Japan coach Zico sent Junichi Inamoto in to start the second half in place of Takashi Fukunishi. Keiji Tamada came on in the 61st minute, replacing Atsushi Yanagisawa. 

Japan came close early in the second half. Akira Kaji sent a cross to Yanagiswa, who redirected the pass wide of the post. 

Croatia had the better chances in the first half and would have taken the lead if not for several good saves from Japan goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi. 

 Japan captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto took Dado Prso down in the area in the 21st minute, drawing a penalty and a yellow card. 

But Kawaguchi denied Darijo Srna from the penalty spot, diving to his left to stop the low shot. 

Kranjcar hit the crossbar with a blast from the top of the area in the 28th. 

 Both teams are making their third straight World Cup appearance. The last time the teams met, Croatia defeated Japan 1-0 at the 1998 World Cup in France. 

 Japan lost their opening match to Australia 1-3. Croatia lost to Brazil 0-1. 

Japans best chance in the opening half came when Hidetoshi Nakata rifled a long-range blast in the 37th minute that goalkeeper Stipe Pletikosa got a hand on after diving to his left. 

Japan coach Zico said it was criminal that his team had to play another afternoon match in hot weather. 

Its a crime that we again had to play in this heat, said the Brazilian after his team fired blanks in the Group F match. 

Our last game was at three clock too, but they want to do it that way for television. I guess business is business. 

The temperature at the Frankenstadion was 27 Celsius (82 Fahrenheit) during the match. 

We saw a very hard and tough game which we dominated, said Croatia coach Zlatko Kranjcar. I congratulate the Croatian and Japanese players for playing in that heat. 

We had a lot of chances but again didnt score, and that is a problem for us. We were better organised but had a bit of bad luck. We can work more on concentration and calmness. 

Croatia had 16 shots to Japans 12 during the match but only six were on target compared to five for Zicos team. 

If we win the next game (against Australia on Thursday) we go to the next round, said Kranjcar. 

The players still have enough strength to get a good enough result to go through...

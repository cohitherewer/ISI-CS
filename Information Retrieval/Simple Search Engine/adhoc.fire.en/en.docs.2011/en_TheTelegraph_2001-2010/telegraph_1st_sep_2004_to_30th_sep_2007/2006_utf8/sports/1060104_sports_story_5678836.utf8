The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Michael Owen operated upon

London: England and Newcastle United striker Michael Owen underwent surgery on Tuesday to repair the broken toe he sustained playing against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. 

Owen had a metal pin inserted on the fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the operation in a Manchester hospital, the Newcastle website reported. 

He suffered the injury in a collision with Tottenhams England goalkeeper Paul Robinson and is likely to be out of action for between two and three months. 

A March return would give Newcastles record signing plenty of time to return to full fitness ahead of the World Cup. England play their first group game against Paraguay in Frankfurt on June 10. 

With 35 goals from his 75 international appearances the 26-year-old is a vital part of Sven-Goran Erikssons World Cup plans. 

England teammates David Beckham, Wayne Rooney, Gary Neville and Ashley Cole have also all had similar injuries. 

Newcastle manager Graeme Souness had told the clubs website that he thinks its the same bone that David Beckham broke. 

Its an almighty blow for us amid a disappointing Christmas. I cannot tell you how big a miss Michael will be. Its an absolute disaster for him and an absolute disaster for us. 

Owens injury is a huge blow for Souness who paid ?17 million ($29 million) to bring the striker back to English football from Real Madrid in August. 

Despite Newcastles mediocre form, the 26-year-old has forged a dangerous strike partnership with former England team mate Alan Shearer.

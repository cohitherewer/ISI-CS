 CAB receives letter

A STAFF REPORTER

 Dalmiya Expulsion 

Calcutta: The CAB on Monday evening received the copy of BCCIs resolution adopted at the Jaipur meeting expelling Jagmohan Dalmiya and other related papers. 

The association will call a working committee meeting early next week to discuss the issue and decide on the course of action. 

The resolution adopted at the special general body meeting also says Dalmiya cannot continue as president of the state association. It also lists the charges against him in detail. 

It is likely that Dalmiya will move court against the decision.

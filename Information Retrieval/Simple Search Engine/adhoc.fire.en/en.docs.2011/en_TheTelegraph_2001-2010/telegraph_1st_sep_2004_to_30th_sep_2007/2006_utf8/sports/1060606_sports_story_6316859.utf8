 Sachin targets August return

London: Sachin Tendulkar is targeting the one-day tri-series in Sri Lanka in August for his comeback. 

Tendulkar said it would take him another 3-4 weeks to be completely fit after which he would let his bat do the talking. Its been a couple of months since the surgery and the strength levels are reasonably back, he said. 

I wouldnt say that I am totally happy with it, and neither of the doctors are totally happy with the strength levels, but I have regained a fair amount of the strength and it should take another three or four weeks for me to be 100 per cent fit, he said here. 

Tendulkar said he might remain in the UK for at least another month before returning to action. 

Nothing is planned as of now. I just want to get fit and not be under pressure to be fit before any specific date. I will look to play some exhibition games and probably now is the time to start looking around for the people who organise those. 

Its going to be hard work because I am not 17 any more. The recovery does take longer than when you are younger ... But I am not that old either, he told a TV channel at Lords. 

It is important that I dont try to get back in action earlier than my schedule. It wouldnt be advisable and could lead to some other injury ? thats what the doctors have told me. 

Tendulkar dismissed the views of those who doubt whether he would be able to make a return to top form. 

I dont need to react to what people say about me. Thats their opinion. A lot of people had predicted many things ? such as before the 2003 World Cup when I had a terrible tour of new zealand ? but I will let my bat talk. 

I know my body better than anyone and I know how much cricket there is left in me. You get these people that like to open their mouths occasionally without thinking. There are bound to be good opinions and bad opinions. You have to take it in your stride and not worry about what X, Y, Z is saying. They are paid to say these things and they have a job and have to make the statements. Sometimes its in your favour, sometimes its not. 

Asked whether he still had an appetite for the game, Tendulkar said: If the hunger isnt there then I shouldnt be playing. The hunger is there. Ive always loved the sport and that is why I am here training hard and looking forward to be back in action as soon as possible. The hunger will always be there. 

I am very sure there is some cricket left in me and plenty of runs. I just want to fight back hard and to get fit becomes my priority now, and once I am fit I am sure that things will follow in the right place. 

Tendulkar also spoke about how he was desperate to make it to the tour of West Indies, but pulled out when advised by doctors against rushing his comeback. 

After my surgery I was tempted to go to the West Indies and I was working hard. Eventually the physios and the doctors got together and said, its just not happening ... There is a lot of risk involved and youve not fully recovered. That convinced me to take a backward step.

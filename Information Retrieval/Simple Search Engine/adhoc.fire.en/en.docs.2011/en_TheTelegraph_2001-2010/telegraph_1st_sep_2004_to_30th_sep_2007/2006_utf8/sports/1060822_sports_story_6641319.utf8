 Bhupathi-Gimelstob to face third seeds

 Pilot Pen Meet

 New Delhi: Mahesh Bhupathi 

 and his American partner Justin Gimelstob will open their 

 campaign at the $675,000 Pilot Pen Tennis Tournament against 

 the third-seeded polish pair of Mariusz Fyrstenberg and 

 Marcin Matkowski at New Haven, Connecticut.

 If they manage to get past their 

 first round opponents, the Indo-US pair would face another 

 stern examination against winners of the match between the 

 Chilean pair of Jose Acasuso and Juan Ignacio Chela and 

 the American wild cards Thomas Blake and Roy Kalmanovich.

 Australian Paul Hanley and Kevin 

 Ullyet of Zimbabwe are the top seeds in the last tournament 

 before the US Open followed by the Israeli combination of 

 Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram.

 Leander Paes and his Czech partner 

 Martin Damm are taking the week off to prepare for the final 

 Grand Slam of the year.

 In the latest ATP doubles rankings, 

 Paes and Bhupathi held on to their 12th and 26th spots, 

 respectively.

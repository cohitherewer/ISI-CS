 Leander balm after Mahesh outburst

 - Controversy erupts on day of glory 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: Minutes after Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won the mens doubles gold medal in the Asian Games here, the soap opera had begun in right earnest. 

A remark made by Paes to a section of the media immediately after the victory ceremony that he would never pair up with Bhupathi again, created big confusion at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex. So much so, that it invited strong reactions from Bhupathi, who retaliated by saying, Well, it could be the end of the road for both of us. 

A week ago, the relationship between Indias most successful doubles pair turned sour when Paes blamed Bhupathi for losing the match against Chinese Taipei in the team event. It snowballed into a big controversy before the All India Tennis Association (AITA) officials stepped in to resolve the issue. 

Later, after Paes and Sania Mirza paired up to give India their second gold medal in tennis, the Indian captain explained that his comment was not meant to break the relationship with Bhupathi. 

All I wanted to say was that I am not going to play with him (Bhupathi) on a regular basis, Paes said. I already have a regular partner in the circuit (Martin Damm). So the question of playing with Mahesh does not arise. 

Paes said that he was pained to find that such a controversy has erupted up on a day when he and Bhupathi won the gold for India in a memorable doubles match. 

I consider Mahesh as a stalwart of our time. We have won some great matches together in Davis Cup. He is always welcome to play with me in Davis Cup. 

But the problem is that the fire-fighting by Paes came a bit too late since he was busy playing in the mixed doubles for about two hours. By that time, Bhupathi had already spoken to the media, lambasting Paes for his comments. 

Immediately after the doubles final, Bhupathi said that it was a memorable match for him as he wanted to prove quite a few things. 

There were some people who doubted my integrity. They also said that I didnt give my hundred per cent. It is not done. I have proved my point now, he said. 

Later when asked about Paes reported remarks that the Indian captain has decided not to play with him again, a furious Bhupathi shot back saying that let it be like that, if he wishes to. 

For 12 years I have lived with these comments, said Bhupathi. It really hurts now. I know my tennis and aware of my calibre. I am not going to touch anyones feet to play with me. I am happy that this relationship has come to an end on a high.

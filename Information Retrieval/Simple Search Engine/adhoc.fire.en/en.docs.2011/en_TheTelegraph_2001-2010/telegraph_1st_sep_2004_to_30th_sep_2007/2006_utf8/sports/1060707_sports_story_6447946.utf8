The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Player of the Day

 Zinedine Zidane 

When two legends of modern day football ? Zinedine Zidane and Luis Figo ? came together for the one last hurrah, the Frenchman emerged the runaway winner in his indomitable style. 

His sublime touches, control of the ball and often thrust at speed, not only overshadowed the flashy brilliance of the Portuguese skipper, but also ended Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolaris amazing run of 12 consecutive victories in the World Cup. 

Now Zidane has the perfect stage to take his leave of the game with France having the chance to make it two World Cup triumphs in three attempts. 

The coolness with which Zidane struck the only goal of the match from the penalty was a treat to watch. After all, Portugal custodian Ricardo had set a World Cup record with his three saves in the penalty shoot-out in the previous match against England. 

Ricardo later said that he could tell from the England players eyes that they were going to miss. Presumably this time he detected only stone-cold certainty staring back at him from Zidane. Two steps back and then an imperious sweep of the Frenchmans right boot propelled the ball low into the right-hand corner and just out of the goalkeepers reach. 

Like all other great players, Zidane never forgets to congratulate the rivals after the match. On Wednesday, he showed his respect for Figo. After embracing Figo, Zidane gave him an affectionate peck on the cheek. It was a moment of triumph for the sport.

 Burnout may derail Ashes campaign, feels Gilchrist

Sydney: Vice-captain Adam Gilchrist believes player burnout could jeopardise Australias chances of winning back the Ashes. 

The ICC Champions Trophy in India is scheduled to start in October, with the final slated just over two weeks before the first Test against England in Brisbane on November 23. 

We have to get our priorities right, Gilchrist told an Australian daily on Tuesday. 

It is important that selectors, administrators, players and whoever else involved sit down and chalk that out. 

Gilchrist said Cricket Australia (CA) needed to find the right balance between the needs of individual players and the team. 

I am not saying no one goes, or all key players but we definitely have to sit down and address it, he said. I think we have to look very, very seriously at that lead-in to the Ashes, he said. 

There is the Champions Trophy, and I believe there are potential other games of one-day cricket that may come up prior to that. We are going to have to be very careful about what we want to prioritise as most important. 

CA operations manager Michael Brown said the issue was in hand. 

We are worried about the whole seven months of cricket, he said. The ICC Champions Trophy is clearly important to CA. Well be sending a very good team, the best team available at the time. 

For us, the ICC tournaments are of No.1 importance. We have never won a Champions Trophy and would like to win it. 

Part of our strategic plan is to lead the world in cricket performance so to entertain the thought that were going to be mass resting players is not going to happen. What we will do is individually manage every players workload over the period.

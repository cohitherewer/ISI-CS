 Mahesh decision unconditional 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mahesh Bhupathi has reversed his decision not to play for the country. The doubles ace will represent India at next months Asian Games. 

Its only the Asian Games for the time being I wont be playing Davis Cup unless India make the World Group play-off stage, Bhupathi said on Friday. 

The change of heart was a result of discussions with people like AITA secretary Anil Khanna and IOA president Suresh Kalmadi. 

Its an unconditional decision to play the Asian Games there are no strings attached, Bhupathi said. 

Leander Paes had said he would sit with Bhupathi to sort out the problems after the former had made the startling announcement last month. 

But such a meeting hadnt materialised. 

We have not had a chat since the Mumbai tournament. I will see him in Doha again, before we play, said Bhupathi.

New Delhi: Time is fast running out for Bhaichung Bhutia to join the national camp which started in Calcutta on Saturday. If sources in the All India Football Federation (AIFF) are to be believed, then the doors of the national squad could be shut for Bhutia, at least temporarily, if he does not join the camp by Monday evening. 

While Bhutia, who is currently in Sikkim, said he would talk to national coach Bob Houghton on his return to Calcutta on Sunday, federation sources indicated that the coach may not wait beyond Monday for the ace striker to join the camp. 

It may be recalled that Bhutia has not been called to the camp and his joining will depend on his tete-a-tete with Houghton. 

We are certainly not happy in the manner Bhutia is behaving now, said a federation official. Bob has arrived in Calcutta on August 2 and was looking forward to meet Bhutia to discuss the issue. Bhutia, too, said he would meet the coach. He is yet to keep his words. 

Houghton, federation sources said, may not entertain Bhutia anymore if the glamour boy of India football does not spell out his priorities in the next couple of days. Bhaichung as a footballer has definitely impressed the coach, but he is unlikely to compromise on discipline beyond a certain point. 

Bhutia, on his part, was yet not sure whether to join the camp. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Sikkim, he said: I am returning to Calcutta on Sunday and will talk to coach immediately. Then only I will decide about joining the camp. Asked what exactly stopping him from playing for India, Bhutia said: I am not feeling motivated enough at the moment. 

Though the federation may be forced to play the discipline card at the end, what really bugging them, as well as the team management is the national squads lack of strength in the forwardline. 

In the four-nation tournament in Canada, it was proved that Sunil Chhetri and Sushil Singh are yet not matured enough to shoulder the responsibilities. Houghton is desperately looking for a positive striker and as of now, Bhutia could be the only answer to his problems. 

The mood of the Indian camp was best reflected in manager Pradeep Chowdhurys words. All of us want Bhaichung to play for India. But, then, he should join the camp first.

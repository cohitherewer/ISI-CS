Calcutta: The Indian Football Associations intervention notwithstanding, the stand-off between East Bengal and Mike Okoro is far from over. And the foreigners chances of playing in the Derby clash against Mohun Bagan on Saturday, it now seems, are as good as over. 

The striker, who fell out with the club officials over payment problems, finally showed up during the teams practice at the Howrah Municipal Stadium on Thursday, but he was left with nothing but watching the proceedings from the sidelines. 

He sat for an hour in front of the teams dressing room and then left the ground in a huff. The message from the team management must be clear to him now that in the coach Philippe de Ridders scheme of things, he has no place against Mohun Bagan, if not beyond that match. 

It was further accentuated by the fact that none of the club officials ? including vice-president Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta who had signed a peace treaty with Okoro on Monday in presence of the IFA secretary Subrata Dutta ? bothered to talk to him during his brief stay at the ground. 

The players also didnt wish to comment on the issue, insisting that their sole focus was now on the match against Mohun Bagan. 

Their importance to the Derby could also be gauged from the fact that the Belgian coach has called for practice on the match-eve, marking a departure from his stand of giving the players break before the match on two previous occasions. Alvito D Cunha, meanwhile, felt the midfield holds the key for both teams on Saturday. Both teams have a settled midfield and one who will play better would have the last laugh, he maintained. 

 The Cameroonian Guy Ndem Herve, however, said that Bhaichung (Bhutia) will make the difference. No body will argue with him.

 Sangakkara dashes Bangla hopes

Chittagong: A dashing century from Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 78 runs and clinch the ODI series 2-1 on Saturday. 

Sangakkara struck 109 as his side amassed 309 for seven in their 50 overs before the hosts, seeking their first-ever ODI series victory, stopped at 231 for nine. 

Skipper Mahela Jayawardene (51) and Kaushal Lokuarachchi (69) added 75 and 104, respectively, with Sangakkara as Sri Lanka put the game out of Bangladeshs reach. 

The hosts hopes were given an early lift when a double-strike from Mashrafe Mortaza removed Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga to leave Sri Lanka on 17 for two. 

But Sangakkara and Jayawardene steadied the boat with a solid stand before the captain, who faced 56 balls and hit eight fours, was caught and bowled by Mohammed Rafique. 

Lokuarachchi continued the momentum with three enormous sixes in his 57-ball cameo before being bowled by Rafique.

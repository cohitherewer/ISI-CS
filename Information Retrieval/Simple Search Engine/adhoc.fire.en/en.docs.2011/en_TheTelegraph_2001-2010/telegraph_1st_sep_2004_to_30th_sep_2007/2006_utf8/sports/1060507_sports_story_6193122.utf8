 Sasi looks to crack 2700 Elo-mark

Sarajevo: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran is seeded No. 2 in the Bosnia Grandmasters tournament, behind European champion Liviu Diter Nisipeanu of Romania. The Category-18 Super Grandmasters meet, in which Norwegian teenager Magnus Carlsen will be the cynosure, gets underway on Sunday. 

Riding high on success this year, Sasikirans main target will be to earn 11 Elo rating points and thus cross the coveted 2700-mark. Sasikiran, the second-highest rated Indian behind Viswanathan Anand, is competing in a Category-18 event for the first time. 

Vladimir Malakhov of Russia, Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany and local star Borki Predojevic complete the six-player line-up with an impressive average of 2659 Elo rating. 

Each player will meet the other twice in the 10-round event. 

Sasikiran will have to score at least seven points out of a possible 10 to earn the required Elo points for the coveted 2700-mark. 

The event will also be an excellent warm-up for Sasikiran before the Chess Olympiad to be held in Turin from May 19.

Sydney: Jacques Kallis and Ashwell Prince completed half-centuries in an unbroken 144-run partnership to lead a brave South African fightback on the opening day of the third and final Test against Australia on Monday. 

Kallis scored an unbeaten 80 while Prince made 62 not out to help the Proteas recover from a shaky start and reach stumps on 230 for three at the Sydney Cricket Ground. 

The pair defied the Australian bowlers for more than three hours to vindicate Graeme Smiths decision to bat first on a lively pitch that initially suited the seamers but flattened out later in the day. 

The entire morning session was washed out because of rain and Smiths decision to pad up first on a grassy wicket looked to have backfired when the tourists lost three wickets between lunch and tea. 

Australias express paceman Brett Lee made an early breakthrough when he dismissed AB de Villiers for two in the sixth over of the day then Glenn McGrath removed Herschelle Gibbs for 27. 

Lee added the scalp of Smith for 39 to reduce the Proteas to 86 for three before Kallis and Prince launched their recovery mission, batting through the extended final session without any further losses. 

De Villiers had a lucky escape in the third over when he was dropped at second slip by Australia captain Ricky Ponting, playing his 100th Test, but failed to make the most of his let-off when he edged Lee behind to wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist. 

Gibbs, who made 94 in Melbourne last week, batted for over an hour and struck five boundaries before he dragged a ball from McGrath back onto his stumps with the total on 69. 

Smith, who had made scores of 34, 30, 22 and 25, held firm for more than two hours before he wasted another promising start when Lee struck him plumb in front. 

Kallis and Prince survived through to tea before raising the tempo in the final session with a chanceless partnership. 

Kallis, was lost his ranking as the worlds No. 1 batsmen to Ponting last week, batted 226 minutes and faced 181 balls and struck 13 boundaries in his flawless display while Prince hit seven fours off 128 balls and 191 minutes at the crease. 

South Africa made two changes to the side that lost in Melbourne in an attempt to square the series after the first Test in Perth was drawn. 

Charl Langeveldt was recalled for injured fast bowler Makhaya Ntini while uncapped spinner Johan Botha replaced Nicky Boje after he failed to take a wicket in Melbourne. 

Australia made just one change with Justin Langer returning from injury at the expense of Phil Jaques, who made his debut in Melbourne.

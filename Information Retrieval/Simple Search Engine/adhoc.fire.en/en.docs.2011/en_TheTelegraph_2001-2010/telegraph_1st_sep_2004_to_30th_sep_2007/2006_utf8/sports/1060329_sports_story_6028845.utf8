 Warne spearheads series victory

 - Leg-spinners 35th five-wkt haul 

 Warne in Durban on Tuesday 

Durban: Shane Warne grabbed six wickets to spearhead Australia to an unbeatable 2-0 series victory over South Africa on Tuesday. 

Despite stiff resistance shown by the South Africans for most of the final day of the second Test, the Australians surged to victory by 112 runs after leg-spinner Warne claimed six for 86. It was his 35th five-wicket haul in Tests. 

South Africa, who were set a target of 410, were dismissed for 297 with 6.1 overs left in the match. Mark Boucher fought hard for his unbeaten 51. 

South Africa resumed on 29 without loss, and AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith comfortably negotiated the challenges posed by the Australian seam attack in the first hour. 

Warne came on to bowl in the second hour of the days play, and he struck with his fourth delivery when De Villiers over balanced as he lunged forward to try and smother a leg-break. 

The batsman missed the ball and was stumped by wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist for 46 to end an opening stand of 91. 

Warne removed Smith four overs later when the lefthander swept at a leg-break and was caught off the glove by Justin Langer at leg slip for 40. 

Jacques Kallis was Warnes next victim when he was trapped in front for seven.

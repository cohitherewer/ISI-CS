 BCCI to approach govt through Pawar

 - Gibbs-Boje clearance

New Delhi: The BCCI said on Thursday it would try to clear the decks for the participation of Herschelle Gibbs and Nicky Boje in the Champions Trophy but stopped short of giving a categorical assurance. 

The tainted South African duo was mentioned in the course of Delhi Polices investigation into the match-fixing scandal that rocked the game in 2000. The two have twice kept away from an India tour ? in 2004 for two Tests and in 2005 for a five ODIs ? apprehending arrest by Delhi Police. 

BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said the board would try to make use of president Sharad Pawars ministerial office, but added that it was a police case and involved legal matters. 

We will go (to the government) through Pawar (Union minister for agriculture), Shah said. We are keen to see Boje and Gibbs play. We want the best teams to play.

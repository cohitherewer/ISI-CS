The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Great learning 

 experience for Sania

 For 

 the stout of heart, defeats are the starting blocks for 

 the future. They help to find the path for improvement, 

 and provide an accurate assessment of your standing and 

 shortcomings. A much-improved Sania Mirza, looking lean 

 and athletic, with an improved backhand and serve, was bundled 

 out 6-1, 6-0 in the semi-finals of the Sunfeast Open by 

 Martina Hingis. 

 A stunned silence descended on 

 the stadium, at what seemed a humiliating defeat. But Hingis 

 was not just being nice when she said that the score did 

 not truly reflect the contest. There were many hotly contested 

 rallies as Sania threw everything into the match. But Hingis 

 was just too good. 

 Grand Slam champions are a different 

 species and Hingis mercilessly exposed the difference in 

 class. On Sanias current form when she defeated 

 the tough French-Iranian Rezai in the quarters and her close 

 match with Hingis in Dubai earlier in the year it seemed 

 that she had a good chance of defeating Hingis. But this 

 was not the same Hingis we saw in Dubai.

 With constant competitive play, 

 her form is now close to her former highest levels. It was 

 a joy to watch Hingis. Her all court game with smooth balanced 

 movement and perfectly-timed ground shots and great experience 

 will make her a threat to any of the top ten women. The 

 match was a revelation and showed how much more Sania needs 

 to do to learn to get and stay at the top levels of the 

 game.

 First and foremost, Sania must 

 understand that depth of shot is more important than extra 

 speed. It does two things. Firstly, it pushes your opponent 

 back giving you more time in between shots. An extra depth 

 of a yard and a half translates into three yards of time, 

 because the ball has to travel both ways. Secondly, it reduces 

 the angle your opponent can use to make you lose position. 

 The deep shot may not be spectacular but it causes a poor 

 return which enables you to hit winners.

 One of Ramanathan Krishnans 

 great strengths was the depth of his shots. One very seldom 

 saw him scampering on court because of the extra time his 

 deep shots gave him. Sania played many spectacular looking 

 shots, but they were short of length and Hingis had no difficulty 

 in tackling them. 

 Like Federer, Hingis plays from 

 the baseline and does not stand far back like most of the 

 players do nowadays. She hits the ball early which increases 

 the speed of return and puts the opponent under pressure. 

 But, for Sania there is no reason 

 to despair. She will continue to be a problem to those in 

 the top ten, specially those whose games have a higher percentage 

 of unforced errors. Hingis, at this level, gives nothing 

 away and when in form has possibly the lowest percentage 

 of unforced errors. Tackling her is like playing against 

 par on a difficult golf course. 

 Her match against Hingis has been 

 a great learning experience for Sania. Only 19 years of 

 age, Sania has a lot to learn. Rather than find out for 

 herself how to close out matches she will progress much 

 faster if an experienced coach can tell her what to do. 

 At Wimbledon, she played a fantastic 

 match against Dementieva, one of the toughest players ranked 

 No. 6 in the world, but in spite of leading 5-2 in the first 

 set tie breaker she failed to clinch the set.

 Happily Sania seemed unfazed by 

 the loss to Hingis. The chip on the shoulder is still there! 

 She should dig her spurs deep into her ribs, work even harder 

 and explode from the starting blocks.

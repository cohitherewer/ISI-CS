 Bengal coach measures up possible foes

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Thirty-seven years ago in Nowgong, Bengal met Services in the Santosh Trophy final. It was one of the most one-sided title clashes in the history of the national championship as Bengal crushed their rivals 6-1. 

Much water has flown through the Ganges since. As Services could be a possible rival in the next round, Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee sat through the entire Services-Chandigarh cluster IV match with his full squad. 

One could gauge the Bengal coachs anxiety. With a not too strong squad at his disposal, Banerjee did not want to take any chances. A good side, they could be a threat to any team, the coach said. Services won 4-1 under their shrewd coach Stanley Rozario. 

The battle of two north-east states proved to be a lively affair as Assam beat Sikkim 5-3. Assam, who were sitting pretty with a 4-0 lead at halftime, suddenly found themselves at the receiving end as Sikkim pulled back three . At Gurgaon, Meghalaya beat Mizoram 1-0 and UP beat Andaman and Nicobar 3-0.

 Federer breezes past Henman; top women in a hurry as well 

 - Colombian qualifier humbles No. 9 seed Davydenko 

 Maria Sharapova after winning her first-round match on Wednesday 

Wimbledon: The top women were in a big hurry at Wimbledon on Wednesday. So was Roger Federer. The three-time defending mens champion routed Tim Henman 6-4, 6-0, 6-2 ? winning 11 straight games at one point to move into the third round and extend his record grasscourt winning streak to 43 matches. 

Defending womens champ Venus Williams, former winner Maria Sharapova and top-seeded Amelie Mauresmo swept their first-round matches in less than an hour ? losing only three games between them. 

Williams crushed 103rd-ranked American Bethanie Mattek 6-1, 6-0 in 51 minutes on Centre Court; Sharapova took the same amount of time to dispatch Anna Smashnova 6-2, 6-0, and Mauresmo beat Croatian qualifier Ivana Abramovic 6-0, 6-0 in 39 minutes. 

Second-seeded Kim Clijsters needed even less time to reach the third round: she advanced courtesy a walkover from Viktoriya Kutuzova, pulled out with a viral infection. 

Andy Roddick had to fight for nearly three hours to overcome Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia, serving 28 aces in a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-6 (6), 6-2 first-round victory. 

In one of the most compelling matches of the tournament, with both players diving full length onto the grass to reach shots, the turning point came when Roddick came from 5-4 down to win the third-set tie-breaker. 

Roddick then broke at love for a 3-1 lead in the fourth set, thumping his fist on his heart, and cruised the rest of the way. He saved all nine break-points against him in the match, converting three of the four he earned. 

Federer, who took 85 minutes to dismantle Henman on Centre Court, looks untouchable as he bids to become the third man in the Open era to win four straight Wimbledon titles. 

Henman, a four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist who was unseeded this year because of a drop in his ranking, was no match for the top-ranked Swiss star in a big letdown for the British fans still hoping for a first homegrown mens champion since Fred Perry in 1936. 

The womens mismatches didnt help the push for equal prize-money at Wimbledon, the only Grand Slam which pays the womens singles champion less than the men. Even British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Wednesday he backs the call for equal pay. 

As defending champion, Williams normally would have opened play on Centre Court on Tuesday, but the match was pushed back because rain delays washed out most of Mondays action. 

She wasted no time Wednesday, overwhelming the 21-year-old Mattek with power, pace and swinging volleys ? 26 winners in all ? and few sloppy errors. I felt good out there, Williams said. It seemed like I had all the right answers when she came up with some very good shots. 

Williams, Wimbledon champion in 2000, 2001 and 2005, faced only one break point ? which she saved with an ace in the second game of the second set. From there, she won the last 11 points on her serve. 

Sharapova unleashed 27 winners against Smashnova, handing the 42nd-ranked Israeli her sixth straight first-round loss at the All England Club. 

Mauresmo lost only 17 points against the 192nd-ranked Abramovic, who was playing in her first Grand Slam match. 

Its one of the greatest matches that Ive played here, Mauresmo said. I dont know if also the fact that my opponent was not so good made it easy for me. 

Among men, 2002 champion Lleyton Hewitt cruised past Italys Filippo Volandri 6-1, 6-1, 6-3. The man Hewitt beat in the 2002 final, fourth-seeded David Nalbandian, defeated Frances Arnaud Clement 6-4, 6-4, 6-3. No. 5 Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia won a five-set marathon against Spains Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 11-9. 

 No. 9 Nikolay Davydenko of Russia 

 became the highest seeded player to go out when he fell 

 6-2, 6-7, 6-7, 3-6 to Colombian qualifier Alejandro Falla. 

 And No. 17 Robby Ginepri was ousted by fellow-American Mardy 

 Fish 3-6, 2-6, 4-6. (AP)

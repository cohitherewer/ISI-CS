The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No matter what you do, you cant please everybody, insists John Wright

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 Life hasnt been dull, but it has definitely been quieter after April 2005...

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Wright 

Jaipur: How is Sourav (Ganguly)? was John Wrights question before The Telegraph could fire one at him Sunday afternoon, during Englands innings at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium. Having worked with Sourav for four-and-half years, his entire innings as coach (from November 2000 to April 2005), Wright probably felt it would be proper to ask a Calcuttan about Indias most successful Test captain irrespective of the views he has expressed in his recently-released book, Indian Summers. In the city on a Champions Trophy-related Media assignment, Wright spoke exclusively for about 15 minutes. 

The following are excerpts 

On his emotions when Team India took the field against England 

I felt proud that Id been associated with the team for four-and-half years... It was great seeing the boys go out... Actually, its great to be back watching live cricket in India... 

On whether he has missed wearing the coachs hat 

In some ways, yes... In some ways, no... Ive missed the passion which surrounds Indian cricket... Ive missed the excitement... Life hasnt been dull, but it has definitely been quieter after April 2005... At the same time, I dont have to face the same pressures... Then, Ive been able to spend time with my sons (George and Harry). My feelings are mixed. 

On whether his one-time wards have been in touch with him 

Some of them, yes... 

On successor Greg Chappell 

He has his style and the team has made progress... This afternoon, for example, the team began very well... 

On Rahul Dravids 12 months as full-time captain 

In the past year, its only today that I could watch him in person... Hes doing well certainly did well in the afternoon... One keeps learning... So, the more he captains, the better he will be. Id always felt Rahul would be good in the hot seat. 

On whether hes still looking for a job 

Yeah... Im going to need a real job at some stage... Ive got some land in Christchurch (for farming) and Ive done some coaching with youngsters. 

On talk that he may succeed John Bracewell as New Zealands coach 

(Grins) Well, youve got to look at every opportunity... At this stage I cant say anything except that Ive not been approached by New Zealand Cricket. Of course, coaching a national team will again mean staying away from the family for long periods. 

On Indian Summers creating ripples across India 

I tried to maintain the trust of the players... I tried to do an honest job and have been consistent with things Ive said over a period of time for example, the stuff about selection committees. Its not that Ive had an agenda... Nothing should be taken personally. In any case, no matter what you do, you cant please everybody. Thats life. 

On whether he regrets having ruffled some feathers 

Ive just tried to be honest. (After a pause) I worked with a good bunch of boys. 

On whether he intends catching up with the Dravids 

At some point during this tournament, yes. 

On whether Sourav ought to retire 

Its a personal thing, but its remarkable that he has retained the hunger and passion for cricket. Its a big thing. 

Finally, on the favourites to lift the Champions Trophy 

Australia... However, Im hoping India do very well.

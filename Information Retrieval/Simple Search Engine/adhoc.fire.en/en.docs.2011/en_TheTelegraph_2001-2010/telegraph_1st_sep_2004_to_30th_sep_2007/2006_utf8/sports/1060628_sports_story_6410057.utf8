 Cannavaro annoyed

Duisburg: Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro said he was annoyed by suggestions that his team had been lucky to beat Australia in Mondays World Cup second-round match and said their opponents had been the fortunate ones. 

It annoys me to hear this stuff about Italy being lucky after all that we produced in that game, Cannavaro said after training on Tuesday. How many shots on target did they have? One or two. We had six or seven chances to kill the game off, he said. 

In Kaiserslautern, Marcello Lippi insisted his Italy side fully deserved the victory. I definitely wouldnt say we were lucky, said the 58-year-old after Italy extended their unbeaten run to 22 internationals. We had four or five good opportunities to score and their keeper made some great saves, he said.

Mumbai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday dedicated the forthcoming Champions Trophy in India to the spirit of cricket and roped in several players, including Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag, to promote the theme. 

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed called upon all the players and officials to use the 10-team limited overs extravaganza as a springboard in the quest to uphold the spirit of the game. 

This (the call) is just to emphasise that all the players are aware of the spirit of cricket when the sport, as well as many others, is under great scrutiny, Speed said. 

Significantly, no player from England or Pakistan has been roped in so far to support the ICC in its latest endeavour. 

But ICCs media and communications manager Brian Murgatroyd explained that it was not done because the two teams were still engaged in a one-day series. 

After reading out the names of the top players and officials who have all agreed to support the concept, Speed said that more players and officials would be added to the list before the event commences. 

Rahul Dravid, Virender Sehwag, Kumar Sangakkara, Brian Lara, Brett Lee, Habibul Bashar, Shane Bond, Shaun Pollock, Prosper Utseya, Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore and Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran have agreed to support the cause. 

Incidentally, West Indies great Lara has said in his message that if a player knows he is out, he should walk, to uphold the spirit of the game. 

Team India captain Dravid said: This is a fantastic idea as the spirit of cricket is very important. We must all be aware of the great traditions that we represent when we take the field and perform in front of the public. 

 Lara felt that the profile of the game is on the up. The Ashes and the India-Pakistan series are examples of that. 

You are playing for your team, but you are also playing for your career, so there is lot at stake, he said. 

Meanwhile, closed-circuit TV cameras will form part of the fool-proof security apparatus which would be put in place for the ICC Champions Trophy to be hosted at four centres in the country. 

Security is top priority for the ICC and the BCCI. We are installing CCTVs at all the venues and have also appointed a security consultant. This is a key element in the success of the tournament, Speed said at a media conference on Thursday. 

Speed said that 1.15 million dollars were at stake in prize money.

 Bild: Were crying with you

Berlin: Germany bid an emotional farewell to their soccer team on Wednesday after Juergen Klinsmanns team failed to provide the fairytale ending to a World Cup campaign which has electrified the nation and filled it with pride. 

The dream is over, The night of tears, and Were crying with you, were some of the headlines splashed across front pages after Germanys last-gasp 0-2 defeat against Italy in the World Cup semi-final in Dortmund on Tuesday night. 

Images of tearful players and distraught fans stood alongside a shot of Klinsmann with his face buried in his hands as Germanys once unfancied squad came within minutes of securing a penalty shoot-out for a place in Sundays final. 

This World Cup has changed the emotional state of this country, wrote Berlin tabloid BZ. 

The dream of victory has died, but Germany still won, because we will never forget these days, our pride and the joyful black, red and gold and the carefree spirit of the heroes surrounding Klinsmann, BZ said. 

The Italians were simply better, said mass-selling daily Bild. 

But lads, youre still heroes! Were crying with you.

 Jeev: I need to further strengthen my wrist

 - Top Indian golfer has MRI done 

 Jeev Milkha 

Chandigarh: Indias top golfer Jeev Milkha Singh had an MRI scan on his right wrist on Wednesday which has bothered him for the last few months. 

I got the MRI done in the morning and the reports are still awaited. Recently, I had been feeling that some problem in the wrist was affecting my drive, Jeev said here. 

He said though there was nothing serious and the problem would not stop him from playing, he wanted to assess the exact nature of the damage. 

As I have been playing golf 40 weeks in a year and the wrist takes the load, I guess I have to do more weight training and some physiotherapy also. However, there is nothing to worry about, said Jeev. 

Jeev said that in recent tournaments he had felt a little knack at certain places (in the right wrist) during the swing. 

I need to further strengthen my wrist. My physiotherapists Philipa and Sheela have been advising me from time to time, he said. 

Jeev, however, attributed his rapid rise this year to his focus on process and routine instead of results. 

I played well this year and the main reason for this is that I am now trying to focus on process and routine instead of results, Jeev stated. It is a very fine line between process and result and it has taken a great deal to discipline my mind as earlier I was result-oriented, said Jeev. 

Jeev, who jumped 300 rankings in a year to be 37th in the world right now, said it had been his childhood dream to play at the US Masters. 

As a kid, I dreamt of playing in this tournament. Now, as I would be playing that in April next year, I think I need to control my emotions somewhat, he said. (PTI)

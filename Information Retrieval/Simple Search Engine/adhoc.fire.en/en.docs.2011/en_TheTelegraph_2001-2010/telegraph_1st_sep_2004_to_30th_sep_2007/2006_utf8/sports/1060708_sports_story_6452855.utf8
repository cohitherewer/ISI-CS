 QUICK TAKES

 A 

 case of split loyalty for Lehmann 

 Berlin: Jens Lehmanns 

 loyalty at this World Cup has been strictly with the German 

 national team. Until now. 

The Arsenal goalkeepers ties showed Thursday when he said he hoped Arsenal captain and French striker Thierry Henry would win the Golden Ball award for the World Cups top player. If you have shared a locker room with Henry for three years you would wish him luck because you would realize what a pro he is, Lehmann said. 

 But Lehmann said he would also be cheering for German 

 teammate Miroslav Klose, also shortlisted, and the tournament 

 scoring leader with five goals. I would definitely 

 be happy for Miro. He played a wonderful World Cup, 

 Lehmann said. Its a case of split loyalties 

 and I cant say publicly who I really hope will win.

 Kaisers dilemma 

 Berlin: Italy and France have improved so dramatically during the World Cup, even the most astute judges like Beckenbauer cant split them. 

France was lucky to get out of the group stage by the skin of their teeth and then in the quarter final against Brazil, its difficult to play better, he said. 

 Italy struggled against the US despite having 

 an extra man in the group stage. Against Australia, it was 

 only a penalty that was widely discussed that got them through. 

 But both teams played well in the semi- finals and have 

 arrived in their best form ? it should be fascinating. 

 Matthaeus not interested 

 Berlin: Lothar Matthaeus wont step into Germanys coaching job if Juergen Klinsmann decides to step down. 

Asked if he would be willing to take Klinsmanns place if he decides against staying, Matthaeus said: quot;No, certainly not. quot; 

 quot;I just signed a contract as trainer in Salzburg 

 five weeks ago, quot; he said. quot;I am really happy there. 

 I just hope that Klinsmann makes the right decision for 

 himself and German soccer. quot; 

 United colours for Domenech 

 Berlin: French coach Raymond Domenech doesnt 

 want his teams colours to clash. A man who pays intricate 

 attention to detail, he feels about the outfits Les Bleus 

 wear. Either it is all-blue, the traditional colour of Les 

 Bleus or all-white, their away outfit. I love teams 

 that play in one, united colour. It is symbolic, he 

 said, expressing his dislike for uniforms that have shorts 

 in one colours, jerseys in another and socks in a third. 

 For Sundays final, France will be all-white against 

 the all-blue of Italys Azzurri. 

 Dhorasoos new role 

 Port-of-Spain: Football is making inroads 

 into one of the most traditional bastions of West Indies 

 cricket ? the Hindu community. The Sanatan Dharma 

 Maha Sabha has invited French league footballer 

 of Indian origin, Vikash Dhorasoo, to Trinidad to inspire 

 Hindu youths to play football, a report said here on Friday. 

 Blatter confession 

 Berlin: Sepp Blatter has said he often dived 

 trying to win free-kicks when he played in the top amateur 

 league in his native Switzerland. I was not a perfect 

 player, I have to say, being a striker, Blatter said. 

 I tried to get some advantages by joking with a player 

 and then falling down by saying but he touched me. 

 Security legacy 

 Berlin: International police cooperation on 

 a scale not seen before will be the most important security 

 legacy of a World Cup finals that exceeded even the most 

 optimistic hopes of the German organisers.

 Lagerback decision 

 Stockholm: Sweden coach Lars Lagerback said on Thursday he would step down after the Euro 2008 championships. 

I think neither I nor the federation will want to continue (after 2008), the 57-year-old said. Ive already been involved for nine years and thats unusually long.

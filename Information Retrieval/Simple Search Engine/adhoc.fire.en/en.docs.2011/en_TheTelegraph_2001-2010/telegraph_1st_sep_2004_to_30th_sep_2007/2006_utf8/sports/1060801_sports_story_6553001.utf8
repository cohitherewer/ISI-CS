The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I should have convinced Dravid to declare earlier

 - Wright talks about the decision that left Sachin stranded on 194 in Multan 

 Sachin Tendulkar 

Christchurch: A high-voltage behind-the-scenes drama took place in the Indian dressing room when Rahul Dravid declared in the Multan Test, leaving Sachin Tendulkar only six runs short of a double century, former coach John Wright has revealed. 

Tendulkar, batting on 194 in the first Test against arch-rivals Pakistan, left no one in doubt that he felt let down, Wright says in his recently-published book Indian Summers, disclosing for the first time the tense moments the Indian camp went through, although publicly every effort was made to play down the controversy. 

Acknowledging that the team management had a hot potato on their hands, the former New Zealand captain says he spent a sleepless night. 

Captain Sourav Ganguly, who missed the Test owing to an injury, was worried that the issue would snowball and end up dividing the team. The former Team India coach says no one could be blamed in particular for that situation which could have been avoided had he been able to convince Dravid to declare earlier. 

Midway through the final session, Dravid declared, as you do when you are 675 for five. What Indian captains dont tend to do, however, is declare when Sachin Tendulkar is on 194 not out, Wright wrote in the book. 

The matter became a full-fledged sensation when Tendulkar told a press conference that he was disappointed not to get his double century. 

Wright says had he been the captain, he would have declared a lot earlier, allowing Pakistan to face about 25 overs and with Tendulkar on about 170. 

But the former New Zealand captain also pointed out that Tendulkar needed to move on after tea when things got slow. 

Dravid wanted less time in the field, but got caught a bit betwixt and between. At tea he told the batsmen he wanted 15 or 16 overs at the Pakistanis, and after tea a couple of messages went out. As I sat there watching the innings grind on, it crossed my mind that Tendulkar needed to get a move on, Wright says. 

A final message went out saying they had one more over. Then Yuvraj got run out going for a quick single and Dravid called them in. 

The New Zealander says there was fault all round. I should have convinced Dravid to declare earlier and he should have grasped that its one thing to declare when a batsmans 170 or 180, quite another when hes 194. And Tendulkar should have pushed to get there quicker. 

Once Sachin publicly expressed his disappointment, Wright knew they had a hot potato on their hands. 

I talked to Dravid, who agreed that he had to have a chat with Tendulkar before things got out of hand. That combination of steeliness and serenity, so evident in Dravids batting, is the mark of the man: Nothing fazes him. 

Hes a mature and intelligent individual; all the hype and fuss goes over his head because he can stand back and put the issue in perspective. 

As for Tendulkar, Wright says, he felt let down. Hed been playing for India since he was 16; hed stood up for his country in bad times and tough conditions, and often been the only man to do so. Having given so much for the team, over such a long period, he probably thought this was one time the team could give something back to him. 

Even the greatest have their goals and dreams and milestones, and a double century against Pakistan in Pakistan would have been a memory to treasure. 

After a sleepless night, I spoke to Tendulkar, who confirmed that hed wanted the team to cut him some slack. Then he and Dravid talked it out and resolved the matter.

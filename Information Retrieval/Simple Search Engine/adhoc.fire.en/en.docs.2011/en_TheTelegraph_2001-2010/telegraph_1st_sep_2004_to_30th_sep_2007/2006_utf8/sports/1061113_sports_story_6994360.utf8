The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No ODI at Eden before Cup

 - BCCI says rotation policy followed 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The city will not host any of the eight one-day Internationals against the West Indies and Sri Lanka in January-February. 

The twin home series will serve as a build-up to the World Cup in the Caribbean. 

The Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) contention is that the rotation policy has been strictly followed in deciding on the venues for the ODIs. 

Since Eden Gardens didnt host a game during the recent Champions Trophy, many had expected it to get a match during the next set of internationals. That hasnt materialised. 

The venues against the West Indies are Nagpur, Cuttack, Chennai and Vadodara while Pune, Rajkot, Goa and Visakhapatnam will host the matches against Sri Lanka. 

The venues have been decided strictly by rotation There is no question of Eden Gardens missing out since it was not its turn, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph. 

Nobody in the CAB, neither trustee board member Goutam Das Gupta nor joint secretary Saradindu Pal, could actually confirm that the policy has indeed been strictly follo-wed. 

I have to go through the records and can only let you know tomorrow (Monday) if weve been deprived of a match, Pal said. 

Its strange, of course, that Goa which hosted an ODI against England earlier this year much after the Eden hosted any ODI has again got a game. The last ODI at Eden was against South Africa last November.

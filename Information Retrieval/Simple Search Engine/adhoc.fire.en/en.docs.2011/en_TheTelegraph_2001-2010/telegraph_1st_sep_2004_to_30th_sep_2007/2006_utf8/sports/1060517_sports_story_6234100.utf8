 Akram backs players 

 Pay-hike demand

 Karachi: Former Pakistan 

 captain Wasim Akram Tuesday said Pakistan cricketers deserved 

 a pay hike since it was because of them that money was pouring 

 in from all quarters for the board.

 I have always felt that 

 cricketers deserve more money because of the simple fact 

 that its because of them that the boards kitties 

 are getting heavier and heavier, Akram said from Lahore.

 Pakistan cricketers are set to 

 request the Pakistan Cricket Board to review their central 

 contracts before they embark on a three-and-a-half month 

 tour of England. Their contracts expire on june 30.

 I feel ashamed when I see 

 that Man-of-the-Match getting $500 or Man-of-the-Series 

 being awarded $ 1,500. Its a disgrace because the 

 cricket board signs a sponsorship contract in millions and 

 awards peanuts from that money. Cricketers duly deserve 

 their share, Akram said.

 Germans bidding for home 

 glory 

 With three world titles to their name, Germany are 

 one of the great footballing nations of the world. A German 

 team has played in every World Cup finals, except the 1930 

 and 1950 tournaments, and they boast an outstanding record 

 of success. In 1954, the famous Walters Eleven 

 raised the trophy for the then West Germany for the first 

 time, defeating seemingly invincible Hungary 3-2 in the 

 final in the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland. Fritz 

 Walter, Helmut Rahn and the rest of the team became idols 

 and standard bearers for a whole country. 

Twenty years later Franz Beckenbauer and Gerd Muller led the West Germans to World Cup glory again, this time on home turf. The Kaiser captained the hosts in a riveting final against a brilliant Netherlands side. Johan Neeskens put the Dutch ahead, but Paul Breitner equalised, paving the way for Muller, the greatest German striker of all time, to score the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. It was magical stuff for German supporters and football fans everywhere. 

Germanys third and most recent triumph came in 1990 in Italy after successive defeats in the finals of 1982, when they lost 1-3 to Italy in Spain, and 1986, when Argentina saw them off 2-3 in Mexico. 

Beckenbauer played a key role again, this time as coach to the squad captained by Lothar Matthaeus. In the final, Andreas Brehme converted a penalty against Argentina, giving Germany a 1-0 win and restoring honour after their defeat by the Gauchos four years earlier. An unremarkable decade on the world stage followed before Germany bounced back with a vengeance at the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, battling to the final only to go down 0-2 to Brazil. 

 German hopes rest squarely on the shoulders of Bayern 

 Munich playmaker Michael Ballack, as the national captain 

 seeks to inspire the youngsters around him with his experience 

 and class. Rising stars such as Bastian Schweinsteiger and 

 Lukas Podolski impressed at the Confederations Cup last 

 year. Germany finished third after a narrow 3-2 defeat by 

 Brazil in the semi-finals, boosting hopes of stirring performance 

 at the main event.

 Costa Rica seek to emulate 

 past glories 

 In recent times, Costa Rica have become a regular 

 sight at the worlds top tournaments, and the World 

 Cup in Germany will be no exception. Although their qualification 

 was far from plain sailing, Alexandre Guimaraes side 

 came good in the end and is bidding to upset the established 

 order. 

Not even the Ticos would deny that they made very hard work of the early qualifying rounds. In spite of being overwhelming favourites, they almost came unstuck against first-stage opponents Cuba, only going through on away goals after the pair played out two score draws. The first group phase was a similar story, with only a nervy 0-0 draw in their final game in Honduras putting them through to the final phase. 

Things showed little sign of improving when the six-team final round got under way. A 1-2 home defeat by Mexico, a 0-3 loss away to the US and a goalless draw in Trinidad and Tobago was not the start they had hoped for. The only encouragement came from a 2-1 win over Panama ? and even that came courtesy of a last-minute Roy Myre goal. 

However, the return of Guimaraes, the coach who guided the Ticos to Korea-Japan, in place of Jorge Luis Pinto at the start of April 2005 coincided with an upturn in the teams fortunes. With Guimaraes at the helm, Costa Rica defeated Guatemala (3-2), Panama (3-1), T amp;T (2-1) and the US (3-0) to secure a berth. The only blemishes on the new coachs record were losses to Mexico (2-0) and Guatemala (3-1). Germany will be Costa Ricas third appearance at the World Cup. Both their previous appearances ? Italia 90 and Korea-Japan 02 ? were memorable, with the Central Americans surprising with their uninhibited play and supremely talented individuals. 

 It would be a serious mistake to write off Costa Rica. 

 The current team is every bit as talented as those of previous 

 years and just as determined to cause an upset at the finals. 

 Costa Rica fans around the world will be able to enjoy the 

 fearless defending of Gilberto Martinez, the bravery of 

 Walter Centeno and, of course, the goal-scoring prowess 

 of their biggest star, Paulo Wanchope. The veteran striker, 

 who will be retiring from international football after the 

 finals, is hoping to inspire his side to a performance at 

 least on a par with that of Italy 90.

 Poland

 Poland return to happy 

 hunting ground 

 Even the most die-hard Polish supporters were pleasantly 

 surprised at their teams success in qualifying for 

 Germany in advance of their last group match away to England. 

 The venue of the 2006 finals has been a happy hunting ground 

 for the Poles in the past, as the east Europeans sealed 

 the greatest triumph in their footballing history on German 

 soil with third place at the 1974 finals, a feat they were 

 to repeat at Spain 1982. 

The current team, coached by Pawel Janas lost home and away to England, but won all their remaining eight qualifiers, and are now determined to open a new chapter in their countrys football lore. As keeper Jerzy Dudek declares: We want to make history. 

The time is certainly ripe, as the glories of the past are rapidly fading from the collective memory in Poland. They won gold at the Olympics in Munich before the third-place finish at the 1974 finals again in Germany two years later ? Grzegorz Latos seventh goal of the tournament proving enough to pip the Brazilians to the consolation honour. Poland emulated that achievement with a victory over France at Spain 82. Their team that year was marshalled by world-class midfielder Zbigniew Boniek. 

 There was a 16-year gap before Poland reappeared at 

 the World Cup finals, and their campaign at Korea-Japan 

 02 proved a terrible let-down as their outstanding 

 performances in qualifying crumbled into a first-round exit 

 from the finals. Another bitter pill to swallow came with 

 their failure to reach the Euro 2004 finals, so all eyes 

 are now on the squad preparing for Germany 2006. Coach Janas 

 picks from a parade of established stars and Polands 

 impressive qualifying march will certainly have made their 

 potential finals opponents sit up and take notice. The first-choice 

 strike pairing of Maciej Zurawski and Tomas Frankowski amassed 

 a total of 14 goals in qualifying and will spearhead the 

 latest quest for fresh glories.

 Ecuador

 Affiliated: 1926 

 Ecuador continue on upward 

 curve 

 Ecuador were unquestionably the revelation of the 

 South American qualifiers for the World Cup in Korea and 

 Japan. For a side with a modest football pedigree, their 

 second-placed finish (a point ahead of Brazil) in a fiercely 

 competitive region was a remarkable achievement. Four years 

 on, Luis Suarezs team has done it again, qualifying 

 for their second successive World Cup hot on the heels of 

 Argentina and the Samba Stars. 

Once more, Ecuador sealed their place in the finals with a game to spare, on this occasion with a home draw against Uruguay. However, all did not go to plan on the road to Germany. In July 2004, after seven qualifying games and a disastrous showing at the Copa America in Peru, Hernan Dario Gomez stepped down as national team coach. Having lost the man who had taken them to their first World Cup, Ecuador turned to another Colombian, Suarez, to continue the path laid down by his predecessor. Under Suarez, Ecuador secured qualification thanks in the main to an enviable home record, ending the campaign unbeaten in Quito with a staggering 23 points. 

Ecuadors one previous appearance at the World Cup came four years ago in Korea-Japan. The odds were stacked against them from the outset but they signed off on a high in the first round with Edison Mendezs goal sealing a 1-0 win over Croatia, the third-placed team at France 98. 

 Suarez is fortunate to be able to call on a balanced 

 and tactically aware set of players, including outstanding 

 young performers like Christian Lara, Luis Valencia and 

 Franklin Salas. Ecuadors hopes of success in the summer 

 showpiece rest on these young stars as well as the wise 

 old heads of Ulises de La Cruz, Ivan Hurtado, Mendez and 

 Agustin Delgado. Ecuador will be looking to use the experience 

 of four years ago to take the next step at Germany 2006. 

 On the balance of evidence, they just might do it.

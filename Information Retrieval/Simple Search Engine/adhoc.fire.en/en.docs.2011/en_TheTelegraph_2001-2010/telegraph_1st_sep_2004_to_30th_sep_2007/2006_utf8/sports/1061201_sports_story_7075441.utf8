 Arjun Atwal tied 24th 

La Quinta (US): Arjun Atwal launched his attempt to get full playing rights on the 2007 PGA Tour with a par 72 that put him in tied 24th place after the first round of the PGA Tours qualifying tournament. 

Atwal, who was 140th on the money list and will get a conditional card with 16 starts anyway, is trying for one of the 30 cards that will give him a full card. 

He trails leader Steve Gutschewski by five shots. Gutschewski shot a 5-under 67 in windy conditions to take a one-stroke lead over Jim Gallagher and Ryan Howison. 

Atwal had four birdies and four bogeys in his 72. He started with a bogey on first and had further bogeys on third, ninth and 11th. His four birdies came on second, sixth, tenth and 18th. 

Gutschewski, 167th on the money list this year with $379,488, had six birdies and one bogey on the Jack Nicklaus tournament course.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Madrid: Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas has been sent the wrong way by Barcelona?s Ronaldinho, both off the field and from the penalty spot.

 The two rivals met to shoot a television advert recently and the Brazilian told Casillas he usually fired his penalties to the right of the keeper.

 When a penalty was awarded to Barcelona in Saturday?s top-of-the-table game against Real, Casillas thought he had the measure of Ronaldinho ? who promptly fired into the opposite corner. 

 ?On Saturday I did think about diving the other way to the way he had told me, but I thought if he shoots as he said, I would look like a fool,? Casillas was quoted as saying in a sports daily on Friday.

 London: Two Philippines brothers skipped the inaugural Asian Football Confederation Challenge Cup in Bangladesh this month because they were worried about losing their reserve team places at English champions Chelsea.

 ?If there was a chance I might lose my reserve team place, I wasn?t going to risk it,? said 18-year-old striker Philip Younghusband.

 Midfielder James Younghusband, 19, added: ?Last time, me and my brother played for the Philippines we weren?t really in the (Chelsea reserve) team much ? we found it hard to get back into it.?

 The pair, born in Ashford near London to a Philippine mother and English father were scouted by Chelsea at the age of 10 and their talent has propelled them through the ranks. 

 Doha: Australian rookie Casey Stoner claimed the MotoGP pole on his Honda on Friday for Saturday?s Qatar Grand Prix.

 Stoner, with a time of 1::55.683, pushed Italian Loris Capirossi, winner of the opening race of the season in Spain on his Ducati, into second ahead of Spain?s Toni Elias (Honda) in third.

 World champion Valentino Rossi (Yamaha) was sixth. Rossi finished 14th in the Jerez opener on March 26 when Stoner was sixth.

 Seoul: Beijing?s wish to have the 2008 Olympics torch relay pass through Taiwan has yet to be granted and a final decision will be taken in the coming months, the International Olympic Committee said on Friday.

 China is eager to make a stop in Taiwan, a territory it considers a rebel province. ?The route (of the torch relay) is not yet defined,? IOC president Jacques Rogge said. ?It is still under discussion. We expect a resolution on the discussions in a couple of months.?

 Beijing Games organisers are following in the footsteps of the Athens 2004 Olympics organisers and are planning an international torch relay that is expected to include 28 cities around the world and take in the top of Mount Everest. 

 Berlin: Former athletes who say they were harmed by East Germany?s doping programme vowed on Thursday to take their case to court following a failed attempt to agree compensation.

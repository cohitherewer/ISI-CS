Calcutta: His presence in the match against Tamil Nadu was hailed as Bengals key route to get closer to the Ranji Trophy Elite Group semi-final berth. After three days of insipid and indiscreet performance by his teammates, Sourav Ganguly now stands between Tamil Nadus outright win and a draw for the home team. 

Set against the visitors muscle-flexing on the back of a 497-run target, Bengal finished Day III at 109 for three with Sourav batting on 25 in the company of Avishek Jhunjhunwala (39). No doubt, the final day of the match has thrown Deep Dasgupta and Co. into a typical mend-or-end situation. Barring a miracle, Tamil Nadu are assured of at least two points. 

Since Tuesday the Eden pitch has seen enough dusts of disappointment gathered on it, which clearly called into question the home players competitiveness in and care for attaining anything meaningful from the match. Deep may have taken such things as one of those days when nothing goes in your favour. 

But how can you describe debutant Subhojit Pauls wild drive in the fourth ball of the second innings? How can you justify the logic behind four lives given to Hemang Badani before he took the battle away from the good hosts with an unbeaten 157? How can you make sense out of the front-line bowlers erratic line, with and without the new ball? 

To put it epigrammatically, Bengal have only themselves to blame for aggravating the situation. They have already spoiled a home-bred dish by opting for a green track against Tamil Nadu. The situation demands a different and determined strategy before facing Railways in the final group match, starting from Tuesday and ensuring that the push for a semi-final berth is not rendered a so-close-yet-so-far tale. 

All said and done, you cannot but taking notice of Badani in the match. A first-innings knock of 67 was the just prelude to bigger things to happen. True, he was lucky to survive the second innings undefeated ? he was dropped by Paul on 66 and again on 118, Arindam Das on 94 and Deep on 146. But the confident look of his innings is sure not to escape the national selector V.B. Chandrasekhars eyes. His 372-minute stay at the crease contained 16 fours and the solitary overboundary in the match so far. 

Sridharan Sriram, however, was not so much lucky when he got out four runs short of a deserving hundred, failing to present his bat in the line of a Paul delivery. Much to the agony of the hosts, Badani then played his role in building two sound partnerships ? with K. Vasudevadas (62) for 126 runs and M.R. Srinivas (41 not out) for 112 runs. 

Tamil Nadu declared their second essay at 423 for seven (with a mammoth lead of 497 runs) when tea was called for. Sourav, incidentally, bowled only six overs on Thursday, to return the overall figures of 14-3-32-2. Paul was most successful (three wickets), but most expensive as well (95 runs in 18 overs). 

Just when the situation demanded clairvoyance, Bengal openers were pathetically careless in their approach. The first ball Subhojit (0) actually faced with the bat (he let go the previous three past behind the wickets) was a senseless drive into the hands of Tamil Nadu captain S. Badrinath. Arindam Das (1) then played away from his body to be caught at short leg. 

Sourashish Lahiri made quickfire 39 off 30 balls, which was studded with some beautiful pull shots and nine boundaries, but he failed to drop the anchor when needed. 

In an interesting anecdote, Bengal finished Thursday with a similar look of their first innings on Tuesday. On the opening day, Jesuraj picked up all the wickets when Bengal finished 32 for three with Sourav and Avishek batting at the crease (the hosts eventually were dismissed for 145 the next morning). 

On Thursday, Jesuraj again proved the wrecker-in-chief for Bengal having taken all the wickets on the day and Sourav and Avishek would again resume the innings, this time for saving the match.

 Ivanova banned 

- Russian tests positive 

Moscow: Russian steeplechase champion Lyubov Ivanova has been banned for two years by the Russian Athletics Federation after testing positive for a banned substance. 

Yes, there was such a decision, Federation spokesman Rostislav Orlov said on Sunday. 

Ivanova won the European 3,000m steeplechase title in 2003. 

She tested positive for an unspecified steroid after finishing fourth at the World Athletics final in Stuttgart, Germany, in September. 

Her ban took effect on Friday and must be ratified by the International Association of Athletics Federations, or IAAF. 

At the end of the season, an unbelievable thing happened, Valentin Balakhnichev, president of the federation, was quoted as saying by a news agency. 

Nine Russian athletes had failed tests this season, Balakhnichev said, less than half the total in 2005 when 23 were banned. A total of 1,024 tests were held in athletics meets in Russia this season and the nine athletes were banned for two years. 

We do not need any scandals ahead of the 2008 Olympic Games (in Beijing), Balakhnichev said.

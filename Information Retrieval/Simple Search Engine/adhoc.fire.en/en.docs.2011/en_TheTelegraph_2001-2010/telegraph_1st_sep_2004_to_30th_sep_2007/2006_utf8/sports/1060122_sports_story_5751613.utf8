 Shabbir ban upheld

London: An independent bowling review group (BRG) has upheld Pakistan pace bowler Shabbir Ahmeds 12-month ban from international cricket after a hearing in Dubai. 

We have decided the player had an illegal bowling action and the suspension of the player is to be maintained. This is the unanimous view of the BRG, said the BRG in an International Cricket Council (ICC) statement on Saturday. 

While it is clear a laboratory test can never fully replicate match conditions, the regulations provide for match conditions to be simulated as best as possible. We take the view the laboratory test was carried out as fairly and properly as it should be. 

Shabbir was the first player to receive a 12-month suspension under the revised ICC bowling review regulations after his action was reported twice in 2005. (Reuters)

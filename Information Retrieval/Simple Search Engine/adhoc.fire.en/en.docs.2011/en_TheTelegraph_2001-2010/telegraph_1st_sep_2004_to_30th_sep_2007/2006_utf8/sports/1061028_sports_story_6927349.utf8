 Probe runs into rough weather

Madrid: Spains investigation against a doping ring in cycling has become bogged down in a complex series of legal disputes that could prevent action against those implicated in the scandal, a Spanish daily reported on Friday. 

The probe, known as Operacion Puerto, was launched after raids on addresses in Madrid and Zaragoza in May in which police found large quantities of anabolic steroids, laboratory equipment used for blood transfusions and more than 100 bags of frozen blood. 

The former sporting director of the Liberty Seguros team, Manolo Saiz, doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and the former assistant director of the Comunidad Valenciana team Jose Ignacio Labarta were among those questioned by police. 

Doping itself is not punishable under Spanish law but Fuentes was subsequently accused of offences against public health. 

As a result of the raids, the Civil Guard compiled a list of over 50 professional cyclists who were implicated in the probe, several of whom were prevented from participating in this years Tour de France by their respective teams. 

The paper said the investigation was in danger of running aground because of legal objections raised by several of those implicated in the scandal. 

Saiz has brought a case claiming irregularities in one of the documents, while cyclists from the former Liberty Seguros team have taken another out accusing the Spanish Cycling Federation of revealing protected data and damaging their reputations.

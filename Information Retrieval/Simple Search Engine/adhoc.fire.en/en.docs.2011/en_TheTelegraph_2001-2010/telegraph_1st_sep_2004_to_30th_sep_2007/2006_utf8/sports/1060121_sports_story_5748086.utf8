The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzys the boss... Id say Im his right-hand man, says Woolmer

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 The Pakistan coach takes time out for a candid one-on-one 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Bob Woolmer

Faisalabad: It was as far back as 1968, when nobody in the current Pakistan team was born, that Bob Woolmer began coaching ? at an indoor school he set up himself, in Tunbridge Wells. In more recent years, of course, he has come to be recognised as arguably the most innovative coach in business. The Kanpur-born Woolmer, by the way, also played for England between 1975-81. The other afternoon, he candidly spoke to The Telegraph for almost an hour. 

The following are excerpts 

Q How do you look back on the past year-and-half, the time youve been the Pakistan coach? 

A It would have been easy to turn down the offer, but Im happy I took this job... Ive made friends, have begun to understand the Pakistani culture... In fact, Ive been reading books on Islam... Im definitely more at home (in Lahore) than when I first came. That Im now able to drive in the Pakistani traffic has given confidence. 

So, you were a little... 

(Interrupting) Nervous, yes... 

What were your thoughts when you landed in Pakistan as Javed Miandads successor? 

Frankly, I didnt know what to expect... I came with an open mind as there was no point coming with preconceived ideas... Having come to Pakistan as South Africas coach, I did have an idea about the cricketers, but little else. Of course, I was clear about using the talent available, not abusing it... Using it differently... 

How did you overcome that nervousness? 

By the courage of conviction in my (style of) coaching... I knew certain things work in any environment and certain things can be adjusted... Also, that basic concepts work everywhere. 

Compared to your years with South Africa, what has been the biggest difference in the environment? 

(Smiles) Weather-wise, Pakistan is just too hot in the summers... Its unbearable, while its different in South Africa ? even in the summers, outdoor life isnt discouraged there... Then, generally, South Africa is an open country... Getting a glass of wine, for example, comes easy... Its not so in Pakistan. However... 

I meant the cricket environment... 

The biggest difference is in the facilities... Its fantastic at the National Cricket Academy (Lahore), but theres a need to upgrade a lot of things in many centres across Pakistan... In South Africa, the grounds are much softer and that encourages fielders to dive left, right and centre... In Pakistan, most are like concrete and, so, those graduating to the highest level arent accustomed to diving... Another difference is in the structure... In schools, in universities... Having said that, the Pakistan Cricket Board is looking to improve a good many things. 

What about the players professionalism? 

I didnt find any change in the desire to do well... But, yes, I found much less accent on fitness... They werent unaware of the need to train, but trained in the manner cricketers probably did in the 1930s... Unbelievably, they overloaded the training on the eve of a match. I was horrified to learn that practice sessions before ODIs often stretched to hours... Its far too long to train for anything more than three hours on the eve of a match... You overload in the off-season, never during the season. 

Did you have to push the South Africans? 

No... Hansie Cronje, for example, would run with Zola Budd... They were passionate about training and pushed themselves... 

Frankly, have you had to adjust your style of coaching? 

Yes... The players here are far more sensitive to criticism... Also, Ive been conscious that English humour may not be well received... As you well know, certain words in English can be construed differently... Learning to adapt to a totally new environment is a nice experience. 

Is there something you learnt quickly? 

That most are extremely critical of what you do. Yet, if you become critical, they dont take it well... Perhaps, this is common to countries where the nation is still being built... Pakistan hasnt even completed 59 years... 

How long did it take you to be comfortable in the Pakistan dressing room? 

It did take me time getting used to prayers at tea time... On the other side, it took the players time getting used to being moved up or down the batting order... I found them sensitive to that ? like No. X is for me and not No. Y... Basically, Ive found the players shy... They dont always wish to communicate what theyre doing... At times, Ive found them struggling to open their mind. If their mind was a parachute, they would probably land hard! 

I suppose former manager Haroon Rashids fluency in English must have helped you communicate better and settle down quicker... 

Indeed... And, now, Mushtaq Ahmed is there to help. 

Is it tougher coaching a country which is a lot more passionate about cricket? Isnt the pressure more? 

Pressure... Youve used an interesting word... Why should there be pressure on me? After all, Im coaching somebody else... I dont feel the pressure... The pressure, perhaps, is to provide a winning solution... Im concerned with the process, with encouraging a nice work ethic... I cant understand why cricket is treated as the ultimate in these parts... The tsunami and earthquakes are bigger... When Pakistan beat England, recently, people thanked us for bringing their smile back... After the agony of the October earthquake, they got comforted. 

How long did it take you and Inzamam-ul Haq to strike a rapport? 

Eight months or thereabouts... Its not that we werent civil or nice to each other, but it did take time to understand each other fully... That stage was reached before we toured India last year. 

The bond must have got stronger in India... 

The tour was an important time not only for the team, but our relationship as well... We may not agree on everything, but we sure have enough respect for each other... If Inzy makes a suggestion, I wont straightaway say yes or no... My response usually is let me give it a thought... Similarly, Inzy isnt obliged to react instantly to a proposal from my side. 

Who is the boss? 

(Laughs) We share responsibility, but Inzys the boss... Id say Im his right-hand man! Im his personal assistant... 

What is Inzamams USP as captain? 

His knowledge of the game... Hes not going to lead from the front by sprinting or whatever... His manner is quite different and he will do so by leading with the bat... (After a pause) He enjoys tremendous respect. 

Did he have that respect early on as well? 

It has got enhanced in the past ten months or so... Inzy handles players really well and is open to suggestions. In fact, he even acts on them if he doesnt have an alternative... Everyone grows in life and Inzy has grown as a leader. 

Tactically, does Inzamam need to improve? 

Look, sometimes, even the best plans dont work... No captain gets it right all the time... Where can Inzy get better? Well, all of us can get better at everything... 

Do you agree with Imran Khan that, under pressure, Inzamam delivers more consistently than Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara? 

Under pressure, hes calmer than most and his knowledge helps him understand tough conditions better. 

Has handling Shoaib Akhtar been your biggest challenge? 

Early on, I did question Shoaibs commitment... He didnt like it, but has done something about it... Im not taking credit for his turnaround... Shoaib has done it himself... At best, I rattled the cage... 

Talking of challenges, where do you place this series? 

Its a fresh challenge... I dont rate challenges, though... I understand that Im judged by the results, but my biggest challenge is getting the players in the right frame of mind. 

The last one: What has coaching taught you most? 

Humility... Respect for the game and respect for the players... Also, that technically, theres no real answer to a problem... I may guide the player to a solution, but the actual answer has to be got by the player himself. At the highest level, much of it is self help... A coach gives ideas and sets the thought process ticking... Thats it.

Jamshedpur: A fighting 74 and winning debut as captain notwithstanding, Andrew Strauss doesnt believe he is a lucky charm for England. 

 More than my contribution, credit should go to the bowlers. My captaincy didnt win us the game, it was the bowlers who did the trick, Strauss said after a five-wicket win over India. He was captaining the side instead of Andrew Flintoff, who was given a break. 

It was certainly the quickest wicket so far in the (ODI) series. And the bowlers did a fantastic job and hit the deck nicely. Reducing India to five for 79, I think, was the key to our success here, Strauss remarked in the post-match press conference. 

He felt the conditions at the Keenan were tough and it required a lot of stamina and spirit to survive the task. Any tour of India is always a challenging one. You are to face not only world-class opponents, but hot conditions as well. So once the bowlers left the job to us, we were keen to have a good start. Thankfully, I got a partnership with Ian Bell (who made 46) going and finished it off. The series may be over (India lead 4-1 with the Indore game in hand), but this victory will definitely put us on the right side of our goal, Strauss observed. 

He also pointed out that he would be fine for the final match after suffering cramps here. I was struggling a bit and I am confident I will be ready for the next match. 

The opener, however, was all praise for Mahendra Singh Dhoni. He has showed in the ODI series how versatile a player he is. He batted sensibly and knocked it around, especially considering the fact that wickets were falling at regular intervals.

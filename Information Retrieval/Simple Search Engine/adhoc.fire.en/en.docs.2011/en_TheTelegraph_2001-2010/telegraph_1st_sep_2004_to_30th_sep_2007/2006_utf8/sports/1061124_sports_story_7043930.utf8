London: Inter Milan and Chelsea took their places in the last 16 of the Champions League on Wednesday while Barcelona avoided the ignominy of becoming the first reigning champions to be eliminated in the group phase. 

Inter secured their place in next phase with a 1-0 Group B win over Sporting Lisbon in Milan to ensure they advanced with previously-qualified Bayern Munich who drew 2-2 at Spartak Moscow. The defeat means Sporting are eliminated. 

Hernan Crespo netted Inters winner after 36 minutes. 

Chelsea advanced from Group A despite losing 0-1 at Werder Bremen where Per Mertesacker scored the only goal after 17 minutes. 

Despite the defeat Chelsea remain top of the group with 10 points, the same as Werder and two ahead of Barcelona, who won 2-0 at Levski Sofia. 

Chelsea have a better head-to-head record against Werder and even if they should unexpectedly lose at home to Levski Sofia on December 5, and Barcelona beat Bremen to take top spot, Chelsea cannot finish lower than Bremen so qualify in second place at worst. 

Barcelona were facing elimination if they had lost but goals from Ludovic Giuly and Andres Iniesta ensured they remained in contention. They will go through if they beat Werder in their final match. 

Liverpool secured top spot in Group C with a 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven at Anfield where Steven Gerrard and Peter Crouch scored the goals that brought PSVs 17-match unbeaten run in all competitions to an end. (Reuters)

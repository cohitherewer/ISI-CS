The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rameez pat for Shib Shankar

 - A good experience, says Avishek 

A STAFF REPORTER

 S.S. Paul 

Calcutta: Shib Shankar Paul may not have got much of a chance to impress during the Eurasia meet in Abu Dhabi, but has earned the praise of former Pakistan captain Rameez Raja. 

The mediumpacer took three for 28 in his nine-over spell against Ireland. Rameez told me that I am on the right track and need not worry too much? He also asked me to concentrate on what I am doing, Paul told The Telegraph on arrival in the city on Saturday. 

Paul, however, does not want to comment on not being considered for the final. I dont need to say anything, you all have seen how I performed and then never got a chance, he could not hide his frustration. 

He believes there is a lot in store for him in the near future. India A tour Australia in June. I am quite sure that I am the best bowler in the India A side, and from now on only my performance will speak, he said. 

Another city cricketer, who was in the India A squad along with Paul, also got to play only one match. Avishek Jhunjhunwala made only 12 versus UAE. 

Jhunjhunwala, nevertheless, considered it a good experience. It was an advantage sharing the room with Paul, Jhunjhunwala said. But the young Bengal batsman also felt that exposure in couple of more matches could have scripted a different story. When I came to the wicket, the team needed some quick runs and I lost my wicket in trying to do so, he stated. 

According to Jhunjhunwala, the biggest surprise was his selection on the day of the UAE match. I wasnt aware of my inclusion in the playing XI? It was Robin (Singh) who broke the news to me in the dressing room few hours before the match. That was the most satisfying moment of the trip, he said.

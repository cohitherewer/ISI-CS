 Zaheer bags four wickets

 County Championship

 London: Left-arm seamer 

 Zaheer Khan claimed four wickets to help Worcestershire 

 restrict Glamorgan to 239 in their first innings in a three-day 

 Division II match of the County Championship on Wednesday.

 Zaheer, who accounted for Glamorgan 

 top scorer Mark Cosgrove (61), bowled well to return with 

 the figure of four for 65 in 26 overs, including 10 maidens. 

 His other victims were middle-order batsmen David Hemp (29), 

 Mike Powell (4) and Robert Croft (10).

 In another match, Dinesh Mongia, 

 leading Leicestershire against Somerset, rescued his side 

 after a bad start. Mongia stabilised Leicestershires 

 innings after they lost three wickets for 63. (PTI)

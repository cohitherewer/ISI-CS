 CCI restrict England to 299 

Mumbai: The young attack of CCI Presidents XI proved more than a handful for England as the visitors were restricted to 299 all out on the opening day of their warm-up cricket match at the Brabourne Stadium here on Saturday. 

Middle-order batsman Ian Bell top-scored with 78 while skipper Michael Vaughan (54), opener Andrew Strauss (51) and Paul Collingwood (47 not out) were also among runs on a lively wicket at the Cricket Club of India (CCI) ground. 

Right-arm seamer Kshemal Waingankar, who played for Mumbai under-22 team and was in the Ranji Trophy squad this season, grabbed three for 53 in 15 overs while Rajesh Verma (1/18) and Abid Nabi (1/17) also impressed with their medium pace. 

The Englishmen might have been surprised, or a bit nonplussed, to play on a bouncy track which even sported a tinge of grass but they would have reasons to be disappointed at some of their batsmens dismissals.

 Woods gives up lead

California: Tiger Woods surrendered his overnight lead to a charging Geoff Ogilvy in the third round of the Target World Challenge on Saturday. 

The world number one fired a two-under-par 70 in damp, cool conditions at Sherwood Country Club to slip one shot behind the Australian. 

A stroke in front with three holes to play, Woods bogeyed the par-five 16th before a scrambled par at the last earned him a tie for second place at 10-under 206 with fellow American Chris DiMarco (68). 

US Open champion Ogilvy, boosted by four birdies in the first seven holes, lost the outright lead three times before regaining it with a birdie-three on the final hole for a best-of-the day 67. 

I played good all day, really, Ogilvy said. I started very well, birdied the first two holes, and thats always nice when its tough. 

It didnt look like it was going to be a fun day when we walked out of the locker room this morning and it was cold and raining and the forecast was for it to get worse. 

I hit a couple of bad shots on the way in but on a Saturday you just want to keep yourself in the golf tournament, especially on a day like today. 

Being in the last group on Monday is always where you want to be, added Ogilvy.

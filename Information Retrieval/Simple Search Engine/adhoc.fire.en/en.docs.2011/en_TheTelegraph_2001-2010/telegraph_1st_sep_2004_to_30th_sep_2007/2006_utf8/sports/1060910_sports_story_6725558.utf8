 Anthem faux pas

 Moenchengladbach: The Indian 

 camp has expressed unhappiness over the inaccuracy of the 

 national anthem at the World Cup.

 Coach Baskaran pointed out the 

 error in the instrumental rendition of the national anthem, 

 the last couple of lines of which were repeated just before 

 the start of the game with South Africa on Saturday, to 

 the technical table.

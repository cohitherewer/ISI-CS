The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors may not make trip

 - Team Indias tour of South Africa 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) hasnt yet decided whether the five senior national selectors will, by rotation, make trips to South Africa during the forthcoming ODIs and Tests there. 

In fact, the BCCI could scrap the idea. The selectors, it may be recalled, had been present during the last two big tours to Pakistan (January-February this year) and the West Indies (May-July). 

Im not sure, but the BCCI could ask us to watch domestic cricket... I wont have a problem with that... After all, the focus is then going to be on spotting talent, selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar told The Telegraph. 

The former captain has, very candidly, already declared theres nobody outstanding who merits an immediate call-up. 

Speaking on Sunday, Vengsarkar added: In any case, one is able to watch the ODIs and Tests live on the TV and, in this age and time, communication isnt a problem either... If necessary, the captain and/or coach may be called for anything we wish to know. 

While Bhupinder Singh (Sr), V.B. Chandrasekhar and Ranjib Biswal went for the three Tests in Pakistan, Sanjay Jagdale and the then chairman, Kiran More, were present during the five ODIs there. 

Later, Biswal went as manager for the five ODIs in the West Indies. The four Tests had seen Chandrasekhar and More on duty. Bhupinder was sent to Australia during India As trip there and Jagdale, who also didnt go to the West Indies, got the managership for the (curtailed) tour of Sri Lanka. 

More and Chandrasekhar are, of course, no longer on the committee. Their places have been taken by Vengsarkar and Venkatapathi Muscles Raju. 

Meanwhile, as is the practice, the Sharad Pawar regime has rewarded two more loyalist associations: Vidarbhas Prakash Dixit will be the manager during the ODIs; Goas Chetan Desai in the Tests. 

The five ODIs are to be played between November 19-December 3, while the three Tests are going to be held between December 15-January 6. Theres a Twenty20 fixture, too, in the first half.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fingers crossed over Agarkar

 - Younis Khan may bat at No. 3 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Harbhajan returned home on Tuesday 

Multan: The Indian thinktank is keeping fingers crossed over Ajit Agarkars fitness. The allrounder had to be replaced by super sub Zaheer Khan during Mondays ODI at the Gaddafi. He suffered a sprain in the back after bowling six overs. 

 He woke up this morning feeling pleasantly positive? Apparently, there seems to be no real problem. I dont really know how he will feel until he has bowls at the nets tomorrow, Greg Chappell told The Telegraph. 

Mahendra Singh Dhonis belligerence may have given them a 2-1 lead in Lahore, but the bowling still remains a big worry. It is learnt that the Indians may continue with four pacers. But if Agarkar is ruled out, Ramesh Powar will come into the fray. 

The Multan wicket traditionally favours spinners, and in 2004 when India won by an innings, Anil Kumble finished with six wickets in the second innings. 

This historic city, famous for its many shrines and holy places of great ulemas, sufis and saints, will stay etched in the memory of Indians for Virender Sehwags 309. The infamous declaration, with Sachin Tendulkar stranded on 194, also happened in the same Test. 

Sehwag will surely be missed, along with injured Harbhajan Singh returned home from Lahore on Tuesday, via the Wagah border. 

The Indians are hoping to return victorious this time too, and thereby seal the series. If winning is a habit, as Rahul Dravid believes, then it shouldnt be a problem. 

The fact that the home team is under tremendous pressure after two consecutive defeats, along with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and Shahid Afridi ? who was ruled out following a rib injury ? puts the visitors in good stead. 

Pakistan may try out playing Younis Khan up the order on Thursday. There is a school of thought that his form is being wasted by batting at No. 7. On the other hand, Rana Naved-ul Hasan looks set to be dropped. 

To add to the home sides woes, Match Referee Chris Broad fined the players five per cent of their match fee and Inzamam 10 per cent, as per the laws, for bowling an over short on Monday. 

Both teams visited the state-of-the-art Bakhtawar Amin Memorial Trust Hospital on Tuesday evening with which the Pakistan captain is associated. Situated at Wapda town, nine km from the city, each block has 55000 sq ft area. One of the seven blocks is complete, and will start functioning from March 23. 

 I always wished to do something for my hometown. The peoples wishes have helped me come this far. This hospital is a way of repaying some of my debt, Inzamam said. 

He informed that he will shortly begin organising more funds for the project through dinners and cricket matches. 

Selection for England Test 

Meanwhile, chief selector Kiran More, who is here with the team, has said that the squad for the first Test will be picked in Vadodara on February 23.

 Gul among probables

Karachi: Pakistan pace bowler Umar Gul has been included in a list of probable players announced by selectors on Monday for the Test series against India. 

Gul, who has made five Test appearances, last played for Pakistan in April 2004 against India in Lahore taking five wickets for 31 runs. 

A stress fracture of the back kept Gul out of cricket for more than a year but he returned to domestic cricket last September. 

Gul has been recalled after bowling well in domestic cricket, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Saleem Altaf said. 

The selectors named five other pace bowlers ? Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Sami, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Mohammed Asif and Abdul Razzaq ? for a conditioning camp from January 5 in Lahore in preparation for the Indian series. 

The selectors feel that these are the best possible players available for the coming series and most of them have performed well in the recent series against England, Altaf said. 

Uncapped batsman Rifatullah Mohmand has also been included after scoring a half-century in a warm-up match against England last month. 

Inzamam-ul Haq has been retained as captain after leading his team to a 2-0 Test and 3-2 one-day series win over England earlier this month. 

THE PROBABLES 

Inzamam-ul Haq, Salman Butt, Shoaib Malik, Younis Khan, Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar, Kamran Akmal, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Mohammed Sami, Danish Kaneria, Arshad Khan, Mohammed Asif, Umar Gul, Asim Kamal, Yasir Hameed, Rifatullah Mohmand.

 Miandad dismisses burnout factor 

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Javed Miandad has dismissed concerns about player burnout caused by the increasingly busy international calendar. 

All these complaints about too much cricket nowadays is rubbish. In our days we yearned for more matches, Miandad said on Monday. 

The way I look at it any player can pick and choose the matches he wants to play. It will also create opportunities for others to play at the top level, Miandad said. 

He said the International Cricket Council and member boards needed to ensure there was a proper rest period between matches during a series. 

Its a reality players have to get used to and just try to maintain optimum fitness levels to avoid fatigue and burnout.

Calcutta: Having got the prized scalp of East Bengal the other day, all Sporting Clube de Goa needed to ensure a last-four berth in the IFA Shield was a solitary point. 

Well, the Goan outfit played for a draw against Mahindra United on Saturday and got just that to become the first team into the semi-finals. The result also meant that East Bengal will have to beat Mahindra on Monday to qualify, otherwise the Mumbai team will go through. 

The goalless affair at the Salt Lake Stadium did little to do justice to the stature of two of the countrys top clubs. 

Sporting, who have made a name as a positive and aggressive unit, adopted an ultra-defensive posture. With Mahindra trio K. Ajayan, the young Mohammed Rafi and Yusif Yakubu working in tandem on the left side, Sporting often pushed eight to nine men in their zone to deny Mahindra a breakthrough. 

Dudu Omagbemi had to plough a lone furrow up front, but he got enough attention from the Mahindra defence. 

Yakubus right foot came close to doing serious damage twice. A long ball from Sushanth Mathew saw Yakubu attempt an on-the-run shot but it went a foot wide. Then, the striker chest-trapped a Mahesh Gawli pass and fired one on the turn, only to find Felix DSouza in the way. 

Rafi and Yakubu produced a moments magic with a delectable bout of one-touch passing. It was a pity that the final pass Rafis minus from the goalline went a-begging. 

Mahindra looked purposeful without showing the kind of thrust one expects from them. Of course, they had an excuse in the fact that none of their India players featured in the starting line-up after reaching the city on Saturday. 

It was a good opportunity for coach Derick Pereira to test the bench strength, which didnt look in great shape. Three of the Doha-returned men Steven Dias, N.P. Pradeep and Manjit Singh were introduced in the second half, but none could make a decisive contribution. 

 TEAMS 

Mahindra United: Amit Nandy, K. Ajayan (N.P. Pradeep, 76), Samson Fernandes, Mahesh Gawli, Sushanth Mathew, S. Venkatesh, Mohammed Rafi (Steven Dias, 69), James Singh (Manjit Singh, 88), Filipe Azevedo, Peter Siddiqui, Yusif Yakubu

Cape Town: India had South Africa on the mat but lost the plot completely to suffer an embarrassing 106-run defeat in the third ODI here on Sunday. This follows the Durban debacle on Wednesday when the visitors nosedived to a 157-run loss. 

The hosts were in dire straits at 76 for six, before India allowed them to rally to an imposing 274 for seven, built around Justin Kemps maiden century. 

The visitors then put up a spineless display with the bat to be bundled out for 168 in 41.3 overs and give the South Africans an unassailable 2-0 lead in the five-match series. 

That the supposedly encouraging e-mail from BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah failed to motivate the team was apparent in their performance. 

Indias chase was never on after they were reduced to 44 for four, although skipper Rahul Dravid (63) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (55) led a minor recovery with a counter-attacking fifth-wicket partnership of 85 runs. 

The hosts owed their total to Kemps masterly knock of unbeaten 100 that came from only 89 balls and his match-winning unbroken partnership of 138 runs with Andrew Hall. 

Hall himself came up with an allround performance, hammering a rapid-fire 56 from 47 balls and then chipping in with three for 45. 

The Indian batsmen once again had no answer to the pace and swing of the evergreen Shaun Pollock who ripped the toporder with four for 26. 

The teams square up again in the fourth one-dayer in Port Elizabeth on Wednesday. 

South Africa wriggled out of an almost impossible situation through a record 138-run stand for the eighth wicket between Kemp and Hall which came off only 87 balls and was highlighted by 111 runs they put in the final nine overs. 

Kemps maiden century in his 62nd match arrived in only 89 balls with six fours and seven sixes. Crucially, he took only 22 balls for his second 50. 

Indias batting blues began almost as soon as their innings started rolling, Virender Sehwag slashing one into the hands of third man fielder. 

Sachin Tendulkars wish to deal with short-pitched bowling in a forthright manner met a disastrous end when he mistimed a pull into the hands of square-leg fielder. 

India soon became 44 for four after brief pyrotechnics from Dinesh Karthik (14) who became Makhaya Ntinis first victim. The move to play Karthik as specialist batsman flopped. 

From there on, South Africa took it easy .

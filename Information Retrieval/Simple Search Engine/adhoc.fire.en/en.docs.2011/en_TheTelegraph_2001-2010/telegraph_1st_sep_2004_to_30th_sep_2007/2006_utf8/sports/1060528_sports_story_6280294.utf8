 Sri Lanka fight back 

 - Vandort frustrates England on rain-marred day 

 Geraint Jones makes a futile attempt to stump Tillekeratne Dilshan on Saturday 

Birmingham: Sri Lanka fought back against England on the third day of the second Test at Edgbaston on Saturday when rain allowed just 34 overs. 

After Sri Lanka had slipped to 56 for four in their second innings on Friday, opener Michael Vandort (89 not out) and Tillekeratne Dilshan (59) put on 125 for the fifth wicket. 

Sri Lanka were 194 for five at the close, 40 runs ahead and will be looking for a lead of at least 150 to stand a chance of a shock victory. 

The Lankans salvaged an unlikely draw in the first Test at Lords after following-on. 

Though the players were still going through their warm-ups just half an hour before the scheduled start time on Saturday, a lengthy downpour prevented any play until after tea. 

Dilshan was Englands only success in the day when Matthew Hoggard trapped him leg before four overs from the close. Hoggard returned figures of three for 52 from 18 overs.

Calcutta: The Commonwealth Games medal-winning paddlers ?Soumyadeep Roy, Mouma Das and Shibaji Dutta ? returned to the city on Tuesday morning. 

For Soumyadeep, its a history-scripting performance while Mouma this is on a par with winning a medal in the Asian Games. 

If one pits their show in Melbourne against the prevalent bickering among various ruling bodies of the game in the state, it becomes all the more praiseworthy. 

In fact, Sports Authority of India (Eastern Region) director P.C. Kashyap was present at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport to welcome the heroes, but no officials from Bengal Table Tennis Association were to be seen around. 

Had the girls made the final, I would have been happier, Mouma said upon arriving here. 

Soumyadeep, however, hoped their effort Down Under would have a far-reaching impact on the game in the country. 

This performance by both men and women will help the game get more sponsorships ? in that way, I feel this could be a turning point for table tennis in the country, the former India No. 1, a resident of Biratis Michaelnagar, maintained. 

According to the PSPB pupil, Nigeria were the toughest of the opponents they faced in the just-concluded Games in Melbourne. Even in the individual event, I found the Nigerians tough to deal with. It would have given me more satisfaction, had I won the individual event too, he remarked. 

In the final, Subhajit Saha and Achanta Sharath Kamal played exceptionally well, helping us win the gold, Soumyadeep noted. 

The whole contingent did extremely well, and table tennis performance can be placed next to shooting, Mouma opined. To me, this effort is no less than winning a medal in any Asian Games, she added. 

We will now focus on our preparatory camp for the World Cup starting April 24, Mouma said. The camp will begin in Patiala from April 4. 

Sharath Kamal won the only individual gold while in the mens team event, India bagged gold and on the distaff, Mouma amp; Co. had to be content with bronze. 

Of the other Bengal paddlers, Poulami Ghatak stayed back in New Delhi while Nandita Saha and Subhajit headed straight to their respective residence in Siliguri from the capital.

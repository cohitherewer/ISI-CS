The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We shouldnt take Pakistan lightly

This is the Davis Cup weekend. Sixty nations worldwide will compete for the huge silver bowl donated by Dwight Davis in 1900. Far away places with strange sounding names and players with unpronounceable names will play for their countries in the global embrace of the 2006 Davis Cup. Sportsmanship, honour, patriotism and camaraderie are the fading symbols of the greatest tennis competition in the world. These qualities remain in small measure and are tenaciously sustained by impassioned rhetoric in and after dinner speeches. 

India play Pakistan in Mumbai on from Friday. The matches are being held at the north-east cricket outfield of the Brabourne Stadium where instant grass-courts have been prepared for the tie with experts from Calcutta. For many decades now playing on grass-courts in India have been one of the most potent weapons in our armoury and have contributed to our spectacular success over much higher ranked teams in Davis Cup matches played in India. 

Grasscourts normally favour the less-consistent lower-ranked teams, as with the unpredictable bounce, higher accuracy and consistency levels of higher ranked players are reduced significantly. Whats more is that the top-level players feel very frustrated. 

Considering that our players do not enjoy a significant advantage in class, grasscourt advantage against Pakistan, if any, will be very marginal for India. However, playing at home in India with a supportive crowd will certainly help our boys. 

Records show that India have defeated Pakistan very convincingly five times from 1962 to 1973. On the last occasion in 1973 it was in the semi-final round of the Eastern Zone when the Amritraj brothers swamped them 4-0 and the fifth match was unfinished. 

While searching through Pakistans performance in the Eastern Zone, as it was earlier named, and now the Asia-Oceania Zone Group, I find that Pakistan have quite often, like India, performed better than their rankings. Pakistans victory on grasscourts in Lahore in March 2005 against Thailand was a major upset. 

Aisam Qureshi won both his singles and partnered by Aqeel Khan won the doubles match as well. Thailand were spearheaded by Paradorn Srichaphan, a player who has been in the top ten, and is equally comfortable on grasscourts. With the tie at stake, Qureshi won the crucial fourth match against Srichaphan. This is a top-level performance and brands Qureshi as not only a good player but one who can produce his best when it matters. 

The ability to play well under pressure is the hallmark of a good Davis Cup player. Besides, the 26-year-old Qureshi has eight years of experience in Davis Cup matches and is familiar with Indian conditions having frequently visited India and participated in Futures, Satellite and Challenger tournaments. You could call him the Paes of the Pakistan team. 

Qureshi has the credentials to win both his singles matches. His victory against Bopanna in 2005 will also bolster his confidence. Pakistans Achilles heel seems to be their second singles player, Aqeel Khan. Though he won our National Championships, I feel that both Bopanna and Prakash Amritraj have had sufficient experience and exposure to get the better of him. 

The disturbing news is that Mahesh Bhupathi is having problems with his hamstring. If it persists then he may have to pull out of the doubles. His world ranking in doubles has dropped to 25 and if he plays he may not be at his best. This was one match, even the Pakistanis conceded, was a certainty for India. 

If Bhupathi drops out, then it is most likely that Paes will team up with Prakash Amritraj in the doubles. Any Indian combination with Paes as anchor will be good enough to win the doubles match for India. Playing doubles against Paes is a baffling experience. His great speed and unpredictable interceptions destroy the oppositions rhythm. 

If the tie becomes close, Paes, with his penchant for stepping into the breach, could well nominate himself to play singles on the third day. Though Paes has not played singles for a long time, he is very fit and in great touch. 

His serve is deep and consistent and his return of serve is honed to a sharp edge considering the amount of high class doubles matches he has been playing. But switching to singles after a long lay off, specially when the pressure is explosive on the third day of an undecided Davis Cup match, will provide a formidable challenge to Paes heroics. 

There is a disturbing complacency in the media of an easy victory for India. Though India definitely enjoy an edge over Pakistan, it would be foolish to take the tie lightly. For Amritraj and Bopanna this is the moment of truth. They have to deliver and take the baton from Paes and Bhupathi.

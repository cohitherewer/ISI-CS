 Prasanta pleased with boys efforts

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Gurgaon: The Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee said on Wednesday that even in defeat he has been able to send in the right message to the football community back in his state. Win and defeat are part of the game, said Banerjee. But I have been able to drive in the point that one can achieve a result with unknown boys also. 

As Bengal footballers sat scattered on the bench with their heads down, Banerjee said he felt proud for his boys. No one knew them and gave them a chance. I took the risk and the boys paid me back by taking Bengal to the final for the first time in six years. 

Banerjee thought the luck deserted the team in the final. Tie-breaker is like a lottery. It can go either way. In the regulation period, it was an even battle. We also had our share of chances, but somehow we could not avail it. 

Banerjee and captain Dipendu Biswas defended Suman Dutta for missing the crucial shot in the tie-breaker. He is a confident shooter and has been scoring regularly, said Biswas. Such things happen in the game. You cannot raise finger at anyone for missing a spot kick. 

As Bengal footballers slowly dragged themselves out of the ground after the prize distribution ceremony, celebrations were on at the Punjab bench. The Santosh Trophy has return to the state after 18 years.

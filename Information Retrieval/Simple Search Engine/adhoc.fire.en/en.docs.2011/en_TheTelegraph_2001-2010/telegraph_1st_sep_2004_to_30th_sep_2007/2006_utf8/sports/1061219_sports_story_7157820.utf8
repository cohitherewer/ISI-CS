 Jeev ends the year at No. 37

New Delhi: Jeev Milkha Singh completed one of the biggest jumps in world golf rankings when he ended the year at No. 37 in the charts. 

The UBS Asian Order of Merit winner, who was ranked as low as 376th during this year itself, made an unbelievable leap of 339 places. 

His feat was aided by his four victories this year the Volvo China Open, the season-ending Volvo Masters in Spain, and two triumphs on the highly competitive Japan Tour. 

Jeev managed sixth place in the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok. Jeevs compatriot Jyoti Randhawa, who finished tied 15th in Bangkok is placed 84th, while Shiv Kapur, who won the title last year and finished 36th this time, is at No. 184. 

Gaurav Ghei was 49th at the Volvo Masters and finds himself at 229th place. Arjun Atwal is ranked 260th. 

Tiger Woods leads the rankings, ahead of fellow Americans Jim Furyk and Phil Mickelson. (Pti)

 Atwal misses cut, Chopra tied 30th 

Scottsdale: It was Daniel Chopras turn to go on a birdie spree as he registered a card of six-under 65 to tied 30th after the second round at the FBR Open Golf on the USPGA Tour here on Friday. 

Chopra after being way down with a 73 in first round, was in spectacular form as he fired five in a stretch of six holes on his back nine. 

Arjun Atwal, bogged down by his woes with the putter, went two over 73 and missed the cut, which came at one-under. Atwal, who was tied 27th after a first round 69, missed the cut for the first time this season. 

American J.J. Henry is in the lead with a 14-under 128. He blitzed into birdie spree with a tournament-record of seven successive birdies as he carded a 10-under 61 and opened up a four-shot lead after 36 holes. (PTI)

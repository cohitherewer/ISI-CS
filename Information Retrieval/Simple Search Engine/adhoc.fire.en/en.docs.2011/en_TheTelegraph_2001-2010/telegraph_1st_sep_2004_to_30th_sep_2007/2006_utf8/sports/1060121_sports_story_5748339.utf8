 Hantuchova dumps Serena

 Daniela Hantuchova after beating Serena Williams in Melbourne on Friday 

Melbourne: Champion Serena Williams was dumped out of the Australian Open third round on Friday by Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova. 

Seeded 13th this time, Williams lost 6-1, 7-6 to join her 10th-seeded sister Venus who fell on the opening day. The only time Serena has lost earlier than this at any Grand Slam was in the second round here in 1998. 

I just made a lot of errors today (Friday), the American said. I just couldnt find my shots at all. Everything I was trying just wasnt working. It was just one of those days. 

It means a lot ... finally I can say I am able to play and beat anyone and I am just so happy, Hantuchova said. 

In the fourth round, Hantuchova will meet fourth seed Maria Sharapova who led the Russian charge on a day when scorching temperatures transformed the first Grand Slam of the year into a survival of the fittest. 

Sharapova kept her cool as the mercury soared to 40 degrees Celsius, forcing tournament organisers to invoke the extreme heat rule, but the blazing sun took its toll. 

Top seed Lindsay Davenport and mens second seed Andy Roddick, both playing in the hottest part of the day, survived, while Justine Henin-Hardenne and David Nalbandian won their matches after having the benefit of playing under the closed roof. 

Play was suspended for two hours on the outside courts because of the searing heat, then for a further three hours because of an afternoon thunderstorm. 

Sharapova, playing first on the centre court, beat the worst of the weather by racing to a 6-0, 6-1 win over Croatias Jelena Kostanic. 

I wouldnt say that was really easy, Sharapova said. 

Eighth seed Henin-Hardenne defeated Virginie Razzano of France 6-4, 6-1 while Roddick was also in a hurry to escape the sun, blasting aside Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 to set up a fourth round clash with Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. 

Fourth seed Nalbandian remained on course to play Roddick in the semi-finals after beating Finlands Jarkko Nieminen 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. 

Nalbandians Davis Cup teammate Gaston Gaudio was less fortunate. Scheduled to play the first match on the Vodafone Arena before the roof was shut, he visibly wilted in the heat, losing 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 1-6, 6-4 to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro. 

Sharapova was joined in the fourth round by three fellow Russians, former US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, sixth seed Nadia Petrova and Elena Vesnina. 

A fifth Russian, Maria Kirilenko, lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to Davenport, while a sixth, Anastasia Myskina plays on Saturday. 

Spains Tommy Robredo beat American James Blake for the first time in his career on Friday to snatch the last available spot in the fourth round of the Australian Open. 

Robredos win puts him into the fourth round at Melbourne Park for the first time in six attempts. He will play Argentine fourth seed Nalbandian on Sunday for a place in the quarter finals. 

Seventh seed Ivan Ljubicic extended his good start to the new year with a 7-5, 7-6, 6-0 victory over Spains Feliciano Lopez in the third round on Friday. 

Ljubicic will now meet 2002 Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson in what should be a raucous occasion.

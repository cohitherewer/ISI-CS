The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Madrid: Valencia striker Patrick Kluivert will undergo exploratory surgery on his right knee in the Netherlands, the Primera Liga club said on their website.

 The 29-year-old Dutch international had complained of a pain in his right knee after training last week. The surgery will take place next week.

 Kluivert has been plagued with injury problems since signing from Newcastle United last June. His transfer was held up for three weeks until doctors were satisfied he had recovered from arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.

 Since then he has suffered muscular and joint problems that have restricted him to only one league start and eight substitute appearances for Valencia. 

 Buenos Aires: Former Argentina captain Diego Simeone will hang up his boots later this month and step into the job of coach for his current team Racing Club, according to local radio reports on Monday.

 The midfielder, who represented his national team a record 104 times, had said he would end his playing career in May but changed his plans after Fernando Quiroz resigned as Racing coach on Sunday.

 Fernando Marin, president of the Blanquiceleste group that controls Racing Club, said that Simeone would begin his new role from February 20.

 Frankfurt: Ukraine?s Vladimir Klitschko will fight Chris Byrd for the International Boxing Federation heavyweight title in Mannheim, Germany on April 22, local media reported on Tuesday.

 Klitschko, 29, beat Byrd to win the World Boxing Organisation heavyweight crown in 2000, but relinquished the title after an upset loss to South African Corrie Sanders in 2003.

 He earned the IBF and WBO No. 1 contender ranking with a points win over Samuel Peter in September last year. ?It?s a fantastic feeling, to be able to box again for a world championship,? Klitschko said.

 His elder brother Vitali, a former WBC champion, retired last year because of a knee injury. 

 New Delhi: Indian luge athlete Shiva Keshavan features in the latest edition of a renowned sports magazine as one of six athletes likely to charm spectators at this week?s Winter Olympic Games in Turin.

 The 24-year-old athlete finds a place in the list of athletes who ?will win fans? hearts, if not medals? at the Games which start this Friday, the magazine said.

 The sole Indian entrant at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Olympics, Keshavan had caught the attention of the American media four years ago at the Salt Lake City, even though his exploits barely hogged headlines back home. This time around, Keshavan will be leading a four-member team but remains the country?s best bet for an elusive Winter Olympic medal.

 ?I am in good form and will be aiming at winning the event. Nevertheless, I will be very satisfied with a top 20 position,? Keshavan said.

 Islamabad: Pakistan has postponed a under-18 four-nation women?s hockey tournament after India and Malaysia decided against confirming their participation in the event. The tournament was scheduled to be held at the Hockey Club of Pakistan Stadium in Karachi from February 23-26.

 Kazakhstan was the fourth team scheduled to feature in the meet.

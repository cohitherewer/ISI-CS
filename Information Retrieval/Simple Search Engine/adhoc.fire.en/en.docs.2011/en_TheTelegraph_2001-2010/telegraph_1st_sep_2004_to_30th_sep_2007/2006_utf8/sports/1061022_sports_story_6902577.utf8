 Kapil raps Chappell again

New Delhi: Former India captain Kapil Dev has described coach Greg Chappell as stubborn and an over indulgent experimenter who had left the top players in the team as an insecured lot due to his limited understanding of the culture of the sub-continent. 

Insecurity may work in a culture like Australia where people pick up a box and shift cities next day. Insecurity does not work in a culture like ours, where entire existence is based on our craving for security, Kapil said. 

...But Greg does not seem to understand this culture. He does not understand that (in India) insecurity cant give you solid results. Instead, it shakes peoples confidence. 

Such man is either very stubborn or his level of thinking is so high that it is not understood by ordinary people like us, said the World Cup winning captain, who has also coached the national team. 

Kapil said Sachin Tendulkar was past his prime but not at a stage to announce retirement. Sachin will never bat like we saw him a few years back in Sharjah or Australia... We get very emotional about this... Expect him to perform at the same level. But thats like building castles in the air... We give Sachin respect for what he has already achieved. We expect him to play on until hes 50 years old, he said. (PTI)

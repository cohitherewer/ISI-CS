 Kumble stuck two wkts away from 500 mark 

 - Rain and bad light restrict play to just 14.3 overs on Day II

Chandigarh: As he left the stadium a little after 3.30 pm on Friday, Anil Kumble hardly showed any emotion or anxiety of approaching yet another landmark. 

The familiar calm and reserved countenance was on view as the good luck calls flowed from the motley gathering. There was only a brief smile when a kno- wn face wished him in advance. 

The pragmatic Kumble, though, is not taking things for granted. He is not going to lose sleep over how and when it is going to happen. He knows the moment will arrive in due course of time. 

He only has to keep his focus right and continue bowling with the same dedication and application that has kept him going through these 16 years. 

But everyone surely doesnt wish to think on those lines. The Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) is already drawing up plans to felicitate Kumble. 

The leg-spinner was stranded on 498 wickets when bad light and a steady drizzle, that later turned into a downpour, abandoned the second days action of the second TVS Cup Test. 

The only point of interest that will keep this Test match alive, even as further gloomy conditions are forecast during the remaining days, is whether Kumble can reach the magical 500 mark. Everyone in the PCA ranks is convinced the milestone will be achieved here even if the next two days are washed out. 

No doubt Kumble spurred the expectations during the 67 minutes and 14.3 overs possible on Friday. 

Bowling seven unchanged overs, he removed Paul Collingwood with a leg break that turned across the face of his bat and hit the top of the middle stump. 

Not just Collingwood, Andrew Flintoff, too, found it difficult to combat the variation in line and length during the brief period. Later, Collingwood admitted being bamboozled by that delivery. 

Obviously he is a world class bowler who is in sight of his 500th wicket. He is great and hard to face on any wicket. It was a pretty good ball and I failed to reach it? Maybe Im being critical of myself, but I should have gone further up, he said. 

The Nagpur Test centurion didnt wish to compare Kumble with the other two greats of modern times, Shane Warne and Muttiah Muralidharan. 

 I have faced a lot of Kumble in one-dayers as well. Unless you come up against them in their own backyard, it is difficult to pass any judgement. They are people to contend with. 

They all have their strengths whether they turn the ball massively like Warne and Murali, or have the accuracy like Kumble. 

Collingwood was also candid enough to admit Kumbles importance in the Indian armoury. 

He is one person who bowls a lot of overs. So you have to try and stay patient with him. That is the main thing with him. All the Indian bowlers are difficult and have their strengths, but he is the one who is going to bowl the most overs and the one we have to combat with, he explained. 

The weather has turned more English than Indian and the visitors are already savouring the atmosphere. Overcast conditions and intermittent spells of rain was accompanied by a chill that is unusual at this time of the year. 

Collingwood even spoke of the ball reverse swinging, which he felt was a good sign for us. 

But at 200 for five and with the stand-in captain still at the crease, the most important thing for them was to pile up the runs to put the hosts under pressure. 

The visitors, however, are well aware of the Kumble effect in Indian conditions and how he can turn any match on its head. 

When targets and achievements beckon, he is even more dangerous.

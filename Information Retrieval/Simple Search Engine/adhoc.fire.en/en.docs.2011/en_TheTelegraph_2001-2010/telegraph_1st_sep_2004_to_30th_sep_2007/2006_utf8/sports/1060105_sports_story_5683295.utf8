 Pressure motivates me: Sania

Hong Kong: Indian star Sania Mirza has hit out at the obsession with her religion, saying more attention should be paid to her tennis than her faith. 

The 19-year-old is regarded as a trailblazer for Indian and Muslim women, but she said people should stop confusing her profession and beliefs. 

I think everyone mixes up religion and sport. Im a sportsperson and religion is something very personal, she said. 

Yes, Im a practising Muslim, but I dont understand why only Im asked about my religion. Everyones got a religion out there, I wonder why no one else is asked about it. 

I feel its a very personal thing. Its my personal choice and I dont feel the need to justify it to anyone. 

Sania grabbed the headlines in 2005 when she became the first Indian woman to win a WTA Tour event and soared more than 100 rankings places to finish the year at 34. 

But she attracted criticism from religious conservatives who said she was standing half-naked on the court while playing, which is against Islam. 

Later she created a storm with comments interpreted as condoning pre-marital sex. 

But the Hyderabad native said she had learned not to pay attention to everyones views. 

Obviously Indias a big country. Theres a billion people and a billion opinions, but thats the way it goes, she said. 

My job is to go out there and give 100 per cent every time and let my racquet do the talking. If I start wondering what a billion people are going to say every time I dont think I could really play. 

Ive learned in the past year that everyones going to have their own opinion, but its my choice whether to take it on board. I dont think everyones opinion really matters to me as long as I go out there and do my best, Sania said. 

However, she said she thrived on the enormous expectations generated by her WTA Hyderabad Open win, and by reaching the Australian Open third round and US Open fourth round. 

I think everyone expects me to do all kinds of things, probably things I cant even do, but thats just the part of the package that comes with playing well. You have to take it in your stride, she said. 

In some ways it does motivate me too. I like the pressure, and I think the day I stop liking the pressure will be the day Ill say I dont want to play any more. I like playing when people are expecting things. 

She is also happy to be a role model in India, where her exploits have supplanted cricket on the back pages and where she says tennis is now becoming more popular. 

I love the fact Im being an inspiration to a lot of young girls, especially in India, to come up and play tennis where cricket is the biggest sport in the country, she said. 

People are really starting to playing tennis now, so Im happy and I think its going to help the game a lot. 

Winning start 

Sania celebrated her return to courts by pairing up with US Open champion Kim Clijsters in a thrilling doubles win over the Williams sisters at the Watsons Water Challenge exhibition event in Hong Kong Wednesday. 

Sania and Clijsters defeated Serena and Venus 8-7 (7-2) in a best of 15 match at the Victoria Park Stadium. 

It is a delightful experience to partner a player like Kim, Sania said after the match. (AGENCIES)

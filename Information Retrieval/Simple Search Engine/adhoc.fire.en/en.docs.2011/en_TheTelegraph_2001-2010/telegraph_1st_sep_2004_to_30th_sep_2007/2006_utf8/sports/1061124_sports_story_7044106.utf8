The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Good start by Jeev

Kochi (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh continued his quest for a maiden title in Japan as he shared the lead on the opening day of the $1.19 million Casio World Open Golf meet here. 

Jeev shot a flawless six-under 66 to share the lead with two other Japanese players, Azumo Yano and Tetsuya Haraguchi. The trio was one shot clear of Hideki Kase, who shot a five-under 67. 

I have been striking the ball well and am happy that I have regularly been in contention in Japan, as also elsewhere, said the Indian. (PTI)

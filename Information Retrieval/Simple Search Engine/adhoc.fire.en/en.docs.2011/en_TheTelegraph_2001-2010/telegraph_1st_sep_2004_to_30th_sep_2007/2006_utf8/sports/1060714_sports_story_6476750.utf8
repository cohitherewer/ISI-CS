 Sri Lanka President cancels SLC elections

Colombo: Sri Lankas president Mahinda Rajapakse has ordered that elections to the countrys cricket body be cancelled and asked former players to run the game, the sports minister said on Thursday. 

Rajapakse intervened to end bitter infighting in Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) after a meeting with 11 former cricketers, including World Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga, at his residence on Wednesday. 

Sports minister Jeevan Kumaratunga said that the president had asked him to cancel the SLC elections after the cricketers complained that severe malpractices leading to Saturdays vote were ruining the nations most popular sport. 

The cricketers had a discussion with the president and he advised them to come up with an alternative to the elections, Kumaratunga said. (AFP)

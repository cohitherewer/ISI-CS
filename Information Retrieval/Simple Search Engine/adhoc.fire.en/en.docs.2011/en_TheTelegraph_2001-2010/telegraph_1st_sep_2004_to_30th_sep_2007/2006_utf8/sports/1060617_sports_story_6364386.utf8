The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Former players in contention

 - Professional appointments by BCCI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Two former players, Kashireddi Var Prasad Rao and Stanley Francis Saldanha, have done well in preliminary interviews by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for appointments to soon-to-be-created professional posts. 

Nothing has been finalised, but both are likely to be called for the second round, a well-placed source told The Telegraph on Friday. 

No date, though, has been fixed for Round II of the interviews. 

The preliminary interviews were jointly conducted by the BCCI and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in Mumbai last month. 

The BCCI president, Sharad Pawar, was in the chair for much of the time. Also present were former president Inderjit Singh Bindra, secretary Niranjan Shah, joint-secretary Mohinder Pandove and Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, the executive secretary in-charge. 

The agency had two representatives. 

The TCS shortlisted 40-odd candidates for different posts? Rao and Saldanha were among those interviewed for cricket development manager. They fared well, the source added. 

Rao, who turns 41 in November, captained Bihar before the state got divided (leading to the creation of Jharkhand). His left-arm spin fetched over 200 first-class wickets. 

Saldanha, who is 55, was a right-hand bat who played for Gujarat and Maharashtra. His innings ended in the early 1980s. 

According to the well-placed source, the BCCI has decided to broaden the recruitment drive by inviting applications through its affiliated units. 

The applications, one understands, have been sought for two posts: Media manager and cricket operations manager. 

The BCCI, by the way, has no plans (as of now) to appoint a full-time manager for Team India. The existing ? and very disappointing ? practice of political appointments is set to continue. 

Apparently, a TCS suggestion that the BCCI recruit managers for finance and audit hasnt been accepted as the honorary treasurers post wont be done away with. 

Its to be seen just how professional the cash-rich BCCI actually becomes?

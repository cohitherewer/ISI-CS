 ECB gag on Trescothick

 Ivo Tennant

Marcus Trescothicks countenance was at one with the West Country weather on Tuesday ? slate grey. County cricket press days are customarily jolly affairs, with smiles and bonhomie and handshakes all round after a long winter. 

It is unprecedented for an England cricketer to appear with an ECB minder and not even to exchange pleasantries with reporters, some of whom, down the years, have shared his favourite bangers with him. 

About 25 journalists, at least two of whom are friends of Trescothick, pitched up at Taunton for Somersets press briefing, expecting a chat or an interview, and all were repelled. 

Not by the player, but by Colin Gibson, the ECBs director of communications, heeding the advice of confidants of the England opening batsman, who include Neil Fairbrother, the cricketer turned agent. 

Only photographs were permitted before he was led away to visit two schools in the area. 

Trescothick, indeed, had wanted to talk to old chums: no cricketer enjoys the environment of his County club more than he does. 

Recently he signed an innovative, rolling contract with Somerset that will come into effect when his Test career is over. The concern is that this will be sooner rather than later. 

Absence from his family and tiredness after winning the Ashes has had as much, if not more to do with Trescothicks early departure from the England tour to India as any mysterious virus, although that was not apparent from the transcript of his television interview on Monday.

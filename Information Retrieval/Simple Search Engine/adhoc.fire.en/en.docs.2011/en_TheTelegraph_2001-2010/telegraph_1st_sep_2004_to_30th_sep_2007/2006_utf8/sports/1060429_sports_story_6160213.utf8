 BCCIs scheme set for extension

 Players' pension

 Mumbai: The Indian cricket 

 board is all set to extend its pension scheme for Test and 

 international cricketers to encompass those who have played 

 a minimum of 10 Ranji Trophy games.

 The boards finance committee, 

 which met here on Friday, has recommended that the pension 

 scheme be extended to Ranji Trophy cricketers too and the 

 suggestion would be taken up at the next working committee 

 meeting of the board, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said 

 here.

 All cricketers who have 

 played more than 75 Ranji Trophy ties before 2003-04 season, 

 would get Rs 15,000, those who have played between 50-75 

 matches, would receive Rs 10,000 and those who have played 

 10 matches before the league system was introduced in 1958-59 

 would also get Rs 10,000 per month, Shah said.

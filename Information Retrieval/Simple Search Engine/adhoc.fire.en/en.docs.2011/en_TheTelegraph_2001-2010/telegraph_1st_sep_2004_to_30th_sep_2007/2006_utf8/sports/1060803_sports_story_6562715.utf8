 Harikrishna still ahead of pack

Paks (Hungary): Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna played out another easy draw with Wang Yue of China to maintain his slender half-point lead after the fifth round in the Marx Gyorgy Memorial International Chess Tournament here. 

Signing his second peace pact on the trot in the event, Harikrishna moved to 3.5 points and remained a half-point adrift of nearest rivals defending champion Zoltan Almasi of Hungary and Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine after all matches ended in draw. 

At half way stage of this category-15 double round-robin tournament, the fourth spot was held by Chinese Grandmaster Wang, who was on 2.5 points while Ferenc Berkes of Hungary was next in line on two points. 

Peter Acs of Hungary, who also achieved his second draw in the event with Berkes, was still in the cellar on just one point. 

In the second half of the event commencing after a rest day, Harikrishna will have three white games apart from two as black and the Indian can really look forward to a big victory here. 

The main rival for Harikrishna in rounds to come is likely to be Almasi who won this event last year ahead of Indian stalwart Krishnan Sasikiran. 

Harikrishna had little to do against Wang. Having already scored two victories in the first four games itself, the Indian took it easy and Wang was not really interested in pressing with his white pieces. 

Playing the Nimzo Indian defence as black, Harikrishna faced the Fianchetto system and got the balance ticking soon after the opening. 

The game ended rather abruptly when Wang proposed a draw after just 15 moves and Harikrishna accepted. By this time only a one set of minor pieces and pawns had changed hands and apparently there was a lot to play for, for both sides. 

Like Wang, Efimenko also could not use his white pieces effectively against Almasi who restored his faith in the Berlin defence as black for the second time running in the event after taking a beating at the hands of Harikrishna in the third round. 

Efimenko opted for a different opening plan to tackle the opening and Almasi obviously was better prepared this time. The exchanges took place at regular intervals and the players arrived at a minor pieces endgame in quick time. The game lasted 32 moves.

Calcutta: Sourav Ganguly hailed Anil Kumbles feat of completing 500 wickets in Tests by saying that he (Kumble) is the pride of the nation. We should all be proud of Anil after he has taken 500 Test wickets? Sourav said at a function at DKS on Saturday evening. 

Praising Kumbles efforts as top class, the former India captain said that the Karnataka spinner is the right person to achieve this feat. 

The feat of achieving more than 800 wickets in the international arena proves that he is getting better and better with his age? it is just a commendable job, Sourav said. 

According to Sourav, the leg-spinner has served the Indian cricket for a long period. I congratulate him on this achievement and will send a message shortly.

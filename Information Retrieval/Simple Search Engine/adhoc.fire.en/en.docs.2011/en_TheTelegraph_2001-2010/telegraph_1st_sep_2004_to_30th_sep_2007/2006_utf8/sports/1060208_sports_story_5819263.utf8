The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Shoaib rested because of Cup-driven rotational policy

 - THE decision wasnt brave or bold, says bob woolmer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shoaib Akhtar 

Lahore: The resting of Shoaib Akhtar in the opening ODI on Monday startled many, more so as conditions in Peshawar favoured the new ball bowlers, but Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer remains cool. The hosts, of course, still won ? via the Duckworth/Lewis Method. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from the Marriott in Islamabad, on the morning after, he said: Shoaib was rested because of our 2007 World Cup-driven rotational policy... He has been carrying a left ankle injury, but that wasnt the reason for not playing him... 

According to Woolmer, Shoaib has bowled a lot in recent months and needed a break. Bowlers, in particular, have to rest and recharge batteries... We know what Shoaib is capable of... We want to be sure about the others... In any case, last year, dont forget we won seven ODIs in-a-row without him. 

That sequence began in Jamshedpur, in the second leg of the India tour, and continued in the West Indies. 

When told that the move had actually been bold, given that Shoaib has somewhat of a psychological edge over the Indians, Woolmer replied: No... It wasnt brave or bold... Everybody needs exposure ahead of the World Cup and this series is a continuation of what was set in motion when England toured earlier in the season... 

The decision was, obviously, jointly taken by Woolmer and captain Inzamam-ul Haq. Two of the three selectors ? chief Wasim Bari and Ehteshamuddin ? were present (Iqbal Qasim wasnt around), but the XI is nowadays exclusively decided by the captain and coach. 

[There would be problems when Javed Miandad was the coach... With his removal (mid-2004), the policy changed and we dont interfere once the squad has been picked... Who makes the XI isnt in any way decided by us, is how one of the selectors put it, in an exclusive chat.] 

Woolmer informed that Shoaib took it very well. The XI, it seems, was announced at the team meeting on Sunday evening itself and, so, the spearhead wasnt surprised by his own coach and captain just before the toss. 

Incidentally, Woolmer dismissed a suggestion that Umar Guls Peshawar-roots influenced his selection. Gul played because hes potentially a very fine fast bowler... Unfortunately, he got hit (35 runs in three overs) and we had to replace him with the super sub (another local, Arshad Khan)... We didnt want his confidence dented totally... 

He added: Gul is going to come back, thats for sure... Weve identified the areas he needs to work on... 

Gul, perhaps, wasnt mentally prepared for a home town appearance: On the eve of the ODI, he was seen hosting friends at the hotel (Pearl Continental) and trying to arrange complimentaries for much of the city. 

 Chappell issue 

 Contrary to reports in the Pakistani Media, Team India 

 coach Greg Chappell hasnt been warned by the ICC for 

 questioning Shoaibs action in an interview to a TV 

 channel back home. The controversy erupted in the closing 

 stages of the Karachi Test.

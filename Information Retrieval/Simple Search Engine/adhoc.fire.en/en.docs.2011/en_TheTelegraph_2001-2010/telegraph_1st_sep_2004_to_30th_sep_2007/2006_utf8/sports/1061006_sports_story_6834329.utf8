 Doctrove left out

New Delhi: West Indies umpire Billy Doctrove was omitted on Thursday from the list of officials for the ICC Champions Trophy starting in India on Saturday. 

In a statement on Thursday, the ICC said eight of its 10-man Elite Umpires Panel would stand in the tournament. 

An ICC spokesman said Doctroves absence had nothing to do with The Oval controversy. Dont read anything into Billy Doctroves absence, he said, adding it was easier to rotate eight umpires.

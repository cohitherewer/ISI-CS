 India held by SA

 - World Cup Hockey 

 Action during the India-South Africa match on Saturday 

Moenchengladbach: Bruised and battered with two defeats on the trot, Indias misery in the hockey World Cup was compounded after being held to a 1-1 draw by underdogs South Africa in a pool B encounter here on Saturday. 

The Indians, who desperately needed a big win to stay in contention for a semi-final berth, failed to rise to the occasion with another dismal performance which has now shattered all hopes of a podium finish. 

Dilip Tirkey and his men again squandered a 1-0 lead through Ignace Tirkey (13th minute) by allowing their unfancied opponents to score the equaliser through Ian Symons seven minutes before the hooter at the Warsteiner Hockey Park. 

With two more league matches against strong contenders The Netherlands and South Korea, India seem headed for a bottom placed finish unless they pulled off a remarkable turnaround of fortunes. 

Despite coach Vasudevan Baskarans promise of a better showing, the Indians were a pale shadow of themselves and the failure to earn full points could well mean that the team could struggle to improve upon their 10th finish at the last edition. 

With two defeats behind them, the Indians were looking to record their first victory in pool B, but in their anxiety, nearly made a hash of the game that they were expected to win comfortably. 

South Africa, who had lost 0-2 to the Netherlands, in fact, with a little luck, could even have pulled off an improbable win when Thompton McDade unleashed a shot that goalkeeper Adrian DSouza managed to save with three minutes on the clock. 

Facing opponents ranked four spots below them at No.10, the Indians had the best of opportunities to pick up three points and they looked to be on their way when Ignace Tirkey, left unmarked at the top of the circle drove home following a right-wing move involving Rajpal Singh, Gagan Ajit Singh and Tushar Khandkar. But it was not to be. 

In another match, a 43rd minute goal by Simon Child powered New Zealand to a 1-0 victory against Japan and placed them at the top of pool A with seven points. (PTI)

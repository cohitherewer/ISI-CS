The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indian batsmen have no excuses

 - Stay positive in this defeat and look at it as part of 

 the learning curve

 Line of Fire

 Michael Holding

Its been a long time coming, so I guess being a West Indian, I share the joy of people of my region. Its a series triumph which nobody had foreseen, certainly not by a 4-1 margin. 

It adds to the zing if you remember that in the last nine or 10 matches West Indies have won, Brian Lara has contributed only one half-century. For long, people have held that this team cannot do without Laras hand. Now others too are beginning to make a difference. 

I would not rush to say this team is a world-beater yet, but certainly they have men who can perform more than just one role. There is a growing number of allrounders in the side and senior batsmen are putting up their hands more often. The string of wins are beginning to bring the best out of these guys. 

I have watched this Indian team from close quarters in the last few months and I can sense the disappointment of millions of their fans. There is now a pointed concern if they have gone about preparing for the World Cup in not the most ideal way. 

I personally feel that looking at World Cup at this stage could complicate things. India need to worry about the forthcoming Tests and not lose sleep over a tournament which is still eight months away. 

India need to look at the balance of its Test side, I worry if they have the right blend of youth and experience and whether they could pull it off. It would be a major cause to cherish if Rahul Dravids men emerge victorious in Tests. It still is the booty which is closest to cricketers hearts. 

I can understand if the bowlers find themselves at their wits end in these games because you cannot overnight find an alternative to seam and swing which these conditions do not support. But there is no excuse for the batsmen. These are still slow wickets and they ought to find a way of manouvering the ball rather than attack it all the time. 

This I think has been the most disappointing aspect of the Indian team on this tour. It might be unfair to pick on somebody like Suresh Raina who is young and undeniably talented, but for the second game running, he perished trying to play that stupid shot. 

In that sense, even Harbhajan Singh cannot escape the blame. He had brought India into a situation where if the eighth wicket pair had continued to pick its singles and brought the matter to a head till the final two overs, India would have been deemed favourites. Instead, he tried a mighty loft when a long off fielder was perfectly positioned for such indiscretion. 

Still, I would say that India has missed the experience of someone like VVS Laxman. India needed men who could play long innings and experience is key on such issues. Laxman is the kind of batsman who can work the ball around and consolidate the score without having to take recourse to big, indiscreet hitting. He is like Rahul Dravid in this regard. 

If India want to be positive in this defeat, they can look at it as part of the learning curve. Men with less talent and weak mind can be shattered by setbacks but in Dhonis and Rainas, Sreesanths and Pathans hopefully that is not a worry. (PTI)

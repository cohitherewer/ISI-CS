 Schumacher: It just wasnt meant to be

Sao Paulo: Ferraris Michael Schumacher said farewell to Formula One on Sunday with a stirring drive from last to fourth place (as reported in Mondays Late City edition) against the odds in his final Brazilian Grand Prix. 

The race was rather chaotic, I guess thats the right word for it, he told a German television channel. We had an insanely quick car today. We probably had enough speed to lap everyone, to be honest. We did that sort of anyhow. 

All in all, Id have to say it was a class finale with the car, with the speed weve got. But it just wasnt meant to be today, for me. 

Schumacher started 10th and was fifth when he suffered a puncture as he passed the Renault of Italian Giancarlo Fisichella. He then fought his way from the back of the field with one of the most stirring drives of his 16-year career. 

Asked about the puncture, and whether an impact with Fisichella might have been to blame, Schumacher was unsure. 

I was told that it happened but I couldnt judge it myself because I didnt see it or even really feel anything, he said. I just noticed that at some point my tyre wasnt working any more. 

He leaves Formula One with seven titles, 91 wins and a string of records that may never be beaten. 

Schumacher, 37, said he had no idea how long it would take to get used to the idea of retirement. He did acknowledge that there were regrets and mistakes made in his career. 

There are certainly some of those but it would get too intense to talk about that now, he said. You know the song My Way? Id say that fits the way I feel. 

Schumacher said he would miss the legions of fans who stuck with him throughout. 

What Ill miss are the moments, the good and the bad, that we had in the last 16 years the support the fans gave me that restored my self-confidence at times where things werent going so well. The majority of fans supported me all along. 

That was immensely important for me over such a long sporting career. Id like to say a huge thanks to them all. I know thats not nearly enough to pay that back but Im afraid I cant do more at the moment. 

Sundays race was won by teammate Felipe Massa, the first Brazilian since the late Ayrton Senna in 1993 to win his home race. 

Im really happy for Felipe that he could be the next Brazilian after Senna to win here, said Schumacher, runner-up in the championship to Renaults Spaniard Fernando Alonso. And naturally I congratulate Fernando as well. 

He said did not think about it being his final race. 

 For us it was business as 

 usual. The focus was on trying to win the constructors 

 title. We knew that would require a one-two finish to get 

 us in position for that. But that required us to concentrate 

 100 percent on the issue at hand. There wasnt really 

 much time to think about anything else.

Calcutta: Its testing time for Sourav Ganguly, who has been thrust into an examination by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) ahead of the tour of Pakistan. His home ground ? with a green-top ? looks like a hard tester of ones skill and readiness. 

The next four days of the Bengal-Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match, starting on Tuesday, will surely zoom in on the former team India captain in the middle and dissect how he sizes up the assignment. 

On the eve of the match, Sourav rolled his arm for quite some time at nets at the Eden and then called up Bengal medium pacer Ranadeb Bose to assist him in encountering the bowling machine indoors. The speed rose up from 70mph to 85 and then 95 in no time till the machine suffered a technical snag. Sourav returned to the ground, spent about 15 minutes at the nets and pushed off. 

No meeting with the media; no waiting for the rivals to come to the ground and exchange New Years wishes. Just a gritty and confident face which only suggests how keen he is to pass the examination with a top grade ? the way he always has. 

If Sourav is the focal point of the match, the hosts have also a purpose to serve. Having been denied two points by Gujarat in Surat, Bengal (nine points from five matches) need to consolidate their position in making it to the semi-finals. 

A home match is always an advantage. But our approach to the match is not going to differ from what we have been having throughout the season ? two points will be the first target and, if the situation demands, well go for an outright win, Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta said on Monday. 

He has, however, one more reason to feel happy ? the presence of Sourav. 

Hes a legend and his presence is the biggest thing for us. In the match against Maharashtra, he scored a century (159) and took five wickets. So, theres no denying the fact that hes as handy as anyone in Indian cricket, the Bengal wicketkeeper observed. 

Such a perception also found expression in the rival camps. Sourav is a big plus for Bengal, felt Hemang Badani, while former India wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthick described it as a morale-booster for Deep amp; Co. 

As it stands now, Sourav will bat at No. 5. Hes is going to bat in the middle-order, informed Deep. Subhajit Paul is set to make his debut for Bengal and will open the innings with Arindam Das. 

With the strip wearing a verdant look, Bengal will go out in the middle with a three-pronged pace attack ? Shib Shankar Paul, Ranadeb and Asok Dinda ? let alone Souravs utility as a bowler. This looks like a well-thought out plan, keeping in mind the fact that Tamil Nadu will miss the services of quicks like G. Vignesh, R. Naresh and Lakshmipathy Balaji ? all owing to injury. 

Its a team decision to have a greenish wicket, confirmed Deep. He also indicated that bowling would be his choice if the coin spins in his favour. 

Manoj Tewari, Subhomoy Das, Shib Sagar Singh and Murtaza Lodhgar are the ones likely to miss the cut from Bengals playing XI. 

Tamil Nadu coach B. Arun, however, is not reading too much into the greenish look of the wicket. Frankly speaking, we were expecting such a wicket, but it looks a 50-50 wicket. Well miss Balaji, but the youngsters are capable of shouldering responsibility, he said. 

Having gained five points from as many matches, he, however, refused to think that his team was in search of a survival kit. 

True, our batting is not clicking. But were not certainly in a survival battle. Its just that weve lost two matches and these results shouldnt make us a bad side all of a sudden, Arun pointed out, adding that V. Yo Mahesh, the India under-19 player, has a good chance of debuting for the Tamil Nadu senior team.

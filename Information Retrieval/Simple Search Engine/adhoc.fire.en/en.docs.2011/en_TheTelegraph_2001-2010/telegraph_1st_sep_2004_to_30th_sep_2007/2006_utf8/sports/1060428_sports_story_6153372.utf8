 Owen expected to return tomorrow

London: England striker Michael Owen is expected to line up for Newcastle United for the first time in almost five months when they play Birmingham City on Saturday. 

Owens return from injury is a boost for Englands World Cup hopes with manager Sven-Goran Eriksson due to name his squad next month. 

The 26-year-old broke a metatarsal in a collision with Tottenham Hotspur and England keeperPaul Robinson on December 31. 

Ive been training since Monday and it has been really good, much better than I thought, Owen told the Newcastle website. I was worried that I would have a bit of pain the more I played but it has been great. (Reuters)

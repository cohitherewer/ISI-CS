 Shabbir wont tour England, says ICC

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Monday denied certain media reports that Pakistan fast bowler Shabbir Ahmed would be able to tour England this year. 

ICC general manager-cricket, David Richardson, explained that Shabbirs action could only be reassessed at the end of his one year suspension, which was imposed on the 29-year-old after being reported during the first Test against England in Multan in November last year. 

We have in place a processwhich states that if a player is independently assessed to have been bowling with an illegal action twice in two years, they will be suspended from bowling in international cricket for one year, said Richardson. (AFP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Award a recognition for my sport: Surya

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Surya 

New Delhi: To Surya Sekhar Ganguly, the Arjuna award conferred on him is more of recognition for chess as a sport than a personal landmark. The 23-year-old Grandmaster feels the award is his own little contribution towards the progress of the game. 

The Calcutta-based player, who has completed a hattrick of national championships last year, said he has become used to meeting people who does not keep track of any other sport except cricket. 

I just offer a smile when people still ask my name and the discipline I pursue even in functions related to sports, Surya Sekhar said. It doesnt irritate me any more. The way chess is progressing in India, I am sure it will be a highly popular sport soon. 

Surya Sekhar is currently in the capital to attend the Arjuna award function to be held at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Tuesday. On Monday, along with a host of other Arjuna and Dronacharya award winners, he visited the Nehru Stadium to attend the inauguration of SAIs fitness centre. 

Paddler Soumyadeep Roy, the other Bengal star who was conferred with the Arjuna, is on top of his game right now. Soumyadeep has been in the national team for a long time, but 2006 has certainly been his best year. 

I started hogging the limelight after the Commonwealth Games, said Soumyadeep, who won the team and the doubles titles in Melbourne. The Arjuna award is the culmination of my good showing there.

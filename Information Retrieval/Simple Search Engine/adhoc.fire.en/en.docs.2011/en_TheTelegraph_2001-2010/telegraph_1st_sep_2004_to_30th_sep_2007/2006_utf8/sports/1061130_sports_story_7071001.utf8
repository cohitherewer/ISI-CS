 Ravi Shastri

 I 

 am a right-handed batsman. I often get bowled 

 by pace. Please help.

 (Ravishankar Jha, 19, Guwahati)

 Make sure you watch your backlift. 

 Also try and move a little early, so that you have the extra 

 time on your hands.

 I am a right-handed batsman 

 and often get caught at gully while trying to cut. Please 

 help.

 (Ramesh Desai, 22, Nagpur)

 You are obviously not rolling 

 your wrists when looking to cut, or playing away from the 

 body off the backfoot.

 I am an opener and face 

 problems with the incoming ball. Please help.

 (Rathin Sur, 21, Agartala)

 Dont fall over by getting 

 too far across on your front foot.

 I am a right-handed batsman 

 and often fail in my judgement to step out against the spinners. 

 As a result I get stumped. Please help.

 (Amitava Guha, 19, Calcutta-42)

 Watch the ball closely and step 

 out only if you think if you can get close to the pitch 

 of the ball.

 How can one improve reflexes 

 in close catching?

 (Simon Kumar, 15, Bijni, Assam)

 By practising a lot. Try your 

 hand at other sports as well.

 I am a right-arm mediumpacer. 

 How does one get the seam movement?

 (Ayan Mukherjee, 15, Calcutta-40)

 Check your grip and work on the 

 wrist action with your coach.

 Do you think swing is natural 

 and in-born? Can it be acquired by practice?

 (Suman Chakraborty, 24, Calcutta-16)

 Yes it can be got with practice. 

 There is nothing you cannot get with practice. Its 

 mind over matter.

 How can one improve concentration?

 (Ramesh Chaudhri, 22, Cuttack)

 Endurance training will help. 

 Also, try constantly talking to yourself.

 Would you suggest anything 

 special, besides running and skipping, to improve footwork?

 (S. Jha, Calcutta)

 Running, skipping are very good. 

 The real improvement will come with hours of practice.

 I have done radio commentary. 

 What are the requisites to be a good commentator?

 (R. Shukla, Patna)

 Command over the language, a good 

 voice and vocabulary, and fierce concentration are some 

 of the important requisites for radio. A creative mind will 

 be a big help.

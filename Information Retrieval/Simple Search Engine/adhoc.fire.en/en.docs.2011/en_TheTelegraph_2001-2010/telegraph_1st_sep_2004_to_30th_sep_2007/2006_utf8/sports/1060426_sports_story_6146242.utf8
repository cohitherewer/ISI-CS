The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF yet to finalise 

interview list 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF is yet to finalise the list of five foreign coaches to be called for the interview in the capital next month, but former Chelsea manager Ian Porterfield and Irish coach Brian Kerr could be the front-runners, ahead of French legend Michael Hidalgo, who, too, has applied for the India job. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco said the federation has not yet chosen the five to whom the call letters would be sent in the first week of May. 

Initially we will shortlist 10 coaches, and call five of them to appear for the interview, Colaco said. The interviews will be held for two days on May 24 and 25. 

Asked whether Hidalgo, the most prominent name among the 60 odd applicants, would be among the five, Colaco said he was not certain about it. We would like to have the services of a legend like Hidalgo, but it all depends on the kind of salary he demands. We have written to him about it. At the moment, he is out of France and should be replying to our queries very soon. Only after that we will decide about calling him. 

Dutch coach Hans Westorhof, who has managed teams like PSV Eindhoven, Ajax Amsterdam and the Netherlands U-21 national team, may also figure among the shortlisted 10 as his financial demands were within the AIFFs budget. 

In fact, going strictly by the monetary standards, the Dutchman is perhaps the most affordable among all, Colaco said. 

While Porterfields profile as a coach makes him one of the hot favourites, Kerrs advantage is that he has also specified his expected salary. The Irishman, who made his country the European champions in both the U-16 and U-18 categories, has also made it clear that the salary could be negotiable. 

While 53-year-old Kerr has produced some of the top names like Robbie Keane, Damien Duff and Gary Doherty, Porterfield, 60, has to his credit an FA Cup, when he coached Sheffield United. Other than coaching Chelsea from 1991 to 1993, Porterfield has also coached Bolton Wanderers and the national teams of Zambia, Oman and Trinidad and Tobago. 

Colaco said he has received around 60 applications so far, and was still getting some impressive applications like the one from a Syrian coach, who has been recommended by an independent agent. I will release the list of interviewees on May 5 after writing to technical committee members, he said.

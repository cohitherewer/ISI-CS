St Johns: Wasim Jaffers maiden double century helped India gain a substantial lead and a firm grip over the second Test against the West Indies on Monday. 

Jaffer, playing his 11th Test, became only the third Indian to score a double century in the Caribbean with a marathon 212 as India reached 378 for four in the second innings, 248 runs in front, at tea on the fourth and penultimate day. 

At 2.40 am, India declared their second innings at 521 for six after 150.5 overs, setting the West Indies a target of 392 runs. Mahendra Singh Dhoni made a blistering 69 while Mohammed Kaif remained unbeaten on 46. 

Captain Rahul Dravid played the supporting cast as he ground his way to a 62 while adding 203 runs for the third wicket from 424 deliveries. 

Yuvraj Singh was batting on 14 with Mohammed Kaif yet to open his account at the break. Jaffer batted for eight-and-a-half hours and faced 399 balls during his magnificent knock that contained 24 fours and a six. 

Jaffers previous highest score was 100, scored against England in Nagpur in March. 

Earlier, the West Indies were hard done by a hamstring injury to bowling spearhead Fidel Edwards. The hosts will have to do without his express pace as West Indian coach Bennett King confirmed that Edwards would not be able to take any further part in the match. We will be monitoring the situation but it doesnt seem possible that he would come back, he said. Jaffer and Dravid came together on Sunday afternoon and stayed put for almost a full day. 

Dravid perished, attempting a slog sweep to be caught in the deep off Dave Mohammed. His 62 came from 177 balls with two fours. Perhaps, the captain was in undue haste to give strike to Jaffer who was on 199 then. 

The Mumbai batsman reached the milestone in the same over when he flicked a ball for a single towards mid-wicket. 

Immediately after he reached his double century, Jaffer was claimed to have been caught by Mohammed in his follow through. Umpire Asad Rauf referred it to the third umpire and the television replays conclusively showed that the ball had hit the ground before it went up to the bowler. 

The other two Indians who have scored double century in the Caribbean are Sunil Gavaskar (220) and Navjot Singh Sidhu (201). 

 Jaffer departed just before the tea break when his 

 marathon innings was ended by Ian Bradshaw who managed to 

 sneak one through the gate.

 DAY III HIGHLIGHTS

 Sreesanths figures of 

 16-1-96-0 (R/O 6.00) was the third most expensive bowling 

 analysis by an Indian, bowling at least 15 overs in a Test 

 innings. Former pacer Atul Wassan had figures of 16.4-1-108-4 

 (R/O 6.48) against New Zealand in Auckland, 1989-90, while 

 left-arm spinner Murali Kartiks figures were 19-1-122-0 

 (R/O 6.42) against Australia in Sydney, 2003-04.

 Mahendra Singh Dhonis 

 four dismissals (3 catches plus one stumping) equals Kiran 

 Mores identical effort in Port-of-Spain in 1988-89 

 to become the only second Indian keeper with most 

 dismissals in an innings in the West Indies.

 Indian bowlers were conceding 

 40 or more extras for the 21st time in Tests. This was the 

 second time they have conceded this many extras in the Caribbean. 

 During the 1989 tour, the Indian bowlers conceded 41 extras 

 in Kingston. For the record, the most extras conceded by 

 India against West Indies still remains at 43 in Mumbai, 

 1978-79.

 Indian bowlers have now conceded 

 22 or more no-balls for the third time in 

 Tests. Interestingly all the three occasions came in the 

 West Indies 26 no-balls in Georgetown in 2002 and 

 22 in Bridgetown in 1989.

 Indias deficit of 130 

 runs was the highest it has conceded since the Nagpur Test 

 in October 2004 against Australia, when the lead was 213 

 runs. Since then India have appeared in 19 Tests before 

 this one.

 The first wicket partnership 

 of 72 between Wasim Jaffer and Virender Sehwag was by far 

 Indias best for the opening wicket since the near-record 

 partnership of 410 between Sehwag and Rahul Dravid against 

 Pakistan in Lahore earlier this year. Since then in 11 innings 

 the Indian openers have managed to aggregate just 171 runs 

 at 17.10 runs per innings, with a highest stand of 39.

 Virender Sehwags six 

 during his knock of 41 was 39th of his career, which takes 

 him past the tally of 38 by Navjyot Singh Sidhu. Now among 

 Indians only Kapil Dev (61), Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar 

 (41 each) have hit more sixes than Sehwag in Tests.

 Jaffers unbeaten 113 was 

 the 32nd three-figure score by the 19th Indian batsman in 

 the Caribbean. He also becomes the fifth Indian to register 

 a century at this ground. 

 m Jaffers unbeaten 113 was his second century following 

 his 100 against England in Nagpur in March 2006.

 Barry Richards hits out

Jaipur: Barry Richards on Thursday launched a scathing attack on the BCCI, saying they had transformed the game for commercial interests by their sheer money power. 

The former South African opener said the recent changes in rules was also a result of commercialisation and the BCCI had to be blamed much for it. 

Asked if the ICC should do something to sort out the problems, Richards said: No, not ICC but BCCI because I feel it is BCCI who is running the show in world cricket. It is (BCCI) from where all the money comes from. 

Cricket is now played for money. Only few at the top posts in ICC or BCCI have been involved with high level of cricket. 

Perhaps they have certain other things like power and recognition in their minds rather than cricket. They have to compromise on many issues because of several factors, he said. 

Richards said the time was not far when bowlers would become an extinct species because of money-driven policies of the cricket administrators. 

Batting and fielding is on the rise but I am worried for the bowlers. The game has become too much batsmen-oriented. The fast outfields, field restrictions and flat tracks are all in favour of batsmen, Richards said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Brussels: Standard Liege captain Sergio Conceicao has been banned until August 11 for thrusting his shirt into the referee?s face after being sent off for spitting in a Belgian Cup semi-final match last month. The Belgian football association?s (KBVB) sport committee ruled that the ex-Portuguese international could face a three-year suspension if he re-offends before the end of the year, a KBVB spokesman said.

 Conceicao, 31, was sent off for spitting in the first half of the semi-final first leg tie that Standard lost 2-1 at home to Zulte Waregem on March 21. 

 He then pulled off his shirt and armband and shoved them in the face of the referee before sitting in the stands bare-chested.

 Paris: A Gregory Coupet blunder earned Olympique Marseille a 2-1 win at Olympique Lyon and a place in the French Cup semi-finals on Tuesday. Coupet was at fault in the 65th minute of a tense game when he misjudged a cross and allowed Senegal striker Mamadou Niang to score Marseille?s winner.

 In Tuesday?s first quarter final, a second half goal by Portuguese striker Pedro Pauleta gave PSG a 2-1 win over Lille and a spot in the last four.

 Madrid: Racing Santander have been fined an unspecified sum by the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) after a group of fans subjected Barcelona striker Samuel Eto?o to racist abuse during a league match on Sunday. The RFEF refused to reveal the size of the fine, but Spanish media suggested that it was likely to be in the region of 6,000 euros ($7,294).

 Referee Antonio Rubinos Perez mentioned the abuse in his report on the match at El Sardinero, saying that the Cameroon international had been met with monkey chanting when he touched the ball.

 Milan: The Italian Formula One Grand Prix will go ahead at Monza on September 10 after a vote by the regional government ended fears that the race might be cancelled because of complaints about the noise.

 Local residents had complained about noise levels on race days exceeding the legal limit and obtained a court order in November banning cars without silencers.

 On Wednesday the regional council for Lombardy passed legislation allowing a 30-day exemption from the rules on sound emmissions.

 London: Australian Mark Webber has followed in the slipstream of Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso as winner of Italy?s prestigious Lorenzo Bandini trophy.

 The trophy, awarded annually to an outstanding Formula One driver, is named after the Italian racer who died after crashing his Ferrari in the 1967 Monaco Grand Prix.

 The Williams driver will receive the award in the town of Brisighella, Bandini?s hometown, before next week?s San Marino GP at nearby Imola.

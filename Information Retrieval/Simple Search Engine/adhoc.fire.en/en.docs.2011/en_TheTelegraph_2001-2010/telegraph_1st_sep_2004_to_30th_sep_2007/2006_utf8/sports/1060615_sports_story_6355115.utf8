 Laras fighting 120 denies India 

 victory 

 - Second test vs india 

 West Indies skipper hits 32nd century 

 Brian Lara in action on Wednesday 

 Gros Islet: Brian Lara 

 hit a fighting century to put the West Indies on course 

 to a miraculous draw against India on the fifth and final 

 day of the second Test here on Wednesday.

 The West Indies forced a draw, reaching 291 for seven when 

 stumps were drawn for the final time on Wednesday. Denesh 

 Ramdin was unbeaten on 19 and Jerome Taylor hadnt 

 opened his account. Lara was dismissed for 120, Bravo made 

 47. Kumble took three wickets, Patel two.

 The left-handed batsman was unbeaten on a masterly 110, 

 his 32nd Test century, and had careened his team to 221 

 for four by tea break.

 West Indies started the day on 43 for one in their second 

 innings, trailing the Indians by 330 runs.

 He put on 129 runs for the fourth wicket with Shivnarine 

 Chanderpaul (54) which was the cornerstone of the West Indies 

 resistance.

 Lara had a lucky break on 71 when Yuvraj Singh at forward 

 short leg dropped him off Anil Kumble, who with his niggardly 

 accuracy and precision, posed as ever most questions to 

 the opposition batsmen.

 Kumble bowled tirelessly for much of Wednesday afternoon, 

 as he had done in the morning session, before he tasted 

 success in the form of Chanderpauls wicket.

 Chanderpaul tried to lift him from outside the off-stump 

 but succeeded only in spooning a catch to mid-on fielder 

 Irfan Pathan. He batted for 113 balls and hit six fours. 

 India claimed the second new ball as soon as it was due 

 and strangely asked Virender Sehwag to bowl the first over 

 with it. It clearly was aimed to rile Dwayne Bravo who had 

 fallen victim to Sehwag in both innings of the Antigua Test.

 Lara reached his century when he cut Pathan backward of 

 point for a boundary, having batted for 272 balls and a 

 stretch of 328 minutes.

 The last time Lara crossed a half century in the second 

 innings of a Test was way back in January 2004 when he made 

 86 against South Africa in Johannesburg.

 Earlier, the West Indies survived a torrid first half hour 

 at the start of the day as they lost overnight batsman Daren 

 Ganga (26) and Ramnaresh Sarwan (1) for the addition of 

 two runs.

 Ganga shouldered arm to a Kumble delivery and was bowled 

 off-stump. Sarwan was caught-behind to an excellent delivery 

 from Munaf Patel.

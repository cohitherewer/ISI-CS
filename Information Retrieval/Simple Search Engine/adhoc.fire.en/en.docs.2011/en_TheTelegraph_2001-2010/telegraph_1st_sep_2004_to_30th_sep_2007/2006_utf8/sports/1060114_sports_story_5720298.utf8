 Srinath on Shabbir review panel

Dubai: Pakistan bowler Shabbir Ahmeds appeal challenging his 12-month ban from bowling in international cricket will be heard by the ICCs bowling review group here on January 21. 

The panel comprises chairman Sir Oliver Popplewell, Emirates ICC referee Roshan Mahanama, Jawagal Srinath, ex-international umpire Dick French and Dr Marc Portus, the human movement specialist. 

The panel will consider video evidence from Multan, the match in which the player was reported, the match officials report from that Test match, independent assessment of the players action and any further evidence the player, his representative or the players board may wish to present. 

After all the evidence is heard Popplewell will adjourn to consider its decision and it will reach that decision by a simple majority vote. The decision of the panel will be communicated to the bowler, through the PCB, within 48 hours of the hearing being adjourned. 

The decision of the review group will be final and binding. David Richardson, ICC general manager, cricket, will sit on the panel as an ex-officio member. PCB CEO Salim Altaf will act as the players representative, and Professor Bruce Elliott will make a presentation. 

Shabbir is the first player to be banned from bowling in international cricket for 12 months under the revised ICC bowling review regulations, introduced in March 2005.

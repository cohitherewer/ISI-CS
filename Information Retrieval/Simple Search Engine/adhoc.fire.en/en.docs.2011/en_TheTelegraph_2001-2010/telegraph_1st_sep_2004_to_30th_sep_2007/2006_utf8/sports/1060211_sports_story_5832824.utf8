 India top group 

Colombo: India defeated Sri Lanka by four wickets in their last group C league match in the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Friday. The match was of no academic interest as India have already booked their super-league berth. 

With this win, India topped the group C and will now meet West Indies in the super league stage on Saturday. 

Sri Lanka reached 117 for two at one point after opting to bat first and looked set for a large score before they were pegged back and had to be content with 207. 

When India batted, the hosts reduced them to 28 for three only for Rohit Sharma (78) and super sub Mayank Tehlan (64) to add a match-winning 132 for the fourth wicket and achieve the target with four wickets in hand. 

Medium pacer Yomahesh was the most successful bowler with three for 33

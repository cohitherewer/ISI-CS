 Karan Rastogi in last 8

 ATP Challenger

 Chikmagalur: Karan Rastogi 

 upset fourth seed Lukasz Kubot of Poland 6-4, 6-1 to storm 

 into the quarter finals of the $25,000 Coffee Cup ATP Challenger 

 here on Thursday.

 Rohan Bopanna crashed out of the 

 meet, losing 6-7 (8-10), 4-6 to Japans Toshihide Matsui.

 It was, however, a disappointing 

 day for India in the doubles.

 The pair of Prakash Amritraj and 

 Bopanna lost to Luke Bourgeois (Australia) and Marco Chiudinelli 

 (Switzerland) 4-6, 4-6.

 Ravishankar Athanjali and Vinod 

 Sridhar were eliminated by Yen Hsun Lu (Taipei) and Danai 

 Udomchoke (Thailand) 6-7 (4-7), 6-3.

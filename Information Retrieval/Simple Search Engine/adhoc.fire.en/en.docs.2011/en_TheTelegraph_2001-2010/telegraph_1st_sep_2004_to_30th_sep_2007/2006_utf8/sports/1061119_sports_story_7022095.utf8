The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chappell focusing more on fitness, less on skill

 - Ajit Wadekar, coach on Indias maiden tour of South Africa, looks back and ahead 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL

 Ajit Wadekar 

Former India captain and selection committee chairman Ajit Wadekar was coach (technically, cricket manager) on Indias maiden visit to South Africa 14 years ago. On Friday, he spoke to The Telegraph for around 90 minutes at his well-appointed facing-the-sea Mumbai residence looking back on an unsuccessful trip (both in Tests and ODIs) and ahead. 

The following are excerpts 

Q What were your thoughts when you got appointed for our first tour of South Africa? 

A I felt honoured, but realised it would be a difficult trip It did put me under pressure and, frankly, I was a little worried. Very little, after all, was known of the conditions there except that the ball swung more at Kingsmead (Durban) on days of high tide Also, with so much talk of goodwill, I wasnt sure about the objective. So, I sought an appointment with the then Board president, Madhavrao Scindia, whom I would call bhaiya. 

Did you meet him alone? 

No, I went to New Delhi with (Mohammed) Azharuddin and Sachin (Tendulkar) Kapil Dev also joined us We were briefed about the importance of the tour and I remember telling Scindia that the goodwill bit shouldnt interfere with our aim of winning. That, because of the goodwill, we wouldnt like to lose 

Were you able to do any homework? 

I wanted video recordings, but couldnt get any However, as a number of the South Africans played County cricket, I was aware of the form they were in. 

We first played in Zimbabwe and almost lost the inaugural Test 

Indeed That added to my worries and the Zimbabweans went about tom-tomming that they were the only cricket nation not to have lost a Test! 

From what I remember, the team was more busy with social engagements, in South Africa, than actually focusing on the Tests and ODIs. Why? 

I agree the functions were a distraction, but most had been agreed to even before wed landed. Then, because of the history attached to the trip, it was difficult turning down invitations But, yes, it affected our cricket. 

Why did you allow players to accept personal invitations? 

I did try putting a stop, for I didnt like the idea of one player or a group of players going out and the rest wondering what to do The one who got invited would take along his closest friends and so on That wasnt proper as it encouraged groupism I wanted team spirit If you recall, learning from that experience, I introduced a Code of Conduct immediately after returning home, before the next series (versus Graham Goochs England). 

To speak of the cricket, do you have abiding memories? 

Pravin Amres 103 on Test debut (Durban), Sachins 111 at the Wanderers in Johannesburg, Kapils century (129) in Port Elizabeth and (Jawagal) Srinaths bowling in the Cape Town Test, when he got four wickets in the second innings Anil Kumble had some good spells There were a couple of nice performances in the ODIs, too, but wed been outplayed. 

Did any one South African leave a lasting impression? 

Brian McMillan, the allrounder. He wasnt just useful with bat and ball, but excellent in the slips (After a pause) I was impressed by Hansie Cronje, too I could make out he had a future I remember his father meeting me (possibly in Bloemfontein) and wanting my opinion on Hansie Of course, its difficult forgetting Allan Donalds pace and Jonty Rhodes fielding. 

The South Africans werent very concerned with the goodwill element 

(Laughs) I agree and, by the time we realised they were serious customers, the tour was over. 

There were whispers about differences between you and Kapil. Whats the truth? 

Differences in the sense that Peter Kirsten had the bad habit of taking a start well before the ball had been delivered and I wanted him run out (after being warned) Kapil wasnt in favour and it reached a point, I think, where I told him either he listened to me or one of us would have to go home In the next match (the second ODI, in Port Elizabeth), Kapil did what hed been asked to Kirsten had stopped taking liberties with Manoj Prabhakar and Srinath as theyd warned him Kapil wasnt even doing that. 

[Contacted on his cellphone, Kapil gave a somewhat different picture. I didnt want to effect such a run out as it was against my principles There was a discussion and when the team decided it had to be done, I did so Im surprised Wadekar has said it reached a stage of either you or I Who wouldve had the guts to say I would be packed off?] 

You hit it off with the captain (Azhar), though 

We had a fine relationship and he respected my suggestions In any case, by nature, Azhar is the type to respect elders. If I may add, Im happy that the Board invited him to its recent function at the Wankhede. He has been banned for life (for match-fixing), but how can one player manipulate the result? 

What did you, as coach, learn from that 1992-93 trip? 

That the players werent used to taking the coach seriously Bishan (Singh Bedi) had been in the chair for some months in 1990, but nobody either before or after him Bishan was short-tempered and blunt and would call on his players to jump into the ocean! Obviously, then The players, in my view, needed to be reminded that the coach meant business A change in culture was definitely the need of that season Wed gone to South Africa to win, not only to make friends What ought to have been our primary task, however, got diluted. (After a pause) To an extent, I had to take on the seniors, otherwise the juniors wouldnt get the right message The seniors are the ones whove got to set an example. 

Your comments on the present Indian team 

I wouldve taken three specialist spinners I wouldnt have omitted Ramesh Powar because we have mediumpacers, not genuine quicks I dont visualise a situation where the mediumpacers are going to batter the South Africans into submission I strongly believe we must back our traditional strength spin. Its to be seen whether the wickets continue to be bouncy. The ones in the West Indies have changed and this hype over wickets isnt good. 

How about a prediction? 

Well do well if the batsmen consistently put up big totals The South Africans, I reckon, are favourites in the ODIs As for the Tests, lets first see how competitive we are in the ODIs. 

The critics have been calling it experimentation, while Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell have been terming intra-XI changes as strategy. Whats your take? 

Whatever, the batsmen have been left confused I dont think any batsman is clear about his role and I fear Irfan Pathans confidence has gone Kapil was a far superior allrounder, but I didnt send him at No.3 For a team to move forward, clarity of roles is essential. 

Who should bat at No.3? 

Ideally the best batsman and, today, no one is better than Dravid. (After a pause) Yuvraj Singhs absence is going to be felt in a big way. 

Whats your assessment of Chappell as coach? 

He has tried to bring in the Australian culture His intentions are good, but theres a difference between India and Australia Chappell has probably been handicapped by the lack of a solid bench-strength. If a Matthew Hayden gets injured, two-three quality openers will be there to step in Thats not the case in India. Also, from the outside, my impression is that Chappell is focusing more on fitness and less on skill. It has to be the other way and Im totally opposed to games like kho-kho being part of the warm-up. How many have ever played kno-kho? Its absurd. 

The last question: Isnt it time for Dravid to stamp his authority as captain? 

I agree one hundred per cent The perception, indeed, is that Chappell is calling the shots In some ways, Dravid is like Azhar who wasnt assertive in the early years of his captaincy Azhar, for example, wouldnt like to tick off players, but would instead tell X or Y that A or B hadnt been up to the mark I had to push him into taking the players to task, to stamp his authority The players need to be aware that the captain is going to say something obviously, in the dressing room if they depart from the script. This tour of South Africa isnt just crucial for the team, but for Dravid as captain He must assert himself.

 Aussies stretched after Gilchrist blast

 - First ODI vs Bangladesh 

 - Rafique concedes just 14 in 10 overs 

 MoM Gilchrist on the rampage in Chittagong on Sunday. He smashed 76 off 44 balls 

Chittagong: Adam Gilchrist steered Australia to a four-wicket victory over Bangladesh in the first one-day International on Sunday. 

The opener struck a rapid 76 from 46 balls as Australia made hard work of reaching a moderate target after they had bowled out the hosts for 195. 

The world champions eventually reached their target in 44 overs after Hogg, who reached the 100th ODI-wicket mark, bagged three to bundle Bangladesh out in 47 overs after captain Habibul Bashar won the toss and elected to bat. 

Man-of-the-Match Gilchrist, who smashed five huge sixes, was the first to fall with the score on 96 in only the 11th over, but Australia were pegged back and lost five more wickets. 

We had a few irresponsible shots and cheap dismissals and that made the situation difficult for us, said Gilchrist, who scored his 45th ODI fifty. 

Australia were 174 for six at one stage but Mike Hussey calmed their nerves with an unbeaten 36 from 61 balls, although he did survive a run out chance. 

Bangladesh spinner Abdur Razzak grabbed three for 36 as Pontings men lost four wickets for 36 runs in 12 overs. The hosts got their first wicket when Razzak trapped Gilchrist. 

Katich (18) was next to go, when Bashar easily caught his pull shot at mid-wicket off Mashrafee bin Mortaza. Razzak, a left-arm bowler, also trapped Andrew Symonds for a duck and dismissed captain Ricky Ponting (14) in a similar fashion. 

Michael Clarke (16) ? playing with a head injury ? was run out before last minute replacement Tushar Imran had Hogg (7) caught at mid-on by Syed Rasel. 

Imran replaced allrounder Alok Kapali, who was injured while warming-up just before the start of the match. 

Brett Lee (12 not out), partnered by Hussey (36 not out), hit a boundary to achieve the winning target with six overs remaining. 

Mohammed Rafique failed to take a wicket but became the most economic Bangladeshi bowler ever, with his spell of just 14 runs in 10 overs. 

Bashar scored a solid 52 before being stumped by Gilchrist off Hogg. He hit three boundaries and one six from 93 balls. Hogg also claimed the wickets of Imran (20) and Mortaza (1). (AGENCIES)

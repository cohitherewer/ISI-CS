 Ronaldinho fulfils childhood dream with stunning goal 

 - Brazilian nets a brace in Barcelonas 4-0 win over Villarreal 

 Barcelonas Ronaldinho after scoring one of his goals against Villarreal on Saturday 

Madrid: Barcelona forward Ronaldinho turned on the style as he steered his side to an emphatic 4-0 home win over Villarreal that put them four points clear at the top of the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The Brazilian broke the deadlock in what had been an evenly balanced match when he fired home from the penalty spot 10 minutes before the break and completed the rout with a stunning goal to take his tally for the season to 10. 

The win left the champions top with 29 points from 12 games, four ahead of Sevilla who travel to Athletic Bilbao next and six clear of Real Madrid who will be at Valencia. 

Real Sociedads wretched run of luck continued when defender Ion Ansotegi put the ball into his own net to deny them a first win of the season as they drew 1-1 at Atletico Madrid. 

Striker Gari Uranga gave the basement side the lead midway through the first half when he got in between the Atletico centre-backs to send a glancing header past keeper Leo Franco. 

But just when it looked as though they might hang on for the win Ansotegi chested the ball past his own keeper after winger Luciano Galletti hoisted a ball into the area 13 minutes from time. 

Sociedad remain anchored to the bottom level on five points with Gimnastic, while Atletico stay in fifth spot on 21. 

Barcelona looked far from their fluent best in the opening half hour at the Nou Camp and were given a couple of early scares by Villarreal striker Diego Forlan. 

But they got a crucial breakthrough when Iceland striker Eidur Gudjohnsen manufactured a penalty 10 minutes before the break after he flung himself to the ground when defender Pascal Cygan laid a hand on his arm as he turned into the area. 

Ronaldinho did the rest when he fired the resulting spot-kick low past keeper Mariano Barbosa and into the corner. 

The goal sparked Barcelona into life and it took some fine keeping from Barbosa to deny Deco, Ronaldinho and Giovanni van Bronckhorst before the break. 

Gudjohnsen, though, found a way past the Argentine early in the second half when he nodded in at the far post after Andrea Iniesta floated the ball across the area following a Ronaldinho free-kick. 

The stylish Iniesta made it 3-0 with a spectacular finish when he threw himself at a Gianluca Zambrotta cross to volley the ball into the ground and send it skidding into the net. 

He was outdone, however, by Ronaldinho who put the icing on the cake with his 10th league goal of the season two minutes from time. 

Lurking in the area with his back to goal, the Brazilian controlled a neat pass from Xavi with his chest and then looped a perfectly weighted bicycle kick beyond the reach of Barbosa and high into the net to bring the Nou Camp to its feet. 

Later, Ronaldinho said that he fulfilled a childhood dream by scoring his second goal. 

I didnt really think too much about it because it just happened on the spur of the moment, said the 26-year-old. 

When I controlled the ball it stood up just right and everything else worked out perfectly. Ever since I was a young boy, Ive dreamed of scoring a goal like that. Im never going to forget this goal. Now I have to try for my other dream goal which is to score from the halfway line. 

The Nou Camp gave Ronaldinho a standing ovation after the goal, while coach Frank Rijkaard admitted he had been left gasping in admiration. 

Ronaldinhos second goal was the sort of marvel that provokes strong emotions from Barcelona and all football fans alike, said the Dutchman. This sort of performance will help strengthen the side in matches to come. 

Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes said he had been the victim of similar goals in training. 

Hes scored some like that against me in practice games and its a nightmare, he said. It is no accident. 

In Italy, captain Paolo Maldini relieved the pressure on AC Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti when he headed the winner in a 1-0 home victory over Messina. Milans second win in 10 games gave them 11 points from 13 matches, 19 points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan, who next travel to second-placed Palermo. 

Italian media suggested Ancelottis position was under threat after Milans recent run of results, but Maldini came to the rescue in the 13th minute, nodding in an Andrea Pirlo free-kick. (Reuters)

 Bird flu wont halt Cup: Fifa 

Buenos Aires: The World Cup will not be halted by fears of bird flu in Germany, Fifa vice-president Julio Grondona said on Thursday. 

Everythings been sold, the World Cup cant be suspended, Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Association, told the local radio station Mitre during an interview. 

I was in Zurich last week and I didnt see anywhere that chicken was not being sold or not being eaten. I think its something thats not an issue yet. 

Grondona was asked his opinion after Argentine media reported this week that Germanys economy minister Michael Glos had said an increase in cases of the deadly bird flu disease in the country would not affect its World Cup preparations. 

The 32-nation tournament will be held in Germany between June 9 and July 9. 

The German government was alarmed this week by a spread of bird flu to the mainland from the Baltic island of Ruegen where the first case in Germany were detected. 

Its got to be something of great magnitude at all levels for measures to be taken to suspend a World Cup, Grondona said. (Reuters)

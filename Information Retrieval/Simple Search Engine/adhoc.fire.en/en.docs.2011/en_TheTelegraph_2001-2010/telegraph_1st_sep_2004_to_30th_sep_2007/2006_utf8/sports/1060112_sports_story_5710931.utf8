Sydney: Record-breaking Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne said on Wednesday that he was considering coming out of retirement from international one-day cricket to play next years World Cup. 

Warne said he had not ruled out a surprise comeback in the Caribbean unless it would jeopardise his longevity at Test level, where he has come off a record-breaking year. 

Whatever I want to do in Tests, that will dictate what happens in the World Cup, he told a press conference. 

Warne had announced before the 2003 World Cup that he would be stepping down from the limited-overs game after the tournament to concentrate on Test cricket. 

But he then missed the competition in South Africa ? which Australia won ? after testing positive for a banned diuretic and being handed a 12-month ban. 

It would be nice I suppose to play in the World Cup, but it depends on what I want to do with my Test future, he said. 

At the moment Im retired (from one-day cricket) and I think my Test crickets proven to be as good as its ever been, so if that means I cant play one-day cricket any more and it will extend my Test career, then maybe thats the way it has to stay. But you never say never. (AFP)

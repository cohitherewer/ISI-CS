 Pak hope to exploit Rohan, Prakash inexperience

 Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi 

Karachi: Pakistans tennis ace Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi is hoping to exploit Prakash Amritrajs and Rohan Bopannas inexperience in the forthcoming Davis Cup Asia-Oceania Zone Group I play-off tie to be played in Mumbai between April 7-9. 

We start 0-1 down in the match but I dont think Leander Paes and Muhesh Bhupathi will play in the singles which gives us an opportunity to put the pressure on Prakash and Rohan. 

They are relatively inexperienced at this level although their world ranking is far above ours, Aisam said on the eve of the teams departure for Mumbai. 

Bopanna is world No.232, but has played 10 Davis Cup matches and had lost eight of them. Amritraj has a world ranking of 229 but has won just four of 12 Davis Cup matches so far. 

On the contrary, Aisam has played 45 Davis Cup matches since making his debut in 1998, losing 14 and winning 31, whereas Aqeel Khan has an experience of 42 Davis Cup matches with 18 wins and 24 losses. 

I believe Davis Cup is a different ball game and world rankings dont count. 

India would definitely start as favourites but remember, they will be playing before their crowd and consequently, they will be under more pressure than us, Aisam, who turned 26 on March 17, said. 

The Pakistani player, who has received the highest civil award for his achievements, said he has played with Prakash and Rohan and knew their strength and weaknesses. 

They are my good pals because we have played together all over the world. Therefore, we know each others game better than anyone else. I would try to pass on my experience to Aqeel, he said. 

My experience of India tells me that there are no grass courts in Mumbai and this stadium has just been converted into a tennis court from a cricket stadium. 

Which means the surface and conditions would be as new to the Indians as to us, Qureshi, who played most of his tennis on Indian circuit, said. 

The 26-year-old said he was hoping to spearhead Pakistans campaign. 

I am praying that I get the first match of the competition because that would ease out the pressure on other players. And if I provide Pakistan a winning start, then we will be in an excellent position to clinch the rubber. 

Of course, doubles match is a huge disadvantage to us because we have been winning most of them which looks highly unlikely this time round, Aisam said. 

I am basically a grasscourt player and reply heavily on my serve-and-volley game. Aqeel has also developed his game that suits more on grass. Its all about putting our acts together and to give our best shot. 

The Pakistan player admitted that a lot depended on him and Aqeel with Asim Shafik and Jalil Khan playing second fiddle. 

Myself and Aqeel have been shouldering the pressure for quite sometime now and at times it really becomes difficult when we catch some niggle or injury. But unfortunately, people dont understand this. (PTI)

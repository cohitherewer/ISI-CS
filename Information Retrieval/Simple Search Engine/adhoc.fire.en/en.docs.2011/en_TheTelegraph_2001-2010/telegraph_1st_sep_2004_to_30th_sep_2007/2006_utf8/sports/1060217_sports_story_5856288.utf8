The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prague: Martina Navratilova will return in May to play in the Czech Republic for the first time since the 1986 Fed Cup final. Navratilova told a daily she would play doubles at the Prague Open in May. She is yet to choose a partner but she indicated it could be Czech Kveta Peschke. ?I wanted to play in Prague last year but had agreed to play in Rome which was at the same time,? she said. ?Now it is possible and I certainly prefer to play in Prague than in Berlin, which has a tournament at the same time.?

 Born in Communist-ruled Czechoslovakia, Navratilova emigrated to the United States and took American citizenship in 1981. She last played in Prague in the final of the 1986 Federation Cup when she helped the US team to victory.

 Beijing: Rising Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai, who had previously voiced her desire to break from China?s state sports machine, has agreed to stick with the national team, state media said on Thursday. The controversy surrounding Peng?s bid for tennis independence reached a head at the weekend when the hard-hitting 20-year-old amateur failed to show up for a national training camp. But she did appear at a team meeting in Beijing on Thursday, pledging to stay with the national team and focus on the 2008 Olympics.

 Peng had previously said training conditions on the national squad were holding her back, echoing complaints made last year by veteran teammate Li Na.

 Rome: Juventus striker David Trezeguet risks missing next week?s Champions League last-16 first leg against Werder Bremen after spraining his ankle during training. The 28-year-old limped out of a practice match on Wednesday and is not expected to play any part in Saturday?s trip to Serie A rivals Messina as he tries to regain fitness in time for the trip to Germany.

 Trezeguet is Juventus? most prolific scorer this season with 18 goals in 23 Serie A matches and four in five Champions League appearances.

 Buenos Aires: Boca Juniors can expect little trade from rival fans, especially those of city enemies River Plate, with the new taxis bearing the club?s colours.

 Argentina?s most popular team will not be too worried, though, since they claim to have the support of more than half of the country?s 39.5 million population, according to their fans? ?Half plus one? motto.

 Boca claimed a world first this week when they signed an agreement with a private fleet of radio taxis that will carry the club?s blue and yellow shield on their roofs and doors and whose drivers will wear the team colours.

 Teheran: Iran?s football chief has insisted that no one can block the Islamic republic from competing in the World Cup finals in Germany this summer.

 Mohammdad Dadkin, chairman of Iran?s football federation, made the assertion in response to the West?s stand-off with Iran over its controversial nuclear programme.

 ?Iran?s team will take part in the World Cup with power, and no one can boycott us from this event,? Dadkin was reported as telling Iranian media on Wednesday. 

 Lisbon: Penafiel?s Brazilian striker Roberto Ballesteros has been temporarily suspended after testing positive for the banned stimulant sultanol, the Premier League club said on Tuesday.

 Breakaway threat fades

London: The threat of a breakaway in Formula One seemed to fade on Monday when the teams planning their own series submitted entry forms for the 2008 season. 

The Grand Prix Manufacturers Association ? made up of Renault, BMW Sauber, McLaren Mercedes, Honda and Toyota ? said it was signing up to meet a deadline of March 31 established by FIA and its president Max Mosley. 

The five teams united through the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association... have submitted their entry forms for the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship, GPMA said in a statement. 

However, GPMA spokesman Xander Heijnen was cautious and said some issues still needed to be resolved to avoid the breakaway. 

We have made significant progress with commercial negotiations over the last few months, he said. We hope we can do the same on sporting and technical matters, so that we can achieve our objectives within the current structure. Were moving in the right direction. 

The GPMA had threatened to break away after the 2007 season when the concorde agreement expires. The concorde sets out how revenues are divided among the teams, commercial chief Bernie Ecclestone and the FIA. 

The GPMA has been pushing for increased revenue for the teams and more financial transparency. 

It also wants the power of the FIA limited, with appeals taken to CAS rather than FIAs own court. It has also asked that special veto rules ? granted only to Ferrari ? be rescinded. (AP)

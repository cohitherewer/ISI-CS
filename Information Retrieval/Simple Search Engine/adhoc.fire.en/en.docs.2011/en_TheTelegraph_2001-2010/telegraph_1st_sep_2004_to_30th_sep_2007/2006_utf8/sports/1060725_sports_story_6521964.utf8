 Bush lauds Landis

 US President George W. Bush congratulated American cyclist Floyd Landis (seen above with daughter Ryan in Paris) on Sunday for winning the Tour de France, saying he exhibited amazing strength. Everybodys proud of you. You showed amazing strength and character, Bush said via telephone, a White House spokeswoman said. Bush, an avid mountain biker and sports fan, invited Landis and his family to tour the White House. Landis sealed victory by finishing third in Sundays time trial, extending the American dominance after Lance Armstrong took the title seven consecutive times. (Reuters)

 ICC disputes panel to have final say

Karachi: An International Cricket Councils (ICCs) disputes panel is to have the final say on Englands compensation claim for lost revenue from The Oval Test against Pakistan after both Boards failed to reach an agreement. 

Pakistan forfeited the August match after refusing to take the field to protest ball-tampering allegations, prompting the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to demand 800,000 as compensation. 

On Monday, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said that the ECB had informed his organisation that they were now taking the dispute to the ICC committee.

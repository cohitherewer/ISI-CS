The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fukuoka: Ethiopia?s Kenenisa Bekele completed a historic double by storming to the men?s 12-km title at the World Cross Country Championships on Sunday ? then announced he would not be back.

 The 23-year-old twice IAAF Athlete of the Year became the first man to win both the 4km and 12km titles five years in a row following his triumph in Saturday?s short race.

 Bekele, the Olympic and world 10,000m champion, broke away from his closest rivals with a powerful finish, crossing the line in 35 minutes 40 seconds at Fukuoka?s seaside course. He then declared he would probably not run at another World Cross Country Championships.

 Fellow Ethiopian Sileshi Sihine took silver in 35:43, partly making up for his disappointment in the 4km race, where he took a nasty spill and had to settle for 12th. Kenya?s Martin Irungu Mathathi was third in 35:44.

 New York: Francois-Louis Tremblay of Canada won gold in the 500m race at the World Short Track Championships on Saturday in Minneapolis. Tremblay, who won two silver medals at the Turin Olympics, failed to qualify for the finals of the 1,500m race on Friday but overcame that disappointment to edge Li Haonan of China.

 Tremblay posted a time of 41.439 seconds, edging out Li?s time of 41.639 seconds. Lee Ho-suk of South Korea was third in 41.737 seconds.

 In the women?s 500m, Wang Meng of China won gold in 44.006 seconds ahead of compatriot Fu Tianyu in second in 44.116.

 Canada?s Kalyna Roberge took the bronze medal in 44.116 seconds, just a day after she crashed in the heats of the 1,500m race.

 Rome: Messina?s African defender Mark Zoro has urged Fifa, football?s world governing body, to punish Inter Milan after their fans racially abused him for the second time this season. The 22-year-old Cote D?Ivoire international?s every touch was met with a chorus of monkey chants from a large section of Inter fans during Saturday?s Serie A match at the San Siro.

 The incident comes just three weeks after Fifa outlined a new framework of sanctions for clubs with racist fans. In November, when Messina played at home with Inter, he was reduced to tears after being subjected to racial abuse by the visiting supporters. 

 Beijing: Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson paid respects to one of his greatest heroes by visiting the Mao Zedong memorial hall on Beijing?s Tiananmen Square, the State Press said on Sunday.

 Tyson, on a promotional visit to China, visited the Mao Zedong Memorial Hall on Saturday where the embalmed remains of the leader lie in state. ?I felt really insignificant next to the remains of chairman Mao, this is a great honour to be able to visit the memorial hall,? the paper quoted Tyson as saying.

 Tyson, 39, arrived in Shanghai on Thursday to 

 promote a new nightclub. He was also due to receive an honorary 

 citizenship of the city?s Luo Dian district. But the decision 

 was overturned after local government chiefs took a closer 

 look at his past, the paper said.

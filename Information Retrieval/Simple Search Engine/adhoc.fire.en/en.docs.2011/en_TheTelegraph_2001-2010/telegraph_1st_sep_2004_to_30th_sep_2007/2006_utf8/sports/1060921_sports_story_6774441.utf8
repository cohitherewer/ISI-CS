The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhupathi accepts AITA move

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Fresh from his China Open triumph, Mahesh Bhupathi landed in the city to supervise and ensure smooth sailing of the Sunfeast Open. 

At a press meet on Wednesday, the first obvious question he had to field was how he felt about the Sania Mirza-Leander Paes team-up for the Doha Asian Games. 

Till yesterday (Tuesday), I just knew that I had been excluded and obviously I had not been consulted, said Bhupathi. Today I got a call from Anil Khanna who said it was a decision of the three-member selection committee, who felt that the Sania-Leander team was a better choice. 

I was told that there were three reasons behind the decision: That they had played the last Asian Games together, that they will be playing the Asian Hopman Cup in Hyderabad together and that Leander is in better form than me right now. 

But he is the most successful mixed doubles player in the country. So does it hurt? 

I was obviously considered, since there are only three people in the frame Leander, Sania and myself. I respect the decision, since it is the gold medal that counts. 

How is he preparing for Doha? Well reach Doha three days before the Games begin, and start preparing, answered a deadpan Bhupathi. 

On Globosports latest protg Sunitha Rao, Bhupathi said: Extremely talented She was facing some personal problems. She has hopefully got over the worst. 

Indias Fed Cup line-up of Sania, Shikha Uberoi and Sunitha (once her clearance comes through) is looking stronger than our Davis Cup team and should take us to the World Group pretty soon. 

PTI adds from New Delhi: World No. 8 Mario Ancic, Bhupathis partner in the Chinese conquest, said he would like to play with the Indian even after next weeks Mumbai Open. 

It was unbelievably good winning the doubles with Mahesh. Teaming up with him has been interesting I wish we could play more often, said Ancic, who was in the capital to attend a kids clinic at the DLTA. 

Bhupathi, though, has hinted it may not be practical to play long-term with Croat since his main focus in singles.

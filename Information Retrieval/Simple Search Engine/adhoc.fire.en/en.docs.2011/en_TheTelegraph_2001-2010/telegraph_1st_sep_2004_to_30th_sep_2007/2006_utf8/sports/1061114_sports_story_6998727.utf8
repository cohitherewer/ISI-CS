 Yuvraj will be missed: Dravid 

 Rahul Dravid

Mumbai: Team India captain Rahul Dravid said on Monday that the absence of Yuvraj Singh, who has been ruled out of the South Africa tour because of a knee ligament injury, will be missed but at the same time, it would give an opport- unity to some other player to prove his worth. 

Yuvraj had a great run for the last one and half years, but we cannot do anything about injuries. It will give another youngster an opportunity to put in some good performances. 

We missed Sachin (Tendulkar), Viru (Virender Sehwag) and Harbhajan Singh at some stages. It is always disappointing to lose a key player. 

Youngsters learn from these opportunities and hopefully when Yuvraj is back, we will have a better team, Dravid remarked. 

Coach Greg Chappell too felt Yuvrajs absence was a big blow but hoped some- one else would come out of his shadow and shine like Glenn McGrath did in 1995 on Australias tour of the West Indies. 

Chappell pointed out how McGrath stepped into the shoes of his senior-mate Craig McDermott and did wonderfully well to help Australia win the series and end the West Indies domination. 

Lets hope someone is in the shadow (of Yuvraj) and comes out (to per- form well), the former Australian captain said.

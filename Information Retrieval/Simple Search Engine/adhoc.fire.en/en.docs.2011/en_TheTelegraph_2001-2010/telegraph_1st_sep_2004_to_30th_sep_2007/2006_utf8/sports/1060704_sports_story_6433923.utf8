 CAB letter to BCCI 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal on Monday claimed that the Board of Control for Cricket in Indias (BCCI) finance committee had not taken any decision to stop subsidies and payments and alleged that the stand on withholding the dues was an afterthought smacking of a vindictive plan. 

The truth is that no such decisions were taken by the finance committee (on April 28), Goutam Das Gupta, former Board joint secretary and a member of the finance committee, said in a letter to secretary Niranjan Shah. 

The letter also said the committee had also not taken any decision to debit Rs 40 crore to the CAB for its presidents alleged failure to submit transaction details of the associations account with the Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipur branch. 

While I reserve my right to comment on the ostensible amount of Rs 40 crore, if any, I am at a loss to understand, if at all, such important decisions were taken as early as on April 28, why did it take the BCCI two months to communicate such alleged vital decisions? Das Gupta said in the letter.

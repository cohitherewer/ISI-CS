The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The correct Dravid is stumped

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rahul Dravid

Indore: The very politically correct Rahul Dravid has said he had no idea that among those who welcomed him (at the airport) on Thursday was the BJPs city president Ramesh Mendola. 

Because there are so many people, most of the time I dont even know who is doing the welcoming... To talk of yesterday, I had no idea I was being welcomed (among others) by the person youve spoken about, Dravid told The Telegraph. 

One of the English dailies not only published a photograph of Mendola greeting the Team India captain with a namaste, this morning, but carried an item headlining that warm welcome. 

Its easy to understand why a politician, who hasnt been heard of outside Indore, heads for the airport to welcome somebody he doesnt even know. Phookat ka publicity, after all, is guaranteed. 

Dravid, by the way, is Indore-born.

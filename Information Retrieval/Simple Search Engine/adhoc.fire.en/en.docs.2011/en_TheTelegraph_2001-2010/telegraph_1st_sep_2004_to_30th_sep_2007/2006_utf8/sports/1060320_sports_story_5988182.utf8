Indian Wells: Maria Sharapova obliterated fellow Russian Elena Dementieva to win the Pacific Life Open on Saturday, while James Blake shocked world No.2 Rafael Nadal to set up a mens final against Roger Federer. 

Third seed Sharapova strolled to a 6-1, 6-2 victory to pick up her first title since Birmingham last June. 

Ive worked really hard the past few months to get past my injury and to really believe in myself. Its moments ike these where the hard work comes into your mind, said Sharapova. 

After playing for nearly three hours to upset top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne in the semi-finals on Friday, fourth seed Dementieva couldnt find the energy to run with Sharapova, committing 37 unforced errors to 25. 

Despite the windy conditions, former Wimbledon champion Sharapova did take big rips at the ball when given the right opportunities, cracking 17 winners to only eight from Dementieva. 

You can be playing great tennis the past week, you come out and no matter how good you might have been playing, the level of tennis goes down the drain simply because of the wind, Sharapova said. 

Even though she ended last year ranked No.4, Sharapova was frustrated by a shoulder and rib injury that didnt allow her to play her best late in tournaments.But this year, shes been travelling full time with a physiotherapist and has worked diligently on improving her upper body strength. 

It was very frustrating because tournament after a tournament, Id be working hard, Id be trying to get back in shape, and all of a sudden my injury would bring me down again, said Sharapova, who has won 11 of the 13 finals shes contested. 

Meanwhile in the mens event, Blake shocked Nadal of Spain 7-5, 6-3 on Saturday to earn himself a place in the final against Roger Federer. 

Blake, winner in Las Vegas two weeks ago, negated the 19-year-old Spaniards speed and retrieving ability with huge forehands, opportunistic net rushes and superb returning. 

I felt great, Rafael is an unbelievable player. Somehow he brings out the best in me because I played some of my best tennis against him at the US Open, said Blake, who ousted the Spaniard in the third round at Flushing Meadows. 

I knew hes the type of guy that you have to kind of jump on that first chance. You cant wait for two and three and four opportunities in a point. If you let him get on the offensive. 

Blake broke Nadal three times during the match and nailed 21 winners to 17 from the Spaniard. 

 He played good and aggressive, 

 Nadal said. In difficult moments, he always had the 

 confidence to win the point, how to play the point well. 

 I fought all match.

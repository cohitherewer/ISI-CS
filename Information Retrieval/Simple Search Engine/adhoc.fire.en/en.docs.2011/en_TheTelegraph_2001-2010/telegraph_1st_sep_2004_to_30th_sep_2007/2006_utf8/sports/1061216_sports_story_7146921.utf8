 Curators strategy delays play

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Johannesburg: Wanderers curator Chris Scott tried to be different and ended up with egg on his face. His strategy of laying a wet hessian cover beneath the main one on Thursday, a day prior to the start of the three-Test series, backfired in the worst possible manner. 

The sweating was much more and it led to damp spots, delaying the start by as much as 90 minutes. Apparently, hed done that to help bind the wicket so that the cracks wouldnt be a factor. 

Whoever gave Scott that idea, the delay served as a poor advertisement for Test cricket. Imagine something like this happening back home... The curator wouldve been hanged, a former India captain told The Telegraph. 

In past India versus South Africa face-offs in South Africa, there have been instances of floodlights going off during a one-dayer and the sightscreen holding up play for what seemed an eternity, but what happened here took the dubious-cake.

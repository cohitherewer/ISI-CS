 A surprise to be in semis, says Nadal

London: Spaniard Rafael Nadal came to Wimbledon as second seed after a 60-match winning rampage on clay. Nobody really imagined the 20-year-old topspin powerhouse would stick around too long on grass. 

Its a surprise to be in the semi-finals, he said. Its an unbelievable tournament for me. Im gonna try my best for the next match, its very important for me. 

Nadal said every part of his grass game had improved since he arrived last week. I am playing with more confidence, especially with my serve, he said. 

Baghdatis said he was struggling to come to terms with being thrust suddenly into the spotlight after reaching the final of the Australian Open. 

I had some doubts in the middle of the year, some small injuries, but now Im getting confident again, feeling the ball good, playing good tennis, said Baghdatis. 

Justine Henin-Hardenne and Amelie Mauresmo cleared the last treacherous hurdles on Thursday en route to a Wimbledon title showpiece that will have the tennis purists drooling. 

Five years after her first Wimbledon final ended in defeat by Venus Williams on the day that she mourned the death of her grandfather, the 24-year-old has the chance to complete her collection of all four Grand Slam titles. 

Its been five years and that was someone I love so much and I was very close to him, so I will have a lot of motivation on Saturday, said the French-speaking Belgian after continuing her Grand Slam domination of Clijsters. 

It was so tight in the second set, I was just thinking about getting to the final finally at the fourth attempt, world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo said after setting up a final date with Henin-Hardenne.

 Shevchenko threat to Italy hopes

Duisburg: World Cup debutants Ukraine go into Fridays quarter final against Italy knowing that whatever the result they have already made their mark. 

Although they have surpassed their goal of reaching the knockout stage, they do not want to stop there and have their sights set on creating an upset against the fancied Italians. 

We are not afraid of playing Italy, we will play freely. We are going to aim for victory, coach Oleg Blokhin said late on Wednesday. 

Italy are more under pressure because they are the favourites in our game and we have already achieved what we wanted to. We have already made history. 

Striker Andriy Shevchenko is the main threat to Italys hopes of reaching the semi-finals but at least they know all about him. 

Shevchenko, playing in Ukraines first finals, was the darling of AC Milan fans during seven seasons in which he scored 173 goals and helped them win the Champions League and Serie A. But he will not be thinking about that on Friday. 

It will be very hard but during the game I will only be thinking about how best to play for Ukraine, he said. 

His decision last month to become Chelseas record signing robbed the Italian league of one of its top players and former Milan teammate Alessandro Nesta knows exactly how good he is. 

There are few players like him in the world, said the Italy defender who misses the quarter final with a groin injury. To stop Shevchenko you have to be at 100 percent because he has very few weak points. You have to stick with him and be attentive for the whole 90 minutes, he added. 

Shevchenko was equally complimentary about Italy. I would single out the whole team, he said when asked who were Italys strongest players. 

Nestas absence and the suspension of natural replacement Marco Materazzi leaves Italy coach Marcello Lippi with no option but to field the relatively inexperienced Andrea Barzagli alongside Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of defence. 

Nesta, who hopes to return if Italy make the semi-finals, was confident Barzagli would be able to handle the challenge. 

He is a young player but he has the advantage of being very cool under pressure and also a very strong lad, he said. 

Lippi has laughed off the claim that his team has enjoyed a slice of good luck at the World Cup. 

Id like to say something about all this talk that we have been lucky. We had Totti ruled out for three months with injury, then Zambrotta, Gattuso and Nesta all got injured, he said. 

On top of that we have to deal with the unprecedented mess happening in Italy, he added referring to the match-fixing scandal in Serie A. Yeah, you can say I have been really lucky. 

Lippi has altered his personnel and formation for each of the Azzurris games so far in the tournament and will be under pressure to recall Francesco Totti to the starting line-up. 

Totti, not yet back to full fitness after three months out with a broken ankle, started on the bench against Australia on Monday but came on in the final 15 minutes and converted the last-gasp penalty which secured passage to the last e ight. 

Blokhin has received a major blow with striker Andriy Voronin ruled out for the rest of the World Cup. He is likely to be replaced by Artem Milevsky, who impressed with a cheeky chip into the net during Ukraines penalty shoot-out victory this week over Switzerland. 

Also back in the frame for Fridays match in Hamburg is defender Volodymir Yezersky, who missed the last three games with a thigh injury. 

Vyacheslav Svidersky and Andriy Rusol return after the suspensions that kept them out of the penalty shootout victory over Switzerland in the second round. 

 PROBABLE TEAMS 

Italy: 1-Gianluigi Buffon; 19-Gianluca Zambrotta, 6-Andrea Barzagli, 5-Fabio Cannavaro, 3-Fabio Grosso; 20-Simone Perrotta, 21-Andrea Pirlo, 8-Gennaro Gattuso; 16-Mauro Camoranesi, 10-Francesco Totti; 11-Alberto Gilardino. 

 Ukraine: 1-Oleksander Shovkovsky; 6-Andriy 

 Rusol, 22-Vyacheslav Svidersky, 2-Andriy Nesmachny; 

 9-Oleg Gusev, 4-Anatoly Tymoshchyuk, 8-Oleg 

 Shelayev, 19-Maxim Kalinichenko, 11-Serhiy 

 Rebrov; 7-Andriy Shevchenko, 16-Andriy Vorobei.

 TACTICAL SNEAK-PEEK

 Italy coach Marcello Lippi has 

 altered his formation and personnel for each game so far. 

 The most likely options are his original 4-3-1-2 with two 

 strikers and Francesco Totti behind them or the 4-3-2-1 

 system that worked against Czech Republic using a sole striker 

 with Mauro Camoranesi and Totti in advanced midfield roles. 

 Ukraine are likely to stick with the 3-5-2 formation that 

 has seen them progress this far, although Andriy Shevchenko 

 will get a new strike partner because Andriy Voronin has 

 picked up a thigh injury and will miss the rest of the tournament.

 ITALY

 Defence: With the relatively 

 inexperienced Andrea Barzagli partnering Fabio Cannavaro 

 in the centre of defence, Cannavaro is likely to be given 

 the job of marking dangerman Shevchenko. Fullbacks Gianluca 

 Zambrotta and Fabio Grosso like to get forward but have 

 had limited opportunities so far. Grossos run in 

 the last minute against Australia that secured the decisive 

 penalty may tempt Lippi to urge more overlapping from the 

 pair.

 Midfield: Regardless of how the 

 forward line is organised, Lippi should stick with Andrea 

 Pirlo in his deep, playmakers role in front of the 

 defence with Gennaro Gattuso and Simone Perrotta covering 

 plenty of ground in their harrying roles.

 Forwards: With a single striker, 

 Totti will be free to play close to the front line but if 

 Lippi opts for a more offensive line-up, with Alberto Gilardino 

 and Luca Toni operating as a pair, then Totti will be expected 

 to drift deeper into midfield. Filippo Inzaghi is likely 

 to start on the bench but is an option if the Italians need 

 a goal in the second half.

 UKRAINE

 Defence: Ukraine benefit from 

 the return after suspension of Vyacheslav Svidersky and 

 Andriy Rusol, who are likely to be joined by Andriy Nesmachny 

 in a three-man defence. Defensive midfielder Anatoly Tymoshchyuk 

 can be relied on as a solid, if sometimes reckless, tackler 

 to help out at the back.

 Midfield: Attacking midfielder 

 Serhiy Rebrov is likely to return to the starting line-up 

 after coach Oleg Blokhin dropped him to the bench for the 

 last match after a weak showing against Tunisia.

 Forwards: Blokhin will probably 

 pair Andriy Vorobei with Shevchenko. Vorobei seems in favour 

 with the coach and was chosen to start instead of Rebrov 

 in the second round match against Switzerland.

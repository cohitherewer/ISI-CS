 Aussies feel invincible under Hiddink

 - Dutchman doesnt rule out upsetting Brazil 

Sydney: Guus Hiddink has the unerring knack of making the impossible possible in football and Australians are dreaming of the Dutch master coach working some more miracles at the World Cup. 

Australias qualification for Germany was another significant achievement in an impressive dossier for the 59-year-old Dutchman, widely regarded as one of the world games premier coaches. 

The Socceroos were down and almost out for the count when Hiddink was head-hunted to revive their World Cup fortunes last July, and his international reputation has made the Australian players feel bullet-proof. 

Hiddink has given them a belief that they can compete on the world stage. Within four months the Australians had reached the World Cup finals 32 years after their debut appearance in Germany after overcoming two-time champions Uruguay. 

When he was appointed national team coach, Hiddink said of his task, to be honest, in the outside football world many people think that Australia does not have any chance to qualify. But that is the challenge for me to make the impossible happen. 

Just like he did when he orchestrated South Koreas semi-final appearance at the last World Cup. 

As far as Hiddink is concerned the story doesnt end with Australias qualification. 

He is looking to make an impact in Germany before he heads off to Russia to revive their international fortunes. 

Australia are grouped with defending champions Brazil, Japan and Croatia but the Dutchman plans to adopt a possession-based strategy and take the game to the opposition. 

Hiddink is also not ruling out upsetting five-time champions and tournament favourites Brazil. 

When you have the spirit of this Australian team on the pitch you might have a chance to win, he said. They never give up. They go for 90 minutes at high pace. Its very important to go for 90 minutes with a huge mental force. 

Its quite an achievement already to be in the World Cup. But I know the Australian guys are not happy just by reaching the World Cup. I think this team can surprise, but I cannot predict where it will go. 

Meanwhile, John Aloisi, whose penalty earned Australia their first place at the finals in 32 years, is set to miss the Socceroos final home warm-up before the team heads out to Germany. 

The 30-year-old limped out of a training session in Melbourne on Monday with a foot injury and is poised to join Harry Kewell and Tim Cahill among the absentees for Thursdays match against Greece at the MCG. 

Aloisi initially feared he had aggravated a foot injury sustained while playing for Alaves, but after treatment he was confident he would be fit for the warm-up matches in Europe next month.

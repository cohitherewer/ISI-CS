 Miandad in fresh controversy

 Javed Miandad

Karachi: Controversy-prone Pakistani batting legend Javed Miandad has run into fresh trouble after being accused of abusing a senior Pakistan Cricket Board official. 

The former Pakistan captain is said to have abused PCB director (board operations) Abbas Zaidi at a dinner here last week, a charge which was denied by Miandad. 

The incident is believed to have taken place at a dinner thrown by former PCB chairman Tauqir Zia for the veteran teams of India and Pakistan. 

The incident forced PCB director, cricket operations, Saleem Altaf to issue a statement in which he described Miandads behaviour as disappointing. 

Miandad, on his part, denied abusing Zaidi. 

I have known Zaidi since 1982 and I didnt use any abusive language against the board or him. I did make some complaints regarding how they treat and shun former players and some other cricket issues, but no crude language was used, he said. 

Asked about Altafs statement, Miandad said, Altaf was not even present at the dinner so he doesnt know what exactly happened. But to say it was not the right forum to speak is not correct because it was a conversation between me and Zaidi and no one was listening. 

As a former captain and player, I know how important it is to maintain a good image of Pakistan and cricket. 

Although I prefer to keep my views to myself, that day I conveyed my views to Zaidi because I know him well, he said.

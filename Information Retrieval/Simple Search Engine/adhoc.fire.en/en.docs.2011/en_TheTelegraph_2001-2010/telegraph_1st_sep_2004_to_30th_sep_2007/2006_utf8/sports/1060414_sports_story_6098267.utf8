 Time running out for Sehwag, Kaif

Taking Guard

Graham Gooch

India lately have been hoping for Virender Sehwag to come good. There have been endless public assurances and even bouts of captaincy for good measure. It hasnt worked. Jamshedpur only added to the unease. 

India might not fret a great deal about the loss in the sixth one-dayer. The heat was terrible and there were far too many replacements, including a new set of medium-pacers. But they need reassurance in their top order. India are not willing to let go on Sehwag or Mohammed Kaif, or for that matter Sachin Tendulkar. But time is running out. 

Ideally, all of India would love to have these men in the 2007 World Cup. But they also need time to think of alternatives. Between now and the Caribbean carnival, a new player could at the most have 15 one-day Internationals. If India must change horses in midstream, the time to do it is now. 

That Sehwag has been affected is there for all to see. His initial bravado has given way to scepticism. Sehwag in repose at the crease has resembled a cat ready to pounce on anything that comes his way. A cobra in coil, a panther on haunches, a falcon in that strategic patrolling of the sky. 

He is a quintessential four-man; always visualising the shortest and swiftest passage of the ball to the boundary. Not at the moment, though. 

Bowlers now are teasing him outside the off-stump and he is curbing himself. He has put his instincts on hold and that is a dangerous ploy for those who are natures product. He has even begun to weigh the virtue of the pull shot these days. Sehwag is not the kind of batsman who can get away by restructuring his batting. 

Kaifs case is equally a study in regret. He has been dealt harshly by fate: his 90s and 50s have usually resulted in his omission in the next game, while for others it generally is a license for the next dozen. 

Now, when a string of failures have come, Kaif is leaning not so much on his reputation as on goodwill. Not long ago, he was one safe pair of legs in a bunch of no-gooders. Now even he doesnt stand out among Generation Next of Indian cricket. The Kaif of today will increasingly have to lean on his batting to firm up his base. Mere fielding will not do. 

One guesses there are still three games for these men to sort themselves out. It isnt the case of loss of ability; but a snapping up of confidence. They are lucky that India are winning, otherwise they would have been still more untenable. (PTI)

 Jeev finishes tied 14th

Sapporo: Jeev Milkha Singh pulled himself up the leaderboard with three birdies in the last seven holes to finish in a tie for 14th place at the 100 million Ana Open here on Sunday. 

The Chandigarh golfer finished with a two-under 69 to haul himself up from tied 19th place, and picked up 1,485,000 that moved him up two spots in the money list to 16th. 

With an aggregate of 279, Jeev was five shots behind the winner Tomohiro Kondo (69) who held off a strong challenge from Kiyoshi Maita (66) and Kaname Yokoo (66). 

The top Indian golfer now has nine finishes in the top-25 out of 11 starts, including seven top-10 finishes. He looked like falling out of the top-30 when he was one-over for the final day after 11 holes. 

But birdies on the 12th, 15th and 17th helped him get into red numbers for the day. Another birdie on 18th could have fetched him a tied seventh, but the putt went past. He also had bogeys on second and 11th. 

Jeev earlier birdied the par-five fifth hole for the fourth time in as many days. 

Overall, Jeev played the three par-fives on the course very well, and was nine-under playing them. He had eight birdies and an eagle, one bogey and two pars on the long ones.

 Black badge protest on Md. Sp. agenda

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Mohammedan Sporting executive committee on Wednesday decided on a unique black badge protest against the IFA. 

The players, officials and supporters will wear black badges during the Premier Division matches to protest against IFAs high-handedness, informed club secretary Sultan Ahmed. The club has been critical of the IFA over issues like the contentious transfer of three players to East Bengal as well as the change of Premier Division schedule. 

We have decided not to attend IFAs next meeting to discuss change in fixtures We wont go because they had already said the fixtures wont be changed but didnt stick to that decision, so this meeting has no value, Ahmed explained. 

The IFA moved Mohammedan Sportings match against East Bengal from Wednesday to September 8, but Ahmed said they wont play either on September 8 or 9. 

Mohammedan Sporting have also decided to ask the IFA what financial benefits the clubs will get from the CFL sponsorship deal. The IFA had said that the clubs will benefit from the sponsorship deal The league is almost halfway through, we want to know exactly how much the clubs will get, Ahmed said. 

Ahmed is flying to Delhi on Thursday for a meeting with Priya Ranjan Das Munshi.

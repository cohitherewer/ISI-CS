 India in third spot after series loss

Dubai: Indias 0-1 series loss to Pakistan has cost them their coveted second-best status in the latest LG ICC Test rankings. 

Greg Chappells men have slipped down to third spot after losing the third Test and the series against Pakistan in Karachi on Wednesday. 

The huge 341-run defeat cut Indias rating points from 115 to 111 and dropped them below England, who with 113 points, now find themselves in second place. Toppers Australia are way ahead with 129 points. 

For Pakistan, the series win not only made amends for their 1-2 home defeat at the hands of their arch rivals two years ago, but also boosted their rating in the Test championship table. 

Although they have not moved up and remain in fourth position, Pakistan still gained five rating points owing to the victory and now stand on 108 points, three behind India. 

In the ICC player rankings, Indian captain Rahul Dravids twin failures have cost him a place among the top five batsmen. Dravid is now placed sixth and although he remains Indias top-ranked batsman, his rating and ranking is his lowest in two years. 

Dravid is not alone among Indias batsmen in slipping down the rankings. Virender Sehwag is down two places to ninth while Sachin Tendulkar slips one spot to 12th. 

Yuvraj Singh moved up 23 places and is now joint 44th (along with Pakistan opener Salman Butt), his first time in the top 50. (PTI)

 Nine-team NFL confirmed

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The National Football League on Monday was effectively reduced to a nine-team affair when the Fransa Club chose to ignore the All India Football Federations 72-hour deadline to confirm whether they have disbanded the team. 

The AIFF general secretary, Alberto Colaco, confirmed that Fransa have missed the deadline, but refused to make any further comments. I cannot say anything without the concerned committee taking any decision, he said. 

While Colaco said the AIFF would announce the next course of action soon, sources confirmed the 10th NFL for the ONGC Cup will go ahead with nine teams. 

With Fransa-Pax already out of contention, only one team from the remaining nine will be relegated while two teams from the second division will be promoted to the elite division. 

As for results involving Fransa matches, the second-leg, for all purposes, would be declared null and void while results of matches which Fransa-Pax completed in the first phase, would be taken into consideration. 

Meanwhile, sources said the AIFF may allow Fransa players to take transfer on loan to other NFL clubs. 

The clubs, however, wont be able to sign more than two players, and the registration must be done within April 6, the sources added.

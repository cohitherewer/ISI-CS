 Koubek shows Ancic the door

 - Tursunov toils past Auckland; Robredo, Berdych cruise 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Mumbai: It was an explosion which not only paralysed the CCI centre court audience, but also sent organisers of the Kingfisher Airlines Open into a state of shock and despair. Causing all the misery was Stefan Koubek, a dangerous floater from Austria, who ousted crowd-puller No. 1 Mario Ancic 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. 

Anyone who knew the left-handers credentials would have shown respect to Koubek. He had, after all, scaled the worlds top-20 in 2000 and captured three titles before being a doping violation put him out of the game for three months in 2005. 

It took a great spirit and a strong will for Koubek to re-launch his career. He made the final of the Zagreb event in February this year, but thereafter it has been a hard grind for Koubek. 

Who would have backed such a fading 29-year-old against one of the emerging players on Tour? 

The first set didnt betray any sign of the impending mega upset. Ancic used his six-foot-five frame to serve his way into a position of strength, going one up with a break in the fourth game. 

Things went wrong from the middle of the second set when Koubek got a grip over his service returns and returned almost anything Ancic threw at him. Ancic dropped serve in the sixth game and broke right back, but his blond-haired opponent kept up the pressure to eventually level scores. 

With the sultry conditions tiring Ancic out by the minute and Koubek making him chase balls at every possible opportunity, it was crisis time for the second seed. 

He was broken in the sixth game and never recovered. He did save two match-points in the eighth game but couldnt stop Koubek from serving out the match in two hours and 11 minutes. 

I was the fitter player out there in the final set, thats why I won. My game is such that I can win a tournament and then suffer 10 first-round losses, said Koubek without mincing words. 

Ancic saluted his opponent, saying he really returned well from the second set. I had to play four-five big shots in one rally and that wasnt easy in such weather conditions. 

The weather again! What would they have done in Chennai? 

Tommy Robredo brought back some sanity to the evenings proceedings, surviving a low phase in the second set before overcoming Paraguayan Ramon Delgado 6-2, 7-6 (7-1). 

Earlier, Tomas Berdych at 21 the youngest of the quarter-finalists but certainly not the weakest pressed the cruise control button from point No. 1 and waltzed into the semis at No. 6 Bjorn Phaus expense. 

That first match on centre court lasted an hour and a quarter, but could have ended earlier had the six-foot-five third seed from Czech Republic not relaxed while serving for the match in the 10th game of the second set. He recaptured control quickly to close it out 6-3, 7-5. 

Not for nothing has Berdych broken into the top-20 this year. Armed with a powerful serve and a matching game from the backcourt, Berdych has something in his demeanour that suggests he would go far higher than his current world No. 17. 

The Czech bagged the first set capitalising on an early break (in game 2) and looked to be cruising to victory when he had that hiccup. 

Four unforced errors from the Czech gave Phau his first break of the match. Berdych, though, was in no mood to play a third set and captured Phaus service in the very next game with a pair of delectable returns. 

On court 1, fourth seed and world No. 22 Dmitry Tursunov saved himself the embarrassment of losing to a man ranked almost 400 slots below him. 

The Russian had to again come from behind and nudge out British qualifier James Auckland. 

Had Auckland pulled it off, it would have been one of the most stunning results in mens tennis. 

Auckland may be 26, but never managed to get into the main draw of a Tour event before this week.

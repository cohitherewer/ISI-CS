 Zidane hoping for a 1998 encore

 - Superstar prepares for a hollow 34th birthday 

Hamelin: On Zinedine Zidanes birthday, France will taste life without him, for one game or forever. 

The ageing maestro turns 34 on Friday, but will be suspended when the team he graced for over a decade plays Togo in their final World Cup group G game. 

The 1998 champions need to win by two goals to make sure of qualifying. If they do, their captain ? who will retire after the finals ? will be back for their first match in the knockout stage. 

If France fail to survive the group stage again, like they did in 2002, Sundays 1-1 draw with South Korea will have been Zidanes last match. 

The playmaker, who got his second yellow card of the tournament for shoving a Korean defender, had suffered a similar fate in 1998 when he missed two games through suspension, returning only for the quarter finals. 

I hope the same will happen this time, said Zidane, who went on to score twice in Frances 3-0 win over Brazil in the 1998 final. 

We will suffer but we all want to go further, for all those who support us, he added. 

The difference with 1998, or 2000, when France won the European Championship, is that Zidanes genius then turned France into the ultimate winning machine. 

Nowadays he remains an exceptionally talented player but is slower than in his prime and could only offer below-par performances in Frances first two group matches. 

He wont be there, full stop, said goalkeeper Fabien Barthez, who is a close friend of Zidanes. Theres no room for feelings in this type of competition. We must concentrate on playing our game and winning the match. 

France coach Raymond Domenech still relies heavily on Zidane, to the extent that he did not include another genuine No. 10 in his squad. 

Now Domenech seems to have no other option than to change his system and revert to a 4-4-2 formation with no real playmaker and two men up front, David Trezeguet or Louis Saha teaming up with Thierry Henry. (Reuters)

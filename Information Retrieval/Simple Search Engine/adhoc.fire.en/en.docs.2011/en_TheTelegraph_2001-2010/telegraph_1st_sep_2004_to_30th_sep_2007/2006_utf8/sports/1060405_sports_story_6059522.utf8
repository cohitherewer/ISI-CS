Colombo: Pakistan pace bowler Mohammed Asif claimed his first 10-wicket haul as Sri Lanka collapsed to 73 for eight in their second innings of the second Test on Tuesday. 

Replying to Sri Lankas 279, Pakistan lost their way after a solid start and were bowled out for 170 in 52.4 overs just after tea on the second day. 

Asif hit back during two long spells of sustained hostility in the final session of a day in which 20 wickets fell. 

Superbly exploiting a difficult pitch, which offered extravagant seam movement and increasing variations in bounce, Asif claimed five for 27 in 12 overs as Sri Lanka limped home with a lead of 182 runs. 

The 23-year-olds haul followed a career-best six for 44 in the first innings to give him match figures of 11 for 71. 

We have seen some high quality pace bowling in this game and Asif has bowled brilliantly, Pakistan team manager Zaheer Abbas said. 

He can be has good as some of the fast bowling greats that Pakistan have produced over the years. 

Asif ripped through the top order, bowling Upul Tharanga (12), Kumar Sangakkara (16) and Thilan Samaraweera (4). 

Allrounder Farveez Mahroof (1) went lbw and Tillekeratne Dilshan (11) edged to wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal, to give Asif his second five-wicket haul of the match. 

There was something in the wicket and they bowled well, especially Asif, Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene said. 

We made a brilliant comeback after not starting that well with the ball but they came back at us very strongly in the second innings. 

Wed have liked to have had a specialist batsman at the crease overnight but the bottom line is that we have to defend whatever total we get. 

We have to make sure we bowl in the same areas we bowled earlier today, he added.Sri Lankas cause was not helped by an injury to Sanath Jayasuriya, who is unlikely to play any further part in his final Test. 

Resuming on 267 for eight, Sri Lanka added just 12 runs before Nuwan Kulasekera (13) was bowled by Asif and Lasith Malinga (9) was caught in the covers off leg spinner Danish Kaneria. 

Stand-in opener Akmal ? promoted after Shoaib Malik pulled out with fever ? and Farhat gave the tourists a 57-run opening stand. 

But off spinner Muttiah Muralidharan took the first of his five wickets as Pakistan reached lunch on 71 for two. 

After the break, Mohammed Yousuf (17) and Younis Khan (35) shared a 50-run partnership for the third wicket before Muralidharan struck again. 

He bowled Yousuf trying to force an off break through the off side. 

Younis was then caught at slip off pace bowler Mahroof before Muralidharan trapped Faisal Iqbal lbw for five, and bowled Razzaq for four. He finished with five for 39 from 16.4 overs.

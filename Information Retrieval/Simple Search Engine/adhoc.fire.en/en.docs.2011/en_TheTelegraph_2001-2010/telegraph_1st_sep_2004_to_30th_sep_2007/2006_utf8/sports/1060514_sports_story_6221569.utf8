 Jeev moves up to tied 15th spot

 Japan Golf

 Gifu (Japan): Jeev 

 Milkha Singh gave an excellent display of putting, carding 

 a fine four-under 68 that saw him jump 31 spots to tied 

 15th place at the end of the third round of the Japan PGA 

 Championship.

 Jeev had five birdies and just 

 one bogey in his round. At one stage, he ran up four birdies 

 in a row from second to sixth holes.

 Jeev is now five-under for 54 

 holes and six behind the leader, Toru Taniguchi (69). Jeevs 

 only bogey of the day came on the 14th.

 The putter worked well today, 

 though I think I left a few shots out there, Jeev 

 said.

 I am happy with the way 

 I am playing and hopefully I can string together another 

 good round on the final day, said the winner of Volvo 

 China Open.

 Toru Taniguchi took a three-shot 

 lead with a three-under 69 at the end of three rounds. He 

 was one clear of fellow Japanese pro, Tadahiro Takayama 

 (69), while four players were tied in third place.Taniguchi 

 with three birdies and one bogey on front nine was a picture 

 of steadiness with one birdie and rest pars on back nine.

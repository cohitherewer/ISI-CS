 Our character is going to be tested in SA: Dravid 

 - History will not make much of a difference: Greg 

 Mumbai: Hours before embarking on a gruelling tour of South Africa, Team India captain Rahul Dravid advised his teammates not to be weighed down by their past failures but treat the series as a challenge and an opportunity to excel. 

Dravid said it was imperative for the established batsmen to score runs during the South Africa tour, which assumes importance with the World Cup round the corner. 

Adjusting to the bounce is going to be critical, Dravid told reporters before the one-day squads departure on Monday. 

Our character is going to be tested on the tour. As a batsman youve got to show patience, show a bit of courage. It is a great opportunity to learn about yourself and your game. We have not done well in the past few months, but I want to view this tour as a great opportunity, he added. 

India are scheduled to play a five-match one-day series and three Tests in South Africa. 

The captain said the wickets in South Africa will allow the batsmen to play their shots. The wickets will give us a chance to play shots. On the low and slow wickets here, the backfoot game was taken out. It will give us a lot more options to play our shots. 

Dravid said the team had worked on the grey areas and was going into the series with a positive frame of mind. 

Coach Greg Chappell said the team had the wherewithal to do well in South Africa as the wickets there will favour strokeplay. 

The tracks there will give us more options for playing strokes unlike the wickets in the subcontinent. But what is most important is to put the basics together. 

Chappell also brushed aside the fact that India have not won a Test match in previous trips to South Africa. History is not going to make much of a difference. We went to the West Indies where we had not won for 35 years and came back with a Test series win. We formulated a game plan and stuck to it. We need to do the basics well. 

Dravid, however, felt Kumbles return would lend it added experience. 

Anil brings a lot of experience to the attack and his personality is equally important. He was always in the back of our minds. It was just a question of when to bring him back. This is the right time, in the lead-up to the World Cup. It gives him a chance to get ready for the World Cup, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Still a long way to go, says Murali

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: For Sri Lanka to win the Champions Trophy, an allround effort not just his golden arms is most important, believes Muttiah Muralidharan. 

Playing down his role in Sri Lankas seven-wicket win over New Zealand, the Man-of-the-Match said on Friday that the team took a small step towards a series of challenges ahead. There is still a long way to go. What we need is consistency, he pointed out. 

New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming, however, was all praise for the bowler. Murali is probably the greatest bowler in both forms of the game. He picked up wickets at regular intervals and put pressure on us It had a telling effect on our hopes for a fightback, Fleming observed. 

According to Muralidharan, the PVA glue which was sprayed on the Brabourne strip before the match, had helped the surface improve considerably, a view supported by Fleming as well. 

There was a few odd bounces on the track, but because of the use of glue, it was not spinning as much as it was the case earlier (against the West Indies last Saturday). But this is not new to me, as I have already played on such glue-smeared pitch in Lancashire (in County cricket), Murali said. 

The Sri Lankan refused to read too much into his success in the recent Test series against South Africa, their next opponents in the Champions Trophy. In one-day cricket, nothing is predictable, he said.

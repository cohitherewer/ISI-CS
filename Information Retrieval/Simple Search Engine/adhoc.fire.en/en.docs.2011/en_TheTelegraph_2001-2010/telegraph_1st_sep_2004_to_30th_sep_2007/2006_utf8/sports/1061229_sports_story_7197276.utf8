 Wont 

 let emotions overwhelm me in 2007

 Teeing Off 

 Jeev Milkha Singh

 What 

 a year this has been. Earlier this week I got the perfect 

 Christmas gift my invitation to the Augusta Masters.

 It has been my life-long ambition 

 to play at the Masters. Walking down the 18th green at the 

 Chandigarh Golf Club in my early years, I would often tell 

 my caddie about my dream of walking the 18th at the Masters 

 and he would simply shake his head and ask me to get on 

 with my hitting.

 This week, I could not help thinking 

 about all those moments, when the mailman handed me the 

 envelope with the Masters invite. That capped a perfect 

 year, the kind I have been dreaming about since the day 

 I started.

 So, what has been the change this 

 year? The most important change has been that I am more 

 focused on my routine and processes; and that I have felt 

 calm and composed, both personally and professionally.

 I am no longer result oriented; 

 I just want to play my best and I know every time that happens 

 I will be in contention.

 I started the year feeling it 

 would be great if I could get one win. And now when I am 

 ending it, I have four wins and a place in worlds 

 top-40. It really has been amazing. On January 1, 2006, 

 I set myself a goal of getting a win that had eluded me 

 since 1999. I knew I had it in me but I was not ready to 

 make any more goals till I attained this one first.

 Right at the start of the season 

 I came close in Pakistan when I tied for second. I knew 

 it was close, but I did not talk about it to anyone except 

 those closest to me. Then all things finally fell in place 

 at China Open in Beijing.

 When I walked off the 18th green, 

 my first feeling was one of relief the monkey was finally 

 off my back. It was also a reward for hanging in there despite 

 so many close calls. It was an emotional moment for me.

 I am ever grateful to my family, 

 friends and all those who had stood by me in the tough years 

 in between. I am quite strong mentally a gift I have from 

 my father but it is still difficult when things are not 

 going the way you want them to. While getting ready for 

 2006, I had worked on some technicalities with my close 

 friend, Amritinder Singh. The improvement showed. When I 

 won China Open I got back my confidence. I maintained my 

 mental strength.

 Once that win was in the bag, 

 a few doubts had been set right. Now I needed to reassess 

 my goals. Now I was looking forward to a top-100 ranking 

 in the world. I was getting great results regular top-10 

 finishes and China Open had put me on top of the UBS Asian 

 Tour Order of Merit.

 I was a little disappointed at 

 not having made the British Open, but I did make the US 

 Open and for the second time I made the weekend rounds. 

 That gave me more confidence.

 A place in top-100 was there, 

 but now I wanted to carry on further. I came close to another 

 win in Japan in the first week of November, but ended second. 

 Thats when I felt I could pull of wins on three different 

 tours. I was playing a lot and my wrist was hurting a bit, 

 but I was playing very well. I had committed to some events 

 in Japan, which is where I have my big sponsors, GMA, who 

 make my irons.

 What of 2007? There is a saying 

 that it is difficult to get to the top but even more difficult 

 to stay there. I finished as No.1 in Asia and No.2 in Japan. 

 I will be playing with the very best in 2007 on a regular 

 basis. But I am not going to be overwhelmed by emotions 

 like making my debut at the Masters or playing with the 

 best. (PTI)

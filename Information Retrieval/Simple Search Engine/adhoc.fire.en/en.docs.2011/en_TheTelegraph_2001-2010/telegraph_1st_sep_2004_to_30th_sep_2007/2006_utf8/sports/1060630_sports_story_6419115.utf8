 Figo focuses on basics 

Marienfeld: Luis Figo was concentrating on the basics before the World Cup quarter finals, knowing that a career-defining moment could lie ahead in a penalty kick shootout against England. 

Figo, rated the best player in Europe and in the world at stages of his 15-year international career, already has earned a Portugal record 124 caps and is not sure how many more he can add. Any game could be my last. Im not eternal, he said on Thursday. 

His ideal finish would be three more matches in Germany 2006. Right now, though, hes only thinking about improving his winning mark against England to 3-0.

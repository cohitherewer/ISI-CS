Madrid: Third-placed Real Madrid lost 1-2 at lowly Real Mallorca on Sunday, ending their six-match winning run in the Primera Liga. 

With second-placed Valencia held 1-1 home draw by Getafe, Barcelona strengthened their grip at the top thanks to Saturdays 2-0 victory at Real Zaragoza. 

The champions have 58 points from 25 games, Valencia have 50 points and Real 48. Osasuna, in fourth on 46 points, failed to take advantage of Reals defeat as they lost 2-1 at home to Deportivo Coruna, who are seventh on 40. 

Real were cautious and disjointed after their midweek Champions League defeat by Arsenal. The visitors took the lead against the run of play through Sergio Ramos after 32 minutes, but 16th-placed Mallorca always looked dangerous. 

Argentine striker Leonardo Pisculichi levelled from the penalty spot in the 53rd minute and 10 minutes from time Venezuelan forward Juan Arango grabbed the winner. 

Getafe held firm under intense pressure from Valencia until they had Argentine defender Anibal Matellan sent off in the 65th minute. 

Valencia defender David Navarro broke the deadlock from close range after Fabio Aurelios free kick was headed back across goal by Mario Regueiro on 78 minutes. 

A wayward pass from David Albelda into his own area allowed Nano to sneak in and fire an unlikely equaliser for Getafe two minutes from time. The draw allowed Valencia to stretch their unbeaten league run to 14 games. 

Meanwhile, a leading Spanish anti-racist organisation has called on professional footballers to delay the start of next weekends league matches as part of a plea for tougher action against racism in Spanish football. 

The request came after Barcelonas Cameroon striker Samuel Eto threatened to leave the pitch during Saturdays league match at Real Zaragoza after being subjected to racist abuse by a section of the home fans. 

Elsewhere in Italy, AS Roma set a record of 11 consecutive Serie A wins when goals by Rodrigo Taddei and Alberto Aquilani secured a 2-0 triumph over city rivals Lazio on Sunday. The derby win kept Roma fourth in the table with 54 points from 27 matches. 

Leaders Juventus (70 points) came from behind to defeat struggling Lecce 3-1 and maintain their 10-point advantage over AC Milan, who won 2-0 in Palermo. Inter Milan lie third on 58 points after beating Udinese 3-1. 

Without captain Francesco Totti, who fractured his ankle against Empoli last week, Roma lacked their usual fluency early on. 

Lazio looked more dangerous and striker Tommaso Rocchi struck the post in the 13th minute. 

Roma showed their ruthlessness by taking advantage of their first scoring chance in the 31st minute, Taddei rising at the near post to nod in a corner. 

Lazio continued to press but lacked the spark to break through the defence and Roma made sure of maximum points in the 63rd minute. (REUTERS)

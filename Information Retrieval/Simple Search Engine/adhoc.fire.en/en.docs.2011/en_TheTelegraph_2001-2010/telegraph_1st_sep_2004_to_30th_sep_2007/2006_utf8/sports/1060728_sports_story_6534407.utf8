 India go past Canada

 World Junior Squash

 New Delhi: Harinderpal 

 Singh engineered a win for India over sixth seeds Canada 

 in the fifth to eighth place play-off at the World Junior 

 squash championships in Palmerston North, New Zealand, on 

 Thursday.

 With the tie level at 1-1, Harinder 

 went two games down against David Letourneau before levelling 

 and sealing the victory 2-9, 2-9, 9-5, 9-2, 9-4. 

 With a 0-3 deficit in the third, 

 most players would have given up hope but Harinder came 

 up with an outstanding display keeping the ball to a good 

 length and hitting nicks at will. There were a few 50 

 shot rallies with Harinder waiting patiently for his 

 opponents error.

 Earlier, Naresh Kumar levelled 

 the tie after Sandeep Jangra went down 2-9, 2-9, 9-6, 8-10 

 to Keith Pritchard. Naresh beat Dave Glass 9-2 1-9 9-3 9-2.

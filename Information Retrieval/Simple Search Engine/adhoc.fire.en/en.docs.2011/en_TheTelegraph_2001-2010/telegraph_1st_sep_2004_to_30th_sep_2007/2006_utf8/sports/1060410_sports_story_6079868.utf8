 Highly emotional week, says Paes

Mumbai: Indian captain Leander Paes said it was a highly emotional week for him but was thrilled to end it on a victorious note against Pakistan on Sunday. 

The whole week was very emotional for me. Davis Cup play is always close to my heart. I suffered a bout of cramps and physically was drained going into the fifth set (against Aqeel Khan). But I managed to pull it off. I have to give credit to the boys too, Paes said after beating his Pak rival in three hours and 40 minutes. 

Paes won the first two sets 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) and lost the next two 3-6, 0-6 due to cramps in his thigh before strongly coming back to win the decider 6-1. 

The Indian skippe said playing the fifth rubber of the tie against Pakistan at home also made him very emotional. 

I played instead of Rohan because it was the fifth match of the rubber and I had been in this situation in the past. You people know and my teammates know that in the fifth set it was not backhands and forehands that would decide the outcome but a strong mind and heart, he explained. 

I tried only drops and lobs in the last set to conserve my energy and at the same time tire out Aqeel who, in the end, was pretty exhausted. 

Paes said he had to doff his hat to the Pakistan team who tried their level best and played hard in the right spirit of the game. I know their feeling well after having lost. I have been in that situation. Thats why I went and hugged them after the match. 

Pakistan captain Rashid Malik said he was sure that Paes would come all out on the attack in the final set after losing the third and fourth tamely. 

I knew Leander could not play like that in the third and fourth sets. I knew he would come at Aqeel. Had Aqeel converted the break points in the first game of the last set things could have turned out differently. Paes experience told in the end, he said. (PTI)

 Surya Sekhar, Sandipan sail

Gibraltar: Indian Grandmasters got off to a good start with fine victories but their women counterparts had a tough time in the opening round of the gibtele.com Masters Chess meet at the Caleta Hotel here. 

Meanwhile, in a rather sensational result of the day, WGM Natalia Zhokova of Ukraine held top seeded GM Alexei Shirov on the first board. 

Shirov was simply taken aback with the fine game played by Zhukova steering the game to a draw. 

The field is tough with the presence of Shirov, English GM Nigel Short and Armenian GM Vladimir Akopian among 27 GMs. 

GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly cruised past WGM Masha Klinova of Israel. 

Playing white, Surya Sekhar had to use his opening and middle game expertise to start his campaign on a positive note. GMs Sandipan Chanda, Abhijit Kunte and Tejas Bakre also won their respective games. 

Among other Indians in the fray, GM norm holder S. Kidambi was held by Petra Schuurman of The Netherlands and Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury lost to higher rated GM Sergey Volkov of Russia. 

Indian women especially suffered in the opening round of this tough event, succumbing to defeats with the lone exception was Nimmy George, who got the better of Amaya Millan of Spain.

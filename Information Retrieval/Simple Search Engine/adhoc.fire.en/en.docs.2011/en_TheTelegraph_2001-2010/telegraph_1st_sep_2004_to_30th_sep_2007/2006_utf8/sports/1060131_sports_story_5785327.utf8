Margao: Referee P. Bikramjits decision to award two penalties to Mahindra United cost Fransa dearly as they went down to the Federation Cup champions 1-2 in a 10th ONGC National Football League (NFL) match played at the Nehru Stadium here on Monday. 

The Goan side took the lead in the 10th minute through Brazilian Ivan DSilva.

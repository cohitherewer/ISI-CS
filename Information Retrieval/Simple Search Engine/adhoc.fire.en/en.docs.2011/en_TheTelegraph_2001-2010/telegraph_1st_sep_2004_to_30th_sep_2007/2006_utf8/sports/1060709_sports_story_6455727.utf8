 10 things to watch out for today 

 - GRAND FINALE IN BERLIN 

 Will it be Zinedine Zidanes dream-come-true party or end of Azzurris 24-year-long wait? Heres a peek into ten key factors before the grand finale kicks off: 

 Barthez vs Buffon 

Frances Fabien Barthez is an acrobatic show-stopper with a penchant for the bizarre. He often punches the ball rather than catch it. Italys Gianluigi Buffon, the most expensive goalkeeper in the world at $46 million, is rock-solid. Buffon inspires his defence, while Barthez can give his a headache. 

 Referee Elizondo 

The 42-year-old physical education teacher from Argentina has issued 22 yellows and two straight reds in his four previous games at the tournament. But 18 of those cards came in two games: Switzerland-South Korea (10 yellows) and Ghana-Czech Republic (seven yellows and one red). Elizondo pulled out just one yellow in the tournament opener between Germany and Costa Rica. 

 Set-pieces 

Both teams have plenty of weapons in their dead-ball arsenal. Frances Thierry Henry can be deadly from free kicks although he has yet to put one on target at the tournament. Zinedine Zidane can curl in a sweet corner and is an iceman at the penalty spot. Italys Francesco Totti leads the tournament with five free kicks on goal, while Andrea Pirlo is another legitimate threat to score from set pieces. 

 Eyes on Henry 

Arsenal striker Henry likes to lurk on the wing, usually the left, and then work his way into the penalty box or fire in a cross. He is a master at creating space from a defender and doesnt need much room to get off a shot. Watch him as he brings down a long ball from a teammate. 

 Targetmen 

Totti and Henry have been among the most accurate players at the tournament. Of the 14 shots each has attempted, 11 were on target (Henry has three goals, Totti has one). 

 Midfield steel 

Gennaro Gattuso is the main destroyer for the Italians with 31 tackles in five games. Gattuso can be ruthless in the tackle but has only been called for 10 fouls. Pirlo has made another 20 tackles. The French watchdogs are Patrick Vieira (31 tackles, 14 fouls) and Claude Makelele (nine tackles, 13 fouls). 

 The Italian way 

While Italy have options on the flank, often Totti, Pirlo and others look to get the ball to big striker Toni at the front. Toni can then either look to get past his defender or hold the ball up and pass it to a supporting teammate. 

 Captain fantastic 

Watch the way Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro patrols Azzurri territory and anticipates enemy attacks. He has great vision and can make a beeline for the ball before it reaches the opponent it was destined for. Just 1.75 meters (5-foot-9), he is also good in the air. 

 Hard-charging Vieira 

Statuesque France midfielder Patrick Vieira has a penchant for coming in late, moving into space vacated by a defence tending to other threats, to receive a pass and take a shot at goal. Vieira picks his spots, but can be deadly. 

 Zizous finale 

Keep an eye on Zinedine Zidane and watch how he freezes opponents with step-overs and body feints. He then uses his opponents imbalance to deliver a seeing-eye pass to a teammate. (AP)

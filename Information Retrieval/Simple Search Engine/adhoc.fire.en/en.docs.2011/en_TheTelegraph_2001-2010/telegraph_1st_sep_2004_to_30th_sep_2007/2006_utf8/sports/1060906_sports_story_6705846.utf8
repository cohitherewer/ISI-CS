New York: Gasping for breath after long exchanges, Serena Williams ran out of energy and answers against Amelie Mauresmo. 

 Jelena Jankovic of Serbia advanced to her first Grand 

 Slam semi-final when she knocked out fourth-seeded Elena 

 Dementieva 6-2, 6-1 on Tuesday. Dementieva, the runner-up 

 in 2004, hadnt dropped a set in her four previous 

 matches, but she failed to hold serve even once against 

 19th-seeded Jankovic. 

In a showdown between two women whove been ranked No. 1 and own a total of nine Grand Slam titles, the top-seeded Mauresmo won nine of the last 12 points Monday night to beat the unseeded Williams 6-4, 0-6, 6-2 and reach the US Open quarter finals. 

I could have came out on top had I made a few more shots and had I just been a little bit more consistent, said Williams, who didnt think her recent lack of matches was a factor. Maybe a little bit more fire or something. 

Williams, a seven-time major winner and 9-1 against Mauresmo coming in, was superb in the second set. But the outcome turned at 3-2 in the final set, when a 35-stroke exchange ended with Williams pushing a backhand into the net, then pausing for air something Mauresmo noticed. 

That sent Mauresmo on her way to a key break, and Williams wouldnt win another game, saying later: Just fell apart after that. 

On match point, they engaged in a 24-stroke rally that Mauresmo ended with a sharply angled volley Williams couldnt get to in time. 

I dont think she picked up her game 1,000 per cent or even that much, Williams said. I just think that she cut back on the errors. 

What Mauresmo didnt do was force the issue: She finished with only 12 winners, 10 fewer than Williams. But Williams was largely her own undoing down the stretch, with 15 unforced errors in the third set alone, only one fewer than she had in the first two sets combined. 

 Williams, who won the Open in 1999 and 2002, came to Flushing Meadows this time having played only 12 matches all season because of a six-month break she used to rehab her surgically repaired left knee and to refresh herself mentally, too. Williams tumbled out of the top 100 in the rankings, and needed a wild-card invitation to play at the Open. 

The experience Ive got really helped me tonight, Mauresmo said. Its starting to show a little bit on the court. 

 That was certainly the case the way she hung in there after a disastrous second set. Mauresmo lost 20 of the sets first 26 points and finished it with one winner. But she regrouped in the third. 

Being able to keep the composure in these key moments is probably making a huge difference at the end of the day, Mauresmo said. 

At the end and start of the match, Mauresmo wrong-footed Williams with groundstrokes and gave her fits by mixing speeds and spins. One example: Mauresmo broke to end the first set by launching a high-bouncing shot that Williams sailed wide. 

With that, Mauresmo raised a fist, clenched her jaw and jogged to the sideline. Williams walked over slowly, her sister Venus (sidelined with a wrist injury) and mother looking on from the guest box, while her father snapped photos from elsewhere in the stands. 

Now Mauresmo plays No. 12 Dinara Safina, whose path to the final eight hasnt included a seeded player. 

The match under the lights at Arthur Ashe Stadium brought back some electricity to a tournament that felt a bit Monday afternoon like a party carrying on after the guest of honour has left. 

The US Open did indeed proceed without Andre Agassi, although a fan cried out, Do it for Andre! during Andy Roddicks fourth-round match. 

Andy Roddick put together a 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 victory over Benjamin Becker, the German qualifier who ended Agassis career the day before. 

Roddick and No. 5 James Blake, whose fourth-round match against No. 12 Tomas Berdych is Tuesday, are the only American men left in the tournament. No. 18 Robby Ginepri bowed out with a 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 3-6, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1) loss to No. 14 Tommy Haas. 

2004 Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova is gone after losing to No. 19 Jelena Jankovic 6-7 (5-7) 6-3, 6-2. Also into the quarter finals were No. 3 Maria Sharapova who lost the first three games before eliminating No. 24 Li Na of China 6-4, 6-2 along with 2004 runner-up Elena Dementieva. 

He moves on to a rematch from the 2001 quarter finals against that years champion, Lleyton Hewitt, who got past No. 25 Richard Gasquet 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 3-6, 6-3 in a match that lasted more than three-and-a-half hours and ended at 12:53 a.m. Tuesday on Ashe. That main court was the scene of Agassis last hurrah.

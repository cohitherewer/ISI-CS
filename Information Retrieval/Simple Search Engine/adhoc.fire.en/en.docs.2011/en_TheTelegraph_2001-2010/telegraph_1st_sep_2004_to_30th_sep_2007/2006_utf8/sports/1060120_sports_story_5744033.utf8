 Curator is being made the scapegoat

 - Team specifically wanted a placid wicket in Lahore

The curators are at the receiving end for preparing a placid track for the first Test against India, and the cricket administrators are putting the blame squarely on the weather. 

Frankly speaking, no curator in the world is so authoritative or powerful that he would prepare a pitch against the wishes of the home team. 

When I was the captain in the home series against England in 2000, we wanted spinning tracks and we got them, although we lost the Karachi Test. So, to say that the groundsmen did not get instructions from the team management is a poor explanation and an effort to shift the blame. 

What is understandable, though, is that the curators failed to produce the pitch they were expected to. But again, I have a different view on this and I believe Pakistan specifically wanted this type of pitch. 

Pakistan declared their first innings at 679 and if my memory is correct, they scored something like 350 runs in under 60 overs on the second day. I think they thought that on this wicket, the ball would reverse and their pace trio would run through the Indian batting line-up that was a bit nervous owing to several reasons. 

The home team was also banking on Danish Kaneria to pick up a few wickets on a pitch that would deteriorate because he is a big turner of the ball and has plenty of varieties that he uses intelligently. 

That gameplan backfired, simply because Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid played a marvellous innings. It was a very risky gameplan. For a minute, let us assume that India had won the toss and set Pakistan a 480-run target to avoid follow-on. Would Pakistan have batted as well as the Indians did? Your guess is as good as mine! 

The Lahore wicket, I believe, was not much different to the one we got in Multan a couple of years ago and there, India batted first and we suffered an innings defeat. 

India gained everything from the weather-affected Test. The tourists had arrived here unsure of what to expect from the hosts who were flying high after a memorable victory against England in the Test and one-day series. 

In contrast, India, despite beating South Africa and Sri Lanka at home, had problems with team selection, made all the more difficult after the inclusion of former captain Sourav Ganguly. Rahul Dravid was captaining the team for the first time in a big series like this and the bowlers needed time to settle down. But after this Test, everything apparently has fallen in the right place for the visitors. 

The Indian bowlers may have lost some confidence after the hammering they got from Pakistan in the first innings, but it was restored with a mammoth 410-run first wicket partnership between Sehwag and Dravid. 

If India gained everything, what did Pakistan earn? 

To me, nothing. In fact, they lost everything. The pre-series tag of favourites has gone down the drain and as I see things, they may go to the drawing board wondering what to do for the Faisalabad and Karachi Tests, particularly for the last Test because everyone is expecting another weather-hit game in Faisalabad. 

Sehwag is a dangerous batsman and although Pakistan bowlers tried to trap him by bowling in his rib-cage area, he nicely tackled those deliveries. Dravid was as cool and composed as ever, although it is very difficult for a batsman to keep pace with a partner who is firing all cylinders. It was sad that they missed breaking the world record by four runs but I think Greg Chappell is largely responsible for that. 

He should have sent out a message on the fourth evening, informing the two about the record and they would have continued instead of accepting light even at the time when they were disappearing the ball to all parts of the ground. 

Chappell still appears uncomfortable with the presence of Ganguly and the animated discussion he had before the start of the match with the former captain in the presence of Dravid, says it all. 

The more quickly the Indian team gets over this Ganguly affair, the better because this is an opportunist Pakistan side, capable of pouncing on any opportunity that comes there way. (PTI)

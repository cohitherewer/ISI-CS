 RCTC to host Invitation 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Clouds of uncertainty have cleared. RCTC will be holding the Indian Turf Invitation Cup and the other important races in March 2007, informed RCTC chief steward Gen. (retd) Shankar Roychowdhury on Wednesday afternoon. The original dates of March 3 and 4 are, however, subject to alteration in view of the Holi festival, he added. 

 RCTC will be hosting the event after 11 years. It comes by rotation among the five turf authorities in the country. RCTC had to shift the ye-ar 2001 edition of the Invitation to Bangalore owing to workers strike.

 The cash-strapped RCTC had been trying to shift the Invitational races to Bangalore again after Hyderabad Race Club expressed inability to exchange its turn with RCTC to host the annual festival of racing on flimsy grounds. Bangalore, too, had been dilly dallying the matter, making it a prestige issue for the RCTC stewards, who took a bold decision to host the show at any cost. The new generation of turfites, therefore, have every reason to feel happy that the racing bonanza is going to return to the city.

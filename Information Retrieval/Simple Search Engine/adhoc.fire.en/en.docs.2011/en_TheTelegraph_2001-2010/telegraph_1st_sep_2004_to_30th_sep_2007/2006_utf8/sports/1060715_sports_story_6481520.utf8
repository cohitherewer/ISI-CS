 Jyoti at tied 10th 

Loch Lomond: Jyoti Randhawa was placed at a commendable tied 10th after playing some terrific golf to card three-under 68 in the first round of Scottish Open. 

The other two Indians had a mixed day with Jeev Milkha Singh suffering a mid-round lapse with three successive bogeys to finish at one-under and in tied 37th place. 

He was two-under with birdies on the 13th and 14th before hitting a putting-block as it were and dropped three shots in a row before recovering with two birdies on his second nine. 

Shiv Kapur, one of the only three Indians to have assured himself a start in next weeks British Open, looked fine at two-under after 15th before finishing with bogeys on 16th and 18th and an over-par card at one-over 72 . 

There is still hope of a British Open berth for Randhawa and Jeev as one place is yet to be decided. The top non-exempt finisher gets a berth into the open next week.

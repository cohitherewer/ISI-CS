 BCCI looking into conflict

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has taken note of the misgivings of some players over the conflict between their personal endorsements with mega brands like Adidas and Reebok and its own tie-up with Nike. 

The issue was informally discussed at a meeting of the key officials this (Sunday) morning... The discussions are going to continue in Mohali, before Indias match against Australia (October 29), a source told The Telegraph. 

The central contracts, by the way, will be offered afresh in a few weeks. 

Meanwhile, International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed was in the city and witnessed the India versus England face-off. Till late at night, though, there was no indication that hed had a one-on-one either with BCCI president Sharad Pawar or any of his key lieutenants. 

The BCCI and the ICC have been at war over the signing of participation-related agreements for events conducted by the world body.

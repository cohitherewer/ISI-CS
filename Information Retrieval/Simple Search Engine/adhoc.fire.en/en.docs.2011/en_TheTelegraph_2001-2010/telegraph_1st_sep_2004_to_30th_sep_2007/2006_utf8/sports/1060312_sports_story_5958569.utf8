Calcutta: It is the start of the Formula One season but with Narain Karthikeyan, the fastest Indian, cooling his heels as the test driver for Williams, it wont be such a happening one for India. 

But the scenario may change if another aspirant, Karun Chandhok, waiting on the wings to make an entry into the F1 arena, has his proverbial big break by being a test driver for his dream team Williams. 

Words of advice from F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone, at least, made Karun feel that it is not the end of the road for him. I spoke to Bernie when he came to India last year on a personal visit. I have still a long way to go. 

It hasnt been the best of times for Indias A1 driver. A disappointing show at the inaugural A1 GP notwithstanding, Karun is hopeful that by 2007 he would clinch the Williams deal. The 22-year-old from Chennai spoke to The Telegraph about his experience at the A1 GP and future plans on the sidelines of the Merchants Cup Go-Karting competition at the Clown Town on Saturday. 

On his first A1 experience, Karun said: It was a good to be a part of such a big championship, unfortunately, things didnt work out for me. It is shameful that our hard work was not enough to compliment the efforts of Atul Gupta (the promoter of Indias A1 team). 

I pulled out after the first two races (in England and Germany) after having problems with team manager Akbar Ebrahim, revealed Karun. He (Akbar) wanted to run the team in his own way, which I didnt like. 

Akbar, father of Armaan, was accused of running a father and son show in the A1 team. Armaan is a good driver, but he is too young for the A1 circuit. He jumped from Formula BMW to A1 GP, a big leap but not a healthy one. You have to gradually go through all the stages, said Karun. 

Karun was the youngest to win the 2001 Asian Formula Championship at the age of 17 and two years later, he was third in the British Formula 3 Championship. 

Moving away form the World Series owing to financial constraints, Karun has now set his eyes on Formula Renault V6 Asia. 

World Series is a costly affair and I never got to drive a full season. A season costs nearly Rs 3.6 crore. But now with the Formula Renault V6 Asia coming up I think I can drive full season. It is just half the cost of the World Series, stated Karun. 

In fact, Karun is even thinking of fielding his own team in the Formula Renault V6 Asia. We have our family team Wallace Sports and Research Foundation (WSRF) and we may launch it in the first race at Sepang in Malaysia. But there is less than a month left and it will need a lot of hard work to see the project through, he added.

 Stiffness in neck, headache for Sachin

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: Sachin Tendulkar, who was involved in a collision with Mohammed Yousuf on Monday afternoon, had stiffness in the neck and a headache when The Telegraph spoke to him (at the Sheraton) late in the evening. 

The headache hasnt gone and theres stiffness (in the neck)... Otherwise, Im fine, he said, adding he hadnt yet seen the TV replay of what could have been a grave injury. The mishap took place when Yousuf was completing a single off Zaheer Khan. 

Asked whether (while diving at the non-strikers end) hed overlooked the possibility of colliding, Sachin answered: I was struck on the jaw (by the boot) and... Actually, the collision itself is a blur... The only thought then was that I could effect a run out... 

The Team India physio, John Gloster, didnt think a scan was needed. If the pain continues, though, Sachin will probably undergo one. On Sunday, hed been hit on the helmet by a Shoaib Akhtar bouncer.

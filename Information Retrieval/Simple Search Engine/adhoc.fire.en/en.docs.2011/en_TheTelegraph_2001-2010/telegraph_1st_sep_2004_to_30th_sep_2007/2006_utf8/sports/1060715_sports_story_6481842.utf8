 Kranjcar sacked

Zagreb: Zlatko Kranjcar was sacked as Croatias coach on Friday following a disappointing early exit at the World Cup finals in Germany. 

The national associations (HNS) 19-member executive committee voted unanimously to replace Kranjcar, the report said, adding that a new coach would be named soon. 

An HNS source said the FA was looking at a foreigner as a possible replacement. 

The new coach will lead Croatia in the Euro 2008 qualifiers against England, Russia, Macedonia, Israel and Andorra. Kranjcar, 49, took over in 2004 and enjoyed an excellent World Cup qualifying campaign, leading Croatia to the top of their group, ahead of Sweden and Bulgaria. 

BeforeWorld Cup finals, Kranjcar voiced confidence his squad should progress from their group, which included Brazil, Australia and Japan, but failed to post a single victory. (Reuters)

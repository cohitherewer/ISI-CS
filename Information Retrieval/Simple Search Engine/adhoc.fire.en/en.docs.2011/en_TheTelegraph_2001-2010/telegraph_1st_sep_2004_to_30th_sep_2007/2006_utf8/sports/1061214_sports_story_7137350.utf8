Calcutta: Mahindra United brought curtains on Shenzen FCs aspirations with a 1-0 win in the second semi-final at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. Surkumar Singh struck the winner in the 79th minute with a thumping left-footer and helped his team set up Fridays title clash against Mohun Bagan. 

Manjit Singh undoubtedly the livewire in Mahindras attack fed Surkumar on the right. The side-back charged ahead with great balance and speed, took one Shenzen rival in his stride and unleashed a cracking left-footer from about 20 yards which beat the goalkeeper Zhang Lei at the first post. 

Mahindra could have easily returned winners by a much bigger margin but Manjit and Felipe Azevedo were the two major culprits, missing the target twice from close range.

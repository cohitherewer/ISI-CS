 Clarke added to squad

Sydney: Michael Clarke has been added to the Australian squad for next weeks first Ashes Test as cover for the injured Shane Watson. 

Clarke was overlooked when the Australian selectors named their 13-man squad on Thursday but was rushed back in after Watson strained his right hamstring in a domestic one-dayer in Perth on Friday. 

Watson was due to be assessed by physiotherapist, Alex Kountouris, when he arrived in Brisbane. A decision on his availability is expected on Sunday. 

The 25-year-old Watson has a long history of injuries and Clarkes inclusion in the squad could suggest his chances of playing in the first Test are fading. (Reuters)

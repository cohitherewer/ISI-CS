 AIFF holds back announcement 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 India Coach

 New Delhi: The All India 

 Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday not only held back 

 the announcement about Bob Houghtons appointment as 

 the national coach, but even kept the members in the dark 

 in this regard. 

 While the federation officials 

 said that the formal communication will be made public in 

 a couple of days, the members were not briefed on the subject 

 when they met in a special general body meeting (SGM) in 

 the capital. 

 The members, according to sources, 

 were told that no other subject, except the ones in the 

 agenda, could be taken up for discussion. 

 Meanwhile, AIFF president Priya 

 Ranjan Das Munshi successfully stalled a move to cancel 

 the voting rights of the states which have failed to conduct 

 their state league and other activities in a satisfactory 

 manner. While some members were willing to add this clause 

 strongly in the constitution, Das Munshi intervened to keep 

 it pending for a few more days.

 Instead, the AIFF president formed 

 a five-member committee, who have been asked to look into 

 the matter and submit a report in this regard. The committee 

 members are ? CR Vishwanathan (Tamil Nadu), Subrata Dutta 

 (IFA), Savio Messias (Goa) and representatives from Maharashtra 

 and Uttar Pradesh.

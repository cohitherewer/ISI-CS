Guwahati: For the second day running, posters and banners in support of Sourav Ganguly were seen across the stadium. 

A section of the crowd, in Gallery No. 10 of the Nehru Stadium, voiced their disregard for Greg Chappell as soon as they sighted him. The India coach had stepped on to the ground to get a feel of the soggy and slippery conditions. 

Just as he was walking past the gallery, the fans of the former Indian captain unfurled a banner that screamed Go back Chappell, bring back Ganguly. Not content, they started yelling at him. Chief selector Kiran More was also not spared. 

Chappell swiftly retreated and walked into the pavilion. 

We respect Chappell for what he has been doing for the improvement of the team, but we are really unhappy with him for the manner in which he handled the Sourav affair, said a Sourav fan. 

The last time India featured in a one-dayer here was against Zimbabwe on March 19, 2003. 

Sourav was then the captain and John Wright the coach. Both were missing this time round, for reasons as different as chalk and cheese. 

Saturday, too, banners prominently displaying the faces of Sourav and Chappell said, Go back Chappell, bring back Sourav. 

The India coach also had to face the wrath of fans who had parked themselves outside the team hotel whenever they caught sight of him. 

There was another banner, also involving the former India captain, which took a subtle dig at the selectors. It simply stated Kaif, Ganguly needs you.

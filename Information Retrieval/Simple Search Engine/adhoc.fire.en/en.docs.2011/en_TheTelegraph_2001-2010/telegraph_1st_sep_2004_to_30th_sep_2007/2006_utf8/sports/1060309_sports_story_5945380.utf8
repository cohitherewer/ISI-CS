 Pawar bats for Sourav again

Mohali: BCCI president Sharad Pawar had more words of encouragement for former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly. 

If someone says that Souravs future is dark, I am not going to believe him, Pawar said here on the eve of the second Test. The BCCI chief had said something similar (nobody can stop Sourav from returning to the team) during the first Test in Nagpur. 

Kiran More said recently that Sourav wasnt picked because the selection committee didnt want to look back. 

Sourav is a senior cricketer and the decision to retire is his prerogative. He has every right to show his mettle, Pawar said, adding that he had been omitted with the best interests of the team in mind. (PTI)

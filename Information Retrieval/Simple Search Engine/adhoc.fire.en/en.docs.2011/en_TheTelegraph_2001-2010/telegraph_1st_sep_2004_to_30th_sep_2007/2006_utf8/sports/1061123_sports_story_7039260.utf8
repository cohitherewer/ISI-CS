 Indians hope for team title

 WOMEN'S WORLD BOXING

New Delhi: Debutant Negisatty Usha created a flutter on Wednesday by ousting world champion Michaela Cijevschi of Romania in the 57kg. while the two-time champion MC Merykom moved closer to her third title in the 46kg as five Indians romped into the finals in fourth World Women Boxing Championships here. 

L. Sarita Devi, bronze medallist in 54kg, outclassed Egypts Samiha Ali Hassan, last years bronze medallist, in their last-four stage contest of 52kg at the Talkatora Indoor Stadium. 

Of the eight Indians in contention, five moved into the title rounds raising their hopes of clinching the team title in all probability while three pugilists, who lost on Wednesday, will return with bronze medals. 

Pugilists from Russia, Ukraine and North Korea, however, could pose some competition for the hosts. 

Usha, who previously defeated bronze medallist and Pan-American champion Sandra Bizier of Canada and European champion Ingrid Egner of Norway, caused her third consecutive major upset in the competition by outboxing the Romanian champion 15-10. 

The Kerala boxer took an early lead but Michaela geared up to be level 4-4 at the end of the first round of the bout. 

Usha now took initiative and managed a narrow advantage with her side-stepping counters to be 7-5 ahead. 

Her sharp attacking punches combined with counterattacks helped her romp home. (PTI)

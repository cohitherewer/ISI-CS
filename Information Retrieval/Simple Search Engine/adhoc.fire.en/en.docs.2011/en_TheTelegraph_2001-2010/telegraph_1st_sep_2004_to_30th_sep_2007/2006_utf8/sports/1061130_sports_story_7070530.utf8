Port Elizabeth: Under-fire India put up a spirited bowling performance to restrict South Africa to a competitive 243 for eight in the fourth one-dayer here Wednesday. 

 India were staring at another defeat, having been 

 reduced to 128 for seven after 28.2 overs. Irfan Pathan 

 (34) and Zaheer Khan (0) were at the crease. Makhaya Ntini 

 took two wickets. The batsmen dismissed were Wasim Jaffer 

 (10), Virender Sehwag (18), Sachin Tendulkar (1), Mohammed 

 Kaif (10), Dinesh Karthik (17), Mahendra Singh Dhoni (26) 

 and Ajit Agarkar (6). 

After Zaheer Khan (one for 38) and Sreesanth (one for 29) did the early damage, veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble (two for 42) kept it tight in the middle to lead Indias fight back following huge losses in the previous two matches. 

But the visitors lacked the killer punch and South Africa once again plundered runs in the closing overs in the day-night game at St Georges Park. 

Herschelle Gibbs (93 not out) led the middle-order recovery after South Africa were reduced to 93 for four while Jacques Kallis (49) and Shaun Pollock (37) chipped in with useful knocks. 

The hosts were in troughs at 6 for 2, 93 for 4 and later at 155 for 6, but Gibbs stood rock-solid amid all the mayhem. Gibbs had useful stands of 71, 61 and 60 for the third, fifth and seventh wickets with Kallis, Mark Boucher (29) and Pollock in an otherwise ordinary display by the hosts. 

Gibbs had a lucky reprieve in the eighth over when he was caught off a no-ball at 23 for 2, and he himself on a mere 2 runs. His knock came off 123 balls and included eight fours. 

The innings was rocked early with Zaheer removing Graeme Smith for the third time in the first over without scoring. Sreesanth then rammed in a yorker which hit the base of Loots Bosman (0) stumps to leave the hosts gasping for 6 for 2 in the fourth over. 

Things took a turn for the better with Kallis looking in impregnable form, striking several offside fours before the introduction of Kumble once again set them back. 

Kallis attempted a cut off the first delivery and was caught behind for 49 from 62 deliveries with five fours. 

Kumble was to strike again soon when he foxed AB De Villiers with a googly which the batsman attempted to guide around the corner. 

Kumbles joy was palpable since the batsman had struck him for a massive six in the same over. 

The host innings was once again put on the rails by the Gibbs-Boucher stand before Virender Sehwags part-time spin earned a leg before verdict. Bouchers 29 came off 49 balls and included two fours. 

The Indians joy knew no bounds after last games hero Justin Kemp fell to Sachin Tendulkar off the first delivery he faced, guiding a catch to Sehwag at point. 

Gibbs and Pollock once again put the innings on the rails with some sensible batting before the latter ran himself out for the second game in running. 

Pollock took off after stroking a delivery to midwicket, and then changed his mind, but by then it was too late.

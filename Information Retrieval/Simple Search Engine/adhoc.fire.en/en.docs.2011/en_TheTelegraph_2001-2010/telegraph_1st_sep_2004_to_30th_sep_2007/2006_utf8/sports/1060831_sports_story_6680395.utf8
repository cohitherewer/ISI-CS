 - Rolling camp looking at personal needs: Greg

Bangalore: The individual-centric rolling camp for Indian cricketers ahead of next months tri-series commenced on Wednesday with coach Greg Chappell focusing on making the players prepare better to face tall bowlers. 

A bowling machine has been installed at the Karnataka State Cricket Association ground here and the former Australian captain made no secret of his intention to see that the Team India players faced tall quicks better, though he did not name the pacers he had on his mind. 

Asked if there would be innovative measures at this camp, Chappell pointed to putting in place a bowling machine on the ground. 

There are certain teams around the world that have got tall fast bowlers and we have got to try and simulate as much as possible...The sort of teams we expect to see in the next few months in various tournaments, he said. 

India will play in the tri-series, also involving Australia and the West Indies, in Malaysia next month, which would be followed by the Champions Trophy at home before proceeding for a full-fledged South African tour. 

Chappell said the rolling camp is aimed at addressing the individual needs of the players. 

Noting that while the two camps prior to the (aborted) tri-series in Sri Lanka was about leadership and team development and the group itself, the current one is more about developing individual skills. 

So, its looking at their personal needs ... Looking at how by making them better we can help make the team better, he said. We will talk about the particular needs ... What areas we think they need to work and what areas they think they need to work. Thats what we are going to work on in the next few days. 

Chappell also said this camp was also an attempt to give the players as much variety as possible. If we are doing the same thing day in and day out, we are neither probably going to go forward very much as a group nor as individuals. 

Some part-time bowlers need to develop their batting, and efforts would be made in this direction at the camp, he said. 

Asked about the yardstick for putting players in three groups with senior players slated to take part in the last phase, Chappell said nothing should be read into it. 

Who is in which camp depended on their availability, he said. 

Some of the senior players have commitments with functions in Mumbai (clashing with dates of the first two phases of the camp). 

Asked if there are any special plans for Sachin Tendulkar, Chappell said: There will be some specific things. But they wont be different from what he has done in the past ... They wont be very different from what most of the guys will be doing. 

Asked if Tendulkar is fit, Chappell said: He is fit to play. Thats the important thing. 

On Anil Kumble who cut short his Surrey County stint and returned home earlier this month after being diagnosed with tendonitis in his right shoulder Chappell said the ace leg-spinner needs some rehabilitation but hes much improved. For the Malaysia tri-series, I dont expect him to be considered for selection. We would expect him to be fit very soon. So, its not a long term problem as I understand it. 

Meanwhile, the first set of five players vice-captain Virender Sehwag, replacing Ramesh Powar who could not make it due to personal reasons, Ajit Agarkar, Yuvraj Singh, Mohammed Kaif and Irfan Pathan began training on Wednesday.

 Samresh hopes to seal Olympic berth

 Shooting

 New Delhi: Commonwealth 

 Games hero Samresh Jung has now set his sights on the 2008 

 Beijing Olympics and aims to seal his quota berth for the 

 mega event before the end of this month.

 The next opportunity for 

 securing the Olympic spot will come in the World Cup in 

 Brazil later this month and I am looking forward to achieving 

 it, Jung said.

 The first chance to make it to 

 Beijing came at the ISSF shooting World Cup in Guangzhou, 

 China, but Gagan Narang was the only Indian marksman to 

 grab a berth there.

 I am able to touch the required 

 marks in training even now but need to do so when it really 

 matters, he said. Once I get the quota berth, 

 I will be able to concentrate solely on my shooting.

 Manavjit in final

 Meanwhile, Manavjit Singh Sandhu 

 qualified for the finals of the mens trap event with 

 a total of 48 out of 50 at the ISSF World Cup shooting in 

 Qingyuan on Tuesday.

 Birendeep Sodhi finished a distant 

 25th, while Anwer Sultan was way behind with a 45.

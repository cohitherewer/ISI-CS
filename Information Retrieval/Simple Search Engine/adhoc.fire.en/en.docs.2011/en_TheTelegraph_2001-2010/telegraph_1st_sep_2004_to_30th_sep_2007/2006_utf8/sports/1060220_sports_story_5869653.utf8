 Clement beats Ancic to title

Marseille: Frenchman Arnaud Clement claimed his most treasured title when he beat Croatias Mario Ancic 6-4, 6-2 to win the Marseille Open on Sunday. 

Wildcard Clement needed little more than 90 minutes to tame the world number 21 and win his first ATP title for three years. Its the event I wanted to win most, said Clement who was runner-up here in 1999 to compatriot Fabrice Santoro. 

This was a dream week, one of the best in my whole career. Its good to win again after two tough years, said the local boy from nearby Aix-en-Provence. It was quite a long time since I have played at such a level. I could not ask for anything else. 

The Frenchman, ranked 67th in the world, confirmed he was back to his best when he toppled world No.2 Rafael Nadal in the semi-final on Saturday. (Reuters)

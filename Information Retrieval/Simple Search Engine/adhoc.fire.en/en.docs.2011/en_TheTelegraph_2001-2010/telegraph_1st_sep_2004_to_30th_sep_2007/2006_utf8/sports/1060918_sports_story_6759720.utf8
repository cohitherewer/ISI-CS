The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Aloke rues missed chances

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Calcutta Port Trust coach Aloke Mukherjee suffered a fit after his teams 1-1 draw with Mohammedan Sporting on Sunday, but was quick to recover, ruing missed chances and alleging that the referee once again denied his players a deserved victory. 

According to the former India left-back, it was the heat and tension of surviving the CFL Premier Division, which conspired together to have him felled to the ground soon after the match got over. 

I was not feeling well in the heat. I collapsed but I was conscious It was nothing serious, Mukherjee said after receiving first-aid treatment on the ground. He, however, was quick to point out that the referees wont make him breathe easy in the ongoing tournament. 

Like in the Mohun Bagan match, we again suffered at the hands of the referee (Pradip Mukherjee). Its beyond me why he didnt award us a penalty when Felix was brought down (by A. Firoz in the 60th minute). Perhaps the referees are out to ensure that a small team cant dream big and our job is only to survive relegation, the Port Trust coach remarked. 

Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick, however, felt that his side could have finished the match much earlier. We missed too many chances, he said, ruing that the team was lacking a play-maker.

Calcutta: India, under Bob Houghton, are set to get down to real business from Thursday as far as their AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia is concerned. 

Ever since the national camp got underway at the SAI, Eastern Centre, last Saturday, the British coach has been stressing on situational play during practice in the afternoon and video analysis of the Vancouver meet in the morning. 

Nowhere in his scheme of things has the World Cup-playing nation featured as the predominant factor. 

Come Thursday, his focus is going to shift towards the August 16s opponents at the Salt Lake Stadium. For, Houghton is set to discuss with his wards Saudi Arabias strengths and weaknesses and what strategy his team will be adopting against them. 

The coach is yet to discuss his strategy against Saudi Arabia with us May be that exercise will start tomorrow, Mehrajuddin Wadao said on Wednesday. 

The Mohun Bagan defender, who has been made to play in midfield by Houghton, is relishing the new role. 

Your role as a player varies from coach to coach. In club football, the coach (Biswajit Bhattacharya) has some plans with me and the situation is different here. But Im enjoying my role as a midfielder Your mobility gets sharper as sometimes you get down to defend and move up as an attacking reinforcement, he said. 

On Wednesday, Houghtons focus on getting the players in right shape was highlighted by goalbound shots from distance and players switching flanks at will. 

The coach actually wants us to get familiar with various situations. It also helps in creating a bond, Mehrajuddin pointed out. 

If the Mohun Bagan player is part of the midfield in Houghtons likely 4-4-2 formation, Manjit Singh has his place fixed in the attacking third. 

The former JCT and Mohun Bagan player is yet sign for a club. On being asked whether he finds it odd that he is in the national camp and yet no club has shown interest in him, Manjit said: Im going to sign for a club in October when the second transfer window will open. 

Almost nonchalantly, without revealing if his destination will be Bengal or Punjab.

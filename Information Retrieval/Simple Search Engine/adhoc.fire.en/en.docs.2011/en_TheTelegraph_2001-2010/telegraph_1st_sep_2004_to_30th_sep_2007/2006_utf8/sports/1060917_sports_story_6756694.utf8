 Lifes looking up for Sunitha Rao

Calcutta: Life seems to be looking up for the US-born Sunitha Rao. 

For one, she has applied to play for India again (after an aborted attempt two years back) and is hopeful of it coming through shortly. Then, she has entered into an agreement with Globosport which will manage her career from now on. 

In Calcutta for the WTA Sunfeast Open in which she has got a wild card the 221st-ranked Sunitha is all excited at the idea of playing for India and looking forward to participating in the Fed Cup. In which case, she is likely to be the third-ranked Indian, after Sania Mirza (world No. 70) and Shikha (No. 194). How does that appeal? Feels great, grinned the five-foot-seven dusky beauty. 

The decision to apply to play for India a second time was taken in July, but she put in a formal application to the AITA only last week. 

The AITA clearance should come by the end of the year and by January 2007, Sunitha should be playing for India. The United States Tennis Association has already been informed to this effect, said Globosports Anirban Das Blah. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, the companys managing director, said in a statement: Globosport is happy to announce that Sunitha has agreed to partner us. Sunitha is an exciting player who has the potential to scale great heights. 

The early part of the year had been tough for her, being laid low by an injury in February which continued till the French Open. It wasnt a major injury. In February, I took a week off to settle it, said Sunitha. 

But it kept recurring and forced her out the game for several months. But now shes feeling on top of the world and raring to take on Nicole Pratt in the first round here. 

Which is not surprising, considering that she now has three-pronged assistance Tejas Patel, an US-based philanthropist of India origin will be her co-sponsor, Bhupathi will do her tennis planning while the company will look after her endorsements, sponsorships and overall management. 

Little wonder then that the drop in rankings has failed to dampen her spirits. 

Well, rankings going up and down is a part of tennis. Sanias ranking has dropped and so too Shikhas. But then, you never know, my rankings may well be up by next week, she said. 

So its target 150 in singles and 100 in doubles by the end of next season for the 21-year-old. 

Carry on Sunitha, India is waiting.

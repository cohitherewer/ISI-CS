 India should play three openers: Gavaskar

Mumbai: Sunil Gavaskar Monday said India should play with three openers in order to tackle the new-ball attack of Pakistan in the upcoming three-Test series. 

The former India captain also said India looked the better of the two sides and they should succeed in the series, beginning in Lahore on Friday. I would like to believe we have a good batting as well as a bowling line-up and I would like to suggest that we should play three openers, he told reporters. 

Gavaskar also dismissed the suggestion that Pakistan had prepared tracks to suit the pace bowlers. 

The tracks in the sub continent are the same. In fact it would suit the Indian bowlers since they may be green on the top but are soft underneath. These are unlike pitches in Australia where they have greentops but are hard below, he said. 

Gavaskar said the series would be exciting since India and Pakistan had performed well in their recent rubbers at home. While India beat Sri Lanka, Pakistan beat England. So both teams look good, he said.

 Mahindra pip Dempo 4-3

 Barreto scored the third goal for Mahindra 

Margao: Mahindra United pipped defending champions Dempo SC 4-3 in a National Football League match played at the Nehru Stadium Fatorda on Tuesday. 

While Barretos goal made it 3-3 for Mahindra, Yusif Yakubu scored the winner to seal the fate of the match. 

Mahindra were held by Mohun Bagan in a barren draw in their opening match of the 10th at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. That was a sheer bad luck for Mahindra as Mohun Bagan goalie Subrata Pal put up valiant show under the bar helping his side snatching a point from the Mumbai outfit. 

After this, Salgaocar SC of Goa are chart leaders with four points followed by East Bengal also with four points. 

Meanwhile, Federation Cup runners-up Sporting Clube-de-Goa hold an edge over Air India when they face each other at the same venue on Wednesday. 

Sporting, who have two points from as many matches, have dominated both the encounters but have failed to score goals despite creating several chances. 

Striker Edeh Chidi, the man of the match against JCT, has combined well upfront with Dudu Omagbemi. 

But Chidi has failed to find the net regularly which has been the main worry for Sporting, who will be trying to register their first victory in their NFL campaign. 

Their midfield has been functioning well as a unit with Bebiano Fernandes playing a vital role in spearheading the attacks. Keeper Luis Baretto too has played his role well under the bar but it is the defence that looks fragile under pressure. 

Sportings vast experience and rich talent at their disposal make them overwhelming favourites against Air India, who could pose problems for the rival defence. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukuwama said: We have not gained full points and on Wednesday we are determined to go all out for victory after two draws.

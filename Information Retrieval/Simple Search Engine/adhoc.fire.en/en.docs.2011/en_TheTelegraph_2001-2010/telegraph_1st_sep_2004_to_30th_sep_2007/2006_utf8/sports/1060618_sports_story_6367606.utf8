 SoS for Atkinson 

St Kitts: West Indian captain Brian Laras cry for home advantage was partially met when well-known curator Andy Atkinson was flown in to help prepare a lively track for the third Test, starting here next Thursday. 

Well, this one wouldnt have too much of grass but there would be plenty of life otherwise, said Atkinson, ICCs pitch consultant, who responded to the call of Ricky Skeritt ? presently sports minister of this island but who has been manager of West Indian teams in the past. 

The trouble is, captains request for a lively wicket but the moment the ball starts flying around their ears, they go out and slam curators, he said.

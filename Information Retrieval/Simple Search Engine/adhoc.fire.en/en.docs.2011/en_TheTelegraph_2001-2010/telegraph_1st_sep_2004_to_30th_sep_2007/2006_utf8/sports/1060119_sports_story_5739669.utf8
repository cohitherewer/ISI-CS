 Anand in joint lead after draw

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Viswanathan Anand was held, but Koneru Humpy brought cheer to the Indian camp with a convincing victory over Kateryna Lahno of Ukraine in the fourth round of the Corus International Chess Tournament underway here. 

Anand took it easy as black against Sokolov in a game lasting just 15 moves. The Dutchman was also content with half a point despite playing white. 

As a result of the tame draw, Veselin Topalov joined Anand in the lead with another sparkling victory over Loek van Wely of the Netherlands. 

The category-19 event is being played here on a round robin basis. 

Anand was a bit subdued against Sokolov who played the white side of a queens gambit. But the Indian was never in trouble, and soon after the opening got over there was little doubt that a draw was a just result. 

Meanwhile in the B group being played simultaneously, Koneru Humpy registered her second victory in the event, accounting for Lahno. Humpy, thus, took her tally to 2.5 points out of a possible 4. 

Playing white, she gave little chance to her younger opponent in the queens gambit and won after 41 moves.

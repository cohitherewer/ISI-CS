 Rahil Gangjee tied 13th 

 - INDONESIAN OPEN 

Jakarta: Rahil Gangjee, battling a sprained wrist, carded a 69 to lie tied 13th after the first round of the $1 million HSBC Indonesia Open here on Thursday. 

Gangjee, 28, sustained the injury during his practice prior to the pro-am on Wednesday, but nevertheless managed to produce some gutsy golf. He was four under for the first five holes and then played steady golf for pars in the tournament jointly sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours. 

Meanwhile, Thai star Thongchai Jaidee struck an impressive six-under-par 66 for the joint first round lead. Jaidee, who finished second in Malaysia two weeks ago, is tied alongside Chinese Taipeis veteran Wang Ter-Chang, Englishman Simon Dyson and David Higgins of Ireland at the Emeralda Golf Club here. 

Jyoti Randhawa and Gaurav Ghei shot rounds of one-under 71 each for tied 36th place, while Jeev Milkha Singh and Shiv Kapur overcame bad starts to card even par 72 each and were in tied 56th place. 

Amandeep Johl shot a two-over 74, and Harmeet Kahlon brought in a for-over 76. 

I was doing well and was four under without dropping a shot until the 17th hole where I struck my only bogey. My wrist (injury) took a toll on my performance, said Gangjee. I had to cut down on my wrist action. Im happy but I have to avoid the roughs for a better result. (PTI)

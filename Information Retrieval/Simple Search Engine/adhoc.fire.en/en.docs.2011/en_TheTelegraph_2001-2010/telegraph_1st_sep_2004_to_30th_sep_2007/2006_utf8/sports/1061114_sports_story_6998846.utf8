 Powell, Richards years best

 - Top performance awards for Liu, Defar 

 Sanya Richards of the US and Asafa Powell of Jamaica with their trophies in Monte Carlo on Sunday 

Monaco: Sprinters Asafa Powell of Jamaica and Sanya Richards of the US were named the IAAFs Athletes of the Year on Sunday. Both get $100,000 each. 

Powell, 23, twice equalled the world 100m record of 9.77 seconds he set last year. He won 16 races and a share of the $1 million IAAF Golden League Jackpot after winning all six races in Golden League competitions. 

Last year I wanted to win this title but I didnt because I got injured, Powell said. 

Im thankful to get this award. It is a major accomplishment to realise that people recognise the hard work that I put in the sport and they actually vote for me. 

Having set the world record in June 2005 in Athens, Powell equalled it in June at the British Grand Prix in Gateshead, and again in August at the Weltklasse in Zurich. 

Zurich is definitely the best memory of my 2006 season. Its a race that I wont forget, Powell said. 

Brussels is also another good moment... It would have been another world record if I hadnt had such a bad start. 

Powell timed 9.99 at Brus- sels Van Damme Memorial in August. 

 Maybe that was the fastest I have ever run over the last 90 metres, he said at the time. Richards, 21, was undefeated over 400m outdoors and also captured a $250,000 share of the Golden League Jackpot. 

She won 13 races, including the years five fastest performances capped by an American record of 48.70 at the World Cup in Athens in September. 

The previous record of 48.83 was set by Valerie Brisco at the 1984 Olympic Games, six months before Richards was born. Her performance was the fastest in the world since the 1996 Olympic Games. 

Two world record breakers were given awards for Performances of the Year. Liu Xiang of China clocked 12.88 seconds in the 110m hurdles in Lausanne and Meseret Defar of Ethiopia ran 14 minutes 24.53 seconds over 5,000m in New York City.

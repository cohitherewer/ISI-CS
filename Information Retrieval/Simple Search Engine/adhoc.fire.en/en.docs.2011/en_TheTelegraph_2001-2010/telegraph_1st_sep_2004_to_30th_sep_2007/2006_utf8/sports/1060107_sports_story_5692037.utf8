 Negi Indias youngest GM-norm holder

 Negi 

Hastings: Parimarjan Negi created history by becoming the youngest Indian to get a Grandmaster norm after drawing with GM Yuriy Kuzubov of Ukraine in the ninth and penultimate round of the Hastings International Chess congress here. 

Negi, who became an International Master earlier in this event, took another step forward after drawing with GM Kuzubov to get his first nine-game norm here. 

As per fide stipulations, the total number of norm games should be 24 in case there is a norm made in round-robin (all-play-all) event and 27 in case all norms are made in Swiss events like here. 

Meanwhile, Valerij Neverov of Ukraine took sole lead after defeating GM Sergey Erenburg of Israel. With a black piece victory, Valerij practically assured himself of the title with 7.5 points. 

GM Merab Gagunashvili of Georgia and Milos Pavlovic of Serbia are half a point behind while four players share the next spot with 6.5 points each. 

Negi on six points, is in the next group of nine players and will meet top seed GM Vladimir Belov of Russia in the last round. 

Negi was definitely aided by luck in the game against Kuzubov. 

Playing the white side of a Nazdorf Sicilian, Negi declared his peaceful intentions by offering a draw as early as on move eight. 

Kuzubov, however, had other plans as he promptly refused the offer and nonchalantly carried on to get an easy game in the Fischer Sozin variation, Negis pet move for a long time now. 

In the middle game, Negi got into trouble after his bishop was saddled with the task of only defending his own pawns and that problem persisted with Negi for the rest of the game. 

Kuzubov displayed immaculate technique for the major part of the game to get a nearly won position but in the end Negis perseverance paid dividends as the Ukrainian erred to let the game drift to a draw. The marathon game lasted 86 moves and close to seven hours.

 Mauresmo beats Hingis, in semis

 WTA championship 

 Amelie Mauresmo serves to Martina Hingis in Madrid. The world No. 1 won 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. 

Madrid: Justine Henin-Hardenne secured a place in the semi-finals of the WTA Championships (as reported in Fridays Late City edition) and remained on course to claim the year-end No. 1 spot with a 6-4, 6-4 win over Russias Nadia Petrova on Thursday. 

The French Open champions victory means that the in-form Maria Sharapova will now have to win the tournament and hope the Belgian does not make the final if she is to deprive her of ending the year as No. 1. 

Its a great feeling to qualify for the semis, the Belgian said after the match. I missed the last two editions because of injury and Im back after a few weeks off so its great to be back at the top of the tree. 

Im not going to change my goal which remains to win every match and get into the final and not worry about being No.1. 

Defending champion Amelie Mauresmo, who lost her opening match to Petrova, got back on track when she battled her way from a set down to beat Martina Hingis 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 in an enthralling encounter in the Yellow Group. 

The Frenchwoman will join Henin-Hardenne in the semis if she beats the Belgian in her final round-robin match on Friday, but defeat will mean that Hingis progresses to the last four. Petrova is out no matter what happens. 

Kim Clijsters bounced back from an opening defeat against Sharapova to blow away Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-1, 6-1 in just 45 minutes and give herself a strong chance of making the semis in the Red Group. 

I got a few early breaks and that gave me the confidence to carry on, said the Belgian who made a winning return to action after two months out in Hasselt last weekend. (Reuters)

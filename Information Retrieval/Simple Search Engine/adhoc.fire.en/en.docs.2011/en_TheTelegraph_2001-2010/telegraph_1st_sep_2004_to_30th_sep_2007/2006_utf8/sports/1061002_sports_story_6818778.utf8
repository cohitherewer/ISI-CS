 Solskjaer brace puts United on top

London: Manchester United went back to the top of the Premier League with an Old Trafford demolition job on Newcastle United on Sunday that should have brought them more than two Ole Gunnar Solskjaer goals. 

The Norwegian converted close-range efforts either side of half-time as United won 2-0 to move to 16 points and above Chelsea on goal difference following the champions 1-1 home draw with Aston Villa on Saturday. 

Bolton Wanderers are third on 14 points after their 2-0 home win over Liverpool on Saturday. 

In Sundays other games, Reading won 1-0 at West Ham United, and Blackburn Rovers beat Wigan Athletic 2-1. 

Manchester United, who lost to Arsenal and drew with Reading in their previous two games after winning the first four, were quickly into their stride on Sunday, though they had to wait until four minutes before half-time to get on the scoresheet. 

Cristiano Ronaldo fired a shot against a post and Solskjaer was on hand to knock in the rebound. 

Four minutes after half-time Solskjaer got his second when he diverted a Nemanja Vidic shot beyond Steve Harper. United had already hit a post through Darren Fletcher and Ronaldo rattled the bar with another powerful run and shot as Newcastle fell apart.

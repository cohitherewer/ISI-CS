 PLAYER OF THE DAY

 MIROSLAV KLOSE 

For Poland, to see Miroslav Klose scoring a brace for Germany in the opener against Costa Rica, must have come as a frustration. Klose, whose mother Barbara represented Poland 85 times in handball, was first approached to play for Poland, but the Werder Bremen striker declined. 

Like in 2002, when he scored five goals including a hattrick, Klose became an instant hit once again. With the pressure from the home crowd tangible and audible, things were not going in the German way after a gallant Paulo Wanchope neutralised the early German lead. Klose not only put the hosts back in the lead when he rolled the ball into an unguarded net after Bastian Schweinsteiger shot into his path, but also gave a breathing space to his team with a superb strike in the 61st minute. He just looped the ball into the net after his initial header was saved. 

Miro, as Klose is popularly known, has little of everything. He is good in the air, strong in tackle, and has pace. Born with a certain guile, Klose also likes to dribble the ball and is known for celebrating his goals in his salto style, the German word for flip-flop.

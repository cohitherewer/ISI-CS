 Abbas contract not renewed

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board has not renewed former Test captain Zaheer Abbas contract as the national team manager and replaced him with Talat Ali for the Champions Trophy in India. Zaheer was manager on Pakistans tour of England. 

Javed Miandad has criticised the decision saying such a step suggested that Zaheer was to be held responsible for The Oval Test fiasco. The appointment of Talat follows a difference of opinion between PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf. (PTI)

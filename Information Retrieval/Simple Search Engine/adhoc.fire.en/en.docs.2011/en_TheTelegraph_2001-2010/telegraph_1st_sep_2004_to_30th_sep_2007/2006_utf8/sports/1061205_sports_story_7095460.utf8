 Rain threat over 1st ODI

Rawalpindi: Torrential rain threatens the first of game of the five-match one-day series between Pakistan and the West Indies scheduled for Tuesday. 

Heavy rain continued to lash the city, leaving the Rawalpindi ground waterlogged. The organisers have been working hard to keep the pitch fit for play in the day-night fixture. 

Pakistan, who clinched the three-Test series 2-0, expect a tough fight from the tourists, who have produced better results in the shorter version of the game. 

We are quite capable of separating the two (one-days and Tests). Performances in the Tests still leave a lot to be desired but we are on the up-and-up in the one-day arena, said Lara, whose team will also play four one-day matches in India in mid-January. 

The tourists will miss star batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan and allrounder Dwayne Bravo in the ODIs. 

Unfortunately we wont have a full squad, Sarwan has a hairline fracture and hes one of our main players in the one-day game. (AFP)

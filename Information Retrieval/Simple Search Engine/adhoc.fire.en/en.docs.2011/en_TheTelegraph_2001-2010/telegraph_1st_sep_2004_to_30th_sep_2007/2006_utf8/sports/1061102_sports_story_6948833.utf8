 Pitch not to make a difference: Lara

 - Top order must be more consistent: Smith

Jaipur: Low scores and wobbly pitches have been the story of the Champions Trophy so far. But that doesnt really bother master batsman Brian Lara. Brimming with confidence, the West Indies skipper looked unperturbed by the fact that the Sawai Man Singh Stadium pitch has been more helpful to bowlers than batsmen in this tournament so far. 

While South African skipper Graeme Smith said the pitch could make batting difficult after a few overs, Lara didnt want an extended conversation on the state of the 22-yard. The pitch is good and I think it would be a good place to play, he said. On this pitch, Bangladesh had a good start. England had a good start against Australia. They squandered it. 

According to Lara, the pitch wont matter. The better team will win. At the end, who bats first and bowls second wont matter, he said. 

Reacting to a suggestion that it could turn out to be grudge outing against South Africa on Thursday, Lara said he had no such feeling at the moment. South Africans are a higher-ranked team. Naturally they will start favourites. But we have dissected our opponents well and we will be all focussed to make our second final in a row. 

Graeme Smith, on the other hand, was more cautious with words. He said that the West Indies have quite a few matchwinners. We have to be focused. The West Indies have beaten us twice before, in the Champions Trophy and the World Cup. After all, they have a young side. 

Smith said his top-order batsmen have to be more consistent. Describing the pitch as a dry one, Smith said there could be a few ups and downs. It may swing for a few overs. Things could be difficult after the ball gets softer.

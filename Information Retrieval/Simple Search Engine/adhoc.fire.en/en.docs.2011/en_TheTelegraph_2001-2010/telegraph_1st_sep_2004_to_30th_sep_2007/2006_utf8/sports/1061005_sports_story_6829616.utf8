 Jayasuriya eyes something special

 - Champions trophy 

 Sanath Jayasuriya

New Delhi: Having recovered full fitness, Sanath Jayasuriya is determined to make his presence felt in the Champions Trophy, saying he wants to achieve something special for his country. 

I am completely fit and confident of doing well. I have to do well. I have to achieve something special for my country, said a determined Jayasuriya. 

The veteran batsman, who was struggling with injuries as well as loss of form, had announced retirement early this year but came out of it for the one-day series against England where he was instrumental in Sri Lankas 5-0 win in the one-day series. He scored 322 runs with two centuries against England. 

There are no fitness problems. My confidence is back after the England tour. Now I want to play well in this tournament. I have always played my natural game and tried to win matches for my country, said the 37-year-old batsman. 

Despite being former joint winners with India, playing qualifying was not an issue with Jayasuriya and he said his team would not take chances against any country. 

But first we have to do well in the qualifying round. We cannot take chances against any team, said Jayasuriya, who became only the fourth batsman to score 10,000 runs in one-day cricket. 

The former Lanka captain said he was satisfied with the teams performance of late and praised the middle order batsmen for the improved show. 

I am happy with what we are doing. Especially our middle order batsmen are improving, he said. 

However, he refused to name anyone as a key player and said cricket is a team game and 4-5 players have to do well on a given day to win the match. We have a good chance, but first we have to qualify, he added. 

About his comeback from retirement, he diplomatically said selectors asked me to play and so I am playing.

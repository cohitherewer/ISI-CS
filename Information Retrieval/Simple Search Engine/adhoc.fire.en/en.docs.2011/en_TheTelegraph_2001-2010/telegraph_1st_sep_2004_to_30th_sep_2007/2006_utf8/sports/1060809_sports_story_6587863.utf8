 Hari seals title with draw

 -HUNGARY CHESS

 -Indian stands to gain crucial Elo rating points

 Harikrishna

 Paks: Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna claimed the third Marx Gyorgy International chess tournament title after settling for an easy draw with Hungarian GM Ferenc Berkes in the 10th and final round game here. 

After a forgettable show in the Aerosvit Grandmasters meet, the much-needed victory for Harikrishna came at an appropriate time as he stands to gain a few Elo rating points. 

From finishing last to winning this event, this has been a good turnaround for Harikrishna in a short span of time. For the record, the Indian ended with 6.5 points and was a full point adrift of nearest contender GM Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine, who finished sole second. 

The third place was shared by last years champion GM Zoltan Almasi of Hungary and Chinese GM Wang Yue, while Berkes finished fifth on 4.5 points. 

Peter Acs, another former world junior champion in the fray, finished last with 3.5 points in this category-15 double round robin tournament. 

Like so many other days in the event, the last round too failed to yield any decisive results with all the three games ending in a draws. 

Harikrishna won three games and drew the remaining seven while the highest number of decisive games was recorded by Almasi, who won two games and lost two against Harikrishna to end with a fifty per cent score. 

Efimenko won just one game and drew nine, with Berkes also sharing nine draws and losing one. 

Acs managed seven draws with three losses while Wang ended up with a victory and a loss. 

In the final round, Harikrishna had his task cut out and he achieved what he wanted without much ado. It was a Nimzo Indian Defence game wherein the Indian went for routine exchanges to get a balanced endgame. 

A timely pawn sacrifice by Harikrishna ended all hopes for Berkes. Draw was agreed to in just 28 moves. 

Wang tried hard to improve upon his tournament standing but did not succeed in breaking the solid defence of Almasi, who played black. 

Another Nimzo Indian of the day witnessed Wang exerting pressure in the centre and Almasi being pushed to the wall, as he had to sacrifice an exchange to stay in the game.

 Sixth one-dayer abandoned 

 West Indies vs Zimbabwe

 Port-of-Spain: Runako Mortons 

 century for the West Indies came to nothing against Zimbabwe 

 as afternoon rain forced the sixth one-day International 

 to be abandoned on Saturday.

 Mortons second one-day century 

 of 109 set up a West Indies total of 263 for six off 50 

 overs. Zimbabwes innings was twice interrupted by 

 showers and, left to chase a reduced Duckworth/Lewis target 

 of 191 off 30 overs, ended up stuck on 72 for two off 12.1 

 overs.

 Earlier, Morton lashed 12 fours 

 and a six and received sound support from Ramnaresh Sarwan 

 (54 off 62 balls) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (51 not out 

 off 44 balls).

 Zaheer blames it on PCB politics

Karachi: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas feels that his contract as team manager after the England series has not been extended owing to politics within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and not because of what happened during the infamous Oval Test. 

The reason my contract was not renewed (had) nothing to do with what happened at The Oval, its because (PCB director of operations) Saleem Altaf was totally against me and for no rhyme or reason, Abbas was quoted as saying in a daily newspaper on Monday. 

He had wanted to make Talat Ali manager for so long and he saw this as the right time to make the change. 

They try to say that I was on the phone when this ball issue was taking place but that was my job, I was there to help the media and that was what I was doing, Abbas said. 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram fears a punishment is on the cards for captain Inzamam-ul Haq. The former Pakistan allrounder said Inzamam would be made a scapegoat because of Pakistans history of ball-tampering despite a lack of evidence this time. 

The ICC cant do anything to the umpires. If they do, teams will try it on saying: were not happy, change the umpire, Akram said. 

But they will fine or ban Inzamam-ul Haq. Pakistan are being accused because we were giving a master-class in ball tampering and for 15 years nobody knew what we were doing, he was quoted as saying by an English tabloid.

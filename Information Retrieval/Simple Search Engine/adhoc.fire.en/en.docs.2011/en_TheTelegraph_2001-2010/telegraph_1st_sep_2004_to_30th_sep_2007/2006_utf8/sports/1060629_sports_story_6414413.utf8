 Sachin slips to No. 22

Dubai: Sachin Tendulkar slipped out of the top- 20 in Test rankings for the first time in 14 years, according to the latest LG ICC rankings released on Wednesday. 

 Tendulkar now lies in the 22 nd place, down three places, and the fall in his rankings has much to do with his missing the tour of West Indies due to a shoulder surgery. 

While missing the series in the Caribbean counts against Tendulkar, his performance in the Test form in the last couple of years has been well below his career peak, his world record 35th Test ton against Sri Lanka late last year notwithstanding. 

The batting maestro averages just 28 in his last 10 Tests compared to an overall average of 55.39. India still have two players in the top 20, with captain Rahul Dravid, who remains in second place behind leader Ricky Ponting, and Virender Sehwag, who is down one place to 13th in the latest. 

India also has two players in the top 20 Test bowlers list, with Anil Kumble slipping down one spot to eighth position and Irfan Pathan ranked 13th.

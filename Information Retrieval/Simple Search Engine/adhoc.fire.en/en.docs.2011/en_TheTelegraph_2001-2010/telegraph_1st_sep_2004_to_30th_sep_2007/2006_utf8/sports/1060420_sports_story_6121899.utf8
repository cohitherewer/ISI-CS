Chittagong: The second day of the second Test between Australia and Bangladesh belonged to Jason Gillespie (picture right). Day Three was even better for the birthday boy, as the tall Aussie fast bowler used the willow to set new standards in batting. 

On Wednesday, Gillespie surpassed Tony Manns world record score (105) as nightwatchman and went on to crack an unbeaten 201 before Ricky Ponting declared closed Australias first innings at 581 for four. 

I never expected it in my wildest dream... So its pretty surreal, pretty bizarre actually, said Gillespie. Nothings really changed. I suppose it will sink in over the next couple of days but I cant believe Im talking about my batting. Thats what I cant believe. 

It was not very easy, putting your head down and batting in the heat. I think I am developing into an all rounder, Gillespie said. (Reuters)

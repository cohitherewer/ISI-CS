The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chisty needs to be alert at the start 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Competition is going to be tough in the 1,400m Romantic Notes Cup, the main event on Wednesday, the penultimate fixture in the RCTC racing calendar. Trainer Daniel Davids ward Decameron is sure to start as a favourite but the five-year-old is a bad starter.

 In his last outing, the Storm Trooper-son could manage to recover the lost ground in a mile race to finish an impressive third. A slow start over the 1,400m trip may totally mar his winning chance. 

 Imran Chisty, who partners Decameron, may have to be equally alert on Sama-rrah.The horse had let down a large following with an equally tardy start. The Tejano-Soonerland filly is up against a formidable opposition in the 1,400m Phoebes Fire Handicap.

 The Dangerous Romance Cup may see a straight contest between Vijay Singhs Conqueror and Daniels Sights On Gold.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

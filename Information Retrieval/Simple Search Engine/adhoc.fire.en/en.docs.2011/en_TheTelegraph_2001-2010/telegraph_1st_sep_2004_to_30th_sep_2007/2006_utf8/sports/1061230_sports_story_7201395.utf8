The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rauf, Howell not amused

 - Arthur comments on on-field umpires 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 MICKEY ARTHUR 

Durban: South African coach Mickey Arthurs strong comments about the on-field umpires, Asad Rauf and Ian Howell, after stumps on Day III, havent been well received. 

Its not confirmed, but The Telegraphs sources have indicated both umpires (Howell is standing in for the indisposed Mark Benson) met Match Referee Roshan Mahanama to convey their displeasure. 

Besides questioning the umpires decision to come off even though the batsmen (captain Graeme Smith and AB De Villiers) had no problems continuing, Arthur had said stronger control was needed. 

Rauf and Howell had the right to act in the manner they did and the coach shouldnt have put a question mark over their competence. Apparently, the ball changes took time as they didnt have enough replacements to choose from! 

Its not clear how Mahanama, a former Sri Lankan one-day captain, has reacted. 

Benson, meanwhile, had been advised heart surgery some time back. For whatever reason, he put it off, a source pointed out. Fortunately, his wife and sons are in Durban, and that must be comforting.

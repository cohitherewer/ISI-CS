 Jeev: Its like a Christmas gift

 - Order of Merit crown caps dream year 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Hong Kong: Indias Jeev Milkha Singh wrapped up the Asian Tour Order of Merit title with a third-place finish at the Hong Kong Open on Sunday. 

Jeev has enjoyed an excellent season, ending a seven-year title drought with victory at the co-sanctioned China Open in April which he followed up with a surprise triumph at the European Tours Volvo Masters in Spain last month. 

Im very excited. Its like a Christmas gift to me now, Jeev said on Monday after securing his first Order of Merit title with a record total of $573,422 and one event still to play. 

This year has been excellent. Its like a dream year. With a tied third finish here and winning the Order of Merit, it is just perfect for me, he added. 

Jeev closed with a four-under-par 66 at the Hong Kong Golf Club to finish three shots behind winner Jose Manuel Lara of Spain on 12-under for the tournament. 

After struggling against a number of injuries in the past few seasons, the 34-year-old rode the momentum of his Beijing triumph in April to become just the third Asian player to win on European soil at Valderrama. 

I was glad that I proved something for myself with wins on the big stage, Singh added. 

 I won at Valderrama and that gave me a lot of trust and satisfaction. I personally feel that Asian players are good enough to win on any tour in the world right now. 

Singhs two victories elevated him to 16th place on the 2006 European Tour Order of Merit behind recently-crowned champion Padraig Harrington of Ireland. 

The Hong Kong finish also ensured that he broke the Asian Tours record for earnings in a season where he has accumulated $ 573,442, beating last years mark of $ 510,123 set by Thaworn Wiratchant of Thailand.

Madrid: Ronaldinho was in inspirational form as he returned to lead Barcelona to a 5-1 home victory over an unfortunate Real Betis in the Primera Liga on Saturday. 

The leaders now have 55 points and remain seven clear of second-placed Real Madrid who recorded their sixth consecutive league win by sweeping aside lowly Alaves 3-0 at the Bernabeu. 

Barcelonas Brazilian playmaker, who was suspended for the league defeats against Atletico Madrid and Valencia, played a part in Henrik Larssons opener and triggered Mellis own goal. 

Ronaldinho then went on to score two himself from free kicks but it was not all plain sailing for the home side who had keeper Victor Valdes to thank for a number of crucial saves. Joaquin pulled a goal back for Betis on the hour but Lionel Messi came off the bench to make it five with six minutes left. 

In a near repeat of the three goals Real Madrid scored in 10 minutes against Real Zaragoza in the Kings Cup in midweek, they stormed into an early lead at the Bernabeu. 

Guti opened the scoring in the sixth minute and Robinho added a second in the 11th, but they had to wait until the 77th before adding a third through Cicinho. 

Real captain Raul came on as a substitute in the second half to a standing ovation after three months out with a knee injury. 

Below them Javier Saviola scored the only goal as Sevilla beat visitors Celta Vigo 1-0 to climb above them to fifth on 41 points, two ahead of the Galicians. 

Villarreal cruised to a 4-0 home win over Espanyol to move up a spot to seventh with 38 points. 

Meanwhile, Serie A leaders Juventus were held 2-2 by Messina on Saturday, allowing second-placed AC Milan to claw back ground with a 1-0 win over Cagliari, add reports from Rome. 

Juventus now have 67 points from 26 matches, 10 points ahead of Milan. Third-placed Inter Milan are a further two points back after a 0-0 draw at Livorno. 

Having beaten Inter 2-1 last weekend, Juventus were not expected to be tested by Messina, who started the evening one point above the relegation zone. (Reuters)

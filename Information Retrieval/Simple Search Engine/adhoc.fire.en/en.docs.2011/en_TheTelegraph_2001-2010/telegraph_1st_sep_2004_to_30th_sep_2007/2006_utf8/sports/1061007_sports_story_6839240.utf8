 Pinki cruises to 400m gold

 - Soma, Sushmita make it 1-2 in heptathlon

New Delhi: Pinki Pramanik, representing Indian Railways, was the cynosure on the second day of the National Open athletic championships at the Nehru Stadium on Friday. She was expected to win the 400 metres, but hardly anyone expected her to clinch the gold with such consummate ease. 

The Bengal girl led from start to finish and at the end, she was a good 20m ahead of the pack. While Pinki clocked 53.06, Satti Geetha came a poor second with a time of 55.48. ONGCs Mandeep Kaur took the bronze (55.65). 

Later, Pinki admitted that a stronger field may have fetched her a better timing. I was expecting to do between 51 and 52 seconds, but it became too easy at the end. 

Two other Bengal girls once again fought it out in the heptathlon. At the end Soma Biswas took the gold with 5720 points and Susmita Singha Roy the silver with 5678 points. JJ Sobha, who like Soma and Susmita is representing Railways in this meet, gave a hot chase before taking the bronze (5586). 

Susmita was perhaps bit unlucky to miss the gold. She did well in the first five events before losing out on points to Soma in javelin. She did make some recovery in the 800 metres, but that was not enough to snatch the lead from Soma. 

The days only national record was created by another Railways girl, L Deepmala Devi, in the 20,000 metres walk. She clocked 1:39:30:5 to erase the previous mark set by Y Bala Devi (1:43:06:00) in Hyderabad in 2003. 

While A. Aravinda and Deepti Jose won the mens and womens 100 metres gold medals, respectively, Joseph Abraham was a rather surprise winner in the mens 400 metres. Known mainly as a hurdler, Abraham came up with a time of 46.70 to bag the gold. He was followed by Services Aboo Backer and Bhupinder Singh of ONGC.

 Bekele steals the show

 - World Indoor Meet

Moscow: Russia scooped five gold medals on the final day of the World Indoor Championships on Sunday, but Ethiopias Kenenisa Bekele stole the show, becoming the first person to win global titles on three surfaces. 

The hosts topped the final medals table with eight golds, matching their previous best showing, to the delight of the first near-capacity crowd of the three-day championships at the Olympiysky Stadium. 

The US finished second with seven golds, well clear of Ethiopia and Ukraine who both won two. 

World and Olympic 10,000m champion Bekele pulled away from 3,000m medal rivals Saif Saaeed Shaheen of Qatar and Kenyas Eliud Kipchoge with one and a half laps to go to win in seven minutes 39.32 seconds. He now holds world titles indoors, outdoors and over cross-country. 

His victory somewhat overshadowed Maria Mutolas unprecedented seventh world indoor title in the 800m. 

The 33-year-old from Mozambique gave a powerful display of front-running and threw her arms aloft as she crossed the line in one minute 58.90 seconds. 

Yuliya Chizhenko made up for her disqualification from the world 1,500 outdoor final last year by winning the indoor title ahead of compatriot Yelena Soboleva. 

Chizhenko had finished second in Helsinki only to be disqualified for obstructing Bahrains Maryam Yusuf Jamal. 

Jamal, who was awarded the silver then, had to settle for bronze this time round. 

Germanys Andre Niklaus caused an upset in the heptathlon, snatching the title from world decathlon champion Bryan Clay by five points. 

It was a case of deja-vu for American Clay, who had also led going into the final event of the 2004 championships only for Roman Sebrle to win. Czech Sebrle, was third on Sunday. 

 Grenadas Alleyne Francique 

 retained his 400m crown.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Flintoff learnt it from me, says Akram

 - Ball tampering is an art 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: To former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, ball tampering is not a crime. He rather considers it as an art. Ball tampering is an art and we (Pakistanis) have mastered it over the years, Akram said at a city hotel on Tuesday. 

Akram revealed that current England captain Andrew Flintoff learnt this art from him during his (Akrams) stint in Lancashire. 

Flintoff learnt it from me when we played together for Lancashire and Simon Jones got to know of it from Waqar (Younis), Akram said. 

The former Pakistan allrounder took the opportunity to slam those criticising Pakistanis and Indians for ball tampering. 

During the last Ashes series, balls swung by miles. Then it was called reverse swing but whenever we Indians and Pakistanis do it, they term it ball tampering, Akram said. 

On the state of turmoil in Pakistan, the highest wicket-taker in ODIs held Younis Khan responsible for the whole controversy following his initial step to quit captaincy and later accepting the mantle. 

As a captain, he (Younis) should have been more responsible, he said. 

The whole episode will put us in bad light, it will affect team spirit, but knowing the Pakistan team, I hope they will tide over the crisis before their first match of the Champions Trophy on October 17, Akram said. 

It has been a culture in Pakistan that every vice-captain wants his captain to fall sick so that he can take over as the leader. 

I was lucky enough as Moin Khan (the then deputy during my captaincy) was fantastic and told me that he will wait for his turn to come, Akram recalled.The former captain also criticised India coach Greg Chappell for his statement that he will continue experimenting. 

 I think experiments should have stopped much 

 earlier, he said.

 Montego Bay: World record-holder umpire Steve Bucknor 

 stands by the startling allegation he made against TV production 

 companies just over a week ago. 

 Theres no need to 

 clarify anything... Ive stated what I had to, 

 he told The Telegraph during a chance meeting at 

 one of the Western Union outlets in Kingston on Monday afternoon. 

Asked whether hed received any communication from the International Cricket Council (ICC), given that general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson had reacted very strongly, Bucknor said: Nobody has told me anything, either verbally or in writing. I dont recall reading anything in the papers either... 

Bucknor, it may be recalled, accused production companies of misusing technology to paint the umpires in poor colour. That, he felt, was creating mistrust between them and the players ? It has been known to happen... When these things are happening, it makes life extremely difficult for the umpires... 

The Elite Panel umpires comments came a day after the ICC announced it would use technology a lot more (albeit on a trial basis) in decision making. 

Widely respected despite some poor decisions in recent times, Bucknor will be officiating in three of the five India versus West Indies ODIs ? first being the opener at Sabina Park, where Pakistans Asad Rauf is going to be his on-field colleague. 

Im looking forward to the assignment... I dont think Ive had one in the West Indies for years, Bucknor remarked, as he moved towards the forex window, where he was greeted with a Sir, its a pleasure... 

 Bucknors big in Jamaica.

 Jaspal Rana sets eyes on London Olympics

Dehra Dun: Triple Asian Games gold medallist shooter Jaspal Rana said on Sunday that he had set his eyes on the 2012 London Olympics as not much time was remaining for the next edition slated in Beijing in 2008. 

Rana, who won the gold medals in Doha in his pet non-Olympic events standard pistol and centrefire pistol events, said he was yet to decide on which event to contest in the Olympics and only after that start preparing. 

My Australian coach is coming shortly. 

I will consult him on which discipline in shooting I should take part in 2012 Olympics, Rana said at Uttaranchal Press Club. 

Referring to the faux pax on the best athlete of the Doha Games award, the marksman said he did not know at what level the misunderstanding took place. 

But, he said, being selected in the final list of five nominees for the most valuable player award was also an achievement. 

I lost only in the final voting, he said. 

Asked whether he was feeling let down by the episode, Rana replied in negative, saying he had already got three gold medals.

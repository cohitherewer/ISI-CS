 India need more allround class

No Holds Barred

Ravi Shastri

India faced an opponent in Mohali who are not easy to overcome. The odds become longer if you are out of sorts. Then nothing much is of help, not the best pitch of the competition, nor a few sparks of revival visible. 

Hence, it wouldnt serve much purpose to pick on Indias follies which, as we all know, look graver in moments of defeat. One could debate endlessly if it was the better option to bat first in Mohali or if the XI was right or whether Mahendra Singh Dhoni, and not Dinesh Mongia, should have been at No. 3. 

Many would have issue with our scoring rate; some would insist the outrageous option of throwing spinners at Ricky Ponting in the power play was the way to go. Excuse me if I am missing out on a few of your very own favourite notions. All this would serve little. 

 I liked what I saw Sreesanth 

All said and done, India for me did most things right. The decision to bat first was the right one as was the composition of the team. Only, one thought Dhoni ahead of Kaif was the better option especially with Dravid playing as well as he was. That could have made a difference to the end score that I thought was competitive. 

The disappointing aspect, though, was the body language in the field once a couple of boundaries were hit. India needed to be more at Australia early on, thinking wickets at all times. 

The bowling with the new ball was ordinary and missed zing. This allowed the Australia to get away. Still, I liked what I saw of Sreesanth and I do believe he should never have been out of the team in the first place. 

He has a wicket-taking ability and aggression that can be groomed and enhanced. His second spell to Ponting and Martyn was the most positive thing, from Indias point of view, of the entire day. 

Glenn McGrath was fantastic and Shane Watson a big asset. The Pigeons (McGrath) ability to up the ante on the big day is what makes him special. His first spell set the tone for things to follow in spite of Sehwags belligerence. 

I am now worried about what lies ahead. Does India continue with their experiments or now fall back upon their proven, if ageing, warriors? Is it time to return to seniors and some experience or should the investment in youth continue given they need their own space and time to grow? 

How do you handle the impatience of the nation and media given the proximity of the World Cup with your own beliefs and theory that you have held on to so dearly. These are some central issues to Indias woes. 

The judgment against V.V.S. Laxman and Anil Kumble in one-dayers has only been about their fielding. Nobody doubts their quality in their respective fields. They are still central to Indias test plans. 

I feel India will have to be a little spacious about this argument as it needs a temporary fix. Both their batting and bowling could do with a little bit of class. Both are enormously respected by opponents all around the world. Youngsters also tend to get inspired by the presence of proven talents. 

I also feel Wasim Jaffer and Gautam Gambhir are the men who are needed since sorting out a good top-order is more important when you go on a tour than packing the lower middle order. 

In moments such as these, the authority of the men in command is usually eroded. Rahul Dravid will survive such a pitfall because he is unquestionably a champion, one of Indias truly greats. 

Greg Chappell too is old enough to understand if a corrective is required in his approach. It is foolhardy to push on with your mistakes when accepting them perhaps is the way forward. After all, to err is human and it takes a brave man to accept it. There is no shame in it.

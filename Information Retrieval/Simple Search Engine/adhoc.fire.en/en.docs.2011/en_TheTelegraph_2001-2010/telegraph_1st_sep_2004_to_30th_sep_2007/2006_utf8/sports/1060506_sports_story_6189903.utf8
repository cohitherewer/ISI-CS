 Traffic-stopper Wie draws 1500

 - American teenager a cut above other women 

 Michelle Wie hits out from a bunker on the second day of the SK Telecom Open in Incheon, near Seoul, on Friday 

Seoul: American 16-year-old Michelle Wie became the first woman to make the cut in a major mens tour event in 61 years on Friday after firing a three-under 69 in the second round of the Asian Tours SK Telecom Open. 

The Hawaiian schoolgirl, who failed to make the cut in seven prior appearances against the men, carded four birdies and a bogey for a two-round five under par 139, six shots behind clubhouse leader Prom Meesawat of Thailand. 

The last woman to make the final two rounds of a mens event was Babe Zaharias at the 1945 Los Angeles Open. 

This is just wonderful? I still cant believe that I made the cut, Wie said. I will be even happier when it all sinks in. 

My putting was pretty good on the first day, but today (Friday) it was better, Wie said, adding she was looking forward to playing against the men in the US. 

I want to challenge the PGA Tour in the US and make it into the top-10, she said. 

Wie, who regularly hits her drives over 300 yards, missed the cut by one stroke at the Casio World Open in Japan last November after bogeying the last two holes. 

She made the cut at a course west of Seoul that overlooks the sea where troops led by US General Douglas MacArthur staged their amphibious assault in 1950 that turned the tide in the Korean War. 

Wie attracted a gallery of about 1,500, organisers said, and even stopped traffic along a highway that ran near two holes as motorists parked to watch her play. A highway patrolman, who sounded his siren just as Wie was about to attempt a birdie putt, drew angry shouts from fans when she missed. 

You idiot. You cost her a stroke, an irate fan bellowed. 

Wie played a consistent game, missing few fairways or greens. She sank a 10-foot putt on the par-five 10th for a birdie and had a spectacular chip on the par-four 15th that led to another. 

The only time she got into trouble was on the par-three 16th, when she hit her tee shot into a bunker. 

 She made a brilliant recovery out of the sand, but missed a four-footer to save par and leading to her only bogey of the round. 

Despite her American nationality, Wie has been embraced as a hometown hero in South Korea, where she is known by her Korean name Wie Sung-mi. Wies parents are from South Korea. Her grandfather Wie Sang-kyu lives in Jangheung, a remote city where a few locals used to pass the hat to support his grandaughter in her early days as an amateur in Hawaii.

 Quick Takes

 Fifa withdraws foul request

 Zurich: Fifa has withdrawn 

 its request for an injunction to prohibit the publication 

 and distribution in Switzerland of Andrew Jennings 

 book, Foul!, according to a media release on Thursday. 

 Since being granted a provisional 

 injunction on April 26, Fifa has analysed and evaluated 

 the book from a legal standpoint. 

 It was found that, despite the 

 book having various defamatory passages and inaccurate statements 

 and aspersions, it was unnecessary for Fifa to continue 

 pursuing legal action. 

 Iraq replace Kuwait

 Johannesburg: World Cup 

 finalists Tunisia have invited Iraq to be their opponents 

 in a final warm-up friendly in Germany on June 7, replacing 

 Kuwait who have pulled out. Kuwait said earlier that they 

 could not raise a team for the game, scheduled for Tunisias 

 German base at Schweinfurt.

 Metzelder injury

 Berlin: Germany defender 

 Christoph Metzelder could be out for two weeks after tearing 

 a calf muscle in training but should be fit for the World 

 Cup, the German association said. 

 He will not, however, be able 

 to play in Dortmunds final match of the season against 

 Bayern Munich on Saturday.

 Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann 

 is set to name his 23-man World Cup squad on Monday.

 Potchefstroom boycott 

Potchefstroom: The Indian electronic media Thursday boycotted the coverage of the first days play of the four-day tour game against Rest of South Africa, alleging a racial taunt by a personnel of Cricket South Africa (CSA). 

We were subjected to vile language by this personnel and what has distressed us is that even our media manager didnt deem it fit to intervene, said a senior correspondent of a television network from India. 

The reason for the unpleasant situation was attributed to the CSA personnels insistence that electronic media crew should leave the area designated for print media immediately. 

The personnel, when contacted, denied to have made any racial comment against the electronic media. (PTI)

 Eduardo spat on me: Dudu

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sporting Clube de Goas Nigerian striker Dudu Omagbemi charged Mohun Bagans Eduardo Coelho with spitting on his face, an act which sparked off an ugly altercation between the two after the first IFA Shield semi-final on Wednesday. 

The referee, S. Suresh, gave marching orders to both of them, but Dudu was fuming and fretting even an hour after the match. He spat on me and I couldnt take it, the Nigerian said, angrily. 

Eduardo, however, denied the charge. 

Everybody saw Dudu charge at me. He was the culprit and owing to his instigation, I will miss the final, the Brazilian said. The match commissioner, M.G. Suvarna, however, didnt indicate the quantum of punishment for the duo. 

Under normal circumstances, minimum punishment for receiving a red card is one-match suspension. But I cant say anything now till I get the referees report on the incident. It may even follow a disciplinary hearing, he said. 

Mohun Bagan coach-cum-physio Robson admitted in the post-match press conference that Eduardo committed a mistake. 

When you are playing for a big club and when you know youll be playing in the final, you should keep your cool. Its a mistake from Eduardos end, but how can I control the players following a tough match, Robson maintained. 

The Brazilian physio-cum interim coach, however, said that he would miss the defender in the final. Its a setback for us, you can say that, he said.

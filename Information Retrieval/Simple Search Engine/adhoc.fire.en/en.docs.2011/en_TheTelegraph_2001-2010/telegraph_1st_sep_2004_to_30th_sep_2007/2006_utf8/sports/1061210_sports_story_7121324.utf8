 We will come out tough: Lara 

 - THIRD ODI vs PAKISTAN 

 Brian Lara in Lahore on Saturday 

Faisalabad: The West Indies have enough bench strength to beat Pakistan in the five-match one-day series despite narrowly losing the second game by two wickets, captain Brian Lara said Saturday. 

The first match of the series in Rawalpindi on Tuesday was washed out due to rain. Pakistan squeezed past the West Indies in Faisalabad by two wickets while chasing a small target of 152 runs to take a 1-0 series lead. We knew from the start we can win this series, Lara said a day before the third ODI. 

The West Indies pacemen Corey Collymore and Jerome Taylor shared six wickets between them before captain Inzamam-ul Haq led Pakistan to victory with an unbeaten knock of 42 off 86 balls in a low-scoring second match. 

Both Laras knees were heavily strapped for Saturdays practice session, but he said there was no cause for concern. Im fine, just getting some treatment, Lara said. 

The West Indies are without two key players who returned home before the series began batsman Ramnaresh Sarwan with a foot injury and allrounder Dwayne Bravo who left for personal reasons.The tourists also played without Shivnarine Chanderpaul in Faisalabad who had a slight knee injury. 

Its no excuse, Lara said. The strength of the team is in its reserves and we will try and come out tough tomorrow.

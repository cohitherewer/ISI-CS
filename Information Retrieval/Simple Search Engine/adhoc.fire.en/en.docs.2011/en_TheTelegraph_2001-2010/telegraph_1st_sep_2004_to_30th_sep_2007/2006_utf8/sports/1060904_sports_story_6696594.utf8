Calcutta: Mizoram whipped Delhi 73-39 to emerge champions in the boys category of the 33rd National Sub-Junior Basketball Championships at the Netaji Indoor Stadium on Sunday. 

Chhattisgarh defended the girls crown in style, beating Maharashtra 68-49 in the final. 

The supremely fit Mizoram boys held the upper hand over their rivals and opened up a 39-23 lead by half-time. Thereafter, in the third and fourth quarters, there was simply no stopping Mizoram as Andrew Lalmalsawma (21) and V. Lalnunsanga (19) tormented the Delhi boys with their excellent finishing. 

Delhi boy Deepanshus finesse helped him to 16 points in the final, but his effort was not enough to put a brake on the Mizoram juggernaut. Deepanshu, however, had something to cheer about as he emerged the top-scorer of the tournament with 150 points.

Delhi team officials, however, alleged that Mizoram had fielded some overage players. They pointed out Lalmalsawma as one. 

On whether the allegation held merit, a WBBA medical unit official admitted that a number of teams were guilty of this. 

If Delhi have accused Mizoram of fielding overage players, they are also to be faulted for the same reason. If teams are scrapped on this ground, the tournament will be left with almost none, he said. 

In the girls summit clash, Maharashtra initially put up some fight but the Chhattisgarh trio of Saranjeet Kaur (16), A. Kavita (15) and captain Ranjeeta Kaur (10) ensured they retained the title in the end.

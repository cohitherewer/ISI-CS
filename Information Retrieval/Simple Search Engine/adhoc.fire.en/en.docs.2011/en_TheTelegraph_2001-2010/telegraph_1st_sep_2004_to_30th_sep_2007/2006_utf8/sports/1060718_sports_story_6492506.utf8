 BCCI puts forward Dravids name

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has recommended the name of Team India captain Rahul Dravid for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award, the countrys highest sporting honour, for the year 2005-06. 

The BCCI has also put forward mediumpacer Irfan Pathan and left-hand batsman Yuvraj Singh as possible candidates for the Arjuna award for the same year, Board secretary Niranjan Shah said on Monday. 

The Khel Ratna award was initiated in 1991 and Sachin Tendulkar is the only cricketer to have received the honour (1997-98). 

Dravid, who took over from Sourav Ganguly last year, is currently regarded as one of the finest batsman. (PTI)

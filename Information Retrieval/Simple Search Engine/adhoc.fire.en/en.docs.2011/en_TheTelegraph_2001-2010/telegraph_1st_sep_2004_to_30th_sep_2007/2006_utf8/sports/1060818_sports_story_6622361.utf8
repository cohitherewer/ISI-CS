 Jones a racist: SA minister

Durban: South African legislators on Thursday flayed Australian commentator Dean Jones racist remark on Hashim Amla, describing it as a sign of growing discrimination and stereotyping. 

The comment was reflective of a growing malaise of religious and racial intolerance, characterised by increasing discrimination, Cassim Salojee, a member of the ruling African National Congress, said in the parliament in Cape Town. 

Jones had apologised to Amla for his slur and the cricketer had accepted it unconditionally. 

Describing Jones as a racist, minister of sport and recreation Makhenkesi Stofile said Amlas gesture had shown the magnanimity of the African spirit.

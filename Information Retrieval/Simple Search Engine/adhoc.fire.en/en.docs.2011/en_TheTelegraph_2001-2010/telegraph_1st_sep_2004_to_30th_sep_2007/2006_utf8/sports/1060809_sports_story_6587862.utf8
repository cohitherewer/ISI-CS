The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Moehlin (Switzerland): Former top-ranked tennis player Yevgeny Kafelnikov is being pursued for an unpaid tax debt of almost 150,000 Swiss francs ($122,000; euro 95,000), authorities said on Tuesday.

 The Russian owes the town of Moehlin taxes for 2003 and 2004, as well as for a villa he bought there in 2001, the towns financial administrator Christian Gasser said. Kafelnikovs whereabouts are currently unknown, Gasser added. The Russian retired in 2004 and has since turned his attention to golf and professional poker.

 Mumbai: Vikram Malhotra shocked Irelands Brian Byrne 3-1 to enter the second qualifying round of the PSA Otters Open squash meet on Tuesday. Malhotra came from behind to win 8-11, 11-4, 12-10, 11-8.

 London: Liu Xiang, the world record holder in the 110m hurdles, pulled out of the Birmingham International meet on Tuesday. Liu was to captain the Chinese team competing at the meet from August 19-20, but the Olympic champion will instead assist with the World Junior Championships in Beijing from August 15-20.

 Xiang also said he was unsure if his record would be bettered during his competitive lifetime. In the next 10 years, I think the best time will be around 12.90 seconds. But who knows? Maybe it can stand until I become a grandfather, Xinhua quoted him as saying.

 London: David Coulthard signed a one-year contract extension that will keep him with Formula One team Red Bull through 2007.

 Stockholm: Fredrik Ljungberg was named Sweden captain on Tuesday, two days after Olof Mellberg stepped down as skipper. The oft-injured Arsenal midfielder was one of Swedens best players at the World Cup.

 London: Arsenal is reportedly set to sign forward Franck Ribery from Marseille. Riberys agent told a British daily that a transfer offer for Franck would be registered with Marseille chairman Pape Diouf within 24 or 48 hours. The north London club is expected to make a 13.5 million ($25.7 million) offer, the paper said.

 Poland still not lacking in motivation

Barsinghausen: Poland and Costa Rica play on Tuesday in a match with no impact on the outcome of the tournament. 

The teams still hope to salvage some respect and give their fans a little pleasure before they head home. 

Germany and Ecuador have secured the two top spots in Group A. Poland and Costa Rica, meanwhile, have each drawn criticism back home after two defeats and will exit the tournament after their final group match in Hanover. 

This is still the World Cup, and I think all of us wants to prove something, Poland keeper Artur Boruc said on Monday. Its an important enough match for us that we have to win and are going to want to give a bit of joy to our fans. There shouldnt be any lack of motivation. 

But for Poland coach Pawel Janas, more than just pride may be on the line against Costa Rica. 

The president of the Polish soccer federation, Michal Listkiewicz, said on Friday that Janas future with the national team could hinge on the result of the match. 

Costa Rica coach Alexandre Guimares have also been criticised after two tournament losses. The Ticos pushed Germany before losing 2-4 in their opener, then fell 0-3 to Ecuador. 

Some newspapers and fans have asked for players to be dropped and even for a new coach. 

It hurts, because we, the players who came here, are the ones who have given satisfaction to our country, captain Mauricio Solis said. We do not deserve this treatment considering what we have done and earned for our country. 

Defender Jervis Drummond appeared less affected by the criticism. We have to understand that fans always expect just one thing from the team, and that is winning. Except that some times you cant win, he said. 

Coach Janas has promised personnel changes for Tuesdays game, but would only say the best 11 will play. 

Midfielder Radoslaw Sobolewski will sit after being sent off against Germany. Mariusz Lewandowski, Miroslaw Szymkowiak, Sebastian Mila and Piotr Giza could replace him, Janas said.

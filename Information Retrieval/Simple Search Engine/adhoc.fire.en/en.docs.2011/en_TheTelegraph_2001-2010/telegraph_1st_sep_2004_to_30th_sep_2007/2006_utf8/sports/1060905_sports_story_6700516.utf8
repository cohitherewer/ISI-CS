 Suvrajit, Aswin in lead

 NATIONAL B CHESS

 Ahmedabad: Continuing with 

 his dream run, Aswin Jayaram of Tamil Nadu defeated Woman 

 Grandmaster Eesha Karavade of Maharashtra to share a two-way 

 lead along with Suvrajit Saha of Bengal after the end of 

 the fifth round of the 44th National B Chess Championships 

 here.

 Amongst the senior players in 

 the fray, International Master Vargeese Koshy was quite 

 impressive in his triumph over IM-in-waiting Saptarshi Roy. 

 It was Koshys pet English opening that netted a pawn 

 after some lacklustre display by Roy and the wily ONGC employee 

 romped home in a rook and pawns endgame after 77 moves.

 Jayaram, who was in contention 

 for the title in the just concluded National Junior Chess 

 Championship in New Delhi and ended fourth, cruised past 

 Eesha who was outdone playing the white side of a Grunfeld 

 Defence. Suvrajit defeated Arjun Tiwari in what was clearly 

 a dominating positional display by the Bengali.

 With eight rounds still to go 

 in the premier Swiss event of the country being organised 

 to select 30 qualifiers to the next National A Chess Championship, 

 both Suvrajit and Jayaram have five points from as many 

 games and will now meet in the next round.

 Suvrajit faced the Dutch Defence 

 against Arjun who played black. Suvrajit got an early opening 

 advantage and slowly exerted pressure along the centre to 

 win a couple of pawns. The transition to the endgame was 

 smooth thereafter for saha. (PTI)

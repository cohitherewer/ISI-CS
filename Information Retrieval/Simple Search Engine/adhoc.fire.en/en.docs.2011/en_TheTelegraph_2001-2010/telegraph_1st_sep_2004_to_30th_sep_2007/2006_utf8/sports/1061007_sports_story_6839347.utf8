New Delhi: For Graeme Smith, the South African skipper, the tour of India had always been a highly enjoyable outing and this time it wont be any different. Portrayed as one of the favourites to win the Champions Trophy, Smith feels that his team would enjoy the tag throughout and prove it absolutely right at the end of the tournament. 

The 25-year-old left-hand batsman and right-arm spinner, who faced the media and a battery of cameramen shortly after South Africas arrival in the capital, was all at ease in answering volley of questions except for the ones about Hersheille Gibbs. 

Smith, in fact made it clear at the very onset that he wont take any question on Gibbs. Do ask me on other subjects, he said. And when the media asked him about South Africas chances in the Champions Trophy, he looked relaxed. 

Yes, we are a team that can win the tournament, Smith said. I know its a tough tournament and at least seven teams have the ability to win. But oflate, we have done well and will continue to do well. Frankly, we are enjoying our favourite tag. 

Aggressive cricket, Smith said, his team would like to play in the Champions Trophy. We are a well prepared side and would play according to our potential. Fielding, however, would be important for us, or for that matter any team in the tournament. 

Smith knows that the weather and pitches in India play a crucial role in deciding the fate of the matches. The 10-day coaching camp that South Africa had before leaving for India may not be enough, Smith felt. 

The real preparations will be in the next few days when we go out to the nets and play three practice matches, Smith said. Key will be to acclimatise ourselves with the Indian conditions here. It is going to be tough tournament. 

Asked whether he found the Indian pitches difficult to play in the previous tour, South Africas youngest-ever captain said there was too much movement. But then, the wickets were good and it was a tough series. I was not surprised. It was a hard-fought series and ended in a 2-2 draw. 

Smith was firmly of the opinion that the gap between Australia and other nations, especially in the one-dayers, are gradually receding. He also said that Jack Kallis would be back with a bang. He will have to do both batting and bowling, Smith said. 

Team coach Mickey Arthur said he would not do much experiments with the team. We have a settled side. Why should we go for experimentation?

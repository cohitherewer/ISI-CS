 We need to develop fifth-bowler option

 - Dravid happy with players flexibility 

Karachi: Captain Rahul Dravid is not rankled by the absence of a genuine allrounder in the team and says the encouraging development of some of his utility players had more or less filled up the void. 

Dravid says it is not easy to find allrounders of the calibre of Kapil Dev or Imran Khan and the best option in the given situation was to develop players from within the ranks to suit the teams needs. 

He has been quite impressed by the flexibility shown by some of the players during the tour of Pakistan and singled out Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan for special praise. 

I dont really look at the people you should have missed. Anyone would dream of having a Kapil Dev or Imran Khan in the team. But these are once in a generation cricketers, you dont find them easily, Dravid said in an interview which focussed on challenges that lay ahead for India after the conclusion of the tour of Pakistan. 

I am quite happy with the flexibility that some of the players have shown. (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni is an allrounder in what he does. Irfan is developing into a good cricketer. Ajit Agarkar can bat, even people like Harbhajan Singh and lower down Zaheer Khan are working hard on their batting. 

The Indian captain also said developing the fifth bowling option would be one of his main challenges ahead of the World Cup next year. 

We need to develop some of our bowling, (particularly) our fifth bowling option. People like Sachin bowled really well in this tournament and that was very important for us. Virender Sehwag needs to bowl a lot more and we need to give him opportunities.

We need to give Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and may be Suresh Raina, more opportunity to bowl in a match, thats my challenge, Dravid explained. 

The challenge for us is to develop some of these young boys and to see how we can make them better players, give them different opportunities and let them grow. I think if we can develop some of these young boys into better cricketers by the time the World Cup comes, we will have a strong team. 

Reflecting on the 45-day tour, the 33-year-old said it had overall been a successful outing. 

We played good cricket in first two Test matches, especially in batting, considering the kind of pressure we were under to chase down scores like 600. We had a tough ten-day period, especially with the (Karachi) Test match. I dont think we played badly in the first one-dayer. We just had a tough Test match. Other than that, its been a very good tour and a successful one. 

The spirit has been really good and I am quite happy with it. But we need to keep getting better, Dravid said. He said it was the failure to negotiate the new ball which cost India the Karachi Test. (PTI)

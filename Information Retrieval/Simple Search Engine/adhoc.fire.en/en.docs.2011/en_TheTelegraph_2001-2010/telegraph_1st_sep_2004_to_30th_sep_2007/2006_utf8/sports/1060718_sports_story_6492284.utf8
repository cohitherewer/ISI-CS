 Shiv teamed with Slattery, Taylor

Hoylake: Tiger Woods will launch his British Open title defence in the company of three-time winner Nick Faldo and Shingo Katayama of Japan at Hoylake on Thursday. 

Indias Shiv Kapur has been grouped with local hope Lee Slattery and American Vaughn Taylor. 

Woods, who coasted to victory by five strokes at St. Andrews last year, will tee off at 1409 local (1309 GMT). 

Widely considered the tournament favourite despite having played only two events over the last three months, Woods will be chasing his third Claret Jug, having claimed his first at St Andrews in 2000. 

Ernie Els will play the first two rounds with Britains Luke Donald and Italys Italian Edoardo Molinari, winner of the 2005 US amateur title. 

Masters champion Phil Mickelson has been grouped with Britains Darren Clarke and Yasuharu Imano of Japan. 

In other high-profile groupings, Vijai Singh, European number one David Howell and American Zach Johnson will begin at 0820 on Thursday while Briton Colin Montgomerie will tee off at 0858 in the company of big-hitting John Daly and Australias Stuart Appleby.

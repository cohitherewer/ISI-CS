 Mahmud calls it a day

Bogra: Former Bangladesh captain Khaled Mahmud is quitting international cricket. 

I will play the last match of my international career tomorrow (Monday), the 34-year-oldsaid on the eve of Mondays one-dayer against Sri Lanka. I feel it is time to quit. 

Mahmud has played 76 one-dayers and 12 Tests for the fledgling cricketing nation. 

He has scored 955 runs at an average of 14.04 since making his one-day debut against India in January 1988. He also picked up 67 wickets at 42.53. 

Mahmud made his Test debut against Zimbabwe in November 2001.

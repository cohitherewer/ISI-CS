 Al Qamar for Patrons Trophy 

 SRIMAX

 Marshall

 Bangalore: Rashid Byramji-trained Al Qamar may have it easy in the Racing Patrons Trophy, here on Friday. Al Qamar, who found one too good in Cedros last time out, is taking on an easier set this time out. 

 The Alnasr Alwasheek progeny, who will be ridden by Ryan Marshall, has been working brilliantly. He may easily contain the challenge of Fashion Verdict who is expected to run him close.

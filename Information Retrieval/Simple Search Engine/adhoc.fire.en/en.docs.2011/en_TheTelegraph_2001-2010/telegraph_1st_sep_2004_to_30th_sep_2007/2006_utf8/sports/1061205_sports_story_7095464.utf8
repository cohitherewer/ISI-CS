 No play at Kotla amid controversy

New Delhi: The Ranji tie between Delhi and Uttar Pradesh ended in a draw after no play was possible due to bad light on the final day of the Super League clash here Monday. 

Bad light and smog denied possibility of play on final day. 

However, there were many at the ground who believed that had the match officials been more proficient in handling the situation and conducted their duties properly, some play would have been possible when light improved for a brief period. 

When light improved, nearly 45 minutes before lunch, Match Referee Sambaran Banerjee and umpire Sameer Bandekar were not present at the ground. During this period, only I. Shivaram, the other on-field umpire, was present. 

It has been reliably learnt that the other two officials had gone to visit St Stephens College ground where the under-22 match between Punjab and Bengal was being held. 

An upset DDCA has decided to take up the matter with the BCCI. 

Banerjee denied that he had left the ground. The umpires had informed the captains that the next inspection would be after lunch... I had never left the ground. This is no issue, he said.

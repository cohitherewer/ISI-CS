 Saina enters title round

 - World junior meet 

New Delhi: Saina Nehwal thwarted a spirited challenge from Bae Youn Joo of Korea to reach the girls singles final at the World Junior Badminton Championship in Incheon, South Korea. 

World No. 32 Saina, who etched out a stunning performance to prevail over the Korean 25-23 21-13, is now a win from creating history. 

Saina, seeded 14th, disposed of Bae in just 35 minutes to set up a title clash with top seed Wang Yihan of China tomorrow. 

Yihan defeated Kim Moon of Korea 21-16, 21-13 in the other semi-final. 

Saina was at her aggressive best and played with a purpose. It was a good fight. The first game was long and tough, but I played with patience and won. In the second game, I engaged in long rallies and it paid of, the 16-year-old said from Incheon. 

After getting 1-0 lead, Saina grew in confidence and went all guns blazing in the second. She broke apart from 13-all and did not allow her opponent any scoring chance from there on. 

We were tied 13-all in the second game, but then she started netting too often and I played my shots, she said. 

Though Sainas opponent in the final, Wang Yihan, is ranked 103 in the world, she has won her first international title IBF World Cup this year, beating world No. 2 and fellow Chinese Xie Xingfang. 

I have not played her before, but she is a good player and has defeated top players this year. It will be a tough match, she said.

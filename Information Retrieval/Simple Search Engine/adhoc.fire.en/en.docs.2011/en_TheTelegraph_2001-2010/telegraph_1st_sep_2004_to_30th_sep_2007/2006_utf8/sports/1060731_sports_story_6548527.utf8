 Harikrishna remains in joint lead

Paks (Hungary): Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna put up a sturdy defence to manage a draw with Grandmaster Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine in the second round to remain in joint lead at the Marx Gyorgy Memorial International chess tournament here. 

It turned out to be a tough day for the Indian as he was on the defensive for the major part of the game but his effort was enough to keep Efimenko at bay. 

Harikrishna was in joint lead after Hungarian defending champion Zoltan Almasi also shared a point with compatriot Peter Acs and Wang Yue of China achieved the same result against Ferenc Berkes of Hungary in the six-player double round-robin tournament.

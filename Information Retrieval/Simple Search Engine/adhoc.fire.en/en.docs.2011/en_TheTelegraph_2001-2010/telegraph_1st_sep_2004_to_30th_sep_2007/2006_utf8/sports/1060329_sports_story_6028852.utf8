 Harbhajan gives credit to Yuvraj 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: His match-winning spell in the first ODI at the Kotla on Tuesday did not surprise Harbhajan Singh. 

It was long overdue and I knew it would come at one point of time, said Harbhajan after being adjudged Man of the Match. 

I was bowling well, but not getting the wickets. But I was never disappointed. Wickets, I was confident, would come some time or the other. 

The off-spinner was truly the cynosure at the Kotla after the match. While his teammates almost carried him to the dressing room, loud cheers were reserved for him when he stepped ahead to receive the Man-of-the-Match award. Policemen on duty had a tough time controlling the crowd when he left for the hotel in a car after talking to mediamen. 

Frankly, winning the match from such a situation was nothing new for me. In 2004 in the NatWest Trophy, we scored 204 and won. I returned with figures of three for 28, said the offie. 

He was thrilled to have got five wickets on the Kotla track. 

Like a true teamman, Harbhajan was not ready to walk away with the credit alone. According to him, Yuvraj made an equal contribution to the victory. 

Yuvraj helped me get the wickets by keeping things tight from the other end. He bowled really well today. 

On his batting, Harbhajan said: I got out to a very bad shot in the last Test in Mumbai. 

Today I wanted to bat till the last over. Unfortunately that did not happen.

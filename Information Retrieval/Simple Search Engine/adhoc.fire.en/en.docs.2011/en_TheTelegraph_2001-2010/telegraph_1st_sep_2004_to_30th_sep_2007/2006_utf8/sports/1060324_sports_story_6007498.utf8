 Patience key in India: Cairns

 Chris Cairns in 

 Mumbai on Thursday 

Mumbai: Patience is the key to play well in India, according to former New Zealand allrounder Chris Cairns, who has set his eyes on charitable work in the country after taking a cue from former Australia captain Steve Waugh. 

India and I did not agree with each other on my first visit. It was too hot and Anil Kumble kept dismissing me bat-pad. But I learnt to be patient later on. If you have patience you will do well in India. Its a great country and has wonderful people, said the one-time power-hitting batsman who also used to bowl at lively pace, at the launch of the Chris Cairns Foundation on Wednesday . 

The New Zealander is in India in connection with opening of the foundation for childrens education in association with an NGO, Pratham. 

Cairns had a disastrous first visit to India under the captaincy of wicket-keeper Lee Germon who, in fact, also made his Test debut in the same series. 

Cairns said hes been talking about the foundation with a lot of Indian cricketers, including captain Rahul Dravid, and was keen to make it a big success. 

About the victory by England over India in the third and final Test, Cairns said: It was a fantastic achievement. It gets nothing bigger than beating India in India. Full credit to the England team. 

 Cairns also intends to go for 

 a charity walk in India to raise funds, similar to what 

 Ian Botham does for cancer research in England.

 Chittagong: Sri Lankas 

 Muttiah Muralidharan is set to play his 100th Test when 

 the visitors meet Bangladesh in the first Test on Tuesday, 

 but that might not be the only milestone he reaches. The 

 off-spinner needs only five wickets to become the first 

 player to chalk up 1,000 Test and one-day wickets. He is 

 also six wickets shy of becoming only the second player 

 after Australias Shane Warne to take 600 Test wickets.

 You never know when it will 

 come, he said of reaching 600 Test wickets. I 

 always try to bowl my best and try to help my team win. 

 If it comes it comes, otherwise it will take another series. 

 Muralidharan said it was a good feeling to play 

 his 100th Test match and that he never thought about achieving 

 the feat when he started playing.

 He will become the second Sri 

 Lankan after former captain Sanath Jayasuriya, and the 36th 

 cricketer in the world, to make 100 Test appearances. 

 Bangladesh, meanwhile, are hoping 

 to inspire themselves with their one-day wins. Our 

 Test record is not good but we are confident of doing better 

 after our recent performances in one-dayers, said 

 captain Habibul Bashar, who led his team to their first 

 international win over Sri Lanka last week.

 The home side won the second ODI 

 of a three-match series in Bogra on Wednesday to keep alive 

 the series, a rarity for Bangladesh.

 They eventually lost 1-2, but 

 after wins over India and Australia in the past two seasons, 

 they have shown their capability of springing the odd surprise 

 in the one-day form of the game.

 But they have yet to turn the 

 tables on any big team in Tests, having lost 35 of their 

 matches, 24 by innings margins. (AGENCIES)

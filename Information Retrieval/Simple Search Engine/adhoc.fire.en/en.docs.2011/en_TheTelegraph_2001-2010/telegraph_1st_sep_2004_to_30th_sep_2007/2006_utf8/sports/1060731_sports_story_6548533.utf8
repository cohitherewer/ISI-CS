The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Selectors should be appointed on professional terms

 - People should read the entire book before concluding anything, says Wright 

 John Wright 

John Wright 

TT: You were maintaining a diary during your years with Team India? 

JW: Off and on, not every day? Id also been storing a few things in my laptop? Id done the same during my years as Kents coach. 

TT: A news agency reported Sourav Ganguly-specific extracts from your book yesterday and that has made headlines. Your react-ion? 

JW: I wasnt aware? Look, people should read the entire book before concluding anything? Just going by bits and pieces wont be fair either to me or to the person Ive written about? (After a pause) I believe Ive been fair and, overall, its a book which shows Indian cricket in a positive light. Its constructive and I havent set out to lose the many friends I made during my years in India. 

TT: Now that youve written about Sourav and the captaincy, can I go public with your private views on leadership? 

JW: No? Please let that remain between friends? (Again, after a pause) Sourav and I had some great times, but there also were moments of disappointment? Towards the end of our partnership, the results had dried up and it was a time or change? I was, in any case, leaving? 

TT: Is it possible for Sourav to make a comeback? 

JW: For his sake, I hope he does? The only way for anybody to strengthen his case is to get runs? Sourav may not have got big runs for Northants, but the good thing is that he hasnt spent the summer at home. 

TT: How often did Sourav seek your help to rectify shortcomings as a batsman? 

JW: Sourav has been a great player? His record (over 15,000 runs in Tests and ODIs) is testimony to that? Yet, all batsmen have strengths and weaknesses? Sourav was concerned about his batting, but a coach cant go beyond trying to iron out deficien-cies. 

TT: Are you aware that Sourav obliquely attacked Jagmohan Dalmiya in an e-mail a shade over a week ago? 

JW: I saw that on the net, yes? During the time that I was in India, Mr Dalmiya came across as a strong ally of Sourav? 

TT: Your thoughts on the first nine months of the Rahul Dravid era? 

JW: Rahuls been doing a very fine job? His batting hasnt suffered and the two innings (81 and 68) he played in the last Test against the West Indies, four weeks ago, were out of this world? One would go miles to watch them. 

TT: What about your successor, Greg Chappell? 

JW: The team is making progress? If I can add, its in good hands. 

TT: Are you peeved that some still keep suggesting you were soft? 

JW: I wasnt, but you must ask the boys that? Of course, its a fact that I never aired my views in public? The label doesnt worry me, though. 

TT: The extract contained a reference to the selectors? 

JW: (Interrupting) Theyve got a tough job and it doesnt help that they get voted out during the Boards AGM? The selectors should get appointed on professional terms and their tenure not linked to what happens in the AGM. Last year itself, Id told you that the zonal system must be done away with. 

TT: Well, the book is out of the way. What now? 

JW: (Laughs again) Im looking for a job and looking for some- thing to keep myself warm! It has been a bitterly cold winter in New Zealand.

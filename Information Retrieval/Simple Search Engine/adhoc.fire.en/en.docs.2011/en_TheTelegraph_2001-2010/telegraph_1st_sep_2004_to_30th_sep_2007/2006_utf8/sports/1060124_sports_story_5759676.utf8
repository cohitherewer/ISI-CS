 Chirping mars great cricket at Iqbal Stadium

 - Dhoni counters Shoaib in brilliant fashion 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Faisalabad: Two superb innings, each produced from different fibres, and two purposeful partnerships ... Add a furious spell and two instances of walking ... Chirping as well ... That completes the picture. Clearly, on Monday, there hardly was a dull moment at the Iqbal Stadium. 

Right now, its pretty much even-stevens (in the second Test) ... However, 180 overs remain and thats a big number in the subcontinent, remarked Team India captain Rahul Dravid, who authored one of those two innings, with the other coming from Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Responding to Pakistans first innings total of 588, India reached 441 for five by stumps on Day-III. Yes, a draw is the most likely result ... The wicket is still flat, acknowledged Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. 

The script, though, may have read very differently had Dhoni and Irfan Pathan not stitched an unseparated sixth-wicket partnership of 160 ? a best for India in bilateral engagements. After the loss of four wickets in 11 overs, they ensured Pakistan didnt get the option of asking India to bat again. 

Additionally, Dhoni (116 not out) and Pathan (unbeaten on 49) made Dravid breathe easy. But for them, he would have had a tough time justifying playing a batsman less. Either being made to follow on or being in arrears in a big way would have meant failure on all fronts: Conceding too many, even with an extra bowler, and scoring too few after altering the balance of the XI. 

We always knew Dhoni and Irfan would give us a cushion ... That we had a back-up, is how Dravid put it. 

Reflecting on his own hundred (103 in 342 minutes, 220 deliveries, 16x4) and his record-rewriting partnership for the second-wicket with V. V. S. Laxman, he said: Up against such a big total, it was important for a big stand to calm the nerves ... Laxman batted very well, but its disappointing we werent around when the second new ball was taken ... 

Dravids three-figure knock was his second in as many innings as opener and the Gautam Gambhirs will have to consider retiring very prematurely or hope for a slot ? none exists, at the moment ? in the middle-order. 

The captain has been insisting his opening isnt a long-term solution, but it definitely is the best. Moreover, at least in this innings, Laxman was absolutely comfortable in the No. 3 position. 

 For whatever reason, stand-in captain Younis Khan didnt give Shoaib Akhtar an extended spell when his agenda was to blast out the Indians. A couple of overs more (than the six) could have made a difference ... I dont know why Shoaib didnt have a longer bowl then ... was Woolmers reaction. 

Meanwhile, according to The Telegraphs sources, Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle has taken note of the sledging from Pakistan and Younis was summoned for an informal tete-a-tete. 

Dravid made his displeasure known when he told the Media: You make your deductions ... Its for the umpires to see ... 

Shoaib, who unleashed that deadly spell after lunch, wasnt the only one out to unsettle the Indians. Yet, his tactics paid off when Sachin Tendulkar walked instead of waiting for Simon Taufels verdict. 

The TV replays revealed the express Shoaib delivery, pitched short as well, brushed Sachins right glove (which wasnt holding the bat) and he ought to have stood his ground. He walked, like Dravid, who was run out by a brilliant throw from substitute Imran Farhat. 

Excellent gestures, but ... 

Footnote: Captain Inzamam-ul Haqs participation in the third and final Test, in Karachi, is in some doubt. The position is unlikely to be clear in the next day or two.

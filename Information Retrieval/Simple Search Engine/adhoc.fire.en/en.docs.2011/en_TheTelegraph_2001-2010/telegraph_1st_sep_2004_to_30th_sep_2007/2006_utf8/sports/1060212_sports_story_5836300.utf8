Changwon: Old warhorses Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi ensured India stayed afloat in the crucial Davis Cup tie against South Korea by winning the doubles and reducing the lead to 1-2 here on Saturday. 

Down 0-2 after the twin defeats in the opening singles rubbers on Friday, the Indian duo exhibited sparks of their old rhythm to overcome Oh-Hee Kwon and Woong-Sun Jun 6-2, 1-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the Asia Oceania Zone group I tie. 

Indias victory in the doubles has now rendered Sundays reverse singles matches crucial for both sides. 

Joining hands for the tie, Paes-Bhupathi started off on a positive note, winning the first set with ease. However, Oh-Hee and Woong-Sun got their act together and capitalised on their opponents errors to fight back and bag the second set in no time. 

With the scores levelled, Paes and Bhupathi clung on to their aggressive brand of tennis to race to a 5-0 lead in the third set. 

The Koreans showed some resistance to win three games but they had no answer to the Indians net coverage and fine synchronisation. 

The last set turned out to be cakewalk for the visitors who cruised ahead until Oh-Hee and Woong-Sun effected a break in the sixth game. 

However, the confident Indians broke back in the very next game with Bhupathi holding on to his serve to wrap up the match in style. 

India, who have lost all the three previous Davis Cup rubbers hosted by South Korea, now need to win both the reverse singles to qualify for the next round. 

In Sundays matches, 232nd-ranked Rohan Bopanna is scheduled to take on 89th-ranked Hyung Taik Lee while Prakash Amritraj, ranked 249, will lock horns with Hee-Seok Chung, ranked 677.

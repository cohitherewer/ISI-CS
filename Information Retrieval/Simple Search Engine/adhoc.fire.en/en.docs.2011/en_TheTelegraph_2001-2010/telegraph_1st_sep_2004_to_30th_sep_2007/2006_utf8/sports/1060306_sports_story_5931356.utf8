 Hyderabad: National champion 

 Surya Sekhar Ganguly won the ONGC Cup International Open 

 chess tournament after settling for a quick draw with Grandmaster 

 Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan in the 10th and final round here 

 on Sunday.

 The winner was decided by Busholdz 

 system after the Indian Oil player finished with eight points 

 along with five others ? Deepan Chakravarthy, Arun Prakash, 

 Pavel Kotsur, B. P. Singh and Zia-ur Rahman of Bangladesh 

 and shared the prize money of Rs 1.1 lakh each.

 IM Deepan emerged runners up 

 after agreeing for a quick draw with GM Pravin Thipsay. 

 On the other boards, D. P. Singh logged eight points to 

 finish overall sixth.

 GM Rahman scored a lucky victory 

 over compatriot Abdullah Al Rakib and joined the eight-pointers 

 club, while Asian junior champion S. Arun Prasad defeated 

 GM Reefat Bin Sattar of Bangladesh. 

 Singh stole the thunder on the 

 final day with his imaginative attacking display despite 

 being pushed to the wall by the immensely experienced Fominyh. 

 Playing the white side of a Sicilian Paulsen, Singh went 

 all out for a victory and was duly rewarded when Fominyhs 

 patience broke up during the final stages. 

 Prasad won an exciting game against 

 Sattarinan with the English opening wherein Prasad, playing 

 white, got a slight advantage after the opening and nursed 

 his position well enough after that to romp home victorious.

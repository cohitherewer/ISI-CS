 Ancic gets past Blake

Hamburg: Croat Mario Ancic battled to a three-set victory over fifth-seeded American James Blake to reach the Hamburg Masters quarter finals on Thursday. 

The No. 12 seed won 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 to join David Ferrer in the last-eight after the Spaniard eked out a 6-2, 6-4 win against compatriot and former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero. 

Blake, who has risen to No. 7 in the world, served for the match at 5-4 in the final set but Ancic broke back and won the tie-break with his 10th ace of the contest. 

The 24-year-old Ferrer earlier beat fellow Spaniard Ferrero in chilly conditions on the slow red claycourt. The 16th seed also triumphed over Ferrero in Monte Carlo last month and maintained his hold over the former French Open champion. 

No.15 seed Czech Radek Stepanek reached the last-eight by defeating Swedens Robin Soederling 6-3, 6-2. 

 Hingis in last 8 

Former champion Martina Hingis pounced on 32 unforced errors from Francesca Schiavone to win 6-0, 7-5 and earn a place in the quarter finals of the Rome Masters on Thursday, another report adds. 

The unseeded Hingis, five times a Grand Slam champion as a teenager, crushed the top Italian hope in less than 90 minutes. The Swiss was helped along by Schiavones string of errors and her inability to convert on 12 of 13 break-points.

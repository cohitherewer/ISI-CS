 Trescothick returns for personal reasons

Vadodara: Englands Marcus Trescothick will return home immediately from the tour of India for personal reasons, coach Duncan Fletcher said on Saturday. He will fly out of Mumbai late on Saturday. 

He is going home due to very personal reasons. Please dont ask more about it, he told reporters. 

It has been learnt that Trescothicks father-in-law had injured himself by falling off a roof while the cricketer was touring Pakistan last year. 

The vice-captains departure adds to Englands tour woes with captain Michael Vaughan being doubtful for the first Test starting in Nagpur on Wednesday due to the recurrence of a knee problem. 

Fletcher confirmed that allrounder Andrew Flintoff would captain the side if Vaughan failed to recover in time. A replacement for Trescothick would also be called up, he said. 

Batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Paul Collingwood are nursing back problems while pacer Simon Jones is down with a stomach bug and missed the three-day warm-up game which the tourists lost by eight wickets on Saturday. 

Alastair Cook and James Anderson have already been withdrawn from Englands A side in the West Indies and have been drafted in as cover for Pietersen, Collingwood, Vaughan and Jones. 

It is a bit worrying to lose Trescothick, Fletcher said. He is a world class opener. To lose someone like him is a big blow. 

Trescothick was one of the few England players to shine during the recent 0-2 Test series defeat in Pakistan, scoring 193 in the opening game.

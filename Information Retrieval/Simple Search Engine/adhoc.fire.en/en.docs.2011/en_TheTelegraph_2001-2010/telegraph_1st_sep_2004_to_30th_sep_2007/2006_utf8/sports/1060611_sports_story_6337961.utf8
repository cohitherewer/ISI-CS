 Team India gallop to 230/2 in 2 sessions

 - Sehwag misses century before lunch by one run 

 Sehwag in Gros Islet 

 on Saturday 

 Gros Islet: Virender Sehwag 

 narrowly missed the rare feat of scoring a hundred before 

 lunch as India made a blazing start in the second Test against 

 the West Indies here on Saturday.

 India reached 230 for two at tea on Day I. Virender Sehwag 

 was batting on 142, with captain Rahul Dravid on 34. Wasim 

 Jaffer (43) and V.V.S. Laxman were the batsmen out, Pedro 

 Collins taking both wickets. 

 Sehwag was unbeaten on a glorious 

 99 (15x4, 2x6) to help India reach 140 for no loss at lunch 

 at the Beausejour Stadium.

 The right-handed opener was lucky 

 to survive a run out chance as he scampered for a single 

 off the last ball before the lunch break in an attempt to 

 reach the three-figure mark.

 Wasim Jaffer, double centurion 

 in the drawn first Test, was batting on 34.

 Sehwag reached his half-century 

 with a stunning six off Dwayne Bravo off only 33 balls. 

 That Bravo over cost 21 runs as Sehwag smashed another six 

 and two fours. Till lunch, the Delhi batsman had faced 75 

 balls in 120 minutes.

 There was both exhilaration and 

 disappointment for the delhi dasher as he had an opportunity 

 to break a host of records.

 Sehwag was on 65 off 38 balls 

 and looked on course to challenge Viv Richards fastest 

 ever Test century (off 56 balls). Sehwag slowed down and 

 let that chance go. He was also within striking distance 

 of the Indian record of fastest hundred (Kapil Dev and Mohammed 

 Azharuddin took 74 balls each). That chance also passed 

 by.

 Sehwag also missed out joining 

 an elite group of four (Victor Trumper, Charles Macartney, 

 Don Bradman and Majid Khan) to have hit a century in the 

 opening session of a Test. Sehwag needed seven from the 

 final over before lunch from Corey Collymore. He upper-cut 

 a four, took a single and then needed two off the final 

 delivery. Sehwag drove it to mid-off, took a quick single 

 and kept going past the non-strikers end when a quick 

 look back would have given him another run as the ball had 

 gone past the stumps.

 Still, his 99 off 75 balls have 

 given India a perfect start after they chose to bat on an 

 extremely slow wicket after winning the toss.

 The stocky opener cut his first 

 delivery from Pedro Collins past backward point to score 

 the first of his 15 fours.

 The fourth over by Jerome Taylor, 

 the eighth of the innings, saw Sehwag flick, drive straight 

 and then steer the young paceman past the ropes.

 In the 12th over of the innings, 

 the second by Bravo, Sehwag hit an inside-out six over long-off, 

 steered and straight drove and then thumped a six over long-on 

 off successive balls to blitz past half-century.

 Jaffer was a mere spectator and 

 hit his first boundary only half an hour before lunch by 

 which time the century partnership was already up in the 

 17th over.

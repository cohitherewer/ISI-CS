 Geoff Marshs son gets call-up 

Melbourne: Shaun Marsh, son of former Australian opener Geoff Marsh, will replace Brad Hodge in Australia As four-day match against India A, beginning in Cairns on Tuesday in the Top End series. 

Hodge suffered a neck injury while batting in Darwin and will return to Melbourne. 

Marsh was picked in the Australia A squad for two matches against Zimbabwe in 2003-04, and last summer he posted five Pura Cup half-centuries and averaged almost 50 in the ING Cup (domestic List A meet in Australia). 

Shaun is a talented young player who we have been monitoring closely for a long time, selector David Boon was quoted as saying by an Australian website.

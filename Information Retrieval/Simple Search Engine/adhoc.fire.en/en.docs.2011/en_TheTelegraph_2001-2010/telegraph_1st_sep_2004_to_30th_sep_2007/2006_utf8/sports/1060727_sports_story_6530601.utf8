 Indian eves in semis

 - Asian Jr Table Tennis

New Delhi: Indian junior girls showed nerves of steel to pull off a 3-2 upset over Chinese Taipei and storm into the semi-finals of the Asian Junior Table Tennis Championship in Kitakyushu, Japan. 

Indias win against fourth seeds Chinese Taipei not only ensured their maiden semi-final appearance in the event but also earned them a spot in the World Junior Championships in Cairo. 

India play China on Thursday for a place in the finals. 

Shamini Kumaresan and Delhis Neha Agarwal were the architects of the victory. 

India started on a losing note as Neha went down 11-8, 6-11, 8-11, 7-11 in the first match against Cheng I Cheng. Shamini then levelled the tie with a 11-7, 5-11, 11-9, 11-9 win over Yuszu Pei. 

Ashlesha Bodas lost the third match Hsiung Mei 7-11, 16-14, 7-11, 5-11 and the scale tilted on Chinese Taipeis favour but Shamini had other ideas. 

Shamini won the close encounter against Cheng to raise hopes in Indian camp. She prevailed 11-7, 5-11, 11-9, 11-7 to put the onus on Neha in the crucial last match. Neha displayed a gutsy performance to beat Yuszu Pei 11-4, 6-11, 11-6, 11-7 and romp home.

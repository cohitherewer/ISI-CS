 Indians look for 3 golds

Chennai: The Indian chess team is hoping to bag at least three golds and a silver when the sport makes its debut at the Asian Games in Doha. 

Our goal is to win as many medals as we can. We expect to win gold and silver in the mens section, first place in womens rapid chess and top honours in the team championship in classical format, said GM Krishnan Sasikiran. 

GMs Pentalya Harikrishna and Koneru Humpy, who were also present during a tete-a-tete at the end of a 10-day camp under GM Lev Borisovich Psakhis, concurred. 

Sasikiran said that as the top seeds, the Indian team will be under enormous pressure. 

We have to concentrate on our game by playing stronger. Medals will come if we perform, he said. (PTI)

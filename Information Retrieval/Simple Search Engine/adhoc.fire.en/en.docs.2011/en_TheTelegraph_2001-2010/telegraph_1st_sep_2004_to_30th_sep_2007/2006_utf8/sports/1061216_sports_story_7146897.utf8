 10-wicket win for Indian eves 

Jaipur: Indian eves continued their march towards a third successive title, crushing Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the womens Asia Cup on Friday. 

Thirush Kamini who scored fine half-century and took two wickets was star of the Indian victory. 

After skipper Mithali Raj elected to bowl, Priti Dimiri (three for 14) and Kamini (two for 38) restricted the visitors to a modest 145 for 8 in 50 overs. 

The hosts then knocked off the required runs without loss in 31.3 overs, with Kamini (60) combining with S. Naik (79) ensured victory for the defending champions. 

India had little trouble in chasing the modest target. 

Naik reached her half-century in 68 balls with eight boundries while Kamini played the sheet-anchore role, reaching her fifty in 87 balls and five fours.

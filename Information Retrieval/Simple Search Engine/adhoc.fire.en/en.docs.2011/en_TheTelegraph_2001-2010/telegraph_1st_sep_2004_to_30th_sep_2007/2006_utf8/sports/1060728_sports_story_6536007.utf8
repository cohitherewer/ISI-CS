 Fallon faces suspension 

 Fallon 

 London: Jockey Kieren Fallons career will be over if a ban on him riding in Britain is upheld, the six-time champion jockeys lawyer told the high court on Thursday.

 Irishman Fallon, 41, was banned by the Horseracing Regulatory Authority (HRA) on July 7 until the conclusion of his trial on criminal charges of conspiracy to defraud in a betting scam. The trial is not expected to take place until next year. Fallon, three times Epsom Derby winner and retained by the Coolmore conglomerate, lost his appeal to the HRA and is seeking to overturn the ban in the High Court. (REUTERS)

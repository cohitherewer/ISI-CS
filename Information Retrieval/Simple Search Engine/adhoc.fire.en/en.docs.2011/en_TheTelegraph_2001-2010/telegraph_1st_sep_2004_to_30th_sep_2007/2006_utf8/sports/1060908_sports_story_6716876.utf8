 Suvrajit upset

Ahmedabad: IM Lanka Ravi of PSPB emerged as sole leader in the 44th National B Chess Championships here after a hard-fought victory over Valay Parikh of Gujarat in the ninth round. 

The victory took Ravi to 8 points out of a possible 9, and the Hyderabad-based player is now half a point ahead of nearest rival Himanshu Sharma of Haryana who ended the party of Suvrajit Saha of Bengal. 

Sharma defeated Suvrajit in another hard-fought affair where the former played black. For Suvrajit, this was the first loss in the event after starting with six straight victories. 

With four rounds still to go in the 13-round event that will select the top 30 for the next National A Chess Championship later this year, as many as eight players, including top seed K. Ratnakaran of Kerala and WGM D. Harika of Andhra Pradesh, share third spot with 7 points. 

Ravi settled for white pieces to demonstrate his positional prowess against local favourite Parikh. Parikh chose an irregular opening set-up but found his position worsening right from the beginning of the middlegame when Ravi exerted pressure.

 Mexico coach thanks crowd

Nuremberg: Ricardo Lavolpe was pleased with his teams performance and thanked a sizeable Mexican contingent in the capacity 41,000 crowd for their vocal support. 

The crowd motivated us, gave us more incentive, Lavolpe told German television. In the second half they got behind us more and for that reason we won. 

Striker Omar Bravo hit two goals to give Mexico a 3-1 win in their World Cup group D opener at the Frankenstadion on Sunday. 

Lavolpe said: We didnt have much control or energy in the first half. In the second, the team started to loosen up and played better touch football. 

Before then they were a bit nervous. We have to keep working, correct some mistakes from the first half, but what gives us most satisfaction are the three points. 

Iran coach Branko Ivankovic said his wards missed their opportunity in the opening period. In the first half we played very well and maybe we could have scored more than one goal, he said.

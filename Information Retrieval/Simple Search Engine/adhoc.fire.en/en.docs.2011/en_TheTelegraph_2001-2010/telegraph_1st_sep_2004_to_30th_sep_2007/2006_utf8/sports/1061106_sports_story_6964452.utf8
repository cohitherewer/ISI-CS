 Ban good for future: Arjuna 

 - He was a wrong man from the beginning to be in cricket 

 Hair 

Colombo: Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga on Sunday welcomed the ICCs decision to ban Australias Darrell Hair from international umpiring, accusing him of anti-Asian bias. 

Hair had a prejudice against Asian teams. I am happy that he is finally out, Ranatunga said. The decision will do good to future cricket. 

The decision to oust Hair was taken at the ICC Executive Boards two-day meeting that ended Saturday in Mumbai following a complaint by the Pakistan Cricket Board. 

Hair has been under pressure since he accused Pakistan of ball tampering during a Test against England at The Oval in August. 

He was a wrong man from the beginning to be in cricket. I am happy that he is finally out, Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to the World Cup title in 1996, said. 

I thank the ICC for taking the decision, which took a long time, but I think the ICC handled him well. They gave him time and chances, and finally it came to be known that he was not a fair umpire, Ranatunga said.

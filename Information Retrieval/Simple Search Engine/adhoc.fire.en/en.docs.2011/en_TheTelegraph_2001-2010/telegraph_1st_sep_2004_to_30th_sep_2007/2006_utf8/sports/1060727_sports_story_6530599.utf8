Stanford: Sania Mirza was upset by little-known Russian qualifier Vasilisa Bardina in straight sets in the first round of the $600,000 WTA Bank of West Classic in Stanford on Tuesday. 

The 42-ranked Sania, who made it into the quarter finals of the Cincinnati Open last week, went down 3-6, 2-6. 

The match was delayed several minutes after the first set due to feedback problems with the stadium speakers. The match proceeded without the chair umpires microphone. 

The 18-year-old Bardina, who broke into the top 100 at No. 98 for the first time, won three qualifying matches at Wimbledon last month to reach her first Grand Slam main draw. She followed that by qualifying here. 

Bardina will play Anna-Lena Groenefeld, who received a bye in the first round of the Tier II hardcourt event. 

Sania is partnering American Bethanie Mattek in doubles and will meet the Russian-Ukrainian pair of Alla Kudryavtseva and Tetiana Luzhanska in the first round. 

US-based Shikha Oberoi and Yelena Jankovic beat Slovak Daniela Hantuchova and Japans Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-4 to sail into the second round of the doubles event. 

Fifth seed Hantuchova, however, was upset in singles play, losing to another qualifier, Shenay Perry, 2-6, 6-0, 3-6. 

Perry, who turned pro in 2000, was the last American to be eliminated at Wimbledon last month, reaching the fourth round. That led to a career-high ranking of No. 49. She had never been ranked higher than 64th. Perry meets Jill Craybas in the second round as the only two Americans left in the event. 

I saw her at Wimbledon so I knew it would be a tough match, Hantuchova said. It was more about me making way too many mistakes and not playing well at all. I know I have a lot of work to do. 

Serbias Jelena Jankovic beat American Lilia Osterloh 7-5, 6-3, to earn a spot in the second round and a match against world No. 2 Kim Clijsters. 

Also, sixth-seeded Sugiyama defeated Czech Kveta Peschke 6-3, 6-4, Australias Samantha Stosur topped Ukrainian qualifier Olga Savchuk 6-1, 6-3.

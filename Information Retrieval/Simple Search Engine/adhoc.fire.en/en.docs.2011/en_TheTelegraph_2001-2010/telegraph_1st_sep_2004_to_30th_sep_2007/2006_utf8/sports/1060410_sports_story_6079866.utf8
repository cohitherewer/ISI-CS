The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: Outgoing PSV Eindhoven coach Guus Hiddink is not in the running to be the next England manager, his agent said on Sunday. ?He definitely won?t be the England manager,? Cees van Nieuwenhuizen told a British TV channel, adding that having a short-listing process was ?a sort of an insult? to the Dutchman. ?In spite of all the rumours he has not been in England and the FA have not been to Holland for a serious interview.?

 Hiddink had been mentioned as a contender to take over from Sven-Goran Eriksson when the Swede quits after the World Cup, which begins in June.

 Van Nieuwenhuizen said the English FA had made an initial approach to Hiddink, who leaves PSV at the end of the season, but had not followed it up.

 Hagi changes mind

 Bucharest: Former Romania great Gheorghe 

 Hagi has decided to stay on as coach of Politehnica Timisoara 

 just hours after announcing he was quitting the first division 

 club on Sunday. Hagi wanted to severe his ties with the 

 club as he felt his players were not trying hard enough.

 Timisoara came back from 0-2 down to draw with CFR Cluj on Saturday but Hagi was critical of the performance and only agreed to return to the helm after midfielders Gabriel Caramarin and Alin Stoica were expelled from the squad.

 ?The club?s board requested Hagi to change his mind about quitting and he agreed after two key players left the squad at his demand,? Politehnica Timisoara general director Ion Craciunescu said over telephone.

 Amsterdam: PSV Eindhoven retained the Dutch league title on Sunday. PSV drew 1-1 with Groningen at home to move on to 80 points with two games left to play. Second-placed AZ Alkmaar lost 0-1 at Ajax Amsterdam and remain on 70 points, also with two matches left. 

 Lyon: Olympique Lyon have effectively already won a record fifth consecutive title as far as coach Gerard Houllier is concerned. ?Objectively, with 15 points to be distributed, it?s won,? Houllier said on Sunday.

 Lyon, who beat Nice 2-1 on Saturday, enjoy a 14-point lead over second-placed Girondins Bordeaux with five games remaining and have a much better goal difference. 

 They need just two points to be sure of beating St Etienne and Olympique Marseille?s record of four successive Ligue 1 titles.

 Paris: World champion Sebastien Loeb, driving a Kronos Citroen, won a second successive victory in the Corsica Rally on Sunday. The Frenchman has now won the last three rallies after victories in Mexico and Spain. Ford driver Marcus Gronholm of Finland finished second, 29 seconds adrift of Loeb.

 Spain?s Dani Sordo, claimied third place in 

 1:48.7.

 Atherton slams BCCI 

London: Former England captain Michael Atherton has criticised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s decision to deviate from future Test programmes, and called the rest of the cricketing world to firmly stand behind the International Cricket Council (ICC) on the issue. 

The BCCI had recently announced that it will play Australia every year on a home and away basis between 2007 and 2009 and that it would not participate in the Champions Trophy from 2007 onwards as the host nation was recurring losses. 

In his column in a daily, Atherton termed the BCCI as big beast of cricket and compared its strong posturing against the ICC to some of the superpower nations bullying the United Nations. 

The whole point of the Champions Trophy is to provide funds for developing areas and the FTP is aimed at giving less well-off nations, such as Bangladesh and the West Indies, a chance to compete. 

India, on the other hand, are acting as superpowers tend to act: self-interest first and last and bugger the rest.

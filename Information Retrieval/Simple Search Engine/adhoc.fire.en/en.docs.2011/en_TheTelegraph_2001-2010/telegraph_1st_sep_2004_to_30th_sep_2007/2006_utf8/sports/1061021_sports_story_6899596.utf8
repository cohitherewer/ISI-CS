 Muthiah justifies move 

 Ban on Azhar 

Chennai: former BCCI chief A.C. Muthiah justified on Friday the ban slapped on ex captain Mohammed Azharuddin and some other cricketers in 2001 for their alleged involvement in match-fixing, saying the decision was taken after consulting the Central Bureau of Investigation and a top sleuth. 

I decided to ban Azhar and some other cricketers after consulting the CBI which had inquired into the matter, said Muthiah.

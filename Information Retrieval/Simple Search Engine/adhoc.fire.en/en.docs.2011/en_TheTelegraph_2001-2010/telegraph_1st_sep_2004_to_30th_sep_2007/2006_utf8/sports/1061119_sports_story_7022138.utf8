 RCTC finance head resigns 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Close on the heels of the resignations of two RCTC stewards Gen (rtrd.) Shankar Roychowdhury and J.N. Sapru a senior administrative functionary has followed suit. An RCTC insider informed that the chief financial officer (CFO), Ms Anurita Ghosh, has put in her papers, fearing being indicted for the clubs fund mismanagement. 

 Sources close to the CFO, however, insist that her marriage, early next month, is the real reason for her quitting. The CFO, it is learnt, will be tying the knot at the racecourse with the clubs handicapper, Amit Chaturvedi, on December 8. She could not be contacted for comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB SGM likely in Feb.

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: With the opposition almost certain to contest, the ruling group in CAB are pinning hopes on Biswanath Dutts charisma on the Maidan. Even if there are elections, Dutt will be our candidate, a top CAB official said. 

Though the formal announcement of the date of the special general body meeting will be made on January 5, it is likely to be held in the first week of February. 

Meanwhile, the opposition, led by city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, have already started their planning though the city police chief is not willing to make any comment. 

Now I am too busy with the Singur issue, and will chalk out our future plans shortly, Mukherjee told The Telegraph on Thursday.

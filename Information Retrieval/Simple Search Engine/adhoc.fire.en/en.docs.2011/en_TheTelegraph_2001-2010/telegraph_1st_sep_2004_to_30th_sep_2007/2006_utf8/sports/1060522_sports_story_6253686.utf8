 Jeev ends tied 31st

Okayama (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singhs streak of top-10 came to an end as he finished tied 31st despite four birdies on the back nine in the final round of the KSB Munsingwear Open in Okayama. 

Jeev had five birdies, four of them on the back nine, but he also dropped far too many including a double bogey and three other bogeys to finish with a par round of 72. 

Jeev, who was affected by flu this week, shot 71, 70 and 71 in earlier rounds. 

Toshinuri Muto, 28, who was six shots off the lead overnight, shot a superb eight-under 64 to take the title, two shots clear of Eiji Mizoguchi (70). 

Shingo Katayama (69), Mamo Osanai (70) and overnight leader, Kiyoshi Miyazoto (74) were tied for third. 

It was Mutos maiden Japan Tour title and his previous bests were two ninth places at the gateway to the Open, Mizuno Open and Sun Chlorella last year. He came through the Qualifying School in 2004. 

This was Jeevs third appearance on the Japan Tour this season. He was 10th at Crowns and tied fifth at Japan PGA Championships. 

He will move on to play the BMW Championships in Wentworth next week.

 Atwal shares 24th spot

 - That wasnt good at all 

 Atwal was let down by his putting 

Los Angeles: Let down by his trusty putter at the Bob Hope Classic, Indias Arjun Atwal knows he needs to improve his performance on the greens at this weeks Buick Invitational in San Diego. 

The best putter on last years PGA Tour, Atwal struggled to find the hole on his way to a share of 24th place at the Bob Hope Classic on Sunday. 

Despite ending the 90-hole event on top of the greens in regulation charts, he finished 12 strokes behind winner Chad Campbell after scores of 70, 67, 70, 70 and 70. 

That was not good at all, a frustrated Atwal said on Monday. I am leaving a lot of shots out there. I felt like I hit the ball really well all week but I putted awful. Thats not like me. 

I normally putt pretty well, added the 32-year-old, who headed the putting category on the 2005 PGA Tour with an average of 1.710 putts per round. I hit a lot of good putts at the Bob Hope so its nothing to do with the stroke. It was just a few miss-reads and a case of being a little unlucky, I guess. 

Atwal, who missed just one cut in 17 starts on the US Tour last year, plans to play in the next three events. 

Im definitely going to play San Diego, Phoenix and Pebble. I might take Los Angeles and Tucson off until the Florida swing (in early March). 

I want to play over here as much as I can because I havent played that much in the last three months, only three events. 

Having finished a career-high 82nd in the 2005 PGA Tour money list, Atwal has set his sights on a maiden victory this year. (Reuters)

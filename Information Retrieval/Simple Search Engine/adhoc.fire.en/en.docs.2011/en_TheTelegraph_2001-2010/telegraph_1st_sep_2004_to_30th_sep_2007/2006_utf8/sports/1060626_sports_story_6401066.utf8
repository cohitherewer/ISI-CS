 Carlos game for sitting on bench

Bergisch Gladbach: Brazils Roberto Carlos said on Saturday he was not worried about the prospect of sitting on the bench, saying it was the coachs decision. 

The 33-year-old left back sat out Thursdays 4-1 win over Japan. 

Ive got long history of playing for Brazil and Im not going to start worrying at this stage about whether Im going to play or not, he told reporters. 

Im well, Im really happy, and Im happy for Gilberto, not just for the goal but for the opportunity he had. He did his job really well. 

Im part of a group of 23 players and its the coach who decides who plays and who doesnt. I sat there nice and relaxed on the bench. 

Carlos extolled the virtues of the Brazilian team on Sunday, saying the world champions were ahead of the rest even when it came to spying on the opponents. In Spain, people ask me why we study the opposition if were already the best in the world, he said. 

I tell them that the Brazilians are always looking to get better. Weve got spies everywhere. They show us everything, attacking and defensive positioning, with or without the ball. (Agencies)

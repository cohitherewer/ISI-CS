 Surya blames lack of team spirit

 Chess Olympiad Debacle

 Surya Sekhar Ganguly 

 New Delhi: Poor team spirit 

 and a below-par performance by spearhead Grandmaster Viswanathan 

 Anand were to be blamed for Indias dismal performance 

 at the recent Chess Olympiad, a senior member and an official 

 of the team said.

 The Indian men went into the Olympiad, 

 played in Turin, as the second seeds and finished a poor 

 30th.

 Anand could register only a 50 

 per cent score from his nine games but another key member 

 of the team, Surya Sekhar Ganguly, felt that lack of team 

 spirit was an equally important factor.

 I think our spirit as a 

 team lacked a bit. Anand was staying in a hotel from day 

 one and Sasikiran also decided to stay on his own after 

 reaching Turin, Surya said.

 I personally feel they were 

 right in their decisions as the accommodation provided to 

 us was sub-standard, the national champion added.

 Suryas point was echoed 

 by Bharat Singh Chauhan, treasurer of the All India Chess 

 Federation and Asian zone president, who was present in 

 Turin in his capacity as the Indian womens team coach.

 There was no team spirit, 

 it is not easy to win a medal in such tough competition 

 unless you perform extremely well as a team. We are looking 

 for ways to make sure it does not happen in future, 

 Chauhan said.

 Asked why he did not stay in a 

 hotel or the whole team for that matter, Surya said the 

 hotels were quite expensive and he could not afford it on 

 his own.

 For the first time, the Indian 

 team had a sponsor in Canara Bank and each team member according 

 to his or her rating was given a pay cheque for the Olympiad.

 While Anand got Rs 5 lakh for 

 his participation, both K. Sasikiran and P. Harikrishna 

 were given Rs 75,000 each. Surya, Sandipan Chanda and Koneru 

 Humpy got Rs 50,000 apiece.

 The Indian men had gone to Turin 

 high on medal hopes but none of six members could perform 

 to the level of their Elo ratings and as a result will lose 

 important rating points after the disaster.

 The biggest shock from the Indian 

 perspective was world No.2 Anand.

 We had been obviously hoping 

 for Anand to score at least plus-four or plus-five as it 

 was important for the team that the mainstay scores well, 

 pointed out Surya before adding that unfortunately 

 no one played to his potential.

 According to Harikrishna, both 

 Anand and Sasikiran were probably tired after having played 

 gruelling tournaments just before the Olympiad.

 Harikrishna also said the food 

 was a problem. It was just not suitable for me, 

 he said.

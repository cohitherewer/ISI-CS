Los Angeles: Tommy Haas clinched his third ATP title of the season with a 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory over Russias Dmitry Tursunov at the Los Angeles Open Sunday. 

Outplayed in the opening set, the 28-year-old German fought back to preserve his unbeaten record against the Russian and win the hard court event for a second time in three years. 

Its an awesome feeling and the end of a great week for me, Haas told reporters after sealing victory in two hours and four minutes. 

At the end of the second set he (Tursunov) was going for it a little bit more, maybe thinking this would be his first title. But I kept telling myself to hold my serve and wait for opportunities. 

After I won the second set, I felt I had the momentum going into the third set. 

Sixth seed Haas, who eased past Slovakias Dominik Hrbaty in straight sets in the semi-finals, never looked back after breaking Tursunov for the first time in the 12th game of the second set. 

After levelling the match, the world No. 21 broke the Russian again in the second game of the deciding set before serving out to clinch the 10th ATP title of his career. 

Haas, who won hardcourt tournaments this year at Delray Beach and Memphis before suffering a wrist injury in April, fired down 12 aces to the Russians 10 and converted two of his seven breakpoints.

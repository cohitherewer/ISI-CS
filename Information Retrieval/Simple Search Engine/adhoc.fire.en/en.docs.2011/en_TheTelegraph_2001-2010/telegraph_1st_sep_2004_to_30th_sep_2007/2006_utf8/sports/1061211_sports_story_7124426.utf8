 Shoaib skips domestic tie

 Shoaibs trip to SA is in doubt now 

Karachi: Pakistani fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, who has got entangled in a dope scandal, missed out on a four-day Patrons Trophy match for his employers KRL on Sunday raising fresh doubts over whether the selectors would be willing to select him for the South Africa tour without testing his match fitness and form. 

Shoaib, who was cleared of doping charges and had a two-year ban set aside by a appeals tribunal of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last Tuesday, was expected to turn out for KRL in the match here. 

But without assigning any reason, he gave it a miss. His fellow pacer Mohammed Asif, who was also cleared of doping charges and had a ban overturned, however, played in a one-day practice game. But, since his department is out of the competition he cant play any first class matches. 

Both the players have shown their willingness to play in the domestic Twenty20 Cup tournament beginning from December 21, but indications are that the selectors would finalise and announce the touring squad for South Africa before the tournament. 

It is an uncertain situation specially where Shoaib is concerned. In Asifs case, he is living at the National Cricket Academy and has been training there, so we know where his fitness stands. But Shoaib has not played any competitive cricket since August, a national selector said. 

Asif is also being considered for the fifth one-dayer against the West Indies. 

In a related development, the PCB has held discussions with its panel of lawyers anticipating a move from the World Anti-Doping Agency over the appeals tribunal to clear the two bowlers of doping charges.

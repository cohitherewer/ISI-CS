The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Results are important, but its more about the legacy Im going to leave behind

 Buchanan opens up months before his long innings as Australias coach comes to an end 

 A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 John Buchanan 

Mumbai: The John Buchanan era, which began exactly seven years ago, has seen the Australians emerge big-time world beaters. The Queenslanders innings ends after five months and Sundays Champions Trophy final will mark his last day as coach in the subcontinent. Buchanan, who has had a truly phenomenal run (64 Test wins with a success percentage of 75-plus and 141 in ODIs, at over 73), spoke to The Telegraph for well over an hour. 

The following are excerpts 

Q The recent tri-series in Kuala Lumpur was your first assignment in the last season as coach. What were your emotions when you landed in the Malaysian capital? 

 lsquo;Visibly, at least, he rsquo;s a more democratic captain than Steve... He rsquo;s emotional... That Ricky got the captaincy 

 at a younger age means he rsquo;s going to be around longer... rsquo; 

A Not any different from what theyve been over the past many years... Each tournament or series is important... Each match remains important. I know my end is getting near, but Im not thinking of that. What Im thinking about is what I need to do at this point in time. 

Despite a terrific innings, though, do you still want to step it up a bit in the closing months? 

Yes and no... Obviously, I would like to end on a good note and weve got big commitments coming up: The Ashes, the World Cup... I would like to believe in fairytales, but they only come true for children... 

Were you apprehensive when you got the job? 

A bit, because there were just a couple of players from Queensland... At the same time, there had been a great deal of excitement as to what could be done with a great team... Steve Waugh was himself a relatively new captain at that point, but I had his backing... I believed the team had only been scratching the surface. 

How do you look back on your soon-to-end innings? 

 lsquo;Steve was one for history, tradition... His own place in history as well... He led by example and was incredibly tough mentally... He was rightly called the lsquo;Ice Man rsquo;... A 

 decisive captain... rsquo;

I try not to look back in terms of results... Results are important, but its more about the kind of legacy Im going to leave behind... Also, the kind of impact I may have had... The contribution Ive made... Its difficult making a complete assessment while Im still in the job, but Im happy with the systems and processes in place... If Im disappointed, its that I havent been able to tap-in into something which wouldve revolutionised the game. 

Whats your definition of success? 

Its usually defined by the results... Thats the bottomline... The results, however, are the end product of the real success the systems and processes which have contributed. My attention has always been on the systems and processes, for if thats taken care of, then the results look after themselves. 

Is there a formula for success? 

(Grins) In a general sense, you need talent... You need to identify and nurture that talent... Youve got to have a vision or picture for your team or organisation... Also, youve got to keep challenging that talent... Gettiing the talented to do even better... The environment around the group is important. Of course, theres a need for constant review. 

Have you, ever, been upset by talk that somebody with Test experience alone ought to be doing the coachs job? 

 lsquo;He rsquo;s (Warne) an incredible performer... Irrespective of everything that keeps happening in his life, he rsquo;s still able to take the stage and shut 

 everything off. It rsquo;s an amazing trait rsquo;

Whats interesting is that coaching is a hard job to define... Sometimes, its not the right job description... A lot of it is technical when youre working with junior players, but the coachs role develops by itself, depending on the environment... At the highest level, one has to handle the mental, physical and tactical side... One has to understand that cricket is an individual sport dressed up in team clothing... A lot of things, therefore, fall under the umbrella. People tend to be critical without really understanding the job. 

Thats fine, but would it have been easier had you been a former Test player? 

One of the advantages I had was that I was an unsuccessful first-class cricketer... It taught me a lot about an individual wanting to be among the best, but not understanding himself... Whether youre a successful international player or a non-performing one at the club level, some of the basics dont change... A coach has to tap-in and understand the times when a player is feeling good and the times when he isnt... What is the appropriate time to speak to a player? Am I the most appropriate person to talk? Answers are needed. 

You obviously believe theres a use-by date for coaches? 

 lsquo;I rsquo;ve always had a soft corner for somebody like Andrew Symonds... He rsquo;s an amazing athlete and some of the things he does are incredible. In principle, I don rsquo;t like making special mentions rsquo;

My shelf life is almost over... To my mind, its determined by three things... First, having the ability to impact on the players individually and the team collectively; then, whether the drive and energy is still there to make that happen and, finally, retaining the respect of the team... I wont lose the respect (by the end of the World Cup), but the impact I can make has begun to decrease... I wont say my energy for the job has begun to lessen, but I would like to devote that to my family... 

How will you keep yourself busy after the World Cup? 

I would like to stay involved with cricket... Perhaps, be a mentor-coach... Develop new thinking where coaching is concerned... Probably act as coach in the corporate world, work with the CEOs and so on... See how an organisation could get better in the field of its expertise. 

You dont say goodbye till April, but have you envisaged your last day in the dressing room? 

Its going to be a sad day... The last day of the Ashes will also be sad, for I wont work with the Test specialists any more... My children have been part of this Australian team and theyve been asking why dont I keep coaching... For the last seven years, theyve spent Christmas with the boys. Theyve grown up with the team... Parting company is going to be difficult. 

Because of the quality of the Australian team, havent you been under more pressure as everybody expects you to be the coach who cant lose? 

Yes, there are internal and external pressures... Its unexpected of us to perform badly... Ive never been driven by results... If I was, I would be stressed out all the time... Im definitely worried about the next game, but that has more to do with the preparations... Ive never got too wound up, thereby reducing some of the pressure... Whether the calls are hard or not, one likes to make them correctly. 

Whats the vision you set out with? 

I came with an open mind, yes, but Ive stuck to my vision of striving to be The Invincibles, of taking our game to the next level... Theres that historical link to being The Invincibles, as (Sir Don) Bradmans team of 1948 had that label... 

The next level is... 

Getting consistently better with the skills... For the next level, new skills and new strategies are needed... In my opinion, Douglas Jardine took the game to a new level... The bodyline thing... More recently, Clive Lloyd used four fast bowlers to slow down the game... You know youve changed the game when the regulators start coming in and saying you cant do that... Individuals like Shane Warne and Adam Gilchrist have brought about changes in their area of expertise... The Twenty20 format will surely bring about some changes. 

But the bowlers arent happy with Twenty20... 

Theyve got to respond to the challenge. 

Have you, over the past seven years, been influenced by any one person? 

Not anybody in particular, but I like Edward De Bonos approach... Challenging the way we think and, hopefully, changing our way of thinking... Also (American) Mike Young, our fielding coach... 

Youve enjoyed phenomenal success, but what brought more disappointment losing to India in India five years ago or losing the Ashes in England last year? 

Whats most disappointing is not playing to potential... That hurts... Losing the Ashes was disappointing, but more disappointing was the manner in which we lost... There are times when the opposition dictates the way you play... (After a pause) What I like most about this team is that it enjoys being challenged... It wants to be challenged... In the Ashes, though, we werent up to it. You cant leave it till youre behind in the game to demonstrate skill and ability. 

Who is the most gifted cricketer youve worked with? 

Look, each one has had something special... The Glenn McGraths, the Gilchrists... Personally, Ive always had a soft corner for somebody like Andrew Symonds... Hes an amazing athlete and some of the things he does are incredible. In principle, I dont like making special mentions. 

Has handling Warne been difficult? 

At times, weve had differences of opinion... Its a healthy thing, for I would the team to include players who want to question... (Adds laughing) Sometimes, you would wish an opinion wasnt expressed publicly, but... Shane says what he thinks and we understand where he stands... Thats important... Hes an incredible performer... Irrespective of everything that keeps happening in his life, hes still able to take the stage and shut everything off. Its an amazing trait. 

On a regular basis, youve worked with two superb captains Steve and Ricky Ponting. Whats your assessment of them? 

Steve was one for history, tradition... His own place in history as well... He led by example and was incredibly tough mentally... He was rightly called the Ice Man... A quiet person, who needed to know somebody well before trusting that person... A decisive captain... Ricky isnt necessarily too different... Has the same tough, competitive characteristics... Visibly, at least, hes a more democratic captain than Steve... Hes emotional... That Ricky got the captaincy at a younger age means hes going to be around longer... He may finish if not as the best Australian captain, then on a par with the ones acknowledged as the best. 

Over the years, who has been the boss in the dressing room? 

(Grins again) Ive consistently maintained that Im coach to the captain of the team... Nothing more... My job is to ensure the captain has the best prepared team at his disposal. A coach, then, is there to support... The way cricket is structured, the captain has to be the boss. 

The final question: Many names are doing the rounds. Who do you think is best suited to succeed you? 

Ill be leaving a good legacy and the next person must have the desire to expand it and take it further. It could be anybody. However, whoever gets the job, should be himself... A coach has to first understand himself and be clear about what he wants to achieve... (Adds a tad emotionally) I would like to be remembered as somebody who tried to enhance the role of coaches... Get more recognition for them... I hope to stay in touch with the players, have a beer with them whenever I want to.

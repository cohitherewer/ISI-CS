 Mahroof guides Lanka to 84-run win

Chandigarh: Farveez Mahroof struck an unbeaten 81 as Sri Lanka recovered from a top-order collapse to register a convincing 84-run victory over PCA Presidents XI in a warm-up match for the Champions Trophy here Thursday. 

Electing to bat, the Sri Lankans were precariously placed at 144 for six before the hard-hitting Mahroof bailed the team out with his 88-ball knock to steer the islanders to a competitive 267 for eight in their allotted 50 overs. 

The hosts managed 183 for seven with Pankaj Dharmani top scoring with 56.

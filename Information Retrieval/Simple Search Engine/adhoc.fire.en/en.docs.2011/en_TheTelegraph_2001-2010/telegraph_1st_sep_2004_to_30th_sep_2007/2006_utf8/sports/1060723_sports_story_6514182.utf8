The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Oppositions vision for state

 - Normalcy with BCCI will be restored, promises challenger Mukherjee 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The opposition has dismissed doubts over the authenticity of Sourav Gangulys e-mail in their support, saying it was genuine and beyond any doubt. A 25-point agenda, revealing their vision for state cricket, was also released on Saturday. 

The e-mail was addressed to Sanjay Chatterjee, who is Souravs maternal uncle. He has been co-operating with us in our preparation for the elections, said a candidate on Prasun Mukherjees panel. 

Snehasish (Souravs brother) is sitting here. Had it not been genuine, do you think he would have released it? Mukherjee maintained. 

Announcing his panel, the police commissioner ? who is fighting for the presidents post ? ruled out any compromise with the ruling group. 

I personally met representatives of at least 94 clubs. Ive come to understand their aspirations and requirements, and having discussed a lot of issues with them Im hopeful well win, Mukherjee said.Incidentally, Nemai Charan Dutta of Howrah Sporting was present during the press meet. He is featuring as one of the vice-presidents on the panel of both camps. 

Mukherjee also pointed out that one of his top priorities, if he wins the elections, would be to get the BCCIs financial sanctions on the CAB lifted. At least 80 per cent of CABs income depends on the BCCIs grants. But since a sanction is in place now, its affecting CAB in all respects. If we come to power, Ill try to settle the issue with the BCCI, he said. 

He also said bringing big matches to the Eden would be one of his preliminary aims. I know BCCI has a rotation policy. But if you notice, its not always followed, Mukherjee said. 

Will he initiate any probe into the Dalmiya affair if hes elected? Its a hypothetical question. But Ill definitely try to bring CABs relationship with BCCI back to normal, Mukherjee said.

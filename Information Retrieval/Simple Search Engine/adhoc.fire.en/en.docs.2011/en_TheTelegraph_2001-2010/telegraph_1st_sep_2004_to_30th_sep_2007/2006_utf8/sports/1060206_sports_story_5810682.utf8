 Momentum with Pak, as India seek to open account on tour

 - The swelling (on right index finger) hasnt subsided... I dont see myself playing: Harbhajan 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Peshawar: Except winning, the Indians have done everything on this tour ? gifting chocolates to cancer-stricken kids at the Shaukat Khanum, interacting with the one and only Jahangir Khan and making a trip to the Khyber Pass. 

With just the five-match ODI series (for the Hutch Cup) remaining, Rahul Dravids team needs to quickly open account. Its not going to be easy as Pakistan are on a high after the stunning win in Karachi. 

Much is made of the difference between the conventional and the shorter version of cricket, but the momentum factor cant be discounted. Moreover, Pakistan are gunning for the No. 2 spot in the ICC rankings. 

The Indians are placed fifth, two behind the hosts. 

Dravid, of course, believes rankings dont matter as what counts is the performance on the given day. Im aware of the recent statistics against Pakistan (eight losses in ten ODIs), but... As for pressure, its always there... At the international level, it cant be otherwise... Youve got to perform... 

In the Indian captains view, the team which bowls better in tough, flat conditions will have an advantage. Well, the Arbab Niaz Stadium wicket looks a belter and the boundaries seem short. So, the Shahid Afridis and Mahendra Singh Dhonis could have a ball. 

Asked whether the switch from Tests to ODIs ? after only a four-day break ? was demanding, Dravid replied: The adjustment is more mental... The kind of shots to play... The players, though, are experienced and one gets used to it... 

The Indians have four new faces, including the tried and tested Mohammed Kaif. Younger players and fresher legs make a difference, Dravid observed. He confirmed Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag would open. 

While the team management is hoping Harbhajan Singh gets fit, the offie told The Telegraph late on Sunday: The swelling (on the right index finger) hasnt subsided... I dont see myself playing... 

Harbhajans maiden tour of Pakistan ? he missed the one in 2003-04 owing to surgery ? has actually been a nightmare. He went wicketless in the first two Tests and got dropped in Karachi. Fielding as a substitute there, he got injured. I cant recall how I got hurt... Samajh mein nahin aa raha... 

Inzamam-ul Haq, meanwhile, has declared Pakistan have a thin edge. Under pressure to play the local boys ? Arshad Khan and Umar Gul ? he said they would be included agar jagah banti hai. As of now, Gul isnt a contender, while Arshad could be the super sub. 

[Vice-captain Younis Khan and Shahid Afridi also have their roots around here. Mere to utne supporters shayad nahin aayen ge, Shahid ke fans bahut rahen ge, quipped Younis.] 

Both Inzamam and Dravid, by the way, arent happy that the super sub has to be identified before the toss. Greg Chappells take isnt clear, but Bob Woolmer wants this experiment to end. Imran Khan, too. 

National selector Sanjay Jagdale has arrived. He got in rather late as his flight from Lahore was delayed.

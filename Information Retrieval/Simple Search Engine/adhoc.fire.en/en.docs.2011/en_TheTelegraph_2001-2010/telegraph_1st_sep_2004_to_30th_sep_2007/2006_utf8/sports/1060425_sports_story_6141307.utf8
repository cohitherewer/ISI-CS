 Advocaats striking dilemma 

With little over three weeks to go before squad lists are finalised for the World Cup Germany, the question on everyones lips in the South Korea is who will replace the injured Lee Dong-Gook in the Taeguk Warriors attack. 

Though Lee underwent successful surgery on his injured knee in Frankfurt, it will be at least six months before the striker is back in action. His absence leaves South Korea coach Dick Advocaat with something of a dilemma, as he must now find a replacement for his star forward before announcing his squad for Germany on 15 May. 

The Dutchman has said he will name his 23-man squad on four days before the deadline but this latest development means that Advocaat must either take another look at the homegrown talent playing in the K-League, or improvise with the teams European-based players. 

Lee Young-Mu, chairman of the KFAs technical committee, said he would be recommending that newcomer Woo Sung-Yong of Seongnam be considered for the vacant strikers berth. Woo is the leading scorer in the K-League with seven goals to his name.

 Johl stays in touch with a 70

Sanya (China): A gritty two-under par 70 helped Amandeep Johl stay in touch with the leaders at the Crowne Plaza Open. After three days of action at the Yalong Bay Golf Club, all six Indians are among the top-25. 

Johl held on for a one-over 37 and finished with a 70 that put him in tied sixth place at 10-under 206, five strokes off leader Chinarat Phadsungil. 

While SSP Chowrasia rose from tied 34th to tied 19th with a four-under 68, Gaurav Ghei (70) slid from tied ninth to tied 13th. Harmeet Kahlon (73) dropped from tied ninth to tied 23rd. (PTI)

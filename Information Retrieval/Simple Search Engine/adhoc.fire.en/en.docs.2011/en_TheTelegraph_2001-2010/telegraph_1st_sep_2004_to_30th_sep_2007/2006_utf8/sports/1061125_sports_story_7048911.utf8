 Jeev drops to 2nd spot

 - Michelle Wie misses cut 

Kochi (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh turned in a tidy back-nine, with three birdies and no bogeys, for three-under 69 and was placed second in the second round of the 140 million yen Casio World Open here. Jeev now totals nine-under 133. 

The Indian ace, the overnight joint leader, was overtaken by Tetsuya Haraguchi, who had shared the lead with him. Haraguchi shot a four-under 68 and was 10-under 132 to be one shot ahead. 

Hideki Kase (69) was third at eight-under, while the trio of Toshimori Muto (68), Shinichi Yokota (68) and Azumo Yano (71) was in tied fourth place at seven-under 135. 

Jeev, who has finished in the top-10 ten times in Japan this season, had a birdie on first and seventh but he also bogeyed fourth and seventh to be even at the turn. 

On the back-nine, he birdied 11th, 12th and 18th to come three-under. Thats as satisfying. I am still in touch, said Jeev. 

Jeev had his first three putt of the tournament on fourth and said, the putting was a little off mark. He needed 31 putts as against 29 on first day. There is still two more rounds to go, added Jeev, who is now 12th on Japan money list. 

Michelle Wie missed the cut for the 11th time in 12 professional mens events after a nervous 80 left her at 17 over par on Friday. 

The Honolulu schoolgirl had faced a near impossible task after equalling her worst score in a mens event with a nine-over 81 in freezing rain on Thursday.

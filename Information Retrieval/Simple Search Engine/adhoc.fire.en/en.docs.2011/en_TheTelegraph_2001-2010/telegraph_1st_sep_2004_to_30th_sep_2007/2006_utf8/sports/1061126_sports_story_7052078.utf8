 Nel: Zaheer a quality bowler

Cape Town: South Africas in-your-face fast bowler Andre Nel cast doubts on Munaf Patels fitness on Saturday and wondered if the fast bowler was carrying an injury. 

Munaf has been ruled out of the third ODI with a sore left ankle but Nel believed the problem was perhaps deeper. We think Patel is injured and is not bowling as quick as we thought he would. Everybody says hes the next quick bowling hope but he is not so at the moment, Nel said. 

Nel, however, felt that the Indians carry a reasonable attack. Theyre not bad, theyre different. Two left-armers and Sreesanth have quite decent pace and bowl in good areas. Its a good, balanced attack and if they can get the basics right and get used to the conditions, I think they can be effective. 

Nel also approved of Zaheer Khans return to the Indian side. I havent followed what has happened with Indian cricket but Zaheer has always bowled quite well in the past and he is good in the death overs for them. He is a quality bowler and deserves to be in the side. 

Despite doing so well for South Africa in the second one-day International, Nel rates the Indian batting highly and especially Sachin Tendulkar whom he dismissed cheaply in the second tie in Durban. (PTI)

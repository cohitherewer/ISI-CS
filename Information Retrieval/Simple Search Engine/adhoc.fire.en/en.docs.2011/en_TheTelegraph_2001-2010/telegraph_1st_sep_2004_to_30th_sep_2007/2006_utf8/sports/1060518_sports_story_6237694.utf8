 Lahm undergoes surgery on elbow

 Philipp Lahm takes a tumble during the friendly vs Luckenwalde in Mannheim on Tuesday 

Cagliari: Germany defender Philipp Lahm will not return to full training for two weeks because of his elbow injury but the World Cup hosts are confident he will be fit for the June 9-July 9 tournament. 

The 22-year-old Lahm, who is Juergen Klinsmanns first choice at left back, tore tendons in his left elbow after falling awkwardly in a practice match in Germany on Tuesday. 

While his teammates enjoyed the start of a five-day training camp in Sardinia on Wednesday, Lahm was undergoing surgery in Munich. The operation was a success, the German federation said, and he is scheduled to leave hospital on Thursday. He will miss the five-day stay in Cagliari but should be fit enough to fly out to Geneva for the second leg of the squads preparations from May 21 to 30. 

He will be able to resume running in three days and full training in 14 days, Germanys assistant coach Joachim Loew said on Wednesday. We assume he will be at the World Cup. There are no plans at the moment to call up a replacement. 

Lahms injury spoiled what was an otherwise enjoyable 7-0 victory over amateur club Luckenwalde on Tuesday, a 60-minute exhibition match that was supposed to see the team off to Italy in good spirits. 

Centre back Christoph Metzelder and midfielder Sebastian Kehl also have injury problems but should be at or near full fitness by the time the team reaches Geneva. 

They are both well on the way, said Loewe, who added captain Michael Ballack was suffering with light flu. 

Germany have friendly internationals lined up against Luxembourg on May 27, Japan on May 30 and Colombia on June 2. (Reuters)

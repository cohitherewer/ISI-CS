The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Everton rout Liverpool 

 Premier League

 Johnson scored a 

 brace 

 London: Champions Chelsea 

 beat bogey team Charlton Athletic 2-1, Everton trounced 

 Liverpool 3-0 in the Merseyside derby and Arsenal drew 1-1 

 with 10-man Middlesbrough in Saturdays Premier League 

 action.

 On a difficult day for pre-season 

 title favourites, Chelsea secured victory with a deflected 

 Ricardo Carvalho header and needed a potential equaliser 

 for Charlton by Marcus Bent to be ruled off-side.

 Liverpool were cut down to size 

 by England striker Andrew Johnson, who scored twice for 

 Everton, while a faltering Arsenal were heading for another 

 defeat before Thierry Henry converted a penalty, soon after 

 a red card for Boros George Boateng.

 It somehow finished 0-0 between 

 Sheffield United and Blackburn Rovers despite three penalties 

 being awarded, Fulham came from behind for a 2-1 win at 

 Newcastle United and Gary Speed converted a stoppage-time 

 penalty to give Bolton Wanderers a 1-0 win over Watford.

 Chelsea will be glad just to have 

 taken three points off a side which caused them trouble 

 last term.

 Charlton, the only side to deny 

 Chelsea a home league win last season and who also dumped 

 them out of the League Cup, were constantly on the back 

 foot after Didier Drogba gave the champions a sixth-minute 

 lead.

 But Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink took 

 advantage of some lax defending to equalise in the 54th 

 minute.

 Chelsea gave a big welcome soon 

 afterwards to left-back Ashley Cole, making his debut as 

 a substitute after his move from Arsenal.

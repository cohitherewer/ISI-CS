 Sanaths date with new-born 

Colombo: Sri Lankas opening 

 batsman Sanath Jayasuriya managed to take time off from 

 his teams tour of India for the ongoing Champions 

 Trophy to see his new-born son here. 

Its a great feeling and I was keen to get back home to see the baby, Jayasuriya said on Sunday as he prepared to depart after seeing his wife and son, both of whom were doing well. 

I was at the hospital when my other two kids were born, but couldnt make it this time as it was on the day of a match. These things happen in a cricketers life, he said. 

 Jayasuriyas wife, Sandra, gave birth to their 

 third child on Friday afternoon when Sri Lanka were playing 

 New Zealand. 

Irfan brother in verbal duel 

Ahmedabad: Irfan Pathans elder brother was on Sunday involved in a verbal altercation with security personnel at the team hotel, police said. 

The altercation broke out when the securitymen stopped Irfans brother, Yusuf, from entering the hotel without the required clearance, policemen escorting the team said. 

However, no complaint has been registered in this connection, police said. 

Gayle disappointed 

Ahmedabad: Dashing West Indies allrounder Chris Gayle is disappointed by the fine imposed on him by an ICC Match Referee for arguing with Australian batsman Michael Clarke as he believes such banters are part of the game. 

Gayle said Clarke should have also been heard in the same meeting which was conducted after West Indies stunned Australia on Wednesay. 

Im unable to speak about it in any real detail as I might be fined again and go home with no money! But I would just say that I was disappointed by the fact I was fined 30 per cent of my match fee and that we should both have been in the meeting together but they were conducted separately, quot; Gayle said in a column on a cricket website.

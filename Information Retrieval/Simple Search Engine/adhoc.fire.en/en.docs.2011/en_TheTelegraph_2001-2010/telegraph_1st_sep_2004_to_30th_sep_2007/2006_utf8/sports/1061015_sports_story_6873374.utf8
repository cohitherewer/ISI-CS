Mumbai: Paceman Farvez Mahroofs maiden five-wicket haul paved the way for Sri Lankas nine-wicket victory over defending champions West Indies to top the qualifying phase of the Champions Trophy on Saturday. 

The 22-year-old allrounder claimed a career-best six for 14 off nine overs to skittle West Indies for 80 in 30.4 overs in the final qualifying day-night match. 

 Opener Sanath Jayasuriya cracked 

 a 47-ball 45 not out as Sri Lanka sped to the paltry target 

 in 13.2 overs. 

Sri Lanka join former champions 

 New Zealand, Pakistan and South Africa in one half of the 

 main rounds, while the West Indies will be bunched with 

 world champions Australia, hosts India and England. 

 Man-of-the-Match Maharoof dismissed Brian Lara, Dwayne Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Dwayne Smith, Carlton Baugh and Wavell Hinds in the space of 38 deliveries to rip open West Indies brittle middle-order. 

Fantastic, one cant ask for more. My hard work paid off, said Mahroof after returning the tournaments best figures, bettering Pakistans Shahid Afridis five for 11 against Kenya in the last edition. 

Opting to bat, West Indies were stunned as Chaminda Vaas struck twice early on. The left-arm paceman, who was rested in the previous match against Zimbabwe, dismissed opener Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan for ducks in the first and third overs, respectively. 

The pitch was sluggish, but saying that, it still wasnt a pitch a team such as the West Indies should be out for less than a 100 runs on, Lara said. 

West Indies crashed to the third lowest score of the competition after United States 65 against Australia in 2004 and Bangladeshs 77 against New Zealand in 2002.

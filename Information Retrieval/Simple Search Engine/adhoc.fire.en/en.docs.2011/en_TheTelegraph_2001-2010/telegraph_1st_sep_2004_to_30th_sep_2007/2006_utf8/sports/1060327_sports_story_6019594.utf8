 ODI series a big challenge, says Strauss

 Andrew strauss in New Delhi on Sunday

New Delhi: England would concentrate on playing positive cricket to ensure they carry their winning form into the seven-match one-day series against India, Andrew Strauss said here on Sunday. 

The England opener said although it would be a big challenge to get the better of the hosts, his team was confident that the newcomers would grab the opportunity to excel just as they did in Tests. 

Guys who came in the Test series have done well and now there are some new players in the one-day squad. The one-dayers will provide opportunity to newcomers to stake their claim, he said. 

The ODI series is a big challenge for us. India are a great one-day force but we are looking forward to carry forward the momentum of the Test series, the 28-year-old said in a press conference ahead of the first match here on Tuesday. (PTI)

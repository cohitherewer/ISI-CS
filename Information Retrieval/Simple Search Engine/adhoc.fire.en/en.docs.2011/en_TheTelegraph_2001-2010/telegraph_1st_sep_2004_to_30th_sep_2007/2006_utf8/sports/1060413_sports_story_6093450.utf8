 Omar Henry slams Smith

Durban: Former South African chief selector, Omar Henry on Wednesday slammed captain Graeme Smith, saying he was dictating terms to the cricket board on selection. 

Henry, one of the first black players to represent South Africa, said Smith had his way with the establishment about the composition of the side and other matters related to the team. 

I get the impression that he (Smith) prescribes who must play and what must happen. It just doesnt work this way, Henry said. When I was the convener (of selectors), I just used to say that there are 11 players with whom you (Smith) have to go into a match and lead with the best of your ability. (PTI)

 Ashley Giles still in doubt

London: Ashley Giles participation in Englands tour of India is in increasing doubt because the left-arm spinner is still troubled by a right hip problem despite undergoing surgery. 

Giles, who was hampered by the injury on Englands tour of Pakistan last year, had an operation in December, but returned to visit his medical specialist on Tuesday because of continuing discomfort. 

He hasnt been able to resume bowling but we are awaiting further information from the specialist, a spokesman for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) said on Wednesday. 

It could be some time before we find out the extent of what the specialist has to say. 

England are due to leave for India on February 12.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The SA formula

Johannesburg: South African coach Mickey Arthur has attributed his teams recent resurgence in ODIs to a new strategy they have adopted in both batting and bowling in the middle overs. 

One-day cricket is little stereotyped. Most sides keep sweepers and allow you to hit to them for a single. Batsmen only look to consolidate in middle overs. We are trying to change it, said Arthur. 

We try to look and push our average score, from 260 to 300. And the only way you can do it is through the middle overs. Through the middle, we want to take the sweepers on. 

Arthur cited the example of the Cape Town ODI where South Africans kept coming hard at the Indians despite losing two wickets for nought.

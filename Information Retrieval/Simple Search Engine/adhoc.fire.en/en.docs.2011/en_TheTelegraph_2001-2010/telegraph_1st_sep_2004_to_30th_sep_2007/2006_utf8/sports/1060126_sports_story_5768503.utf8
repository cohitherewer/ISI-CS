 Anand too hot for Van Wely 

 - Indian ace in joint lead 

 Anand defeated Van Wely with black in 42 moves 

Wijk Aan Zee: Viswanathan Anand won an engrossing battle with Loek van Wely of The Netherlands in the ninth round of Corus International Chess meet on Tuesday and stayed in joint lead with world champion Vedelin Topalov. 

On what turned out to be a nightmarish affair for the young gun, Topalov of Bulgaria put it across Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine, the worlds youngest ever Grandmaster, in a fine display of attacking chess stay atop the leaderboard with Anand on 6.5 points (briefly reported in Wednesdays Late City edition). 

Unless either of the top two seeds go haywire from here, it looks like a showdown for the title between Anand and Topalov in the category-19 all-play-all event between 14 players. 

The loss against Topalov put Karjakin on joint fifth spot as the third position is now jointly occupied by Israeli Boris Gelfand and Briton Michael Adams who both came out with fine victories over local challengers Ivan Sokolov and Tailender Etienne Bacrot, respectively. 

While both Gelfand and Adams have 5.5 points each, Karjakin is now on 5 points along with Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine who drew with world junior champion Shakhriyar Mamedyarov of Azerbaijan. 

Anand displayed a deep opening preparation well compiled with good understanding of the endgame to beat Van Wely who played the Sicilian Sveshnikov as black. Interestingly enough, Topalov also played black against Karjakin with the same opening which yielded rich dividends.

 Lara in contention

 Brian Lara 

Port of Spain: Brian Lara, who has twice led the West Indies, could once again be appointed as captain of the embattled Caribbean squad. 

Chairman of selectors Joey Carew said Lara along with six other players ? Dinesh Ramdin, Chris Gayle, Daren Ganga, Sylvester Joseph, Wavell Hinds and Ramnaresh Sarwan ? was being considered for the post. 

These six players had attended a leadership seminar organised by West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) in January this year. 

The captain will come from those six that went to the seminar and Brian [Lara] is also being considered for the position, Carew said. 

The new skipper would be known within three days, Carew was quoted as saying in a local daily on Friday. 

Shivnarine Chanderpauls resignation as skipper this week has forced WICB to consider their seventh captaincy change for the Test team in the past nine years. 

West Indies are set to take on Zimbabwe in a one-day series from April 29 followed by a one-day and a Test series against India starting on May 18. Carew said the debate over the right man for the job would rage on no matter who is eventually named to the post. 

You hardly ever find anybody with the same choice, so we have to be careful with what we do. The public might not agree, but you have to do what you feel is the right answer for the benefit of West Indies cricket. 

Besides the selectors, the cricket committee with Clive Lloyd as chairman, will also give its input before the recommendation is passed on to WICB for final ratification.

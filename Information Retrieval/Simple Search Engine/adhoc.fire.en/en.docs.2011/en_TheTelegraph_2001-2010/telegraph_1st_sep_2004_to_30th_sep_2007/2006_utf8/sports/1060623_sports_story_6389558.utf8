 Pele support for Ronaldo

 - He just needs a little bit of luck, says legend 

 Ronaldo 

Berlin: Football legend Pele has backed countrymate Ronaldo to break the record for all-time top goalscorer in the World Cup, but says he would need a little bit of luck to overtake Gerd Mullers feat. 

Ronaldo has been a trifle off-colour in the tournament, prompting critics to raise questions about his form and fitness, but Pele does not doubt the genius of the footballer. 

Theres no doubt that he is a player with real goalscoring ability, and he is capable of beating the record. But to score, you need ability and also a little bit of luck, he said. 

If you want a good example, look at Fred against Australia. He came on, got one touch of the ball, and scored. So maybe Ronaldo needs some luck as well, he said on the tournaments official website. 

On Brazils show so far and its prospects in the current edition, he said the performance of the Selcao had left their fans frustrated but they were capable of raising their game. 

Brazil have done what we all expected, which was to win matches and get through without too many problems. They have done that much, but a lot of people were expecting them to put on a show. That hasnt happened, and the fans are a little frustrated, Pele said. 

But the important thing was to qualify easily, and now things will start to assume more importance for Brazil. 

Many people have called on (coach Carlos Alberto) Parreira to tinker with the team, but I think that the only changes he needs to make are tactical, or maybe to do with the players fitness. If he is happy with the team because they have won, then I dont think he should change anything. 

Pele said the World Cup had seen a better start this time than the 2002 edition with excellent average number of goals per game. And though referees have come in for criticism from quite a few coaches and players, he had some words of praise for them. 

The discipline and the consistency of the referees has been very good and they are clamping down on foul play. Of course, they will always make some mistakes, but discipline in the matches has been perfect, Pele added. 

Pele said Argentina have played really well, but the team that has impressed him most is Ivory Coast. 

While he felt Germanys Miroslav Klose has a very good chance of ending up as top scorer, he also had high praise for Kloses teammate Philipp Lahm. 

However, for the newly-introduced best young player award, Pele backed Argentinas Lionel Messi. 

Pele added: Englands coach could well give (Theo) Walcott a chance. 

Asked if he would be upset if Walcott scores to break his record of being the youngest-ever goalscorer in the World Cup, Pele said, I wouldnt be upset as long as Brazil end up as world champions. (Pti)

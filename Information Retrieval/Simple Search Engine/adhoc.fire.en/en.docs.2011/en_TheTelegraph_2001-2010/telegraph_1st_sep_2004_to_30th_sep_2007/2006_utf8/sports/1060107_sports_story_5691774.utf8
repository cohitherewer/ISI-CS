The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rajasthan players allowed to participate

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Rajasthan players Akshat Agarwal and Prayank Sadayet were finally allowed to play on Friday in the ongoing U-13 National Boys and Girls Chess Championship being held at Howrah. 

That Akshat and Prayank were not allowed to participate by the AICF, despite the fact that they were accepted as donor entries, was reported in Fridays edition. 

Once the AICF relented, the West Bengal Chess Association (WBCA) officials decided to include the two players from the third round. 

The city based joint secretary of AICF Udayan Kanti Ghosh told The Telegraph: We felt bad for the players as it is against the tradition of Bengal to refuse anyone. 

So we asked them to approach the selection committee of Rajasthan to grant them the necessary permission. By the time we received the clearance matches had already started. So we paired the players together from the third round. Had the organisers had a change of heart earlier it would have given the players a level playing field.

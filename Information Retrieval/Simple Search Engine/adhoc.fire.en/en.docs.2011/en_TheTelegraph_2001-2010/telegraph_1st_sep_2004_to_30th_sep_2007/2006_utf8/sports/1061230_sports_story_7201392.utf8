 Buchanan slams Pietersen

 - By no means is he a team player 

 Kevin Pietersen 

Sydney: Australia coach John Buchanan has launched a stinging attack on Englands Kevin Pietersen, claiming the South African-born batsman is not a team player. 

Pietersen has been Englands most consistent batsman during the disastrous Ashes defence but has been called aloof and criticised for exposing tailenders to the strike at the end of innings. 

He certainly talks about himself as a team player I dont personally see any evidence of that, Buchanan told a news conference on Friday. 

The Australian coach said he noticed Pietersen always fielded in the outfield away from his teammates and that he was one of five players who did not attend the squads Christmas Day lunch. 

It surprises me that he always seems to be distanced from the rest of the group. I wonder whether the criticism of him is because hes different from the group. 

Difference is important in a team dynamic, we have some different players in our team, but its how the difference is managed. 

Buchanan also took aim at England captain Andrew Flintoff, saying he had not imposed himself on the series in the same manner as Australian skipper Ricky Ponting. 

Thats important when you set yourself up to be the leader, the go-to man, when anything is required with good decisions, a good innings, a good spell, whatever. You need to deliver, Buchanan said. 

You see that from Ricky Ponting, generally hell lead from the front and hell lead by example. 

One of the missions of the five-match Test series was to re-establish a gap between us and what is supposedly the second-best team in the world, he said. 

Meanwhile, England coach Duncan Fletcher has dismissed claims his team gave up during their humiliating loss to Australia in the fourth Test. 

Several former England captains, including Mike Gatting, Nasser Hussain and Ian Botham, have launched a scathing attack on Fletchers team after they were thrashed by an innings and 99 runs inside three days. 

You go into the change room and see how despondent they were, he told a news conference in Melbourne on Friday.

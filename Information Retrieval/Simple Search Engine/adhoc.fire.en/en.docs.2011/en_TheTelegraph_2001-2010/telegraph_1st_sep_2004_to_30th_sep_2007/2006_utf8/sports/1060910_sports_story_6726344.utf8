 Paes-Damm battles into title-round

New York: Leander Paes and Martin Damm survived some nerve-jangling moments to register a thrilling 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (9-7), 7-5 victory against fourth seeds Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett and reach their second Grand Slam final of the season at the US Open (as reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

The sixth-seeded Indo-Czech pair had only 116 points to their credit, compared to 122 by their Aussie-Zimbabwe rivals, but won the crucial points to come through the two-hour and 40-minute match under lights at the Flushing Meadows on Friday. 

Although Paes and Damm had lesser number of winning points, they converted two of the five breakpoints that came their way while Hanley and Ullyett could convert only one of the five they had. 

That there were 16 unforced errors by Paes and Damm and 18 by Hanley and Ullyett, besides seven doubles faults by each of them, pointed to the immense pressure on the players. 

Paes and Damm had reached the final at the Australian Open, besides advancing to the semi-final at the Wimbledon this year. The Indian ace has three doubles triumphs at Grand Slams to his credit while his partner is yet to win a major title. 

They now face Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Belarussian Max Mirnyi in the final. 

Bjorkman and Mirnyi defeated the unseeded duo of Ashley Fisher of Australia and Tripp Phillips of the US 6-1, 6-4 in the other semi-final. 

 In boys doubles, Indias 

 Rupesh Roy and Venezuelan Roberto Maytin challenge came 

 to an end when they went down 7-6 (8-6), 4-6, 6-7 (5-7) 

 to Jarmere Jenkins and Austin Krajicek of the US in the 

 quarter finals.

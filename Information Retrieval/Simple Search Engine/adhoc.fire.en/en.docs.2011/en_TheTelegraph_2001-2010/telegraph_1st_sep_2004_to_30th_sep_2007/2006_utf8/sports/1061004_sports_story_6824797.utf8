 Muralidharan keen to set record straight in India

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY

 - I have proved that I can strike on any track, says Lankan 

 Muttiah Muralidharan

New Delhi: Sri Lankas record-breaking spinner Muttiah Muralidharan has taken the blame on himself for his teams poor showing in India last year and is keen to set the record straight during the Champions Trophy. 

I dont think I did well last time. Everybody talks about the teams failure, but whenever I take wickets the team wins. And I didnt take many wickets last time, Muralidharan said. 

Sri Lanka were thrashed 1-6 in the one-day series and lost the three-Test series 0-2 during their visit to India last year. 

It was their first full-fledged tour across the Palk Strait in eight years and Muralidharan returned with six wickets in the five ODIs he played and with 16 wickets in three Tests but a high average of 31.00. 

People say conditions are same but I think only the weather is the same. The pitches are different. Indian tracks are more helpful to batting than bowling, he said. 

If the past records are anything to go by, the wickets in Jaipur and Ahmedabad promise a lot of runs. 

The Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai, which last hosted a ODI in 1995, too, should be batsman-friendly. 

I have proved over the years that I can take wickets on any track. Any type of wicket is OK for me, I am prepared to do well, he said. 

Sri Lanka have to play a qualifying round against the West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe to advance to the championship proper. They are to play their first match against Bangladesh in Mohali on Saturday. 

Meanwhile, Sri Lankas batsman-cum-wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara says he may not be a treat to watch when compared to the other swashbuckling batsmen in the world. 

I play a different brand of cricket. I am not very aggressive. I play a more boring kind of cricket. So one-day cricket is a challenge, the Sri Lankan vice-captain said. 

Former skipper Maravan Atapattu was also glad to be finally pain free after returning to the side following back surgery. I havent played much cricket for the last eight months, the 35-year-old said. It has been gym, hospital and rehab for me. It is time to get on the field again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Same India XI likely in Karachi 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Multan: The one-day series may have been won, but there is going to be no let-up in Team Indias efforts. Not willing to rest upon the 3-1 advantage gained in the series, they will be looking forward to extending the margin in Karachi on Sunday. 

Unless theres a rethink ? after having a look at the wicket on Saturday ? it is likely that Rahul Dravid amp; Co. will go into the final game with the same team that won here. 

The only change that is being thought about in certain quarters is to have Ramesh Powar as super sub in place of Zaheer Khan. The off-spinner may be given a chance, ahead of the England series at home, to test his capabilities. 

The Indian squad arrived in Karachi on Friday under tight security. The players were taken straight to the team hotel. Later, they attended the dinner at the Sindh governors pavilion along with the home team, which had arrived here late on Thursday. 

After Multan, Umar Gul is likely to miss the final ODI as well because of injury.

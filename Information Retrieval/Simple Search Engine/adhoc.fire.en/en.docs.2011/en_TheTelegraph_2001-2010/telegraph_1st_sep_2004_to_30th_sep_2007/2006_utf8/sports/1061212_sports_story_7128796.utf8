 Weve ourselves to blame: Tirkey

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dilip Tirkey 

Doha: Indian hockey captain Dilip Tirkey on Monday hinted that the inability of the strikers to avail opportunities in front of the rival goalmouth was one of the reasons for Indias early exit from the Asian Games. 

Reluctant to talk after national coach Vasudevan Baskaran has put a blanket ban on players from talking to the media, the Indian defender said the entire team was shocked by the outcome in the tournament. 

What saddens me most is that we couldnt make the final and lost out on the automatic Olympic berth. But, then, weve ourselves to blame for the disaster, said Tirkey. 

Stressing on the fact that the relations between the players and the coach was still extremely cordial, Tirkey said: We should have scored both against China and Korea. In international matches, you dont get to create too many chances. But one should convert the few chances that come. We failed to do that. 

Tirkey said he was not considering quitting the game at the international level. It has not crossed my mind so far. I am willing to play more, he said. 

Tirkey also felt that the decision of the coach not to allow the players to talk on the team performance outside the team meetings was right. The coach has taken the right decision, Tirkey said. 

This is the time when talking outside the team meetings might create further confusion. 

The captain ducked when asked whether it was right on the part of the coach to drop some of the senior members. This is not the time to discuss such issues. I will not be within my rights if I talk on such things at the moment, he said.

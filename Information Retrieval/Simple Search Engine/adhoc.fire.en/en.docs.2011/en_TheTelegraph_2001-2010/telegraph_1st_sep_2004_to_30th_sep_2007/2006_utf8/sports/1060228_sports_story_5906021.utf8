 Ponting doubtful

Durban: Injured Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who opted out of the first one-day International against South Africa, may also miss the second match of the series at Cape Town on Friday due to a stomach ailment. 

Stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist said on Monday that Ponting was expected to be out of action for at least one week. 

Australians lost the rain-affected match on Sunday to go 0-1 behind in the five-match series. 

Hard-hitting allrounder Andrew Symonds also missed Sundays match because of injury. (PTI)

 Lara threatens to quit captaincy

 - I was never given the team I wanted... 

Kingston: West Indies cricket seems headed for a fresh crisis with captain Brian Lara threatening to quit captaincy if the same set of selectors was retained following the 0-1 series defeat to India. 

After the 49-run loss to India at Sabina Park, Lara launched a scathing attack against the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) and said he would revisit his decision to stay as captain if no changes were made to the selection panel. 

I feel let down. There is a meeting coming up in a couple of weeks. Depending on the selectors, I would definitely revisit my decision to captain the team, Lara said. 

Laras diatribe was targeted at the selectors and the pitches provided for the series. I found out that I was a selector from May 28, only a day before the final Test (on June 29th). I had seven batsmen for the first couple of matches, I played six, and yet was given eight for the last two Tests. I dont know how you work that one out. That was a problem in itself. 

Its unfortunate that only now I know I have been a selector since the series started. In St Lucia, I said on hindsight a spinner should have played. Yet, two days later, Dave Mohammed was dropped from the squad of 14. 

Lara said the selectors never gave him the team he wanted. Whats more, he was never consulted on selection matters. I have made a couple of calls but I am totally blank on certain situations. Its painful what has gone on for the last couple of months. Not just the Test matches but the one-day games as well. 

Really and truly, I have the welfare of West Indies cricket at heart. But it is a situation where my reputation as a captain is being dragged around. We have lost the series to the Indians in 35 years. But the fact is I was never given the team I wanted, he carried on. 

Lara then turned his attention to the pitch. 

It wasnt worthy of such an important Test. It reminds me of listening to West Indies 20 years ago, where we used to destroy Australia but when we go to Sydney we lose. 

It seems this one was prepared for the Indians. It wasnt the pitch both the team wanted. 

The Caribbean captain said the toss played a vital part. From Day I, I knew it was difficult to win if you lose the toss. It was going to be very difficult for the team batting last. You look at Dravid, he batted for so many hours and then he got an unplayable ball. 

These conditions favoured the opposition. You look at that track where a spinner takes five wickets on the second morning, turning the ball square. Ganga played a ball pitched two feet outside the off-stump and falling lbw. (PTI)

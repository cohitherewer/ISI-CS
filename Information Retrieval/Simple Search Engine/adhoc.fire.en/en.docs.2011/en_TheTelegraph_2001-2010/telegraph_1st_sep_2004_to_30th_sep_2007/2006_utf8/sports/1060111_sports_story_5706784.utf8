 Badrinaths 113 puts Tamil Nadu in command

Chennai: Tamil Nadu skipper S. Badrinath cracked an unbeaten 113 and put on 193 runs for the unfinished third wicket with Hemang Badani (91 ..) as they guided their team to 261 for two against Delhi in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match here on Tuesday. 

The hosts, electing to bat, did not have a good not start as opener Vidyuth Sivaramakrishnan was caught at mid-off by Mithun Minhas off right-arm medium pacer Kuldip Rawat for just six in the fourth over. 

 In another match, attempting to seal a semi-final berth in the Elite Group A of their Ranji Trophy match, Karanataka were pushed on the back foot after being all out for a paltry 163 on Day I against Gujarat at the Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera on Tuesday. 

 Put into bat on a wicket having a bit of grass, Gujarat justified their decision to field as their pacers made early inroads into Karnatakas top order. 

When the days play ended due to bad light, Gujarat were six without losing a wicket in four overs. Nilesh Modi was unbeaten on four, while Aakash Christian was the other not out batsman on one. 

Earlier, play was delayed by about three hours because of damp wicket. The wicket was allowed to dry before the play finally began after lunch at 12:40 hours. 

In Mumbai, Maharashtra struck early blows and threatened to come back into the match after former champions Mumbai had worked their way to an advantageous position on the opening day in their concluding Elite Division Group A tie at the Wankhede Stadium . 

At close, Mumbai were 20 for two in their first innings, after bowling out Maharashtra for a paltry 213 in their first innings.

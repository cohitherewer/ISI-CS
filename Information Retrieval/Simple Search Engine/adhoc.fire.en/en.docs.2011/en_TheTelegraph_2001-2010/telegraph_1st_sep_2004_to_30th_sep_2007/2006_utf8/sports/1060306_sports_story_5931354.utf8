 Shiv ends joint 7th

 Indonesian Open

 Jakarta: Englands 

 Simon Dyson held on for a two-stroke victory at the Indonesia 

 Open on Sunday, a final-round 67 giving him a comfortable 

 win with a 20-under 268 total at the co-sanctioned European 

 and Asian Tour event.

 Australias Andrew Buckle 

 finished alone in second place on 18-under-par at the Emeralda 

 Golf Club with Thailands Thongchai Jaidee and Taiwans 

 Wang Ter-chang a further four shots back in a tie for third 

 place.

 A pair of Australians, Matthew 

 Millar and Scott Strange, shared fifth place on 13-under-par

 Indias Shiv Kapur finished 

 joint seventh with final round one-under 71 for an aggregate 

 277. With him was Irelands David Higgins. 

 Calcuttas Rahil Gangjee 

 carded a one-over 73 to finish in joint 19th place with 

 a 280 aggregate. 

 Also tied 19th was defending champion 

 and 2005 Asian Tour Order of Merit winner Thaworn Wiratchant 

 of Thailand, who closed with a two-under-par 70 to finish 

 on 280. 

 Jeev Milkha Singh brought in his 

 best round of the tournament ? a five-under 67 ? to end 

 up joint 40th with an overall score of 283. This was his 

 only sub-70 score in four rounds, the others being 72, 71 

 and 73.

 Jyoti Randhawa had a one-over 

 73 to finish tied 61st with an aggregate of 287.

 Dysons first European Tour 

 victory was his fourth overall, after three on the Asian 

 Tour, and despite a belated comeback attempt by Buckle on 

 the closing holes, the 28-year-olds three birdie, 

 one eagle round was enough to hold on for victory and a 

 $94,000 cheque.

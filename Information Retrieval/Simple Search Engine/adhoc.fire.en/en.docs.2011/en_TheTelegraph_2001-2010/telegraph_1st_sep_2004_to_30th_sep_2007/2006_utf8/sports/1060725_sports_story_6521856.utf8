 Pollock set to join squad

Colombo: Injury-hit South Africa were on Monday boosted by the news that allrounder Shaun Pollock will arrive in Sri Lanka later this week following the birth of his second child. Pollocks wife Trish gave birth to the couples second daughter Georgia in Durban on Friday, team spokesman Gordon Templeton said. 

Pollock will reach here on Thursday, the day the first of the two Tests start at the SSC, added Templeton. 

Pollock, however, will have enough time to acclimatise to the hot and humid weather in the Sri Lankan capital before he takes the field in the second Test at the Sara Stadium from August 4. 

The tourists, led by their first non-white captain Ashwell Prince, need Pollocks experience to tackle the formidable hosts in the absence of regular captain Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis. (PTI)

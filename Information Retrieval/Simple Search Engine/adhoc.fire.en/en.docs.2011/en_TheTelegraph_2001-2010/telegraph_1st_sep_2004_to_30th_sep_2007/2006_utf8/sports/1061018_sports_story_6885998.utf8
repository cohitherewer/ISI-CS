 Maharashtra, Kerala draw

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Gurgaon: Kerala and Maharashtra played out a well contested 1-1 draw in a Group B quarter-final league match of the Santosh Trophy at the Devi Lal Sports Complex here on Tuesday. 

The draw left the group at an interesting stage as all teams barring Karnataka have a chance to make the last four stages. While Kerala and Maharashtra have four points, Tamil Nadu are very much in contention after their 2-0 victory over Karnataka in the days first outing. 

Kerala had a large number of vocal fans in the stands but it was Maharashtra, who struck first in the eighth minute when Kasif Jamal made most of a free kick. Kerala came back to equalise though Abdul Naushad, who capitalised on Asif Saheer pass. 

In the days first match, Tamil Nadu kept alive their hopes with a 2-0 win over Karnataka. After a barren first half, Tamil Nadu came alive with a goal in the 68th minute by Satish Kumar. Three minutes later substitute Jotin Singh struck a fine goal when he received a Kulothungan pass on the top of the box to beat goalkeeper Gumpe Rime. 

A minute later, Karnataka had a good chance to pull one back after Tamil Nadu defender Mohan Raj handled the ball inside the box. The resultant penalty kick, however was wasted by M Satish Kumar.

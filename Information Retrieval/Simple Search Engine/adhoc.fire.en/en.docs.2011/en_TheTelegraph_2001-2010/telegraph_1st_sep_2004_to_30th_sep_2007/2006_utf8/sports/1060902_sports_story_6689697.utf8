 10-wicket match haul for Jhulan

 Jhulan Goswami 

 London: Jhulan Goswami 

 completed a 10-wicket haul to put the Indian eves on course 

 for a series-clinching victory in the second and final Test 

 against England at Taunton on Friday.

 Jhulan claimed five wickets for 

 45, to add to her figures of five for 33 in the first innings, 

 and helped dismiss the hosts for 305 in their second innings 

 on the fourth and final day.

 Chasing a target of 98 to win 

 the series, India were stuttering after a solid start of 

 73 for four.

 Sulakshana Naik (21) and Karuna 

 Jain (34) helped the visitors to overcome an early hiccup 

 when Rumeli Dhar fell for four and quickly chipped away 

 at the target. But three wickets in the space of 19 runs 

 put the brakes on the Indian scoring.

 Earlier, resuming at 205 for two, 

 England lost their last eight wickets for the addition of 

 just 83 runs.

 England started the final day 

 with hopes that overnight players skipper Charlotte Edwards 

 and Caroline Atkins would take them to safety.

 Coming together with the team 

 precariously placed at 34 for two, following on after conceding 

 a 208-run lead, Charlotte and Caroline added 178 runs for 

 the third wicket before the former fell to Jhulan.

 The dismissal of Charlotte, who 

 had completed her third Test century, started a procession 

 of wickets.

 Caroline fell soon afterwards 

 and there was not much resistance from the hosts thereafter.

 STATISTICAL 

 HIGHLIGHTS 

 The Indian womens Test victory by five wickets 

 in Taunton against England on Friday was only their third 

 win in 34 matches since their debut Test 30 years ago, 

 in October 1976.

 Indias first win came in Patna in November 1976, 

 when they beat the West Indies by five wickets. The second 

 came in Paarl in March 2002 against South Africa. India 

 won by 10 wickets.

 Bengal quick Jhulan Goswami became the first Indian 

 woman cricketer to capture 10 wickets in a Test match. 

 She claimed 10 for 78 (5/33 and 5/45) against England 

 in Taunton in the second Test. She thus bettered the previous 

 best match haul by an Indian woman 9/90 by Neetu 

 David also against England in Jamshedpur during 

 1995-96.

 Jhulan, incidentally, became only the 10th bowler in 

 womens Test history to achieve this feat. The list 

 includes four bowlers from Australia, three from England 

 and one each from New Zealand, Pakistan and India.

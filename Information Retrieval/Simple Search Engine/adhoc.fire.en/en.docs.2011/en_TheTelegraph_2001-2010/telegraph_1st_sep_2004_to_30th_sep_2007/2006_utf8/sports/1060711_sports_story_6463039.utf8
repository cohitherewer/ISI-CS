 McGrath comeback issue

Melbourne: Australian selectors will meet soon to discuss whether sending Glenn McGrath to the Champions Trophy in India in October would be the best preparation for the teams vital Ashes series. 

McGrath, 36, skipped the tours of South Africa and Bangladesh earlier this year because of wife Janes illness. She is suffering from cancer. 

But with Janes health improving, the veteran of 119 Tests is now working his way back to match fitness ahead of the first Ashes Test on November 23 in Brisbane. 

Were going to sit down with the coaching staff and map out Glenns fitness and how he needs to get back into playing cricket again, chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said. 

That (the tournament in India) will be something well talk through with Glenn and the Australian coaches and make sure Glenns programme is exactly as he wants it and we need it to be so hes ready to play in the Ashes. 

We havent really started that process yet. We will do that probably in the near future, he was quoted as saying in media reports on Monday.

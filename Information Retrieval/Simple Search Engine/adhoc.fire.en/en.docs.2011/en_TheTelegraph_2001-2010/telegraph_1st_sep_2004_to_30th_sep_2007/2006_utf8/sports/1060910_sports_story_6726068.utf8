 TV umpire turns down Inzy appeal

 - Fourth ODI Pakistan captain called a cheat by irate England 

 fans 

Nottingham: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who already faces disciplinary charges resulting from a ball-tampering ruling, was at the centre of another controversy when he claimed a catch that wasnt (as was reported in Saturdays Late City edition). 

Fielding at first slip, Inzamam was convinced he took a low catch off England captain Andrew Strauss during Saturdays fourth ODI at Trent Bridge. As Inzamams teammates ran to congratulate him, Strauss refused to leave the crease, equally convinced that the ball had not carried to the Pakistan skipper. 

The case was referred to TV umpire Ian Gould who ruled the batsman was not out. When the verdict came up on the video screen, England fans began chanting cheat, cheat, at Inzamam, who is due to appear before an ICC disciplinary hearing on September 27-28 arising out of a ball-tampering ruling at the end of the fourth Test at The Oval. 

We thought the ball landed in my fingers but its difficult for the umpires to see, Inzamam said. Thats why it was referred to the TV umpire. 

Strauss, on five at the time, went on to score 78 and help England win by eight wickets. 

 I turned round and saw it, and it looked quite clearly the ball it had bounced before Inzy, Strauss said. But sometimes at slip youre not sure. 

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer said all replays should be shown to the crowd on the big screen rather than just the one suggesting Strauss was not out which led some spectators to booing Inzamam. 

When they showed the replays, there were two views of it. One looked not out, the other looked out. If they are going to show one view, they should so the other on the screen or not show anything at all, Woolmer remarked after Fridays match. 

I think it was one of those catches where you think youve caught it. Because its so close to the ground, you cant make a rational judgment. 

However, Woolmer said he had no problems with Strauss decision to stay put. I think Strauss, if he thought it hit the ground, had every right to stay there. One-day cricket can be a lottery, but England were better than us.

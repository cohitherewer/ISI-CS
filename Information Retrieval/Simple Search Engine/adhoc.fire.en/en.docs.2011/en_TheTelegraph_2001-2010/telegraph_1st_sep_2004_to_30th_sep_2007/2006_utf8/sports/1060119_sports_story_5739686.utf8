 Diwakar stuns Kazakh GM

 - Saptarshi joint 2nd after win 

 Surya Sekhar signed peace with Himanshu 

New Delhi: Jharkhands Diwakar Prasad Singh stole the limelight by registering the first victory of his career against a Grandmaster in the sixth round of the Parsvanath International Open here on Wednesday. 

Diwakar, winner of two open events at Sangli recently and National B runner-up, outplayed Nurlan Ibraev of Kazakhstan while playing the Slav Defence with black pieces. 

Top seed GM Alexei Federov of Belarus lived up to his billing by outwitting Uzbekistan GM Marat Dzhumaev to maintain his cent per cent record. He leapt to sole lead, ahead of 15 players, with a full point margin in the Rs 7.5 lakh tournament. 

On a day when draw was the pattern on top boards, second seed Surya Shekhar Ganguly was held by Delhis Himanshu Sharma, while GM R.B. Ramesh drew with B.S. Sivanandan. 

IM S Satyapragyan signed peace with GM Dibyendu Barua and GM Abhijit Kunte settled for his third draw in the event with Parimarjan Negi. 

Saptarshi Roy upset IM Sundararajan Kidambi, while Woman Grandmaster Tania Sachdev maintained her unbeaten record by holding IM S Vijayalakshmi. 

Saptarshi, playing white, employed the Caro-Kann opening and played a good novelty with bishop in the 10th move. He then sacrificed a knight and a bishop to force a mating position leaving his opponent helpless. The Calcutta player has now jumped into joint second spot. 

Negi once again showed his extraordinary calibre as he prevented GM Kunte to capitalise on the slight edge he had with white in the Queens Gambit game. 

Negi, who is hunting for his second GM norm here, was never in a strong position but did not give up the hope while playing against third GM opponent on the trot here. 

He fought with two rooks and a pawn against his rook-bishop and a pawn in the endgame, which eventually ended in a draw. (PTI)

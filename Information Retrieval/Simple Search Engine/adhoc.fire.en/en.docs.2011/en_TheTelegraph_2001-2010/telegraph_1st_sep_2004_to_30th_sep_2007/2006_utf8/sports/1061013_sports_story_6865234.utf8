 PCB to put Inzy under scanner

 Inzamam 

Karachi: The new chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has indicated that the powers enjoyed by cricketers and some officials in the board would be cut down to ensure that there is discipline all around. 

Dr. Nasim Ashraf, a government advisor on human development who took over as PCB chairman last week from Shaharyar Khan, said he would not compromise on discipline. 

I have been appointed to ensure there is discipline and transparency at every level of our cricket set-up and that is my priority, he said. 

He also made it clear that although Inzamam-ul Haq was appointed captain until the end of the year by the previous set-up, his captaincy would be reviewed after the home series against the West Indies. 

After the home series against the West Indies, we will sit down and review things and the person, who has form and fitness, would be named captain for the tour of South Africa and the World Cup, Dr Ashraf said. 

A member of the PCB ad-hoc committee, Ali Reza confirmed that there was a problem of players power in the team. The decision to reappoint Younis Khan as captain for the Champions Trophy was aimed at reducing this power, Reza said. 

There is a feeling in the board after The Oval incident that Inzamam had assumed too much power as captain and that Shaharyar was accepting his every demand. 

The decision by Shaharyar to appoint Inzamams close friend Mushtaq Ahmed as an assistant coach for the Champions Trophy was revoked by the new chairman at his first press briefing in Lahore. 

Inzamam, meanwhile, has urged his teammates to put the sides recent problems behind them at the Champions Trophy. Obviously when you have such things (Oval Test fiasco and Younis dramatic reappointment as captain) happening before a major tournament it does have an impact on the players, Inzamam said on Thursday. 

What we did at The Oval (refusing to play) was a team decision. What Younis did had nothing to do with any other player. So there is no lack of spirit and unity in the side, he added. They will back Younis to the hilt. 

Meanwhile, Inzamam is arriving in India for the Champions Trophy but to play a role off the field. He will closely follow and commentate on the performance of Pakistan and other teams for an Indian television network a day before the main round of Champions Trophy gets underway on Sunday.

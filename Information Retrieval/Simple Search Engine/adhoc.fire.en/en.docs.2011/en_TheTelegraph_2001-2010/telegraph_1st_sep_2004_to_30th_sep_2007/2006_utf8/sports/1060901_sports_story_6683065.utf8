 Real want to swap Ronaldo for Adriano

Madrid: Ronaldo, Julio Baptista and Ivan Helguera will reportedly leave Real Madrid before Thursdays transfer deadline if the club can arrange exchange deals. 

Ronaldo would be swapped for Inter Milan striker Adriano to rejoin the club he played for from 1997-2002. 

Midfielder Baptista would move to Arsenal, with Spain forward Jose Antonio Reyes achieving a long-awaited transfer to the Spanish club, and defender Helguera would join Valencia in return for Argentinas Roberto Ayala. 

The deals would continue Madrids transformation under president Ramon Calderon and coach Fabio Capello, who are seeking to end the clubs major trophy drought. 

Speculation has surrounded Ronaldos future since March when he threatened to quit the club after being regularly jeered by fans. (AP)

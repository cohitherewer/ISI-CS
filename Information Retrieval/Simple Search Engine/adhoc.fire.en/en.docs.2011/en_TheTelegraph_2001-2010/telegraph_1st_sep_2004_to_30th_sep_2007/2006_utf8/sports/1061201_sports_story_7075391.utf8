The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chappells guarded comment

Johannesburg: India coach Greg Chappell kept his feelings close to his chest when the news of Sourav Ganguly making the Test squad was given to him. Good till he plays, were his curt remarks to a television crew member, which was picked by milling scribes around him. 

Chappell and Sourav have had a frosty relationship and the interaction between the two may become a point of focus in the days to come. 

The Test squad was selected in India while Rahul Dravid amp; Co. were in the air, flying from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg. Team India would play a Twenty20 International on Friday. 

The word on Souravs selection reached them as soon as they touched down in Johannesburg, courtesy the sizeable media contingent, which was travelling in the same flight as the players. 

Officially though the players came to know about the changes only after manager Prakash Dixit received the news by way of a message on his mobile from official channels of the Board. (PTI)

 Jeev moves to 5th spot

Sanya: Jeev Milkha Singh shot a six-under 66 to keep in touch with the leaders to end Day III in fifth place. His 66 took him to 18-under 198 in the $1 TCL Classic golf meet at the Yalong Bay Club. He was placed seventh on Saturday. 

Gaurav Gheis seven-under 65 carried him to tied ninth at 15-under in this event co-sanctioned by the Asian and European Tours. Amandeep Johl shot a three-under 69 for an overall 14-under and was in tied 16th place. 

Rahil Gangjee turned in a 69 to be 12-under and in tied 25th, while Shiv Kapur carded a 67 for an overall 10-under and a tied 35th place . 

David Howell came close to a 54-hole European and Asian Tour record as he maintained his red-hot run on Saturday. The Englishman left a birdie putt on the 18th two inches short as he finished the third round on 23-under 193. That equalled the mark set by Ernie Els at the 2003 Johnnie Walker Classic in Perth. 

Howell shot a 66 to stay one stroke ahead of Australian playing partner Andrew Buckle, who carded a 65. (PTI)

Mumbai: Dmitry Tursunov served up quite a treat for the near-capacity audience at the CCI on Saturday evening to zoom into the final of the Kingfisher Airlines Open. The Russian blew hot and cold in the first two sets before blasting Tommy Robredo to pieces in a high-quality two-hour, 10-minute encounter which brought the 3,000-odd gathering to its feet. 

The top-seeded Spaniard, who had levelled scores after surrendering initiative in the opening set, didnt know what awaited him in the third. He left the court shell-shocked after the 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, 1-6 battering, not even caring to acknowledge his still screaming fans. 

Standing between Tursunov and his maiden ATP crown is Tomas Berdych. The third-seeded Czech advanced to is fifth career final with a 7-6 (7-2), 6-2 verdict over Stefan Koubek, the conqueror of Mario Ancic. 

Tursunov, who has shown a suspect concentration level in almost every match, produced the best tennis of the week after taking a toilet break at the end of the second set. For 20 minutes, he used the forehand like an AK-47 to drill bullets into every corner of Robredos court. 

Running round his forehand at will, the world No. 22 his amazing inside-out winners to make a mockery of his top-10 rival. In those 20 minutes of magic, the Russian missed just one shot. 

He just started hitting the ball and they all fell in, said Robredo. It would have been different if I had taken the first set which I was dominating. The Spaniard, who had won two of their three previous meetings, faltered when serving at 5-4 and let Tursunov right back into the match. 

Robredo, though, was happy with the way the week went for him. I was not in the best frame of mind when I came here because the (Spain) captain dropped me for the final match (versus Italy). I had lost on the first day, but wanted to make it up in reverse singles. So I am happy to have made the semis here, Robredo said. 

Berdych had two reasons to celebrate Saturdays win over Koubek it ensured a second title-round appearance this year and more importantly, he wouldnt be meeting Roger Federer in the final. 

The six-foot-five Czech faced Federer on grass in the Halle final, and no prizes for guessing who won. Yeah, Im happy hes not here you have a better chance to win against anyone but Federer, said a relaxed Berdych. 

This was the third seeds fourth straight-set win in as many days. He closed out the 81-minute match in style, but Berdych didnt play a great first set. The serves were a trifle erratic and lacked the usual sting, while his forehand missed the target once too often. For the first time this week, Berdych even reacted to line calls a couple of times. 

Koubek, though, couldnt capitalise on the chances offered to him. 

The blond-haired Koubek, a gritty fighter whose forte is steady baseline slugging, managed to save all five break-points he faced in the first set but couldnt find a way to capture Berdychs serve. He had two chances in the 11th game, but Berdych unfurled a pair of unreturnable serves at crunch time. 

Berdych pulled up his socks in the tie-break, taking it without a problem. The second set was a breeze for him as Koubek was outclassed.

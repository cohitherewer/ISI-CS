 Shikha, Rohan, Prakash lose

Melbourne: Rohan Bopanna lost in the second round of the Australian Open mens singles qualifiers on Friday. He had more winners than opponent Jean Christophe Faurel of France, but his serve let him down as he lost 4-6, 6-1, 3-6 at Melbourne Park. 

Bopanna had 31 winners against Faurels 26.But the big serving Indian also had 43 unforced errors and six double faults to Faurels 26 and two. 

Prakash Amritraj and Shikha Uberoi also bowed out. 

Todd Widom of the US needed little more than an hour to dismantle Amritraj 6-2, 6-1. 

Amritraj imploded in a flurry of unforced errors, 27 for the match. Widom, on the other hand, was sparkling in his game, making only three unforced errors in all and had a 100 per cent breakpoint conversion. 

Shikha started off well but Anastassia Rodionova, ranked 140 on the WTA Tour, pulled away gradually for a 7-5, 6-2 win.

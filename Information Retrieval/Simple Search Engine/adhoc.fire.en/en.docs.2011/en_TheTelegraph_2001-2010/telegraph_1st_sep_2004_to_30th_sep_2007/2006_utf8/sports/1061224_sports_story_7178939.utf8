OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Yuvraj Singh 

Durban: Yuvraj Singhs recovery is on track, which means theres hope that hes going to be fit for the March-April World Cup. 

I cant go into details, but Im in daily contact with him... All I can say is that hes progressing on schedule, Team India physio John Gloster told The Telegraph. 

Yuvraj injured his left knee while playing kho-kho, which was part of a warm-up session on the eve of Team Indias Champions Trophy match against Australia in Mohali. Gloster had then said he would take three months (from October 28) to recover. 

Even if there are no hiccups, the earliest Yuvraj could return to big-time cricket will be during the four-match ODI series versus Sri Lanka, from February 8-17.

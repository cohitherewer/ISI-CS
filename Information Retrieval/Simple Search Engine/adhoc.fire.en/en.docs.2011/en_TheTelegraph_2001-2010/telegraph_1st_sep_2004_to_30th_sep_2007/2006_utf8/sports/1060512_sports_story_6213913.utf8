 Hingis beats Dementieva

Berlin: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis eased past fifth seed Elena Dementieva 6-3, 6-2 on Thursday to reach the quarter finals of the German Open. 

French Open champion and No. 3 seed Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium also progressed on Thursday, thrashing Russian Maria Kirilenko 6-1m 6-0 in under an hour. 

Unseeded Hingis, champion here in 1999, had a surprisingly easy time against the Russian on another day of brilliant sunshine and near-perfect conditions at the Steffi Graf Stadium. 

World No. 8 Dementieva had won the pairs last three matches in straight sets but only one of those was since January, when the 25-year-old Hingis made her return from a three-year retirement. 

I would say this is one of the best matches Ive played since I came back. Beating Dementieva gives me confidence that I can survive against players like her, Hingis said.

 FIA bans Saubers Twin Tower

London: Formula Ones governing body has banned on safety grounds the radical-looking Twin Tower vertical front wings used by BMW Sauber at this months French Grand Prix. 

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) wrote to all 11 teams after the race at Magny-Cours expressing concern that such devices may impair the forward and/or lateral vision of the driver. 

The controversial wings passed pre-race inspections in France, but BMW team boss Mario Theissen accepted on Tuesday that the team would not be allowed to use them at this weekends German GP. 

The vertical wings obviously presented a new aero solution within the rules, he said in a statement. We, however, respect the FIAs decision to ban such elements. 

The knowledge we gained from this will be included in our future development programmes. 

The two vertical white fins on the nose of the BMW car were dubbed the Twin Towers as a nod to the Kuala Lumpur skyscrapers owned by Malaysian oil giant and team sponsor Petronas.

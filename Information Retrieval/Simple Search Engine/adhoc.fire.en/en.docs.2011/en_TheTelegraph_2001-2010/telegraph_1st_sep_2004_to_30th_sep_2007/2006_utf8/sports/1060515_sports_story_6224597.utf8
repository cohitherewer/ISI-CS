The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players asked not to venture out alone

 - Weve got to take precautions: Team India manager 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Irfan Pathan and Mohammed Kaif relax in Kingston 

 Kingston: We arent in Johannesburg or Karachi 

 or Durban, but Team India manager Ranjib Biswal has asked 

 the players to not venture out alone. That has 

 also been conveyed to the wives of captain Rahul Dravid 

 and vice-captain Virender Sehwag. 

 Irrespective of what the 

 locals say, weve got to take precautions. Therefore, 

 Ive asked everybody to not venture out alone, 

 Biswal told The Telegraph on Sunday morning, shortly 

 before the team left for its first practice session of the 

 tour. 

Apparently, gang wars break out pretty frequently here and one of the guests at the team hotel (the rather poorly run Hilton) informed that there was a shootout less than 200 metres away on his last visit to the Jamaican capital. 

Clearly, its better being safe than sorry in territory which otherwise is passionate about soccer, cricket, sprinting, rum and reggae. Not necessarily in that order, though. 

The local administration has, of course, provided a security officer for Team India ? Inspector Robblin Wedderburn, who happily announced hed done the same job on the last tour (2002, when Sourav Ganguly was captain). 

However, the well-built Wedderburn isnt staying at the hotel. I come when any movement is to take place... Ive done this with teams of the other Test-playing nations as well... I quite enjoy looking after the cricketers... 

While Wedderburns presence is comforting, the Indians are baffled as to why the travelling has to be done in two minibuses and not one luxurious bus as is the norm across the world of cricket. 

Ive been informed thats not possible, Biswal said, shrugging shoulders. 

Incidentally, the Indians will be using a chartered aircraft for Tuesdays tour-opener (against the Jamaica Cricket Association XI) in Montego Bay. The flight shouldnt take more than 20 minutes. The Dravids depart on Monday evening and are going to be back right after the match. 

 One understands theres a huge Indian presence 

 in Montego Bay, which is promoted as the do-it-all 

 place. Well... 

 Footnote: The Jamaican 

 dollar is pretty weak (one US, for example, fetches 63) 

 and, so, an average meal for one at Akbar, which serves 

 reasonable Indian khana, costs around $2,000... Whatever 

 the currencys standing, though, nothing comes cheap.

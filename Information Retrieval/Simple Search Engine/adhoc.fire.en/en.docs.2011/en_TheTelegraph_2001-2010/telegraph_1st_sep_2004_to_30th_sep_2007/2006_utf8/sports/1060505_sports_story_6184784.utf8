 Oxygen chamber for Rooney

Manchester: England striker Wayne Rooney will undergo treatment in an oxygen chamber in his bid to recover from a foot injury in time for the World Cup. 

Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson told a news conference on Thursday: He will get that treatment and hopefully that helps. Theres no conclusive evidence that it (the oxygen chamber) does improve injuries, but there is no evidence against it. 

Ferguson struck a cautiously optimistic note when he said: The break he has got in the fourth metatarsal is a small fracture. The one slightly above it is nothing to worry about at all.

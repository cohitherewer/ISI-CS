The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kingsmead assistant curator in demand

 - Navi Mumbai-based Sports Academy sends invitation 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Durban: Kingsmeads auxiliary groundsman (assistant curator, effectively) Evan Lawson Flint has been invited by a Navi Mumbai-located Sports Academy to help lay the wicket there for which soil from Centurion has been imported. 

The Academy has been dealing with people in Centurion, but my name got recommended... They want me over for two months from early January, but Ive got to be back here before the February 7 South Africa versus Pakistan ODI, Flint told The Telegraph. 

The soil, called Bulli, has a high clay content as much as 58 per cent. Its used across South Africa, which explains the bounce seen in these parts. 

Flint, 27, intends organising his visa (for which the Sports Academy has sent a letter to the Indian High Commission) and ticket after the ongoing Test gets over. He has, in the past, played league cricket in England.

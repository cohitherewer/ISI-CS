 Styris saves day for NZ

 - Bradshaw, Smith share six wickets equally for WI 

 Scott Styris after his century on Thursday 

Sydney: Scott Styris smashed an unbeaten century then captured two quick wickets as New Zealand fought back to share the honours with the West Indies on a see-sawing opening day of the first Test in Auckland on Thursday. 

Styris made 103 not out to help New Zealand recover from 69 for four before lunch to finish with a modest but respectable total of 275. 

The allrounder then picked up two wickets in the penultimate over of the day to leave the tourists reeling at 51 for three, still 224 runs behind with seven wickets in hand. 

It was great to get those wickets at the end of the day to even the ledger out a little bit, Styris told New Zealand Press Association. The West Indies had dominated the first day at Eden Park, bowling the home side out in under 70 overs on a temporary drop-in pitch that favoured the bowlers, but their late collapse left the match in the balance. 

Debutant paceman Ian Bradshaw (3/73) demolished the top-order in the morning session before medium-pacer Dwayne Smith (3/71) finished off the tail after Styris and Nathan Astle had staged their comeback. 

The pair added 71 runs for the fifth wicket in less than 18 overs with Astle making 51 off 57 balls, including 10 boundaries. Styris was just as aggressive, smacking 15 fours and two sixes to chalk up his fifth Test ton off 122 deliveries before eventually running out of partners.

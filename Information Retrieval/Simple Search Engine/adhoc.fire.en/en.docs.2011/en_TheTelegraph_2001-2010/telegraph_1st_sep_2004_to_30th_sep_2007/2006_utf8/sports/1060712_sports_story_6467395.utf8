The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cheats outsmarted the referees

 Long Whistle

 Milan Dutta

 Zinedine Zidanes extraordinary 

 ejection in his farewell match and on the stage of footballs 

 greatest show on Sunday night has come to cap a World Cup 

 which had a number of dramatis personae and which had worn 

 the colour of red and yellow in the true sense of the term. 

 This is not for the first time 

 that a player was red-carded in a World Cup final. Pedro 

 Monzon and Gustavo Abel Dezotti of Argentina received similar 

 punishments in Rome in 1990, helping Germany end up 1-0 

 winners. Frances Marcel Desailly was cautioned twice, 

 leading to his red-card during his teams 3-0 win over 

 Brazil in Paris eight years ago. 

 The French captains marching 

 orders in the final was just the culmination of a record 

 streak of 28 red-cards ? a whooping six more than the 1998 

 finals 22. Add to this the fact that the players were 

 cautioned 345 times, and you will get to the bottom of the 

 match officials job: They had to be extra vigilant 

 for any encroachment into the free-flowing nature of the 

 game. 

 If the Argentine referee Horacio 

 Elizondos marching orders for Zidane was an easy decision 

 to make, the former showed courage when he awarded the seventh-minute 

 penalty in Frances favour. Many critics may have pointed 

 out that it was a harsh decision as it appeared that Materazzis 

 act, which prompted Malouda to be grounded inside the area, 

 couldve been ignored. 

 But the referees nowadays tend 

 to see a tackle from three perspectives ? whether it is 

 intentional, reckless and careless. The Italian defenders 

 act falls into the third category and therefore, Elizondo 

 ? inarguably the most courageous referee of the tournament 

 ? was spot-on in his decision. 

 The debate over Zidanes 

 red-card will go on, but it shouldnt conceal the fact 

 that this World Cup was also notorious for cheats. Players 

 have often dived, pretending to be fouled and acting injured 

 to draw cautions for rivals. But the officials couldnt 

 keep up with such cheating, they were outsmarted, outwitted 

 and outfoxed by these actor-players.

 The Spanish referee Luis Cartalejos 

 decision in awarding a penalty against Australia was simply 

 ridiculous. In the Germany-Italy semi-final, Grosso pushed 

 Podolski inside the Italy box, but the Mexican referee Benito 

 placed the ball outside the box. The match was 82-minute 

 old and Germany couldve got their matchwinner, which 

 never came their way. In the other semi-final, Henry outfoxed 

 Uruguayan referee Larrionda Jorge with his dramatic fall, 

 earning the penalty, which Zidane converted to decide the 

 match. 

 To me, Valentin Ivanovs 

 officiating of the Portugal-The Netherlands match was the 

 nastiest of this World Cup. 

 True, the referees have clamped 

 down on time-wasting, elbowing and dangerous tackles to 

 a large extent. But Fifas attempt to eradicate play-acting 

 has been a failure in general. In fact, Fifa and Uefa are 

 planning to call a technical convention very soon in Berlin. 

 Play-acting is a black scar of the game and must come to 

 an end immediately.

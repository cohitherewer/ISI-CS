 Lee ties knot

Sydney: Brett Lee kicked off a fresh innings by tying the knot with girlfriend Liz Kemp here. 

The 29-year-old Australian speedster and Kemp, also 29, were married at the country house of broadcaster Alan Jones at Fitzroy Falls, near Bowral, on Saturday. 

Kemp is a podiatrist by profession. 

The ceremony took place only metres away from Jones personal cricket pitch, which is named in honour of Lee.

 Owen aiming for April comeback

London: Newcastle United and England striker Michael Owen hopes to have recovered from his broken toe in time for the last month of the Premiership season. 

The 26-year-old broke the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot in the 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on new years eve, but has now regained a greater level of mobility after having a protective boot removed. 

My recovery is going well, said Englands leading scorer, having scored 33 goals in 74 internationals. 

I have been on the exercise bike and can walk around in my trainers. Hopefully I will be able to start gently on the treadmill soon, Owen told the official club website. 

The surgeon seems very happy that the pin is still in place and I want to be back for at least a month of the season. 

Climbing up the table is obviously the priority, and the FA Cup still gives us a shot at silverware. 

Owens injury was one of many that left Graeme Souness ? sacked by the club on Thursday ? short of numbers. 

The former Liverpool and Real Madrid frontman has scored seven goals in his 10 Premiership starts for the Magpies to date. (AFP)

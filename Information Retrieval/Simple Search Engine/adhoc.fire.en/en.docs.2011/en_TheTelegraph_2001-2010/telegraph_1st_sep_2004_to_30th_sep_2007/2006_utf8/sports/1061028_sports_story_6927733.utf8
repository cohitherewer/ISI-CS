The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiya unlikely to attend hearing

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Jagmohan Dalmiya 

Chandigarh: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya is unlikely to attend Sundays disciplinary committee hearing here. 

Dalmiya (who got suspended in April) wasnt available for comment, but The Telegraphs sources informed it was highly unlikely that he would respond to the summons. The committee is chaired by president Sharad Pawar. 

While Dalmiya is unlikely to turn up, the man whod challenged him for the Cricket Association of Bengal presidents post, Calcutta police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, is in Chandigarh. 

Mukherjee, who has been given a seat on the BCCIs marketing committee, is a special invitee.

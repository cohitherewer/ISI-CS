 FA to move Fifa over water issue

 Buhlertal: The Football 

 Association (FA) has decided to approach Fifa after it emerged 

 that match officials in Englands Group B opener against 

 Paraguay prevented players getting all the water they needed 

 during the match. Despite sweltering temperatures of up 

 to 29 degrees Celsius on Saturday, England players were 

 at times denied access to water by officials at the Waldstadion 

 in Frankfurt.

 Were certainly going 

 to make some kind of communication with Fifa ? not any kind 

 of complaint ? but I know the medical staff were concerned, 

 FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said on Sunday. I think 

 we went through 70 litres of water during the course of 

 the game on Saturday. We normally go through somewhere in 

 the region of 20, he said.

 20 England fans arrested

 Frankfurt: Twenty England 

 fans were arrested in Germany on Saturday, a British police 

 spokeswoman said on Sunday. About 70,000 England fans were 

 thought to have been in Frankfurt for the match, she said. 

 We understand there were 70,000 English people in 

 Frankfurt on Saturday so we see a figure of 12 arrests as 

 quite positive, the spokeswoman said. Twelve of the 

 arrests were made in Frankfurt and eight in Cologne. Two 

 were for alleged assault and criminal damage outside the 

 ground and the pair will appear in court in Frankfurt later 

 on Sunday, she said.

 No dope cases so far: Fifa 

 doctor

 Berlin: Fifas chief 

 medical official is not expecting any doping cases at the 

 World Cup. Soccers governing body conducted more than 

 125 tests in 24 international friendlies and all 32 training 

 camps before the tournament started, and tested two players 

 from each team in the opening matches. So far there were 

 no positives, Dr Jiri Dvorak said Sunday, confirming that 

 some of the sports biggest stars had been tested. 

 Dvorak demonstrated Fifas doping test procedures in 

 detail, saying he wanted to show the system was thorough..

 Raul misses training

 Kamen: Spain striker Raul 

 dropped out of training on Sunday after picking up two knocks 

 from heavy challenges during a practice match.

 Team doctor Genaro Borras said 

 that the knocks were not serious and that Rauls availability 

 for Spains opening Group H match against Ukraine in 

 Leipzig on Wednesday was not in jeopardy.

 $160000 bait for Saudis

 Bad Nauheim: Saudi Arabias 

 players could earn up to 600,000 riyal ($160,000) each if 

 they reach the last 16 of the World Cup, a team spokesman 

 confirmed on Sunday. The players were told of the incentives 

 by the Prince Sultan, head of the Saudi Soccer Federation, 

 at a meeting in the team hotel on Saturday. The players 

 will earn 100,000 riyals for each victory in the group phase, 

 and a 300,000 riyals payment if they get through the group, 

 team media officer Ibrahim Al-Goba said on Sunday.

 outh Korea relays to North

 Seoul: South Korea has 

 begun providing North Korea with television broadcasts of 

 the World Cup soccer finals in Germany. We started 

 relaying World Cup TV broadcasts through satellite, 

 Yang Chang-seok, a South Korea unification ministry spokesman 

 said on Sunday. But I dont think the North started 

 airing them yet.

 The move follows the Norths 

 request that South Korea relay World Cup broadcasts so that 

 its people can watch the global soccer tournament.

 Alexs woe

 Bonn: A World Cup pep-talk 

 given by Japans soccer chief to the Japanese squad 

 was completely lost on the teams Brazilian-born defender 

 Alex. Japan Football Association (JFA) chief Saburo Kawabuchi 

 dropped in on the squad during training on Saturday to rally 

 the troops for Mondays World Cup opener against Australia.

 But it was lost on Alex. I 

 was wondering what he was talking about, smiled the 

 28-year-old, who speaks intermediate Japanese. 

 Streller hurt

 Bad Bertrich: Switzerland 

 striker Marco Streller twisted his knee in practice and 

 was taken to a hospital for a body scan. Team doctor Rudolf 

 Roder called it a moment of horror when Streller 

 hurt his knee, but tests showed no sign of injury. 

 Closed roofs?

 Berlin: World Cup organisers 

 want to play some matches under roofs to reduce the amount 

 of shadow in TV broadcasts, as long as it does not get too 

 steamy for players. If you have watched the matches 

 on Saturday on television, you saw that for the matches 

 in the afternoon ? when the sun is shining ? its not 

 the best TV picture, Fifa spokesman Markus Siegler 

 said on Sunday.

 Were currently assessing 

 the situation, he said. We must understand, 

 millions and millions of people are watching the match and 

 theres not a nice picture with all those shadows.

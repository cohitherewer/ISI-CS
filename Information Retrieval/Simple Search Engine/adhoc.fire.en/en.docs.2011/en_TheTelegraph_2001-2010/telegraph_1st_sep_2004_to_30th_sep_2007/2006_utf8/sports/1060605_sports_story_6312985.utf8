The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 HIGHS amp; LOWS: DAY II

 Sreesanths 29 not out equals his highest Test 

 score. He had made an identical score in his previous 

 Test match against England in Mumbai, which incidentally 

 also remains his highest in first-class cricket. Interestingly, 

 playing in his third Test match, Sreesanth now has a batting 

 average of 59.00, while aggregating 59 runs.

 Playing in his 60th match, Ramnaresh Sarwan (on 50) 

 became the 14th West Indian and the 94th batsman in Test 

 cricket to aggregate 4000 runs. He now has 4008 runs to 

 his credit.

 The six hit by Brian Lara was his 79th in 125 Tests. 

 Only Australian Adam Gilchrist (93 sixes), New Zealander 

 Chris Cairns (87) and fellow West Indian Viv Richards 

 (84) have hit more sixes in Tests.

 Lara (18) once again failed to make a substantial score 

 against India. He now has 809 runs at 36.77 runs per innings, 

 which is by far his worst against any Test playing nation.

 Dwayne Bravos allround performance in the match 

 so far (four for 40 and 68) is the best by any allrounder 

 at this ground. No other allrounder has made a half-century 

 and taken four wickets in an innings in a single Test 

 match at St Johns.

 The catch by Rahul Dravid to dismiss Chris Gayle was 

 the 44th taken by the former off the bowling of Anil Kumble. 

 Only two other fielder-bowler combination have exceeded 

 the Dravid-Kumble effort in Tests ? 54 catches by Sri 

 Lankan Mahela Jayawardene off Muttiah Muralidharan and 

 51 by Australian Mark Taylor off Shane Warne.

 The two wickets by Virender Sehwag (two for 32) was 

 his best bowling performance in Tests. His previous best 

 was one for 17 against New Zealand in Ahmedabad, 2003-04.

 Didar hattrick in Sultans win

 - PREMIER HOCKEY LEAGUE 

Chandigarh: Didar Singh scored a hattrick as Hyderabad Sultans came back from a two goal deficit to beat Bangalore Lions 3-2 in the Tier I match of the Premier Hockey League at the sector 42 stadium here on Friday. 

The Lions were sitting pretty but Didars entry in the last quarter changed the complexion of the game. 

Lions took early control as a perfect set-piece drill in the 12th minute saw Jordz Quintana put them ahead. Then skipper Arjun Halappa and Rehan Butt combined well to repeatedly raid the Sultans defence. 

Five minutes before half-time, Butt scored with a stinging shot after he received a defence-splitting pass from Tushar Khandekar on the left flank. 

The Sultans tried to get back into the match in the third quarter but the Lions defence, led by Len Aiyappa, managed to hold firm despite conceding several penalty corners. 

Sultans substituted Jorge Lombi with Didar Singh towards the end and the decision proved to be a masterstroke. 

He turned the match upside down with his drag flicks scoring twice in the fourth quarter to push the match into the extra-time silver goal period. 

The comeback started in the 54th minute when Didar was on target converting a penalty corner. Nine minutes later, he equalised with a low flick, which kissed the gloves of Lions custodian Bharat Chetri before landing in the net. 

The match was thus pushed into extra-time. 

Didars drag flick in the 75th minute hit Quintanas head on the goalline before going out and umpire Bhupinder awarded a penalty stroke, which Didar converted to give the Sultans a cherishing victory. 

Earlier in the day, Young dragf-licker Raghunath played a stellar role converting three penalty corners to fashion Chennai Veerans 5-1 victory over Lucknow Nawabs in a tier II match. 

Chennai Veerans, who were relegated to tier II after the first edition, played with vengeance and began their campaign with a bang pumping five goals past a hapless Nawabs to score full three poi-nts from their opening match.

 Amla now in coolie row

 Durban: South Africas Test batsman of 

 Indian origin, Hashim Amla, has become the butt of yet another 

 racist attack after the recent Dean Jones controversy.

 An electronic goods manufacturing company in Johannesburg 

 has raised the ire of South Africans of Indian origin and 

 Cricket South Africa (CSA), after it displayed a seemingly 

 derogatory advertisement. 

The company, Copy Type Electronics, displayed a racist advertisement on a huge board on the N1 highway in Johannesburg. 

The words read: Thank goodness Amla didnt face a coolie kreeper. The word coolie, previously used to describe the Indian community, has now been banned along with other racist terms. 

 Following complaints, the company apologised to Amla 

 and the general public.

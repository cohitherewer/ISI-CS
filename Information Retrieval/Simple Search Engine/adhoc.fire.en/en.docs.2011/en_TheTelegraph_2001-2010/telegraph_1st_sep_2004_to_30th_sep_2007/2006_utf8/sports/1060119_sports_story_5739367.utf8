 Lee echoes McGrath appeal

 - Kallis to miss rest of tour 

 Brett Lee 

Melbourne: Fast bowler Brett Lee believes Australian cricketers dont make frivolous appeals, but joined colleague Glenn McGrath here on Wednesday in conceding they had to be more careful with the way they treated umpires. 

Both bowlers have fallen foul of officialdom this summer, Lee for dissent and McGrath for obscene language, during the third Test against South Africa in Sydney earlier this month. 

Wicketkeeper-batsman Adam Gilchrist is also in trouble after being reported for dissent. 

Although Lee maintained the Australians only appealed when they believed an opponent to be out, he agreed that both he and his teammates had to respect umpires decisions. 

Theres a line you cant step over, and weve got to make sure that we dont do that, he said. 

Weve got to get to know the umpires a lot better and realise too that the umpires have only got 0.3 of a second to make up their minds, so its a very tough job. 

Weve got the aids here, cricketers and journalists, and people watching on TV at home that weve got the super slo-mo replays and we can say: thats definitely going to hit leg stump, or hes definitely nicked that, whereas a bowler or an umpire and maybe a batsman, in the heat of the moment, have only got a split-second to work out whats going on. 

Sometimes you want to know why that was possibly not out or why youve been given out and youve just got to learn to deal with it, accept the decision and get on with it. 

Meanwhile, allrounder Jacques Kallis has been ruled out of the remainder of South Africas tour of Australia because of problems with his injured elbow. 

South African selector Haroon Lorgat said in a statement on Wednesday that Kallis would return home to undergo immediate treatment. 

Kallis has been troubled by the injury for months and missed the first Test against Australia as well as this weeks one-day match with Sri Lanka. His place in the squad will be filled by uncapped all rounder Johan van der Wath.

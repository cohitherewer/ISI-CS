 Nadal draws Schuettler

 - Chennai open 

 Rafael Nadal works out in Chennai on Monday 

Chennai: Two-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal will take on German veteran Rainer Schuettler in the first round of the ATP Chennai Open, the draw for which was announced here on Saturday. 

For India, wild cards Prakash Amritraj and Karan Rastogi should be happy, not to be drawn against seeded players in the first round. 

Prakash, who has slid from his career-best 222 to 393, takes on higher-ranked Ivo Karlovic of Croatia (98), while Karan Rastogi faces 106th-ranked Thiago Alves of Brazil in their first round matches. 

However, Rastogi has a tough task ahead as he is slated to meet the winner of the Nadal-Schuettler match in Round II. 

Similarly, Amritraj is scheduled to take on David Nalbandian or Kristian Pless in second round, should he cross his first-round hurdle. 

Schuettler, however, sounded positive despite being drawn up against the might of Nadal: I will go to the court and do my best. May the better player win on the day. 

The head-to-head is tilted in favour of the Spanish ace, who has beaten the German twice (Dubai, 2006 and Miami, 2005) in three encounters. Schuettler has beaten the world No.2 in Basel in 2004. 

Former Davis Cup captain Vijay Amritraj felt that the field was strong and the Indians would have to play out of their skins to leave an impression. 

We expect some great matches from both Karan and Prakash. There are really no weak ties. The 32-player field is the strongest in the tournaments history and every match has got the potential to go the distance. 

The four qualifiers to the main draw will have to fight it out, Amritraj said. 

Echoing him, third seed Xavier Malisse, who is on his second visit to India after his debut ATP Tour in New Delhi in 1996 said, There are no easy matches and Ill have to give my 100 per cent. 

Meanwhile, Indian challenge ended in the qualifying event of the ATP Chennai Open here on Saturday with all four contenders biting the dust. Sriram Balaji Naryaswamy was the lone Indian to put up a fight, taking the first set to a tie-break before losing to Philipp Petzchner of Germany 6-7, 3-6. 

Three other Indians Vishal Punna, Ravishankar Pathanjali and Ashutosh Singh were eliminated in straight sets. (PTI)

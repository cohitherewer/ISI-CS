The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB to raise two points 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The CAB will make a couple of points vis-?-vis organising Champions Trophy games in October-November when BCCI officials meet representatives of the affiliate bodies in Mumbai to finalise details. 

Well tell them that we wont be in a position to host any match before October 23 as the pitch cant be prepared due to monsoon, said a CAB official after Mondays working committee meeting. Secondly we will protest BCCIs statement that the association hosting Champions Trophy matches wont be given any games next season.

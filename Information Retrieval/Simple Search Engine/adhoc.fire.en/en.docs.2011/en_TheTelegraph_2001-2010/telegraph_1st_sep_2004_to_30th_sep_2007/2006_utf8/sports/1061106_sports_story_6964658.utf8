Mumbai: Australia reaffirmed their status as the undisputed champions in world cricket by breaking the Champions Trophy jinx with an emphatic eight-wicket victory over title-holders West Indies in a rain-marred summit showdown on Sunday. 

Bundling defending champions the West Indies out for 138 in 30.4 overs, Australia were on victory course when play was interrupted by heavy showers. The loss of more than two hours of play forced the organisers to change the equation in the 50-over contest, reducing Australias target to 116 from 35 overs. 

World champions Australia sprinted to 116 for two in 28.1 overs to clinch the limited-overs trophy that had eluded it on four previous attempts since the biennial event began in 1998. 

Opener Shane Watson (57 not out) and Damien Martyn (47 not out) shared an unbroken 103-run partnership for the third wicket to steer Australia home after the early departure of Adam Gilchrist (2) and skipper Ponting (zero). Watsons 88-ball knock contained four boundaries, while Martyn had six fours from 71 balls. 

Winners of the past two World Cups, Australia were making their maiden appearance in the final of the Champions Trophy, crickets second biggest limited-overs tournament, despite their long reign as world No. 1. The Australians stumbled out of the semi-finals at the previous two tournaments. 

While Australia avenged their 10-run loss to the West Indies at the same venue in the tournaments group stage, no team has successfully defended a Champions Trophy title. 

Watson was named the Man of the Match for his allround show (he also took two wickets for 11) and Chris Gayle was adjudged the Man of the Series. 

The previous lowest total in the Champions Trophy final was Englands 217 in 2004. 

Earlier, paceman Nathan Bracken took three wickets in an inspired opening spell to help skittle West Indies for 138 in 30.4 overs after Brian Lara opted to bat. 

Bracken dismissed opener Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Ramnaresh Sarwan and the dangerous Gayle in a six-over burst, conceding 22 runs. 

In-form Gayle, who made a quickfire 37, and Chanderpaul (27) gave the holders a flying start, racing to 49 in five overs, but it was all downhill after Brackens decisive blows. 

Gayle, who lashed Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath for six fours and two sixes in his 27-ball knock, took the score to 80 before Bracken bowled him with a peach of an out-swinger in the 10th over to trigger a collapse. 

McGrath, who went for 22 in his first two overs, rediscovered his rhythm to dismiss Lara caught behind for two and Runako Morton also caught Adam Gilchrist for the same score. 

Watson induced Marlon Samuels to drive into Pontings hands at mid-wicket for seven and then dismissed Carlton Baugh leg before for nine. 

Brad Hogg removed Dwayne Bravo leg before for 21 as the holders collapsed to 125 for eight. Lee, who went for 36 in his first three overs, bowled Ian Bradshaw for seven while Corey Collymore was run out by Andrew Symonds to end the innings.

 We need Shoaib in England: Akram 

Islamabad: Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has said Shoaib Akhtar would not have missed the ongoing conditioning camp for the England series had skipper Inzamam-ul Haq attended it. 

Discipline always comes from the top and if Inzamam reports at the camp, Shoaib would also be there, the legendary left-arm bowler said. 

He said the country needed Shoaib for the tough tour of England but he was not sure if the fast bowler was fit enough to withstand the rigours of a full series. 

Shoaib is a match-winner and he has proved it on various occasions. The team requires a bowler of his calibre in England, he was quoted as saying in a newspaper. 

Wasim also singled out swing bowler Mohammed Asif for special praise, saying, Asif is a great asset for Pakistan who can serve for a long time. 

While hinting that pace bowlers would play a key role in the series, he said, Inzamam is right as the bowlers can perform only when there is a fighting score on the board. 

On the appointment of Jonty Rhodes as a fielding consultant, he said the South African should have been given more time as he could not perform miracles in two weeks. 

A long term planning is essential to improve fielding instead of calling Jonty two weeks only, he said. 

But he fully supported the appointment of Waqar Younis as the bowling coach of the team. Waqar has always wanted to coach bowlers and I hope he will do justice to the job. (PTI)

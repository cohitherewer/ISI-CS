Mumbai: Allrounder Andrew Flintoff said he is better equipped to handle the home spin attack after suffering a disappointing tour the last time England visited India. 

An inexperienced Flintoff was in the 2001-02 touring party and scored just 26 runs from five innings and generally struggled against the threat of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh. 

Ill be keen to score a few more runs than I did last time. Twenty-five wont be too hard to beat, he told reporters after Fridays practice session. 

I had just got back into the England side. Came out here and I thought I progressed as a bowler, but the batting didnt quite go according to plan, the 28-year-old said. 

I feel I know my game more now, have played a lot more cricket against various spin bowlers, quick bowlers and medium pacers and I think Ive progressed since then, he said. 

Meanwhile, Test opener Wasim Jaffer and young fast bowlers Abid Nabi and Munish Ansari will face England in their opening three-day tour match against the CCI Presidents XI, led by Nilesh Kulkarni, at the Brabourne Stadium on Saturday. 

It has been agreed that all 16 members of the touring party will get to play at some point in the match.

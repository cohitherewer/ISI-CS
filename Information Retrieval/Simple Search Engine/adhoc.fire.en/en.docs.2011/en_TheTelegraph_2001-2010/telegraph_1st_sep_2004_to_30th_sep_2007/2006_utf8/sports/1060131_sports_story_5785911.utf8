 Sourav has been humiliated, says Sidhu

Jalandhar: Lashing out at the national selectors for ignoring Sourav Ganguly for the one-dayers against Pakistan, former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday said the treatment being meted out to the ex-skipper was humiliating and unjust. 

The former opening batsman said Sourav was a proven performer in one-dayers and there was no reason why he should be kept out of the one-day scheme. 

Not including Sourav in the one-day squad is unjust as he has many a times proved his mettle in ODIs. He is basically the right player for ODIs, Sidhu told reporters here while terming the decision of the selectors as an attempt to humiliate the former captain. 

Ever since the e-mail controversy, Sourav has been humiliated by being kept out of the team without any reason, he said. 

On the on-going third Test, Sidhu said at last a result could be expected from the match after the draws in the first two ties.

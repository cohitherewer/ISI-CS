 AFC suggestions to be discussed

 - Changes in AIFF election process

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Does the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) feel that the election process for the principal office bearers of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is much tilted in favour of the present incumbents and unfair to new aspirants? 

Thats the impression, to say the least, one forms after going through the amendments that have been proposed by the Asian body to be made in the AIFF constitution. The amendments will come up for discussion and approval in the special general body meeting of the federation on May 26 in the capital. 

According to the article 24.2 of the AIFF constitution, which came into force a couple of months before the last federation elections in 2004, made it mandatory for anyone to contest for the post of president or treasurer to get his name proposed by at least five state associations/institution members of the federation. While many then felt it to be only a ploy to strengthen the hands of federation supremo Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, federation officials claimed it was done in line with the Fifa/AFC guidelines. 

While the Fifa secretary, Urs Linsi, in a letter to AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has praised the AIFF constitution as high standard, the AFC, in their proposed AIFF Statute Revisions has asked for amendment of the article 24.2 of the constitution and has deleted the following lines: A candidate for the post of president or treasurer shall be proposed by at least five permanent/associate members. A permanent and/or an associate member can propose the names of only one candidate for the post of president. A permanent and/or an associate member can propose the names of only one candidate for the post of treasurer. However if such nominations (proposed) signed by the president or secretary of state association is challenged by any of them, it shall not be valid. 

The AFC proposal, however, remain silent on article 24.4 of the AIFF constitution, which also calls for the support of five members for contesting for the posts of president, treasurer, vice-presidents and executive members. 

According to federation insiders, if the proposed change in the constitution is accepted by the general body, it will once again pave the way for anyone to contest for the top posts without bothering to get the backing of five state associations. Mustering support of five associations looked an impossible task as no one was ready to sign the proposals fearing backlash from the ruling group. 

When asked, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco preferred to remain tightlipped on the issue. The entire thing is an internal matter of the AIFF and will be discussed in the meeting. I will not make any comment on it.

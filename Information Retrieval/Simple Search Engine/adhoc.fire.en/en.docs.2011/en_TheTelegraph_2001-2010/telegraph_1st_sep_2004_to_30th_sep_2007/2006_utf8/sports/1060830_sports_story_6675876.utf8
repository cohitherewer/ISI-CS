 Shoaib strives to find rhythm

 - ODIs vs ENGLAND 

 Bristol: Shoaib Akhtar said he was looking forward to playing his part in a lethal Pakistan one-day team during their forthcoming series against England. 

The Rawalpindi Express marked his return to international cricket after a six-month absence with one for 31 as Pakistan, in their maiden Twenty20 International, beat England by five wickets at the Nevil ground here on Monday. 

It was all right. After a six-month lay-off, to come back in a Twenty20 is never easy, Akhtar said when asked about his Bristol performance. 

Just finding my rhythm is more important and I need to do that as quickly as possible, added. We are a very lethal one-day team right now and we would just like to continue winning. 

But there was consolation to be had in the England senior debuts of fast bowler Stuart Broad, denied a hattrick by Man-of-the-Match Shahid Afridi, and allrounder Michael Yardy, who scored 24 not out and took a wicket with his left-arm spin. 

Trescothick praised the performance of 20-year-old. 

I think hes a good prospect and the way he approached it and the fashion he bowled in was encouraging.

 Sachin will make Moin eat his words: Engineer

London: Former Indian wicketkeeper batsman Farokh Engineer has strongly dismissed Moin Khans observation saying Sachin Tendulkar was certainly not on decline and will bounce back to make the Pakistani eat his words. 

Sachin has reached his peak but certainly he is not on the decline. He will bounce back and make Moin Khan eat his words. Experience will only make him better, Engineer said. 

Engineer was reacting Moins recent column in which he had written I get that the downhill journey for the little champion has started... What prompted Sachin to leave the pitch... Hostile bowling by Shoaib Akhtar, or the tension-filled dressing room atmosphere that often gets on the nerves of the batsmen who start feeling suffocated? 

Former England captain Nasser Hussain also guarded Sachin against any criticism saying the Indian was one of the greatest batsmen ever . 

Watch out any one who writes off Tendulkar, Hussain said after receiving the HSBC life time achievement award 2005 organised by Sony Entertainment Television.

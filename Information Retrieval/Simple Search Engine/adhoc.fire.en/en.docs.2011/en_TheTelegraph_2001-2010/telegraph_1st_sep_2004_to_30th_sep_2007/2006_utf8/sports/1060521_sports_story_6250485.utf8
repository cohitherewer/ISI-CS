 Hingis tames Venus

Rome: Martina Hingis overcame a nightmarish start to pip Venus Williams 0-6, 6-3, 6-3 to the final of the WTA Italian Open on Saturday. 

Hingis will meet Dinara Safina who emerged victorious from a two-and-a-half hour battle, beating fellow-Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. 

At the Hamburg ATP meet, Czech Radek Stepanek beat Argentinas Jose Acasuso 6-4, 7-6 to reach the final of the Hamburg Masters. 

Stepanek will face Spaniard Tommy Robredo who beat Mario Ancic 7-5, 6-4. Both will be bidding for their maiden Masters Series title on Sunday. 

With the umbrella-like retractable roof over centre court closed to keep out the frequent showers, Stepanek broke the unseeded Argentine in the first game of the match on another chilly day at the Am Rothenbaum. 

That was enough to clinch the first set and he sealed the second-set tiebreak 7-5 on his first match point when Acasuso netted a forehand. 

In doubles, Mahesh Bhupathi and Robby Ginepri lost 4-6, 6-7 (2-7) to German wild card Rainer Schuettler and Michael Kohlmann. 

Stepanek, who will break into the worlds top-10 for the first time, said he had received a message of congratulation from girlfriend Hingis. (agencies)

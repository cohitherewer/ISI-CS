 India drub Korea, in semis

Kuala Lumpur: India made light of a three-hour rain interruption and a yellow card suspension to score a convincing 3-0 win over Korea and sail into the semi-finals of the 15th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup eight-nation hockey tournament here on Wednesday. 

 The win, which came through goals from Tejbir Singh (11th), Sandeep Singh (15th) and Tushar Khandekar (53rd), marked Indias reaching the last-four stage in a major international event for the first time since 2003 when they won the Asia Cup. 

India, who lost their opening match to Australia 1-4, ended the league engagements with six points from three matches. 

The 1995 champions dictated the pace and exchanges against the Koreans whose sloppy midfield play also contributed to their defeat.

 Bashar wants to finish with win 

Jaipur: Bangladesh captain Habibul Bashar desperately wants to end his Champions Trophy campaign on a winning note with his teams final qualifying match against Zimbabwe on Friday. 

We need to win this game and get our pride back, Bashar said. Bashar is yet to score a run in Champions Trophy qualifying, in which Bangladesh have lost to Sri Lanka and the defending champions the West Indies so far. 

We came here in this tournament to do a lot better and we want to win at least one game, Bashar said. 

Both Bangladesh and Zimbabwe are out of contention for the main round of the biennial limited-overs tournament, while the West Indies and Sri Lanka have already earned their berths. 

The African team will have some confidence heading into Fridays match after beating Bangladesh 3-2 at home in a five-match limited-overs series earlier this year. 

We need to be on top when we play Bangladesh tomorrow, said Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran. We beat them 3-2 recently, we have that advantage.

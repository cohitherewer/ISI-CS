 Team wont be affected: Yousuf

 Mohammed Yousuf in Lahore on Friday 

Karachi: Pakistans chances in the Champions Trophy would not be affected by Younis Khans sudden decision, new captain Mohammed Yousuf said on Friday. 

Yousuf also dismissed reports of a rift among players and claimed the team was united despite the Younis blow. 

The team is united and Younis stepping down will not harm our chances, Yousuf told reporters in Lahore. 

We have a balanced side and know what lies ahead. We will stand up to it, said Yousuf. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer, reeling under the fresh controversy, admitted that the players needed to change their attitude if they wanted to succeed. 

Younis decision to turn down the captaincy shows a lack of attitude and we need to change this attitude if we want to be world-beaters, Woolmer said.

New Delhi: Indias Sania Mirza went down to Elena Dementieva of Russia in the third round of the $2.1 million Pacific Life Open at Indian Wells on Monday. 

Sania bagged the first set and also grabbed a few opportunities in the next two but faltered on crucial points as the fourth-seeded Russian Dementieva won 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 to advance to the fourth round of the Tier I tournament. 

The Indian broke the World No. 8 eight times and allowed her only 38 per cent of points on her second serve. Dementieva also served a shocking 18 double faults. 

Dementieva admitted she had been in trouble throughout the match. 

I was in trouble the whole match. It was not easy to win. I dont think I was playing my best, she said. 

She said the 45th ranked Indian surprised her with her acceleration from the elbow, which was very unusual for a girl. 

I think it was a very tough match. You know, first time we were playing against each other. I was very surprised with her forehand. She has such a good forehand, such a good acceleration from the elbow. 

Its different. Like I said, she has acceleration from the elbow, which is very unusual for a girl. That makes the ball goes very fast and flat. Its difficult to play this one back. She feels very confident with the shot. She always goes for the winner. 

Dementieva also said Sania had everything in her to reach the top 10 as she was nimble-footed, a fighter and that she had some dangerous shots in her armoury. 

Its hard to say (if she will be able to be among the top 10 by the end of the year). She has everything to do it. But I dont know how soon can, Dementieva said.

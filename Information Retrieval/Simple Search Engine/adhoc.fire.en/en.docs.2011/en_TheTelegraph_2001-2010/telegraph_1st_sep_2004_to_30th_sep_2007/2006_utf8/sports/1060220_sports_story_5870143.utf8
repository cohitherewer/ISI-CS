The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont want to be seen as a one-day player

 - Unfortunately in India, fielding is never given much importance at coaching centres 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Mohammed Kaif 

Karachi: Mohammed Kaif is crucial to Greg Chappells plans for Mission 2007. The Uttar Pradesh batsman has come a long way from being known for his athletic fielding to a recognized middle-order bat in the one-dayers. The affable, big-hearted and always jovial Kaif spoke to The Telegraph on Saturday evening. 

The following are excerpts: 

 Q You are increasingly being branded as a one-day player. Does it affect you? 

 I think I am gradually getting 

 to be an integral part of Team India in the shorter version 

 of the game. I have done well in the last couple of months, 

 but theres no guarantee that I will be in the Test 

 squad. In the last five years, I have played only eight 

 Tests. 

Given a choice I would give Test cricket top priority. One would love to perform consistently in Tests than in one-dayers. I dont want to be seen as a one-day player. But this is something which is not in my control. 

I have performed in the Tests and at the domestic level whenever the opportunity has arrived. Uttar Pradesh won the Ranji Trophy this time under my leadership. You also have to ask the selectors about it? My goal is just to keep performing. I also realize Im getting older everyday. 

How do you view Chappells policy of promoting the youngsters? 

Its good? The guys have been performing and thats the key. The coach and captain do make a difference to the performance of an individual, but ultimately it is the player who has to go out there and do it on the field. Their success has been great for the team. 

What difference have you seen in the functioning of John Wright and Chappell? 

I dont want to compare them, but the style and functioning of each and every individual is different. We played the World Cup final under John and he did a good job. 

Greg is gelling well with the team and the guys are also understanding him. He has been around for eight months now, and the experience has been good. 

 Has there been any difference between them as far as preparing for a match is concerned? 

 Both have shared their experiences and worked hard with the players. The ways of two different individuals can never be the same. John did a good job in his own way. Greg, too, has his own style of functioning and has been successful. 

 Did you undertake any special drills to improve your fielding or it just came naturally? 

 It all started during the formative years at the Kanpur hostel. We used to have fun in the rain playing soccer and softball cricket. It takes time to master the art of diving and throwing one on the field. The first time you dive you get injured. Its a matter of trying, falling, getting up and again trying. You should be brave enough to get the technique right and have the guts to live with the pain. I always used to enjoy doing it and one day I found it was coming rather naturally. 

Unfortunately in India, fielding is never given much importance at coaching centres. You take a few catches and pick up and throw a few balls? That is how it ends for most on a given day. Most of the emphasis is on batting and bowling at nets. This culture needs to change. 

You always bat at No. 5 or 6. Isnt it a problem to score runs at that position? 

Its tough in the sense that you get less number of overs to bat. But its a team game and you should stick to it and perform accordingly. The team always comes first. I have no complaints for batting lower down the order. 

Your most memorable innings so far? 

 Quite a few? The century against Zimbabwe in Colombo in the Champions Trophy in 2002, the match-winning knock in the NatWest final at Lords the same year? Our Ranji Trophy win after 72 years will also remain special. 

 Do you think you have got your due? 

 I dont think about those things. I concentrate only on my game. When the country wins I feel proud, enjoy the moment and relive the memory. I dont have any long-term goals? In the end, only performance counts. That keeps me going. Its a great honour and pride to wear the India colours. For me, there are no regrets? Life goes on.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India require a centralised coaching hub: Houghton

 - Without long-term planning, even the worlds best manager wont be of any help 

JAYDEEP BASU

Bangalore: Bob Houghton has taken over as the national coach around three months ago. Since then, India have played twice against Saudi Arabia and conceded 10 goals. The British coach says that he is not disappointed, but a change in the system is the biggest priority for Indian football today. He spoke to The Telegraph about it on the eve of the Asian Cup qualifier against Japan. 

The following are excerpts: 

 Q: 

 Having conceded 19 goals in four matches, India 

 are down and out of the Asian Cup qualifiers. Is there any 

 focus left for the match against Japan? 

 A: Certainly, 

 there is focus still left. At least thats the way 

 I look at it. I do agree that qualifying for the next round 

 became out of question even before I took over. What I am 

 looking forward at the moment is good performance from the 

 boys. We have certain plans and strategies. We can work 

 it out and put up a good fight against Japan. 

 Can we beat Japan? 

 No one can predict the result 

 before the match is actually played. 

 Can we come anywhere near beating them? 

 Or draw with them? 

 I told you it is not right to 

 predict the outcome of a match. But I am sure we can play 

 well against Japan. In the last two matches against Saudi 

 Arabia, we lost but didnt do too badly in the initial 

 stages. For the first half an hour, in both the matches, 

 my boys played well. In fact in the away match, we took 

 the lead. 

 Then what happened for the rest of the 

 sixty minutes? 

 Thats the problem. We couldnt 

 apply ourselves and play according to our plans. That cost 

 us dearly on both occasions. Against Japan here, we should 

 be able to repair our earlier mistakes and play as per our 

 real strength. 

 Of late, you have been talking about qualifying 

 for the 2014 World Cup? How feasible are your plans? 

 I never said India would qualify 

 for the 2014 World Cup finals. All I said that India should 

 now plan for the 2014 edition. For the World Cup in 2010, 

 India have no chance. It is as simple as that. Fourteen 

 months from now the World Cup qualifiers will start. I find 

 it difficult to imagine India qualifying for it. There is 

 no magic involved in it. You have to plan properly and do 

 things. Otherwise, a country placed 136 in the world cannot 

 leap forward to get into final 32. 

 Have you given your plans to the All India 

 Football Federation? 

 Yes, I have, recently in Delhi. 

 I had a meeting with the top brass of the federation there. 

 I told them that there should be centralised coaching centre 

 for all national teams. All age group teams should be brought 

 under one umbrella of coaching system. Players from the 

 under-16 team should gradually get into the next stage, 

 may be the under-19 team and they should graduate to the 

 senior team. A system is needed. It cant be done haphazardly. 

 Do you want to coach all the teams? 

 No, nothing like that. Each team 

 should have at least two coaches and they should be permanent 

 for a considerable period of time. What I mean to say is 

 that there cannot be a short-term policy. What Japan are 

 today is because of their long-term policy. To match them, 

 India would also have to have similar policies. You cant 

 just practice for only a couple of weeks and hope to beat 

 a team like Japan, who may be planning for a couple of decade. 

 But here, even you 

 havent got a permanent support staff. This is you 

 second set of support staff in three matches. Dont 

 you need one? 

 Yes, I do need it and have told 

 the federation about it. They have assured me about it and 

 I hope to get it soon. 

 You have been talking about 2014. But 

 you only have a three-year contract with the AIFF? 

 My contract is not the issue. 

 What I am suggesting is that we should introduce a proper 

 system for taking the game forward. Without that, nothing 

 will happen even if you bring the best coach in the world. 

 The AIFF can offer me a 10-year contract, but without proper 

 planning and system, nothing is going to move forward. I 

 will be no help. If you adopt the modern system, things 

 will move, no matter I be there or not. 

 Do these present lot of boys have any 

 future in international football?

 Certainly they have. Quite a few 

 of them are in the under-23 age group, and I hope to take 

 them to the Asian Games. In fact, I am impressed with some 

 of them, but I wont like to name them on the eve of 

 the match. The only problem is their physical fitness. It 

 has to be improved drastically. To play football in the 

 international circuit, you need to have superb physical 

 fitness. I also need some taller boys in the team. 

 But India do not have too many taller 

 players

 Yes, I know. Every time I talk 

 about it, I am told about great Indian footballers, who 

 were short in height. I agree that they were great players 

 and height is not always a problem to become good players. 

 But a team does need some tall players in certain positions. 

 Without tall players, a team becomes handicapped in international 

 football.

 Anand out of 2800 club 

New Delhi: Viswanathan Anands below-par performance in Chess Olympiad cost him dear as he lost some precious points to drop out of the elite 2800 Elo club. 

The fall shattered Anands chances of claiming the world No. 1 rank but he was still able to maintain his second place in the latest Fide ratings. 

Anand, who had reached the dream mark in the previous list in April after winning the Corus title for a record fifth time, ended up with a debit of a whopping 24 points to slip to Elo 2779 from 2803. 

World No. 1 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria further improved his ratings by nine points to reach Elo 2813 and increase the gap between him and Anand. 

Among other Indians, P. Harikrishna gained two points and maintained his 25th position with the Elo 2682 while K. Sasikiran lost five places to be 26th with Elo 2681 after losing 11 points. Harikirshna is second in the juniors list behind Radjabov Teimour of Azerbaijan. (PTI)

 SA to host Twenty20 world meet

Dubai: South Africa will host the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship in September next year, International Cricket Council said today. 

The ICC Twenty20 World Championship will feature 12 teams including all the 10 Test playing nations in a nine-day event, the world body announced after its executive board meeting here. 

The members of the ICC board have embraced Twenty20 cricket while at the same time managing its growth, said ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

South Africa has been an early-adopter of Twenty20 cricket and would be an excellent first venue for the Twenty20 world championship. 

Pakistan will hold the event in 2008 while England, who introduced the format, are scheduled to hold it in 2009. 

The championship then moves to the West Indies and Sri Lanka in 2010 and 2012, respectively, with an years gap in 2011 when the ICC World Cup would be held in the Asian subcontinent. 

The hosts for the 2013 edition was yet to be confirmed while Bangladesh will hold it in 2014.

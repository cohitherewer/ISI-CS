 USA stretch Australia

Colombo: Australia were made to sweat by a spirited USA before the two-time champions managed a 4-wicket victory against the minnows in an under-19 World Cup cricket match on Thursday. 

Australia scored the 149 runs they needed to win in just 24.1 overs but lost six wickets in the process. 

It took 37 from William Sheridan and 31 from Aaron finch to bring things under control as the pair added 69 and bailed the team out from 53 for four. 

The win confirmed Australia as the winners of group B and means they will play the runners-up of group C, either Sri Lanka or India, in the Super League quarter final, on Saturday. 

Left-arm spinner Jon Holland was the man who set up the win for Australia by capturing 4 for 39. 

His effort, together with three wickets for Henriques (3/21) and two successes for Adam Ritchard (2/23), meant the winless tournament newcomers were dismissed in 42.5 overs.

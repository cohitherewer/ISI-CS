Seoul: Jeev Milkha Singhs terrific run over the last few weeks continued as the Indian finished a creditable tied second in the $600,000 SK Telecom Open at the Sky 72 Golf Course here Sunday. 

Jeev was three shots behind first-time winner, Prom Meesawat, who finally underlined his great potential with a maiden win on the Asian Tour. 

Meesawat, co-leader after 36 holes, added a final round of 68 despite two bogeys in last three holes to finish at 15-Under 201 in a tournament reduced to 54 holes following a washout of the third round. 

Jeev, winner of the Volvo China Open last month, struck a final round of two-under 70 to finish at 12-under 204 and in a tie for second with Korean Lee Seung Ho (70). 

The two picked up a little over $50,000 each, while Meesawat pocketed $120,000 for the win. 

Indias Harmeet Kahlon (75) was tied 43rd and Amandeep Johl (71) was tied 47th. 

It was a little disappointing on the final day, but hats off to Prom for some great golf. He deserves this maiden win, said Jeev, whose latest cheque has extended his lead at the top of UBS Order of Merit. 

Jeev with $442,526 is more than $100,000 ahead of second placed Charlie Wi of Korea, who has $329,758. Jeev is in a position to cross half-a-million mark this season. 

I am happy that I am playing well enough to be in contention more often, added Jeev, who now has four top-10 finishes in his last five starts. 

He had a tied seventh at TCL Classic, won the Volvo China Open, was tied 26th in BMW Asian Open, then tied 10th in Crowns on Japan Tour. 

I will be going back to Japan Tour, where there is a very big event, the Japan PGA Championships, next week, said Jeev. 

Starting the day at 10-under and one behind Meesawat and Iain Steel, the overnight leaders, Jeev gave a good chase, but Meesawat, considered to be a worthy youngster in the footsteps of other Thai greats like Thongchai Jaidee and Thaworn Wiratchant, was upto the task. 

He was in fact in terrific form with a three-under 33 for front nine, which included an eagle on the par-5 third hole. He started the back nine with more birdies on 10th and 11th and then came another one on 13th, at which stage he was 17-under and a clear winner unless he choked in the final five holes. 

The Indian ace went through the front nine in one-under 35 with three birdies and two bogeys. He had birdies on third, fifth and sixth, but bogeys on second and seventh meant, he was still playing catch-up. 

With five to go, Prom was 17-under and Jeev 12-under and despite a birdie on 15th, the Indian was still four behind. Jeev again dropped a shot on 16th but then so did Prom. Jeev parred the last two holes, and Prom despite a bogey on closing 18th, was a clear winner by three. 

Hawaiian schoolgirl Michelle Wie struggled in strong winds to card a two-over-par 74 in the final round on Sunday. After becoming the first woman to make the cut at a major mens Tour event in 61 years on Friday, 16-year-old Wie finished tied for 35th with a combined three-under par, 12 shots behind winner Prom Meesawat of Thailand. 

Kahlon looked set for a good finish as he went through the front nine in one-under 35 and was inside top-20, but he then shot four bogeys in a row from 12 th to 15th to finish the back nine in 40 and drop to tied 43rd at two-under 214 for three rounds. 

Johl, who just about squeezed inside the cut, made a decent recovery to shoot 71 despite a double bogey on 17th and finished tied 47th. 

Prom, who was the joint halfway leader with Malaysias Iain Steel, got off the blocks early with an eagle at the par five 541 yard third hole. He then struck a birdie at the fifth hole before firing birdies at the 10 th, 11th holes and 13th holes. The 23-year-old stumbled with two bogeys on the 16th and 18th hole but it didnt matter in the end. (Agencies)

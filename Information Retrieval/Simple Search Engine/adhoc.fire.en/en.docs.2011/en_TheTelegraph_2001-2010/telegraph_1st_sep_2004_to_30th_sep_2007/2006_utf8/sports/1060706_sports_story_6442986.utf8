 Dalmiya gets CAB support

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: On June 19, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said that he didnt want Jagmohan Dalmiya to contest the ensuing CAB elections, alleging that cricket has suffered a lot during his presidency. 

On Wednesday, however, Dalmiya got the nod of the working committee, which refuted the CMs allegations. 

The working committee felt strongly that we should continue with the good work that we have done so far, said Dalmiya at a press conference after Wednesdays meeting. 

Asked whether he will contest the elections at the July 30 AGM, Dalmiya said: I will decide it at my convenience. 

Dalmiyas letter to state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty, regarding the state of the game, was discussed at the meeting. The members reviewed all aspects including the performance of the Ranji team last season, and unanimously agreed that a commendable effort has been made for the development of cricket. 

Dalmiya took the chance to garner support in his battle with the BCCI. The working committee strongly condemned the BCCIs action as baseless and arbitrary. 

A resolution was passed by the members that the CAB should write to the BCCI, strongly protesting the latters decision to debit Rs 40 crore and stop all subsidies to the CAB. 

Also, if no satisfactory reply was received from the BCCI, the CAB should proceed with appropriate legal action.

 Sania has the ability to get into top-10 

 - Amritraj fears void in mens tennis after Paes, Bhupathi

New Delhi: Sania Mirza has not been playing too consistently this season, but Vijay Amritraj feels its only a matter of days before the Hyderabadi blossoms into one of worlds best players in the WTA circuit. 

The former world No. 16, who was in the capital on Sunday for the launch of Delhi half marathon scheduled on October 15, said there is nothing to be disappointed about the glamour girl of Indian tennis as she was moving in the right direction. 

The problem in India is that people tend to expect too much from the top players. What these people dont understand is that one does not become the worlds number one player overnight, Amritraj said. 

It is a continuous process and one has to go through it before achieving the desired target. Amritraj, who had beaten almost every top player around the world during his playing days, sounded confident about Sanias rise in the circuit. 

Asked whether Sania, currently ranked 44, has the ability to break into the top-10 in the world, Amritraj said: Certainly. Only thing she has to work hard on some aspects of her technical things. Like everyone else, she too has some technical faults. It needs to be corrected. I am quite sure that Sania knows about these things and her coaches must be working on those lines. 

Amritraj said it is that constant desire to improve that keeps one going. You dont play with an aim to become worlds best player. Even Roger Federer doesnt do it in that way. What a good player wants is to improve. 

What really impressed Amritraj, a legend himself in Indian tennis, about Sania is her mental make up. She really has a strong mind, the former India Davis Cup captain said about the 19-year-old girl. I am quite impressed by the way she handles the media and the mounting pressure on her to perform. I firmly believe she has the ability to get into the top-10 in the world. She has the game, has time on her side and most importantly, has a strong mind. 

Asked then why Sanias ranking has been dipping regularly for the last few months, Amritraj said: There is nothing to worry about. In tennis, ups and downs are part of the game. She had a wonderful season last year. It is not easy to deliver the goods at the same pace everytime. 

Overall, Indian sport is on the rise, according to the star of Chennai. Ten years ago it was difficult to imagine an Indian girl to be among worlds top 50 tennis player or to have a top chess player and golfer from our country. These are all realities now. Things, I am sure, would be even more better in future. 

Amritraj also lamented the dearth of serious world-beating talent in the Indian mens tennis circuit and feared a void once Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi left the scene. There has not been a single Indian player in the top-100 of the ATP rankings after Paes, which is not a happy situation, he said. 

Taking former Australian cricketer Dean Jones to task for his remark on South Africas Hashim Amla, he said racism and personal insults had no place in broadcasting. 

Such kind of comments and remarks cannot be allowed by commentators and there is no way what Jones said can be condoned, Amritraj told reporters.

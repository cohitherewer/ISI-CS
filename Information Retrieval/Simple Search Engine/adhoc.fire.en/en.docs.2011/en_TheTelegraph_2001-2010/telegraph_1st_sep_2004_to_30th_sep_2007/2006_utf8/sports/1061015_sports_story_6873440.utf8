 Prasanta happy with 3 points

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Gurgaon: Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee on Saturday admitted that his team couldnt impress in the group A opener against Haryana, but said he was happy to get three points. 

In a four-team group league, it is always important to start the campaign with three points, he said. Now I have a day in hand before we take on Goa in the crucial tie. We can plan our things now. 

Asked why striker Syed Rahim Nabi looked lacklustre, Banerjee said he was uncomfortable as a forward. He has been playing as a midfielder in the national team. Perhaps that was the reason why he was coming down so often.

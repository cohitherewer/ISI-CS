Montego Bay: Virender Sehwag had a mixed outing as the Indians looked for early form in the Caribbean in a practice game against a Jamaica XI at Jarrett Park Tuesday. 

 India were 289 for seven in 50 overs. Suresh Raina 

 retired with a top score of 50. Mohammed Kaif made 49. other 

 significant contributions came from Mahendra Singh Dhoni 

 (45), Virender Sehwag (33) and Rahul Dravid (31). 

The visitors were 98 for 2 after 20 overs with openers Sehwag and Dravid cooling their heels in the shade. 

The dashing opener raised 33 on the board in an innings which had a fair share of misses and edges behind the stumps and a few trademark audacious flaps over the point region. 

A drive through covers and then a screaming one past the bowler suggested he was coming to grips with the local quicks and a double-paced wicket. 

Off the very next delivery, a casual attempt to dab a shot past the slip cordon caused the Delhi batsmans undoing. Dravid (31), in contrast, moved into top gear early, and for a few signs of developing cramps, his was a typical innings.He cast a few glances back at umpire Cecil Fletcher after being given out leg before on a delivery which was definitely headed down the leg stump if it had not inner edged the bat on to the pads. 

The impressive crowd at the Jarrett Park was disproportionate to the occasion and most certainly on a working day. 

There was a huge gasp of horror from the stands when two overthrows resulted from a single delivery. 

The fielder at square leg took a shy at the batsman and missed the target. The throw was recovered by the point fielder who, however, managed a throw that cleared the mid-on fielder. Now it was the turn of mid-on to lob the ball on the offside clear of all fielders. 

Dravid didnt mind his single accruing additional three runs. The hosts were galvanised with two quick wickets after appearing pretty out of place and overcome with the occasion. 

New ball bowlers Darren Powell and Jermaine Lawson lived up to their status but effort in the field was comical. Once a fielder at mid-wicket fell much before the spooned catch from Sehwag had really arrived. 

Indians have left out Robin Uthappa, Ramesh Powar and Sreesanth from their line-up. 

Munaf Patel is the 12th man who could be used later in the day.

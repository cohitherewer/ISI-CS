 Atapattu ruled out

Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Maravan Atapattu will miss his teams forthcoming tour of England after failing to recover from a career-threatening back injury. 

Mahela Jayawardene has been appointed captain and Kumar Sangakkara vice-captain for the ten-week, three-Test tour starting later this week. 

We were hoping that the injury would heal naturally with rest but a scan has revealed that there is no improvement and we now have to consider surgery, physiotherapist Tommy Simsek said. 

Jehan Mubarak has been named as Atapattus replacement. (Reuters)

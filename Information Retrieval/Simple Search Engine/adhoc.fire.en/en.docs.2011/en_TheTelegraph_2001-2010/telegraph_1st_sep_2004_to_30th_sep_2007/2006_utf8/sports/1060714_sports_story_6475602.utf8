 CAB incentives for clubs 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: In a new move, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) has decided to award performance-based incentives to local clubs playing in the first and second divisions. 

Announcing this on Thursday, a CAB official said that these awards will be given to the clubs on the associations annual day function on July 23. 

East Bengal, the CAB league winners, will be awarded with Rs 20,000 and the runners-up Sporting Union will be richer by Rs 15,000. Even the clubs who have made it to the pre-quarter stage, will also come under the periphery of this scheme. 

The winners of CAB knockout (Sporting Union), J.C. Mukherjee (jointly shared by East Bengal and Kalighat), A.N. Ghosh (Sporting Union) and P. Sen Trophy (Kalighat) will get a cash prize of Rs 10,000 each and the runners-up will bag Rs 7,500 each. 

Meanwhile, the second division league champions will get Rs 10,000 and the knock-out winners will receive Rs 6,000.

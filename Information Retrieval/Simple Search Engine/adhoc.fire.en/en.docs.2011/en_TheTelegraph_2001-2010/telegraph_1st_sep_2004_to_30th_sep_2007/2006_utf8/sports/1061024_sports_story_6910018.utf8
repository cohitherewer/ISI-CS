 Vincent hails 

 NZ rock 

 SHARP SINGLES

 Mohali: 

 All set to become the most capped ODI captain ever, 

 New Zealands Stephen Fleming on Monday received rich 

 praise from teammate Lou Vincent, who said he was the motivating 

 force for all players in the side.

 He is the rock of the team. 

 He makes the decisions and we follow him. We all respect 

 him as a player, person and captain, the 27-year-old 

 allrounder said. I have played my whole career under 

 him and hope to do so in future, he told reporters 

 here on Monday. Praise 

 for Australia Sydney: 

 The ease with which Australia neutered Englands 

 potent batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff will 

 give them heart for the Ashes campaign, the Australian media 

 said on Monday. The 

 methodical ease with which the Australians neutered Englands 

 most potent batting threats, Pietersen and Flintoff, emerged 

 as the key finding from what was more a preliminary reading 

 than a dress rehearsal, a newspaper reported.

 Spurs win by a brace

 Premier League

 London: Dimitar Berbatov 

 scored his first goal for Tottenham Hotspur when the Londoners 

 beat Sheffield United 2-0 in the Premier League on Tuesday.

 Berbatov opened the scoring after 

 seven minutes with a straightforward shot from an Aaron 

 Lennon cross and then knocked down a Robbie Keane pass into 

 the path of Jermaine Jenas for the second 10 minutes later.

 Watford, promoted via the playoffs 

 last season, picked up their first point with a 1-1 draw 

 at home to West Ham United.

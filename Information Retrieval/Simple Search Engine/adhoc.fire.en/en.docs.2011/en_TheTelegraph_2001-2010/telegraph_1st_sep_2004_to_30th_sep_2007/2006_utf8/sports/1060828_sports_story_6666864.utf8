 Shiv Kapur in 63rd spot

Akron (US): Shiv Kapur, who played four years of golf while in college in the United States, continued to take lessons in the sport, carding a two-over 72 with even world No. 1 Tiger Woods struggling on the fast-running greens at the WGC Invitational at Firestone Country Club. 

Kapurs round saw him aggregate a score of nine-over 219 for three rounds and he now lies 63rd. He had birdies on first and eighth and bogeys on sixth, seventh, 14th and 18th. 

Though his driving was fairly accurate, he managed only 56 per cent greens in regulation and needed 30 putts to get through the round. 

An unexpected collapse by Woods threw the meet wide open after third round. 

One ahead at the start of the day and ideally placed to push on and win his fourth consecutive PGA Tour title, the 30-year-old American dropped four shots in a row on his way to a one-over-par 71. 

That left Woods tied for second at eight-under 202, a stroke behind pacesetting American Stewart Cink who fired a joint best-of-the-day 64. 

Level with Woods were compatriot and playing partner Davis Love III, after a roller-coaster 70, and Briton Paul Casey (64).

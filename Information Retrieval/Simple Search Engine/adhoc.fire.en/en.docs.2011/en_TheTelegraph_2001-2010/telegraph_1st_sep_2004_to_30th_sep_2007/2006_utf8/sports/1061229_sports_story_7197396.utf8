 Zaheer: Test is wide open

Zaheer Khan interacted with the Media on Thursday evening. The following are excerpts: 

Right now, the Test is wide open... Weve got to work hard and be positive... At this moment, one cant say whether we will go for a win or try and save the match... The entire fourth day is going to be very important... Weve got to keep the same intensity throughout and early wickets will help... Of course, were up for it... Sreesanth has been bowling exceptionally and is a great find for India... Ive been unlucky in the second innings... Lets see what happens tomorrow... If conditions are overcast, its going to be helpful...

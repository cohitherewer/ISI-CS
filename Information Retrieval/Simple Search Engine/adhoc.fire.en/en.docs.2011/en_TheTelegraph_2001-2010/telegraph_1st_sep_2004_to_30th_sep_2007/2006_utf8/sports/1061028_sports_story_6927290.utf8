The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont think Ive done any wonders 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ahmedabad: During the last home series against Australia, the Board of Control for Cricket in India had got Sunil Gavaskar to work with coach John Wright. That experiment fell through following confusion over their roles. 

The West Indies, though, had no such problems when Clive Lloyd, chairman of the West Indies Cricket Board cricket committee, joined the squad for the Champions Trophy. Coach Bennett King has taken it very sportingly. The results are there for everyone to see and the coach has been effusive in Lloyds praise. 

The legendary West Indian brings with him his vast experience 7515 runs and the knowledge of how to beat the best. 

A day after making the semi-finals, Lloyd appeared relaxed at the teams optional practice session. He, though, didnt wish to take any credit for the teams transformation. 

I dont think Ive done any wonders. I dont think Ive got any magic wand. Even without my presence the team reached the final during the Kuala Lumpur tri-series, Lloyd told The Telegraph. 

Despite defeating world champions Australia and hosts India convincingly in the tournament, he did not wish to pick the West Indies or any other side as the favourites. Its still wide open. I only hope we reach the final. Theres still a long way to go 

Ive told the boys not to be complacent and take each and every match seriously. Once the tournament enters the knockout phase, there will be no second chance, he explained. 

So what has brought back consistency to the team? The players performance and I dont wish to take any credit for this. They are a great bunch Ive had no problems adjusting with them. The fact that they are gelling together bodes well for the side, Lloyd remarked. 

Did he have to make any adjustment to his new role? Not at all Im enjoying my role. Its nice to be back in the manifold of West Indian cricket. Its not just that I have been talking cricket and harping on the past. Ive been helping them technically both on and off the field. Telling stories from the past is only part of the job. 

King also acknowledged Lloyds contribution. We encourage players interacting with him and spending as much time as possible. We want him to look at things and say how he feels. He has been great. 

He tells players stories from his playing days. He gives his ideas and is always around at nets. I encourage him to keep talking to players and keep teaching things from the past. It helps players to learn about history, the coach said. 

If only the BCCI could have got some of our greats involved with the side in such fashion!

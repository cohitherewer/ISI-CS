 Lineker divorce

London: Former England captain and TV presenter Gary Lineker was divorced from his wife on Tuesday after 20 years of married life. Michelle Cockayne was granted the divorce on the grounds of her husbands unreasonable behaviour. 

The former beauty therapist told the court he had caused her stress and anxiety. 

The couple married at St Mary Magdalenes Parish Church in Knighton, Leicestershire, in July 1986. They have four children. 

Lineker, whose playing career included time with FC Barcelona and Tottenham, scored 48 goals in 80 appearances for England. He now hosts a weekly soccer highlight programme in a TV channel.

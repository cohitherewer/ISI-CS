Manchester: Shahid Afridi gave Pakistan a fresh fitness scare after he was injured just 48 hours ahead of the second Test against England. 

While batting here on Tuesday at the Old Trafford nets, Afridi ? renowned for his hard-hitting and also a handy leg-spinner ? tried to pull a ball from a member of the Lancashire groundstaff. The ball hit him on the upper part of the bone of his right elbow. He then had ice treatment and strapping applied and didnt bowl in the nets. 

Afridi has a bruised elbow but he should be ok in the next two days. Its a hard ball game and such things often happen, said Bob Woolmer, Pakistans coach. Hes a tough Pathan and hell be okay. 

Afridi played in the drawn series opener at Lords, the first of a four-Test series. 

Woolmer has also ruled out fast bowler Shoaib Akhtars return to international cricket before the fourth Test against England. I do not think there are any chances of Shoaibs return to the side for the third Test mainly because there is so little time in between the second and third Tests, he was quoted in a newspaper, 

However, the tourists hope to have vice-captain Younis Khan in their side when the second Test starts at the Old Trafford on Thursday, the top-order batsman fit again after a knee injury although opener Shoaib Malik is still out with an elbow problem. 

Pakistans plight has led to suggestions that Mushtaq Ahmed, playing County cricket in England. But Woolmer indicated hed be sticking by his squad, already reinforced by the call-up of uncapped Samiullah Khan Niazi, batsman Taufeeq Umar and Rao Iftikhar Anjum, for the time being. 

 Plunkett ruled out 

Liam Plunkett added to Englands injury woes after he was on Tuesday ruled out of both the second and third Tests with a strain to the left side. 

Plunkett sustained the strain while playing for Durham against West Indies A after he being allowed to play in a bid to get some batting practice.

 Nothing is impossible: Sharath Kamal

 - World Championships 

 - TTFI announces squads 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Indian mens table tennis squad is not riding high after winning the gold medal in the Melbourne Commonwealth Games last month. 

With just five days remaining for the World Team Championship to begin in Bremen, Germany, the members of the Indian mens team are already feeling the heat. 

India is in the second division of the championship, which will feature the teams ranked between 24-36 in the world. Second division toppers would qualify for a berth in the elite division in the next edition. India is drawn in group H with US, Singapore, Bulgaria, Turkey and Finland. 

Commonwealth gold medallist Achanta Sharath Kamal will lead the challenge while Subhajit Saha, Soumyadeep Roy, G. Jitendra and Pratik Mehta are the other members. 

Top India paddler Sharath Kamal feels India have a good chance of making into the first division. For us nothing is impossible. We proved ourselves in the Commonwealth Games so why cant repeat it here? asked Sharath. 

For the womens team, it is going to be equally hard as they are already in the first division and are grouped with China, Romania, Belarus, Czech Republic and Serbia and Montenegro. It is the toughest draw we could have ever imagined. We are only hoping to put up a better show, said Mouma Das. 

Poulami Ghatak, Nandita Saha, Kasturi Chakraborty and Neha Aggarwal are the other members of the squad. 

All the selected paddlers are now currently in the national camp in Patiala and would be felicitated by the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) on Saturday for their good show in Melbourne. The contingent leaves on Sunday.

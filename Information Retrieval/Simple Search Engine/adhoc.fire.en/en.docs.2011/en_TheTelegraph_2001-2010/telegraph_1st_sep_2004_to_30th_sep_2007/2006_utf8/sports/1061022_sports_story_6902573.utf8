The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 10-minute blackout 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur. Lights going off at an international cricket match is rare, and ironically, it happened on Diwali day at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here. The Australia-England match was halted for ten minutes on account of power failure. 

The darkness sent the Rajasthan Cricket Association officials scurrying to every corner. Technical failure, was how one official described the let down at a critical stage of the match. 

The stoppage cost Australia dearly when as they lost Adam Gilchrist to the first ball after resumption.

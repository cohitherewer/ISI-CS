Cologne: France, missing birthday boy Zinedine Zidane, rose to the occasion and beat Togo 2-0 on Friday night to qualify as the No. 2 team from group G with five points. 

After a barren first session, Patrick Vieira scored in the 55th minute. Vieira then set up the second goal, heading the ball forward for Thierry Henry to slot it home in the 61st minute. 

Switzerland topped the group with seven points after beating South Korea 2-0 in Hanover. Philippe Senderos put the Swiss ahead after 23 minutes. Alex Frei scored a controversial second goal in the 77th minute. 

France will meet group H toppers Spain, while Switzerland will come up against Ukraine in the second round.

 Bradman bat fetches $58,000

Sydney: The first Test bat used by Australian cricket great Donald Bradman was sold for $58,000 at an auction here Sunday. 

Bradman used the bat on his Test debut in 1928 when he scored 18 and one against England at Brisbanes exhibition ground. 

England won the Test by 675 runs with Bradman dropped for the second match before returning for the third in Melbourne, where he scored his maiden century.

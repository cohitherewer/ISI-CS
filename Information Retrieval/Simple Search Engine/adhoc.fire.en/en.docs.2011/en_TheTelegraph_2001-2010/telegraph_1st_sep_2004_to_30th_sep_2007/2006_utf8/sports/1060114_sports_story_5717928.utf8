The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Berlin: The World Cup opening gala in Berlin has been cancelled, Fifa said on Friday, claiming the staging of the event could damage the playing surface needed at the Olympic Stadium five days later. However a German newspaper said it was called off because of rising costs and sluggish ticket sales. The gala, rather than an opening ceremony, was to be held for the first time ahead of the World Cup on June 7 in Berlin?s Olympic Stadium, two days before the finals starts.

 The gala, which was first planned by the German government, was taken over by Fifa. The world body said that it had decided to cancel the gala because of concerns about whether a new pitch needed to replace the grass trampled in the opening ceremony would be in satisfactory condition to play group matches just a few days later.

 London: Luton manager Mike Newell says bribes are common in English soccer transfers. Now he?s been asked to back up his claims. FA chief executive Brian Barwick said on Thursday that his staff would meet next week with Newell to discuss his allegations.

 Newell alleges that club officials and managers accept illegal payments, which agents offer as sweeteners to complete player transfers. The transfers can be lucrative to agents, who often receive part of the transfer money. Newell said he had turned down illegal pay-offs. Newell did not name any Premier League clubs or officials, but he said it was ?naive? to think top English teams were not involved. He also promised to name names.

 Cairo: Ghana ended any doubts over whether Chelsea?s Michael Essien would play at the African Nations Cup by leaving the injured midfielder out of their squad on Friday. Initially ruled out due to an ankle injury, Essien made an earlier than expected return to light training this week, prompting speculation he might yet play a part in Ghana?s campaign at the finals.

 But his name was absent from the 23-man list which Ghana belatedly provided for the finals being held in Egypt from January 20 to February 10. The Ghana Football Association are to be fined for missing Tuesday?s midnight deadline for the list, the CAF said on Friday.

 Tehran: Bayern Munich rallied to beat Persepolis Tehran 2-1 in a controversial friendly held in the Iranian capital on Friday thanks to first-half goals from Michael Ballack and Paulo Guerrero.

 While Bayern Munich said the match had nothing to do with politics, Iran?s sports chief said it was an important political statement that one of Europe?s biggest clubs came to Tehran when Iran was facing increasing international isolation over its nuclear programme.

 To underscore its political importance, a message in English was broadcast at the start of the match on a stadium TV screen that read: ?Peaceful use of nuclear energy is the natural claim of the Iranian nation.?

 Bayern captain Oliver Kahn, however, expressed a different view. ?This match is about sport and I separate that completely from politics.?

 Dakar: A young boy was killed in Guinea on Friday after being hit by a car competing in the 13th stage of the Dakar Rally. The boy, who had come to watch the rally pass just outside the Guinean village of Kourahoye, was hit as he crossed the road. This is the second casualty of this year?s rally after Aussie motorcyclist Andy Caldecott died in a crash on Monday.

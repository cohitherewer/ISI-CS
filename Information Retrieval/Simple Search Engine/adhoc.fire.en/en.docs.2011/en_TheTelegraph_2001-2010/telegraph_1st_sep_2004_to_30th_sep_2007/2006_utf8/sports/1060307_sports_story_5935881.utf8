 Sunny Sharp set to strike 

 SRIMAX

 Mysore: S. Rakesh-trained Sunny Sharp is well tuned-up to raise a winning gallop in the Thungabhadra Trophy, here on Tuesday. In his last start, the Cruachan-progeny was unlucky to have lost narrowly to Summer Storm after a ding-dong battle. The seven-year-old will be assisted by the Mumbai-jockey P.S. Chouhan and should be able to make it.

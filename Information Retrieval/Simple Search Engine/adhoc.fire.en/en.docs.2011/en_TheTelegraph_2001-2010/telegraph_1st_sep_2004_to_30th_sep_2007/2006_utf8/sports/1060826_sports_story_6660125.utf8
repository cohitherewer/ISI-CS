 Rahil Gangjee two strokes behind leaders

 - Brunei Open

Bandar Seri Begawan: Rahil Gangjee shot a steady even par 71 to stay in touch with the leaders at the midway stage of the $ 300,000 Brunei Open golf on the Asian Tour on Friday. Gangjee preserved his overnight seven-under and is now tied fifth and two behind co-leaders Michael Wright (66) and Lin Wen Tang (63). Filipino Juvic Pangsan (68) and Chen Tze-Chung (69) are tied third at eight-under 134, while Gangjee shares the fifth spot with three others, Ross Bain (68), Henry Perks (67) and David Gleeson (68). 

Four other Indians Arjun Singh and Harmeet Kahlon (tied 29th), Jyoti Randhawa (tied 43rd) and SSP Chowrasia (tied 56th) also made the cut, which came at one-under. 

The big comeback of the day from the Indian viewpoint was that of Jyoti Randhawa, who shot six birdies and one bogey over last eight holes and clawed himself back from five-over to two-under and in tied 43rd place. 

Singh, even par for the first day, went three-under on second and moved into tied 29th place with Kahlon, who had a disastrous back nine with five bogeys in last eight holes. Kahlon eight-under for the tournament after 10 holes in second round was then lying tied third before slipping down the ladder. Chowrasia added an even par 71 to his first round 70 and he is now one-under 141 for 36 holes and in tied 56 th place. 

The Indians missing the cut were Digvijay Singh (70-72) by one shot, Amandeep Johl (70-73) by two, Gurbaaz Mann (70-76), Amritinder Singh (75-74), Kanwar Sekhon (78-77) and Uttam Singh Mundy, who retired.

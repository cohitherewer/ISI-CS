The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Need to change forfeiture law 

 - Cant have repetition of Oval Test: Shah 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah on Thursday called for a move to strip the umpires of the power to forfeit a match. 

Pakistan were adjudged to have forfeited the final Test at The Oval following their refusal to take the field after tea on Day IV. Pakistan were protesting the umpires decision to penalise them five runs for ball tampering. 

Shah said: We cant have a repetition of The Oval Test. The International Cricket Council (ICC) must ensure that the game should not be stopped on such ground. 

The BCCI, however, will not make an immediate move to the games world governing body and, instead, wait to see what steps are taken at Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haqs disciplinary hearing, scheduled for late September. 

I strongly feel that the issue should be settled immediately. If needed, well discuss it at the BCCI and then approach the ICCs laws committee through a proper forum. But at present, we will keep an eye on what steps are being taken by the ICC before determining our next course of action, Shah maintained, when contacted on his cellphone. 

Incidentally, Sri Lanka Cricket has urged the ICC to initiate a discussion on the issue, but Shah, while welcoming the move, said that time hasnt yet come to make a joint move by the four Asian Test-playing nations in this regard. 

A team has to live with some good decisions and some bad ones. But no match should be stopped by a team on the pretext that this batsman or that batsman has been given out wrongly. You need to ensure that spectators and sponsors should not suffer, Shah pointed out. 

Criticising Match Referee Mike Procter for not preventing the game from being stopped, Shah said a match should not be stopped except for a riot or natural calamity or some other unforeseen circumstances, which are beyond the organisers control. 

Give more powers to the Match Referee or whatever, but this law should change 

Shah, however, refused to say if Hair deserved to be on ICCs Elite Panel of umpires. Ill not comment on this, but he (Hair) might have gone on the basis of what he considered legal, he remarked.

 Maradona dons role of 12th man

 Herzogenaurach: Argentina will have a twelfth 

 man in the dressing room again: Diego Maradona. 

 Argentinas legendary No. 10 was a cheerleader 

 in the opening 2-1 victory over Ivory Coast, and hes 

 promised to return for Fridays Group C game against 

 Serbia and Montenegro in Gelsenkirchen. 

He told us many of his anecdotes, and we were astonished watching him, defender Roberto Ayala said ahead of Wednesdays practice. 

 He makes me feel a lot of things, Ayala added. Imagine being with him before a game, in the dressing room, giving the pep-talk. You go on the field feeling different when you hear the words and get support from the best player in the world. 

Maradona made a surprise visit to Argentinas training camp earlier in the week, accompanied by his ex-wife Claudia and their daughter. 

 A white car, which frequently shows up at Argentina practices in northern Bavaria, spells out the kind of edge Maradona can give. 

Scribbled on the side is the message: The Pope is German. God is Argentine ? Diego X. 

A victory on Friday over Serbia and Montenegro ? coupled with a Dutch win over the Ivory Coast the same day ? would qualify Argentina for the second round. That would set up the showdown on June 21 in Frankfurt ? the Netherlands versus Argentina ? to decide the top place in the group. 

The two Group C qualifiers face the survivors from Group D ? likely to be Portugal and Mexico. 

It was a beautiful moment. I felt like a player again in the dressing room, Maradona said after his visit to the team hotel this week. It was great, and Im going to repeat it against Serbia and The Netherlands ? and lets hope I can repeat it in the final. 

Maradona brought Argentina their last World Cup title 20 years ago, and his last World Cup was 1994 in the United States. 

 With only four players returning 

 from the disappointing 2002 World Cup team, few are looking 

 far ahead. Argentina coach Jose Pekerman is expected to 

 start the same eleven that beat Ivory Coast, with Hernan 

 Crespo and Javier Saviola up front.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bengal scrape past Haryana 1-0

 - SANTOSH TROPHY 

 - Nandy doubtful for rest of meet 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Dipendu scored the winner 

Gurgaon: The All India Football Federation president Priyaranjan Dasmunshi, who came to the Devi Lal Sports Complex here to inaugurate the final rounds of the Santosh Trophy, left the venue at half time. The general secretary Alberto Colaco didnt turn up at all. 

They are wiser people indeed. The inaugural match between Bengal and Haryana, which the former won by a second-minute Dipendu Biswas goal, was an exhibition of insipid and aimless football. As the match wore on, it became increasingly difficult for the couple of thousand people present at the stands to concentrate on the proceedings. 

Even the die-hard fans of the host team never really expected Haryana to dish out top class football. But they were certainly surprised to see that the 29-time champions play even worse than the local side. Other than scoring the all-important goal early in the tie, Bengal did little of note. At the end, they looked lucky to troop out with three points. 

The induction of three national squad footballers in the team did no way improve the performance of Bengal. Rather, Bengals attacks turned blunter and the defence fumbled several times during the closing stages. Pressure became so much on Bengal defence that goalkeeper and skipper Sandip Nandy, while trying to thwart a couple of attackers, hurt his left shoulder and was replaced by Kalyan Chowbey in the 82nd minute. Nandy is now in doubt for the rest of the tournament. 

Bengal were lucky that they could pick up the goal early in the outing. Off a throw-in by Bijoy Basfore, midfielder Gouranga Dutta sent it for Dipendu, who turned and took a low right footer to beat Haryana goalkeeper Najvot. That was the last time one found Bengal do something constructive. For the rest of the 88 minutes, they were simply pathetic. 

In a later match, Punjab beat defending champions Goa 2-0 in the same group. Sukhjinder Singh and international Manjit Singh scored once in each half.

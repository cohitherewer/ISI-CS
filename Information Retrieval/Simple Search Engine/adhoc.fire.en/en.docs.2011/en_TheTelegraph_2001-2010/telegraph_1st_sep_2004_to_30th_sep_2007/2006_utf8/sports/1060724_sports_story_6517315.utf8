The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Second victory for Chandhok

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Indias Karun Chandhok scored his second victory in Round V of the Formula Renault V6 series at the Sentul race track in Indonesia on Sunday. 

According to information received here, Chandhok upset the expectant crowd by finishing the 15 lap race 1.3 seconds ahead of local hero Ananda Mikola with Bahraini driver Hammad Al Fardan finishing third. 

New Zealands Matt Halliday qualified on pole position with Chandhok in second after a closely fought qualifying session. After qualifying, Karun said: Matt, Ananda and I have been very evenly matched all weekend. We were trading fastest laps all through qualifying as well but, unfortunately, I ran wide on my final lap which meant that I lost a chance to out-qualify him. 

As the lights went green, Halliday and Chandhok sprinted side by side at over 250 kmph into turn 1. Halliday tried to outbrake Chandhok and ran wide, allowing the Indian to slip down the inside and into the lead. From there on, Chandhok worked hard to extend his lead. By lap eight he had extended his lead to over eight seconds before suffering from overheating front brakes. The 22-year-old had to back off the pace to ensure the car finished, allowing Mikola to close within 1.3 seconds by the end. 

In Round VI, Chandhok was gearing up for an end of race battle with Halliday, Mikola and Lin when, under the safety car, he lost hydraulic pressure and had to retire. 

Overall, the championship battle is now heating up. Al Fardan and Mikola are now tied on 56 points, with Karun on 53, Seth Ingham on 42 and Halliday on 36 points. The championship now moves to Zhuhai, China, for Rounds seven and eight.

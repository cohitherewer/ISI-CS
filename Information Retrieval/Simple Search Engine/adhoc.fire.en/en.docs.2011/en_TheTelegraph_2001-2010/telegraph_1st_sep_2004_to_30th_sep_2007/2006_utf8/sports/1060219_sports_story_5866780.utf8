 Kapur in 34th spot

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur put himself in a position to make a charge for a good finish as he opened with birdies on first two holes in the truncated third round, which will also be the final one, at the $1.25 million Maybank Malaysian Open golf tournament here on Saturday. 

At six-under after 39 holes, Kapur was lying 34th, but many players are yet to start their third round. 

Thailands Thammanoon Srirot edged into the lead as the tournament was reduced to a 54-hole tournament due to inclement weather. 

Gaurav Ghei was one under after three holes in third round and is now six-under and tied 34th. Amandeep Johl and Jyoti Randawa were even after three holes and four-under for the week. 

Jeev Milkha Singh (72-72), Rahil Gangjee (73-73) and Harmeet Kahlon (73-75) missed the cut, which came after two rounds. 

Defending champion Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand is very much in the hunt for a historic third straight victory in Malaysia as he is tied second with halfway leader David Park of Wales, who bogeyed the only hole he managed to play on Saturday. 

Englands Mark Foster was one of the few players ruing the suspension of play as he had charged out from the blocks with two birdies and one eagle through his opening five holes to trail in tied fourth place on 11-under, a score matched by compatriot John Bickerton.

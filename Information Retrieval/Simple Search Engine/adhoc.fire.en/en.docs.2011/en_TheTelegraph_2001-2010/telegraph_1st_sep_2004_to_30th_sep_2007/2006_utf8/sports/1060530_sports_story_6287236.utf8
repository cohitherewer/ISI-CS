The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bhutia acted against teams interest, says Nayeem

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A day after Bob Houghton was confirmed as the new India coach, his predecessor Syed Nayeemudin came out in the open with sensational allegations against star striker Bhaichung Bhutia on Monday. 

The ousted coach said that Bhaichung, who was the captain, acted against the teams interest, which resulted in the dismal performance against Japan and Yemen in the AFC Asian Cup. 

Indian lost 0-6 to Japan and Yemen inflicted a 3-0 defeat on home turf, earlier this year. 

He (Bhaichung) used to hold regular classes with the players before the Japan and the Yemen matches. Even goalkeeper coach Atanu Bhattacharya was not allowed to enter the room. 

The results of the matches showed what transpired during the meeting between the captain and the players. I was kept in dark about all these things. When I came to know about this I complained to the manager, but no step was taken, Nayeem remarked. 

The former coach also said that Bhaichung didnt practice regularly and other players followed his footsteps and didnt give their 100 per cent. Nayeem demanded that the All India Football Federation (AIFF) should conduct an inquiry into the happenings. 

Nayeem also slammed the AIFF for their indifferent treatment towards Indian coaches. 

See the foreign coaches are paid such a huge amount and are also given time to build a team that would fetch good results. If we would have been provided with all these things we could have also produced better results, he said. 

Nayeem pointed out that before the Japan and the Yemen matches he requested the AIFF to conduct some exposure trips for the team in South Korea and China. Priya Ranjan Das Munshi was willing to give the nod but it was turned down by the federation for financial reasons. 

Meanwhile, former Olympian and football captain Chuni Goswami came out in support of Nayeem, saying that he was given a raw deal. 

I along with P.K. Banerjee selected Nayeem as the coach and he did well by wining the SAFF Cup. But the results of the Japan and the Yemen matches didnt go in his favour. 

But you cant blame him for everything since seven to eight regular players were out with injury, said Goswami.

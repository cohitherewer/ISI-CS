The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswajit quits

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: There was more drama in the Mohun Bagan dressing-room than on the field on Saturday. 

A few hours after the Calcutta giants were taken apart in the first Durand Cup semi-final by Dempo, coach Biswajit Bhattacharya submitted his resignation to the team manager. 

I have been a target of criticism for quite sometime now, the former India captain in the dressing room after the 0-2 defeat. 

May be, I am not good enough for this job, he said. I could not win the Calcutta league for Mohun Bagan though we were successful in beating East Bengal on both occasions. I thought we could perform better in the Durand Cup. Now that we have lost in Delhi too, it is better I leave the post for someone else. 

Bhattacharya, speaking inside the dressing-room in the presence of players and club officials, said he did not wish to cling on to the chair. 

His announcement sent shockwaves through the Mohun Bagan camp. While the players, including skipper Jose Ramirez Barreto, refused to comment on the issue and walked off in a huff, the officials tried to put up a brave front. 

Mohun Bagan secretary Anjan Mitra claimed he hadnt read the resignation letter and added that he would talk to the coach before making any statement. 

We lost a crucial match today (Saturday) and everyone is upset, Mitra said. I am not sure what exactly the coach has stated in his letter. Well look into the matter on Sunday.

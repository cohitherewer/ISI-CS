The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lasting Love may rule on last day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Daniel David and his stable-jockey, Imran Chisty, are sitting pretty at the top of their respective championship tables. Yet the duo may try to increase their tally on Wednesday, the concluding meet of the season.

 Daniel Davids Lasting Love stands out in the feature event, the 1,200m Defence Forces Cup. The Rebounding Thrill filly was outsmarted by Wonnabee over a wet track. She had also suffered a humilating deafeat at the hands of super-filly Amorina in the Fillies Trial Stakes. She takes on her nine rivals in handicap race and at favourable terms.

 Owner D. Khaitan, too, has three good horses lined up in the seven-event card. His Silver Print, Tactical Advantage and Olmpic Medal could be potential winners on the day.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

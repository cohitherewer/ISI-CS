 Iaquinta ready to be a reserve

Duisburg: Italy striker Vincenzo Iaquinta said on Thursday he was prepared to settle for a place on the bench against the United States despite scoring in the Azzurris 2-0 Group E win against Ghana. 

In the build-up games and training sessions, the tall Udinese forward has looked the sharpest of all Marcello Lippis strikers, but started on the bench against the West Africans before coming on in the 64th minute for Alberto Gilardino. 

Iaquinta scored seven minutes from the end of the game but says he has had no indication whether he will start against the Americans. 

I dont know. When I was called upon I showed I was ready but of course all 23 of us have to feel ready, he said. 

I am in good shape and enjoying a very positive period. Everyone wants to play but the coach has to make his choices, added Iaquinta.

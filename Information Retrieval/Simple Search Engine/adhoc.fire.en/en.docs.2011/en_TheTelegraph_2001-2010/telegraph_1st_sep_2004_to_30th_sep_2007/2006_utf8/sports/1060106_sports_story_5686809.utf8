The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Entries rejected 

A CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta: Chess players are once again at the receiving end of the squabble amongst chess organisers of the country. The officials of the All India Chess Federation (AICF) rejected the entry of two Rajasthan players in the national under-13 boys and girls championships, which got underway at Howrah from Thursday. 

The players ? Akshat Agarwal and Prayank Sadayet ? were in tears while their parents tried frantically to convince the AICF and WBCA officials to accept their entries. However, they were rejected despite the fact that their entries were accepted as donor entries and receipts were issued. 

A few more players from Kerala and Chhattisgarh are also facing the same problem. 

The AICF had disaffiliated seven associations ? those of Rajasthan, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Correspondence Chess Association of India. 

The AICF formed a selection committee in these states to pick players for the nationals. The federation refused to allow the list of players sent by the associations of the states of Rajasthan, Kerala and Chhattisgarh. 

The observer for the nationals, Mr Bharat Singh, who is treasurer of AICF, said: We received two lists and since we had disaffiliated Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) we could not accept the entries sent by the unit. They could have contacted the selection committee and come through them. 

The secretary of RCA, Mr S.L. Harsh, plans to move court against the AICF. 

CPAI president Dibyenbu Barua said the players should have contacted us. Though they are not CPAI members, we could have fought for them.

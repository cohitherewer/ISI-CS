Calcutta: Winning is a habit, and once you get into it, it starts making great things happen around you. An air of confidence and conviction ? qualities which accompany such a habit ? is currently sweeping across the Mohammedan Sporting camp, and Saturdays National Football League (NFL) match against JCT was no exception. 

Bijen Singh and Mohammed Muktar scored on either side of the break to help Mohammedan Sporting emerge as the provisional leaders with 10 points from five matches. Parveen Kumar pulled one back for JCT (five points from as many outings) by converting a penalty kick, but the strike came too late to stop the hosts from returning with full points. 

Its remarkable in that the black-and-white side had debuted in the NFL two seasons back, only to suffer relegation, and their comeback show ? under Mohammed Habib, who is also on a comeback trail ? makes it something the fans have not been used to in recent past. 

 Teams 

Mohammedan Sporting: Gopal Das, Palash Karmakar, Madhusudan Majumdar, David Mkandwire, Madhab Das, Bijoy Basfore, Satyajit Bose, Anit Ghosh (Suman Dutta, 63), Mohammed Muktar, Bijen Singh, Patrick Okonji. 

JCT: Kalyan Chowbey, Daljit Singh, Narinder Singh, Julius Akpele, Harish Sharma, Sukhjinder Singh (Baldeep Singh, 58), Sukhwinder Singh, Marcos Perreira, Rennedy Singh, Parveen Kumar (Sunil Chhetri, 77), Johnson Banner. 

Referee: P. Bhaskar (Tamil Nadu). 

Sporting prevail 

Sporting Clube De Goa edged past Salgaocar by a Rajesh Meetei goal in the second minute to move to the second spot in Margao. The goal came from a free kick.

 Heroines Fantasy fancied 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Chisty

Mysore: S. Rakesh-trained Heroines Fantasy, who had finished a good third to Haimiwaltz last time out, looks well prepared to win the Karnataka Racehorse Owners Association Cup here on Wednesday. The three-year-old filly may have a fight on hand from her stablemate, Winning Attitude, but the 5.5kg handicap advantage she has over her rival may stand her in good stead in the hands of jockey Imran Chisty.

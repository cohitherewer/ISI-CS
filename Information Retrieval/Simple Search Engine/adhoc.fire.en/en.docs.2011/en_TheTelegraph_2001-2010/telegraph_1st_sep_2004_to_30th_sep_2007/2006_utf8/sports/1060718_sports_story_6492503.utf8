 Aussies hungry for revenge

 Ponting

London: Embarrassed by the Ashes defeat last year, Australian captain Ricky Ponting has vowed to clinch back the famous urn from England when they meet in November later this year. 

Ponting-led Australia lost the Ashes (1-2) for the first time in 18 years last summer and Ponting said his players would go all out to avenge their shameful defeat. 

Its a huge series for the team ? to be the first one to hand over the Ashes in 18 years was something the players were embarrassed and ashamed about, Ponting said. 

England will face a better Australian team than they did last time, he was quoted as saying by a news channel on Monday. 

Weve worked really hard on our games and performances ? everything is heading in the right direction and everything isnt smooth sailing for England, he said referring to the injury-ravaged English team. 

Im confident well play well, weve brought our games on a long way since the end of the Ashes. 

Meanwhile, England spinner Ashley Giles has set his sights on the Ashes after undergoing a second bout of hip surgery. 

The 33-year-old was forced to return home from the winter 2005 tour of Pakistan. 

Well find out more in a weeks time when I come off the crutches, but the early indications are that theyve taken away the things that were causing the discomfort, Giles told a newspaper. 

The Ashes are my goal, partly because theyre a target to keep me going and partly because I believe that I can get myself fit and bowling again before then. (Agencies)

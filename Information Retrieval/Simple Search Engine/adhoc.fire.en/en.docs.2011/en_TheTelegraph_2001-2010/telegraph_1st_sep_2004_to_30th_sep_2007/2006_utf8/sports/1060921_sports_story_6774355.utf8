Calcutta: Just on the eve of the match, Subhas Bhowmick had warned his wards of the Bhaichung Bhutia factor. On Wednesday, his prophecy came true as it was the India captain who made the difference between Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting in his own inimitable style. 

While Mohun Bagans 1-0 victory gave them a chance to stay afloat in the title-race with current leaders East Bengal, Mohammedan Sportings hopes are now as good as over. 

The Sahara CFL Premier Division match played under lights at the Salt Lake Stadium was a mere eight-minute-old when Dharamjit Singh started his run down the left flank, taking on Mohammedan Sporting side-back Rajib Ahmed. He then outsprinted the challenger, and before the charging Douglas da Silva could face up to him, the Mohun Bagan winger laid it off for Bhaichung. 

Ever-alert and ever-agile as he is, Bhaichung shielded his marker Habibur Rahman Mondal well and before the crowd present at the Mohammedan Sporting box at that time could anticipate anything extraordinary out of the ordinary, a first-time contact was made between the ball and the strikers left-foot and within the blink of an eye, goalkeeper Gopal Das realised the nets behind him had been disturbed. 

Following the 25-yard free-kick goal against Calcutta Port Trust, Bhaichung produced another gem which eventually sealed the fate for Bhowmicks side, true to the latters apprehension. 

In the dying minutes of the match, Dharamjit who provided the ball leading to Bhaichungs goal received the marching orders, for unnecessarily elbowing Bijen Singh in an off-the-ball incident. He is going to miss the derby clash versus East Bengal on Tuesday. But by that time, Bhaichungs excellent finishing had confirmed victory for the defending champions. 

Mohun Bagan are now on 17 points after nine matches while Mohammedan Sporting who briefly topped the leaderboard in the initial phase of the competition are still stuck with 16, after 10 matches. Carlos Roberto Pereiras East Bengal are leading the pack with 19 from 8 outings. 

The match was kicked off 16 minutes after scheduled time as a sudden spell of heavy showers left pools of water at various parts of the ground. Both teams initially refused to play citing unplayable conditions. But once the action began, it was Mohun Bagan all the way in the first half-an-hour. 

Dharamjit and Man-of-the-Match Lalkamal Bhowmick kept Mohun Bagans wing-play active and thanks to the duos tireless efforts, Mohun Bagan made a number of forays at that time. After the goal, Bhaichung was severely marked, but Dipendu Biswas and Ndem Guy Herve failed to capitalise on crosses from the flank. Mohammedan Sporting defender A. Firoz also effected a goalline save off an Eduardo Coelho header. 

In comparison, Mohammedan Sportings chances were limited. If Bijen Singhs acrobatic effort was praiseworthy, K. Kulothungans wasting of the chance a little away from the six-yard box was simply unpardonable. 

The degeneration of Douglas from a winner to an onlooker is pathetic. Bhowmick should have relieved him of his duty much earlier than calling for his 60th-minute substitution through Raman Vijayan. 

Jamir Ali Mondals introduction after eight minutes helped Mohammedan Sporting dictate the terms of the match momentarily, but their attack lacked precision and power, with Mike Okoro stranded alone without ball. 

When Mohammedan Sporting threw their weight around the rivals box for the equaliser, Mohun Bagan came across a couple of chances towards the end. On both occasions, goalkeeper Gopal stood tall, denying Ayan Chowdhury and Ndem.

Calcutta: Anirban Lahiri who was part of the Asian Games silver medal-winning team continued to hog the limelight at the Goodricke East India Amateur Golf Championship. An opening round six-under 66 at the par-72 RCGC course on Tuesday put him top of the heap. 

The trio of Saurabh Bahuguna, Tarun Ghogale and Sanjeev Mehra was in second place, six shots behind Lahiri, after bringing in even-par cards of 72 each. A 95-strong field teed off Tuesday morning in what is the eighth leg of Royal Challenge National Amateur Circuit. 

Starting off with back-to-back birdies, Lahiri followed it up with two more on the fourth and ninth holes on his outward-journey. On the way back, he got a brilliant eagle on the 15th and, with three successive pars thereafter, returned a card of 66. 

Bahugunas round started with a bogey but the golfer recovered with birdies on the fourth, sixth and eighth. On his back nine, he dropped shots on the 11th and 14th. Mehras round included two birdies, coming on the fourth and 15th and as many bogeys on the third and eighth. Ghogale birdied the fourth, 11th and 16th but dropped shots on the seventh, ninth and tenth.

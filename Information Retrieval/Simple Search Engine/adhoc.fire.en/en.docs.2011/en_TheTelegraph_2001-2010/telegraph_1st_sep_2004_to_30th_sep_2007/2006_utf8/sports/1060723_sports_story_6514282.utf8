 Atwal, Chopra move ahead

New York: Daniel Chopra and Arjun Atwal both made the cut as they carded one-under 71 and even par 72, respectively in the second round of the $3 million BC Open at the Atunyote Golf Course.Chopra was tied 27th while Atwal was at tied 39th. 

The lead was shared by three players ? Gabriel Hjertstedt (67), Scott Gump (67) and Daisuke Maruyama (67), who shot 67 each on both days and are at 10-under for two rounds. 

Hjertstedt won the title nine years ago and he could well repeat it this year. Chopra had birdies on the first, third and 12th and bogeys on the 11th and 18th holes while Atwal had birdies on the ninth and tenth and bogeys on fourth and 16th but once again faced problems with his putting and needed 33 of them. Chopra too needed 30 putts. 

One shot back of the leading trio was local David Branshaw (64). Trailing by another stroke at 136 were Esteban Toledo (67), Mathias Gronberg (68), Cameron Beckman (66), Michael Bradley (68), and Frank Lickliter II (67). (PTI)

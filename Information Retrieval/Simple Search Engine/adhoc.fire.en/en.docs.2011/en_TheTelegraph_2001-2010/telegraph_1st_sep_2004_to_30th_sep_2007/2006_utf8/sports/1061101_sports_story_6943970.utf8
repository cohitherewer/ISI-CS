 Chris Gayles formula for success

 - Nature of pitches doing rounds in WI, SA camps 

Jaipur: In-form West Indies opener Chris Gayle said Tuesday that the key to his good performance in the Champions Trophy was quick adjustment to Indian pitches. 

The 27-year-old Jamaican is second among top run-getters (302) in the tournament with two centuries, including one in the West Indies last league match against England in Motera. 

The wickets are playing much slower and lower than when I was here last (in 2002). The key has been to assess the wicket as quickly as possible, said the dashing batsman ahead of Thursdays semi-final against South Africa. 

I have made some adjustments out in the middle, and it is working for me, Gayle said. 

Gayles success at the top of the order is all the more creditable considering that most other teams have struggled to get off to good starts in the tournament. 

There is a lot of difference in my batting now. I am just trying to play straight. When I get a start, I try to capitalise on it and not give it away. (PTI)

 Landis tests positive 

 - If its something worse than medication, he doesnt deserve to win, says mother 

 Landis 

London: Four days after standing atop the winners podium on the Champs-Elysees, Floyd Landis stunning Tour de France victory was thrown into question on Thursday by a positive doping test. 

The Swiss-based Phonak team suspended the American, pending results of the backup B sample. Phonak said it was notified by the UCI (world cycling body) on Wednesday of an unusual level of male sex hormone testosterone/epitestosterone ratio in the test made on Floyd Landis after stage 17 of the Tour de France. 

The team management and the rider were both totally surprised of this result, the Phonak statement said. Efforts to reach Landis proved unsuccessful. 

Meanwhile, Tour de France organisers said on Thursday they would be angry and sad if it was confirmed that Landis had tested positive for testosterone. If the counter-analysis (B sample) confirmed the first result, anger and sadness would be the dominant feelings for all those who had been thrilled by the 2006 Tour de France, race organisers said in a statement. 

Now more than ever the organisers will maintain the firm attitude they have displayed since the start from Strasbourg. 

The 30-year-old Landis made a remarkable comeback in that Alpine stage, racing far ahead of the field for a solo win that moved him from 11th to third in the overall standings. He regained the leaders yellow jersey two days later. Landis rode the Tour with a degenerative hip condition that he has said will require surgery in the coming weeks or months. 

Arlene, his mother, said on Thursday that she wouldnt blame her son if he was taking medication to treat the pain in his injured hip, but if its something worse than that, then he doesnt deserve to win. 

I didnt talk to him since that hit the fan, but Im keeping things even keel until I know what the facts are, she said via phone from her home in Farmersville, Pennsylvania. 

I know that this is a temptation to every rider but Im not going to jump to conclusions ... It disappoints me. 

The Phonak statement came a day after the UCI, cyclings world governing body, said an unidentified rider had failed a drug test during the Tour. 

Phonak said Landis would ask for an analysis of his backup sample to prove either that this result is coming from a natural process or that this is resulting from a mistake. 

USA Cycling spokesman Andy Lee said that organisation could not comment on Landis. Because its an anti-doping matter, its USA Cyclings policy not to comment on that subject out of respect for the process and Floyds rights, Lee said. Right now, we have to let the process proceed and we cant comment on it. 

Carla Connell, publications and communications director for the US Anti-Doping Agency, said: Ill make this very brief: No comment. 

World Anti-Doping Agency chief Dick Pound, speaking before Landis was confirmed as the rider with the positive test, said it was amazing that any cyclist would risk doping after the scandals that rocked the Tour before the start. 

Despite all the fuss prior to the race with all these riders identified and withdrawn, you still have people in that race quite willing and prepared to cheat, he said via phone from Montreal. Thats a problem for cycling. 

 UCI spokesman Enrico Carpani said 

 Landis was notified of the test on Wednesday morning. He 

 said the cycling body doesnt require analysis of the 

 B sample, but that Landis requested it.

 Indias medal hopes

 Manavjit Singh 

The following are Indias top medal hopes in Doha: 

 Archery 

Mens team competition: The India mens team, comprising Jayanta Talukdar, MS Champia, Tarundeep Rai and Vishwash, could win a medal as all of them, especially Talukdar and Champia, are in good form. Archery will have a very strong field in the Asian Games with worlds best archers from South Korea and Japan. In the recent past, Talukdar has done well in international meets. The first Indian to win a gold medal at the FITA Meteksan Archery World Cup in Porec, Talukdar is currently ranked second behind Italys Ilario di Buo in the world in the individual recurve event. 

 Athletics 

Anju Bobby George: A bronze medallist in the World Championships in 2003, the long jumper from Kerala is once again expected to reap gold for India in the Asian Games. This time, however, may be tougher as she might face a challenge from Japanese girl Komiko, who recently jumped 6.86 in a domestic meet. Anju, who has been in somewhat poor form this season, did her best (6.54) in the Commonwealth Games. 

Anju bests: 6.83m. Asian Games record Yao Weilli , China (6.91) Hiroshima. 

The 4x400m women relay team: This event is a traditional stronghold for the Indians at the Asian Games and this time, too, it doesnt look like it will be any different. The team comprises Pinki Paramanik, Manjit Kaur, Chitra Soman and Satti Geetha. The advantage for India is that even the Chinese and Koreans do not have more than two good relay runners. In the Asian Championship in South Korea, the Indian quartet clocked 3:30.93, which was the best by an Asian team this season. 

India s recent best 3:30.93 (Asian meet, South Korea ). Asian Games record China (3.29.11), Hiroshima. 

 Billiards 

Pankaj Advani and Ashok Shandilya: One of them is likely to win the billiards singles gold in the Asian Games. While Advani is the reigning world champion, Shandilya won double gold for India at the 1998 Asian Games. In Bangkok, Shandilya partnered Geet Sethi to win the doubles gold. The duo is expected to repeat the show this time, too. The billiards event this time could be a tough battle for the Indians as former world champion Peter Gilchrist will be playing for Singapore, where he has been living for some years now. 

 Chess 

K. Sasikiran: The battle for gold in chess at the Asian Games this time could well prove to be an Indo-China conflict. India have a strong team in K. Sasikiran (world No 31), P. Harikirshna (World No 32) and K. Humpy. China, too, have a strong side. Their two GMs Wang Yue and Bu Xiangzhi did well in the Olympiad and would pull out all stops against Asian champions India. Sasi is top seeded and is favourite to bag the title. 

 Hockey 

The axing of Viren Rsquinha notwithstanding, Indian hockey team can expect to finish on the top. India are placed in a relatively easy group in Doha . Clubbed with South Korea , China , Oman and Bangladesh , India should enjoy an easy passage to the semi-finals. China , however, may pose some problems as they are coached by Kim Sang Ryul, who trained South Korea to fame in the 90s. Even if India finish second in their pool behind South Korea , they will probably play Pakistan in the semi-finals as the team from across the border should head the other pool ahead of Malaysia . 

 Kabaddi 

This is one gold India are certain to retain in Doha . Kabaddi was introduced in the Asian Games during the Beijing Asian Games in 1990 and since then India have never lost the gold. Nepal , Bangladesh and Pakistan are the ones to watch out for. 

 Shooting 

Manavjit Singh: At the last Asian Games in Busan, Manavjit Singh finished fifth. But in Doha, he is one of India s biggest medal hopes. Currently ranked No 1 in the world in trap shooting, the Delhi boy has improved rapidly and recently won gold in the World Championships in Zagreb. In the World Cups and championships, Manavjit, who trains in Italy, generally faces stiff challenge from his European rivals. Yet, in the Asian Games, he has to be careful as there could be a challenge from the Chinese shooters. India s Mansher Singh may also pose a threat to Manavjit. 

Manavjits best: 143 ( Zagreb , 2006) 

Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore: Silver medallist at the Athens Olympics, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore will be one of the hot favourites for the double trap title. The event has a strong field in the Asian Games and Rathore will be up against world No 2 Binyuan Hu and shooters from Kuwait. Rathore, won gold in the Commonwealth Games and bronze in the World Cup in Spain last month, is in fine nick and could add one more feather to his cap in Doha. AT Busan, Rathore finished a disappointing 12th. 

Rathores best: 144 ( Granada , 2006). 

Gagan Narang: In the absence of Abhinav Bindra, who is nursing an injury, Hyderabads Gagan Narang will be Indias best bet to win a gold in 10m rifle. He shot into fame immediately after the Commonwealth Games when he bagged the gold in the World Cup in China with a career-best 700.2 points. 

Narangs best: 700.2 (China, 2006).

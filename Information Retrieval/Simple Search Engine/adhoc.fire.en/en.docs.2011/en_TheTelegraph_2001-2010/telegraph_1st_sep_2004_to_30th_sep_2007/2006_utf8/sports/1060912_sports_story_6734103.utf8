 Gatlin hearing may not be this year: Lawyer

Raleigh: Justin Gatlins lawyer said on Monday that she did not expect the Olympic champions arbitration hearing on doping charges to be held this year. 

I dont think so, Cameron Myler said in a telephone interview from her New York office. 

One of the benefits that we get from the (August) stipulation with Usada (the US Anti-Doping Agency) is more time to collect evidence to support our defences, she added. 

So I think the time frame (for the hearing) will be a little longer than you usually see. 

Gatlin, who shares the 100m world record with Jamaican Asafa Powell, tested positive for the male sex hormone testosterone and its precursors at a Kansas relay meeting in April. 

Usada announced last month that the 24-year-old American had accepted the accuracy of the laboratory results from the test and agreed his positive test constituted a doping violation. 

An arbitration hearing will determine what ban, if any, Gatlin faces. 

The maximum suspension would be eight years, Usada has agreed. 

Gatlin could have faced a lifetime ban under anti-doping rules for second offences. 

Gatlins lawyers are hoping an arbitration panel will either clear him or provide a much shorter suspension. 

He has denied knowingly using any banned substance and predicted in an August statement that he would be cleared and allowed to compete again. (REUTERS)

Faridabad: For the Doubting Thomases, Bengal sent a clear message at the Sector 12 Stadium here on Monday. The 29-time champions may not have come with their best team in the Santosh Trophy here, but are still good enough to take care of a team like Madhya Pradesh much more easily that one could have thought. 

Having taken the field with the possible threat of a draw and an early exit from the tournament, Bengal displayed great confidence in routing Madhya Pradesh 5-0, that, too, after wasting two penalty kicks in the last three minutes. At the breather, Bengal led 4-0. 

Bengal are now leading the three-team Cluster III and await the winners of Services versus Assam match in Cluster IV for a spot in the quarter finals on Thursday. 

Madhya Pradesh, who mostly have players from the CRPF, had a plan to hold Bengal for as long as possible and try to gain a point. They posted more players in their own half from the very start and went for off-side traps. 

Nothing worked as Bengal hammered in two goals within 11 minutes. The first goal from Avinash Thapa was a beauty. On Sunday, Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee had said that he would field Thapa as the boy from Port Trust has a terrific left. Thapa took only nine minutes to prove his coach right. 

As defender Bijoy Basfore switched the ball from the right to the left, Tarif Ahmed chested the ball down on the left corner of the box. Thapa, who rushed in, took a stunning angular volley that had Madhya Pradesh goalkeeper SD Shyam stranded. 

Thereafter, like in the match against Rajasthan, it turned out to be a Vimal Pariyar show. The Tata Football Academy trained striker, who scored four against Rajasthan, found the net three more times on Monday to emerge the leading scorer of the tournament. The one he headed in the 34th minute off a cross from Thapa was the best. It was perfectly timed and a powerful one. Lalhmangaih Zuala got the other goal. 

One is not sure whether the same display would be able to take them through in the tougher battle against Services or Assam, but Bengal left their fans bit disappointed by two spot kicks. The first one by Pariyar went in rightly but was cancelled by referee A. Arjunan as a Bengal striker had entered the box before the shot was taken. Pariyar hit the next one straight to the goalkeeper. 

In Cluster I in Gurgaon, Haryana made the next round on better goal difference after being held to a goalless draw by Bihar.

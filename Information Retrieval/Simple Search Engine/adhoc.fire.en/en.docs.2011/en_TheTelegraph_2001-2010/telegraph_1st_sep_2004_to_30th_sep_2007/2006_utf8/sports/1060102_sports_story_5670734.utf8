 Azhar: Itll be a close contest

Lucknow: The forthcoming India-Pakistan series would be a cracker of a contest since both the teams are in top form, according to former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin. 

Both sides are looking very strong. Pakistan are a good side and they showed their strength in the recently concluded series against England while the Indian team performed well to register wins over Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, Azharuddin, who was here to play in the veterans one-day match, said. 

India have some experienced cricketers who would play a vital role in the Test series. They were the architects of Indias victories in the recent series at home, he said. 

India will take on Pakistan in a three-Test and five-match one-day series starting next week. He also said a team should have the right mix of youth and experience, adding too much chopping and changing should not be done unnecessarily. 

On Greg Chappell, Azhar said the Australian was doing a good job.

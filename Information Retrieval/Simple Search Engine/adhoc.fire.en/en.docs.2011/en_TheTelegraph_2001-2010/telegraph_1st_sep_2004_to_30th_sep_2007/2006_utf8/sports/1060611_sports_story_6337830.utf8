 Justine tops

 - Belgian keeps title without dropping a set 

 Justine Henin-Hardenne after her victory at Roland Garros on Saturday 

Paris: Defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne of Belgium won the French Open for the third time here on Saturday defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia in straight sets. 

Fifth seed Henin-Hardenne, the 2003 and 2005 Roland Garros champion, achieved her fifth Grand Slam and 26th title of her career with a 6-4, 6-4 victory in 1hr 36min over the eighth seed. 

The 24-year-old becomes the eighth woman to win the Roland Garros title at least three times and first to win back-to-back titles since Steffi Graf a decade ago. 

The first is special, three is a lot, said Henin-Hardenne, who won her first major here. 

I feel really happy to join the likes of Monica Seles and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. What I experience at Roland Garros is like nowhere else, she said before being presented with her trophy by tennis legend Martina Navratilova.The Belgian came out of the blocks flying in the sweltering heat of the Philippe Chatrier Court, breaking the Russians opening service game. 

She rushed to a 4-1 lead with two breaks before the first cracks appeared when a double fault in the sixth game handed Kuznetsova a break back and a lifeline which the 2004 US Open champion quickly seized. 

Kuznetsova held serve for 3-4 but despite fighting back from 0-40 down in the eighth game, she failed to convert a break point to level proceedings. The 20-year-old from St Petersburg nevertheless did not let Henin-Hardenne have it all her own way, holding serve to love for 4-5, but the Belgian served out the set after 50 minutes on court. 

Faced with a wilting Henin-Hardenne the Russian squandered a 2-0 lead in the second set, allowing the Belgian to level proceedings. 

The champion also staved off a break point on her serve in the sixth game as Kuznetsova hit wide. 

From that point Henin-Hardenne never looked in danger of losing as she cruised to the title and the 940,000 euro top prize on her second match point.

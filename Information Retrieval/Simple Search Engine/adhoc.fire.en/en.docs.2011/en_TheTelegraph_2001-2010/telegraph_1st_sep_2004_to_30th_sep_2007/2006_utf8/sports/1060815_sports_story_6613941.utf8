On Sunday, the newly-formed Football Players Association of India (FPAI) pledged to help ailing former India captain Sudip Chatterjee. Ironically, Chatterjee, a great player of the 80s, was largely responsible for Indias defeat against Saudi Arabia in the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi. 

A minute away from the final whistle, substitute Chatterjees faulty header saw a Saudi striker grabbing the ball and hitting the Indian net that broke a thousand hearts at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium that night. 

The next year, India met the Saudis twice in the Olympic qualifiers and lost on both occasions, though the present Mohun Bagan coach Bishwajit Bhattacharya struck a spectacular goal in Delhi. 

Much water has flown through the river since then. While the Saudis have achieved great heights and have qualified for the World Cup finals four times, Indias dwindling fortunes at the international level have reduced them to a lower-ranked side in the Asian circuit. 

On Wednesday, India should be lucky to avoid losing by a big margin, though a wet turf at the Salt Lake Stadium may come to their rescue. 

Bob Houghton is likely to field a 4-4-2 formation. While Surkumar Singh, NP Pradeep, Deepak Mondal and NS Manju are supposed to man the defence, Rennedy Singh, Venkatesh, Steven Dias and Mehrajuddin are the likely choices in midfield. 

Skipper Bhaichung may start with Manjit Singh up-front. Saudi Arabias Brazilian coach Marcos Paqueta may once again go for his favourite 4-4-2, which he followed religiously during the Germany World Cup except in the match against Spain. 

With more than a dozen World Cuppers in their ranks, Saudis, who are both physically and technically ahead of India, are expected to go for the jugular from the beginning. 

 The key players for India are: 

 Bhaichung Bhutia: The Indian captain has been shouldering the lions share of responsibilities since 1995 and is expected to deliver the goods again. Under Houghtons scheme of things, in which he expects his boys to take the battle to the other half, Bhaichung holds a key position. A fine ball player of good speed and a surprisingly good tackler, Bhutia is perhaps the only one in this team with the physical fitness to match the Saudis. He has to be a little more alert, though, in the rival penalty box. 

 S. Venkatesh: Unassuming but highly effective, the Bangalore boy has been serving the Indian team since he was a teenager in the late 90s.One of Indias most consistent performers, he was one of the players to have taken part in the historic match when India defeated the United Arab Emirates in the World Cup qualifiers in 2001. Venkatesh not only possesses accurate long rangers, but has an effective run down the middle. After Bhaichung, he is the most experienced footballer in the squad. 

 N.S. Manju: This Bangalore defender, who plays for Mahindra United, came into prominence in September 2005 when incumbent coach Sukhwinder Singh decided to field him in the absence of Deepak Mondal. The slightly built footballer turned out to be a revelation. He is not only a good tackler, but adds to attack at times. Temperament is Manjus biggest plus point as he is not averse to playing his natural game against much superior opponents. In the under-23 squad for the Asian Games, Manju is likely to play a big role for India. 

Now, a glance at the visitors. Three of their key players are: 

 Mohammed Massad: One of the youngest members of the squad, 22-year-old Massad has impressed coach Marcos Paqueta with his versatility. Mainly a midfielder, Massad can operate as a defensive right screen and has even played at centre-back and left-back. This ability to operate from a number of positions makes him a great asset. Massad belongs to a footballing family older brother Khaled played in the Saudi Arabia team that reached the second round of the World Cup in 1994. Massad is regarded as one of the most promising players in Asian football. 

 Hussain Sulaimani: A veteran left-back, 29-year-old Sulaimani has taken part in three consecutive World Cups in 1998, 2002 and 2006. A part of the national side since their victory at the AFC Asian Cup in the UAE in 1996, he plays an important role down left, breaking up opposition attacks and contributing to the attack with accurate passing, dangerous crosses and intelligent movement. Sulaimani has had occasional disciplinary problems in his career, but his experience is vital for the squad. He is considered a popular and an inspirational figure by teammates. 

 Mabrouk Zaid: Saudi Arabias No.1 goalkeeper, Zaid conceded just one goal and kept a clean sheet in six matches during the World Cup qualifiers. His consistently excellent performances received widespread praise, even from rival coaches. His superb reflexes and cool demeanour breed confidence among the defenders, as was the case when his club Al Ittihad made a successful defence of the AFC Champions League in 2005. Zaid rounded off a memorable year with a victory over Egyptian giants Al Ahly in the opening encounter of the World Club Championship in Japan.

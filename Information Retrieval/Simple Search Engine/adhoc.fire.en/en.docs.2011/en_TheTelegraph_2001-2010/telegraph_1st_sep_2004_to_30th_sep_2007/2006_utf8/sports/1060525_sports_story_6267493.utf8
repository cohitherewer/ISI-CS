 Team management wanted Agarkar

 - Ramesh Powar, Suresh Raina to stay back for Tests 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Basseterre (St Kitts): The national selectors back home (Ranjib Biswal is in the West Indies as manager for the one-dayers) have overlooked Ajit Agarkar for the four-Test series even though the team management, according to The Telegraphs sources, wanted him retained after the ODIs. 

Ajit has been bowling the best... His omission is a surprise as the team management wanted him to stay back, a well-placed source pointed out, on Wednesday afternoon. Agarkar, therefore, is the latest victim of the Kiran More-scripted looking-ahead-only policy. As was indicated in these columns, Ramesh Powar and Suresh Raina wont be going home from Trinidad, where the ODIs end on Sunday. 

Agencies add from Mumbai: The four selectors at home, who had a telephonic conversation with Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell, also included young quick VRV Singh and Dinesh Karthik as second wicketkeeper in the 16-man squad. 

Leg-spinner Anil Kumble and middle-order batsman VVS Laxman, who are not part of the ODI squad, have expectedly been picked for the longer version of the game. 

Besides Agarkar, those left out from the ODI squad are left-arm seamer Rudra Pratap Singh, middle-order batsman Venugopal Rao and opener Robin Uthappa. 

Explaining the expulsion of Agarkar, who bowled splendidly in the first three ODIs, More said VRV Singh was chosen ahead of the Mumbai bowler with a view to groom the former. 

VRV was selected as we wanted to groom him for the future. He has done well in domestic cricket and also bowled well for India A in Abu Dhabi except in the final (against Pakistan), More said. 

Also we consider Agarkar to be a fine one-day cricketer whose Test record is not that impressive. Hes done extremely well in the ODIs in the West Indies and we are happy for him, the former wicketkeeper said, adding that he wasnt completely out of Test reckoning. VRV is also quicker than Agarkar, More argued. 

Kumble, Laxman, VRV and Karthik will leave for the West Indies on Thursday night. 

The four-Test series starts in St Johns on Friday.

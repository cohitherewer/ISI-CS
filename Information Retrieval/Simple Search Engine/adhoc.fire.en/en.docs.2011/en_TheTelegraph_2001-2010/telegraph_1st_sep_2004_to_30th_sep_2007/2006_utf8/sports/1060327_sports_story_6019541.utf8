 Kallis on way to his century on Sunday 

Durban: Brett Lee and Ricky Ponting put Australia in a commanding position in the second Test against South Africa on Sunday. 

The visitors were 125 for one in their second innings at the close of play, a lead of 227, after South Africa had been bowled out for 267. 

Fast bowler Lee passed 200 Test wickets on his way to figures of five for 69 while captain Ponting hit seven fours and a six in his 48 not out. 

Jacques Kallis anchored South Africas innings with a gritty 114, his 24th Test century. 

The home team slumped to 10 for two before Kallis and AB de Villiers shared an unbroken stand of 130 to take them to close on Saturday. 

But the partnership was ended 12 balls into Sundays play, De Villiers (50) edging seamer Stuart Clark to Matthew Hayden in the gully. 

Kallis and Ashwell Prince added another 56 runs for the fourth wicket before Prince pulled Shane Warne to Andrew Symonds at square leg on 33. 

Warne struck again after lunch when Jacques Rudolph (13) was adjudged to have prodded a catch to Mike Hussey at short leg. 

Kallis was sixth out when he offered a return catch to Clark. He batted for 345 minutes, faced 223 balls and struck 17 fours.

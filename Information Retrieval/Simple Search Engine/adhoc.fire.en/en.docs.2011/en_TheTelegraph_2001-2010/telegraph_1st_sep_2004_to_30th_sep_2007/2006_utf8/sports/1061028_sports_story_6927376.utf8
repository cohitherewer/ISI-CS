 Domestic schedule a crazy one: Houghton

 - Sandip, Manjit injuries upset coachs plans

New Delhi: Injuries to two regulars in the national team goalkeeper Sandip Nandy and striker Manjit Singh during the recently-concluded Santosh Trophy has upset quite a few plans of chief coach Bob Houghton on the eve of the concluding Asian Cup qualifiers against Yemen on November 15. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa on Friday, the national coach said he was looking forward to have a balance of senior and junior boys for the Yemen match on the eve of the Asian Games, but now may have to rethink about his combination. 

I am not yet sure whether I can take four or five seniors for the Yemen match, Houghton said. But I would definitely like to try out a few under-23 boys on the eve of the Asian Games. In Doha, we can take only three seniors. Sandip is very much in my scheme of things. I only hope that he recovers before the Asian Games, opined the Englishman. 

Houghton is worried that another senior footballer, defender Mahesh Gawli, may not be match-fit for the Asian Games. He has remained injured for almost the entire period of four months I have been here, said Houghton. It could be a risk to take him to Doha as one of the three seniors. I called for Climax Lawrence in the recent camp, but he was not released by his club, he rued. 

The national coach said he didnt watch too many matches in the Santosh Trophy, even on the telly. I did watch a few matches and liked a few boys here and there, but that wouldnt have helped me in selecting the team for the Asian Games. You just cant call a few boys and rush them into the side. One needs time to judge and train a player. 

In China, Houghton said, he had 14 months to select the pre-Olympic team. Here I get only 14 days. The pre-Olympic camp will start on January 24. On February 8, we play our first match against Myanmar. We get absolutely no time. 

Calling Indias domestic calendar a crazy one, the British coach said in any other country, be it Asia, Europe, Africa or CONCAF, the national team meets at least once in a month. Here sometimes it meets once in six months. Thats not the way to raise the national team. 

For the Asian Games, the boys will get exactly six days to prepare. On November 17, we return from Yemen. On 24th, we are suppose to travel to Doha and play our first match against Hong Kong on November 29, Houghton said with a tinge of lament.

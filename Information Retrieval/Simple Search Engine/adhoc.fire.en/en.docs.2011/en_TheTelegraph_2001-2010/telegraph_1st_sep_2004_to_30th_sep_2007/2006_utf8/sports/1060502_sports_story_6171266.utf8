 Big Two eye pro thrust 

 - De Ridder blames it on injuries

Calcutta: With the chances of regaining the 10th National Football League for the ONGC being as good as over, both East Bengal and Mohun Bagan are planning to induct professional players as much as possible in the next season. 

The move is seen as an initial step towards being party to the AIFFs proposed Professional League from the 2007-08 season. 

According to a Mohun Bagan official, they have already started approaching players who are pro. Its a much thought-out plan from our end that our recruiting policy will focus more on professional players, he said. 

 East Bengal, on the other hand, have already sent a letter to the national governing body, asking for financial help in this regard. 

The set up of a Professional League has been recommended by the Asian Football Confederation in accordance with the Vision India Strategic Development Plan. 

Meanwhile, East Bengal coach Philippe de Ridder has attributed the injuries to key players for the failures in both Mumbai and Goa. He has given us some suggestions about the next season. He has also expressed his liking towards some players. Well sit with him once the team returns, an East Bengal official said. 

It has been learnt East Bengal have set their sights on Sporting Clube de Goas Dudu Omagbemi for the next season. 

Three-time champions East Bengal ? who are now on 28 points off 15 matches ? will play Sporting Clube de Goa next and then round off their league by hosting JCT. Mahindra ? leading the table at 29 points ? need a miraculous fall from their current position to leave the title-race open. 

Though the East Bengal official ruled out that the De Ridder-Mike Okoro stand-off had any role in the teams debacle, he pointed out that the bench strength was not properly taken care of. 

 The officials meeting with De Ridder, therefore, 

 will not be held on a cordial note, thats for sure. 

 THE TOP 5 

 Mahindra United 29 off 13 matches

 East Bengal 28 off 15 matches

 Mohun Bagan 21 off 14 matches 

 Dempo 20 off 14 matches 

 Sporting 19 off 12 matches

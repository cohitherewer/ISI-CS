The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 HIGHS amp; LOWS: GAME III

 India won their seventh toss in a row, the sequence 

 beginning with the Jamshedpur ODI against England on April 

 12, 2006, when Virender Sehwag led the team. Rahul Dravid 

 has since then kept up the good work

 Dravid recorded his ninth ODI duck, which was his second 

 as captain. He was dismissed first-ball against Sri Lanka 

 on August 3, 2005. This was his first nought as an opener 

 and also against the West Indies

 Sehwag became the 13th Indian to complete 150 ODI appearances 

 (of which 143 have been for the country)

 Sehwags 97 was his highest ODI score in the Caribbean, 

 easily beating the 32 he made in Port-of-Spain in 2002

 Sehwag, who missed his eighth ODI hundred, has not 

 made a three-figure score in his last 42 innings. His 

 last century (108) was vs Pakistan in Kochi on April 2, 

 2005

 The 112-run stand between Sehwag and Mohammed Kaif 

 was Indias best for the third wicket in the Caribbean. 

 It bettered the 72-run association between Mohinder Amarnath 

 and Kapil Dev in Berbice in 1983

 Sreesanth set a dubious world record when he scored 

 his first ODI run playing his 16th match. He displaced 

 from the record books West Indies paceman Patrick Patterson, 

 who took 14 matches to score his first run

 Ramnaresh Sarwan (115 not out) registered his highest 

 ODI score in his 100th match. This was his third century 

 in limited overs cricket

 Sarwan became the seventh batsman in ODI history to 

 make a three-figure score in his 100th match, the others 

 being ? Gordon Greenidge (102* in 1988), Chris Gayle (132* 

 in 2004), Chris Cairns (115 in 1999), Mohammed Yousuf 

 (129 in 2002), Kumar Sangakkara (101 in 2004) and Marcus 

 Trescothick (100* in 2005).

 This was only the second time under Greg Chappell (in 

 37 matches since July 30, 2005) that India have lost two 

 matches in a row. The previous occasion was when they 

 went down to Sri Lanka in Colombo (Premadasa) on August 

 9, 2005, followed by the loss to New Zealand in Bulawayo 

 on August 26, 2005

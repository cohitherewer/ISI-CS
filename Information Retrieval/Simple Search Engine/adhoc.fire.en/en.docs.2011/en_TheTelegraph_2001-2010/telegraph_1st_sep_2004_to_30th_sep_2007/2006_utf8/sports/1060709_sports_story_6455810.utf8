The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Wed like him back in 2007

 - Wessels praise for Sourav 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Ten months after Team India coach Greg Chappell put a question mark over Sourav Gangulys contribution to the spirit within the dressing room, Kepler Wessels declared he had been fantastic for Northamptonshire. 

Wessels, who played for both Australia (his debut, incidentally, was under Chappell) and South Africa, has been Northants coach for four years. 

Let me categorically say that Sourav has been fantastic in our dressing room? He has, indeed, been wonderful for team spirit and has been doing the things we expected him to, Wessels told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The former India captain, who turned 34 on the day his County coach showered much praise, is on a short-term contract as replacement for Australian Chris Rogers. 

I cant say off-hand, but Souravs last match for us will probably be at the end of the month? We dont know what his plans are for next summer, but we would like him to be with us for the entire 2007 season, Wessels said. 

He added: Obviously, we do realise his priority is to make a comeback at the highest level, but if hes available, he should return to Northampton? 

Wessels revealed that the contracts of both full-time overseas pros ? Rogers and his compatriot, quick Matt Nicholson ? end in September. 

Both slots are going to be open? Well have to give some thought, but Ive already told you about the one player we would like to have, he remarked. 

Sourav started off with a blob in the (Division II) Championship face-off against Worcestershire, but scored 71 in his first (and, thus far, only) 50 overs match, versus Nottinghamshire. 

In the Twenty20 Cup, Sourav has had two handsome scores: 73 and 44 not out, both against Worcestershire. 

As a bowler, Sourav has picked up wickets in every Twenty20 engagement. Clearly, hes being utilised as an allrounder ? a label given by one Kiran More not very long ago. 

Sourav may not have got a hundred, but he has been batting well? Bowling well, too? Most important, he has been working with the younger lads? Just what we wanted, Wessels, an uncompromising taskmaster, signed off. 

Northants next match is a Twenty20 one versus Warwickshire, in Birmingham, on Monday. 

Footnote: Sourav was scheduled to be in London on Saturday evening. As the Board brass is still there (the ICC meetings finished on Friday), theres a chance he could get to interact with one or two of the more influential gentlemen?

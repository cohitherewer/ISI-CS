The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paes delighted with semis form

 - Sania confident of striking gold 

JAYDEEP BASU

Doha: Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi on Tuesday made it clear that they would not settle for anything less than their second consecutive gold in the doubles event of the Asian Games tennis. 

Against the Pakistani rivals in the quarter finals, the ace Indian pair looked relaxed. But on Tuesday, both were in full flow, going all out for each point, despite knowing well that the Filipino duo would cave in sooner or later. 

We took it as a (gold) medal match, said Paes later. 

So we went all out. The Filipinos were good and we didnt want to take any chances. We havent played so well together for a long time, confessed Paes. 

But he didnt think it was an easy outing. 

Easy? what easy? he shot back. We played well, may be thats the reason why it looked easy to you, said Paes, who is gunning for his third doubles gold medal in the Asian Games. 

Bhupathi, who looked the unhappy member of the team in less than a week ago, appeared equally elated after the win. 

We planned it like that, he said. We wanted to put them under pressure from the very start. It worked. We also wanted to correct a few things in our volley game. That was also done. 

Like Paes and Bhupathi, Sania Mirza too sounded confident about striking gold. Why cant I win it after coming this far, she said. 

Li Na is a good friend of hers in the circuit. She is a fine player and has improved highly. So have I. 

Around two and half years ago she defeated me in a tour match. I am happy that I could beat her this time. 

Rankings, Sania said, doesnt bother her much. 

Li Na was much higher-ranked, but I beat her. Playing for the country gives you a different feeling. It inspires you to a great extent, the Indian star said.

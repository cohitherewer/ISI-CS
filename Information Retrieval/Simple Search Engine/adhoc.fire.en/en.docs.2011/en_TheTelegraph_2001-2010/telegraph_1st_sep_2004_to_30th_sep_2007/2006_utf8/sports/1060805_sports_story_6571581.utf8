 SA bowled out for 361

 - Second Test 

 - 650th victim for Muralidharan 

 Muralidharan 

Colombo: Sri Lanka off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan claimed his 650th victim as South Africa were bowled out for 361 on the first day of the second Test on Friday. 

The hosts, leading the two-match series 1-0, dominated the morning and evening sessions after the visitors had won the toss on a fine batting pitch at the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium. 

However, South Africa rallied during the afternoon session with a record 161-run partnership between stand-in captain Ashwell Prince (86) and middle-order batsman AB de Villiers (95). 

Allrounder Shaun Pollock, who missed the first Test to attend the birth of his second daughter, provided late resistance with a whirlwind 57 from 70 balls in the final hour of the day. 

The South Africans were aggressive against Muralidharan, but could not prevent the off-spinner from extending his career tally to 650 wickets as he claimed the 55th five-wicket haul of his career. The 34-year-old finished with five for 128 from 33.4 overs.

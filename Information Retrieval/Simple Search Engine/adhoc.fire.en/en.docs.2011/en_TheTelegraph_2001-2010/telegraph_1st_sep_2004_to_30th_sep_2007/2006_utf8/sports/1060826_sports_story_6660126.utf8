 Scott in lead

 - Kapur's impressive start

Ohio: Indias Shiv Kapur, closed with a brilliant spurt of three successive birdies to finish his first round with a creditable 72 at the $7.5 million World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio. The score put him in the tied 42nd place from among the 78 starters at the Firestone Country Club on Thursday. 

The 24-year-old, who qualified for the event after his win at the Volvo Masters of Asia, started on the 10th tee and was three-over with dropped shots on the 13th, 17th and 18th holes. He dropped two more shots on the first and six holes to be five-over at that stage. Just when his position seemed hopeless, Kapur fought back with a hattrick of birdies on the seventh, eighth and ninth holes. 

Australias Adam Scott, hungry for his first victory this year after several close calls, charged into a two-shot lead in the opening round. The world No. 6 rattled up nine birdies and two bogeys on his way to a sparkling seven-under-par 63. 

 Tiger Woods birdied two of the last three holes for a 67 to lie joint fourth with Britons Luke Donald and David Howell, Americans Davis Love III and David Toms and New Zealander Michael Campbell. (Reuters)

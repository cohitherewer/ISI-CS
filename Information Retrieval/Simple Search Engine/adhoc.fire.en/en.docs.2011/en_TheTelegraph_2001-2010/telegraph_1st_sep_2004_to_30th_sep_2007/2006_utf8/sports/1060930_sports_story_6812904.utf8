 Gangjee takes lead

 - TAIWAN MASTERS 

 - Chowrasia disqualified 

 Rahil Gangjee hit two-under 70 

Taipei: Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia was disqualified for failing to sign his scorecard in the second round of the $ 500,000 Mercuries Taiwan Masters. 

The Indian, who has been in great form this season, had shot a superb five-under 67 in his second round after his brilliant course record-equalling eight-under 64 on first day. 

That would have given him a whopping five-shot lead over then second-placed fellow Indian Rahil Gangjee (70). 

Gangjee was the beneficiary of this unfortunate incident as he took the lead at the midway stage with a second round of two-under 70 that carried him to eight-under 136 for 36 holes. 

Gangjee was tied second overnight with a six-under 66 on first day. Chowrasia came home with a 69 before the disqualification. 

It otherwise turned out to be a good day for the Indians, six of whom made the cut. Amandeep Johl (71) and Gaurav Ghei (72) were tied 21st at one-under 143 for two rounds, while Shiv Kapur shot a one-under 71 to move up to tied 28th after being 43rd overnight. Digvijay Singh (72) and Harmeet Kahlon (71) were tied 30th at one-over 143. 

The cut came at two-over and missing it were Arjun Singh (74) and Gurbaaz Mann (76). 

American Jason Knutzon also fired a 70 and took sole second spot. Korean Ted Oh carded a 68 and was in joint third place together with American Bryan Saltus who scored his second consecutive 69.

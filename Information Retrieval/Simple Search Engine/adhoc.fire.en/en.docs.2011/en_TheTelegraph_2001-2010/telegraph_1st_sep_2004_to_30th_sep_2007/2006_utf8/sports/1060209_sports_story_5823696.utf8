 Shib Shankar in Board XI squad

Mumbai: Vikram Rajvir Singh and Munaf Patel, considered to be among the quickest bowlers in India, have been picked for the Board Presidents XI to play England in a three-day tour match in Baroda from February 23. 

Bengals Shib Shankar Paul has also been selected as part of the squad. 

England arrive in India on Monday for three Tests and seven one-dayers and open their two-month tour with a three-day warm-up match in Mumbai from February 18. 

Indias national selectors also picked openers Gautam Gambhir and Wasim Jaffer for the Baroda match, which is the opening first-class match of the tour. 

Both toured Pakistan last month without playing in any of the three Tests. We need to solve the openers problem, said chairman of selectors Kiran More. Vikram, a 21-year-old uncapped pacer from Punjab, was picked for the home one-day series against Sri Lanka last year, but was forced to opt out due to an ankle injury.

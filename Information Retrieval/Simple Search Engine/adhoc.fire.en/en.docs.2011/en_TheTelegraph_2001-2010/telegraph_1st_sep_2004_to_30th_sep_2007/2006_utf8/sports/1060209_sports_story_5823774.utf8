 Fransa Pax soften stand

Panaji: Fransa Paxs club management said that it would play in the 10 th National Football League for the ONGC Cup provided the All India Football Federation (AIFF) reschedule their match against Air India which they boycotted on February 3. 

The decision was taken after the club management called for a meeting of their players, coach and manager on Wednesday. Micky Pacheco, president of the club said that his team is willing to take part in the ongoing NFL if the AIFF reschedule their match against Air India. 

The AIFF rejected the clubs demand, for a replay of their match against Mahindra United on January 30, at the emergency committee meeting on Tuesday. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I should be fit for Karachi, says Inzy

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faisalabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who is suffering from a back problem, is much better. 

Im much better and should be fit for the third (and final) Test, in Karachi, he told The Telegraph on returning to the team hotel on Tuesday evening. 

Inzamam, it may be recalled, required a runner when he resumed his innings on Sunday and didnt field at all during Indias first innings. Of course, if absolutely necessary (highly unlikely at this point in time), he will bat on the last day ? Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Indian mediumpacer Ajit Agarkar is also much better. He said: The left hamstring has responded to treatment... Fortunately, I didnt suffer a tear... Im much better and bowled off a shortened run-up today... Tomorrow, I intend doing so off the full run-up... 

The injury made Agarkar miss the ongoing second Test, but even hes hopeful of being available for the one in Karachi, beginning on Sunday.

 Father prays for Inzy

Islamabad: The father of Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is praying his son will be cleared when he faces a disciplinary hearing, a media report said on Thursday. 

Ageing Intizam-ul Haq, a Muslim spiritual leader, told an Urdu daily that his son was innocent of charges of ball tampering and bringing cricket into disrepute. 

I am hopeful that Allah will bring my son successfully out of this crisis, the daily quoted Inzamams father as saying. I have made special prayers for my son for the success of my son and for the glory of my nation during the Shab-e-Mairaj, he said, referring to a Muslim holy day. 

Bearded Intizam said the ball-tampering allegation was fake. He added that he was extremely grateful to President Pervez Musharraf for taking his sons side. 

Officials said on Monday that Musharraf, who is patron-in-chief of the PCB and an avid fan of the game, had phoned Inzamam to offer his support. (AFP)

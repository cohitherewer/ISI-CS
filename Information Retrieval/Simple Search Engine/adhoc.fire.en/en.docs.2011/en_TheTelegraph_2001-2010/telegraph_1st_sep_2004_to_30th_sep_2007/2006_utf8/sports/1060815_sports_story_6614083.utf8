The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ban imposed on receiving gifts

 - Security restrictions on Team India 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The Indian cricketers and support staff have been instructed to strictly follow the security-dos and donts listed by the Sri Lankan authorities as well as our own High Commission, in Colombo. 

An advisory was given when we landed From this afternoon, though, everybody connected with the team has been instructed not to deviate from what has been laid down, manager Sanjay Jagdale told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from the Taj Samudra, on Monday evening, he added: Theres no panic Weve had a team meeting and I briefed the players and fellow officials about my discussions with our diplomats and Sri Lanka Cricket 

According to Jagdale (who was the manager in 2005, as well) hed specifically raised the security issue with the High Commission soon after landing in Colombo, but nobody said anything to suggest an immediate review was needed. 

Among other restrictions, theres a ban on accepting gifts from well-wishers and interacting (in any manner) with strangers. 

Most of the other restrictions are routine for the subcontinent as also when, for example, the team tours South Africa: No going out alone, moving in groups and never staying out till late. 

Unlike last year, when the High Commission had assigned a security officer (K. N. Murali, now an assistant commissioner in Chennai), to be with the team throughout, somebody or the other has only been around on trips outside the hotel. 

That may now change. 

New Delhi, by the way, didnt send a recce team as was done before the 2005 trip to Sri Lanka but High Commissioner Nirupama Rao maintained that shouldnt be seen as a failing. 

One big reason why an advance party came last year was that we had to play in Dambulla, too This time, such a visit wasnt deemed necessary, she explained. 

Incidentally, coach Greg Chappells wife and vice-captain Virender Sehwags better-half are part of the touring party. 

Footnote: Back in 1993, there were two bomb explosions at a temple when the Indians, led by Mohammed Azharuddin, were in Colombo. Six got killed, but wed stayed put.

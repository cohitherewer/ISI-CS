 Dempo retain Ranty for Rs 30 lakh

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: At a time when East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting are busy preparing for a long drawn legal battle over the possession of a few footballers, the three Goan teams in the NFL are working quietly to gain strength in the transfer market. 

Like last season, Dempo SC continue to be the biggest beneficiaries among the Goan sides. With a budget close to Rs 2 crore, the first thing Dempo did was to retain Nigerian striker Ranty Martins for the third consecutive year. Hotly chased by Mohun Bagan, Ranty is believed to have received Rs. 30 lakh to earn the status of highest paid footballer in Goa. 

Climax Lawrence, injured since December, topped the list again. Dempo retained him once again with an agreed payment of Rs. 18 lakh for the season. They have reportedly paid Rs. 13 lakh to keep Clifford Miranda and have paid around Rs. 12 lakh each to Sameer Naik, Valerian Rebello and Riston Rodrigues. 

Their new signings include Anthony Pereira (Vasco), voted the GFAs best striker, three players from self-disbanded Fransa Pax Football Club ?? Marcus Peixoto, Peter Carvalho and captain Cressan Antao. 

Sporting seem to be struggling to keep their flock together. JCT have already snatched away Nigerian striker Edeh Chidi. To make the matter worse, East Bengal have lured away Vincent Pires and Bibiano Fernandes. In a desperate attempt, Sporting now have signed Nigerians Bello Rasaq (Fransa) and Ernest Jeremiah (former East Bengal) and said to have offered Rs. 11 lakh to stop Filip Gomes from leaving for Dempo. 

Dudu Omagbemi, however, has promised to stay back in Sporting.

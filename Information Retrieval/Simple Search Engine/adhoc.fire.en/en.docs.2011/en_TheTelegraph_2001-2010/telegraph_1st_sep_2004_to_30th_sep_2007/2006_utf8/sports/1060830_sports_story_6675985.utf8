 Matthews: As a leader Greg has an appalling record

 - Aussies divided over criteria for the new coach 

 Chappell 

London: Former Australian Test cricketer Greg Matthews thinks Greg Chappell could be one of the favourites to take over after John Buchanan steps down after the World Cup next year but does not think too highly of the batting legends credentials to take the world champions to the next level. 

Allan Border and Andrew Hilditch will have a big say in it (selection of the new coach). AB sits on the board, hes a big Greg Chappell fan and theres a big chance of him getting the job for that very simple reason, Matthews said. 

Its impossible not to respect Chappell as a player but as a leader hes done a desperately poor job. The perception is that hes a little bit special. He averaged 53 as a batsman that doesnt make him special as a coach to me, I played with him and against him, he told a TV channel. 

Gregs had an incredible dream run as a captain, he had Lillee, Marsh and Thomson and did pretty well, but apart from that as a leader he has an appalling record. 

Meanwhile, Australias top players were divided about who should replace John Buchanan. I think its just going to come down to whos going to be the best fit for our group, Ricky Ponting said. 

I think the success of John Buchanan has proven that its not necessarily the case that you need to have played at that level, said Adam Gilchrist. 

But not everyone agrees with Ponting and Gilchrist and leg-spinner Shane Warne said he would prefer the next coach to have played at Test level. (AGENCIES)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fascinating duel on the cards in Paris

The European claycourt circuit has developed into a two-horse race for supremacy between Federer and Nadal. They are neck-and-neck in the home stretch, a distance ahead of the rest who look like hacks. Only injury could pull Nadal and Federer back to the field. 

The French Open at Roland Garros, resplendent in the summer greenery of the Bois de Bologne, could witness a fascinating duel between the two. A clash between Federer, with his quiver full of shots, and the muscular Nadal, his game anchored in a hub of viscous spin, would attract a worldwide audience. 

For Federer, the stakes are sky-high. Already hailed as an all-time great, victory at Roland Garros will establish Federer as the greatest ever. A frustrated Sampras, despite several attempts, could not bridge the divide between faster surfaces and the slow red clay at Roland Garros. Federer does not have the power of Sampras, but has more variety and a better ? and more consistent ? top-spin backhand. 

But just look at what Federer is up against. Five losses in six matches to Nadal, who is riding high on a wave of 53 consecutive victories on claycourts, is a shattering statistic. Even though the matches were very close and Federer had two match-points in their last clash ? a five-hour epic in Rome ? it must have taken a heavy toll on his confidence. 

 Stakes are sky-high for Roger Federer

This cannot be taken lightly and Federers statement, I am on the right track, I improved a few things in this match, does not sound very confident or convincing. After the gruelling encounter in Rome, both Federer and Nadal were so fatigued that they were forced to pull out of the Hamburg Masters. This could prove to be a blessing in disguise for both players. 

For Nadal, the summit is distant but in sight. But even if Nadal wins in Paris, he wont be able to wrest the No. 1 spot from Federer who has amassed ranking points which are currently beyond the Spaniards range. Nadals style of play reminds me of the Hammer ? a gas-guzzling monster of a car with the accelerator flat to the boards. At 19, Nadal has a relatively full tank of energy, but nervous energy is irreplaceable and such profligacy with his resources could shorten his career. 

The Federer-Nadal rivalry is one of the best things that has happened to tennis in recent years. Both behave like gentlemen and play the game in an old world spirit. Their contrasting styles will pull the game out from the boring groove of trading endless groundshots from the backhand side of the baseline. 

After some time, speed, skill, consistency and accuracy ? now at their highest level in the history of the game ? will become the norm and boring. New styles and patterns of play have to emerge to keep the game interesting and healthy. Both Federer and Nadal have brought pride to the game of tennis. Their rivalry and different styles, from Alpine calm to passionate Flamenco, will thrill the tennis world. 

 At a glittering ceremony in Barcelona recently, Federer 

 was chosen the Laureus World Sportsman of the year by a 

 jury of 40 of the greatest sportspersons of all time and 

 Nadal received the title for the worlds top newcomer. 

 They have enriched the game of tennis.

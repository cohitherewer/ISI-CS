 Langer breaks Vivs record

London: Justin Langer broke legendary West Indies batsman Viv Richards Somerset record when he made 342 against Surrey at Guildford on the second day of the County Championship on Thursday. 

The 35-year-old left-handers innings lasted 416 balls with two sixes and 43 fours, surpassing Richards 322, which was previous highest individual score for Somerset. 

Anil Kumble playing for Surrey had a disappointing start to his County campaign, as he picked one for 100 on the Wednesday. He had Arul Suppiah caught by Azhar Mahmood for 71 when he was scoring runs with frequent boundaries. 

Meanwhile, Dinesh Mongia went wicketless for Leicestershire as Derbyshire closed the day at 355 for eight.

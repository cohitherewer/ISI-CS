The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Stewards needed to be firmer 

 STAR RACER

 Things are going from bad to worse and the RCTC stewards, apparently busy with issues other than racing, are hardly making any effort to correct them.

 Others in the ranks too, seem to be more devoted to matters other than the sport. Therefore, professionals attached to the heavyweight owners are having a field day, capitalising on the faction-ridden administration, which may pose some major problems to those at the helm of affairs in the coming weeks.

 Stewards did try to take a rigid stand on last Fridays offenders but the support team, it was learnt, failed to substantiate the charges willingly or otherwise. As a result, the Yadavs and the Gurangs got away with soft punishments.The Stewards needed to be firmer.

 One thing that can be taken for granted is that racing will never improve with this sort of attitude towards the sport.

 The poor performances of hot favourites like Imperial Stride and Silver Grey, on the day, were hard to digest. It may be sheer coincidence that trainer Javed Khans Local Thriller toppled the Grey and lost by the proverbial whisker to Wizard Of Oz, a stablemate of Imperial Stride in the Robin Hood Cup.

 Javed knows his stock well and places them accordingly. But he failed to gauge the strength of his another ward, Charleston, in the Sunray Handicap, which was claimed by Gypsy King.

 Admittedly, Gypsy King is a superior breed, but the speedy Charleston should have finished second. However, he raced in fifth, and on the wide out all through the trip.

 Star Perfection was the hottest fancy and the Classic filly won the 1,400m Hilliard Cup by more than six lengths. Yet the Steinbeck-Santorini Star daughter failed to impress against a Class I and II combined opposition. She had to be pushed for all she was worth, by Imran Chisty, to over take Serrafina nearing the distance post.

 However, it being a preparatory race after her four-month lay off, the Daniel David-trainee is expected to show her real mettle in the 1,000 Guineas.

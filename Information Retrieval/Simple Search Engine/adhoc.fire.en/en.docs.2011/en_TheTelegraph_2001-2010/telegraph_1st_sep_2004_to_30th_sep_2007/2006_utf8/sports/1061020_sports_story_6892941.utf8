 Materazzis 

book saddens Zidane

Paris: Zinedine Zidane said he had been saddened to see Marco Materazzi profit from the head-butt he got from the Frenchman in the World Cup final. 

Materazzi has recently published a book titled What I really said to Zidane, which includes 249 phrases he might have said to the former France captain. 

When asked whether he had received or would buy the book, Zidane said: No. 

According to an Italian sports daily, however, Materazzi will donate proceeds from the book to Unicef. It has gone on sale for around 10 euros and features a picture of the head-butt on its front cover. 

Zidane was sent off in the second period of extra-time in the July 9 final in Berlin for head-butting Materazzi, who had insulted the French midfield maestro. 

Italy went on to defeat France 5-3 on penalties after the teams had been tied 1-1. Zidane put France ahead with a penalty before Materazzi headed the equaliser.

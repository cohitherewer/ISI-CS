 Deep disappointed on missing 200

A STAFF REPORTER

 Deep Dasgupta at the Eden on Sunday 

Calcutta: Deep Dasgupta is disappointed at missing out on a double hundred, though, Bengals performance has left him more than satisfied. 

It was a good opportunity to get a double hundred? Im a little disappointed at missing out on it. Were definitely happy at the turn of events. Our aim this morning was to bat through the day and we almost achieved it, Deep, who was out for 171, said. 

The aim will be to try and bat as long as we can tomorrow. Laxmi (Ratan Shukla) should get a double hundred? There has been some slow turn on this wicket? Im taking one match at a time and will focus on the final later, the Bengal captain added. 

Shukla, who is batting on 137, said: I batted the way the team wanted me to perform. I tried to restrict my shots and play according to the situation. 

Happy at his maiden hundred in Ranji Trophy, he added: I wasnt getting the starts this season and I was determined to make most of this match. In the last two years, I have been dismissed for ten times in the 80s. 

Shukla said he was grateful to coach Paras Mhambrey and Deep. 

Paras helped me a lot? He worked with me extra hours at the nets? All credit to him. 

Deep, too, encouraged me all along the partnership. When I was dropped on 84, he asked me to keep a cool head and remember that I needed just 16 more runs. Thankfully, I got it in the end.

 Soumyadeep aims to improve world ranking

 - Mouma targets Asian Games medal

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Having exacted her revenge on the Sri Lankan player in the SAF Games final, Mouma Das feels she is on the right track for claiming the much-coveted medal at the Asian Games. 

Its a fantastic feeling to have won the individual table tennis title in back-to-back SAF Games. It will certainly give me a boost in my preparation for the Asian Games, Mouma said after arriving in the city from Colombo on Friday. 

It would have been nice had I played against Poulami (Ghatak) in the final. But when she lost to Sri Lankas Deepika Rodrigo in the semis, I wanted to settle scores with the latter. Despite a partisan crowd, I was confident and gave her no chance, Mouma said. 

For Soumyadeep Roy, the reaction was mixed. He lost his title to Achanta Sharath Kamal on a day when he was conferred with the Arjuna Award. We wanted to ensure both gold and silver for India. Though losing in the final was disappointing, nothing can be compared with winning the Arjuna Award. This is something Ive been looking forward to achieving, Soumyadeep, who also returned to the city on Friday, pointed out. 

Unlike Mouma, the national champion, however, doesnt want to focus on the Doha meet right now. Asian Games is over three months away. My immediate target is to improve the world ranking from the current No. 215 position, he said. 

Both Mouma and Soumyadeep, along with Poulami will join the national camp in Patiala next month for a number of European Pro-Tour meets.

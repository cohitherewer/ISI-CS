 Indias tour to NZ postponed

Wellington: Indias cricket tour to New Zealand scheduled for early next year has been postponed until late 2008, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said on Thursday. 

The tour, which was to include three Tests and five ODIs, was postponed with the agreement of both countries, NZC said in a statement. 

The World Cup had been rescheduled to the start of March from early April, not allowing enough time for the tour to take place, it said. 

Meanwhile, in a separate incident, allrounder Andrew Flintoff has a series of off-field activities lined up as part of his benefit season during Englands visit to India in February-March this year. 

Flintoff, whose benefit season opened on Wednesday night, will have dinner with the Indian team before the third Test in Mumbai, according to a newspaper report. The allrounder is also expected to play golf the day after with Ian Botham and David Gower. (Agencies)

Mumbai: Injury-prone New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond said on Thursday that he had fully recovered after breaking down on his countrys tour of South Africa in April and was looking forward to spearheading his teams bowling in the October-November Champions Trophy in India. 

I am fully fit now and am looking forward to play in the Champions Trophy, said the 31-year-old Christchurch-born pacer who has started training with his countrys former national boxing coach to improve his fitness. 

Bond, who has troubled all the leading batsmen in the world with his searing pace and movement, was here to promote a specially made light-weight cricket shoe by a sports apparel major along with young India pacer Sreesanth. 

We will start a two-week camp for the Champions Trophy around September 25 and reach India a week ahead of our first match (against South Africa at the Brabourne Stadium here on October 16), said Bond, who was off the game for nearly two years because of a stress fracture of his back after bowling splendidly in the 2003 World Cup in South Africa. 

My back has troubled me since my youth. I have undergone a surgery to correct it and am feeling cent per cent fit. It has been no different (frustration of not playing) from other fast bowlers in the world who have been troubled by injuries, said the bowler, who has taken 64 wickets in 14 Tests and has a fine strike rate of plus 18 in one-day Internationals. 

Bond said the New Zealanders will face a big challenge to adjust to the hot and humid weather conditions in India after experiencing cold conditions back home at present. 

At present the conditions in New Zealand are pretty cold, with the mercury hovering around three or four degrees (Celsius). Yes, it will be a big challenge of coming to terms with the humid conditions when we come here and we hope to conquer it, he said. 

Sreesanth said that he was not looking too far ahead into the future as far as playing was concerned but was focusing on one game at a time. 

I am focusing on game by game and to keep doing well consistently I am following the training regimen given by the team management, the Kerala bowler said.

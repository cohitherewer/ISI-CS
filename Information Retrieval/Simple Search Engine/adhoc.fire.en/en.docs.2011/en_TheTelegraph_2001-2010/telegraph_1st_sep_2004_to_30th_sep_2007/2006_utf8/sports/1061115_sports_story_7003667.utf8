Lahore: A century from captain Brian Lara could not prevent the West Indies from tumbling to a nine-wicket defeat by Pakistan on the fourth day of the first Test on Tuesday. 

Lara scored a defiant 122 runs, his 33rd Test hundred, but it was not enough to stop the West Indies from suffering their 16th defeat in their last 23 Tests since May, 2004. 

Pakistan lost opener Mohammad Hafeez, trapped leg before by Corey Collymore, before Imran Farhat and Younis Khan completed the formality of scoring 13 runs for victory after the West Indies were bowled out for 291 runs shortly after tea. 

Young pacer Umar Gul finished with match figures of nine for 164 after his five for 65 in the first innings. 

Man of the Match Gul, who bowled a testing line and got reverse swing on a low-bouncing and slow-paced pitch, made up for the absence of strike bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, banned for a doping offence. 

The Test was a personal triumph for the 37-year-old Lara, who made his first hundred in Pakistan at the venue where he made his debut 16 years ago. The left-hander, who also got a first-innings 61, notched up his third successive century against Pakistan after scoring two against them last year at home.

 Sania loses to top seed Schnyder

 Mason (Ohio): Sania Mirza 

 gave a tough fight to top seed Patty Schnyder before going 

 down to the Swiss in a rain-delayed quarter final showdown 

 of the $175,000 WTA Cincinnati Open tennis tournament. 

 The ninth-seeded Indian, who was playing her first 

 quarter final of the season, made Schnyder toil for the 

 6-7 (7-9), 5-7 victory in the tie which was interrupted 

 twice on Friday. 

The 19-year-old Sania will now concentrate on her doubles semi-finals, where she is partnering Polands Marta Domachowska, as the third seeds in the Tier III event. 

Schnyder, who is yet to lose a set in the tournament, will be up against fourth seed Katarina Srebotnik of Slovenia in the semi-final. 

Srebotnik overwhelmed sixth-seeded Marion Bartoli of France 6-2, 6-1 to reach her first semi-final of the year. Schnyder has won both previous meetings between the two, including one at Miami earlier this year. 

In the other last-eight stage match, Serena Williams advanced to the semi-final with a 6-2, 6-2 win over fellow American Amy Frazier. Williams made short work of Frazier despite coming after a long injury lay-off since the Australian Open. 

 The seven-time Grand Slam champion, who has slipped 

 to 139th rank in the world, has been impressive on her return 

 and has not dropped a set while dropping just 12 games in 

 three matches. She will face unseeded Russian Vera Zvonareva, 

 a former top 10 player, in the semi-final. (PTI)

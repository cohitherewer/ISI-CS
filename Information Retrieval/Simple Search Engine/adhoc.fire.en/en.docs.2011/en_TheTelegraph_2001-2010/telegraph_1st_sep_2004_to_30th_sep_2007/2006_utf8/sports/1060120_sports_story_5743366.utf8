 Vengsarkar lauds Sehwag, Dravid

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar on Thursday described Virender Sehwag as great and the Gaddafi wicket as a bad publicity for Test cricket. 

In the city as consultant with the Mainland-Sambaran Cricket Academy, Vengsarkar said: Sehwag may not be well equipped technically, but he is certainly a great batsman. He is a fantastic player when it comes to eye-hand co-ordiantion and balance. His role will be crucial in Indias chances. 

Vengsarkar was also lauded Rahul Dravid for deciding to open the innings in the Lahore Test.

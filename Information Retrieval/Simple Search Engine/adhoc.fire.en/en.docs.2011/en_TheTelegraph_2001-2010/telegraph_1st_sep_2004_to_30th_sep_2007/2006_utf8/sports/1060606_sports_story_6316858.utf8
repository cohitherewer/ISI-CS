 Murali hands Lanka win

 Muralidharan, after his haul of eight wickets on Monday 

Nottingham: Muttiah Muralidharan just missed out on a historic 10-wicket haul as Sri Lanka crushed England by 134 runs in the third and final Test to level the series 1-1 on Monday. 

The home side, set a record 325 to win on a dry, wearing pitch, collapsed from 84 without loss to 190 all out on the fourth day. 

Off-spinner Muralidharan finished with eight for 70 off 30 overs, a spell which was only interrupted by tea. 

He looked on course to join fellow spinners Jim Laker of England and Anil Kumble of India as the only men to take 10 wickets in a Test innings. 

But after dismissing the first seven batsmen, his chance evaporated when Matthew Hoggard was brilliantly run out by a direct throw from Charmara Kapugedera. 

Muralidharan has now taken 635 wickets in 106 Tests, capturing 10 wickets or more in 16 of them. Shane Warne of Australia, the world record holder, has taken 685 wickets in 140 matches. 

At one stage the 34-year-old took four for seven in 31 balls, including the scalps of England captain Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen in the same over. In 69 balls before tea, his figures were six for 13. 

Muralidharan spent most of Monday morning licking his lips as he watched Englands young spinner Monty Panesar wrap up the Sri Lankan innings by completing figures of five for 78, his first Test five-wicket haul. 

Meanwhile, Mahela Jayawardene has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent on Sunday.

 Agarkar wants to maintain consistency

Mumbai: Ajit Agarkar feels the emergence of a host of promising fast bowlers is a healthy development, though it will put pressure on him to perform. 

Its a healthy development. Its very good for the team, the advent of two or three young pacers who have done well. They are all between 22 and 24 years in age and the future looks good, Agarkar said. 

More competition is always good for the team as well as for individuals. You know you have to keep performing consistently, the 28-year-old said. 

Agarkar felt not having had an extended run could be one reason why his record in Tests was not as impressive as the one-dayers. 

Meanwhile Ramesh Powar is unruffled by the prospect of bowling to Brian Lara in his backyard, saying like any other batsman he was also bound to make a mistake and get out.

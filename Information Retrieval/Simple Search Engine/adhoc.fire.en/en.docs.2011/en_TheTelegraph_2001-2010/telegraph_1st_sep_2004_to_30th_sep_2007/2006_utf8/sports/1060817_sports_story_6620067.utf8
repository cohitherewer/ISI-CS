 IOA move leaves grapplers in lurch

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After one year of protracted court battle, there is more bad news for the wrestlers. While a 418-member strong Indian contingent is set to board the Colombo-bound flight for the SAF Games, the grapplers have been left in the lurch by the IOA, presumably to satisfy the ego of a few officials. 

According to sources, the executive committee of the IOA had taken a decision at least two months back not to send the wrestling team for the SAF Games, despite the fact that India topped the medals tally in wrestling in the last edition. 

India claimed four gold and three silver medals in seven categories. Hosts Pakistan finished second with three gold and four silver medals.India claimed four gold and three silver medals in seven categories. Hosts Pakistan finished second with three gold and four silver medals. 

While senior officials remained tight-lipped on the issue, sources revealed that the IOA did not forward the invitation letter for participation in the SAF Games to the concerned authorities. 

This was after the Delhi high court dismissed the IOA-appointed ad hoc committee to run wrestling in the country and appointed Justice JK Mehta to hold independent elections. 

It may be recalled that the IOA, last year, quashed the Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) and appointed a two-member ad hoc committee to run the sport. A section of the WFI took the matter to the court, which resulted in the appointment of Justice Mehta. It is nothing but a matter of ego for a section within the IOA, said an IOA official, on conditions of anonymity. 

The infighting between the IOA and the WFI has brought wrestling in the country to almost a standstill for the past one year. 

Under normal circumstances, SAI, on an average, holds 25 national level wrestling camps in a year. Since September 2005, no camp has been organised except the one for the Asian cadet meet last month.

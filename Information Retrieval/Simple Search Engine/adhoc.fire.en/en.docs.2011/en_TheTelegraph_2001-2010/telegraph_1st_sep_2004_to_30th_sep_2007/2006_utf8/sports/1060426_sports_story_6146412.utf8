 Waste of money: Miandad 

 - Rhodes to assist Pakistan for two weeks 

 Javed Miandad 

Dubai: Former South African cricketer Jonty Rhodes has said that he would assist the Pakistan squad for two weeks before their tour of England in June, a move that was dismissed by former coach Javed Miandad as nothing but a waste of money. 

Rhodes, here to conduct a cricket clinic for young children, said: I will be assisting Pakistan for only two weeks before their England tour. 

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is in the process of hiring the South African, hailed as one of the worlds greatest fielders, on a short-term basis and expects to utilise his expertise in improving the fielding of the seniors as well as the Pakistan A team. 

I have been invited by Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer. I would be going for two weeks before their tour of England, mainly to help them improve their fielding, said Rhodes, currently employed with the Standard Bank in South Africa. 

Rhodes said he felt great that all the teams were focussing on fielding and believed that the team with best fielders would lift the next World Cup. 

I am happy that every team is now focusing on improving their fielding... Australians are the favourites to win the next World Cup, not because they are good with the bat and the ball but because they are good on the field too. 

Pakistan, India, South Africa and New Zealand are all evenly matched. It is their fielding that will make the difference, he was quoted as saying by a local daily. 

Rhodes also didnt rule out being a full-fledged coach in future, saying: If I get chance to coach a national side I will go for that as it will be a brave new challenge for me. 

Meanwhile, Miandad has criticised the PCB for its decision to hire Rhodes as fielding consultant, saying it was nothing but a waste of money. 

I dont know where this idea came from. And I dont think Jonty would be able to make much of a difference to our fielding standards by just coming over here for a few weeks. It would be a waste of good money, he was quoted as saying in a Pakistani daily. 

Miandad felt that improvement in fielding standards depended on the individual players willingness. 

Meanwhile, Miandad came out in support of Shahid Afridi and has asked the PCB to find out the actual reason(s) which prompted the allrounder to quit Tests until the next World Cup. 

I was surprised to hear the PCB chairman (Shaharyar Khan) say that the board would have to review the terms of Afridis central contract, if he does not change his decision. 

Instead of talking about money and contracts, I think the PCB should try to find out why he has taken this strange decision, Miandad said.

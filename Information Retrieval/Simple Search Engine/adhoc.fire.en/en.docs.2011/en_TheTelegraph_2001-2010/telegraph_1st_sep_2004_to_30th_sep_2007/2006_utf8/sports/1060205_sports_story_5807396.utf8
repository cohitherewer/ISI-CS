 Lampard tells Liverpool to do talking on pitch

 - Well probably have to go up a notch or two against Barcelona 

MATT HUGHES

 We hope to prove that we are the best again this year, says Frank Lampard 

It says much about Liverpools emergence as the biggest threat to Chelsea that there is a growing amount of bad blood between the teams. Their Barclays Premiership meeting at Stamford Bridge Sunday will bristle with bile. 

When such an affable individual as Frank Lampard feels put out, it is clear that things have got out of hand. The midfield player is still annoyed by the taunts that preceded the corresponding fixture at Anfield in last October, with Jamie Carragher, his England teammate, labelling Chelsea as a long-ball team, and he believes such criticisms were out of order. On that occasion Chelsea silenced a baying crowd with a stunning 4-1 victory and Lampard has told Sundays opponents to do their talking on the pitch. 

I wouldnt say they got under our skin, but there were things that were said before the last game, he said. We felt we had been talked about in a bad way and we put it right in that game, which is the main place to do your talking. Put things right there. 

The only thing that surprises is when players talk badly about other teams. I understand the right for fans and press to say things critical, but I dont think players should criticise teams who have been successful and who are doing things the right way. 

Lampard seems to forget that, in playground parlance, Jose Mourinho started it, by criticising Liverpools football and almost refusing to recognise their Champions League triumph, but nevertheless Rafael Benitez seems to share the view that he and his players said a little too much in the build-up to their last meeting. 

The Liverpool manager made the uncharacteristic error of claiming that Chelsea were afraid of his team; this time he has retreated behind familiar platitudes while discouraging his players from discussing the opposition. 

Perhaps they have realised that there is nothing to be gained in trying to rile Chelsea, who as well as having a world-class squad, are developing a siege mentality under Mourinho. The Portuguese appears to thrive on confrontation, even squabbling with the likeable Benitez after their two Champions League encounters earlier this season, but his players also buy into the us-against-the world psychology. 

I understand what the manager is saying, Lampard said. Theres a feeling that has gone with Chelsea, which is maybe understandable with the money weve spent and the way the club has moved forward in such a short space of time. Maybe people dont appreciate what we can give them. 

We give our best. If people dont respect us or dont give us credit, then were not too concerned as long as we are successful. I dont think its envy. Its just the way of the football world. Everyone wants their team to be the best. We proved last year we were the best by winning the league and hope to prove that again this year. 

With a 15-point lead at the top of the Premiership, Chelseas second successive title is within their grasp, but Liverpool seem likely to run them closer in the coming seasons and Lampard is well aware of their growing threat. 

Liverpool have made big strides forward, he said. They had to for a club of their size to finish so low in the league. Theyve spent good money over the last year, got a good manager and an excellent squad. Theyve moved up to a level Arsenal and Man United have been for the last few seasons. If you ask their players, they were very happy to win the Champions League, but finishing outside the top four ? everyone knew they werent happy with that. 

After three straight draws, Chelsea have also had cause for disgruntlement of late and Lampard admits they will have to improve dramatically if they are to beat Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League later this month. 

Well probably have to go up a notch or two against Barcelona, he said. Theyre a fantastic team, playing great football and dominating the Spanish League, like we have done at home. Well need to be at our best to tackle a team of their abilities. Im sure we will be. 

People are talking about Barcelona, but not people in the dressing-room. Its in the back of everyones minds in a good way because its something we are all looking forward to.

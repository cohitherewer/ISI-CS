 Contracts between November 9-11

Ahmedabad: Indian squad for the forthcoming tour of South Africa will be selected on October 30 in Mohali. Selection of Indian team for its South Africa tour will be done in Mohali on October 30, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

He also informed that the new contracts for the players will be decided in a Board meeting between November 9 and 11. Chairman of selectors (Dilip Vengsarkar), coach (Greg Chappell) and myself have to get together for this. We will first grade the cricketers and then offer contracts, Shah said. 

When asked about BCCI contemplating putting up a permanent anti-doping policy for national cricketers, Shah said there is no need of that right now. (PTI)

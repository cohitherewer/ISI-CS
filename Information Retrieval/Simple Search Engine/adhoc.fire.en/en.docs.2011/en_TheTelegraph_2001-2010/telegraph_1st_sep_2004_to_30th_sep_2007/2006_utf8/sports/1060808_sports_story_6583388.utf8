 Mahindra mull shifting base to Goa

Mumbai: Mahindra United have issued a veiled threat to the Western India Football Association (WIFA) that unless the association improves the facilities at the Cooperage ground to international standards, the club would shift base to Goa. 

I met the Goa chief minister Pratap Singh Rane recently, to talk about taking over the Campal ground in Panaji. I also spoke with WIFA officials and AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi about Cooperages poor state, Mahindra president Alan Durante said at a press conference on Monday. 

We want the Cooperage to be revamped and made fit for hosting international tournaments. At present the quality of its stands and the players changing rooms is poor, said Durante. 

The company vice chairman said: We will move to a centre which is more hospitable. I would like to put pressure on WIFA officials, he said. (PTI)

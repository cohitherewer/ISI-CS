 Even par start by Atwal

Honolulu: Arjun Atwal started off the new season with an even par 70 while Shiv Kapur made a rather subdued debut to US PGA Tour with a three-over 73 in the $5.1 million Hawaii Sony Open Golf Tournament in blustery conditions at the Waialae Country Club here. 

Atwal, who seemed to be cruising well at two-under and inside top-15, went to the left rough and was forced to take a penalty drop and then added to his woes by three-putting from just past 25 feet for a double bogey that brought him back to par for the day and in the tied 33rd place. 

Kapur, who played his round in the afternoon, when the wind was up and strong, started with a bogey on the tenth, but seemed to have recovered with birdies on 12th and 14th. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inzy advised complete rest for 48 hours 

 - Malik leaves for Sialkot as father is seriously ill 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Faisalabad: Inzamam-ul Haq, who has been advised 

complete rest for 48 hours, was in considerable discomfort till rather 

late on Sunday ? a day when he completed yet another Test hundred (his 25th). 

That the Pakistan captains back was painful 

became evident when he spoke to The Telegraph at the Serena Hotel, shortly 

after an extended session with physio Darryn Lifson. 

Clutching the troubled area as he got up from a well-cushioned chair, Inzamam said: Complete rest for two days means I cant field during this (second) Test. However, if my services are required, Ill again bat... 

For now, the captaincy is with Younis Khan. In fact, after a late night development, theres uncertainty over allrounder Shoaib Maliks participation in the remainder of the Test, too. Maliks father is seriously ill in Sialkot and he left around 10.45 pm. 

Malik took one of the vehicles from the car rental (at the hotel), but wont reach Sialkot till about 2.45 am... We arent sure when hes going to return, a source pointed out. 

Meanwhile, the report wasnt available, but its confirmed Inzamam had an MRI during the day. Apparently, he has a bulging disc problem. One isnt sure whether theres a link, but the somewhat unprecedented cold wave in Punjab seems to have made it worse. 

Unbeaten on 79 on the opening day (Saturday), Inzamam didnt resume till after two wickets had fallen. Even when he did, a runner was needed. Of course, one of the tallest batsmen of the present era couldnt be denied a hattrick of hundreds at the Iqbal Stadium. 

Its possible, though, that the 40 runs Inzamam added to reach 119 (251 minutes, 193 balls, 12x4) aggravated the troubled area. But, then, he couldnt have been in the dressing room when the game plan was to bat just once. Pakistan totalled 588 with No. 9 Shoaib Akhtar contributing a spicy 47 off 54 deliveries (5x4, 3x6). 

The Indians have replied firmly ? 110 for the loss of Virender Sehwag, who couldnt capitalise on a let-off from substitute Imran Farhat. Under pressure for not being able to restrict Pakistan even with five specialist bowlers, Rahul Dravid is on 46. With him is V.V.S. Laxman. 

Earlier, despite Inzamams courageous effort, the cynosure was Shahid Afridi, who clobbered a career-best 156 from only 128 balls (205 minutes, 20x4, 6x6). The one-time enfant terrible of Pakistan cricket is making the Indians pay a terrible price. 

Afridi has lots of time. Plenty of flair as well. And, unlike contemporaries who take guard in full battle gear (arm-guard, chest protector, outer thigh pad), Afridi is content with the helmet. Obviously, he trusts his quick eye. 

Incidentally, the stadium was packed to capacity and there were thousands outside who rushed towards the gates each time there was a roar after an Afridi strike. Taken aback, the police made a series of lathicharges. That continued till Afridi got out, to Anil Kumble. 

Speaking exclusively, Afridi maintained he wasnt aware of the police action. Nobody told me a thing... Its nice that people see me as a crowd-puller... I suppose Ive been one for some years... 

Asked (at an interaction with the Media) whether hed changed his style, Afridi replied: No... Ive always been positive... However, cricket is changing... My intention is to keep the scoreboard ticking... At times, woh jaldi chalne lagta hai! 

Afridi accepted that the body-language 

in Indo-Pak face-offs was different. Theres definitely a difference 

and it feels good to perform against India... With scores of 103 and 156, 

in the ongoing series, he has done just that.

 Cannavaro in shortlist

 - FIFA Player of Year

Zurich: Italian World Cup-winning skipper Fabio Cannavaro, Brazilian Ronaldinho and French idol Zinedine Zidane have been shortlisted for the prestigious Fifa World Player of the Year award. 

The winner will be announced at a gala ceremony here on December 18. Fifa initially drew up a shortlist of 30 players which was whittled down to the final trio. 

Ronaldinho won the award last year and was a major influence in Barcelonas drive to win the Champions League. He failed to hit top form for Brazil during the World Cup, however. 

Cannavaro has already won the European Footballer of the Year award for his great defensive display for Italy at the World Cup. 

Zidane returned from international retirement to inspire France into the World Cup final during which he was sent off for head-butting Italian defender Marco Materazzi shortly before the end of regulation time. 

The womens shortlist for player of the year consists of Brazilian phenomenon Marta, indestructible American Kristine Lilly and German playmaker Renate Lingor. 

The Fifa end-of-year gala will also award prizes to the three top players at the World Cup (Zidane, Cannavaro and Andreo Pirlo), the competitions three top scorers (Miroslav Klose, Hernan Crespo and Ronaldo) and the top goalkeeper (Gianluigi Buffon).

 Jeev shares 24th spot

 JAPAN GOLF 

 Jeev Milkha 

 Ibaraki: Jeev Milkha Singh 

 fired a bogey-free three-under 68 to climb 35 places up 

 the leaderboard into tied 24th place at the midway stage 

 of the 120 million yen ACOM International at the Ishioka 

 Golf Club.

 Jeevs round, which had three 

 birdies and no bogeys, helped him rise up from tied 59th 

 place overnight.

 Overnight leader Mamo Osanai ran 

 away from the field with an awesome round of eight-under 

 63 that stretched his sole lead to five shots over Yoichi 

 Shimizu, who also shot a 63.

 Prayad Marksaeng shot a second 

 straight 67 and moved to third at eight-under 134 for 36 

 holes.

 Neither Osanai Nor Shimizu dropped 

 a shot as they had flawless rounds with eight birdies each. 

 Makrksaeng had five birdies and one bogey.

 Jeev birdied the second, 16th 

 and 17th and had no bogeys.

 I putted far better, but 

 wish a few more single putts had fallen after getting onto 

 the green well enough, said Jeev, who is now 16th 

 on money list on Japan Tour. (PTI)

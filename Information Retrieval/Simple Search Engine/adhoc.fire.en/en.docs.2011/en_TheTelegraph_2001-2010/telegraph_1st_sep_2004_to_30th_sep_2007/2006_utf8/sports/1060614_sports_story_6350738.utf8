 Referee too fussy, says Domenech

Stuttgart: France coach Raymond Domenech criticised a fussy referee after watching his side fail to break their eight-year World Cup goal drought against Switzerland on Tuesday in a 0-0 draw in Group G. 

The 1998 champions have now not scored since beating Brazil in the final in Paris, having failed to hit the net once in going out in the first round in 2002. 

I found the referee rather fussy (eight yellow cards). I did not always understand his decisions. Thats new refereeing, Im told. We have to live with it, Domenech told French television. 

Its a draw that had its good moments but we were not able to take the edge. We knew it wouldnt be easy but there are matches left. We deprived our main rivals of two points. 

Swiss coach Koebi Kuhn was happy simply with the one point his team did take away despite missing the three best chances of the game. 

France were able to dictate the game and we made mistakes so we have to be happy with sharing the points. We wont be leaving Stuttgart with our heads hanging low, he told reporters. 

South Korea lead the group after beating Togo 2-1 earlier on Tuesday.

 CM wants Chappell removed

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Siliguri: Chief minister Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjee wants Greg Chappell removed as India coach. 

Echoing the sentiments of majority of Indian politicians, the chief minister said Chappell had made undesirable comments on MPs. 

He has made undesirable comments and, in fact, teased the politicians. He should be removed from the coachs post immediately, the chief minister said during a two-day visit to north Bengal. 

Bhattacharjee said Chappells comment that MPs are paid to talk is provocative and insulting. 

How can he make such public comments against MPs, who represent the people? the chief minister questioned. 

No one in this country expects a statement like that from a person like Chappell. MPs and MLAs from all political parties have expressed their anguish and protested. 

On the possibility of Sourav Ganguly making a comeback to the Indian squad, the chief minister said: This is in no way related to the Chappell issue. 

I am an ardent fan of Sourav, and am confident he will soon find a berth in the Indian team on merit. 

The MPs had fired the first salvo after Indias 157-run defeat in the opening one-dayer in Durban on Wednesday. 

 It prompted Union minister and BCCI president Sharad 

 Pawar to overrule an informal administrative decision and 

 send chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar to South Africa.

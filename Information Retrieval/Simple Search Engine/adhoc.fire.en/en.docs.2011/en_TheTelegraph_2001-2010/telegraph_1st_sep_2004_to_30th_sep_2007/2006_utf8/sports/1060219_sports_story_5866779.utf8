 Kalmadi resigns as AFI chief 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: In a surprise move, Suresh Kalmadi on Saturday announced his resignation as president of the Athletics Federation of India (AFI). While Kalmadi said he was doing it to devote more time to Asian Athletics Association and 2010 Commonwealth Games, insiders feel there are more than it meets the eye. 

When asked, Kalmadi said: I was too overburdened. Other than being the chairman of the Commonwealth Games, I am also the president of the Asian Athletics Association (AAA) and IOA. So I have relinquished this post. 

Kalmadi announced his decision to step down during the AAA council meeting here. AFI sources said Kalmadi may be persuaded to stay on during the executive meeting of the AFI on February 26. 

There is another story making rounds that Kalmadi wanted to distance himself after Indian athletes being hounded by WADA for the past few months. With the Commonwealth Games round the corner and Asian Grand Prix scheduled in Kalmadis hometown Pune in May, the resignation has certainly come at a wrong time.

Calcutta: After drawing blanks in their first two games, Mohammedan Sporting were desperately in search of a sniper, and their prayers were answered by a man who landed in the city last Friday. 

Mike Okoro, back from Poland and in his debut match as captain for Mohammedan Sporting, netted a brace and inspired the black-and-white brigade to a level of football not frequently seen on the Maidan. 

Largely owing to him and the veteran Raman Vijayan, Mohammedan Sporting defeated Eastern Railway 2-0 in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match at the Barasat Stadium on Sunday. 

Truth to tell, the match kicked-off to a rather boring start with Eastern Railway showing no pluck or desire. It took a goal in the 14th minute for the tie to suddenly gain momentum. 

The promising Mir Farooq Haider collected the ball near the left flank and forwarded a neat lob to Okoro in the penalty box. Intercepting it on his chest, the Nigerian placed it with ultimate ease past a diving Tapan Karmakar in left post. 

If it was Okoros day, it was no less a revelation to see Vijayan, who played for 74 minutes and kept up the tempo, take the amount of workload that he did. 

 With Bijen Singh and Okoro, Vijayan unzipped the Railway defence with deft touches on a number of occasions. 

In the 65th minute, one such Vijayan move up left flank released Bijen in the clear. The Manipuri, with only the goalkeeper to beat, failed to get it past. 

Three minutes later, Vijayan cleverly busted an off-side trap and lobbed the ball over Karmakars head. Jamir Ali Mondal got an open net and a lone defender to beat. Inexplicably, he failed to even take a shy at the goal. 

In the 78th minute, Okoro collected the ball from midfield, dodged past two defenders in the left flank and off 25 yards, unleashed a lethal right-footer that sailed into the right post to make it 2-0. 

With this victory, the black-and-whites have garnered five points from three matches and Eastern Railway have collected six points from five outings.

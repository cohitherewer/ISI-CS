 Jora sets national record

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 FED CUP ATHLETICS

 New Delhi: Jora Singh was 

 grinning from ear to ear. The Haryana boy could not believe 

 his luck after setting a national record in decathlon in 

 the Federation Cup Athletics meet at the Nehru Stadium here 

 on Thursday. 

 Bengals Pinki Pramanik made 

 the finals of the 400m. She clocked 54:18 in the semis. 

 The record could have been Kulwinders. 

 Even P.J. Vinod had a chance to grab it. But both got injured 

 and it cleared the deck for Jora, who scored 7502 points 

 in the end.

 Kulwinder Singh held the existing 

 record of 7325 points, which he did at Chennai in August 

 last year. But here, he was forced to drop out after three 

 events on Wednesday. 

 Vinod gave Jora a hot chase only 

 to suffer an ankle injury on his left knee during the pole 

 vault event. Vinod was visibly not at his best in javelin 

 and 1500m and had to remain content with the silver. He 

 scored 7382 points. Ram Niwas of Haryana, with 6997 points, 

 finished third. 

 Meanwhile, there were apprehensions 

 that people from World Anti Doping Agency (WADA), who were 

 in Patiala on Wednesday to test the weightlifters, will 

 be in the capital on Thursday. But there was no sign of 

 them. Some in the athletics circle, however, feel that two 

 doctors from WADA may show up on Friday when the 16 finals 

 are slated.

 It has been a dream season 

Kochi (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh won the Casio World Open golf tournament, his third title of the year on Sunday, to end his six-year title drought in Japan. 

It really has been a dream season, Jeev said after receiving his trophy at the par-72 Kochi Kuroshio Country Club. I played really solid. The weather was not good as it was raining and cold but I played nicely. I went out there and birdied the first hole and putted well the whole round, he said. 

This is my first win in Japan. Ive been close a few times. Ive now won on three different tours this season, it cant get any better than this. God has been good to me. Its been a perfect year, Jeev said. 

David (Smail) also played rock solid, it was an excellent match. Im not sure where Ill be when the rankings come out on Monday but hopefully, itll be good enough for me to get into the top-50, said the Indian. 

Hopefully I will get into the Masters, which is the first major of 2007. No Indian has played in it and it will also mean a lot to Indian golf, Jeev said. Playing the majors has always been my goal and hopefully I can carry my form next year, said the golfer who has been bothered by a wrist injury. 

Then I will take a break and give my wrist a rest and get ready for 2007, said Jeev. 

Winning in Japan after a long time gives me a great feeling of satisfaction. I have played here in Japan for six years and my caddie is Japanese. I like the conditions and the place and I badly wanted to win here, said Jeev, who becomes only the second Indian after Jyoti Randhawa to win in Japan. Randhawa won the 2003 Suntory Open. 

 Winning and getting into top-50 of the world were two of my goals and I think I am pretty close there, said Jeev.

 Rana ends 26th, Jung 33rd

 Zagreb: After the initial glory, good results dried up for India as veteran Jaspal Rana and Vijay Kumar ended up 26th and 27th, respectively, with an identical score of 577 in the centre fire pistol at the World Shooting Championships. 

Rana fired 288 in precision and 289 in rapid while Kumar returned cards of 287 and 290 in the two categories. 

Samresh Jung finished further behind on 33rd with a score of 575 (290+285) in the event which is turning out to be a disappointing one for the Indian pistol shooters. 

Yadong Liu of China won the gold medal with a score of 587 (294+293) and Mikhail Nestruev of Russia pipped Michael Hofmann of Switzerland by just one point in the shoot-out after the two marksmen were tied at 585.

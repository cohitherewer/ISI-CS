 Warne keeps retirement option open

Melbourne: Shane Warne cannot think of a better farewell for himself if Australia win the Ashes this summer. 

Its going to be a question thats asked a lot through the summer. Is this your last series in Australia? Is this your last Ashes series? Warne was quoted as saying in a daily. 

I havent thought, if we win, I am retiring. If we lose, I am going to keep playing. But, who knows. Say I take another 40 wickets this series and score 250 runs, and we win the series, then there mightnt be a better way to go out, the 37-year-old said. 

Warne, however, said he would not officially announce his retirement beforehand to be given a farewell at every ground. 

Meanwhile, Australias cricketers are opposed to a Pakistan proposal to abolish the laws on ball tampering. I dont agree we should scrap the rule, Glenn McGrath said. Adam Gilchrist also voiced his support for McGrath. (agencies)

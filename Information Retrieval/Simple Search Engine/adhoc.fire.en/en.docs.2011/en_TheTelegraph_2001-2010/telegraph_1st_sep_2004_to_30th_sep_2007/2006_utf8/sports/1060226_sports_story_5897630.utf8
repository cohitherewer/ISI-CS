 Shoaib leaves for Melbourne

Islamabad: Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar, suffering from a career-threatening knee injury, left for Melbourne on Saturday for medical treatment. A PCB official has indicated that Shoaib would be out of action for at least 2-3 months for rest and rehabilitation. 

Meanwhile, the PCB has dismissed as non-issue the controversy over the leave given to coach Bob Woolmer and some of his support staff, saying their short absence was not hampering the cricketers in any way. (PTI)

Chittagong: Jason Gillespie, Stuart MacGill and Shane Warne took three wickets apeice to bundle Bangladesh out for 197 on the opening day of the second Test on Sunday. 

Gillespie snared three wickets for 11 runs before spinners MacGill (three for 68) and Shane Warne (three for 47) went to work to put Australia in the driving seat. 

Debutante spinner Dan Cullen also took his maiden Test wicket, that of hard hitter Mashrafe Mortaza (four) who was caught behind by Adam Gilchrist. 

Bangladesh, who opted to bat, lost their first wicket without a run on the board when first-Test centurion Shahriar Nafees was caught at square-leg by Brett Lee off Gillespie for a duck. Skipper Habibul Bashar was then superbly caught at point by a tumbling Phil Jaques off Gillespie, who also trapped opener Javed Omar (two) lbw. 

Warne, who had been expected to sit out the game due to a shoulder problem, snapped up the wicket of Mohammad Ashraful (six) who sent a catch to Matthew Hayden at slip. 

Rajin Saleh added 71 runs before being bowled by MacGill, who also removed Mohammad Rafique (19) caught by Matthew Hayden. 

Warne took the wicket of Aftab Ahmed (18) when Adam Gilchrist caught him behind. 

Warne took two wickets for 44 and MacGill had two for 53.

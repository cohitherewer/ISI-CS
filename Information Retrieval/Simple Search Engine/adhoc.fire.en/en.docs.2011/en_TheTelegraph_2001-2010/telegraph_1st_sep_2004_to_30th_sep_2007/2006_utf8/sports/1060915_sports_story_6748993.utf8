The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Federer destined 

 to be the greatest ever

 Roger Federer marches on. Last 

 Sunday, he won his third consecutive US Open at Flushing 

 Meadows, brushing aside a spirited challenge by a rejuvenated 

 Andy Roddick. 

 With a tally of nine Grand Slams 

 Federer is just one major title away from the great Bill 

 Tilden, who has 10. He needs five more titles to range alongside 

 Pete Sampras, who was won 14 Grand Slam titles. Enroute 

 Federer was to pass Borg and Laver at 11 each and Roy Emerson 

 with 12. 

 Federer is streaking away in the 

 tennis firmament leaving an indelible vapour train in tennis 

 history. Barring mishaps, he seems to be destined to be 

 the greatest ever. Federer dominated the fortnight with 

 his regal bearing and dazzling array of shots. He left in 

 his wake a trail of humbled challengers, shaking their heads 

 in disbelief. 

 A couple of wobbles, one against 

 James Blake in the quarters and then in the final against 

 Roddick briefly challenged his omnipotent image. Such is 

 Federers dominance that Roddick who has lost 11 of 

 his 12 encounters against him said, I just want to 

 keep doing it. If I lose to him in 8 Grand Slam finals, 

 thats fine. You throw enough against the wall, somethings 

 going to stick one of these times!. 

 Roddicks statement reflects 

 the frustration levels at the top echelons of the game.

 The ebullient muscular 20-year-old 

 Spaniard Nadal is the lone challenger, having beaten Federer 

 four times. He is the Swiss only credible threat. 

 Nadals loss in the quarters to the unseeded, smooth 

 stroking Russian Mikhail Youzhny becalmed the second week 

 of the Championships. 

 The first week of the Championships 

 was stolen by Andre Agassi. His dramatic second round encounter 

 with Marcos Baghdatis was one of the best matches of the 

 tournament. Walking to his car after winning the match, 

 Agassi cramped up totally and had to lie down on the pavement. 

 The incident built a gladiatorial aura around Agassi, which 

 New Yorkers loved. 

 When Andre Agassi came back for 

 his next match against the German qualifier Benjamin Becker, 

 the crowd was really charged up. Every Agassi shot was acclaimed 

 with frenetic applause. Bravely, with his painful crumbling 

 back and worn-out limbs, Agassi fought and gave his all, 

 but it was not enough. 

 Agassis 20 year long saga 

 was over. Time had given him the thumbs down. 

 A standing ovation for more than 10 minutes reduced everybody 

 to tears. Blowing kisses and weeping, Agassi walked into 

 the New York night, after a brilliant emotional tribute 

 to the crowd. 

 The womens singles could 

 not match the drama of the mens event. The glamorous 

 6-foot-one Sharapova screamed her way to a second Grand 

 Slam title. Dressed in a short black dress with shimmering 

 sequins, a gold chain round her neck and dangling earrings, 

 she seemed to be dressed for a cocktail party, rather than 

 a Grand Slam final. She defeated Mauresmo, the top seed, 

 in the semi-finals 6-0 in the final set and Henin-Hardenne, 

 the slight but very tough Belgian, in straight sets in the 

 final. 

 The star of the future in womens 

 tennis is Jankovic of Slovakia. She has an all-court game 

 and is tall, strong and athletic. A fluid mover, Jankovic 

 had Henin-Hardenne on the ropes in the semi-finals when 

 she led 4-2 in the second set after having won the first. 

 She was overcome by the occasion as the finals loomed in 

 sight, and her game collapsed.

 Leander Paes, at 33, won the mens 

 doubles title partnered by Martin Damm of the Czech Republic. 

 Since 1999 when he won the French Open with Mahesh Bhupathi, 

 Leander has won a total of seven Grand Slam mens doubles 

 and mixed doubles titles. 

 He was only 16 in 1989 when I 

 nominated him to play doubles in our Davis Cup tie against 

 Japan in Chandigarh. Even at that age he walked with the 

 swagger of a winner.

 His fighting spirit, reflexes 

 and unpredictable interceptions were unbelievable. But I 

 never imagined that he would become one of the greatest 

 doubles players in the world. In doubles reflexes and lightning 

 movement are paramount. His success at 33 is a tribute to 

 his hard work and years of Spartan discipline and single-minded 

 devotion. I have said it before but cant help saying 

 it again.

 Leander has done India proud and 

 even a gem-encrusted accolade is not enough for him. Well 

 done, Leander.

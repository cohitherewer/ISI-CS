Basseterre (St Kitts): Tuesdays India versus West Indies ODI isnt just a big moment for both in the five-match Digicel series, it means much for this twin island (other being Nevis) nation. And, so, Dr Denzil Douglas government has declared a national holiday. 

The narrow, winding roads (quite like Shillongs) leading to the refurbished Warner Park, therefore, will be packed with men and machines. Never before has St Kitts hosted a one-dayer, forget having staged something bigger. In a few weeks, the maiden Test is also to feature the same teams. 

The governments gesture is one way of saluting India and the West Indies, whore tied 1-1 after the high-voltage action in Kingston. Two ODIs are going to remain after the one here and the team making fewer unforced mistakes should lift the trophy. 

The West Indies did well to pull off a one-run win on Saturday, but coach Bennett King accepted it didnt make them champions. A stack of things has to be done... We did play some critical moments better, but we havent become champions... 

Complimenting Brian Lara for being the driving force with his leadership the other day, King said both teams were relying on a couple of key players to see them through. The first ODI, which India won on the penultimate ball, had been of immense education. 

Talking of Lara, he continued: He showed courage in the way he rotated bowlers... I like working with people who take risks and, as we move forward, he can be very handy for us... According to the coach, theres greater need for consistency as every component of the game gets highlighted more in ODIs. 

King maintained his players hadnt been lacking in confidence, in recent times, and added: Theyve lacked the experience of pulling it off from pressure situations. Counterpart Greg Chappell, by the way, must be hoping his boys get educated after going down on the third last ball. 

While the West Indies may not change the XI which won on Saturday, The Telegraph learns that the Indians are looking to play Sreesanth. If he does, Munaf Patel has to miss out. 

Sreesanth appears to have recovered from his left heel injury... However, lets see how he bowls at nets later today (early Tuesday back in India), a well-placed source informed on Monday morning. 

Any let-up in the fierceness with which this series has thus far been contested is unlikely. If anything, its only the weather which could put a damper on what promises to be another thriller. In Kings view, tall scores are on the cards.

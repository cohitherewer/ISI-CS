Paris: World Cup winners Italy and former European champions Holland suffered a double reality check as they took their first stuttering steps on the long road to Euro 2008. 

Italy had to come back from a goal down to draw 1-1 with unheralded Lithuania while the Dutch, European champions in 1988, scraped a 1-0 win at humble Luxembourg. 

In stark contrast, however, England, France, Germany and Spain kept the old guard in charge with winning starts to their campaigns. 

Italys top players have yet to begin their domestic league campaigns and their ring-rustiness showed in Naples as Roberto Donadonis side were held by a team ranked 65th in the world. 

The visitors even took a shock lead through Tomas Danilevicius in the 21st minute, before Filippo Inzaghi equalised for the Azzurri nine minutes later in the group B clash, for his 23rd international goal. 

Donadoni admitted that Italys lack of match sharpness was obvious. Its nothing more than this, he said. We created lots of chances and I thought we were very unlucky. 

Marco van Bastens Dutch were equally unimpressive in their group G match in tiny Luxembourg and needed a 17th minute goal from Hamburg defender Joris Mathijsen to secure the points. 

The Dutch were without injured Arjen Robben, Rafael Van Der Vaart and Wesley Sneider, the suspended Giovanni Van Bronckhorst and Khalid Boulahrouz while Van Basten had not selected mark Van Bommel and Ruud Van Nistelrooy. 

There were no such problems for Steve MacLarens England who enjoyed a comfortable 5-0 victory over hapless Andorra in group E. 

France, who face their World Cup conquerors Italy in Paris next week, warmed up for that mouthwatering group B encounter with a 3-0 stroll against Georgia in Tbilisi. 

Germany edged the Republic of Ireland 1-0 in group D in Stuttgart but needed a deflected free-kick from Lukas Podolski to secure victory. 

 In the same group, the Czech Republic 

 squeezed past Wales 2-1 in Prague.

 Indians need to bolster attack

Stump View 

Moin Khan

 More than the Pakistanis, the 

 second one-dayer is vital to the Indians and if they again 

 fail to win, it would become extremely tough for them to 

 recover in the series. The tourists must be satisfied with 

 their batting resources but their main concern remains the 

 bowling department. Even if the bowlers are given the benefit 

 of doubt keeping in view the conditions in Peshawar, the 

 bottomline is that the Indian bowling attack lacks the bite, 

 penetration, aggression and economy ? a combination that 

 is so vital in limited-overs cricket.

 I am sure Rahul Dravid must have 

 learnt from the Peshawar experience and would not repeat 

 the mistake of bowling out Irfan Pathan before the halfway 

 stage again in the series. Similarly, to bolster the weak 

 link in the team, it would not be a bad idea if the Indians 

 include a specialist bowler or a bowling allrounder.

 However, the million-dollar question 

 is whom that bowling allrounder would replace? I dont 

 have an answer but I really think India have become a bit 

 imbalanced after captaincy has changed hands. When Dravid 

 was keeping wickets, the Indians had the luxury of including 

 an additional allrounder or a specialist bowler. 

 But that advantage is gone as 

 Mahendra Singh Dhoni is keeping wickets while Dravid is 

 playing as a specialist batsman. And Dhoni has done wonders 

 in whatever cricket he has played.

 In one-day cricket, players are 

 basically picked on the policy of horses for courses. 

 In the 1999 World Cup, where we 

 reached the final, Waqar Younis played just one match while 

 the four-man pace attack revolved around Wasim Akram, Shoaib 

 Akhtar, Abdul Razzaq and Azhar Mahmood and Saqlain Mushtaq 

 and Shahid Afridi shouldered spin bowling responsibilities.

 And trust me, Waqar was still 

 one of the best in 1999. It was a tough decision but the 

 team management as well as Waqar had to swallow the bitter 

 pill in the better interest of the team and the country.

 No doubt the Indian batting looks 

 set and in form but the tourists must be hoping for Virender 

 Sehwag to fire so that they can revise their strategy of 

 promoting pinch-hitters. 

 Dhoni could get promotion as an 

 opener and there is always a cushion of pushing Pathan up 

 the order to utilise the power plays. But while doing that 

 so effectively, they ran out of heavy artillery for the 

 slog overs and consequently failed to make optimum use of 

 the last 10 or five overs.

 Outside cricket, India can also 

 draw the inspiration from Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium ? a 

 venue on which they completed their maiden Test series win 

 against Pakistan two years ago.

 The bad news for Pakistan is that 

 Shoaib Akhtar has been ruled out of the second one-dayer 

 while there are further question marks on his availability 

 for the third game.

 Nevertheless, the trademark of 

 this Pakistan team is that it is no more a one-man army 

 and this they have proven in the field rather than with 

 words. 

 While it is certainly a huge disadvantage 

 for the home team to go in the match without the premier 

 fast bowler, it is a good opportunity for either Umar Gul 

 or young Yasir Arafat to prove his mettle.

 If I were the captain, I would 

 persist with Gul but I think Arafat will replace Gul, chiefly 

 because he is a local boy besides being a good useful player 

 with both the bat and the ball.

 The match will further prove the 

 fitness of Inzamam-ul Haq. He batted in Peshawar to score 

 16 but to me, he looked in little discomfort. It can be 

 because the fear of recurrence of injury is still at the 

 back of his mind and he doesnt want to aggravate it.

 Whatever may be the case, Inzamam 

 looks indispensable at the moment, at least for another 

 year not only because he has been scoring heavily but he 

 is marshalling his troops well and has gelled this team 

 very nicely. I am sure that Inzamam has silenced his critics 

 who thought he had poor man management skills or lacked 

 cricket vision.

 Taking into account the last two 

 one-dayers played in Rawalpindi, I dont think it is 

 going to be a tall scoring game like the one we had in Peshawar. 

 Against England last year in December, the team that batted 

 first, won the game but not before it was left to defend 

 a small total of about 200 odd runs.

 Furthermore, the conditions in 

 Rawalpindi will not be the same as in Peshawar. Neither 

 the outfield will be lightening fast nor the boundaries 

 will be shorter. Therefore, the key will be sensible batting 

 so that the bowlers have some runs to bowl at. Whether batting 

 first or last, allotted overs need to be consumed.

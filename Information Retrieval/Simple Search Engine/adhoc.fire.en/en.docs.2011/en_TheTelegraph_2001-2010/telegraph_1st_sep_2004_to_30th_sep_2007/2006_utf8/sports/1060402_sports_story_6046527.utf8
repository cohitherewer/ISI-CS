The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sankar hopes to clear final hurdle 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Assisting Referees in World Cup

 Komaleeswaran Sankar

New Delhi: If everything 

 goes right at Frankfurt in the third week of April, Komaleeswaran 

 Sankar will once again be the only Indian representative 

 in the World Cup football in Germany. In 2002, he became 

 the first Indian referee to supervise in World Cup in Korea/Japan.

 The 42-year-old referee from Chennai 

 is among the four Asian referees, who have been shortlisted 

 to do duty for the worlds biggest sporting spectacle. 

 While two of them are referees from Japan (Toru Kamikawa) 

 and Singapore (Samsul Moidin), Sankar and Japans Hiroshima 

 have been selected to do the job of assistant referees.

 The final decision regarding which 

 assistant referees will be picked up for the World Cup will 

 be taken after a workshop for them in Frankfurt from April 

 18-21.

 In Frankfurt, I will have 

 to undergo rigorous fitness test before I receive the final 

 nod to do duty in the World Cup for the second time in my 

 career, Sankar told The Telegraph from Chennai. 

 I am naturally very excited about it. The experience 

 I had had four years ago was simply fantastic, he 

 said.

 Sankar has already started preparing 

 himself for the big test, even asking the All India Football 

 Federation to exempt him from National Football League duty. 

 Ive got a personal trainer who will take care 

 of the fitness aspect, said Sankar. 

 Sankar has been an assistant referee 

 in the 1996 Junior World Cup, the 1997 Youth World Cup, 

 the 1999 Confederation Cup and the Sydney Olympics in 2000. 

 He also won the Asias Best Assistant Referee award 

 in 1999. 

 In Frankfurt, there will be three 

 assistants for each referee at this workshop and at least 

 two of the trio will have to complete a series of tests 

 successfully. 

 If they fail to do so, the entire 

 triumvirate will be excluded from the list of World Cup 

 officials and replaced by another quartet.

 Germany 2006 will be the first 

 World Cup to feature only refereeing triumvirate from the 

 same country, or at least from the same confederation.

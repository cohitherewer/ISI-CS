The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Important to make the most of form 

 - Yuvraj Singh down with severe cold 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Yuvraj Singh 

Mumbai: Thats because I dont get to score many hundreds! was Yuvraj Singhs response when asked what made him so demonstrative after reaching three-figures in Mondays ODI against England in Margao. 

With five hundreds in the shorter version (not to forget 122 in the Karachi Test) this season, he definitely wasnt being serious. 

Actually, Id been upset with a string of low scores after the tour of Pakistan... Yesterdays hundred, therefore, gave more satisfaction... Thats why, perhaps, I got more emotional and excited, Yuvraj told The Telegraph. 

Contacted at the team hotel (Taj Malabar) in Kochi, on Tuesday evening, he added: Its important to make the most of form and, frankly, I should have done better in the three Test innings (versus England) and in the first two ODIs... 

Yuvraj, MoS in the ODIs in Pakistan, missed the first Test (Nagpur) owing to a hamstring injury. In Mohali, he scored 15 and, in the final Test (Mumbai), got 37 and 12 only. In the first two ODIs, he had 1 (New Delhi) and 18 (Faridabad). 

Incidentally, Margaos MoM is down with a severe cold and a bit of cough ? apparently, after-effects of an outing on the beach the other day. The fourth ODI, in Kochi, is on Thursday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Expectations sky high from shooters

 - Coach rues Abhinav Bindras absence 

JAYDEEP BASU

Doha: In 1994, a youngster from Garhwal, who answers to the call of Jaspal Rana, was the biggest surprise of the Asian Games. Never in the reckoning in shooting events before, India bagged their first ever gold in this sport when Rana created a continental record in centre fire pistol. 

Since then, the game has come of age in India. Though India could never win another gold medal in the Asian Games after Ranas spectacular show, Indian shooters have brought a host of medals from international meets, which included two world championships gold medals. 

On Saturday when the shooting events begin at the Lusaill shooting range here, India would be looking forward to make their biggest gold haul in the Asian Games ever. So much so, that the Indian chief coach Sunny Thomas said that he was confident to grab more than one medal on the opening day. 

Tomorrow will be a big day and four medals are up for grabs, said Thomas. My biggest problem is the injury to Abhinav Bindra. After all, he is the world champion. We would have been much stronger with him. 

Thomas said that in the 10-metre air rifle event, India are well placed since Gagan Narang, who recently won the World Cup gold in China with 700.2 points, is in tremendous form. Junior world champion Navnath Fartade and PT Raghunath are also there to bolster the team. 

The biggest challenge to India should be coming from China and Korea, but the presence of Fartade and Narang has given India a face lift. While Narang is one of the most respected shooters in this event all over the world, Fartades biggest advantage is his fighting quality. He will never give it up without a fight, said Thomas. 

In the womens front, India is a formidable side with Tejaswani Sawant, Shima Sirur and Avneet Kaur all being in fine form in the 10-metre event. 

 But then, several times in the past, the Indians have flattered to deceive. One has to keep the fingers crossed till the shooters really live up to the billing.

 Id have done what Inzy did: Hussain

 - I have nothing to say, declares Darrell Hair 

 Nasser Hussain 

London: Former England captain Nasser Hussain said he sympathised with Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq for refusing to play in the fourth Test after the tourists were accused of ball tampering at The Oval. 

Umpire Darrell Hair, the man at the centre of the controversy, said on Monday: I have nothing to say. 

And while the veteran Australian official maintained his silence and with it any evidence of wrongdoing, Hussain wrote in a local daily: Did Darrell Hair actually see a member of the Pakistan team tampering with a cricket ball? Has he got proof? 

If he hasnt, then he has made a massive mistake, Hussain added: If we had been accused of cheating in this way then, as long as I was sure of our innocence, I would have done exactly the same thing as Pakistan. 

I wouldnt have come out after tea, either. People have said that Pakistan should have waited until the close of play and then gone down the right channels, but they wouldnt have seen it that way. 

To Pakistan, if they had carried on playing, they would have been admitting their guilt. 

Former England captain Mike Gatting said that the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global governing body, had erred in selecting Hair for Test matches involving Pakistan. 

Perhaps the ICC may have been more understanding. It might have been they had the wrong man with Hair there. 

Former Test umpire Dickie Bird said he would have done everything possible to keep the match going. 

I think they should have finished the Test match, Bird said. Pakistan have been badly hurt (by the accusations) but the people who have to suffer are the fans. 

After the match, you all get round the table and thrash this out. 

Meanwhile, the Indian cricket fraternity was divided in its opinion on the issue. 

Former captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth, without taking anyones side, said Pakistan should have come to the field and protested later rather than objecting to the umpires decision by not coming to the field of play. 

What the umpires have done is also wrong. It is a shame that everybody is taking law into their own hands, Srikkanth said. 

Ajit Wadekar, who led India to historic wins against England and the West Indies in 1971, said history repeats itself, indicating at past incidences of Pakistani bowlers being caught in ball tampering controversies. 

Wadekar said the root of the controversy lied in Pakistan not coming to play after the tea break. 

But Pakistan were in the wrong by refusing to come out after the tea interval and play. They should have, instead, played under protest. 

Ex-Test umpire Piloo Reporter said the umpires could have shown some flexibility, though he said he did not fully support Pakistans stance. 

From what I have gathered from newspaper reports, as I did not watch the proceedings, there seems to have been a communication gap between the umpires and the Pakistan team management, Reporter said. (AGENCIES)

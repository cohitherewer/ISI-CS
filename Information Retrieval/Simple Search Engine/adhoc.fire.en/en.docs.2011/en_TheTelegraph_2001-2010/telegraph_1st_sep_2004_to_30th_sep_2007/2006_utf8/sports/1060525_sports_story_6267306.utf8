 Anand leads from front

 Chess Olympiad

 Anand 

 Turin: World No. 2 Viswanathan 

 Anand led from the front to guide second seeds India to 

 a 4-0 rout over Mongolia in the third round of the 37th 

 Chess Olympiad here.

 The Indian eves also came up with 

 an inspired performance to beat Croatia 2.5-0.5 in Round 

 3. The highlight was Mary Ann Gomes win on debut.

 Anand, who arrived from Sofia 

 the night before, shrugged off his fatigue to play and put 

 the Indians back in medal contention. Russia, China and 

 Uzbekistan emerged joint leaders with 10.5 points each, 

 while Greece, Ukraine and Poland are joint fourth (10 each).

 There is a bunch of six teams 

 on 9.5 points. The Indian men, thanks to back-to-back 4-0 

 triumphs, are in joint 13th spot (9 points) with 10 rounds 

 remaining.

 Anand started against Batchuluun 

 Cegmed with a 500 rating point advantage and white pieces. 

 The Indian ace won a piece in the middle game with some 

 fine tactical play and carved out a win in 34 moves.

 On the second board, Gundavaa 

 Bayarsaihan proved no match for Krishnan Sasikiran despite 

 playing white as the Indian improved his position consistently 

 in the middlegame.

 Former world junior champion P. 

 Harikrishna also emerged a comfortable winner against Bayarmandah 

 Balgan, three-time national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly 

 made the technicalities of an endgame look easy against 

 Mongolian No. 1, GM Bazar Hatanbaatar.

 Russia dropped 1.5 points against 

 Germany. Vladimir Kramnik took board I for the Russians 

 for the first time here and made his presence count with 

 a sparkling victory over Arkadij Naiditsch.

 Alexander Morozevich drew with 

 veteran Artur Jussopow on the second board while on the 

 third Evgeny Bareev accounted for Christopher Lutz. The 

 shocker for Russia came on board IV when Sergei Rublevsky 

 went down to Alexander Graf.

 For the Indian eves, it was an 

 excellent result following the second-round draw with Venezuela. 

 It propelled them to ninth spot.

 Lithuania emerged as the early 

 sole leader following their third straight 3-0 win, the 

 latest victims being Latvia. China and Russia share the 

 second spot with 8.5 points each, while Ukraine and Romania 

 were in close pursuit (8 each).

 Koneru Humpy yet again displayed 

 fine form to cruise past Mirjana Medic of Croatia. It was 

 a queen pawn game in which Humpy had to use her positional 

 expertise to notch up full points.

 Swati Ghate was rested and Mary 

 Ann took the opportunity with both hands by crushing Vlasta 

 Macek on the third board.

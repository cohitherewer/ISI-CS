 Murali will bounce back, says Moody

 - TRI-SERIES THIRD FINAL

Brisbane: Sri Lankan coach Tom Moody believes Muttiah Muralidharan will bounce back from the worst 10-over spell in limited-overs cricket history in the deciding triangular one-day series final on Tuesday. 

The champion spinner endured one of his most miserable days ever, returning 99 for no wickets as Australia powered to its highest ODI score of 368 for five and a 167-run win in the second tri-final in Sydney on Sunday. 

Muralidharan also had to contend with a majority of the Australian crowd taunting him over his much-scrutinised bowling action, with calls of chucker and no ball every time he approached the bowling crease. 

Moody is confident his beleaguered star will strike back in the third and deciding match of the series at the Gabba ? only the first time since 1994 that the Australian tri-series has required a third final. 

Hes obviously disappointed, Moody said on Sunday. Hes a world-class performer and he likes to perform at his best all the time. 

This hasnt happened that often in his career. 

The opposition got the better of him, but knowing the character and the quality of the person and the bowler, hell bounce back. 

Lankans must turn around a significant momentum shift after centuries from Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds (151 off 127 balls) saw the Australians through. (AFP)

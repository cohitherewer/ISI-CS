Ranchi: Mahendra Singh Dhoni said on Thursday that Team Indias successful stint in the West Indies will stand them in good stead during the 2007 World Cup. 

The wicket in the West Indies was tough but we have learnt a lot. We hope to utilise this experience for the upcoming World Cup, the dashing wicketkeeper batsman said here at the airport on his return home after a gruelling tour. 

Dhoni felt that the upcoming tri-series in Sri Lanka would be a challenging one, but was confident of a good show. 

We are looking forward to the Sri Lanka tour which is going to be a tough one. We all are determined and focused to do well. Pitches in Lanka are slow but we have started preparing for that, he said. 

The swashbuckling batsman felt had luck been on Indias side, the winning margin in the Test series would have been bigger. 

We would have done better if luck had been on our side. Yet we played well and it was a great achievement to win a series there. We had taken nine wickets and it was just bad luck that we could not take the last one to win that third Test.

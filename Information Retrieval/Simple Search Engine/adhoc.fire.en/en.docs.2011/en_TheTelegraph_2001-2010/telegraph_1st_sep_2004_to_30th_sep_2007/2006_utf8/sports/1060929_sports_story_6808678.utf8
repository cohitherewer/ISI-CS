 Chowrasia, Gangjee in top two spots

Taipei: Rookie SSP Chowrasia and Rahil Gangjee flew the tri-colour high on Thursday, occupying the top two spots at the end of the first round in the Mercuries Taiwan Masters. 

Chowrasia had a course-record equalling bogey-free eight-under-par 64, that gave him a two-shot lead over Rahil Gangjee and Australias Adam Blyth, who shot six-under 66 each. The-28-year-old Chowrasia knocked in eight birdies and had no bogeys in the first round. He equalled the course record at the Taiwan Golf and Country Club held by Chinese Taipeis Yuan Ching-Chi since 1994. 

Gangjee, after his third place finish in Korea last week, carded a 66 for joint second with Blyth. American Jason Knutzon was fourth after a 67, while Chung Chun-Hsing was in fifth, four strokes off the pace. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Patrick to play key role

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting, riding on a high after their two consecutive wins over Mohun Bagan and Salgaocar will take on Sporting Club de Goa in the National League on Tuesday. Patrick Okonjis presence has added a new dimension to the home team. 

Sporting have come a long way from their January 26 experience in the city last year when the bus they were travelling in turned turtle. That incident made us stronger as a team, recalled coach Clifford Chukuwama. The visitors will, however, miss the services of Joseph Pereira.

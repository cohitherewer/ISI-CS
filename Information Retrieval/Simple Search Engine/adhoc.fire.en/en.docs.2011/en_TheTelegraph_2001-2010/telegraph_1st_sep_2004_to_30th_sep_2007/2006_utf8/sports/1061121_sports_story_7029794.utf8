 Aruna storms into semis

 World Women's Boxing 

New Delhi: Asian silver medallist Aruna Mishra stormed into the semi-finals of 66kg category at the fourth World Womens Boxing Championships while Asian champion Aswathy Mol was made to bite the dust by a Pan-American champion in 70kg class here on Monday. 

Aruna ousted Yeliz Yesil of Turkey in the quarter finals 17-7 while Aswathys journey was cut short by the world No. 3 Ariane Fortin of Canada 4-21 in another last eight stage bout. 

In all, it was a good day for the hosts as they won three of their four bouts scheduled for Monday with L. Sarita Devi and Chhotu Laura advancing to the quarter finals of 52kg and 50kg divisions earlier in the day. 

Aruna, who had got a wake-up call on missing a medal in the recent Venus Cup in the build-up to the elite event, was determined not to repeat her mistakes in front of the home crowd. 

The hefty Haryana boxer did not leave much room for her Turkish opponent and garnered nine points conceding four in the first round. 

After gaining confidence, she was all around the ring in the second round pounding punches for points, increasing the gap to seven points. 

In the deciding round also, the Indian kept the control in her own hands romping home unscathed. (PTI)

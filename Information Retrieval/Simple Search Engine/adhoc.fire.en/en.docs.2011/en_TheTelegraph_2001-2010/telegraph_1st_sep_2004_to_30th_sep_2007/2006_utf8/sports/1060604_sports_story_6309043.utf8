 Gayle gives WI a headstart

 - First Test

 - Indians bowled out for 241 

 Chris Gayle in action on Saturday 

St Johns: Chris Gayle waded into the hapless Indian attack as the West Indies began their reply to the visitors modest total on a strong note in the first Test here on Saturday. 

Gayle smashed an unbeaten 45 off 50 balls with seven fours and a six as the West Indies reached 81 for one at lunch on Day II at the Antigua Recreation Ground. 

 At tea, the West Indies were 182 for three. Ramnaresh 

 Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul were batting on 58 and 

 6, respectively. 

 Chris Gayle (72), Daren Ganga 

 (6) and Brian Lara (18) were the batsmen dismissed. Munaf 

 Patel picked up two wickets while Anil Kumble scalped one. 

Indias last-wicket pair of Sreesanth and Munaf Patel lasted less than five overs Sunday morning. Resuming at 235 for nine, India were all out when Fidel Edwards castled Patel. Sreesanth remained unbeaten on 29. 

Gayles savage assault on the inexperienced Indian attack meant that the deficit had already been reduced to 160. Ramnaresh Sarwan was the other unbeaten batsman (19) at lunch. Daren Ganga was the lone batsman to dismissed, leg-before to Patel. 

Both Patel and Sreesanth bowled good opening overs but thereafter were taken to the cleaners by Gayle. 

Sreesanths fourth over went for 14. Gayle hit a massive six which cleared the ground. A flustered Sreesanth then bowled short and wide, and was promptly punished for two more fours by the left-hander. 

Test debutant VRV Singh was hit for three fours in his first over by Sarwan but there were two close leg-before appeals against the right-hander. 

The West Indies reached their half-century in just over eight overs and the 50 stand for the second wicket came off only 39 balls. 

Gayle then hit a four each off Patel and Singh to move closer to his half-century. 

Sarwan was competent as ever at the other end, unbeaten on 19 from 25 balls with four fours. 

The lack of economy of Indian bowlers was evident from the figures as both Sreesanth and Patel went for over six an over in their spells. 

On Day I, a typically gritty knock by captain Rahul Dravid, who fell one short of a half-century and a useful eighth-wicket partnership between Sreesanth and Anil Kumble (21) lent the total some respectability. 

Virender Sehwag (36), V.V.S. Laxman (29) and Yuvraj Singh (23) failed to continue after getting in, and the lack of partnerships severely dented Dravids hopes of scoring a big total after choosing to bat on an unusually bouncy track. 

Lara said his team will seek to take a significant lead in the first innings to avoid the pitfall of batting last on a difficult track. 

We want to get in front in a big way in the first innings as we bat last, which wouldnt be easy on this track. 

The West Indies captain said losing the toss proved to be advantageous. It was a good toss to lose. After couple of balls took off, I thought we should let them get maximum of 200 runs. The eighth wicket stand between Kumble and Sreesanth was really good. They took the attack to us. But we still kept them under three runs after 90 overs.

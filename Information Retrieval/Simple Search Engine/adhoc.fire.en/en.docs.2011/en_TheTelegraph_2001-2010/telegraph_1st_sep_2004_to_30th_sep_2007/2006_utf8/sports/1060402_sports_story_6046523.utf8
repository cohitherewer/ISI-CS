 Pariyar brace in Indian triumph

New Delhi: India rode a brace by Vimal Pariyar to beat Afghanistan 2-0 in their first match of the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup in Chittagong on Saturday. 

India dominated the Group A encounter from the outset with Pariyars shot in the 19th minute hitting the woodwork. 

However, the opener was not long in coming. Bungo Thokchom Singh skirted two defenders in the 35th minute and supplied the ball to Pariyar, who had an easy tap-in. 

Afghanistan mounted some attacks in the second half but missed two easy chances. But Pariyar doubled the lead in the 60th minute on a pass from Xavier Vijay Kumar. 

Chinese Taipei and The Philippines are the other two teams in the group. 

The tournament features 16 Asian teams and is planned for every two years.

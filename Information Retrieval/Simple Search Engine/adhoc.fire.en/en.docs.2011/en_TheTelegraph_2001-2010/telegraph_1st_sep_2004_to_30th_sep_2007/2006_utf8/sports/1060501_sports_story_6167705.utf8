 Jeev ends joint 10th

 Japan golf

 Nagoya: Indias Jeev 

 Milkha Singh dropped three crucial shots on the back nine 

 to drop out of top-three and finish tied 10th in the ?120 

 million International Crowns Golf tournament here on Sunday.

 Jeev, winner of the recent Volvo 

 China Open, a co-sanctioned event on the Asian Tour with 

 Europe, was placed tied fourth after three rounds at the 

 Nagoya Golf Clubs Wago course.

 He shot a final round of par 70 

 and ended at eight-under 272 for his 10th place, which he 

 shared with Toru Taniguchi (67).

 Shingo Katayama, leading finisher 

 on Japan Tours money list for last two years, opened 

 the season with a commanding win despite a sedate final 

 round of par 70 as he ended with a score of 18-under 262 

 for four rounds.

 Katayama took home ?24 million. 

 He was three ahead of Nozomi Kawahara (67), while Ryoken 

 Kawagishi (63) was third at a distant 11-under 269.

 Koreans Y. E. Yang (65) and S. 

 K. Ho (68), Englishman Nick Dougherty (68) and Thai Prayad 

 Marksaeng (69) were all tied at 10-under in fourth place.

 Japanese duo Tomohiro Kondo (66) 

 and Taichi Teshima (68) were tied eighth at nine-under. 

 Jeev had a decent start on the front nine with three birdies 

 on the second, fifth and sixth holes and a bogey on third 

 as he turned in two-under and at 10-under at that stage 

 he was a fair bet for top-five finish. (PTI)

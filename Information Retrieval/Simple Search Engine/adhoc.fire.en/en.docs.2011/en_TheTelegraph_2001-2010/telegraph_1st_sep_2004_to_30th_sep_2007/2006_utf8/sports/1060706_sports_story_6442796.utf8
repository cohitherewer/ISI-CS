 Del Piero: This is fantastic joy

Dortmund: Italys Alessandro Del Piero finally rewarded the faith shown in him by coach Marcello Lippi with his well-taken extra-time goal securing the Azzurris place in the World Cup final on Tuesday. 

Ive worked hard to keep myself ready, so that I could take my chance. This is a fantastic joy, Im delighted, Del Piero told reporters. 

There was more anger than happiness in my goal, for many reasons which are pointless to go into now, said Del Piero. 

With characteristic good timing, Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro will make his 100th appearance for his country in Sundays World Cup final. 

I knew this could be my last World Cup and asked my teammates to help me reach that target of 100 games. I have to say that they have delivered for me and in the best possible way, said 32-year-old Cannavaro. 

Cannavaro hardly put a foot wrong in Italys win, making a series of vital interceptions and clean challenges to keep out Germanys forwards. 

The really nice thing is that again it was players who came off the bench made the difference for us. 

Fabio Grosso, who was playing fourth division football only five years ago, was struggling to take in the fact that he had booked Italy into the World Cup final. 

It also marked an astonishing rise in the game for a player whose career started with four seasons in amateur football, until 1998, and continued with another three in Italys C2 fourth division with Chieti before ending up at Palermo. 

The left back, widely tipped to join Inter Milan, told reporters: When I saw it go in, it was such a big emotional rush ? and I was glad to share it with all my teammates. 

I cant find the words at the moment. Im very happy, as we all are. Were in the final. Its a dream, and bit by bit its coming true. Were all hoping now that we can see it right through to the end. 

Its a moment of great emotion and joy. We wanted to get to the final and we stood firm in a stadium which was a really tough place to play in and we were facing a really great side. 

Grossos goal capped a campaign which has been overshadowed by the scandal that has rocked Italian soccer and led to a state prosecutor on Tuesday calling for Juventus, AC Milan, Lazio and Fiorentina to be relegated from Serie A. 

We started this campaign with a thousand difficulties and now were having a great tournament, said 28-year-old Grosso. Weve reached an incredible finishing line. Were a great group of players and we deserve the satisfaction weve earned ourselves here. 

It was a great performance. We came close a number of times and defended in great style. Then, just when it looked as though it was heading for penalties, these two goals came along.

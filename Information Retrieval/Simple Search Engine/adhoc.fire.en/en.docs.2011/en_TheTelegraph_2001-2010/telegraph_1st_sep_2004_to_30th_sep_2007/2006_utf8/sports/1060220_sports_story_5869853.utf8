Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur produced a six-under 66 despite a finish hole bogey to ensure a good week at the Maybank Malaysian Open, ending up tied 18th in the tournament which was reduced to 54 holes because of persistent storm on the first three days. 

Another Indian, Gaurav Ghei (67), who was 43rd after 36 holes, joined him at the tied 18th place. Amandeep Johl and Jyoti Randhawa shot 69 each and were at seven-under 209 tied for 37th place. 

But up there on the top was Koreas Charlie Wi, who produced a stunning comeback in a nail-biting final day to win the $1.25 prize money tournament with a third and final round of nine-under-par 63. 

The 34-year-old Wi birdied his last hole at the Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club to dash Thongchai Jaidees dream of a historic third victory in Malaysia. The Korean signed off the tournament with a total of 19-under-par 197, one stroke better than Thongchai, who closed with a 66. 

Kapur had started his third round on the tenth on Saturday and birdied his first two holes. He played his last 12 holes on Sunday, and added a birdie on the 18th to turn in three-under. 

He birdied the third and in a row from fifth to seventh to rise inside top-15. But he was let down by a bogey on the ninth and dropped to tied 18th. 

Ghei, too started on the tenth and turned in a bogey-free three-under. On the second nine, he birdied the fifth, seventh and eighth, before he also dropped a shot on ninth for a 67 that saw him finish 10-under 206 for 18th place. 

Wi, who resumed the third and final round three shots off the lead on Sunday morning, walked away with a handsome cheque of $208,330 for his seventh Asian Tour victory. 

The win also shot him to the top of the UBS Order of Merit and made him the ninth player to surpass the $1 million mark in career earnings.

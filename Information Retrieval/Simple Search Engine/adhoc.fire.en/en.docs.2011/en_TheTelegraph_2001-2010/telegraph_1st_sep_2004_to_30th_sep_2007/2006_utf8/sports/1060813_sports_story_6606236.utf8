 Kapil: Nothing wrong with zonal selection

Coimbatore: Legendary allrounder Kapil Dev feels the selectors have done nothing wrong in selecting players on a zonal basis. 

Declining to comment any further on former Team India coach John Wrights book Indian Summers, Kapil, however, said, This (zonal selection) is what is been happening for the last 50 years. 

The selectors have done nothing wrong. If not, there would not be Gavaskars, Kumbles, Sachins or Pathans, Kapil said on Saturday. 

The World Cup-winning captain, here on a promotional visit, refused to comment on the general perception that politics played a part in selection. Not in my opinion. You (public) are saying that. 

On the selection of the Indian squad for tri-series in Colombo, Kapil said, Sri Lanka are a very, very tough side and going by their recent success against South Africa, they would be a tough opponent on their own soil. (PTI)

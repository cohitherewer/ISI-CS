 Aussies seek Akram tips on reverse swing

 - I did tell them the little details of this art, says ex-Pak captain 

 Lee and his teammates have spoken to Akram in Bangladesh 

Sydney: The Australians are looking for some subcontinental help in their bid to win back the Ashes. 

Pace spearhead Brett Lee, who was at the receiving end of Kevin Pietersens broad bat last summer when England wrested back the famous urn after 18 years, has approached former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram to learn the art of reverse swing. 

Lee, with teammates Nathan Bracken and Mitchell Johnson, took time out in Bangladesh to seek advice from Akram. 

Australia won both Tests, while the three-match ODI series gets underway in Chittagong on Sunday. 

Brett Lee is a sight to watch in world cricket. If any bowler comes to me, I am there to help, said Akram, who was one of the masters of reverse swing. 

It was about action, about seam, a lot of talk about reverse swing, said Akram, the only bowler in the history of the game to have scalped over 400 victims in both forms of the game. 

These guys want to improve, so they want to ask the top cricketers (for advice) and thats good. 

I did tell them the little details about reverse swing. I think well see Lee bowling reverse swing in the Ashes, Akram was quoted as saying by a website. 

We spoke about a number of things from conventional swing to reverse swing, different lines and lengths, Lee said of his chat with Akram. 

He gave us a few pointers and ways to try and get the ball to swing a bit more as the Australian team hasnt really mastered the art yet, the Australian added. 

Meanwhile, skipper Ricky Ponting has said Australia are headed in the right direction towards reclaiming the Ashes on home turf later this year. Our Test cricket cant be faulted, really, since the last Ashes match, he said. 

Everything we have done has been very, very good quality. The areas that we needed to address, I think we have addressed, he was quoted as saying in a Sydney paper on Saturday. (PTI)

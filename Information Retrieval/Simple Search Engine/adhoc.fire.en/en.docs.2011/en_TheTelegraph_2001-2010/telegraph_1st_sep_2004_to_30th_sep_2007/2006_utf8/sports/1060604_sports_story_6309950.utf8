 1960s: Moores last sigh

 CHILE 1962

 After two consecutive European-based 

 tournaments ? Switzerland 1954 and Sweden 1958 ? the Fifa 

 World Cup returned to South America twelve years after Brazil 

 played hosts. In May 1960, Chile was devastated by a series 

 of earthquakes which cost thousands of lives. The Chilean 

 FA president Carlos Dittborn famously pleaded to Fifa: We 

 have nothing, that is why we must have the World Cup. 

 Fifa agreed and Chile embarked on a massive building programme 

 to stage the seventh finals. Fifas choice of Chile, 

 however, raised more than a few eyebrows as it was believed 

 to be sorely deficient in many areas (stadiums, access roads, 

 capacity) and incapable of playing host to such a large-scale 

 event. Unfortunately, Dittborn was not there to see it. 

 Aged 41, he died of a heart attack a month before the tournament 

 began.

 It was another Brazilian triumph, 

 but Pel? played in only the opening game against Mexico 

 before being injured. 

 Did You Know?

 Fifty-six teams ? a record ? 

 took part in the qualifying rounds, which saw the elimination 

 of France and Sweden, two of the big guns from the 1958 

 tournament. Many first-round games in this World Cup, such 

 as USSR vs Yugoslavia, Chile vs Italy and West German vs 

 Switzerland, were unfortunately marred by over-physical 

 play. 

 The ugly side of football had 

 reared its head in a more pronounced way: all the more apparent 

 because the Brazilian world champions were not really able 

 to deliver their usual scintillating style of play, having 

 problems getting into their stride. And the injury sustained 

 by Pel? against Yugoslavia did nothing to make matters easier. 

 The star of the 1958 Fifa World 

 Cup finally limped out of the 1962 tournament for good following 

 a muscle injury suffered against Czechoslovakia. Nevertheless, 

 the Brazilians, led by Garrincha and Zagallo, though less 

 devastating than in Sweden, managed to qualify for the quarter-finals, 

 which was not to be the case for Uruguay, Argentina or Italy. 

 The tournaments emotional 

 high-spot came in the quarter finals when Chile defeated 

 the USSR (2-1) and the whole country took to the streets 

 to celebrate. The Chileans joy was short-lived, however, 

 for in the semi-final the Brazilians proved too strong for 

 them. Brazil therefore qualified for their second consecutive 

 final. Their opponents for the title were to be Czechoslovakia, 

 surprise winners over Yugoslavia in the semis. 

 The Czechs had already forged 

 a draw (0-0) against the Brazilians in the first round and 

 also miraculously beaten the Hungarians in the quarter finals, 

 the latter having struck the post no less than four times. 

 Against all the odds it was the Czechs who took the lead 

 in this final, before the Brazilians equalised two minutes 

 later and then went on to score two more to retain the title: 

 a magnificent feat from a team including nine players who 

 had taken part in the victorious 1958 campaign. 

 Off-side

 Lev Yashin of Soviet Union is rated as the best goalkeeper 

 in World Cup history. The Fifa trophy for the best keeper 

 in a World Cup competition, introduced in 1994, is named 

 after him in honour of his fine performances. 

 Garrincha was sent-off in the semi-finals against Chile. 

 But Brazilian officials negotiated with Fifa and organisers 

 to let the tournaments numero uno entertainer play 

 in the final. the Brazilian legend was eventually allowed 

 to play. 

 There are some famous names to be found in the list 

 of the fastest goals: Bryan Robson took 27 seconds to 

 beat Frances keeper Ettori in 1982; four years earlier 

 Bernard Lacombe needed 37 to put the ball past Italys 

 Dino Zoff. The record is held by Vaclav Masek, who scored 

 for Czechoslovakia against Mexico in 1962 after just 15 

 seconds. (This did not stop the Mexicans, with their legendary 

 keeper Carbajal, from winning the match 3-1). 

 The tournament will be remembered for staging one of 

 the most notorious matches in World Cup history ? the 

 Battle of Santiago between Italy and Chile, in which two 

 Italians were sent off and one had his nose broken by 

 a solid left-hook from a Chilean player.

 ENGLAND 1966

 Since its launch in 1930, the 

 World Cup had grown in stature to become clearly the worlds 

 senior international football tournament. After the Jules 

 Rimet Trophy was stolen while on display in London, but 

 it was recovered by a dog called Pickles under a bush in 

 a suburban front garden in south London a few days later. 

 Pel? was again battered, this 

 time by Bulgaria and Portugal as Brazils bid for a 

 third consecutive title faltered. England, shrewdly managed 

 by Alf (later Sir Alf) Ramsey, beat West Germany 4-2 after 

 extra time in a thrilling final at Wembley, when Geoff Hurst 

 made history with a hattrick, including the most controversial 

 goal ever scored. Did the ball really cross the line after 

 bouncing down from the crossbar? The debate rages on 

 Did You Know?

 With 16 African nations declaring 

 forfeit even before a single match had kicked off, the 1966 

 World Cup qualifiers did not get off to the best of starts. 

 The Africans protest was the result of a new Fifa 

 rule stipulating that the winners of the Africa Zone must 

 then beat the winners of either the Asia or Oceania Zone 

 in order to reach the finals. The Africans believed that 

 winning their zone should have been enough to go straight 

 through to the finals. This 1964 ruling was eventually overturned 

 four years later in Africas favour. Meanwhile, with 

 70 teams taking part in the qualifiers ? another record 

 ? Fifa decided that ten teams should qualify from Europe, 

 four from South America, one from Asia and one from North 

 and Central America. 

 Notable first-time qualifiers 

 were the Portuguese, who reached the finals despite being 

 drawn in the same group as Czechoslovakia, finalists four 

 years earlier. The English, in front of their own crowd 

 and the cameras of the BBC, were, needless to say, among 

 the tournament favourites. Playing proficiently and without 

 conceding a goal, they won through to the quarter finals, 

 drawing 0-0 against Uruguay, winning 2-0 against Mexico 

 and 2-0 again against France. 

 But the big news of the first 

 round was the elimination of the title-holders, Brazil. 

 After beating Bulgaria, Pel? and his teammates went down 

 to Hungary and then the surprise team, Portugal. And once 

 again Pel? was a victim of over-physical play on the part 

 of defenders. 

 Among those qualifying for the 

 second round were the North Koreans, who surprised everybody 

 by knocking out the Italians and then taking a 3-0 lead 

 over the Portuguese in the tournaments most dazzling 

 match. Portugal fought back and eventually triumphed (5-3), 

 with Eusebio supplying four of the goals. The rest of the 

 tournament, however, failed to maintain this momentum. The 

 English eventually won the title, beating Germany (4-2) 

 after extra-time in the final, and captain Bobby Moore led 

 this team to the royal box to receive the trophy from Queen 

 Elizabeth II. 

 Off-side

 Probably no event in the history of the World Cup has 

 caused so much discussion, between fans as well as on 

 an official level, as the so-called Wembley goal 

 that set England on the way to victory when Geoff Hurst 

 made it 3:2 in the final against Germany. The Swiss referee 

 Gottfried Dienst, who made his decision after consulting 

 his Russian linesman, is still remembered by football 

 fans all over the world, fondly by England fans, less 

 so by their German counterparts. 

 Alf Ramsey did a brave thing in 1963 when he was appointed 

 England manager, saying his team would win the World Cup 

 in 1966. In the end, he was proved right. 

 Antonio Carbazal became the first player to play in 

 five World Cup finals. His feat was later equalled by 

 Germanys Lothar Matthaus.

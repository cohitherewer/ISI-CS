 Smith leads SA to series victory

 Graeme Smith after his fifty on Sunday 

Johannesburg: Graeme Smith hit second half-century of the match as South Africa beat New Zealand by four wickets on the third day of the third and final Test against New Zealand at the Wanderers on Sunday. 

South Africa needed only 47.3 overs to reach a victory target of 217 and clinch series 2-0, which also took them to fifth place on the ICC ranking list, swapping positions with New Zealand. 

South Africa had to overcome stubborn resistance by New Zealands lower order batsmen before they could start their run chase. 

Daniel Vettori led the Black Caps resistance by hitting 60 to add 69 runs to their overnight total of 214 for six. 

Then Smith and Boeta Dippenaar batted aggressively, putting on 69 in the first 14 overs before Dippenaar was caught behind off Chris Martin. Smith went on to make 68 off 80 balls with nine fours and a six. 

Smith made 63 in the first innings in a match which yielded only four scores over 50. The South African skipper was clearly intent on finishing the match with two days to spare, reaching his fifty off just 72 balls. 

Franklin provided more frustration for the bowlers as he and Vettori added 44 for the eighth wicket before the innings ended in a rush, as the last three wickets fell for no runs in six balls.Franklin padded a ball from Pollock, which cut back and hit the top of his off stump. 

South Africa won the first Test in centurion by 128 runs and drew second in Cape Town.

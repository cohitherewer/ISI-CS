 Atwal slips despite best round

La Quinta: Arjun Atwal carded his best round so far with a two-under 70 but still slipped seven places to tied 63rd at the midway stage of the six round US PGA Tour qualifying school finals in California. 

Atwal had four birdies against two bogeys, but it still did not help him move up. 

Atwal is allowed to play in 15 events next year after gaining a conditional card for his 140th place finish on the money list last season. 

Australian Paul Gow, who shot a 65 for a 13-under-par 203 total, is the leader. Koreas Charlie Wi enjoyed a blemish-free round with a steady six-under-par 66 in the third round and was in tied 22nd position eight strokes behind leader. 

Wi was four-under after nine holes and with two more birdies on the 11th and 15 holes, the Maybank Malaysian Open winner has now inched his way into the top-30.

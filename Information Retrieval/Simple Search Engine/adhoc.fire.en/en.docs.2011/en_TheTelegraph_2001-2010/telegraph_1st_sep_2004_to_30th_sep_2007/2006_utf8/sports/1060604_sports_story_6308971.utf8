 Crouch hattrick in Englands 6-0 win

Manchester: Striker Peter Crouch scored a hat-trick as England ran riot in a 6-0 victory over Jamaica in their final World Cup warmup on Saturday. 

Frank Lampard began the goal bonanza at Old Trafford after 11 minutes, Jamaicas Jermaine Taylor headed into his own net and fellow defender Omar Daley was no luckier when a Crouch shot struck him and flew in the net. 

Michael Owen, plagued by a foot injury since December 31, scored his first goal of the year in the 32nd minute and Crouch claimed his second of a sunlit day with a 66th minute tap-in. 

He looked to have spurned his chance of a hat-trick when the lanky striker hopelessly skied an 82nd minute penalty won by Owen, only to rifle in Englands sixth in the 89th minute after a neat Owen pass. 

The classy finish from the edge of the area made for a perfect send-off for England, who open their World Cup campaign next Saturday against Paraguay in Group B.

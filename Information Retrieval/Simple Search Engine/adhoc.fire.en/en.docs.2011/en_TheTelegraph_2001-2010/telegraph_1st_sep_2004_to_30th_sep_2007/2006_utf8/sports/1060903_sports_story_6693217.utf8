 Brazil in fiery face-off with Argentina 

London: Describing any meeting between Brazil and Argentina as a friendly does little justice to the fervent emotions stirred whenever these South American superpowers clash. 

So when two of world footballs most popular and passionate teams go head-to-head at Arsenals Emirates Stadium on Sunday, a fiery encounter seems certain. 

Following the disappointment in Germany, Dunga who captained Brazil to victory at the 1994 World Cup, was appointed as Carlos Alberto Parreiras successor. Argentina are also in a state of a transition. Manager Jose Pekerman resigned and has been replaced by Alfio Coco Basile. 

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be among the 60,000 crowd to keep an eye on Brazil midfielder Julio Baptista, his transfer deadline-day signing from Real Madrid, who should feature alongside fellow gunner Gilberto Silva. 

Gilberto, 29, knows his team has the perfect chance to make up for the World CUp disappointment, by beating their bitter rivals. After the World Cup we are starting from zero. The defeat against France was hard to absorb. We were very frustrated and we need to rebuild our confidence, he said. 

West ham fans will also be keenly watching to get their first glimpse of Argentina pair Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano, who joined the English Premiership club from Brazilian side Corinthians on Thursday. (AFP)

 Sandeep Singh discharged

Chandigarh: Three weeks after sustaining a gunshot wound, Indian hockey star Sandeep Singh was on Saturday discharged from a government hospital here and would now be travelling to The Netherlands next month for physiotherapy on the advice of the international hockey federation. 

The 21-year-old drag-flicker sustained the injury in the lower back in what is believed to be an accidental firing from the gun of an RPF personnel while travelling on Shatabdi Express from Ambala to New Delhi on August 22. 

I want to forget it (injury) as a bad dream. I am feeling good now, the drag-flicker told reporters. What I am feeling now is similar to the one which one has after tasting a victory, he added. 

Asked when he could start playing again, he said he hoped to be fit by mid-October to play in the Dutch league and then in the Asian Games. (PTI)

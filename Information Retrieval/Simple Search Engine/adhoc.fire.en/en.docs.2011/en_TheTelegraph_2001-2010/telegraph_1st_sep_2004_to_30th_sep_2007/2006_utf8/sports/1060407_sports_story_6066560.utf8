Zagreb: Davis Cup holders Croatia will make a last-minute decision on Friday whether Mario Ancic can play in the quarter final against Argentina. 

World No. 5 Ivan Ljubicic, Croatias top-ranked player and team captain, has recovered from abdominal pain and fatigue and will play in the first singles against Agustin Calleri. 

However, Ancic, ranked 17th, is suffering from a hernia and is doubtful for the second singles against David Nalbandian. Ancic said he would decide with Ljubicic about 15 minutes before the second singles whether he was fit to play. 

If sidelined, Ancic will be replaced by either 17-year-old Marin Cilic or Sasa Tuksar. 

In Pau, Frances Sebastien Grosjean will miss the quarter final against Russia with a back injury. Frances Richard Gasquet will face Marat Safin in the opening singles on Friday. Arnaud Clement will play Nikolay Davydenko in second singles. 

Clement and Michael Llodra will team up in the doubles against Igor Andreev and Mikhail Youzhny. 

Australias Chris Guccione will face Max Mirnyi of Belarus in the opening singles rubber at Melbournes Kooyong on Friday. Lleyton Hewitt will play Vladimir Voltchkov in second singles. 

Mirnyi and Voltchkov will team up in the doubles while Australia will field a fresh pair in Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley. (Reuters)

 Great working relationship vital: Ponting 

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has said it is not crucial that his teams new coach should have played international cricket. 

I dont think its that vital that the new coach has international experience. As long as they have a chance to run their coaching programme (thats okay), Ponting was quoted as saying in a media report here on Monday. 

I think it should be someone who has played at a high level and hasnt been out of the game for too long because of how the game has changed and evolved, he further said. The coach just has to have a great working relationship with all the players, he added. 

Cricket Australia will soon sound out candidates to replace John Buchanan when his successful seven-year tenure ends after the World Cup. The most common criticism levelled at former Queensland batsman Buchanan is that he did not play international cricket.

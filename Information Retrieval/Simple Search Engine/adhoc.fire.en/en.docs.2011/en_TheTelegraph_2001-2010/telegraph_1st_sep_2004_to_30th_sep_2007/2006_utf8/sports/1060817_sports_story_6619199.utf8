The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Bhaichung Bhutias national duty may have got over on Wednesday, but his club will be playing within 24 hours. 

 The India captain, along with Mohun Bagan teammates Deepak Mondal, Subrata Paul and Mehrajuddin Wadao will have to report at the club before the CFL Premier Division match against George Telegraph. 

 It will be coach Biswajit Bhattacharyas call, but its unlikely that Bhaichung will play. Jose Ramirez Barreto hasnt yet signed, so his 2006-07 debut for the red-and-maroons will also have to wait.

 Meanwhile, East Bengals Brazilian defender Octavio landed in the city on Wednesday. He is expected to sign as soon as his ITC is received.

 A total of 837 donated blood on Wednesday, the Football Lovers Day. Donors received certificates signed by former India international Gautam Sarkar.

 Hosts Space Circle beat Eremax Technologies Team II in the fifth Corporate Indoor Cricket meet on Wednesday.

Calcutta: Bengal had hoped the Mumbai youngsters to crumble under the pressure of having to face a daunting total of 578. Instead the visiting batsmen showed composure and application to reach 206 for two at close on the penultimate day of their Ranji Trophy Super League match at the Eden on Sunday. 

The wicket, as Deep Dasgupta said, was still good to bat on, and it will take a lot of effort from the home bowlers to ensure a point from this game. The little turn seen on Sunday was mainly due to the wear and tear of the wicket. Neither team gets a point if the match isnt decided by the first innings. 

Bengal batted for seven overs in the morning to ensure Manoj Tewari reached his maiden double hundred and got past Arun Lal to record the highest individual score against Mumbai. 

Responsible batting by Bhavin Thakkar, who was batting on 108, ensured Mumbai overcame an early jolt. They were, in turn, helped by some sloppy fielding by the hosts, with Deep dropping a regulation chance. 

Ranadeb Bose bowled a superb line in the morning session to give some hope, but the other bowlers lacked penetration on the docile wicket. The pacer removed Sahil Kukreja with a beauty, the opener failing to move his bat out of the way. Ranadeb should have been brought back in the last session, but Deep showed faith in Ashok Dinda. 

Mondays opening session will decide the outcome, with the second new ball already due. 

Circumstances may force Bengal to finally rue not having asked Manoj to accelerate on the second evening. It could have given them some extra time in hand to bowl out Mumbai. We hope we dont have to regret not getting a point from this match in the later stages of the tournament, Deep remarked. 

Bhavin showed good concentration and temperament during his 331-minute stay at the wicket, which included 15 boundaries. This was the 24-year-olds maiden hundred after having made his debut in 2001. He has not been a regular in the side but has often contributed handsomely. 

This season has started off on a right note for him after having changed his stance following advice from coach Pravin Amre and a few others. He worked hard at the MRF Academy in Chennai during the off-season and its paying off. He isnt, however, taking his place for granted even after this innings. 

Giving Bhavin company is Amol Muzumdar, looks impressive. There is still a lot of batting to follow for Mumbai and chances look bleak for Bengal to initiate a collapse.

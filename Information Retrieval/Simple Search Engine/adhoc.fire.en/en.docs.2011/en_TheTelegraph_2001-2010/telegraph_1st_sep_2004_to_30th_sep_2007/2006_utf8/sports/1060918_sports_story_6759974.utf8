The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It was a big moment when I got Sachin, Rahul: Johnson 

 - Mentally, Id prepared myself for the (limited) opportunities, says 

 Aussie fast bowler 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: Mitchell Johnson arrived here with a sizeable fan following at home, but it was largely restricted to the fairer sex. When he lands in Sydney, though, hes going to find that just about every Australian now recognises him. 

Even if he does away with the prominently worn gold stud. 

This change will be because of a great week in the tri-series: Two wickets (including Brian Laras) against the West Indies and four (Sachin Tendulkars being one) versus India. Yet, he had to fly out on Sunday evening because of a selection committee decision taken before the team arrived in Kuala Lumpur. 

I knew I would only be playing the first two matches... Mentally, Id prepared myself for the (limited) opportunities... Im happy that everyone in the team supported me, Johnson, who is 24, remarked during an interaction with the Media before leaving for the airport. 

Asked what it meant to evict Sachin on the evening before, he said: Wasnt nervous when I began bowling to him... I took it out of my mind that he was Sachin Tendulkar... Ive grown up following the exploits of Sachin and Rahul Dravid and, so, it was a big moment when I got them... 

Johnson, who made his ODI debut last December (he hasnt played a Test), accepted that being labelled as the great Australian fast bowling hope did put him under some pressure. However, the Queenslander, who has come through back injuries, isnt short on confidence. 

Hes looking forward to the Champions Trophy, beginning in India next month (Ive played the U-19s there and know what to expect), but the forthcoming Ashes is a target. A look-in is really going to be a massive bonus. 

Speaking exclusively to The Telegraph, Johnson revealed hed been a big fan of Curtley Ambrose and teammate Brett Lee. Ive looked up to a few bowlers, but none more so than Brett and Ambrose... Obviously, he has been influenced by Glenn McGrath as well and sees sharing the new ball with him as a privilege. 

Few, by the way, could have missed Johnsons Lee-like celebration on getting wickets. It can look silly at times, but thats me... Im not as quick as Brett, though... Well, so what? 

Meanwhile, selection committee chairman Andrew Hilditch explained that the policy decision (on sending back Johnson, Mark Cosgrove and Phil Jaques) couldnt have been reversed. Eighteen is a very big tour party and the number had to be reduced... The tri-series is a unique tournament as we hadnt played after April... 

The chairman, a former opener, added that the selectors may shy away from a similar arrangement in the future. 

Grinning, Hilditch pointed out that he and his colleagues didnt have a problem when young players made the most of opportunities. He was referring to Johnson and even Shane Watson, who hammered 79 as an opener on Saturday.

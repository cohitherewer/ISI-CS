Jamshedpur: North Zone claimed two quick wickets to put Central Zone on the backfoot on Day II of the Duleep Trophy tie at the Keenan Stadium on Saturday. 

At the draw of stumps, Central were 85 for two with young Tejinder Pal Singh and Brajesh Tomar batting on 26 and seven, respectively. 

Central are still 358 runs behind Norths first innings total of 443.Central launched their innings after North were all out 22 minutes after lunch. Openers Amit Pagnis and Shiva Kant Shukla started on a confidant note, negotiating the pace of Ashish Nehra and Gagandeep Singh with ease. 

Nehra derived lot of pace from the wicket. He was unlucky not to have induced an edge from both Pagnis and Shukla. 

 But Central received a setback after North skipper Mithun Manhas introduced Joginder Sharma from the Pavilion end. 

Sharma soon sent back a seemingly well-settled Shukla (24) by having him caught by wicketkeeper Mahesh Rawat at the score of 43. North tasted another success when VRV Singh evicted Pagnis (15) in similar fashion in the next over. 

Earlier, both Mahesh Rawat and Joginder Sharma struck fine centuries to help North pile up a commanding total. 

The former, who is playing his first Duleep Trophy match, displayed good temperament and found the gaps at regular interval. 

In Cuttack, Sri Lanka A bowled out West Zone for a paltry 149 and took a 259-run overall lead on the second day at the Barabati Stadium.

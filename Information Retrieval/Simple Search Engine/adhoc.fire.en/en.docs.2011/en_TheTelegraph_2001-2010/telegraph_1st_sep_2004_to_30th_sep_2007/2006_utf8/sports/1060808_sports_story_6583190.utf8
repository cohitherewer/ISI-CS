 PCB stadium plan hits snag

Islamabad: Plans by the PCB to construct a stadium in Islamabad for the 2011 World Cup have run into problems, a board official said on Monday. 

The board chose the capital for its new stadium as it does not have an international cricket venue, but the official said city planners were demanding $5 million in leasing charges alone. 

Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will co-host the World Cup in 2011. Pakistan will also host the 2008 Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup. 

They are giving us land for the stadium on a long-term lease but the fees they are demanding are exorbitant, said the official. 

We want the CDA (Capital Development Authority) to revise their leasing fees. If things dont work out, we will have to manage with the existing venues, he said, adding that work to upgrade the National Stadium in Karachi would also begin soon.

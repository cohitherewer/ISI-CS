London: Ivan Ljubicic, in the unusual dual role of player and captain, inspired Davis Cup champions Croatia to an unassailable 3-0 lead over Austria in the World Group first round on Saturday. 

Croatia were joined in the last eight by their next opponents Argentina, France, Russia, Chile and Belarus, who knocked out Spain. 

Australia, minus the injured Lleyton Hewitt, won Saturdays doubles to go 2-1 up on Switzerland, who are without reigning world No. 1 Roger Federer.

In Graz, Ljubicic and Mario Ancic roared back from two sets down to beat Julian Knowle and Juergen Melzer 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 8-6.

Sweden, who won the title seven times between 1975 and 1998, struggled on the clay surface that favoured the home side and had their serve broken 13 times. 

In Minsk, Max Mirnyi and Vladimir Voltchkov overcame Feliciano Lopez and Fernando Verdasco 7-6, 6-4, 7-5 to earn Belarus an upset win over Spain, champions in 2000 and 2004. 

Belarus are likely to face Australia in the last eight after doubles specialists Wayne Arthurs and Paul Hanley beat Switzerlands Stanislas Wawrinka and Yves Allegro 7-6, 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 in Geneva.

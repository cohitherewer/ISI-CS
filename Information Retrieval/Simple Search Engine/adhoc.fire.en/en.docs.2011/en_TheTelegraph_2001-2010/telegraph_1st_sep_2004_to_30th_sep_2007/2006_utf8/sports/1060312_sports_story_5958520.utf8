 Humpy off to a flier with win

Ekaterinburg (Russia): Grandmaster Koneru Humpy cruised to an easy victory over Woman Grandmaster Tuduetso Sabure of Bostwana in the first game of the first round of Womens World Chess Championship which started here. 

The victory in the first of the two-game mini-match means Humpy will now need just a draw in the return game to make it to the last 32 in this 64 players event being played on a knock-out basis. 

The stakes are high here with a total prize pool of $450000 with $60000 reserved for the winner. There were no major surprises in the first round as defending champion Antoaneta Stefanova also made short work of last seed Amina Mezioud of Algeria. 

Other Indians in the fray, S. Vijayalakshmi and S. Meenakshi were still involved in keen tussles against Irina Berezina of Australia and Tatiana Kosintseva of Russia, respectively.

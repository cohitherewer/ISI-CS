Brisbane: Ricky Ponting completed his 32nd Test hundred as Australia dominated the opening day of the first Ashes Test against England at the Gabba on Thursday. 

The Australian skipper batted magnificently to reach the close unbeaten on 137 with Mike Hussey on 63 and the world champions in cruise control at 346 for three. 

It was a tough day in the field for England who lost the toss at the start of their bid to defend the Ashes they won back last year for the first time since 1989. 

Justin Langer got the Australians off to a flying start when he blazed a quick 82 but England briefly pegged them back, dismissing Matthew Hayden (21) and Damien Martyn (29) before an unbroken partnership of 148 between Ponting and Hussey tipped the scales firmly Australias way. 

Captain Andrew Flintoff was the best England bowler, capturing the wickets of Australian openers Langer and Hayden, while left-arm spinner Ashley Giles dismissed Martyn after getting the nod ahead of Monty Panesar. 

However, Englands three main pace bowlers failed to threaten with Steve Harmison ominously starting the series with a horrendous wide that went straight to Flintoff at second slip and conceding 52 runs from 12 wayward overs. 

James Anderson was equally ineffective, going for 88 off 18 and Matthew Hoggard leaked 62 from 16. Part-timers Kevin Pietersen and Ian Bell bowled 10 overs as England searched for a breakthrough. 

While Englands bowlers disappointed, the tourists did at least field much better than their last visit to Australia when they conceded 364 on the opening day to set the tone for a series in which they lost the Ashes after only 11 days. 

The Australians, desperate to avenge the series loss in England last year, batted with a ruthless determination that illustrated their determination to win back the Ashes. 

Ponting, who has scored nine Test hundreds in 13 matches since the last Ashes, underlined his position as the worlds best batsman with a chanceless display. 

He opened his account when he pulled Harmison to the boundary and set about building an innings that featured some exquisite straight drives and pulls. 

Ponting passed his 50 off 65 balls then reached his ton off 163 deliveries in 200 minutes, equalling Steve Waughs record for the most Test hundreds by an Australian. 

The only players to have scored more are Indians Sachin Tendulkar (35) and Sunil Gavaskar (34) and West Indian Brian Lara (34) though at just 31 years of age Ponting looks destined to pass them all if he maintains his current form. 

Langer, under pressure to retain his place in the team ahead of Phil Jaques, laid the foundations for Australias imposing total when he smashed two boundaries in the first over and raced to his fifty off 66 balls. 

Flintoff, wearing a black armband to mourn the death of his wifes grandfather, briefly put the brakes on the scoring when he removed Hayden with the total on 79, caught by Paul Collingwood at second slip.

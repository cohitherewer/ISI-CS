The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 7-goal humiliation calls for desperate 

 measures

 FREE-KICK

 P.K. Banerjee

 These are trying times for Indian 

 soccer. A foreign coach was replaced by an Indian, who didnt 

 get a fair run and was dumped after two heavy defeats. An 

 experienced British coach then took over, but the bottomline 

 refuses to change. The seven-goal humiliation in Saudi Arabia 

 once again exposed the growing chasm between the Indian 

 national team and the Asian top brass.

 No one is calling for Houghtons 

 head, at least, not yet. But those who are genuinely concerned, 

 are asking that age-old question: what exactly should be 

 done to improve the health of Indian football?

 Desperate times call for desperate 

 measures. And people have been making some suggestions which 

 Im not sure will work. Like, give foreign footballers 

 Indian citizenship and pick them for the national team. 

 They cite the example of teams like France, and argue that 

 they have very few sons of the soil playing for the national 

 team.

 Yes, the Les Bleus are made up 

 mostly of players whose roots are outside the country. But, 

 to think that such a policy will work like magic in the 

 Indian context is akin to day-dreaming.

 First, why will good players want 

 to don Indian colours? Is there enough financial allurement 

 for them to settle in this country and play club football 

 which will provide them the bread and butter? Just to give 

 an example, will an African like Essien or even a World 

 Cupper from Tunisia earn more than their current salaries 

 playing for an Indian outfit?

 And if they dont benefit 

 financially, why will they agree to play for a lowly-ranked 

 country like India? It will still make some sense if we 

 can attract top-class talents, but to do that, you not only 

 need enough money but also a proper set-up and modern infrastructure 

 in place. Does our country have it?

 Theres absolutely no point 

 in trying to convince the dozens of third-grade foreigners 

 who come to India looking to earn some money and get called 

 by some club or the other to become Indians, 

 because they are not going to serve the purpose in any way.

 Maybe a quality player like Jose 

 Ramirez Barreto can fit in, but we dont have too many 

 of his class in India. In any case, the gifted Brazilian 

 has said he is happy being a Brazilian.

 The AIFF has also been tapping 

 players of Indian origin residing abroad. A good idea, but 

 even that is unlikely to work. Unless, of course, they find 

 an extremely talented footballer with a fierce sense of 

 patriotism who is dying to play for his motherland. 

 In our playing days, we didnt 

 need a second invitation to play for the country. That was 

 the ultimate goal. There was no money in the game, so I 

 guess there was no dilemma as well. But times have changed 

 beyond recognition. Now, clubs call the shots as they pay 

 fortunes to hire top players.

 I think the only way forward for 

 Indian football and I have been saying this for a long 

 time is to identify and develop pockets in India from 

 which we can get the talents we require. For example, the 

 north-east has to be tapped to unearth players with high 

 stamina and energy, Punjab and Haryana for big, robust men 

 who can battle on an even keel with tall and strong rivals, 

 Bengal and Goa for skilful and versatile game-makers.

 Of course, you also need huge 

 funds for the sport as well. Nothing like a big corporate 

 taking over football for a period of say five years and 

 backing it come what may. That will be the day when Indian 

 football grows out of its infancy.

 When I am talking football, how 

 can I not mention Sudip Chatterjees untimely death? 

 He was a coachs delight very obedient and prepared 

 to give more than 100 per cent day in and day out. I got 

 him to play in central midfield and he made that position 

 his own. I havent seen anyone pushing 30-40 metre 

 ground passes like him after Jarnail Singh.

 Sudip was a trifle slow, but he 

 made it up with several other attributes. He was a fearless 

 footballer who never thought of losing. He was also a fine 

 team-man with good leadership qualities. India can certainly 

 do with a handful of footballers like him right now. 

 May his soul rest in peace.

 Materazzi book on head-butting 

Rome: Marco Materazzi has put together a book in which he takes a tongue-in-cheek look at what he might have said to prompt Zinedine Zidane to head butt him in the World Cup final. 

Zidane, who was playing in the final game of his career, rammed his head into the Italy defenders chest during extra time of the World Cup final after Materazzi said something to him. The France captain was red-carded and Italy went on to win the title on penalty kicks. 

The incident sparked weeks of speculation about what Materazzi might have told Zidane to provoke such a reaction, and the Italian eventually acknowledged that he had insulted Zidanes sister. 

In a book titled What I actually told Zidane, Materazzi lists 249 possible phrases he could have uttered, including his real words, a news agency reported Sunday. 

The sentences range from Zidane, what are you doing? You havent lost yet and already youve ripped your hair out, to Since Foucault died, French philosophy has sucked. 

The book, which costs euro10 (US$13), is being published by Mondadori and was shown at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Money earned from the books sale will be donated to Unicef, the agency reported. 

Phone calls to Mondadoris offices in Rome and Milan were unanswered Sunday.

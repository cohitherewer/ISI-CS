 Sania climbs one spot to 67

New Delhi: Sania Mirza moved one place up to 67th spot in the latest WTA rankings despite taking last week off. The Hyderabadi, who lost in the first round of the Bangkok Open two weeks ago to American Meghann Shaughnessy, finds herself on 382 points. 

She had lost seven places last week after improving her performances in the Sunfeast Open in Calcutta, where she reached the semi-finals, and the Korean Open, where she defeated former world No. 1 Martina Hingis. Sania also rose one spot to 26th in the world doubles rankings. 

Shikha Uberoi, who lost one spot to be 211th, is the next highest-ranked Indian in singles. 

The only change in the top-10 of the singles ranking is Hingis upstaging compatriot Patty Schnyder to take eighth place. 

In mens doubles rankings, Leander Paes dropped one place to 11th while Mahesh Bhupathi lost four spots to be number 31. 

 Paes and his Czech partner Martin Damm are at No. 

 5 on the ATP doubles race for the season finale in Shanghai, 

 while Bhupathi and Croatias Mario Ancic are languishing 

 at 30th spot.

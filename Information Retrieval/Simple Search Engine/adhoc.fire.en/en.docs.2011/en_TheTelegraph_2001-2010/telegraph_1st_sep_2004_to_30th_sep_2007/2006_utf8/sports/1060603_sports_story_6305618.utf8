 Big support for Fallons ride

 SRIMAX

 Epsom: Irish trainer Aidan Brien mounts a powerful four-horse raid on Saturdays Epsom Derby, the worlds premier classic.

 Brien won the Derby in 2001 and 2002 with Galileo and High Chaparral and holds plenty of strong cards in Saturdays renewal when he bids to outdo French raider Visindar, the 7-4 strong favourite in the 18-strong field.

 Stable jockey Kieren Fallon had the pick of Briens Ballydoyle contingent and after some soul-searching plumped for Horatio Nelson.

 The decision prompted a flood of money from punters since Fallon has ridden three of the last seven Derby winners. The colt is as low as 9-2 second favourite from twice those odds.

 Horatio Nelson disappointed in the Newmarket 2,000 Guineas when well beaten by stable companion George Washington, but impressed in a work-out earlier in the week.

 Fallons choice means some tasty pickings from the Brien stable for rivals Mick Kinane and Johnny Murtagh, both dual Derby winners.

 Kinane has come in for the ride on 13-2 chance Septimus, winner of the Dante Stakes, a highly reliable classic trial.

 Murtagh partners 14-1 shot Dylan Thomas, who won an equally important trial at Leopardstown.

 Visindar is favourite on the strength of some impressive performances in his home country and owner the Aga Khan has won 

 the Derby four times, including with Shergar in 1981.

 Sir Percy, a staying-on second to George Washington in the Guineas, heads the home challenge and is rated a 7-1 chance to win for trainer Marcus Tregoning and jockey Martin Dwyer.

 Frankie Dettori, without a ride 

 for Godolphin who are enduring a barren run, has been snapped up 12-1 French challenger Lindas Lad, a stable mate of the favourite.

 Lindas Lad won the Lingfield Derby Trial, a race that threw up High-Rise the 20-1 Epsom winner of 1998. Dettori, remarkably, has still to win the Derby after 13 attempts.

 Former England soccer player Mick Channon, now a trainer, is represented by 16-1 shot Championship Point, a winner of Goodwoods Predominate Stakes. (REUTERS)

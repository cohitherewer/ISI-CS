 Negi wins 3rd match in row

 Negi beat Navarrete of Spain 

Vlissingen (The Netherlands): Parimarjan Negis winning streak continued as he defeated Sergio Navarrete of Spain to remain in joint lead after the third round of Hogeschool Zeeland International Chess tournament here. 

The 13-year-old Indian, the second youngest GM in the world, was put in a spot of bother by his opponent in a Sicilian Defence game where he played black, but managed to turn the tables in the end. 

On what turned out to be a mixed day for five Indians in fray, International Master Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury hogged the limelight by holding top-seeded GM Mikahil Gurevich. 

GM Dibyendu Barua scored a fine victory over Dutchman Erik Oosterom but IM-in-waiting Saptarshi Roy and IM Roktim Bandyopadhyay slumped to defeats at the hands of GMs Michal Krasenkow of Poland and Russias Vyacheslav Ikonnikov, respectively. 

At the end of Round III, 19 players emerged with a perfect score. In the next round, Negi will face third seed GM Viorel Iordachescu of Moldova, while Barua will take on Russian GM Konstantin Landa. 

Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury is known for his solid style and Gurevich learned about it in quick time as he seemed unable to get any advantage with white. 

Playing the English opening, the Belgium-turned-Turkish player tried hard to make a foray on the queenside but Chowdhury did not give any decisive manoeuvring space. 

A few pieces changed hands in the early part of the middle game and with a central pawn thrust on the 25th move, Chowdhury made sure he had enough counter-play in the ensuing rook and pawns endgame. The game lasted just 28 moves. (PTI)

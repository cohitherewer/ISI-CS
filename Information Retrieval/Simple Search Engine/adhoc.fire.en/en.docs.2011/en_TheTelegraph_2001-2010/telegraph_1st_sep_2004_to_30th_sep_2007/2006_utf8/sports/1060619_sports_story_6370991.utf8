 - World No. 1 records 41 consecutive victories on grass

Berlin: Wimbledon champion Roger Federer equalled Bjorn Borgs record of 41 consecutive victories on grass with a 6-0, 6-7, 6-2 victory over Czech Tomas Berdych in the final of the Halle Open on Sunday. 

This is a top moment for me. Coming straight after the French Open, it was a really tough week for me, Federer said. 

Halle has always brought me luck in recent years. I hope that remains the case. 

Federer, who was less than convincing in his previous two matches against Olivier Rochus and Tommy Haas, took the first set against fifth seed Berdych in 20 minutes. However, the Swiss world No. 1 started making unforced errors and although he served for the set at 5-3, Berdych held and went on to take the tiebreak 7-4. 

Federer, who lost last weeks French Open final to Rafael Nadal, increased the pressure on Berdych and broke for 2-1 and 5-2 to take the match. 

Swedens Borg, a five-time Wimbledon champion, set the Open-era record for consecutive wins on grass from 1976 to 1981. 

Meanwhile, in London, Lleyton Hewitt ended a 17-month title drought when he beat James Blake 6-4, 6-4 to win the Stella Artois Championships for a record-equalling fourth time on Sunday. 

Hewitt outfoxed the big-hitting American, who had shocked triple defending champion Andy Roddick in the semi-finals, to join an illustrious club of men who have won a quartet of Queens Club titles in the professional era. 

Only John McEnroe and Boris Becker have won the pre-Wimbledon grasscourt event four times. 

It was Hewitts first title since he won at Sydney in January 2005 and avenged his defeat by Blake in the Las Vegas final in March. (Reuters)

 Gilchrist fined for dissent

Sydney: Australias stand-in captain Adam Gilchrist was fined 40 per cent of his match fee on Wednesday after pleading guilty to showing dissent towards an umpire last week, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman was found by Match Referee Jeff Crowe to have breached the ICCs code of conduct when he questioned a run-out decision by umpire Aleem Dar during a one-day International against South Africa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Squads arrive in Kochi

 Fourth ODI

 Kochi: Cricket fever has 

 gripped the city with the arrival of the Indian and England 

 cricket squads this morning for the fourth one-dayer to 

 be held at the Jawahar- lal Nehru Stadium on Thursday.

 Both teams arrived here by a chartered 

 Goair flight from Goa that landed at the nearby Nedumbassery 

 Airport.

 Organisers garlanded the players 

 on their arrival and sandalwood paste was applied on their 

 forehead.

 Later at the Taj Malabar Hotel 

 in the Willington Island where the squad members are staying, 

 they were received with Thalappoli.

 People, mostly youngsters, had 

 thronged the airport to see their cricketing heroes. There 

 were loud cheers when the local boy Sreesanth, only the 

 second Keralite to play for the country after Tinu Yohannan, 

 emerged.

 Police had made tight security 

 arrangements both at the airport and at the hotel, where 

 both the teams are staying.

 Apparently tired of the hot and 

 humid conditions in Goa during the third one-dayer on Monday, 

 the teams preferred to remain indoors. 

 However, later in the evening 

 middleorder batsman Mohammed Kaif and Yalaka Venugopala 

 Rao came to the ground and practised for an hour.

 Dravid praise 

 Meanwhile, Rahul Dravid was all praise for Sreesanth at 

 a felicitation for the youngster. 

 I am sure, with this sort of role model to follow, 

 India will see a lot of good cricketers coming from this 

 part of the country, he said.

 Coach Greg Chappell, who was also present, said, It 

 is a pleasure see him bowl. I wish him all success and hope 

 the rest of his career will be a long one.

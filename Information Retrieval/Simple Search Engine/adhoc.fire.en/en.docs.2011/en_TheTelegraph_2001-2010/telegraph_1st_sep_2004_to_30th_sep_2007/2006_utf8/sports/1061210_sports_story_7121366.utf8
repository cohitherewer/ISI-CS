Doha: It was a night of disappointment at the tennis court as Chinese Taipei beat India 2-1 to win the womens team gold. 

On Friday, the Indian expatriates here waited patently for 10 hours for the rain to stop and watch Sania Mirza guide India to the gold. 

The weathergod relented, but not the Chinese Taipei team. They turned out to be talented enough to even nullify the Sania factor. She did win her singles match with ease, but in the deciding doubles, she was all at sea. The vociferous support that Sania and Shikha Uberoi got from the stands was not enough as the Chinese Taipei duo of Chia Jung Chuang and Su Wei Hsieh prevailed 7-6, 6-1 well past midnight. 

The way Sania was greeted when she stepped on to the court for her singles after Shikha lost the opener to Su Wei Shieh 2-6, 5-7 would have made even top filmstars envious. There were loud cheers from all around when she raised her right hand and put on that familiar smile. 

With Shikha Uberoi having a poor day, Sania was left with too much to do. In singles, Shikha did make some effort in the second set, but it was a lost cause by that time. In doubles, she looked a sleeping partner. 

From the Indian point of view, Sanias single match was the only talking point. Against Chan Yung Jan, she was at her brilliant best with some great forehand strokes and passing shots. The Chinese Taipei girl had to no clue whatsoever and lost 2-6, 2-6. 

On Saturday, there was once again a big crowd at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex to watch Sania play in the mixed doubles with Leander Paes. The Indian duo won 6-1, 6-3 against their Uzbekistan rivals. 

Mahesh Bhupathi and Shikha, though, bowed 4-6, 4-6 to the Thai pair of S. Ratiwatana and S. Viratprasert. 

In mens singles, eighth seed Rohan Bopanna lost 3-6, 3-6 to Chinas Peng Sun. Bopanna then teamed up with Mustafa Ghouse to beat Bahrains Abdulrahaman Shehab and Abdul Latif Mohammed 6-2, 6-1. 

After a tremendous show by shooters at the Lusail Shooting Range till Friday, the archers disappointed at the same venue in the FITA rounds. In mens section, Tarundeep Rai produced the best effort with a seventh finish. The rest, both men and women, finished below 10 th. 

In womens hockey, India went down 0-2 to Japan. They have an outside chance of making the semis if they manage to beat South Korea by a big margin and take full points from China.

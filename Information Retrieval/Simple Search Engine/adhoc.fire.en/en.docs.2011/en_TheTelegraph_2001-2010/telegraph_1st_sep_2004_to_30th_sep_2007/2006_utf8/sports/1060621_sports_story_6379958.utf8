 We need to be cynical, says Cannavaro

Duisburg: Captain Fabio Cannavaro said the Azzurri needed to return to traditional cynical Italian football if they wanted to succeed in the World Cup. 

We have to start to be the cynical Italians, he told a news conference on Tuesday. 

The secret of going a long way in the tournament is to ... Rediscover some of the typical defensive approach found in Italian football culture. 

Italy go into Thursdays final game in Group E against Czech Republic in Hamburg needing a point to secure their passage to the second round. Marcello Lippis side lead the group with four points, one more than the Czechs and Ghana, while the United States are bottom with one point. 

Cannavaro said Italy would not be settling for a point against the Czechs. 

Looking at the numbers, we obviously have an advantage over the other teams, but we wont let that influence us. We will go out to win, he said. 

The Italians won their opening game against Ghana 2-0 before being held to a 1-1 draw by the United States. 

Cannavaro said the Czechs were a team who merited full respect. 

They are made up of players we know well and they are a proud and experienced team. We have watched videos of them, they break very quickly on counter-attack. We cant allow them space because they are very dangerous when they have room to play, he added. 

Defender Cannavaro said Juventus teammate Pavel Nedved would be the main threat from the Czechs.

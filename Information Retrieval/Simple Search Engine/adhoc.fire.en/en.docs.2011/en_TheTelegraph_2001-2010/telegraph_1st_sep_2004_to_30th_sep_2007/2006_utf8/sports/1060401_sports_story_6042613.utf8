 Jayasuriya to quit Tests after Pak series 

 Sanath Jayasuriya 

Colombo: Sri Lankas Sanath Jayasuriya has announced that he will retire from Test cricket after the second Test against Pakistan in Kandy. 

The 36-year-old left-hander, Sri Lankas highest run scorer in both forms of the game, handed over a letter to the national selectors on Friday confirming his decision. 

I thought hard and decided this was the best time to go. It is a very emotional moment, but I guess every good thing has to come to an end, the 36-year-old left-handed opener said. 

Jayasuriya will continue to play one-day Internationals until the 2007 World Cup before completely retiring from international cricket. 

Jayasuriya was recently dropped for the first time in a decade for Sri Lankas Test series against India last November, but reclaimed his place for the Pakistan series. 

Stand in captain Mahela Jayawardene paid tribute to Jayasuriya. 

Sanaths contribution to cricket in Sri Lanka has been immense, Jayawardene said. 

His brilliant statistics tell only half the story ? he has been a match-winner on so many occasions with both bat and ball. 

We are all hoping that he will finish with a big one next week. 

Jayasuriya has played 101 Tests and scored 6599 runs at 41.76 since making his debut back in 1991 against New Zealand in Hamilton. His left-arm spin has fetched him 92 wickets in the longer form of the game. He replaced Arjuna Ranatunga as skipper in 1999 and quit captaincy in 2003. 

He achieved stardom when he pioneered the ultra-aggressive batting style to take advantage of the fielding restrictions in the one-dayers.

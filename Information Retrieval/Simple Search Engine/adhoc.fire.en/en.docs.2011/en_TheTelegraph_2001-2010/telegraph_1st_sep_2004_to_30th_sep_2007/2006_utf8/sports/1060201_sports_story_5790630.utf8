 Ponting, Bracken back

Sydney: Australia captain Ricky Ponting has been recalled to the squad for the remaining two one-day matches against South Africa. 

Ponting missed the world champions two previous games against Sri Lanka as part of the selectors rotational policy of giving all their players a rest at some stage during the series. 

Ponting replaced middle-order batsman Brad Hodge. Fast bowler Nathan Bracken also made a comeback to the 14-man squad after pulling out of the last game for personal reasons. 

Australia, already virtually assured of a place in the best-of-three final, play South Africa in Melbourne on Friday and in Sydney two days later.

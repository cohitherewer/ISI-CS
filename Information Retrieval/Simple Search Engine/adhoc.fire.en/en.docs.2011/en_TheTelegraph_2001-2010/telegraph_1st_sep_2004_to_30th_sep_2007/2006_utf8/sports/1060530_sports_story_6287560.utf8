 Klinsmann looking to leave a legacy 

Geneva: Juergen Klinsmann wants to leave a legacy for the German game and he knows failure at his home World Cup would destroy that chance. While other coaches at the June 9-July 9 tournament will be fighting to keep their jobs, the 41-year-old Klinsmann seems ambivalent about his future. 

What he really wants is to see his ideas on playing, coaching and preparation fully accepted and for that to happen he will have to get the team at least close to a fourth World Cup triumph. 

If Klinsmann is not there, there must be someone else who really continues this philosophy, the former striker told a small group of reporters at Germanys camp in Switzerland. 

The German football federation cannot just say OK, after Klinsmann this guy, or this guy comes. There should be a line that can be followed. But all the things that weve introduced will be measured by our success in the World Cup. 

Meanwhile, Michael Ballack could yet play a part in Germanys penultimate warm-up against Japan on Tuesday after making a pain-free return to training. (Reuters)

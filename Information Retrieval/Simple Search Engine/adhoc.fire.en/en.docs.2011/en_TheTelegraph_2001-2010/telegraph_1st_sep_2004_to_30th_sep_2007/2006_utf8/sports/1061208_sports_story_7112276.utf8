Christchurch: New Zealand dominated the first day of the opening Test against Sri Lanka, dismissing the touring side for 154 before reaching 85 for two at the close in Christchurch on Thursday. 

Sri Lanka collapsed after winning the toss, New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond taking three early wickets and seamer James Franklin claiming the same number of victims in the afternoon to put the touring side in deep trouble. 

New Zealand lost Jamie How (nought) and Mathew Sinclair (36) but Craig Cumming remained unbeaten on 37 with captain Stephen Fleming on seven. 

Bond had Sanath Jayasuriya caught by Fleming at first slip for five and Kumar Sangakkara taken by Sinclair at third slip for four to leave Sri Lanka reeling at 17 for two. 

Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene, on eight, pulled Bond straight into Franklins hands at fine leg to reduce the touring side to 37 for three. 

Opener Upul Tharanga batted throughout the first session in overcast conditions to be 27 not out at the interval, but he did not last long afterwards, well caught in the gully by How off Franklin for 33. 

Chamara Silva survived just three balls on his Test debut before he was bowled by Franklin for a duck and Chamara Kapugedera, on 37, was trapped leg-before by Franklin not offering a shot. 

Jacob Oram removed Chaminda Vaas for four, caught down the leg-side by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum, and Prasanna Jayawardene was neatly pouched low down by How at third slip off Chris Martin, the seamers 100th Test wicket. 

Fervez Mahroof briefly raised Sri Lankan spirits when he pulled Oram for a huge six but the New Zealand allrounder got his revenge with the next ball when the batsman, on 15, edged another catch to Fleming at first slip. 

Sri Lankas last-wicket pair of Muttiah Muralidharan and Lasith Malinga played a few attacking shots in a partnership of 22 before Muralidharan was caught by Nathan Astle at point off Martin for 14. 

Bond completed figures of three for 43, Franklin three for 30, Martin two for 37 and Oram two for 30. 

How fell in the second over to Malinga when the whippy seamer trapped him in front of his stumps, but Sinclair and Cumming added 70 for the second wicket before the former was caught one-handed by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off Vaas.

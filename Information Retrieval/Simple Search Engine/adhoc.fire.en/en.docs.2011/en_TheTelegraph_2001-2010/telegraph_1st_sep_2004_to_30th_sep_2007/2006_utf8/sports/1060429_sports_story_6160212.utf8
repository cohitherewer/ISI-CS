 Lara banks on exciting 

 group

 ODI series vs Zimbabwe

 St Johns: The West 

 Indies and Zimbabwe kick off their seven-match ODI series 

 here on Saturday at the Antigua Recreation Ground with plenty 

 to prove to themselves and the rest of the world.

 The West Indies, languishing at 

 No. 8 on the ICCs ODI rankings list, will be looking 

 to transform their fortunes in the shorter version of the 

 game in which they have won just three of their last 18 

 matches since lifting the ICC Champions Trophy in England 

 two years ago.

 Zimbabwe, ranked No. 9, are looking 

 to consolidate after having lost most of their top players 

 over the past year or two.

 West Indies captain Brian Lara 

 recognises the Champions Trophy triumph is just a memory 

 but is also optimistic of the future.

 I think we have to accept 

 our position in international cricket, that we are two or 

 three from the bottom in Tests and ODIs, and I think we 

 have to build a team accordingly that will allow us to climb 

 back to the top of world cricket, he said.

 I think the expectation 

 during these years of decline has been that some time we 

 will turn the corner and we will head right back up to the 

 top immediately. This has not come to fruition, but I think 

 what we have is a group of exciting players.

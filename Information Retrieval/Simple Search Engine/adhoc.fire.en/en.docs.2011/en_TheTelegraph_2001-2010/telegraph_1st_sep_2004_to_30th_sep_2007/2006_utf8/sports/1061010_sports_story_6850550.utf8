 HASC likely to take TFAs place

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: After months of speculations, the Tata Football Academy are finally out of the National Football League (NFL). They are likely to be replaced by the Hindustan Aeronautics Sports Club (HASC) of Bangalore. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has already written to all the executive committee members asking them about their opinion on the subject. 

In the same letter he has made a suggestion to accommodate HASC in place of TFA as the Bangalore team finished third behind TFA and Churchill Brothers in the second division NFL. 

While most of the members feel that it would be right to take HASC as NFL at the moment has no team from the southern part of the country, a section in the AIFF is believed to be trying to get Salgaocar back in the fold. Last year, the Goan side got relegated from the NFL. 

The problem is that NFL rules do not really specify what should be done in case a team withdraws from the competition at any point of time. The Salgaocar backers may put across this point to get the relegated side into the premier division. 

But with Das Munshi willing to take HASC, it would be interesting to watch how the Salgaocar fans in the AIFF reacts to it. 

TFA have finally withdrawn after failing to build up a professional side for the NFL as per AIFF advice. It has written to the AIFF that they either be allowed to play with their academy boys or be exempted from playing in the NFL premier division. 

With the AIFF not willing to allow TFA play with junior boys, the Jamshedpur outfit has decided not to take part.

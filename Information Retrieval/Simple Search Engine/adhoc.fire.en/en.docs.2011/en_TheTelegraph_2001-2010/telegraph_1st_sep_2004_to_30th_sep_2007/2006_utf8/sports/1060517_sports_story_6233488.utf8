 Sachin to consult Dr Wallace

Mumbai: Sachin Tendulkar will consult his surgeon Dr Andrew Wallace, who operated his shoulder, in London before proceeding to the West Indies if passed fit for the four Test rubber commencing on June 2. 

Whether he passes the fitness test or not, he is scheduled to leave for London on May 24 to consult his doctor. He would then proceed to the West Indies (or return home), Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said on Tuesday. 

The rest of the replacements for the Test series (from the one-day team which is already in the Caribbean) would leave on May 25, the BCCI secretary added. 

The proposed fitness test for Sachin has been put off by a few days and would be held on May 22 or 23, according to the BCCI secretary. 

Sachin had undergone a shoulder surgery in March.

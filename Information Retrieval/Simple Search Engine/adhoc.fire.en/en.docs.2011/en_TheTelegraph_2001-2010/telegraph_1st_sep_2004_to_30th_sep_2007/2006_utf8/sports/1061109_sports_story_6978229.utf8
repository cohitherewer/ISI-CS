The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Adieu, my friend, 

 Polly!

 Saluting a Great 

 Chandu Borde

 I was very close to Polly. He 

 used to call me Chan and not Chandu 

 like the others. We were chums and indulged in a lot of 

 leg-pulling during our times together. It helped us understand 

 each other and helped in bacted as some sort of a team building 

 effort though it was not planned.

 I remember one particular journey 

 together. It was from Calcutta to Mumbai by train which 

 used to take 40 hours those days. We were returning after 

 India had lost to the West Indies at the Eden in the 1959 

 series.

 When the train stopped at Bina, 

 we found a large gathering of fans at the station and were 

 surprised to see so many people to greet us even after our 

 defeat. They gave us a box of sweets which, on opening once 

 the train started leaving the station, was found to contain 

 ladies bangles. We had a hearty laugh over this.

 I vividly remember the incidents 

 on the 1962 tour of the West Indies, especially after the 

 unfortunate skull injury sustained by Nari (Contractor). 

 We all donated blood Polly, Bapu Nadkarni, Sir Frank Worrell 

 (the West Indies captain) and I. 

 We were all worried for Nari. 

 Dr Ford, who was attending on him was not a neuro surgeon. 

 But the situation was grim and he said if he were to back 

 down, it would be very difficult for Nari to survive as 

 paralysis had already set in on his left side. It was an 

 emergency.

 Our team manager, Ghulam Ahmed, 

 was desperately trying to contact people in India. Dr Ford 

 went ahead and performed the operation. And on the next 

 day came a neuro surgeon of Indian origin from, I think 

 Fiji, who appreciated the surgical skills of Ford and felt 

 the surgeries had been nicely done.

 It was in such a backdrop that 

 we played later in the series. We were all very scared to 

 face the West Indies fast bowlers. You have to remember 

 we were playing without helmets. Umrigar, a very mild-mannered 

 man, played a courageous knock of 172 in the fourth Test 

 in Port of Spain.

 People underrated his bowling 

 skills as he was not a big turner of the ball. But he used 

 to deliver the ball from a great height and got good bounce. 

 It was difficult to judge the trajectory of the ball that 

 came off his hand. He once got five wickets against Australia 

 with his off-breaks.

 The running between the wickets 

 when Umrigar was in a partnership with Vijay Manjrekar is 

 among my abiding memories. Polly was a very quick runner 

 and Vijay was not. There used to be several yes-nos and 

 we could feel the heat on the field. It was quite interesting 

 to watch.

 Another abiding memory is the 

 Madras Test of the 1958-59 series against the West Indies 

 when the team had four captains, one after the other. Polly 

 was named captain. We were given a civic reception before 

 the match and and then one of our players I think it was 

 C. D. Gopinath who fell sick and we needed a replacement.

 Polly insisted on (Mumbais) 

 Manohar Hardikar whose abilities as a batsman and skills 

 as an off-break bowler were well known. But the selection 

 committee insisted that Jasu Patel, who was in the standbyes, 

 should be the replacement. Polly was not ready to accept 

 this and stepped down from captaincy. It was a terrible 

 thing to happen to Polly and I saw him cry like a baby. 

 It was a sad thing to witness.

 Then Vinoo Mankad took over as 

 captain. He went for the toss and then had rashes all over 

 the body. G. S. Ramchand was named the captain but was hit 

 on the head during the Test and finally Col Hemu Adhikari 

 was told to lead the side.

 The partnership we had in the 

 Madras Test against Pakistan in 1960-61 would forever be 

 etched in my memory as it helped India save the match. We 

 put on 177 for the fifth wicket, Polly himself making 117. 

 We were under tremendous pressure and I dont know 

 what would have happened had we lost the match.

 We were in trouble after losing 

 two or three quick wickets. There had been some rain and 

 Pakistan offspinner Haseeb Ahsan, who had a doubtful action 

 and did not play much later, was turning the ball at right 

 angles.

 In the beginning we were cautious 

 before Polly started attacking him. It was amazing, the 

 way he handled that fellow. Our partnership helped us save 

 the match. A loss to Pakistan would have been terrible. 

 When I visited him ten days ago 

 at his residence along with Raj Singh Dungarpur, he remembered 

 that partnership very clearly and we talked about it with 

 tears in our eyes and with him holding my hand. I needled 

 him, saying he was selfish. I said you were hitting him 

 for fours, while asking me to take singles!

 Polly had been looking forward 

 to my visit, his daughter told me that day. I could see 

 the joy on his face when he saw me. It was a wonderful experience. 

 When I left, he told me Chan, come back again. 

 But there wont be another visit to see him.

 Polly was loved and respected 

 by all, even cricketers from other countries. I used to 

 call him Ajatshatru, meaning a man with no enemies.

 Adieu, my friend, Polly!

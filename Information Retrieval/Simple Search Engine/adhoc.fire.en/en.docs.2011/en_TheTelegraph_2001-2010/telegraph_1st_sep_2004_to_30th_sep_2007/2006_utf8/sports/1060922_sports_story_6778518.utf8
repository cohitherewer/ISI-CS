 PCB leaves out Zaheer

 Inzamam hearing

 Karachi: The PCB on Thursday 

 left former Test captain Zaheer Abbas in an embarrassing 

 position when it decided his presence was not required at 

 the ICC disciplinary hearing on September 27-28 in London.

 The hearing is to decide on charges 

 of ball tampering and bringing the game to disrepute against 

 captain Inzamam-ul Haq made by Australian umpire Darrell 

 Hair during the The Oval Test last month. Zaheer was the 

 manager of the team during the tour and his role has come 

 under criticism.

 A PCB official confirmed that 

 neither Zaheer nor Danish Kaneria and Umar Gul would be 

 going to London to attend the hearing. (PTI)

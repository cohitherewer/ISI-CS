The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Public view gains force 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: A strong public opinion has been building up against the RCTC stewards since some disclosures were made in these columns about the clubs funds-related issues. Horseowners, stand members and public in general, all had something to say on the issue.

 If a common punter is concerned about the smooth functioning of the inter-venue and expects the club to clear the BTC and RWITC dues on a priority basis, horseowners are aggrieved as to why the same yardstick is not applied while dealing with those who default in payment.

 We are handed a weeks notice if we default, but the big guns are not touched even for months. Why this disparity? asked an owner. The owner did not want to be identified. 

 Stand members expressed similar views on the issue and they also added that the club would have to refund their annual subscription if BTC and RWITC take an extreme stand on the inter-venue broadcast.

 Bimal Khemka, a big owner and also a stand member, is fearing a total closure. At the rate the club is going we might have to employ the horses, we own, for pulling tongas in Victoria; he said.

 Some of them also viewed that the proposed sale of the D.L.Khan Road property may be having a direct relation with the royalty-broadcast and the state government dues. 

 The dues may have been deliberately held back for a quick disposal of the property at a throwaway price; said an owner. The dues run into about Rs 2.5 crore. 

 Most of the senior members expect accountability from the stewards. RCTC should take an urgent step in controlling and bringing transparency in financial dealings. It may help them achieve dynamism to bring back the past glory; said Gautam Sengupta, ex-secretary of Calc-utta Racehorse Owners Society.

 Meanwhile, the stewards have decided to hold an urgent meeting on Wednesday to discuss a few issues, raised by the club members last Sunday.

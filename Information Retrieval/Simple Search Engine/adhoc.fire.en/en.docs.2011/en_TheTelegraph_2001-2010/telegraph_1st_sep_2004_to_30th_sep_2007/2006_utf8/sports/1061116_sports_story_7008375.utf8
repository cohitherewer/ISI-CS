The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rajesh seeks a date with Sourav

A STAFF REPORTER

 Rajesh Sharma has taken 7 wickets in the final so far 

Calcutta: On a pitch where spinners like Rangana Herath, Jeham Mubarak and Chamara Silva failed to reap benefits, North Zone offie Rajesh Sharma has shown how to reap the maximum benefits. The off-spinner himself doesnt want to lose the opportunity to meet former India captain Sourav Ganguly for some valuable tips. 

Sourav told me in Guwahati that if I keep performing like this, I will get a national call-up within one year, which is my dream, Sharma told The Telegraph after the fourth days proceedings on Wednesday. 

Sharma, who had decided to meet Sourav for tips, is however, trying to find an opportunity. I have been trying to meet him since the last three days but he hasnt come yet Anyway tomorrow either I will talk to him over the phone or meet him in person, Sharma said after returning figures of 31-10-81-3. 

It has been learnt that Sourav had specifically told him how to read the wicket and bowl accordingly during East-North Duleep Trophy match in Guwahati. Dada asked me to read the wicket in first few overs and then plan my deliveries, which I am following here too, Sharma stated. 

With Harbhajan Singh currently on national duty, Jalandhar has come up with yet another offie. Sharma idolises Harbhajan and likes to bowl like him in the years to follow. Harbhajan and I practise together whenever he gets time and have learnt a lot from him, Sharma confessed. 

On how he managed to extract turn and bounce on this wicket, Sharma seemed relaxed. On the fourth and fifth day, it is easier for a spinner to bowl and also I bowled to my strengths which paid dividends, Sharma remarked. 

Meanwhile, Ashish Nehra was satisfied with his bowling though he didnt get any wicket on the penultimate day of the Duleep Trophy final.

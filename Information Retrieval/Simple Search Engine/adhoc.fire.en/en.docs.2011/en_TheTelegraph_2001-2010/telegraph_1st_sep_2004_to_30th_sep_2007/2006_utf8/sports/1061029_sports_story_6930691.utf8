 No cause for Pak to panic: Iqbal

 - There are lessons to learn from Lloyds stint with WI

Ahmedabad: Former captain Asif Iqbal isnt surprised by Pakistans early exit in the Champions Trophy and feels the players shouldnt lose heart. 

I thought they did well without Inzamam-ul Haq. Theres no hiding the fact that Inzy has a tremendous influence on the side. Then they had to absorb the Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammed Asif shock Under the circumstances, the performance wasnt bad, Asif told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

The London-based Asif, who spends most of his time with his grandchildren, is here on a commentary assignment with a Pakistani FM channel. 

Theres no cause for Pakistan to panic. It will just be a matter of time regaining confidence, he added. 

Asif blamed the Mohali wicket for the defeat to South Africa Friday night. The wicket is a bad example for one-day cricket. It was heavily loaded in favour of the bowlers. There has got to be a balance somewhere 

South Africa, too, faced problems during batting. They were reduced to 42 for five They recovered from there because Pakistan didnt have the back-up bowlers. On the other hand, Makhaya Ntini broke the backbone of the Pakistan innings Once you are reduced to 47 for eight, you stand little chance, he explained. 

He feels the outcome of the India-Australia match will be determined by the nature of the wicket. 

If you guys have a wicket like yesterday, you had itIt will be hugely unfair if a similar wicket is provided. Somebody down the line has to take the responsibility. 

Asif didnt wish to pick any favourites for the tournament. 

All teams are evenly matched. It all depends on who one performs on a given day. New Zealand have been performing well, and so have South Africa. Its difficult to pick any one side. 

He is surprised that none of the teams from the sub-continent has made the semi-finals so far. I was a bit surprised by Sri Lankas performance. Im also surprised by the way the media has been critical of Bob Woolmer and Greg Chappell. 

When the team wins the players get the accolades. No praise is reserved for the coach. But when the side loses, the coach gets all the blame while the players go away scot-free. The responsibility for the debacle should be shared by both, he explained. 

According to him, the West Indies resurgence in this tournament cannot be ignored. Remember they are the defending champions. They are doing justice to their reputation and playing as a unit. Laras leadership has been inspiring. Similarly, Clive Lloyds influence has also made an impact. He is respected by all and the way he has motivated the boys is showing on the field, said Asif. 

He also pointed out that both India and Pakistan can learn a few lessons from the way West Indies experiment with Lloyd has clicked.

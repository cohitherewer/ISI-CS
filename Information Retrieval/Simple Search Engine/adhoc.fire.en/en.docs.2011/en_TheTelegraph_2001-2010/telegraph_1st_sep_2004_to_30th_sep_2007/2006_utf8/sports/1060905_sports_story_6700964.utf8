Calcutta: Dont be surprised if you find Jhulan Goswami bowling at the Bengal nets after the CAB team returns from the Moin-ud-Dowlah meet Hyderabad. 

The mediumpacer may be called to test her skills against the men who will continue with their preparations for the Ranji Trophy. 

We are open to the idea. The BCCI has already asked us to coordinate and help the womens wing in every possible way. 

She did well in England and deserves praise We will speak to her. She can always help the team as a net bowler, a senior CAB functionary said. 

Jhulan is ready for such a duel. I will be there once I hear from them, she said. 

Meanwhile, the CAB is planning to allot some of the Vizzy Trophy matches to Asansol, Bardhaman and Burnpur in the ensuing season. The A.N. Ghosh Trophy matches may be held in Kalyani. 

A inspection of venues will take place shortly before the final decision is arrived at.

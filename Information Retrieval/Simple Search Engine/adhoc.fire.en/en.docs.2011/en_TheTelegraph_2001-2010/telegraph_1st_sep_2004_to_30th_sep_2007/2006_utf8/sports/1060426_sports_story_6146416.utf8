 Asian bid has been weakened, says Mani

Karachi: The delay in submission of the compliance book has weakened the Asian blocs bid to host the 2011 World Cup, a top International Cricket Council (ICC) official said on Tuesday. 

Their (Asias) case weakened because of late submission of the compliance book. Nevertheless, if Asia doesnt win the right for the 2011 World Cup, I am sure they would get the 2015 World Cup, ICC president Ehsan Mani said. 

India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have made a joint bid to host the quadrennial extravaganza, while Australia and New Zealand have the right by turn to hold the crickets flagship event in 2011. The host will be decided by vote on Sunday. 

Mani said it would be premature to speculate which country enjoyed the advantage. The voting would be done from 13 countries, and seven votes are required to win the rights. 

Asia already has four votes, and they require another three. But Australia and New Zealands bid is also strong and 100 per cent complete. They have also guaranteed 100 per cent tax exemptions, Mani said. 

Australia and New Zealand have last hosted the World Cup in 1992, while Asia held the event in 1987 and 1996. According to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) sources, the ICC might suffer a loss of $ 100 million in sponsorships in case the event is staged outside Asia. 

The Indian sponsors will still sponsor the World Cup if held Down Under, but it would be $100 million less. 

The ICC Champions Trophy was also not taken away from India after the sponsors threatened to pull out or reduce their sponsorships substantially, an insider said. 

All the five major sponsors of the ICC are from India. 

Mani said Asia had promised tax exemptions from their respective governments for the event. 

We have received Asias compliance book and I have been told that they have also guaranteed tax exemptions, the ICC chief said. 

ICC has faced problems with tax exemptions for the Champions Trophy from India and it required personal convincing by Mani and Malcolm Speed to get the event going. 

The ICC Champions Trophy will be played in October this year.

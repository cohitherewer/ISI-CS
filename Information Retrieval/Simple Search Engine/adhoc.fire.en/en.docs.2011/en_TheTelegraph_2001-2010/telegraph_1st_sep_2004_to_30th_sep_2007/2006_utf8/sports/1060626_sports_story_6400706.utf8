Basseterre: The WICB and the players association have settled their recent row by finalising contracts for the ongoing series against India as well as retainer contracts for some of the players. WICB chief cricket operations officer Zorol Barthley said an official announcement in this regard would be made soon. 

What I want to say is that for this home series against India, we are operating on a match tour contract, Barthley said.

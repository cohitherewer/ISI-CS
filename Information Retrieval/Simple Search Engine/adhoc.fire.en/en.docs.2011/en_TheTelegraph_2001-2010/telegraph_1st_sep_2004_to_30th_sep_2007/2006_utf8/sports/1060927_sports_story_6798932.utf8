The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourashish seeks advice from Sourav 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri was ecstatic on his being selected for the India Green side in the Challenger Trophy. I cannot express my feeling in words. This is the first time I have been selected for the premier tournament, Lahiri said. 

The offie is more happy because of the fact that former India captain Sourav Ganguly will be there in the same team with him. It is a huge bonus to have Dada in the same team, Lahiri said. He had already telephoned Sourav and sought advice from him. He has already pointed out a few things which I will keep in mind. Im going to meet him tomorrow and well have a detailed discussion in this regard, Lahiri said on Tuesday. 

Lahiri, who had picked up 39 wickets in nine matches in the Ranji Trophy 2005-06 season and has 172 first-class wickets in his kitty, is ready for the big test. I am waiting eagerly to bowl at Indias top-class performers in Chennai, he remarked. 

According to the off-spinner, he will focus on his own job rather than thinking about his competitors like Ramesh Powar or lesser-known C. Raghu of Karnataka. I will concentrate on my job and wont be looking at what the others do, he signed off.

 John Gloster prescribes rest for Kumble 

Mumbai: Anil Kumble, who suffered a shoulder injury during his stint with Surrey, has been advised rest from cricket by team physio John Gloster. 

John Gloster had been to London and examined Kumbles shoulder and he feels that some rest would do the trick, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said on Friday. 

The ace leg spinner was diagnosed with tendonitis in his right shoulder which forced him to cut short his County engagements. 

Asked whether the shoulder trouble will rule Kumble out of possible selection in the 14-member Indian team for the ICC Champions Trophy, Shah said, No, because theres still time for the tournament to start. 

Kumble, though not in the one-day scheme of things of late, has been included in the probables list of 30 for the Champions Trophy. 

The final 14-member team for the ICC tournament will be chosen on September 3 along with the squad for the tri-series in Malaysia scheduled from September 12-24.

Shanghai: World No. 1 Roger Federer routed American James Blake 6-0, 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win the Masters Cup for the third time in four years. 

The Swiss was beaten by David Nalbandian in last years final, but there was no upset this time as he mercilessly took apart the man who will end the year as the fourth best player in the world for his 12th title of the season. 

Its quite incredible to finish off by winning the Masters Cup, the world championship so to speak, said Federer. Its obviously a perfect end to an incredible season. I had to laugh at one stage I was playing so well, everything I tried today worked. 

Blake had 11 break-points. Federer, however, glided around the court to save all but one of them and clinched the year-ending championship in just an hour and 37 minutes. The 2003 and 2004 champion was unbeaten in the tournament so added $1.52 million to his years haul to become the first player to earn more than $8 million in a season with a total of $8,343,885. Federer extended his winning streak to 29 matches and also set a new high for ranking points held at any time by a player with 8,370. 

He has accumulated enough ranking points to ensure that he will break Jimmy Connors record of 160 consecutive weeks as world No. 1 on February 26 next year. 

Swede Jonas Bjorkman and Belarussian partner Max Mirnyi won the doubles title with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over on Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor. It was the 34-year-old Bjorkmans 50th career doubles title.

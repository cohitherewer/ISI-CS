The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2 selectors to skip tie

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Three of the five selectors Dilip Vengsarkar, Venkatapathy Raju and Sanjay Jagdale will be present here for the Duleep Trophy final from Sunday. 

Bhupinder Singh and Ranjib Biswal have informed the CAB that they wont be able to make it. Biswal, incidentally, is down with fever. 

It has been learnt that chief selector Vengsarkar will reach only on Sunday night and therefore, will miss the first days action.

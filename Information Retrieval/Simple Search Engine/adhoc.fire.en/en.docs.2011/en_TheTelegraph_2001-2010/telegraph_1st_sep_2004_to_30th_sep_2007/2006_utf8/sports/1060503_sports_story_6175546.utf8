 Jeev paired with Choi

Seoul: Jeev Milkha Singh, the leader on the UBS Order of Merit, returns to the Asian Tour for the $600,000 SK Telecom Open this week, as the Japan Tour takes a week-long break. 

Jeev, who won the Volvo China Open three weeks ago and was tied 10th last week at the Crowns International in Japan, has been paired in the marquee group with defending champion Choi Kyung-Ju of Korea and Jan Ik Jae. 

Other two Indians in the fray are Amandeep Johl, who was tied third at the Maekyung Open last week, and Harmeet Kahlon, whose struggle with his form continues this season. 

By far the biggest draw and attention is Michelle Wie, the hottest thing in womens golf. She is slated to take on the men for an eighth time here. 

Jeev has decided to use this week to cement his position on Asian Order of Merit, as he is set to shift his focus to Japan and Europe. 

I want to play in some big events in Europe and see if I can make it to the British Open, said Jeev. 

Johl said, I had a good week in Maekyung, so this week should be something to look forward to. (PTI)

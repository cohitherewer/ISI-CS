 Woods takes 13-point lead

 Golf Rankings

 London: Tiger Woods took 

 an unprecedented 13-point lead at the top of the world rankings 

 issued on Monday after his win at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

 The 30-year-old American streaked 

 clear of world number two Phil Mickelson after defeating 

 countryman Stewart Cink at the fourth playoff hole in Ohio 

 on Sunday.

 American Will MacKenzie climbed 

 271 places to 211th after winning the Reno-Tahoe Open, his 

 maiden victory on the PGA Tour.

 Meanwhile, The United States Ryder 

 Cup team arrived on Monday for two days of practice at The 

 K Club, hoping to end its slump in golfs top team 

 event.

 The Europeans have won four of 

 the last five Ryder Cups. The Americans, with Woods playing, 

 hope to end the streak when the three-day event begins on 

 September 22.

 Whether it sends a strong 

 message or not, our whole deal is to come together, gain 

 experience, gain some knowledge on the golf course and be 

 ready to play come time for the cup, Woods said.

 Woods, who won the Bridgestone 

 Invitational on Sunday in Akron, Ohio, arrived on a charter 

 with the other American players and captain Tom Lehman. 

 The winner of four straight tournaments, Woods has played 

 the course outside Dublin several times. Others on the team 

 have never played there.

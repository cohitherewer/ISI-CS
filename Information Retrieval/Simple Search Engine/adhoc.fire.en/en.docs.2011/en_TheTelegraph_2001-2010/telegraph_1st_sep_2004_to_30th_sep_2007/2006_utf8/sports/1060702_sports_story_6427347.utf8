Kingston: India had the West Indies on the rack after reducing them to 80 for five at lunch on the second day of the fourth and final Test at Sabina Park here Saturday. 

Sreesanth breathed fire as he gave India early breakthroughs. The young Kerala medium-pacer had opener Chris Gayle (0) in his very first over and later accounted for Brian Lara (26). 

 At 2.35 am, India were struggling at 63/4 in their 

 second innings. Wasim Jaffer, Virender Sehwag, V.V.S. Laxman 

 and Yuvraj Singh were back in the pavilion. Earlier, Harbhajan 

 Singh took five for 13 to skittle out the West Indies for 

 103 shortly after lunch on Day II. India took a first-innings 

 lead of 97 runs. 

India were given the right start as Sreesanth slipped one past Gayle in his opening over which didnt bounce to the batsmans expectations. 

Lara strode on to wicket instead of Ramnaresh Sarwan who is still nursing his injured left knee and showed his intent straightaway. He was riled early by a vocal Sreesanth but quickly gained control with some superlative strokeplay. 

Lara began with a thunderous pull and then picked up two fours off successive balls. Lara then shifted attention to Anil Kumble and first flicked and then straight drove him for boundaries. Even as Lara began to take the attack to India, Sreesanth produced a delivery which bounced from a good length and took the edge of Laras bat into the hands of Wasim Jaffer at gully. 

Sreesanth was given an extended spell of eight overs and could have had his third victim but Marlon Samuels was put down by Jaffer at third slip. 

Samuels though didnt last long. He played forward to Kumble and was easily stumped by Dhoni. India had another success when Shivnarine Chanderpaul (10) drove at a widish delivery from Munaf Patel and gave a simple catch to Dhoni. 

Daren Ganga though kept his cool from the other end and produced several sumptuous flicks and drives. However, he was dismissed by Harbhajan Singh in his very first over.

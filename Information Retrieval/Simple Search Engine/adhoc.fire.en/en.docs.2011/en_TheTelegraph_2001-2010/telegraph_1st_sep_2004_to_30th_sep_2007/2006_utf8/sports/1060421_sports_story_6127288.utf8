 Quick Takes

 Tickets sold on black market to be 

 cancelled

 Frankfurt: Fans who sell 

 World Cup tickets on the black market will find their transactions 

 vetoed by the German soccer federation (DFB) after a court 

 ruling on Thursday. The issue reached a Frankfurt regional 

 court after a fan bought two tickets online in September 

 for 880 euros ($1,087), eight times their original price.

 The DFB has vowed to fight black 

 market sales and refused to transfer the tickets to the 

 name of the new buyer. This prompted the original ticket-holder 

 to file a lawsuit against the federation. 

 The court ruled in favour of the 

 DFB. It said the original ticket-holder could have returned 

 the tickets if he did not want them. Resales are now conducted 

 via an official website, something that was not available 

 at the time of the disputed transaction discussed in Frankfurt.

 Only the person named on each 

 ticket will be allowed access to the stadiums when the month-long 

 World Cup kicks off on June 9, for security reasons. 

 Belgians, Dutch plan joint 

 bid

 Amsterdam: The Netherlands 

 and Belgian football associations are to study the possibility 

 of making a joint bid to stage the 2018 World Cup. Representatives 

 of both associations agreed this week to finish the feasibility 

 study by the end of the year.

 This only can work if we 

 all work together, Dutch association (KNVB) director 

 Henk Kessler told Dutch agency ANP. 

 Belgium and the Netherlands jointly 

 staged the 2000 European Championship.

 Foreign chants

 London: England soccer 

 fans are being encouraged to learn the German versions of 

 well known football chants before the World Cup. 

 In its package of travel tips 

 for fans at the month-long tournament, the Foreign Office 

 is to provide handy sing along translations on its website 

 www.britishembassyworldcup.com.

 A leading British tabloid stepped 

 eagerly into the breach with a two-page World Cup song sheet. 

 Inevitably that included a translation of 5-1, 5-1 

 ? Englands winning margin against Germany in a World 

 Cup qualifying match in 2001. 

 Suit against Fifa

 New York: MasterCard said 

 on Thursday it had filed a complaint in the US District 

 Court seeking an injunction against Fifa from moving forward 

 with an agreement with Visa to sponsor the 2010 and 2014 

 World Cups. (Reuters)

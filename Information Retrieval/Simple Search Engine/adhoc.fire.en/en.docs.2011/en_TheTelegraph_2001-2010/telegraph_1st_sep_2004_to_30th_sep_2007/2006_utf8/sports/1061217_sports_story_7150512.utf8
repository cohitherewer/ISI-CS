The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Not in the right spirit: Dutt

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The response from the sporting fraternity to Jagmohan Dalmiyas expulsion was a mixture of shock and restraint. The Telegraph spoke to a few personalities. The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

SAMBARAN BANERJEE: I dont know the real story exactly so it would be wrong on my behalf to react. However, what I want to say is Bengal cricket must go on. Nothing should stop our state cricket from going ahead. I have nothing against anybody. 

SUBHAS CHAKRABORTY: His expulsion is nothing but a conspiracy. I wont say anything more now. 

BISWANATH DUTT: I dont know if there is an element of vengeance involved, but I cannot accept the way Dalmiya has been expelled. I am not at all happy with the way things have turned out Ive been in sports administration for 56 years but have never seen this before. This is not in the right spirit. 

Dalmiyas contribution to the game cannot be denied. The ruling group should have waited till the court came out with a verdict in the misappropriation case. If they wanted to punish him for not appearing before the disciplinary committee they should have warned him. This decision is tantamount to hanging and I cant accept it. 

PRANAB ROY: Its unfortunatea blot on he state association. Dalmiya has been at the helm for almost 20 years nowNobody will accept the decision since he has done such a great job for cricket in the state and country. Now he should try to protect his name by asking for a stay order.

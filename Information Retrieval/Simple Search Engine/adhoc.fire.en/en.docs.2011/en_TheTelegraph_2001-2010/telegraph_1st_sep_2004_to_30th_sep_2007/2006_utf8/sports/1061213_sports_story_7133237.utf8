 Malaysia to protest alleged fixing

Kuala Lumpur: Malaysia, ousted on goal difference from the mens hockey competition at the Asian Games, have decided to protest the alleged fixing of the match between Pakistan and Japan that knocked them out of the semis. 

Coach Wallace Tan and team manager Nur Azmi Ahmad have told a Malaysian newspaper that they would lodge a protest via the Olympic Council of Malaysia against the fixing of the group A match. 

Pakistan and Japan draw their last group match 0-0 on Sunday, which eliminated the Busan Games bronze medallists on goal difference. 

Everybody saw the match between Pakistan and Japan. When they played against us, Japan created many short corner opportunities, which showed they were attacking. The same was for Pakistan. So, we have to change this attitude, otherwise it is like match-fixing is being allowed, Nur Azmi was quoted as saying by the paper. Hong Kong too fielded their reserve goalkeeper against Pakistan and they conceded 10 goals. 

Nur Azmi said that even the managers of the Indian and Chinese squads watching the Pakistan-Japan tie felt that it was a fixed contest. (PTI)

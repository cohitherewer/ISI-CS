 EB overcome CPT 3-1

A STAFF REPORTER

 CFL Premier Division 

Calcutta: It was not a cakewalk, but East Bengal still managed a 3-1 victory over Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) in their Sahara CFL Premier Division match on Wednesday. 

Apart from the four goals, Alvito DCunhas red card was the other highlight of the match. By virtue of this win, East Bengal 

East Bengal shot into the lead in the fourth minute when an Alvito free-kick fooled the CPT wall. The goalie was found out of position. The red-and-golds bolstered their lead in the 27th minute when a Dipankar Roy cross was volleyed in by Saumik Dutta. 

With a 2-0 cushion in the first half, East Bengal regrouped and launched attacks with more sting. The frontrunners made it 3-0 when Fredy Mascarenhas grounder bulged the netting. 

Alvito, who could have easily walked away with the best players award, was booked for the second time in the match and was sent off. 

Taking advantage of that, Calcutta Port Trust pulled one back in the 62nd minute through Sujit Dey, who tapped home a Rajat Ghosh Dastidar fumble. Rajat failed grip Tapan Maitys long ranger. 

Sujit now holds the distinction of scoring against all three big teams in the ongoing league.

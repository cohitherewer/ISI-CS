 Baros future hangs in balance

 - Injury checklist 

 - Gattuso still in doubt for tie vs US 

 Baros

Westerburg: Czech Republic striker Milan Baros was ruled out of Saturdays match against Ghana, and doctors will decide if he will again be able to play at the World Cup. 

Baros strained a tendon in his left foot in his teams final warm-up match against Trinidad and Tobago on June 3. Since the team arrived in Germany a few days later, he has trained once after taking painkillers. 

On Tuesday, Baros was examined in Duisburg by a doctor from Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund, and a small amount of an unspecified liquid was found in his foot, Czech team physician, Jiri Fousek, said. 

Fousek said it was not immediately clear if the liquid appeared because the foot was not healing properly or if it was due to the painkillers he took Sunday. He added that Baros had no chance of playing on Saturday. 

Im 100 per cent sure, he said. 

Czech doctors plan to consult another German specialist. 

Its not hopeless were trying other things, Fousek said. Another Czech team physician, Petr Krejci, said they were trying to shorten the healing process. 

 Gattuso 

Of course, we dont want to harm the player, Krejci said. Well issue a definitive verdict about Baros on Monday after another scan. 

Baros loss is a blow for the Czechs, who also lost first-choice striker Jan Koller in their opening 3-0 win over the US in Gelsenkirchen on Monday. 

Before he was taken off on a stretcher, the 6-foot-7 striker headed the opening goal in the Czechs win. 

Koller will likely be replaced by Vratislav Lokvenc, who was used by coach Karel Bruckner on Monday after Koller strained his right hamstring. 

Krejci said Koller was more likely to recover sooner. The prognosis is better (for Koller), he added. 

Koller could play in the last 16 games. 

Koller himself also said the knock-out stages were a realistic target for his return. I could make the last 16, but its up to my team to qualify. 

Italy midfielder Gennaro Gattuso had another medical exam on his torn right thigh muscle and remains questionable for Saturdays match against the United States. 

Gattuso is improving day by day and were simply monitoring the situation, Italy team physician Enrico Castellacci said in Duisburg on Wednesday. 

Gattuso missed Italys first match, a 2-0 win over Ghana on Monday. 

He trained with the team Wednesday but Castellacci said it would be up to Italy coach Marcello Lippi to decide when he will be ready to play. 

Francisco Fonsecas gripes about a lack of playing time made him the target of Mexico coach Ricardo Lavolpes wrath. 

Meanwhile, with Jared Borgetti out with a muscle tear in his left thigh ? possibly for the rest of the first round ? forward Francisco Fonseca could find himself in Lavolpes starting line-up for the teams next game. 

Borgetti, Mexicos leading career scorer with 38 international goals, was injured while chasing down a loose ball early in the second half of El Tris Cup opener, a 3-1 victory over Iran on Sunday. 

A scan on Tuesday revealed the tear, which is expected to keep the 33-year-old Bolton striker out eight to 10 days.

 Tokyo: Eight-time European No. 1 Colin Montgomerie will take on Michelle Wie at next months Casio World Open, organisers said on Tuesday. The 43-year-old Scot tees up at the Champions Tournament in Shanghai next week in the official start to the 2006-07 European season before taking part in the November 23-27 tournament in Kochi, western Japan.

 Montgomerie finished ninth on this years European order of merit and has been confirmed alongside Wie and rising Australian talent Won-joon Lee, who turns professional next month. Honolulu schoolgirl Wie narrowly failed to make the cut at last years Casio World Open when she bogeyed the final two holes and walked off the 18th green in tears.

 Bangkok: Japans Naomichi Joe Ozaki has been named captain of the Asian team for the Royal Trophy against Europe in Bangkok from January 12-14, organisers said on Tuesday. The veteran, who has notched up 35 Tour victories since turning professional 29 years ago, topped a list of high-profile candidates to lead the team in the second edition of the matchplay event.

 Ozaki, 50, will choose an eight-man team to face a European side headed by Seve Ballesteros, who led them to a 9-7 victory in January this year. Both are non-playing captains and are expected to name their teams next month.

 Abidjan: Ivory Coast have made a fresh bid to persuade Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou to commit his international future to the country by naming him in a 24-man squad for the friendly against Sweden. German coach Uli Stielike, who will be taking charge of his second match for Ivory Coast, named 24 players on Tuesday for the November 15 game in Le Mans, France.

 The Ivorian-born Kalou has previously turned down overtures but the west Africans renewed their efforts after the striker had a bid to obtain Dutch citizenship turned down. His older brother Bonaventure has been restored to the squad after being dropped in an African Nations Cup qualifier earlier this month.

 Caracas: United States and Mexico will take part in next years Copa America as guests, host nation Venezuela has said. The two teams will join the 10 members of the South American Football Confederation (CSF) in the three-week event. The US have participated in two previous Copa America tournaments in 1993 and 1995, reaching the semi-finals on the latter occasion. Mexico have competed in every Copa America since 1993 when guests were first invited. They were beaten finalists in 1993 and 2001.

 Barcelona: Real Madrid captain Raul has backed the club in the decision to fine and ban Antonio Cassano from training with the rest of the team for insulting coach Fabio Capello after last weekends victory over Gimnastic. Its a matter for the club and you have to accept the rules of the internal code of behaviour, Raul said. I think we have to work hard for one another, be humble and work to the same objective and be aware that we are at a great club.

 Italy striker Cassano was given the punishment for what the club termed as an act of indiscipline showing a lack of respect to the coach.

 Istanbul: Six players and a member of the support backroom staff of Turkish second division leaders Alanyaspor were injured when they were struck by lightning at the training ground on Tuesday. Two of the players were seriously hurt and remained unconscious.

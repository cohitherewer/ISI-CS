The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 If you dont believe in yourself, nobody will

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 - Nobody is bigger than the game... Certainly not me, says 

 Pollock 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: After 11 years of international cricket, Shaun Polly Pollock has much to show. In fact, hes only the fourth (after Sir Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev and Shane Warne) to score 3,000-plus runs and take over 400 Test wickets. In ODIs, hes close to 3,000 runs and has 350-plus wickets. Clearly, the 33-year-old is South Africas pride. Married (to Tricia) with two daughters, Jemma and Georgia, the senior-most Protean pro spoke to The Telegraph in the lead-up to the second Test. Kingsmead, incidentally, is Pollocks home ground. 

 The following are excerpts 

 On being the senior-most 

 pro 

 I still had a lot of energy after 

 the captaincy was taken away (following South Africas 

 early exit in the 2003 World Cup)... I wanted to stay involved 

 and it was important to transfer that energy somewhere... 

 Im comfortable just being a senior... I offer advice 

 to the young guys... Keep them on their toes... Indeed, 

 Ive put my energy towards developing this team on 

 the right lines... Its a role which has come easily. 

 On the time it took getting used to not 

 being captain

 It took some time, for Id 

 been involved with the planning... Interacting with the 

 Media... My opinion counted a lot... It did take some time... 

 After a while, however, I realised Id begun as a player 

 and was back to being one... I learnt to do things (as a 

 player only) all over again... Concentrated on my game and, 

 to the extent possible, helped the team. 

 On whether adverse public opinion (given that the 

 World Cup was primarily a South African show) led to his 

 removal 

 Dont think so... The selectors 

 decided to move forward... Of course, were a proud 

 nation and Im a proud cricketer... The early elimination 

 was a huge blow... Having said that, nobody likes to lose... 

 The selectors of that time took a decision and, well, nobody 

 is bigger than the game. Certainly not Shaun Pollock. 

 On whether there were awkward moments 

 between him and his young successor, Graeme Smith, in the 

 dressing room 

 I suppose it wouldve been 

 difficult for Graeme in a small way as hed got the 

 captaincy at such a young age... From my side, I didnt 

 make it awkward for him... At the end of the day, I was 

 playing for my country and gave support to the new captain... 

 Besides having to field at fine-leg instead of in the ring, 

 I didnt have to make adjustments... Even that was 

 minor... (Adds laughing) With so many former captains, 

 its probably uncomfortable in the Indian dressing 

 room! 

 On lines of communication with Smith

 Its not that we sit down 

 every Monday morning and, say, fine this has to be done 

 (together)... I chip in when I think things are going off 

 track or when Graeme bounces ideas off me... Im open 

 about it and so are the other seniors... Graemes appreciative 

 and, in any case, experience has its place. 

 On what continues to motivate him

 (Smiles) Playing for South Africa 

 is a big motivating factor... Performing against the best 

 is another... I keep getting the opportunity to show my 

 skills, my talent... Ive never had a problem motivating 

 myself... As Ive pointed out, Im a proud cricketer 

 and take pride in my performances. 

 On whether he has done justice to his 

 batting skills

 Oh, you can always look back and 

 say that a few little things couldve been done differently... 

 Im happy, for Ive made useful contributions 

 with the bat... I enjoy batting and look forward to opportunities. 

 On handling pressure

 In pressure situations, try and 

 keep things simple. Also, fall back on things that have 

 worked for you... As long as the basics are right, no situation 

 should be very difficult to overcome. 

 On the batsman who has made him work the 

 most 

 There have been many... Depends 

 on the situation... The guys who score quickly... The Gilchrists, 

 the Laras, the Tendulkars, the Pontings... More than the 

 others, theyre the ones who put the bowler under pressure. 

 On whether being a Pollock was an advantage 

 or a disadvantage when he started his international career 

 (late 1995)

 There have been pros and cons 

 throughout my life... Growing up I realised that the Pollock 

 name was big in cricket and people took note of what I did... 

 People wanted to see whether the legacy would continue... 

 There was, initially, the pressure to emulate my father 

 (Peter) or uncle (Graeme)... That settled down after a few 

 performances and I was able to concentrate on my own game... 

 Its great to have such a popular uncle and father. 

 On cricket specific discussions within 

 the family

 Were a cricket family and, 

 so, the game has to be discussed... We try not to get too 

 in-depth about it, though, as we realise theres more 

 to life than cricket... 

 On the biggest challenge for South Africa

 (Laughs again) To beat India in 

 the Test here! Its important to keep building the 

 team, its important to get good results... Weve 

 got to have quality cricketers coming through. Its 

 important, too, to keep winning across the world. 

 Finally, on his advice to young cricketers

 Self belief is a must... If you 

 dont believe in yourself, nobody will... Cricket calls 

 for a lot of hard work and you cant take the lift 

 to the top, it has to be the stairs... Obviously, youve 

 got to be disciplined.

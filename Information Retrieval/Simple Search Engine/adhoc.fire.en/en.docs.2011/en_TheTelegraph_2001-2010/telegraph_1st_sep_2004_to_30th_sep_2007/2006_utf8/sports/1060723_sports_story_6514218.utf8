 Otto Pfister to stay as Togo coach

Lome: Togo have retained German Otto Pfister to lead their 2008 African Nations Cup qualifying campaign, the countrys FA said. 

Pfister briefly walked out on his team at the World Cup finals in Germany after a pay dispute involving the players. 

Togo lost all three matches on their debut at the World Cup finals but federation president Rock Gnassingbe said late on Friday that Pfister would be retained for the qualifying round of the 2008 Nations Cup to be staged in Ghana. 

We have taken that decision and Otto Pfister has no problem with it, he said. 

Togos participation in Germany was overshadowed by the pay dispute that followed the squads initial demand for 155,000 euros ($195,900) per player ? a hefty sum for a country with average per capita income of well below $1,000. 

As the players haggled with the Togolese Football Federation Pfister stormed out before a ball had been kicked, saying he could not do his job. 

He returned in time for their first fixture against South Korea, which they lost 1-2. They also lost to Switzerland and France. 

Pfister, who had already coached eight national squads, was hired in February after Togos dismal performance at the African Nations Cup in Egypt, on the proviso that he would only be retained if the team produced good results in Germany.

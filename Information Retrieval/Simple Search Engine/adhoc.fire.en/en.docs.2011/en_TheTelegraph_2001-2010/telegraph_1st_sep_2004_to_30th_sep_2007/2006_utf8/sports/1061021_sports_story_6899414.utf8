 Jeev tied 23rd after 1-over 71

 Mallorca Classic 

Mallorca: Shifting his focus to Europe one last time this season, Jeev Milkha Singh opened with a one-over 71 in windy conditions at the Mallorca Classic. 

Jeev, lying 45th on the merit list, is now 23rd after the first round. 

The lead is shared by three players, Niclas Fasth of Sweden, South African Andrew McLardy and Irelands Gary Murphy at four-under 66 at Pula Golf Club. 

Padraig Harrington hoping to grab the European Tour Order of Merit from rival Paul Casey had a terrible start at seven-over par 77. 

Jeev, flying in from Japan, had just one birdie on sixth and two bogeys on ninth and 16th. It was a tough day for him as he found only six of the 14 fairways and just a little more than 50 greens in regulation. 

Robert Karlsson, who also has a chance of topping the Order of Merit, started with one-over par 71, one behind his Ryder Cup teammate Sergio Garcia. 

Joint leader Murphy is involved in a battle to retain his tour card as he lies 118th and the top 118 players on the Order of Merit on Sunday evening will hold their cards for 2007. 

McLardy needs a top-two finish to force his way into the field for next weeks Volvo Masters and made his first move with a 66 to share the first-round lead (PTI)

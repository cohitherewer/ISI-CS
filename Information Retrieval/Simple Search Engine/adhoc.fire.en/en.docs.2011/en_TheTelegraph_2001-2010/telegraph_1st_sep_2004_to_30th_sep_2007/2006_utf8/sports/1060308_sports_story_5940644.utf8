 Kyrgyzstan win 6-0

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: It was a battle of minnows in the three-team group. After being routed 0-7 by India in the opener, Kyrgyzstan crushed Bangladesh 6-0 in their concluding Group III Asian under-19 womens football championship tie at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Tuesday. 

The Bangladesh girls surrendered meekly. They were clearly a bunch of novices and lacked basic skills. While Narmina Rzaeva netted five goals, including a hattrick, Svetlana Pokachalova struck the other with a perfect 30-yarder. India play Bangladesh in the last match on Thursday.

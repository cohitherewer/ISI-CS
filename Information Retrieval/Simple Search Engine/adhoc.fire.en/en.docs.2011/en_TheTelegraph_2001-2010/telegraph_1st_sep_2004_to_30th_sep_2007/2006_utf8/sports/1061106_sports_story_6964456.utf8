 ICCs speedy decision surprises Ashraf

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, 

 Dr Nasim Ashraf, has expressed surprise at the 

 speedy manner in which the International Cricket Council 

 (ICC) sent Darrell Hair packing from its Elite Panel of 

 umpires. 

 I was pleasantly surprised 

 when the Executive Board took a decision on the very first 

 day (Friday) of its meeting here... Id expected our 

 call for a specific inquiry to take some time... Im 

 grateful to my colleagues on the Board, for their decision 

 has vindicated the PCBs stand, Dr Ashraf, a 

 federal minister, told The Telegraph. 

However, speaking on Sunday, he accepted that the issue of the England amp; Wales Cricket Board seeking compensation for the premature (fourth-day) end to The Oval Test, was still to be resolved. The Test will be remembered for being the first to be forfeited. 

 Eventually, it may be settled at the ICC level.

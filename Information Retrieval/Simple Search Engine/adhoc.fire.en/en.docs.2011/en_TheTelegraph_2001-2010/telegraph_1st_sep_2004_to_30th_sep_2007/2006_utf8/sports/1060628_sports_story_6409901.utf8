 Federer goes one up on Borg

 - Henman runs into champion in round 2; agassi drops a set 

 Roger Federer after beating Richard Gasquet on Tuesday 

Wimbledon: Roger Federer won his record 42nd straight grass-court match Tuesday, beating Richard Gasquet 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to open his bid for a fourth consecutive Wimbledon championship. 

The top-ranked Federer broke the record he shared with Bjorn Borg, the five-time Wimbledon champion who won 41 straight matches on grass from 1976-1981. 

Federer led Gasquet 6-3, 1-2 on Monday when the match was suspended by rain. The pair returned to Centre Court under cloudy skies, and Federer needed only 37 minutes to finish off the 20-year-old Frenchman, setting up an intriguing second-round encounter against Britains Tim Henman. 

Also winning on Centre Court was Andre Agassi, the 1992 champion playing in his last Wimbledon. The 36-year-old American, the oldest player in the mens draw, got off to a slow start before beating 71st-ranked Boris Pashanski of Serbia-Montenegro, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. 

Agassi, who announced last weekend that the US Open in September will be his final tournament, had 17 aces and capitalised on 11 double faults by Pashanski ? two coming on the last two points of the match. 

In his customary fashion, Agassi bowed and blew kisses to all corners of the court as the fans gave him a rousing ovation. Among those in the crowd was his wife, former seven-time Wimbledon champion Steffi Graf. Agassi wore a necklace with letters spelling out Daddy Rocks, an apparent gift from the couples 4-year-old son, Jaden Gil, and 2-year-old daughter, Jaz Elle. 

Federer will next face Henman, a four-time Wimbledon semi-finalist who overcame Swedens Robin Soderling, 6-7 (8), 6-3, 6-2, 1-6, 6-3. 

Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan suffered his fifth first round defeat at Wimbledon in seven years when he lost in five sets to Argentine Agustin Calleri. 

The mens 29th seed went down 7-6, 5-7, 3-6, 6-3, 3-6 to world number 58 Calleri on Court 18. Paradorn upset Agassi at the grasscourt Grand Slam in 2002 but otherwise has seldom performed well on a surface that appears well suited to his playing style. 

Earlier, Martina Hingis and Justine Henin-Hardenne took advantage of the dry weather to move into the second round with routine straight-set victories. 

Hingis, back at Wimbledon for the first time since 2001, finished off a 6-2, 6-2 win over Ukraines Olga Savchuk. The match had been suspended by rain after the first set Monday. 

Hingis, who won Wimbledon in 1997 at age 16, is continuing a comeback after three years off the tour because of a series of foot and ankle injuries and operations. 

Henin-Hardenne, who is seeking to add the Wimbledon title to complete a collection of all four Grand Slams, needed only 56 minutes to dispatch Yuan Meng of China, 6-0, 6-1. Fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters, seeded No. 2, advanced with a 7-5, 6-3 win over Vera Zvonareva. 

Mens fourth-seeded David Nalbandian, runner-up in 2002, crushed South Africas Wesley Moodie 6-3, 6-4, 6-1. Eighth-seeded James Blake was a 6-3, 7-5, 5-7, 6-4 winner over Danish qualifier Kristian Pless. 

Thomas Johansson, seeded No. 12, was eliminated by fellow Swede Jonas Bjorkman, 3-6, 7-6 (4), 6-1, 6-1; and No. 21 Gael Monfils of France lost in four sets to Igor Kunitsyn of Russia. 

Wild card Mark Philippoussis served 39 aces in a 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-3, 7-6 (12) win over Paul-Henri Mathieu. (AP)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not in Sunnys league

 Sehwag

Basseterre: He has made several big hundreds in international cricket but Virender Sehwag says that he cannot be considered in the same league as Sunil Gavaskar, whom he would like to emulate. 

I dont think at this stage of my career I can be talked of in the same manner as a Gavaskar or a Vijay Merchant. One of the things which distinguishes the greats from the ordinary ones is that they dont give up after posting a century, the opener said on Tuesday. 

If I have to be a great player, I will have to make big hundreds. If you get out before a century, then it is okay. But once you cross the three figures, its your best chance to make an even bigger score for the bowling side is looking to contain you rather than get you out. It becomes easy for batsmen. You have your moments of doubt when you struggle. But I always get motivated by criticism. You actually improve when there is criticism. Your dedication also gets a leg-up. 

 I only take that much of 

 advice which fits into my batting. If it doesnt, then 

 I dont bother about it.

 Federer quells Haas challenge

 - Hingis, Clijsters move into quarter finals 

 Roger Federer after beating Tommy Haas 6-4, 6-0, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2 on Monday 

Melbourne: Roger Federer passed his first serious test at the Australian Open on Monday by defeating unseeded Tommy Haas in five sets to reach the quarter finals of the first Grand Slam of the year. 

The Swiss world No.1s game inexplicably fell apart after he had cruised into a two-set lead, but he regained composure in time to win 6-4, 6-0, 3-6, 4-6, 6-2. 

I wouldnt call it an escape tonight. I was up two sets to love so I was never really close to losing this match, Federer said. I like to be pushed like this. Im happy I had a tough one now and Im still in the tournament. 

Federers Swiss compatriot Martina Hingis also drew on her vast experience as a former Open champion to survive a testing fourth round match with Samantha Stosur. 

Playing her first Grand Slam since the 2002 US Open, Hingis held her nerve in a tense second set to win 6-1, 7-6 and reach the last eight without dropping a set. 

Hingis was given a wildcard entry and is the only unseeded player left in a womens draw that features seven of the eight highest-ranked players in the world, including six who have held the No.1 ranking. 

Hingis will play second seed Kim Clijsters on Wednesday after the Belgian, who has been troubled by hip and back problems, limped into the quarter finals with a 7-6, 6-4 win over Italian Francesca Schiavone. 

My injurys not gone. The pain is gone because of the tablets Im taking, Clijsters said. So thats a good sign that I can be out there and play without feeling the pain. 

Third seed Amelie Mauresmo sounded a warning that this could finally be her year with another power-packed display, hammering Czech teenager Nicole Vaidisova 6-1, 6-1. 

Mauresmo, yet to win a Grand Slam singles title, will meet Patty Schnyder for a place in the semi-finals after the Swiss seventh seed overwhelmed former French Open champion Anastasia Myskina 6-2, 6-1. 

On the mens side, matches all went according to script, with Russian Nikolay Davydenko, Nicolas Kiefer and Sebastien Grosjean going through. Fifth seed Davydenko recovered from two sets down to beat Dominik Hrbaty 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, ending the Slovakian ironmans incredible run in the tournament. 

Hrbaty became just the fifth player since tennis turned professional in 1968 to play four consecutive five-set matches but the effort had obviously taken its toll. Grosjean thrashed compatriot Paul-Henri Mathieu 7-5, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the last eight for the fourth time. 

The 25th seeds next opponent is Kiefer, who dismissed Juan Ignacio Chela 7-6, 6-3, 6-3.Federer looked to be cruising to his fourth consecutive straight-set win when he ripped through the first two sets in an hour before Haas staged a remarkable fightback to force the match into a deciding fifth set. 

Federer saved his best for last, hitting 18 clean winners in the final set and making just six unforced errors. 

He got the vital break in the sixth game when his German opponent missed an easy volley and broke again in the eighth game to set up a clash with Davydenko.

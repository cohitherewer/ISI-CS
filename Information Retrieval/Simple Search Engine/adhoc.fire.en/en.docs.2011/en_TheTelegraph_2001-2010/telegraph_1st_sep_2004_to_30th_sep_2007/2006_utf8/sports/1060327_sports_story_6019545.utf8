The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Colombo: The first day of opening Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan was washed out on Sunday after heavy rains in the capital city. 

The unseasonal downpours were so heavy that the vast majority of the Sinhalese Sports Club was still submerged under water when the umpires called off play at 1pm local time

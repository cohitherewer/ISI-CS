 Renaults condition

Monaco: Renault will stay in Formula One after 2007 if the sport offers a fair return on investment, president Carlos Ghosn said on Tuesday. 

In a recorded speech for the launch of the champions new R26 car in Monaco, Ghosn voiced concern about the future direction of a sport facing the threat of a rival manufacturer-led series from 2008. 

Some manufacturers are also unhappy with new regulations for 2008 put forward by the governing FIA to cut costs and encourage smaller teams by stripping out expensive technology. (Reuters)

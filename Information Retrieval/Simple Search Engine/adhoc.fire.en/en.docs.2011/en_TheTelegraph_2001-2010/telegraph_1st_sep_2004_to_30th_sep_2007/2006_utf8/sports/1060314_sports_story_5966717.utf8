 Shooters bag 1 gold, 2 silvers

 - Hockey team jolted by Harpal Singh illness 

 Harpal Singh is down with chicken pox 

Melbourne: Indian shooters continued to dominate the ranges winning one gold and two silver medals on Monday in the badge competitions being held before the Commonwealth Games proper begins. 

India won one gold through Pemba Tamang and two silvers via Vijay Kumar and Harveen Srao in the mens and womens events, respectively. 

Tamang captured gold in the mens rapid fire pistol scoring 585/600. 

Tamang had claimed gold with an effort of 575/600 in the Australia Cup at the same venue last month. 

Vijay, with a total of 572, claimed the silver in the same event. 

Harveen, who was the womens air pistol gold medallist in the Australia Cup (389/500), performed a shade lower on Monday and settled for silver with 380. 

Anjali Bhagwat (572/600) and Anuja Jung (570/600) failed to finish in medal contention in the womens 50m rifle 3-position event. 

India bagged 14 gold medals in shooting at the last edition in Manchester. 

Meanwhile, the Indian hockey team got a jolt three days ahead of its opening match against Malaysia with best defender Harpal Singh being ruled out of the Games due to chicken pox. 

It is unfortunate that we will be missing the services of Harpal, who is down with chicken pox, Indian coach Rajinder Singh said on Monday. 

The coach said a decision on Harpals replacement would be taken soon by the Indian Hockey Federation. 

Rajinder ruled out the possibility of Dilip Tirkey or William Xalco joining the team. Dilip Tirkey and William Xalco are injured and have not recovered fully, he said. 

Rajinder was disappointed with the teams preparation for the games after Indias none-too-impressive performance against New Zealand in a practice match on Sunday. 

Strikers Thakur and Gagan Ajit Singh and midfielder Viren Rasquinha were recalled after being rested for the six-match series against Pakistan. 

 Flag hoisted at Village 

The Indian flag was ceremonially hoisted at the Games Village at a simple function marking a special moment for its team members on Monday night. 

The 249-strong contingent including chef-de-mission H.J. Dora, chairman of 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Suresh Kalmadi and Indian Olympic Association secretary Randhir Singh were present.

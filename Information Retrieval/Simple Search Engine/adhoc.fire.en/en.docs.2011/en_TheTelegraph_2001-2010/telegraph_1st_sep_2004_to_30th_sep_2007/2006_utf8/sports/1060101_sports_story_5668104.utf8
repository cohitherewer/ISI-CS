London: Champions Chelsea and rivals Manchester United were buoyed by Premier League wins on Saturday but there was grim news for Englands World Cup preparations after striker Michael Owen broke a bone in his foot. 

The Newcastle striker broke the fifth metatarsal of his right foot in a 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur and will be out for several months, according to club manager Graeme Souness. 

Supported by Wayne Rooney, Owen is supposed to spearhead Englands attack at the finals in Germany. His importance to Sven-Goran Erikssons side, and their hopes of glory, is reflected in a strike record of 35 goals in 75 games. 

As bad as it was for Souness and Eriksson, Saturday could not have ended on a better note for Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, whose champions were convincing 2-0 winners over struggling Birmingham City. 

Manchester United trounced Bolton Wanderers 4-1 in a local derby, European champions Liverpool clocked a 10th consecutive league win by edging West Bromwich Albion 1-0 and a spirited Aston Villa side held Arsenal to a 0-0 draw. 

Blackburn Rovers were surprise 3-0 winners at Wigan Athletic, Harry Redknapps Portsmouth beat Fulham 1-0, Charlton won the east London derby with West Ham 2-0 and Middlesbrough drew 0-0 with Manchester City. 

Bottom club Sunderland suffered a heartbreaking 1-0 defeat after outplaying Everton and going down to Tim Cahills last gasp winner. 

Chelsea were in imperious form at Stamford Bridge, with Argentine striker Hernan Crespo taking only one of a string of first-half chances and Dutch winger Arjen Robben firing home their second just before the break. 

The win, which moved Chelsea on to 55 points, edged them closer to a second consecutive league title by maintaining a commanding 11-point lead over United. 

Liverpool, who have two games in hand, remain in third place on 40 points after striker Peter Crouch got their winner. 

Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho summed up the last year at Chelsea as unbelievable and said on Saturday it would be very tough for the chasing pack to catch the champions in the Premier League this season. 

Speaking after Chelsea cantered to a 2-0 home win against a lacklustre Birmingham City, he said: Our 101 points in 2005 (calendar year) is unbelievable ? no defeats at home, lots of victories, better position than in 2004, unbelievable. 

You dont believe you are going to lose a lot or draw a lot. I believe the team is very strong and in a very good moment, Mourinho said. 

Its very difficult for them to catch us but in football you have to believe in everything so we must play safe, safe safe. 

Chelsea scored first half goals through Argentine striker Hernan Crespo and Dutch winger Arjen Robben but squandered a host of other chances and Mourinho described the match as merely acceptable. The Portuguese perfectionist then berated Joe Cole, whom he had lauded earlier this week as his best attacker, for returning to his old habits and playing to the crowd rather than for the team. 

He praised Crespo, who scored his eighth goal of the season, for his movement off the ball and said the Argentine showed he had adapted well to English football after a difficult start. (Reuters)

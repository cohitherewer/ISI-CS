 3 Indians in fray

Seoul: Amandeep Johl, Rahil Gangjee and Harmeet Kahlon will fly the Indian flag at the $700,000 Kolon-Hana Bank Korea Open starting here on Thursday and would hope for a change in fortune after missing the cut at the Singapore Open. 

Two-time US Open champion and world No. 6 Retief Goosen of South Africa will be the star name at the meet.

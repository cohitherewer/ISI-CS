 Polly Umrigar out of ICU

Mumbai: Former India skipper Polly Umrigar has been shifted out of the ICU at the Bombay Hospital where he was admitted four days ago for undergoing test and chemotherapy for non hodgkins lymphoma. 

The 80-year-old Umrigar is expected to remain in the hospital for a few more days, a source close to the cricketer said. Non-hodgkins lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymphatic system, a part of the bodys immune system. 

The cancer has been detected at an early stage, the source added. 

Umrigar played 59 Tests in a career spanning 14 years, between 1948 and 1962, scored 3631 runs, including 12 centuries. (PTI)

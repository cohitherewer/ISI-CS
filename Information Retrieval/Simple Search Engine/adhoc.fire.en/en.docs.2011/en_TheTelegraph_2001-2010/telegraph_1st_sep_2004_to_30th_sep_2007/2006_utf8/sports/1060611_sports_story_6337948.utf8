 Swedes fail to cross Caribbean hurdle

 Dortmund: Trinidad and Tobago made a magnificent 

 World Cup finals debut on Saturday when they held Sweden 

 to goalless despite playing with 10 men for almost all the 

 second half of their opening Group B game. 

 The Caribbean islanders, made up largely of players 

 from the lower divisions of the English league, worked tirelessly 

 to hold off their vastly more experienced opponents in the 

 second game in the group after England beat Paraguay 1-0. 

Trinidad and Tobago matched the Europeans stride for stride, even after Avery John was sent off 35 seconds in second half. 

They came closest to breaking the deadlock when substitute striker Cornell Glenn hit the bar near the hour mark. 

It was a remarkable performance by a team who qualified for the finals for the first time after beating Bahrain in a playoff while Sweden are notable tournament performers. 

The gulf in class was seemingly at its most apparent at the centre of Trinidads defence where beanpole Dennis Lawrence and partner Brent Sancho of lowly English league clubs Wrexham and Gillingham were attempting to shackle Henrik Larsson and Zlatan Ibrahimovic ? elite employees of Barcelona and Juventus. 

 However, the difference on paper disappeared on the 

 pitch as the unlikely looking defensive duo survived a testing 

 first 45 minutes with Lawrence proving unbeatable in the 

 air.

 Topalov to meet Anand in final

Leon: World champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria set up a summit clash with Indian ace Viswanathan Anand after dispatching Francisco Vallejo Pons of Spain 2.5-1.5 in the second semi-final of the Magistral Ciudad de Leon Chess tournament here. 

Topalovs victory came much faster than Anands in semi-finals as the Bulgarian quickly won two games and then drew the third to ensure his berth in the final of the traditional event. 

Pons did well to win the fourth game, but it turned out enough only to give the scorecard a look of closely-fought battle then it actually was. 

Defending champion Anand had to work very hard to beat Lazaro Bruzon of Cuba in the first semi-final that was stretched till the tie-break blitz games on Friday. 

Having struggled in the second half of Mtel Masters last month, followed by the Olympiad where Anand lost more than 19 Elo rating points, this will be a good opportunity for him to set things right.

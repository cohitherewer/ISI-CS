 Jeev, Shiv in safe zone on rain-hit day

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Shanghai: Shiv Kapur and Jeev Milkha Singh looked likely to be the only Indians figuring in the final two rounds, when play was prematurely called off due to rain, lightning and thunder on the second day of the $1.8m BMW Asian Open. 

Kapur was in the front greenside bunker of the 18th, while Jeev was stranded on the 18th fairway when the hooter went off signalling the suspension of play at the wind-swept, cold and wet Tomson Pudong Golf Club on Friday. 

Kapur seemed safe at one-over, while Jeev was three-over at that stage with the cut likely at just that number. 

Henrik Stenson, playing in the same group as Kapur, was leading at five-under, and was on the 18th green in two. 

The clubhouse leader was Scotsman Paul Lawrie (70) at four-under 138. Right behind them are two Asians ? Malaysian Danny Chia (70) and Filipino Frankie Minoza (72) in the bunch of four, including Portuguese Jose Filipa Lima (70) and Irishman Peter Lawrie (72), at three-under. 

Scoring conditions rapidly deteriorated during the day as the early morning breeze turned into a stiff wind and the temperatures dropped quickly to just under 14 degrees centigrade. 

In the second round, only two players, Graeme Storm of England and German Sven Struver broke 70, while there were only a handful of others coming under-par for the day. 

Meanwhile, the other four Indians had a rough day and missed the cut. Gaurav Ghei (75) and Amandeep Johl (76) are at seven-over, while Harmeet Kahlon (75) is at nine over and Rahil Gangjee at 13-over with three mores holes to play. 

It was cold out there and luckily I was carrying a pullover, said Kapur, who patiently negotiated the first eight holes with pars before dropping shot at the ninth. 

With 15th playing very tough, Kapur dropped one more there. I had no birdies, though I missed a couple. Playing pars seemed fine in such conditions. Towards the end there was no feel in the hands as it was getting very chilly, added Kapur.

Meanwhile, Jeev needs to get onto the green and get a par to play the final two rounds. At three-over following bogeys on third, seventh, ninth and 11th, he was three-over for the day. 

That was thanks to a welcome birdie on the par-five 13th which gave me some breathing space and then four pars followed, and I was happy with that, said Jeev. 

The same could not be said about his playing partner, Colin Montgomerie, who looked fine at three-under on the 16th tee, when he was hit by the sudden wind. He dropped a bogey each on 16th and 17th and was suddenly down to just one-under, when he came to the 18th. 

Lawrie, the 1999 Open champion in most unlikely situation ? when Jean van de Velde triple bogeyed and then lost the play-off ? has been running into some decent form of late. 

 He registered his first top-10 

 of the season last week in Volvo China Open, and on the 

 second day he played in the morning and overcame the Shanghai 

 wind to card a two-under-par 70. (PTI)

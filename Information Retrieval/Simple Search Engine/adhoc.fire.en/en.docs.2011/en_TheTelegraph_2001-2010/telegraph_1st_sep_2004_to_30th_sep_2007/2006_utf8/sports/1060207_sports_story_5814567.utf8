The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Maradona, the leader, has been an inspiration: Inzamam

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE The Pakistan captain says he works for the Faith 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Peshawar: Inzamam-ul Haq is less than a month away from his 36th birthday, but continues to be among the most dominant batsman of the current era and is growing as a captain. With almost 20,000 Test and ODI runs under his belt, he actually has few peers. Despite being pressed for time, Inzamam kept a promise made earlier on the tour and spoke to The Telegraph for about 45 minutes in his Pearl Continental suite on Sunday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts 

On being the first from Multan proper to play international cricket 

Bus khali cricket ka shauk rehta tha... I wanted to follow in the footsteps of my elder brother, Intezar... He used to wear colourful tracksuits and thats one of the things which fascinated me... Even I wanted to wear them... He played at the first-class level and it was with him that I started club cricket... 

On having come through the ranks 

Yes... From the U-19 level and so on... A turning point was when I joined United Bank Limited... I got picked for Pakistan after excelling for three consecutive years... Of course, I neither made a big impression on my ODI debut (20 against the West Indies, 1991-92, in Lahore) nor in my first Test (8 not out at Edgbaston, 1992). 

On becoming a star during the closing stages of the 1992 World Cup 

(Smiles) I couldnt believe I would get the reception I got on returning to Multan... Thousands lined the route from the airport to my residence... There were people and more people... They were happy that, through me, Multan got recognition. 

On the brilliant 60 in the semi-final versus New Zealand in Auckland 

Remains one of my best... Till then, except for a 48 against South Africa, I hadnt done anything in the tournament... Actually, more than being one of my best innings, that was a defining moment in my career... If I hadnt got runs that day, who knows... 

On the influence of his first captain, Imran Khan 

Bahut jyada... I didnt play much under him, but remember he would involve seniors and take their suggestions... Its not for me to say he would lead from the front... Imranbhai was truly inspirational and, if needed, I seek his advice. What Ive learnt most from him is being positive, irrespective of the situation. 

On whether anybody else has also had a significant influence 

You may be surprised ? Diego Maradona. He wasnt just an outstanding footballer, but a great leader... He didnt have a great team, in 1986, but Argentina still won the World Cup... What stood out is that he made the team play around him... He acted as the leader in every sense and encouraged others to grow by his side... He supported his team... Indeed, Maradona has been an inspiration... Hopefully, Ill get to meet him somewhere. 

On having been captain for three years 

The seniors werent there after the last World Cup and I had to motivate players junior to me... It was a process of rebuilding and each one of us realised it was up to us to either deliver or fail... Hami ko khelna tha, hami ko jeetna tha... I must compliment the boys for the way theyve shouldered responsibility. Its not that we havent lost in the last three years, but the commitment has been fantastic. 

On the initiative taken by him to encourage bonding 

Be it on the ground or at the team hotel, Ive been particular about saying the prayers together... Thats one form of bonding and conveys a sense of unity and collective faith in Allah. If somebody has a problem, its sorted out after the prayers... Namaaz saath padhne se farak pada hai... Theres more discipline as well... 

On whether anybody suggested that the prayers be said collectively 

Saeed Anwar, who is now working for the Faith, talked about it... Namaaz is an integral part of every Muslims life and a collective exercise can only help. In the hotels, we now have a prayer room for the team. 

On whether hes going the Anwar way 

(Smiles again) I do work for the Faith... There are times when I spend either three or ten days in a mosque and work in that area... I speak about Islam, not just in the mosque, but out among the awaam... Ive worked for the Faith in Gujranwala... In Sialkot... I feel enriched and have been doing so for three years. 

On life 

Its not to earn pots of money and keep making headlines... In any case, everybody cant be rich... (After a pause) Its every Muslims responsibility to ensure other members of the community are on the right path... Main apna role play karta hoon... 

On whether he intends working for the Faith full-time after quitting 

First, I have to understand Islam fully... Im still learning... Yes, Im going to work for the Faith, but also intend opening an academy... That way, Ill be returning something to the sport which has made me the person I am. (Emotionally, after a pause) Im going to retire at a time when people still praise my batting... My contribution to cricket in Pakistan... Ill quit before people begin to ask Inzy retire kyon nahin karta? Main izzat se bow out karoon ga... 

On whether he could do an Imran and enter politics 

Im not the type to be a politician. 

On the public nowadays not going over the top after defeats 

Has helped... Has given the players confidence... Even when we lost to India in 2003-04, nobody alleged that the matches were fixed... People realised we were beaten by a better team and that you cant only win. 

On how he unwinds 

Nothing is more relaxing than spending time with the family (wife Kashafa, sons Ibtisham and Ehsam and daughter Ujala)... Whenever possible, I go to the US or some other place where cricket isnt a national obsession and Im able to unwind with those closest to me... Its on such vacations that I get away totally from cricket. 

On being a Manchester United fan 

(Laughs) Like everybody else! I also keep a track of mens tennis and am amazed at Roger Federers calm consistency. Im a fan of Andre Agassi, too, and would root for Pete Sampras when he was the undisputed champion. 

On movies and songs 

Hardly get the time to watch movies... As for listening to songs, it never was a hobby. 

On his back problem 

I dont see myself going abroad for treatment... Ive got specific exercises to do on a daily basis and the physio (Darryn Lifson) has made swimming compulsory. 

On lending his name to a hospital project near Multan 

Ive helped in fund-raising in Pakistan and overseas... The hospital is exclusively going to be for women... Whenever approached, I do whatever is possible... 

On the Pakistan he would like to see 

One where every citizen in every province has the most basic facilities: Water, electricity, education and health facilities... Im happy theres movement in that direction... Development is taking place. 

On Indo-Pak relations 

Im of the opinion that the contacts, at all levels, ought to be more. 

On his hero outside cricket 

Prophet Mohammed... Hes the biggest... 

Finally, on staying remarkably cool even when the ball doesnt roll his way 

My approach is simple: The calmer I am, the better will be my decision-making... I dont panic and dont lose self-belief.

Calcutta: Seemed as if it would be as smooth as Swiss chocolate, but the hazelnut within had not been taken into account. 

The Swiss world No.9 did win her match and went through to the quarter finals of the WTA Sunfeast Open all right, but not before the lanky Israelite Tzipora Obzlier gave her one hell of a toothache. 

The straight set 6-2, 7-5 win doesnt reflect the pluck that the world No.130 showed, at times sending deep chill into the spines of the organisers that the crowd-puller Hingis may just be having a very bad nightmare. 

The victory, laborious and sweat-breaking as it was, proved a couple of points. One, Hingis still has what it takes to take her game up a few notches when the situation demands. Two, she may not have the power of the Mauresmos or the Serenas, but she has nerves of steel. 

Obziler, a pint sized package of surprise, had it all. The sizzling down-the-lines, the authoritative backhands into the far corners, a deep serve and extremely impressive court coverage. 

What she didnt have, was 12 years worth of experience (Hingis turned pro in October 14, 1994) at the highest level of the game. And it showed. 

Hingis had to wait as far as the fifth game of the first set for her first break point opportunity. When she did, she promptly converted it, and quite against the run of play (Obziler had wasted three break points in the previous game) the former world No.1 gained control of the first set. Another break later, Hingis wrapped it up in just 29 minutes. 

The crowd, the press and almost everyone else thought thats all the Israelite, who has no WTA singles or doubles title to her credit yet, has to offer. 

She proved everyone wrong by getting back the break after Hingis had achieved an early one in the second set. 

Obziler attacked the Hingis backhand and hit nice and deep to set the up the points. Her odd adventure forward reaped benefits each time. But the Swiss Miss hung on even as Obziler cannoned past her forehands, drawing gasps of praise from a partisan crowd. 

After trading breaks in the seventh and eighth games, in the all-important 11th, which ran into deuce four times, Hingis finally hit the jackpot as Obzilers return hit the net. 

Once she stepped into the Greensets to serve out the match, Hingis seemed more confident. She held her serves without dropping a point and closed it out in one hour and twenty five minutes to book a last-eight date with Thai Tamarine Tanasugarn. 

Earlier, Tanasugarn wore down Abigail Spears with bland and stodgy perseverance. The world No. 124 won a two-hour (one second less, actually) marathon to move into the quarter finals on Wednesday. 

Tanasugarns 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 win follows the earlier 6-7, 7-5, 6-0 three setter victory over sixth seed Kaia Kanepi. 

Just like Kanepi on Monday, Spears started off the blocks with gusto, and achieving breaks in the second, sixth and eighth games, the feed-up player clinched the first set 6-2 in just 29 minutes. 

It seemed as though another bloodless coup was in order, though certainly not in the same ranks as the one on Tuesday that saw the Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, losing power as the military gained control. 

The Thais biggest asset, though, is her ability to remain unfazed. Slowly as the second set progressed, Tanasugarn started gaining control. Eventually, the Thai broker her American opponent in the first, fifth and ninth games to clinch the second set 6-3. In the final set, Spears appeared too tired to react. 

Incidentally, later in the post-match press conference, Tanasugarn sounded extremely cool about the political upheaval back home. 

Everything is fine Nothing out there is as dangerous as it has been made out, was all she found time to say before WTA officials banned any more questions on that topic. 

In a first round match, German girl Sandra Kloesel overcame a stiff challenge from Galina Voskoboeva of Russia to book a second round encounter against Sania Mirza. The 29 year old world No. 123 won 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-4. 

Fourth seed Aravane Rezai polished off Tatiana Poutchek 6-1, 6-2 and booked a quarter final berth against the winner of the match between Sania and Sandra Kloesel. 

Meanwhile, after the sumptuous Hingis feast, Sania, teaming up with Liezel Huber late on Wednesday, served the dessert with a 6-2, 6-4 win over Archana Venkataraman and Ragini Vimal in a first round match.

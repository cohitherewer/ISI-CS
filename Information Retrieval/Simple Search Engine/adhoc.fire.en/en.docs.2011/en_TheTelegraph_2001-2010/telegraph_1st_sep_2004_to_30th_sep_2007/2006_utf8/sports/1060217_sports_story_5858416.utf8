 Indian men win, women go down

Jaipur: Indian men got off to a flying start in the Thomas Cup badminton championship, clinching all three singles matches to beat Singapore 4-1 in group C here on Thursday. 

The womens team put up a spirited show in Uber Cup but went down 2-3 to second seeds Hong Kong in group Y. 

The mens team ? comprising Chetan Anand, Anoop Sridhar and Arvind Bhatt ? fought well to win after all of them had dropped the first game in their respective matches. 

Anand, who lost to Lee-Yen Kendrick at the All-England Championship, avenged his defeat as he beat the world No. 40 12-21, 21-16, 21-11. Bhatt then accounted for Tanwei Kiat Aaron 17-21, 21-12, 21-18. 

Sridhar, who faced Wijaya Hendra in the third singles, had a tough time coping with his rivals deceptive shots. Hendra took the first game 21-14. The Indian managed to squeeze out the next two games 21-19, 21-17. 

The doubles pair of Rupesh Kumar and Sanave Thomas beat Fuzhi Hui Alvin and Khookian Teck 21-12, 21-11, but V. Diju and Ismail Jaseel went down 15-21, 21-13, 21-23 to Hendra and S.H. Kurniawan.

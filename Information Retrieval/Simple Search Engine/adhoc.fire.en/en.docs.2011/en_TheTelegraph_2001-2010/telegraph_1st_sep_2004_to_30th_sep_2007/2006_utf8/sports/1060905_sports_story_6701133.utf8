 Subhojit injured during practice

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Moin-ud-Dowlah meet

 Calcutta: CAB XI wicketkeeper 

 Subhojit Paul had a narrow escape when he was hit by a Laxmi 

 Ratan Shukla delivery during nets at the Gymkhana ground 

 in Hyderabad on Monday afternoon.

 According to information received 

 here, Subhojit was keeping wickets when the ball bounced 

 off the stumps and hit him near the left eye. The youngster 

 lay unconscious after the blow. 

 He regained composure soon and 

 even had a knock at the nets. Later, he complained of dizziness 

 and manager Samir Dasgupta rushed him to Yashoda Hospital.

 After a thorough examination, 

 the doctors said there was no internal haemorrhage. A CT 

 scan also confirmed there was nothing to worry, Dasgupta 

 told The Telegraph.

 He is perfectly alright, 

 though the doctors have advised him to be kept under observation 

 for 24 hours, the manager added.

 Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly will 

 join the squad for the Moin-ud-Dowlah meet on Tuesday.

Melbourne: Indian pistol shooter Samresh Jung won two titles with different partners on Saturday to become the first double gold-medallist at the 18th Commonwealth Games. 

India won a third gold through weightlifter Yumnam Chanu to move to third place with seven in total, one less than England. 

India now have seven gold, three silver and a bronze. 

Jung teamed up with Vivek Singh to win the 10m pairs title and then joined forces with Ronak Pandit in the 25m standard pistol pairs to add two golds to the silver medal he won on Friday. Both pairings established new Games records in both the competitions. 

Jung and Vivek tallied 1154 erasing the previous mark of 1145 by Michael Gault and Nicolas Baxter of England. Jung and Vivek had individual scores of 578 and 576, respectively. 

Later, Jung (565) and Pandit (574) amassed 1139 in the 25m standard pistol pairs final at the Melbourne Gun Club. 

Chanu won gold in the womens 58kg category, while Sudhir K. Chitradurga won bronze in the mens 69kg division. 

She lifted an overall 185kg, which included 80kg through snatch and 105kg through clean and jerk. 

The Indian paddlers, meanwhile, kept their medal hopes alive by cruising to the semi-finals of the team championships. While the mens team defeated Canada 3-1, the women prevailed over Nigeria by an identical margin to make it to the last-four stage. 

Achanta Sharath Kamal tamed Canadas Peter Paul Pradeeban 11-7, 11-8, 11-1 and Soumyadeep Roy pipped Bence Csaba 6-11, 3-11, 11-9, 11-8, 11-6. 

Canada pulled one back with Faazil Kassam beating national champion Subhajit Saha 11-6, 17-15, 3-11, 11-5. But Kamal won the decider against Csaba 7-11, 4-11, 11-6, 11-6, 11-5 to push India into the semis. 

In the womens, Mouma Das lost to Oshonaike Olufunke 9-11, 11-6, 8-11, 11-7, 5-11 while Poulami Ghatak got past Edem Offiong 11-4, 11-3, 11-8 to level things. Nandita Saha then defeated Cecila Offiong 11-7, 12-10, 12-10, Poulami beat Olufunke 11-9, 11-7, 3-11, 15-13 to take India to the last four. 

In boxing, all three Indian pugilists on show on Saturday sailed into the quarter finals. 

Jitender Kumar began the day with a 14-5 victory overs Pakistans Nouman Karim in the 51kg flyweight category. Jai Bhagwan moved into the last eight in the 60kg lightweight class as he swept past Robert Lyn Turley of Wales 30-9. 

Pak rout India 4-1 

In hockey, both the men and womens teams put on a disappointing show that has further dented their medal prospects. 

The men suffered an embarrassing 1-4 defeat to arch rivals Pakistan as they squandered an early lead and paid the price for some sloppy defence. The Indians, who were held 1-1 in their opening match against Malaysia, now face a daunting task to make it to the semi-finals. 

Adnan Maqsood scored in the 41st and 57th minutes Muddasar Ali Khan (23rd) and Tariq Aziz (38th) had scored the first two goals. Tejbir Singh (14th) netted Indias only goal. 

The womens team came from behind to hold South Africa to a 2-2 draw in a group A league match. 

In basketball, the Indian women surrendered to England in their second match of the league, losing 57-104. The Indian hoopstersmade some effort in the opening quarter but could not carry forward the momentum. (Agencies)

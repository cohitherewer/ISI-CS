 Jeev climbs two places

 Golf Ranking

 New Delhi: Jeev Milkha 

 Singh climbed two places to 146th in the latest world golf 

 rankings on the back of his tied fifth place finish at the 

 Sega Sammy Cup on the Japan Tour.

 Shiv Kapur, the sole Indian at 

 British Open, the oldest major in the world, failed to make 

 the cut and saw his ranking fall from 175th to 184th. Jyoti 

 Randhawa, who was the highest ranked Indian not too long 

 ago, continued to move in the wrong direction as he slid 

 three spots to 164th.

 Arjun Atwal managed to arrest 

 the free fall in his ranking by managing a tied 17th place 

 finish at the BC Open on the USPGA Tour. With only his third 

 top-20 finish of the current season, Atwal climbed up a 

 notch to 183rd spot.

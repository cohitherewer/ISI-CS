The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not afraid to take decisions: Mahela 

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

ICCs Captain of the Year on his job and more... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahela Jayawardene 

Mumbai: No.1 qualifiers Sri Lanka didnt make even the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy, but the pundits remain convinced the team has the ammunition to surprise the best. Plus, the captaincy is in the hands of one Mahela Jayawardene, whom the iconic Ian Chappell regards as somebody with the brightest future. The 29-year-old Jayawardene, who arrived on Friday morning for the ICC awards, spoke to The Telegraph (around lunch) at the Hornbys Pavilion, the coffee shop at the ITC Sheraton. 

[Some hours later, Jayawardene was adjudged the ICCs Captain of the Year, confirming that he is one to watch out for.] 

The following are excerpts 

On Sri Lanka having been the dark horse for the 

ongoing tournament, the Champions Trophy 

(Laughs) Well, even wed expected to do well, but didnt... Losing the first match, to Pakistan (in Jaipur), was costly... But, then, thats how the ball rolled. 

[While the Sri Lankans beat New Zealand, in the second match, they lost to South Africa as well.] 

On whether he has analysed the loss 

We made too many mistakes and at crucial times... In a tournament such as the Champions Trophy, the margin for error is very small... Then, we were taken aback by the wickets in India... Wed expected them to be flat... To be suited for tall scores, but they turned out to be different. 

On dew having been a factor early on 

If you bowled second, then the spinners went out of the equation... Teams had to quickly change strategy... Nobody, perhaps, expected dew to have such an influence... 

On the Sri Lankan team 

Its a nice mix... Youth and much experience... The quicker we learn from mistakes, the better. 

On the forthcoming engagements 

We face New Zealand and, then, will be back in India early next year for a series of ODIs... After that is the big one the World Cup. 

On working with Tom Moody, the coach 

Each coach brings something different to the table and he has been good... Within the larger game plan, Tom gives the players a lot of freedom. Its up to the players to make the most of that freedom. 

On his captaincy getting high marks from critics 

(Laughs again) Its nice to know that people are appreciating what Ive been trying to do... Im not afraid to take decisions and Im aware it wont reflect well on me if the decisions dont work out. Bottomline is that Im not scared. 

On whether he has idolised any captain 

Not really... Of course, what Ive been doing is talking to a cross-section of sportspersons and trying to find out how they respond to situations... Ive got an open mind and, obviously, Im learning... (After a pause) In fact, captaincy has much to do with instincts... There are occasions when youve got to back your instincts and really go for it. 

On captaincy not affecting his batting 

I dont put myself under pressure... When Im batting, I see myself as a batsman only... The captains cap comes on when I need to make decisions, not otherwise... Its easy this way... Indeed, I dont complicate things. 

On staying unruffled 

I just be myself... The person you see out on the field is the person I am... 

Finally, on Sundays Australia versus West 

Indies final 

The Australians have the depth, but the West Indians have been playing well... The Australians seem to have the edge, but it could be very close... In fact, having beaten Australia a couple of times in recent months, the West Indians wont be short on confidence. The CCI wicket, though, may be a factor.

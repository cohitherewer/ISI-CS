 India colts beat Aussies in warm-up tie

Colombo: India registered a victory over Australia on the final day of the warm-up matches for the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Friday. 

Indias six-wicket win was a reassuringly convincing performance after their loss to England on Thursday. 

It was built on an impressive display with the ball as Australia were bundled out for 174 in only 44.3 overs, the second day in succession when they failed to bat out their full allocation of overs. India cruised home with 11.2 overs in hand. Opener Cheteshwar Pujara top-scored with 60.

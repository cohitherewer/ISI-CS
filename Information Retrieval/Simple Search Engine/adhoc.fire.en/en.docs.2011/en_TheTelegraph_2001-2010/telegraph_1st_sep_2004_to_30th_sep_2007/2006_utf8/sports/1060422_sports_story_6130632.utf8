 10-man Bagan hold Dempo 

 - National League

Mumbai: The 10-man Mohun Bagan fought bravely and held Dempo to a goalless draw in the National Football League for the ONGC Cup at the Cooperage on Friday. 

Mohun Bagan defender Sanjeev Maria was booked twice for fouls in a three-minute span and had to leave the field with ten minutes left in the first-half. 

The draw helped Biswajit Bhattacharyas side keep its third spot in the table intact with 21 points to their credit from 11 ties while the defending champions Dempo remained fourth with 20 from 11 matches. 

With Marias exit from the ground, Mohun Bagan packed their defence and gave little room for the Goan teams forwards to capitalise on their numerical advantage. 

In fact, it was Mohun Bagan who squandered a few chances in the second-half to steal a victory. 

Awudu Ibrahims shot early in the second-half was saved by Dempo custodian Abhijit Mondal and the rebound was booted wide by Sushil Kumar Singh. 

Sushil was again the culprit in the 56th minute when he left-footed the ball wide following a pass from Ibrahim. (PTI)

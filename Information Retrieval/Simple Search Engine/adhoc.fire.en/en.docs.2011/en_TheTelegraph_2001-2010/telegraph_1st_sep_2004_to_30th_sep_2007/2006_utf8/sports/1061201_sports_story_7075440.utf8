 Jeev Milkha 

 shares sixth position

 Japan Meet

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

 Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh 

 primed himself for another good week as he birdied two of 

 the last three holes to come back with a three-under 67 

 that put him in a share for sixth place for the season-ending 

 Golf Nippon Series JT Cup at the Tokyo Yomiuri Country Club.

 With only 28 players teeing up 

 in the tournament, a big day awaits all finishes as there 

 is no cut in the event.

 Jeev, who notched his maiden Japan 

 Tour win and also the third worldwide win this year of the 

 Casio World Open last week, is two shots behind joint leaders 

 Wayne Perske and Hiroyuki Fujiota.

 Perske had a brilliant run from 

 the third to the seventh as he was six-under for the stretch 

 with four birdies and one eagle. 

 Fujita had six birdies and one 

 bogey in his 65. Three players Tommy Nakajima, Liang Wen 

 Chong of China and Shingo Katayama share the third place 

 at four-under 66 each and then there are four players including 

 Jeev, Keiichiro Fukabori, Kaname Yokoo and Toru Taniguchi.

 Jeev started with a series of 

 five pars before he sank his first birdie on fifth and then 

 came four more pars before a birdie on 11th put him two-under 

 at that stage.

 Bogeys on 12th and 15th, with 

 a birdie sandwiched in between on 13th brought him down 

 to one-under. Then closing birdies on 16th and 17th saw 

 him finish at 67 and sixth.

 Jeev managed only 61 per cent 

 green in regulation, but he had a great day on the greens 

 needing just 26 to go around 18 holes.

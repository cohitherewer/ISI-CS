Basseterre: India raised visions of an upset victory before settling, a bit too early, for a draw in the third Test and leave the four-match series against the West Indies 0-0 here on Monday (as briefly reported in Tuesdays CM edition). 

India, set a target of 392 to win from 88 overs took the attack to the rival camp on the fifth and final day at the Warner Park. 

The visitors took the lunch at 109 for no loss and further needed only 148 runs from 25 final overs with eight wickets in hand. 

But the dismissals of the cavalier Sehwag and later of Mahendra Singh Dhoni took the wind out of their sails, and they closed the game at 298 for 4 with three mandatory overs still to be bowled. 

Two century stands for the first and third wickets between Wasim Jaffer (54) and Sehwag (65) and then between VVS Laxman (63) and Rahul Dravid (68 not out) sparked new life into Indias bid. 

India showed their intent when they promoted Dhoni (20) to No. 5 after Laxman had fallen to a catch in the slip cordon off left-arm pacer Pedro Collins. 

Dhoni hoisted the first ball he faced from Collins for a towering straight six.. 

Dhoni hit one more sizzling six to keep everyone interested but once he was out to a catch in the covers, India downed the shutters. 

Sehwag set the cat among the pigeons with a blistering 65 from 75 balls with eight fours and raised 109 runs with his partner Jaffer from only 26 odd-overs. The first ball after lunch though claimed him leg before and it appeared the game would meander into a draw. 

But Laxman and Dravid infused new life with a century stand which gained real thrust after the tea break. Laxman made his runs from 106 balls with 10 fours while Dravid occupied the crease for 131 balls and hit four fours and a six. 

India were 200 for 2 at the tea break but then runs came in spurts on resumption with 43 runs realised from 25 minutes of hectic play. 

With an equation of six runs an over and wickets in hand, India looked hot favourites to claim an unexpected win. That was before conservatism got the better of them.

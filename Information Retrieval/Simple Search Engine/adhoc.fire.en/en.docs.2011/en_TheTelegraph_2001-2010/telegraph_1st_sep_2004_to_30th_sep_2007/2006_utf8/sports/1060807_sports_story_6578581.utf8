 Jeev Milkha ties for 21st place

 Japan Golf

 Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singhs 

 streak of top-10 finishes came to an end on an unforgiving 

 Otaru County Golf Course as he finished tied 21st at the 

 Sun Chlorella Classic here on Sunday.

 The Indian star, riding on a streak 

 of four straight top-10 finishes, succumbed to the crucifying 

 closing holes to card a three-over 75 in the final round 

 a double bogey, bogey and a double bogey pushing him five-over 

 for last three holes.

 Hideto Tanihara (72) had two bogeys 

 in his last three holes, on 16th and 17th, but still scraped 

 through by one shot to win the title.

 Jeev started with a string of 

 13 pars and when he birdied the 14th and 15th in a row. 

 He was well on track for a good finish inside top-five but 

 then came the heartbreak. He double bogeyed the 16th, bogeyed 

 the 17th and double bogeyed the 18th to drop five shots 

 in three holes and from three-under he dropped to two over.

 At three-under, he would have 

 finished tied seventh.

 That last stretch was a 

 killer. Long holes, lots of trouble and my iron play let 

 me down, said Jeev.

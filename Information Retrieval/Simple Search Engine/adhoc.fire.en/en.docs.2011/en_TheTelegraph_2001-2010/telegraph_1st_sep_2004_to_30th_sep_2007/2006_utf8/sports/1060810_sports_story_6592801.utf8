 Scott relishing return to Asia

Singapore: Australias world number six Adam Scott is relishing the prospect of a return to Asia next month to defend his Singapore Open title. 

Scotts last victory came on the lush but demanding Serapong course on Sentosa almost a year ago, but the 26-year-old is hitting form at just the right time and heads to Singapore for the September 7-10 event. 

Im looking forward to it, Scott said in a statement released by organisers on Wednesday. (Reuters)

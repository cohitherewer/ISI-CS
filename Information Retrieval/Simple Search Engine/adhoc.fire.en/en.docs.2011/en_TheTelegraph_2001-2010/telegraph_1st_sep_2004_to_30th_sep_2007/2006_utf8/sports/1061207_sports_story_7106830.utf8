 Aristotle exhibited old form 

 STAR RACER

 ODonoghue 

 Aristotles return to form, Right Agains belaboured victory and jockey Vijay Kumars one-month suspension were the highlights of last Saturdays seven-event race card. Punters, however, had only an academic interest in the op-ening three events, as odds offered on the winners were crammed, but the later-half was packed with action.

 Aristotle, a Vijay Singh-trainee who had a poor summer season down the south, was back to his last winters form which had helped the Razeen son win the Derby. On the day, in the 1,600m Bangalore Turf Club Cup, the four-year-old led from the start with a two-length lead which itself weighed heavy on the opposition. 

 Right Agains last win was a cruising one and Daniel Davids Derby hope was expected to repeat the performance in his next start. However, in the 2,000m Galstaun Cup, the 4-10 favourite was needed to be pressed hard by the visiting jockey Colm Donoghue to overtake Vijays Andrology. It was an amazing improvement displayed by the Vijay-trainee since being outclassed by Amorina in the monsoon Derby.

 Donoghues riding skills were also under test in the baby-race, the 1,100m Revelation Plate, which saw another of Daniels hot-favourites, Red Sails, managing to beat Robin Corners Elemental Wish, just about. 

 The second-half of the card, in contrast, was an entertaining one for those who looked for better odds. Trainer T.N. Jaiswals Salinger, a 10-1 shot, helped break the monopoly of hot-favourites and punters did not mind it. Salinger easily won the 1,600m Topspin Handicap . In his last outing, he had trailed the field over a scurry. Tip Toes case was simple. The horse has been subjected to in-and-out running in the past.

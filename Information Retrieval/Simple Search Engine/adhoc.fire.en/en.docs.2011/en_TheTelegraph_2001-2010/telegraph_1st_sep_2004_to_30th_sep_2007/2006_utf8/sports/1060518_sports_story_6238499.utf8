 We want it in August: Shah

Mumbai: The BCCI is keen that the triangular ODI series in Sri Lanka, which involves South Africa as the third team, to be scheduled between August 15 and 30 and not in September as has been proposed by the Sri Lankan board. 

We want the tri-series to be held in August rather than what has been proposed by the Lankan board, which is in September, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said on Wednesday. 

I am going to Colombo to attend the Asian Cricket Councils executive board meeting on Sunday and would take the opportunity to discuss the matter with the Lankan board officials, Shah said.

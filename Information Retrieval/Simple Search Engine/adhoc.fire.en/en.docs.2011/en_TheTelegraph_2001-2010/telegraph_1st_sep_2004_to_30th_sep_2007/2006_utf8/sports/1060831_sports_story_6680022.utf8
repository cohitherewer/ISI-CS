 Kapur back after five months

 - Asian Tour

Johor Bahru (Malaysia): Shiv Kapur makes a return to the Asian Tour after five months at the $300,000 Malaysian Masters on Thursday. The 24-year-old has gained a summer of experience on the European Tour, besides making his maiden appearance at a major and the WGC meet. 

Shiv, Asian Tours Rookie of the Year last season, flew in from Ohio, where he played the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. He will also play in the $3 million Barclays Singapore Open next week. 

I am tired after my return, but I am going to put all that aside here. Last week was a great experience for me and I feel like my game is ready. I wasnt hitting so great yesterday (Tuesday) but I feel much better now, said Shiv, one of 14 Indians in the fray here. 

I am really looking forward to this week and the next couple of weeks trying to get a win and get back in the winners circle. 

Last week (at the WGC meet) was awesome and I really enjoyed it. I learned a tremendous amount from it. It was a very heartening experience to see the way I stacked up against the stars at the World Golf Championships. What Ive learnt is how to play on a tough golf course and how to manage your game. 

Youve got to have a sharp short game and produce a good score no matter what. The players would go all out to avoid a dropped shot and that was what I learnt, he said. 

Of the Pulai Springs Resort, hosting its first Asian Tour event, Shiv said, The course here in Johor is quite challenging. Ive managed to play the first nine holes and enjoyed it. If you take a few chances, you can make birdies. It requires some demanding tee shots as well, especially on the par-fives. 

After a dream first season, Shiv is trying not to get carried away. My main focus is to take it a step at a time but since my win at Volvo Masters of Asia last year, Ive been eager to win again, so I hope I can put myself into a good position here. (PTI)

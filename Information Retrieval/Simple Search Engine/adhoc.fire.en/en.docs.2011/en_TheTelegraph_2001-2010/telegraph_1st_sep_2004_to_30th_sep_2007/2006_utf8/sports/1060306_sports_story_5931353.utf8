 Atwal slips to tied 54th

Miami: Tiger Woods, lifted by three successive birdies after the turn, forged two strokes clear in his title defence at the Doral Championship on Saturday. 

The world No. 1 fired a four-under-par 68 in the third round at Dorals Blue Monster Course, breaking break clear of a congested leaderboard. 

Woods mixed six birdies with a double-bogey at the par-three ninth to finish on 17-under 199. 

Swedens Daniel Chopra holed a 60-foot birdie putt at the last for a 68 to share second place with American Rich Beem, who carded a 69. 

Indias Arjun Atwal slipped to tied 54th after a two-over 74. 

Atwal began well with two birdies on his first two holes but then slid with four dropped in four holes from fifth to eighth including a double bogey on the sixth. 

There was consolation with birdies on the tenth and 14th but bogeys on 11th and the tough 18th negated them as he ended the day at two-over 74 and in the tied 54th place, down from 25th after the second round.

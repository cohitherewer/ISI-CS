 Lara back as captain

 - Its time for us to move up, says WI legend 

Port-of-Spain: Brian Lara, the leading run-scorer in Tests, has been reappointed captain of the West Indies who will take on Zimbabwe in a seven-match ODI series beginning in Antigua on Saturday. 

A statement on the official West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) website said board president Kim Gordon had made the announcement at a media briefing on Wednesday. 

Lara, 36, replaces Shivnarine Chanderpaul who said earlier this month he was not interested in continuing as captain after 13 months in charge. 

During that period the West Indies lost 10 out of 14 tests and 14 out of 16 ODIs. 

Laras appointment for the third time as captain comes a year before the West Indies host the World Cup. Although his overall record as skipper is modest, he led the West Indies to victory in the ICC Champions Trophy in England two years ago. 

Lara has scored a record 11,294 runs in 124 Tests at an average of 53.02 with 31 centuries. 

In addition he holds the world record for the highest Test score (400 not out against England) and the highest first-class score (501 for Warwickshire against Durham). 

Im happy to know that the West Indies Cricket Board has faith in me... Im happy to know the coach, the players, selectors also place that faith in me and it is time for us to move on, Lara told reporters. 

It is time for us to plan properly, time for us to hit the bottom and start moving upwards. Upward mobility in West Indies cricket is of great necessity at this time. 

Gordon also said a protracted dispute over the players retainer contracts had been settled at Wednesdays meeting.

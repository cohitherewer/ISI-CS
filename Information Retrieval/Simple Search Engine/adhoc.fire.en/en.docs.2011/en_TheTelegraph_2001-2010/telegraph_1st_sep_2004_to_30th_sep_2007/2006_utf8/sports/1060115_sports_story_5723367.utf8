 Atwal soars, Kapur misses cut

Honolulu: Indias Arjun Atwal carded a fine one-under 69 to move up to tied-17th at the midway stage of the $5.1 million Sony Open at a windy par-70 Waialae Golf and Country Club here on Friday. 

Shiv Kapur, Rookie of the Year on the Asian Tour in 2005, faltered with a three-over 73 for the second day running and missed the cut in his first-ever USPGA Tour appearance. 

Still, it was a learning curve for the young Indian star who now goes back to Asian and European Tour events in the next few weeks. 

Indo-Swede Daniel Chopra, buoyed by an 18th hole eagle, slotted a five-under 65 and ensured a tee time for the weekend. He is now one-over 141 for two days, the cut coming at three-over. Asias standard bearer was still K.J. Choi, who despite a 71, was three-under 137 for two days in tied-eighth. Choi was two shots ahead of Atwal. 

Chad Campbell and Jim Furyk shot three-under 67 each to tie for the lead. 

And the weekend will not see Michelle Wie, who despite a second round of two-under 68, missed the cut at seven-over after a 79 on first day. 

Atwal played very steady and tamed the winds to a certain extent, as he had just two bogeys but three birdies. His putting was quite on the mark as he needed just 26 putts to go through the round but he still left a lot to be desired off the tee. He looked headed for an over-par round when he birdied the 17th and 18th in succession to get into the red. (PTI)

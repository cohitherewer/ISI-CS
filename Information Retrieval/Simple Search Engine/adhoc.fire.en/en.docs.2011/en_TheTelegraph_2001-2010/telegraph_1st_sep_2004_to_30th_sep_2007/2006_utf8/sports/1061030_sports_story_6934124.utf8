 Japan win 2-0

Bangalore: Fancied Japan beat North Korea 2-0 in a group C encounter of the AFC Youth Championship here on Sunday. 

Favourites to top a group which also includes Iran and Tajikistan, the Japanese asserted their supremacy over the North Koreans, who have qualified for the tournament after a gap of 16 years. But the Koreans were not outplayed at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium. 

Kazuhisa Kawahara scored in the 32nd minute off a pass from Yasuhito Morishama to put the five-time losing finalists ahead. Yosuke Kashiwagi extended the lead, finding a Kawahara pass in the 82nd minute. 

The North Koreans played well in patches and did test Japan. They had a couple of chances to score, but generally lacked the thrust to penetrate the Japan defence. (PTI)

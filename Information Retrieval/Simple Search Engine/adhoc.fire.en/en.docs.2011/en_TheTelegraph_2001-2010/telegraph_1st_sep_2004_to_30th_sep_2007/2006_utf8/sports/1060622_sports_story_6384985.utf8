 Go for broke is Socceroos coach Hiddinks order

 - Nothing short of victory will do for Croatia 

Oehringen: Australia coach Guus Hiddink has ordered the Socceroos to go for broke in their World Cup clash with Croatia on Thursday, telling them it was too dangerous to try to hold out for a draw. 

The Australians are guaranteed a place in the last 16 if they beat Croatia but can also go through with a draw if Japan fail to beat Brazil by three goals in the other group F game. 

The odds are heavily stacked in their favour, but Hiddink said he wanted his players to play their natural game and push for victory. 

Its impossible to say to this team, who like to attack, to sit back and go for a 0-0 draw, he told a news conference on Wednesday. 

Its opposing the character of this team so we will be going for a win. Its impossible to be a director of a draw. 

Defender and former captain Craig Moore said the players agreed with Hiddinks instructions and were approaching the match thinking they must win. 

Every game for us, as long as were here, will be like a Cup final for us, he said. It can be dangerous playing for a draw so we have to attack. You must look to improve all the time. 

Croatia will definitely have a huge crack at us so that will open things up so we can maybe look to get things on the counterattack as well. 

Australia are making their first appearance at the World Cup in 32 years and have already surpassed anything they did before by winning their first match against Japan, but have since raised their target. 

Why should we say goodbye after this game, wed love to have some more, Hiddink said. There is a lot of ambition to make the dream come true and make the second round. The boys are so committed. Were not thinking the end is near. 

Croatia, semi-finalists in 1998 but no longer the force they were eight years ago, must win to stay alive in the competition. 

Thursdays match was looming as the decisive one in the group when the draw was announced earlier this year and everything points to an even contest that could go either way. 

They have similar personnel and styles of playing, and are bonded by ancestral links ? seven of Australias players, including captain Mark Viduka, have Croatian parents, while three of the Croats were raised in Australia.

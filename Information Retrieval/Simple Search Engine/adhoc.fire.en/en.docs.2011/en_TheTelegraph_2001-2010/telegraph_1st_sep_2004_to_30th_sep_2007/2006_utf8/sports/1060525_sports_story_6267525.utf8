Birmingham: England will 

 try to reassert themselves when they take on Sri Lanka in 

 the second Test at Edbgaston after letting the first Test 

 slip through their fingers.

 Nine dropped catches at Lords, 

 allied to a gutsy batting display by the tourists in their 

 second innings, saw England miss the opportunity to go 1-0 

 up in the best of three contest after their batsmen had 

 piled up 551 for six declared.

 No-one within the England camp 

 has yet uttered the dread phrase must-win game 

 but a record of one win in their last eight Tests means 

 a fresh success cant come soon enough.

 England are set to be led again 

 by Andrew Flintoff, continuing to deputise as captain in 

 place of Michael Vaughan who remains sidelined by a knee 

 injury.

 With Kevin Pietersen (158), Marcus 

 Trescothick (106) and Alastair Cook (89), Vaughans 

 replacement at No. 3, all making runs at Lords it 

 wasnt so much his runs as their skippers leadership 

 skills that England missed most.

 England have retained uncapped 

 seamer Jon Lewis but dropped Ian Bell from their Lords 

 squad of 13.

 But Lewis wait for a first 

 Test cap could go on if the selectors stick with the same 

 side on a pitch that could offer more assistance to the 

 spinners than was the case at Lords.

 That would be good news for England 

 left-armer Monty Panesar but even more so for Sri Lanka 

 talisman Muttiah Muralidharan.

 Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene 

 led his side well with a battling hundred at Lords, 

 where former skipper Sanath Jayasuriya joined the squad.

 Jayasuriya, who didnt play 

 in that game, might be a candidate to replace the out-of-form 

 Jehan Mubarak but Sri Lankas greatest concern appears 

 to be the lack of effective support for senior quick bowler 

 Chaminda Vaas.

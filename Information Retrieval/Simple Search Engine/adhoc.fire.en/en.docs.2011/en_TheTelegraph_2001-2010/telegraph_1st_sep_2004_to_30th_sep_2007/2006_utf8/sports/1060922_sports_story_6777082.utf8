 One-over by Jeev

 - Rahil tied 34th in seoul

Ibaraki (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh opened with a none-too-impressive one-over 72 at the 120 million yen ACOM International 2006 to be placed tied 59th at the Ishioka Golf Club. 

The Indian started at the 10th hole and made a series of pars through his first nine holes, before embarking on an eventful second half of the round. 

His position could have been much better at tied 36th but for a double bogey on the third and a closing bogey on ninth. 

Mamo Osanai of Japan got off to a great start with a six-under 65 and was one shot ahead of Paul Sheehan. 

Osanai, a two-time champion on the Japan Tour, started with two birdies and also had a hattrick from 14th to 16th. His card had seven birdies and a lone bogey on the par-3 fourth. 

Jeev had birdies on first and seventh and a double bogey on third before finishing with a bogey. It was again a case of putting blues as he needed 31 putts. 

Meanwhile, in Seoul, Rahil Gangjee rallied with three birdies on the back nine to compile a one-under 70 on day one of the $700,000 Kolon Hana Bank Korea Open at the par-71 Woo Jeong Hills Country Club near here. 

Gangjee, one of the two Indians left in the field after Harmeet Kahlons withdrawal, was lying tied 34th while Amandeep Johl shot a one-over 72 to be tied 74th.

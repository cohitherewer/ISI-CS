The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 SAs charity drive 

Calcutta: Indian children infected with the HIV/Aids virus got the opportunity to interact with some of the South African stars at a hotel here in the city. Shaun Pollock, Andrew Hall, AB de Villers and former allrounder Jonty Rhodes came forward to join Unicef and UNAIDs campaign and spent time with the 15 children, who had come to meet the cricketers from Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and various parts of Gujarat, says a Staff Reporter. 

 Pollock said, I am a father of two and having heard from some of these kids that they have no parents and live with their grandparents... It is really sad.

 Schumacher may move to Toyota

Berlin: Michael Schumachers manager hinted in a German newspaper interview on Tuesday that the former world champion could move to big-spending Toyota after Ferrari. 

There have always been surprises in Formula One, Willi Weber said, when asked about Schumachers comment that there was a one per cent chance he would move to a new team after his Ferrari contract expires at the end of 2006. 

And even if McLaren has (Fernando) Alonso in 2007, there are still big players in the market. 

Schumacher said he would not want to extend his career beyond 2006 if he is not able to win races again. He also said Ferrari needed more staff to get back on top. The magazine estimated Toyotas annual F1 budget at 400 million euros. 

How does that Toyota slogan go again? Weber said, referring to the adverts in Germany. Lets wait and see how the season starts. Theres enough time before the summer. Before that there wont be any decision.

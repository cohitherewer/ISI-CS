Melbourne: Spin-wizard Shane Warne could be sued by Sri Lankas Galle International Cricket Club for not honouring a pledge of $50,000 for the reconstruction of a tsunami-hit ground where he took his 500th Test wicket. 

We have not even seen a penny. I will give them three months to deliver. Otherwise I will sue, club director Jayananda Warnaweera said. 

But the former Sri Lankan Test cricketer said he would wait and see if Warne made any announcement at the fourth Ashes Test against England. 

That may not be necessary (to sue Warne). It is believed Warne will announce on Boxing Day the second anniversary of the tsunami five recipients of money from his $2 million foundation. One is expected to be the Sri Lankan cricket club, he was quoted as saying by a Lankan daily. 

Warnaweera said Shane Warne Foundation a charitable trust told the club in June that the cost of fund raising items like wristbands at last years Boxing Day Test was greater than the amount collected and no money would be sent to the club. 

Foundations then chief executive Brad Grapsas had first told Warnaweera that the club should get more than $50,000 and Warne was to present a cheque for $54,000 to the Sri Lankan cricket team in January but pulled out at the last minute, citing a family holiday. 

Grapsas then sent an e-mail to Warnaweera, saying less than 5000 wristbands, which cost $3 each, were sold and collections equalled the cost of manufacture. Therefore I regretfully inform you that there will be no funds to distribute to the Galle stadium, he said. 

Warnes personal assistant Helen Nolan has acknowledged no money had been handed over, the paper said. (PTI)

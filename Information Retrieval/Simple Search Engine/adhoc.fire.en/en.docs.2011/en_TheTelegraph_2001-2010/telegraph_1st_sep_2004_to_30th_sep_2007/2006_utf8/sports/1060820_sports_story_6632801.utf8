Calcutta: Both Mohun Bagan and Mohammedan Sporting have dropped points, and will therefore be cautious about keeping their slate clean when they face each other on Sunday in the Sahara CFL Premier Division tie at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

We will not go all out but play on counter attacks, Biswajit Bhattacharya said after Saturdays practice. While his counterpart Subhas Bhowmick said: We have lost a few points initially and dont want any lapses. 

Mohammedan Sporting will miss the services of Farookh Hyder and Subhasish Roy Chowdhury, out due to double booking, and they may be replaced by Habibur Rehman Mondal and Rajiv Ahmed. Mohun Bagans last hopes of getting Guy Ndem was obliterated as his ITC was still unavailable. They will also not get the Brazilians Eduardo Chakon Coelho and Jose Ramirez Barreto both of whom need some more time to get back to action. 

The green-and-maroon defence will see Deepak Mondal, Ravanan, Dulal and Bijoy Basfore with Sanjeev Maria playing in front as a blocker. Bhattacharya plans to field Satyajit Bose, Subhas Chakraborty and Mehrajuddin Wadao in the middle with Bhaichung Bhutia and Dipendu Biswas completing the line-up. Subrata Pal, it seems, will be under the bar. 

The black-and-whites will go with Raman Vijayan and Mike Okoro up front. To ensure a steady supply of balls, Bhowmick may opt for three midfielders Noel Wilson, Kalia Kulothungan and Bijen Singh with Debjit Ghosh playing the role of a blocker. Madhab Das and Douglas da Silva will take care of the defence along with Rajiv and Habibur. Gopal Das will be at the goal. 

Bhowmick, though he didnt specify anything, will keep Bhaichung under strict vigil. We have to think of him. He is an icon in Indian football, Bhowmick quipped. 

I dont consider our side as the favourites, as Mohun Bagan have the capacity of making a turnaround, he said.

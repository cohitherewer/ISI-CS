 Sachin lashes 91-ball 100

Cambridge: Sachin Tendulkar marked his comeback from shoulder surgery with a 91-ball 100 for Lashings World XI in a recreational match against Cambridge University XI at the Fenners Ground here on Wednesday. 

Sachin looked to be in good nick despite the long lay-off, negotiating the bowlers with ease. 

His only alarm came when he was on 80 as he spooned a reverse sweep to short leg but the wicketkeeper was unable to cling on to the hard chance. 

His 50 came up off 42 balls and he brought up his century with a push to mid-on for a single. 

Asked how his recovery was progressing before the start of the match, Sachin said: It is getting better. 

But he refused to be drawn into predicting whether he would be ready for a triangular series in Sri Lanka in August, where India will face their hosts and South Africa. 

Ill try (to be ready), was as much as he would say on that subject. 

Sachin is due to play five matches for Lashings, a charity fund-raising select that features former internationals such as the West Indies duo of Richie Richardson and Courtney Walsh. 

He also said that he was looking forward to easing himself back into cricket in a no pressure, relaxed environment. (Agencies)

 9-wicket haul by Zaheer

London: Zaheer Khan sent a reminder to the national selectors of his form as he claimed nine for 138 to blow away Essex and put Worcestershire in the drivers seat in a County Championship Division II match at the Chelmsford County Ground. 

Replying to Worcestershires mammoth 650 for 7 declared, Essex were tottering at 186 for nine with the Indian left-arm seamer claiming all the wickets at close on the second day Thursday. 

The 10th wicket Friday morning would also have been Zaheers, but a dropped catch by keeper Steven Davies allowed Darren Gough to escape and cost him the clean sweep. Essex were finally dismissed for 283. 

Zaheer started the rot after Varun Chopra and Mark Pettini put on a 117-run opening stand and pushed Essex from 132 for one to 150 for eight in no time. Four batsmen were out for zero and two others managed only five each.

 Lavolpe smokescreen

 Berlin: Fifa will write to Mexicos 

 colourful coach Ricardo Lavolpe asking him to stop smoking 

 during Mexicos World Cup matches. Although Lavolpe 

 is not breaking any regulations, Fifa has already asked 

 all coaches not to smoke during games. TV pictures showed 

 the 54-year-old Argentinian-born coach puffing away at pitchside 

 during his teams 3-1 win over Iran on Sunday. Fifa 

 spokesman Markus Siegler said on Monday Fifa would look 

 at replays of the coverage and ask him to observe the guidelines.

 Tunisia coach grateful for show of faith

 Schweinfurt: Tunisia coach Roger Lemerre 

 thanked his employers on Monday for showing such faith in 

 him after he signed a new contract to stay with the north 

 African side until 2008. The President of the Tunisian federation 

 Hamouda Ben Ammar announced the new deal on Sunday, saying 

 they had based their decision on four years of good work. 

 Im very pleased about the confidence placed 

 in me and it also shows my commitment, the Frenchman 

 told a news conference.

 injured defender Mehdi Meriah. Fifa said that it had granted

 Andreas Isaksson is poised to return for Thursdays 

 World Cup group B match with Paraguay in Berlin, said coach 

 Lars Lagerback. Isaksson missed the 0-0 draw with Trinidad 

 amp; Tobago on Saturday after hitting his head on the ground 

 in training last week. At the moment he looks OK 

 and we hope he will be fit, Lagerback said on Monday.

 Trinidad.

 Spirit of the game

 Leverkusen: Defender Lee Young-pyo said 

 the number of Christians in South Koreas squad would 

 have a positive effect on their World Cup challenge.

 In 2002 we had six or seven players who were Christian. 

 Now we have 12, Lee told reporters on Sunday as the 

 squad prepared for the Group G clash with Togo in Frankfurt 

 on Tuesday. This is a very good thing for us because 

 I believe the 12 players will make us much stronger. I believe 

 Jesus will give me a good result at this World Cup.

 World of silence

 Phnom Penh: Phnom Penh patriarch Non 

 Nget has told Cambodias 40,000 Buddhist monks to 

 remain passive while watching World Cup soccer games or 

 be defrocked. He said on Monday monks should not watch the 

 games in public, cheer or bet on matches as such actions 

 were against Buddhism.

 It is very difficult to ban them because new technology 

 means the games can be aired live and seen everywhere, 

 he said. They may watch, but must be calm. But if 

 they make noise or cheer as they watch, they will lose their 

 monkhoods, Non Nget said. 

 No holy water, just sip...

 Hanover: There was no holy water 

 on Italys bench when they opened their World Cup 

 campaign against Ghana on Monday. In South Korea and Japan 

 four years ago, coach Giovanni Trapattoni had a small plastic 

 bottle of water next to him in the dugout but his successor 

 Marcello Lippi did not follow suit. I havent 

 brought holy water, Lippi told reporters on Sunday. 

 A friend gave me some wine as a good-luck gift and 

 told me to take it with me to the World Cup but I havent 

 brought it. Ive already drunk a good part of it.

 10 Croatian fans banned

 Zagreb: Ten Croatian soccer fans were 

 banned from the World Cup after German border police found 

 they were carrying items to hurt people, Croatian police 

 said Monday. The fans, who travelled by train for Croatias 

 first match against Brazil on Tuesday, possessed a 

 large amount of pyrotechnics and other banned items, 

 said Croatian police chief Marijan Benko.

 Gaddafi slams Fifa

 Tripoli: Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi 

 hit out at world governing body Fifa for operating what 

 he called a soccer slave market that deprived 

 poor nations of talented players and fostered racism among 

 supporters. In a message on his personal website, Gaddafi 

 said if Fifa could not run its operations in ways more favourable 

 to the worlds poor then it should be abolished. Instead 

 of promoting international friendship, what happened 

 is the spread and deepening of hatred, he said.

 Fifa denial

 Berlin: Fifa has strongly denied allegations 

 of bribery and corruption made in the BBC television programme 

 on Sunday night.

 In a wide-ranging investigation into fifa, reporter Andrew 

 Jennings said that senior Fifa officials including president 

 Sepp Blatter and his predecessor Joao Havelange had abused 

 their positions in relation to their former, and now defunct, 

 commercial partner, International Sport and Leisure (ISL).

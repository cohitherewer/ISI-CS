 Verdict deferred

Karachi: The appeals commission, hearing Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asifs plea to overturn their ban for positive dope tests, has deferred its verdict after failing to reach a consensus on Wednesday. 

There is definitely a divided opinion among the three members of the tribunal on what to do with the appeals of the two players. That is why the delay in announcing the decision on their pending appeals, a Pakistan Cricket Board source said. 

Justice (retd) Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim heads the appellate tribunal which also includes former Test player Hasib Ahsan and Danish Zaheer, who heads the Pakistan Sports Medicine Association. 

The players went with their appeals to the tribunal after a drugs inquiry tribunal found them guilty of taking banned substance and banned Shoaib for two years and Asif for one year.

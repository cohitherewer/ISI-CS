 Bhutia backs De Ridder

 - Ashim Biswas signs for EB

 Philippe de Ridder and Bhaichung 

Calcutta: At a time when East Bengal club officials are contemplating changing Philippe de Ridder, senior pro Bhaichung Bhutia has come out in support of the beleaguered coach on Wednesday. 

I dont think why the team officials are thinking to sack him. I firmly believe that he is better than those are in the fray, said the star striker during a press conference, where he was announced as the brand ambassador of Wai Wai noodles. 

A day after Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira was being tipped as a possible replacement for the Belgian, Bhaichungs comments have indeed assumed significance. 

I think he (De Ridder) may lose his job because he had some problems with the officials. But we have done a good job by finishing second in the league under his guidance, he said. 

He also brushed aside allegations that the players complained against the coach. Those who complained were the ones who were injured and unfit and never got a chance to play, Bhaichung pointed out. 

Meanwhile, Salgaocars Ashim Biswas and Ever Ready defender Amulya Mondal signed for East Bengal on Wednesday.

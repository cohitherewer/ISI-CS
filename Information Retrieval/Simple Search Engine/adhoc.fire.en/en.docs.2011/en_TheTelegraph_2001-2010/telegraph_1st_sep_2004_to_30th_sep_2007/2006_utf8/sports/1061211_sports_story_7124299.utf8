The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bindras clarification on 2011 final

 - World Cup co-hosts didnt sign agreement in London 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Inderjit Singh Bindra has clarified that no agreement was signed between the four Test-playing nations from Asia, co-hosts of the 2011 World Cup, when they met on the sidelines of the International Cricket Councils AGM earlier this year. 

Thats significant as reports from Pakistan have said that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is firm on staging the final. Shaharyar Khan was the PCB chairman when the Big Four met in London. Now, of course, Dr Nasim Ashraf is in the chair. 

Earlier, word had got around that the showpiece match would be in New Delhi. 

While the title-round of the 1987 edition (jointly hosted by India and Pakistan) was held in Calcutta, the final of the 1996 World Cup (staged by India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) was in Lahore. 

Wed met informally and nothing was cast in stone... However, its a fact that the discussions centered around Bangladesh hosting the opening ceremony, Pakistan and Sri Lanka one semi-final each and India the final, Bindra told The Telegraph on Sunday, after returning from Dubai. 

He added: What was also discussed is that Pakistan would get both semi-finals if Sri Lanka didnt make the last-four stage... 

This clarification from Bindra, who played a significant role in the World Cup returning to Asia, has come on the eve of another informal meeting, in New Delhi, convened by BCCI president Sharad Pawar. 

According to Bindra, everything will be settled on mutually acceptable terms and who stages the final wont be an issue which could spoil the close relationship between the BCCI and the PCB. 

Weve been working together from 1983-84... Thats a long innings, he pointed out, adding that the 2011 World Cup wasnt discussed in Dubai the other day, when both he and Dr Ashraf happened to be around at the same time. 

As the PCB chairman is landing in New Delhi late in the afternoon, Mondays meeting is likely to begin at 7.00 pm. 

Incidentally, Sri Lanka Cricket chief Jayantha Dharmadasa is unwell and, so, chief executive Duleep Mendis (a former captain) is going to be there. Owing to the change in Bangladesh, its not clear who will be that countrys representative. 

Meanwhile, one understands New Delhi may become the HQ for the joint organisation. The joint committee, though, is yet to be put in place.

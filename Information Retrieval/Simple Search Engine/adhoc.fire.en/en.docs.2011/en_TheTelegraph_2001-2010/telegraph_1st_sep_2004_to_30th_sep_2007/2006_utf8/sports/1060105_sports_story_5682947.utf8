The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I realised just a big serve wasnt enough: Bopanna

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bopanna 

Chennai: There were three things very visible in Rohan Bopannas game when he first hit the headlines at the domestic level: A really powerful serve, a one-dimensional style and a tendency to choke. 

That was four years ago. 

Just when he seemed to have ironed out the flaws while retaining his major weapon, the curse of injury hit the tall, robust lad from Coorg. He developed a biceps problem on his right arm, tried to come back after resting for four months only to aggravate it, and ultimately, had to undergo surgery. 

Its nine months since Bopanna resumed competitive tennis after being out of it for the same period. And what a second coming it has been! 

A string of consistent results in the Challenger and Futures circuits has hauled him from the despairing depths of world No. 600-something to 266. His ranking is sure to improve a few notches next Monday after the dream run hes going through at the Chennai Open. 

I was a bit disappointed to lose in the national grasscourt final (to Vishal Uppal) and thus miss out on a wild card in Chennai, Bopanna told The Telegraph the morning after creating a ripple at the Nungambakkam Stadium. Now, of course, I have no regrets. In fact, Im glad I had to go through the qualifiers because those three matches sharpened my game and helped give off my best against (Cyril) Saulnier. 

Bopanna cared little for the reputation of the world No. 90, who featured in an ATP event final less than a year ago, and handed the Frenchman a straight-set pasting. 

Up next for the daredevil qualifier is Luxembourgs Gilles Muller, the left-hander who knocked Rafael Nadal out of Wimbledon and dumped Andy Roddick from the US Open last year. 

I havent seen him (Muller) in action but its obvious from the results that he is a very good player. But Im not bothering about his game, I just want to continue the way Ive been playing, said Bopanna, oozing confidence. 

Confidence, thats the key word. As he showed during his Davis Cup match against former Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson in Delhi last September, Bopanna now has the artillery to fight the best. 

My game was a bit too serve-oriented. I realised just a big serve wont take me too far. I worked hard on my groundstrokes with (Prahlad) Srinath and the Bhupathis. Now, I can play from the backcourt and not necessarily come up to the net all the time. 

I stayed back a lot in the four matches here and its yielding results. I know Im a more mature player now, Bopanna observed. 

He may yet conquer a few more peaks this week, but beyond Chennai, Bopanna is quite looking forward to his first ever Grand Slam. 

Im really excited about playing in the Australian Open? Ive got into the qualifying draw, Bopanna remarked, betraying no disappointment that its taken him so long to get a look-in at one of the four majors. 

I started a bit late and didnt have great success as a junior. Then came the injury at the wrong time, soon after I played a great match against then French Open finalist Martin Verkerk (who managed to win 12-10 in the fifth set) in a Davis Cup tie in The Netherlands. 

But he fact is, theres nothing I can do about these things. All I can do now is to play to the best of my ability, said the late bloomer who will be turning 26 in March. 

Bopanna realises the importance of a travelling coach, but cant afford one right now. I need a sponsor, lamented Bopanna, who just has a clothing and shoe deal with Nike. 

I sincerely hope that more sponsors will come into tennis after seeing what an Indian can do at the international level. Sanias success can do wonders for players like us. 

A soft-spoken person by nature (I talk only when I have to), Bopanna is comfortable with the media attention hes been getting since the Davis Cup tie versus Sweden. 

Im not complaining at all. Its great to see tennis getting so much media space, it will help us, Bopanna signed off. 

Its still early days. But there is a faint possibility that 2006 could be Bopannas year just as 2005 was Sania Mirzas.

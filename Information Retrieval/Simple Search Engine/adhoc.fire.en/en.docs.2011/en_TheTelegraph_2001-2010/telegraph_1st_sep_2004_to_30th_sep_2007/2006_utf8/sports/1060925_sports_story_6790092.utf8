 amazing on big points

 A Telegraph picture 

 Two good wins over Kloesel and 

 then Rezai set up my semi-final clash against one of the 

 legends of world tennis. Martina Hingis went on to give 

 me an abject lesson on controlled tennis that can only make 

 me richer in knowledge and experience.

 On Saturday, I was not at my best 

 but neither did I play too badly. The key was that Martina 

 never allowed me to get into the match with her subtle variations 

 and pin-point accuracy. At 30-all, she would come up with 

 the most devastating strokes. Tennis is all about the big 

 points and the way she plays the big points is a lesson 

 in itself.

 She converted five out of the 

 seven break-points that she created, while I was unable 

 to convert even one of the six I earned, that tells a story. 

 I also allowed her to get back from 40-0 and 40-15 in two 

 of my service games in the second set and the way she played 

 most of those important points was amazing.

 One of the secrets of Martinas 

 success, I feel, is the fact that she hits the ball very 

 early, which makes it difficult to read her strokes because 

 it gives you hardly any time to react. Ive played 

 against some of the worlds leading players before 

 but there is none who uses her brain to construct points 

 better than Martina.

 Fourth-seeded Rezai of France 

 is a rising talent. I was delighted to put it across her 

 in the quarter finals. She reached the last-16 of the US 

 Open and the third round of the French Open, and is the 

 owner of a devastating backhand shot! I have not played 

 anyone who hits the ball harder and more accurately than 

 this French girl. The world will hear a lot about this unassuming 

 girl once she has polished some of the weaker areas of her 

 game.

 It was wonderful signing off the 

 week with the doubles title, which helped me complete a 

 hattrick in India with Liezel. It was tight till 5-4 in 

 the first set, then we raised our level. The 10th game was 

 crucial, so was the opening game of the second set when 

 we recovered from 0-40 on Liezels serve.

 Before my fans start thinking 

 that Ill now turn a doubles specialist, let me state 

 that Ill be concentrating hard on singles for the 

 rest of the year to try and regain some of the lost ground. 

 I wont certainly be playing doubles the next three 

 weeks in Seoul, Tashkent and Bangkok.

 I cannot wind up without mentioning 

 the support I got this week. The Calcutta crowd was absolutely 

 amazing, and deserved an Indian victory. They came in huge 

 numbers, not only to support their countrywomen but also 

 to watch the great talents from other countries. 

 The love that the people of this 

 city have for sport has to be seen to be believed. As a 

 sportsperson, it has been a delightful experience to perform 

 at the Sunfeast Open.

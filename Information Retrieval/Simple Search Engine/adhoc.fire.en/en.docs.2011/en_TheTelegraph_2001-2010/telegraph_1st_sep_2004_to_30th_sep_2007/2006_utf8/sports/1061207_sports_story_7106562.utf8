 Indian volte-face over Rathore comments

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore 

Doha: The Indian officials at the Asian Games made a kind of volte-face and obliquely blamed the media for remarks attributed to Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore that has landed the ace shooter in trouble with the Doha Asian Games Organising Committee (DAGOC). 

Rathore, on Tuesday, accused the organisers of trying to scuttle his chances at the Games, following which the Games organising committee asked the IOA to tender an apology on behalf of Rathore for his unwarranted allegations and even threatened legal action. 

Ramlal Thakur, the Chef-de-Mission, on Wednesday said in a statement that the comments, widely reported by the media, were a misrepresentation of facts. 

With reference to the news item that appeared in the newspapers, Mr Rathore, who is a responsible athlete, never said anything against DAGOC, and it seems, it is a case of misrepresentation of facts, the statement said. DAGOC has made nice arrangements for the comfort of all athletes in and outside the village. We have all respect for the organisers and all those who are associated with the Games, directly and indirectly. I may also add here that our relations with the State of Qatar are age-old and most graceful. 

Rathore is leaving for India on Thursday.

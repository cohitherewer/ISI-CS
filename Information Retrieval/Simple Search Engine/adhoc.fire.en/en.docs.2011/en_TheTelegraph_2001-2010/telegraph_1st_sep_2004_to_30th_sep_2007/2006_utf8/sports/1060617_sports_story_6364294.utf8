 An incredible performance: Rodriguez

 Diego Maradona during the match on 

 Friday

Gelsenkirchen: Argentina authored the biggest rout at this years World Cup so far, a 6-0 verdict over Serbia and Montenegro on Friday. 

This was an incredible performance, said Maxi Rodriguez, who netted a brace. Esteban Cambiasso, Hernan Crespo, Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi were the other scorers in the group C tie. 

The victory meant two-time champions Argentina, who opened with a 2-1 victory over Ivory Coast, are virtually through to the second round, while Serbia and Montenegro have been eliminated. 

This is a very good group, Cambiasso said. The team is solid, and we have a lot of confidence. ... It couldnt have gone better. 

Argentine fans, starting to sense something special, were deafening in the closed-roof stadium with chants of Ole, Ole and AR-gen-tina, AR-gen-tina. 

Another screaming serenade, with Diego Maradona swirling a blue-and-white jersey above his head and joining in, also rang out over and over: Vamos a salir campeones, como en 86 (meaning, were going to be champions, just like in 86.) 

Maradona helped Argentina win that last title, and watching this rout, its not difficult to start believing it could happen again. 

Tevez, who is only 22 and already a star with 18-year-old Messi, praised the teamwork ? the deft passes and perfectly timed shots. 

With only four players back from the 2002 team which exited in the first round, this team is young and a pure product of coach Jose Pekerman. 

Seventeen of the 23-man team played for Pekerman when he coached Argentina to three world youth titles ? in 95, 97 and 2001. 

When everyone does it together, its like that, Tevez said. The first two goals were masterpieces. 

Argentina got off to a perfect start with Rodriguez scoring in the sixth minute. He finished off his shot at the end of perfect passes down the left side from captain Juan Pablo Sorin and Javier Saviola. 

Argentina made it 2-0 in the 31st, a classic goal by Cambiasso, who entered in the 17th for the injured Luis Gonzalez. Argentina held possession with a string of two dozen passes. At the finish, Saviola found Cambiasso, who found Crespo, who back-heeled the ball for Cambiassos left-footed finish. 

It couldnt have gone any better, Cambiasso said. The moment I came in, one of the first balls I touch is a goal. Were really working well as a group, he added. 

This team is solid and we are very confident. We know we havent achieved anything yet. We have to stay relaxed on the path we want to take, because its a long road and its hardly just begun.

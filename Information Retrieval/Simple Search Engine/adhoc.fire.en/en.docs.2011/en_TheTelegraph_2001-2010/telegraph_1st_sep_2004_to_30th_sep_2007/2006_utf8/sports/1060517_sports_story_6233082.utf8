 Henry fired by Cup heartache

 - Ronaldinho, Eto promise all-out attack 

 DAVID BOND in PARIS

 Henry is prepared to sideline flair for results 

Thierry Henry has revealed how the disappointment of missing out on playing in the World Cup final in 1998 is driving him to Champions League glory against Barcelona on Wednesday. 

The French striker returns to the Stade de France for the final in Paris, arguably his biggest game since France defeated Brazil to lift the World Cup eight years ago. 

The climax to the European club season between Henrys Arsenal and Ronaldinhos Barcelona is the most eagerly anticipated Champions League final for years. 

But for Henry it is also an opportunity to banish the memories of having to watch his countrys finest moment from the substitutes bench. 

He said: I have never told this story but I was warming up and I was supposed to come on 10 minutes after the beginning of the second half, but Marcel Desailly got sent off and the plan changed. 

I respected it. On the spur of the moment I was disappointed obviously that I didnt come on. But once you know you are going to lift that Cup you cant be that upset. I was 20, I played six games at the end of the day. 

So strong is his desire to lead Arsenal to European glory that the Premier Leagues great entertainer would rather win than put on a great show for the purists. 

Definitely you have the players to put on a show in Paris, but its about winning, Henry said. Whether you play well or dont play well. 

While Henry and Arsenal might be prepared to use more prosaic methods to achieve their aim, Barcelonas Ronaldinho is promising all-out attack in Paris. 

An awesome front line that already boasts the Brazilian World and European Player of the Year, Cameroon international Samuel Eto and Swedens Henrik Larsson, could be further enhanced by the return of Argentine teenager Lionel Messi. 

Messi, recovering from a thigh injury, came through a full training session on Monday and will travel to Paris. 

Ronaldinho said: The match is one of the biggest dreams of my life and more so because it is Paris. It will be a great game between two great teams who play on the attack. Were all 100 per cent, all very motivated and I can only imagine good things. 

Eto, Spains top goal-scorer, added: Arsenal have the best defence in the Champions League? Well, we have the best strikeforce in this competition. We will try to find solutions to score. 

Uefa have put Norwegian referee Terje Hauge in charge of Wednesdays final, a hardliner who attracted criticism for his decision to send off Chelseas Asier del Horno in their second-round clash with Barcelona in February.

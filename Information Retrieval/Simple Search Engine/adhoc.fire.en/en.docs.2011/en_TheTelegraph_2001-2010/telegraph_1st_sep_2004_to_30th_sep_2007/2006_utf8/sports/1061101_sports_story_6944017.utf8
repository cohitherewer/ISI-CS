The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jordan recover to beat error-prone India 3-2 

 - AFC YOUTH MEET

 Hosts virtually out after a draw and a loss

 Jordan players congratulate Ahmad Nofal after he scored the first of his two goals against India at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture 

Calcutta: Indias chances of making it to the next round of the AFC Youth Championship were almost reduced to zilch on Tuesday when they failed to protect a lead and instead, went down 2-3 to Jordan at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

Branco Cardozo put the hosts ahead in the 26th minute, but that joy was too fleeting to stay alive as Jordan equalised within nine minutes through Bader Abu Salim. Ahmad Nofal, who replaced Loly al Zaideh seconds before the first-half, dealt the Indians another blow when he reaped benefits from a series of defensive blunders in the 64th minute. 

Though Mohun Bagan striker Sushil Singh was somehow lucky to bring parity in no time, Nofal handed Jordan a deserving victory with another opportunistic strike four minutes from time. 

India were reduced to 10 men in the dying minutes of the match when midfielder Thoi Khangembam received the marching orders following his tackle from behind on Baha Suleiman. 

Having drawn with Kyrgyzstan in the first match and then lost to Jordan, India now face an early exit from the tournament. Islam Akhmedovs boys will be pitted against the defending champions and title-favourites South Korea in the final league match while Jordan will have a comparatively easy opponents in Kyrgyzstan. 

Its not that an upset is not impossible against the Koreans, but such ifs and buts couldve easily been avoided if India showed a little better cohesion and composure in the first two matches. 

Defeats, they say, provide you a learning opportunity, but problem begins when defeats become synonymous with disappointments. This is exactly the case with this Indian under-20 side now. 

Forget about these boys failure in defending Brancos lead, forget also about Sushils equaliser riding a bit of luck. But how can you describe such shoddy, sub-standard defence? How can you explain one folly after another by Shilton Paul under the bar? 

Akhmedov blamed the defeat on his goalkeeper after the match, but the Uzbek coach must now need to take some responsibility on his own shoulders. After all, if players showed shilly-shallying under pressure as they did against the Jordanians, a major part of it goes to the coachs ill-planning. 

Akhmedov has been with these players for quite some, but he hardly gave us any moments to cherish. Loose strategy Lalkamal Bhowmick, the star against Kyrgyzstan, was introduced only in the second half on Tuesday makes a bigger noise before defeat. Akhmedov must accept it. 

Lets go a bit deeper into the three Jordan goals. How Bani Yaseen kept the ball back into play from an acute angle following a corner and how it was allowed to travel from one post to another before hitting the far post and Bader snapping up the rebound, was a tale of bad defending. 

It became worse in the next two goals and on both occasions Shilton seemed to have forgot the basics of goalkeeping. 

When Nofal collected the ball between two defenders a few yards away from the box, the India keeper was standing off his line. Had he been behind on his line, he would have had a better view and chance to save the Jordanians grounder. 

Then again, during the late killer blow in the 86th minute, the defenders first kept Tariq al Jumah unmarked for sending a floater into the box and then, Shilton, with his confidence already hitting a low point, refused to come out this time as Nofal scored on second attempt. 

Its a pity that there were hardly any supporters present at the stadium to cheer India in such a big tournament. Its more pitying that the players in the middle made their presence even more negligible. Period.

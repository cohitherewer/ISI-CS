The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Neelotpal is Indias 14th GM

A CORRESPONDENT

 Neelotpal 

 Calcutta: City based IM 

 Neelotpal Das completed his third and final GM norm in the 

 29th International Open at San Sebastien in Spain, where 

 he scored seven points out of a possible nine and was tied 

 for the first place with three others, according to information 

 received here on Monday. 

 Neelotpal, who presently has a rating of 2514, will 

 thus become Indias 14th Grandmaster and the fourth 

 from the city after Dibyendu Barua, Surya Sekhar Ganguly 

 and Sandipan Chanda. 

 A find of The Telegraph 

 Schools Chess Tournament in 1991, Neelotpal took rapid 

 strides thereafter, grabbing the second spot in the National 

 U-10 tournament in 1992 in Ahmedabad. 

He went on to finish seventh in the World U-10 in Germany in the same year, where compatriot Surya Sekhar Ganguly won the bronze. 

Beginning with a modest rating of 2110 in 1994, the bespectacled, shy youngster has made tremendous progress. He achieved his IM title at the United Insurance Masters Tournament in Dhaka in 1999. 

He was also a member of the Indian bronze winning team in the Asian team event in Jodhpur in 2003. 

He had achieved his earlier two norms at the Sort International Open and the Benasque International Open, both in Spain in 2005. 

Arguably, the best tactician among Surya Sekhar, Sandipan and Neelotpal ? all students of Goodricke National Chess Academy ? it was generally felt by the experts that Neelotpal would be the first to get the GM title. But Neelotpals confidence was shattered by his fathers death a few years back. It affected his play thereafter and he was forced to take up a job of ticket collector with the Railways. 

He regained his strength and confidence only after switching over to ONGC a couple of years back. 

Neelotpal is an excellent tactician and good in calculations. He should have been a Grandmaster at least a couple of years ago, said the citys first GM Barua. 

I have watched all three ? Surya, Sandipan and Neelotpal ? from a young age. All of them are unique in their own different ways. 

 I am happy he has made all his norms in Spain 

 where the competition was tough. He still is very shy by 

 nature and that is why he lacks killer instinct, but now 

 that he has got the title, his confidence level will definitely 

 soar, Barua added.

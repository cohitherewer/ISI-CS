Melbourne: Australia seized control of their Davis Cup quarter final tie with Belarus on Friday when both Lleyton Hewitt and Chris Guccione won their opening singles matches at Kooyong in Melbourne. 

Hewitt demolished Vladimir Voltchkov 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 in just 91 minutes to give the hosts a commanding 2-0 lead after Guccione had upset Max Mirnyi 7-6, 3-6, 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in a see-saw match that lasted nearly four hours. 

In Pau, Marat Safin gave Russia a 1-0 lead over France when he outlasted teenager Richard Gasquet 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-7, 6-1 on Friday. 

French No. 1 Gasquet ran out of steam at the end of an enthralling five-setter against the 2005 Australian Open champion. 

Safin broke early in the first set only for Gasquet to come back and force the Russian into a tie-break. Safin, however, held his nerve to win the opener with a powerful service winner. 

World No. 16 Gasquet defended an early break to take the second set before letting his opponent claim the third. 

The 19-year-old bravely held serve to force the fourth set to a tiebreak in which he crushed Safin 7-1 with some stunning backhand winners on the fast indoor surface. 

But Safin dominated the last set to seal a three-hour, 40-minute victory that laid to rest any fears about his match fitness. 

Guccione had shot to fame by winning the deciding rubber in Australias first round win over Switzerland, last month when Hewitt declared himself unavailable. 

The towering left-hander proved he was no one-hit wonder with a stirring victory over Mirnyi that featured 20 aces. 

Its the biggest win of my career, Guccione said. In front of my home crowd theres no better feeling. I was very nervous but I relaxed into the match. 

Australias non-playing captain John Fitzgerald said Gucciones surprise victory had given the team the perfect platform to go on and win the best-of-five tie and set up a semi-final meeting with either Croatia or Argentina. 

It was great for him and it does open up the day when youve got a player of (Hewitts) calibre coming in second, said Fitzgerald. 

Mirnyi, ranked 51st in the world, 117 places above Guccione, refused to concede the tie was over but admitted his loss was a major setback. 

Sure its a disappointment when youre number one in your team and youre playing their number two, youre expected to win every time, Mirnyi said.

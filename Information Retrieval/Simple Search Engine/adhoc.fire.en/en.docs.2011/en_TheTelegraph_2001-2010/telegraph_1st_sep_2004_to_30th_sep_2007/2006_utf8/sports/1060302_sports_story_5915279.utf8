New Delhi: For the thousand odd Yemen fans, it was more like a home match at the Ambedkar Stadium here on Wednesday. Among the 5000 spectators, they were the most vociferous. Coming from far away places like Aligarh and Lucknow, they sang, danced and cheered their team throughout and at the end of the Asian Cup qualifier, they were the proudest lot. 

The Indians, on the contrary, had to leave with their heads down. They were witness to one of the most shameful moments of Indian football. Never before in the recent past has the national team looked such a clueless lot. That, too, against a team which is ranked 21 places below the hosts in the Fifa rankings. 

Yemen coach called the Indian defence a disjointed lot. It was perhaps an understatement. The defenders, it looked, were never introduced to each other formally. 

It took less than five minutes for Yemen to pick up their first goal and for the rest of the proceedings they looked good enough to score whenever they pressed. The absence of N. S. Manju and Mahesh Gawli really made the difference. 

Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin had been talking of hard work and fight till death for the past one month. The Indian midfield and attack courted death even before they could put up a semblance of a fight. For 90 minutes, Yemen goalkeeper Muaad Abdullah collected just two balls as Indian attackers could barely manage to enter the rival box. 

No one around was sure about Nayeemuddins actual gameplan. That included the footballers, too. Pitted against a team which never looked any better than a top NFL side, the Indian midfield could never stretch the rival defence, leave alone creating a move for their men in the upfront. Bhaichung fought a lonely battle in the first half, but never received the required support. In the second half, he came down in the midfield. It hardly worked. Abdul Hakkim remained a passenger. 

For India, the match was over in the first half. Sanjeev Marias first attempt to take the ball in the fifth minute resulted in a foul. Salem Abdullahs free kick from around 25 yards did not bear much punch, but eluded the wall to fool Sandeep Nandy at the near post. 

The Indian defence really stood exposed two minutes before the breather. 

Striker Al Nono initiated a move from the right and cut past three to cross the ball at the goalmouth. It took quite a few seconds for Al Hubaishi Fekri to control the ball, yet no Indian defender could earn a successful tackle. The Yemeni forward turned around and slammed in. 

Al Nono and Al-Omqy were the pick of the lot for the visitors. Both were fast, skilful and played havoc with Indian defence. 

Nono was finally rewarded with a goal in the 58th minute. Fekri won a ball on the top of the Indian box and as he moved in, N. P. Pradeep brought him down from behind. Nandy conceded his ninth goal in two outings without knowing which way the ball went.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Imran credits Inzamam with revival of Pak cricket

 - I dont need to be protected, says iconic World Cup-winning captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Despite being a trenchant critic of the Establishment, right through his decade in politics, there isnt a semblance of security at Imran Khans residence here ? in Zaman Park. Getting past an aged caretaker is no big deal and, then, one encounters young nephews and nieces... 

Imran, though, is cool. 

I dont need to be protected... Dont feel the need to be surrounded by securitymen, he told The Telegraph, smiling, late on Friday afternoon. The iconic World Cup-winning captain, now a Member of the National Assembly, remains a believer in destiny. 

Nowadays, of course, much of Imrans time is spent in Islamabad. However, the Lahori in him hasnt changed and its difficult to decline the many invitations he receives during brief visits to this charming city. 

The days first half was pretty hectic and there were engagements for the evening as well. At the crack of dawn, Imran will head for Islamabad (this is an interesting ? probably, defining ? time for the opposition parties...). 

Engagement No.1 was giving tips to quick Mohammed Sami during the Pakistan probables informal nets at the Academy off the Gaddafi. Incidentally, captain Inzamam-ul Haq was present (with hands behind the back) for much of the interaction. 

Later, as Imran prepared to leave for the gym, he had a one-on-one for around five minutes. Oh, that was about strategy... Obviously, I cant tell you what I told Inzy, Imran remarked. 

Not that Inzamam was looking for a boost ahead of a tough six weeks, but Imran gave him credit for reviving Pakistan cricket: He has been leading from the front and his performances have lifted the team... Even Shoaib (Akhtar) is a changed cricketer. 

Its a huge endorsement. 

In any case, Imran has consistently maintained Inzamam has no peers if delivering under pressure is the yardstick. 

Talking of Sami, Imran said: Owing to injuries, he hasnt been able to develop that wicket-taking ability... He isnt short on talent, but needs to bowl more at the highest level... Depending on the schedule, I can have more sessions during the forthcoming matches. 

Sami was delighted. Id requested Imranbhai for guidance and Im happy he helped out during a nets session... Hopefully, the tips are going to be useful... Besides technical things, he spoke about the mental aspect... Of working on the batsmans mind and... 

Imran has suggested that if the two Ws (Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis) have the time, they could work with Sami as well. Given that what he says is respected, the two may soon follow him. 

Sami, clearly, is privileged.

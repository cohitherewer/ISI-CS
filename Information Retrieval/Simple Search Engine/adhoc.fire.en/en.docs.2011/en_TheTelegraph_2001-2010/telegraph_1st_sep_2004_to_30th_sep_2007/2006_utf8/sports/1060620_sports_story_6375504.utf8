 Kewell willing to apologise 

Oehringen: Harry Kewell regrets his outburst to the referee after Australias match against Brazil, the countrys top soccer official said on Monday, adding he hoped Fifa will not sanction the Liverpool winger. 

The incident was very unfortunate, it shouldnt have happened. Harry regrets it. Hes very remorseful, Football Federation Australia CEO John Neill said. 

A suspension could keep Kewell from Australias game on Thursday against Croatia.

I think Harry will apologise to the referee, he said. Hes a player with a very, very good record. (AP)

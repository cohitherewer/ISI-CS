 NZ aim for clean sweep

Napier: New Zealand have no intention of easing up on Sri Lanka as they aim for a clean sweep in the fifth and final one-day International which ends here on Sunday. 

They are adamant a 5-0 outcome is the right therapy after being on the end of a whitewash themselves in South Africa two months ago. 

For the dejected Sri Lankans, their motivation rests with an urgent need to restore some pride before heading to the tri-series with Australia and South Africa next week. 

New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming, who missed the first two games while on paternity leave, is in doubt for the final game with a groin strain, as is paceman Shane Bond with a thigh strain and allrounder Scott Styris.

 Lions clinch crown

Chandigarh: A brace by Hari Parsad helped Bangalore Lions pick up a convincing 2-1 victory over local favourites Chandigarh Dynamos and lift the second edition of the Premier Hockey League (PHL) here on Wednesday night. 

An in form Hari put the Lions in lead in the second quarter of the match when captain Arjun Halappas powerful drag flick rebounded from the pad of Dynamos goalkeeper Baljeet Singh and ball went to Len Aiyappa who passed it to Hari. 

The first quarter was evenly balanced with both the teams making a number of forays. 

Tejbir Singh of Dynamos and Ajay Saroha of Lions were shown the yellow card after a heated argument took place between them. 

Earlier, Dynamos also missed two successive penalty corners as Lions goalkeeper Bharat Chhetri blocked drag-flicker Sandeep Singhs hit. At the breather, Lions led by a solitary goal. (PTI)

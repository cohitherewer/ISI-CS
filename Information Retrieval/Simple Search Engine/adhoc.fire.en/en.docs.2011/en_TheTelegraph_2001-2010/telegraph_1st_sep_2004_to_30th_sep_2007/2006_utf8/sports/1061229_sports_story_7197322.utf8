 Lanka ride Sanaths 87-ball 111

Napier: Sanath Jayasuriya blasted 111 off just 87 balls as Sri Lanka chased down a daunting target of 286 with 10 overs to spare in the first one-day International against New Zealand here on Thursday. 

The hosts had looked well set after a fine century in only his third ODI by Ross Taylor helped New Zealand to 285 for eight from their 50 overs at McLean Park.

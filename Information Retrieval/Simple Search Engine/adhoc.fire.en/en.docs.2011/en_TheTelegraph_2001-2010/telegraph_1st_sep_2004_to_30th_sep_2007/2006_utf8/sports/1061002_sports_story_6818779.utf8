A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: City girl Shivika Burman lost in the semi-finals of the Jerry Simmons ITF Junior Circuit in Illinois. Shivika went down to second seed Sarah Woestmann of Germany 4-6, 0-6 at the University of Illinois courts. 

Shivika, seeded fourth and ranked 357 on the ITF list, got the better of US Cameron Hubbs 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (8-6) in the pre-quarter finals and pipped Alexandra Khabibulina, also from US, 6-3, 6-0 in the last eight clash. But the dream run ended when she was shown the door by Woestmann.

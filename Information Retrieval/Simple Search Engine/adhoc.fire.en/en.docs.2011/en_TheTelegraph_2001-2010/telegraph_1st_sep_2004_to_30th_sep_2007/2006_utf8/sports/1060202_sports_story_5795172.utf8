 Aussies gear up to face hostile SA fans

Melbourne: Australias cricketers are bracing for a hostile reception when their tour of South Africa begins later this month, with opener Matthew Hayden predicting on Wednesday they would see skippy hung up by the neck before the trip was over. 

But Hayden, referring to the iconic kangaroo often used as an Australian mascot, said the Aussies would be unlikely to report any abuse to authorities, as the South African players had done during their current tour here. 

Well see skippy hung up by the neck a couple of times and well have a chuckle at it ourselves and thats all part of it, Hayden told reporters. 

Veteran Australian players Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne said they expected a tough time from South African fans, but that was always the case and they had never had problems with racism there. 

You expect to cop a bit wherever you go, McGrath said. 

Warne predicted South African fans would nail us and rip into us but Hayden said they would try not to let any taunts or remarks affect them. (AFP)

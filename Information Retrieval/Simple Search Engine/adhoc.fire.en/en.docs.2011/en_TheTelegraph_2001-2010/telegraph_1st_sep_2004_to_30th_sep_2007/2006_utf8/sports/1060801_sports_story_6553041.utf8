 Boucher to lead SA in tri-series

Durban: Wicketkeeper-batsman Mark Boucher will lead South Africa in the upcoming triseries in Sri Lanka, Cricket South Africa said Monday. 

Chairman of selectors Haroon Lorgat said Ashwell Prince, who became the first coloured cricketer to lead South Africa in the Test series, was included in the 14-man ODI squad. 

With Ashwell not a certainty in our one-day side, we have asked Boucher to lead the team, Lorgat said in the statement. 

Graeme smith, the regular skipper, was ruled out of the series after suffering an ankle injury. Vice-captain Jacques Kallis is also out with an injury. The tri-series, also featuring Sri Lanka and India, is to be played from August 14 to 29.

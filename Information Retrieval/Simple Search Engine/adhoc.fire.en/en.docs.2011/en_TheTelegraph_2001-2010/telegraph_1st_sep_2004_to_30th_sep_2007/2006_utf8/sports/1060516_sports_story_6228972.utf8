 Shoaib needs to prove his fitness, says Bari

 Shoaib Akthar 

Karachi: PCB chairman of selectors Wasim Bari gave full marks to the attitude and approach of fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar but refused to guarantee him a place in the England-bound squad. 

We have been told that his attitude and approach is very positive. We will invite him for a fitness camp and then monitor his progress, Bari said on Monday. 

He said Shoaib was an important player but the decision to include the speedster in the squad would be taken after consulting a team of trainers. 

It is a sensitive and important decision that will be taken in consultation with the team management and the team of trainers. We have a long tour of England and we know Shoaib (Akhtar) will be an important player. 

Shoaib has been out of action since the series against India in February. 

After the Rawalpindi Express underwent arthroscopy on his knees in Australia in April, he is rehabilitating under the supervision of trainer Grant Compton. 

In the fitness camp, Shoaib will have an excellent opportunity to impress the team management. He is a senior pro, and although I havent had the chance to talk to him lately, but we have been told that he is training hard, Bari said. 

The selection committee is expected to name 25 cricketers for another fitness camp starting at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore from May 25. 

The Pakistan team will leave in late June for a three-and-a-half month tour during which they will play four Tests and five ODIs. 

Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said a fit Shoaib will boost his teams chances in England where the green caps have not lost a series in 24 years. 

We all know what Shoaib is capable of. His talent has never been questioned but its his fitness that worries us. He has recently undergone knee injury and in the fitness camp we just want to see how he has responded.

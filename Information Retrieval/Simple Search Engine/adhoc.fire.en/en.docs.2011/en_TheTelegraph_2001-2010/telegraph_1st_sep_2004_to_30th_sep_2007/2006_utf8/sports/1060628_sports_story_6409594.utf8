 Robinho eyes quarter final return

 Bergisch Gladbach: Brazil 

 striker Robinho is recovering from the right thigh injury 

 that ruled him out of Tuesdays World Cup match against 

 Ghana and should be ready for the quarter finals. 

Team doctors say Robinho will probably be better in time for the quarters next on Saturday against either Spain or France, if coach Carlos Alberto Parreira wants him to play. The 22-year-old is the joker of the Brazil squad, composing and singing songs to entertain the other players. 

Singing? No, not now, Robinho said. Thats what we do when were on the bus on our way to training. (The others) have been asking me how Im doing, saying they hope its nothing serious. 

Robinho is playing in his first World Cup and his stylish footwork on the pitch has gained him massive popularity among Brazilians, many of whom would like to see him play regularly rather than as back-up to the Magic Quartet of Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Adriano and Kaka. 

He has scored six goals in 23 matches with Brazil and led Santos to two Brazilian league titles before going to Real Madrid in 2005. Robinho said he had been in touch with his family in Brazil, who were concerned when they learned about his injury from TV. 

 I spoke with my Dad and 

 my Mom. They were a bit worried because they know its 

 rare for me to get injured, he said. I told 

 them it was nothing serious... But its normal for 

 parents to worry.

 Scolari backs off as Portugal voice anger

 - England against another foreign manager 

 David Bond

The hunt for Sven-Goran Erikssons successor took a confusing twist on Monday as the latest favourite, Luiz Felipe Scolari, distanced himself from the job amid fears of a backlash from his employers, the Portuguese Football Association. 

Despite being on the shortlist for the position, the Brazilian World Cup-winning manager denied he had even been interviewed by the FA to take over when Eriksson stands down after the World Cup in Germany. 

As bookmakers slashed the odds on Scolari landing the job ahead of Steve McClaren, murmurings of discontent began rumbling among those at the top of the English game who are opposed to another foreigner managing the national team. 

Some members of the FAs five-man nominations committee believe appointing a second successive overseas coach would send the wrong message to those English managers trying to work their way through the system, a view shared by the League Managers Association. 

And Manchester City boss Stuart Pearce, himself a contender for the job until a month ago, said he would be very surprised if Scolari got the job as he was convinced the public wanted a home-grown manager. 

In Portugal, where Scolari has been manager since leading Brazil to victory at the 2002 World Cup, there is considerable anger at the disruption the speculation over the England job is causing their preparations for the 2006 World Cup. 

Alfonso de Melho, spokesman for the Portuguese FA, said: Its always the same news. He is going to decide after the World Cup. Until the World Cup, nothing. 

Scolari echoed this: I am the Portugal coach and I am only thinking and speaking about Portugal until the last day of the World Cup. 

I dont have an interview. I spoke with the BBC, two or three months ago, and I said that I am happy that they are thinking about me. 

But I have a contract with Portugal and I dont want to talk more about any contract until the last day of my job in Portugal.

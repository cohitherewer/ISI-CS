 Right squad has been picked: Shastri

Lucknow: Former Indian captain Ravi Shastri said the selectors had picked the right squad for the Champions Trophy with performance being the only criteria. 

It all depends on performance. Undoubtedly both Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan are performing well but there are others also, he said. 

On the exclusion of Sourav Ganguly, Shastri said he will have to score runs to return to the national side. 

Sourav should improve his performance and make runs to make his way back to the team, Shastri told reporters here. 

He lauded the combination of Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid and said that after Australia, India and Pakistan were the favourites to win the World Cup.

 SA tour excites Sreesanth 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In Sreesanths own admission, its advantage Sri Lanka A, but the India pacer believes that the Eden is known for miracles and South will be banking on one such thing to tide over the crisis. 

The Sri Lankans are in pretty good position now. But you never know the unpredictability of this game and miracles do happen at the Eden, the Keralite said after Day II of the Duleep Trophy match here. 

Sreesanth who was not in the Champions Trophy XIV but made the cut in the 16-member ODI squad for the tour of South Africa also admitted that he struggled to get his rhythm going against the islanders. Im a rhythm bowler but I struggled with my line and length today. Hopefully, Ill get my rhythm back tomorrow morning, he said. 

Im going to travel to South Africa for the first time and Im pretty excited about this tour. This is why, I decided to play this match so that I can land in South Africa with a good rhythm in my bowling, he added. 

Sreesanth was also excited to make his maiden appearance at the Eden. The wicket here is a bit slow, patience is the key to success, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The South Africans underestimated India

 - A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Kepler Wessels and Neil Johnson on Indias win and whats ahead 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Johannesburg: Former South African captain Kepler Wessels spoke to The Telegraph after Indias awesome win at the Wanderers on Monday. 

The following are excerpts 

On South Africas defeat 

They underestimated India... Thought they could just turn up at the Wanderers and win... The South Africans didnt prepare! Instead of trying to maintain momentum, after winning the ODIs, the players were given a break... At this level, how do you underestimate any team? The South Africans batted and bowled poorly and, clearly, have a lot of work to do between now and the second Test (in Durban, from December 26). 

On Rahul Dravids decision to bat 

Frankly, I dont think he had a choice... History will show that if you bat first and put runs on the board, youve got a chance... With the moisture, it must have been a tough call, but I dont think Rahul had a choice. 

On what made the difference for India 

Sourav Gangulys batting in the first innings and Sreesanths bowling... One showed guts and character, the other bowled a beautiful length and swung the ball. 

On whether he wouldve dropped the out-of-form Herschelle Gibbs for the last two Tests 

Yes... Gibbs should play domestic cricket and I would take Jacques Rudolph in his place... (After a pause) The selectors ought to have taken some tough decisions, but I knew they wouldnt. 

On the Indians also struggling at the very top of the order 

(Grins) I agree, but they havent got as big a problem as South Africa... 

Finally, on whether the South Africans have the ability to make a comeback 

They can... My view is that the Durban wicket is going to be result-oriented... Being 0-1 down, South Africa wont take the conservative option... Theyre bound to have a surface with plenty of pace and bounce... The Cape Town wicket, though, will be on the slower side.

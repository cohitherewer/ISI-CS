The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India peaking at right time

 Stump View

 It was a clinical performance 

 by India as they levelled the five-match series 1-1 at Rawalpindi, 

 a venue where they won their maiden Test series over Pakistan 

 a couple of years ago.

 They out-foxed, out-thought, out-smarted 

 and eventually outclassed Pakistan in all the departments 

 of the game to indicate that they were peaking probably 

 at the right time in this one-day series ? something that 

 should be a concern for Pakistan.

 Pakistan lacked the firepower 

 in the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and their problems were 

 further compounded by four silly run-outs, but it was neither 

 Indias problem nor concern as they had a job to accomplish 

 which they did professionally, comprehensively and in style.

 Securing the first win of the 

 tour must have contributed hugely to Indias morale 

 and beating Pakistan after five straight one-day defeats, 

 should certainly have restored their confidence. But this 

 form of cricket is very cruel. The margin of error is minimum 

 and consequently you can easily transform into villains 

 from heroes in a matter of hours. So, it is better to stick 

 to the basics of the game, put in your best efforts and 

 keep the celebration party on hold. 

 India had all the reasons to be 

 delighted with the Rawalpindi game. The bowlers maintained 

 a very decent line and length, and the fielders backed them 

 whole-heartedly. Rahul Dravid was innovative and proved 

 himself as a thinking captain while making calculative bowling 

 changes and placing the fielders exactly where they should 

 have been.

 Dravid also proved me right when 

 he bowled Irfan Pathan in two spells and who later walked 

 away with the Man of the Match award.

 The best thing that happened to 

 India was a century opening stand between Virender Sehwag 

 and Sachin Tendulkar. No matter how small or big a total 

 you are chasing, you need a solid start and thats 

 exactly what the two provided. I was amazed to hear that 

 Sehwag has not scored a century in the last 60 one-dayers, 

 in which he has averaged something like 29.

 Sehwag is a player against whom 

 you cannot set a proper field. He relies heavily on his 

 eye and punches even the good balls to the boundaries without 

 much footwork. He looked in discomfort with his left shoulder 

 and I hope it is not serious because after this series, 

 India have to face England and Sehwag will certainly be 

 one of the key players.

 The Sehwag-Tendulkar pair also 

 provided Dravid the luxury of reverting to a more conventional 

 batting order and the end result was a seven-wicket victory.

 I dont think Inzamam-ul 

 Haq did anything wrong while electing to bat first except 

 that he was deceived by the look of the pitch. The decision 

 was based on the fact that the team batting first here in 

 the last two matches had won. Moreover, Pakistan had also 

 defeated India two years ago while batting first.

 But he must have been dismayed 

 with the four run-outs, specially the one involving Mohammad 

 Yousuf. I fail to understand how an experienced batsman 

 like Yousuf can be such a poor judge of run.

 Defeat sometimes helps you to 

 get back on track specially after you are enjoying such 

 a successful run of form like Pakistan since the Bangalore 

 Test. To me it was a timely wake-up call for Pakistan and 

 also a stern warning that if they dont lift their 

 standards, they are headed for big trouble.

 Even in defeat, the plus was the 

 batting of Shoaib Malik who reached 90s for the second successive 

 time and Younis Khan, who, batting at No. 6, chipped in 

 with 81 while adding 102 for the fifth wicket with Malik. 

 To me, the turning point of the match was when Malik was 

 run out with the score at 170. Had he batted a few more 

 overs, Abdul Razzaq and Shahid Afridi could have exploited 

 the situation better.

 Shoaibs return to the fold 

 is essential because it not only provides the comfort cushion 

 to the other Pakistan bowlers, it also restricts and curbs 

 the opponent batsmens carefree approach. 

 The Lahore one-dayer will be the 

 first game that will finish under lights. The outfield will 

 be fast and the wicket will once again be something like 

 the one we had for the first Test in which little under 

 1,100 runs were scored at the cost of eight wickets.

 However, after analysing the strengths 

 of the two teams, I think the captain winning the toss would 

 prefer to chase the target.

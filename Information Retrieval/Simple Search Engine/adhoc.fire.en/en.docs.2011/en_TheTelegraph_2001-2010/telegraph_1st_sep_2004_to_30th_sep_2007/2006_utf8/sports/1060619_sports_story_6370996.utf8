 WFI set to be banned for 1 yr

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) is set to ban Weightlifting Federation of India (WFI) for one year and impose a fine of $50,000 for four of their lifters testing positive in international competitions this year. The WFI was banned provisionally for three months immediately after the Commonwealth Games. 

Though an official communique is yet to reach the Indian federation, WFI secretary Balbir Singh Bhatia said he has been unofficially informed about the ban. I believe India will either be banned for one year with a fine of $50,000 or banned for two years without the fine, Bhatia told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

With four Indian lifters testing positive during a WADA test and the Commonwealth Games, the Indian federation, under the rules, was expected to be suspended for two or three years. 

But the IWF is believed to have taken a lenient view of the situation and decided to let India off with the one-year ban. The ban period, however, would be doubled if India fail to pay the fine.

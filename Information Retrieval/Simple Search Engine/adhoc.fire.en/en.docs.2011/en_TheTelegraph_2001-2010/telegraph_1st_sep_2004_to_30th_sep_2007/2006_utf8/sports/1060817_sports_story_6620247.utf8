Cincinnati: The Indo-Czech pair of Leander Paes and Martin Damm reached the quarter finals of the Cincinnati Masters on Tuesday.

Mahesh Bhupathi and his American partner Justin Gimelstob survived a scare to advance to the second round . 

The Indo-US pair prevailed over the Czech pair of Tomas Berdych and Jaroslav Levinsky 7-5, 4-6, 11-9. 

They now face sixth seed Israeli duo of Jonathan Eerlich and Andy Ram, who we re given a bye in the first round. 

 Meanwhile, Roger Federer was twice made to come from behind for his 55th consecutive win on North American hardcourts when overcoming Thailands Paradorn Srichaphan 7-5, 6-4. 

The Swiss world No. 1 maintained the torrid pace which lifted him to his seventh trophy of the season at the weekend when he beat Richard Gasquet in Toronto. 

Gasquet could not maintain his form, however, and went down in the first-round 7-5, 7-5 to Spaniard Tommy Robredo. 

Federer handed Srichaphan a 15th first-round defeat this season after trailing a break in both sets, but the Swiss was able to storm back to earn a third victory over Asias top player. 

It was an extra tough match, he was playing well from the start, Federer said. But I got into the match and was able to win it. 

Second seed Rafael Nadal overcame 10 aces from American Sam Querrey before defeating the teenager 6-7, 6-2, 6-3. 

Querrey is ranked 178th in the world and Nadal prevailed over him in just over two hours. 

Fourth seed Ivan Ljubicic dismissed Greg Rusedski 6-3, 6-4. Andy Murray defeated Tim Henman in the second battle of Britain in as many weeks, earning a 4-6, 6-4, 7-5 victory to book a place against Federer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Okoros message for De Ridder

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The stage was set. The name of the opponents coach was Philippe de Ridder. It was reason enough for Mike Okoro to be fired up. He scored a brace against Chirag United and declared that he had proved a point. To himself, to his fans and most importantly, to the Belgian, the man with whom the Nigerian got involved in a battle of egos last season at East Bengal. 

This is my message to De Ridder. I am still alive,Okoro thundered after Thursdays match. 

The Nigerian, who considers Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick as more of a father figure, saluted him promptly after scoring his second goal. 

I am still not finished, Okoro said. In fact, with four goals in three matches, I am better now than last season. I have just proved that. 

According to Bhowmick, he had given no special instructions to Okoro. 

I told him he would be marked heavily and advised him to come down and switch flanks. He is a professional and knows his job, said Bhowmick. 

On Okoros salute, the coach said, he was probably returning my salute which I did to him in the match against Eastern Railway.

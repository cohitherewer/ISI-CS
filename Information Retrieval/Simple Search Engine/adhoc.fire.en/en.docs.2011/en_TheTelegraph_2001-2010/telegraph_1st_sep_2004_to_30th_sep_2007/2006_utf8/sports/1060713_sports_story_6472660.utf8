 West Indies selector quits

St Johns: West Indies convenor of selectors Joey Carew said on Wednesday that he wont stand for re-election for the upcoming two-year term. 

Carew had been nominated by the Trinidad amp; Tobago Cricket Board, but has sent a letter to TTCB president Deryck Murray asking not to be considered when the selectors for the next period are chosen at a special meeting in Barbados on Thursday. 

A series of recent disagreements with West Indies captain Brian Lara may have played a part in his decision. Lara had repeatedly asked for different bowlers to be added to squad versus India recently.

Johannesburg: Michael Hussey, with 73, came to Australias rescue after South African pacer Makhaya Ntini ripped through the top order on the second day of the third and final Test on Saturday. 

Australia were 246 for seven in reply to South Africas first innings of 303 when bad light ended play 14.4 overs early. 

Ntini reduced Australia to 89 for four on his way to a haul of five for 80. Brett Lee was unbeaten on 42 at the close with Michael Kasprowicz who was yet to open his account. 

Ntini hit Justin Langer, playing his 100th Test, on the helmet with the first ball of the Australian innings and the left-hander retired hurt. 

Langer was diagnosed with concussion, received two stitches to the back of his head, and was taken to hospital for precautionary scans. 

Ntinis short delivery rose off the pitch to hit the left-handed Langer behind his right ear, causing significant concussion. 

Langer received treatment on the field before retiring hurt. 

It appears that Justin sustained significant concussion, Australian media manager Philip Pope quoted team physiotherapist Alex Kountouri as saying. There was also a cut in the back of his head, and he received two stitches. He was seen by the ground doctor and he has gone to hospital for precautionary scans which is the norm in this situation. 

Pope said Langer was able to walk from the dressing room to the ambulance that took him to hospital. 

Australian team medical staff will continue to monitor his condition, Pope quoted Kountouri as saying.

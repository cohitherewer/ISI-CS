The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Irfan Pathan likely to sit out first Test

 - South Africans to have all-pace attack 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Irfan Pathan 

 Johannesburg: Its 

 not confirmed, but its unlikely that Irfan Pathan 

 will make the Team India XI when the first Test gets underway 

 at the Wanderers on Friday. 

 Pathan, it may be recalled, was MoM in the only first-class 

 game leading up to the three-Test series, against Rest of 

 South Africa in Potchefstroom. In fact, he top scored in 

 both innings an unbeaten 111 and 40 not out, but has been 

 selected as a mediumpacer. 

His top job, therefore, is to get wickets. 

 With the selection committee 

 chairman (Dilip Vengsarkar) announcing that the opening 

 combination wont be disturbed, its almost impossible 

 for Pathan to make the line-up. Among new ball bowlers, 

 after all, the others are ahead of him, a well-placed 

 source told The Telegraph. 

 Speaking on Wednesday evening, he added: However, 

 a dramatic change in the line of thinking cant be 

 ruled out... 

Indications are that Zaheer Khan, Sreesanth and Vikram Rajvir Singh are to spearhead the attack with Anil Kumble being the sole specialist spinner. The top seven, as of now, are going to be: Virender Sehwag, Wasim Jaffer, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, V.V.S. Laxman and Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Meanwhile, the South Africans have released Paul Adams and Jacques Rudolph for provincial cricket and, so, they will pick from XII. Coach Mickey Arthur has, predictably, promised an all-pace attack. 

Makhaya Ntini, the lethal Dale Steyn, Andre Nel, Shaun Pollock and Jacques Kallis are the ones intending to hurl missiles. If needed, captain Graeme Smith can turn his arm over for variety. 

We want to continue with the pattern that developed in the ODIs into the Tests, Arthur remarked. The South Africans won 4-0. 

 Footnote: Nicky Boje, it appears, quit after being 

 angered by a comment from chief selector Haroon Lorgat. 

 The latter was quoted as saying South Africa needed to develop 

 or find world class spinners to take wickets. Adams 

 recall didnt please Boje (described by Arthur as a 

 great servant of South African cricket) either.

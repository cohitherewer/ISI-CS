 Zico taking India seriously

 Zico says Japan are improving with every game 

Tokyo: Holders Japan begin their 2007 Asian Cup qualifying campaign with a home tie against India on Wednesday, looking to build momentum before the World Cup. 

The Asian champions are expected to cruise to victory in Yokohama and the opening goal would be their 100th since Brazilian Zico became Japan coach in July 2002. 

Japan were beaten 2-3 by the United States in their first match of the year earlier this month but returned home to beat Finland 2-0 at the weekend with a much-improved performance. 

We still have areas of concern but were improving with every game which is important in a World Cup year, Zico told newsmen. Ill be making a few changes, but we will still be taking this game seriously. 

Zico will again be without his Europe-based contingent, including Boltons Hidetoshi Nakata and Shunsuke Nakamura of Celtic. 

However, the successful return of Tatsuhiko Kubo after a lengthy injury lay-off has given Japan a major lift as they look to strengthen an unreliable attack.

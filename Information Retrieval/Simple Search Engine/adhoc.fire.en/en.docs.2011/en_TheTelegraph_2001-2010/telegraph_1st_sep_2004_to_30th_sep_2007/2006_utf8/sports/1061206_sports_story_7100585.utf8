 Shoaib: The ban was unbearable

Rawalpindi: Shoaib Akhtar was overjoyed after being cleared of the doping charge on Tuesday. 

I am overjoyed by what happened today. It is hard to describe how relieved I really am, said Shoaib. The ban was like a life sentence for me and unbearable. I was innocent. 

Shoaib, along with Mohammed Asif, had pleaded innocent to the charge of taking banned substances intentionally to enhance their performances and recover from injuries. 

I am grateful to everyone who has supported me and Asif through this terrible ordeal. I am also happy the cricket board gave me a chance to fight the ban, he added. 

Shoaib said he had spent sleepless nights after being accused of the doping offence. But now it is over and I want to get back on track again and play for Pakistan because I missed playing for my country which is a great honour. (Agencies)

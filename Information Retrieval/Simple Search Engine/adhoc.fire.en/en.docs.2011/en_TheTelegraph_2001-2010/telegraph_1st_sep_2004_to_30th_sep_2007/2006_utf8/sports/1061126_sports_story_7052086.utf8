Mumbai: The performance-related match fee structure for Indian players that is being mooted by the BCCI would be based on overall performance of the team and not on individual displays, a BCCI official said on Saturday. 

The proposal is to take into consideration the performance of the team as a whole and not individuals for players match fees, BCCI chief administrative officer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty said.

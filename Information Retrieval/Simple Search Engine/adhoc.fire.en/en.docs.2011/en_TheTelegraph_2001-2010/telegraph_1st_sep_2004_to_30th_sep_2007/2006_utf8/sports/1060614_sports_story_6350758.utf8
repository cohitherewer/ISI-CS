The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Zaheer back as manager

 - Pakistans tour of England 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former Pakistan captain Zaheer Abbas has again been appointed manager, this time for the two-and-half month tour of England, beginning in less than a fortnight. 

Zaheer held that position during the successful tour of Sri Lanka, earlier this year, but was replaced by top Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Saleem Altaf during the two-match Friendship Cup in Abu Dhabi. 

He did travel to the UAE capital as part of the PCB delegation, though. 

Weve given the managers responsibility back to Zaheer? Among other things, his experience of conditions in England is bound to be useful for our boys, a well-placed source told The Telegraph. 

However, speaking from Lahore (on Tuesday), he couldnt confirm whether Zaheer would be given a longer tenure. 

Right now, the PCB isnt looking beyond series-by-series appointments? At the same time, one cant rule out something different, the well-placed source said. 

With Zaheer back, Inzamam-ul Haq and Bob Woolmer will have two former captains (the other being bowling coach Waqar Younis) on the management staff. 

Waqar, too, is more than just familiar with conditions in England. And, if he had a terrific association with Surrey, Zaheer had an outstanding one with Gloucestershire. 

Additionally, both are fluent in English. Thats certain to please Woolmer, as he can again take their help in communicating better with the squad. 

The management staff also includes an operations manager: PCB general manager (logistics) Asad Mustafa has been given that post. 

Pakistans itinerary, by the way, includes a first-class fixture against Northamptonshire ? a County Sourav Ganguly is going to join in a few days.

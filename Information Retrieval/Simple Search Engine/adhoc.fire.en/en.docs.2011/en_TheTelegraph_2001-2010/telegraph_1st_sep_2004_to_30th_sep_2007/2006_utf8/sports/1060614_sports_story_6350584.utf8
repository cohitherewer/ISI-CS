The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fernandes, Rodrigues may be suspended

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Like Rahim Nabi and Suresh, two top Goan footballers ?? Mickky Fernandes and Nicholas Rodrigues ?? may find themselves in trouble for allegedly signing for two different clubs. Under AIFF rules, the erring players could be suspended for the entire season with heavy fines imposed on them. 

Mickky Fernandes, who has signed on the dotted lines of the inter-state transfer forms for Mohun Bagan, has a two-year contract with Salgaocar Club, according to sources in the Goan outfit. Nicholas Rodrigues has signed up for Mahindra United for a hefty sum, but Sporting Clube de Goa officials claimed that the midfielder has a contract with them till 2007. 

Both the Goan clubs said that they would not let these two players go off to other new teams easily and take the matter to the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Players Status Committee. 

Mickky Fernandes, meanwhile, said he has not signed any paper in favour of Mohun Bagan yet. Salgaocar coach Savio Medeira said: There is no question of releasing Mickky. He has a two-year contract. 

Sporting Clube president Peter Vaz blamed Mahindra United for the entire problem. Mahindra have played dirty by approaching Nicholas despite being made aware that he had a valid contract with us. The AIFF should punish the club, not player.

 Delhi in final after 58 years

Jalandhar: Delhi are in the final of the National Hockey Championship after a gap of 58 years with an impressive 2-1 victory over Namdhari XI on Thursday. 

Delhi, who made the semi-finals for the first time since 1977 and have made the final after 1948, will lock horns with defending champions Punjab and Sindh Bank (PSB). PSB edged out Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) 1-0, the goal coming from Tassavarjit Singh via a penalty corner conversion in injury time. 

Eariler, Pramod Kumar gave Delhi the lead in the 12th minute of a fast-paced match when he received a pass from captain Bikash Toppo on the left flank before slotting home. 

The lead was doubled three minutes later with Prem Kumar converting an excellent pass from Jitender Sharoa. Gurcharan Singh pulled one back for Namdhari XI in the 60th minute, but they failed to find an equaliser despite putting Delhi under pressure. 

Namdhari XI had only themselves to blame as they failed to capitalise on the several penalty corners they earned. They were more aggressive in the second half and conducted several raids on their opponents, but could find the target only once. 

IOC missed out on two penalty corners earned in the 18th and 37th minutes. PSB were no better as they also failed to covert a penalty corner in the 23rd. The first half ended goalless. (PTI)

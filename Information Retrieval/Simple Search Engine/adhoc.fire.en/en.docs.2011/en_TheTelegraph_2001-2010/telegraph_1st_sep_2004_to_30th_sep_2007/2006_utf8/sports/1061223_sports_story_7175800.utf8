The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A masseur with a difference

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Durban: The other day, coach Greg Chappell described masseur Ramesh Mane as an important member of the Team India support staff. Clearly, hes actually quite different from the run-of-the-mill ones. 

The other day, for example, one found him buying books including Soul Mind Body Medicine, specific to the soul healing system by best-selling author Dr Zhi Gang Sha. Im interested in such books, Mane, who has been with the boys from the tour of Pakistan, remarked. 

Biomechanist Ian Frazer, also labelled as an important member by Chappell, told The Telegraph: I agree with Greg... Mane plays a big role... As for the books, he keeps passing them around... He wants the boys to stay fit both physically and in the mind... 

Mane, then, is one of the unsung heroes.

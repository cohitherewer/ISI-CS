Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting delayed what their coach Subhas Bhowmick termed as inevitable when they held East Bengal goalless at the Barasat stadium on Saturday. 

While Mohammedan Sporting finished the Sahara CFL Premier Division in third place with 24 points, East Bengal (29) need to beat Eastern Railway to be certain of claiming the title three days from now. Mohun Bagan (27) will pip them to the crown if they win their final game versus United SC and, also, East Bengal lose theirs. 

East Bengal (19-5) have a better goal-difference than their rivals (18-8). So the red-and-golds will be through even if they draw, provided Mohun Bagan dont win by a five-goal margin. 

But in all fairness, away from these statistical checks, football on Saturday became both weird and wonderful. Both teams played a pretty open match, spurned countless chances with maddening regularity and just when it seemed the game was taking an entertaining height, it descended into the ugly. 

In the 69th minute, East Bengals Brazilian forward Marcio challenged Jamir Ali Mondal to draw a booking from referee Minangshu Bhattacharjee. Things took a nasty turn thereafter as players from both teams got engaged in an altercation. A free-for-all ensued with Dipankar Roy and A. Firoz getting into the act before the match officials. Mohammedan Sporting custodian Gopal Das rushed from his position to join the scuffle. 

Worse, Bhowmick was struck by a cracker and he quickly gestured his bench to leave the ground. The situation was brought under control as organisers stepped in quickly. The referee, five minutes later, signalled re-start. Amazingly, no player was booked for the scuffle! 

The beginning of the match was a different story altogether. If Surojit Roy, fed by MoM Habibur Rahman Mondal, missed the target from close, Marcio attempted to pull the trigger twice before the break, but each time, the chamber was found to be empty.

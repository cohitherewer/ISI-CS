The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 200-crore suit against PCA

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mohali: The Punjab Sports Council (PSC) has moved the Mohali sub-divisional magistrate against the Punjab Cricket Association (PCA) for possessing 15.35 acres of land it had taken over in 1992 in violation of rules. The land in question is the one where the PCA Stadium is located. 

Besides getting back government land, the PSC also sought recovery of Rs 150 crore which the PCA has earned by profit from the land and Rs 50 crore as damages and compensation. 

We filed the case after our notice to PCA in June evoked no response, Punjab sports director Pargat Singh told The Telegraph. 

PCA president I.S. Bindra declined to comment. We will give a reply in court only, he said. 

The PCA has been given time till November 15 to reply to the notice.

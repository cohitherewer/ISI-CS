Kuala Lumpur: Australia served a timely warning to Champions Trophy contenders by clinching the tri-series with a crushing 127-run victory against the West Indies in the final on Sunday. 

The Aussies, who fielded their best XI, put up a commanding allround performance on the big day by posting a challenging 240 for six and then skittling out Brian Lara amp; Co. for a paltry 113 in the day-night clash at the Kinrara Oval. 

After Damien Martyn and Andrew Symonds set the stage for three-time world champions with timely half-centuries, Brett Lee turned in a powerful fast bowling performance of four for 24 to blow away the West Indies line-up. It made Lee the most successful bowler of the series with 11 wickets. Lee was adjudged both Man-of-the-Match as well as Man-of-the-Series. 

Nathan bracken was equally impressive with figures of three for 15 while allrounder Shane Watson chipped in with 2-30. 

The Windies, holders of the Champions Trophy, suffered their fourth successive batting failure, triggered by the leg before dismissal of Chris Gayle to a toe-crusher from Lee off the first ball of the innings. 

Only three batsmen Ramnaresh Sarwan (36), Dwayne Smith (30) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (12) made double digit scores while four were out for nought. 

It was the third lowest total and the margin of win was the second highest in terms of runs in matches between the two teams. 

 The dismissal of captain Lara with a controversial umpiring decision and a record-breaking duck by No. 3 Runako Morton exacerbated the loss for the West Indies, who defied their critics to qualify for the final of the tournament with wins over Australia and India in the qualifying matches. 

A late burst of defiance by Sarwan and Smith, who shared a 50-run partnership for the seventh wicket, failed to prevent the inevitable. 

Morton, promoted up the order, batted with opener Chanderpaul for 31 balls before dismissed without scoring, a world record duck. The previous worst performance was by compatriot Phil Simmons, who had survived 23 balls for his duck against New Zealand in 1994. 

Mortons slow progress rivalled Australian opener Simon Katich, who plodded through 66 balls for his 25 on Sunday.

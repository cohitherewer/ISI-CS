Singapore: Jyoti Randhawa carded a three-under 68 to finish Day I of the $3 million Barclays Singapore Open in sole third place on Thursday, putting himself in excellent position of winning the Asian major. 

Randhawa was a shot behind joint leaders Scott Strange and young Filipino Juvic Pagunsan. Shiv Kapur was tied ninth with a one-under 70, which could have been better but for a finishing bogey. 

Jeev Milkha Singh (tied 18th with a par 71), SSP Chowrasia (tied 32nd with a one-over 72), Gurbaaz Mann and Harmeet Kahlon (both tied 47th with a two-over 73) were the other Indians to do well on a tough day. 

Arjun Singh and Gaurav Ghei were tied 64th after carding a 74, while Amandeep Johl, Rahil Gangjee, Digvijay Singh and Uttam Singh Mundy were tied 109th on 77. 

Strange and Pagunsan outgunned shot four-under-par 67s, while three-time major winner Ernie Els could only manage an even-par. Defending champion Adam Scott of Australia was three shots off the pace with a one-under 70.

 Sachin wants to see 96 tapes vs England

New Delhi: Sachin Tendulkar has requested a television channel to send him video recordings of his performances against England in the 1996 season. Sachin had aggregated 428 runs at an average of 85.6 and hit two centuries in three Tests. 

Sunil Gavaskar felt Sachin could be looking to himself for some batting tips as he was a better player then (in 1996). Maybe he wants to see the position of his body and head when playing, the initial movement, Gavaskar said in a programme.

 Teams forced to change plans: Arthur

Jaipur: South Africa would rely on their ability to adapt and improvise according to the demands of the situation and the playing conditions when they take on the West Indies in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final here on Thursday. 

Coach Mickey Arthur said the team had been able to improve as the tournament progressed only because they realised that their preconceived strategies would not work on the kind of wickets that have been prepared for the tournament. 

We have improved gradually. I think like most teams we came here with a preconceived gameplan and a perception of the wickets that we were going to play on, he said. 

It certainly took our first game at the Brabourne (in Mumbai against New Zealand), and obviously watching all the other games, to realise it wasnt the normal subcontinent conditions, and wickets could suit bowlers. We had to change our gameplan accordingly. 

The coach said the players had gained confidence along the way and were expecting another good show in the semi-finals. (PTI)

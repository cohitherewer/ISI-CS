The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India will come hard at us, says Sajid

 Sajid 

Jaipur: Riding high on confidence, England do not think the absence of Sachin Tendulkar would have any bearing on their prospects in the seven-match one-day series beginning next week. 

Twenty five-year-old pacer Sajid Mahmood Friday said England expected the hosts to come hard at them in the one-dayers, especially after their reversal in the third Test. 

We would take the practice match seriously as it is the only opportunity for us before the series kicks off on Tuesday. We would like to carry our winning momentum into the ODIs, Sajid told reporters here ahead of the warm-up game against RCA Presidents XI here Saturday. 

Asked whether the absence of Sachin would have a bearing on the series, Sajid said, I dont think so. Anybody who takes place of Sachin should be more or less as good as him because all those who play for India are obviously good enough. (PTI)

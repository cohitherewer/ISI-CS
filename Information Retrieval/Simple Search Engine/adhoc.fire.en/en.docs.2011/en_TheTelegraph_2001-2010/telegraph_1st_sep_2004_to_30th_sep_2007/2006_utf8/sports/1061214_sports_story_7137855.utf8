 PCB chief denies charge

 - DECISION TO LIFT BAN 

Lahore: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Dr Nasim Ashraf said the board did not influence an appeals committee to lift the doping bans on fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif last week. I swear to God that we did not have any wrong intentions, the PCB chairman said on Wednesday. 

A PCB doping tribunal, last month, banned Akhtar for two years and Asif for one year after both tested positive for banned steroid nandrolone a decision reversed by the PCB appeals committee. 

The board had adopted a transparent way and carried out the tests in a transparent manner, Ashraf said. 

PCB rules applied to whatever were the results (of the tests), he said. If this had happened in any other country, that countrys rules would have applied. 

The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) last week expressed reservations over the decision to drop the bans. 

Ashraf maintained it was purely under the PCBs jurisdiction. The matter is over. Its Pakistans internal matter, Ashraf insisted. 

He, however, lost patience when asked why there was so much difference in the findings of the two tribunals. 

If you have feelings like this then keep on carrying it, I dont have any answer to this, he said angrily. (AP)

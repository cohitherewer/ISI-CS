 Lara slightly ahead of Sachin

 - McGrath on his toughest opponent 

 Lara

Melbourne: Glenn McGrath on Saturday named West Indies batting icon Brian Lara as the best batsman he ever bowled to in his international career, just slightly ahead of Sachin Tendulkar. 

Asked to pick the toughest opponent in his 13-year-old career, McGrath picked Lara ahead of Tendulkar and said he was always driven to give his best when bowling against those two. 

To me it was always about how you went against the guys who were classed the best in the world, McGrath said here on Saturday after announcing he would quit international cricket after the 2007 World Cup. 

I feel, personally, that on his day Lara was probably the guy who was the standout, just slightly ahead of Sachin. 

Interestingly, McGrath has dismissed Lara 15 times in Tests, just four less than his biggest bunny Michael Atherton whom he claimed 19 times. He dismissed Tendulkar six times. 

The most successful fast bowler in Tests with 555 wickets, McGrath said his mental strength was his greatest asset. 

 Sachin

I feel what I actually did with the ball and the skill level theres a lot of other guys out there who had more skills to swing the ball, do well with the ball. 

My strengths were my accuracy, hitting that same spot, the bounce Id get and the mental side of the game. 

McGrath said there were too many career highlights to single out, but did mention a few of his individual milestones. 

Obviously playing your first Test (against New Zealand in Perth in 1993), the first Test wicket seeing Mark Greatbatch nick the ball through to Ian Healy. 

The first five-wicket haul in Test, which was in Barbados, to take that first five-for really gives you that self-belief. 

And then to play at Lords is an amazing thing in itself. Eight for 38 (in my) first game there is something Ill always remember and I couldnt go past my 61 in Brisbane and the catch (to dismiss Michael Vaughan) in Adelaide.

London: Robbie Fowler netted his first goal since returning to his hometown club in January as Liverpool finally found their scoring boots in a 5-1 demolition of Fulham in the Premier League on Wednesday. 

Fowler had been out of luck since moving from Manchester City on a six-month contract but his 16th-minute goal set Liverpool on their way to a comprehensive win that closed the gap on second-placed Manchester United to two points. 

Liverpool, in third, have 58 points from 30 games, with United, who have played 28, on 60 and leaders Chelsea on 75. 

Fowlers close-range finish after Luis Garcia had flicked on a corner was only the second goal by Liverpools four strikers this year. His teammates took their cue to inflict more misery on a Fulham side yet to win on their travels this season. 

Fulhams Collins John has briefly restored parity after Fowlers goal when the Dutch striker scored following a swift break, but Liverpool were ahead again 11 minutes before halftime through Michael Browns own goal. 

Spaniard Fernando Morientes made it 3-1 20 minutes from time and late goals from Peter Crouch and Stephen Warnock completed the rout. 

Meanwhile, Marlon Harewoods extra time goal sent West Ham United into the FA Cup quarter finals on Wednesday after a 2-1 win over Bolton Wanderers in their fifth round replay at Upton Park. 

Harewood flicked in Yossi Benayouns cross five minutes into the first extra period to book the east London side a visit to Premier League rivals Manchester City in the last eight. 

Espanyol will play Real Zaragoza in the Kings Cup final next month after a goalless draw at Deportivo Coruna on Wednesday took them through 2-1 on aggregate. 

The three-time Cup winners, who last lifted the trophy in 2000, sat back and frustrated Deportivo in the Riazor and were rarely troubled despite the home side dominating possession.

 ...Targets government, SAI

 Shooting star hints at retirement 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: After Rajyavardhan Rathore, it was the turn of Jaspal Rana to shoot from his mouth after winning a medal at the Lusail Shooting range here. While Rathore lambasted the local organisers, Rana made the Indian government and SAI his main target. 

So upset is Rana with their attitude that he even hinted of calling it a day as soon as possible. I am not going to shoot for long, he said. 

I am tired of fighting the government and the SAI, he said. People sitting there know nothing of shooting, yet make decisions about the game. I am the only one who always fights with them 

Ranas biggest complaint is that he never receives the correct ammunition from SAI for practice. Here in Doha I have come only after a 10-day practice session. For the past two years, I have not been getting ammunition. There are so many rules and regulations to get ammunition that I feel frustrated. For the Asian Games here, I mostly practised with borrowed ammunition, yet hit the gold. 

What has antagonised Rana most was the decision of the government to terminate the contract with his Hungarian coach Tibor Gonezol in 2002. He is a great coach. Whatever I am today is because of him. The government didnt extend his contract because he was over 60 years. That was simply a stupid decision. 

After retirement, Rana said, he would concentrate totally on his academy which he has recently set up on Uttaranchal. I dont want my wards to be denied of what I didnt get in my life, he said.

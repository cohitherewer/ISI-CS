 Inexperience letting us down

 Guest Column

I am sure that it seems strange to many people that this England side have been able to win six out of their last eight Test series, including the famous Ashes victory, draw in the most inhospitable conditions of India, yet have struggled to come to terms with the shortened form of the game, especially away from home. 

 We must reflect on a series defeat to an Indian side full of confidence, and find ways to improve our performances, both in the remaining matches on this tour, and in the next 12 months leading up to the World Cup. 

Despite Australia managing to dominate both forms of the game for much of the last decade, the differences between Test cricket and ODIs could not be more stark. Understanding the different requirements of the two games will certainly help us to improve our weaknesses in the future. 

For a bowler, Test cricket is about getting wickets. With 20 wickets to get in order to win a game, it is the bowlers who will win Test matches. The pressure is on them to find ways of getting players out. They will be helped if they have the ability to bowl at searing pace, swing the ball, or turn it prodigiously. 

The batsman, on the other hand, has the job of preventing the bowlers from taking those 20 wickets. He does this by having a sound defensive technique, by looking to score off loose deliveries, and making sure there are as few flaws as possible for the bowlers to exploit. 

Although Test cricket has become much more positive in recent times, it is only because batsmen see attack as an important form of defence. 

In one-day cricket, all the roles are reversed. The batsmen are there to win or lose the game. Bowlers to frustrate, build pressure and keep run scoring to a minimum, but the batsmen are the key players. 

As a result they have to be able to score off just about any delivery, judge when to risk their wicket in search of a boundary, and be adaptable enough to play in a number of different ways depending on the conditions. 

Pressure brings wickets, and good one-day bowlers build pressure. In international cricket, the best one-day bowlers are generally those that go for the least runs per over. 

Bowlers like McGrath, Pollock, Muralidharan, and Flintoff go for around four runs per over. Because they are able to do that, they also pick up wickets. 

In Test cricket the pace is far more sedate, and the decision-making can be done at a more leisurely rate. 

Despite the furious pace of ODI cricket, the best teams usually have some sort of plan about how to win the game. 

The best sides also seem to have a number of match-winners. These are players who are able to change the course of the match with their own contribution. Batsmen like Pietersen, Flintoff and Gilchrist are good examples. They can increase the tempo of the innings to such an extent that it takes the game away from the opposition. 

Despite not having the best of ODI series down in India, the England team has many of the requirements to be a top one-day side. We have match-winners in Pietersen and Flintoff, we have players capable of batting through the innings, and we have bowlers who are able to build pressure. Where we cannot match other teams at this stage is in terms of experience. 

Trescothick and Flintoff have played 100 ODIs, but overall our team in the last game in Kochi had an average of 43 caps . The Indian teams average is 88, and their side is meant to be young and inexperienced!

 Annika breaks course record

 Scandinavian Golf

 Stockholm: Annika Sorenstam 

 shot a bogey-free seven-under 66 on Thursday at the TPC 

 of Scandinavia, breaking the record on her home course to 

 take the first-round lead.

 The Swede, who grew up near the 

 Bro-Balsta course, had five birdies and one eagle, which 

 came on the long par-five sixth hole, where she hit a four-wood 

 to within 12 meters and holed a snaking uphill putt.

 Its probably my best 

 round in quite a while, said Sorenstam, who is the 

 official hostess of the tournament. I hit all 18 greens, 

 putted well and I was never in a bunker.

 I know the golf course well 

 and I would like to think it knows I have come home and 

 its going to give me some good breaks.

 Sorenstam started playing on the 

 course when she was 12 years old with her younger sister 

 Charlotta, who also is an LPGA Tour regular. Their parents 

 still live nearby. (AP)

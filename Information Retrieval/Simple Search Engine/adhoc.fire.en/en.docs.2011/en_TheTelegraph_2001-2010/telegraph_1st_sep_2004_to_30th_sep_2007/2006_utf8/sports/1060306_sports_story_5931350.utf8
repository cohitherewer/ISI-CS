 Mystical wins in tight finish 

 SRIMAX

 Ganapathy

Bangalore: S Ganapathy-trained Mystical won the Indian Turf Invitation Cup here on Sunday and proved he was the best four- year-old in the country. His victory, however, came the hard way. The Alnasr Alwasheek- Mystic Memory son had to sweat it out to beat stablemate, Flashing Star, who took the battle to the wire.

 The pace in the race was fast, set by Democraticus, but fancied runners Mystical and Holding Court always travelled close behind the leader in third and fourth berths, respectively.

 The race took a serious turn when the field entered the home turn. Holding Court was quick to hit the front at the top of the turn, prompting Flashing Star to make a challenging move on the wide out. 

 But Prakash, who had got himself in a traffic problem in the Indian Derby, was careful and kept the 5-4 favourite moving forward. 

 When Flashing Star passed Holding Court, in the last furlong, Mystical joined the issue. However, the unexpected happened in the final 150m when Prakash lost his whip. Yet he did not lose heart and kept the favourite driving hands and heels to take the fight to the wire where the Mystical got up just in time to have the measure of Flashing Star.

Flashing Star lost the race but he was not disgraced. Holding Courts jockey, Naill McCullagh, too, reported the loss of the whip before the distance post but the S. Padmanabhan-trainee could not have turned the table on his conquerors. He was a beaten horse even before the race took a serious turn and his jockey McCullaghs strategy of hitting the front at the top of the turn may have done the damage to Holding Courts cause. He was a well beaten third and only about two lengths ahead of the fourth placed Refreshing.

 There was another interesting duel between Amazing Power and Southern Regent in the Maj. P K Mehra Memorial Super Mile ? also a Grade I race for horses four years old and over. The fancied Southern Regent travelled fifth or sixth with Amazing Power tracking him all the way. Inside the final 300m, even as Southern Regent hit the front, Amazing Power, ridden by Naill McCullagh, came up with giant strides and the two horses fought out till the finish. McCullaghs Power was, however, able to get better of Southern Regent by a whisker at the finish. The Sprinters Cup winner, Spectacular Quest, was a good third.

 Bhowmick: Im not a worried man 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: On Monday, Bhaichung Bhutia described Mohun Bagans 0-1 defeat to Calcutta Port Trust as a wake-up call for his team. However, his former coach who is now in Mohammedan Sportings hot seat, Subhas Bhowmick, doesnt want to press the panic button following his sides lacklustre goalless draw with Railway FC on Tuesday. 

Im not concerned with this result. One must understand that in a marathon league, Mohun Bagan losing to Port Trust and Mohammedan Sporting drawing with Railway FC are nothing but normal things Im not a worried man at all, Bhowmick said after his first match as Mohammedan Sporting coach. 

He, however, admitted that missing out on full points was disappointing. 

We squandered quite a number of chances, particularly in the second-half. Bijen and Nazim missed the target from close, Douglas (da Silva) struck the post. Their goalkeeper also came up with some fine saves. 

I can take both positives and negatives from this match. Of course, we need to raise our momentum in attack. The midfield hasnt functioned well today and so, this problem needs to be sorted out. This is a young, promising side Jamir Ali Mondal and Mohammed Nizams play surprised me and their performance is surely a positive aspect for me, Bhowmick said. 

He, however, described Douglas who returned to the Maidan after almost one-and-a-half-years as injury free, but one who needs time to get to his peak. 

According to Railway FC coach Sanjay Sen, however, Mohammedan Sporting looked pretty ordinary. 

We wanted to get one point and we were successful in achieving our target, he said.

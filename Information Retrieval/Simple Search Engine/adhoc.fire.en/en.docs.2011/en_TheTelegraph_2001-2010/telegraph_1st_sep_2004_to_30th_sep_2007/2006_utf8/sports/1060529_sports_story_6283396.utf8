Port-of-Spain: Dwayne Bravo once again tormented the Indians as his brilliant pyrotechnics helped the West Indies finish with an impressive 255 for six in the fifth and final one-day International here on Sunday. 

 India were 53 for two after 11 overs with Rahul Dravid 

 (16) and Virender Sehwag (17) at the crease. Robin Uthappa 

 (0) and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (14) were dismissed. Wavell 

 Hinds claimed both wickets. 

Bravo stroked his second successive half-century of the series, an unbeaten 62 off only 36 balls, to help the hosts overcome a middle overs slump at the Queens Park Oval. 

The young allrounder put on 80 runs for the fifth wicket with Wavell Hinds (32) as the Caribbeans collected 90 runs in the final 10 overs. 

Earlier, opener Chris Gayle (51 off 61) had provided the early fireworks and put on 82 runs for the second wicket with consistent Ramnaresh Sarwan (52) before the hosts slumped. Bravo peppered the off-side with boundaries in the extra cover region and his running between the wickets was breathtaking. 

India were again disappointing in the field, dropping at least two catches and bowling several wides and no balls. Munaf Patel was the worse among bowlers, conceding 64 runs for one wicket in his 10 overs. 

West Indian captain Brian Lara made a scrappy 36 from 62 balls in his final ODI on home turf before he departed run-out, waving his bat at his adoring fans in the stands. 

India checked the flow of runs after the 20th over when West Indies had advanced to 92 for two riding on Gayles mighty hitting. Virender Sehwag did more than was asked of him as the fifth bowler, bowling his 10 overs for only 29 runs and claiming Gayles wicket. 

Gayle had taken off like a steam train, hitting Sreesanth for two fours each in his first three overs, to rub the salt further into bowlers wounds after he was mortified to see Gayle dropped off the second ball he bowled. Gayle had provided a head-high catch to wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni and then took his chance with both hands. He completed his half century with two successive fours off Sehwag before losing his off-stump, making 51 from 61 balls with 10 fours. 

His partner, Sewnarine Chattergoon was out first ball bowled when he shouldered arm to Ajit Agarkar and saw the ball hit his off-stump. 

Sarwan, continuing with his outstanding form of the series, hit yet another half century. He made 52 runs from 97 balls with just one four before he dashed down the track but missed a Sreesanth delivery which hit his off-stump. 

Bravo was relieved when Robin Uthappa dropped him at midwicket boundary off impressive Agarkar.

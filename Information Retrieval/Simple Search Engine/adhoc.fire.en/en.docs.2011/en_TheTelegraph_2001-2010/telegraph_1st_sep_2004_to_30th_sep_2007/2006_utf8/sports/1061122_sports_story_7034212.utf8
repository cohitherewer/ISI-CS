New Delhi: Jose Ramirez Barreto, for a change, would curse himself for scoring at least one of the two goals he struck in the 1-1 draw against Mahindra United in the Durand Cup quarter final league match on Tuesday. 

Barreto started the match on an usual note when he put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 26th minute off a flag-kick, but was the culprit of scoring an own goal early in the second half that put the Mumbai outfit on level terms. Thereafter, it turned out to be a real struggle for Mohun Bagan to maintain status quo as Mahindra held advantage over their rivals throughout the second half. 

On the whole it was a highly forgettable encounter between the two best teams in the tournament. The only difference was that Mahindra were more eager to get all the three points, while the Mohun Bagan looked satisfied with a draw. 

The Calcutta teams attitude was reflected in the words of their coach Biswajit Bhattacharya after the match. I am satisfied with the result, he said. I had to field quite a few of my players in unusual positions. So we had a disadvantage. Overall, I am happy with the way my team played. 

Men who actually stood out in Mohun Bagan were the defenders. While both Manas Das and Bijoy Basfore gave their hearts out, Brazilian Eduardo offered little room to Mahindra attackers. The Mumbai giants have two crafty and experienced strikers in Yusif Yakubu and Portuguese Filipe Azevedo, but both were kept under check by the Mohun Bagan back four. 

The rest was a story of listless football. Barreto was not in his usual self and a non-existent midfield further reduced Mohun Bagans sharpness upfront. Yet, the skillful Brazilian raised hopes of a victory when scored in his typical style. 

The flag-kick by Chinmoy Sarkar was intercepted by Mahindra defence, but was cleared poorly by Peter Siddiqui. Ndem flicked the ball for Barreto, who trapped and then found the net with a neat shot. 

Thereafter, Mahindra took over. For the next 20 minutes in the first half, James Singh and Shammugam Venkatesh camped themselves into the Mohun Bagan camp but the equaliser remained elusive to them. They looked pleasantly surprised when it finally came from unexpected quarters. 

The James Singh corner four minutes after the half time was well directed, but none in the Mahindra ranks could get near the ball. Barreto, who jumped high to clear it, stood stupefied when it hit the back of his head to find the Mohun Bagan net.

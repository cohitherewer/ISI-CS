The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Seasons toppers 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: Daniel David 

 won 68 races and claimed the trainers championship 

 crown unchallenged. Vijay Singh was a poor second as he 

 could hardly concentrate on the his local stock. He had 

 been shuttling between Calcutta, Mumbai and Bangalore almost 

 every week during the 2005-2006 season. Nevertheless, Daniel 

 also bettered his own score of 58 winners saddled last winter. 

 The jockeys championship did cause a flutter or two after Imran Chisty scored a five-win haul about two weeks ago. However, it was a false alarm. C.Alford, who was always in a secured position at the top of the table, sailed home with 43 winners against Chistys 37. The following are the seasons toppers in their respective fields:

 Top three trainers: Daniel David (68 wins), Vijay Singh (38) and Javed Khan (26).

 Top three jockeys: C.Alford (43 wins), Imran Chisty (37) and Mark Reuben (17).

 Top three apprentices: Amandeep Singh (10 wins), Vinay Jaiswal (9) and Afzal Khan (9).

 Top three Tipsters: The Telegraph 

 (634 points), The Hindustan Times (633) and Racing Guide 

 (617).

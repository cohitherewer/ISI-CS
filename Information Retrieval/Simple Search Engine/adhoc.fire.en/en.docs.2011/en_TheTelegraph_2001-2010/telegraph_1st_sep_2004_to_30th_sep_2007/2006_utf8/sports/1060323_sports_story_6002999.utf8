Mumbai: Had it been an individual award, Rahul Dravid may have done a Ricky Ponting and gracefully said Andrew Flintoff (like Herschelle Gibbs) alone deserved to hold the TVS Cup. The trophy being for the team, the Indian captain showed no such gesture. 

While the Test series ended 1-1, England have been the real winners. The hosts were at full strength and ought to have enjoyed home advantage, yet the visitors forced the more convincing win and showed character worthy of being emulated. 

The look on Flintoffs face when Shaun Udal got Munaf Patel, the last wicket to fall on Thursday, suggested hed just won a million pounds lottery. Actually, the victory is worth much more. 

With only a handful of experienced players, we decided to give one last push here... It worked... Of course, I was expecting to be scrapping till the end, but we won rather quickly... Last summer (Ashes) was huge, but this is big... Drawing a Test series in the sub-continent, Flintoff remarked. 

Both the MoS and MoM, he expressed happiness at having set the 2001-02 record in India right: I totalled 26 in that Test series and there was a question mark over whether I could play spinners... Ive been working on my batting (with batting coach Matthew Maynard)... I would have been happier had I got a hundred in one of the Tests, though... 

According to Flintoff, the dismissals of Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar immediately after lunch put England on the road to victory. That they couldnt be stopped got confirmed when Mahendra Singh Dhoni (whose keeping, by the way, wasnt up to the mark) didnt learn from an obvious mistake. 

Monty Panesar dropped Dhoni the first time (off Udal), but he learnt from that rather comical lapse and made no mistake later that over. Some of the others, too, just didnt show the stomach to fight and poor Dravid ? having erred even before the Test got underway ? had to do the defending. 

Under pressure, some didnt make the right choices... It happens, he pointed out. 

Upset with the catching throughout the series, particularly in the final Test (despite tips from the one and only Yajurvindra Singh), Dravid indicated fielding could become a top criterion for selection. 

We need to work on our catching... In future, well probably have to look at selecting those who can field... Not just look at their ability to score... he said after England won their first Test in India since winning in Chennai 21 years ago. 

Dravid, however, dismissed a suggestion that India underestimated England. No, we didnt... They were not at full strength, but we got outplayed by the better team (at the Wankhede) and we accept that... Hopefully, were going to learn. 

On Tuesday evening, England coach Duncan Fletcher had conceded they would have liked to set a target of around 350-360, but even 313 proved so far beyond Indias reach. 

Its a bad loss, acknowledged senior-most pro Sachin, in a chat with The Telegraph, adding hed been reasonably pleased with the score at lunch ? 75 for three. 

For his part, Dravid (who praised Sreesanth and Munaf) insisted hed been positive at the start of the chase and that they would have gone for the target had wickets been in hand at the start of the final session. 

Bottomline is the series ended as early as 75 minutes after lunch.

 Bagan face Barreto threat

Calcutta: Its a homecoming of different sorts for Jose Ramirez Barreto, but the timing cant be more apt. The Brazilian, who once ruled the hearts of Mohun Bagan supporters, will begin his new stint in Indias premier soccer league against the same team. 

Ironical? It may appear so, but Barreto thinks this is how a footballers life goes on. 

Since the Brazilian charmer left the green-and-maroon brigade ? in a strong and stunning protest against some officials misbehaviour two years ago ? the club has seen the first elections (in 15 years), a change of guard in administration and the fall of as many as three more coaches before Jahar Das being appointed to the hot seat. 

Barreto, now a Mahindra United player, looks nonchalant. 

True, I feel a bit sentimental coming back here. But as a professional player, you need to set those sentiments aside and concentrate on fresh challenges, Barreto said on Tuesday, ahead of the National League match against Mohun Bagan at the Salt Lake Stadium. Savio Mediera, Mahindra coach, said his team would take to the field with one agenda ? a win. 

We want to kick off the tournament with a win, he said. 

Apart from Barreto, both Yusif Yakubu and a new recruit ? Ghanaian midfielder David ? are set to be in the starting line-up. 

Mohun Bagan, on the other hand, are keen to adopt a wait-and-watch policy. We will certainly not go all out from the beginning, coach Das said. 

Three ties postponed 

The National League kicked off on Tuesday, but organisational lapses have already started taking shape. If selection of the chief guest for the inauguration was an eleventh-hour arrangement, there is now a fresh jolt to the schedules. 

AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi on Tuesday said that three matches, slated to be held at the Salt Lake Stadium from January 18-20, have been postponed. This is owing to the fact that the dates are clashing with the CII Partnership Summit to be held at the same venue. 

We came to know about this only on Monday. We have already informed our telecast rights holder about the postponement, Das Munshi said. We are yet to decide if the matches can be shifted to venues like Goa or Chennai, he added. 

On January 18, East Bengal were to take on Fransa, with Mohun Bagan scheduled to face JCT and Mohammedan Sporting taking on Salgaocar in the next two days.

 Would be a pity if Sourav is not in playing XI: Dungarpur

Mumbai: Indian cricket teams manager for the upcoming tour of Pakistan, Raj Singh Dungarpur, said that he would like to see the left-hander back in the team against Pakistan. 

Sourav is an outstanding talent and a beautiful player on the off-side. If he is not selected in the playing XI, to my mind it would be the first time that a former captain would be on the reserve bench. That would be a pity. I empathise with him and understand he will be under tremendous pressure to perform and live up to the expectations, Dungarpur said.

 Schumacher claims controversial pole

 - Monaco Grand Prix

 Michael Schumacher in Monaco on Saturday 

Monaco: Germanys Michael Schumacher, driving a Ferrari, saw his pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix mired in controversy for a suspected infringement on Saturday. 

The seven-time world champion finished ahead of Renaults reigning world champion Fernando Alonso and Australias Mark Webber, driving a Williams, in Saturdays qualifying session. 

However, officials are studying an incident near the end of Schumachers session in which his Ferrari stalled in the middle of the track just after the penultimate bend. 

Alonso was on an apparently faster lap than the German, but his Renault and the cars of the drivers in his wake were forced to slow down to avoid Schumachers Ferrari. 

Schumacher said he had misjudged his turn, and then accidentally locked his wheels as he tried to avoid hitting the protection wall, leading to the eventual stalling of his engine. 

 There were cars coming behind me, I knew it, 

 but I couldnt see them well enough to judge when to 

 pull out, then the engine stalled.

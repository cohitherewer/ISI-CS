 India A topple Australia A

 - Tejinder Pal Singh claims three wickets 

 Venugopal Rao made a steady 55 

Darwin: India A beat Australia A by four wickets in their Top End Series clash at the Marrara ground here on Saturday. 

Ravinder Jadeja, Piyush Chawla and Tejinder Pal Singh restricted the hosts to a modest 213, before captain Venugopal Rao hit a steady half-century in the successful chase. 

Railways allrounder Tejinder Pal claimed three for 38, including the scalps of dangerous wicketkeeper-batsman Brad Haddin and Brad Hodge, who made 56 each. 

Haddin and Hodge put on 55 for the third wicket before the spinners pulled the rug from under the Aussies feet. Hodge shared another valuable partnership of 74 with Shane Watson (40). 

Tejinder Pal provided the crucial breakthrough with the wicket of Hodge before Chawla (two for 38) accounted for Watson. Jadeja (two for 46) hastened the end by having Shaun Tait stumped and D. Cullen caught by Reetinder Singh Sodhi. 

The Indians started shakily, losing Robin Uthappa (15) and Shikhar Dhawan (4) before Gautam Gambhir (41) and Rao steadied the ship. 

Rao was caught-behind off Watson for 55 (81 balls, 6x4) with the score on 151 for five.

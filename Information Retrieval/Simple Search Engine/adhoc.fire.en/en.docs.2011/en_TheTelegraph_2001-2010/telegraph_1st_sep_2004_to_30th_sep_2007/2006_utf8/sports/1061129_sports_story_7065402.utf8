 Bengal women players disappointed

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The decision to not participate in the East Zone leg of the BCCI-organised womens cricket meet in Guwahati has come as a major disappointment for the players. 

The CABs working committee decided on Monday not to field a team since its constitution needed to be amended to incorporate the womens game. 

Asked why they had acted late despite BCCIs directive to form a womens team, CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal said that the issue required to be discussed on a legal platform. 

For our constitution to be amended, a special general meeting has to be called and it will take time, he added. 

Interestingly, some West Bengal Womens Cricket Association (WBWCA) officials wanted sports minister Subhas Chakraborty to intervene on Tuesday. 

CAB officials, however, said they were unaware of such a development. The meet is beginning on Thursday. 

Most intriguingly, the CAB decision came after the selection trials of the womens squad were already over. 

According to WBWCA official, the squad had also been selected, but it was not officially announced. 

India allrounder Jhulan Goswami termed the development as disappointing. 

Its a major tournament for us and not participating in it is a bit disappointing, Jhulan said. 

I myself went for trials hoping that I could represent Bengal after a long gap, added Jhulan, who plays for Air India. 

Jhulan was free to don Bengal colours as Air India are not taking part in any of the zonal meets.

 NZ bank on fair pitch

 Second Test vs SA

 Cape Town: Wounded New 

 Zealand will put their faith in familiarity with adversity 

 and a fair pitch in the second Test against South Africa 

 starting on Thursday.

 The Black Caps will be without 

 strike bowler Shane Bond because of a knee injury as well 

 as gritty opener Hamish Marshall, who has been ruled out 

 with sore ribs.

 Seasoned middle-order batsman 

 Nathan Astle will play despite bone chips in his knee while 

 left-arm medium-pacer James Franklin is also battling a 

 knee injury.

 Bracewell was hopeful that the 

 Newlands pitch would be more favourable to batsmen than 

 the Centurion surface on which New Zealand were dismissed 

 for 120 in their second innings.

 South Africa have dropped the 

 struggling Herschelle Gibbs, which is likely to mean a promotion 

 for Boeta Dippenaar to opener and fourth cap for Hashim 

 Amla.

 Amla last played a Test almost 

 16 months ago, against England in Cape Town.

 He was axed after he was unable 

 to convert prolific form in domestic competition into success 

 at the highest level.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Easy win for Blues on Day I 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: The course-favourite, Best Of The Blues, was unstoppable in the Rising Star Cup, on Thursday, the opening day of the cold weather season. The Daniel David-trained hot-favourite took over the running at the top of the final turn and drew away to win by six long lengths. Jockey Imran Chisty partnered the three-year-old colt by Warrshan out of Briar Creek.

 Silver Print was the other favourite to deliver the goods in the afternoons six-event card which was, otherwise, ruled by less fancied winners. The piping hot-favourite, from trainer Vijay Singhs yard, was, however, a shade of her past with jockey C.Alford having to belt the Steinbeck filly for a two-length-plus victory in the Absolution Handicap.

 Vijay had a bigger shock coming. The trainers debutante, Aromatique, failed to justify his short odds in the 1,200m Turf Hawk Cup. The D. Khaitan-property was under pressure right after the final bend. He finished a poor third behind the winner, his ownermate, Aluminous a Javed Khan-trainee, ridden by S. Shanker.

 Trainer Farley Rodrigues, Eglevsky, made most of the favourites, Tip Toes, withdrawal in the Record Reign Handicap. The favourite unseated her jockey, Mark Reuben, on her way to the start and bolted round the course. Sources close to her stable, however, were hardly shocked by the fillys antics.

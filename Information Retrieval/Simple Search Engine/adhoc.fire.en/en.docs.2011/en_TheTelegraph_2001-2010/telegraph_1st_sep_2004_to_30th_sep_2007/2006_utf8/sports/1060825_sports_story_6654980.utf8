 Raja most gifted of the 70s: Bari 

 - He was more talented than Sobers: Nawaz 

 Raja 

Islamabad: The cricket world is mourning the loss of Wasim Raja, who died at the age of 54 while playing in a seniors match in England on Wednesday. While Sarfraz Nawaz has compared Raja with the West Indian allrounder Gary Sobers, Dilip Vengsarkar described him as a thorough gentleman. 

Following are some tributes to the former Pakistan allrounder: 

INTIKHAB ALAM: He was a genuine allrounder and always rescued the team either with his batting or bowling. 

WASIM BARI: I think he was the most gifted cricketer of the 70s ... especially after he scored loads of runs against the West Indies. I used to be his roommate on a number of tours abroad. He was very lively and a thorough gentleman. Its sad to lose such a good man at such a young age. 

MOHSIN KHAN: We both played a lot of international cricket together and he was one of the most talented cricketers Pakistan has ever produced. He had such a wonderful style of batting that he had fans all over the world. 

SARFRAZ NAWAZ: Talent-wise I think Raja was better than Sobers Raja had a wide range of cricketing shots. He was a very brave cricketer, who even scored against the mighty West Indies. 

PERCY SONN (ICC president): I did not know Wasim personally but what I do know is that the game has lost a great servant, a true entertainer and someone who played with a flair that only a player with real talent can display. The proof of that talent is there for all to see in the fact that his finest series was against the great West Indies side of the late 1970s, and anyone who made runs against that line-up at that time could play. 

DILIP VENGSARKAR: He was a dear friend who was ever smiling on the field of play and became very friendly with the Indian cricketers when we hardly knew any player from Pakistan on our maiden visit in 1978. But I think after the age of 50, one should refrain from playing the game as sudden sprints, while chasing the ball, can lead to trouble. One has to take care after crossing this age.

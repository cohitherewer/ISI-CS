 Adriano has scores to settle

Bergisch Gladbach: Brazil striker Adriano hopes the world champions can face Italy in the next round of the World Cup and give him the chance to settle a few scores. 

The player wants to strike back after receiving some stinging criticism in Italy for his performances with Inter Milan, where he scored 19 goals in 47 games this season. 

From my personal perspective, if we could face Italy and I play well and score a goal, it would be perfect. he said.

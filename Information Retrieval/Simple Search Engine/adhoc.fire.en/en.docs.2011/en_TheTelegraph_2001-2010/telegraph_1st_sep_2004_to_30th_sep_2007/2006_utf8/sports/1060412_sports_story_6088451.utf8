 Guus Hiddink may move to Russia

Amsterdam: Australian coach Guus Hiddink says he is almost certain to take over as Russias coach after the World Cup. 

We are working out the final details of the contract and when that is finished I will join them, said Hiddink, who is also PSV Eindhoven coach, to a Dutch TV programme on Monday. 

Russia failed to qualify for the World Cup in Germany, which starts in June. If Hiddink agrees then he would be in charge of Russia until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. 

Hiddink is Australias part-time coach, and helped them to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 32 years. He announced last month that he would also end a four-year spell at PSV by leaving the Dutch club at the end of this season. 

On Sunday, PSV clinched their 19th league title and sixth under Hiddink, who also managed the team in the late 1980s. The 59-year-old coach reached the semi-finals of the last two World Cups with the Netherlands and South Korea respectively. 

Meanwhile, Australia hope to appoint a full-time coach to replace Guus Hiddink when the Dutchman leaves the job after the World Cup. 

Football Federation Australia (FFA) wants the new coach to spend a lot of time after the team, unlike Hiddink who is combining the role with coaching PSV simultaneously. 

We are keen to have a national coach who would be able to be full-time ? we would be looking to tap into his experience in all manner of ways, John Boultbee, the FFAs head of high performance, said on Tuesday. 

The FFA, which has not ruled out hiring an Australian, said it would be happy for assistant coach Graham Arnold to lead the team in their opening Asian Cup qualifiers if necessary. 

The local candidates are led by the people weve got working for us at the moment, Graham Arnold, Boultbee said. 

Were in a very good situation in that it will be seamless when Guus leaves with Graham Arnold and Johann Neeskens ready to take our teams to the Asian Cup if we havent totally completed the task of naming a new coach. 

We are absolutely confident that we will be able to attract a coach of a very good calibre, he said. The reputation and the performances of the Socceroos has made Australia a very interesting prospect for very high calibre coaches.

 CAB seeks explanation

A STAFF REPORTER

 No ODI at Eden 

Calcutta: The CAB has written a letter to the BCCI asking why Eden Gardens has not been allotted a match in the forthcoming home series against the West Indies and Sri Lanka. 

The letter said there was a feeling among some members of the CAB that as per the BCCIs rotation policy, Calcutta should have been allotted one match. 

The letter sent by CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal sought to know whether there were any changes in the BCCIs rotation policy and the basis on which the matches were allotted to various centres. 

Pal said the CAB would decide on a course of action after receiving the response.

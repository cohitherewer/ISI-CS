 Camp in Goa 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Gurgaon: The national camp for the Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen will now take place in Goa. Delhi was tipped to host the camp, but lack of accommodation in the capital forced the AIFF to shift the venue to Goa. 

Meanwhile, Sandip Nandy and Manjit Singh got the call-up, despite their injuries in Santosh Trophy. 

Seniors like Alvito DCunha, Abhishek Yadav and Bibiano Fernandes have failed to make the cut, Bhaichung Bhutia figures very much in the coach Bob Houghtons scheme of things for the Doha challenge.

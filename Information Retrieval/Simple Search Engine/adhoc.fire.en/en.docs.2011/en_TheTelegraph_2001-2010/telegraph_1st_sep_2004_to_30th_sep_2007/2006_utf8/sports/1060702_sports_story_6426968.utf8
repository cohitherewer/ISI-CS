 Lehmann and a piece of paper

Berlin: Nearly everyone among the 72,000 fans at the Olympiastadion watching Germanys quarter final against Argentina must have seen the symbolic gesture of Oliver Kahn encouraging his promoted rival Jens Lehmann before the decisive penalty shootout. 

Most people missed something that had much more to do with the outcome. 

As the Germans prepared for the penalty series, their coaching staff slipped a piece of paper into Lehmanns gloved hand. On it were the names of Argentina penalty takers and the direction in which they usually shoot. 

Lehmann stopped shots from Roberto Ayala and Esteban Cambiasso, correctly guessing on both saves, and nearly saved the other two shots as well that Argentina took. 

That meant Germany won Fridays shootout 4-2 after a 1-1 tie in extra time and went to the semi-finals, while Argentina went home to ponder how their fancied team failed against the hosts. 

Lehmann discreetly consulted the list between the penalties, keeping it in his right sock. 

We didnt know the order they would shoot in, so he had to look, team manager Oliver Bierhoff said. We have a very detailed scouting program, Bierhoff said Saturday. 

Our goalkeeper got very detailed information. He was told who usually takes penalties on the Argentine team, he was shown videos of all the penalties they shot in the past two years, who shot them, whether they shot left or right. Its very important for the team, Bierhoff said. 

Most of the scouting is done by Urs Siegenthaler, a Swiss hired by head coach Juergen Klinsmann, another decision that raised eyebrows in Germany. Siegenthalers gift of analysing Germanys rivals precisely is paying off. 

We give our players individual information that they need. We talk to players and we show them how their opponents run, which direction, what they normally do in some situations, Bierhoff said. 

We work a lot individually and the players appreciate this. They often come to us to ask questions, he said. 

Lehmann quickly left the stadium after the game and did not mention the piece of paper he got. (Agencies)

 Chowrasia gets special entry

Hong Kong: Indias Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia has been given a special entry into the $2 million UBS Hong Kong Open. 

Chowrasia, whose series of recent good results have put him in line for the Rookie of the Year award, is currently 36th on the Asian Tour Order of Merit. 

He came close to his maiden title before losing in a play-off to Jyoti Randhawa at the Hero Honda Indian Open. He was tragically disqualified when he forgot to sign his scorecard while leading by five shots after two rounds at Mercuries Masters in Taiwan. 

I learnt my lesson in Taiwan and made up at the Indian Open. The Hong Kong Open will be a big opening and the biggest event I have ever played in. I hope to do well, said Chowrasia. (PTI)

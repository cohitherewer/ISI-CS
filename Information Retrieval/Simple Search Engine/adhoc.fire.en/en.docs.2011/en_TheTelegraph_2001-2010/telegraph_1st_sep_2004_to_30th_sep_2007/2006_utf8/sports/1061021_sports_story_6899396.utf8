 10 seconds of madness, says Flintoff

 - SHIRT-WAVING INCIDENT IN MUMBAI, 2002 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: England captain Andrew Flintoff on Friday apologised for his bare-chested, shirt waving incident on his teams 2002 tour of India, saying it was a 10 seconds of madness. 

It was embarrassing, to be honest, Flintoff said ahead of his teams crucial Champions Trophy match here on Saturday. I think the match was hinged on the final over. Sorry, it is not something I am going to do again. It was 10 seconds of madness and I got a bit of stick in the dressing room. 

Ace all-rounder Flintoff celebrated his teams five-run victory over India in the sixth and final one-day at Mumbai in February 2002 by taking off his shirt, upsetting purists in the process. 

He played a key role in his teams series-levelling win, scoring 40 runs and grabbing three wickets. He himself bowled the tidy last over to deny India victory in a narrow encounter. 

India captain Sourav Ganguly returned the favour in the same year when he took off his shirt at the Lords balcony to celebrate his teams remarkable victory over England in the NatWest Trophy final.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I can get events, cant produce champions

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

Calcutta: Tennis pros are known to live out of a suitcase. In Mahesh Bhupathis case, life sometimes gets even more hectic. 

Having landed in Mumbai from London on Tuesday evening, Indian tennis entrepreneur No. 1 flew into Calcutta on Wednesday morning for a Sunfeast Open-related press conference. A few business meetings later, the 10-time Grand Slam doubles champion was headed for the airport again, to catch a plane to Mumbai en route to Rome for his next tournament. 

The Globosport managing director, responsible for bringing three Tour events (two WTA and one ATP) to India, took time off to speak to The Telegraph. 

The following are excerpts 

Q Last year, you had said organising an ATP event was on your future agenda? Youve got one in Mumbai now, its happened pretty fast? 

A We wanted to do a mens Tour event as we thought the market in India was ready for two tournaments, but we didnt think itll materialise so soon. It so happened that the Ho Chi Minh City organisers wanted to lease out their event and we were at the right place at the right time. 

The Chennai ATP meet has set a very high standard in all respects. Can Mumbai match that, especially as it hasnt hosted any major tennis tournament in a long time? 

Thats precisely why we chose to have it in Mumbai. Its the countrys commercial capital, theres no reason why it cant have a popular tennis tournament. 

The Sunfeast Open and Davis Cup (though, of course, this year India have no more assignment) will be a week before the Mumbai meet. Wont there be too much on your plate at that time of the year? 

If I could pick and choose, I obviously wouldnt have had the ATP meet in the last week of September. But you know things dont work out like that. A particular slot in the calendar was empty, so we applied and got it. It will be hectic for me, especially if there is a Davis Cup tie also, but I have no choice. By the grace of God, Ive got a very good team which can do a good job without me coming into the picture too often. 

There is no dearth of tournaments in the country now. But whats the use if the bottomline continues to be gloomy? We still dont have two decent singles players? 

(Getting a bit agitated) I dont understand why we players are always asked this question. Doesnt everyone know the reason? Do we have any kind of system to produce players? Look at Spain, their system keeps churning out players like dosas. They have a new kid on the block, Nicolas Almagro, who has surfaced from nowhere and is beating the Corias and Ferreros hands down. We cant make a wish and produce champions. Leander and Sania are flukes. Leander is an amazing athlete playing tennis. 

The onus is on the national federation to give the players a proper set-up. But dont achievers like you and Leander also have a responsibilty? 

I am still a full-time professional and also have my company to look after. Leander has his real estate business. I can get tournaments, I cant produce champions. Its beyond me to bring up players from the grassroots. If I am given an advisory role, Im prepared to accept it provided Im convinced the federation is serious and doesnt want me just as a figure-head. Leander and I have spoken about this during Davis Cup ties and I think he is also not averse to a constructive advisory role. But we cant go around begging for a role, can we? They have to approach us. 

Dont you get frustrated getting stuck in the zonal rounds of Davis Cup every year? Dont you feel like youve had enough? 

Davis Cup is not really an option for me. Leander and I playing together means a win in our kitty. I see it as a responsibility to help earn the team the doubles point as long as we can. 

Your form on Tour hasnt been great this year, youve dropped out of the top-20. Is your play getting affected by company work? 

No, nothing like that. As I said, I can play without having to bother too much about company work. Tennis continues to be a top priority?Ive been playing some decent tennis, having had two good weeks recently in Monte Carlo and Barcelona (semi-finalist with Radek Stepanek and Lios Friedl, respectively). Wesley (Moodie) took a break but well resume our partnership in Rome next week. We didnt have too many wins in the first three months, but we got some really tough draws? We should be able to turn it around soon. Im not really worried about my form or ranking. 

As her manager, are you satisfied with Sanias progress? 

Yes, I am. After a fabulous 2005, shes been going through some ups and downs. Every athlete experiences that. As long as she can get through 2006 without too many hiccups, she should be fine. The third year will be her biggest one. I sincerely believe her level is good enough to take her into the top rung. 

Sania cant seem to take criticism too well. Must be under a lot of pressure? 

One must remember very few Indian sportspersons have faced the kind of pressure Sania has. Her every move is scrutinised, every dress is a subject of discussion and debate, every match she plays is analysed by multiple experts? I think the media has given her too much grief. She is trying to cope with all these to the best of her ability.

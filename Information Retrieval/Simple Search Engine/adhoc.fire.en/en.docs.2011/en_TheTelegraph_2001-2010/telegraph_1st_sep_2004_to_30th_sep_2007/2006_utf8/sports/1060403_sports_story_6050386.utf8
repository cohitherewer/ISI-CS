Calcutta: P.K. Banerjee heaped rich encomiums on Biswajit Bhattacharya in his column on Thursday, saying that he had a good footballing brain in his playing days... Its good to see him using his intelligence while he is coaching as well. 

No wonder that Biswajits intelligent brain is telling him that behind all the sparkles of Mohun Bagans three consecutive wins under him, the team is yet to enter the safety zone and therefore, his struggle as the coach is still on. Wisely and quickly also, he intends to make his wards aware of the task ahead. 

Forget about any chance of lifting the crown, we have a fresh challenge tomorrow. We are looking for a win because these will be precious points for us to breathe easy?, Biswajit said on the eve of his teams Round X clash against Sporting Clube de Goa at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

For him, Sporting will be the real test for his boys. Sporting is a good team and they have a very formidable attacking duo, in Edeh Chidi and Dudu Omagbemi. I think we will have to take care of our defence, warned the Mohun Bagan coach. 

But if we lose tomorrow, we will go back to the square one, losing sleeps over thoughts of fighting relegation, Biswajit maintained, after the teams practice session at Salt Lake on Sunday. 

Mohun Bagan now have 14 points from 10 matches while Sporting have 16 from nine outings. 

Biswajit particularly picked Chidi and Bibiano Fernandes for special mention. Chidi is even better than Dudu. They play with short passes, which can be very dangerous at times. The number of miss passes by them are also very rare, he observed. 

Mehrajuddin Wadao is still not fit as he is suffering from a groin injury, but Mehtab Hussain, back in the practice after suffering from jaundice, is available for selection. 

Meanwhile, Sporting coach Clifford Chuckuwama sounded pretty confident after their 1-0 win against Mahindra United. Mohun Bagan at present are playing very well and it will be a tough match, Chuckuwama said. 

Mohun Bagan and Sporting played out a goalless draw in Goa in the first-leg.

London: Andrew Strauss scored a century in his first Test as England captain on Sunday to help his team to 258 for the loss of seven wickets in their second innings on the fourth day of the first Test against Pakistan at Lords. 

England, who dismissed Pakistan for 445 in their first innings, now hold an overall lead of 341 with a days play left. Strauss, struck 128, his ninth Test century, to become the third England skipper after Archie MacLaren and Allan Lamb to record a hundred in their debut match as captain. 

Earlier Mohammed Yousuf took his overnight total of 185 to 202, his fourth Test double hundred. It was also the highest score by a Pakistan batsman at Lords, surpassing Mohsin Khans 200 in 1982. 

 Pakistans Test record fourth innings total to win was the 315 for nine they achieved against Australia at Karachi in 1994-95. The equivalent Lords record was West Indies 344 for one, requiring 342, set in 1984. 

Danish Kaneria picked up three for 73 and Shahid Afridi with one for 59. 

Strauss ninth Test century was also his third at Lords after he scored 112 here on debut against New Zealand in May 2004 and 137 against the West Indies two months later. 

 It was a tricky situation as we were losing wickets at important times and we couldnt push on, said Strauss. We needed someone to stick around and fortunately I was able to do that. 

 Ive had a frustrating time this year, getting 20s and 30s isnt good enough for Test cricket. It was a case of overcoming that, the wicket here was flat and it was nice to get to three figures. 

Strauss said that he will sleep on a decision on whether or not to declare first thing on Monday, the final day of the match. At stumps Liam Plunkett was five not out and Matthew Hoggard on nought. 

England began the final session on 154 for four after Kevin Pietersen and all-rounder Paul Collingwood, whose Test-best 186 was the centrepiece of Englands first innings 528 for nine declared, had fallen to Afridi and Kaneria respectively. 

Kevin Pietersen took 14 balls to get off the mark but then appeared to be getting into his stride with six fours before he was stumped by Akmal off Afridi for 41. 

Collingwood, made only three, caught by Salman Butt at mid-off from Kaneria, and England were in some trouble at 146 for four. 

Ian Bell, the third first innings century-maker, was again assured, fending off some spiteful deliveries from the spinners, while Strauss accumulated runs at the other end through the leg side and square of the wicket. 

Bell was run out for 28 when Strauss, on 99, scampered the single which would have taken him to his hundred. Unfortunately the ball went straight to Inzamam-ul-Haq at mid-wicket and the Pakistan captain hit the stumps with a direct hit with Bell short of his ground. 

Strauss reached his century with 11 fours from 168 deliveries in 234 minutes before he was caught behind. 

 Earlier, England wrapped up Pakistans first 

 innings for 445 ?? a lead of 83 ?? after Yousuf was last 

 man out for a superb 202. Yousuf is now only the second 

 Pakistani after batting great and current tour manager Zaheer 

 Abbas (274 at Edgbaston in 1971 and 240 at The Oval in 1974) 

 to make two Test double centuries against England.

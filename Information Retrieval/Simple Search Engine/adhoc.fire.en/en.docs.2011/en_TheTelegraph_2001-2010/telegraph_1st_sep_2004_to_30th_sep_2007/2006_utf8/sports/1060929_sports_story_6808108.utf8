The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A story of poor management

 - Jharkhand travelled 40km before and after matches 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Ever heard of a visiting team catching a crowded local train on match days to reach the ground in the national championships? And then taking a train back to reach the hotel 40 km away after a gruelling 90-minute battle on the pitch? 

That was the state of affairs for Jharkhand team, who came here to try their luck in the Santosh Trophy. 

So poor are the boarding and lodging system in the Santosh Trophy that several teams simply walked out of the official accommodations to make their own arrangements. While some states with deeper pockets could afford better hotels, teams like Jharkhand had no option but to stay far away from the venue. 

Totally dependent on meagre daily allowance of Rs. 350 per player provided by the AIFF, we could only manage a small guest house in Delhi and were travelling daily up and down to Faridabad, said Jharkhand manager BD Chatterjee. It was terribly taxing on the players, but the arrangements at Faridabad were totally unacceptable. 

While the AIFF sources said that they have asked the organisers to pull up their socks both in writing and verbally, the Haryana Football Association (HFA) secretary, Sunil Bhardwaj said he had tried his best. 

The AIFF gives a daily allowance of Rs. 350 per player, Bhardwaj pointed out. Let anyone come to Gurgaon and Faridabad and make better arrangements than us 

Bhardwaj has a point. All AIFF officials, posted in Gurgaon and Faridabad for the Santosh Trophy, are being put up in decent hotels. Some are even drawing handsome daily allowances to look after the arrangements.

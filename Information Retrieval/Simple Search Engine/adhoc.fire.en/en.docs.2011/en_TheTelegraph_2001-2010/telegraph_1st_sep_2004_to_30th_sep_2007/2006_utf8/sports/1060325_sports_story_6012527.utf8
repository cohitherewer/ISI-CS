Miami: Georgian teenager Anna Tatishvili saw off Indian tennis star Sania Mirza on a rain-wracked Thursday, while Tim Henman burned the midnight oil at the $6.9 million Miami WTA and ATP Masters meet to beat former world No. 1 Marat Safin. 

Tatishvili, who trains in Florida and received a wild card into the draw, beat Sania 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 7-6 (10-8) to claim her first match victory in her fourth WTA Tour event. 

After letting slip a 4-0 lead in the third set, she fended off Sanias chances to take the match, despite admitting to nerves on the big stage of stadium court. 

I just really wanted to win, Tatishvili said. 

She hung in there and she was playing some great tennis, said Sania, who this week received the WTA award for Best Newcomer of 2005, but who fell in an opening match for the third time in seven events in 2006. 

I guess its a bit tough when youre not really playing the best tennis and the other girl is just playing some unbelievable shots, she said. 

In other womens matches, Dutchwoman Michaella Krajicek out-gunned Chinas Zi Yan 6-3, 5-7, 6-1 while Japans Shinobu Asagoe advanced when Spaniard Nuria Llagostera retired while trailing 7-6, 2-3. 

Henman swept past Russias Safin in a first-round battle of injury-comeback players 6-3, 6-3 after taking to the court around midnight. 

The wait was worth it. 

To give myself a bit of credit, Ive been playing all right, the Briton told reporters. Thats why Im not that surprised with the performance. 

You know, the result is the bonus. I feel the way Ive played the last four weeks, Ive been hitting the ball great. 

Former Wimbledon runner-up Mark Philippoussis was also full of smiles after beating Italian Davide Sanguinetti 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 to reach the second round. 

Philippoussis began in the afternoon and ended in the evening. The players waited through an afternoon rain delay of four and a half hours. 

(I) got here at nine in the morning, its definitely good to come out with a win after this long day, the Australian said. (It will) definitely make me sleep a lot easier, thats for sure. 

Britains Greg Rusedski overcame an early run of five successive double-faults to beat Russian Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-1. I dont remember starting a match with five double-faults in my career, Rusedski told reporters. 

The left-hander trailed 1-3 after three double faults in his first service game and two more in his second. Rusedski fought back well to take the opening set and raced into a 5-0 lead in the second. 

The Briton, who delayed the start of his season until February due to the birth of his first child, next plays 32nd seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. (AGENCIES)

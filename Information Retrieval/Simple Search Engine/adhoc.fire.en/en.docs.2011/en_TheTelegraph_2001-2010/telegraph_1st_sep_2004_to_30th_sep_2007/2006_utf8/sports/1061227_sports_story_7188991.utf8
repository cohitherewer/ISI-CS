 Unfit Munaf in XII!

Team India captain Rahul Dravid has accepted that Munaf Patel, who was named in the XII for the second Test, isnt at hundred per cent fitness. He suffered an ankle injury more than a month ago and, really, shouldve been sent home. 

This is what Dravid told the Media on Tuesday: We werent sure whether Munaf would last five days... Hes still two-three days away from where we would like him to be (fitness-wise)... Its too risky with the young fast bowlers... We couldnt have put his career at risk... 

Well, such an all expenses paid holiday is rare and one Irfan Pathan must be feeling done in. Also, physio John Gloster needs to explain.

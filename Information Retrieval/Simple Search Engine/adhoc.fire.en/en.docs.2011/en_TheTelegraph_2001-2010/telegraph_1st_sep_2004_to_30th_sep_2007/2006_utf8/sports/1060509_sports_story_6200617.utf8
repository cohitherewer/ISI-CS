 Vishy: Openers must deliver in WI

A STAFF REPORTER

 Gundappa Viswanath 

Calcutta: Former India captain Gundappa Viswanath feels India have a good opportunity to win both the Test and ODI series in the West Indies this time. 

We have a good chance as we have a very balanced bowling attack this time, Viswanath said at the Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake campus on Monday. The stalwart is here as a batting consultant for the trainees of the zonal cricket academy. 

Talking on the prospects of Team India, Viswanath felt that India do have good new ball bowlers who could turn things around in Indias favour. Apart from the mediumpacers, we also have top spinners, he said. 

He, though, seemed worried about the opening slot. If you have to do well there your openers must deliver, otherwise the pressure will be on the middle order, he said, adding that wickets have slowed down a bit in the West Indies compared to those in 1976. 

He toured there for the last time in 1975-76 and played four Tests. 

Rating Indias ODI performance as fantastic, Viswanath admitted that India have to improve their performance in the longer version of the game. 

India will also have to work out a winning formula in the Tests and the trip to the Windies will surely be an acid test for the side, he remarked. 

On the International Cricket Councils move to make more use of technology, the former Match Referee said: These are all experiments, and I dont think this will last long like the super sub rule? he opined. 

Terming Steve Bucknors allegation of doctoring images by television crews as serious, he said: Bucknor must have experienced that? Otherwise a man of his calibre wouldnt have made a comment like this. 

Viswanath said the rotation policy was the answer to the burnout issue. Now you have a strong reserve bench. Viswanath also hoped that Sourav Ganguly will make a comeback in the Tests but chances are dim for him in the shorter version. 

He hasnt announced his retirement and if he performs in the first class matches the selectors will have to pick him. He added that a player of Souravs calibre doesnt need to prove himself after scoring over 10,000 ODI runs and 5,000 Test runs.In his 91 Tests, Viswanath scored 6080 runs at an average of 41.93. 

Viswanath also felt that veteran leg-spinner Anil Kumble deserved a place among the probables for 2007 World Cup but was not sure about VVS Laxman. 

Im not sure about Laxman, but Kumble should be there, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania impresses Akhtar, Piperno

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza faces a first round clash against qualifier Rushmi Chakravarthy at the WTA Sunfeast Open. 

The world No. 70 had two practice sessions on Sunday. A brief early morning stint with local boys was followed by an extended evening workout with partner Liezel Huber of South Africa, with whom she will take on Ragini Vimal and Archana Venkataraman in doubles. 

Sania has hit a bad patch of late, but after seeing her from close quarters, former national coach and Fed Cup captain Enrico Piperno feels Sania is looking meaner and fitter. 

She is looking a lot fitter than I last saw her during the Fed Cup, Piperno told The Telegraph. 

She seems to be moving well, her volleying at the nets is also better. Hopefully she will go up in rankings from now on, Piperno, who was present at both of Sanias practice sessions, said on Sunday. 

Former Davis Cup coach Akhtar Ali agrees. 

Her doubles play, in which not many realise she is world No.28, has actually been complimentary to her game in singles. Her reflexes are sharper now and she looks a more confident athlete, Ali, who scrutinised Sania during the early morning stint, said. 

She is as good as anyone, even Hingis, and going up in the rankings ladder is just a matter of time, he added. 

Sania is scheduled to interact with schoolkids on Monday, her first off-court event since stepping into this city.

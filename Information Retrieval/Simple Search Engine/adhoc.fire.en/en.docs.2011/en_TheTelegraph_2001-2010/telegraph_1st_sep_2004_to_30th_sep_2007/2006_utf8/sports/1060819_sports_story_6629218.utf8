 Dont blame SA: 

 Srikkanth 

 - No one can stop Sourav if he believes in his abilities 

 K. Srikkanth 

Jaipur: Former India captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth on Friday said the South Africans were justified in pulling out of the tri-series following a bomb blast in Colombo, pointing out that they were not used to terror situations. 

One cant blame the South Africans for shying away from the tri-series because their players are not used to such things, Srikkanth said. 

The former opener said South Africans, Australians and English players were not used to such conditions whereas Indian players had witnessed them in the past. 

Asked if the high security and terror in Sri Lanka would affect the performance of the indian team, Srikkanth replied in the negative. 

Our players are strong enough to cope up with any such adverse situation. I think they would play their natural game in Sri Lanka, he said on the sidelines of a function here. 

Srikkanth said with the return of Sachin Tendulkar from an injury lay-off, Team India should continue with him in the opening slot alongwith Virender Sehwag. 

I think India should continue with the pair of Sachin and Sehwag, there is no need to change this attacking batting slot. 

 About Souravs return, Srikkanth said: No one can stop him if he believes in his abilities and starts playing good cricket. He also added that Sourav will make a comeback in the Champions Trophy.

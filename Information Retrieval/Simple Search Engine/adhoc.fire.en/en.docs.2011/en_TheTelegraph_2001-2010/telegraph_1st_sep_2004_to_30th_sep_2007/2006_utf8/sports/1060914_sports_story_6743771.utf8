 Spain ride Freixa hattrick to semis

Moenchengladbach: Santiago Freixa scored a hattrick and Spain joined Australia in the semi-finals of the World Cup with a hard-fought but unimpressive 4-2 win against Japan in their concluding pool A match here on Wednesday. 

Spain struggled to find their rhythm and fluency and enjoyed a few close shaves before coming through on goals by Freixa (44th, 57th, 66th) and Pol Amat (22nd) with Kenichi Katayama (15th, 48th) replying for Japan. 

The victory took Spain to 11 points, two more than Australia who had ensured their qualification on Tuesday. Japan finished at the bottom of the pool with three points from their lone win against Argentina. 

Japan were distinctly unlucky to lose, for they had their chances and repeatedly troubled the Spanish defence with nippy moves. But the absence of a specialist drag-flicker weighed down Japan who could not convert any. (PTI)

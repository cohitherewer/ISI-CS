 Flintoff to lead in Ashes too

London: Andrew Flintoff will lead Englands Ashes defence in Australia later this year after being named as captain when the 16-man squad was announced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Tuesday. 

The allrounder was given the nod ahead of opener Andrew Strauss who has captained the side in the absence of the injured Flintoff during the recent Test and one-day series against Pakistan. 

Left-arm spinner Ashley Giles, one of the key figures in Englands Ashes triumph last year, was also named in the squad despite missing the entire season with a hip injury.

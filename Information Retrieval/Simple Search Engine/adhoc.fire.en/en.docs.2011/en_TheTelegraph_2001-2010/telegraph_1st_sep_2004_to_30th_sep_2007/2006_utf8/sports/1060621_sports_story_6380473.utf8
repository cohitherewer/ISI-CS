The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav to bat at No. 4 or 5

 - Stage set for Face-off with Zaheer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly

Calcutta: Former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly will bat either at No.4 or 5 on his debut for Northamptonshire, in Worcester. 

The four-day (Division-II) Championship match begins on Wednesday. 

While Worcestershire are currently No.2, with three wins from seven outings, Northants are third from the bottom with two wins from six matches. 

Weve shortlisted 12 and Sourav, obviously, is going to play, Northamptonshire coach Kepler Wessels told The Telegraph on Tuesday evening. 

Depending on the conditions, either opener Robert White or off-spinner Jason Brown will have to sit in the dressing room. 

If Brown doesnt play, Monty Panesar is going to be the sole specialist spinner in the 11. 

Both Northants and the hosts need to climb higher and Wessels acknowledged the opposition was formidable. 

Opener Phil Jacques (averaging almost 90) is a big threat? Then, the Worcester opening attack is high on quality? Zaheer Khan, Kabir Ali and Matt Mason? We know what to expect, he said. 

The face-off between Sourav and his one-time prot?g? should be interesting. Zaheer had gone flat out in last seasons Duleep final in Motera. Its unlikely that he will be considerate over the next few days either. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, fell for a blob in each innings. 

Zaheer, who has been in and out of Team India for almost a year, is his Countys leading wicket-taker. Eleven of his 48 first-class wickets came in the last match alone, versus Essex. 

Clearly, the left-armer is the form bowler. 

Wessels, meanwhile, informed that Sourav had been putting in plenty of work at nets. Also, that hed requested him to guide the batsmen on tackling spinners. 

We signed Sourav (as Chris Rogers replacement till early August) because of our belief that he has it in him to add value? Hes doing the right things, Wessels signed off. 

 NORTHANTS XI 

Stephen Peters, Robert White/Jason Brown, Bilal Shafayat, Usman Afzal, Sourav Ganguly, David Sales, Lance Klusener, Riki Wessels (wk), Ben Philips, Matthew Nicholson, Monty Panesar.

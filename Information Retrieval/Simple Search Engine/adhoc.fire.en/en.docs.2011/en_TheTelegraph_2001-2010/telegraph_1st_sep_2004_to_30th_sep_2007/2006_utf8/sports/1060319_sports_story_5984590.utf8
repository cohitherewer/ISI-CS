 Deisler ruled out of World Cup

Berlin: Germany midfielder Sebastian Deisler will miss the World Cup because of a knee injury, the German Football Association (DFB) said on Saturday. 

An arthroscopy performed in the United States showed the 26-year-old midfielder needs surgery on his knee and will be out of action for six months. 

Deisler has had four operations on his right knee, one of which meant he missed the 2002 World Cup. 

He sustained the latest injury in a clash with England midfielder Owen Hargreaves during Bayern training on Tuesday. 

The operation will be performed by American knee specialist Richard Steadman at his clinic in Vail, Colorado. Deisler should be back in Germany in about a week. 

One of few truly creative players Germany possess and a great crosser of the ball, Deisler is an automatic choice for Germany when fully fit and his injury is a terrible blow to national coach Juergen Klinsmanns World Cup hopes. 

Deisler was hailed as a unique talent when he was a teenager but his promising career has been hobbled by injury. He was sidelined for five months in the 2003-04 season while being treated for depression.

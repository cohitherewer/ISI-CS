 Miserly Kumble bags 2 for Surrey

London: Anil Kumble played his part well for Surrey in denying a smooth progress to Northamptonshire on the opening day of a four-day Division II County Championships match at Kensington Oval on Wednesday. 

Kumble bowled economically to claim a couple of crucial wickets for 56 runs. First, he despatched Usman Afzaal (13) by effecting a caught and bowled dismissal. Later, he removed Lance Klusener (31), caught by Scott Newman. 

Trying to revive their innings, Northants were 260 for six at tea, with Bilal Shafayat (61 batting) and Ben Phillips (31) putting up an unbeaten 71-run stand for the seventh wicket. 

Earlier, Chris Rogers half-century (59) helped Northants get past the 100-run mark. For Surrey, spinner Nayan Doshi (2/42) and seamer Mohammed Akram (2/55) were the other successful bowlers. 

Meanwhile, County sides in England will go back to playing only one overseas player at a time from the next season. The England and Wales Cricket Board unanimously agreed to the reduction of players from two to one, a British television reported.

 McClaren takes over 

London: Steve McClaren wasted no time distancing himself from Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

Its very exciting, I cant wait to actually get started. It will be a great challenge and a great adventure, McClaren said on Tuesday as he officially took over as Englands 11th national soccer coach. 

Its going to be totally different, Im going to do it my way. Its going to be different from Sven, Im looking forward to the big challenge. 

He assumed control exactly a month after Portugal ended Englands hopes in the quarter finals of the World Cup. The loss ended Erikssons five-and-a-half year tenure. 

McClarens term also began almost 40 years to the day that England won their only World Cup. 

He signed a four-year deal in May after Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari turned down the job. 

Its a new chapter in the life of the England national team, said Brian Barwick, the Football Associations chief executive. 

McClaren was asked when he would name a new captain to replace David Beckham, who stepped down from the role after the World Cup. Chelseas John Terry and Liverpools Steven Gerrard are the leading contenders. 

Individuals and smaller details well get to later on, McClaren said, talking to reporters as he entered his central London office. 

McClarens first game is an August 16 friendly against Greece at Old Trafford.

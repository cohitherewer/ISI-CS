Las Vegas: Daniel Chopra registered his career-best result on US PGA Tour with a tied second finish after coming within a whisker of maiden PGA Tour title at the Frys.com Open. 

Indian Arjun Atwal played a final round of one-over 73 and finished in a tie for 44th place that still kept him 138th on the money list and his fate for next season still hangs in balance as only the top-125 get full card for 2007. 

The Stockholm-born golfer, born of an Indian father, failed to get a birdie from 18-feet to force a play-off, and Troy Matteson (69) calmly two-putted from eight feet to take his first tour title at 22-under 266. 

Chopras final round was a six-under 66 after a eight-under 64 in the third round and he finished 21-under 267. 

Chopra, who started playing in Delhi, picked up the biggest cheque of his career $352,000 to take his seasons earnings to $1,514,812. 

Chopra had birdies on first, third and ninth and turned in three-under. His only bogey came on 11th and then he birdied the 13th and eagled the 16th to shoot into contention. A birdie on the 17th added to the drama but his par on 18th kept him one shot short in tied second.

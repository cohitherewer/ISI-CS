 Delhi puts in bid of a billion people

 - 2014 GAMES Incheon City cries foul 

Doha: Ignoring opposition from Incheon City (South Korea), India on Saturday made a formal presentation of their bid to host the 2014 Asian Games in New Delhi by seeking the whole-hearted support of the continent for the bid of a billion people. 

The Indian contingent, led by Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president Suresh Kalmadi, made a detailed presentation about its proposed infrastructure and facilities for the Games at a special meeting of the Olympic Council of Asia. 

Incheon City, the only other bidder for the 2014 Games, also made a presentation. 

In his address, Kalmadi stressed that the bid had the support of the Indian government, which had sent sports secretary Madhukar Gupta as a part of the delegation. It is the bid of a billion people. The whole of India want the Games to be held there. Therefore, we can expect a bigger participation and involvement, Kalmadi said. 

 Kalmadi asked the OCA members 

 if they had any query or clarification regarding Indias 

 bid, but none of them raised a vocie. This has been interpreted 

 by IOA officials as a virtual clean chit. 

New Delhi hosted the inaugural Asian Games in 1951 and also staged the ninth edition of the continental extravaganza in 1982. 

India will host the 2010 Commonwealth Games. (PTI)

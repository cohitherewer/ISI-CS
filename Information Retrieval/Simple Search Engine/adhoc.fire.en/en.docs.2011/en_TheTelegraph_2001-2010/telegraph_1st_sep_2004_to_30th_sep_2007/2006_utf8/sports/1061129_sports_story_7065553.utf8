 Sehwag braces up for dual challenge

Port Elizabeth: Battered and bruised by two humiliating defeats, India go into the fourth ODI against South Africa here on Wednesday with their fragile batting further crippled by the absence of captain and lynchpin Rahul Dravid. 

The injury to Dravid, who has suffered the fracture on his right middle finger, could not have come at the worse time for the beleaguered Indians, who are under immense pressure to improve their performance. 

Dravids unavailability has put Virender Sehwag in charge of the team but the opener himself is going through a prolonged lean patch. 

Trailing the five match series 0-2, the visitors need a far more inspiring performance with a collective firing from their key batsmen to be able to turn the table against the fancied hosts. 

After the first match was washed out by rains, Indian batsmen struggled against South African pace attack losing their last two matches by huge margins of more than 100 runs. 

Stylish batsman V.V.S. Laxman, who was initially overlooked for the series, has been drafted in as a replacement for Dravid but it appears unlikely that he would be able to reach the venue in time. 

Stand-in captain Sehwag now has the dual responsibility of attending to his batting as well as motivating the players to stop the team from sliding one step closer to a complete whitewash in the series. 

Sehwag himself missed the first two matches of the tour due to a finger injury and is struggling to find form after he was out for a duck in the third ODI on Sunday. 

Sachin Tendulkar too could sense the heat around him as he is seen doing nothing to shore up the teams cause and another failure here would park the caravan of critics right in front of his door. 

 But the players are not missing out on moments to celebrate, as it was only on Monday when Suresh Rainas birthday was celebrated with vigour, although such moments on this tour have been few and far between. 

Dravids injury means a door of opportunity for Raina and Dinesh Mongia and they will surely look to cash in on the situation on the eve of the selection of Test squad. 

South Africa, on the other hand, have the luxury to try out new faces and they have gone ahead and done exactly so in this match by adding Ashwell Prince to the squad. 

Prince replaces Boeta Dippenaar as the only change to the South African ODI squad for the remaining two matches against India. 

The left-hander is not quite cut-out for one-day cricket but his powers of concentration of technique as well as fine running between the wickets would be an invaluable asset in the Caribbean next year. 

The Port Elizabeth pitch, however, has the reputation of being the slowest in South Africa. It remains to be seen whether India go in with 3-2 attack or just one spinner to reinforce their batting. 

India, however, can take little heart from their record at St Georges Park, as it has turned out to be a jinxed ground for them. They have lost all their three previous encounters in Port Elizabeth, including a humiliating 70-run reversal against Kenya in 2001. 

The Indian batsmen have always struggled here with scores of 146, 179 for nine and 176 in their last three games.

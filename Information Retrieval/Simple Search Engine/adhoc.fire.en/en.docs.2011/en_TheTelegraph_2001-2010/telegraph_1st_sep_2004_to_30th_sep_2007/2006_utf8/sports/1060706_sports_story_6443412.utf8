 QUICK TAKES

 Germany 

 to confer Order of Merit on Blatter 

 Berlin: German Chancellor 

 Angela Merkel plans to present Fifa President Sepp Blatter 

 with the countrys Federal Order of Merit. The Chancellor 

 hopes to present the award to Blatter, a Swiss national, 

 after Germany compete for third place in the play-off on 

 Saturday, Merkels spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, said 

 on Wednesday. The Federal Cross of Merit, or Bundesverdienstkreuz, 

 is Germanys only state decoration. Between 3,000 and 

 5,200 awards are given every year.

 Play-off to stay 

 Berlin: The consolation match between World 

 Cup semi-final losers remains a key prestige encounter for 

 the players and there are no plans to do away with it in 

 the future, Fifa said on Wednesday. I believe there 

 is still a high value for this match, a Fifa spokesman 

 told reporters a day after Germany lost to Italy 0-2. 

 2.2 injuries per game 

 Berlin: The amount of injuries suffered in 

 this World Cup has been roughly the same in comparison to 

 2002 ? an average of 2.2 per match. In the first 58 games, 

 team doctors have reported 129 injuries, according to official 

 statistics. However, a considerable amount, 26 per cent, 

 occurred without the player coming in contact with a teammate 

 or an opponent. 

 Klose support 

 Berlin: German striker Miroslav Klose, top 

 scorer so far in the World Cup, has scored a major one by 

 lending his image during the tournament to a campaign against 

 the use of landmines. Kloses image is featured on 

 a huge video billboard in a busy intersection in Berlin, 

 as well as prominently displayed in newspapers across the 

 country.

 Bus collision 

 Berlin: A Berlin bus driver crashed into a 

 parked car after being hit on the head with a beer bottle 

 by a passenger who disputed his views over Germanys 

 loss in the World Cup semi-final, police said on Wednesday. 

 When the driver commented that the German players 

 just werent good enough, the passenger suddenly 

 hit the driver in the head with a beer bottle. The 

 driver rammed into a parked Mercedes. The passenger fled. 

 Police are looking for the man wearing a Germany jersey 

 with No.20, same as Lukas Podolski.

 Too many chefs 

 Berlin: Fifa has no great concerns about South 

 Africas ability to stage the 2010 World Cup. Fifa 

 had set up a secretariat in Johannesburg to 

 assist local organisers, while British sports minister Richard 

 Caborn, the French government and the European Union were 

 all offering help in what has been likened to a great 

 humanitarian effort, president Sepp Blatter said. 

 At the end of the day, though, there wont be 

 too many cooks spoiling the meal we want to prepare.

 No gout 

 Berlin: A spokesman for Harry Kewell says 

 an infected blister on his foot, not gout, kept the Australia 

 forward out of the Socceroos second-round loss to 

 Italy. Australian teammates told reporters after the match 

 that gout was the reason. It is an infection rather 

 than gout, Kewells manager told a local newspaper.

 Baros in demand 

 London: Hamburg SV have made a preliminary 

 approach to Aston Villa for Czech striker Milan Baros, the 

 Premier League club said on Wednesday. Its true 

 to say weve had a preliminary call from Hamburg, 

 Villa chairman Doug Ellis told the clubs website.

 China deaths 

 Beijing: Eleven Chinese fans have died while 

 watching World Cup matches, a Beijing newspaper reported 

 on Wednesday, citing experts who blamed the high number 

 of deaths on fatigue and extreme emotions. The newspaper 

 said the number of deaths in China was among the highest 

 in any nation even though the countrys team was not 

 in competition.

 Shaolin connection 

 Beijing: The abbot of Chinas ancient 

 Shaolin Temple will fly to Germany to watch the World Cup 

 final at the invitation of Fifa president Sepp Blatter, 

 state media reported on Wednesday. The Fifa invitation came 

 thanks to the growing influence of the Shaolin Temple and 

 Shaolin kung fu, Xinhua news agency quoted abbot Shi Yongxin 

 as saying. Soccer is a team sport played under a civilised 

 set of rules, the kung fu master said.

 Somalia shooting 

 Mogadishu: At least two people were killed 

 when Islamic gunmen opened fire on scores of young demonstrators 

 protesting a ban on World Cup viewing at a cinema in central 

 Somalia, witnesses said on Wednesday. The pair was shot 

 and killed late on Tuesday when soccer fans barred by Islamists 

 from watching the semi-final, complained at the prohibition, 

 they said.

 Ticket scandal 

 Kigali: A second leading African football 

 official has been implicated in a World Cup ticket scandal, 

 Confederation of African Football (CAF) officials have said. 

 CAF executive committee member Celestin Musabyimana has 

 been arrested in Rwanda for allegedly forging documents 

 in an attempt to secure tickets to matches at the finals 

 in Germany.

 Brazil fan killed 

 Nairobi: Kenyan football fans beat to death 

 a young man supporting Brazil after Frances World 

 Cup victory at the weekend, police said on Wednesday. They 

 were going home after watching the game when an argument 

 came up between them about the match, police chief 

 said. 

 Japan coach mystery 

 Tokyo: The mystery over who will become Japans new coach deepened on Wednesday with local media flapping over whether the main candidate had got cold feet. Several newspapers asked whether former Yugoslavia coach Ivica Osim had made a sudden U-turn about taking over from Zico.

Christchurch: New Zealand were poised for victory at stumps on day two of the opening Test against Sri Lanka after 16 wickets fell in three sessions in Christchurch on Friday. 

Sri Lanka were toiling at 125 for eight at the close in their second innings, just 73 runs ahead, with Kumar Sangakkara offering the tourists a glimmer of hope in the low-scoring contest with an unbeaten 63. 

\Shane Bond took his match tally to seven by picking up four scalps and two run-outs as the Sri Lankan top order folded from 44 for 1 to 99 for 8 while Sangakkara remained defiant. 

New Zealand were earlier indebted to Daniel Vettori for their total of 206, the spinner was last man out for 63 as the hosts, who lost four wickets for just seven runs in the morning session, were dismissed in reply to Sri Lankas 154. 

He added 75 in a crucial seventh-wicket stand with skipper Stephen Fleming (48) as off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan dominated proceedings. 

Muralidharan made the initial breakthrough by bowling opener Craig Cumming for 43. The off-spinner then trapped Nathan Astle in front for two before Chaminda Vaas had Jacob Oram caught at mid wicket for two and forced Brendon McCullum to chop onto his stumps for a duck.

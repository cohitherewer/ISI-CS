 Dravid in 2nd spot

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rahul Dravid has upstaged South African Jacques Kallis to move into second position in the latest ICC Test batsmens rankings. 

The twin failures in the final Test against New Zealand in Johannesburg resulted in Kallis dropping a place, allowing Dravid to move a slot behind Australian skipper Ricky Ponting, according to a media release. 

Anil Kumble maintained his ninth position in the bowlers charts. 

Makhaya Ntinis five wickets in Johannesburg have not been enough to take him to the top of the Test bowlers list, with Muttiah Muralidharan still keeping his No. 1 spot. However, a modest series for Muralidharan in England could see his rating drop and, if it does so, that could take Ntini to the No. 1 position. 

The 2-0 series win over New Zealand took South Africa to fifth spot in team rankings. 

 In the allrounders list, Englands Andrew 

 Flintoff dethroned Kallis from the top spot while Shaun 

 Pollock climbed two places to third, overtaking Indias 

 Irfan Pathan and New Zealands Daniel Vettori.

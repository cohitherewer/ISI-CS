The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Draw with Bacrot puts Anand in second 

 spot

 Sofia Chess

 Anand has four points 

 in his kitty 

 Sofia: Viswanathan Anand 

 struggled but finally managed a draw with Etienne Bacrot 

 of France in the sixth round of the MTEL Masters Chess tournament.

 The result saw the Indian ace 

 slip to second spot in the standing list once again as Russian-turned-American 

 Gata Kamsky came back strongly to beat former world champion 

 Ruslan Ponomariov of Ukraine.

 But the highlight of the day was 

 the shock defeat of world champion and local hero Veselin 

 Topalov in the hands of Russian Peter Svidler and now a 

 comeback seems extremely difficult for the Bulgarian.

 Kamsky was at best thought to 

 be a fine player with great fighting spirit at the start 

 of the event. However as the things are now unfolding the 

 lowest ranked player here seems good enough to win the title 

 in the strongest tournament.

 Following his fourth victory in 

 the tournament, the American yet again seized the sole lead 

 and is now on 4.5 points out of a possible 5. Anand, on 

 4 points, is placed second while Svidler is third on 3.5 

 points. Though it is most likely to be a three horse race 

 from here onwards, Topalov, who is on 2.5 points and fourth 

 in the standings, cannot be ruled out of contention.

 Bacrot stands fifth on two points. 

 Ponomariov seems badly in need of some resurrection and 

 is currently in the cellar with just 1.5 points. Only four 

 more rounds remain in the category-20 super tournament being 

 played on a double round robin basis between six players.

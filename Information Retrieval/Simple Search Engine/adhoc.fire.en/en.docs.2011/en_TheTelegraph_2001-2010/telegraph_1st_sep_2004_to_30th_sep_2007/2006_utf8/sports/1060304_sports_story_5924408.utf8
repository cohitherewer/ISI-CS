The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Pawar may meet coach today

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in 

 India (BCCI) president, Sharad Pawar, is expected to have 

 a one-on-one with Greg Chappell in Nagpur on Saturday. That 

 will be significant as the BCCI has just reprimanded 

 the coach for unwarranted comments against Sourav 

 Ganguly in an interview to a UK newspaper.

 The BCCI acted, within a day, after a formal complaint 

 from the former captain. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, Pawar (who is a powerful Union minister) is largely 

 going to be in Maharashtras winter capital for political 

 work, but should definitely find time to watch at 

 least part of the fourth days play of the first India 

 versus England Test. And, of course, a chat with the controversial 

 Australian. 

Chappell, one learns, has replied to the e-mail (sent on Thursday evening) by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah. Besides ticking him off for the interview, Shah asked him to refrain from commenting on anything other than the teams performance and prospects. 

The contents of the e-mail were telephonically cleared by Pawar. 

While details werent available till late on Friday, it seems Chappell hasnt expressed regrets for saying what he did to the UK newspaper. 

Meanwhile, the Sourav issue got raised in Parliament for the second time in less than three months. Also, the Cricket Association of Bengal has finally got into the act.

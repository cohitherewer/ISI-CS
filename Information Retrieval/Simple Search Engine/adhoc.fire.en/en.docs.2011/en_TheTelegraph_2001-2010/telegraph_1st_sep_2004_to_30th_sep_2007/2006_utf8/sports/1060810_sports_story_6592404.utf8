 England can retain Ashes, says Woolmer

 Woolmer

Leeds: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer insisted England could mount a successful defence of the Ashes after they crushed his boys by 167 runs here at Headingley. 

Englands victory left them 2-0 up in the four-Test series, with just the final Test later this month at The Oval to come, and was their first Test campaign triumph since they regained the Ashes last year. 

And this series win was achieved without Andrew Flintoff, the man England hope will lead them in Australia later this year, who scored 402 runs and took 24 wickets against Ricky Pontings side in 2005. 

If they can get Flintoff back and keep their bowlers fit theyve got a reasonable chance, said Woolmer. 

Australia are very difficult to beat at home but England would take a lot of positives out of these last two games, added the former England allrounder, whose side hadnt previously lost a Test series since going down 0-3 to Australia in 2004-05. 

England captain Andrew Strauss, leading the team in absence of both Flintoff (ankle) and victorious Ashes skipper Michael Vaughan (knee), said it was vital the side had enjoyed a win well before the first Test against Australia at Brisbane on November 23. 

Its very important to get back to winning ways, said the opening batsman, who scored 116 in Englands second innings. Weve played some very good cricket since the last Ashes series, but we probably havent done it as consistently as wed have liked. (AGENCIES)

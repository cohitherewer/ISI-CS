 Beating Aussies without a bonus will do for India

 - WIndies pay for over-experimentation in bizarre match

 Kuala Lumpur: Riding a 

 superb bowling performance, Team India made the West Indies 

 pay for extravagant experimentation and saved themselves 

 the arduous job of beating Australia with a bonus Friday. 

 The new ball bowlers were fast and aggressive, while MoM 

 Harbhajan Singh made the ball talk. 

It was a language the West Indians didnt understand and, after Wednesdays 16-run win at the Kinrara Oval, a straight victory over the world champions is going to suffice. An abandonment, though, will end Indias run in the DLF Cup as the Australians are ahead on points (7-6). 

The penultimate league match was bizarre: The West Indies fielded just one specialist bowler (Corey Collymore), but bowled out India for 162 inside 40 overs on a track which had moisture and did a few things. Then, despite ten batsmen (mix of specialists and allrounders), Brian Laras team managed no more than 146! 

The captain, who chose to bat at No. 9, ran out of partners. He remained unbeaten on 40, the teams top score. 

I wanted to see whether those who either hadnt played in the tournament (Runako Morton) or those who hadnt got big runs (Wavell Hinds, Marlon Samuels) could gain confidence and show responsibility... They failed... Having already made the final, we had this luxury of knowing where we stood, Lara explained in a tone which suggested he was very annoyed. 

He added: Chris (Gayle) batted at No. 6 and I came even later as I wanted the rest to get away from a situation where the usual top order got runs... How long do I continue with this (middle orders failure)? Well, till the end of the Champions Trophy as the 14 here has been retained till that tournament... If the guys dont take the opportunities, theyre going to be replaced (after the Champions Trophy)... 

Asked which of Fridays semi-finalists he would like to face in the final, Lara grinned: Thats a tricky one to answer... May the best team win... Doesnt matter, really... 

Rahul Dravid, the Indian captain, conceded that not having to beat Australia with a bonus point came as a relief. That would have put us under pressure... Todays was a 210-220 wicket and a combination of factors led to our low score bad batting, good bowling... The track did have something, but you cant expect wickets to be flat all the time... 

He expressed satisfaction with the repair work done on it over the past few days incidentally, the one with the ridge. More repairs will be done and, so, Fridays match has been shifted (by Match Referee Chris Broad) to the other track. The wicket for Sunday hasnt been decided. 

Yes, we were disappointed at the break (West Indies 34 for no loss) as we hadnt batted well, but tried to stay relaxed... Of course, we knew we had to bowl them out, Dravid added. A major concern must be the opening pairs failure to post a tidy partnership in successive matches. The captain has himself been failing. 

Then, theres the body language bit. On Wednesday, it didnt exist in the first session. There was absolutely no josh and it seemed the Indians didnt have the stomach to fight. Thankfully, that changed once the floodlights came on. Dravid justified Irfan Pathans exclusion (and Sreesanths recall) by saying: We fielded the five best bowlers... We need Irfan to contribute in two areas, but he has been struggling with his bowling... Thats not to say he wont be bowling well in, say, a months time... Munaf (Patel) and Sreesanth had a great spell after the break and, then, Ajit (Agarkar) followed it up... Later, Harbhajan did the job... 

Till the other day, Mohammed Kaif and Pathan used to be certainties. Today, both have seats on the reserves bench. And, while Munafs bowling has been improving, he has to get better on the park. Frankly, hes an embarrassment. 

Dravid, by the way, praised Harbhajans bold 37 and his 78-run partnership for the seventh wicket with maestro Sachin Tendulkar (65), the victim of a freak run out. Thats one positive from the match... Harbhajan showed he has the skills and can apply himself... Its going to be critical for us... Definitely is a good sign... 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, 

 Harbhajan said: Im pleased with my effort, but 

 weve got to beat Australia... Right now, I wouldnt 

 like to dedicate the MoM award to anybody... Clearly, 

 Jaland-hars favourite puttar is focused on 

 trapping the bigger fish. 

 Significantly, two of his three MoM awards (in ODIs) 

 have come this year.

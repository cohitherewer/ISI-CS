The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mukherjee to attend CAB meeting today

 - Why this hype, asks president Jagmohan Dalmiya 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Prasun Mukherjee has, in the past, visited the Eden Gardens in different capacities ? trip No. 1 being during the India-West Indies Test in 1978-79. 

On Sunday, he will be entering the headquarters of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) as a candidate for the top post. 

The elections, of course, are some weeks away ? Wednesdays working committee meeting is to decide on the date, which traditionally falls in the last week of July. 

Sunday, though, is going to be special as president Jagmohan Dalmiya has called an emergent meeting of the CABs affiliates to place before them chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees views conveyed through sports minister Subhas Chakraborty. 

Basically, that he (Dalmiya) shouldnt offer himself as a candidate for a post he has held for well over a decade. 

While Dalmiya backers maintain he has made a smart tactical move, those lobbying for Mukherjee are pretty incensed. 

Is Dalmiya trying to hold an election before the elections? This is not on, pointed out a confidant of the citys police commissioner. 

Whatever, no voting is on the agenda of the emergent meeting (to be held in the Conference Room of the Dr B.C.Roy Club House). 

The 121 affiliates ? 94 clubs, 18 districts, 8 universities and the Office Sports Federation ? will only get the opportunity to air their views on an unprecedented development in these parts. 

Much of the attention, obviously, is on whore going to represent the affiliates. 

Mukherjee, for example, will either be there in the Calcutta Police Club or Police Athletic Club colours. 

Having announced my candidature, Ive got to go there (CAB) at some point in time? However, my going tomorrow must not be such a big issue, Mukherjee told The Telegraph late on Saturday. 

One expects Snehashish Ganguly, elder brother of former Team India captain Sourav, to be present. 

Snehashish has taken a strong anti-Dalmiya line and, in the absence of anything to the contrary, it confirms that Sourav isnt on the same wavelength as his one-time mentor with a capital M. 

While no show of hands is on the cards, floor management is still going to be crucial. 

The Dalmiya camp is expected to rely rather heavily on one-time Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) joint-secretary Goutam Das Gupta to do the needful. 

Over the years, Dalmiya has headed the International Cricket Council, the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation, Asian Cricket Council and the BCCI. 

Its an extraordinary CV, but hes being held responsible for a number of things ? the failure to plot Souravs recall, strained relations with the Sharad Pawar-headed BCCI and more? 

As for Mukherjee, widely regarded as a highly efficient IPS officer, he has the backing of the states most powerful individual ? the chief minister. 

Whether were in for the mother of all contests, some weeks from now, may just be known in a few hours. 

Its highly unlikely, after all, that Dalmiya wont fight. 

According to his inner circle, he has let it be known he wouldnt like his innings to end at a time when detractors have forced a question mark over his integrity. 

For the moment, though, Dalmiya is simply asking: Why this hype? 

 Well, he should know.

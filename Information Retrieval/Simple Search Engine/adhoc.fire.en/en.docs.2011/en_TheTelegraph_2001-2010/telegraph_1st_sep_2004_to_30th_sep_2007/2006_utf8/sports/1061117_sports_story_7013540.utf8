 Puskas in intensive care

Budapest: Hungarian soccer great Ferenc Puskas is in a critical condition in intensive care in a Budapest hospital, a Hungarian sports daily said on Thursday. 

Puskas, 79, known affectionately in Hungary as Ocsi Bacsi[, or Our Little Brother, is suffering from pneumonia and high fever, the paper said citing information from the Puskas family. 

Kutvolgyi Hospital intensive care director Zsolt Ivanyi declined to comment and said only the family may give out news about his health. 

Puskas, who is suffering from an Alzheimer-like disease, has been in intensive care since September. 

Puskas notched up 83 goals in 84 appearances for his country, won an Olympic gold, and famously scored four goals in Real Madrids 7-3 demolition of Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final.

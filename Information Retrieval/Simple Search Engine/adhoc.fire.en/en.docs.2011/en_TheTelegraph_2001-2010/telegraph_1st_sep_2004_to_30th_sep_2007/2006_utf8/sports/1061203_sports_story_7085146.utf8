 Jeev opens up 4-shot lead 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh looks all set to win on the Japan Tour for the second successive week as a stunning hattrick of birdies helped him to open up a four-shot lead after the third round of the Golf Nippon Series JT Cup. 

The 34-year-old Indian, who won the Casio World Open last week, is looking for his fourth victory of the year. 

Jeev had five birdies and two bogeys and, towards the end, was content to play calmly rather than taking any chances. His three-under 67 gave him a three-day total of 11-under 199 and a four shot-lead over Wayne Perske (69). 

Shingo Katayama, who shared the lead with Jeev after two rounds, went two over 72 and now shares sixth place with six others at 204. 

The third co-leader at the mid-way stage, Hiroyuki Fujita (73) was three-over and slipped to tied 10th. 

Should jeev win tomorrow, he will surely make it to the top-50 in the world ranking ensuring that he becomes the first indian to gain a spot at the augusta masters. 

Having topped the ubs asian tour order of merit, jeev is also assured of a berth at the open championships. 

Jeev started with three birdies in a row, and after a bogey, added birdies at the sixth and 10th. At this stage, he was 12-under and five shots clear of the field. However, a bogey on 11th brought him back to the field. 

Right now things are going perfect and I am happy with my game, Jeev said in an understated manner. He has been playing carefully with a slightly injured wrist, which he said he would rest after the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok. 

The key is that I have got my confidence back and I am putting myself in a position to win tournaments. When that happens, win will come on their own, said Jeev, who has long been seen as the standard-bearer of Asian golf. 

Jeev has 11 top-10 finishes in 16 starts in what has been a sensational season in Japan and world-wide.

 Rain saves Central 

 - East to lodge complaint over damaged pitch 

Gwalior: East Zone bagged two points on the basis of their 115-run first innings lead as their four-day Duleep Trophy match against Central Zone ended in a draw at the Roop Singh Stadium here on Sunday. 

Damage caused to the pitch and the ground due to rains delayed the start of play this morning and later bad light forced an early end to the match. 

Central Zone, resuming at 148 for five, reached 171 for seven as only 15.2 overs could be bowled during the day. 

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly, who failed to shine with the bat, captured the wickets of Syed Abbas Ali (52) and P. Kumar (32) in the second innings. 

East Zone got two points. 

The rain-damaged pitch evoked criticism from both the teams. Central Zone skipper Jai Prakash Yadav was disappointed with the inadequate facilities to cover the pitch, while East Zones Deep Dasgupta, Souravs deputy, said they would lodge a complaint with the BCCI over the matter. (PTI)

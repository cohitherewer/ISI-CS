 Arsenal rout Rovers 6-2 

 Premier League 

London: Leaders Manchester United began their holiday fixtures with a resounding 3-0 victory at Aston Villa as the goals flowed in the Premier League on Saturday. 

A double from an inspired Cristiano Ronaldo and a thumping Paul Scholes volley, all in the second half, maintained daylight between United and champions Chelsea. 

Liverpool remained in a distant third place at the Premier Leagues halfway point, 13 points behind United, after a routine 2-0 home victory over bottom club Watford while Arsenal stayed in the last Champions League spot with a 6-2 rout of free-falling Blackburn Rovers. 

Arsenal were shocked into action after three minutes when Shabani Nonda scored a penalty, but the rampant Gunners replied three times before the break with Gilberto Silva, Alexandr Hleb and Emmanuel Adebayors penalty. Nonda scored again after the break as Rovers threatened a comeback only for Robin van Persie to end a cracking contest with a late double. 

Wayne Rooney was left on the bench for Uniteds trip to Villa Park having missed training because of a family bereavement, but his sidekick Ronaldo took centrestage.

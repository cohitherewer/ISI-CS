 Revoke ban on Azhar: Bindra

 - ICC doesnt talk about Warne, Mark Waugh and Gibbs 

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Azharuddin 

Chandigarh: Punjab Cricket Association president I.S. Bindra on Saturday lashed out at the ICC for objecting to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s invitation to Mohammed Azharuddin for a function in Mumbai on November 4. 

Azharuddin was charged with conspiring with bookmakers to fix matches and banned from playing international cricket in 2000. Bindra termed the ICC objection as adopting double-standards. 

The ICC has no business to dictate terms to us. All captains have been invited to the function. We are the only nation to have dealt with match-fixing charges severely whereas others, like Australia and South Africa, have done nothing. 

 Their players continued to play the game. In retrospect, I think we were foolish to ban Azharuddin. Herschelle Gibbs and Shane Warne are still playing now, Bindra, under whom an inquiry was set up to probe the match-fixing charges against Indian players, said. 

Bindra accused the ICC of being hypocrite. 

They dont talk about Warne, Mark Waugh and Gibbs who too are under a cloud. The ICC cannot have two standards on match-fixing. We have not socially excommunicated Azharuddin. But we have banned him from international cricket. That is severe punishment. His ban should be revoked, Bindra said.

 Surya wins

New Delhi: Mumbais young talent Prasanna Rao won accolades in round one of the Parsvnath International Open Chess Championships, for stretching hot favourite Surya Sekhar Ganguly into a long-drawn battle lasting more than four hours. 

However, Prasanna, just into his teens, lost to the national champion and highest rated Indian Grandmaster in the tournament in mere 35 moves. 

On the top board as well, young Sannidhya Narayan from Madhya Pradesh lost to top seed Alexei Fedorov of Belarus, the only GM with an Elo rating above 2600 in the event, in 46 moves. (PTI)

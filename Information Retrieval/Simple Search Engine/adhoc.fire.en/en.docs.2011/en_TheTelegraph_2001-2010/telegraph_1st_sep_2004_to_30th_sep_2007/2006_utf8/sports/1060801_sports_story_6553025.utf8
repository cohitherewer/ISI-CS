 Murali the greatest: Mahela

Colombo: Sri Lanka captain Mahela Jayawardene Monday hailed Muttiah Muralidharan as the greatest spinner after another match-winning performance in the first Test against South Africa. 

The 34-year-old spin wizard picked up a match haul of 10 for 172 as South Africa were thrashed by an innings and 153 runs to concede the lead in the two-match series. 

There is no doubt in my mind that Murali is the greatest spinner ever, said Jayawardene, who was named Man of the Match for the fourth highest Test score of 374. 

These were difficult conditions to bowl in. It was very hot and humid and the wicket was getting slower, slower and slower as the match progressed. Yet Murali bowled 64 overs in the second innings and just kept probing the batsmen. He is so hungry for wickets. 

I am certain he would have been named Man of the Match if I had not got that big score or the record stand. 

Sri Lanka had declared at 756 for 5 in their first innings with Jayawardene sharing a world record partnership of 624 with Kumar Sangakkara (287) for the third wicket. 

No matter what records had been broken it would not have mattered a great deal if we didnt get the result we wanted. We knew the South Africans were going to be tough to crack in the last two days and they fought really hard, Jayawardene said. 

Murali was exceptional, never tiring despite bowling 60-odd overs, but the quicks also stuck to their tasks well on what was a very flat pitch, said Jayawardene. The turning point was getting Ashwell Prince in the second over, which gave us a lot of breathing space. 

Jayawardene said Chaminda Vaas hamstring injury had healed sufficiently for him to play in the second and final Test starting on Friday.

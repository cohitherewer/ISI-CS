Bangalore: Indias tennis sensation Sania Mirza, pairing with Liezel Huber of South Africa, reached the doubles final of the $175,000 WTA Bangalore Open, defeating a fighting duo of Mariya Koryttseva of Ukraine and Shahar Peer of Israel 7-5, 6-7 (6-8), 6-4 on Saturday. 

After winning the first set 7-5, Sania and Liezel lost the second. 

However in the third set, Sania, with good support from her partner, outplayed their rivals in a keenly contested match that lasted for two hours and forty one minutes. 

Sania and Liezel will now clash with the Russian pair of Anastasia Rodionova and Elena Vesnina for the doubles title. 

Jelena Kostanic of Croatia on Saturday powered her way into the singles finals, quelling a late challenge by Hungarys Melinda Czink 6-0, 7-6 (7-2). 

Meanwhile, third seed Mara Santengelo of Italy set up a title clash with Kostanic in Sundays final as her opponent Vania King of the US chose to withdraw mid-way through the first set, following indisposition. 

The 24-year-old Kostanic, ranked 50 in the world and runner-up in the recent Pattya City event, did not face any resistance from Czink in the first set which she wrapped up 6-0. 

However, Czink fought back in the second set, but after both players were level at two-all, Kostanic found her touch to win the fifth and sixth games to lead 4-2. 

Czink won the sixth and eighth games to make it 4-4. 

With both players matching each other stroke for stroke, the match went into the tie-break, in which Kostanic prevailed, winning 7-6 (7-2). 

In the final, Kostanic will meet the winner of the second semi-final to be played between Vania King of the United States and Italys Mara Santangelo. (PTI)

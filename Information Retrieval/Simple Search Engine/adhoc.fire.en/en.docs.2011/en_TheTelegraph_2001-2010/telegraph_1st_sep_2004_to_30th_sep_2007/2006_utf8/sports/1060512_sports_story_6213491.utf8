 ICC hits back at Bucknor 

 - Hes a good example of why we need technology: Richardson 

 Steve Bucknor 

 London: The ICC on Thursday 

 hit back at Steve Bucknor for claiming that broadcasters 

 misused technology, saying the veteran umpire was 

 a very good example of why the game needed to rely 

 more on TV footage. 

Umpires are always defensive about their own decisions, ICCs general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson said. 

I often point to him as a very good example of why we need to give technology a go, he told a sports TV channel. 

Hes done particularly well this year. After not having a great 2005, hes averaging around 96 per cent of his decisions being correct, and yet hes made one or two decisions which have come in for terrible criticism from the media and from fans writing in to us. 

Richardson said the ICC had chosen the lesser of the two evils ? whether to risk compromising the spirit of the game or avoid umpiring controversies. 

Its kind of a lesser of two evils. We dont want to compromise the spirit of cricket and we dont want the players having little respect for the on-field umpires. On the other hand, we want to avoid umpiring controversies. 

Bucknor, international crickets most experienced match official, had claimed that inaccurate on-screen graphics and incomplete video clips had been used to make umpires look bad. 

His allegations came in the wake of the ICC Cricket Committees proposal to allow teams three appeals per innings against umpiring decisions. The proposal, if ratified by the Full ICC Board, would be tried out at the Champions Trophy in India in October-November. 

Richardson did not say whether they would ask Bucknor to provide more details of his allegations concerning the use of TV replays. ICC media and communications manager Brian Murgatroyd said extending the use of technology was an issue, which needed to be discussed and debated. From that point of view, I guess Steve has contributed to the debate, he said. (PTI)

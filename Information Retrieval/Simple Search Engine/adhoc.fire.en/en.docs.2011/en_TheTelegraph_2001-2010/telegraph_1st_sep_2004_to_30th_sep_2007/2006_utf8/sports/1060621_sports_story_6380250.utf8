 Crowd gave extra push: Klinsmann

Berlin: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann said the crowd in Berlins Olympiastadion had helped to drive his team to a 3-0 World Cup win over Ecuador on Tuesday. 

When you play at home you have the crowd behind you and that gives the players an extra push. Its World Cup fever, Klinsmann said. 

Our goal was to win the group and we achieved that. It was difficult to keep the pace up because it was hot out there but overall we are happy and looking forward to the knockout games. 

Captain Michael Ballack said Germany were riding on a wave of euphoria. 

All three games have been great fun. Playing at home is a great plus for us, Ballack said. 

We need to be at our best in the knockout stages, he added, saying he was not particularly concerned who Germany face in the next round. 

If we play at our best, we can beat England. Its not as if Sweden are a lot weaker, he said. 

Group A winners Germany will play the runners-up in Group B ? either Sweden, Trinidad and Tobago or England ? in the second round. 

Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez said his team had not been at their best. Germany played a great match but we contributed to their good display, he told reporters. It was a bit of both. 

I dont want to take away from the performance of the German team but I think we could have done better.

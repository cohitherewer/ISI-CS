 Sourav is being insulted, says Kapil

New Delhi: Kapil Dev has termed the exclusion of Sourav Ganguly from the second Test against Pakistan as an insult to the former Indian captain. He is being insulted. It is very painful, the legendary allrounder said. 

Kapil said someone who had played his heart out for the country did not deserve to be treated in such a manner. 

The player should retire gracefully, everybody knows his strengths and if one wants to lie to himself then it is his problem but I think that the player who contributes to the game should be given a respectful farewell. It is always better to resign than being sacked, he told a television channel. 

Asked what step he would have taken had he been in a similar situation, the World Cup winning captain said, maybe I would have decided to pack my bags but on the other hand another thought comes to my mind that I will bounce back with a bang and decide my own time for retirement. 

Calling for more involvement of former cricketers in the functioning of the cricket board, Kapil said, if a player who has given 20 years of his life to the game and wants to contribute to its betterment, how will he do if 99 per cent of the people who run the board are either businessmen or politicians. 

Dilip Vengsarkar, meanwhile, rallied behind the team managements decision to drop Sourav, saying there was a need to go with five specialist bowlers to push for victory. 

If India are to win, they have to play with five specialist bowlers. So one batsman had to be dropped. Unfortunately, that is Sourav, quot; Vengsarkar said in Calcutta. 

Asked whether it would not have been better to play four specialist bowlers, with Sourav as an additional pacer, he said: No. A lot was expected from the wicket. There was more grass (than in Lahore). So, they had to try something or the other. 

National selector Bhupinder Singh felt it was a strategic decision taken in view of the conditions. (AGENCIES)

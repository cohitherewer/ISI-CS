London: Tottenham Hotspur edged closer to Champions League after Egyptian striker Mido scored their winner in a thrilling 3-2 victory over Blackburn Rovers at White Hart Lane on Sunday. 

Irish striker Robbie Keane scored twice before Florent Sinama-Pongolle hauled Blackburn back into the game just before the break and Craig Bellamy drove in a 67th minute equaliser. 

Midos winner restored Tottenhams five-point lead over fifth-placed arch rivals Arsenal in the race to finish fourth ? and claim a place in the Champions League qualifiers. 

Manchester City punished bottom club Sunderland for some woeful defending, with Greek striker Georgios Samaras scoring twice inside the first 10 minutes for a 2-1 home win. 

The battle for the Champions League has become the main focus of interest in the English top-flight as Chelsea cruise towards a second consecutive league title. 

Manchester United, who have two games in hand before facing Wigan Athletic on Monday, are third on 54 points. Spurs have 49 while Arsenal, who crushed Fulham 4-0, have 44. 

Meanwhile in Primera Liga, Valencia missed the chance to reclaim second spot when they were surprisingly held 0-0 at Malaga. 

Malaga, who had lost three of their four games since Manuel Hierro took charge as coach last month, produced a gritty defensive display to keep Valencia at bay. The result means Valencia remain in third place, level on 51 points with Real Madrid who put a week of turmoil behind them with a gutsy 2-1 victory at home to Atletico Madrid on Saturday. 

Valencias slip-up allowed reigning champions Barcelona to extend their advantage at the top of the table to 10 points following their 3-2 win at home to Deportivo Coruna on Saturday. 

Valencia host Real Madrid at the Mestalla next weekend while Barcelona face a tricky away trip to Osasuna. 

Osasuna dropped off the pace and are now five points adrift of Real and Valencia in fourth place in the table after their 0-2 loss at Celta Vigo who are now hot on their heels in the race for the Champions League places. 

Brazilian striker Fernando Baiano gave the Galicians an early lead when he fired a curling shot inside the far post from the edge of the area and midfielder Fabian Canobbio added a second 19 minutes from time with a virtuoso solo goal. 

The Uruguayan gathered the ball after pushing it past two defenders, rounded the keeper and then slotted it home. 

Osasunas hopes of staging a fightback were extinguished when they were reduced to 10 men a few minutes later, midfielder Inaki Munoz pushing an opponent as they argued over a foul. 

Sevilla consolidated sixth place with a 2-1 win at home to struggling Athletic Bilbao despite being reduced to 10 men when Serbian defender Ivica Dragutinovic was sent off late in the first half. 

Malaga remain anchored to the foot of the table on 21 points, Alaves and Bilbao have 23, while Sociedad, Cadiz and Betis are all tied on 25. 

Meanwhile in Italy, AS Romas record-breaking run in Serie A was ended when a late goal by Marco Materazzi gave Inter Milan a 1-1 draw on Sunday. The result interrupted Romas sequence of 11 consecutive league wins. 

Inter are third in the table with 59 points from 28 matches, three points ahead of Fiorentina who climbed to fourth with a 2-1 win over Siena. Roma slipped to fifth on 55. (REUTERS)

 Atwal makes cut, Jeev fails

Reno (US): Daniel Chopra, with a five-under 67, moved inside the top-20 to be at tied 18th after 36 holes in the $3 million Reno Tahoe Open golf tournament. 

Also making the cut was Arjun Atwal, who, with a second round of even par 72, was one-under 143 for two rounds and came inside the cut in tied 66th place. 

However, another Indian challenger Jeev Milkha Singh missed the cut at four-over 148 with rounds of 79 and 69. 

Chopra, lying 46th after first round 71, made a huge improvement with three birdies on the back nine of the course after starting from the tenth. He had four more birdies on the front nine and also two bogeys as he finished at 67. 

Atwal had two birdies on the 13th and 18th and two bogeys on the second and 16th. 

But, Jeev had three birdies and returned a card of 69 but his first round seven-over 79 dashed all hopes as he missed the cut by five shots. 

Bob Estes led the field at 15-under after round of 64 and 65, one ahead of Will Mackenzie who had rounds of 63 and 67. 

Yusaku Miyazato had two aces within six holes during the second round. Miyazato used a four-iron on the 230-yard seventh hole and a seven-iron on the 173-yard 12th. 

He is believed to be the first player in modern PGA Tour history to make two holes-in-one during the same round. Two players have had two aces in the same event, though. Bob Tway did that at the 1994 Memorial and Glen Day in the same year at Greater Hartford Open.

 Houghton summons tall custodian

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The impressive show against Saudi Arabia notwithstanding, Bob Houghtons search for taller players continues. That explains his calling up six-foot-three goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya for the national camp prior to the Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. 

The India under-20 custodian, currently doing duty at the SAF Games in Colombo, is one of the tallest goal-tenders in the country. 

Arindam may not board the flight to Riyadh, but Houghton is believed to be extremely impressed with him. So much so that he has told his support staff that young Arindam could turn out to be an asset by next year. 

The camp in Goa begins on Thursday. The Jeddah match is scheduled for September 6. India lost the home leg 0-3 to Saudi Arabia after squandering several opportunities at the Salt Lake Stadium last week. 

THE PROBABLES 

Goalkeepers: Sandip Nandy, Subrata Pal, Subhashish Roychowdhury, Arindam Bhattacharya. Defenders: Surkumar Singh, N.S. Manju, Deepak Mondal, Samir Naik, Anupam Sarkar, Narinder Singh, N.P. Pradeep, Habibur Rehman, Jo Paul Ancheri, Sanjeev Maria. Midfielders: S. Venkatesh, Steven Dias, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Manjit Singh, Rennedy Singh, Micky Fernandes, Bibiano Fernandes. Forwards: Sushil Singh, Syed Rahim Nabi, Fredy Mascarenhas, Sunil Chhetri, Alvito DCunha, Bhaichung Bhutia.

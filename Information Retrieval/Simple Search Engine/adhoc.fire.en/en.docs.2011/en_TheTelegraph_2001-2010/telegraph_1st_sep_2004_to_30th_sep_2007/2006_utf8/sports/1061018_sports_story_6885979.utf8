 Razzaq wins it for Pak

Jaipur: Pakistan showed no signs of being ruffled by the sensational dope scandal as they kept their composure in the dying stages to snatch a thrilling four-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in a group B encounter of the Champions Trophy here on Tuesday. 

MoM Abdul Razzaq was the chief architect with four wickets and an unbeaten 38 off 24 ball. 

After restricting the islanders to 253, the Pakistanis relied on Shoaib Malik (46 not out) and Razzaq to see the team through the tense final overs for a creditable victory with 11 balls to spare at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium. 

The Pakistanis, playing their opening match just a day after their two pace spearheads Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were withdrawn from the tournament after testing positive for a banned drug, did not allow the unsavoury episode to unsettle them as they collected two full points. 

Apart from Malik and Razzaq, opener Imran Farhat (53) and Mohammed Yousuf (49) were the other notable contributors in the floodlit contest which went the whole distance unlike most of the other games in the high-profile tournament so far. 

Razzaq lifted Dilhara Fernando for a six straight over his head to bring the victory in style, sending the Pakistani dressing room into a frenzy. 

Jayasuriya set the tone for the Lankan innings with his cavalier innings which contained five fours and two sixes. 

The veteran left-hander, whose previous visit to India coincided with a bad form, was in rousing form right from the outset when he walked down the pitch to drive Rao Iftikhar Anjum to straight boundary. 

Sangakkara was another player who was in ominous form until he lofted Malik straight to long-off. 

Chaminda Vaas (15) ensured that the 250-mark was crossed before playing across the line to Razzaq. Pakistan were off to a thundering start, with Hafeez and Farhat plundering 39 runs from the first five overs before the former was caught behind to Vaas. 

The right-handed openers 22 runs came from 15 balls with three fours.

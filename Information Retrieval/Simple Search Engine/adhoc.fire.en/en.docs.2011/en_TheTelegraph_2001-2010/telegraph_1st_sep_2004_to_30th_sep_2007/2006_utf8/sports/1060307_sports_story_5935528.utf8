 Sehwag slips down in Tests, India in ODIs

Dubai: Virender Sehwag just about managed to be among the top 10 in the latest ICC Test rankings after his twin failures in Indias first Test against England. 

Sehwag was pushed down a place to be 10th in the table after he made two and zero in the two innings of the match that ended in a draw on Sunday. 

Skipper Rahul Dravid is the highest ranked Indian batsman at sixth place. 

For England, bowler Matthew Hoggard reaped the maximum benefit after he picked a total of seven wickets in the Test as he leaped six places to attain fourth spot. 

Meanwhile, New Zealands comprehensive series win over the West Indies has helped it displace India from third position in the latest ICC one-day International ratings. 

The 4-1 home victory lifted Stephen Flemings side to 113 rating points, the same as India, but they were able to pip Dravids team when calculations were made to three decimal points. 

India, who have reverted to fourth position, had moved to third place after the 4-1 series win in Pakistan. 

Australia, despite losing the first two one-dayers in South Africa, are still heading the charts with 132 points. Their hosts are second on 119 points. 

Shaun Pollock has risen to the top of both the bowlers and allrounders lists in the latest rankings. He displaced Andrew Flintoff in the latter department after taking over from Australian spearhead Glenn McGrath. (PTI)

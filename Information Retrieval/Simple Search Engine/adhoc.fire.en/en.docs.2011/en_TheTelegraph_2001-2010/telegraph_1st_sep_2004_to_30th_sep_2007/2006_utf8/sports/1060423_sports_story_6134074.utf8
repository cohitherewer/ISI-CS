The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Lewis ill, but meeting is on

 - Outgoing secretary to conduct proceedings 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Former England captain Tony Lewis is ill, but the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) is going ahead with the first meeting of its very high-profile World Cricket Committee, at Lords on Monday. 

The proceedings, however, will now be conducted by outgoing secretary Roger Knight. 

The chairman (Lewis) opted out on account of illness and, so, Mr Knight has had to step in. Theres no other change, MCC spokesperson Laura Garland told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Saturday evening, she added: Owing to the logistics involved, we havent fixed the next meeting. In fact, the Committee is going to take a decision (on Monday). Hopefully, the chairman wont have to miss that? 

Garland informed that the 15-member Committee will, among other things, consider approving research on why the white ball gets discoloured so quickly. Also, whether theres a colour-alternative for ODIs. 

As reported in these columns, Team India captain Rahul Dravid is the only one on the Committee (which includes Barry Richards, Mike Brearley, Courtney Walsh and Steve Waugh) currently doing international duty. 

He has reached London. 

The MCC, it may be noted, continues to hold the copyright for the laws. It has been in existence from 1787.

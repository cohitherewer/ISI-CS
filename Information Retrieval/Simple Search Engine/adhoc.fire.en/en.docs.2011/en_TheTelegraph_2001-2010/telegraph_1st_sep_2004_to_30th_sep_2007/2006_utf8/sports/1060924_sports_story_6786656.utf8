 Jharkhand held 1-1

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Jharkhand flattered to deceive in the Santosh Trophy at the Sector 12 Stadium here on Saturday. Leading by a goal against Uttaranchal at the half time, their performance suddenly dipped in the second session and all they could manage in the end was a 1-1 draw in the Cluster VIII match. 

In Cluster VII, Railways edged past Orissa 1-0 with Vinay scoring in the 13th minute. 

Comprising mainly of players from Tata Steel, Jharkhand looked an impressive lot in the first half and went ahead in the 21st minute through striker Budhram Soren. 

Uttaranchal equalised through Rakesh Shah.

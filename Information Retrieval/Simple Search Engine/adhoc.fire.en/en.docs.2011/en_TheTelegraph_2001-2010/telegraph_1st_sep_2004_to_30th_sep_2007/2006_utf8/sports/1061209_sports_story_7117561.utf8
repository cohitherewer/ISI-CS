 Klinsmann pulls out of race

 - Coaching USA 

 Klinsmann 

New York: Juergen Klinsmann withdrew Thursday from consideration as coach of the US soccer team after several months of talks failed to lead to an agreement. 

Bob Bradley, the coach of Major League Soccers Chivas USA team, was to be announced Friday as the interim coach of the national team, a soccer official with knowledge of the decision said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made. 

Klinsmann, who led Germany to the World Cup semi-finals last summer, was the overwhelming favourite for the US job. 

Sunil (Gulati) and I have concluded our discussions about the US mens national team program, and I have withdrawn my name from consideration as coach, Klinsmann said in a statement he e-mailed to the AP. Im not going to go into details about our conversations. But, I certainly want to wish the next coach of the US mens national team much success, and I want to, also, thank Sunil for the opportunity.

Toronto: Leander Paes and his partner Martin Damm crashed out of the doubles event of $2,45,0000 ATP Masters Series in Toronto on Saturday, losing to Paul Hanley of Australia and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe in the semi-finals. 

In a battle lasting an hour and 24 minutes, the Indo-Czech pair went down 6-3, 3-6, 4-10. The seventh seeds bagged the first set easily, breaking the Aussie-Zimbabewan pairs serve. But they squandered the lead by conceding the second set. 

In the decider, the third-seeded Hanley and Ullyett committed less mistakes and served better to thwart their rivals chances of coming back to the match. 

In the final, they will meet top seeds Bob and Mike Bryan of the US, who defeated fourth seeds Mark Knowles of the Bahamas and Daniel Nestor of Canada 6-3, 6-7 (8-6), 10-5. 

In singles play, world No. 1 Roger Federer battled his way to a 6-1, 5-7, 6-3 win over Fernando Gonzalez to reach his 17th straight final. 

Back in action for the first time since claiming his fourth consecutive Wimbledon crown, Federer was severely tested by the 15th seeded Chilean but the Swiss stood firm to stretch his winning run on North American hard courts to 53 matches. 

Standing between Federer and a 40th career title is young Frenchman Richard Gasquet, who earlier reached his second career Masters Series final with a 6-2, 7-5 victory over 19-year-old Briton Andy Murray. 

I struggled in the second and third... it was a tough match but Im happy to be through to the final, said Federer, who can match Ivan Lendls record of 18 consecutive finals set in 1981-82 next week in Cincinnati.

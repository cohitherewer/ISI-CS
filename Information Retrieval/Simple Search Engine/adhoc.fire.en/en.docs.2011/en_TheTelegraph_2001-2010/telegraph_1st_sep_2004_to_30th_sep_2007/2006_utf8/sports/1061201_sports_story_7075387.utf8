The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav has 

 to take fresh guard with an open mind 

 Guest Column 

 Arun Lal

 Im extremely happy that 

 Sourav Ganguly has finally made it to the Test squad in 

 South Africa. There have not been many takers for Souravs 

 chances, so his return to the side after a long gap highlights 

 the story of tremendous determination, dynamism and self-belief. 

 Sourav has it in him to serve 

 Indian cricket in his unique way, but mind you, this is 

 going to be an extremely tough tour for him. I dont 

 want to brood over whether he should have been in the ODI 

 squad as well because we are already 0-3 down and, to me, 

 this chapter is now over. The upcoming Test series, however, 

 will hang like a double-edged sword over him. One should 

 observe the situation from two contrasting perspectives. 

 This is a massive opportunity 

 he has been aspiring for. If Sourav gets the basics right, 

 shows the same determination which has marked his fightback, 

 and is able to generate a degree of self-assurance and boldness, 

 I firmly believe that there will be no looking back for 

 him. On the flip side, however, lies the concern that if 

 Sourav fails to deliver the goods, it may spell doom for 

 him and his desire to play in the World Cup. 

 I cant help but mentioning 

 a related line of thought here. Circumstances have played 

 a big role in Souravs return to the side. Had India 

 been 2-1 up in the ODI series, it wouldve been difficult 

 for him to make the cut. The likes of Sourav and Laxman 

 are here because the juniors have failed. Still, the future 

 is not about Sourav, Laxman or Sachin, it will be represented 

 by the Rainas who are out of form now.

 So, this is pressure with a capital 

 P. But at the same time, make no mistake that Sourav is 

 a champion and the champions are not defined by predictability. 

 They can do wonders when these are least expected, they 

 can seize the opportunity with an air of confidence and 

 rise to the occasion to hit the Doubting Thomases for a 

 six. 

 Time and again, Sourav has overcome 

 such situations with his typical character, courage and 

 confidence. Throughout his international career, he has 

 this ability to surprise people. Being a great fan of him, 

 I have been surprised by him many a time. He 

 had surprised me in Australia when he put all doubts to 

 rest with a majestic century in Brisbane. Who knows it wont 

 be the same this time around too? 

 Sourav is experienced enough take 

 on his demons within and without. Still, I like to see him 

 come to South Africa with an open, uncluttered mind. He 

 has to take a fresh guard, with no confusion around, thinking 

 that its an opportunity Ive been waiting for 

 long and I must not let it go untried. He just needs to 

 concentrate cent per cent on his game, away from those doubts 

 he must have gone through in the past few months and let 

 performance do all the talking. 

 Coming back to the ODI series, 

 it is very difficult to explain the misery the South Africans 

 are inflicting on us. I think its a combination of 

 lack of confidence among the seniors and inability to grab 

 opportunities with both hands. I cant blame the juniors, 

 because the onus is more on the senior team members and 

 they have failed to deliver the goods when they were needed. 

 Its almost bizarre to let a team come back from 76 

 for six (in Cape Town) and win the match. Had we cashed 

 in on these opportunities, the whole scenario would have 

 changed. 

 I also dont believe in law 

 of averages. To me, if you are competitive and confident 

 enough, you will win. If you are not so, its better 

 to brace up for defeats and dont look for something 

 else to make things fall in place. 

 Sourav is, thus, arriving at a 

 crucial juncture in South Africa. And like in the past, 

 the champions destiny is in his own hands.

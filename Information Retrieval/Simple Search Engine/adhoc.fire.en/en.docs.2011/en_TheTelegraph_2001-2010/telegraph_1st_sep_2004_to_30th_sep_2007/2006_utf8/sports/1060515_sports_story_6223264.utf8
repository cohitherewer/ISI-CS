 Pollock: Crucial to get Gibbs-Boje

 Champions Trophy

 Dubai: World No. 1 allrounder 

 Shaun Pollock has said it was unfortunate that off-field 

 issues were denying proven performers Herschelle Gibbs and 

 Nicky Boje from touring India which would host Champions 

 Trophy later this year.

 Pleading for the tainted duo, 

 the former South African skipper said Gibbs and Boje were 

 matchwinners and it was important that they travelled to 

 India for the Champions Trophy.

 Gibbs is in great form especially 

 after his great knock in the Wanderers against Australia. 

 He is a matchwinner for us. Boje is our most experienced 

 spinner and the conditions in the subcontinent will suit 

 him. So it is important we get them there, Pollock 

 said.

 Gibbs and Boje are required by 

 the Indian police authorities for interrogation related 

 to the match-fixing scandal of 2000 and have missed previous 

 two tours of India in the recent past.

 It is unfortunate that the 

 off-field issues are stopping them from getting to India, 

 Pollock, who was here to take part in a talk show, told 

 a newspaper.

 The South African also said the 

 wickets of a Sachin Tendulkar or a Brian Lara were always 

 special to him.

 It is always special to 

 knock out the wickets of Tendulkar or Lara, he said.

 Pollock said the key to be the 

 finest in the job lay in establishing oneself in one discipline 

 before gradually developing in other departments of the 

 game.

 Bond ruled out

Durban: Fast bowler Shane Bonds knee injury has ruled him out of the rest of New Zealands tour of South Africa. The injury also kept the bowler out of the first Test in Centurion, which South Africa won by 128 runs. 

New Zealand manager Lindsay Crocker said the decision to send Bond home was made after he failed a fitness test in Cape Town on Monday. 

He bowled for six overs yesterday (Monday), and just as he was cooling down it became obvious to him that his knee clearly wasnt right, Crocker said from Cape Town on Tuesday. 

New Zealand summoned Michael Mason as cover for Bond during the first Test, but Crocker said Masons inclusion in the team to play the second Test was not assured. 

Meanwhile, promising South African batsman of Indian origin Hashim Amla will replace Herschelle Gibbs for the second Test against New Zealand starting in Cape Town on Thursday. 

Amla was also included in the 16-member team for the first Test against New Zealand at the Centurion but was once again not picked in the final eleven. 

Amla, is almost certain to make it to the playing eleven with chairman of selection committee Haroon Lorgat saying he would bat at number three. (AGENCIES)

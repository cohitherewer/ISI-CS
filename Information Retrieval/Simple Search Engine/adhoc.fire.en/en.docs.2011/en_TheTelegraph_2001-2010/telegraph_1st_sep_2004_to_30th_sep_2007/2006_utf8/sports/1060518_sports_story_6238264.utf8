The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Salgaocar still in trouble

Margao: Salgaocar, who are in danger of relegation, wasted a penalty as they were held to a 1-1 draw by sporting Clube de Goa in the 10th ONGC National Football League, played at the Nehru Stadium here on Wednesday. 

After a barren first half, Salgaocar took the lead in the 49th minute through a penalty from Fabio Dos Passos. However, sporting fought back and equalised through Dudu Omagbemi in the 82nd minute. 

Salgaocar, who collected 12 points from 16 matches, two points behind Mohammedan Sporting, now need a win against the Calcutta outfit in their last match on Saturday to avoid relegation.

 Roe takes early lead

Barseback (Sweden): Extrovert Briton Mark Roe concluded his Scandinavian Masters second round in spectacular fashion on Friday to grab a share of an early two-shot lead with Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts. 

Roe shattered his seven-iron into three pieces while claiming the 18th hole birdie that took him alongside Colsaerts on 10-under-par 134. His seven-under 65 was only a stroke off the Barseback course record. 

Indias Jyoti Randhawa could not finish his round since play was suspended due to thunder and lightning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sohail a big Sachin fan 

 - Hockey legend doesnt want Karachi to also host a draw 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sohail Abbas 

Karachi: The iconic Sohail Abbas, who holds the world record for the most (274) goals in hockey, is a Sachin Tendulkar fan. 

When I was younger, among the Indians, I admired Sunil Gavaskar... In more recent years, Sachin has been a big favourite, Sohail told The Telegraph at the prettier-than-a-picture postcard Arabian Sea Country Club, some 35 kms from the heart of Pakistans commercial capital. 

While interacting on Friday afternoon, Sohail was disappointed hed missed Sachin by no more than minutes. Frankly, I didnt know he would be at the Club or, else, I would have come earlier, the lethal centre-forward said. 

Incidentally, Sohails father (Iftikhar Hussain) was a decent cricketer in his time. He used to bat like Shahid Afridi... Loved giving the ball a whack... Perhaps, thats why I began to hero-worship batsmen... Zaheer Abbas and Javed Miandad, besides Gavaskar, he pointed out. 

Sohail hasnt played for Pakistan since the Champions Trophy in Lahore, two years ago, but continues to turn out (as a pro) for a club in Rotterdam. Its great fun... There are two seasons of three months each and Ive been enjoying myself... 

Asked whether he regretted quitting before becoming the first in history to score 300 goals, Sohail laughed: Well, records are meant to be broken... I got past Paul Litjens and somebody will overtake me... The number doesnt matter... 

The dominance of India and Pakistan has gone and, in Sohails opinion, its because the powers-that-be arent investing enough. The more you invest, in everything, the better the results... Also, the structure needs to be run professionally... Its not that the potential isnt there, though. 

Sohail may watch the third and final Test, beginning Sunday, but doesnt want the National Stadium to also host a draw. Its such a big series... Because of the following alone, there has to be a winner, he signed off. 

Deftly, as usual.

 Randhawa slips to finish tied 3rd

 Malaysian Masters

 Randhawa

 Johor Bahru: Jyoti Randhawa 

 blew a two-shot lead with two holes to go with a bogey-bogey 

 finish and ended tied third in the $ 300,000 Pulai Springs 

 Malaysian Masters here on Sunday.

 Anton Haig, the 24-year-old South 

 African, capped a great week with a brilliant birdie-birdie 

 finish to cruise ahead for his maiden triumph on the Asian 

 Tour. He won by one shot over Scotsman Barry Hume (66) who 

 finished at 21-under.

 Randhawa had a volatile finish 

 over last five holes with one eagle, one birdie and three 

 birides, and was tied for third with Englishman Yasin Ali 

 (67) as they finished at 20-under. Hume was second.

 Gaurav Ghei (70) finished at 14-under 

 and in 13th place, while Shiv Kapur after three 68s went 

 one over 73 with four bogeys in last eight holes in the 

 final round to finish 11-under and tied 27th.

 Digvijay Singh (70) joined Kapur 

 in the tied 27th place, while Gurbaaz Mann (71) was tied 

 32nd and Arjun Singh (68) was tied 48th while S.S.P. Chowrasia 

 (75) slid down further to tied 60th.

 Randhawa seemed in command with 

 two holes to go. On the 16th he had a mighty drive and reached 

 the edge of the green of the short par-4 hole.

 From 25 feet he holed his chip 

 for an eagle and at 22-under he was suddenly two ahead of 

 Haig, Hume and Ali, all three at 20-under.

 But as Randhawa collapsed, Haig 

 made his surge. Randhawas par putt on the 17th drifted 

 to the left from about 10 feet and then faced with a par 

 putt from just four feet to force a play-off, he missed 

 it and was understandably furious with himself.

 Despite his bogey on 17th, when 

 Randhawa arrived on to the 18th tee, he was still in tied 

 lead at 21-under and the prospect of a play-off for a third 

 week in a row loomed large.

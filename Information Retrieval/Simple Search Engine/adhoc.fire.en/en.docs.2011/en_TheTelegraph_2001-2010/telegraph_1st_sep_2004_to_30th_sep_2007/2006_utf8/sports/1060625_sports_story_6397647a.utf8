 Quick Takes

 Tunisias Trabelsi ends international 

 career

 Berlin: Hatem Trabelsi, 

 Tunisias best-known player, has announced his retirement 

 from international soccer after the North Africans were 

 ousted from the World Cup. Trabelsi wants to focus on his 

 club career and spend more time with family, the Tunisian 

 soccer federation said Saturday.

 He is expected to move from Ajax Amsterdam to a new club 

 this summer. Trabelsi has been a mainstay of the Tunisian 

 team since his debut in 1998. He played in three World Cups 

 and helped Tunisia win the African Cup of Nations in 2004.

 Perrotta prefers Brazil

 Duisburg: Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta would 

 rather have faced Brazil in the second round than Mondays 

 opponents Australia, he said on Saturday.

 Personally, I would have preferred to play Brazil, 

 said Perrotta, it would have been a fascinating game 

 with all those stars on the pitch, added the Roma 

 midfielder. The Italians are wary of Australia since Hiddink 

 eliminated them at the World Cup four years ago in charge 

 of South Korea.

 They are a similar side to the US, that is true, 

 said Perrotta, But I think they are stronger in terms 

 of technique. Up front they have a very strong player in 

 Mark Viduka and then there is Harry Kewell who spins off 

 him and is also very dangerous, he said.

 Riot police step in

 Stuttgart: English and jubilant German fans, celebrating 

 after their team reached the quarter finals beating Sweden, 

 clashed in Stuttgart on Saturday before riot police moved 

 in to separate them in the city centre.

 Both groups traded punches before dozens of nervous-looking 

 riot police moved into the area, pushing the German fans 

 away and keeping the English supporters in one corner. A 

 few hundred fans were involved.

 Korean fan dies

 Seoul: A South Korean fan died of suspected heart 

 attack on Saturday while watching the country play a crucial 

 match against Switzerland at a massive, pre-dawn street 

 rally in Seoul, police said. The 25-year-old college student, 

 identified only by his surname, Kim, collapsed abruptly 

 while watching Koreas last game on large outdoor screens 

 in downtown Seoul, said an officer at the Namdaemun Police 

 Station. Kim was taken immediately to hospital, but died.

 Eye on ballots, not TV

 Rome: While most Italians will be glued to the first 

 knock-out match of their World Cup campaign on Monday, officials 

 counting votes in a national referendum have been told to 

 keep their eyes off the TV and on the ballots. Ballots close 

 at 3 pm (1300 GMT) on Monday in a referendum on constitutional 

 reforms that has held far less fascination for Italians 

 than their teams progress in Germany, and the interior 

 ministry is worried the match could delay the votes 

 result.

 Swiss goalie unbeaten

 Hanover: Switzerlands Pascal Zuberbuehler was 

 delighted to prove his critics wrong on Friday, after becoming 

 the only unbeaten goalkeeper in the World Cups opening 

 group stage. Zuberbuehler, 32, kept a third successive clean 

 sheet during Switzerlands 2-0 win over South Korea 

 to help send his team into the second round as surprise 

 Group G winners ahead of France. I dont need 

 to answer the critics, Zuberbuehler said after the 

 game. I have given my reply on the pitch.

 Play abroad, says coach

 Bad Durkheim: Coach Marcos Paqueta believes Saudi 

 Arabias players need to start playing abroad if they 

 are ever to make an impact at the World Cup. Fridays 

 0-1 defeat by Spain sealed a third first-round exit in the 

 last four tournaments, the only exception being in 1994 

 when they reached the second round. Every member of the 

 squad plays in Saudi Arabia, however, and Brazilian Paqueta 

 says that is the problem. The players are highly regarded 

 in Saudi Arabia and in Asia but they lack the experience 

 against major opponents. International experience is invaluable.

 Referees playing ball

 Neu-Isenburg: Referees are playing their part in 

 creating a free-flowing World Cup by following strict instructions 

 from Fifa on foul play. Russian referee Valentin Ivanov 

 said a glut of red cards in the tournament did not signify 

 out of control players but reflected officials clamping 

 down hard on transgressors.

 Fifa wishes to see football, not fighting, on the 

 field. That is why referees receive clear instructions, 

 not because we hate players, but because we try and protect 

 players and the game.

 Aggressive Eriksson

 Baden Baden: Sven-Goran Eriksson is finally getting 

 angry. Well, sort of. The normally mild-mannered Swedish 

 coach of the England soccer team, who rarely gets out of 

 his seat in the dugout at games, has shocked players with 

 his more aggressive style of management in Germany. The 

 aggression has been a little bit surprising, England 

 defender John Terry said. I am not talking about shouting 

 and screaming. He is never going to knock tables over and 

 scream in your face. He is not that kind of manager but 

 he has certainly been raising his voice a lot more.

 Refs are good: Moore

 Berlin: Veteran Australian defender Craig Moore has 

 a pretty good poker face but he lost it on Friday when asked 

 whether Italy may try to use their experience to suck the 

 Socceroos into retaliation or other incidents. Yeah, 

 but the referees I think have been extremely good. Im 

 sure that will be the case again, he replied.

 Strikers galore

 Berlin: Australias normally attack-minded midfielder 

 Tim Cahill has found himself playing a new role when manager 

 Guus Hiddink throws on one striker after another in search 

 of a late comeback. Against Croatia, Hiddink sent on John 

 Aloisi and Josh Kennedy to join Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell. 

 In such situations, Cahill has been asked to play defensive 

 midfielder. Its amazing, because there are five 

 in front of me and Im looking around thinking, Im 

 supposed to be up there, said Cahill

 Hiddinks successor

 Berlin: The head of Football 

 Federation Australia said the teams success at the 

 World Cup is helping drum up applicants for the coaching 

 job that Guus Hiddink is vacating after the tournament. 

 The further we go, quite reputable well-known coaches 

 are approaching us, said John ONeill, the federations 

 chief executive. ONeill wants a high-profile coach 

 to succeed Hiddink, who is leaving for Russia.

 Rooney in alleged punch-up

Manchester: England and Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney allegedly punched Blackburns Michael Gray in the face after he made offensive remarks to Rooneys fiance and other women at a restaurant. 

The incident occurred on Saturday when Rooney and fiance, Coleen McLoughlin, were having dinner with three other couples at a Manchester restaurant, British media reported on Friday.

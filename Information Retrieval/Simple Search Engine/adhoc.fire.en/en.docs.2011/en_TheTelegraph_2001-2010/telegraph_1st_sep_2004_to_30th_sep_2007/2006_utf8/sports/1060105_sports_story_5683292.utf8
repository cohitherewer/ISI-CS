 Shoaib may be too hot to handle

 - I think we can restrict Sachin: Inzy 

 Dravid handles pressure better than most batsmen, feels Inzamam 

Karachi: Ahead of the Indian teams arrival in Pakistan on Thursday for the Test and one-day series, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq sounded a warning to the visitors that they would find pacer Shoaib Akhtar too hot to handle. 

Inzamam unveiled his strategy against the top-line Indian batting, saying his bowlers needed to get opener Virender Sehwag early because he can destroy any bowling attack thereafter. He fancied his chances against Sachin Tendulkar as well and said the Pakistani bowlers can restrict him. 

However, the burly Pakistani skipper still feels that Indians are the favourites although he was pleased to hear that Pakistan was being billed as such. 

 I know the Indian batsmen have not done as well as they should have in the recent past, but we cannot ignore their track record which is of the highest class. 

It is going to be a battle between the Indian batting and Pakistan bowling. Spearheaded by a rejuvenated Shoaib, I fancy my teams chances more than the Indians but we have to remember that every Indian batsman has earned respect and recognition after performing consistently over the years, he said. 

In 2004, Shoaib was struggling and so was Mohammad Sami. Then Umar Gul broke down in Lahore. So, if you analyse our last two years, you will know that we have not played with our best fast bowlers. 

The only time we played with them was against England (late last year) and we convincingly beat them although Shabbir Ahmed had to sit out. Shoaib is probably the most improved bowler in terms of fitness, approach, attitude and discipline. He has inspired the other fast bowlers to do even better. 

If Shoaib remains fit, which I am sure he will, and maintains the same form, I think he will be too hot for the Indians to handle, Inzamam said. 

Inzamam said Indian batting was a mixture of aggression and solid defence. In Virender Sehwag, he said, the Indians had an opener who, if not dismissed early, could destroy any bowling attack like he did against Pakistan at Multan on way to scoring 309 to set up an innings victory for India. 

Sehwag likes to play his shots and if not dismissed early, he can single-handedly take the game away from you or at least, set up a platform for others to post a huge target. Its difficult to set a field against someone like Sehwag who relies more on his eye than footwork. 

I also know that the bowlers dont like to bowl to him because he picks the ball very early and punishes even the good balls. But if we bowl straight, give him little space to free his arms and contain him, we can get him early. 

He disagreed with former captains Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis that Rahul Dravid would be under pressure in the series because of the additional duties of the captain. 

People call him The Wall simply because he handles pressure better than most of the batsmen. Yes, captaincy adds responsibilities but if a batsman has performed in crunch situations and alone steered his team to victories or rescued them from complete disaster, not once but time and again, then pressure is nothing new to him. 

Inzamam was also full of respect for Sachin, but fancied his chances against the champion batsman who missed most of last year with tennis elbow. 

He broke the record for the most centuries. But he did not look like the Sachin we know. He was also struggling against us last year and then in 2004, we picked him well after he scored 194 in the first Test. It can be a dangerous prediction but I think we can restrict Sachin in this series as well. 

Inzamam was a trifle worried about the weather playing a spoilsport. 

If the weather doesnt improve, I fear that the first two Tests might not provide the excitement we are anticipating. And then, all will boil down to Karachi Test that will decide the series. It would be cruel to both the teams if that happens because in a high profile series like this, you want to play all the three Tests. 

Fog, rains and freezing weather in Lahore have badly affected the two Patrons Trophy first-class matches that could not start on Tuesday even after two days. (PTI)

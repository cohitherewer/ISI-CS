 Scandal in Italy solidifying team 

 Grosso

Duisburg: Italian football has never been short on drama and frequently touches the extremes of brilliance and degradation but Tuesdays events crammed all facets of calcio into a few hours of intense emotion. 

Within the space of 12 hours, four top clubs were threatened with relegation for match-fixing, the coach of the countrys top club Juventus resigned and then Italy produced an outstanding performance to beat hosts Germany 2-0 at the World Cup and book a place in Sundays final. 

I dont think even we believed wed get this far, but now weve got a chance to give a dream to the Italian people, said Italy striker Luca Toni. 

The start of the day in Rome had been anything but dreamy, but it ended on a high in Dortmnund with goals in the last two minutes of extra-time by Fabio Grosso and Alessandro del Piero. 

The drama began in a room in the capitals Olympic stadium where the prosecutor in the match-fixing trial, Stefano Palazzi, demanded that four of Italys top clubs be demoted for their role in a scandal which has shaken the foundations of Italian soccer. 

Palazzi said he wanted champions Juventus to be relegated to the third division and six-times European champions AC Milan along with former Italian title winners Fiorentina and Lazio thrown out of the top flight Serie A. 

Shortly after Palazzi announced his demands, Juventus coach Fabio Capello jumped ship, handing in his resignation to club officials in Turin. The man who guided Juventus to two titles they may now be stripped of took over as Real Madrid manager on Wednesday. 

Its clear, however, that the corruption scandal is actually helping the Azzurri boost team spirit. All 23 players on Italys roster are based in Italy and Lippi coached several of them in his eight seasons in charge of Juventus before taking over the national team two years ago. 

Buffon, Zambrotta, Del Piero and Camoranesi, I coached them at Juve, coach Marcello Lippi said on Wednesday. And Cannavaro I coached at Napoli way back in 92. How well I know these guys and how well they know me is a big factor. We never even discussed it. We spoke about completely different things. This is a very strong group that is focused on one objective. Were not getting distracted. 

Yes, the confusion of the past two months has given us all the desire to respond in an appropriate way, Lippi added. Its brought this group of guys together. We wanted to show what Italian soccer really means. Anything that goes on outside the group at this point doesnt have even the most minimal impact. 

Lippi was called by prosecutors for questioning before the World Cup over alleged pressure he faced to select certain players for Italys team. The coach is not under investigation, but his son Davide Lippi is, for his role as a player agency. 

Captain Fabio Cannavaro has also been connected to the scandal, with reports suggesting he allegedly played poorly on purpose to hasten his transfer to Juventus two years ago, a suggestion he has strongly denied. 

Some critics called for both Lippi and Cannavaro to resign before the World Cup. Lippi was asked if he and his captain were out to make a statement to their critics. 

Right now our only emotion is joy. Lets not get into those polemics, the coach said. (Agencies)

 Uefa keeps Milan waiting

 Inter awarded Serie A title 

Milan: Inter Milan were 

 declared Serie A champions on Wednesday after a sports tribunal 

 stripped Juventus of the title in Italys match fixing-scandal. 

 The Italian soccer federation said the title was assigned 

 to Inter because they were the highest ranking team in the 

 standings which had not been punished in the case (briefly 

 reported in Thursdays Late City edition).

 Inter finished third in the 2005-2006 

 season, behind Juventus and AC Milan.

 Juventus were relegated to Serie 

 B and stripped of the top-flight title, while AC Milan were 

 docked 30 points for the past season. An appeals court Tuesday 

 also upheld a decision by a lower sports court to strip 

 Juventus of the 2004-2005 league title. That title will 

 remain vacant, the soccer federation said.

 Despite the final appeals rulings 

 in the case, Juventus, Lazio and Fiorentina say they will 

 continue to fight the penalties they received.

 Juventus plan to go to court to 

 contest their relegation. We absolutely cannot accept 

 this sentence, Juventus president Giovanni Cobolli 

 Gigli said. We will pursue our appeal through all 

 possible courts. As long as justice has not been served, 

 I can make assurances that we will never stop.

 AC Milan were reinstated to the 

 Champions League and had their point penalty for next 

 season reduced from 15 to 8. 

 However, Uefa has delayed a decision 

 until next week on whether to allow Milan to participate 

 in this seasons Champions League.

 European soccers governing 

 body will make a decision by next Wednesday, August 2, Uefa 

 said after a meeting of it emergency panel on Thursday. 

 The draw for the third qualifying round takes place on Friday 

 and Milan will be included on a provisional basis, Uefa 

 said.

 As far as the position of 

 AC Milan is concerned, the Panel took note of a report submitted 

 by the Uefa Chief Disciplinary Inspector on the question 

 whether it would be appropriate, due to the particular circumstances, 

 to admit AC Milan to the 2006-07 Uefa club competitions, 

 Uefa said in a statement.

 Following this report, the 

 Emergency Panel has decided to further examine whether to 

 admit AC Milan to the 2006-07 UEFA club competitions. (Agencies)

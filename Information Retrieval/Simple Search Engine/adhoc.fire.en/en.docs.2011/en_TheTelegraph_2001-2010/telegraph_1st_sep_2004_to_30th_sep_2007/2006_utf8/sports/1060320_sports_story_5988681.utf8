 Powell eases into 100m semis

Melbourne: Asafa Powell, the fastest man on earth, eased into the 100m semi-finals, but it was two marathon runners who really brought the Commonwealth Games to life on Sunday. 

On an extraordinary day when the Commonwealths sporting axis was tipped upside down, Englishman Simon Burnett took out the blue-riband swimming event and cyclist Mark Cavendish provided the Isle of Man with their first gold medal in 20 years. 

Scotland also won another gold in the pool, their fourth in as many days, as well as winning the team sprint at the velodrome, while a South African who was at the centre of a bizarre doping case last year, won the womens javelin. 

Australia won five of the 21 gold medals decided on Sunday to raise their four day total to 28. England also won five to lift their total to 13 and open up a gap over third-placed India, whose lone shooting gold took them up to eight. 

The Scots two golds raised their total to six, one ahead of South Africa and two in front of Canada, who each won two golds as well on Sunday. 

Isle of Man, Tanzania, Wales and Ghana all collected their first gold medals of the Games on Sunday. 

Powell, the world record holder, hardly broke out of a jog as he sailed through his second heat in 10.29 seconds, raising the prospect of a sub-10 second run in the final. 

But Powells superb performance was overshadowed by a slow-motion sprint-finish to the womens marathon, which brought the MCG crowd to its feet. 

Australian Kerryn McCann and Hellen Cherono of Kenya entered the stadium together after the lead had changed nine times over the closing stages of a lung-busting finale. 

Both runners were near exhaustion but were forced to sprint the last few hundred metres with McCann, a 38-year-old mother of two, kicking clear on the final bend to win in a little over two and a half hours. 

Cherono finished two seconds behind and Englands Liz Yelling took the bronze in 2:32:19. 

Half an hour later Tanzanian Samson Ramadhani entered the stadium first after fighting off a series of challenges from Kenyan Fred Mogaka to win his first major title in the mens marathon in 2:11.29. 

Mogaka finished 34 seconds behind Ramadhani to take the silver medal, with Englands Daniel Robinson claiming bronze in 2:14:50. 

In the pool, Burnett unleashed an extraordinary finishing burst to win the 100m freestyle in of 48.57, beating the South African pair of Ryk Neethling and Roland Schoeman in a blanket finish. 

England won a second gold in the pool when Rebecca Cooke successfully defended her 800m title, while Scotlands David Carry won his second in four days after adding the 400m individual medley to the 400m freestyle. 

World champion Jessicah Schipper led all the way in the womens 100m butterfly to give Australias women their eighth gold in the pool, while cyclist Katie Mactier won gold for the hosts in the individual pursuit. 

Cavendish pulled off a surprise win in the 20km scratch race to join road race cyclist Peter Buckley (Kingston, 1966) and shooter Nigel Kelly (Edinburgh, 1986) as the Isle of Mans only Commonwealth gold medallists. 

England chalked up another three golds on the shooting range while Canada won the womens solo and duet events in synchronised swimming. 

Weightlifter Michaela Breeze gave Wales their first gold of the Games in the womens 63kg category. 

In hockey, Olympic mens champions Australia routed Canada 5-1, while Pakistan escaped with a 1-1 draw against South Africa. (Agencies)

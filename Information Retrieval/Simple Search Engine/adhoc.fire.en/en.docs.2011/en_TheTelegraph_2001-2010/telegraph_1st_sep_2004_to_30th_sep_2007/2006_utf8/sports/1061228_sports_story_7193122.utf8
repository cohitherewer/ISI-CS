Calcutta: Mohun Bagan ultimately had the last laugh after a gruelling semi-final encounter against Dempo Sports Club and set up Saturdays Peerless Federation Cup title-clash with Sporting Clube de Goa. The only surviving team from the city edged past Dempo 7-6 in the tie-breaker after the match ended 2-2 following regulation and extra times at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

The peerless Bhaichung Bhutia who has turned the fate of many battles on his own again was the saviour for Mohun Bagan, scoring a brace in the second-half. Ranti Martins put the Goans ahead in the 27th minute, then Bhaichung restored parity in the 57th. Roberto Silva Beto handed Dempo the lead second time in the 75th minute. But the India captain was at it again as he equalised three minutes from time. 

With the way Mohun Bagan started, it looked that they will crush anyone who comes in the way, but the forwards really found it difficult to get past the wall, created by Climax Lawrence, John Dias, Samir Naik. 

Ranti, who was looking dangerous during his 62-minute stay in the pitch, drew the first blood quite against the run of play. Samir Naik overlapping down the left sent a cross to him, who chest-trapped the ball to deceive Sanjeev Maria completely and took a prompt left-footer. Sangram Mukherjee had been only left watching the ball go in through the far post. 

Mohun Bagan upped their tempo thereafter and thronged the Dempo defence on several occasions, but in vain. The forwards failed to penetrate the area in a concrete way. 

After lemon break, the green-and-maroons were more focussed and got the desired breakthrough within 12 minutes. Lalkamal Bhowmick, rated one of the best talents, floated the ball for Bhaichung to come up with a spot-on header. 

Jut after Mohun Bagans first-time equaliser, a free-for-all involving players of both teams occurred in the 62nd minute, when the Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto was felled by Beto. The match was held up for about 10 minutes before the referee K. Shankar sent off Ranti and PC Lalawmpuia, who replaced Gautam Debnath before the start of the second session. 

Mohun Bagan defenders were never looking very compact and allowed the Goans to take lead once again in the 75th minute. Naik, pretending to take the long-ranger, pushed the ball for Beto, who didnt miss the target. 

But as it is said cometh the hour cometh the man Bhaichung, who was uncertain for the match due to an injury, produced another flash of brilliance. Dharamjit Singhs free-kick from right was flicked by Eduardo Coelho, but Dempo custodian Satish Kumar fumbled to claim it. Bhachung lurking inside the six-yard box pushed the ball in, forcing the match to the extra-time and then shootout. 

In the tie-breaker, Barreto, Fabio Cortez Vidal, Lalkamal, Dulal Biswas and Dharamjit were on target while Dipendu Biswas missed the target. For the Goanese outfit, Beto, Climax, Valeriano Rebello and Nascimento Silveira netted but Joaquim Abranches and Jerry Zirsangha failed to convert their spot-kicks.

Bangalore: Making up for her disappointing early exit in the singles, Indias Sania Mirza on Sunday emerged the doubles champion partnering South Africas Liezel Huber at the WTA Bangalore Open. 

The Indo-South African pair, seeded second, was in total control throughout the match and won it 6-3, 6-3 against the Russian duo of Elena Vesnina and Anastassia Rodionova. 

In the singles, the 19-year-old Indian, the biggest draw at the event, was shocked in the second round by Frances Camille Pin 

Meanwhile, Italian Mara Santengelo staged a remarkable rally to beat Jelena Kostanic of Croatia and claimed her maiden WTA singles title. Santengelo, the world No. 59 and third seeded here, fought back from a set down to notch a 3-6, 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 win. 

I am very happy, said the 24-year-old Italian, who reached the third round at the Australian Open this year. 

After appearing out-of-sorts in the first set, Santengelo forced a tie-breaker in the second and then, in the decider, seemed a transformed player, raising her game and gaining in confidence in no small measure. 

The Italian collected a winners cheque of $28,000 and 120 points, while Kostanic, the world No. 50 and sixth seeded here, also aged 24, walked away with $14,650 and 85 points. (PTI)

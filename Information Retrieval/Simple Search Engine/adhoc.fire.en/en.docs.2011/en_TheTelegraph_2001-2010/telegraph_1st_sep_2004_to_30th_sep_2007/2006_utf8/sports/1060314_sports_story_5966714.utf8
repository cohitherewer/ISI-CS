 Chopra slips, finishes 13th

Palm Beach: Daniel Chopra once again suffered from the final round blues, as he shot a four-over 76 and slipped from tied fourth to 13th in the $ 5.5m Honda Classic. 

Four bogeys on the front nine and another two on tenth and 11th saw Chopra squander Saturdays advantage and was at six-over at that stage. 

Chopra, who for the second week in row faltered in the final round, then hit two birdies on the 12th and 17th which saved him from further fall. 

Meanwhile Luke Donald grabbed the title by shots over Geoff Ogilvy. It was his second PGA Tour win. Donald used back-to-back birdies midway through his back nine to take the outright lead at 11-under, made a great scrambling par on the difficult 16th to preserve the margin and beat Ogilvy to take the title. 

A 3-under 69 was good enough for the Englishman, who took home a winners check of $ 990,000. A perfect approach shot to within four feet on the 18th set up his final birdie and sealed his win. 

Donalds only other tour win was at the 2002 Southern Farm Bureau Classic. 

David Toms shot a 69 to finish at 9 under, three shots off the pace and tied with Mayfair (72).

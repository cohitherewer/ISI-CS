The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The Moment out to prove a point 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Robin Corners ward, Capture The Moment, is out to prove a point on Wednesday that his last run against Aleksei was no fluke. On that occasion he had stretched Aleksei an easy winner even in his subsequent start.

 In the Aloritz Cup over 1,400m, Capture The Moment takes on Retained Asset, the Daniel David-trainee who is improving with each run but nowhere near Alekseis Class.

 The Treasure Land Cup, an 1,100m scurry, may see a close contest between El Cid, Karans Choice, Anokato and Immaculate. Karans Choice is expected to come good. Last time out, the H.S. Bath-trainee found Regal Empress a hard nut to crack. However, early in the season she had won handsomely. She is blessed with speed and aged horses like Anokato, El Cid and Immaculate may not pose problems for her.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

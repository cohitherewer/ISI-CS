 Colts whitewash Pakistan 4-0

Karachi: Ravindra Jadeja missed a century by a whisker but his superb 94 helped the India Under-19 team to a thumping four-wicket win against Pakistan in the fourth and final one-dayer at the Gaddafi here. 

Off-spinner Sumeet Sharma was the wrecker-in-chief taking 5 for 36 to end the tour on a high. The victory helped the visitors clean sweep the hosts 4-0 in their own backyard. Chasing 192, Indians started on a slightly shaky note as they lost openers Pervez Aziz, for a duck, and Sunny Sohil, for 12. But Jadeja, who was adjudged Man of the Match, batted with flair and responsibility.

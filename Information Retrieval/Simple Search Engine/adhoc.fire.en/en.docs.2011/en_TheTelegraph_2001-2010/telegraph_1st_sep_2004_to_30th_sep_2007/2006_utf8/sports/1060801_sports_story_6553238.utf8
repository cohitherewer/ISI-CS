 CAB ready to negotiate

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The much-hyped elections over, its time for the CAB to get down to business. 

The associations officials are planning to sit on the negotiating table with the BCCI with regard to its sanctions on grants. However, at the same time, they have made it clear that absence of BCCI grants wont cripple CAB financially and they are not too concerned about it. 

Even if the BCCI continues their sanctions on grants, weve enough sustenance to fall back on and can survive for at least seven years. But well soon sit with the BCCI and sort it out, Goutam Das Gupta, former BCCI joint secretary and a member of the CABs Board of Trustees, said on Monday. 

The grants basically come in the form of TV rights and featuring in domestic matches and they cant prevent it arbitrarily from reaching an association, he added. 

He admitted that lack of good grounds was affecting local cricket. All these talk of setting up stadiums are academic in nature. Even the concept of a cricket academy is also not feasible keeping in mind our culture, which doesnt permit an out-and-out preference of sport over education. Instead, what we need is good grounds with pavilions, he maintained. 

Das Gupta, however, refused to term the close margin of win in the presidents post (61-56) as a wake-up call. 

There is not going to be a massive shake-up in our approach to our administration, said Das Gupta.

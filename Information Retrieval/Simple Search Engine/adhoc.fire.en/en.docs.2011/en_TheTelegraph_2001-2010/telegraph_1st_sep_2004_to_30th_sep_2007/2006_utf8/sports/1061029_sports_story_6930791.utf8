 Humpy stuns Karpov

Cap Dagde (France): Grandmaster Koneru Humpy scored a memorable win against former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia in the third round of the Cap Dagde Intrenational Rapid Chess tournament here. 

It took just 24 moves for Humpy to down the former Numero Uno in the group B match. Karpov sensed trouble right from the beginning of the queens gambit accepted game and found Humpys precision too hot to handle. 

As things stand in the group B after the third round, Andrei Volokitin of Ukraine is in sole lead on 2.5 points while Humpy stands joint second on two points along with Zhao Xue of China and Magnus Carlsen of Norway. Four more rounds remain in this section. 

If Humpy was at here technical best, worlds youngest Grandmaster Parimarjan Negi was in his true fighting spirit as he played out a chanceless draw with Radjabov, the highest rated player of this event. 

Parimarjan, who is in the group A, inched to two points out of a possible four and is in with a chance for making it to the last four. (PTI)

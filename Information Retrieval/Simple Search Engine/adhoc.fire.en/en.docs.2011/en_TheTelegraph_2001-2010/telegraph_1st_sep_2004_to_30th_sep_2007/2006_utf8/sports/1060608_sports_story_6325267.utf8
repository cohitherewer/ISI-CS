 Shoaib still on Bari agenda

Karachi: Pakistan chief selector Wasim Bari has said he would once more discuss Shoaib Akhtars injury status with the coach and captain before Thursdays team selection for the tour of England. 

Ive already met Inzamam and Woolmer to take their inputs over the selection, but recent developments have made it necessary for us to meet again, said Bari. 

It is certainly the most difficult decision that the selection committee will have to take when it meets in Lahore on Thursday. 

I would want to take their point of views on the issue before our committee meets, Bari was quoted as saying by a daily newspaper.

 Saudis out to erase 2002 humiliation

 - Tunisia will be without leading striker Santos 

Munich: Fear of defeat and an early World Cup exit has dominated the mood of Tunisia and Saudi Arabia ahead of Wednesdays Arabic derby in group H. 

Tunisias French coach Roger Lemerre, may uniquely have won successive continental championships in Europe and Africa but, after overseeing holders Frances first-round exit at the 2002 finals, hopes to erase bad memories of the global tournament. Saudi Arabia, in their fourth consecutive World Cup, also want to wipe out a nightmare ? they were thrashed 0-8 by Germany in their first outing at the 2002 finals in Japan and departed without scoring a goal. 

So it is no surprise that Lemerre, 65 this month, and his Saudi counterpart, Brazilian Marcos Paqueta, are approaching the tense clash at the Allianz Arena with some trepidation. 

This is going to be the most important and the most difficult match for us, said Tunisias highly-rated attacking right-back Hatem Trabelsi, who is seeking a move from Ajax Amsterdam after the finals. And it is also a derby! 

I think both teams have a chance to win because both want a good start to the group. We are in our third consecutive finals and it is our aim to reach the second round this time. 

Tunisia are the only African nation with previous experience at the finals. After losing on penalties to Nigeria in this years Nations Cup quarter finals, Trabelsi said the 2004 African champions must learn to avoid costly errors. 

Tunisia will be without leading striker, Brazilian-born Francileudo dos Santos, top scorer in the qualifiers with six goals, and have made two injury-enforced changes to their squad. 

Their preferred 4-4-2 formation is likely to find midfield space at a premium against Saudi Arabias 4-5-1, intricate approach work and dangerous counter-attacking. 

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia keeper Mohamed Al Deayea, who holds the world record for international caps, will make way for Mabrouk Zaid on Wednesday, coach Marcos Paqueta said on Tuesday. 

Mabrouk Zaid will be in goal and there is no mystery, we will play a 4-4-2 system, the Brazilian said. 

Al Deayea, who has played in all three of the Saudis previous World Cup campaigns and has 181 caps, was recalled to the squad this year after Zaid had a string of injuries. 

However, Paqueta has opted for the younger Zaid, who was nominated for the 2005 Asia Player of the Year award. He said his team does not face any injuries and was ready to beat a Tunisian team known for its speed and marking.

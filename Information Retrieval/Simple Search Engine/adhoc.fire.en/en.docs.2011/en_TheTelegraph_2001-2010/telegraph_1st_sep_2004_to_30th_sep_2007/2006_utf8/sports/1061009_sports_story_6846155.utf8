 Miandad slams PCB 

Karachi: Former captain Javed Miandad on Sunday expressed dismay at the state of turmoil in Pakistan cricket, saying the way the game was being run has to change. 

The legendary batsman said recent incidents have proved that the relationship between the PCB and players was breaking down. 

I cant understand what has been happening. Its the lack of fear of the PCB and selectors. The board has encouraged indiscipline and players have little respect for their superiors, Miandad said. 

Miandad urged new PCB chief, Dr Nasim Ashraf, to take drastic measures. For posterity we will have to purge the dirt and make the base and board strong. 

Why did the board tolerate indiscipline? Australians did not tolerate Shane Warnes indiscipline even though he is so important to them. (AFP)

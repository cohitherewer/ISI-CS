The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAO, not CEO because of...

 - Prof. Shettys appointment 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Prof. Shetty 

Calcutta: A technicality came in the way or else the Mumbai-based Prof. Ratnakar Shetty would have been Indian crickets first Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Instead, earlier this week, the Board appointed him as its first Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the technicality centered around an International Cricket Council stipulation that only Board presidents (or an alternate) and CEOs are to attend its meetings. Traditionally, the Board secretary attends those meant for CEOs and a problem would surely have arisen had Prof. Shetty been given that designation. 

In our structure, the Board secretary is very powerful and appointing a CEO would have encouraged a conflict. Therefore, it was decided that Prof. Shetty be the CAO, explained one of the well-placed sources, during a chat Saturday. 

Prof. Shetty, who had been functioning as the acting executive secretary in-charge and is a former joint-secretary of the Board, has been given a five-year contract. A former Team India manager, hes planning to take two years leave from Mumbais Wilson College, where he teaches chemistry. 

The contract is for a much longer period, but Prof. Shetty probably wants to see how it goes (over the first two years), somebody close to him pointed out. The gentleman added: He doesnt have to give up the Mumbai Cricket Association treasurers post as thats an honorary one... 

Besides being familiar with the Board officials, Prof. Shettys advantage is that hes on excellent terms with the India players. Not just because he has been a manager more than once, but because he had a role in the introduction of central contracts, two years ago. 

Had the 55-year-old Prof. Shetty not been a pro, he wouldnt have been given important assignments both by Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sha-rad Pawar. Incidentally, he has become Indian crickets first paid official at the highest level.

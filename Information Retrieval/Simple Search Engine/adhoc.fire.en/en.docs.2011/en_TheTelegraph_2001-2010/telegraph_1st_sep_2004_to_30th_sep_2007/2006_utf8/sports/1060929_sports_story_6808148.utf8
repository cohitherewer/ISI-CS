 Talukdar qualifies for Mexico finals

New Delhi: Jayanta Talukdar booked a berth for the Archery World Cup finals to be held in Mexico despite bowing out in the preliminary round of the individual mens recurve event at the Shanghai World Cup on Thursday. 

Talukdar will be accompanied by top two archers Ilario di Buo of Italy and Kyung Mo Park of Korea and also Magnus Petersson of Sweden, ranked fourth, at the grand finale. 

The Indian, who had finished ninth in the elimination round on Wednesday, defeated Eduardo Magana of Mexico in the first round but fumbled against ace archer Di Buo, who also beat Petersson on his way to winning the bronze medal. 

The Indian, who had entered the contest as world No. 2, however, saw his rankings dip one place to three. 

Mangal Singh was the only other Indian to cross the first round hurdle.

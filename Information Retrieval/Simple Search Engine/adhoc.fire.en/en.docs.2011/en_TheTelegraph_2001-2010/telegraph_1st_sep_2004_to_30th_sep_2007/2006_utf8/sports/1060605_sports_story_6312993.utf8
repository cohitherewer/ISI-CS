 Quick Takes

 Fifa to adopt 2-year doping bans

 Munich: Fifa will adopt 

 minimum two-year suspensions for doping offences, while 

 allowing national associations to reduce the bans for mitigating 

 circumstances. Fifa executive committee member Chuck Blazer 

 said on Sunday his organisation is compliant on paper 

 with World Anti-Doping Agencys guidelines. WADA has 

 pressured Fifa to strengthen its penalties for doping.

 In principle, we agree to 

 the two-year suspensions, which in some cases could be more 

 or could be less, Blazer said. We still maintain 

 individual case management.

 The recommendation from Fifas 

 executive committee on Sunday must be adopted later this 

 week by the Fifa Congress. 

 Iran president may visit 

 team

 Friedrichshafen: Iranian 

 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad may visit the national team 

 during the World Cup, the head of Irans soccer association 

 said on Sunday as the squad arrived to a colourful and boisterous 

 welcome here. We met the president yesterday (on Saturday)..., 

 said Mohammad Dadgan, president of Irans association. 

 He said if he has time he could come to Germany. 

 Lehmann plans long innings

 London: Arsenal keeper 

 Jens Lehmann is planning to continue his international career 

 beyond the World Cup after insisting he feels like 

 a 26-year-old. The veteran stopper, 36, is entering 

 his first tournament as Germanys No. 1 goalkeeper 

 and he claims that he is in top shape and could go on for 

 years. 

 Asked whether the national team 

 remained in his plans after the World Cup, he told Frankfurt 

 newspaper: Yes. I love football. It makes a lot of 

 fun. And I am fit. (Perhaps I feel) like 26. And I am much 

 fitter than when I was 30 years old. 

 Heinze fit

 Herzogenaurach (Germany): 

 Argentina defender Gabriel Heinze says he has won his battle 

 to be fit for the World Cup. He is a virtual certainty in

 against Ivory Coast on June 10. 

 Viduka on future

 London: Middlesbrough and 

 Australia striker Mark Viduka has revealed he is considering 

 retiring from international football after the World Cup. 

 Viduka has said a combination of family reasons and concerns 

 over frequent long-distance travel could prompt him to quit 

 the Socceroos later this year.

 Belgrade: Serbia-Montenegro 

 striker Mateja Kezman was injured Saturday during preparations 

 for the World Cup. The Serbs main striker suffered 

 a knee injury. It is evident that Kezman will have

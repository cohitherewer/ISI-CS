 Souravs place is in middle-order: Rameez

 - Opening this time has been different, says Team India captain Rahul Dravid 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Team India coach Greg Chappell has 

announced that the opening combination is going to be reviewed on a match-by-match 

basis, but Rameez Raja feels continuing with Rahul Dravid as Virender Sehwags 

partner would be a good idea. 

I wasnt quite sure about the move, early on, but its better opening with the captain rather than Sourav (Ganguly), as was initially intended, Rameez, a former Pakistan captain and opener, told The Telegraph. 

Opening together for the first time, Dravid and the vice-captain have put on 145 without being separated. Given the circumstances, its fantastic. Dravids score (37 not out) is his highest as an opener and, after eight innings, has featured in a century stand. 

Speaking exclusively at the Pearl Continental, on Sunday evening, Dravid said each innings was a fresh challenge and, so, he wouldnt compare his effort here with any previous occasion that he opened. All I wish to say is that, yes, this time has been different... 

Returning to Rameez, interacting during one of the interruptions at the Gaddafi, he added: Dravids technique is excellent, but he has the mentality of a No. 3. While its true that the one-down batsman can be required on the very second ball, the mentality of a regular opener is different. Moreover, theres the element of risk ... 

I mean, if the No. 3 is moved up, the balance may get upset as the one-down position has to be for somebody absolutely solid ... I understand Sachin Tendulkar will bat at No. 3, which is fine ... I would have had reservations if (V.V.S.) Laxman was slotted there. 

According to Rameez, Souravs place is in the middle-order and his presence gives it a boost. Opening in a Test isnt the same as doing that job in ODIs ... Then, till he got dropped, Sourav wasnt even regularly opening in the shorter game ... Doing so here could have hastened the end of his career ... 

One cant, after all, become a Test opener in the 34th year and Dravid did the right thing by shouldering that responsibility. He made a statement: Telling teammates that, as captain, he was providing them cover and, now, they had to deliver in the role assigned to them. 

In Rameezs view, the ongoing series could actually bring the best out of Sourav. Having made a comeback, I expect hes out to prove many points ... One big innings is going to silence critics and I guess hes waiting to get that. I dont put it beyond Sourav to make an impression in the three Tests... 

However, Rameez also observed that if Sourav didnt contribute, he should call it a day. He has had a terrific innings, but must realise he cant be a passenger. If he doesnt score, he has to quit. 

For now, the jury will be out till Karachi.

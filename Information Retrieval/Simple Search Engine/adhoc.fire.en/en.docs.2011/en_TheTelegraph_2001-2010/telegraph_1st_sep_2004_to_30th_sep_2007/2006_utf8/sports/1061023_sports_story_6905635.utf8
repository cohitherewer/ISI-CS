 Waqar keeps faith in bowlers

Chandigarh: Pakistans bowling coach Waqar Younis said on Sunday that his depleted bowling attack had the firepower to deliver the goods in the rest of the Champions Trophy matches. According to Waqar, he had asked his bowlers to concentrate more on bowling the right line than anything else. 

We have seen so far that the wickets are behaving slow and turning and teams are thinking in terms of playing more spinners. Our effort will be that our bowlers should bowl a controlled line, Waqar said when asked about his teams strategy for the games against New Zealand and South Africa to be played in Mohali. 

The former bowling great also expressed confidence in his bowlers Abdul Razzaq and Rana Naved-ul Hasan delivering the goods in the absence of key pacemen Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif. 

Waqar admitted though that Naveds confidence had been shaken somewhat after the outing against Sri Lanka. But the team had been backing him to help him find his rhythm, he said. (PTI)

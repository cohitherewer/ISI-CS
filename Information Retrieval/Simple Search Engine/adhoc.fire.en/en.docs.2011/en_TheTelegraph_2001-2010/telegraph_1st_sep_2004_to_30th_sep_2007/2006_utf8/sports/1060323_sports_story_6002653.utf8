Melbourne: Pistol shooter Samresh Jung was on the fast track to become a part of Indias sporting folklore as he scooped up his fifth gold, while weightlifter Geeta Rani provided fresh sparkle to the nations campaign at the 18th Commonwealth Games here on Wednesday. 

Jung scripted a new Games record in mens 10m air pistol, as shooters and lifters garnered a gold and silver each with two more bronze medals coming from the ranges on another productive day. India thus held on to the third position on the leaderboard with a haul of 16 gold, 11 silver and seven bronze, though Canada appeared to be closing in after climbing up to the fourth spot in the chart. 

Jung, who also has a silver against his name, is already the highest medal winner at the ongoing Games as he remained on course to become the most prolific gold-getter in any particular edition of the mega event if and when he achieves his target of seven yellow metals. 

Celebrated Australian swimmers Ian Thorpe and Susie Neil hold the record of six gold medals apiece in past Games. 

 The Indian marksman fired a record 584 in the qualification and 101.4 in the final round to aggregate 685.4 points, eclipsing the previous mark of 679.9 credited to Mick Gault of England in Kuala Lumpur in 1998. 

Bringing more joy back home, Vivek Singh picked up the air pistol silver, while Sanjeev Rajput and Manavjit Singh Sandhu earned bronze in mens 50 m rifle prone event and trap, respectively. 

The lifting arena remained a happy hunting ground for India, as Geeta Rani and Simple Kaur Bumrah made a series of record lifts to grab the gold and silver medals in +75kg. 

Geeta Rani set a new Games record with an overall lift of 241kg, which included 104kg in snatch and 137kg in clean and jerk, en route to winning Indias third gold in the discipline. With a medal count of 3-5-1, India finished on top in the event. Simple was just 1kg adrift of her compatriot for the second place finish after hoisting 240kg with a record lift of 105kg in snatch and 135kg in clean and jerk. 

India are assured of five more medals, with three pugilists ? Jitender Kumar, Akhil Kumar and Vijender ? romping into the flyweight, bantamweight and welterweight category semi-finals, respectively, in a discipline where both the losing semi-finalists are awarded bronze. 

Heavyweight Harpreet Singh and super-heavyweight competitor V. Johnson reached the pre-summit round on Tuesday. 

The day was blighted, however, with the mens hockey team failing to progress to the semi-finals despite beating South Africa 2-0 in their final league encounter. 

In the games showpiece track and field, Indias star athlete Anju Bobby George reached the final on her third attempt with a leap of 6.41metres. 

Though the world No.5 did not clear the qualification mark of 6.50m, she made it to the medal round as one of the 12 best performers. 

In womens 800m, Pinki Pramanik sneaked into the semi-final, clocking 2:05.18 seconds, but the three heptathlon girls ? J.J. Shobha, Soma Biswas and Sushmita Singha Roy ? failed to impress at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 

The shuttlers also had a good day. Fourth seed Chetan Anand and national champion Anup Sridhar advanced to the pre-quarterfinals of the mens singles. 

In the womens section, seasoned Aparna Popat, teenage talent Saina Nehwal and Trupti Murgunde also made it to the last 16. Last editions bronze medallist Popat clinched a facile 21-13, 21-12 win over Julia Wong of Malaysia to advance to the pre-quarter finals of the womens singles. 

Sixteen-year-old Saina, who has already upset the top two seeds in the mixed team event, had no problems against Thilini Jayasinghe of Sri Lanka. Saina stormed into the round of 16 with a convincing 21-7, 21-11 win. In another match, Trupti Murgunde trounced Alissa Dean 21-2, 21-8. (PTI)

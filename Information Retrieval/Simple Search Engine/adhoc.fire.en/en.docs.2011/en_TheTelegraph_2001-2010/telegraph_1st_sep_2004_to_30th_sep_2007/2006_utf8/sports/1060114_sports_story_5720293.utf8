 Gough left out of ODI squad

 - TOUR OF INDIA 

 Goughs career now looks over 

London: Michael Vaughan, Ashley Giles, Kevin Pietersen and Simon Jones have all recovered from injury to be named in Englands squads for next months tour of India. 

However, the England and Wales Cricket Board on Friday left fast bowler Darren Gough out of the one-day squad, which may prompt his international retirement. 

Vaughan had an operation on his right knee, spinner Giles had surgery on his hip and Pietersen sustained a rib injury before Christmas. Jones has just returned to cricket after surgery on an ankle injury that forced him out of the final Ashes Test last September. 

Jones has been training in Adelaide and will travel to India on January 26 to continue his recuperation. 

Spinner Shaun Udal ? a 36-year-old who earned his first call-up in 10 years on the tour to Pakistan ? was named alongside Giles in the Test squad. A third spinner will be named before England leaves on February 12. 

England dropped James Anderson and Alex Loudon from the Test squad that toured Pakistan. Anderson remains in the one-day squad.

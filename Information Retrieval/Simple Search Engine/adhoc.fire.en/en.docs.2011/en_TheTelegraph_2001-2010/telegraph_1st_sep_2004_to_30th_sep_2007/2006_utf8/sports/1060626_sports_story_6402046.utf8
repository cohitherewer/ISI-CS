The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Day III highlights

 The 11 sixes hit by the West Indian batsmen equals their 

 best for the most sixes hit in a Test innings, which came 

 also against India in Delhi in 1974-75 

 The unbeaten 97 was Shivnarine Chanderpauls fourth 

 score in the Nineties. Incidentally, this was the second 

 time in his career he was left stranded in the Nineties. 

 He had made an identical score against England at Lords 

 in 2004 

 Marlon Samuels (on 70) became the 45th West Indian batsman 

 to aggregate 1000 runs in Tests. Playing in his 22nd Test 

 match, he now has 1017 runs 

 Harbhajan Singhs 5/147 was his 18th five-plus wicket 

 hauls in 56 Tests. However, it was his only third such haul 

 away from home. His previous efforts came way back in 2002 

 ? 5/138 at Kingston and 5/115 at The Oval against the West 

 Indies and England, respectively. 

 Meanwhile, the unlucky Anil Kumble went wicketless for the 

 22nd time in his career, and for the only fourth time went 

 without a wicket, while conceding over 100 runs. His 0/140 

 (in 47 overs) was his second worst Test performance after 

 the 0/159 (in 46 overs) against Pakistan in Bangalore in 

 2004-05 

 This was only the second time in their Test history, five 

 West Indian batsmen have made 80-plus scores in the same 

 innings. The team had earlier achieved this against England 

 at The Oval in 1995 

 The home teams 581 is now the highest score at this 

 ground obliterating the 503/8 declared by Leeward Islands 

 against Trinidad and Tobago in 1985-86 

 The catch of Virender Sehwag was Brian Laras 153rd, 

 which takes him past the tally of New Zealands Stephen 

 Fleming and places him in the No. 4 position among fielders 

 with most catches. Lara later added one more to his tally 

 and now has 154 catches. Only Australians Mark Waugh (181), 

 Mark Taylor (157) and Allan Border (156) have more catches 

 in Tests

 Double loss for Sania

Montreal: Sania Mirza and Marta Domachowska of Poland went down in the womens doubles first round of the $134,000 Rogers Cup tennis tournament in Montreal. 

The Indo-Polish pair lost 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 to Tathiana Garbin of Italy and Meilen Tu of America in the Tier I WTA event on Tuesday. 

Sania, who lost in the first round of singles to Italys Albertya Bianti 2-6, 6-1, 6-2, and Marta squandered a good start and Tathiana and Meilen were quick to capitalise and rally from behind to seal the match. 

The Indo-Polish pair wasted three break points and their serve also let them down as Tathiana and Meilen broke them thrice to take the match into the third set. 

Meanwhile, Swiss seventh seed Martina Hingis advanced to the third round of the $ 1.34m WTA hardcourt tournament with a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) triumph over Italys Mara Santangelo. 

Hingis rallied from a 1-4 deficit in the second set on Tuesday to book a date with the winner between US qualifier Jamea Jackson of Slovakia and 11th seed Daniela Hantuchova. 

Third seed Nadia Petrova will play fellow-russian Anna Chakvetadze in the second round. Chakvetadze ousted another Russian, Vera Dushevina 7-5, 6-3. 

Hingis was among the eight top seeds with a first-round bye, a group that also included top seed Kim Clijsters. 

Clijsters will face Stephanie Dubois in the second round after the Canadian wild card defeated Italian lucky loser Tathiana Garbin 6-4, 6-4. (AGENCIES)

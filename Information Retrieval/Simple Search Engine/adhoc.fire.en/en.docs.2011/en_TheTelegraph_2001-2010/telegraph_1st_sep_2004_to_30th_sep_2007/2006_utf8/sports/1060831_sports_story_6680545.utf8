The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Soma focuses on 3-way battle

 - Doha Asian Games Qualifiers

A STAFF REPORTER

 Soma Biswas in Calcutta on Wednesday 

Calcutta: Competing with a stablemate is nothing new to veteran heptathlete Soma Biswas. She has been doing it ever since Sushmita Singha Roy shot into prominence a couple of years ago. 

The two most celebrated of Kuntal Roys wards will again be locking horns Thursday afternoon, in the 100m hurdles at the 56th State Athletics Championships. But their bigger examination will be in October-November, when the squad for the Doha Asian Games takes final shape. 

It was about a year ago that Soma and Sushmita finished 1-2 at the Asian Track amp; Field Championships. An encore by the two Bengal athletes on a bigger stage, in Doha, would be a dream. But they first have to make sure both qualify for the Asian Games-bound squad. 

India will be allowed no more than two entries in heptathlon, but with the experienced J.J. Shobha also throwing her hat into the ring, one of the trio will have to miss out. 

Since only two of us will be able to compete, I first have to ensure I qualify, Soma told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the state meet being held at the Salt Lake Stadium and SAI complex. The qualifying mark for the Doha Games is 5800 points. 

The athletes will get two chances to attain the qualification level the Open Nationals in Jamshedpur in October and the Inter-State Championships in Chennai in November. 

I wont mind missing out even after tallying 5800-5900, but it will hurt if I fail to qualify by managing a low total like 5200-5300, said Soma, who has hinted at retirement after the Asian Games. 

Having had no chance to test herself at a competition after the Commonwealth Games five months ago, Soma is treating the state meet which is hardly important for her as an extension of her training. Ive entered a couple of events, so Ill know where I stand. 

The coach is a little worried about both of them qualifying. If they do make the cut, there is every chance of them getting medals in Doha, said Roy. 

Yoga is part of both womens preparation. They have been doing pranayam for nearly two months, it helps improve concentration, the coach said, adding that Sushmita is prone to losing focus at times. 

Soma is aggressive and determined. Im targeting 6000 points for both, they are capable of doing it, said Roy.

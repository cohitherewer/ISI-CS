 Rutherford critical 

 STAR RACER

 Rutherford

Calcutta: City jockey Rutherford 

 Alford is critical after a nasty fall from his ride, Strong 

 Rumours, in the Guindy Plate at the Bangalore races on Sunday. 

 In the same race, jockeys S.Babu and Vijay Kumar also came 

 a cropper but they escaped with minor injuries.

 Ruther has suffered a spinal injury. He has been moved to a Bangalore hospital. I have spoken to the attending doctor who informed that Ruthers lower parts are paralysed, said Richard, father of the jockey.

 Richard and his wife, Geraldine, have already left for the Garden City by an evening flight. Rutherford, who had shifted to Hyderabad three years ago after completing his apprenticeship in RCTC, has been doing reasonably well in the southern circuit.

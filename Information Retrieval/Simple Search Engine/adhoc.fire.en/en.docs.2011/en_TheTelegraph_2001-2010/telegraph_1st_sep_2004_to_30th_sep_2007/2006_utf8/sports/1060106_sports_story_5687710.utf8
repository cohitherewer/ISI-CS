 Sehwag will be the key: Vengsarkar

Mumbai: Former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar on Thursday said India were well equipped to take on traditional rivals Pakistan in the upcoming series that begins from Saturday, and added that Virender Sehwag would be the key batsman during the tour. 

The only threat to India would be Shoaib Akhtar if he bends his arm, said Vengsarkar while speaking to the press at a function here. 

Vengsarkar said the Indian team had the batsmen as well as the bowlers to match Pakistan even on pitches that are fast and meant to help the home bowlers. 

India certainly have a chance (of winning the series) and I think Sehwag will be the key, Vengsarkar said. 

He is an exciting batsman and if he manages to get over Shoaib and give India a good start with a big innings it would make the difference. 

Sehwag was in brilliant form on the last tour and hopefully he should carry that this time too. It is going to be a very exciting series and though I would hate to predict the final outcome, I would like to believe that India have a good chance, suggested Vengsarkar. 

We should do well with four fast bowlers, and with Irfan Pathan in-form and Zaheer Khan looking fit, the Indian team looks good.

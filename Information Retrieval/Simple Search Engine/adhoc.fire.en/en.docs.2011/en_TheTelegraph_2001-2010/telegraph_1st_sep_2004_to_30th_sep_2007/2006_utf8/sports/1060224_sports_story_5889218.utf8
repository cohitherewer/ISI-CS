The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 When Chappell was livid...

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: In time, Sourav Gangulys biggest 

 regret may well be that he spurned the olive branch extended 

 by Greg Chappell some five months ago.

 Specifically, on the evening of September 27 ? soon 

 after the so-called patch-up brokered by the Board of Control 

 for Cricket in India, in Mumbai. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources, Chappell invited Sourav (then still the Team India 

 captain) for a one-on-one to clear misgivings which arose 

 on the controversial tour of Zimbabwe. 

Sourav, it seems, said he couldnt do so straightaway as he intended taking an evening flight back to Calcutta. 

Chappell felt offended and became absolutely livid on learning that Sourav changed plans, but still didnt bother to call him. 

Both were at the Taj. 

Only two people ? Sourav and I ? should have been talking that evening? Instead, he chose to brief friends in the Media? an incensed Chappell is understood to have told somebody close to him. 

Apparently, that one incident took the Chappell-Sourav relationship beyond repair. From the coachs side, at least. 

Meanwhile, chief selector Kiran Mores wholly personal agenda got exposed yet again when he exploded at the Media conference in Vadodara. 

 Somebody needs to tick him off. Quickly, too.

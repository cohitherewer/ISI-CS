 Ultimatum for McGrath

Sydney: Selectors have delivered Glenn McGrath an ultimatum to play a lead-up match if he is to be considered for Australias Test series next month in South Africa, the cricketer said on Monday. 

I think in another week or two they (selectors) will look at selecting the Test tour, McGrath said. It makes it a lot more difficult to have to play a match before the team selection, which cuts down my time by quite a lot. 

Meanwhile, Ricky Ponting said he will be allowed to use his illegal graphite-backed bat in the ODIs in South Africa.

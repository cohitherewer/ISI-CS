 England werent confident 

 Ricardo 

Marienfeld: Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo said he could sense from looking at the England players that they were going to miss during the penalty shootout which settled Saturdays World Cup quarter final. 

Ricardo saved a record three penalties as Portugal won 3-1 in the shootout following a goalless draw to reach the semi-finals for the first time since 1966. 

Weve trained a lot on penalties and I could see by looking at the eyes of the English players that they did not feel confident about scoring, he told reporters on Sunday. 

I tried to make the goal shrink in their eyes, he added. I wanted to prolong their suffering. 

I felt at that moment that I could save at least one or two penalties. (Captain Luis) Figo said he was certain I would save two and I went one better. 

Ricardo, who was also the hero when Portugal beat England on penalties in their European Championship quarter final two years ago, said he was ready to take a penalty for his side just as he did on the previous occasion.

Bangalore: Unseeded Frenchwoman Camille Pin beat top seed and home favourite Sania Mirza 1-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the second round of the Bangalore Open on Wednesday. 

The 19-year-old Mirza, who became the first Indian to win a WTA title at the same event last year, led 6-1, 5-3 before a string of errors and a clever change of tactics from Pin saw her collapse. 

Sania, the world No. 38, staved off five match points in the eighth game of the decider before sending a backhand wide to hand victory to her opponent. 

Sania won the first set easily as everything appeared to go her way but midway through the second set, she lost her rhythm allowing her opponent, who is 110th in the world, to claw back. 

A wrong line call that went against the Hyderbadi girl did not help matters and the Frenchwoman staged a remarkable rally from 3-5 to win the second set as she grew in confidence and put Sania on the backfoot. 

In the final set, the Frenchwoman played her heart out and dominated proceedings as Sania failed to raise her game. I knew the game was never finished even when I was down 1-6, 3-5 and I took it point by point, Pin said later. 

I tried to do something she doesnt like and I kept doing it, she said, referring to her tactic of repeatedly lobbing to keep Mirza pegged to the baseline. 

Meanwhile, the player who was drawn to meet Sania in the final was also eliminated as second seed Shahar Peer of Israel, fresh from her Pattaya City title triumph last week, was shocked 4-6, 2-6 by Italys Maria Elena Camerin in a first-round match. 

Camerin, world No. 92 and unseeded here, staged a remarkable recovery after being down 0-2 in the first set. The second set totally belonged to the Italian who tightened her grip over the proceedings. 

Peer, world No. 36 and former world junior No. 1, showed signs of tiredness in the second set as Camerin, after poor starts in both sets, got her act together. 

Hungarys Melinda Czink also advanced to the last eight with a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Ukraines Mariya Koryttseva. 

Sixth seeded Jelena Kostanic of Croatia beat Daniela Kix of Austria 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 to move into the second round. 

Unseeded Alona Bondarenko and Vania King also booked quarter final berths. Ukranian Bondarenko, world No 126, breezed past Anastassia Rodionova of Russia, who is ten places above her in the rankings, 6-2, 6-1, while American King (140) whipped Nicole Pratt of Australia (127) 6-0, 6-1.

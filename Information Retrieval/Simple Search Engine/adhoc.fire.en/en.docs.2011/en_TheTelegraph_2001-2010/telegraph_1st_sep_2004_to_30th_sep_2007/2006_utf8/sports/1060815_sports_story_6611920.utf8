 Dementieva lifts crown

Carson: Third seed Elena Dementieva wore down Jelena Jankovic 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 to win the Los Angeles Open on Sunday. 

Im working every day for these moments. I hope this momentum keeps going forever, the 25-year-old Russian told reporters after clinching her maiden title on US hardcourts. 

The 21-year-old Jankovic, who upset seven-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams in the semi-finals, briefly turned the match around after losing the opening set. 

She used her powerful backhand to great effect to help take the second set but she grew tired early in the third and took a medical timeout at 0-3 down for heat sickness. 

After falling behind 0-5, Jankovic fought back gamely to 5-4, frequently rushing the net and knocking off volley winners. But Dementieva finally shut Jankovic down when she broke the Serbian in the final game and won the two-and-a-half hour match with a forehand crosscourt winner, celebrating her second title of the year with a leap into the air. 

Shes very unpredictable, Dementieva said, who upset top seed Maria Sharapova in the semis.

 Nesta out of final as well

Duisburg: Italy defender Alessandro Nesta has been ruled out of Sundays World Cup final against France in Berlin through injury. 

Hes definitely not available, Enrico Castellacci, Italys team doctor, said on Thursday. 

Nesta has not played since the last group game against Czech Republic when he picked up a groin injury which forced him to sit out the second-round match against Australia, the quarter final with Ukraine and Tuesdays semi-final win over Germany. 

Marco Materazzi, who started against Germany, is again expected to partner captain Fabio Cannavaro in the centre of an Italian defence which has conceded just one goal in the tournament. 

Milan defender Nesta has suffered injury setbacks in all three of the World Cups in which he has played ? he missed Italys second round defeat to South Korea four years ago and was also injured for the quarter final exit to France in 1998. 

Meanwhile, Miroslav Kloses hopes of clinching the award for top goalscorer could be hit by injury. 

Klose has scored five times for beaten semi-finalists Germany, giving him a two-goal lead over teammate Lukas Podolski and Frances Thierry Henry, who will play in Sundays final. 

A goal in Germanys game against Portugal in Stuttgart would make all but certain of the golden shoe award for Klose but the 28-year-old said on Thursday he was a doubt for the match. 

I have pain in the calf muscle, Klose said. Well have to see how it is on match day. I do want to play but if it makes no sense Ill sit the game out. 

Germany defender Per Mertesacker will definitely miss the match. He will undergo surgery on his injured foot this week, the German Football Association said. 

Germany central defender Per Mertesacker will miss the third-place match against Portugal on Saturday after surgery on his left heel.

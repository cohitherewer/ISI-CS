 4-man panel to probe Lara

Port of Spain: The West Indies captain Brian Lara faces a probe for his stinging outburst at selection policies and pitch conditions during the recent Test series against India. 

A four-member committee headed by WICB president Ken Gordon would investigate Laras comments after India won their first Test series in the Caribbean in 35 years with a victory in the final match in Jamaica. 

The other members of the panel are Sir Alister McIntyre, former West Indies skipper Clive Lloyd and Gregory Shillingford. The board considered at length the recent statements and actions of Mr Brian Lara during and after the conclusion of the fourth Test match versus India at Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica, WICB said in a statement. 

It was agreed to appoint a committee headed by the president of the WICB, together with Sir Alister Mc Intyre and Messrs Clive Lloyd and Gregory Shillingford to investigate all matters relating to Mr Laras statements and to take such action as they may consider appropriate after discussion. 

Since Lara is currently away from the Caribbean, it is expected that the committee will meet him within the next two weeks, it added. 

Lara was retained as skipper only this week after the board bowed down to his demand that the selection panel be overhauled. After the series deciding defeat at Sabina Park, Lara had flayed the cricket authorities in the Caribbean and even threatened to reconsider captaincy. 

However later, Lara was retained as captain and changes made in the selection panel.

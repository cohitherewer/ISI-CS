Colombo: Off-spinner Muttiah Muralidharan claimed six wickets to help Sri Lanka ease to an innings and 153-run victory over South Africa on the fifth and final after-noon of the first Test on Monday. 

The South Africans resumed the day on 311 for four hoping to save the game, but Muralidharan took the key wickets of Ashwell Prince (61) and Herschelle Gibbs (18) in the morning and then helped polish off the tail after lunch. 

The 34-year-old had figures of six for 131 in the second innings on way to claiming his 17th ten-wicket match haul of his career ? 10 for 172 from 82.2 overs. 

South Africa were finally bowled out on the docile Sinhalese Sports Club Ground pitch for 434 after 157.2 overs of determined resistance. 

Four South Africans scored second-innings fifties, but the visitors paid the penalty after being bowled out for a paltry 169 on the first day and some record-breaking batting by the hosts in their response. 

Wicket keeper Mark Boucher led the visitors rearguard on the final day with a positive 85 from 160 balls before chipping back a return catch to left-arm spinner Sanath Jayasuriya shortly after lunch. 

Muralidharan needed just six deliveries in the morning to strike as Prince, surprised by some extra bounce, edged low to Mahela Jayawardene standing at slip. 

South Africas stand-in captain in the absence of the injured Graeme Smith, Prince added just one run to his overnight score, finishing with 61 from 182 deliveries. 

Gibbs (18), batting down the order after a viral infection forced him off the field during Sri Lankas marathon first-innings, added 38 with Boucher before patting a return catch back to Muralidharan off a low full toss. 

Sri Lankas bowlers pressed hard for further inroads and there were several strong appeals against both Boucher and Nicky Boje. 

Boucher was also dropped by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene after a thin leg-side glance off Muralidharan just before lunch. 

However, Sri Lanka broke through soon after the break with Boucher left furious following a sudden lapse of concentration against Jayasuriya. 

Muralidharan proved too good for the tailenders as first Andre Nel was bowled for a duck by a sharp-turning off break and then Dale Steyn was bowled through the gate for four. 

Makhaya Ntini (16) clubbed a six and a four before being bowled by Lasith Malinga to seal Sri Lankas victory. 

Boje finished on 33 not out after 130 balls. 

The second Test of the two-match series will be played at the P. Sara Oval, also in Colombo, from August 4.

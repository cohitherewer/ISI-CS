 Sehwag backs Kaif, himself

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Virender Sehwag at a press conference in Guwahati on Saturday 

Guwahati: Virender Sehwag believes additional responsibility of leading the side will not come in the way of his returning to form. At the press conferenKce here on Saturday, the stand-in captain was confidence personified. 

Backing himself as well as Kaif for the remaining three matches of the one-day series, Sehwag said: Kaif has won a lot of matches for us. It is just that he is passing through a lean phase. Besides a good batsman, he is also a good fielder. He is of great value to the team. He is trying hard and it is just a matter of one innings to turn things around. It is the same with me, too. 

 Sehwag said he got good starts in Faridabad and Delhi and just needed to convert them into big scores. Then I will regain my confidence, he added. 

Citing that form is temporary and class permanent, Sehwag even cited Sachin Tendulkars example. Sachin is a great player but he also does not score always. One has to understand this. 

The stand-in captain said that the team was motivated enough to do well as it was taking the remaining three matches as a new series. We are hoping to win this one too, he said. 

England stayed away from the pre-match conference.

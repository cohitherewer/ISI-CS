 Sharath Kamal up to No. 131

New Delhi: Achanta Sharath Kamals gold winning performance at the Commonwealth Games propelled him to his best-ever world ranking of 131 in singles in the latest table tennis rankings. 

Sharath has a total of 1356 points that saw him move up 21 places. 

I was expecting this jump but I thought I would get close to 120 because I beat some higher ranked players in Melbourne, Sharath said.

 Bring Cup for me: Sandeep

Chandigarh: Sandeep Singh, recuperating from a freak bullet injury, wants teammates to bring home the World Cup for his sake. 

Though I am feeling sad for not being a part of the unit, I am confident they will bring the Cup for me and for millions of our countrymen, the 21-year-old drag flicker said here on Saturday. 

They can do it. I have been praying for them, said Sandeep even as elder brother Bikramjit helped him do some exercises. 

On whether the cash incentive of Rs 1 crore for winning the 12-nation tournament in Germany would act as a boost, he said, its a good thing. They will surely deserve it if they return with the Cup 

Sandeep, who was kept in the ICU for over a week before being shifted to a private ward, said there has been great improvement in his overall condition. 

The pain in my legs have lessened. The doctors have been taking due care. (PTI)

 France must not let Italy dictate pace

What a topsy-turvy World Cup this has turned out to be! How many of you, dear readers, had imagined a month ago that Italy and France would battle for the ultimate honour? Who could have predicted that neither Brazil nor Argentina would feature in the semi-finals? Did anyone have an inkling that the worlds best player Ronaldinho would be such a mega flop in Germany? 

Its a matter of hours before the winning captain holds aloft the most coveted trophy in Berlin. Will it be Zidane or Cannavaro? 

Going by the teams semi-final performance, one would be tempted to back Italy. Going by the quality they produced against Germany, they are two goals superior to the French. But this arithmetic is not so simple, the most straightforward calculation can go haywire in a high-stake game like the World Cup final. And the way this tournament has unfolded, it wont be wise to write off the French, especially since this game will bring the curtains down on several distinguished careers. 

What will France have to do to quell the Italian challenge? If I was in Domenechs shoes, the first thing I would tell my team is to deny Italians the whirlwind pace they thrived on against Germany. No way can the French match that speed, neither can they afford to play an open game for the entire duration. So I would advise Thuram, Makelele and Zidane to set their own pace and vary it according to the need of the hour. 

Domenech must impress on his players that playing a beautiful game is not the priority. If they manage to get a goal in the opening session, like they did in the semi-final, they should abandon flair and aggression and play percentage football to defend the lead. France looked very ordinary in the second half against Portugal, but so what, they got the desired result. 

The Italian defence has played true to tradition, conceding just an own goal in six games. But the French rearline has been no less impressive, having successfully blunted the threats of Spain, Brazil and Portugal. If Zidane can conjure some more magic to score or set up an early goal, the likes of Thuram, Sagnol and Makelele have the skill to deny Italy an equaliser. 

The French will do well to keep an eye on four players: Totti has to be blocked, Pirlo has to be restricted as much as possible to the Italian half and the forays of side-backs Grosso-Zambrotta must be checked. If needed, Henry has to fall back and help his mates. 

Looking at things through the Italian coachs eyes, I would urge the players to operate at a furious pace and stretch the two wings. Remember, Italys 11 goals in the tournament so far have come from 10 different players. So everyone is capable of coming up and scoring. That positive mindset shouldnt change. 

Even a kid knows who conducts the French orchestra. Obviously, Zidane has to be denied his rhythm. I would employ Gattuso to keep a close watch on Zidane, but this 34-year-old is a wily fox who can make his own free space. So he will require zonal marking as well. 

 My advice to those trying to stop Zidane would be not to stick to his body, and force him to play the ball square and diagonally rather than forward. 

Zidane is dangerous from dead-ball situations, so Italy should not concede free-kicks 30-35 metres from their goal, at any angle. 

Another person Italy have to watch out for is Vieira. He has played the role of a roving medio well and moved into scoring positions too. The Italians must not allow him a free passage into their penalty box. 

The French could be found wanting in energy and stamina, so Lippi should instruct his players to make the opposition run and run. The Italians should not despair if they cant score. If the match goes into extra-time, the Azzurri will have the edge over their more exhausted rivals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mushtaq to assist Woolmer 

 - Leg-spinner open to long-term offer from PCB 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mushtaq Ahmed 

 Lahore: Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed will be the 

 assistant coach during the Test and ODI series against 

 India. Mushtaq, it may be recalled, was bowling consultant 

 in the recent ODIs versus England.

 His appointment, as Bob 

 Woolmers assistant, is confirmed, a well-placed 

 Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) source told The Telegraph 

 on Sunday evening. 

Apparently, Woolmer is himself very comfortable with Mushtaq and has been impressed with the positive vibes he generates. Plus, the leggie is fluent in English and can help him communicate with those players who have a problem understanding that language. 

Speaking exclusively, Mushtaq said he would consider ending his contract with Sussex (which runs till 2007) if the PCB makes a long-term offer. Thats possible, but Ive got to know where I stand in the long term, he remarked. 

 Incidentally, Mushtaq is on excellent terms with captain 

 Inzamam-ul Haq.

Calcutta: A few days ago, during an informal meeting with club officials, East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva had wanted to know what kind of passion football on the Maidan generates. Sipping juice, he then sat down to watch video clippings of arch-rivals Mohun Bagan, pen and notebook in hand. 

Being a veteran from Brazil, Pereira is not alien to such El Classicos. He has had such experiences in Rio de Janeiro, Qatar, Tunisia during his globe-trotting career. No wonder the 60-year-old looked so calm on the eve of the ultimate contest in Indian football the biggest challenge for any coach. 

Pressure? What pressure? Ive been in these situations so many times that I know how to cope with it, was Pereiras simple answer. 

Fact of the matter is that even as the coach projects a cool exterior, his brain must be working overtime to find the right strategy which will help earn his team a convincing win against an opposition which is struggling to find its feet. 

If form is the yardstick, East Bengal will start as strong favourites. Their juggernaut is rolling on: four wins in four matches, eight goals scored, none conceded. 

Mohun Bagans title-defence, on the contrary, has been thrown into disarray ever since they lost the opener 0-1 to Calcutta Port Trust. Five points from five games does present a sorry picture. 

However, a derby like this one cant always be assessed by mere figures. Simply because form goes out of the window and nerve takes centrestage. It allows no excuse like the oft-heard so-and-so-are-not-available refrain neither does it make any allowance for fatigue. 

Its time to deliver and the beleaguered Biswajit Bhattacharya is hoping for a swing in fortune. This is a do-or-die match and when your team is in trouble, you will think nothing but a win to get out of the situation, the Mohun Bagan coach said after practice on Friday. 

He admitted that victory on Saturday is desideratum because this is what the team needs to turn things around. 

Biswajit is drawing confidence from the fact that for the first time in the season, he had the full squad at his disposal, barring, of course, the injured Jose Ramirez Barreto. 

Ive no problem with my attack, but some holes in the backline need to be plugged. However, the positive thing is having all the players available. This is a huge confidence-booster, he said. 

Brazilian Eduardo Coelhos presence in defence is a big plus for the team, while Nigerian Ndem Guy Herve who played for East Bengal last season could be a different man on the Salt Lake Stadium turf, compared to his lacklustre debut in green-and-maroon colours against Railway FC at the mud-spattered Barasat stadium. 

Bhaichung Bhutia gave the media the slip after morning practice, perhaps not wanting his concentration to be disturbed, but he has largely been off-colour after switching allegiance from East Bengal. 

Pereira hinted at zonal marking for the striker, but its time to deliver for the India captain as well. 

Biswajit acknowledged Pereiras contribution. Pereira has successfully injected doses of Brazilian style into the team. They are in fine nick now... they are in a particular rhythm, but Im confident that my team is capable of disturbing it. 

Pereira, however, refused to attach the favourites tag to his team. In the Rio de Janeiro league, my team was firm favourites and needed only a win to claim the title, ahead of a match against our local rivals. We lost and had to wait for the last match. A good beginning doesnt allow you to be complacent, he warned. 

This is wisdom, earned not by reflection or imitation, but by the bitterest of experiences. Pereira revealed he would stick to the 4-4-2 formation with Ashim Biswas and Freddy Mascarenhas up front. 

With Alvito DCunha out due to injury, Dipankar Roy will once again don the role of play-maker. 

Pereira, incidentally, was full praise for Ashim, and even compared him with Brazilian legend Romario for his agility and hidden speed inside the box. 

Ive scored for Mohun Bagan against East Bengal. Hopefully, Ill score again in a big game, in a different jersey, East Bengals Romario said before leaving the club tent. 

 Well, the Maidan is throbbing in its familiar, but 

 never-clichd, battle cry.

 KEY MEN 

 EAST BENGAL 

 ASHIM BISWAS: Ashim received a unique accolade from his 

 coach on Friday, when coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva 

 compared his instinctive speed inside the box to that of 

 the 1994 World Cup top-scorer Romario. Since his sensational 

 national debut in the SAFF Cup in Dhaka three years back, 

 a spate of injuries has slowed his progress as one of Indias 

 leading strikers. He could be East Bengals trump card 

 on Saturday.

 DIPANKAR ROY: The diminutive midfielder is enjoying a rebirth 

 under the Brazilian coach Pereira. If his back-to-back MoM 

 awards in the ongoing CFL Premier Division are any indication, 

 it appears that Dipankar is keen to make a comeback to the 

 national side. Hes not physically imposing in the 

 midfield, but through his link-up play with the strikers, 

 he is a handy player

 MOHUN BAGAN 

 DIPENDU BISWAS: He remains a player more sinned against than sinning. Rejected 

 by Mahindra United last season due to cardiac problems, 

 Dipendu has a point to prove. Hes already scored his 

 200th goal and is raring to go for more. Dipendus 

 nose for goal is beyond doubt and he looks determined to 

 make a mark in a derby after a long time.

 BHAICHUNG BHUTIA: East Bengal know how dangerous their 

 former captain can be on Saturday. The India captain is 

 yet to fire in the league for Mohun Bagan, but he has the 

 reputation of living up to the billing on big occasions. 

 His introduction to the team was a key part of Mohun Bagans 

 Dream Team project. He knows its time to deliver. 

 Mohun Bagan will clearly depend on his performance for a 

 turnaround.

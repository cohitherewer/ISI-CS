 Inzamam supports pay-hike demand

 Inzamam

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has joined the chorus for a pay-hike while suggesting that special incentives be offered to the players for their performance in next years World Cup. 

We are going to ask the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to increase our salaries in the contracts as we feel this is due to us, Inzamam said. 

We will also discuss the possibility of having incentives for doing well in the World Cup, he was quoted as saying in a local daily. 

Pakistan players are currently given monthly retainerships in their central contracts in addition to match appearance fees. 

They have demanded that PCB either double their retainer fees or release them from central cont- racts. 

The Pakistan captain said the players also wanted PCB to review the existing match fees system. 

The PCB has issued 20 Central Contracts in three different categories, with the highest level getting a monthly retainership of Rs 200,000, followed by Rs 125,000 and Rs 75,000. 

Inzamam said the players would welcome incentives for their performances in the World Cup although we know that if we perform up to the mark, the rewards would flow in from every quarter. 

PCB director Abbas Zaidi said there had so far been no discussion with the players regarding pay rise. 

Pacer Mohammed Asif, who has taken 23 wickets in his last three Tests, and batsman Faisal Iqbal are expected to be rewarded with Central Contracts for recent performances when the contracts are reviewed next month.

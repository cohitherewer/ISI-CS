 Jeev-Zhang splits point

- Goodwill Trophy

- International team takes lead 

Shenzhen: Retief Goosens International team had the better of the opening day foursomes on Monday and will take a one-point lead into the singles matches at the inaugural Goodwill Trophy. 

The International team leads 2-1/2 to 1-1/2 in the two-day match play contest against a combination from the Ryder Cup countries led by Scotlands Colin Montgomerie. 

Goosen and Michael Campbell combined to beat Montgomerie and American Chris DiMarco 5 and 4. 

There was no goodwill shown to us! Michael and Retief played very well and were 5-under after seven, while we showed plenty of goodwill with bogeys and double-bogeys, Montgomerie was quoted as saying. 

International duo KJ Choi and Thongchai Jaidee had a 3 and 2 win over Paul Casey and Alejandro Canizares. 

Asian pair Zhang Lianwei and Jeev Milkha Singh came back from four down after nine holes to split the point with English pair Luke Donald and Nick Dougherty. 

Swedens Henrik Stenson and Welshman Bradley Dredge won the only full point for the combined Europe-United States team with a comfortable win over Australians Peter Senior and Paul Sheehan. 

The captains will square off in Tuesdays singles matches. 

Among the other matches, DiMarco will take on Campbell, Stenson faces Jeev and Donald is against Thongchai.

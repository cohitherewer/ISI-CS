The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Referee was playing for Bagan, says coach Aloke

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) coach Aloke Mukherjee lambasted referee Biswajit Kar for spoiling his teams chances against Mohun Bagan on Sunday. He also accused the official of playing in the green-and-maroon jersey. 

The referee simply destroyed us. It appeared to me that he was playing for Mohun Bagan, a livid Mukherjee said, reacting to Kars decision of awarding two penalties against CPT. 

How can you penalise a player for making a routine challenge? It was, in fact, Dipendu (Biswas) who pushed Soumen (Sarkar), but the referee inferred something else, Mukherjee said, referring to the first penalty which Dipendu failed to convert. 

Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya admitted that the win was earned in a difficult way. 

With Sanjeev Maria and Mehrajuddin Wadao unavailable, my new-look defence (Eduardo Coelho, Deepak Mondal and D. Ravanan) will take some time to settle. There was also no link-play between my defence and half-line. Hopefully, with more practice well overcome this problem, he said. 

Bhattacharya, however, was all praise for Bhaichung Bhutias winning goal. Its the work of a genius, he said. Mukherjee also described the goal as brilliant, but blamed his keeper for being on a wrong position.

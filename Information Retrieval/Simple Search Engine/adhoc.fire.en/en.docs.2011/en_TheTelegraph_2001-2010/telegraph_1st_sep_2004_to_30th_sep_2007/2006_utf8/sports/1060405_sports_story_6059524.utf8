 Trevor Hohns resigns 

Sydney: Trevor Hohns resigned on Tuesday as chairman of Cricket Australia (CA)s national selection panel after 10 years in the high-pressure job, saying he wants to devote more time to his business commitments. 

Hohns reign spanned one of the most successful periods in Australian cricketing history. 

CA chairman Creagh Connor paid tribute to Hohns, who had served on the selection panel since 1993 and had been its chairman since 1996. 

Trevor has fulfilled one of Australian crickets most important roles in what has been one of the most successful eras in our history, Connor said in a statement. 

Connor said Hohns played a pivotal part in helping Australia remain the No. 1 Test and one-day International team in world cricket over a sustained period. 

Hohns said he had enjoyed his tenure, but now wanted to dedicate more time to his business interests. 

No replacement was immediately announced, and a CA spokesman said one would likely not be named for several weeks. Other members of the CA panel include former Australian players David Boon and Merv Hughes.

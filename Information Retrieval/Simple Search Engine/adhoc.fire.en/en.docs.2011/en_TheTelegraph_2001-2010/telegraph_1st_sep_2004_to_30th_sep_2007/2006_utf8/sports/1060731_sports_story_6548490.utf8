 Prince keeps SA afloat

Colombo: A defiant unbeaten half-century from stand-in captain Ashwell Prince enabled South Africa to reach 311 for four at stumps on Day IV of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Sunday. 

Princes gritty 60 off 170 balls, supported by an equally determined unbeaten 38 from Mark Boucher, gave the tourists a glimmer of hope of saving the opening Test after the first three days were dominated by Sri Lanka. 

Dismissed for 169 in their first innings, South Africa resumed their second essay on 43 for no loss overnight after the hosts had declared on 756 for the loss of five wickets. The tourists still face the daunting task of batting out three more sessions to save the Test with just six wickets remaining. 

South Africa openers Jacques Rudolph (90) and Andrew Hall (64) had earlier resisted the Lankan bowlers during a record 165-run partnership, before pace bowler Dilhara Fernando struck two important blows after lunch. 

The tourists rearguard faltered in the afternoon session as they crumbled from 165 for 0 to 185 for three, but their resistance stiffened again in the final session with Sri Lanka able to claim just one more wicket. 

Rudolph and Hall batted in a positive vein during the morning and, apart from one strong appeal for a bat-pad, Hall looked rock-solid on a wearing but still docile pitch at the Sinhalese Sports Club. 

After lunch, following his four for 48 in the first innings, Fernando toyed with Rudolph outside the off stump before finding the outside edge. Chamara Kapugedera took a fine low catch at second slip. 

Opening in place of an unwell Herschelle Gibbs, Rudolph finished with 90 from 182 balls, having hit 13 boundaries. 

The opening stand was a first-wicket record for South Africa against Sri Lanka, surpassing the 137 scored by Keppler Wessels and Andrew Hudson in 1993-94 at the same venue. 

Fernando quickly followed it up with the wicket of Hashim Amla (2) with a full-length in-swinging delivery that trapped the right-hander lbw. 

Muttiah Muralidharan, forced to toil uncharacteristically hard, claimed his first scalp of the innings when Hall was adjudged lbw to an off break bowled around the wicket. Muralidharan struck again after tea, trapping AB de Villiers (2 4) lbw. 

The wily off-spinner, though, failed to make further inroads as Boucher and Prince resolutely batted out the day.

The one-day series in India has been a waste of time as a method of assessing Englands World Cup prospects. Duncan Fletcher reckons he already knows 10 of his likely World Cup side; the problem is that half of them are not in India at the moment. 

For the past two years, England have been a poor one-day team and thats because they havent been able to field a settled side. We keep losing players to injury, illness or paternity leave. You dont know from one game to the next who is going to take the field. 

Its very difficult to know whether England are a good one-day side or not because their best players dont play together often enough. To have any chance of doing well in the World Cup, we have got to have a settled team and we need to get our best players fit. 

The series in India has become little more than a series of trial matches and Im afraid its proved that some of our youngsters are just not good enough. 

Im sorry, but Kabir Ali, Liam Plunkett, Owais Shah and Ian Bell arent going to win the World Cup for England. 

Batting has let England down again and I cant understand why they keep sticking Andrew Flintoff, our best batsman, down at No. 5. 

Can you imagine the West Indies allowing Viv Richards, when he was in his pomp, to sit in the pavilion while four lesser batsmen went in ahead of him? 

Well, thats what England are doing at the moment. We are letting batsmen who are not as good as Flintoff go in ahead of him. When they make a cock-up, he has to come in and try to get them out of trouble. Its just stupid. 

People are wary of Flintoffs talent and his power, and rightly so. Hes a huge figure who can dominate in any form of cricket. Just because he bowls and captains the side doesnt mean that you should stick him down at No. 5 or 6. 

In one-day cricket there are 300 balls in an innings and you want your best batsmen to face as many of them as possible. Id like to see England try Flintoff at No. 3, which would allow him and Kevin Pietersen to face as many of the 50 overs as possible. If they fail, then someone else has a chance to shine. 

Id also like to see England recall Darren Gough. Hes a winner, whether its Strictly Come Dancing or international cricket. Flintoff could do with some help at the moment and England need old heads and young legs. 

Goughie has the character and personality to lift the dressing room. But England also need his skill and experience of bowling with the new ball and at the death in one-day cricket. 

Those are the two crucial parts of the game for a seam bowler and, if hes fit, Goughie is still the best around. Its all right blooding the likes of Plunkett and Kabir, but Im afraid they arent in the same class. 

Matthew Hoggard also struggles in one-day cricket. His strengths in Test cricket ? he bowls line and length and is predictable ? are his Achilles heel in one-day cricket. Unless its a seamers pitch, I dont think that he should play limited overs cricket. 

With the World Cup less than 12 months away, England are in no-mans land. They are ranked sixth in the world in one-day cricket, which is not false because their form has been dreadful for two years. 

A lot of attention seems to be focused on retaining the Ashes in Australia next winter. But England need to start thinking about the World Cup now, not once the Ashes series is over. 

We cant hope that everything will turn out all right on the day in the West Indies. Im a great believer in the Australian way of picking your best team and getting into the good habit of winning. 

If England dont start getting their act together, getting people fit and picking a settled team, then there are going to be thousands of disappointed England supporters in the Caribbean next winter.

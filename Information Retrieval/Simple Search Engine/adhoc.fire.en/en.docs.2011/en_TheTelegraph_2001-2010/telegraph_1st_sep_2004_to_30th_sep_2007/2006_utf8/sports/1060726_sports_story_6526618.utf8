 Farthate clinches gold

 Avneet Kaur has earned an Olympic quota place 

Zagreb: Indias Avneet Kaur Sidhu earned an Olympic quota place despite finishing eighth in womens 10m air rifle event at the ISSF World Shooting Championships here. 

Navnath Farthate won the gold medal in junior mens air rifle event. He shot 596/600 to become the second Indian junior to win a gold medal in the meet. Jaspal Rana had won the gold in standard pistol in 1994. 

This is Indias second gold of the meet after Abhinav Bindra won the 10m air rifle event on Monday. 

Avneet recovered from a shaky start in the qualification to fire three perfect 100s and tally 397, which earned her a chance to compete in Bejing Olympics in 2008. In the finals, she shot 101.1 for a tally of 498.1. 

Avneet thus brought up Indias sixth quota place for the Beijing Olympics with Rajyavardhan Rathore, Gagan Narang, Manavjit Sandhu, Anjali Bhagwat and Bindra having also booked their places. 

Tejaswini Sawant finished 23rd with 394 while Deepali Deshpande was a distant 70th with 390. 

Du Li of China won the gold after managing 502.1 (398+ 104.1) while the silver was grabbed by Katerina Kurkova of Czech Republic with a score of 501.8 (398+103.8) and Olga Dovgun of Kazakhstan got the bronze with 500.9 (398+102.9). 

In the team event, India finished fourth with a tally of 1181. The gold in the team event went to Germany (1192) while China bagged the silver (1190). Russia finished third. 

Meanwhile, Bindra, who is suffering from chronic back pain, has been flown to Munich to undergo treatment. 

My son will be taking expert medical advise from doctors in Munich for the persisting back pain and if need be he will undergo surgery, said Dr. A.S Bindra, father of the shooter. 

The Punjab government on Tuesday also announced a cash award of Rs 21 lakh for the shooter. The money would be handed over to at a function on August 6. (PTI)

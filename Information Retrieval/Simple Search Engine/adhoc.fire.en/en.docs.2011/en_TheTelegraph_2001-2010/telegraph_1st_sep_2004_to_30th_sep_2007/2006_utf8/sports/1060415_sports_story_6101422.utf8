 Jha checkmates Surya Sekhar

Visakhapatnam: International Master Sriram Jha checkmated top-seeded Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly to lend another twist in the tale of the 43rd National A Chess Championships here. 

The victory did not help Jha improve upon his position in the premier event, but it turned out to be disastrous for defending champion Surya Sekhar who had earlier seen Deepan Chakravarthy take a surprising quick draw with M. S. Thej Kumar in the 16th round. 

The other big winner of the day was IM S. Kidambi who revived his hopes of making it to the Indian team with a finely crafted victory over erstwhile sole leader GM Koneru Humpy. 

With just five rounds remaining and with Deepan having four games left, it seems there may be no stopping the former Asian junior champion as he edged up to 12 points and stretched his lead to a whopping 1.5 points over nearest rivals M. R. Venkatesh and Diwakar Prasad Singh ? who let a certain victory against GM Abhijit Kunte slip out of his hands. 

Surya Sekhar, with 10.5 points, is now at fourth spot with five games in hand. 

With Kunte and GM Sandipan Chanda on 9.5 points each and Kidambi on nine points, the war for a berth in the Indian team is only likely to get intense in the last few rounds. 

Amongst those in contention, only Chakravarthy and Singh are yet to get a bye, which means that the remaining players have an extra game in hand. 

Meanwhile, it was another topsy-turvy day in the 32nd edition of the womens national championship being held simultaneously. Top seed IM S. Vijayalakshmi and her younger sister, WGM S. Meenakshi tasted defeats at the hands of J. E. Kavitha and Kiran Manisha Mohanty, respectively in the 14th round. 

With just four rounds remaining in this section, WGM Swati Ghate remained atop the table with a thumping victory over Aarthie Ramaswamy and took her tally to 10.5 points.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Okoro-EB standoff put to rest, for a while

A STAFF REPORTER

 Mike Okoro at the IFA on Monday 

Calcutta: It seems that Mike Okoro will now get his dues but may have to wait till the end of the 10 th National Football League (NFL). East Bengal have ultimately promised to give Okoro his 15 days payment, provided the footballer follows the club rules and regulations. 

Both Okoro and East Bengal club representative vice-president Dr Shanti Ranjan Dasgupta, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), in presence of the Indian Football Association (IFA) secretary Subrata Dutta, on Monday. 

According to the agreement, Okoro shall get the amount of Rs 1,30,000 ?? which was cut from his salary ?? on the basis of his performance and involvement in the NFL. The amount was cut from his salary, when he visited Poland for a citizenship problem. 

Okoro episode saw a bizarre drama on Monday when the footballer and Dr Dasguptas statements contradicted each other during the media conference at the IFA office after the tripartite meeting was over. 

Okoro said that the club has agreed to pay him the amount. Everything is fine now. The problem has been solved and the club has decided to pay me the amount, said the striker. 

But club representative Dr Dasgupta contradicted, when asked for comments. Today we signed the MOU and it clearly said that he would only be given the amount after evaluating his performance in the league. 

Okoro, also took the opportunity to criticise the East Bengal coach Phillipe de Ridder. He never spoke to me why I couldnt turn up for the practice. I was ill and my version was not heard, said the striker. 

The striker also apologised to the fans for his remark, that he wishes to play for their arch-rivals Mohun Bagan. 

But it is unlikely that the player will be available for the East Bengals derby match against Mohun Bagan on Saturday. 

The points of the agreement, which were signed on Monday are as follows: 

 East Bengal will pay the salary of Mike Okoro for the month of January and March 2006 as per the existing contract, within seven days of signing the MOU. 

 Okoro will immediately join the practice schedule of the club and rigorously follow the regime as prescribed by the coach. 

 Okoro will abide by the code of conduct and all the rules of the club. 

 Okoro will not make derogatory statements against the club to the press. 

 If there is no complaint of any nature against Okoro by the club, then on request of the IFA secretary, the club will pay Okoro 15 days salary amounting to Rs 1,30,000. 

 Payment of Rs 1,30,000 to Okoro will only be made 

 after the completion of the 10 th NFL in May. The payment 

 shall be accomplished by deduction from the advance of Rs 

 3,34,300 that was given to him by the club as an advance 

 before signing the contract that exists between the two 

 parties.

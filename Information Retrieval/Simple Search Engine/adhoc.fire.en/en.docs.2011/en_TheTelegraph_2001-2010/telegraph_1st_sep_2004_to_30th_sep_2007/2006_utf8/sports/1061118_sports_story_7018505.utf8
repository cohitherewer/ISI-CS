 - Paes-Damm to clash with Bjorkman-Mirnyi in semis 

 Rafael Nadal after beating Nikolay Davydenko on Friday 

Shanghai:Rafael Nadal rallied to beat Nikolay Davydenko 5-7, 6-4, 6-4 Friday and set up a Masters Cup semi-final against top-ranked Roger Federer. 

Federer finished top of the Red Group round robin stage, unbeaten against Andy Roddick, defending champion David Nalbandian and Ivan Ljubicic. 

Nadal lost to American James Blake in his opening match and recovered to beat fellow Spaniard Tommy Robredo and No. 3 Davydenko to qualify second from the Gold Group. Blake was assured of top spot in the group even before his 2-6, 6-3, 5-7 loss to Robredo in the final round-robin match on Friday. Blake will play Nalbandian in the semi-finals. 

Davydenko ran out of energy in the deciding set, as he did after leading Blake by a set and break before losing his previous match. 

In doubles matches Friday, second-seeded Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi finished the Gold Group round robin stage unbeaten with a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) win over Fabrice Santoro and Nenad Zimonjic. Mark Knowles and Daniel Nestor also advanced 6-3, 6-3 win over Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. In the semi, Bjorkman-Mirnyi is against Martin Damm and Leander Paes, while Knowles and Nestor take on Paul Hanley and Kevin Ullyett. (AP)

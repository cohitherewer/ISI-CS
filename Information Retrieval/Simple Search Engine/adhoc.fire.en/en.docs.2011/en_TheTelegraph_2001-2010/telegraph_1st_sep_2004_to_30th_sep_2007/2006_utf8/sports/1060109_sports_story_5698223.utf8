 London: The Asian Rugby Union (ARU) has threatened the sport?s governing body with legal action unless it annuls the vote that awarded the 2011 World Cup to New Zealand. The ARU wants a new ballot by the International Rugby Board (IRB) council on the grounds that the previous one in November lacked transparency because the IRB decided during the voting process not to reveal the count. The IRB confirmed it had received the fax in which the ARU, asks for a new vote to take place by March 31. If the IRB does not respond by Friday, the ARU may take action in court under English law. New Zealand won the right to host the 2011 tournament ahead of favourites Japan and South Africa.

 Adelaide: France?s Florent Serra won his second ATP Tour title with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over Belgium?s Xavier Malisse at the Australian Hardcourt Championships on Sunday.

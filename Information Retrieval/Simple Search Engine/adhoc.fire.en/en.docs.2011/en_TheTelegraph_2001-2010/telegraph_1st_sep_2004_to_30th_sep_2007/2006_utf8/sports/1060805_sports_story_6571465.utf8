 IFA meeting to discuss manhandling today

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The IFA has called an emergent meeting of its status committee on Saturday to discuss the manhandling of its secretary Subrata Dutta by Mohammedan Sporting supporters on Thursday. It has been learnt that the IFA will take a stern action against Mohammedan Sporting. 

Dutta, who happens to be a vice-president of AIFF had visited all the three big clubs along with AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco to oversee the infrastructure for the professional league. During their visit to the Mohammedan Sporting tent, Dutta was manhandled by a group of supporters who alleged Dutta was favouring East Bengal over the transfer disputes. 

East Bengal have informed IFA that they will not be able to play their CFL matches on August 9 and 14 as their key players will be attending the camp for the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia.

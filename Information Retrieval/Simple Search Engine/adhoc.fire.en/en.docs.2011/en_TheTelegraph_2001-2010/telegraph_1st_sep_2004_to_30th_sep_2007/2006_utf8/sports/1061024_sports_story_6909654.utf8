 Jayanta 4th

New Delhi: Jayanta Talukdar had a disappointing outing at the grand final of the Archery World Cup as he finished fourth after losing the bronze medal match to Magnus Petersson of Sweden in Merida, Mexico. 

The 20-year-old had a disastrous start to the final leg on Sunday losing all three round robin matches in the mens recurve competition. 

After going down to Petersson 112-109, Talukdar pulled up his socks to secure a tie against park Kyung-mo of Korea on 108 points. But the Korean prevailed in the tie-breaker to deny the Indian. 

Against Ilario di Buo of Italy, Talukdar again fell short with a narrow 103-105 defeat. 

In the semi-final duel, the Tata Academy archer had a tough battle against the Italian. Although he was tied with Di Buo after the first leg of the match (27-27), Talukdar fell behind by three points at the end of the third leg (52-54/80-83). 

Shooting three excellent last arrows (10-10-9), the Indian did not give up, but Di Buo used his experience to shoot three nines and keep a one-point lead, which was enough for a 110-109 victory.

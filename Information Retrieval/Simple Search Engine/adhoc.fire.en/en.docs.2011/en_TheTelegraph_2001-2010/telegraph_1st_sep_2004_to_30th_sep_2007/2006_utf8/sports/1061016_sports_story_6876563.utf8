 Cant take anything for granted: Smith

 - Shane Bond out of tie vs South Africa with stiff back

Mumbai: For South Africa, its time to shift the focus from the Herschelle Gibbs episode to the real battlefield. If the 33-year-old wanted to prove a point or two in his alleged match-fixing role by agreeing to tour India and face police interrogation after skipping the previous two occasions, his team No. 2 in the world has an equally serious issue to deal with. 

Ever since Graeme Smith amp; Co. encamped themselves here, there has been a conscious attempt from their end, sometimes through Shaun Pollock or Jacques Kallis, to insist that the choker tag that they have been living with like an irreversible nightmare, is now a thing of the past. 

Truth to tell, they have recent proof to substantiate such a claim. In what could easily be described as the Wonder at the Wanderers in March, Gibbs inspired South Africa in the most amazing fashion to overhaul Australias record-breaking challenge of 434. They broke the 400-mark barrier again against Zimbabwe in the build-up to the Champions Trophy only a few days ago. With Smith and Kallis back in the fold following their injury lay-off, one can expect the unexpected from this bunch of record-breakers. 

Playing in India is a big challenge. Its a tall task for everybody. So we cant take anything for granted, Smith told a press conference on Sunday. 

Just a few words of caution from the South African captain, reminding one of the simple philosophy that nothing even the most cherished records is static in the volatile nature of one-day cricket. One needs to move on, set standards and then move on again. 

Smith, however, got some welcome news from their opponents just hours before their campaign-opener. Shane Bond was forced to delay his debut on Indian soil with a stiffness in back he suffered during the nets on Friday. 

Since he is an integral part of our strategy not only in this tournament, but the World Cup as well, we are not going to take any unnecessary risk with him, explained his captain, Stephen Fleming, adding that the speedster didnt feature in Sundays practice session. 

He is preparing himself for the second match, Fleming added, hiding an air of discomfort. 

Smith, however, refused to read too much into this sudden development in the rival camp. They are a very good one-day side. They boast of having attacking bowlers and also, they bat well quite low down the order. Its not going to be easy for us, he pointed out. 

Two pictures during their brief training session, however, hold significance. Away from the uneasiness of handling a list of questionnaire from the Delhi Police, Gibbs seemed at peace facing Pollock amp; Co. at the Brabourne Stadium. 

A few yards away, the Makhaya Ntinis and Andre Nels were diving acrobatically to stop an uninterrupted flow of tennis balls, flung towards them by the fielding coach Jonty Rhodes. The seriousness in ensuring a good beginning never stopped at the doorstep of any advantage, coming through Bonds absence. 

Late last year, South African fast bowlers negotiated the much-vaunted Indian batting line-up with a creditable 2-2 draw, an experience which, Smith admitted, would hold them in good stead in the tournament. 

New Zealand, on the other hand, have not played international cricket since May, let alone their struggle to cope with the Indian conditions. Fleming, though, played down the rustiness by saying that several of his teammates had featured in the just-concluded English County season. 

Monday will witness how quickly South Africa can outgrow the uncertainties following the Gibbs statement of admitting to tanking a match, it also remains to be seen how fast the Flemings switch themselves to the match mode in international cricket.

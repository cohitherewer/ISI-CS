 N. Korea end Jordan run

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Riding a first-half goal from Kim Kum-il, North Korea ended Jordans dream run in the AFC Youth Championship and set the final date with Japan. 

Both teams took a wait-and-watch policy, thereby rendering it a battle of attrition in the middle. In the 29th minute, North Korea tested the Jordanian keeper Hamad Al Asmar, who made a diving save of Pak Chol-mins volley from inside the box. 

It was turn for the Korean custodian Ju Kwang-min to deny Jordan as he palmed away Loiy Al Zaidehs header in the 38th minute. The matchwinner came about on the very counter-attack of that move. 

Chol-min sent a long ball which reached Kum-il in midfield. With the entire Jordan defence struggling to fall back, Kum-il steered clear of Tariq Al Jumah challenge and beat Al Asmar to slot home the goal.

North Korea: Kwang Min Ju; Yong Chol Ri, Nam Chol Pak, Yong Il Yun (Se Yong Pak 66), Kwang Hyok Rl, Kwang Ik Jon; Kum Il Kim, Chol Myong Rl, Kyong Il Kim (Hung Ryong Ri 82); Chol Min Pak, Chol Min Jong (Kuk Jin Kim 38).

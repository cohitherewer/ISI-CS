 Minister seeks Dalmiya resignation

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The countdown has begun. State urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya on Tuesday gave the anti-Jagmohan Dalmiya lobby a shot in the arm by seeking the resignation of the CAB president. 

Dalmiya should step down from the CAB in the interest of cricket. He has not taken any initiative in promoting the game either in the city or in the districts. Cricket has not made any headway in the state, Bhattacharya said. 

The fact that Sourav Ganguly and other talented players are not getting into the national squad is a failure on the part of Dalmiya, he added. 

The AGM is scheduled to be held next month. City police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee is set to challenge Dalmiya for the presidents post. A host of former cricketers, including Souravs brother Snehasish, have thrown their weight behind Mukherjee.

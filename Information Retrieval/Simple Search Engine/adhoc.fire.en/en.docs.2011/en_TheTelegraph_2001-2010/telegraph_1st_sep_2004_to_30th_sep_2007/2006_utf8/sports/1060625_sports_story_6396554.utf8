 Senderos out of Cup

 Cologne: Switzerland defender Philippe Senderos 

 will miss the rest of the World Cup after dislocating his 

 shoulder in Fridays win over South Korea, team officials 

 said on Saturday. 

 Doctor Rudolf Roeder said Senderos had suffered ligament 

 damage in the incident. 

He will be out for a minimum of two weeks. There is a 50 per cent chance he will require an operation, but the most important thing now is rest, Roeder said. 

Senderos was part of a Swiss defence that has yet to concede a goal at the World Cup. 

 Of course, it is a big blow for us, but we have 

 already seen his friend Johan (Djourou) standing in well 

 in the defence, said Swiss coach Koebi Kuhn. 

 In Bergisch Gladbach, Brazil striker Robinho ended 

 training early on Saturday after suffering a twinge in his 

 right thigh, team doctor Jose Luis Runco said. Robinho was 

 seen to clutch his thigh during shooting practice. 

Robinho felt a twinge in the front of his right thigh, he said. He is undergoing ice treatment, we will wait and see. 

 If necessary we will ask for tests and if he 

 still has pain, tomorrow (Sunday) we will hold him back.

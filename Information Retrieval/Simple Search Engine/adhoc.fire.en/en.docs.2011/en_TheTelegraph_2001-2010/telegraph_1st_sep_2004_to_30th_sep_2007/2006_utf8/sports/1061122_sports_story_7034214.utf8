 Izumi set for EB debut 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Now, its time for the Japanese inspiration for East Bengal. After a rather disappointing show by their two Brazilian recruits, the East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira is looking forward to the Japan-born midfielder Izumi Arata to do the needful against JCT in the Durand Cup. 

However, Arata who arrived in the capital late on Monday will not get a place in the first eleven in Wednesdays encounter. I would rather bring him as a substitute, Pereira said. Let him watch the teams play for sometime before he gets a real feel of the pitch. 

Pereira said that East Bengal will start with a 4-4-2 formation with Alvito DCunha back in the first team. DCunha would have come as a substitute against Dempo, but the red card to Dipankar Roy upset my plans. 

Surprisingly, Pereira is planning to drop Chandan Das from the midfield. His idea is to play Bibiano Fernandes along with Jayanta Sen, DCunha and Daniel. The other Brazilian, striker Thiago, has a sore ankle and may not start in the forwardline. In that case, Pereira said, Vimal Pariyar will shoulder the responsibility with Freddy Mascarenhas in the striking zone. 

Contrary to popular belief, the East Bengal coach was not ready to dismiss the two Brazilians as no good. 

Please have some patience on them. Both of them are good players and need time to adjust to the conditions. They are useful and experienced footballers, the coach from their country asserted.

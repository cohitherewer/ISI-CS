 We will fight back, promises Sehwag

Port Elizabeth: Amid scathing criticism of its performance and strategies back home, Indias stand-in skipper Virender Sehwag Tuesday appealed to fans to repose their faith in the team and promised a fight back. 

He also gave a vote of confidence to coach Greg Chappell, who is also under attack, after the teams spineless display in the two matches so far. 

My message to cricket fans is that they should trust us. We are good players and we would fight back, Sehwag said ahead of the fourth one-dayer against South Africa here Wednesday. 

Indians find themselves jammed in from all sides on the tour, be it their own wretched performance or injuries to key players or the anger swelling up back home. 

Sehwag said the criticism was expected and as professional sportsmen they would take it in their stride. 

In a way, the criticism can be expected and its not new. When you do well you are praised and when you fail, you are criticised. 

But yes players do get upset when they are told by families back home about the reaction. However, we need to take it in stride as we are professional sportsmen and these things do happen. 

Sehwag looked at Rahul Dravids absence, due to a finger injury, as a moment of opportunity for other players. In a way it is an opportunity because we could have games in future when there would be no Tendulkar or Dravid. The rest of the boys have to be prepared and take over the responsibility. 

The Delhi batsman did not think it was right for anyone to blame Chappell for Indias ills. 

Thats not right. A coach doesnt perform in the middle. The boys do. Coach and captain get credit whenever the team wins but it is the bunch of 11 players who set up the victory. Similarly in moments of defeat, a coach and a captain shouldnt be blamed. 

Chappells coaching style, being ridiculed in Indian cricket circles these days, also drew praise from the opener. 

I think he is a good coach. Under his coaching, our batsmen have improved a lot. He attends to technical issues and gives us good insight. 

Sehwag refused to be drawn into any debate about the usefulness of VVS Laxman in one-day cricket in the wake of the comment by chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar that he did not have the required fitness for one-day cricket. I dont want to be drawn into this debate but the quality of Laxman is there to be seen in his record. 

Sehwag said the problems for the team could be solved if the players batted out 50 overs and raised a reasonable total on the board. We have to bat well, bat for 50 overs. The batsmen who are set need to carry on. 

He also hinted that both the spinners, Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, could play in Wednesday.

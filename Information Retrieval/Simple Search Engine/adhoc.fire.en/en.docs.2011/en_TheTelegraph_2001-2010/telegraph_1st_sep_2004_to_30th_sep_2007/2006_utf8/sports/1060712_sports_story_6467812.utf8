 Radcliffe expecting

London: World marathon champion Paula Radcliffe will not defend her European 10,000 metres title in Sweden next month because she is expecting a baby in January. 

Ill continue training at the same level but I definitely will not be doing the European Athletics Championships, Briton Radcliffe said on the European Athletic Association (EAA) website. 

Ill be four months pregnant by then and do not want to take any risks. I wont compete in top level competitions but will run some low key races (this year). 

Well see how it goes. However, first and foremost, it is important the baby is born healthy, added the 32-year-old.

 Russia set up final date with Argentina 

 Tursunov after beating Roddick on Sunday 

Moscow: Substitute Dmitry Tursunov beat Andy Roddick in an epic five-set battle, 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 17-15, to seal a Russian victory over the United States on Sunday and send the home team into the Davis Cup final. 

The California-based Russian could barely put a foot wrong, building up a two-set lead before the American fought back in the third and fourth to force the deciding set. 

After wasting three match points in the 24th game, Tursunov finally broke Roddicks serve in the 32nd game to clinch a dramatic victory after four hours 48 minutes. 

It was Russias first victory over their former Cold War adversaries in Davis Cup after losing two previous ties, including the 1995 Moscow final on a similar clay surface. 

The Russians will host Argentina in the final in Moscow in December after the South Americans took an unbeatable 3-0 lead against Australia in the other semi-final in Buenos Aires. 

Two of the eight playoffs were settled after only two days. Austria and Czech Republic secured their World Group status by taking unassailable 3-0 leads over Mexico at home in Portschach and the Netherlands away in Leiden, respectively. 

Spain went 2-1 up against Italy in Santander with Rafael Nadal and Fernando Verdasco prevailing over Daniele Bracciali and Giorgio Galimberti 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6. Switzerland also lead 2-1 after Roger Federer and Yves Allegro beat Serbias Ilia Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 in the doubles in Geneva. (Reuters)

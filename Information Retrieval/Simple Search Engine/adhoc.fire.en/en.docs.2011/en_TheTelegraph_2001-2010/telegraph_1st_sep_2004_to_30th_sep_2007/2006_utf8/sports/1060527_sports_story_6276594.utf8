 Another scan for Rooney on June 14

Wayne Rooney will fly to Germany for the World Cup but will not learn whether he can play until a further scan on his broken foot on June 14. Manchester United on Friday announced the results of a CT scan on the metatarsal Rooney broke against Chelsea on April 29 and said they were satisfied with his recovery so far. 

A statement said: His injury is progressing as expected and we now hope to gradually increase his rehabilitation as planned. 

A further CT scan will be performed in Manchester on June 14 to assess further his recovery and a decision will then be made as to whether he can begin to participate in training. 

England head coach Sven-Goran Eriksson, who said he would take Rooney to Germany even if it meant he could only play in the final, described the news as very encouraging. 

Im looking forward to Wayne joining up with the rest of the squad on Sunday, said Eriksson. 

The fact that he is flying out to Germany with us will give everyone a huge lift. 

Were still hoping that the second scan will show further improvement and that Wayne can play his part in the World Cup. 

Rooney, 20, was almost certain to miss the group stages and the latest medical verdict has confirmed that.

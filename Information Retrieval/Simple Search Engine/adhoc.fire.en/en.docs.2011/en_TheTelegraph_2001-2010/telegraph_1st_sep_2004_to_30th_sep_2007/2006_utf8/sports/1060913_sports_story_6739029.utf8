 Chappell and Bennett King

Kuala Lumpur: Its an unusual coincidence that the Malaysian capital has brought John Buchanan, Greg Chappell and Bennett King on the same platform the tri-series, which got underway on Tuesday. 

Buchanans contract as Australias coach gets over after the 2007 World Cup and theres speculation that either Chappell or King could succeed him. Both are Australians and have coached regional sides (King was at the Academy, too) in their own country. 

In fact, things reached such a stage last month that Chappell, who was then in Colombo, had to issue a statement driving home the point he was focused on his India job. His contract also gets over after the World Cup. 

On Monday evening, King spoke to The Telegraph briefly at the team hotel. No, theres no awkwardness about the situation... Im concentrating on my job and Im not seeing myself as a candidate (to succeed Buchanan)... 

King confirmed his contract with the West Indies is till November 2007. That, however, shouldnt be a big issue if the Australian selectors, with Mark Taylor in the chair, zero in on him.

 Schumi, Alonso warm up damp practice

Shanghai: Title rivals Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso were separated by barely the blink of an eye after a damp start to the Chinese Grand Prix weekend on Friday. 

Less than a 10th of a second split Ferraris seven-time world champion, fifth fastest in the afternoon practice session at a grey and gusty Shanghai circuit, and Renaults championship leader. 

Alonso is two points clear of his German rival in a Formula One duel with three rounds remaining and every likelihood of hanging in the balance all the way to next months finale in Brazil. 

Schumacher and Alonso had kept out of each others way in the morning, with the young Spaniard watching and waiting from the pit wall as a string of test drivers lapped in front of almost deserted grandstands. 

Austrian reserve driver Alexander Wurz was quickest for Williams in both sessions, with a lap of one minute 35.574 seconds in the morning and 1:35.539 in the afternoon as the weather deteriorated into a steady drizzle. 

I think we need to be a bit cautious analysing the times because the conditions today are quite different to what we expect for the race, Alonso said. But so far the Michelins (tyres) seem to be working well 

German teenager Sebastian Vettel, who has set an impressive pace, was second on the afternoon timesheets.

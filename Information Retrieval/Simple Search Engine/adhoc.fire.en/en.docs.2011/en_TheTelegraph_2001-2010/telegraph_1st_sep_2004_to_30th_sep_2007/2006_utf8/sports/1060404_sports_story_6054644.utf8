 London: World marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe has withdrawn from the London Marathon on April 23 owing to a foot injury, organisers said on Monday. It follows her withdrawal from the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne with the same problem. Radcliffe has won the London Marathon three times ? in 2002, 2003 and 2005.

 Radcliffe said on Monday: ?I am really disappointed to miss this year?s event. The event is extremely important to me and I have done everything possible to get to the start line. ?I have to accept that the injury needs a short period of total rest and I also have to focus on moving on from this and on my future.?

 The 32-year-old Briton, who set the world record of 2::15:25 seconds in the 2003 London race, injured her right foot in training in January.

 New York: South Koreans captured the men?s overall gold and silver medals and the women?s overall gold on the final day of the World Short Track Speed Skating Championships on Sunday in Minneapolis.

South Korean compatriot Lee Ho-suk finished second overall in the men?s competition with 60 points, with Canada?s Francois-Louis Tremblay finishing third. Jin Sun-yu claimed women?s overall gold by picking up a total of 68 points.

 China won the women?s 3,000m relay, with Canada finishing second and Italy third.

 Seoul: London 2012 Games chairman Sebastian Coe has rejected reports that the cost for infrastructure work for the Olympics could balloon by up to ?2 billion ($3.45 billion).

 On Sunday, British media quoted Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) chief executive David Higgins as saying redeveloping funds for the Lower Lea Valley area in east London, where the Games will be held, would be higher than initially estimated. The reports said the redevelopment cost would rise by about ?2 billion.

 ?David Higgins did not say there was a ?2 billion overrun. This is not what he said and he did not mention a figure,? Coe said on Monday.

 Coe said London Games organisers had purchased the land and done the necessary preparations early enough so as to avoid any potential budget overruns.

 London: Croatia?s Ivan Ljubicic will join Spain?s Rafael Nadal in making his debut at the grasscourt Stella Artois Championships in June.

 World No.6 Nikolay Davydenko of Russia and No.8 James Blake of the US have also been added to the entry list.

 French Open champion and world No.2 Nadal, the only man to beat Federer this year, has already committed to the event on his least favourite surface.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Clearance likely today 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

New Delhi: The football team for the Asian Games in Doha, which is yet to receive the go-ahead from the Union sports ministry, is likely to be cleared on Wednesday. 

This is nothing unusual as in the last two Asian Games also, the football team participated at no cost to the government. The IOA secretary Randhir Singh said: We are hopeful to receive the governments permission on Wednesday. 

The AIFF sources said that it will foot the bill of the team in case the government refused to bear the expenses.

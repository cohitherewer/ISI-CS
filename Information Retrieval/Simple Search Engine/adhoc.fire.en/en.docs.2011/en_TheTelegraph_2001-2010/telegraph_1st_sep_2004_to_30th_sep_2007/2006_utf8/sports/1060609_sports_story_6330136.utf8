 Poles hope for better luck

Gelsenkirchen: Poland plan a 1970s revival in Fridays World Cup Group A clash with Ecuador as they bid to bring their South American opponents down to earth. 

Polish coach Pawel Janas has ripped up his pre-tournament notes and looks set to copy the 4-5-1 system that took Poland to third place the last time Germany hosted the World Cup in 1974. 

The pressure is on the Poles to banish the memory of their nightmare four years ago when they crashed out at the group stage. 

Ecuadors recent form has been patchy but coach Luis Fernando Suarez believes his side will be far tougher than the team which folded on their World Cup debut four years ago. 

They will also be anxious to prove they are as capable of winning big games at sea-level as they are at the high altitude of Quito. The South Americans were unbeaten in their home qualifying games and the only match they won away was also at high altitude in Bolivia. 

Suarez is quietly confident about his sides chances, but remains pragmatic. We must begin very cautiously, he said. We should seek to take advantage when space opens and catch them on the break. 

Poland should start as slight favourites, however, after successfully testing Janass rejigged system with a 1-0 victory over Croatia last weekend. 

Janass decided to ditch his preferred 4-4-2 shape and emulate former coach Kazimierz Gorski, who employed a five-man midfield behind a lone striker in 1974.

Melbourne: Lleyton Hewitt and Mary Pierce were knocked out of the Australian Open on Thursday while the Swiss pair of Martina Hingis and Roger Federer maintained cruise control during a day of high drama at Melbourne Park. 

Third seed Hewitt was beaten by his Argentine arch-rival Juan Ignacio Chela, Pierce fell to unseeded Czech Iveta Benesova and 10 seeds in all exited the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Hingis, at her comeback Grand Slam tournament, rolled back the years to thrash Finlands Emma Laine 6-1, 6-1 and reach the third round after 31-year-old Pierce, the fifth seed from France, was beaten 6-3, 7-5. 

Mens world No. 1 Federer strolled through to the next stage, hammering German Florian Mayer 6-1, 6-4, 6-0 in 72 minutes and the tournament is now seemingly at his mercy. 

I cant see anyone beating him now, Hewitt told a news conference after his defeat. 

Federer has won five of the last eight Grand Slams. 

Australian Hewitt was unable to reach the dizzy heights of a year ago when he rode a wave of national patriotism into the final, losing 6-4, 6-4, 6-7, 6-2 against Chela in a match that failed to live up to the hype. 

There was none of the expected fireworks after last years spiteful third-round clash between the pair after which Chela was fined for spitting in the Australians direction. 

They talked a lot about what happened last year, but when I got on to the court I was just thinking about the tennis match and not about what happened last year, Chela said through an interpreter. 

Hewitt and Pierce joined Dinara Safina, Ana Ivanovic, Sania Mirza, Gisela Dulko, Marion Bartoli, Anna-Lena Groenefeld, Olivier Rochus and Fernando Verdasco on the seeded casualty list. 

World No. 2 Kim Clijsters was lucky not to join them after a painful hip injury in her 6-4, 6-2 win over Chinese qualifier Yuan Meng. 

The US Open champion appeared to be on the verge of quitting when she called for a break as the pain became unbearable. 

There was more drama off the court when reports surfaced from Serbia that Damir Dokic was threatening to kidnap his estranged daughter Jelena as revenge for her decision to return to Australia. 

He later denied the reports although Jelena released a statement saying he had threatened her before.

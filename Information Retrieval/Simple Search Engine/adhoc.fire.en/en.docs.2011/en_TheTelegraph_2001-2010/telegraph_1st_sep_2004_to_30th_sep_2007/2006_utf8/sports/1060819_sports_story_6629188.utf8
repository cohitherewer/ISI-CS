 Clijsters unlikely to defend title

 - US OPEN 

 Kim Clijsters 

Brussels: Kim Clijsters is unlikely to defend her US Open title later this month because of a wrist injury. 

The world No. 2 underwent an MRI scan on her injury-prone left wrist on Thursday and is expected to be sidelined for at least two months, a statement on her website said. 

Kim is completely disillusioned, the statement said. She will definitely not play any tennis next week and will most likely be out of action for the following two months. 

The Belgian, who suffered her latest setback during a second-round match at the Montreal Masters on Wednesday, could also miss out on representing Belgium in next months Fed Cup final against Italy. 

Clijsters will remain in the US for a few more days before returning to Belgium early next week to undergo further tests. 

The US Open starts on August 28, while the Fed Cup final between Belgium and Italy is scheduled to take place over the weekend of September 16-17. 

The 23-year-old played only three matches from May 2004 to February 2005 after damaging a tendon in her left wrist which needed surgery. 

The operation appeared to have been successful as Clijsters racked up nine titles, including her maiden Grand Slam title at Flushing Meadows, following her comeback. 

But on Wednesday, she was dealt another cruel blow. 

It is really painful. It feels the same as in 2004, said Clijsters, who has a double-handed backhand. It became stiffer and stiffer and with the history of my wrist it always looked bad. 

Despite regaining the world No. 1 spot for a while earlier this year, she has been dogged by injury during the season. A right ankle injury forced her to quit during her Australian Open semi-final against Amelie Mauresmo.

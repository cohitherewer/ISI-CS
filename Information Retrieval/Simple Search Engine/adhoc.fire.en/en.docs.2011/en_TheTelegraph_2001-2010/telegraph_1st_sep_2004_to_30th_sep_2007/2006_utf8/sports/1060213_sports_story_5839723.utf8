 Storm Ahead fancied 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT 

 Christopher

 Mysore: Storm Ahead, who was an eye-catching winner over Double Eve in the last outing, has the best credentials to score an encore in the Smt. Satyavathy V. Char Memorial Cup here on Monday. The Satish Narredu-trained Saken, who is running in higher class but well placed in scales, is expected to run the favourite close. J. Christopher partners the Gregory Sandhu-trainee Storm Ahead.

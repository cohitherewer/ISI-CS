 Renault pin hopes on appeal court

London: Formula One champions Renault hope a Paris appeal court will boost their title hopes on Tuesday. 

The details at the centre of the controversy are hardly headline grabbing, focusing on the intricacies of mass damper systems. 

Yet the outcome of the appeal by the International Automobile Federation (FIA) against a ruling by its own stewards at last months German Grand Prix could have a considerable bearing on the seasons last five races. 

The stewards Decision number eight at Hockenheim on July 28 overruled an earlier move by the governing body to ban a spring-mounted mass damper device installed in the nose of the Renault. 

The system, which improves race performance by levelling out tyre vibrations and keeping grip levels consistent, had been used by the Anglo-French team since September last year. 

The FIA ruled last month that it constituted a moveable aerodynamic device and was therefore illegal. 

Although the stewards backed Renault, the champions did not use the damper in either Germany or the subsequent race in Hungary for fear of eventual disqualification should the governing body be vindicated in their independent court of appeal. 

In that time, Ferrari have hacked away at Renaults lead, with Michael Schumacher now just 10 points adrift of world champion Fernando Alonso ahead of this weekends Turkish Grand Prix in Istanbul. 

Alonso, winner of six races this year, finished fifth in Germany and retired in Hungary due to a damaged wheel nut while leading the race. 

An indication of just how much the device matters came from team boss Flavio Briatore who blasted the FIA in Hungary for what he considered an attempt to manipulate the championship. (Reuters)

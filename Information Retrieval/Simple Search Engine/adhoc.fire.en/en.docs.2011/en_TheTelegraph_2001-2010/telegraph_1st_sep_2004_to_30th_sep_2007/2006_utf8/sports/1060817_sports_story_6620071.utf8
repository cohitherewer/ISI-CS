 Chopras major debut

New York: Daniel Chopra ensured an Indian interest for the third major in a row as he made the field for the PGA Championship, the last of the four golf majors in the season. 

Chopra, who will be making his debut in a major, got in as Paul McGinley of Ireland withdrew to be with friend Darren Clarke, who lost his wife to cancer on Sunday. Earlier this year, Jeev Milkha Singh and Jyoti Randhawa played at the US Open, while Shiv Kapur made his major debut at the British Open. (PTI)

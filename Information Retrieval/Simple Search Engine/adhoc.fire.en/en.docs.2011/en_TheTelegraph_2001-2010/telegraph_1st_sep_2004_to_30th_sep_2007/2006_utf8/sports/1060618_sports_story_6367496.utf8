 Portugal improved with Decos 

 return

 - Luck didnt favour fighting iranians

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

A breathtaking strike from Deco 

 and Cristiano Ronaldos maiden goal in World Cup finals 

 were enough for Portugal to see off the dogged Iranians 

 on Saturday and move into the knock-out stage. 

If you look at history, this is for the first time in 40 years that Portugal made it to Round II, and the chief architect behind the feat was none other than Deco, the Barcelona midfielder who had missed the opening tie against Angola due to injury. 

A sense of uncertainty as well as a resolve to hog the limelight are accompanying factors for any key player returning to action from injury. Look at Rooney or Messi: Their enthusiasm and willingness to go for every ball and be at every position is thus a natural thing. Compared to the younger duo, Deco is more experienced, but his keenness to grab the worlds attention while he is in the middle, is similar in nature. 

Importantly for Luiz Felippe Scolari, Deco succeeded in providing the spark and in the end, proved to be the key man against Angola on Sunday last and again versus Iran on Saturday. 

In Deco, Figo found the right companion in decentralising the game from both sides. They switched the flanks so fast that the opponents were hardly aware of who was coming up from where. There was more mobility in the midfield, leading to creation of quite a number of chances. Its a pity that Scolaris side had to wait for 63 minutes before Deco broke the deadlock. 

If the goal is all about Decos individual brilliance ? a scorching right-footer from near the top box ? Figo set it up to perfection. The Portugal captain could have easily passed it to the advancing Ronaldo on the left, but his vision and football sense helped him see the untreaded path, where Deco was lurking unchallenged. These are the qualities which elevate a player from the humdrum to the heavenly and Figo certainly belongs to this class. 

I must admire Iran for not suffering from an inferiority complex while playing against one of the top teams. They, in fact, came close to scoring on at least three occasions. But it was one of those days when you did everything but never got the desired result. 

Figo eventually sealed their fate by earning a penalty for his team and Ronaldo scored from the spot-kick in the 79th minute. The Manchester United strikers goal could be the catalyst in getting back his confidence. 

May be his tendency of playing fancy and keeping the ball too much in possession were all in search of the elusive goal. Once it is achieved, we may see a more aggressive Ronaldo in the matches to come. 

 In Germany, he is yet to match his performance in 

 Manchester United colour. But at least in the second match, 

 he showed signs of improving.

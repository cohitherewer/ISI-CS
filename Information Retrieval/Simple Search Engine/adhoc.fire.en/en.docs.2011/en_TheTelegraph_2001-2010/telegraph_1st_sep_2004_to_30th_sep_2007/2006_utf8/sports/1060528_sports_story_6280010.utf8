 Mongia shines for Leicester

 County Championship

 London: Dinesh Mongia continued 

 to prove his worth for Leicestershire, coming up with two 

 valuable contributions to take his team out of a tricky 

 situation in the Division II County Championship match against 

 Somerset.

 Leading the side, Mongia scored 

 41 in the first innings of the four-day encounter at Taunton 

 which helped his side reach a modest total of 254. Wicketkeeper-batsman 

 Paul Nixon was the top-scorer with 72.

 The hosts responded with 314, 

 taking a first innings lead of 60. Arul Suppiah missed the 

 century by one run while England allrounder Ian Blackwell 

 contributed 49.

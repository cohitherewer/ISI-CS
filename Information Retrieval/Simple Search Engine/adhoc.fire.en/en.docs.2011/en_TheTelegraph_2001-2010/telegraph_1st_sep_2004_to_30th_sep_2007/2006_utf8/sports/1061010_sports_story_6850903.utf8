The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Satisfied with security, says Ponting

 - Australia checking claims of Ashes plot 

 Ponting 

Sydney: Australian officials on Monday said a reported plot to kill the Australian and English cricket teams at the Ashes last year was a stark reminder that sporting events could become the next big terrorist target. 

Australian players and officials said they had no idea about a plot reported by a London newspaper that two of the suicide bombers in the attacks on Londons transit system last year had also discussed gassing the dressing rooms of both teams at Edgbaston. 

Australian officials said security for the next Ashes series, to be held November-January throughout the country, was being boosted to combat the threat of terrorism. 

Prime Minister John Howard said Australian and British authorities were checking the report but said it was the first he had heard of any such plot. 

Ive checked and we certainly werent told that, Howard told reporters. 

It may not be accurate to report were investigating. Our people are talking to their British colleagues and if theres any further information it will be brought to light, he said. 

Less than two weeks ago, Howard warned that two stadiums that were packed with fans for separate football code finals could be prime targets for terrorist attacks, though he added there was no specific intelligence of a plot. 

Australia captain Ricky Ponting said his team was satisfied with the security measures taken by his countrys cricket authorities, which had a track record of keeping us informed and acting on security information when and if the situation warrants. 

We are totally confident in the security precautions Cricket Australia and the Australian Cricketers Association take on our behalf, Ponting said in a statement from India, where the team is preparing for the Champions Trophy tournament. 

Of the report, Ponting said, we were very comfortable with the security arrangements that were in place during the recent Ashes tour and we continue to trust the security information provided to us by Cricket Australia.

 Sandipan best among Indians

 - GIBRALTAR CHESS 

 Sandipan defeated Nicolas Speck 

Gibraltar: Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly missed out on his chance to be among the prize winners by a whisker by going down to second seeded GM Vladimir Akopian of Armenia in the 10th and final round of Gibtele.Com Masters Chess Tournament here. 

Bulgarian and former world junior champion Kiril Georgiev emerged as the champion after an easy draw with GM Emil Sutovsky of Israel in the final round. 

Georgiev scored 8.5 points out of a possible 10 and won the winners purse of 6000 pounds sterling (Rs 4.5 lakh approx) for his effort. 

Britains GM Nigel Short and Sutovsky, who both scored an identical 7.5 points, shared the second place to go home richer by 3500 pounds each. Short lived up to expectations as he defeated GM Mohammed al-Modaihki of Qatar. 

Sandipan Chanda emerged as the best Indian performer in the event after beating Nicolas Speck of Australia who earlier made his International Master norm in the event. 

Winning a fine middle game with white pieces out of a kings Indian Defence game, Sandipan ended up with 6.5 points and stands to gain 11-Elo rating points from the event. 

Also ending on 6.5 points was IM and GM norm holder S. Kidambi who picked up in the event after an indifferent start. 

However, since his opposition was not good enough, Kidambi will lose a few rating points. In the last round game, Kidambi defeated Van den Bresselaar of Holland. 

Surya Sekhar definitely had his chances against Akopian who employed the closed Ruy Lopez as white. It was a tense middle game after the Armenian sacrificed a piece for just two pawns on the queen side and Surya Sekhar had things under control till such time he allowed a simple tactical trick that resulted in loss of extra piece. The Indian resigned on his 33rd turn. 

GM Tejas Bakre was comprehensively beaten by Swiss GM Yannick Pelletier. 

Saptarshi Roy Chowdhury drew with compatriot Kruttika Nadig and Abhijit Kunte met a similar fate against Viktorija Cmilyte of Lithuania. Swati Ghate held GM Peter Wells of England in a creditable fashion.

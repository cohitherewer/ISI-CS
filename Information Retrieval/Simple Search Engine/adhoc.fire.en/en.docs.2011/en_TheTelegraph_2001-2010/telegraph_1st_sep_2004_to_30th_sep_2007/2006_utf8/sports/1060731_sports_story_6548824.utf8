 Dutch reign supreme 

Terrassa: The Netherlands beat Germany 2-1 on Sunday to capture the mens Champions Trophy in field hockey for a record-tying eighth time after going unbeaten in the six-nation tournament. 

Taeke Taekema scored on his second penalty corner, spearing a flick through the German defense to give the Dutch a 1-0 lead. 

Floris Evers went close a few minutes later with a run into the circle from the left side, fooling several German defenders but not the goalkeeper. 

Three minutes before the break, Teun de Nooijer scored with a brilliant individual effort. The reigning world hockey Player of the Year shot from the top of the circle. Germany captain Timo Wess scored with a penalty corner variation five minutes after half-time. 

The Germans pressed the Dutch defense for much of the second-half but could not score. Tibor Weissenborn went close twice in the final 15 minutes but his shots were well covered by Netherlands goalkeeper Guus Vogels or the last line of Netherlands defence. 

Earlier, Spain took the bronze by beating defending champions Australia 5-4 on penalty strokes after a 2-2 draw. Pakistan beat Argentina 3-1 to take fifth place. (AP)

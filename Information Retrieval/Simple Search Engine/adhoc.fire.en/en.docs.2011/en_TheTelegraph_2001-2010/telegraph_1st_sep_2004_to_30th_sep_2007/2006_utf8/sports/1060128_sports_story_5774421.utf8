The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sea Legend may do the trick 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Four of the seven horses ? Sea Legend, Daring Don, Senor Pele and Serrafina ? have credentials to land the 1,200m Calcutta Champions Sprint Trophy, the main attraction in Saturdays eight event card.

 Terms of the race favour Vijay Singhs Serrafina but Senor Pele and Daring Don have been showing improved form in their recent starts. Sea Legend, on the other hand, has been knocking at the door and the Dipak Karki-trained seven-year-old is endowed with plenty of early speed which may help him outsprint his rivals. Mohammed Islam partners the Warrshaah-River Foyle son.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

New Delhi: Syed Nayeemuddins plan to rebuild the side for Wednesdays Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen is in tatters. Two of his first-team players ? K. Ajayan and Mahesh Gawli ? are doubtful starters, while its more or less certain now that the injured duo of M. Suresh and S. Venkatesh wont make it. 

According to manager P.K. Banerjee, Ajayan has a bruised ligament and will not be fit to play against Yemen. Mahesh has a slight shinbone injury on his right leg. Doctors have advised both players rest, but Mahesh has to be played since we have no replacement for him. 

On Saturday, the squad could not practise in the morning as the AIFF failed to get the Nehru Stadium. In the evening, the team had a three-hour session leaving Suresh, Ajayan and Gawli on the sidelines. 

The Yemenese squad is due to arrive in the capital on Sunday night.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Real world-beaters are those who win in subcontinent

 - England have gone back since summer: Viv 

London: West Indian great Vivian Richards has said that England could call themselves world-beaters only when they win a series in subcontinent. 

Richards said that beating India and Pakistan on their soil is the hardest task in cricket and Englands ego since winning the Ashes last year has been dented by the series loss in Pakistan and the second Test defeat against India in Mohali. 

Its all well and good winning a series at home against the best in the world as they did in the Ashes. But you only become great when the odds are really stacked against you and you come out on top, Richards was quoted as saying on BBC. 

As it stands, England have gone backwards quite a bit since the summer. 

I remember India and Pakistan were really hard places to tour ? the hardest in the game in fact, he said. Its not just that their teams are so hard to beat. The conditions are tough and generally most of the team are ill. 

When you overcome that ? what I like to call beating a bad dog in his backyard ? only then do you become real world-beaters. 

He, however, had words of praise for Andrew Flintoff. Ive been watching Freddie (Flintoff) on TV and he sounds really pumped up, he said. Its a really tough ask to win but I wouldnt put anything past him. 

Hes a really magnificent player and, at times, its like a mirror of Ian Botham. I always felt Freddie had really underachieved but now hes superb in every game.

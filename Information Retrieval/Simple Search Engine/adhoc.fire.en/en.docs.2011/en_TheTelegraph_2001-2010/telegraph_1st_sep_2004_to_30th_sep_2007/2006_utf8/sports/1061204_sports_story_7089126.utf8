 India lose final one-dayer, too

 - Shaun Pollock named Man of the Match and Series; Sachins effort goes in vain

Centurion: India were outplayed by a clinical South Africa who inflicted a huge nine-wicket defeat on the visitors for a 4-0 whitewash in the one-day International series on Sunday. 

After restricting India to 200 for nine on an easy-paced track, the South Africans overhauled the target without breaking a sweat in just 31.2 overs at the Supersport Park. 

And while the South Africans were coasting to victory, a section of Indian supporters chanted hai-hai. 

Ab de Villiers, promoted to open for the first time in the series, remained unbeaten on 92, while skipper Graeme Smith finally struck form to score 79 and make a mockery of the seemingly competitive target. 

The two completely overshadowed the efforts of Sachin Tendulkar, who laboured to a 97-ball 55, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (44) the duo ensuring India touched the 200-run mark for the first time in the series. 

The comprehensive win in the fifth and final match of the series (the first tie was washed out) ensured South Africa would go into the three-Test series, starting on December 15 with their confidence sky high. 

Also boosting their morale would be the fact that all their four wins were facile with the victory margins being 157, 106 and 80 runs before Sundays humiliation. Shaun Pollock, for his brilliant bowling in the match and throughout the series a haul of 10 wickets at a very low cost was named both Man of the Match and the Series. 

Smith, so far struggling against Zaheer Khan in the series, came into his own in sunny conditions and a flat pitch by belting 79 runs from 85 balls with seven fours and three sixes. 

The captain, who chose not to face the first ball by Zaheer, departed in the 29th over, hoisting Harbhajan to long-on fielder but by then it was all over for the Indians. 

It was De villiers though who cut loose from the very beginning, driving and pulling the Indian medium-pacers, though he had a slice of luck when dropped by Mohammed Kaif at covers off Sreesanth on eight runs. 

Stand-in captain Virender Sehwag turned to his spinners as a last resort as early as in the ninth over. But both Anil Kumble and Harbhajan made little impression. 

Smith was to find his feet soon and once came down the track to loft Harbhajan for a six, followed by two more during his knock. 

De Villiers clobbered 12 fours and a six in his 98-ball knock. 

Irfan Pathan was badly exposed on a slow batting wicket and was collared for 48 runs in his six overs. 

Put in to bat, India were reduced to 18 for two before being rescued by Tendulkars gritty half century. 

Tendulkar put on 85 runs from 149 balls with Dinesh Mongia (41) for the third wicket but that didnt proved enough. 

In fact, the Indians touched the 200-run mark for the first time in the series due to Dhoni whose 49-ball knock included two fours and two sixes. 

Pollock was once again at the forefront with figures of two for 17 from his 10 overs and was well supported by Makhaya Ntini (three for 32) and Andre Nel (one for 34). 

India were rocked early in their innings by Pollock who picked up Virender Sehwag (11) and VVS Laxman (0) off successive balls. 

Tendulkar and Mongia then dropped anchor, but so did the scoring with only one run coming between the 10th and 15th overs. 

Tendulkar blossomed with the introduction of left-arm spinner Robin Peterson and hit him for four fours in five overs. In between, he received a sharp blow to his left-forearm from Nel that needed medical attention on the field. 

He was jittery again once the pacemen were brought back and was brilliantly caught at covers by De Villiers after making 55 from 97 balls with eight fours. 

Mongia dug in but was dismissed in the 38th over after making 41 from 89 balls with three fours. 

Zaheer hit an enormous six off Ntini in the final over to take the visitors to 200.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 East to start sans Sourav

 - DEODHAR TROPHY

 Indore: East Zone will 

 take on South Zone without former Indian skipper Sourav 

 Ganguly in the Deodhar Trophy one-day match to be played 

 here on Saturday at the Usha Raje Cricket Ground.

 Our team is fit and the 

 match will be thrilling as the wicket is a scoring wicket, 

 East Zone captain Deep Dasgupta said after the practise 

 session on Friday.

 He also said that in the Duleep 

 Trophy his side has performed well and reached up to the 

 finals and that put it in an advantageous position over 

 South Zone.

 Referring to Sourav, who is not 

 in the squad for the first Test against England, East Zone 

 manager Samir Dasgupta said it was decided earlier itself 

 that Sourav will not be playing in the first two matches.

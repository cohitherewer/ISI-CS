 Took it as a first-class game: Sreesanth

 - A good first day in office for the two test Debutants 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Nagpur: There have been only a handful of occasions when a cricketer makes his debut in both one-day Internationals and Tests at the same venue. Sreesanth belongs to this rare category. He first wore the national colour under Rahul Dravid at the VCA Stadium here, in the first of the six-ODI series against Sri Lanka on October 25. 

A little over three months down the line, he was again at the same end of the same ground, this time bowling the second over against Alastair Cook of England, another debutant. 

The youthful energy was obvious in him sooner than later when the Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar cautioned him for treading the danger zone, but Sreesanth didnt seem to mind that. Its a worry, but I was confident I wouldnt repeat it, he said after returning the impressive figures of 18-4-56-2 on Day I of the first Test. 

But the sheer joy of taking the first wicket in the match meant that he was ready to compensate with anything. 

It was a great feeling getting the first wicket. I just kept doing the basics well. I thanked God after getting the first wicket, quipped Indias third Test debutant at the VCA Stadium ? after Ambar Roy and Sarandeep Singh. 

You can say the first wicket was well-planned. I was just looking to basically bowl a good line and the ball went to second slip, he said with a boyish smile. 

According to Sreesanth, the youngsters in the team have added to healthy competition and as long as we serve the teams cause, its not a worry who is replacing whom. 

He also added that he had received a lot of support from his teammates, who kept encouraging him throughout the days play. Dravid said, enjoy the game and believe in yourself. Those are just normal words, but it matters a lot, he maintained. But I took it as just another first class game and just went out and enjoyed myself. The important thing I have learnt is that you need to have persistence. You need to have faith in yourself. 

Had VVS Laxmans dropping Kevin Pietersen disappointed him? As a bowler, you have to have a big heart. These are part of the game and you should have this confidence that you can produce another wicket-taking delivery, he signed off.

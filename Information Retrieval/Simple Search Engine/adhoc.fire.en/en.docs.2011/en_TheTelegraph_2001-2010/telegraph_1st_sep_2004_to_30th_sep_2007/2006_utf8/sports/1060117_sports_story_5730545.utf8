 World feats by Haile

Los Angeles: Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie broke the world half marathon record by 21 seconds when he clocked 58:55 in Phoenix on Sunday. 

The 32-year-old two-time Olympic 10,000m champion also bettered the world 20km road record with a time of 55:48 en route to his half-marathon record. 

This is so fantastic, Gebrselassie said in a statement provided by organisers. This is my first record in America. It is really something special. Im so happy. 

The records were the 19th and 20th world marks for the four-time world 10,000m champion who excelled on the track before turning to road racing. 

Kenyan Samuel Wanjiru set the previous half-marathon record of 59:16 in Rotterdam on September 11 last year, while Kenyas Paul Tergat held the previous 20km record of 56:18 set in Milan on April 4, 1998. (REUTERS)

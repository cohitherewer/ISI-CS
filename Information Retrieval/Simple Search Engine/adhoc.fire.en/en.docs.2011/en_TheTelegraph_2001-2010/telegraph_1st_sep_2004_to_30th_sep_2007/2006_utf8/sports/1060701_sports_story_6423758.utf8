Wimbledon: After four days without a significant upset, four top players were eliminated at Wimbledon on Friday ? including former champion Martina Hingis. 

Hingis, the 1997 winner who is in the midst of a comeback after three years off the tour, squandered a 3-0 lead in the third set and fell 5-7, 6-3, 4-6 to Japans Ai Sugiyama. 

Fourth-seeded David Nalbandian, runner-up in 2002, lost 6-7 (9-11), 6-7 (9-11), 2-6 to 30th-ranked Fernando Verdasco of Spain in the third round. 

 Womens No. 5 Svetlana Kuznetsova, a former US Open champion and finalist at the French Open three weeks ago, was ousted 6-3, 2-6, 3-6 by Li Na, who became the first Chinese woman to reach the fourth round at Wimbledon. 

Eighth-seeded James Blake faded against 53rd-ranked Max Mirnyi of Belarus and lost in five sets ? extending the Americans record in five-setters to 0-9. Blake won just nine points in the last set as Mirnyi pulled away for a 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 6-1, 6-0 victory. 

The 12th-seeded Hingis was one of only three womens champions in the draw, along with three-time winner Venus Williams and 2004 champ Maria Sharapova. She has made a strong return since her long layoff due to foot and ankle injuries. 

But Hingis couldnt put away the 18th-seeded Sugiyama, who had lost six of her previous seven matches to the Swiss player. 

Earlier, top seed Roger Federer sauntered into the last 16 on Friday with a regulation 6-3, 7-6, 6-4 victory over Frenchman Nicolas Mahut. 

His 44th consecutive grasscourt victory was never really in doubt against the 24-year-old former Wimbledon junior champion and he spent most of the match in cruise control.

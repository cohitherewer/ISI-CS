 Ballacks move only for cash, says Bayern

 - Transfer to Chelsea

 TIM RICH

 Ballack

Michael Ballacks move to Chelsea was motivated solely by money rather than the Germany captains desire to improve himself as a footballer, Bayern Munich alleged on Tuesday. 

In a stinging attack on the 29-year-old, Bayern general manager Uli Hoeness confirmed that Ballacks move to Stamford Bridge was a done deal. It was always clear that Michael did not want to learn a new language or new culture but a new currency. It was obviously only about money. 

[A Reuters copy on Wednesday, however, says that Ballack is in advanced negotiations with Chelsea, according to his agent. Rejecting criticism from Hoeness that Ballack was primarily interested in money, Michael Becker told a newspaper that Bayern had treated Ballack unfairly in their talks to extend his contract. 

[This comment is without foundation, he said, referring to Hoeness remark. Money is not the issue in the price category that Michael is in. He will be making a decision based on sporting considerations. We are in serious negotiations with Chelsea in London.] 

Admitting that a club who have won the European Cup four times could not compete with a Roman Abramovich-funded Chelsea, Hoeness said: I have absolutely no animosity towards Michael but he should have been honest and said he was leaving because he wanted to earn more money. 

The money that Ballack will earn is substantial, although the four-year contract he will sign is said to be highly complicated. However, with Chelsea switching kit suppliers to Adidas, who sponsor Ballack, his advisers expect him to earn nearly ?30 million in salary and advertising tie-ins during his four years in London. 

The Bayern coach, Felix Magath, said the club had put forward many arguments to Ballack to remain in Bavaria. He had a unique position in the team that he will struggle to build up elsewhere, Magath said. 

We said it would not be easy to move with three young children far from Lake Starnberg [where Ballack lives] to a foreign city in a foreign country and I never really imagined that Michael would go through with it.

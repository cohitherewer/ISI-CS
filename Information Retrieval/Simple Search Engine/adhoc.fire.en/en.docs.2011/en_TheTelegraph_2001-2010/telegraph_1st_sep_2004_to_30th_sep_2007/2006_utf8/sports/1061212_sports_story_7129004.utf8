 Dalmiya files suit

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former president Jagmohan Dalmiya Monday filed a suit in the city civil court challenging the BCCIs notice to hold a special general meeting in Jaipur on Saturday to decide on the action against him for alleged financial irregularities. Dalmiya sought a stay on holding of the SGM. 

Dalmiya challenged the legality of the disciplinary committee and also the convening of a special general meeting. 

Agencies add: The Madras High Court may take up for hearing Monday a petition of the CAB seeking a direction to restrain the BCCI from convening any special general body meeting on Saturday. 

The CAB filed a petition in the court on December 7 seeking the direction. 

Among other things, the suit prayed for a declaration that No. 27, 38 (IV) and 41 of the rules and regulations of the BCCI, as ultra vires of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act and sought a direction to restrain the board from permitting anyone else except its members from participating in the voting in any special general meeting. 

The petitioner contended that the BCCI introduced rules 38 (iv), 27 and 41 with an ulterior motive and in total disregard of the rules.

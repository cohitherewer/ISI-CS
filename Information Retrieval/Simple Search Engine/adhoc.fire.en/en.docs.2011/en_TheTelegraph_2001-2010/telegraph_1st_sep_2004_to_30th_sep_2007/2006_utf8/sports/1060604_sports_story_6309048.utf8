 Jyoti, Jeev manage cut 

London: Jyoti Randhawa and Jeev Milkha Singh squeezed into the weekend rounds of the Celtic Manor Wales Open by a slender margin, being right on the cutline of the event. 

Randhawa overcame a double bogey on 14th after starting at the 10th. He also bogeyed 11th and seventh, while scoring birdies at fifth, 12th and 16th to card a one-over 70 and just made the cut. A birdie on the 16th saved the day for Jeev as he made it into the weekend rounds.

 Windies mull tri-series involving India

St Johns: The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) is contemplating hosting a tri-series involving India and Sri Lanka before the World Cup in March next year. The West Indies team manager Tony Howard said though the plan was not concrete, yet the WICB hopes that it would work. 

We (management team) have sent in some proposals to the West Indies Cricket Board and whether or not they will be on the cards, Im not sure, but the proposals are in and we are hoping they would work, Howard was quoted as saying in a Jamaican newspaper on Thursday. 

He said the tri-series would provide some good practice for the West Indians before the mega event. 

Meanwhile, West Indies cricketers have threatened to pull out of the one-day series against India, scheduled to be held in Canada, after their cricket board disregarded the recent agreement signed with the players association.

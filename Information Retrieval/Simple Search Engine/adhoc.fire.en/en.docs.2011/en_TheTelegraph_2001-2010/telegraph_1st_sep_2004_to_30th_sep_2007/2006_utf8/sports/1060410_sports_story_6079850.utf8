 Sandipan halts Humpy

 National A Chess

 Visakhapatnam: Grandmaster 

 Sandipan Chanda provided the proverbial twist in the tale 

 of 43rd National A chess championship with a brilliant victory 

 over sole leader GM Koneru Humpy in the ninth round here 

 on Sunday.

 Having started off with five wins 

 on the trot and being in lead from the beginning, it turned 

 out to be a major blow for Humpy as defending champion GM 

 Surya Sekhar Ganguly and IM Deepan Chakravarthy overtook 

 her on the points table.

 Both Deepan and Surya Sekhar are 

 on seven points out of a possible nine, while Humpy is on 

 6.5.

 It means Humpy can be considered 

 on a par with the two leaders as she has played one game 

 less in this 21-player event, in which every player gets 

 a bye sooner or later.

 Amongst the two leaders, Deepan 

 almost made his GM norm and is now set to become the next 

 GM of the country. As per rules, he has finished all formalities 

 but he still has to meet one more GM in the next round. 

 Deepan will face Surya Sekhar 

 next and even a loss should ensure his norm.

 The surprising results of D.P. 

 Singh continued as he accounted for S. Arun Prasad in spectacular 

 fashion from a technical position. The Jharkhand talent 

 is on six points and in sole fourth spot.

 In the womens championship, 

 Woman Grandmaster Swati Ghate came back to her winning ways 

 and downed tail-ender Soumya Swaminathan in a one sided 

 affair.

 Ghate took her tally to six points 

 out of a possible eight in this section and is now trailed 

 by top-seeded IM S. Vijayalakshmi, who is a full point behind.

 In the eighth round, Vijayalakshmi 

 defeated I. Aiswarya Shobhana who was left on 4.5 points. 

 Vijayalakshmis younger sister WGM S. Meenakshi also 

 registered a fine win over Alka Das.

 D. Harika had it easy against 

 Amruta Mokal, but defending champion Nisha Mohota had to 

 split the point with WGM Eesha Karavade.

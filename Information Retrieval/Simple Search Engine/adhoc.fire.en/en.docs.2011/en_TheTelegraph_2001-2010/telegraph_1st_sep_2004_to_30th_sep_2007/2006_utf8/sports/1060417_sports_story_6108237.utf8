 Mediamen injured 

Chittagong: At least 10 local media representatives at the second Test were injured in clashes with police, witnesses said on Sunday. One was being operated on locally for a suspected haemorrhage and another was rushed to Dhaka with head injuries. 

About 20 officers with batons damaged cameras and clashed with around 50 reporters and photographers who were protesting by the side of pitch outside the press box during the lunch break on Day I. They were upset over an incident before play began when a policeman assaulted a photographer in a row over using transport in the restricted stadium vicinity. 

The Bangladesh Sports Journalists Association said in a statement it would boycott the Test and ODI series if the policemen involved in the clashes were not punished. (Reuters)

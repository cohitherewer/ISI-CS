The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fresh turn in battle for supremacy

 - 2010 C'wealth Games

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The constant battle for supremacy between the Commonwealth Games committee and the government over the preparations of the Games seems to be the main reason behind Union sports minister Mani Shankar Aiyers outburst against the billion dollar sporting extravaganza to be hosted in the capital in 2010. 

While the minister on Wednesday questioned the need of spending so much money in organising the Commonwealth Games and said it could be spent better on developing sporting infrastructure across the country, officials of the Games committee felt all the minister wanted was more say in conducting the Games. 

Though no senior official was ready to go on record, all felt it was unwarranted. There is no point talking about Rs 5000 crores being wasted on the Games, said an official, who did not wish to be named. 

The government has earmarked around Rs 800 crores for the conduct of the Games, the official added. The money would be returned as the Games is expected to generate around Rs 1000 crore. Around Rs 5000 crore is needed to build the infrastructure. But that was agreed upon by the government itself. 

Another official of the Games committee felt that government perhaps wanted a bigger role. 

The Group of Ministers for Commonwealth Games has clearly opined that the Games committee should be given the priority. The sports ministry feels it has been completely ignored and sidelined. 

Aiyer said that the Commonwealth Games are for the elite and they are the ones who grab most of the natural resources. A Games official said that the minister was expecting to divert some of the funds to rural front, which got negated by the government. 

One should not forget the sports minister is also the panchayat raj minister. Probably, some of his plans have got shelved because of this.

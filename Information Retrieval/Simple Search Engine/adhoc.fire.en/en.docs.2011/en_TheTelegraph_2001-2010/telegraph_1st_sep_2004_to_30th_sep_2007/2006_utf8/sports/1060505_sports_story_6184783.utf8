 Joe Cole ready to fill void 

WILLIAM JOHNSON 

London: Joe Cole has offered to fill Wayne Rooneys explosive but flimsy boots at the World Cup finals. Cole on Wednesday sent a positive message to Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

I would be honoured to step into Waynes shoes, he said. I would play anywhere the manager wants me to play... If he wants me to play that role for England then I will. 

 Cole, who with 28 appearances has one more cap than 

 Rooney but has contributed only four goals to the Manchester 

 United strikers 10, admits: I am a different 

 sort of player to Wayne. He is his own man and a great player, 

 but I would give it a go and do my best for the team.

 Edmilson ruled out

Weggis: Brazil dropped FC Barcelona 

 midfielder Edmilson from its World Cup squad on Wednesday 

 because of a knee injury. 

Sao Paulo midfielder Mineiro will replace Edmilson, who was suffering pain in his right knee since Brazils second practice here. 

Examinations showed he would not be able to recover in time to play in the World Cup, Brazil doctor Jose Luiz Runco said at a news conference. 

He was undergoing treatment and had improved, but he felt pain again during the match and we decided to do a more complete examination, Runco said. 

The results showed the injury is not compatible with his participation in the World Cup. 

Edmilson replaced Ze Roberto in the 66th minute of Brazils 8-0 win against Swiss club FC Lucerne in a warm-up on Tuesday. 

Runco said Edmilson has a tear in his right-knee meniscus, an injury that he probably suffered before making the national team. 

 The announcement to Edmilson was made by doctors, 

 along with coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, assistant coach 

 Mario Zagallo and team captain Cafu.

 Gout kept Kewell out

Stuttgart: A bout of gout sidelined Australian winger Harry Kewell at the World Cup, leaving the Liverpool star on crutches as the Socceroos lost 0-1 to Italy on a last-second penalty that ended their tournament. 

Hes in a lot of pain. He cant walk, said defender Scott Chipperfield, who spilled the beans on the reason for Kewells absence while speaking to reporters after the game. 

 He got an inflammation of his joint. Thats why he was on crutches because it takes off a little bit of the weight off his ankle, Chipperfield said.

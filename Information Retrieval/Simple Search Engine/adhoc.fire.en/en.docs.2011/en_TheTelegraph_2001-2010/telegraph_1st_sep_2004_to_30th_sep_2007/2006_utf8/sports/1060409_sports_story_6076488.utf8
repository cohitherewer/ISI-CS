 Juniors not treated well by clubs: Akhmedov 

 - India coach cautiously optimistic

New Delhi: Sitting in Chittagong, Uzbek coach Islam Akhmedov is a tense man on the eve of Indias AFC Challenge Cup quarter-final match against Nepal on Sunday, but allowed himself a smile when asked about the derby clash in Calcutta. 

We have a young and inexperienced side. So I am not sure about tomorrows outcome. But I felt happy when I came to know that East Bengal have decided to field Habibur Rehman Mondal against Mohun Bagan, Akhmedov told The Telegraph from Chittagong. 

In India, the problem is that the juniors are not treated well by the clubs, he said. I feel hurt when I find NFL clubs hardly using talented juniors like Jerry Jirsangha, Malswamtulunga, Debabrata Roy or Habibur. You need a good club and good league for the progress of the national team. 

On Sundays match, Akhmedov said he was cautiously optimistic. Out of the 16 teams in the competition, 15 are senior sides. Only we have brought the junior side. So far, these boys have performed well, but I am afraid they will be lost in the crowd once they return to India. They will only get to warm the reserve benches of the top NFL teams. 

In the three group league matches, India won the opener against Afghanistan 2-0 and drew the other two against The Philippines (1-1) and Chinese Taipei (0-0) with striker Vimal Pariyar scoring all the goals. 

We could have beaten Chinese Taipei, but preferred to play defensive, Akhmedov claimed. All we needed was a draw to top the group. 

Against Nepal, India will miss midfielder Xavier Vijay Kumar, who is down with a thigh injury. Goalkeeper Shilton Paul, who has enjoyed a great run so far, may also sit out because of an ankle sprain. In that case, Pauls TFA teammate, Arindam Sarkar may get to play his first match of the tournament. 

None of my players are from any top NFL side. Their average age is 19. They have played three matches, that, too, under scorching sun at 3pm, Akhmedov said. Win or loss, to me they are unsung heroes.

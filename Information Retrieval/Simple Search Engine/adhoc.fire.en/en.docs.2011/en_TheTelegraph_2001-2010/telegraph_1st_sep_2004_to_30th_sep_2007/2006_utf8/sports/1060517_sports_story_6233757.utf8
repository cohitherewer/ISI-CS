 Jeev still No.1

Kuala Lumpur: Jeev Milkha Singh held on to his lead on the Asian Tours Order of Merit, which sees Shiv Kapur in the 13th place. 

Jeev had a productive week with fifth-place finish at the Japan PGA Championship in Gifu where he earned $ 442,526 in the season so far. A bulk of it came as a result of his title win at the Volvo China Open last month. Koreas Charlie Wi stayed in second with $ 329,758 while Australian Andrew Buckle was in third place with $ 280,212.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A day of rare feat 

 STAR RACER

 Trebles and quadruples of wins have been a regular feature in the past for horseowner MAM Ramaswamy. January 18 was, however, a special day for the south Indian baron. His horses won everything on the card ? a total of seven events, to leave the rival quarters sulking. Although his own colours ? gold-and-brown-belt ? won two races, and son MAMR Muthiah struck four, besides his trusted lieutenant, RM Lakshmanan winning one, it was an open secret as to who was the boss.

 What was equally important was that all his winners delivered the goods in an authoritative manner. However, the two professionals, trainer Daniel David and jockey Imran Chisty, who were chiefly responsible for making the history, remained unsung heroes at the end of the day. The jockey-trainer combo notched up a five-win haul each.

 Chisty set the ball rolling from the start with the expected victory of Errol Bhungards Regal Venture, who cas-hed in on his eye-catching second the previous week. F..Rodrigues Universal Prince also followed suit, winning the next event without much ado. The horse had plenty in the toe, which he was made to waste over longer trips than 1,100 metres.

 There was a brief pause for Chisty in the third race, which saw G. Ross getting a virtual armchair ride on another of Daniels favourite, Star Phoenix in the main event, the 2,200m Pearson Surita Memorial Cup. Chisty was back in action to help Daniel win the Supernova Cup with debutante Notable Guest making short work of the opposition, which also included a heavily backed Vijay Singhs youngster, Awesome Dasher.

 Talent Unlimited and Wild Flowers ? both favourites in their respective events ? also went kindly for the enterprising duo.

 Earlier on Friday, Daniel had to contend with a brace of winners ? King Is Born and Pure Valour. However, element of luck played a greater role in their victories. King Is Born saw hot-favourite, Asterisk, bursting blood vessels when poised to win the Regal Star Cup. Pure Valour, on the other hand, managed to push Ciraja out of contention before registering his win. The stewards room ordeal also went against Ciraja.

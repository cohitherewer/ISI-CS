The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tri-series almost confirmed

 - Will be part of Champions Trophy build-up 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Its more or less confirmed that India will feature in a tri-series, with world champions Australia and the West Indies being the other teams, before the October 15-November 5 Champions Trophy. 

Its going to be held overseas, but will be a Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) venture. 

Yes, its almost certain? However, the picture is going to be clear after 48 hours once negotiations with different parties have been completed, former BCCI president Inderjit Singh Bindra told The Telegraph. 

Speaking from New Delhi on Friday evening, he added: Mr Lalit Modi (the marketing committee chairman) has been entrusted the task of finalising the venue? The tri-series will either be in Australia or in south-east Asia ? Singapore or Kuala Lumpur? 

That was decided during the marketing sub-committees two-day meeting in the capital, which began on Wednesday. 

Cricket Australia (CA), it may be recalled, has offered three venues ? Brisbane, Darwin and Perth ? but isnt in favour of the September 12-23 window suggested by India. 

Thats because its expected to clash with the closing stages of the Australian Rules Football competition? CA is going to be happier with an end-September start, but our players wont then really have a break before the Champions Trophy? I suppose well be okay with the tri-series finishing latest by October 1, Bindra said. 

Indias first match is on October 15, against England, in Jaipur. 

Earlier, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur had expressed their inability to have floodlights installed before mid-September, but it now seems they could hire them provided theres cost-sharing. 

There are issues to be settled? The idea, quite clearly, is to have the tri-series in a country which is most cost effective, Bindra pointed out. 

Till CA came into the picture, only a bilateral series versus the West Indies was being planned. 

The BCCI, for the record, is committed to helping the West Indies Cricket Board, which is in poor shape financially.

Vadodara: England were grappling with fitness problems ahead of their practice game against a Board Presidents XI beginning here on Thursday, with the climate and conditions getting the better of as many as five of their players. 

Middle-order batsman Paul Collingwood was ruled out as he was yet to recover from the back spasm that he suffered during the warm-up game in Mumbai last week, while four other players were reported sick on the eve of the match at the IPCL Ground. 

Crucially for England, it was their bowling quartet that was laid down by a stomach virus ? reverse swing talent Simon Jones and spinners Shaun Udal, Monty Panesar and Ian Blackwell. 

The visitors will make a decision on their playing XI on Thursday morning. The match is the only first-class fixture ahead of the first Test beginning on March 1 in Nagpur. 

Adapting to the change from the cold weather back home to the tropical heat has been a major challenge for England. 

On the other hand, the host team, led by Venugopal Rao, was in vibrant mood. 

The focus will be on openers Wasim Jaffer and Gautam Gambhir, who will be keen to impress the selectors keeping in mind the Test series versus England. The squad for the first Test will be announced on Thursday, but there are two more to follow. 

Middle-order batsmen Rao, who didnt make the Pakistan-bound squad, and Suresh Raina, who impressed in the recent ODIs, also get a chance to show their mettle. 

Kerala pacer Sreesanth will also be under the scanner. Having had a decent ODI series, a handful of wickets against England wont hurt his chances at all. 

Chairman of Selectors Kiran More, who is coaching the Board XI, said it didnt matter that the squad for the first Test would be announced without looking at the players performance in the match. 

It is a professional game. There is going to be enough opportunity for the lads in the future, he said. 

There is lot of cricket to be played and we want to look at various combinations. It is not for one match or two, and also it is not about picking a 14 or 15. We need 20-25 players as our bench strength. 

The pitch at the IPCL Sport Complex had a tinge of grass and could offer more bounce, just as the Brabourne Stadium pitch did in Englands Tour opener. 

More also revealed the team could play three seamers. 

We want to play fast bowlers rather than the spinners, he said.

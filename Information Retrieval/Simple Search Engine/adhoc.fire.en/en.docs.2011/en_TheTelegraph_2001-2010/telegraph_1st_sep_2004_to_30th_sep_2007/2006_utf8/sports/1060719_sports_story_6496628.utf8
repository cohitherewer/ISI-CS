The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rome: The four top Italian clubs found 

 guilty in the Serie A match-fixing scandal will begin their 

 appeals from July 22, the president of the appeals court 

 has said. ?The appeals process, following the sentences 

 of the sports tribunal, will start on Saturday morning at 

 9 am (local time),? Piero Sandulli told the Italian state 

 broadcaster on Tuesday. Last Friday a sports tribunal ordered 

 Juventus, Fiorentina and Lazio to start next season in Italy?s 

 second-tier Serie B. The fourth side, AC Milan, escaped 

 relegation, but were thrown out of European competition 

 and ordered to start their next campaign minus 15 points. 

 All four have announced their intention to appeal.

 Berlin: Juergen Klinsmann won?t attend 

 the ceremony where he will be awarded Germany?s Federal 

 Order of Merit next month. Klinsmann, 41, quit as Germany 

 coach last week after guiding the national team to a surprising 

 third-place finish at the World Cup. That triggered a wave 

 of national euphoria and Klinsmann was expected to receive 

 the country?s only state decoration on August 14. ?I feel 

 honoured,? Klinsmann was quoted as saying in Tuesday?s edition 

 of Bild. ?But I won?t receive it personally. I still need 

 some space.?

 New York: Former US soccer team manager 

 Bruce Arena was named on Tuesday as head coach of the New 

 York Red Bulls. The 54-year-old Arena will also serve as 

 the Red Bulls? sporting director, overseeing the team?s 

 soccer operations, including the first team, reserve and 

 academy teams and youth development. Arena, the most successful 

 coach in the history of the US men?s side, was told last 

 Friday that his services would not be retained after eight 

 years in the position.

 Madrid: Former Spain boss Javier Clemente 

 said on Tuesday he will take over as head coach of the Serbian 

 national side for the next two years. ?It has been agreed, 

 I?m now coach of Serbia and will coach the side through 

 the qualification for Euro 2008,? Clemente said on Tuesday. 

 The 56-year-old will become the first foreign manager in 

 charge of Serbia, who meet the Czech Republic in a friendly 

 in Prague on August 16 ? their first international as an 

 independent nation since the spilt with Montenegro.

 Indianapolis: Instant replay made its 

 debut on Monday at the RCA Championships, part of the US 

 Open Series. American Paul Goldstein tried out the Hawk-Eye 

 line calling technology by hitting a practice serve that 

 hugged the line. Within seconds, two video boards showed 

 that his shot was just out of bounds. ?The technology is 

 spot-on, so you have the confidence that when a call is 

 made it?s absolute,? Goldstein said. ?Before you might have 

 held reservations with the chair for the next two or three 

 points.? The US Open will be the first Grand Slam event 

 to review disputed calls electronically.

 New Delhi: India has been placed along 

 with Jordan, Lebanon, Japan and Kuwait in group B for the

 Vettori to stay captain

Wellington: Daniel Vettori will lead an unchanged New Zealand side in the second of four limited-overs Internationals against Sri Lanka on Tuesday as captain Stephen Fleming extends a period of paternity leave. 

Fleming missed the first match, won by New Zealand by seven wickets in Queenstown on Saturday, to be with his wife after the birth of their first child on Thursday. 

Coach John Bracewell confirmed Fleming had asked to spend a few more days at home and will not rejoin the New Zealand squad until the third match in his hometown, Wellington, on Friday. 

We continued some momentum from the Australian series but, having said that, Sri Lanka had only just arrived, Bracewell said.

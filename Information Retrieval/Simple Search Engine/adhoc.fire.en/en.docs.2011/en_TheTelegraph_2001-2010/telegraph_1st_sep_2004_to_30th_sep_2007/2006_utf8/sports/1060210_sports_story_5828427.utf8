Zaragoza: Diego Milito smashed in four goals as Real Zaragoza continued their devastating form in the Kings Cup with a 6-1 demolition of Real Madrid in the first leg of their semi-final on Wednesday. 

The inspired Argentine helped himself to a hattrick in less than 20 first-half minutes at La Romareda as Zaragoza inflicted one of the heaviest defeats on a sorry-looking Real Madrid. 

Although Real pulled a goal back to make it 3-1 before the break, Milito scored his fourth 10 minutes after halftime to the delight of the home crowd. 

Militos strike partner Ewerthon also got in on the act when he got his sides fifth soon after and the Brazilian completed the rout with a wonderful half volley seven minutes from time. 

Zaragoza, who smashed four goals past Betis in 12 first-half minutes in their 4-3 league win at the weekend and beat Barcelona 5-4 on aggregate in the last round, were left with one foot in the final of a competition they have won twice in the last five years. 

Victor Munozs side took control from the first whistle with the in-form Cani orchestrating the midfield and stretching the Real defence as he threaded a series of neat passes through to Milito and Ewerthon. It came as little surprise then when the two front men combined to carve open the Real defence in the 15th minute. 

Former Borussia Dortmund player Ewerthon scorched past Ivan Helguera on the right, darted into the area and cut the ball back to Milito who lashed home past a helpless Iker Casillas. 

Seven minutes later the Argentine struck again. This time he stole a march on Roberto Carlos after a quick throw-in, cut inside a despairing Sergio Ramos and beat Casillas at the near post with a sharp finish with the outside of his foot. 

Real were still reeling from the blow when the former Genoa player helped himself to his third, taking advantage of some slack marking from the visiting defence to head home in the 34th minute. 

Just as Real looked as though they were about to fold completely they pulled one back from a cleverly worked set piece, Brazilian forward Julio Baptista powering a header past former Real keeper Cesar after David Beckham had chipped a free kick into the area. 

The fourth goal came from the inspired Milito when he out-jumped the passive Real defence to head home from a corner 10 minutes into the second half. Ewerthon joined in the fun five minutes later when he drilled under Casillas after steaming past the beleaguered Real centre-backs to meet a fine through ball from Cani. 

The Brazilian completed the rout with the most spectacular goal of the night when he sent a swerving half-volley looping over a distraught Casillas to complete one of the heaviest defeats in Reals history. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea romped to a 4-1 home win over Everton in their FA Cup fourth round replay on Wednesday, adds a report from London. 

The London side scored through Arjen Robben, Frank Lampard with a penalty, Hernan Crespo and captain John Terry. Mikel Arteta replied for Everton with a second-half penalty. 

Middlesbrough beat second-division Coventry City in the nights other replay with a 20th minute strike from Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. 

Juventus stretched their Serie A lead on Wednesday despite a 1-1 draw at home to Parma after second-placed Inter Milan lost 2-1 at Fiorentina, adds a report from Rome. 

The results gave Juventus 63 points from 24 matches, nine ahead of Inter, who they meet at the San Siro on Sunday. Third-placed AC Milan (51 points) made up ground on the top two with a 5-0 demolition of Treviso. (Reuters)

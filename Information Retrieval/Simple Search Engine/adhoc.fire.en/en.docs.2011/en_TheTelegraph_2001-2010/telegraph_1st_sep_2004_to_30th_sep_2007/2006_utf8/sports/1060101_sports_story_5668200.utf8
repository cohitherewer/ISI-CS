The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Limited tickets for Indian fans

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: There is bad news for football lovers across the country who wish to go to Germany for the Fifa World Cup. 

The Fifa has issued the All India Football Federation (AIFF) ten tickets each for the opening ceremony, semi-finals and the final. In addition, 250 tickets have also been issued to the AIFF for all the other matches to be played in different stages. 

The amount is much lower than last editions allotment, claim AIFF bosses. 

The AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco, in a letter to his IFA counterpart Subrata Dutta, has said that the final decision on the allotment of tickets will depend on the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Dasmunshi and the executive committee of the national body. 

Meanwhile, Mohun Bagan club has already asked for six tickets for the opening match. 

The AIFF has made it clear that the tickets would be allotted to the members taking into account the respective positions in the club.

Port-of-Spain: Indian batsmen failed to fire yet again in the face of some intelligent bowling by the West Indies in the must-win fourth one-day International at Queens Park Oval here on Friday. 

The Indians, trailing 1-2 in the five-match series, struggled on a slow track while posting a respectable 217 for seven after home captain Brian Lara put them into bat. 

 At 2 am, West Indies were 157 for three after 36 overs. 

 Brian Lara was batting on 53 along with Dwayne Bravo (30). 

 Chris Gayle made 46. Irfan Pathan, Ajit Agarkar and Ramesh 

 Powar claimed one wicket each. 

The Indian innings revolved around half-centuries from Yuvraj Singh (52) and Mohammed Kaif (62) and a late flourish by Mahendra Singh Dhoni (46 ..) to get past the 200-mark. 

Yuvraj and Kaif also put on 80 runs from 98 balls for the fourth wicket to give the Indian total a semblance of competitiveness. 

New ball bowlers Ian Bradshaw (two for 41) and Fidel Edwards (one for 19) did a good job up-front, while Samuels and Gayle did a tidy job. 

Indias inability to get going in the final overs was once again exposed as only 81 runs were scored in the final 15 overs. 

The early moisture on the wicket meant runs were hard to come by and India lost Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid and Suresh Raina for only 47 runs by the 16th over. 

Bradshaw accounted for Sehwag (11) and Raina (7), caught in the cover and in the slips, in his first spell of five overs in which he conceded 20 runs. 

Sehwag, frustrated by the slowness of the track, slammed one on the up and Gayle at extra cover made no mistake with the overhead chance. 

 Sunny lecture 

Sunil Gavaskar will deliver the prestigious third Sonny Ramadhin cricket lecture at the University of the West Indies on May 31. The forum is hosted by the Faculty of Social Sciences of the varsity. 

Inaugurated in April 2004, the lecture series was introduced in the honour of the legendary West Indian cricketer, hailing from central Trinidad. Ramadhin has been living in England for the last 40 years.

Calcutta: Playing at a good pace and utilising most of the scoring chances are the two ingredients for a football match to become worth watching. Both these qualities were present in the ninth round National Football League match for the ONGC Cup in which East Bengal inflicted a 5-3 defeat over Dempo SC at the Salt lake Stadium on Sunday. 

Right from the word go, the red-and-golds led by captain Bhaichung Bhutia went on the rampage, but it was Ndem who put the former champions ahead in the 13th minute. The lead was bolstered in the 24th when an opportunistic Bhaichung pounced on a goalkeeping error. 

But the hosts could enjoy the 2-goal cushion only for 10 minutes till Dempos Majeek Bolajee headed one home utilising a defensive lapse. 

Debabrata Roy then made it 3-1 while Syed Rahim Nabi scored a superb goal to put his team 4-1 up. 

Ranty Martins converted a spot-kick in the 76th minute to reduce the margin, but within a minute Debabrata made it 5-2. Ranty put his name on the scorers list once again five minutes from time. 

The red-and-golds under the coaching of Phillipe de Ridder showed excellent on-field maturity in the last two matches, scoring nine goals but conceding six. From the outset, the hosts went on attack and till the 90th minute they kept the same tempo alive. 

Bhaichung, perhaps, is passing through a phase where he cannot make any mistake. He combined with Ndem and Mike Okoro so well that it made Dempo defenders task tougher as they used the width of the park and started launching attacks from all corners. 

Ndem drew first blood when his well-thought out right footer, after taking a slight deflection, made its way to the goal. 

Later, Bhaichung once again proved his superiority by the way he managed to flick the ball from a difficult angle. It was a treat to watch. 

Ridders bid to tighten the defence didnt work for his side as they conceded all the three goals for defensive lapses. In the 34th minute, the way Bolajee headed home their first goal was a clear example of defensive misunderstanding between stoppers Anupam Sarkar and Guy Marshall. 

Trailing 1-2 after the breather, Dempo tried their hearts out to come back into the game, but got another jolt when substitute Debabrata put one in after a fine exchange with Bhaichung and Dipankar Roy. 

Nabis solo-effort resulted in another goal in the 73rd minute to put East Bengal out of danger. 

But a ray of hope was created for the defending champions when Clifford Miranda was brought down by Anupam inside the box and Dempo was awarded the spot-kick. Ranty made no mistake. 

With the scoreline reading 4-2, no one knew there were two more goals in the offing. Debabrata (Man of the Match) scored his second goal of the match unleashing an immaculate 40-yarder from the left. Lastly, it was Rantys chance to increase his tally by heading in a N. Ravanan floater. 

The win took East Bengal to the second spot with 18 points, one behind leaders Mahindra, while the defending champions remained on 10.

 Mongia hits 165

London: Dinesh Mongia hit 165 to help Leicestershire notch up 417 in the first innings of their Division II County championship match against Essex in Chelmsford on Thursday. 

Leicestershire were all out in 116.4 overs on the second day after resuming on 392 for five. Mongia added seven to his score on Thursday before being trapped leg-before by A. Palladino. 

Essex were in early distress, having been reduced to 43 for four. Mongias 273-ball knock was studded with 21 boundaries and a six. He put on a 170-run partnership with H.D. Ackerman, who made 111 off 191 balls before falling to James Foster on Day I. 

Ackerman had earlier helped stabilise the innings by sharing a 94-run stand with opener with Darren Robinson (53) after the early loss of Darren Maddy. 

The Indian left-hander continued the good work despite seeing John Maunders depart second ball and captain Jeremy Snape for 29.

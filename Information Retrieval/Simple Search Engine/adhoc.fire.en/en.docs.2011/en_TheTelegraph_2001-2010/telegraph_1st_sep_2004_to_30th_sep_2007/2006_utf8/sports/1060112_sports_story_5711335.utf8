Sydney: Lleyton Hewitt shook off a mystery illness to reach the quarter finals of the Sydney International on Wednesday, while injuries piled up ahead of next weeks Australian Open. 

Kim Clijsters, Carlos Moya and Nadia Petrova withdrew from the Australian Open lead-up tournament because of injuries while Daniela Hantuchova retired from her match. 

Clijsters injury appears to be the most serious. The Belgian world No. 2 felt a sharp pain in her hip while warming up to play Italys Francesca Schiavone and is now in danger of missing the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Spains Moya also pulled out of his match with American James Blake because of a hip complaint, while Russian Petrova withdrew from her match with Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne with a groin strain. Slovak Hantuchova failed to finish her match against Czech Nicole Vaidisova on Wednesday, while Hewitt ignored a stomach bug to beat Austrias Jurgen Melzer 6-1, 6-4. 

It wasnt just my stomach, it was my whole body that felt better today (Wednesday). I just felt like I had a lot more energy, Hewitt told a news conference. Who knows exactly what it is, but hopefully its on the mend and keeps improving each day. 

Hewitts centre court match was delayed for an hour and a half because of a violent thunderstorm and he raced through the opening set. 

He recovered from 0-3 down to add the second set in 45 minutes and advance to a quarter final with Andreas Seppi after the Italian beat Australian wildcard Chris Guccione 7-5, 7-6. 

Hewitt has already won the Sydney title four times and has a great chance of winning a fifth with no more seeded players blocking his path to the final. 

Russias former US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova was also in great form, defeating Ana Ivanovic 7-6, 6-3 to reach the semi-finals of the womens tournament where she will play Henin-Hardenne. 

Haas beats Federer 

In Melbourne, Tommy Haas dealt Roger Federers Australian Open warm-up campaign a glancing blow on Wednesday, knocking the Swiss world No. 1 out of title contention at the Kooyong Classic. 

The German belied his world No. 41 ranking with a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 come-back victory under cloudy skies after a morning of rain. 

Both of Haas victories over Federer have come in Australia ? at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and at the Australian Open in 2002. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India berth excites Mary Ann Gomes

 - Im looking forward to watching Anand from close quarters

 Mary Ann Gomes on her return to the city on Wednesday 

Calcutta: More than getting her maiden WGM norm, the thought of representing India along with the likes of Viswanathan Anand, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Koneru Humpy excites Mary Ann Gomes. 

The 17-year-old, who ensured a berth in the Indian womens Olympiad team by taking second place at the Visakhapatnam nationals, arrived in the city on Wednesday afternoon. She also got a 14-game WGM norm in the process. 

I am thrilled to qualify for the Indian team? I will get to see Anand from close quarters. I am also very tense as playing for the country in a team event places a lot of responsibility on your shoulders, Mary Ann said. 

The Olympiad is scheduled in Turin from May 20. 

Mary Ann, who had grabbed headlines in The Telegraph Schools Chess Championship in 1996 as a six-year-old, thanked Suryas support at the nationals. 

Suryada egged me to go for the title and not think about the norm or qualification. His advice gave me lot of confidence and mental strength, said Mary Ann. 

Amongst female players, Mary Ann idolises Judith Polgar and Koneru Humpy. Humpy is a near-perfect player who gives little to her opponents, said Mary Ann. 

Humpy came to discuss strategy and openings which I would be employing in the Olympiad. As I am comparatively weak in the openings, Humpy assured me of all help in my preparation, disclosed Mary Ann. 

Mary Ann, who currently has a rating of 2239, will gain 43 points from the nationals. 

She will be attending a coaching camp in Goa with the other Indian players from April 28 to May 12.

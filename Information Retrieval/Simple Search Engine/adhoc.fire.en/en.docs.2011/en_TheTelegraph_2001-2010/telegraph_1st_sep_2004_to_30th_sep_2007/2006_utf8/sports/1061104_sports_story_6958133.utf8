 Australia, China make quarters 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: China and Australia have joined defending champions South Korea and Jordan to complete the quarter final line-up in the AFC Youth Championship from the city leg. 

David Williams scored both goals for the 10-man Australia against UAE as Nathan Burns received marching orders following double booking. China rode a late goal by Y.P. Wang to sail through Thailand. 

China topped Group B with an all-win record and face Group A runners-up Jordan while Australia finishing with six points take on South Korea in the quarter finals on Monday. 

Thailand clearly held the edge over China, who started cautiously considering the fact that only a draw would suffice their passage to the knockout stage. 

Thailand put the Chinese citadel under threat seconds before the break when Chainarong Tatong failed to snap up a rebound after Anawin Jujeens shot was saved by goalkeeper Wang Dalei. However, Wang dashed all their hopes in the 77th minute with a beautiful volley from distance. 

Meanwhile in Bangalore, Iraq and Saudi Arabia carved out convincing wins over Malaysia and Vietnam in their last league engagements, respectively, on Friday to enter the quarter finals.

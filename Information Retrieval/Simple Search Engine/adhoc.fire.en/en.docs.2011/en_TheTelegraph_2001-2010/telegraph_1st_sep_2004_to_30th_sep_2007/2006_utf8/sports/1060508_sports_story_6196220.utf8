 Dravid feted 

Bangalore: It was a way of paying tribute to some of Karnatakas finest cricketers, by guess who? Pushpa Dravid, mother of India captain, Rahul. 

A towering fibre glass mural with terracota images of Rahul, Anil Kumble, and former stars Jawagal Srinath, Gundappa Viswanth, Bhagwat Chandrashekar, Erapalli Prasanna, Syed Kirmani and Brijesh Patel was unveiled outside the Chinnaswamy. 

Rahul and Kumble were felicitated by the KSCA for playing 100 Tests on Sunday. (PTI)

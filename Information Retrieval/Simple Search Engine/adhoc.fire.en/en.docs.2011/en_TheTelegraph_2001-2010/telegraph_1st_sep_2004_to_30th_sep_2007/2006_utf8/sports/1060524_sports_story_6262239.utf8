Frankfurt: Lukas Podolski has already been tipped by Fifa as a likely challenger for the Best Young Player award for the World Cup. 

Podolski has had to deal with that sort of hype ever since he emerged as the best finisher in Germany since Juergen Klinsmann was delighting his fans and infuriating the opposition in the 1980s and 90s. 

Carrying the weight of expectation for German supporters is a lot to ask of a 20-year-old in his first World Cup. 

Podolskis performances in the Confederations Cup last year, when his three goals helped Germany reach the semi-finals, suggest he is unlikely to be overawed by the experience, however. 

Podolski, born in Gleiwitz in Poland, has played his entire professional career at Cologne. 

Quick, strong, skilful and with an uncomplicated attitude in front of the goal, Podolski has the priceless talent of making the players around him perform that little bit better. 

He scored 10 goals in 19 appearances as he broke into the first team in the 2003-04 season, and it was not long before he gained the nickname Prince Poldi. 

That was not enough to save Cologne from relegation, but it did win him a place in the German squad for Euro 2004, although he played just 45 minutes as Rudi Voellers side limped out after the first round. Klinsmann has shown no such reluctance since the former striker took over. 

Podolski has been first-choice striker ever since and has notched up a total of 10 goals in 22 appearances. A move to Bayern Munich or one of Germanys other big clubs looks on the cards but he will be playing for much more than just a lucrative transfer during the World Cup. 

Hes the greatest talent in the last 20 years, said Cologne president Wolfgang Overath, a World Cup winner with West Germany in 1974. Emulating Overath will be Podolskis main goal this summer.

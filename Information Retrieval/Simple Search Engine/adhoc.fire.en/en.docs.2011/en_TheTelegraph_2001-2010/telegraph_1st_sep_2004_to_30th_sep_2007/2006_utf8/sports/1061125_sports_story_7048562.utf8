 Sodhis wicket most satisfying: Ranadeb 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Ranadeb Bose hastened Punjabs first-innings collapse with a four-wicket haul on Friday in Mohali. The hosts managed just a one-run lead in reply to Bengals 156. 

The mediumpacer, however, doesnt want to read much into it. I havent done anything of note Just performed my duties. I have been picked in the side to get wickets. Nothing special about it, he said. 

With Shib Shankar Paul not available, Im the senior-most pacer and have to take responsibilities. The wicket is helping the pacers, though I would say it has eased out a bit in the sense that the moisture is no more there There is a decent bounce and there is an opportunity for everyone now. Its hard luck that we lost the toss, Ranadeb added. 

He said the wicket of Reetinder Singh Sodhi (his first) gave him the most satisfaction. He was forced to snick His wicket was vital since we didnt want him to stay long. In the absence of their seniors, he is their main batsman, Ranadeb explained.

 Call from Musharraf 

Karachi: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf had called up the team management at The Oval in London and inquired about the ball tampering accusation levelled by Australian umpire Darrell Hair which led to crickets biggest controversy and undoubtedly worst incident in modern times. 

President Musharraf discussed the situation with PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and captain Inzamam-ul Haq, who aspired him on the crisis. He was very sympathetic with the team over the sad affair, a Pakistan team source said. 

Musharraf is also the patron of the PCB. He had followed Pakistan squad to India and Sharjah, earlier this year. 

Musharraf normally does not involve himself in cricket affairs and has delegated all administrative powers to Shaharyar Khan and team affairs to Inzamam.

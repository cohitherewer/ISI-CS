 Atwal looking to improve form

 - Bay Hill invitational

 Atwal 

Miami: Arjun Atwal, who has struggled in the last few tournaments missing three cuts in four starts, will hope to improve his form as he tees up at the Bay Hill Invitational in Orlando starting on Thursday. 

Atwal, teamed with Bob May and Paul Lawrie for the opening round, tied fourth at the Buick Invitational in January, but since then it has been downhill. His next best result came before that in tied 24th at the Bob Hope Classic, while he finished 35th at the Ford Championships. 

Swede Daniel Chopra will have his own problems to sort out. In the last two weeks, he has been in contention after three rounds, only to fade away in the last. 

At the Ford Championship, he went into the final just off leader Tiger Woods and played the final round with the world No. 1. But he shot a 77 and dropped to tied 20th. At the Honda Classic last week, he was fourth and two off the leader, but a final round 76 saw him slide to tied 13th. 

Meanwhile, Woods, a four-time winner at the Bay Hill Invitational, will start favourite after three titles world-wide already under his belt even before the years first major. 

He has been in terrific form even though he won a couple of times in a play-off. Woods has won three of his first five tournaments of 2006.

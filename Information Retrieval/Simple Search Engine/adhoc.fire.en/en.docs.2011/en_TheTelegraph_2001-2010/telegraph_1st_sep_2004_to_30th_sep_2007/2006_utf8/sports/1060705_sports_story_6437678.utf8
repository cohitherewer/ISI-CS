 Cup is a special test: 

Ricardo 

 - Injuries, exhaustion part of month-long spectacle 

Berlin: The World Cup is soccers greatest spectacle. Its also a month-long grind, and the fatigue is starting to show. 

 Games every few days, many played under a summer sun. Travel back and forth across Germany. Pressure that grows with every game. And thats on top of the nine months ? or more ? that many players just spent with soccers best clubs. 

The World Cup is a special test, said Portugal goalkeeper Ricardo Pereira, whose team plays France on Wednesday in the semi-finals. No matter how hard you try, you cant completely overcome that tiredness. 

Or the injuries. Or the mental exhaustion. 

Some teams manage better than others. Semi-finalists Germany, Italy, France and Portugal have outlasted the other 28 teams, and its not only because of skill, timing and luck. 

 Italy might be the strongest team mentally, able to ignore distractions from a corruption scandal that is rocking the domestic league. 

Despite several gruelling games, Portugal have managed to remain healthy. France look fresher now than a month ago. And Germany are among the fittest teams after coach Juergen Klinsmann overhauled their training program. 

Physical condition is very important, because in soccer these days, 95 per cent of the time the team that runs more wins, Italy defender Gianluca Zambrotta said. Compared to the past, soccer is much more athletic and the pace is much faster. 

When the tournament began in 1930, there were only 13 teams and it lasted two weeks. Now 32 teams play 64 games over four weeks, and qualifying begins two years out. 

But thats not all. Many national team players spend most of their time competing in Europes gruelling leagues and cup competitions. 

Training starts as early as August and the season runs through May. Portugal playmaker Deco helped Barcelona win the Champions League title on May 17 ? one day before training camp for his national team opened. 

And forget about getting a break afterward. The French league opens July 31, and Lyon held their first practice on Monday. 

Other big European leagues start play within six weeks of the World Cup final, and qualifying for the 2008 European Championship starts in August. 

So dont blame the players for trying to pace themselves, knowing they could be on the field for two hours, as was the case when Germany and Portugal won quarter final games on penalty-kick shootouts. 

All the exertion takes a toll ? on both body and spirit.

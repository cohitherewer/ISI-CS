 Neelam guilty, says AFI 

New Delhi: The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) has done a volte face on the Neelam Jaswant Singh doping case, finding the discus thrower guilty after initially letting her off the hook. 

The startling decision of the AFI is believed to have been taken under pressure from the sports world governing body, the IAAF which had communicated its dissatisfaction over the earlier verdict recently. 

A four-member AFI panel had previously given the benefit of doubt to the athlete who had tested positive for banned substance pemoline during the World Athletics Championships in Helsinki last August. 

She has already served seven months out of the two-year provisional ban imposed on her by IAAF. 

However, AFI denied that pressure from IAAF led to the reversal of the decision. 

The panel had written to the IAAF asking for certain technical clarifications and once it received them, there was no doubt about the positive dope tests. There is no question of any pressure from the IAAF to reverse the decision, AFI secretary general Lalit Bhanot said. 

The panel did not quite understand the laboratory reports provided to them. There were different signatures on different documents and varying times recorded on them. 

The panel was not sure who had the authority to sign the lab documents and pending clarifications, they cleared Neelam, Bhanot said.

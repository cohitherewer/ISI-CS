 BCCI report full of mistakes: Choudhary

Jamshedpur: The president of the Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA), Amitabh Choudhary, on Monday criticised the report filed by a BCCI three-member committee to look into the membership claims of Jharkhand and Bihar, saying it was full of mistakes. 

Addressing the JSCA members during the annual prize distribution ceremony, Choudhary said the committees report had stated the JSCA was formed in 2001, while the correct date was August 15, 2004. 

The report stated that the JSCA election was held on May 13, 2001 when Choudhary was elected as the president. But the fact is that the JSCAs maiden office-bearer election was held on May 14, 2006 at Bokaro, he pointed out. 

The JSCA has filed a writ petition in Jharkhand high court, challenging the BCCI decision of forming a three-member committee. (PTI)

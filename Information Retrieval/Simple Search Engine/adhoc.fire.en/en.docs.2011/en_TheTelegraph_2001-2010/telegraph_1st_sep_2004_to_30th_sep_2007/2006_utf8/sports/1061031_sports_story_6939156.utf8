 Kumble, Zaheer stage ODI comeback 

 - Ramesh Powar, RP SIngh dropped 

Mohali: Reeling under Indias poor showing in recent months, national selectors on Monday recalled seasoned campaigners Anil Kumble and Zaheer Khan but ignored V.V.S. Laxman in a 16-member one-day squad that will tour South Africa. 

Indias highest wicket-taker in Tests and one-dayers, leg-spinner Kumble long ignored for ODIs was brought back into the squad that will play five one-dayers and one Twenty20 tie. 

A three-match Test series will follow the ODIs but the squad for that will be picked later. 

The five-match ODI series will be played in Johannesburg (November 19), Durban (November 22), Cape Town (November 26), November 29 (Port Elizabeth) and in Centurion (Dec. 3). 

Johannesburg will also stage a Twenty20 tie on December 1. 

The 36-year-old Kumbles last one-day appearance was in Sri Lanka in August last year. 

Zaheer, who last played one-day cricket in February this year, was rewarded for his consistent performance in the County championship and in domestic matches. 

A surprise inclusion in the squad is Test opener Wasim Jaffer, who is yet to play in the shorter version of the game. The Mumbai batsman was preferred over the in-form Gautam Gambhir and Robin Uthappa. 

Suresh Raina, who was off-colour in the Champions Trophy from which India bowed out on Sunday after a six-wicket defeat to Australia, was retained in the squad, announced by BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah here. 

Injured pacer Ajit Agarkar was provisionally named in the squad, subject to a fitness test on November 10 while Yuvraj Singh was ruled out after a medical test revealed a tear in his left knee. He will be replaced by Dinesh Karthik. 

Karthik will be the second wicketkeeper after first-choice Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Off-spinner Ramesh Powar and paceman Rudra Pratap Singh, who were in the Champions Trophy squad, were dropped. 

Later, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar said wholesale changes were not required in the squad, though the selectors were concerned by the sliding fortunes of the side. 

I dont think we need to make wholesale changes in the squad. Some players have been performing while there are others who have not done too well. We think this is a balanced side and should be able to do well in South Africa, he said. 

However, the team needs to improve in many areas. The batsmen have to play till the end in one-dayers, then only we can win. The bowlers have to improve also, he added.

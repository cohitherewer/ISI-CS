 Coach struggles to find right combination 

 - India begin hockey campaign against Bangladesh today 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: If there is any medal for the most transformed person in the 15th Asian Games here, it would certainly go to Vasudevan Baskaran. 

Sitting on a chair on the sidelines of the Al Rayyan Sports Complex during the team practice, the Indian hockey coach was at his charming best. Generally known for his not too polite treatment of the mediapersons, Baskaran, to everyones surprise, was seen spending more time with the people from the fourth estate than his own wards on the pitch. 

Perhaps, he had nothing better to do. Widely believed to be on his last assignment with the national team, Baskaran, it seems, has already handed over the reins to his deputy Harender Singh. While Harender, tipped to take over after the Asian Games, remained busy with the boys in the middle, Baskaran sat outside to do all the talking. 

So much so that Baskaran even gathered enough courage to criticise the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) decision to drop Viren Rasquinha from the squad. It was an unfortunate decision no doubt, he said. But then, the selectors can pick only 16 players. May be they felt Viren was not fit enough to make the squad. 

But on Monday, when India begin their campaign in the Asian Games hockey with the match against Bangladesh in the group league, their biggest problem could be finding Virens replacement in the centre-half position. So acute is the problem that in the friendly against Japan here two days ago, Baskaran had to shift striker Tushar Khandekar as the centre-half. 

Beating lowly Bangladesh should not be any problem for India, but against China and South Korea, the national coach might find it difficult to set the right combination. With a relatively new team and a coach whose days are numbered after a disastrous World Cup, things are definitely not going to be easy for India in the later stages. 

In Asian Games, India have won gold only twice in 1966 and 1998. Regaining the top medal here would be a tough task as the IHF has packed the side with a whole bunch of youngsters like Harpal Singh, Gurbaj Singh and Ajmer Singh. Even the ability of drag-flicker Raghunath in international matches is yet to be tested though he struck a hattrick in the friendly match only a couple of days ago. 

Baskaran promised that his team would fight it out. But the big question is, will the boys really do it under a general, who has already been handed over his pension papers?

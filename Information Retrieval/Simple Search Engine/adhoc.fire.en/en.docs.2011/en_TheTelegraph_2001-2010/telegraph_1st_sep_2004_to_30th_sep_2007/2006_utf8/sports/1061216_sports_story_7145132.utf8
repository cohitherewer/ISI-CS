The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 A sad tale of a few free passengers

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: Ever heard of Nasser Hussain, Premananda Singh or Girish Ashok? 

In case you havent, they are some of the star Indian sportspersons, who earned the distinction of donning the national colours in the just concluded Asian Games here. Hussain led the Indian rugby team, Premananda is a sepak takraw player and Girish Ashok is a member of the bowling squad. 

They donned the Indian jersey, but didnt exactly take their teams to great heights. While the Union ministry of sports didnt clear the visits of these squads to Doha, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) made it a point to take them along on a no cost to government basis. It met with disastrous results. 

On Thursday, the IOA president, Suresh Kalmadi, hailed Indias performance in the Games. In Busan, he pointed out, India won 35 medals. They have got 19 more in Doha. Its a great improvement, he claimed. 

Lets have a look at how Indian squads in some of the events fared and how, through their pathetic performance, ended up lowering the national prestige on the international arena. 

The sepak takraw teams (both men and women), altogether played 14 matches and lost all. There were several sections team, regu, single and double events. The Indian mens and womens team came a cropper in all. 

The performance of the Indian rugby squad was no better. This team, comprising players from Mumbai and Pune, suffered crushing defeats in all the matches, except the one against hosts Qatar. 

Indias rugby campaign in Doha began with a bang, losing to China 0-41. It was followed by another defeat against Sri Lanka, the margin this time being 0-48. For the seventh and eighth place match, Thailand handed out a 29-0 thrashing. India, however, beat Qatar, who only the previous day, lost to China by an Asian Games record of 0-82 scoreline. 

The Indian captain, Nasser Hussain, however, remained unperturbed by the defeats. We improved a lot by reviewing our performance in the previous matches. 

The story of the bowling squad is equally interesting. 

In the womens singles event, Indian entry N. Sumanthi finished 67th among 77 participants. Sana Saipillai managed 74th place. The mens squad didnt lag behind. Girish Ashok was placed 82nd in mens singles, with his compatriot Vijay Punjabi 106. In all other bowling events, be it doubles or trios, India ended up below the 20th position. In the five-player team event, India came 17th since there were only 19 teams in the fray. 

Kalmadi said all the teams were cleared because the Doha organisers kept 684 beds for Indian athletes in the athletes village. The air fare was also nominal, only Rs. 12,000. 

All the humiliation for a free bed and breakfast!

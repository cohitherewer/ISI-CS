 India begin chase on positive note

 - West Indies set 392-run target 

 Virender Sehwag in Basseterre on Monday 

Basseterre: Virender Sehwag eased Indias anxiety with an innings of quality and luck after the West Indies set the visitors a monumental target of 392 on the fifth and final day of the third Test here on Monday. 

 India reached 200 for two at tea 

 on Day V. Rahul Dravid and V.V.S. Laxman were at the crease. 

 Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer were the batsmen out.

 The dashing opener was unbeaten on 65 in his teams 109 for no loss by lunch to make the improbable task look possible at the Warner Park Stadium. 

India still require 283 runs from 62 overs which doesnt seem far-fetched given Indias position and Sehwags belligerence. Wasim Jaffer was unbeaten on 35 at the other end. 

The West Indies, who resumed at 113 for 4, declared after 40 minutes of batting at the 172 for 6. 

Sehwag made the most of a lucky reprieve Chris Gayle dropped him on five at first slip off the bowling of Jerome Taylor. There was another let-off for him when Ramnaresh Sarwan, one of the two short extra covers posted for him, dropped a catch off Dwayne Bravo. Sehwag was then on 56 and the team total was 94 for no loss. 

Earlier on Sunday, in combination with fellow paceman Corey Collymore, Taylor helpd dismiss the visitors for 362 in their first innings in reply to the West Indies 581. With the exception of V.V.S. Laxman, who scored his 10th Test century, India experienced a middle-order collapse, allowing the hosts to take command in the match. 

Brian Lara, however, declined to enforce the follow-on and at Day IV stumps, his side were 113 for four in their second innings. 

 Later speaking to the reporters, Laxman said he could 

 still not take anything for granted, especially when the 

 middle order slot was crowded in the team. I can only 

 do things which are in my control and the rest you leave 

 to the selectors and team management, he said. (Agencies)

 DAY IV HIGHLIGHTS

 Brain Lara became the 

 first West Indian captain in 30 years not to enforce the 

 follow-on on the opponent since Clive Lloyd did so against 

 England at The Oval on August 1976. However, Lloyd with 

 a lead of 252, managed to win the match by 231 runs.

 For the record, the last captain, before Lara, not 

 to enforce a follow-on against India was Australian Adam 

 Gilchrist in Bangalore in October 2004. Australia then had 

 a lead of 228 runs and went on to win the match by 217 runs.

 VVS Laxman (100) became the 12th Indian and the 

 96th batsman in Tests to register 10 or more hundreds.

 On the third day, Laxman when on 23, became the 

 tenth Indian and the 41st batsman to aggregate 1000 runs 

 against the Windies. He now has 1077 runs in 15 matches.

 Anil Kumble became the 11th Indian and the 89th 

 fielder to take 50 catches in Tests, when he held Chanderpaul 

 of his own bowling. 

 Earlier, Kumble claimed his 19th stumped (Lara) 

 victim. Now, among Indians, only Subash Gupte has more such 

 dismissals (20).

 Meanwhile, Lara has now been stumped only for the 

 fourth time in his Test career

 The caught and bowled dismissal of Shivnarine Chanderpaul 

 was the seventh such dismissal of his career, the most by 

 any West Indian. Chanderpaul went past the tally of six 

 by Rohan Kanhai and Jeff Dujon.

 The West Indian batsman have in all hit 14 sixes 

 (11+3) in this Test match. Only once before the team from 

 the Caribbean has hit more sixes 18 against England 

 in St Johns, 1985-86. Only one other team has hit 

 so many sixes against India Pakistan (18) in Faisalabad 

 earlier this year.

 Dont interfere with my work, Parreira tells SA

Johannesburg: Former Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira warned that he will not tolerate any interference from South Africas soccer federation when he takes over the countrys national squad. 

The South African Football Association has often been blamed for forcing a rapid succession of trainers to quit through its interference. Parreira said Tuesday the body would need to back off if he was to polish soccer diamonds ahead of South Africas hosting of the 2010 World Cup. 

Thirteen coaches in 13 years is not a good record, Parreira said at his first press conference in South Africa. The moment I am not happy or not feeling comfortable, then it is bye bye. The security of the coach is results, a coach relies on results. The results of this team will be in 2010. 

Parreira arrived in South Africa at the weekend to watch the team get held to a dismal 0-0 draw by the Republic of Congo. South Africa failed to qualify for this years World Cup and crashed out of the African Cup of Nations in the first round without scoring a goal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jamaica ties in jeopardy

 India's tour of WI

 Port-of-Spain: The Jamaican 

 leg of Indias upcoming cricket tour of the West Indies 

 may be scrapped or shifted to another venue as the Sabina 

 Park, being renovated for the World Cup 2007, may not be 

 ready before the series.

 According to the West Indies media 

 reports, recent cement shortage led to an alarming slow-down 

 in construction work at the venue, undergoing a $29 million 

 renovation in preparation for the World Cup next March.

 As we speak there is no 

 final decision, Jamaica Cricket Association vice-president 

 Paul Campbell was quoted as saying by a Jamaican daily on 

 Sunday.

 It was brought to our attention 

 last week (by the Sabina Venue Development Team) that under 

 the current circumstances meeting the deadlines will be 

 really tight, he said.

 Jamaica is committed to completing 

 the Sabina project by October 30. (PTI)

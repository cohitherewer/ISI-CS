The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cloud over final venue

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: There are clouds of uncertainty over the Champions Trophy final at the Brabourne Stadium, following back-to-back low-scoring matches here. 

Graeme Smith criticised the wicket, describing it as not being up to international standard. It has been learnt that the skippers criticism of the wicket has left the CCI president Raj Singh Dungarpur disappointed. He is also learnt to have said that the CCI wont object if the ICC wants to shift the final. 

Dungarpur couldnt be contacted despite several attempts, but ICC spokesman Brian Murgatroyd termed the news as premature. Right at the moment, I can neither deny nor confirm if the final is being shifted, Murgatroyd told The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nadal may be the greatest claycourter

 This years French Open was 

 a very special event. At stake was not merely the title 

 but much more. For Roger Federer, victory on the slow red 

 clay would have meant a leap into tennis immortality; for 

 Rafael Nadal, sovereign of clay, the loss of his kingdom. 

 For tennis enthusiasts worldwide, it was a defining moment 

 in the history of the game and a measure of Federers 

 genius.

 Sadly, Federers sublime 

 talent just failed to bridge the gap between the slow clay 

 and the faster surfaces ? but only at the very highest level. 

 Federer annihilated the field on way to the final, but faltered 

 at the final step against the rare genius of the 20-year-old 

 Nadal, who after 60 consecutive wins, can stake his claim 

 to be the greatest clay court player of all time.

 Had Federer heeded Rod Lavers 

 advice of mixing-it-up, in other words varying 

 his game, the match may have been much closer and Federer 

 may possibly have pulled it off. When Federer started to 

 trade ground shots with Nadal in the second set it was fatal 

 blunder. Nadals ground shots which have the lowest 

 unforced error percentages are like merciless grinding stones 

 powered by boundless energy and passion.

 They grind you into the dust. 

 The excessive spin that Nadal imparts brings about a gyroscopic 

 stability to his game. So overwhelming is his presence on 

 court that one of his earlier victims Kini of the US equated 

 him to the endless Sahara! Nadal is still improving and 

 one learns that he is working on developing a flat forehand 

 and a better second serve.

 One of the significant features 

 of Nadals matches was his ability to produce his best 

 under pressure. Most of his aces came when he was down break 

 points and in the tie-breakers.. 

 Nadals clash against the 

 strapping French teenage Mathieu was the best match of the 

 fortnight. The bitterly contested baseline encounter lasted 

 for five hours and clocked an amazing average of close to 

 seven shots per rally. 

 Over the fortnight one was astounded 

 at the very high standard of play. Nadal and Federer are 

 a class apart but there are a group of youngsters hot on 

 their heels. Gasquet, Moufils, Mathieu, Murray, Djokovic, 

 Berdych are being pushed to their limits and are maturing 

 very fast. They are all potential top ten contenders.

 The mens game is in good 

 health and the Nadal/Federer rivalry will enrich the game 

 and push standards to even higher peaks. The decline in 

 standards of the US, Australia and Great Britain are difficult 

 to fathom. 

 Leave alone impact at the higher 

 levels, their presence at the lower echelons have dwindled 

 to an all time low. This highlights the fact that even the 

 best facilities and money are not enough to produce champions. 

 Hunger and national character play a major role on the road 

 to tennis glory. 

 Sharapova and now Vaidisova took 

 full advantage and are products of the US system. Seventeen-year-old 

 Czech Vaidisova a pretty, sleek, six-footer, very strong 

 and athletic was the exciting new star in the womens 

 world. A Sharapova look-alike, Vaidisova seems to have a 

 much more complete and flexible game.

 She brought down the top seed 

 and World No.1 Amelie Mauresmo and Venus Williams both Grand 

 Slam title holders. With a bit of luck she could have beaten 

 Kuznetsova in the semi-finals. The womens singles 

 was won convincingly by Hennin Hardenne for a third time. 

 She did not drop a set during the Championships. Her small 

 wiry frame is carried by rock solid legs and she hits a 

 clean aggressive early ball.

 Henin-Hardennes single handed 

 backhand specially the down-the-line shot is the best in 

 the womens game today. But womens tennis is 

 at a low ebb. Most of the greats like Serena Williams and 

 Lindsay Davenport are side-lined by injuries. The ones playing 

 have been patched up after injury and have jumped back into 

 the fray. In womens tennis results are reflective 

 more of their physical condition than their real standard 

 of play. 

 Remember the time the Russian 

 girls were storming the ramparts of the top echelons of 

 the game. Myskina, Dementieva, Petrova, Kuznetsova and lately 

 Sharapova came down with injuries and could not sustain 

 the exacting schedules of training and continuing tournament 

 play to become and sustain the No.1 position.

 The Williams sisters also succumbed 

 to the same syndrome. How else can one explain the Hingis 

 comeback after four years in the wilderness, except that 

 standards in womens tennis could not be sustained. 

 When Hingis gave up in 2001, she was injured, but her guile 

 and consistency were being overcome by the power of the 

 Williams sisters. Now after five years, Hingis could well 

 break through an injured and patched up womens field.

 In fact, injury in both the mens 

 and womens game has become a destructive factor in 

 the world of tennis. There was a record nine matches in 

 the mens singles where competitors withdrew during 

 the match. It was really sad to see Nalbandian withdraw 

 against Federer in the semis after winning a fantastic first 

 set. 

 So many of the matches were riddled 

 with strategic calls for the trainer and toilet breaks, 

 holding up play. Can we not do something to bring some sense 

 into this headlong lemming-like plunge for money in the 

 tennis world?

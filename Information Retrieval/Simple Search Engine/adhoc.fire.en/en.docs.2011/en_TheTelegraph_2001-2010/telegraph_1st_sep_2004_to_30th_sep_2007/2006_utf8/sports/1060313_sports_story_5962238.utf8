 Chandigarh: Irfan Pathan feels India have a pretty good chance of winning this second Test. England are struggling with 74 runs ahead with five wickets remaining. 

Ian Bell, who top scored with 57, was keeping his fingers crossed. Well take time to think about tomorrow (Sunday). The fact that we lost five wickets in the last session was disappointing. 

I hope the guys will come up with some fresh ideas and will be ready for the fight tomorrow, he said about the mood in the England camp. 

Bell, however, admitted that England have a challenge up their sleeves as both Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh will be testing us to the hilt tomorrow. 

Harbhajan was getting some purchase as he came round the wicket. Anil got some turn bowling from the pavilion end, Bell said while ruing that they failed to get the partnerships going. 

Pathan hopes stemmed from the fact that the wicket was affording turn with some bit of bounce and the spinners were bowling well. 

He didnt agree that the fielding was sloppy. I dont think we lacked in intensity. There may have been a few dropped catches, but the ground fielding was top class, Pathan remarked. 

Pathan, who scored a superb 52 off 58 balls on Sunday, still didnt wish to be branded an allrounder. 

I need to score at least a couple of hundreds before being labelled so. Theres still a long way to go. You can assume whatever you want. I know my limitations and I should go by them, he said.

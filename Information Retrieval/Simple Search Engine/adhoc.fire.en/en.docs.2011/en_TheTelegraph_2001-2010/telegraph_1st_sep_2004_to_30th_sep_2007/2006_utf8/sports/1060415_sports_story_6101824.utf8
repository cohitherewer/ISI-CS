 Sankars World Cup dream in tatters

 - AFC deletes Indian referees name from panel at the last moment 

JAYDEEP BASU

New Delhi: Komleswaran Sankars dream of supervising in back-to-back World Cup finals has been shattered. 

The assistant referee from Tamil Nadu, who was supposed to leave for Frankfurt on Sunday to appear in the final fitness test (April 18 to 21) for the World Cup, has been advised by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) not to proceed to Germany. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Ludhiana, where he would be officiating in the National Football League (NFL) match between JCT and Mahindra United on Saturday, Sankar said his name has been removed from the AFC panel of assistant referees scheduled to go to Frankfurt for the test. 

Nothing has been informed to me officially so far, said a crestfallen Sankar, who became the first Indian referee to officiate in World Cup finals in 2002. 

I only got to know about it when I applied for a visa at the German embassy. I contacted the AFC officials, and they asked me to cancel my Frankfurt visit. I believe a Korean assistant referee has replaced me in the panel. 

While Sankar said he was heart-broken as four years of hard work has been wasted, no one in the All India Football Federation (AIFF) was able to explain why the Indian referees name has been deleted at the last moment. 

The deputy chairman of the AIFF referees committee, Milan Dutta, said he has no clue about the reason behind Sankars omission. 

I did contact Mohammed Naziri Abdullah of AFC and was told that very few Asian referees are getting a chance this time, said Dutta, who is also a member of the AFC referees committee. 

Seven referees were sent for fitness test and only two got in, Dutta said. I am not sure how many assistant referees from Asia will finally stand the test at Frankfurt. 

While Dutta said he was unaware whether the 41-year-old top Indian referee was a victim of AFC internal politics, AIFF insiders feel that it could be a reason behind Sankars unceremonious ouster at the last moment. 

One must lobby a lot to get things done in the AFC, said a senior AIFF official. All three members of the AFC appointment committee come from a particular region. 

For the past seven/eight years, Sankar has been doing a tremendous job at the international level. If performance was any criteria, then he should have been there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its a tragedy mistakes alone get noticed, says Kamran Akmal

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

- The wicketkeeper with the fastest Test hundred unwinds 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kamran Akmal

Faisalabad: After a scintillating record-erasing 

unbeaten 102 at the Gaddafi, in the first Test, young Kamran Akmal fell for a 

duck on Sunday. But, as he himself accepted in a one-on-one with The Telegraph 

the other day, nothing is guaranteed.

The following are excerpts:

 Q On 2005 having been an excellent year

A It was because of Allahs meherbani 

... Im grateful to him for helping me score five international hundreds 

... Im also thankful to my captain (Inzamam-ul Haq) and coach (Bob Woolmer) 

... Cricket is a team sport and no individual achieves anything without the support 

of teammates.

On the top lesson learnt in the past 12 months

That Ive got to work harder ... Ive learnt 

that from seniors.

On whether the tour of India was the defining 

moment in his career 

There was so much pressure ... It was followed by 

every Pakistani ... Thankfully, I played an important hand when we saved the first 

Test (Mohali) and that took some of the pressure off me ... I was determined to 

repeat that performance, but couldnt as Allah didnt want it ... Still, 

that was a landmark tour for me ? and the rest of the team, too.

On having done well on the next tour, to the 

West Indies, as well 

I didnt make much of an impression with the 

bat, but really enjoyed keeping ... Inzybhai continued to give me 

confidence and, when the captain has so much faith, any players performance 

is bound to get better. 

On the interaction between Inzamam and him

Much of it is about handling pressure. Having been 

so successful across the world, Inzybhai talks with the weight of experience 

behind him ... 

On the effort he has himself been putting in

After the West Indies, we were advised a complete 

break for at least three weeks. However, I couldnt stay at home for more 

than three days ... I probably began training from the fourth day ... That effort 

paid off when England came ... Agar main off season mein train nahi 

karta, its possible I would have been found wanting at the start of 

this season ... As is known, I got a Test hundred and two in ODIs.

On whether hed expected Pakistan to beat 

the Ashes winners

 Ummid definitely thi ... We took to 

the Test series and the ODIs with faith in Allah and faith in our abilities ... 

We won because everybody worked very hard ... Then, we were disciplined ?

On whether he began this series with the pressure 

of having to deliver once again

Pressure is going to remain, but Ive learnt 

to handle it better ... Ive begun with just one goal: That I dont 

let the team down ... That I can stand up and be counted when Im needed 

the most.

On keeping to Shoaib Akhtar

Its a pleasure.

On whether Danish Kaneria has a signal 

for him

 (Laughs) I read the deliveries off his hand 

... Thats the safest way... (After a pause) Usually, at the end of 

the day, Danish and I speak about the way he bowled and the way I kept to him 

... That exercise helps both of us. 

On whether he followed Mahendra Singh Dhonis 

exploits in the lead-up to this series

Absolutely ... Though he played against us last year, 

Id first seen him in an A tournament in Kenya two years ago ... While the 

rest struggled, he got runs at will ... I knew he would soon make it big and his 

India debut came only a few months after that. Dhoni is a fine keeper, too. 

On whether wicketkeepers should also be classified 

as allrounders

For me, thats not an issue. However, I do feel 

strongly about keepers not getting the recognition they deserve. Its 

a tragedy that mistakes alone get noticed ... A dropped catch or a missed stumping 

... Surely, good catches and smart stumpings need to be highlighted ... Hardly 

anybody appreciates that keepers have a difficult job.

On handling success

Allah is guiding me ... He has ensured that I do the 

correct things ... Success lekin guaranteed nahin hai ... Its 

because of the guidance that Ive been able to realise my dream of playing 

for Pakistan ... Every child has some ambition or the other, but not everybody 

gets whats desired ... Ive been fortunate ... Ive been lucky 

as well ... 

On whether younger brother Adnan remains the 

biggest threat

 (Laughs again) He is ... The good thing is 

that even if he replaces me, an Akmal is still going to be doing the job! Adnans 

my biggest critic, but I know his criticism is constructive ... I respect what 

he says. 

On whether he continues to be a loyal A. R. 

Rahman and Sonu Nigam fan

Of course ... Its not that I dont listen 

to other Indian singers, but they are special.

Finally, on having done better than Adam Gilchrist 

? somebody he admires ? during his blazing knock at the Gaddafi

At times, I still cant believe what Ive 

achieved ... Wicket flat tha aur hamara din bhi tha ... Everything clicked 

... Again, though, Ill thank Allah.

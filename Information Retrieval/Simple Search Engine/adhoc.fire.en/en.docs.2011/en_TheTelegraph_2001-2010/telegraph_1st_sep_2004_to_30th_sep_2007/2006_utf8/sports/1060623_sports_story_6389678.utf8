 Ghana beat US, in Round II

Nuremberg: Ghana reached the second round at the World Cup in their first appearance, beating the United States 2-1 on Thursday in Group E. 

 Captain Stephen Appiah scored the winning goal, converting a penalty kick in the second minute of first-half injury time after United States defender Oguchi Onyewu was called for a foul in the penalty area. 

Haminu Draman put the African team ahead in the 22nd minute, breaking in alone on goalkeeper Kasey Keller after colliding with Claudio Reyna, who crumpled to the field in pain. 

The United States, who have never won a World Cup game in which they trailed, equalised when Clint Dempsey scored in the 43rd minute. 

Brian McBride nearly levelled again in the 66th, but his diving header inside the box hit the near post. A minute later, Onyewu sent a header off Landon Donovans corner kick over the crossbar. 

In order to advance, the Americans needed a victory and some help. They got the needed assistance when Italy defeated the Czech Republic 2-0 in Hamburg. But the United States didnt come through and finished the tournament with one point ? their first ever in a World Cup played in Europe. 

 Italy won Group E with seven points and Ghana advanced with six points. The Black Stars received a pre-game visit from Cameroons Samuel Eto, Africas Player of the Year. 

Ghana is the first African team to advance past the first round in this years tournament. Tunisia, who plays Ukraine on Friday, also have a chance. Angola, Ivory Coast and Togo have been eliminated. 

Draman scored after Dempsey played a backpass to Reyna, and the US captain collided with the Ghanaian, left knee to left knee. 

As Reyna fell, Draman picked up the ball and came in one on one against Keller, putting the ball onto his right foot and sending it into the corner of the net from about 12 meters, over the diving goalkeeper. 

Reyna was taken off the field on a stretcher, grimacing, but returned in the 26th minute, just about the time Italy went ahead of the Czechs. Still looking pained, he was replaced by Ben Olsen in the 40th minute and went to the bench where the knee was wrapped. 

 Donovan had a great chance to equalise in the 35th, when he had an open shot, but he got under the ball and his volley attempt went way high. 

Dempsey then levelled after DaMarcus Beasley, along the left flank just past midfield, battled Derek Boateng and John Pantsil. Beasley stole the ball from Pantsil and made a left-footed cross in front of the goal. 

Racing ahead of Habib Mohamed, Dempsey one-timed the ball with his right foot from about 12 meters. Dempsey did his rap dance as Americans celebrated ? it was just their third shot at the goal in the tournament. 

One minute into injury time, Onyewu pushed down Razak Pimpong in the penalty area battling for a header, and German referee Markus Merk pointed to the spot. Keller dived left, but Appiah put the ball high to the goalkeepers right to put Ghana in the lead.

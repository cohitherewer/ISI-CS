The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Furyk moves one shot clear

 Players Championship

 Ponte Vedra Beach: American 

 Jim Furyk moved one shot clear with a one-under-par 71 in 

 the Players Championship second round on Friday while Tiger 

 Woods rallied with a 69.

 Co-leader overnight with compatriot 

 Davis Love III, Furyk collected three birdies and two bogeys 

 in blustery conditions at the TPC at Sawgrass to finish 

 on eight-under 136.

 Twice former winner Love, who 

 matched Furyk with an opening 65, experienced a nightmare 

 round.

 Champion on the Stadium Course 

 in 1992 and 2003, he collapsed to an ugly 83, which included 

 a quadruple-bogey nine at the last, to miss the cut by four 

 strokes. Canadas Stephen Ames fired a best-of-the-day 

 66 to share second place at seven under with 2004 champion 

 Adam Scott of Australia (67).

 World No.2 Vijai Singh returned 

 a 70 to lie a further stroke back in a tie for fourth with 

 Spaniard Sergio Garcia (68) and South Koreas K.J. 

 Choi (69).

 Former winner Woods improved on 

 an opening 72 to finish at three under, despite growing 

 concern over his fathers failing health.

 The world number one, who had 

 considered pulling out of the tournament earlier in the 

 week, birdied four of his first seven holes to climb into 

 contention.Woods was in danger of bogeying his final hole, 

 the ninth, after finding water off the tee but chipped in 

 from 30 feet from off the back of the green for a par five.

 It should have been a seven 

 but I ended up with a five, the 30-year-old American 

 told reporters.

 But today I got back into 

 the flow of the rhythm of the round, added Woods.

 The halfway cut fell at level-par 

 144, with Love, US Open champion Michael Campbell, Irelands 

 Padraig Harrington, Sony Open winner David Toms and Britains 

 Luke Donald among the surprise casualties.

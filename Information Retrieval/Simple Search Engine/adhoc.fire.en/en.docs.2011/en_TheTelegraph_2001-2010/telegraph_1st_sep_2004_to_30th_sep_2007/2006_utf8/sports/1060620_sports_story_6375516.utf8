 We wont miss Zidane, says Barthez

Hamelin: France goalkeeper Fabien Barthez urged his teammates not to let their heads drop after two draws left the 1998 champions in danger of another early World Cup exit. 

We were very disappointed after the match but were still here and were still among the teams who can win the World Cup, Barthez said. Our fate remains in our own hands. Its not over yet. 

France should also accept the fact that Zinedine Zidane will miss the Togo match through suspension. He wont be there, full stop, said Barthez, a close friend of Zidane. 

Theres no room for feelings in this type of competition. We must concentrate on playing our game and winning the match. Zizous absence wont be a factor.

 Raina: Key was to stay positive

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Multan: Rudra Pratap Singh may have won the Man of the Match award on Thursday for triggering the Pakistan collapse, but Suresh Rainas innings can in no way be undermined. The youngster scored a vital 35 off 34 balls at a critical stage to steer India to the series victory. 

Even Sachin Tendulkar has praised Rainas temperament. The youngster, however, was his usual cool self. For him the journey has just begun. 

I played my natural game. The key was to stay positive and I batted keeping that in mind. There was no extra pressure as the target was just 162, Raina told The Telegraph before leaving for Karachi Friday afternoon. 

The Uttar Pradesh lefthander does not wish to pick this innings as his best. For him, the unbeaten 39 against Sri Lanka in Pune will remain special. 

Yesterdays 35 was also special, but not the same as Punes knock, he said. In Pune, Dhoni and myself added 82 runs in an unbroken seventh wicket partnership. The pressure was more as any further dismissal could have unsettled the teams chances. 

Im happy to have contributed to the teams cause. It was a great feeling and I enjoyed the occasion. Rahul (Dravid) and Yuvraj (Singh) had done the groundwork and I just had to make sure that the momentum was not lost. Dravid had guided me in the initial stages and the presence of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, at the other end, made it easy in the closing stages, he explained. 

How has been the experience of playing in India-Pakistan matches? I had heard so much about it. I knew the pressure element would be there. But pressure helps me perform. I thrive under such situations, he said. 

Raina is grateful to Greg Chappell for his guidance. Hes been inspirational ? I owe a lot to him. Dravid, too, has guided me a lot. He is one of my favourites and playing with him obviously gives that extra advantage, Raina remarked. 

He, though, is not resting on his achievement and is setting sights on bigger goals.

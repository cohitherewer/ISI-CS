The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav remains eligible for selection

 - Former BCCI president INDERJIT SINGH Bindras stand different from KIRAN Mores 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sourav Ganguly 

 New Delhi: For almost a 

 decade, Inderjit Singh Bindra and Jagmohan Dalmiya have 

 been going for each others jugular. Yet, the former 

 has taken a soft line on Sourav Ganguly ? viewed by many 

 as often having been protected by Dalmiya.

 To start with, Bindra (who heads 

 the slickly run Punjab Cricket Association) invited Sourav 

 to watch the second Test, which begins in Mohali on Thursday. 

 Then, in a telephonic chat with The Telegraph, declared 

 that the former Team India captain remained eligible 

 for selection. 

Thats vastly different from chief selector Kiran Mores stand. 

Unless a player has been disciplined or is unfit, he remains eligible... In any case, its for the Board to decide on the selection policy... Back in 1986, Sunil Gavaskar was reinstated after being dropped for two ODIs against Australia... 

From what I remember, the selectors didnt pick him as their focus was on the 1987 World Cup... Well, the Board got into the act and they were directed to select teams on current form and performance, Bindra, a former Board president and key member of the present regime, remarked. 

The then selection committee was headed by former captain Chandu Borde. His colleagues were A.G. Kripal Singh, Hanumant Singh, Ambar Roy and Manmohan Sood. Incidentally, Gavaskar quit after the 1987 World Cup. 

Bindra added: What the president (Sharad Pawar) stated in Nagpur is correct ? that nobody can keep out Sourav if he performs... The Board has always rewarded performance and Im not saying this because all the talk is about one individual... 

Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain and coach Intikhab Alam has termed Mores comments (chiefly we wont look back...) as unfortunate. 

Contacted in Chandigarh, he observed: Its unfortunate... Even unfair... The chief selector cant shut the door (unilaterally) on somebody working towards a comeback... Ive never met Sourav and Im looking forward to interacting with him when he comes for the Test in Mohali. 

 Intikhab has been Punjabs head coach for two 

 seasons and is going to be back in 2006-07.

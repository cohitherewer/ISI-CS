 Zlatan, Fabios homes searched

Turin: Italian tax police searched the offices of soccer champions Juventus, already reeling from allegations of match-fixing, and the homes of two of their top players on Thursday. 

Police entered Juventus headquarter as part of an investigation into the clubs dealings in the transfer market and also visited the homes of Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro, an investigative source said. 

Transcripts of telephone conversations of Juventus general manager Luciano Moggi discussing the signings of the two players have been published in Italian newspapers. Neither Ibrahimovic nor Cannavaro are under investigation by authorities. 

Magistrates have placed Juventus chief executive officer Antonio Giraudo and Moggi, who resigned last week, under investigation on suspicion of false accounting relating to the clubs transfer dealings. Legal sources said police had seized documents relating to the clubs signing of players from foreign teams.

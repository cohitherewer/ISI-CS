 Hakim leaves camp with injury

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Indias preparations for the AFC Challenge Cup in Dhaka received a jolt on Thursday when their most experienced striker, Abdul Hakim of State Bank of Travancore, was forced to leave the camp at Gwalior because of an injury. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, Hakim initially got injured during SBTs campaign in the second division of the National Football League (NFL) in Jamshedpur recently. 

Tipped to lead the side, Hakim was the seniormost player in the camp, which mainly consists of U-20 footballers. Hakim, who first played for India in 2000, was drafted in along with Israt Kamal, Kuttimani, Xavier Vijay Kumar and NP Pradeep to lend some experience to the young brigade. 

Birbal Singh of Manipur has been appointed as the assistant coach under Islam Akhmedov for the Dhaka tournament. He is likely to join the camp on Friday. 

Meanwhile, the AIFF, after two years of dilly dallying, has finally slotted the third division NFL in its calendar, which was released on Thursday. While the premier division will be held from January to May 2007 and the second division from February to April, the third division will be played during September-October 2006.

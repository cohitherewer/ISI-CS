The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: Manchester City striker Andy Cole has had more surgery on a damaged knee ligament and will be out for the rest of the season, the Premier League club said on Thursday.

 The former England forward suffered the injury against Charlton Athletic on February 12 and has not played since.

 ?Andy had another operation on his knee on Wednesday after they found some floating material in there, and as a result he will be out for the rest of the season,? manager Stuart Pearce told the club?s website on Thursday. 

 Berlin: Bayern Munich have targeted Mark van Bommel as the ideal replacement for Michael Ballack and will find out in the next few weeks if a deal can be done with Barcelona for the Dutch midfielder, chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said on Thursday.

 Bayern face the likely departure of Germany captain and playmaker Ballack, possibly to English champions Chelsea, and are keen to fill the midfield void before next season begins. Van Bommel appears to be their first choice. 

 Milan: Juventus coach Fabio Capello says his dream is to coach England.

 ?Within three years I will pack in coaching at club level and then I want to realise the dream I have always had inside me ? England,? Capello said in an interview.

 England are looking for a new coach to replace Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson who leaves after June?s World Cup. Capello recently said he intends to stay with Juventus for the coming season. 

 Hanoi: The Portuguese technical director of Vietnamese soccer side, Dong Tam Long An, is facing a six-match suspension for screaming at match officials last weekend. Henrique Calisto, who led DTLA to the title last season, is in line for the maximum penalty permissible under V-League regulations after his antics during the nail-biting 4-3 home victory over Cang Saigon on Sunday.

 Beijing: Former Olympic chief Juan Antonio Samaranch has advised Beijing organisers to make sure the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Games do not drag on too long.

 Opening ceremonies in particular have become more and more elaborate at recent Games, including pageantry and pop stars in addition to the traditional nation-by-nation parade of athletes, swearing of the Olympic oath and lighting of the Olympic flame.

 ?I believe the opening and closing ceremonies of the Beijing Olympics will be great ... but the organisers should carefully control the time,? the Spaniard said at a Sino-Spain forum in Shanghai this week. 

 Athens: Plans to construct a temporary running track at the ancient stadium of Olympia, birthplace of the Olympic Games, has upset Greek archaeologists. 

 The Central Archaeological Council (CAS) has 

 vetoed proposals to instal a modern track over the original 

 one in the stadium for an international athletics event 

 backed by the IOC.

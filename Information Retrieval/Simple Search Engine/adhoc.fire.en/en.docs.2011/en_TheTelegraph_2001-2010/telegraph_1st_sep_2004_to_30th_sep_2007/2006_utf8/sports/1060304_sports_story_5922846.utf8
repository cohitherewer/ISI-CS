The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Madrid: The mayor of Zaragoza has invited Barcelona?s Samuel Eto?o to visit the Spanish city with his family in order to prove that the citizens there are not racist.

 The Cameroon striker tried to leave the pitch last Saturday after Real Zaragoza fans directed racist abuse at the player during their Primera Liga match. Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard and players persuaded him to finish the game, though the insults continued to the end.

 ?I wasn?t at the game but I heard it on the radio and was ashamed. I was so outraged I decided to do something,? Mayor Juan Alberto Belloch was quoted as saying in a newspaper on Friday.

 In his invitation letter to Eto?o, he said: ?I would like to offer you the chance to meet the people of my city. Zaragoza is a friendly, open, tolerant and multi-cultural place.? 

 Cobham: Chelsea?s Frank Lampard will miss Saturday?s Premier League game at West Bromich Albion because of a hamstring injury and may struggle to be fit for Tuesday?s Champions League showdown with Barcelona.

 The 27-year-old midfield stalwart, who has sat out only one other Premier League game this season, was sent home from England?s training camp this week and missed the friendly against Uruguay after tweaking the hamstring in training.

 France defender William Gallas, who missed the 1-2 home defeat by Barcelona in the first leg of the knockout round tie 10 days ago, could return from a knee injury for the second leg and may not be risked on Saturday. 

 Sydney: Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe said his health was improving after a battle with a mystery virus that disrupted his preparations for this month?s Commonwealth Games. Thorpe has been unable to take drugs that could help clear up the problem because the medication is on the banned list. ?I?m getting better and it?s actually the best I?ve felt in a while,? Thorpe said on Friday. 

 Australia?s head coach Alan Thompson said there was still no guarantee Thorpe would be ready to compete in the March 15-26 Games in Melbourne but the signs were positive.

 Beijing: Asian sports powerhouse China will form their first-ever national golf team to develop the sport in the country ahead of the Asian Games in Doha, a senior official said.

 The first big-scale national training camp has been opened in Shenzhen in order to select the best golfers for the national squad, executive vice president of Chinese Golf Association (CGA) Zhang Xiaoning said. 

 Currently there are few professional golfers in china and the coaching level remains to be improved.

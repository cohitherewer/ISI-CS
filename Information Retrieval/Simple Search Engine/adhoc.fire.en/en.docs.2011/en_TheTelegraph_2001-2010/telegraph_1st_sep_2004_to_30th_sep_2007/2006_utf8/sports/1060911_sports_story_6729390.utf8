 Saurav, Joshna best

New Delhi: Saurav Ghosal and Joshna Chinappa came through contrasting fortunes to pocket the mens and womens titles, respectively at the 54th National Squash Championships here on Sunday. 

World No. 50 Ghosal razed down fourth seed Gaurav Nandrajog 9-3, 9-2, 9-6 in a somewhat one-sided contest while 54th ranked Joshna had to subdue a spirited challenge from Dipika Pallikal 9-2, 9-5, 9-4 for her fifth straight triumph. 

It was Ghosals second national crown, which came after 44 minutes and fetched him Rs 40,000 in winners cheque. 

Joshna did not have it easy as the scoreline might suggest.

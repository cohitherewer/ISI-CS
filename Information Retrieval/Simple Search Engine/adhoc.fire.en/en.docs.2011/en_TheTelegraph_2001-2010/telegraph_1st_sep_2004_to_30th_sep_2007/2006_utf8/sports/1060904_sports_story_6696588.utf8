 Brazil put 3 past Argentina 

London: Elano scored first- and second-half goals on Sunday, leading Brazil to a 3-0 victory over Argentina in a friendly before 59,032 at Arsenals Emirates Stadium. 

Elano, a little-known 25-year-old midfielder who plays for Ukrainian team Shakhtar Donetsk, scored in the third minute and again in the 67th for his first two international goals. Kaka added the third in the 89th with a run that started in his own half. But Elanos starring role illustrated the B-team nature of Brazils team. 

Ronaldinho watched the game from the stands, sitting out with what Brazil coach Dunga called a minor back injury. He missed the Spanish league opener with FC Barcelona with a thigh injury. 

Of Brazils 11 starters, only three started in Brazils quarter final loss to France at the World Cup. Argentina, with Alfio Basile coaching his first game since replacing Jose Pekerman, started six players who were in the first 11 in the World Cup quarter final loss to Germany. (AP)

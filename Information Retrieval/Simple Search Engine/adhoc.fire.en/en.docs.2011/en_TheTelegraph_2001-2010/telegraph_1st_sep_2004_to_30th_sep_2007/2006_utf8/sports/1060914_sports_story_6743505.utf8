 No more camps, Team India face real action today

Kuala Lumpur: Camps, rolling or otherwise, are a thing of the past. For Team India, the real action begins Thursday against the West Indies, a team which won the last bilateral one-day series 4-1, and on a wicket which was damp on match-eve. 

The West Indies defeat in the DLF Cup opener notwithstanding, the Indians task actually is cut out. Captain Rahul Dravid acknowledged as much: Well have to play at the top of our game... Weve got to hit the ground running hard... 

Without getting into specifics, he said the best XI would be fielded, implying no fancy experiments would be attempted. 

To an extent, Dravid did show concern over the Kinrara Oval wicket (different from Tuesdays one). I wouldnt like to bat first if it remains damp... One cant say how its going to look at the toss, because it will be exposed to the sun tomorrow... The wicket has cracks, too. 

 Dravid didnt see much of match No.1, where world champions Australia won big, but remarked: The Australians must have played very well to come back in the manner they did... Obviously, the West Indies couldnt build on their opening partnership... 

Not one to concede psychological points, Dravid insisted the 1-4 loss in the West Indies (in May) wasnt playing on his players minds. To be honest, that was a while back and one moves on... Moreover, there was a Test series after the ODIs and we did well... 

He accepted Yuvraj Singh would be missed. Hes a very important player and a very successful one... He has been a crucial finisher for us, but his absence will give somebody a chance... Hopefully, somebody else is going to take the finishers responsibility... 

[Board secretary Niranjan Shah told The Telegraph that Yuvraj, who had to stay back on account of illness, is arriving Thursday morning. Its confirmed... Hes coming from New Delhi.] 

Captain Brian Lara didnt interact with the Media, but Shivnarine Chanderpaul did. No surprise that he spoke about Sachin Tendulkar: We all know what hes capable of, but the wicket may not be easy... 

Chanderpaul is, of course, hoping the ball rolls the West Indies way. Every win will help us as were on the down... The former captain top-scored with 92 in the opener, but felt the wicket was such one couldve been dismissed at any time. 

All 14 are available for selection and theres speculation that Marlon Samuels could get a look-in. 

Incidentally, the last time both Sachin and Lara featured in the same ODI was over four years ago and, so, much of the attention has to be on them. With a blast and foul weather scrapping two tournaments in Sri Lanka last month, the Kinrara Oval face-off is to mark Sachins comeback after six months. 

While on Sachin, he and Harbhajan Singh are the only survivors from the Indian squad (captained by Ajay Jadeja) which came to Kuala Lumpur for the 1998 Commonwealth Games. 

That was a different competition, not that the Indians took home any medal, but with the Champions Trophy just weeks away, a best-foot-forward performance is absolutely imperative. 

Hopefully, once the Indians are on the park, the turnout is going to get handsome. On Tuesday, hardly anybody thought it fit to put in an appearance. In any case, the distance is a deterrent of sorts.

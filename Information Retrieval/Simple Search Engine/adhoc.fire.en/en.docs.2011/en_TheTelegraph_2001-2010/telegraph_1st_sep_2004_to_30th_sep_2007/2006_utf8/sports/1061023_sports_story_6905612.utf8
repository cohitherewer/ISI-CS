 Ponting promises hostile reception

 - Ashes series McGrath targets Pietersen 

Jaipur: Australia skipper Ricky Ponting has warned England batsmen to prepare for some hostile bowling when they arrive to defend the Ashes next month. 

Australian pacemen gave an early indication of what to expect with several sharp bouncers during the sides emphatic six-wicket victory in a Champions Trophy group match on Saturday to all but eliminate England from the competition. 

The teams were meeting for the first time since England triumphed 2-1 on home soil last year to regain the Ashes after an 18-year wait. 

Ponting said short-pitched bowling would be a key weapon against both rival skipper Andrew Flintoff and the rest of the England batsman at the Ashes series starting with the first Test in Brisbane on November 23. 

Asked after the game whether Flintoff would be a target, he said: I think we can for sure. A lot of their players like to play that shot (pull). 

At certain times through the last Ashes series we felt the grounds were quite small in England and a lot of them were going over our heads. 

Weve big grounds in Australia, so we might have some success. 

Ponting had promised to target the explosive Flintoff after the allrounder promoted himself to number three in the order to score quick runs in the early overs. The move backfired in the opening game defeat against hosts India, where he was out for a duck. He made four on Saturday. 

The Aussie skipper had vowed to expose Flintoffs lack of experience against the new ball, although England openers added 83 runs to prevent that scenario. 

Still, Flintoff conceded some ground in the war of nerves after he swapped spots with the aggressive Kevin Pietersen, the regular number four. Pietersen was out for one. 

Allrounder Shane Watson forced Flintoff to fend a short delivery, pitched the next one up, and forced him to top-edge a pull off the third, a bouncer, to be caught at midwicket. 

Meanwhile, paceman Glenn McGrath says he will be targeting the wicket of Pietersen in the Ashes series. Pietersen, labelled by Ponting as crickets next superstar, is one of the games big entertainers and McGrath says his wicket will be prized in the five-Test series. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Cricket at grassroots in China 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: It could be labelled the Silent Revolution. Believe it or not, China has 30 level-I cricket coaches! And, come 2008 (the Beijing Olympics year), the national team will make its near-big league debut when it competes in the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Trophy, qualifiers for the 2010 Asia Cup. 

Traditionally, the finalists join the four Test-playing nations from the region ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh ? in a face-off to determine Asias No.1 in limited overs cricket. 

Thats confirmed... The Chinese Cricket Association (CCA) is taking appreciable strides, ACC chief executive Syed Ashraful Huq told The Telegraph on Wednesday. Speaking in his plush office (the majestic Petronas Towers, incidentally, are clearly visible), he added that the CCA is also going to field teams in the U-15 tournament to be hosted by Thailand in December and the ACCs U-17 and 19 competitions in 2007. 

The coaches received their certificates after tests conducted by Cricket Australia (CA) and ACC instructors. The instructors made two trips to China and a handsome number qualified, Huq said. 

The ACC and CA have been working together for some years now. 

According to Huq, the CCA is focusing on schools and its emphasis on grassroots is laudable. Obviously, in time, the structure of Chinese cricket will be solid, he remarked. The laws have already been translated into Mandarin. 

Huq, who is busy with preparations for the AGM here on June 18, informed that CCA vice-chairman Cui Zhi Qiang is to be one of the speakers at a high profile ACC-organised seminar on the eve of the once-a-year session. 

The International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive, Malcolm Speed, is going to be present as a special invitee. 

Meanwhile, BCCI chief Sharad Pawars term as ACC president ends on June 18. As the top post is rotated, its Sri Lankas turn to nominate the president. Its not necessary that the Sri Lanka Cricket chief, Jayanta Dharmadasa, will head the ACC as well. 

Huq confirmed that the latest edition of the Asia Cup, which was scheduled to have been held this year, is going to be staged by Pakistan in early 2008. It has been listed in the ICCs Future Tours Programme, he pointed out. 

This postponement, though, has particularly hurt the UAE and Oman. After all, finishing in the top two of the last ACC Trophy (2004) became of no use and both will need to do a repeat in this Augusts qualifiers in order to rub shoulders with the Big Boys in 2008. 

Kuwait and Thailand, by the way, are going to be elevated as Full Members of the ACC. 

Footnote: No decision has been taken on edition No. 2 of the Jagmohan Dalmiya-conceived Afro-Asian Cup. The inaugural competition was hosted by South Africa ten months ago.

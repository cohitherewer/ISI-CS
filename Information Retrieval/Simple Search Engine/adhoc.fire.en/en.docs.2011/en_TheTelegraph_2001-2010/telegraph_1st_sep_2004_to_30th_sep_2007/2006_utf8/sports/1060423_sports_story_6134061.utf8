 Sreesanth bats for special kids

 Kochi: Indias fast 

 bowling sensation Sreesanth showed his generous heart when 

 he donated the entire cash award of Rs 1 lakh, given to 

 him by a regional newspaper, to a school for special 

 children. 

Sreesanth, who had won the prize money for being adjudged Star of the Year by the daily, met the students of the Adarsh School in Kureekkad on Friday. 

 The cricketerspent a few hours 

 talking to some of the nearly 100-odd students who are suffering 

 from cerebral palsy and autism. 

Sreeram, a child affected by cerebral palsy and son of former Kerala player Babu Venkatesh, shared with the bowler some of his views on the game. 

 Sreesanth said his prayers would 

 always be there for the children.

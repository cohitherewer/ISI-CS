 Azhar presence raises questions

 - I dont think theres any bar on a banned cricketer coming to the ground: Prof. Shetty 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mohammed Azharuddin 

Mumbai: Somebody connected with the International Cricket Council (ICC) has questioned banned former captain Mohammed Azharuddins presence ? shown live on TV ? in the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) Presidents Box on Day-I of the third and final India-England Test, at the Wankhede, on Saturday. 

Impropriety crops up... The MCA is free to invite who it wants, but how can somebody banned (for life) on account of his involvement with match-fixing, be seen in the company/vicinity of Indian board officials? The signal that sends is... the gentleman told The Telegraph. 

Azhar came in the first session itself and left before tea. He first sat close to Board secretary Niranjan Shah and former president Inderjit Singh Bindra. Later, he joined former vice-president (and a sitting Rajya Sabha member) Rajeev Shukla in the first row. Among others, seated there was host Sharad Pawar. 

Pawar, of course, heads both the MCA and the Board. 

I dont think theres any bar on a banned cricketer coming to the ground... What the ICC has said is that no such individual should get accreditation, explained MCA treasurer Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, who is also the Boards executive secretary in-charge. 

He added: Since Mr Pawar took over, the MCA has been inviting former India captains based in Mumbai... We even invite somebody who happens to be in town in the lead-up to a Test or ODI... In fact, Azhar came on one of the days of the last Test (versus Australia, 16 months ago) as well... 

Incidentally, the ICC advisory on accreditation was issued after Azhar ? banned by the Board in December 2000 ? got a Media pass during the 2004 Asia Cup in Sri Lanka. The tournament was conducted by the Asian Cricket Council.

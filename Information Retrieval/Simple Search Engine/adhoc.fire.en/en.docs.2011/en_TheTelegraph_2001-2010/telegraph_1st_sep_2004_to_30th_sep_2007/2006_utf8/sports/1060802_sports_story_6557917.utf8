 Sehwag refutes Wrights statement

Bangalore: Indian vice-captain Virender Sehwag on Tuesday rebutted John Wrights statement that there was zonal bias in team selection, saying five men are involved in picking a player and talent cannot be hidden for long. 

Talented players are picked whether he is from West or North zone, Sehwag said at a press conference on Tuesday. 

Obviously when you have a North zone selector in the committee, he will make a mention about players (in those states) who have been performing well. 

The player does not get selected because he is from North zone. Ultimately it is the joint decision of five selectors, he said on the final day of the fitness camp here. 

If you want more details you speak to Wright as he had attended all meetings in his five-year stint, he added. 

Wright, former Team India coach, had said in his recently published book Indian Summers, that Indias selection system was flawed as it was based on zonal quota. 

Sehwag welcomed the return of Sachin Tendulkar after an injury-induced layoff and confirmed that the duo will open the innings in the tri-series in Sri Lanka. 

On eight or nine different players with whom he has opened the innings during the past year, Sehwag said it did not affect him. It depends on what combination we use and require. Obviously, if Tendulkar is there, he and myself will open, he said. 

Winning matches is more important. Maintaining the same batting order does not mean anything to me. All teams in the world experiment in one-day matches.

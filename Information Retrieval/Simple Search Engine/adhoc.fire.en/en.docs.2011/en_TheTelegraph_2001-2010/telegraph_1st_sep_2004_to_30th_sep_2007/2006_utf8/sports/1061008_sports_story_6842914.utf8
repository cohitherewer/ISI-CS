 My dream is to play a Test at Eden, says Brian Lara

Ahmedabad: Batting world record holder Brian Lara has one last wish to fulfil before he hangs his boots. 

My dream is to play a Test match at the Eden Gardens. Hopefully I can last that long, the West Indian said on Saturday. 

However, how that wish of Laras can be fulfilled remains to be seen with the West Indies scheduled to tour India not before November 2011, according to the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP). 

The batting genius considers himself unfortunate not to have played too many Tests in the real home of cricket. 

They say Lords is the home of cricket but I think in terms of the actual game, India is the home of cricket, Lara said at a press conference on the eve of the West Indies first qualifying match in the Champions Trophy against Zimbabwe. 

The passion for cricket in India is more than in any other part of the world. The spectators are passionate not only for the hosts but also for all other teams who play well. 

Lara, who has played only three Tests in India during the 1994-95 series, said he hoped to come back here in January for a triangular series.

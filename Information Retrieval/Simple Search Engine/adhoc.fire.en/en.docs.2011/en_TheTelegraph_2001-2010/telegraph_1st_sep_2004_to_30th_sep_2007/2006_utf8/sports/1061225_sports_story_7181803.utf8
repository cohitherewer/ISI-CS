 Steyn undergoes fitness test

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Durban: Speedster Dale Steyn, the quickest in South Africa, underwent a fitness test at Kingsmead on Sunday afternoon. He came through fine, but chief selector Haroon Lorgat didnt commit himself. 

Were in no hurry to decide on his availability for the second Test... We may not take a decision till just before the toss on Tuesday, he told The Telegraph. 

Owing to a left thigh strain, Steyn wasnt even able to bowl till the end of the first day of the Wanderers Test. That hurt South Africa. 

Sections of the South African Media, incidentally, have been calling for Lorgats head. That hes understood to have asked for a higher retainership from Cricket South Africa hasnt been well received either. 

Im not going to jump the ship was Lorgats response when a TV channel asked if he intended to quit.

 Tougher challenge for Kaneria

 - Chilly weather will make things difficult for spinners 

 Kaneria is being billed as Pakistans trump card against India 

Karachi: Billed as Pakistans trump card against India, champion spinner Danish Kaneria says it will be a new and tougher challenge for him, though he is determined and motivated to play a leading role in the home series. 

The series will be tough for me in several ways, like different balls to be used in the series and tough weather conditions in which the Tests would be played, Kaneria said. 

But the bottomline is that it will be a new series and we as a team will not try to live in the past glories. We will rather try to extend our success run, Kaneria, who sparkled in Pakistans recent victory against England, said. 

The 25-year-old, who took 19 wickets against India last year, said the Tests would be played in the chilly Punjab weather that would make it difficult for spinners to bowl. 

The fingers take time to warm up and sometimes you struggle to properly use the wrist. I think my experience with Essex would help me in the series against India in more than one way, he said. 

Kaneria said he was getting adjusted to playing with different kind of balls in international cricket as he bowled with SG balls in India and Kookaburras against England at home. 

I know different bowlers prefer to bowl with certain balls but I am a professional who would like to be equally good with whichever ball I bowl with, Kaneria said. 

I mean in England (with Essex), I bowl with Dukes. In professional circuit, you should know how to ball with different balls because there is no excuse in international cricket, said Kaneria, who took 49 wickets in nine Tests in 2005. 

India arrive on Thursday on their second tour of Pakistan in three years and play Pakistan in the first Test in Lahore to be followed by Tests in Faisalabad and Karachi. 

Kaneria was diplomatic when asked which Indian batsmen he would be targeting. 

There is no specific Indian I would be targeting. India have a strong batting line-up and to win a Test, we will have to bowl them out. I would be more than happy to grab as many frontline batsmen as I can. 

On paper, India have the strongest batting line-up in the world. We know that and we are chalking out strategies to counter that. I will be regularly talking and consulting my captain and coach because their experience and advice will surely help me, Kaneria said. 

The Karachi-born bowler, who celebrated his 25th birthday on December 16, said there was no shortage of confidence in the Pakistan team. 

There is nothing like winning and the victories in tough games and from crunch situations has given us the confidence that we can beat any team from any situation. 

Each player is bubbling with confidence and I am sure like me, all the players are waiting for the series against India to start. This is the mother of all series, Kaneria said.

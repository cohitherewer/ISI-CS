 Indian men win, eves lose

Turin: Indian men scored a come from behind victory over Bulgaria with Krishnan Sasikiran and Sandipan Chanda coming out good in the eighth round of the 37th Chess Olympiad here. 

While Viswanathan Anand played out his fifth draw on the trot, settling for peace this time with former world junior champion Kiril Georgiev, national champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly suffered a defeat at the hands of Alexander Delchev. 

Among the women, Indian mainstay Koneru Humpy had a rare off day as India suffered defeat for the second successive day, going down 1-2 against Armenia in the womens Chess Olympiad. 

Humpy fumbled against Lilit Mkrtchian to encounter her first defeat in the event and Woman Grandmaster D. Harika also had a similar fate in store. National women champion and WGM Swati Ghate won an engrossing battle to thwart a whitewash. 

India were saved the blushes, however, by a late onslaught by Sasikiran and Sandipan, who beat Ivan Cheparinov and Vasil Spasov, respectively to ensure victory. 

At the top of the table, Armenia yet again proved that they were the team to beat this time with a comprehensive 3-1 victory over Cuba. The Russians could only manage a 2-2 draw with Czech Republic which gave Armenia a two point lead over their nearest rivals, Russia and Ukraine. 

Armenia is on 24 points. Both Russia and Ukraine are on 22. However, there is a four-way tie for fourth spot with China, Georgia, France and United States on 21.5 points each.

 Juergen pours cold water on Bayern plan

 Berlin: Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann poured cold water on demands from Bayern Munich to include 35-year-old Mehmet Scholl in his World Cup squad ? four years after the playmaker retired from international competition. 

Scholl, who has had a strong year at Bayern after years of injuries and now specialises in coming off the bench late in the second half, has scored five important goals this season in the Bundesliga and German Cup. 

Bayern coach Felix Magath has said Scholl would be a valuable playmaker for Klinsmann to use as a substitute when he needed a late goal. 

Klinsmann did not include Scholl in fitness testing for the final squad. 

Were delighted that hes doing so well again, he said. 

But our priority is on the players that are with us now at the fitness tests. 

 Berlin: Striker Roy Makaay responded to being omitted from the Dutch World Cup provisional squad of 33 by scoring two goals for Bayern Munich on Sunday. Just two days after he was snubbed by Dutch coach Marco Van Basten, Makaay produced one of his strongest performances of the season. 

 Makaay admitted he had feared his exclusion from the tournament that begins in Germany on June 9. I had a feeling it was coming, Makaay said on Sunday. 

Asked if he thought he still had a chance of receiving a late call-up, he said: You always want to keep some hope in the back of your mind. You never know what could happen. 

 London: Australia goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer should be fit for the World Cup after undergoing surgery on a fractured cheekbone on Monday, his club Middlesbrough said. 

Schwarzer was injured playing in their FA Cup semi-final against West Ham a 1-0 defeat on Sunday. He collided with West Ham striker Dean Ashton and had to come off. Mark is likely to miss the rest of Middlesbroughs season but should be okay for the World Cup, the clubs chief medical officer told the clubs website. 

Meanwhile, Harry Kewell has a groin problem and Tim Cahill a knee injury. Mark Viduka has a thigh injury. 

 Madrid: Real Madrid striker Antonio Cassano is worried about his chances of making the Italy squad for the World Cup finals. 

I havent lost hope but I think it is going to be very difficult, Cassano told reporters after Sundays 2-1 win over Malaga in the Bernabeu. I am not playing very much with my club and usually it is only those who are playing regularly who go.

 Jadeja slams selectors

Jaipur: Ajay Jadeja slammed the selectors on Friday for targetting individuals and robbing youngsters of confidence by their shabby treatment of players like Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S. Laxman. 

The team management always talks about future but the present is also important. Think about poor Laxman who has been performing well but finds himself in and out time and again. 

Even Sourav was treated badly. Despite good performances, he was treated shabbily, said Jadeja. (PTI)

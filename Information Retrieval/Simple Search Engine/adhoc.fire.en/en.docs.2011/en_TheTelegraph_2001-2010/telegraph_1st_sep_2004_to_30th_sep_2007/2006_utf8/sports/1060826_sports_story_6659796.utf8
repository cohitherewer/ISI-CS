Calcutta: In a battle of wits, K. Sasikiran had the last laugh at the 18th PSPB Inter-Unit Chess Tournament at Tollygunge Club on Friday. 

Both Sasikiran and Koneru Humpy finished with 7.5 points after nine rounds, but the latter had a lower Median Buchulz (a tie-breaking scoring system) and had to be content with second-place. 

Third place went jointly to GM R.B. Ramesh (IOC) and his teammate GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly with 7.0 points. 

Overnight leader Surya Sekhar lost his final round game against Humpy. 

Sasikiran, on the other hand, won his crucial final round match against M.R. Venkatesh en route to bagging the title. 

Defending champion S. Arun Prasad drew with Deepan Chakkravarthy to finish at seventh spot. 

 FINAL STANDINGS 

1. K. Sasikiran (7.5); 2. Koneru Humpy (7.5); 3. R.B. Ramesh (7), Surya Sekhar Ganguly (7); 5. Deepan Chakkravorthy (6.5); 6. Neelotpal Das (6.5); 7. S. Arun Prasad (6.5); 8. M.R. Venkatesh (6); 9. P. Konguvel (6); 10. Abhijit Kunte (6); 11. Nisha Mohota (6); 12. V. Koshy (6).

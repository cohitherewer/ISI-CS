 Liverpool ride 

 Gerrard strike

 Premier League

 London: 

 Captain Steven Gerrard scored his first Premier League goal 

 of the season to give Liverpool a 1-0 victory over Manchester 

 City on Saturday.

 Gerrard broke forward after 68 

 minutes to beat City keeper Nicky Weaver with a fierce 

 shot from 20 metres and clinch eighth-placed Liverpools 

 sixth home league win of the season.

 Aston Villa moved above Arsenal 

 into fourth spot after a 1-1 draw at home to Middlesbrough.

 Gareth Barry equalised for the 

 hosts from the penalty spot on the stroke of half-time after 

 Malcolm Christie had put Boro ahead against the run of play.

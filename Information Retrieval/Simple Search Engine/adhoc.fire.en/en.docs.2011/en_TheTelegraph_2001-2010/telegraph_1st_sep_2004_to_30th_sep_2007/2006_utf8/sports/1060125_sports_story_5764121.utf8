 Ill fight on, says Shabbir

Faisalabad: Pakistan pace bowler Shabbir Ahmed said he will continue to fight to overturn his 12-month ban from international cricket. 

The 29 year old was the first player to receive a years suspension under the revised International Cricket Council bowling review regulations after his action was reported twice in 2005. 

I am very disappointed that the appeal has been turned down, Shabbir said on Tuesday. 

The PCB director of cricket operations, Saleem Altaf, said the board was exploring all possibilities to get the ban reduced. Altaf confirmed PCB may seek legal advice on the matter as Shabbir cannot file another appeal. (Reuters)

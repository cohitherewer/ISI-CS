 No place for Sourav in Rest of India squad

 - Time for former Team India captain to review options

Chennai: After his failures in the Challenger Trophy, Sourav Gangulys inclusion in the Rest of India squad would have been seen as a big favour on the part of the selection committee, headed by Dilip Vengsarkar. 

Its no surprise, therefore, that the former Team India captain, who scored 24 and 3 for India Green in the Challenger Trophy, hasnt found a place in the 14-member squad. 

The match against Ranji Trophy champions Uttar Pradesh will be played in Nagpur from October 9 to 13. 

Now that he is not in the Rest of India squad, Sourav will have nothing to show when the selectors meet to pick the squad for South Africa at some point during the forthcoming Champions Trophy. 

Bengals first Ranji match, after all, is against Punjab in Mohali from November 23. Its time for the former Team India captain to review options. 

Indias tour of South Africa begins with the one-day series on November 19. The first Test is in Johannesburg from December 15. 

Bengal off-spinner Sourashish Lahiri has been included in the squad which also has Zaheer Khan. The Baroda pacer got the nod ahead of Tamil Nadus Laxmipathy Balaji in the Rest side that will be led by Mumbai opener Wasim Jaffer. 

VVS Laxman was another big name missing from the list, but the Hyderabad batsman suffered a hamstring injury a few days ago and did not play in the Challenger Trophy. 

Hyderabads Pragyan Ojha was the surprise inclusion in the side. The 20-year-old left-arm chinaman bowler took 33 wickets in seven Ranji matches last season. With the wicket in Nagpur expected to aid spin, Ojha may hog the limelight. 

Vengsarkar, however, said Sourav still had a chance to make a comeback. 

Everybody, including Sourav, who played in the Challenger was discussed. Players like Sourav, Balaji and a few others will be playing in zonal tournaments and depending on their performances they will come in for contention, Vengsarkar told reporters. 

Vengsarkar, who replaced Kiran More as chairman, said Zaheers impressive showing in the English County was the reason behind picking him ahead of Balaji. 

Both bowled extremely well in the Challenger Trophy. 

The committee gave recognition to Zaheers performance in County cricket as Balaji came to this tournament after recovering from an injury, he said. 

Reiterating that the doors were not closed on any player, Vengsarkar said consistency would be the key for selection. He said Laxman would be in contention once he recovered from injury and sta- rted playing competitive cricket. 

Laxman was not discussed. But once he recovered (from injury) and played in zonal tournament, he will also be considered for selection, he said. 

Pacer Yo Mahesh inclusion is also interesting since people in the know suggest that he is destined for bigger things. 

The other notable exclusion was Parthiv Patel whose batting was a revelation in the Challenger. 

Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said that Mohammed Kaif, Suresh Raina and Rudra Pratap Singh, who feature in the Champions Trophy squad, would not be playing for UP.

Manama: Ferraris Michael Schumacher seized pole for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday and added another Formula One record to his collection. 

Brazilian teammate Felipe Massa, in his first race for Ferrari, will line up alongside the seven-time world champion on Sunday for his first front row start. 

Its an amazing result. All winter we knew we seemed to have a good package but then you wait for the final confirmation. Here we have the confirmation, Schumacher said. Its a nice way to be back and a great feeling. 

With the knock-out qualifying format making an entertaining debut at the windy desert circuit, Britains Jenson Button (Honda) and Spanish world champion Fernando Alonso (Renault) filled the second row. 

Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya was fifth for McLaren, ahead of Brazilian Rubens Barrichello in the second Honda. 

 Schumachers accomplished lap was the perfect start for the once-dominant team after a dismal 2005, allowing the 37-year-old to equal Brazilian Ayrton Sennas record of 65 pole positions. 

It was his first pole since Hungary last year and Ferraris first front row sweep since Hungary in 2004. 

 Asked about Sennas record, Schumacher said: It makes me proud. That is probably all I can say about it. 

McLarens Kimi Raikkonen, last years runner-up, was the big casualty after he failed to complete a timed lap due to a suspected suspension failure.

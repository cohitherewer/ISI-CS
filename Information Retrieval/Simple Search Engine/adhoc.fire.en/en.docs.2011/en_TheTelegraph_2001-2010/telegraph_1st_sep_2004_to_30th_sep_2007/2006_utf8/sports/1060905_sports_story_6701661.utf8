The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anupam may get a start vs Saudi Arabia

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: East Bengal stopper-back Anupam Sarkar is likely to be the only new face in the starting line-up of the Indian team in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers against Saudi Arabia to be played at Jeddah on Wednesday. The rest of the team will likely be the same that lost to Saudi Arabia 0-3 in Calcutta. 

Speaking from Jeddah, team manager Pradeep Chowdhury said that Sarkar might play in place of seasoned midfielder Venkatesh, who could not make the trip because of injury. The final team, will, however, be picked by Bob (Houghton) on the day of the match, he said. 

The Indian team, which arrived in Jeddah on Sunday evening, watched the Saudi Arabia versus Japan match at the Prince Abdullah Al Faisal Stadium and was quite impressed by the home teams showings. 

While Houghton and his entire coaching staff were present for the Saudi tie, all the Indian footballers, barring Micky Fernandes and Sameer Naik, preferred to stay back at the hotel. More than anything, it is the temperature that is bothering us the most, the manager said.

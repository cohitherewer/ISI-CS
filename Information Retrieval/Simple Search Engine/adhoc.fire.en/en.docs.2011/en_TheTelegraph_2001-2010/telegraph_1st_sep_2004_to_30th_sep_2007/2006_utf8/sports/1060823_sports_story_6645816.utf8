 Its a big loss, says Jugraj

Chandigarh: Jugraj Singh, who survived a car crash about three years ago, said on Tuesday drag-flicker Sandeep Singhs injury was a big loss to the team. 

Sandeeps injury is a big loss to the whole team. He is such a fine player. I will pray that he recovers at the earliest, said Jugraj, who was on his way to Delhi. 

On whether he is ready to take the responsibility if given a chance, Jugraj said: At the moment, my confidence level is high. I am prepared to give my hundred per cent. 

Olympian and national selector Harmeek Singh said it was sheer bad luck for Sandeep and the team that the 21-year-old was injured just before the World Cup. 

It (drag-flick) is a specialised job. We have groomed him for such a long time to come to this level. 

We called him goal machine. One positive way of looking at his injury is that the whole team should draw inspiration and motivation to win the forthcoming tournaments, he said.

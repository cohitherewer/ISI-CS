The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ronaldinho can match Diegos 1986 

 class

Free-Kick

P.K.Banerjee

The clock has started ticking. 

 A glance at the sports pages of newspapers every morning 

 will tell you how close we are to the World Cup. The mega 

 event the world looks forward to every four years will kick 

 off in about a month and a half, and though the European 

 club season is still not over, the focus is gradually shifting 

 to Germany.

 The first leg semi-final matches 

 of the Champions League featured a clutch of superstars 

 and not-so-famous ones who will be asked to play key roles 

 for their respective countries at the World Cup. Showing 

 off their skills were Ronaldinho, Kaka, Gilberto, Serginho, 

 Cafu, Dida of Brazil; Henry, Pires, Giuly of France; Riquelme, 

 Sorin of Argentina; Nesta, Gattuso of Italy.

 If I were to find a common thread 

 in the performance of the teams during the two nights, I 

 would have to say that players with cutting edge looked 

 in good form. The likes of Ronaldinho, Kaka, Gilberto, Henry, 

 Riquelme, Nesta did enough to suggest they are ready for 

 the World Cup. The Barcelona versus AC Milan game was one 

 of the finest in recent times. It had everything you wish 

 to see in a game of soccer ? speed, good combination of 

 play, great individual skills, solid defensive work and 

 a brilliant goal.

 Milan, playing at home, started 

 with aplomb and created two excellent chances in the first 

 half. Gilardino hit the post, while Shevchenkos header 

 was palmed away. Gilardino wasted another opportunity shortly 

 after half-time. 

 All these while the scoreline 

 was nil-nil. It could have been a different story had Inzaghi 

 been on the pitch.

 Barcelona took control of proceedings 

 late in the first half. But it was during a 25-minute spell 

 after change of ends, when the peerless Ronaldinho was at 

 his best, that Barcelona really stamped their class. The 

 Brazilian split the Milan defence with a magical pass and 

 Giuly, showing great anticipation, finished it off with 

 a fine left-footer.

 Ronaldinho didnt play at 

 full throttle for the entire 90 minutes. When he did, even 

 the organised Milan defence ? led by the redoubtable Nesta 

 and the towering Jaap Stam ? was at its wits end to 

 stop him. Ronaldinho started on the left, then moved rightwards 

 before working his magic down the centre.

 Ronaldinho uses a deceptive body 

 movement to work up a devastating dribble. At times, Ronaldinho 

 just walks with the ball, daring the defender to challenge 

 him. 

 More often than not, the defender 

 doesnt have the courage to commit himself to the final 

 tackle as he is so wary of the unpredictable Brazilian. 

 The fact that he fooled someone of Nestas stature 

 was a statement of Ronaldinhos pedigree.

 Brazil, as always, will be one 

 of the big favourites to win the World Cup. And if that 

 happens, I wont be surprised if Ronaldinho plays a 

 very major role, something like what Maradona did in Argentinas 

 1986 triumph.

 Coming to Wednesdays match, 

 I must say that I was disappointed with the way Arsenal 

 struggled against Villarreal. Yes, the Spanish side has 

 a very good midfield manned by Argentines Riquelme and Sorin, 

 but

 I expected Arsenal to dominate 

 more, especially since they were playing at Highbury. The 

 Gunners won by a solitary goal, but the story could have 

 been different had Villarreal not been denied a genuine 

 penalty before Toure had scored.

 Thierry Henry didnt have 

 his best game, but the signs are good. The Frenchman seemed 

 a trifle slower than normal, but was still the fastest with 

 the ball among the 22 on field. He also showed his characteristic 

 skills in one-vs-one situations.

 In the past, the Arsenal striker 

 has been accused of reserving his best for the club and 

 not for the country. This is his last chance to prove his 

 detractors wrong. I think hes determined to excel 

 for France in Germany.

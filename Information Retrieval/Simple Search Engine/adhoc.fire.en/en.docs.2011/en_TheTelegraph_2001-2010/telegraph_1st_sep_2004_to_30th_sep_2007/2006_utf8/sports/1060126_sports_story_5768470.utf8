 Hiddink favourite to replace Eriksson 

 Guus Hiddink 

London: Guus Hiddink has emerged as the favourite to replace Sven-Goran Eriksson as England coach following the announcement that the Swede will step down after the World Cup in Germany in June and July. 

Despite pressure for Eriksson to be replaced by an Englishman, Dutchman Hiddink, who will be in charge of Australia in Germany, was installed as the bookmakers favourite to take on the most high-pressure job in international football management. 

But Hiddinks agent Cees van Nieuwenhuizen said his client was happy both in his post as PSV coach, which has another season to run, and on concentrating on Australia during the World Cup. 

After that if something comes up he will look at it but it does not make sense to comment. There has been no contact, said Van Nieuwenhuizen. 

There is a reference in his contract if a top club would come by and wanted to have a discussion we are allowed to have that discussion, but in that clause there is not a reference to a federation ? except he can go to a World Cup with a federation, in this case Australia. 

Bolton boss Sam Allardyce, Charltons Alan Curbishley and Middlesbroughs Steve McClaren, one of Englands coaches under Eriksson, will also all be in the running. 

Meanwhile, Eriksson has said his premature departure from his job as Englands head coach may not cost the FA one single penny despite reports he is in line for a lucrative pay off. 

The 57-year-old Swede also countered criticism he has been overpaid since being installed as Englands first foreign head coach in 2000. 

Reports in English newspapers estimated he could leave with a compensation package of up to ? 5 million ($8.91 million).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Daughters tips paid off: Billy 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Billy Mehra, mother of renowned lady golfer Smriti, won the 25th Taj Trophy that concluded at the Tollygunge Club on Thursday. The first runner-up was Rukmani Mehta, and she was followed by Saroj Khan and Vandana Agarwal in the next two positions on the podium. 

In an interesting anecdote to the competitions history, Billy was one of the persons instrumental behind starting the meet here 25 years ago. Its a nice experience to win it in its silver jubilee year, she said. 

But what was her winning formula, after all? I took regular lessons from my daughter before the meet got underway and that had ultimately paid dividends, Billy signed off.

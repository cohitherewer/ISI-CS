Moscow: Marat Safin beat Andy Roddick and Mikhail Youzhny downed James Blake to give Russia a 2-0 lead on Friday over the United States in their Davis Cup semi-final. 

Safin defeated Roddick 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) in the opening match, with Youzhny beat Blake 7-5, 1-6, 6-1, 7-5 in the second. 

In the other semi-final, in Buenos Aires, David Nalbandian beat Mark Philippoussis 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 to give Argentina a 1-0 lead over Australia. 

Nalbandian won a generally poor match decided by unforced errors in two hours and three minutes in the opening rubber of the tie watched by a 14,000 crowd including Diego Maradona, garbed in dark glasses and an Argentina soccer shirt. 

Roddick opened strongly, allowing Safin only one point on the Americans first three service games. But in the seventh game, Safin earned two break points with a backhand passing shot, and converted on the first. The Russian saved a break point in the next before holding to close out the set. 

Roddick tried to change tactics in the second set and play serve-and-volley, but it didnt make a difference. He saved three break points in the third game of the second set and one more in the fifth before Safin ended the matchs longest rally 26 shots with a lob to break serve. 

Safin and Roddick exchanged breaks late in the third set to force a tie-breaker. Down 2-5, Safin won five straight points to end the match. 

Blake broke Youzhny in the second game, but the Russian capitalised on the Americans two double faults in the seventh game to broke back and got another to take the first set. 

In the second, Blake levelled the match with a strong serve-and-volley game, but faded in the third, winning only one point in the last four games. 

The fourth set opened with an exchange of breaks, then stayed on serve until Youzhny broke Blake in the 11th game with a volley winner. 

Philippoussis looked edgy from the outset and was quickly in trouble when he double-faulted on break point in the seventh game of the first set. Nalbandian swept through the second set, breaking in the third and ninth. 

The match briefly came to life when Philippoussis broke serve in the fourth game of the third set. Nalbandian broke back immediately after beating him with a neat drop shot at the net. 

The Argentine then laughed mockingly when Philippoussis over-hit an easy drive to hand him match point that he converted on his first attempt.

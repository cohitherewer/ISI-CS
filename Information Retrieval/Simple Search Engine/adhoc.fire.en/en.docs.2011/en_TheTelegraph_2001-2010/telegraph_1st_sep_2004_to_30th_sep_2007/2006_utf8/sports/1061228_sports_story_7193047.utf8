Calcutta: Almost five months after Jagmohan Dalmiya won an acrimonious battle against police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee at the annual general meeting, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) may witness another round of elections. 

Dalmiya resigned as the CAB president on Wednesday, hours before the emergent working committee met to discuss his expulsion by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The meeting at the Dr B.C. Roy Club House, where 26 of the 32 members were present, lasted barely ten minutes after the members were informed of the BCCI decision and the subsequent resignation. 

Another working committee meeting has been convened on January 5 to discuss Dalmiyas resignation as well as the venue, date and time of the special general body meeting. 

As per the rules, the vacancy has to be filled up within 60 days. As of now, the four vice-presidents will share the presidents duties. 

In a letter addressed to the members of the working committee, Dalmiya said he had decided to resign because of pre-determined and vindictive move(s) of the present BCCI regime. 

Dalmiya served the CAB in various capacities treasurer from 1977-81, joint secretary from 1981-85, vice-president from 1985-89 and president from 1989. 

In his letter, Dalmiya also said he would continue to fight against injustice on his own. I am sure my stand would be fully vindicated through the process of law in which I have full confidence. I am also confident that I will fully regain the opportunity to continue to serve the game of cricket with full honour. 

I have nursed CAB and Bengal cricket for the last 30 years with dedication, devotion and determination. I am confident that the CAB, which has grown in stature over the years through a lot of blood, sweat, toil and tears, will not bow down to any uncalled for and unjustified pressure as well as vindictive action of the present BCCI regime. 

Dalmiya has proposed former president Biswanath Dutts name for the hot seat in these difficult times. Dutt, who has also been requested to take charge by former CAB president and state chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray and Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee among others, has expressed willingness to come out of his self-imposed sabbatical. 

Dutt was non-committal when asked if he would prefer to be a consensus candidate for president. If there is a contest we will see I cannot dwell on the ifs and buts now, he told The Telegraph. 

While joint secretary Saradindu Pal said that Dalmiyas resignation has been accepted, some members felt it was not the case since the resignation letter wasnt placed before the working committee on Wednesday. It can be called as accepted only once that is done during the January 5 meeting. 

The CAB will also seek legal opinion from Ray on the contentious Rule 38 (V) of the BCCI constitution.

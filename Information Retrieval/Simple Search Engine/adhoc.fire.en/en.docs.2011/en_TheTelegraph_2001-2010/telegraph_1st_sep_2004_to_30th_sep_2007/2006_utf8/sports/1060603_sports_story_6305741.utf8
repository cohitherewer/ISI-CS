 Indias battle to protect No. 3 slot

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rahul Dravids men went into the four-Test series against the West Indies knowing fully well that they need to put up a much improved performance than in the disastrous ODI series if they are to avoid a slip in the ICC rankings list. 

According to an ICC media release, the Indians are currently third in the Test Championship list, two points behind England and trailing runaway leaders Australia by 20 points. 

An Indian series loss to Brian Laras resurgent team will help Pakistan displace India as the No. 3 team. Even a 0-1 or 1-2 series defeat will relegate India to the No. 4 spot. 

India can boost their ratings only if they can sweep the four-match series, as the West Indies are placed at No. 8 39 points behind India.

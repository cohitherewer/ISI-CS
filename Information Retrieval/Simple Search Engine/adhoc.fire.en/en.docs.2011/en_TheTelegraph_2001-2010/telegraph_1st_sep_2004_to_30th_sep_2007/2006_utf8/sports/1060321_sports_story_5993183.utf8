 Munaf set to make ODI squad

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai: Quick Munaf Patel, who has been very impressive from the time he made his Test debut (Mohali), is tipped to make the one-day squad for the first two/three ODIs against England. The series will feature seven matches. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, the uncapped Munaf is going to take Ajit Agarkars place. 

Harbhajan Singh will be back in the squad ? he had to miss all five ODIs in Pakistan owing to an injury. Ramesh Powar, therefore, is going to be dropped. 

Apparently, theres some talk of selecting another uncapped bowler ? the teenaged Piyush Chawla. If the leggie gets in, then Murali Kartik wont find a place. 

The first ODI is to be played in New Delhi, on March 28.

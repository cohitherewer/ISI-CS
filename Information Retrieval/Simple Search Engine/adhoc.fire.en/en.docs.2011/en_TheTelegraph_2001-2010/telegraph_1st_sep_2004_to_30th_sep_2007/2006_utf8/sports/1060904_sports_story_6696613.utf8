Norton (Massachusetts): Australian Robert Allenby drained a hole-in-one en route to a share of the lead at the halfway point of the Deutsche Bank Championship on Saturday. 

Allenby shot a five-under-par 66 to tie Britains Justin Rose on six-under at the top of the leaderboard after the second round, two strokes ahead of Tiger Woods, defending champion Olin Browne and Australias Aaron Baddeley. 

Indias Arjun Atwal missed yet another cut with a second round of three-over 74. Atwals friend Daniel Chopra, a Swede of Indian origin, also missed the cut with a second successive four-over 75. 

Atwal had six bogeys and three birdies. Atwal was seven-over after two rounds, while the cut was applied at three-over. 

Atwal had bogeys on second, fifth, eighth, ninth, 13th and 17th, and his three birdies were on third, tenth and 11th. Atwal, with just over $438,000 in 27 starts, is lying 134th and needs to finish inside the top-125 to get a full card. 

A final position between 126th and 150th will get him limited starts as it happened in 2004. 

Allenby holed out on the 211-yard par-three 16th, but said that was not the luckiest shot of the round. 

That came on the par-four 464-yard sixth, where his second hit a rock in a water hazard but bounced out, allowing him to save par. 

If it goes in the water, Im looking at double (bogey), Allenby said. 

Rose, who shot a 69, said his short game helped him combat the windy conditions. 

It was a battle and grinding sort of day, he said. 

The course is playing very, very difficult. There was a lot of cross winds, so it was difficult to get the ball close to the flag. 

Woods, who shot a one-over-par 72, struggled from the tee throughout the day, missing seven fairways and at times needing to head into the gallery to rescue his ball. 

After sending his drive on the 443-yard 13th into the left rough, he pounded his driver on a cart path in frustration, sending up a shower of sparks. 

On the fourth hole, while rescuing his ball from a lie close to a tree, he accidentally whacked his club into the trunk.

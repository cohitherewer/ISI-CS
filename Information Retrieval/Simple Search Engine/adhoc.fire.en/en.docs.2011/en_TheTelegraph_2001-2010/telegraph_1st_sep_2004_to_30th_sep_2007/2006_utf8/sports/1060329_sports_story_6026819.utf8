The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Inter under pressure vs Villarreal

 Champion League

 Milan: Inter Milan are 

 under familiar pressure ahead of Wednesdays Champions 

 League quarter final, first-leg match against Spains 

 Villarreal.

 Elsewhere, Olympique Lyon ? in 

 a class of their own domestically for years ? feel it is 

 time to make an impact in Europe and have an opportunity 

 to do so against AC Milan.

 Saturdays defeat to Parma 

 left Inter in third place, trailing Serie A leaders Juventus 

 by 13 points, and Roberto Mancinis side is now five 

 points adrift of second-placed Milan.

 Mancini knows that failure in 

 Europe would leave him with little to show for his efforts 

 at the San Siro this season and intensify speculation about 

 his future.

 The poor form of Brazilian Adriano 

 has been a major factor in Inters lack of sharpness 

 in front of goal and Mancini may be tempted to look at an 

 alternative in the form of Argentine Julio Ricardo Cruz 

 while Nigerian Obafemi Martins will compete with Uruguayan 

 forward Alvaro Recoba for a place in the starting line-up.

 Whoever Mancini opts to play in 

 attack will almost certainly be without the creative support 

 of Portuguese winger Luis Figo whose muscle strain looks 

 likely to rule him out. Without Figo, captain Javier Zanetti 

 will probably push forward into midfield.

 Villarreals Argentine playmaker 

 Juan Roman Riquelme said his side would have to show a marked 

 improvement from the weekend, if they were to have any chance 

 against Inter.

 Lyon will be entertaining Milan 

 in the knowledge that they have never made the semis of 

 European club soccers showcase event.

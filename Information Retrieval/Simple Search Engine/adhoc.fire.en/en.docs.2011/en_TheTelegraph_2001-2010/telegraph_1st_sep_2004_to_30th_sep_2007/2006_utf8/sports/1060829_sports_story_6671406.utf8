 Makelele being treated like a slave

London: Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said that Claude Makelele is being treated like a slave by France coach Raymond Domenech, who wants him to play for the French national team even though Makelele wants to retire. 

Makelele, 33, came out of an initial international retirement to play for France in the World Cup qualifiers and the finals in June and July. 

He won his 50th cap in the final defeat by Italy and then said he wanted to call time on his international career. 

However, Domenech has selected him for Frances upcoming Euro 2008 qualifiers against Georgia and Italy and under Fifa rules, if he refuses to play in those games, he can be suspended from playing for Chelsea. 

Makelele said he had little choice than to accept his call-up for the Euro qualifiers against Georgia on September 2 and Italy four days later. 

My name is on the squad and I have to go there, Makelele was quoted as saying by a French daily on Monday. Playing for France means a lot to me. 

Mourinho told a TV channel after his teams 2-0 win over Blackburn on Sunday: Makelele is not a football player Makelele is a slave. 

Hes played in the biggest game you can, the World Cup final, and now he wants to retire but the coach told us if he does not play for France, he wont be playing for Chelsea. 

We know the rules. You are a slave, you have no human rights. 

Mourinho says he has no choice but to send Makelele to join up with his national squad. 

We have no choice. The rules are there, the law is there. It is easy to understand, there is no doubtful law. If you dont play one match (for France) you are suspended for two (for Chelsea). If he misses two games for France he misses four for Chelsea. 

Domenech said he had spoken to Mourinho on the issue. I had a discussion with Mourinho as I often do with the coaches of our international players but it was not a matter of reaching an agreement over Makelele, he said.

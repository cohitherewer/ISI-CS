The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Longer workout for Indians

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Jaipur: Instead of a three-hour nets session Friday, Team India figured in a practice match at the beautifully laid-out Neerja Modi School, some distance from the heart of the city. 

And, so, the Rahul Dravids were kept occupied till around 5.30 pm, instead of packing up some 90 minutes earlier. Our first match in the Champions Trophy is against England Sunday. 

The day, by the way, was special for the Agarkars Ajit and Fatima as it marked son Rajs first birthday. Owing to the circumstances, only a quiet celebration was possible. 

He cut a cake in the room, thats it, Ajit told The Telegraph as Raj kept fiddling with one of the switches in the team hotels lounge.

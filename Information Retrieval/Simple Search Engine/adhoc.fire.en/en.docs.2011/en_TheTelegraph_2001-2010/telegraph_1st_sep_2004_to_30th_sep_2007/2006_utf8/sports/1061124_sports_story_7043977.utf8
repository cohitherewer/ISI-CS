The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Indians will 

 miss Sourav, Laxman

 Bodyline 

 Allan Donald

The way South Africa went off 

 the block, especially with the ball in the second game, 

 was tremendous. If thats the standard they are going 

 to set, then its going to be the trend in the Tests 

 as well. It makes me think that India are a batter or two 

 short on this trip. Its been unbelievable to me that 

 Laxman has been left out for he is a magnificent player.

 Sourav Ganguly is another who 

 must be sitting at home and thinking what he has done wrong. 

 We havent seen much of Sourav in the last six-eight 

 months but he is a class player and has been one for some 

 time. As the series goes on, I suspect the Indians are going 

 to miss more the Laxmans and Souravs they have left back 

 home.

 For youngsters in the line-up 

 like Suresh Raina, its baptism by fire. As an 18-year-old 

 you might have world of talent but you got to have enough 

 first class experience. Its not right to evoke comparison 

 with Sachin Tendulkar for then you are stepping into the 

 genius territory. He was an exception, not everybody could 

 be like him.

 South Africa would be thinking 

 if this is what is to come, then we are up for it.

 Indians, in a way, were caught 

 on the hop batting under the lights. Teams in the past have 

 struggled batting second in Kingsmead. It is not easy to 

 chase scores down at this venue. Even though the pitch has 

 lost its zip, theres a bit of bounce and carry.

 South Africans made good use of 

 the conditions and Shaun Pollock was brilliant as ever. 

 Makhaya Ntini was a foot-and-half too short and to be fair 

 there was a time when the Indian batsmen looked quite comfortable 

 and unthreatened by pace and bounce.

 However once Charles Langeveldt 

 and Andre Nel were pressed into attack, they quickly changed 

 lengths and the game really swung away from India after 

 they lost Sachin and Dravid in three ball. It knocked the 

 stuffing out of India.

 I must say that Irfan Pathans 

 omission took me by surprise for he could have added extra 

 dimension with the bat. But you could see where Indians 

 are coming from. They wanted to cut down on bowling and 

 bolster batting. But given the kind of talent Indians have, 

 they should have done a little better.

 Its also not all meat and 

 drink for South Africa and the time has come for the selectors 

 to take a call on Herschelle Gibbs. The hosts are not getting 

 too many starts and the pressure that is being added is 

 crucial. Its nice to see South African selectors back 

 a great player but there comes a time when you have to take 

 a decision.

 I know its not going to 

 happen. A South African team without Gibbs is unheard of. 

 But the selectors are now going to draw a line, convey to 

 him that he has been given a good go and it has not come 

 off. May be its time to look somewhere else.

 I dont think Gibbs is batting 

 too low in the order. He is alright where he is now. When 

 he played against Australia earlier this year, he was in 

 form. Now he is not and has not been for the last 2-3 months. 

 He must be feeling the pressure right now. (PTI)

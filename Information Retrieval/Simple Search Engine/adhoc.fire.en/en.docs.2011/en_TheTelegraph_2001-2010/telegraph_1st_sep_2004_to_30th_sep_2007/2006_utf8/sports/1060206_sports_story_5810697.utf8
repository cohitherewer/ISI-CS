Calcutta: Injury-plagued East Bengal will have a tough time when they take on Mahindra United in the 10th National Football League match for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake stadium on Monday. 

Mahindra United with 13 points from five matches top the table and are followed by East Bengal, who have 12 points from six matches. 

It is going to be a Mission Impossible for us, feels East Bengals Belgian coach Phillipe De Ridder. 

We have a lot of injuries? plus, there are a couple of players who have just come back from injury. 

Star striker Bhaichung Bhutia is down with a nasty wound in his right thigh, which he suffered during the last match against JCT on Thursday. The red and gold brigade would also be missing Mike Okoro. The Nigerian left for Poland ???? owning to his citizenship problem ??? on January 29. 

Bhaichungs injury is a big setback for the team, feels Alvito DCunha. The team will obviously miss his experience. He suffered the injury early in the match, still the way he played for the full 90 minutes was exemplary. This is why he is Bhaichung Bhutia, DCunha maintained. 

In fact, De Ridder is keeping his fingers crossed and said that the decision of fielding Bhaichung would be taken just before the match. But given the degree of the bruise that he suffered, it is very unlikely that the India captain would be able to take the field. 

With two of the leading strikers out, De Ridder is virtually short of options. Mahindra will be the most favoured team tomorrow, he said after the teams practice session at the clubs premises on Sunday. 

In the absence of the duo, D Cunha and K. Kulothungan may perform upfront duties while Syed Rahim Nabi will be playing his usual role as a withdrawal forward. There is bad news as far as the midfield is concerned as well. Guy Ndem who was impressive in the past few matches will have to sit out due to double booking. 

Meanwhile, Mahindra coach Derek Pereira felt that it would be tough battle against the Calcutta giant. You cant take any chance against such a formidable side. They have good players who have performed well in the season, said the coach of the Mumbai outfit. 

Defence seems to be a problem for Pereira as his team has conceded six goals in five matches. As you play attacking football, so you will concede some goals. But we have scored at a good rate as well, said Pereira. 

Mahindra will miss the services of Shanmugham Venkatesh and goalie Sandip Nandy due to injury. 

But when an upfront is taken care of by the likes of Jose Ramirez Barreto and Yusif Yakubu, Mahindra will sure start the match on an advantageous platform.

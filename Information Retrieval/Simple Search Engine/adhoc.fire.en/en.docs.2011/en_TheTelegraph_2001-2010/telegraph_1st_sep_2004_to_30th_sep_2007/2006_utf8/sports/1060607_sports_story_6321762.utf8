 Quick Takes

 US express concern over trafficking

 Washington: The United 

 States is concerned thousands of women may be forced to 

 travel to Germany and work as prostitutes during the World 

 Cup, a senior US official said.

 The US has written to the government 

 and raised its fears in meetings with officials in Germany, 

 where prostitution is legal, said John Miller, the state 

 department official responsible for the publication on Monday 

 of an annual report on human trafficking world-wide.

 There are reports of thousands 

 of women being transported to Germany for sex during the 

 World Cup, he told reporters. All the research 

 and evidence available shows that when you have large flows 

 of women for sexual purposes, there is going to be trafficking. 

 There is a link between prostitution and sex trafficking.

 officer Daniel Nivel, who was beaten by German hooligans

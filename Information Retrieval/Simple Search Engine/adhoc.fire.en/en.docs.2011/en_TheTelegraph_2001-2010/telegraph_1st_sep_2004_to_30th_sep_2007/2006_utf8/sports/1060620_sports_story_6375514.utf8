The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

Lack of commitment showing in French display

Talking Tactics 

PK Banerjee

I had mixed feelings after watching France being held 

1-1 by South Korea on Sunday night. On the one hand I was happy to see our Asian 

flag-bearers brightening chances of qualifying for the last-16, but very pained 

to watch the European heavyweights dish out an uninspiring fare, thus jeopardising 

their progress into the next round.

Let me start with France. Its difficult to fathom 

why the footballing fortunes of a nation, which had the rare distinction of winning 

the World Cup and European Championship back to back not so long ago, has taken 

such a nosedive.

Yes, the French had the better of exchanges against 

the Koreans, as is reflected in superior possession, shots on goal and corner 

kicks. Yet they looked anything but a team capable of winning the coveted trophy.

Football is a team game, but you wouldnt have 

believed that watching this French outfit operate on the battlefield. There was 

no camaraderie or spark that is omnipresent in a team which believes in itself. 

It looked as if the players didnt know each other and were just going through 

the motions.

More significantly, I noticed a lack of commitment 

and motivation in the team.

The Koreans, on the contrary, had dollops of those 

attributes. The French were too flat and hardly made that extra effort which often 

separates the winner from the loser.

Take the Korean equaliser, for instance. It was a 

careless piece of defending. A cross was floated towards the far post and headed 

back into the goalmouth. Park Ji-sung popped up to slice the ball goalwards. There 

was a defender on the goalline who, instead of volleying the ball away, tried 

to control it. Even Barthez looked confused and mistimed his jump.

That goal woke up the French to an extent and the 

last 10 minutes saw them stretch the Korean defence at least thrice. Henry, put 

through by Zidane and in a one-to-one situation with the custodian, failed to 

beat him.

He could have gone past the helpless keeper 

and walked into the goal with the ball. The Arsenal superstar may have broken 

Frances goal-drought in the finals with an early strike on Sunday, but when 

crunch time came, he failed to deliver for the umpteenth time.

Despite the lacklustre performance, France should 

still have won. They had a valid goal disallowed. 

Vieiras header was retrieved from at least six 

inches inside the goal by the Korean custodian, but neither the referee nor his 

assistants spotted it.

That would have given France a two-goal cushion before 

half-time and made it next to impossible even for a team like Korea, who never 

give up, to claw back into the game.

Zidane had a light-and-shade performance, very much 

like Ronaldo. The ageing midfielder still has the sharpness in passing and made 

less mistakes than the others, but he is no longer the midfield general that he 

was four-five years ago.

In short, Zidane can still produce moments of magic, 

but he has lost the power to carry the team on his shoulders.

France will go into their must-win match against Togo 

without the talismanic Zidane. Not the ideal situation for the coach, but I would 

say theres nothing to despair. If Domenech can motivate the team and inspire 

the players to give off their best, France should put it across Togo.

Who knows, Zidanes replacement may provide the 

team the spark that has been missing in Germany! 

The Koreans will face the Swiss in their last game 

and a point may suffice in giving them a second-round berth. The way the 2002 

semi-finalists have been fighting every inch of the way, everything is possible 

for our Asian red devils. More so when Lady Luck has been smiling 

on them, just like she did four years ago.

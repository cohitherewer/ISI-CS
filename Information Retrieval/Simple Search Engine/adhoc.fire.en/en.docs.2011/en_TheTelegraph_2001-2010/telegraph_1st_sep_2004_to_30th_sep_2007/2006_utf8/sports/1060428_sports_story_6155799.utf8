The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sp. lose 0-2 to JCT

 National League

 Ludhiana: JCT Mills overwhelmed 

 Mohammedan Sporting 2-0 in the National Football League 

 match here on Thursday.

 JCT not only avenged their defeat 

 which they suffered against the Calcutta outfit earlier 

 in the league, but also garnered three points to surge ahead 

 of their rivals after the 14th round encounter.

 The win took JCTs tally 

 to 17 points, while the visitors remained at 14 points. 

 JCT players dominated throughout, 

 making repeated forays into the rivals territory.

 However the much needed goal came 

 in the second session. In the 48th minute, Daljit Singhs 

 throw-in was well taken by P. Rennedy Singh who despatched 

 the ball into the net, much to the chagrin of Mohammedan 

 Sporting goal keeper Arindam Ghosh.

 JCTs forwards managed to 

 pierce through the Sporting defence in the 64th minute.

 Sunil Chhetri gave a parallel 

 pass to Parveen Kumar, who scored a fine goal to read it 

 2-0.

 Mohammedan Sporting players pressed 

 hard to reduce the margin but failed to cut the ice. Their 

 star strikers Gley Yao Rodrigue and Mohammed Mukhtar were 

 well tackled by JCT .

 Meanwhile in Panaji, Mahindra 

 United hope to take a step towards their NFL title on Friday 

 when they take on Sporting Clube de Goa at the Nehru Stadium 

 in Margao.

 Currently placed second with 26 

 points from 12 matches, two points behind East Bengal, a 

 win on Friday will put Mahindra on the top of the points 

 table. (PTI)

 Rooney upbeat

London: Wayne Rooney hopes intensive treatment on his broken foot will allow him to play some part in the World Cup. 

Ill be coming in (for treatment) every day and trying to give myself the best possible chance, Rooney told MuTV on Tuesday. 

Im obviously devastated to have broken my foot at this moment in time, it really is horrible. But Im in great hands at United and I know with the physio team Ive got behind me here that theyll be able to give me the best possible chance. 

Youve just got to get on with it and be positive. Thats what Im trying to do at the moment and Ill be trying to get myself fit as soon as possible. 

Id like to thank everyone whos sent me messages and supported me, he said. But its now important that I have some privacy and the press leave me alone as I try to get myself fit. (Reuters)

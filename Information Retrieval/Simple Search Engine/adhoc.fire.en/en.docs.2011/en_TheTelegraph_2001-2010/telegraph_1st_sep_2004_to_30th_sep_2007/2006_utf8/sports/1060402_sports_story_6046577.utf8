 Lanka want a win for Sanath

Kandy: The Sri Lankan team is hoping to give former skipper Sanath Jayasuriya a grand farewell by winning the second and final Test against Pakistan starting here on Monday. 

Left-handed Jayasuriya, 36, Sri Lankas highest run-scorer in both Test cricket and one-day Internationals, announced his retirement from Tests on Friday. 

We havent beaten Pakistan for 20 years at home. It is going to be the last Test for Sanath, and he deserves a grand send-off for what he has been for cricket, said assistant coach Trevor Penny. (AFP)

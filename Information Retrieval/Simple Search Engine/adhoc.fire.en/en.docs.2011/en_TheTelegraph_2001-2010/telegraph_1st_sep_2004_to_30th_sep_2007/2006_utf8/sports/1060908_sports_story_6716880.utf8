 RCTC on wild goose chase 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: RCTC stewards 

 have been working overtime to get cellphones legalised by 

 the state government. If the stewards would only spend half 

 their energies to get the two off-course centres approved, 

 they would be doing a great service to the club and punters. 

 They have got their priorities wrong and they are on a wild 

 goose chase.

 The Russell Street off-course generates sales of nearly Rs 1 crore per annum, and a chunk of the profit goes to the RCTC and government. Two more such off-course shops are bound to improve the clubs finances, while cellphones may hardly earn them Rs 25 lakh per annum.

 More importantly, the office of the Agricultural Income Tax Commissioner (AITC) may clear the time tested revenue-earning proposal of additional off-course centres already waiting for AITC clearance rather than support a losing cause that could favour only a couple of owners and some bookmakers. 

 The AITC has not been approached by RCTC yet about the cellphones. We are yet to hear about it from RCTC. So lets not talk about it, said S.N. Mookhopadhya, an Agricultural income tax officer, when The Telegraph asked for his reaction. 

 The department is, however, aware of illegal bookmakers menace in the RCTC betting ring.

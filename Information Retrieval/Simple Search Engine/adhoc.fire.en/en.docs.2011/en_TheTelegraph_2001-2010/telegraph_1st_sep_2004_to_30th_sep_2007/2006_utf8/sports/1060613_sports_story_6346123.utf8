 WI shortlist 8 for contracts

Gros Islet: Eight West Indies players have been shortlisted for retainer contracts which would be given to them once the four-Test series against India concludes early next month, media reports said here on Monday. 

The West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) cited its current financial status as the reason for handing out contracts to only eight players. 

At the last meeting between the financial arm of the West Indies Cricket Board and the West Indies Players Association (WIPA), figures were provided by the board showing that due to its current financial status, it would be able to give contracts to only eight players, a Trinidad newspaper reported.

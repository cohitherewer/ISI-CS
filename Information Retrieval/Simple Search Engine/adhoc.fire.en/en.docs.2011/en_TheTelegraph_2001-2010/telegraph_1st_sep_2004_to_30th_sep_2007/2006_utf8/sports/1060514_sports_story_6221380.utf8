 Almost a back door arrival for India in West Indies

 - Security breach before departure from Gatwick and...

Kingston: Even if the nine-hour British Airways flight (No. 2263) from Gatwick to the Jamaican capital was uneventful, on Friday, there was drama both before the departure and on arrival here. 

First the Gatwick incident. 

In what is rare, the new generation 777 aircraft was taken back to the parking bay a good couple of minutes after the push-back exercise had begun owing to discrepancy in paper work. 

An Indian freelancer, as it turned out, was at the centre of it all. Hed got his suitcase checked-in through a colleague and couldnt reach the departure gate before the aircrafts doors closed. That, one learns, was because of a miscommunication over the gate number. 

While looking at alternatives for the quickest connection to Kingston, he revealed his suitcase was already on the aircraft, courtesy the colleague. That made the British Airways staff panic. After all, unaccompanied baggage cannot be loaded. 

When the in-flight chief came checking, the freelancers colleague insisted the situation had been explained at the check-in counter and that the staff there allowed this breach of security. Whatever, once the 777 returned to the parking bay, in walked the freelancer. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, that was a quicker solution than unloading hundreds of pieces of checked-in baggage and throwing out that unaccompanied one. The flight still got delayed by around 50 minutes. 

British Airways may investigate how the staffer in question allowed unaccompanied baggage to be checked-in. 

Now, to the drama on arrival. 

If a security breach marked the departure, the ground staffs incompetence at the airport here almost forced Team India to make a back door arrival! For about ten minutes, the handlers on the ground couldnt place the ladder at the front door. 

An announcement was even made that the passengers could exit through the rear. Thankfully, the ground staff got it right just as the Rahul Dravids began preparing for a back door-disembarkation. 

The handlers on the ground were from Air Jamaica, which manages British Airways operations in Kingston, but the premier airline has much to be embarrassed about. 

Footnote: Quick Sreesanth, who visited Tirupati a couple of days ago (keeping a commitment made by his mother in 2003) and got his head shaved, misplaced his boarding pass out of Gatwick while changing airports in London. It took time for another to be issued.

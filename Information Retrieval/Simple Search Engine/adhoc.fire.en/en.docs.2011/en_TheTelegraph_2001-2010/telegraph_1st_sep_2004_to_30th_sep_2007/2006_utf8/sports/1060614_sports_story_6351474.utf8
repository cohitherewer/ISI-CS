 Quick Takes

 German fan stabbed for painting flag 

 on cheeks

 Hamburg: A German World 

 Cup fan was attacked by four men and stabbed in a town near 

 Hamburg, apparently because he had painted his countrys 

 flag on his cheeks, police said Tuesday.

 The 20-year-old was leaving a 

 disco on Friday night when he was set upon by the four men, 

 also around 20, a police spokesman said. The victim 

 stated that he was taunted because of his short haircut 

 and German flags on his cheeks, Gramsch said, adding 

 he was not a skinhead. Two of the attackers 

 then pulled knives and stabbed the victim in the hands, 

 which he had raised in his defence, Gramsch said.

 Two Nazi fans 

 detained

 Nuremberg: Two England 

 fans who were arrested for allegedly wearing Nazi insignia 

 to Saturdays opening Group B game against Paraguay 

 have been arrested on returning to Britain, a police spokeswoman 

 said on Tuesday. The two supporters, aged 21 and 24, were 

 detained when they landed at Leeds airport on Monday evening, 

 a spokeswoman for the Association of Chief Police Officers 

 said in Germany. They will appear at Leeds Magistrates Court 

 later on Tuesday and be subject to an application for a 

 banning order.

 Bogus officer menace

 Frankfurt: Frankfurt police 

 have urged soccer fans in the city to be wary of bogus police 

 officers attempting to steal cash and passports. Police 

 handed out leaflets to fans outside the Waldstadion before 

 South Koreas clash with Togo on Tuesday urging fans 

 to be vigilant. Over the past few weeks, the Frankfurt 

 police have seen an increase in the number of cases reported 

 of thieves posing as plain clothes police officers, 

 police stated in the leaflet, which was printed in eight 

 different languages. 

 Amphibian trouble

 Leipzig: Ukraine players 

 complained on Tuesday that frogs were disturbing their sleep 

 at the lakeside hotel in Potsdam. Central defender Vladislav 

 Vashchyuk told a newspaper that frogs in the Templiner See 

 lake were keeping the players awake at night ahead of their 

 Group H opener against Spain on Wednesday. We have 

 agreed we will take fishing rods to hunt these frogs, 

 said Vashchyuk.

 Hislop will start: Coach

 Rotenburg: Shaka Hislop 

 will play in goal for Trinidad amp; Tobago against England 

 in their Group B match on Thursday, coach Leo Beenhakker 

 said on Tuesday. Shaka will definitely start against 

 England and is in great form, Beenhakker said. Hislop 

 took a knock during training, but Beenhakker said it was 

 nothing to worry about. Jack is still injured and is not 

 available for the England game.

 Fifa thumbs up to music

 Berlin: Fifa and the local 

 organising committee are allowing fans to bring musical 

 instruments into the stadiums and their music is contributing 

 to some superb entertainment in the build-up to kickoff. 

 Asked whether Fifa were aware the video show was dampening 

 fans enjoyment, Wolfgang Niersbach, vice-president 

 of the local German organising committee, agreed that it 

 was.

 Good ambassadors

 Barsinghausen: Polish fans 

 good behaviour so far at the World Cup has boosted the countrys 

 chances of hosting the 2012 European Championships, FA chief 

 Michal Listkiewicz said on Tuesday. Around 35,000 Poles 

 packed into Gelsenkirchens Arena AufSchalke stadium 

 for the Group A game against Ecuador on Friday, with thousands 

 more camped outside to savour the match day atmosphere.

 President extends stay

 Rotenburg: The president 

 of Trinidad amp; Tobago is so confident the Caribbean team 

 can pull off another World Cup shock against England on 

 Thursday he has extended his stay in Germany. Maxwell Richards 

 has cancelled his return date of June 21, a spokesman said.

 He told the players he always 

 believed in them, but after the Sweden game, he really thinks 

 they can get a result against England, the spokesman 

 added.

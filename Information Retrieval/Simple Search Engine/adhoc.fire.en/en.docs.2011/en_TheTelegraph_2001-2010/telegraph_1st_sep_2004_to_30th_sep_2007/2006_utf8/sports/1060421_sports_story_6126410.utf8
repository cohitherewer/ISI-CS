 Gillespie, Hayden plan nude shock

Melbourne: The gentlemans game could be in for a rude shock if Australian cricketers Jason Gillespie and Matthew Haydens claims are to be trusted. 

The pair had made bold claims of a nude run if the tailender scored a double century in the second Test against Bangladesh, and Gillespie managed the feat by scoring 201 on Wednesday. 

Matty Hayden reckons if I got to 200 he would do a nude lap of The Oval. I dont know if he will actually do it ? may be at the end of the game, Gillespie said on Thursday. 

The problem is, I was getting a massage last night by Lucy, our (team) masseuse, and she mentioned 200. I said, I am 102, there is no way Id get it. I mentioned I would do a nude lap too, if I got there. 

However, the fact that the series was being played in a conservative Muslim country might have discouraged the duo from doing the bold act. 

I dont know about that one, being in a Muslim country. I dont know if it would have been perceived right. 

Mike Hussey, who himself belted 182, said Haydens comments had handed the pair motivation to press on Friday as they put 320 for the fourth wicket. 

I did not want to be outdone by Dizz and Matty Hayden, had a bit of a bet with Dizz which was a bit of motivation to keep on going there, Hussey said.

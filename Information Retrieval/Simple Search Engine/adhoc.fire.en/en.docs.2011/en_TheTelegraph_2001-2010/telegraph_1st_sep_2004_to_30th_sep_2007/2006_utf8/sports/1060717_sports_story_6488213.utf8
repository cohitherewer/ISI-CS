 Senden leads, Atwal tied 57th

 John Senden in action in Sylvis 

Sylvis (Illinois): Daniel Chopras excellent ball-striking was rendered somewhat ineffective by a below-par putting which left him four off leader John Senden on the third day of the John Deere Classic meet here. 

Atwal, with two birdies on the 11th and 15th and a bogey on third after starting from tenth, carded a one-under 70 and was tied 57th with a total of five-under 208. 

Senden shot a seven-under 64 and was 16-under after three rounds. 

A day after she withdrew because of heat exhaustion, the spotlight was still on Michelle Wie. The 16-year-old, who shot a six-over 77 on the first day, was eight-over on Friday when the heat got to her and she withdrew after nine holes. 

She was treated at the course and taken to a hospital, but was released later. 

Chopra started with birdies on the second and fourth, but then came a bogey on eighth. Two birdies on the back-nine ensured he stayed in touch, but his putts just did not fall. From 22 putts on the first day, he came down to 27 on the second and a disappointing 32 on third. 

Chopra birdied the second, fourth, 15th and 17th and dropped one on eighth. 

Behind leader Senden were Heath Slocum and Patrick Sheehan, three behind at 13-under after rounds of 66 each. Joe Ogilvie (69), Alex Cejka (64), Steve Jones (66), J.P. Hayes (66) and Chopra (68) were 12-under.

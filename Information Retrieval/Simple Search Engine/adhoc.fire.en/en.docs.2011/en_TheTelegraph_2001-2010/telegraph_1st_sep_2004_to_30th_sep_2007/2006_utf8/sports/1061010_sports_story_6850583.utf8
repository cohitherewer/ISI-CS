 Inzy: Pak can win without me

 Inzamam 

Lahore: Inzamam-ul Haq Monday said the side was capable of winning the Champions Trophy in India without him under stand-in captain Younis Khan. 

This team is capable of playing the final and if they can reach the final without me they can also win it, Inzamam said after meeting newly-appointed Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf. 

Inzamam, who was appointed captain until Pakistans home series against the West Indies starting next month, also reacted to reports that he might not return as captain and his replacement Younis may continue. 

Captaincy doesnt bother me, its not an issue at the moment. The main thing is that the team has to do well in the Champions Trophy, he said. 

Inzamam was banned for four one-day matches by a disciplinary hearing of the International Cricket Council following The Oval fiasco. 

Inzamam also reacted to the sacking of Mushtaq Ahmed as assistant coach. The situation regarding Mushtaq was not clear, it was tough on him, said Inzamam.

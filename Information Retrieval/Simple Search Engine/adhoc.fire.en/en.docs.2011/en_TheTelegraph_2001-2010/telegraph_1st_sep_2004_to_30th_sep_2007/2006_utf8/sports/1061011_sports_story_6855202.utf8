New Delhi: The countrys top golfers on Tuesday announced the launch of the Professional Golf Tour of India (PGTI), which will kick off with the Bilt Open Championship later this month. 

The inaugural event will be played from October 26 to 29 at the Jaypee Greens Resort, in Noida, followed by five more events which have been finalised so far. 

Tata Open in Jamshedpur will be the second event (November 6-10) in the new calendar but the dates and venues of the other four are yet to be sorted out by the board of PGTI, which will have industrialist and Bilt Group chairman Guatam Thapar as its president. 

The breakaway Tour, eyeing a total prize pool close to Rs 6 crore from 20 events, will also have Jyoti Randhawa as one of its directors. 

Justifying the setting up of the rival Tour, Randhawa said the PGAI Tour, run by Tiger Sports Marketing (TSM), had fallen flat on its commitments. 

TSM committed something but did not do so. If you make promises, you must keep them also. As players, we felt betrayed. The new Tour is of the players, by the players and for the players, Randhawa said at a press conference. 

Another top pro, Gaurav Ghei, dismissed suggestions that the rival Tour will confuse sponsors. 

Sponsors will also realise that the top players are taking time out to play in our Tour. They would not like to put money in an event that does not have big players, he said. 

Ghei also said that the top players had given a written undertaking that they would turn out for at least two events in the calendar given their busy international schedule. 

Ghei also said that those golfers, who were yet to join them on account of some miscommunication, would be welcomed any time. 

Jaypee Greens would be the official golf course, courtesy cricketer-turned-golfer Kapil Dev who negotiated the deal on behalf of the players. 

Veteran player Uttam Singh Mundy said PGTI would also enjoy the backing of the Asian Tour and should get the official sanction from Indian Golf Union. (PTI)

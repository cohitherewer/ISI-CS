 Shock defeat for Surya 

 National chess

 Visakhapatnam: Defending 

 champion and Grandmaster Surya Sekhar Ganguly suffered a 

 shock defeat against International Master in-waiting Himanshu 

 Sharma in the second round of the 43rd National A Chess 

 Championship here on Tuesday.

 On a day belonging to budding 

 talents, IM and Asian Junior Champion Arun Prasad came up 

 with an inspired performance to beat GM Abhijit Kunte.

 As if these two giant-killing 

 acts were not enough, IM Deepan Chakravarthy defeated former 

 National B champion Sriram Jha with surprising ease and 

 emerged as the joint leader on two points along with GM 

 Koneru Humpy and IM M.R. Venkatesh.

 In the 32nd Womens A championship 

 being organised simultaneously, there were no such fireworks 

 as the second round ended on an expected note.

 The big battle between top-seeded 

 International Master S. Vijayalakshmi and local talent D. 

 Harika ended in a draw. Woman Grandmaster Swati Ghate and 

 Kiran Manisha Mohanty became early leaders here, recording 

 smooth second round victories over Amruta Mokal and I. Aiswarya 

 Shobhana, respectively.

 The action in the mens section 

 produced some inspired performances from the younger lot.Surya 

 Sekhar, in fact, had Himanshu in a spot of bother for some 

 time till the Haryanvi got in to his act and came up with 

 some fine defensive resources when the Calcuttan was mauling 

 his king.

 The GM came up with an exchange 

 sacrifice that was digested in due course of time by Sharma 

 and after 102 moves, Surya Sekhar called it a day. However, 

 this was not the longest game of the day as Abhijit Kuntes 

 survival tactics lasted longer against a relentless Arun 

 Prasad who played with black pieces.

 Getting a slight but tangible 

 advantage, Prasad had to wait for 133 moves before beating 

 Kunte.

 In other important games of the 

 day, Venkatesh defeated Vikramaditya Kamble who played black 

 while oldest participant Lanka Ravi was beaten by youngest 

 in the fray Abhijeet Gupta.

 Grandmaster Tejas Bakre withdrew 

 from the event citing illness and his second round opponent 

 M.S. Thej Kumar got a bye as a result.

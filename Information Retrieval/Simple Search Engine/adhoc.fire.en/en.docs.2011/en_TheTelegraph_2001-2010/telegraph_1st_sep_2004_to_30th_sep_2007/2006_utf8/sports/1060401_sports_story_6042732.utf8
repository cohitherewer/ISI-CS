 Im confident we can do it again: Raina

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Despite his innocent look, Suresh Raina knows when to put his foot down. At the end of the second one-day International versus England on Friday, he kept staring at his feet with a sheepish smile while both the captains were heaping praise on him. However, when Rahul Dravid called him a kid, he decided it was time to interrupt. 

Raina has the temperament and is an exciting talent. I am sure he will learn more and be a serious cricketer for the country for the next 10 years, said Dravid, adding: Its good to see the young kid handling such a difficult situation. 

Raina protested. I am a 19-year-old, he said smilingly. Dravid understood, and corrected himself. He is a young man full of talent. 

That Raina can take care of any situation was proved on the pitch of the Nahar Singh Stadium on Friday. Even England captain Andrew Flintoff agreed that Rainas was simply a fantastic innings. He stole the match away from us. 

Raina was not too amused. I have done it before for India against Sri Lanka in Pune where Dhoni and I featured in a similar partnership (in October 2005). Then also we were 90 for five. We had chased successfully at that time and that gave us the confidence, Raina said. 

Raina added that he had no special plans for the innings. Rahul bhai told us to play our natural game. We had decided to keep taking a run every ball and push the match till the 50th over. We knew if we could do that we would win. I am happy we did that, and I am confident we will do that again. 

At the end of the day, Raina was a really big hit in Faridabad. So much so, that immediately after the match was over, a young spectator eluded the tight security net to run into the ground and congratulate him. He even evaded the security cordon put up for the Haryana chief minister, who was the chief guest. 

Though he managed to shake hands with Raina, the fan could not make his way back safely. Around a dozen policemen pounced on him to beat him up severely. The man finally jumped the fencing to get back into the stands. He punched his hands in the air and was loudly clapped by the spectators. 

All for just being able to hold the hands of a certain Suresh Raina.

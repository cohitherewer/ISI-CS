The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 Despite an early exit from the Durand Cup, Mohammedan Sporting officials have reposed faith in Subhas Bhowmick. After a meeting with the beleaguered coach at the club tent on Wednesday, an official made it clear that Bhowmick would be in the hot seat for the upcoming tournaments. 

 However, the club has not taken Mike Okoros absence during the Durand Cup lightly and the Nigerian may face punishment once he returns from Poland. 

 In another development, IFA has asked club secretary Sultan Ahmed to attend a meeting to discuss Douglas da Silvas claims that the club owes him money. The Brazilian moved IFA in this connection.

 Mahadevi Birla Girls HS School became the champions in the 10th ITA-organised inter-school tennis meet. In the girls final at the SAI on Wednesday, they beat last years finalists La Martiniere 2-0. 

 Second-seeded South Point rose to their billing and defended the boys team championship, beating St Pauls 2-1.

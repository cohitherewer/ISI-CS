 Williams name Karthikeyan as test driver

Chennai: Indian Formula 1 driver Narain Karthikeyan has got a new lease of life as a test driver for Team Williams in the coming season. 

Welcoming Williams decision to select him as a test driver, Karthikeyan said, I am extremely happy at this new breakthrough in my F1 career. This is a big thing for me. I share a long-standing association with the Tata group that has supported me in pursuit of this F1 journey. 

Confirming the contract with the Tatas, Sir Frank Williams, principal of Team Williams has said: Karthikeyans brief period in the car last December, during which he provided valuable feedback, made a very distinct impression on our engineers.

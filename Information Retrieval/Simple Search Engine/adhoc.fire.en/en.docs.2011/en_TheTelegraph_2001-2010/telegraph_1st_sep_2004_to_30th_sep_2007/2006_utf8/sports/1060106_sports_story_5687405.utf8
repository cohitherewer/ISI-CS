 Rain may ruin SA prospects

Sydney: South Africa were left praying for better weather after persistent rain ruined their bold attempt to win the third and final Test against Australia on Thursday. 

Less than 21 overs were completed on a gloomy fourth day at the Sydney Cricket Ground effectively thwarting the visitors hopes of drawing the series. 

Needing a win to square the series after drawing in Perth then losing in Melbourne, South Africa ended the day leading by 186 runs with seven second-innings wickets in hand. 

They had been frantically trying to build a bigger lead but now face the prospect of having to make an early declaration on the last day ? for which more foul weather is forecast ? to give themselves any chance of winning. 

Were in the hands of the weather but basically it just boils down to that we just want to give ourselves a chance of winning the game, South Africa allrounder Shaun Pollock told a news conference. 

At the end of the day it doesnt matter if we lose the series 2-0. To protect a defeat and still go 0-1 down in the series is pointless. 

We might as well give ourselves a chance to win but at the same time you dont want to just make an easy target. 

Thursdays start was delayed by an hour because of showers and less than six overs were bowled after lunch when the heavens opened again. 

The umpires were jeered by sections of the crowd for not starting play earlier after lunch when the rain initially stopped. 

From our perspective we would have liked to carry on through the drizzle but youve got to understand the outfield gets wet, the ball gets wet, Pollock said. 

I thought the umpires handled it pretty well. 

Herschelle Gibbs led the South African charge with an exhilarating 67 off 74 balls but ran himself out in the pursuit of quick runs. 

Playing a virtual lone hand, Gibbs pounded 11 boundaries in his 98-minute innings before he was caught short of his ground by a direct-hit from Brad Hodge after a mix-up with Jacques Kallis. 

Kallis was unbeaten on 14 at the close with Ashwell Prince yet to get off the mark and the score at 94 for three. 

Kallis and Prince both scored centuries in a record fourth-wicket partnership of 219 which took more than six hours when the tourists employed a go-slow policy in their first innings. 

Meanwhile, Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath was given an official reprimand for obscene behaviour on the fourth day of the third and final Test on Thursday. 

McGrath was found guilty of the offence after appearing before an International Cricket Council (ICC) following an outburst in the 13th over of South Africas second innings. 

The paceman was reported by the on-field umpires Aleem Dar and Billy Bowden and third umpire Bob Parry for using language that is obscene, offensive or insulting and/or the making of an obscene gesture. 

McGrath was charged with a Level I offence.

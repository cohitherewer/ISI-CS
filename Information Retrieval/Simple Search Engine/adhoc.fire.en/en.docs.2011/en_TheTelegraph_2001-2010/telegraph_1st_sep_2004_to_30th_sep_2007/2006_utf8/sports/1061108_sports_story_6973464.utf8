 India slip one spot to 5th

 - ICC ODI RANKINGS 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India have slipped one spot to fifth in the latest LG ICC ODI rankings following their lacklustre show in the recently-concluded Champions Trophy. The Indians were tied fourth with Pakistan on 110 but slipped to fifth after points were calculated to three decimals. 

According to an ICC media release, Australia strengthened their position at the top of the table (131) and are nine points clear of second placed South Africa. The latter and New Zealand are also separated by nine points. Runners-up West Indies are at seventh but just seven points separate them and the Black Caps. 

MoT Chris Gayle climbed up to No. 2 in ODI batting rankings, a jump of two rungs. Gayle also took the top spot in allrounders chart. 

Among Indians, Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Harbhajan Singh remained the top-ranked batsman and bowler at sixth and 11th spots, respectively. Irfan Pathan is Indias top-ranked allrounder at sixth.

Calcutta: Putting the disappointment of the Commonwealth Games aside her, Soma Biswas hopes that things will fall in place in the build-up to the Asian Games in Doha. 

The Arjuna Awardee heptathletes next assignment is the World Combined Events Challenge in Desenzano De Garda, Italy, on May 12-13. 

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is sponsoring her trip to Italy and Soma thinks such financial helps would boost her ahead of the Asian Games, slated for December. 

Following my approach to the state government, the CII has come forward to help me. This help may be small in content but huge in motivating me for the upcoming tournaments, the Bengal girl remarked on Monday. 

The CIIs gesture has come close on the heels of the Mittal Trusts announcement of sponsoring fellow heptathlete Sushmita Singha Roy till the London Olympics. Is she disappointed? 

The 28-year-old, however, bypassed the query, saying that a few corporate houses are planning to focus on those athletes who are young and have potential, for the 2012 Olympics. Good to see Sushmita getting the sponsors. 

Soma, meanwhile, believed that lack of quality competition before the Commonwealth Games put her at disadvantage in Melbourne. Besides, I had taken it a bit easy and that sense of complacency affected my performance in 200m and long jump. But at the end of the day, I found the competition as tough as it is in the Olympics or World Combined meets, observed Soma, who even failed to make finals in Melbourne. 

She, however, is quite pleased with the fact that the upcoming international meets will surely shape her up for the Doha Games. 

The AFIs Finish coach Mika Jarvanin has been instrumental in Somas participation in Desenzano, for which she is leaving the city on May 8. After that, she will take part in three Asian Grand Prix meets ? in Bangalore, Pune and Bangkok. 

I dont know in how many World Combined Events (there are five in all), Ill be able to take part. But however little chances come my way, Ill aim at securing points somewhere between 5800 and 5900. If Im consistent, I can push it well past 6000 and from there, anything can happen, Soma pointed out.

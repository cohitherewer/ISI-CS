 Want to focus on Tunisia tie: Fabregas

Kamen: Spain is trying to tone down expectations on the team after its 4-0 win over Ukraine turned the perennial World Cup underachiever into a favourite to lift the trophy. 

It could be a bit dangerous to think that every game is going to be like this, Spains Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas said after practice on Saturday. 

 People are saying Spain, they are fantastic, while previously they had doubts. I think in our mind there is only one thing: our next game against Tunisia. 

All we want to do is play the same football. 

On Monday, Spain face Tunisia, who tied Saudi Arabia 2-2 in their Group H opener. The Spanish line-up is likely to be the same as it was against Ukraine, although the starters lost 2-0 to the substitutes in a training game Saturday. 

Normally you dont fix something that isnt broken. Its logical, said Fabregas, who came on as a second-half substitute against Ukraine. But those of us who are substitutes have to stay focused because we could be given an opportunity at any time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Itll take a huge effort from India

 - Afridi and Sehwag hold the key... They will have a big impact: Waqar Younis 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Peshawar: Waqar Younis believes Pakistan will start overwhelming favourites in the one-day series beginning here Monday. 

It will be tough for India? Pakistan are riding a wave of confidence after the Karachi victory and it will take a huge effort from the Indians to reverse the tide, Waqar told The Telegraph on the flight from Lahore Sunday evening. 

Karachi has given a new impetus to the Pakistan side. Dont forget they are also more balanced. The success of youngsters such as Faisal Iqbal and Mohammed Asif has given them a new identity. The Indians are struggling and the home side is much ahead on current form, explained the former Pakistan captain. 

Waqar feels Shahid Afridi and Virender Sehwag could hold the key in deciding the fortunes in the five-match series. Afridi has been in cracking form and is matured. Likewise, if Sehwag gets going it will be hard to stop him. Their bating will have a big impact on the course of the match? 

I named them because I thought they can be matchwinners. But it could always be someone else who might turn out to be the hero? It could be Inzamam, it could be Yuvraj? You cannot predict in one-day cricket, Waqar said. 

What about Sachin Tendulkar? Is he past his prime? 

That is difficult to say? One bad series doesnt mean the good days are over for him. It will take a while to pass a judgement on Sachin? One cant forget his achievements over the years. Remember he has come out of such slump in his career previously too, Waqar remarked. 

Did the Indians make a mistake by not including Sourav Ganguly in the one-day side? I cannot answer that. Theres an Indian selector (Sanjay Jagdale, who will be with the side for the first two ODIs) on the same flight. You should ask him that? 

He should be better placed to answer, the discontent in Waqars voice at Souravs omission was not to be missed though.

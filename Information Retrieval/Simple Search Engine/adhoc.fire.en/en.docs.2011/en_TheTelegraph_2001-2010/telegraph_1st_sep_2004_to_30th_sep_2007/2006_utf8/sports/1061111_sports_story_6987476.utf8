 Ashraf: PCB has nothing against duo

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Friday scoffed at suggestions that it has been too harsh on fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif, saying the bans were in line with its zero tolerance policy on doping. 

PCB chairman Nasim Ashraf said he had no personal vendetta against the two bowlers. 

The fact is that we are signatories to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) regulations and we are not prepared to have any tolerance for doping. 

That is why we called them back and formed an independent tribunal to handle the case. The tribunal decided to ban them and that was not our decision, he said. 

Ashraf, who took over as the PCB chairman last month, made it clear that the board would no longer tolerate any indiscipline in the team.

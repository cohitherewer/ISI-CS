 Quick Takes

 Traffic check for Maradona

 Hamm: Former Argentina 

 soccer player Diego Maradona has been involved in a traffic 

 police check, an official said Saturday. However, he would 

 not confirm a report that the star was fined for speeding.

 A German daily reported that 

 a Volkswagen van driven by Maradona, was stopped on the 

 autobahn near Hamm, east of Gelsenkirchen, on Thursday night 

 ? the day before Argentina beat Serbia 6-0.

 According to the daily, the van 

 was travelling 40 km (25 miles) per hour above the 80 kmph 

 (50 mph) speed limit for the stretch, where roadworks were 

 being carried out, and Maradona was fined about euro 200.

 Dutch woes

 Berlin: Hundreds of Dutch 

 fans had to watch their teams 2-1 win over Ivory Coast 

 in their underwear in Stuttgart on Friday after stewards 

 at entry points to the stadium rumbled an ambush marketing 

 ploy.

 The Netherlands supporters all 

 turned up in garish orange lederhosen displaying the name 

 of Dutch brewery Bavaria and were ordered to remove them 

 by stewards before being allowed to enter the Gottlieb-Daimler-Stadion. 

 They then went into the match and watched it in their underwear. 

 Peaceful Cup 

 Berlin: A senior German 

 security official has expressed satisfaction with the first 

 week of the World Cup and forecast that the tournament will 

 remain peaceful.

 So far, the only significant trouble 

 came alongside Wednesdays Germany-Poland match in 

 Dortmund, where 429 people were detained.

 All but three had been released 

 by the Thursday morning. 

 Janas future uncertain

 Barsinghausen: Pawel Janas 

 future as Poland coach could hinge on the teams result 

 in its final match with Costa Rica.

 Asked if the Poles last 

 World Cup match with the Ticos would decide 

 Janas fate, the president of the Polish Soccer Federation 

 Michal Listkiewicz said in a certain sense, yes.

 Definitely a three-match 

 result of no goals and no points would be a very poor result, 

 lets not kid ourselves, Listkiewicz said on 

 Friday. 

 The new soccer language

 Berlin: Carlos Puyol is 

 a rono. Englands metatarsal 

 is over. Dida was far from a fliegenfanger in 

 Brazils opening match.

 These are some of the expressions 

 players should be using at the World Cup, if a soccer-inspired 

 language catches on.

 Socceranto fuses 

 jargon, player names and six languages (Portuguese, Spanish, 

 Italian, German, English and French) to create one complete 

 soccer tongue.

 Drawn from a Polish doctors 

 idea of the need for an international language, socceranto 

 will make it easier for players, referees, and coaches to 

 communicate ? especially with 18 different languages and 

 an unknown number of dialects being spoken at the tournament 

 in Germany. 

 9-2 odds for Messi amp; 

 Co

 London: After a 6-0 crushing 

 of Serbia-Montenegro, Argentina on Friday jumped above England 

 into second place in the latest World Cup odds being offered 

 by bookmakers William Hill.

 The victory put Jose Pekermans 

 team into the last 16 with a game to spare and Hill cut 

 its odds from 13-2 to 9-2. England slipped from 5-1 to 6-1 

 after two unconvincing victories over Paraguay and Trinidad 

 and Tobago. Brazil remains the strong favorite but Hills 

 also lengthened its odds from 11-4 to 3-1. 

 Ticketing blues

 Berlin: An English tour 

 operator has been left empty-handed after paying ?54,000 

 pounds (euro79,000; US$100,000) to buy World Cup tickets 

 for 400 children on the Internet.

 Cologne police said the 48-year-old 

 man sought tickets for Saturdays Portugal-Iran match 

 in Frankfurt and, after World Cup organisers in Germany 

 were unable to help the man, he turned to an English-based 

 Internet site that purported to offer tickets. 

 Fifa member faces music

 Berlin: A member of Fifas 

 executive committee has admitted selling World Cup tickets 

 at three times their face value and has been ordered to 

 leave Germany as soon as possible, world soccers governing 

 body said on Saturday.

 Ismail Bhamjee of Botswana has 

 signed a statement admitting selling 12 tickets for Englands 

 match against Trinidad amp; Tobago on Thursday for 300 

 euros each, 200 euros more than the face value, Fifa said 

 in a statement.

 I am very disappointed about 

 the conduct of a member of the Fifa Executive Committee, 

 Fifa president Sepp Blatter said. 

 Prized pork

 Berlin: If Xavi Hernandez 

 misses Spanish food he now has more than a handful. The 

 Spain playmaker received a whole leg of ham Friday from 

 a Spanish comedian who interrupted a press conference to 

 honour Xavi for being named Man of the Match in the opener 

 against Ukraine.

 I dont know if the 

 team doctor will approve, a somewhat stunned Xavi 

 said as he received the Pata Negra ? Iberian 

 ham of the finest quality ? after practice at Spains 

 camp in Kamen. 

 Crash course for US troops 

 Wuerzburg: The 68,000 US 

 troops stationed in Germany should blend in better with 

 the millions of World Cup soccer fans thanks to a crash 

 course on clean sheets, nutmegs 

 and bicycle kicks from Forces Radio.

 For American Forces Network, sports 

 news at this time of year would normally be a diet of basketball 

 and baseball scores, but recognising the tournament taking 

 place on the doorstep it is providing tips and phone-in 

 discussions to help soldiers follow the games.

 One quiz this week tested listeners 

 knowledge of soccer terminology that are to most more alien 

 than the sport itself. 

 Hanover hospitality

 Hanover: German police 

 provided free bed and breakfast for over 300 Mexican fans 

 stranded after their countrys World Cup Group D match 

 with Angola on Friday night.

 A spokesman for Hanover police 

 said they helped out fans who found themselves with no accommodation 

 for the night in the city or missed their train.

 Basically we put just over 

 300 of them up in the train station where we have two empty 

 floors and is warm and dry, the police spokesman said 

 on Saturday. Before they left, we gave them breakfast 

 and they travelled on to their next location.

 Jeev still on top

 - Indian fires a five-under 67 

Fukuoka: Jeev Milkha Singh played an attacking golf to return with five-under 67 and a three-shot lead after three rounds in the Asahiryokuken Yomiuri Memorial golf tournament here on Saturday. 

Jeev, the current UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit leader, opened with three birdies and closed with three birdies to be ahead of second-placed Yoshikazu Haru (67). 

Jeev needed 28 putts on Saturday to go through the round and his iron play was once again the feature of his play. He had an incredible nine birdies and four bogeys as he attacked the pins relentlessly. 

I am playing well and I am feeling confident with every shot, said Jeev. I had a great start and a great finish and in between, too, I played well, though the few dropped shots set me back a little. But five-under and a decent lead after three rounds puts me in a good position to go for the title, he added. 

Jeevs nearest rival Tetsuji Hiratsuka (70), who was one behind overnight seemed fine with two birdies in first three holes, but it was in the back that Jeev moved into a different zone. 

After turning in two-under, Jeev started with a bogey on tenth. But he quickly grabbed a birdie on 11th only to drop a shot on 12th. Then came birdies on 13th and 14th, before he missed a par putt on 15th. 

At this stage he was tied for lead with Yoshikazu at 15-under. While the Japanese parred his last three holes, Jeev birdied all of them. 

Interestingly, Jeevs total of 18-under 198 for 54 holes equals his best for 54 holes. He had the same total after three rounds in the 2004 Asia-- Okinawa Open, when he finished tied second after leading the tournament by four shots after three days. 

Jeev is looking for his first career title in Japan and if he does that, it will be a unique achievement of titles on three different tours this year. (PTI)

 Inquiry into Cronje death

Durban: Four years after South Africas former cricket captain Hansie Cronje died in a plane crash, an official inquiry will be launched in a high court on Monday. 

The inquest will also deal with the deaths of pilot Willie Meyer and co-pilot Ian Noakes, a newspaper reported on Friday. Legal procedure in the country demands that an inquest must be held into any death following an aircraft accident. 

Cronje died on June 1, 2002 when the Hawker Siddeley 748, which was bound for George from Bloemfontein, crashed in rough weather in the mountains near its destination. He was 32. 

The inquest was originally scheduled to be held in the magistrates court in George, but it was moved due to the technical nature of the evidence to be heard after a request to the minister of justice.

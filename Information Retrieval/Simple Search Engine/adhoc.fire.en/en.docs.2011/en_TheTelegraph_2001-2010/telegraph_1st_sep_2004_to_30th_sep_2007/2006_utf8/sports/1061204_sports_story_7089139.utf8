The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Kullu hattrick in 7-1 win over Taipei

 - Humpy shocked, but stays in lead 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha : The choice of carrying the Indian flag during the opening ceremony of the Asian Games here did not fall in the wrong hands. On Sunday, Jyoti Kullu, the captain of the Indian womens hockey team dished out a sparkling performance and struck thrice to guide India to a fine 7-1 victory over Chinese Taipei in the round robin tie at the Al-Rayyan Stadium. 

Not lagging behind was Surinder Kaur, the girl who had the distinction of being the top scorer at the World Cup. She scored twice, while Subhadra Pradhan and Saba Anjum got the other two goals. 

However, the real competition beings in their next match when India take on mighty China. Even coach Maharaj Kishan Kaushik admits that China would be an extremely tough team to beat. They may have finished fourth in the World Cup, but they have the ability to become the world beaters. 

In table tennis, India had a bad day in mixed doubles that prompted national champion Achanta Sharath Kamal to call for a change of policy for selecting the team. 

In the first match of the mixed doubles, Mouma Das and Soumyadeep Roy put up a good fight before going down to Nu Gao and XL Zhang of Singapore in a round of 32 encounter. 

After losing the first game at 11-3, the duo came back to bag the second game at 11-8. In the next two, the Singapore pair won 11-3 and 12-10. 

In the other mixed doubles match, JW Lee and EH Lee of China got the better of Indian pair Achanta Sharath Kamal and Poulami Ghatak 11-6, 11-8, 11-9. 

Sharath, the national champion, later said that it was not physically possible for one person to take part in so many events in one competition. 

The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTF) should select different players for different events. Its extremely difficult for one player to sustain himself in team, singles, doubles and mixed doubles events, he said. 

The Indian pugilists had yet another good day in office. While Jitender Kumar defeated Karim Nauman of Pakistan on points in 51kg, Diwakar Prasad got the better of Mohammed Dmirieh in a 57kg bout. 

Agencies add: After winning in the first five rounds of the rapid chess competition, Koneru Humpy was shocked in the sixth by Chinas Xue Zhao but stayed in the lead. 

Following her are three players with 4.5 points each Atousa Pourkashiyan of Iran, Zhao and Irine Kharisma Sukandar of Indonesia. 

In the mens event, P. Harikrishna won one match and drew another to take his tally to 3.5. He beat Ronald Dabelo of the Philippines in fifth round after drawing with Bangladeshs Reefat Bin Sattar in the fourth. In the sixth, he lost to Chinas Yue Wang. 

Sasikiran, who has 3.5 points, drew with Mohammed Ali Sayed of Qatar. He won the fifth round after four draws by beating Ahmad Samhouri of Jordan.

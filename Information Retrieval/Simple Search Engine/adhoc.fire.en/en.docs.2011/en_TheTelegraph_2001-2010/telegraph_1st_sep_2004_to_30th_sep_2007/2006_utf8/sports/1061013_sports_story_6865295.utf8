The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Teammates stand by Bhutia

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Bhaichung 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan players on Thursday stood united in condemning the three-match suspension on teammate Bhaichung Bhutia and said that the IFAs move would be detrimental to the development of the game here. 

While coach Biswajit Bhattacharya and veteran midfielder Basudeb Mondal have called for disciplining the referee (Debashish Mishra) as well, Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barreto felt Bhaichungs punishment was too severe. 

A referee cannot be above the law. If Bhaichung was to be punished, he also deserved the same treatment for his faulty officiating, Biswajit said. 

Why did he let the match go on when Bhaichung was sitting on the players bench (after being red-carded). He shouldve stopped the game and settled the matter there itself, he added. 

Though Barreto admitted that Bhaichung did flout the rule by not leaving the field after his red-card, he pointed out that its too severe a punishment for him. 

Another Mohun Bagan player, Mehtab Hussain, accused the IFA of scarcely standing by the players. They (IFA) talk of professionalism, but such decisions will make us insecured, he maintained. 

Bhaichung wasnt available for comment, but a club official said the next course of action would be taken only after an internal meeting next week. 

 Fund-raiser 

Meanwhile, the Football Players Association of India will hold a charity match at Howrah Stadium on October 28, in memory of late Sudip Chatterjee. 

The match will be played between the Indians and foreigners currently playing in the country. While the Indian side will be led by Bhaichung, Barreto will captain the foreigners. 

The funds, raised from the match, will be handed over to Chatterjees family.

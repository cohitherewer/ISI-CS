 Iraqi referee kidnapped

Baghdad: An Iraqi international soccer referee was kidnapped as he left the Iraqi Federation of Football in Baghdad, police said on Tuesday. 

Hazim Hussein had just left the Shaab Stadium in north-eastern Baghdad, where the federation is headquartered, on Monday when he was taken by assailants, police captain Mohammed Abdul Ghani said. 

Tariq Ahmed, head of the Iraqi Referee Association, told an Iraqi daily that the kidnappers had asked for a $200,000 ransom. Hussein had been scheduled to travel to Amman to officiate the tie between Jordan and Qatar, Ahmed said.

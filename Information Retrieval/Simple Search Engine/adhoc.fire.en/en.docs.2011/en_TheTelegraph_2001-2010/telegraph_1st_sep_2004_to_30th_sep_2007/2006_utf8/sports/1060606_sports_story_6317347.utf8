 QUICK TAKES

 Plan 

 to hold Cup biennially on anvil: Report 

 Singapore: A radical plan 

 to restructure international football, prepared for top 

 European clubs, envisages the World Cup being held every 

 two years, a media report said on Monday. The proposal, 

 called Grand Slam World, is part of a presentation 

 commissioned by the G-14 grouping of European clubs ? a 

 collection of the 18 richest sides in Europe ? by Hypercube, 

 a Dutch consultancy, a British paper reported. Making the World Cup, which starts in Germany on Friday, 

 a biennial event is the most radical of four options outlined 

 in a 36-page presentation, the newspaper said. Another option 

 called Grand Slam Euro would see continental 

 tournaments, such as the European Championship, also held 

 every two years, while a possible World Cup for Clubs would 

 be contested every four years.

 Cloud on Dutch prospects 

 Frankfurt: The Netherlands were still uncertain 

 how serious the injuries were to three of their starters 

 ? Phillip Cocu, Wesley Sneijder and Giovanni van Bronckhorst 

 ? during a bruising warm-up against Australia on Sunday 

 which ended 1-1. The medical team was likely to have a full 

 assessment upon the arrival of the team in Germany late 

 Tuesday, officials said on Monday.

 Nayeems wish 

Calcutta: Syed Nayeemuddin has urged the Bengal government not to send a big delegation to Germany, but instead set aside part of the money for a financial grant for Sailen Manna. 

Sailen Manna is old and ailing. He has fallen on bad times. The government should help him financially, by cutting costs on sending the delegation, Nayeem said. He also called upon the state government to be careful while selecting the delegation. Former stars like P.K. Banerjee have been sent on earlier occasions. This time, chances should be given to others, he said.

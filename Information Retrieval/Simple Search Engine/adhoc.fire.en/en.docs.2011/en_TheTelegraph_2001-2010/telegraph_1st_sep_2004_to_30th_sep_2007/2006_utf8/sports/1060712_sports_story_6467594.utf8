 Pete debut

Newport Beach (California): Driven by victory during his glittering ATP career, Pete Sampras settled on having some fun in his World Team Tennis (WTT) debut on Monday. 

The 34-year-old won his doubles match but lost his singles to world No. 211 John Paul Fruttero as his Newport Beach Breakers team were beaten 20-22 by St Louis Aces.

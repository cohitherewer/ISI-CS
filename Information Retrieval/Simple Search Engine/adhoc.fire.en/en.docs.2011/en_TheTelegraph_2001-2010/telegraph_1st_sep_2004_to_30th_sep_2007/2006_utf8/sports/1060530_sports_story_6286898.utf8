The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB exodus 

to Md. Sp. on the cards 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting ? under a new dispensation ? are creating a flutter in the build-up to the transfers window. 

 If a senior Mohammedan Sporting official is to believe, Mike Okoro, Syed Rahim Nabi, Shylo Malsawmtluanga, M. Suresh, Habibur Rahman Mondal, Chandan Das, Debjit Ghosh and Kalia Kulothungan will be playing for them in the coming season. 

They are likely to be joined by Noel Wilson, Subhashish Roy Chowdhury and Rajib Ahmed of Mohun Bagan. 

The presence of Subhas Bhowmick as coach is the key reason behind this exodus of the East Bengal players. 

Stung by the development, East Bengal officials on Sunday night called up the police and raided in vain a Mohammedan Sporting den, alleging the latter have kidnapped some of the red-and-gold players.

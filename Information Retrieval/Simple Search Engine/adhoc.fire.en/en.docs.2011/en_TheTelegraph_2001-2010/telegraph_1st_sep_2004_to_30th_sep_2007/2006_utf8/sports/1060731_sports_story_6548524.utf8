Stanford: Sania Mirza and Bethanie Mattek of the US went down in straight sets to Italys Maria Elena Camerin and Gisela Dulko of Argentina in the doubles semi-finals of the Bank of West Classic on Saturday. 

The fourth-seeded pair of Dulko and Camerin carved out a 6-4, 6-3 win in the final of the $ 600,000 Tier II event. 

Sania had reached the finals last week in a tier III WTA event in Mason, partnering Polands Marta Domashowska, which also fetched her career-best doubles ranking of 31. 

Meanwhile, in singles second seed Patty Schnyder set up a final showdown with world No. 2 Kim Clisters after cruising past French teenager Tatiana Golovin 7-6, 6-1 in Saturdays semi-final. 

Top seed Clijsters, chasing her second title of the year, outclassed third seed Nicole Vaidisova 7-5, 6-2 in the days first semi-final. 

Earlier, Clijsters exhausted the 17-year-old Czech Vaidisova in long rallies and kept her off balance by varying the speed of her replies. 

When you play younger players, they go out and have nothing to lose but once it gets close, thats when experience can play a role and they can get frustrated, said the US Open champion.

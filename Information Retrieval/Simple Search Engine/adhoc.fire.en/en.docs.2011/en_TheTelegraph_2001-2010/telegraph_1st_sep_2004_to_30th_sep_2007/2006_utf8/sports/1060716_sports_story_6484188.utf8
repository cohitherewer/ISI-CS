 Rain truncates days card 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT 

 Alford on Romantic Fire

Bangalore: The stewards of Bangalore Turf Club decided to cancel Saturdays programme, from the sixth race onwards, owing to intermittent rain which rendered the underfoot conditions not conducive to racing.

 Stewards took the decision after some jockeys refused to ride. The penetrometer reading at that time was 5.8 which means soft going. An early cancellation could have saved punters from miseries as favourites failed. Nevertheless C. Alford, on Romantic Fire won the Stewards Cup.

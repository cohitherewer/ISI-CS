The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EB eye full points to stay in hunt

 NFL clash vs Salgaocar

 Bhaichung is a doubtful 

 starter 

 Panaji: Title contenders 

 East Bengal face an acid test on Sunday against Salgaocar 

 in their quest for the 10th ONGC National Football League 

 title.

 East Bengal, who are placed second 

 with 28 points from 14 matches, need to win both their encounters 

 against Salgaocar and Sporting Clube de Goa to stay in contention 

 for the title.

 But they will be missing four 

 key players for the clash at Nehru Stadium, Margao. Midfielders 

 ? Jayanta Sen and Guy Ndem ? are out with double bookings 

 while Gouranga Dutta and Syed Rahim Nabi will miss the game 

 due to injuries.

 To add to their woes, skipper 

 Bhaichung Bhutia also injured his neck during the match 

 against Air India and is a doubtful starter.

 The Calcutta outfit, which has 

 struggled to find form in their last match, needs to be 

 more focus against Salgaocar who have a good record against 

 them.

 Despite conceding the lead in 

 the points table to Mahindra United, East Bengal coach Phillipe 

 de Ridder said he will take one match at a time.

 I know it will be challenging 

 to play against Salgaocar at their home, but we have enough 

 ammunition to face them, he said. 

 Salgaocar are at the bottom with 

 eight points from 12 matches and need to win all their remaining 

 four matches to avoid relegation.

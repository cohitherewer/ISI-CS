 Sourav accepts Bindras invitation

 Mohali Test

 Sourav 

 Mohali: Sourav Ganguly 

 may be out of favour with the selectors but that doesnt 

 mean he is not in demand. The former India skipper is one 

 of the invitees for the second Test between India and England 

 which begins here on Thursday.

 He has been invited as a 

 former captain to watch the match and has already given 

 his confirmation. Sourav said he will be coming after the 

 Deodhar Trophy match in Jaipur on Thursday, Punjab 

 Cricket Association (PCA) president I.S. Bindra said here 

 on Monday.

 M.A.K. Pataudi and Kapil Dev are 

 the other ex-captains to have accepted invitations to watch 

 the Test.

 Bindra said BCCI president Sharad 

 Pawar will inaugurate an indoor net facility on Wednesday 

 at a function which will also be attended by Punjab governor 

 S.F. Rodrigues.

 PCA will bestow honorory membership 

 to Rodrigues and Pawar that day.

 Bindra also said the BCCI had 

 selected Mohali as one of the venues for the Champions Trophy 

 to be held in October-November this year.

 We have received a letter 

 from the BCCI in this regard. However, since it is an ICC 

 event, the final decision will be taken by them, he 

 said.

 Regarding the indoor net facility, 

 Bindra said the turf had been imported from Australia. Bindra 

 said 50 per cent Test tickets (general blocks) have been 

 sold and added that sales should pick up over the next two 

 days.

 PCA secretary M.P. Pandove said 

 a result-oriented wicket had been prepared. 

 The wicket should produce a result, he said.

 Revealing plans for further improving 

 the facilities at the PCA Stadium, he said the ticketing 

 system would be made hi-tech. A fan can purchase a smart 

 ticket which will have a magnetic chip to allow entry. 

 Extension work of the north pavilion was also likely to 

 be taken up shortly, he said.

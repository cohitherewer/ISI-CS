 4 arrested in connection with assault on players

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The alleged assault on four Bengal cadet girls in Pondicherry led to the arrest of four persons on Tuesday, two days after the incident. 

PTI quoted senior superintendent of police (Pondicherry) B. Sirkanth as informing that the owner of a guest house, two of his employees and another person were arrested following the receipt of a complaint from the co-ordinator of the tournament. 

The girls ? all were below 12 years and part of the Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA) team in the national cadet and sub-junior meet ? were assaulted by some miscreants while sleeping in their room at the Pondicherry guest house. 

According to a BTTA official here, the girls were taken to the police station and also gave a statement before the chief judicial magistrate regarding the incident. Both the state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and Gautam Chakraborty (additional commissioner of police) have called up in Pondicherry today to check on the incident, the official added. 

The whole BTTA squad left the city on Tuesday night and will arrive here in the early morning of Thursday. Srikanth said police protection was given to the girls on their return journey. In another twist, former Pondicherry home minister P. Kannan has requested the Madras High Court to appoint an inquiry commission to probe the incident. 

Meanwhile, Bengal Olympic Association has condemned the incident and urged the state government to take up the issue in proper forum.

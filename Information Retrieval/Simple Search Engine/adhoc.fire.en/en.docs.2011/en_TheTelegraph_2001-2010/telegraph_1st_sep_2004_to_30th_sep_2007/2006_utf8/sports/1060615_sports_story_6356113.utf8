The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Player of the Day

 KAKA 

Those who watched the 2002 World Cup, would remember Kaka as the one waving desperately to the referee after Scholari attempted to put him in seconds before the long whistle in the final. 

There was no time and the handsome midfielder had to remain contented with playing just 19 minutes in the entire tournament. 

But today at 24, Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite (Kaka) is one of the most feared players. The Brazilian media calls him a member of the magic quartet with Ronaldinho, Ronaldo and Adriano. 

On Tuesday against Croatia, Kaka showed why Carlos Alberto Parreira said that the AC Milan player will start as a principle. Kaka made all the difference in an even game. When he received the ball in the 44th minute, he found himself being closed down by Tudor and Kranjcar. 

But he left both standing and trailing with a deft first touch and then curled a shot past goalkeeper Pletikosa. As the stadium glittered with the popping of a thousand flashbulbs, the Brazilian fans, till then under suffocating pressure, erupted with joy. 

As a child, Kakas football career was almost over before it had begun after a diving accident, which left him with a fractured vertebra. His miraculous recovery was the beginning of a life devoted to Christianity, which is still obvious from his goal celebrations as he points to the heavens.

Toronto: Roger Federer battled through to the Toronto Masters semi-finals with a 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 win over Xavier Malisse on Friday. 

Playing his first event since claiming his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title, the world No. 1 has yet to slip into a comfortable rhythm and for the second consecutive night was taken to three sets. 

Although Federer needed two hours and 30 minutes to put away Malisse, the Belgian seldom looked capable of halting the Swiss 51-match winning streak on north American hard courts. 

Federer has not lost a hardcourt match in north America since falling to Dominik Hrbaty in the first round of Cincinnati Masters in August 2004. 

First set when he was breakpoint up at 5-5, I thought this could be a tough match, Federer said. But I ended up winning the tie-breaker and after that it was never really in doubt too much. 

It just felt like it was tough out there tonight. For some reason I didnt feel that comfortable. 

Chiles Fernando Gonzalez overcame Argentine Jose Acasuso 6-1, 7-5 in an all-South American quarter-final later on Friday and the 15th seed will be the next in line to try and stop Federer reaching his 17th consecutive final. 

The other semi-final brings together two of the games emerging talents, Briton Andy Murray and Frenchman Richard Gasquet. 

Riding the momentum of his appearance in the Washington final last week, Murray battled into the last four at a Masters Series for the first time with a testing 6-4, 6-7, 6-3 win over Finlands 14th seed Jarkko Nieminen. 

Meanwhile, Leander Paes and Martin Damm of Czech Republic upset the second seeded pair of Swedens Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi of Belarus to enter the semi-finals. 

Paes and Damm, seeded seventh, won 7-6 (7-4) 7-5 in the quarter final here on Friday.

Montreal: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis advanced to the quarter finals of the Rogers Cup on Thursday after defeating Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia 7-5, 6-4. 

Every point counted, thats all you can say, the 1999 and 2000 champion said. Her win came as a relief to organisers of the tournament, which has been plagued by withdrawals, injuries and no-shows all week. 

A day after the tournament lost world No. 1 Kim Clijsters with a wrist injury, fifth seed Vaidisova withdrew with a right shoulder problem, giving Australian qualifier Nicole Pratt a walkover into Fridays quarter finals. 

Seventh-seeded Hingis will play Russias Svetlana Kuznetsova, who moved on with a 6-2, 7-6 victory over Ai Sugiyama of Japan. Slovenias Katarina Srebotnik, the 14th seed, overwhelmed Stephanie Dubois 6-3, 6-2 to set up a quarter final clash with Ivanovic. 

Russian Anna Chakvetadze beat Frances Nathalie Dechy 6-1, 6-4 to set up a meeting with Israels Shahar Peer. 

Ninth seed Dinara Safina ended the challenge of American qualifier Shenay Perry 7-5, 6-3 and now faces Australias Pratt. (Reuters)

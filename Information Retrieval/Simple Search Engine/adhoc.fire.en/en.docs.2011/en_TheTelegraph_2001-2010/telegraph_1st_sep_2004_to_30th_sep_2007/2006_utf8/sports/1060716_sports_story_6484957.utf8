 US keep Klinsmann option open

Washington: Former Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann will be included on the list of candidates to succeed Bruce Arena as coach of the US soccer team, officials said Friday. 

Klinsmann, who lives in California, stepped down this week after two years with the German national side saying he wanted to spend time with his family. 

Hes somebody that is a very interesting coach that lives in America that has expressed desire to remain in America, so Im sure well talk, US Soccer president Sunil Gulati said. Whether well talk seriously about this, well see. 

Hes played at a very high level, hes now been very successful with the German team, he has a much better handle on the American soccer scene than someone who hasnt spent time here and, most importantly, hes a very inquisitive guy, Gulati said. 

Gulati announced on Friday that Arenas contract would not be renewed after eight years in charge. The move came on the heels of a first-round exit by the US squad at the 2006 World Cup.

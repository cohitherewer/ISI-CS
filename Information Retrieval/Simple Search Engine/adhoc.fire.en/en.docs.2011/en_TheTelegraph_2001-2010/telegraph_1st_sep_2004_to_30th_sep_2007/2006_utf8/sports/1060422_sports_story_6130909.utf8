 Sun Magic strikes 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Trainer S.Nawabs Sun Magic 

 was hard-pressed to win the upper division of the D.R.C. 

 Racing Official Cup in New Delhi on Friday. Tauseef Ahmed 

 guided the three-year-old. The lower division was, however, 

 an easy picking for the Magan Singh-trained four-year-old, 

 Before You, who was partnered by apprentice Ramandeep Singh 

 Bal.

 Doctrove to officiate in SA

Dubai: The West Indian umpire Billy Doctrove, who officiated in the infamous Oval Test in August, will return to action during Indias five-match ODI series in South Africa this month. 

Doctrove was one of the umpires who charged Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq with ball tampering during The Oval Test in August. Doctrove and Darrell Hair were not picked to stand in the Champions Trophy in India. 

The home umpire to stand in the India-South Africa series is yet to be appointed. 

Daryl Harper, Mark Benson and Asad Rauf will take turn to officiate the three Tests, the ICC said in a statement. Chris Broad and Roshan Mahanama have been appointed as Match Referees for the ODIs and Tests, respectively. (PTI)

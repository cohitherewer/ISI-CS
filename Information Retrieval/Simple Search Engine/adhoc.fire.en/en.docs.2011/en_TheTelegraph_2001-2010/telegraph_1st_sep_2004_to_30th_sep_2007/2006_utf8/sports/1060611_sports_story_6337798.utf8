 WI contracts row deepens

Gros Islet: The contracts controversy appears to be hitting West Indies cricket once again as the WICB failed to give the players retainers contract despite reminders. 

The West Indies Players Association (WIPA) president and chief executive officer Dinanath Ramnarine has said it was a disappointing development as there had been frequent reminders by the association to the WICB management. 

Players were still, most regrettably and unnecessarily without retainer match or tour contracts, Ramnarine was quoted as saying by a newspaper.

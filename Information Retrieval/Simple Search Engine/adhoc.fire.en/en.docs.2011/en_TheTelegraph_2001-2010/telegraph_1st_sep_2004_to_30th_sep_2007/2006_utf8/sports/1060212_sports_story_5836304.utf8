 Sania Mirza 

bows out in 

doubles too

Paris: Sania Mirzas campaign in the $600,000 Paris Indoor Open WTA Tour event came to an end after she lost in the second round of doubles on Saturday. 

Sania, partnering Liezel Huber of South Africa, lost 7-6 (6-8), 3-6, 6-7 (6-8) to Tathiana Garbin of Italy and Mashona Washington of the USA, who qualified for the semi-finals. 

The Indo-South African combine pulled off the first set via tie-breaker but let the advantage slip off by squandering the second set without much effort. Sania and Liezel ran out of the steam in the decider which was also stretched into a tie-breaker. 

The Indian has already exited from the singles event after her second-round defeat against Tatiana Golovin of France, who is facing Amelie Mauresmo in the semi-finals. Top seed Mauresmo humbled defending champion Dinara Safina 6-2, 6-2. (Agencies)

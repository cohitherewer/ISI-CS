Calcutta: Being a man from Brazil, the famous Rio Carnival has been a part of Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silvas life. The Durga Puja festival has already invaded the Bengali psyche and the East Bengal coach knows pretty well how important it is to gift something special to his teams millions of supporters at this time of the year. 

One can easily gauge it from his relaxed composure ahead of the big match against Mohun Bagan, from his occasional gesturing of V-signs during the customary press conference, from his determination to make amends of the first-leg loss. Yes, nothing but a win preponderates Pereiras mind. 

I dont want to give much thought to the fact that my team is better placed in the League. Irrespective of our position, a win is all what we want tomorrow, Pereira said on Monday, hours away from encountering Bhaichung Bhutia amp; Co. 

For the record, East Bengal now head the table with 22 points from nine matches while their rivals, the defending champions, are breathing down their neck with 18 from 10 matches. A victory on Tuesday will almost assure East Bengal of regaining the title. 

There is also an underlying motivation of exacting revenge on Mohun Bagan, when Bhaichung scuppered a visibly dominant East Bengals ambitions with an exquisite goal in the first leg. 

The scorer of that match, held exactly a month ago, believed that the pressure is now on the other side. Its a crunch tie, but East Bengal are under pressure. In a bid to win the League, they have to beat us, Bhaichung said on the match-eve. 

According to the India captain, the team played well in patches, but couldnt gel since the coach didnt have all the players at his disposal. 

Biswajit Bhattacharya admitted that like the first-leg clash, a lot would again depend on Bhaichung. Hes a one man army hes indispensable to any team under crisis, the Mohun Bagan coach pointed out. 

Almost in the same vein, Pereira hinted at man-marking the striker. 

Biswajit, however, added: I have a lot to lose and a lot to gain tomorrow, because the teams prestige is involved in any tie against East Bengal. 

It is Dharamjit Singhs absence due to his red-card against Mohammedan Sporting five days ago thats worrying Biswajit most. His absence is a key factor. But I hope the boys will rise to the occasion, he said. 

Pereira is also not sure if the injured Ashim Biswas will be available nor has he divulged anything about the Brazilian forward Marcio Fernandes Thomas chances of playing. 

Incidentally, there was no spectator present during Mohun Bagans morning practice session, the clubs decision to charge them for entering the ground being the key reason. 

Its surprising not to see the supporters around, admitted Bhaichung. But Ill not be short on motivation. Every match is new to me and thats how I keep my hunger alive, he remarked. 

It remains to be seen whether Pereiras ambitions again get devoured by the hungry Bhaichung.

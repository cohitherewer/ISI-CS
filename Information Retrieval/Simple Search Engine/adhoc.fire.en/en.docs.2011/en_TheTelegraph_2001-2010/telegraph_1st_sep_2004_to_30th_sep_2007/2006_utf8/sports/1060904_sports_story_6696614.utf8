 Jeev ends joint third 

Tokyo: A closing birdie on the 18th and final hole gave Jeev Milkha Singh his seasons best finish of a joint third place at the Fujisankei Classic golf on the Japanese Tour here on Sunday. 

The 34-year-old Indian notched his seventh top-10 finish in 10 starts as he finished with a one-over 72 on a very demanding golf course at the Fujizakura Country Club. 

Shingo Katayama won his fourth title of the season with a final round of two-under 69 that saw him aggregate 10-under 274 and win by three shots over Chinas Liang Wen Chong (64), who had the tournaments best round of seven-under 64 on Sunday. 

Jeev was joint third with Toru Taniguchi (71), Thai Prayad Marksaeng (71) and Hiroyuki Fujita (72) at two-under 282. (PTI)

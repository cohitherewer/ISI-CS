The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I cant imagine Rahul Dravid not being assertive

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

 - The one and only Ian Chappell on his favourite captains 

 plus... 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ian Chappell

Chandigarh: Ian Chappell remains most inspirational. Indeed, over three decades after his innings as captain ended, the cricket fraternity continues to talk of him with respect. In fact, he had a fantastic record winning 15 and losing only five of his 30 Tests. On Saturday, besides other things, Ian (who is here on a Media assignment) spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on the captains he has liked the most since quitting in early 1980. The 63-year-old icon even talked about the growing perception that younger brother Greg is calling the shots in the Team India dressing room. 

 The following are 

 excerpts

 On the captains (alphabetically) 

 he has enjoyed watching the most since retirement Stephen Fleming: Im 

 amazed he has lasted a decade. How could he put up with 

 the administrators for so long? They got to me in four years! 

 Hes a good captain, but in between, had lost a bit 

 of control... However, that phase is over and he now looks 

 in absolute command. Watching him captain New Zealand is 

 a nice sight. 

 Mike Gatting: 

 England won the 1986-87 Ashes in Australia and his leadership 

 played a role... I can straightaway recall his captaincy 

 in the Sydney Test... England were set to lose big, but 

 he counter-attacked ferociously... He went bang-bang and, 

 immediately, Allan Border had something else to worry about: 

 From merely thinking about how to get the remaining wickets, 

 he had to think about stopping the runs... England lost 

 the Test (by 55 runs), but Gatting was brilliant in getting 

 90-odd... Cricket is fascinating when it becomes a real 

 tactical battle... Thats when I enjoy it the most... 

 Also, Gatting ignored Ian Botham, for he was the sort who 

 wanted 15 fielders out on the park... If you listened to 

 a Botham, all you would be doing is following the ball. 

 That way, you end up being behind the game and, if youre 

 not ahead, youve had it. 

 Arjuna Ranatunga: 

 Id rated him highly even before Sri Lanka won the 

 1996 World Cup... Arjuna had come to Australia in 1989-90 

 with a side that was out-matched, but they drew the Brisbane 

 Test and it was late into the (second and final) Test in 

 Hobart that Australia took a firm grip... All because of 

 Arjunas smart captaincy... Then, moving to the (1996) 

 World Cup, when Australia declined to play in Sri Lanka, 

 Arjuna said he wanted Australia in the final so that his 

 team could beat them... That was a big statement... Most 

 captains wouldve been happy saying its good 

 that we dont have to play Australia... Later, on the 

 eve of the final at the Gaddafi, Arjuna gave a TV interview 

 to Ravi Shastri where he described Shane Warne as a Media 

 myth. Shane got an inkling and, when I went to interview 

 him, he asked: What has that fat b****** said about 

 me? I realised Arjuna had begun to win the psychological 

 battle even before the final had begun... I truly admired 

 the psychological side of his captaincy. 

 Mark Taylor: He 

 would be calm, controlled and always took the aggressive 

 option for Australia... Even if the team was in trouble, 

 he went for the aggressive option rather than the defensive 

 one. A captain has to be pro-active and Mark definitely 

 was one. 

 Michael Vaughan: I 

 was impressed by his captaincy in the last Ashes (2005), 

 which England won... Perception is very important and even 

 if theres turnmoil in your belly, you shouldnt 

 allow that to show... Vaughan remained calm throughout, 

 quietly making changes in the field... He didnt have 

 to show he was in command... If the captain isnt as 

 cool as cucumber, then that will get to the players. Theres 

 no point yelling if things arent going well... One 

 of my first-class captains would yell when things were going 

 wrong and, when he did so, all of us realised we were in 

 trouble... The last thing any captain would want his players 

 to think about is that the team is in trouble... 

 On Sourav Ganguly, Indias 

 most successful Test captain 

 Its a captains job 

 to make his team perform better and Sourav did that, particularly 

 when India played overseas... Yet, looking back, I think 

 he was a terrible handler of left-arm spinners and somebody 

 like Murali Kartik deserved a better deal... Also, at times, 

 he was arrogant on the field with some of his players... 

 I remember one instance when he and Rahul Dravid were involved 

 in a run out (second innings of the Mumbai Test against 

 Australia, 2001)... Sourav left making a gesture... I dont 

 think that ought to have been done... I dont know 

 who mixed up the call, but if Sourav hadnt been a 

 lazy runner, he wouldve made the crease... He took 

 India as far forward as he could, but had reached the use-by 

 date... The time had come for somebody else to take India 

 to the next level. Of course, you may argue whether India 

 have actually gone to the next level (under Dravid, who 

 has been captain for a year)... 

 On the perception that 

 Dravid isnt his own man and is dominated by Greg

 I cant imagine Rahul not 

 being assertive... He could speak to many people for their 

 views and, therefore, give that impression... I havent 

 spoken to Greg about this, but I recall Darren Lehmann telling 

 me without my having to ask that Greg gave him a free 

 hand when he was South Australias captain and Greg 

 the coach... Look, Greg understands the role of the captain 

 (he himself led Australia in 48 Tests and 49 ODIs) and, 

 while he feels the role of a coach is more important than 

 what I feel about the whole thing, he understands there 

 can just be one man in-charge of a cricket team the captain. 

 Gregs a strong-minded person and if you ask a question, 

 hes going to give a straightforward answer... I dont 

 believe Gregs a dictator in the dressing room. Moreover, 

 its not the captains job to please everybody 

 and Im sure Rahul isnt doing that. 

 On Australias current 

 captain, Ricky Ponting 

 Vaughan came through as the better 

 leader in the last Ashes... Ponting inherited a very good 

 team, but its not his team... He inherited 

 a team with a lot of senior players... Im not saying 

 hes indecisive, but the perception (in the 2005 Ashes) 

 was that he wanted to please the senior players... He would 

 consult Adam Gilchrist, Warne, Damien Martyn... It looked 

 as if he was captaining by committee and you must not do 

 that... Ponting didnt want to offend any of the seniors 

 and, in doing so, came across as indecisive... Ponting had 

 Glichrist and Warne standing close to him, on the field, 

 and a conversation on strategy could always have been had... 

 A public spectacle wasnt needed. 

 Finally, on the present-day 

 captain with the brightest future

 Mahela Jayawardene... Maravan 

 Atapattu, to my mind, had crossed the use-by date a couple 

 of years ago and Id thought Kumar Sangakkara would 

 be the next captain... Atapattu always gave the impression 

 that captaincy weighed him down and, if thats so, 

 then the captaincy shouldnt go to somebody who responds 

 that way...I think it was Sanjay Manjrekar who first told 

 me that the man to watch out for is Mahela... He was right, 

 for Ive been very impressed with his captaincy. Mahela 

 is intelligent and positive and will serve Sri Lanka well.

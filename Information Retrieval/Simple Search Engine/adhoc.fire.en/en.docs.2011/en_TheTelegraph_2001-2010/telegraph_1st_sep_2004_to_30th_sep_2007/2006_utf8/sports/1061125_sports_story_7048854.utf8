 Zaheer: A win needed to 

 turn things around

 It is raining in Cape Town, too

Cape Town: Zaheer Khan on Friday defended his batting colleagues against scathing criticism of their performance in the second one-dayer against South Africa and said the team was one victory away from rediscovering its winning momentum. 

Zaheer, who has made a strong comeback after being sidelined for eight months, rebutted charges that Indias batsmen frequently let the bowlers down when playing abroad. 

I dont think so. Our batsmen have had good outings in foreign conditions. Even in South Africa last time around, Virender Sehwag had got a brilliant hundred in his debut Test. It would take just a win for us to turn things around, said Zaheer after the indoor nets at the University of Cape Town. 

The 28-year-old pacer, who picked two for 53 in Durban on Wednesday, put his satisfactory return to international cricket down to his perseverance and unwavering faith. 

I have made a comeback through my perseverance and also because I never lost faith in my ability. I knew that the road to comeback was a hard one but I was prepared for it. Now that I have made an acceptable return, I intend to do better in the rest of the tour. 

Zaheer also left it to the team management to decide whether he should bowl with the new ball or come in as first-change. I am comfortable either way, he said. 

Meanwhile, rain continued to chase the Indians. When they did have some practice in Cape Town, it was still the indoor-type and not the outdoor variety which captain Rahul Dravid has yearned so much for on this tour.Indians left their hotel for the Newlands Cricket Ground amidst heavy showers on Friday morning, and on arrival there, found that the indoor facilities at the venue were not adequate. 

A visit to the University of Cape Town was then hastily arranged where mostly the focus was on improving the reflexes of the batsmen.

Calcutta: Dr Vece Paes was pleasantly surprised by Leanders US Open triumph, not Mahesh Bhupathi. 

I definitely thought Leander and Martin (Damm) had it in them to win a Slam They came so close at the Australian Open, then they made the semis at Wimbledon, Bhupathi told The Telegraph from Beijing where he will be playing the China Open with Mario Ancic. 

Leander, especially, has been playing some really good tennis this year. Whats amazing is Martin winning his first Grand Slam after 15 years on the circuit. 

The senior Paes missed live tennis action as he is in Kuala Lumpur on an Asian Cricket Council assignment. 

They had a good Australian Open and Wimbledon, but I was still pleasantly surprised to see them going the full distance in New York, said Dr Paes. 

Leander and Martin are fit but both are in their mid-thirties. Also, they havent been able to play as many tournaments as they would have liked to. Leander had to visit Mumbai from time to time to be with his young daughter, while Martin was busy with his new house back home. So all the more credit to them for pulling it off, he explained. 

Five-month-old Aiyana, who has a passport which says age zero, has been travelling with her parents to all Grand Slams. She was at the stadium for a few minutes with mother Rhea Pillai on Saturday as well, before being taken back to the hotel by her nanny. 

Aiyanas brief presence at the Armstrong Stadium must have encouraged her dad to give off that extra bit. 

It was Paes fourth Grand Slam title, but the first one without Bhupathi. In fact, it was way back in 2001 that the then-famous Indian Express won the last of their three majors, at Roland Garros. 

Any regrets, on days like these, for not having stuck it out with a fellow-Indian with whom he once ruled the world of mens doubles? 

No, not really, Bhupathi said. We could have won some more Slams together, we may not also have won. And anyway, its not that we havent triumphed with other partners. I won with Max (Mirnyi), now Leander has done with Martin. 

Bhupathi, the most successful member in Indias Grand Slam Club, has had a lean season after the Australian Open mixed conquest with Martina Hingis. Wont Paes latest success spur him on next season? 

 I dont think it will give me any extra 

 motivation, said Bhupathi. I still love playing, 

 I think Ill be on the circuit doing my stuff next 

 year after taking it easy this time. I had kind of relaxed 

 after reaching my goal of 10 Slam titles at the Australian.

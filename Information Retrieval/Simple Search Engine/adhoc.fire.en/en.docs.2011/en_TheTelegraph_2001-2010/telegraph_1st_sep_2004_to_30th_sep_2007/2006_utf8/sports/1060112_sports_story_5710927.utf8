The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ranadeb trips Railways

 - Arindam (65 n.o.), Avishek (55) add 105 for 2nd wkt 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal survived an injury scare when Rohan Gavaskar was hit just below the right ear in the final session but their fate still hung in the balance after the second day. 

After restricting Railways to 259 at the stroke of lunch, Arindam Das and Avishek Jhujhunwala did well to reach 169 for two. If Bengal manage a sizeable lead on the third day, they can harbour hopes of full points from this game. Railways have hardly done justice to their reputation this season and it wont surprise if they collapse under pressure. 

Bengals semi-final hopes, however, will hinge on the outcome of the Tamil Nadu-Delhi and Gujarat-Karnataka matches. Railways hopes were dashed in the morning when Ranadeb Bose claimed four of the remaining five wickets. The pacer utilised the conditions and showed discipline and penetration in running through the lower order. He finished with figures of five for 55. 

I havent been among wickets in the past few matches. I was planning something but the execution wasnt perfect. My confidence was also on the slide but I knew it would happen. I focused on the basics and got my rhythm right this morning, a satisfied Ranadeb said later. 

Ranadeb agreed the conditions did help in his endeavour. Now weve got to aim for a big lead as early as possible. We need to bat steadily and take things from there. 

Yere Goud, who scored 47, provided the only resistance but he lacked adequate support. The lower-order just failed to come to terms with the moving ball. 

Bengals start wasnt very encouraging as Subhamoy Das failed again. But Arindam (65 batting) and Jhunjhunwala (55) held fort. The pair added 105 runs for the second wicket. 

Arindams 262 minute stay at the wicket included 10 boundaries. He showed good composure and responsibility in holding the innings together. There were some good drives on the off side and he exposed the inadequacies in the rival bowling. 

Jai Prakash Yadav and Harvinder Singh hardly looked intimidating and Murali Kartik and Kulamani Parida werent impressive either. No surprise that none of the bowlers made any impact. 

Jhunjhunwala, playing in only his third Ranji match, impressed with his ability to adjust to the situation. Showing no signs of nerves, he tackled the more experienced bowlers with authority. 

Rohan had a precarious 54-minute stay at the wicket, but the bowlers can hardly claim any credit for that. The former Bengal captain was shaky and compounded his problems by failing to get to the line of the deliveries. 

If Bengal want to dictate the terms, they have to score fast and make Railways bat for a few overs on the third day on Thursday.

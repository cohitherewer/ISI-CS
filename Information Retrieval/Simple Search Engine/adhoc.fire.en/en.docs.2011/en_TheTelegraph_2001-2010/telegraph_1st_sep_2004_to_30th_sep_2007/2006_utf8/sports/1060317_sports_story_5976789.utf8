 Time for middle order to perform, says Yuvraj

Mumbai: Yuvraj Singh admitted on Thursday that the Indian middle orders indifferent form in the series so far is a cause of worry, but promised a better performance in the final Test beginning here on Saturday. 

Obviously when the middle order is not scoring runs, its a bit of a worry. But Irfan (Pathan) and Rahul (Dravid) batted really well in Mohali. But its time for the middle order to perform, he told newsmen at the Wankhede Stadium. 

Asked whether the five-bowler formula put pressure on frontline batsmen, Yuvraj said: Obviously theres a thought at the back of the mind that there are only five batsmen. But theres also the fact that Irfan can bat and (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni is playing as a batsman? so you can play your normal game, said Yuvraj, who missed the first Test in Nagpur because of a hamstring injury suffered at the fag end of the Pakistan tour. 

Yuvraj said the team was constantly trying to improve on playing the short-pitched deliveries, as was shown by Virender Sehwag in the second innings of the Mohali Test. 

A lot of players from a lot of teams get out to short balls. Sehwag got out to one such in the first innings in Mohali and then played a brilliant knock in the second. Thats the way the game goes. 

(Andrew) Flintoff and (Steve) Harmison get a lot of bounce on any wicket. We are obviously working towards it, he said, adding that England will miss Harmison in the final Test. 

The left-hander was all praise for Munaf Patel, who made a memorable debut in Mohali. Last year Munaf started off well (in domestic cricket) and came with a bang. He had a few injuries but from what I see now, hes come back and started bowling a very good line. I think hes matured as a bowler and would do well in the coming days. 

Yuvraj welcomed the team managements move to seek the help of former India Test player Yajurvindra Singh, who was a close-in expert, to give tips to those in Team India who specialise in this area. 

It was good to have Mr Sunny (Yajurvindras nickname) Singh who holds the record for most number of catches in a Test innings. He told us of his experience as a close-in fielder and gave us tips on close-in catching, Yuvraj said. 

Yuvraj was effusive in praising skipper Dravid and said it was a great feeling to share the dressing room with the Bangalore stalwart who is poised to become the sixth Indian to play 100 Tests. 

Its a great contribution by any player to Indian cricket. Its a big achievement, Yuvraj said. Hes shown tremendous commitment and discipline. The way he sets an example on the field for all the boys is admirable. Its a great feeling to share the dressing room with him.

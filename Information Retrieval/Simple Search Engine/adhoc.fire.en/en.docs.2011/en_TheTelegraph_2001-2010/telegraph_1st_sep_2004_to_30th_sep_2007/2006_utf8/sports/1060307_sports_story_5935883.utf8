The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 PK, Nayeemuddin likely to retain posts by default

JAYDEEP BASU

New Delhi: Some of the senior members of the AIFF executive committee are anything but happy with the functioning of chief coach Syed Nayeemuddin and P.K. Banerjee and would have the coaching staff totally overhauled if they had their way. 

But when it comes to crunch time ? at Wednesdays meeting in the capital to review the national teams performance in the Asian Cup qualifiers ? these gentlemen are unlikely to speak their mind and thus go against AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshis wish. 

The AIFF chief, who is known to take decisions according to his own whims and fancies, seems to be in no mood to effect a change under the pretext that no better coach is available right now. 

After all, it was Das Munshi who initiated the appointment of Nayeemuddin and PK. Removing the duo would be like admitting a mistake. 

So, despite there being widespread resentment against them, both Nayeemuddin and PK are likely to continue ? more by default than by merit. 

Speaking to The Telegraph, some of the senior AIFF officials expressed their reservations over the recent performance of the national team. 

AIFF treasurer Shivanand Salgaocar, who also runs Salgaocar Club, said Indias performance was simply dismal. I am not sure whether the coach should be changed, but a review of the strategy and tactics of the present team management is highly necessary. It cannot go on like this. 

The strongest comment came from Subrata Dutta. The AIFF vice-president made it clear that Nayeemuddins appointment was wrong. He shouldnt have been appointed in the first place. Its time we looked for a qualified foreign coach, who can guide our football in a modern way. 

It is a well-known fact that another vice-president, C.R. Vishwanathan ? who is also the chairman of the technical committee ? was against Nayeemuddins appointment and issued his note of dissent when a four-member committee chose the Calcutta-based coach. 

Another technical committee member, Pradeep Chowdhury, said he was not sure whether available Indian coaches can deliver the goods. 

I will not comment on Nayeems removal since it could be a knee-jerk reaction. After all, we missed quite a few of our first XI players against Yemen in Delhi. But things can really improve under a foreign coach only. 

The seniormost AIFF member, the 81-year-old S.R. Dev, sounded bitter. The defeat against Yemen was simply horrible. The federation, I believe, has spent a fortune on the teams preparation. The team management was given best of facilities. Yet they failed miserably. Its a shame.

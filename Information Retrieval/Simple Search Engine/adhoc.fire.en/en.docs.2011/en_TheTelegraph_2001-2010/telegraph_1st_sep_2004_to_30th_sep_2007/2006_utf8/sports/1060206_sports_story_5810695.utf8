 AIFF cancels 2 Fransa matches

Margao: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) cancelled the Fransa Pax ties against Sporting Clube de Goa, and Salgaocar, scheduled to be held on Monday and Thursday, respectively, in the ongoing ONGC National Football League at Nehru Stadium, Fatorda. 

This was announced on Sunday by Goa Football Association (GFA), secretary Savio Messias. 

With the AIFFs refusal of Fransas demand to reschedule their matches, pending the disciplinary committee decision on their protest against referee Vikramjits dubious decision in awarding two penalties against Mahindra United match on January 30, Fransa refused to play against Air India on February 3.

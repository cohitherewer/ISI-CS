 ICC warns Board, Inzy over unnecessary comments

 - Disciplinary hearing in London on September 27, 28: PCB sources 

 Inzamam-ul-Haq

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have been warned to stop making public comments about the disciplinary hearing scheduled to take place later this month. 

International Cricket Council (ICC) chief executive Malcolm Speed said anyone commenting on the ball-tampering hearing could face charges. 

I have been very disappointed by some of the public comments that have been made by members of the PCB, team management and captain Inzamam following The Oval Test, Speed said in a statement on Monday. 

These (are) unnecessary and inappropriate public comments from the PCB, much of which could be seen as prejudicial to the pending Code of Conduct hearing, he said. 

Speed said he had raised the matter twice in the past 10 days with PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and had asked ICC Match Referee Mike Procter to do the same with the Pakistan captain and team management. 

The acute international diplomatic and political sensitivity of this issue has persuaded me not to lay a charge to date but, despite the exceptional circumstances, I will not hesitate to lay a charge should further inappropriate public comments be made ahead of the hearing, he said. 

Inzamam faces charges of ball-tampering and bringing the game into disrepute after a public row with Australian umpire Darrell Hair. 

The Pakistan team had been penalised for alleged ball-tampering during the fourth day of the final Test against England at The Oval last month. Pakistan refused to carry on playing after tea after Hair and fellow umpire Billy Doctrove decided to change the ball and penalise them five runs. 

Though the ICC release said that details of the hearings timing and venue will be announced in due course, PCB sources said on Monday the hearing will take place in London on September 27 and 28. 

According to them, ICC officials had conveyed to them the dates in course of discussions on whether Inzamam could be picked in the Champions Trophy squad pending the hearing. 

ICC has disclosed that Inzamams hearing will take place on September 27 and 28 in London under the supervision of adjudicator Ranjan Madugalle, they said. 

The Pakistani selectors are due to announce their Champions Trophy squad on Thursday as per ICC regulations but remain uncertain over Inzamam because of the hearing. 

ICC laws do not allow teams to replace a player who has been banned. 

We are waiting for a guideline from ICC on Inzamam. But even if he is banned later on we do have the option of filing an appeal during which period he can continue to play, the sources said.

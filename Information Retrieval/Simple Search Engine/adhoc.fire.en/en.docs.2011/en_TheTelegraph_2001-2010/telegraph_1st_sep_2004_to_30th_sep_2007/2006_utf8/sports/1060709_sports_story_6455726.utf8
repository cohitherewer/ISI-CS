The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 My heart says 

 Italy, head says France

 GUEST COLUMN - Kapil 

 Dev

 The World Cup final will be all 

 about passion and sentiment. I like Italy because they are 

 such a passionate country. France, however, are the sentimental 

 favourites. I have been surprised by Frances run. 

 After a poor start, they opened up and even knocked out 

 defending champions Brazil, who had the team, the stars, 

 but not the commitment. You dont need big stars to 

 win, what is important is real dedication.

 This is true for cricket, too. 

 Simply put, the more committed team has the better chance 

 to win.

 Look at Portugal. They didnt 

 go to Germany with a hyped reputation and still made the 

 semis. They are not a great team, but showed great team 

 spirit and determination. Just like Sri Lanka, who didnt 

 have big stars but still won the cricket World Cup in 1996.

 I expected Brazil to win this 

 year, too. They had the players to do the job, but the likes 

 of Ronaldinho amp; Co. just didnt jell as a cohesive 

 unit.

 Argentina peaked too early, and 

 got complacent when people started saying they would win 

 the World Cup. They started believing that themselves, and 

 let their guard down. They are an extraordinarily talented 

 bunch, with youngsters who have a very bright future. But 

 they need to mature.

 Germany went into the tournament 

 as one of the favourites, riding patriotic fervour. They 

 are mentally and physically strong, and were playing stronger 

 with every passing match. I was surprised they went out 

 to Italy in the semis in extra-time. I feel they had an 

 eye on the penalty shootout, which is one of their strengths, 

 and relaxed a bit. That was the chink in their armour 

 and Italy seized the opportunity.

 Clearly, Germany paid the price 

 for counting their chickens before they were hatched.

 I felt sad for England. They just 

 forgot how to win. They have everything ? they just lack 

 the killers instinct. Just like in their cricket. 

 Like Brazil, they have the talent, their planning looks 

 good on paper, but they just dont have the winning 

 formula anymore. They need to have somebody to finish the 

 game off.

 As for the coaches, they have 

 disappointed me. Why do they expect the players on the field 

 to keep one eye on the ball and the other on them? I fail 

 to understand how a player can watch his coach, who is sitting 

 on the sidelines, and give 200 per cent in the match he 

 is playing. During my time, I had no time to look at the 

 coach, I was busy giving my all to the game.

 Why do the coaches keep jumping 

 around on the bench? Is it to show the world that they are 

 committed? Jumping around will not change the result. To 

 me, they just look like actors trying to show their involvement!

 A coachs job is to train 

 the players, work on tactics and let his wards concentrate 

 on the field. Surely, they can talk to the players at half-time.

 But back to the final. Despite 

 the match-fixing scandal at home, the Italian players have 

 stayed strong and put the country first. They have managed 

 to block out all the negativity and have come out with flying 

 colours. I have to respect their coach (Marcello Lippi) 

 for saying that he didnt want the scandal to become 

 an excuse for a poor performance or a plus point for having 

 done well.

 Italys defence is solid, 

 but they need to change tactics. They cant just depend 

 on their defence, they have to attack more, create chances 

 and score. Winning the World Cup is about scoring goals.

 They will also have to keep an 

 eye on the wily Zinedine Zidane. He is retiring and will 

 be looking to give himself the biggest farewell on the sports 

 biggest stage. This is what every player of his calibre 

 looks for. Just like Steve Waugh, who signed off with a 

 dogged 80 against India in the Sydney Test (January 2004).

 Win or lose, though, Zidane can 

 be proud of his achievements.

 So, who will have the last laugh? 

 Well, my heart says Italy, my head says France. The 1998 

 champions have the class and a good track record in recent 

 years (five wins in last six matches) against Italy and 

 will be the favourites. 

 Whatever happens, Ill say: 

 Well done, Italy, you have done what people didnt 

 expect.

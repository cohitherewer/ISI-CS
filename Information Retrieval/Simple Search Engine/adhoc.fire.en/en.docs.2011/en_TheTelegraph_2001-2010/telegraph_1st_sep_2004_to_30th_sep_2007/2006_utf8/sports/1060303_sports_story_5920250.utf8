 Collingwood anchors stunning fightback

 - First test Jaffer, Dravid launch strong reply

 Sreesanth celebrates after dismissing Matthew Hoggard in Nagpur on Thursday 

Nagpur: The Zero Miles Stone in Nagpur is theoretically considered as the central point of India. This is the location from which distances to other cities were measured during the days of the British Raj. 

About a kilometre from that place, at the VCA Stadium, Team India under Rahul Dravid on Thursday got to see what was central to Englands stupendous fightback, which gave a different connotation to the first of three Tests for the TVS Cup. Paul Collingwood undoubtedly played the key role, but the tail wagged in a way which had characterised the Michael Vaughan-led teams Ashes triumph last summer. 

It was their fighting spirit which made a mockery of pre-match calculations and assessments. It was a great example of rising to the occasion and making a statement that the hosts shouldnt take anything for granted, even in the absence of Vaughan and Marcus Trescothick. 

So, England under new captain Andrew Flintoff, went on to score 393 from the precarious Day One position of 246 for seven. Collingwood shepherded the tail with a heroic unbeaten 134 (252 balls, 13x4, 4x6). 

India came out with a strong reply ? 136 for the loss of Virender Sehwag at stumps on Day II. Like Collingwood, Jaffer (batting on 73) ? who did national duty the last time in 2002, against the same opponents at Trent Bridge ? looked good for a maiden century. Keeping him company is captain Dravid (40). 

Five of Jaffers 13 hits to the fence were classic legside shots and reminded one of V.V.S. Laxman. Im pleased that hes got those runs and hope he continues doing the good work for his team, Laxman later said of the opener. 

You see, making a comeback always means pressure. Wasim has been consistent in domestic cricket and that has made his task a bit easier, the stylish middle-order bat added. 

Both Jaffer and Dravid looked in good nick and should extend the already 125-strong second-wicket partnership, but the hosts could have been in a stronger position had they seized the momentum while bowling. 

England thus barely survived in the beginning before a fantastic fightback by the lower order. If Collingwood provided the base, Harmison (39 off 42 balls) and Panesar (9 off 64 balls) added to the foundation, showing character. 

When Dravid called for the new ball ? half an hour into the second days play ? and Sreesanth, generating a good amount of lift, ended Matthew Hoggards 52-minute stay at the crease, it appeared that Englands swim against the stream would not last long. But Harmison not only stood up to the challenge, he scuppered Dravids plans by going on the offensive. 

Three smashing boundaries in a row off Sreesanth saw England go past the 300-mark. In association with Collingwood, the Durham pacer put on 60 valuable runs, before Harbhajan beat him in flight. Mahendra Singh Dhoni got the stumping, but replays showed it was off a no ball. 

Harmison passed the baton of fight to Panesar with a pat on the debutants back. Though the latter got off the mark off the very first ball he faced, Collingwood was still 20 runs away from his maiden hundred. But Panesar wanted to make a bold statement and it became obvious in the next over from Anil Kumble. 

As Collingwood pushed the leg-spinners first ball towards backward square, the Luton-born 23-year-old called him for a single. A bit surprising, because facing the Indian leg-spinner means you appear for a seraching examination. But Panesar passed the test with distinction, middling each of the next five balls and making his partner breathe easy at the other end. 

Surprisingly also, Dravid reverted to an all-spin attack after having used Irfan Pathan (three for 92) and Sreesanth (four for 95) for just six overs with the new ball. If it was a strategy, it didnt lead to an immediate result. 

Collingwood easily lofted both spinners over mid-wicket. He lifted Harbhajan for a straight six to reach 99. He came down the pitch again to the next delivery, and as the ball made its journey into the sky, up went his arms ? in rapture and relief. 

It was back to Sreesanth to ultimately halt Englands march, but by then, Collingwood and Panesar had stitched together 66 for the last wicket. 

Soon after the days action got over, a sudden spell of shower lashed the city. According to the local Met office, it will be cloudy on Friday with chances of shower.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Md. Sporting edge past Vasco

 Eric Bolwe Mputu after scoring the deciding goal at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday 

Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting set up a quarter final clash with Mahindra United in the Federation Cup on Monday. 

The black-and-white brigade huffed and puffed before Eric Bolwe Mputu netted in the winner in the 118th minute. Just when everyone was bracing themselves for the tie-breaker, following a listless performance by both teams, came the decider. 

A Jatin Singh Bisht cross was headed goalwards by Bijen Singh and Eric was quick enough to pounce on the rebound from close. 

Vasco SC, coached by former international Shabbir Ali, didnt have the ammunition to put it across Mohammedan Sporting. 

Still, they managed to expose the chinks in their rival defence. First, Joy Ferrao wasted precious time before taking the shot from close, and then Ryan DSouza superb volley from 30 yards was brilliantly tipped over by Arindam Ghosh. Late in the second session, Joy had an open goal in front but hit the crosspiece instead. 

Mohammedan Sporting also had their chances, besides being denied a penalty when a goalbound Saikhom Santa Singh was brought down inside the box by Rovan Pereira. 

Harvinder Singh shot straight to the goalkeeper from handshaking distance, Kulothungan hit over the bar from close and Zamir shot over following a good movement from the left. Just before the winner, Bijen Singhs shot was put out of harms way by Laxmikant Kattimani and Koluthungan, lurking nearby, failed to nod in.

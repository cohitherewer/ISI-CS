 Arjun Atwal tied 89th 

Duluth: Phil Mickelson made the best possible start in his title defence at the BellSouth Classic, moving one stroke clear with a sparkling, course record-equalling nine-under-par 63 in Thursdays opening round. 

The world No. 4, who triumphed after a five-way play-off which included Indias Arjun Atwal at last years tournament, reeled off ten birdies and a bogey at the TPC at Sugarloaf. 

Six birdies in the first seven holes paved the way for a scorching outward nine of five-under 31. He then picked up four more shots after the turn to finish one ahead of Australias Gavin Coles, whose 64 included a holed bunker shot from 189 yards for an eagle-two at the 17th. 

World No. 3 Retief Goosen, the highest-ranked player in the field and winner here in 2002, opened with a 69. 

Atwal sank three birdies on the back nine to keep himself afloat after the first round. The Indian, who was two-over after three holes and four-over after eight, recovered to bring in a card of one-over 73 to lie in tied 89th place. 

Atwal opened with bogeys on second and third and a double bogey on eighth to be four-over at that stage. He rallied on the back nine with birdies on 11th, 13th and 18th to come in at one-over. He needed as many as 32 putts. 

Daniel Chopra also had a one-over 73 and was also in tied 89th. The Swede began with a birdie on the first, but then bogeyed the third, fifth and ninth for a two-over. Birdies on the tenth and 17th helped his cause, but he was put back by a bogey on 16th. (AGENCIES)

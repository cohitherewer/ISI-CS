The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No individual awards for Indians

 - ICC AWARDS 

 Dravid gets Test captaincy; three of his compatriots in ODI XI 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Mahela Jayawardene 

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid got the Test Team of the Year captaincy and three Indians made the ODI XI. Where awards go, though, we drew a blank in edition No. 3 of the annual International Cricket Council (ICC) presentations. 

Last year, too, no Indian took home anything when the awards were held in the lead-up to the inaugural Super Test in Sydney. 

Yet again, its a reflection of the times and Dravid acknowledged that better performances would ensure more nominations and, consequently, the chance of bagging an award or two. Nothing carries more meaning than being adjudged the best by the sports governing body. 

Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene, in fact, was the lone Asian to pocket something a big award, actually on an evening dominated by the Australians. Jayawardene, who arrived on Friday morning itself (with wife Christina), beat top guns Ricky Ponting, Dravid and Michael Vaughan to be named Captain of the Year. 

I dont know how Im going to celebrate... It must first sink in, Jayawardene told The Telegraph at the Taj Lands End, venue of the star-spangled ceremony which had more than a dash of Bollywood. The utterly chic Preity Zinta, for example, handed over a Hyundai Sonatas key to Ponting a bonus for becoming the Player of the Year. 

If the Zintas evoked awe, shock featured in the speeches of many of the award winners. The ODI Player of the Year, Michael Hussey (who edged out Yuvraj Singh), fell in that bracket. 

Earlier, interacting with the Media, even Jayawardene had confessed: Im in shock... Thats why Ive just had a glass of water... An admirer of the World Cup-winning Arjuna Ranatunga, he insisted that a captain was only as good as the team at his disposal. 

Jayawardene, by the way, was also chosen captain of the ODI Team of the Year. The XI includes Ponting, who didnt get the Test captaincy either. 

I dont know how the captains got selected... Youve got to ask some questions... Probably my on-field misdemeanours didnt help... But Ive got two awards, when I wasnt expecting two, and Im quite happy... It has been a great night for Australian players, Ponting remarked, obviously disappointed at not being recognised as a leader. 

Ponting revealed hed expected teammate Shane Warne to be chosen the Test Player of the Year. Warnie took 96 wickets in the period... Its (somewhat of ) a shock that I got it... 

Dravid, who scored over Ponting on the captaincy-scale, said: Just being nominated is great, but Ive got the captaincy (of the Test XI)... Its a huge privilege and it would be easy captaining the team... I would only have to throw the ball at somebody for wickets to be taken... 

Regretting Indias early exit from the Champions Trophy, Dravid added: I dont have the nervousness and tension of playing a final two days from now... Its disappointing... 

Umpire Simon Taufel, meanwhile, authored a memorable hattrick. Such consistency seems unbelievable at a time when we have to contend with somebody like Darrell Hair.

 Kapur at tied 18th

 - Japan Golf 

 Woods moves into lead 

Miyazaki: Shiv Kapur continued his fine performance to card an even par 70 and was placed tied 18th in the star-studded Dunlop Phoenix golf tournament. 

Kapur seemed to have adjusted well and brought home a steady round for a total of even par 140 for 36 holes. 

The Indian once again bogeyed the second hole but this time he made up for that on the par-5 fourth. A series of seven pars was followed by another bogey on 12th, but back-to-back birdies on 13th and 14th brought him under par for the first time in the day. 

A bogey on 15th made him level par again, which is where he stayed till the end. He needed 28 putts for the day and found 61 per cent greens in regulation. 

World No. 1 Tiger Woods once again found himself in the familiar pole position with a five-under 65 that saw him total eight-under 132. 

Woods effort was one shot ahead of European Tour No. 1 Padraig Harrington, who shot a four-under 66. Ian Poulter (66) and Shingo Katayama (70) followed him in next two places. 

Woods started with a birdie but dropped a shot on par-3 third. But an eagle on par-5 fourth set him back on track. 

He birdied eighth, 11th and 13th, before dropping a second bogey on 16th. A closing birdie ensured solo lead for the American at eight-under. 

Overnight leader and the 2000 champion Katayama, who is Japans highest-ranked player, dropped to fourth with two late bogeys on 15th and 17th and with an even par 70 he had a total of five-under 135.

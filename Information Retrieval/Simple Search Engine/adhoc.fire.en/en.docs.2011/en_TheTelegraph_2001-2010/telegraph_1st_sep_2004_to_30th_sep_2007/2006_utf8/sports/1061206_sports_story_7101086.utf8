 China humiliate Baskarans men 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: On Monday, Vasudevan Baskaran said he was not bothered about playing China. The boys are in good form and they are capable of taking care of every team here, the coach had said. 

Well, Baskaran had to eat his words within 24 hours. On Tuesday, at the Al-Rayyan Sports Complex, Indian hockey hit a new low when they went down 2-3 to China 2-3 to jeopardise their chances of making the semis. 

We got many chances but could not convert them, was how Baskaran tried to explain Tuesdays debacle. 

The truth remains that India were well beaten in all departments of the game by the rapidly improving Chinese and were lucky not to concede a few more goals. 

China struck in the 13th minute through Li Hu. Seven minutes later, it was 2-0 for China, Jui Meng being the scorer. Rajpal Singh pulled one back a minute before half-time. 

China made it 3-1 after half-time through captain Songy. Raghuprasad got a consolation goal from a penalty corner. 

Indias fate depends now on the tough match against defending champions South Korea. t is definitely going to be tough, but we have to win that game, Baskaran said.

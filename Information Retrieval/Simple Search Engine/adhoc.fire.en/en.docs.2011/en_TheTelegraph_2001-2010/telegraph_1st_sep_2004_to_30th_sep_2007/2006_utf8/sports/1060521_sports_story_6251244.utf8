 Quick Takes

 Dietmar Hamann retires hurt

 Liverpool: German and 

 Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann has retired from international 

 soccer after being left off Germanys World Cup squad. 

 He played 59 times for Germany and scored five goals. Hamann, 

 32, made his international debut against South Africa in 

 1997 and his last appearance was against The Netherlands 

 in August 2005. He played for Germany at the 2002 World 

 Cup.

 Its not really a big 

 surprise to me I wasnt in the squad, Hamann 

 said. I havent spoken to the manager for the 

 last three months so I didnt think there was much 

 chance of me being included. Thats it for me now at 

 international level.

 We lack team spirit : Zidane

 Madrid: Zinedine Zidane 

 says France need to recover the team spirit of previous 

 years if they are to be successful at the World Cup finals 

 in Germany. We have good players but we lack the virtues 

 of previous sides when we were a united group, all pulling 

 in the same direction. It is coming little by little, 

 Zidane said in an interview on Friday.

 Zidane was a central figure in 

 the France team that won the World Cup on home turf in 1998 

 and the European Championships in 2000. But poor showings 

 in the 2002 World Cup finals in Japan and South Korea, and 

 the European Championships in Portugal two years ago have 

 left their mark on the midfielder. 

 We could do something special 

 but you have to remember we went out of the last two big 

 tournaments without doing anything, he added.

 All 640 tickets sold

 Berlin: All 640 tickets 

 for blind soccer fans at World Cup matches have been sold, 

 Germanys organising committee has said. For the first 

 time at a World Cup, 10 tickets for each of the 64 matches 

 have been reserved for blind fans, who will each be allowed 

 to take an escort into the stadiums for free.

 There will also be two commentators 

 accompanying the groups at each match. Headphones will be 

 made available so that the fans can hear the commentary 

 in one ear and the stadium sounds in the other. The organising 

 committee said English commentators would be available for 

 all England matches. Several Bundesliga teams have had groups 

 of blind fans regularly in their stadiums, such as at Dortmund, 

 Cologne and Hamburg, and said the practice had been successful, 

 the organising committee said.

 The equipment will be left in 

 place at all 12 venues after the World Cup, which runs from 

 June 9 to July 9.

 Pig-less hamlet

 Weggis (Switzerland): If 

 Brazils soccer team succeed in winning a sixth World 

 Cup title in July, the lack of pig smells in a small Swiss 

 village might just have something to do with it.

 The 4,000-inhabitant lakeside 

 resort of Weggis is preparing to welcome Ronaldinho, Kaka 

 and the rest of the Brazilian squad on Monday for the start 

 of a two-week pre-World Cup training camp. Preparations 

 in the village have included the building of a 5,000-seater 

 practice stadium, an indoor training pitch, a gym, a media 

 centre ? and the removal of around 300 pigs from a farm 

 overlooking the stadium.

 Angola land in Hanover

 Hanover: Angola became 

 the third World Cup finalists to arrive in Germany when 

 they landed on Saturday in Hanover near their training base 

 in Celle three weeks before the tournament begins. The squad 

 was welcomed at the Hanover airport by Lower Saxony state 

 interior minister Uwe Schuenemann and other local officials 

 in cool and damp weather before they travelled to Celle.

 Togo were the first of the 32 

 teams to arrive in Germany last Monday followed by Costa 

 Rica on Wednesday.

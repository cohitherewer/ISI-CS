 Pak set up title clash with India

Colombo: A high-voltage final was set up when defending champions Pakistan brushed aside the Australian challenge to book a spot in the title round against archrivals India in the ICC under-19 World Cup. 

The Aussie youngsters were no match for the Pakistanis and went down by 163 runs in the second semi-final at R. Premadasa Stadium here on Friday. 

India have already made it to the final beating England on Wednesday. 

Opting to bat, Pakistan came back from a hopeless position of 80 for five to score 287 for nine before bundling out Australia for a paltry 124 in 32.3 overs. 

A 160-run stand between Riaz Kail (84) and Ali Asad (69) turned the disastrous start into a position of strength for Pakistan, who would try be the first team retain the title. 

Later, off-spinner Usman Malik (3/17) and left-arm spinner Imad Wasims (3/16) ripped apart the Australian batting line-up after Jamshed Ahmed had dismissed two top-order batsmen. 

Usman Khwaja (59) was the lone batsmen to tackle the Pakistani attack while the rest of them caved in. 

Kail and Asad batted superbly and with the tail wagging Pakistan made an impressive 287 for nine as they attempted to become the first side to retain the World Cup. 

Their stand was the highest sixth wicket partnership of the meet and also equalled the best stand for any wicket in the 40 matches played so far. 

Kail hit nine fours during his 99-ball innings while Asads effort included five fours and a towering six in 86 deliveries. 

Adam Ritchard, whose first five overs cost just 17 runs and included the wickets of Ibrahim Mohammed (2) and Nasir Jamshaid (15) was hit for 54 runs in his last five overs.

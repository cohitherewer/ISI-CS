The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ICC may blacklist Guwahati 

London: Guwahati runs the risk of 

 being blacklisted by the International Cricket Council (ICC) 

 which will go through a report by the Match Referee on the 

 crowd violence witnessed after the abandonment of the fifth 

 one-dayer between India and England on Sunday. 

An ICC spokesman said chief executive Malcolm Speed was aware of what happened in Guwahati and would take a decision based on the report of Roshan Mahanama, the Match Referee. 

Mr Speed is aware of what has happened, the spokesman said. 

The Assam Cricket Association could also run into trouble as its secretary had on Sunday blamed the umpires for calling off the match. 

The ICC spokesman, however, said Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) was not entirely at fault for scheduling the match at a venue which only sees international cricket every three or four years. 

India came up with an itinerary and England agreed to play a match in Guwahati. If a board proposes a venue, its up to the visiting countrys board to accept it or not, he said. 

 If the England and Wales 

 Cricket Board had had any doubts about it, they could have 

 sent a security delegation to inspect the ground, 

 he was quoted as saying.

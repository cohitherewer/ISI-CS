Calcutta: Had there not been Hrishikesh Kanitkar at the crease the day would have been longer (for Bengal and the handful spectators) at the Eden Thursday. 

In fact, the penultimate day only suggested that Day Four of the Bengal-Maharashtra Ranji Super League encounter would head towards a dull draw on the lifeless wicket. With both teams wanting to play safe, the Round IV encounter of the Group B, ended on yet another draw of Ranji Trophy, though Bengal (with eight points) climbed to joint top spot with Hyderabad and Punjab. 

But for Kanitkar, there was some stroke-play to keep the scorers and Bengal players busy. Notching his second century at the Eden (unbeaten 151 in 266 balls), the former Maharashtra captain helped his team pile up 308 for four before Sairaj Bahutule decided to declare their innings, giving an improbable winning target of 199 runs from a minimum 13 overs. 

Having received two points through first innings lead, the home team played out time. They ended with 13 from as many overs. 

In fact, it was the second session which provided some excitement. With Kanitkar scoring off fluent cover drives, and flicks en route his century, Bengal players tried out to frustrate him with some verbal volleys. But the Maharashtra batsman did not lose his patience as a flick to the mid-on saw him get his second century of the Ranji season. Perhaps, this frustrated Bengal more and there were more verbal exchanges in the middle. 

The umpires were quick to notice the use of abusive language and cautioned five Bengal players who were later reprimanded officially by Match Referee V. Narayanakutty of Kerala. The concerned players were Deep, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Manoj Tewari, Arindam Das and Amitava Chakraborty. Bengal players were also penalised 10 per cent of their match fee, while the skipper was fined 20 per cent, for slow over rate in their second innings.

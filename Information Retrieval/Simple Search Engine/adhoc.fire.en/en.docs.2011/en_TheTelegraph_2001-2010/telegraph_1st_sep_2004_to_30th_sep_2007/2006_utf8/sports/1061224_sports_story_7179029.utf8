 Ill be less result-oriented on PGA Tour: Jeev Milkha

 - China Open victory the turning point of my career 

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

New Delhi: Winner of four titles on Asian, European and Japan tours in a single year, Indias ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singh said instead of being result-oriented, he would rather approach his goal with more focus and determination on the PGA Tour majors. 

Jeev is eligible to participate in the majors alongside the likes of Tiger Woods in the coming year following his steep climb to the 37th spot in the world golf rankings. 

I will not change my approach. I have been less result-oriented and more routine oriented while starting my campaign this year and will stick to the same approach, Jeev said. 

Its more of a mental game, technique is important but we need to work hard. You need to be focused and determined, said the Chandigarh ace on the sidelines of a felicitation ceremony on Friday night. 

Jeev, who rounded off his season with back-to-back wins on Japan Tour, said his triumph in Volvo Open in China in April was the turning point of his career. 

The victory at the China Open was the turning point as it gave me a lot of trust and confidence that I could win tournaments at this level. 

Really, at the start of the year, I never thought that I would be able to achieve such success, said Jeev, who won the title after almost seven years of winless streak. 

The 35-year-old singled out the win attained in the prestigious Volvo Open Masters at Valderrama, Spain (the traditional end-of-season showpiece of the European Tour) as a special one among the list of honours. 

The victory gained at the Masters in Spain is what I cherish the most of all the titles I have won this year. When one considers the quality of the field and the manner in which I went into the last day as the overnight leader and ended up winning, he said. 

On how demanding it was for a golfer to bring results consistently, Jeev, the first Indian golfer to play on the European Tour, said the unfamiliar courses made it a difficult task. 

Its very difficult for golfers to be consistent because the courses are different and so are the climatic conditions, but we need to adapt and play accordingly. Some courses we can adapt and some we cannot because of these factors. 

Jeev, who was paired with Tiger Woods for the opening two days in the HSBC Championship in Shanghai, said this stint was an enriching experience. 

Playing alongside Woods was the experience of my life. Not only is he the best golfer but also a great human being. The most notable thing about his game that how he forgets his bad shots and comes back strongly, he said.

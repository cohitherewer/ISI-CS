 Yuvraj may be out: Leipus 

 World Cup 

Mumbai: Yuvraj Singh may require knee surgery and could be ruled out of the World Cup in March-April, according to Andrew Lei- pus. 

The 24-year-old, a key middle-order batsman, tore ligaments in his left knee on the eve of the Champions Trophy clash against eventual winners Australia in Mohali on October 29. 

It will be touch and go for the World Cup because of the length of time it takes to recover from such an injury, Leipus, consul- tant physio with the BCCI, said. 

My understanding is he will have to undergo surgery as the torn ligament needs to be reconstructed, Leipus said. 

The injury seems to have sidelined the left-handed batsman for the South Africa tour starting on November 19. 

He has already been ruled out of the one-dayers which will be played first. 

Leipus was Indias physio for five years until 2004 and now works as a consultant.

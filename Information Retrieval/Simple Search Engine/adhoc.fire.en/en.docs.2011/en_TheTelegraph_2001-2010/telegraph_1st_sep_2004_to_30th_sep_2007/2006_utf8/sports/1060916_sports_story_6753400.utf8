 Kuala Lumpur: Sachin Tendulkar 

 was cheerful on the morning-after. 

 The disappointment over India being done in by the 

 Duckworth/Lewis Method, despite his unbeaten 141 (versus 

 the West Indies) on Thursday, wont go away in a hurry, 

 but the personal satisfaction of a great hundred on comeback 

 is going to stay. 

 Asked by The Telegraph 

 whether he was relieved, Sachin replied: There are 

 phases... They keep coming and going... As I said last night, 

 Im happy... 

Meanwhile, Australian captain Ricky Ponting and Glenn McGrath had something to say about Sachin. Here goes: 

 PONTING: Ive always maintained Sachin 

 is the best player Ive played against or seen... Hes 

 back at the top of the order... He has the technique to 

 stand up early and, later, can cause much damage... 

 McGRATH: Throughout my 

 career, Ive egged myself on to bowl to the best 

 Sachin and Brian Lara... Sachins a great and Im 

 looking forward to bowling at him...

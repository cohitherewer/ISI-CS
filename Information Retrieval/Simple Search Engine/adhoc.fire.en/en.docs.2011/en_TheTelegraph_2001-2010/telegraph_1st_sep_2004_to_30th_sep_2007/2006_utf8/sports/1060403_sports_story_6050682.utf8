 Federer retains crown

Miami: Top seed Roger Federer maintained his stranglehold over Croatias Ivan Ljubicic with a 7-6, 7-6, 7-6 win to lift his second straight Miami Masters title on Sunday. 

Victory in two hours, 56 minutes for the Swiss world No. 1 earned him an American tournament double for the second year in a row after back-to-back wins in Indian Wells too. 

It was a very lucky match point (net cord), Federer said. Im extremely happy. To win back-to-back like this is unbelievable. I never thought Id do it again. It really feels great. 

The Swiss, who has now beaten Ljubicic in their last seven ATP meetings, took his 2006 win-loss record to 28-1 ? a run that includes four titles. 

Four of Federers meetings with Ljubicic have come in finals, with the Swiss now 10-3 against Croatias Davis Cup captain. 

Federer, who has now won 28 of his last 30 finals, is unbeaten in Masters Series tournaments since he lost to Richard Gasquet in the Monte Carlo quarter finals last April.

 Barcelona must win

 - Champions League 

London: Holders Barcelona would have expected to be safely installed in the last 16 of the Champions League by now instead of facing an anxious night in Bulgaria knowing anything less than victory could knock them out. 

Frank Rijkaards side find themselves in third place in Group A with five points, having won just one of their four matches so far, and even if they do beat hapless Levski Sofia on Wednesday their fate will not be decided until the final group game when they host Werder Bremen. 

The German club, who have seven points, host leaders Chelsea (10 points) on Wednesday buoyed by the knowledge that the English champions are far less formidable on the road in Europe where they have won just two of their last 10 away games. 

Should Bremen win and Barca drop points it would mean the Catalans having to be content with a humbling place in the second-tier Uefa Cup. 

Bremen, though, are out of form after needing a late Miroslav Klose goal to salvage a 2-2 draw with lowly Alemannia Aachen at the weekend, and they cannot expect any favours from Chelsea, despite what the conspiracy theorists might say. 

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, public enemy No. 1 at the Nou Camp, said his side will go all out for victory, despite a huge Premier League clash with Manchester United next weekend.

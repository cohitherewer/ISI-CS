 Its yet to sink in: Cook

 - If we bowl in the right areas, we are always in with a chance

 57, in Nagpur on Saturday

Nagpur: Thrilled to make the elite few who have scored century on debut, Alastair Cook was in search of a glass of champagne on Saturday. 

Its unbelievable? Im just enjoying the moment and its yet to sink in. May be I will look for a glass of champagne, if there is any in Nagpur, he told reporters after guiding England towards a winning position with an unbeaten 104 in the first Test here at the VCA Stadium. 

The Essex opener, who joined the team here straight from Englands A tour of the West Indies, admitted though that luck favoured him. You need a bit of luck and you got to make most of it. I am lucky it was my day, the 21-year-old said, adding that he was keen to complete the century on Saturday itself. 

Apart from a couple of reprieves, Cook was dropped by Rahul Dravid in the nineties. 

He, however, felt England would go for victory on the final day. Its a fifth day wicket and you never know how it would behave. The wicket has not spun, as we thought it would, but if we bowl in right areas, we are always in with a chance. Well give it our best shot and everybody will be fired up, he maintained. 

Cook, however, maintained that he enjoyed batting with Kevin Pietersen. I was just enjoying the fireworks from him. He took the pressure off me and I could just bat, he pointed out. 

Pietersen made a chancy but aggressive 87 off 110 balls and was associated with a 128-run partnership with the youngster. 

He can do things that I would never be able to do. So I thought its better to watch him from the other hand, he said of the dashing bat. 

Cook pointed out that he was watchful in the beginning and opened up later in the day. 

It was difficult to negotiate (Anil) Kumble bowling into the rough and Harbhajan maintaining a steady line. But our aim was to score at over four an over in the last 10 to 15 overs, he revealed.

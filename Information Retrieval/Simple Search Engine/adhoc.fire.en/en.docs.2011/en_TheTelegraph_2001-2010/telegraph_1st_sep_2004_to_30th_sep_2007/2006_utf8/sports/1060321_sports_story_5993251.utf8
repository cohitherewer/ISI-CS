 Anand gets the better of Svidler

 - MONACO MEET 

Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand played a technical game to beat Grandmaster Peter Svidler of Russia in the second round of the Amber Blindfold and Rapid chess tournament here on Sunday. 

Anand had suffered a shocking 0.5-1.5 loss at the hands of Russian Alexander Morozevich in the first round of this unique annual event. The Indian ace grounded Svidler in the rapid game after settling for a draw in the blindfold. 

Anand had won all the three titles at stake ? rapid, blindfold and combined ? in the last edition of the event. 

Nine rounds remain in the tournament that features one blindfold and one rapid game in each round. 

In the rapid event, Anand shares the top spot along with World Cup winner Levon Aronian of Armenia and world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria, who all have 1.5 points each after the first two rounds. 

In the blindfold, however, Anand is down in the standing list on a shared ninth spot, having just a half point from two games played thus far. 

In the overall standings, Anand is on joint sixth spot behind five leaders ? Aronian, Morozevich, Topalov, Peter Leko of Hungary and Spanish Francisco Vallejo Pons who all have 2.5 points to their credit. 

The upset of the second round was Topalovs loss to Aronian. 

The reigning world champion lost the blindfold game to the Armenian and could only get a draw in the rapid game. 

Earlier in the first round, Topalov had emerged the sole leader with a 2-0 victory over Vassily Ivanchuk of Ukraine. 

Anand was at his clinical best against Svidler. Playing the black side of an anti marshall in the blindfold game, all Anand had to do was exchange pieces at regular intervals to keep the parity. 

The game ended in a draw in a mere 23 moves. 

It was in the rapid game that Svidler got a taste of his own medicine with black pieces. 

Going for a similar variation that Anand had chosen earlier in the day, Svidler was outplayed in the endgame in which Anand came up with an excellent plan to win a piece. 

Svidler called it a day after 53 moves.

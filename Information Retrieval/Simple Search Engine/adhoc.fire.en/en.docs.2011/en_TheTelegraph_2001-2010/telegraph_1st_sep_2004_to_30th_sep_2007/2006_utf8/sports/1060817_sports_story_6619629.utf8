The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It was an even game: Paqueta

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Marcos Paqueta had no reason to be overjoyed with Saudi Arabias showing on a damp Wednesday. And he wasnt. 

Congratulating both teams for doing well in bad conditions, the Brazil-born coach said he wasnt satisfied despite the 3-0 scoreline in the AFC Asian Cup qualifier at Salt Lake Stadium. 

It was an even game, we took our chances in the first half. In the second half, we relaxed a little and were pressured by India Thank God we didnt let in a goal, Paqueta said, via an interpreter. 

We did respect the Indian team, they did very well, the coach said, picking both forwards (Manjit Singh and Bhaichung Bhutia) for special mention. 

On why his team, packed with players who did duty in the World Cup finals, couldnt display a better brand of soccer, Paqueta said the players are not used to a damp and slippery field like the one at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday. 

We knew we would face such conditions and tried to play on wet fields, but that wasnt enough said Paqueta. 

The Brazilian offered another excuse. We had stopped for about 30 days after the World Cup, so the players have not got back match-sharpness. 

Asked if he had an explanation how underdogs India had more attempts on goal than his team, Paqueta said: After being two goals up in 20 minutes, our team wasnt looking to score. We took it a bit easy and the Indians got the chance to attack, creating some chances.

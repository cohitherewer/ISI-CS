 FPAI wants to help Sudip family 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Soon after announcing the formation of Football Players Association of India (FPAI), the Bhaichung Bhutias had pledged to help Sudip Chatterjee. The former India captain didnt give the players body enough time as he passed away following a heart failure on Monday. 

However, the current India captain Bhaichung who is still to get over the shock of Sudips death is finally planning to help the phenomenal central midfielders family. 

Bhaichung, one of the four directors of FPAI, CEO Sumit Mukherjee and Mohun Bagan footballer Basudeb Mondal visited Sudips residence in Howrah on Tuesday. It was just a courtesy visit on behalf of the FPAI. We wanted to help the ailing Sudipda But we werent given enough time for that Bhaichung said. 

The India captain, however, didnt want to go into details about their family to the family. What I can say now that we will try to do it in our very small way, he said, when contacted on his cellphone. 

Bhaichung was all praise for Sudip. I had played under him in Santosh Trophy and I was really touched by the nature of Sudipda, Bhaichung said. Apart from being a great footballer, he was a wonderful person, Bhaichung added. 

Meanwhile, a one-minute silence was observed in Sudips memory before an AIFF emergency meeting in New Delhi.

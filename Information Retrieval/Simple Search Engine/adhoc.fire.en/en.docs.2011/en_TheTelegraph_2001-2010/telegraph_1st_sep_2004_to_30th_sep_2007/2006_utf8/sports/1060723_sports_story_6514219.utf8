 India to face China U-20 today

 - Vancouver meet 

 - Third-place play-off 

Vancouver: India will face the Chinese under-20 side in the third-place playoff at the Vancouver Whitecaps Nations Cup Football Tournament after Cardiff City FC, Wales, blanked the Chinese side 5-0 here. 

Michael Chopra, who recently turned down offers to play for India, proved his worth by scoring a brace in the first 20 minutes while Darren Purse, Pall Parry and Steven Thompson completed the rout on Friday. 

The Welsh side will take on Vancouver Whitecaps FC for the title on Sunday but before that India will face China under-20 to avoid finishing at the bottom of the field. 

Cardiff had 20 shots to Chinas five, while their goalkeeper Mark Howard did not have to make a save. 

Chopra opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he headed in a Neal Ardley cross. 

He was on target again five minutes later when Stephen McPhail cut a ball into the box from the right for Chopra to blast in his second of the game. 

After the hour mark, Steven Thompsons shot from the left edge of the area found the goal via a deflection from Purse. 

In the 85th minute, Parry headed in an Ardley free-kick from near the right corner flag before Thompson completed the scoring with a 25-yard volley two minutes later. 

Chinas best chance came in the 37th minute but midfielder Wang Jiayus free-kick hit the inside of the left post.

 Europe bag 3rd title in row

Straffan: Favourites or underdogs in the Ryder Cup, it doesnt matter to the Europeans. They wanted to win for Darren Clarke and the memory of his wife, for a captain who relied on instincts, for each other. Boasting their best team ever, they backed it up by turning the Ryder Cup into another rout Sunday, winning 18 1/2-9 1/2 to make history as the first European team to win three straight times. 

Theres no question who owns this Ryder Cup the trophy and the tournament. 

Europe won 8 1/2 points from the 12 singles matches the total the Americans needed for an unlikely comeback and the final score matched the largest margin of victory set in 2004 at Oakland Hills. 

Only a gesture of sportsmanship kept Europe, which has won five of the last six Ryder Cups, from the biggest rout by either side since this format began in 1979. J.J. Henry needed to make a 25-foot birdie putt to halve his match, and Paul McGinley conceded the putt. 

Luke Donald holed a 10-foot par putt that gave Europe 14 points, all it needed to keep the shiny gold trophy. Moments later, Henrik Stenson closed out his match to give his team an outright victory, and the celebration was on. 

The tears flowed, too. Clarke wasnt sure he should play in this Ryder Cup after his wife, Heather, died of cancer on August 13. But he agreed to be a captains pick and then won every match he played. (AP)

 Shoaib left out, Asif makes it

 TOUR OF SOUTH AFRICA 

 Islamabad: Pakistan selectors on Friday excluded fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Shabbir Ahmed from a 17-member squad for next months three-Test series in South Africa. 

We have checked the fitness of both fast bowlers and we feel they need some more time before competing in international cricket, one of the selectors, Ehteshamuddin, told reporters. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on November 1 barred Akhtar for two years and fellow fast bowler Mohammed Asif for one year after they tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. 

But an appeals tribunal overturned the decision on December 5 and Asif was included in the squad for the South Africa tour, which also includes uncapped wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider. 

The World Anti-Doping Agency has challenged the decision by Pakistans appeals tribunal in the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland. 

Akhtar competed in Pakistans Twenty20 tournament last week, but his team, Islamabad, were beaten in both group games. Asif represented the winners, Sialkot, in the same competition. 

The selectors have also recalled 30-year-old middle-order batsman Asim Kamal after one year.

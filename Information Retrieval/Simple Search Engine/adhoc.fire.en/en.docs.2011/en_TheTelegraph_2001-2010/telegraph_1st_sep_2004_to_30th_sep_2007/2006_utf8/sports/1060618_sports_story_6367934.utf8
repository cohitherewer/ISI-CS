 Reunion for Kuhn, Pfister

Friegburg: Itll be a reunion of sorts for Switzerland coach Jakob Koebi Kuhn and his Togo counterpart, Otto Pfister, when their teams meet at the World Cup next week. 

Kuhn, 61, and Pfister, 68, go back 40 years, having first met as players in Switzerland. They are also neighbours: the German-born Pfister lives in small town in Switzerland, about 100 kilometers from Kuhns native Zurich. 

We run into each other from time to time, Kuhn said. But knowing the opposing coach wont be an advantage in this case, Kuhn said, because their styles are very different. Pfister spent the last 34 years coaching teams in African and Arab countries, while Kuhn remained in his native Switzerland. 

He is a different type, Kuhn said of his old acquaintance. If you spend half your life in Africa or the Arab world, it leaves an imprint. 

Kuhn is not so familiar with everyone. Most of Switzerland knows him by his nickname Koebi, but Kuhn insists on addressing his young players in a formal way, with the German Sie rather than the more egalitarian Du. 

Kuhn said he strives to treat his players as adults, with respect, and his choice of address seems to be a reflection of that. (AP)

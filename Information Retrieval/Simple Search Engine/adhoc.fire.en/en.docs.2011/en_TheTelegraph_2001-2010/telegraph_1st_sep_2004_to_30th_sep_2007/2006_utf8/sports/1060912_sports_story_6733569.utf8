 Barcelona 

 confident of defending title 

 - CHAMPIONS LEAGUE

 Makelele, Cole expected to play vs Werder Bremen

 Makelele

 London: 

 FC Barcelona begin the defence of their European Champions 

 League title on Tuesday in a confident mood. If only runners-up 

 Arsenal could say the same.

 Barcelona have won both of their 

 Spanish league games so far, scored six goals and has no 

 injury concerns ahead of their match against Bulgarias 

 Levski Sofia at the Camp Nou.

 Its one of eight matches 

 on the opening day of the group stage of the competition. 

 In other matches, Barcelonas Group A rivals Chelsea 

 host Werder Bremen, Inter Milan are at Sporting Lisbon and 

 2005 champions Liverpool travel to PSV Eindhoven.

 Also, its Galatasaray versus 

 Bordeaux, Olympiakos versus Valencia, AS Roma versus Shakhtar 

 Donetsk and Bayern Munich versus Spartak Moscow.

 Arsenal play on Wednesday, travelling 

 to Hamburg. The Gunners have had their worst start ever 

 in the English Premier League, drawing two and losing one.

 It is not a lack of concentration, 

 maybe we are just not quite there yet, Arsenal striker 

 Thierry Henry said. We cannot be disappointed with 

 the way we are playing even though we are not putting the 

 ball in the net, which is the most important thing.

 Also on Wednesday, Manchester 

 United host Celtic, which will be a special match for respective 

 managers Alex Ferguson and Gordon Strachan.

 Ferguson coached Strachan at Scottish 

 club Aberdeen when they won the European Cup Winners 

 Cup in 1983 and later at Manchester United.

 Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard 

 has no injury concerns entering Tuesdays match, which 

 will see the club break with tradition with it sporting 

 an advertisement on the front of its shirts for the first 

 time in a competitive match. Barcelona will promote the 

 United Nations childrens charity Unicef.

 We must respect Levski as 

 a good team with international players. In the Champions 

 League it is always necessary to prepare properly and we 

 will do so for the game, Rijkaard said.

 Chelsea are expected to play Claude 

 Makelele after he was rested for the 2-1 English Premier 

 League win over Charlton on Saturday, while new left-back 

 Ashley Cole also could make his first start for the Blues.

 Chelsea have some inside information 

 on Werder Bremen from midfielder Michael Ballack, who moved 

 to England this season from Bremens fellow German 

 club Bayern Munich.

 They are a team that thinks 

 very offensively, Ballack said. They want to 

 score every game. But sometimes they give chances to the 

 other team and make mistakes in defence.

 Liverpool travel to PSV Eindhoven 

 after losing the 204th Merseyside derby 0-3 to Everton 

 the worst league loss to their crosstown rivals since 1964. 

 John Arne Riise re-injured his left ankle and will miss 

 the PSV match, where the English clubs defence will 

 be under scrutiny.

 We made a lot of mistakes, 

 too many mistakes and our defending was really poor, 

 Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez said.

 Former Liverpool defender Jan 

 Kromkamp likely will start at right back for PSV, who are 

 also expected to debut new acquisition Patrick Kluivert.

 Inter Milan opened the Italian 

 season with a 3-2 win at Fiorentina but coach Roberto Mancini 

 said the players needed more determination and attention 

 in defence.

 Mancini said Esteban Cambiasso, 

 defender Marco Materazzi and Patrick Vieira could be rested 

 against Sporting Lisbon.

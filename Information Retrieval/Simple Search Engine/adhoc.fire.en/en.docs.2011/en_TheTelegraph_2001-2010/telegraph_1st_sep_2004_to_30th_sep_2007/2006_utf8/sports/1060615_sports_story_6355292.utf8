 Seems Henrys time is passing by

THE TIMES, LONDON

 Thierry Henry 

Eight years ago, France triumphed in the World Cup despite having a centre forward named St?phane Guivarch, a player of modest talents. Now they have Thierry Henry, one of the most mesmerising players of all time, and yet hopes of a repeat seem wildly inflated. 

Just how Henry can be a living, breathing genius for Arsenal, all va-va-voom and hip-shaking brilliance, and then a shadow of his true self when in a France shirt is an enduring mystery. 

It is not that Henry has been a crushing disappointment for his country, but Frances last World Cup goal came in the 1998 final and we all know that Henry could do so much more. 

There are two things that France need if they are to have a successful tournament. The first is Zin?dine Zidane must prove that he still has something in the tank other than a bucket-load of emotion and the sort of iconic presence that means there were two films about him at this years Cannes Film Festival. 

The other is Henry needs to show just why he gets a good critical reception everywhere from Highbury to Fratton Park. 

Zidane was unhappily retired last August but answered an SOS call after draws against Israel and Ireland to indulge in a swansong. 

Pushing 34, he is not past it but he is most definitely past his best. 

The next fortnight will reveal whether he has been tainting his genius and deluding his team. Whereas Claude Makeleles limited ambition is geared towards longevity, creativity does not age so well. 

When Zidane spotted the Swiss goalkeeper off his line from all of 45 yards and attempted the sort of shot that only the mad or great would take on ? think Pel? in 1970 ? his effort drifted short and wide, and provoked derisive boos. 

He did flight two deft balls into the channel for Henry to race on to. It is a sight we are all accustomed to and, more often than not, ends with a defender sitting on his backside wishing he had brought a prayer mat. Henry scuffed one tepid shot and rolled another harmlessly across the box. 

This is Henrys last chance to show that he can dominate the greatest stage before he, like Zidane, begins to wane. 

Zidanes time is almost up and this should be Henrys. It is depressing to think that he seems more likely to be a latter-day John Barnes, brilliant for club, mediocre in almost all of his 79 caps. 

Worse still, Guivarch may still have the edge.

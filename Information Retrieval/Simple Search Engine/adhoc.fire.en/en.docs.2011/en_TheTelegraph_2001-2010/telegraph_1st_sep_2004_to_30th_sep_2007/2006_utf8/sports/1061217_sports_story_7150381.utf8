 PCB cool to WADA threat

Karachi: Pakistan has insisted that the case of fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif being exonerated of a doping offence is closed, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) said it would take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). 

WADA chairman Dick Pound said in an interview to the BBC that his organisation would challenge Pakistans decision to lift long-term bans on Shoaib and Asif. 

We have no comment on this. As far as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is concerned the matter is closed, chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf told reporters on Saturday. 

I have already communicated to concerned authorities that all doping policies of member countries of the ICC should be WADA compliant, Ashraf said.

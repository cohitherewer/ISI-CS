 Sania drops to No. 40

New Delhi: The first round loss at the Wimbledon has pushed Sania Mirza, who was the lone Indian woman in the Grand Slam event, two places down to 40th in the latest WTA rankings released on Monday. 

With 501.50 points, the Hyderabadi girl is the fourth highest among Asians who are headed by 19th ranked Ai Sugiyama of Japan and Chinas Na Li (22nd) and Jie Zheng (34th). 

Sania, who made it to the second round of the prestigious tournament last year, fumbled at the first hurdle this time, losing to Russian Elena Dementieva ? who has climbed two steps to be ranked sixth. 

Dementieva also had a hand in the 19-year old Indians defeat in the doubles event. 

Sania and Michaella Krajicek of The Netherlands were knocked out by Dementieva and Flavia Pennetta of Italy in the second round, but, that did not affect the Indian teenagers doubles ranking as she managed to hang on to her 33rd position. 

New Wimbledon womens champion Amelie Mauresmo of France bolstered her top ranking by reaching to 3692 points, a healthy lead over Belgians second ranked Kim Clijsters (3377) and third-ranked Justine Henin-Hardenne (3093). 

Meanwhile, Indias doubles specialist Leander Paes, with 2505 points, retained his ranking at the 14th spot. 

Mahesh Bhupathis ranking remained unchanged too as the Bangalorean remained at 24th spot with 1755 points.

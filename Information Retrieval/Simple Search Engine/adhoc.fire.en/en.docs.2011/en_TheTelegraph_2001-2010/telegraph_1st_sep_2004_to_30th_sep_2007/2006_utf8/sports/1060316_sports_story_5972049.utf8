 The difference was Kumble: Pietersen

Mumbai: Middle-order batsman Kevin Pietersen said on Wednesday that Englands superb display in winning the Ashes series last year cannot be brushed aside after their defeat in Mohali. 

I dont think so. Here we are missing four key players and still have done well against India, the flamboyant batsman said. 

England are without the services of captain Michael Vaughan, deputy Marcus Trescothick, fast bowler Simon Jones and spinner Ashley Giles. 

Pietersen gave full marks to Anil Kumble for Indias victory in Mohali and said that he would play the leg-spinner with a positively defensive approach without changing his aggressive batting style. 

Kumble is a great bowler as his 500 wickets show. I have to play him with a big forward stride and be more positively defensive in my approach, Pietersen said. 

Munaf bowled really good spells. Any bowler who swings the ball at 140 kmph is going to be difficult to face. But the difference was Kumble and the pressure he kept constantly on the batsmen, the South Africa-born hard-hitting batsman said. (PTI)

 Sampras to play World Team Tennis 

 - Dont call it a comeback, says ex-No. 1 

 Sampras just wants to have some fun 

London: Pete Sampras will compete in the World Team Tennis Pro League this season more than three years after retiring, but has ruled out a comeback at the top level. 

The timing is right, the 34-year-old Sampras said in a WTT news release on Tuesday. Ive been busy with my family and enjoying retirement but this feels like the right time to get back on the court and play World Team Tennis. 

The former world No. 1, who retired after winning the 2002 US Open final against American compatriot Andre Agassi in his last professional match, will be making his Pro League debut. 

Sampras won 64 singles titles, including 14 Grand Slams, and over $43 million in prize money during his 15-year career. 

Pete is a great champion and fans have really missed his talent and character since he retired, said WTT chief executive/commissioner Ilana Kloss. His WTT matches will be the hottest ticket in tennis this summer. 

However, Sampras made it clear his return to competitive tennis did not mean he was considering a comeback. 

I miss playing the game. I miss the majors. I miss competing. But to play at the level I used to play is a whole other animal. Ive done that, and I know what it takes, Sampras was quoted as saying on Tuesday. Me playing a little tennis this year is something I can control. There isnt any pressure. I can relax and have a little fun. Coming back is not something that crossed my mind. 

The WTT Pro League consists of 12 teams and past players include Agassi, Bjorn Borg, Jimmy Connors, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Andy Roddick and Venus Williams. 

The league, created by Billie Jean and then husband Larry King, ran for five years from 1974. After a two-year break it returned in 1981 and has since been a feature of the US calendar. 

Sampras, who won the Wimbledon mens singles crown seven times, is expected to play about half a dozen matches during the WTT competitions July 6-26 regular season. 

World Team Tennis gives me an opportunity to play singles, doubles and mixed doubles and thats something I didnt get to do during my career, Sampras said. 

His team and match schedule will be decided at the WTT Player Draft scheduled for March 28 in Miami. 

The top two teams from the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference play in the finals from July 28-30. (Reuters)

OUR LEGAL REPORTER

Calcutta: Jagmohan Dalmiya, former president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Tuesday filed a petition before the city civil court challenging the notice of the BCCI asking him to appear before its disciplinary committee on Wednesday in New Delhi. 

According to civil court sources, the matter will be heard by P.K. Sarkar, judge-in-chief, on Wednesday morning. 

The same judge on Monday appointed S.K. Fouzdar as observer to oversee the election process at the Cricket Association of Bengal, scheduled for Sunday. 

That Dalmiya would be summoned to appear before the disciplinary committee was confirmed by the BCCI last Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah, when contacted on his cellphone on Tuesday, said: Ive received a letter from my lawyers about the petition filed in the Calcutta court and so, I dont know whether tomorrows meeting is on. Ill come to know about it only in the morning.

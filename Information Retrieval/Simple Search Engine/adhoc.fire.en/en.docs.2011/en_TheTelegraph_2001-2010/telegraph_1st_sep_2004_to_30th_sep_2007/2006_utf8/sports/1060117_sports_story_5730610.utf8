The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Aggression and calmness a must

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE 

Id be scared facing Wasim at nets... Imagine how the opposition felt: Waqar 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Waqar Younis

Lahore: Having finished his career with 373 wickets in Tests and 416 in ODIs, former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis is assured of a place in crickets Hall of Fame. Currently doing TV commentary, the 36-year-old spoke to The Telegraph on Monday afternoon. 

The following are excerpts

On the qualities he looks for in emerging fast 

bowlers

Aggression coupled with calmness... 

A quick doesnt have to say anything, but he must have that eye contact with 

the batsman... Youve got to make him realise you mean business, that youre 

out to get him... Sadly, nowadays, except Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee nobody engages 

in that eye contact... Of course, Allan Donald used to... Then, a quick should 

also be calm... Unless that calmness is there, the thinking process will get affected. 

A bowler has to think on two fronts ? about his own bowling and, then, anticipating 

what the batsman is thinking about. (After a pause) Another quality for 

me is the hunger to succeed... The willingness to give everything.

On whether the aggression can be put on

 Must come naturally, but theres 

definitely an element of acting in cricket. Remember, cricketers get prime time 

coverage! Show business bhi to hai...

On why, nowadays, theres a dearth of genuinely 

quick bowlers

 This has been so for a decade... 

Most are either seamers or those who rely on swing... Theyre happy bowling 

spells of five or six overs without giving away much. But, surely, bowlers have 

to get wickets... My feeling is that most of the present-day new ball bowlers 

probably preserve themselves because of the money thats at stake... If they 

break down, then... Look at your own bowlers, they used to be 140 kmph-plus, but 

are now in the 130s...

On being acknowledged as one of the finest exponents 

of reverse swing

 (Laughs) For the lay man, its 

the swing which goes against what the text book says... If the right side is shiny, 

then the ball is supposed to move away from the batsman... When it does the opposite, 

thats reverse swing... I dont know the scientific explanation, but 

its the old ball which reverses... Fortunately, I had a nice action and 

that helped getting the ball to reverse... A slinging action makes a big difference, 

but most have a high-arm one... Wasim Akram was an exception, but he was one of 

a kind... Being in the same team, I would be scared facing him at nets... Imagine 

how the opposition felt...

On his top five fast bowlers

 Thats a difficult question... 

I cant pick less than six and they are (alphabetically):

WASIM AKRAM: Tops in quality, had all the variations 

and could bowl the whole day. His hunger never ended... Would rarely be off target 

and, as Ive said, left the batsmen scared. In fact, Wasim was getting the 

ball to reverse even before I learnt it...

MICHAEL HOLDING: Truly the Rolls Royce among quicks... 

He was so smooth that, at times, even the umpire didnt know hed gone 

past... He was light on his feet and had his brand of aggression which added value 

to the line and length he maintained. Mike stood out despite being surrounded 

by extraordinary bowlers ? Andy Roberts, Joel Garner...

IMRAN KHAN: My idol... Imran learnt from experience... 

Changed his action and quickly became a match-winner... He was hugely successful 

with those big in-swingers when, generally, its held that batsmen have problems 

with the away-going deliveries. That I made my debut under him was an absolute 

dream come true.

DENNIS LILLEE: In my opinion, with time, he improved 

the most... Dennis was one of my heroes and that lovely action of his was worth 

going miles to watch. His USP, though, was the aggression... He was the ultimate 

and inspired a generation of fast bowlers... He wasnt a line and length 

bowler, but so what? The enjoyment he gave was compensation enough... The way 

he came back from injuries is testimony to his mental strength and a lesson for 

emerging quicks.

MALCOLM MARSHALL: Very different to Holding, but 

a class act... He would even bowl with half spikes... He touched high speeds with 

that open-chested action of his, despite conventional wisdom suggesting its 

tough to be really quick that way... Malcolm had all the qualities and, really, 

was smart. Indeed, he was effective in Pakistan as well, which alone says much. 

I remember he had a great spell in a Test in Faisalabad...

GLENN McGRATH: Has never been the quickest, but 

nobody has been more effective in recent years... Has the ability to land all 

six balls in one over within a radius of six inches... If thats not remarkable, 

I wouldnt know what is... Given his consistency in the corridor of uncertainty, 

hes more a machine. Glenn has been fantastic in the ODIs, too.

On the Shoaib-Lee rivalry

 Shoaibs the fastest, theres 

no doubt... The rivalry is good for the game...

On Shoaib

 He wasted at least three years by 

not being focused... He has changed, now, but the time lost cant ever be 

got back... He had problems with the Board, didnt get along with the captains... 

He has an excellent slower ball ? which is a nice weapon to have ? and is going 

to do well as long as he stays focused. If I may add, you need to be quick to 

be effective with the slower one.

On Irfan Pathan

 Has lost speed and that could be 

because of the grip hes using... He never had threatening pace and, now, 

its even less... Hes dependent on swing and helpful conditions... 

I hope his batting isnt taking something away from his bowling.

On whether theres one fast bowler, anywhere, 

who is high on potential

 I cant, frankly, think of 

anybody.

On the one batsman who made him sweat

 Many at different times... If Ive 

got to name one, it will be Brian Lara ? he hit even good balls for boundaries... 

(After a pause) I didnt play much against Sachin Tendulkar...

On preventing injuries

 If the body has a weak area, injuries 

cant be avoided. Whats possible is to strengthen that area... Today, 

the cricketers head for the gym rather than running and running. The legs need 

to be strong and, for that, youve got to run for miles. Perhaps, I did a 

million rounds of the Gaddafi.

Finally, his message for aspiring quicks

 (Grins) If you want to bowl quick, 

remain a quick bowler... Also, dont be scared of injuries?

 Cause is important: Dravid

 - Confident Sreesanth looking forward to ties vs Pak in Abu Dhabi 

Mumbai: Team India captain Rahul Dravid said that the cause for which the two ODIs would be played in Abu Dhabi was important before the teams departure for the desert city on Sunday. 

He was, of course, referring to the matches being organised largely to raise funds for the victims of the devastating earthquake that rocked the subcontinent in October last year. 

The 15-member Indian squad left Mumbai in the morning. The one-dayers against Pakistan will be played on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

Meanwhile, Sreesanth whose six wickets earned him the Man of the Match against England in Indore Saturday, thinks that the Pakistan tour earlier this year has boosted his confidence and transformed him as a bowler. 

It (Pak tour) has given me a lot of confidence. After the Pakistan tour, I started taking things differently, Sreesanth said. 

Sreesanth played a key role in Indias victory over Pakistan in the final one-dayer in Karachi. He picked up four wickets for 58 to help India clinch the series 4-1. 

It has helped me. Now I am really looking forward to Abu Dhabi and the two matches, the 23-year-old said. 

Sreesanth said the break he got before Saturdays tie helped him plan out a few things. I was working out some plans when I got rest (in the previous match). Thank god, it worked, he said. 

Opener Robin Uthappa, who impressed one and all in top-scoring for India on his debut Saturday, expressed his happiness to have played a part in the teams victory. 

I am glad I could contribute to the teams success in my first game. Its a great feeling, said the Bangalore-based cricketer. 

Uthappa said he had played with Dravid in only one match (for Karnataka) and it was a great honour to bat with the Indian skipper. I have played only one match with Rahul. But its a great honour to bat along with him. He is the captain of the side. I felt comfortable out there in the middle, Uthappa said. 

The young opener said before going out to bat, Dravid and coach Greg Chappell told him to work hard and play his natural game. 

They didnt say much, except to work hard and play my natural game and play it to the best of my abilities, Uthappa said. 

The winner of the two-match ODI series in Abu Dhabi will take home a sparkling trophy with gold and diamonds engravings on it. The trophy, weighing 45 kg, carved by artisans in the Pink City, has five players engraved at its base wearing India and Pakistan colours. (Agencies)

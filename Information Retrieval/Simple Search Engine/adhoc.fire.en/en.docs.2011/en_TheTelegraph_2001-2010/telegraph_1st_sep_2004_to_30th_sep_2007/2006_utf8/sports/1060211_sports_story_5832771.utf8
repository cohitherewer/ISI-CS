 Diego unhurt in accident 

Buenos Aires: Argentine soccer great Diego Maradona was unhurt when a sports utility vehicle he was travelling in crashed into a telephone booth, local media reports said on Friday. 

Maradona declined to comment on whether he was involved in the crash early Friday when asked by reporters. 

A man described by Cronica TV as a witness to the accident said the vehicle ran a red light and spun out of control before ramming into a telephone booth.

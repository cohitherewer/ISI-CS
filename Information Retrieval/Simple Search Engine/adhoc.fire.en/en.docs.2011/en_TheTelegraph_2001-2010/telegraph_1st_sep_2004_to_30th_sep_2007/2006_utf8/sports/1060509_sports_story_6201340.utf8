 QUICK TAKES

 Shevchenko 

 out for 25 days 

 Rome: AC Milans Ukrainian 

 striker Andriy Shevchenko has been sidelined for 25 days 

 with a knee injury, the Serie A club said on Monday. Shevchenko 

 is the key player for Ukraine in their first World Cup finals 

 campaign which starts with their group H opener against 

 Spain on June 14 and his injury could effect his preparation 

 for the tournament. 

The former European Player of the Year picked up the injury early in Milans 3-2 win over Parma in Serie A on Sunday. Milan said the forward had suffered a sprain and stretching of the medial collateral ligament but ruled out any need for an operation. 

 Shevchenko will miss Milans final game of the 

 season at home to Roma.

 Togos first 

 appearance 

 Frankfurt: Togo will be the first of the 32 World Cup teams to arrive in Germany ? more than three weeks before the tournament begins on June 9. Togo are due to touch down in Germany on May 15, World Cup organisers said on Monday. The squad will have their base camp in Wangen in the south of the country. 

 Hosts Germany will not convene at their base hotel 

 in Berlin until June 4, although the squad will be together 

 for camps in Sardinia and Geneva from May 16. Holders Brazil 

 will also be arriving on June 4, but Ukraine do not arrive 

 until the opening day of the tournament.

 Boot on other foot 

 London: Call it coincidence, but a brochure for the June edition of a football magazine invites readers to win a pair of Wayne Rooneys boots. Which is a little unfortunate since the Nike T90 Supremacy boots have been blamed in some quarters for causing Rooneys metatarsal injury. 

 Still, if you know how old young Wayne will be during 

 the 2006 World Cup, you could win a pair of signed match 

 boots, and watch him training with Man United. Although 

 not for a while, sadly. 

 Kompany called up 

 Brussels: Anderlecht defender Vincent Kompany, out of action with a shoulder injury since January, has been called up for Belgiums friendly against World Cup finalists Saudi Arabia. 

Kompany, who is set to leave the Belgian champions, is included in the 22-man squad for Thursdays game in the Netherlands along with nine uncapped players. 

 Belgium are without first-choice goalkeeper Silvio 

 Proto, who is sidelined until September with a knee injury.

 Blatter still concerned 

 London: Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Monday he was still concerned that German government demands over ticketing security could lead to chaos at the World Cup finals, which start next month. 

The German interior ministry is insisting that all ticket-holders present identification at the stadium to prove they are the same people as those whose names appear on the tickets. 

Talks held between Fifa and the German authorities on Friday failed to resolve the issue and Blatter could not hide his concern when he met a group of British-based reporters in London on Monday. 

 We only have four weeks to resolve this problem, 

 he said. I can only imagine problems with fans queuing 

 up to go in, holding a ticket and unable to get in.

 3 referees dropped 

 Zurich: Referees Kyros Vassaras of Greece, Manuel Mejuto Gonzalez of Spain and Carlos Batres of Guatemala will not officiate at the World Cup finals because of fitness problems, Fifa announced on Monday. 

 Vassaras and Mejuto Gonzalez miss out because although 

 they are fit, some of their assistants have not passed tests 

 so the whole trio has been dropped. Batres has failed to 

 recover from a cruciate knee injury in time. Under new Fifa 

 rules, all three members of the refereeing trio, must have 

 passed fitness tests by last week.

 Faulty logic 

 London: The Germans are going to clamp down heavily on fans at the World Cup who goose-step, give Nazi salutes or, to borrow a Basil Fawlty line, mention the war. Anyone convicted of inciting racial hatred faces a prison term of between two weeks and three years. 

So how come there were T-shirts openly on sale on the streets around Stamford Bridge last week depicting the famous Fawlty jack-booted walk, salute, and finger under the nose? Police officers just walked past. Perhaps racism isnt a crime in London?

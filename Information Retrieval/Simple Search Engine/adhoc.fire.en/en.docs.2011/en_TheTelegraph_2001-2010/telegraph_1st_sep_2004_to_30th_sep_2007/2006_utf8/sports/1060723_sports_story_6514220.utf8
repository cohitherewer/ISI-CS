The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Normalcy returns to RCTC 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Horses 

 will return to the track from Monday, thanks to a give-and-take 

 attitude adopted by trainers and their employees (Syces) 

 at a meeting held on Saturday. It saved the situation for 

 all parties concerned, paving way for resumption of racing 

 from Thursday. Racing had come to a halt since last Friday, 

 following syces cessation of work ? demanding payment 

 of their dues ? variable dearness allowance.

 Trainers Association of Calcutta (TAC), on the other hand, wanted them (syces) to sign the long-pending agreement before clearing their dues.

 Syces will be paid on Tuesday. 

 Other disputes have also been sorted out, said J. 

 Masundrai, general secretary, RCTC Karmachari Union. The 

 Calcutta Racehorse Society president, M.L.Choudhary, and 

 TAC secretary, Javed Khan, too, echoed similar sentiments.They 

 added that the union functionaries have also agreed to sign 

 the agreement by September 30.

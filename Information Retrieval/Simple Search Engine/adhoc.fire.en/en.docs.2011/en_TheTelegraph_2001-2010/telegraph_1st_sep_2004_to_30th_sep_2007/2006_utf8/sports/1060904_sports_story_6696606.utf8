 Davenport enters Round IV

 - Injection and an extra rest day for Agassi 

 Lindsay Davenport in action on Sunday 

New York: Andre Agassi received another anti-inflammatory injection on Saturday and got an extra day to rest before playing in the third round of the US Open, his match postponed because of intermittent rain. 

Lindsay Davenport saved two match points as she squeezed past Slovenian 22nd seed Katarina Srebotnik 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 to reach the fourth round on Sunday. The American 10th seed was well below her best but after saving match points in the 12th game of the third set, snatched the tie-break to clinch victory in just under two hours. 

What started as a light shower in the morning grew heavy by the evening and washed out Saturdays entire schedule at the Flushing Meadow. Ill be all right. I dont need sympathy. Ill be OK, Agassi said with a smile as he prepared to leave for the day. 

Matches involving Andy Roddick and Maria Sharapova also were pushed back to Sunday, when tournament organisers will add a night session in Louis Armstrong Stadium for the first time in a bid to erase the backlog. 

 Five of the tournaments 12 sessions have been cancelled so far, including two entire days Tuesday and Saturday without any matches completed; there hadnt been a single such 24-hour period at the US Open since Day I in 1987. Its been a tough day, but we are one day behind, US Tennis Association executive Arlen Kantarian said. 

Agassi went to a hospital to have a cortisone shot on Tuesday after his first-round victory over Romanias Andrei Pavel; Agassis trainer, Gil Reyes, estimated hes had eight to 10 such injections over the past four years. Agassi had a tournament doctor go to his hotel on Friday to give him anti-inflammatory medicine. 

 Martina Navratilova, who will 

 retire after the Open, spoke on Saturday about leaving the 

 sport when one wants to, rather than being forced to stop 

 because of injury.

 Wrong selection, say ex-players

Mumbai: Former players were united in blaming selection controversies and poor attitude of the players for Indias worst mens hockey performance at an Asian Games. The former champions had to beat South Korea on Sunday, but managed only a draw to finish third in their group behind the Koreans and Chinese. This is the first time India have failed to win a medal in Games history. 

Heres what former players had to say: 

 JOAQUIM CARVALHO: I felt the composition of the team was not right. Many of the selected players, were undeserving and that left the team imbalanced. It is sad to see India not among the top four on a stage they used to dominate. 

 MERVYN FERNANDES: Its very upsetting. After the debacle at the World Cup I expected the team to at least come back hard at the Asian Games. Watching the matches, I felt the team lacked understanding, the attacks werent cohesive We have let go an opportunity to qualify directly for the next Olympics. (Reuters)

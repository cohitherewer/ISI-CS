Calcutta: Mohun Bagan inched closer to sealing the third spot in the 10th National Football League (NFL) after bagging full points against Mohammedan Sporting, via an Eduardo Coelho strike in the 73rd minute, in their crucial ONGC Cup match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. The tussle never rose to a high as both the teams were more concerned about not conceding a goal early in the match. 

A few moves ? by both teams ? which managed to pierce the rival defence, failed to do the needful owing to the forwards lack of application. We had opened a lot of chances, but failed to score. My team doesnt have a leader who can actually make things easier for others, Mohammedan Sporting coach Subhas Bhowmick said at the post match media conference. 

Signs of Mohammedan Sportings ouster from the elite division are looking prominent after the days proceedings. They remained on 14 points from 16 matches and have one match versus Salgaocar remaining. Whoever wins the encounter will join Fransa Pax as the second team to be relegated. 

For Biswajit Bhattacharya amp; Co., Eduardos goal saved them the blushes. When Bhattacharya took charge of the green-and-maroon brigade, they were lurking in the relegation zone with five points. Now after Tuesdays outing, the three-time champions are close to finishing third with 27 points from 16 games. I havent done anything, the players made collecting 22 vital points possible in the second phase, a modest Bhattacharya stated. 

With an exhibition of mispasses and wrong tackling, defenders of both the sides followed the strategy of not letting the opponents possess ball inside the danger zone. 

Eduardo, aptly adjudged the Man-of-the-Match, took the bulk of the workload. He bagged his fourth MoM award, so far being the highest in the competition. 

Just when the match was heading towards a draw, Eduardo disturbed the scoreline by his immaculate header off a Dharamjit Singh free-kick from the left. Without taking away any credit from Eduardos effort, stopper-back Madhab Das and goalkeeper Gopal Das are to be blamed for the disaster. 

Raman Vijayan did manage to put the ball in the net for Mohammedan Sporting, but the goal was cancelled on the pretext of Vijayan pushing Imran Khan. In the dying moments of the match, the green-and-maroons got another chance when a on-on-one between Sushil Singh and Awudu Ibrahim helped them reach the six-yard. However, the move turned futile.

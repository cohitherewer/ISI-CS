 Bronze for Shibaji

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Shibaji Datta claimed bronze at the 20th Golden Racket International table tennis championship in Ho Chi Minh City recently. 

The India No. 5 beat Australian Kiet Tran 4-1 in the first round, before battling past his Thai opponent 4-3. Shibaji then overcame Vietnams Nguyen Nam 4-3, while in the quarter finals he thrashed Ma Liang 4-0. Shibajis run was ended by a Chinese, to whom he lost 1-4. 

Shibaji and Singapores Gao Ning, both losing semi-finalists, were awarded bronze medals. 

I had a good draw. The pre-quarter finals was my toughest test? I was 1-3 down and won the next three games on tie-breaks, Shibaji said after returning home. 

His was by far the best performance by an Indian in the Vietnam meet. Fellow-Calcuttan Sourav Chakraborty lost in Round I, as did Pathik Mehta. G. Jitendra won a round before bowing out. Among women, none went past Round III. 

Shibaji will take a five-day break before joining the national camp in Patiala. The camp (under Swedish coach Benoni Christian Grigore) starts on Sunday, but Ill be joining two days later, said Shibaji.

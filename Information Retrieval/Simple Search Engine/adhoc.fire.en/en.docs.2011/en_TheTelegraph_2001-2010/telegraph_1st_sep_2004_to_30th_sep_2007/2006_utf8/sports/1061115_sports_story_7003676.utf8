 Pollock to rethink Test career 

Durban: South African allrounder Shaun Pollock will rethink his Test career after the series with India so that he could concentrate on the shorter version of the game which beckons him with a unique double of scoring 3,000 runs and taking 300 wickets. 

Pollock, who could join Pakistans Wasim Akram as the only player to have achieved the distinction in ODIs during the series against India, said he enjoyed playing the 50-overs-a-side version and was mindful of the record. I will see how I feel about it after this summers three-Test series, the 33-year-old allrounder said. I enjoy one-day cricket and hope I can still play in this form of the game for a few years more. 

I should have a good, or better, indication of my Test (career) after the series against India and Pakistan. he said. 

Pollock needs 151 more runs to reach the 3,000 mark. He has also taken 354 wickets in this form of the game. Akram took 502 wickets and made 3,717 runs in 365 ODIs. 

Neither has an ODI century, but Akram made six fifties. Pollock, who has made two Test centuries, has scored 11 fifties in ODIs. (PTI)

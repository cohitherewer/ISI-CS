 Dravid has final say on every matter: Chappell

 - I get a lot of credit for things I dont do 

New Delhi: Rahul Dravid has the final say over any decision concerning Team India, according to coach Greg Chappell who believes he gets the credit for even things he is not doing. 

Seeking to dismiss suggestion that he was the be-all and end-all of the Indian cricket team, Chappell also emphatically states that Dravid is the leader in every sense of the word while he is merely one of the support staff. 

On game days he is the leader. Were the support staff. I get a lot of credit for things I dont do. As support staff we come up with ideas and take it to the leadership group, especially the captain. He then considers things. If he doesnt agree with something he says it to me, Chappell said. 

Thats how it should be, because hes the one thats going to wear the wins and losses against his name, not me. If I feel strongly about something, I will take it to him, but he has the final say and I respect that totally because Ive been in that position, the former Australian skipper says. 

Justifying the shake-up he has given to the team, Chappell says, the team needed a catharsis to come out stronger and the risks involved were worth taking. We needed the shake-up... The record in recent times was abysmal...Certain things are not acceptable in my book. I felt very strongly that the team needed a catharsis to come through stronger. 

The risk was necessary and worth taking. The timing of it was never going to be good... In some areas you cannot compromise. You cant say we will cover this problem the best we can and try and get by. 

Chappell also said that Dravid was very much part of the recent strategies that India applied against the opposition, including shuffling the batting order. 

We implemented these strategies because we knew from our experience that that these guys could do what was being asked of them. The odds on these strategies coming off were very high. (PTI)

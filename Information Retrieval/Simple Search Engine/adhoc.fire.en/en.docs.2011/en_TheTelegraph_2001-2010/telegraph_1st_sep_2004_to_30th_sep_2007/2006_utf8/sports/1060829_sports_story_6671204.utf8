Bristol: Pakistan responded to the controversies of the last few days with a five-wicket victory over England in their Twenty20 clash on Monday. 

The tourists, playing their first Twenty20 International, reached 148 for five with 13 balls remaining for a morale-boosting victory here. 

Pakistan have a psychological edge going into Wednesdays five-match one-day series at Cardiff, while England have now lost their last eight limited-overs matches. 

Typically explosive batting from allrounder Shahid Afridi, with 28 from 10 balls, and a steady 46 of 44 from opener Mohammed Hafeez, saw Pakistan home. 

Along with Hafeez, Afridi took 22 from Sajid Mahmoods first over and then 19 from Stuart Broad in the next over. 

It proved a decisive passage of play as England never looked like recovering following Afridis innings, which included five fours and a six. 

Afridi eventually departed to an amazing catch by debutant Michael Yardy, who misjudged a slog over midwicket before diving backwards to take the catch. 

Debutant Broad took two wickets in as many balls, after trapping Shoaib Malik leg before and having Younis Khan caught behind down the leg side first ball. 

Allrounder Abdul Razzaq (17 not out) clinched the match with two straight boundaries off Darren Gough. Skipper Inzamam-ul Haq was 11 not out. 

England, after winning the toss, began their innings solidly through Marcus Trescothick (53) and Ian Bell (14) but slumped from 39 for no loss to 50 for four. 

After Shoaib Akhtar had Bell caught, Mohammed Asif claimed two wickets in three balls and recorded the first maiden ever bowled in a Twenty20 International. 

 BRIEF SCORES 

England 144/7 in 20 ovs (M. Trescothick 53; A. Razzaq 3/30, M. Asif 2/21). Pakistan 148/5 in 17.5 ovs (M. Hafeez 46; S. Broad 2/35). Pakistan won by 5 wkts with 13 balls remaining.

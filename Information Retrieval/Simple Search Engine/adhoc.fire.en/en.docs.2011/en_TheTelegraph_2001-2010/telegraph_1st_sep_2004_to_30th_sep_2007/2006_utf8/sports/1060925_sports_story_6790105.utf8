 Jeev finishes tied eighth

Ibaraki: Jeev Milkha Singh found his touch late with three birdies in last four holes which propelled him to tied eighth at the $120 million ACOM International on Sunday. 

Jeevs final round of two-under 69 saw him finish eight-under 276 and six shots behind winner Mamo Osanai. 

Osanai (68) had to go through a play-off before winning the title over Taichi Teshima, whose final 63 set the clubhouse target for Osanai. It was Osanais third career title on Japan Tour. 

Katsumune Imai (66) and overnight tied second Ryuichi Oda (69) were tied fourth, while Paul Sheehan (65) and Katsuyoshi Tomori (68) were tied sixth. Jeev shared the eighth place with SK Ho (69) and Yoshikazu Haku (70). (PTI)

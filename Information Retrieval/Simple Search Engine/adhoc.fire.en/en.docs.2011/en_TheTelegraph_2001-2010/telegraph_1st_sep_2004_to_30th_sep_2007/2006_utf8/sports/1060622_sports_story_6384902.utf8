 Portugal complete Round I on winning 

 note

 - Victory earns Scolari a Cup record of 10 wins in a row 

 as coach; Mexico also through to knockout stage

Gelsenkirchen: Portugal completed a perfect first round at the World Cup on Wednesday with a 2-1 victory over Mexico in Group D. 

Maniche and Simao Sabrosa scored in the first 25 minutes before Kikin headed in a 29th-minute corner for Mexico, who qualified for the next round as runner-up in the group. 

 Portugal had already advanced to the second round and will do so as group winner. Angola exited after drawing 1-1 with already eliminated Iran. Portugal, already qualified and resting five players on yellow cards, held on after taking a 2-0 lead in the first 24 minutes. 

The Mexicans went down to 10 men in the 61st minute when Luis Perez was sent off for a second yellow card after going down in the box looking for a penalty. 

Mexico had thrown away the chance of an equaliser in the 57th minute when Omar Bravo blasted a penalty into the crowd. 

Portugal took the lead in the sixth minute. Maniche supplied Simao, who made a lovely run on the left flank before returning the ball to Maniche to hammer home. Portugal went two ahead after an inexplicable handball in the box by Mexico captain Rafael Marquez. 

Winger Simao stepped forward to convert it in the 24th minute, stuttering only slightly before hammering the ball past Mexican goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez. 

Mexico pulled one back five minutes later when Fonseca headed home from a Pavel Pardo corner. Fonseca almost equalised six minutes before the interval when his head found an Omar Branco cross but this time the ball went just wide. 

After the break, Mexico kept up the attack with Fonseca, who started instead of Guillermo Franco. 

In the 56th minute, a Pardo cross found Bravo who tapped it to Fonseca, but the shot lacked sufficient power to get past Ricardo. 

A minute later, Mexico had a chance to equalise after Miguel touched the ball with his hand in the box, but Bravos penalty sailed into the crowd. 

Even so, the Portuguese extended their unbeaten run to 17 international games, during which they have conceded just six goals. 

Portugal coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said he gained a major advantage by resting five players on yellow cards. 

We take two benefits from this match, the Brazilian said. Firstly we left five players out. We have protected them from a second yellow and we have them fit for the second round. Then, the players we brought in today are strong-minded and have shown me they can play in the next round. 

Scolari consigned Cristiano Ronaldo, Nuno Valente, Deco, Pauleta and Costinha to the stands, a sensible decision by the experienced coach for a match in which seven yellow cards and a red were flourished. 

In came Sabrosa, Tiago, Armando Petit, Helder Postiga and Marco Caneira. These players showed today they could be in the team on Sunday, said Scolari. 

Portugals win also earned Scolari a World Cup record of 10 successive victories as a coach. 

Ten wins in the World Cup is the kind of thing that would mark anybodys life, especially mine, Scolari said. 

Scolari also led Brazil to seven consecutive wins when they lifted the World Cup in South Korea and Japan four years ago.

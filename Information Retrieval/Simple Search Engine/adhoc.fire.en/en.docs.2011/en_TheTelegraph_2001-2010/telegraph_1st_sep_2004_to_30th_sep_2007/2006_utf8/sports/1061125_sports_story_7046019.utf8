 Eltons zeal goes out like candle in the wind

Brisbane: The England cricket sides woeful start to their ashes defence has prompted pop star Elton John to cancel plans to see his team at the Gabba Test match here, a report said on Friday. 

The singer, a favourite of England captain Andrew Flintoff, had been expected to attend the match as he is in Australia for a concert tour beginning in Brisbane on Sunday. 

But Australian associated press reported Johns cricket plans had been stumped by Englands failure to stop the Australians dominating the first two days. 

It reported sources close to the tour as saying the singers interest in watching the Test had been diluted by Englands poor performance. 

It will be a blow to Flintoff, who performed a duet with John at a charity function in London last may and who is expected to attend the singers concert in Brisbane on Sunday. 

His song Rocket Man became a dressing room anthem for England during last years Ashes win over Australia. (AFP)

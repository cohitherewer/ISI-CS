 Randhawa falls to 115th

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa dropped three places but still managed to remain as the top Indian in the latest world golf rankings. 

Randhawa, who took the week off, found himself at 115th spot, while compatriot Arjun Atwal ? who is playing on the USPGA Tour ? fell five places to 140th. 

Shiv Kapur, who has already qualified for the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool, Hoylake, registered a marginal improvement in his ranking by moving two places up from 145th to 143rd. 

Jeev Milkha Singh, who finished tied 26th with Kapur at the BMW Asian Open in Shanghai, dropped one place to 196th. 

The previous week, he had registered his first win in seven years at the Volvo China Open, which resulted in his huge leap from 319th spot to 195th. 

Tiger Woods continues to lead the charts, ahead of fellow American Phil Mickelson, who claimed his third Major championship at the Augusta National Golf Club this month.

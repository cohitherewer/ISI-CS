BIPIN SHENOY

Solapur: Shoumi Mukharji of Bengal held top seed M. Mahalaxmi of Tamil Nadu in the fourth round of the XXth National U-9 Chess Championships for boys and girls here at the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium Friday. Shoumi went on to win her 5th round game to take her tally to 4.5 points. 

After Round V, Cyrus Pereira of Goa and Akash P.C. Iyer of Tamil Nadu lead the fray with full points in the boys category, while Sweety Patel of Gujarat and B. Pratyusha of Andhra Pradesh share the lead in the girls section. 

Meanwhile, Sayantan Das of Bengal along with Deepika Kuchipudi of Andhra Pradesh and Rahul Raj of Bihar were debarred from playing further in the meet as they were found to be over-aged after medical tests were conducted on them at the local Chatrapati Shivaji Civil Hospital. 

The WBCA organising secretary, when contacted in Calcutta, said: We will ask for all the reports from AICF and then take a decision on Sayantan. 

Earlier, Sayantan took his tally to 4.5 points by winning his Round IV game against J.A. Gireman of Tamil Nadu and split point with Vaibhav Suri of Delhi in the fifth.

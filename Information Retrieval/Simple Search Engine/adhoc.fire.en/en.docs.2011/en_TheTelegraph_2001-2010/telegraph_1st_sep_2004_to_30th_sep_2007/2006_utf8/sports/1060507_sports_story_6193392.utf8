The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Its frustrating, says Lara

 Brian Lara 

Georgetown: Former captain Shivnarine Chanderpaul is praying for the rain to go away this weekend so he can rekindle the love affair with his home ground (Bourda) in the ODI series against Zimbabwe. 

Heavy rains over the past four days has drenched the outfield and on Friday Match Referee Chris Broad was forced to cancel Saturdays match. 

The out-of-form Chanderpaul was keen to regain his touch at a venue which nurtured his game since he was in his early teens. It brings back a lot of good memories. Over the years Ive done pretty well in Bourda, Chanderpaul said. 

Brian Lara also expressed his frustration after the third ODI was abandoned without a ball being bowled. We wanted to get as much as we could get out of this series, the West Indies captain Lara said. That includes preparation, and it includes the actual cricket. These two weeks is a situation where we are getting ourselves ready for greater things. Every possible bit of cricket is necessary, and this in itself is frustrating. 

India are due to play the first of five ODIs against the West Indies in Kingston on May 18, after which they will play four Tests.

Calcutta: Bandh has become a way of life for Calcuttans. Our guests from Mumbai got a feel of this unique spectacle on Thursday. Forced to stay indoors the day before the IFA Shield final against Mohun Bagan, the Mahindra United players had to be content with a stretching session on the hotel terrace. 

We wanted to go to a gym close by, but even that couldnt be arranged Hardly the ideal preparation for a final, rued Mahindra coach Derick Pereira. 

Mahindra players at least did something, vis--vis Fridays final. Mohun Bagan managed zilch, simply because there was no way the players could all assemble at one place. The green-and-maroons warm-up session will be on Friday morning, eight-nine hours before the big game. 

The lack of preparation apart, Eduardo Coelhos possible absence is worrying the Mohun Bagan camp. The Brazilian, a tower of strength in the heart of defence, got into a brawl with Sporting Clube de Goa striker Dudu Omagbemi after Wednesdays semi-final and both got red-carded. 

Mohun Bagan have requested the organisers to let Coelho play the final and the matter will come up for discussion Friday morning. But coach Robson would do well to chalk out strategy without the Brazilian defender (Gautam Debnath is a strong candidate to take his place). If the match commissioner and members of the tournament committee do allow Coelho to play Friday evening, a new controversy would surely erupt. 

If he (Coelho) is allowed to take the field, we would ask the organisers to let us field K. Ajayan, said Pereira. The enterprising wing-back is ruled out of the title-round clash after being cautioned twice in the meet. 

Mahindra have a couple of other worries as well. Both Mahesh Gawli and Shammugam Venkatesh are nursing injuries and Pereira said a decision as to whether they will start the final will be taken only after having a look at their fitness in the morning. 

Even without those three stalwarts, Mahindra have enough ammunition to pose a strong challenge to the local heavyweights. Apart from India players Sandip Nandy, N. Pradeep, N. Manju, Surkumar Singh and Manjit Singh, the reigning NFL and Federation Cup champions have the dangerous Yusif Yakubu in their ranks. 

Mohun Bagan are better than the teams we have faced so far, but we have players with quality and experience to deal with the big challenge, said Pereira. If we can play with the same professional attitude as we did against Shenzen, we can pull it off. 

A thorn in Mahindras flesh could be Barreto, the man who won the Mumbai side many matches last season. Barreto can produce magic anytime, we cant give him any free space to operate in, said Pereira. 

For Mohun Bagan to produce a memorable performance, Barreto needs to fire in tandem with Bhaichung Bhutia. They havent done so yet, but, as Barreto said, Friday could be the day.

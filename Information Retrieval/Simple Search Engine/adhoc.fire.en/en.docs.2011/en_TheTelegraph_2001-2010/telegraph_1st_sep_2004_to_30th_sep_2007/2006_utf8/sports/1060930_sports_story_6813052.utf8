 Boycott swung verdict

 Boycott 

London: The testimony of Geoffrey Boycott, one of the expert witnesses for the defence, proved crucial in clearing Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq of ball-tampering, British media claimed Friday. 

Boycott and Simon Hughes proved sufficiently convincing for ICC adjudicator Ranjan Madugalle to arrive at the conclusion that the Pakistan team had not altered the condition of the ball, a paper stated. 

Boycott in particular delivered a veritable tour de force. At one point, he took the infamous match ball in his hand, held it up and said, thats a good ball, not just a playable ball, the paper claimed. 

Boycott also took exception to the idea that an accusation of cheating should be tolerated. 

If me or any of my friends were ever called a cheat, he told the hearing, the accuser would be decked with a bunch of fives. 

The former England opener invoked the spirit of the game with passion. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Post-Asian Games, India will need a 

 new set-up

 - Malady of conceding late goals cost us dear 

 Stickwork

 Gurbux Singh

Another disastrous World Cup campaign and a battered and bruised India were once again left licking their wounds. Just take a look at our past performances in the games showpiece event: we finished 12th in 1986, 10th in 1990, ninth in 1998, 10th in 2002 and now 11th in Germany. Shocking, disappointing and unacceptable call it whatever you want. 

Realistically speaking, we no longer belong to the upper echelons of world hockey a place currently possessed by European superpowers like Holland, Germany, Spain and Australia. But having just about avoided going home with the wooden spoon is not tolerable. 

Catastrophe struck on the eve of the World Cup when we missed out on Sandeep Singhs services due to a freak accident. Its not an excuse, but a team with limited resources would find it too heavy a blow to cope with. 

Its in this regard, I thought, that the seniors should have taken on more responsibility and helped the team synthesise. I sincerely believed that they would take Sandeeps loss in their stride and put on an inspiring performance. 

Though I expected a semi-final berth, even a 5-7 finish would have done, keeping in mind our standards. In fact, this is probably our correct position in world hockey and the world rankings have just reflected it: we are now No. 7. 

We started off well against the hosts and ultimate winners Germany; we played against them on equal terms and lost in the end. Except for the match versus Holland, which we played really badly, we faired well against the others. In fact, we should have defeated South Korea. 

We once again fell victim to our old malady of conceding late goals. Lets again check the facts here: Germany scored their match-winner in the 69th minute, England scored three goals between 54th and 61st, South Africa equalised in the 64th and South Korea rallied from 0-1 down to 2-1 with goals in the 62nd and 68th. Its happening too often, and the coach has failed to do something about it. 

Another point to the negative: we failed to earn enough penalty corners and conceded some easy ones. Bad defensive play, along with soft goalkeeping, was the core point of our shocking display. 

There was no link between defence and midfield. I was also shocked to see that when we did earn a penalty corner, there werent five players inside the D and teammates were being called to come in as reinforcement. 

Save for Shivendra Singh, nobody played upto the mark. Its a real pity that in a team of 18, only a single player stands out. Gagan Ajit Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, Vikram Pillay, Ignace Tirkey and captain Dilip Tirkey are all fading lights now. 

The Indian Hockey Federation will probably not go in for a massive shake-up for the Asian Games. But after the Doha meet, there has to be a new set-up, new ideas. We must realise that hockey today is played on a different level. India and Pakistan both have been left behind and both will take some more time to catch up. 

Its heartening to hear that the International Hockey Federation (FIH) has wanted to restructure Indian hockey. The game has been synonymous with India and we have had immeasurable success, and the decline is a great cause of concern, to FIH as well as millions of connoisseurs of the game.

 Bangalore: The focus of 

 all race goers will be the running of the Gr 1 Indian Turf 

 Invitation Cup on Sunday. The premier event in the Indian 

 racing calendar was started in the year 1963 and is regularly 

 held each year on rotation basis. Only in recent years, 

 RCTC has not been able to hold this event either due to 

 flash strike by the syces or tight financial position of 

 the club. However, there is hope that the next years 

 Invitation Cup may finally be held at the oldest turf authority 

 of India.

 Originally sponsored by Vazir Sultan Company and later by ITC, the event is now held with contributions from the five turf authorities of India. The Invitation Cup is the race to determine the champion of champions. The Racing Awards, the social functions that go with the event and the races to determine the champion sprinter and champion stayer, besides the champion of champions have made the week-end a memorable one. 

 Storm Again was the first horse to clock under two minutes 20 seconds followed by Zurbaran at Hyderabad.

 S Ganapathy-trained Mystical and Flashing Star and S Padmanabhans Holding Court and Democraticus are among the total of ten runners entered for the fray.

 Mystical after an unblemished record of successive wins in Mumbai, blotted his copybook by losing out to Holding Court and Velvet Rope in the Indian Derby. 

 But Mystical was baulked for an opening at a crucial stage. Therefore, he failed to collar the frontrunners. Bred to stay well, Mysticals that run is best ignored and he could be the one to beat in the Invitation Cup.

 Holding Court, who finished second in the Indian Derby, is the one who can give Mystical a run for his money. The runaway winner of the Bangalore (summer) Derby also has a good winning record and he is in pink of condition, too. 

 Flashing Star, who has a number of seconds to his credit, finally made it in the Bangalore Derby (winter) beating Refreshing. Unlike his previous outings, he was kept well up with the pace and when asked for an effort, he sizzled past the front runners in a trice. The trip of 2400 meters seems to suit him best and his recent Derby win augurs well for him. He should be right there at the finish.

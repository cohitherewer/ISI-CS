The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tension, drama and celebrations

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: If the celebrations that followed Jagmohan Dalmiyas victory over city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee knew no bounds, the events that preceded it were no less dramatic. 

Even before the annual general meeting got underway, the challengers were dealt a blow when Debashish Gangulys plea to represent South Suburban Club ? claiming to be its general secretary ? was turned down by observer Santosh Kumar Phoujdar. 

On Saturday evening, a district court had barred Nirmal Mukherjee ? a Dalmiya backer who had been cleared by Phoujdar during his scrutiny of nominations ? from representing the club. There was hectic activity and unparalleled police bandobast in and around Eden Gardens. 

An additional commissioner, a joint commissioner and three deputy commissioners took guard outside Eden Gardens, along with 150 other uniformed personnel. 

Officers-in-charge of police stations, intelligence branch officials were on duty at the stadium entrance. The mounted police was also pressed into service. Traffic movement was barred in front of the Eden and movement of pedestrians was restricted in the area. 

Both camps resorted to last-minute campaigning, with club representatives being escorted by agents to the staircase leading to the conference hall of Dr B.C. Roy Club House. Voters were not allowed to take cellphones inside. 

Challenger Mukherjee was among the first of the big top guns to arrive, followed by Dalmiya a few minutes later. Various club representatives, however, had started assembling at the venue from 11 am. 

Ajit Panja drew much attention when he arrived around 4.30 pm. Panja, after accidentally filing his papers for the post of president, later clarified that he was not a candidate. 

Voters were handed all four ballots at one time by the observer, making the process simple and less time-consuming. The counting of votes, however, took more time ? around two-and-a-half hours. 

Enthusiasm and excitement among the club representatives reached fever pitch outside the Eden with a large number of people gathering there. 

There was no hiccup once the AGM started and the first three items on the agenda went off smoothly. Election was the final item. 

Among those impressed by Phoujdars role was former India goalkeeper and Calcutta Port Trust representative Shibaji Banerjee. The process of conducting an election through an observer is a rare thing. It went off very well. 

Another Maidan veteran and a second division club representative said: Whoever wins should work for the good of Bengal cricket at the grassroots level. 

That should be the bottomline. Always.

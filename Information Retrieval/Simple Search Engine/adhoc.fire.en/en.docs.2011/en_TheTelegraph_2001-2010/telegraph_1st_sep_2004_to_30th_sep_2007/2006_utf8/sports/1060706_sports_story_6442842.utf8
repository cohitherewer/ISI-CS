 Ronaldo may have knee surgery

Rio de Janeiro: Ronaldo is likely to have knee surgery 

during his vacation following Brazils exit from the World Cup, Brazil doctor 

Jose Luis Runco said on Wednesday. 

Runco said Ronaldo had been suffering from knee pains, caused by tibial calcification, for about eight months and the operation was needed to remove the calcium deposits. 

Now at the end of the World Cup, he told me that he would probably use the holidays for the surgery. Hes had it for eight months and every now and then he complains (of pain), Runco said. 

Speaking in Rio de Janeiro, he said the problem had no impact on the Real Madrid strikers performance, and his recovery from the surgery should be quick. 

If that is what I think it is, it will be a quick surgery and hell be ready to play by the start of the season, said Runco. 

Ronaldo is spending his vacation in Europe with his family after Brazil were knocked out by France in the World Cup quarter finals. Reals next game is a friendly against Real-Salt Lake on August 12 in the United States. 

Ronaldo struggled with minor health problems and suggestions he was overweight ahead of the World Cup. 

Two goals against Japan and one against Ghana allowed 

him to break the World Cup scoring record with 15 goals in the finals.

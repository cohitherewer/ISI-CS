 Jeev, Wenchong to lead Asian challenge 

Hong Kong: Current Asian Tour Order of Merit leader Jeev Milkha Singh and Chinese No. 1 Liang Wenchong will spearhead the Asian challenge at the Hong Kong Open golf tournament starting here on November 16. 

The other Indians likely to be seen in action include Jyoti Randhawa, Shiv Kapur, Gaurav Ghei, Rahil Gangjee, Amandeep Johl and Harmeet Kahlon. 

The UBS Hong Kong Open assumes importance as it will be the last event for players to make it to the top-60 in the Order of Merit to determine next years card and for a place in the Volvo Masters of Asia. 

This years $2 million Open once again co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours takes place from November 16-19 at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling. 

Organisers are compiling a world-class field with defending champion Colin Montgomerie and major winners Retief Goosen and Michael Campbell already confirmed for the event.

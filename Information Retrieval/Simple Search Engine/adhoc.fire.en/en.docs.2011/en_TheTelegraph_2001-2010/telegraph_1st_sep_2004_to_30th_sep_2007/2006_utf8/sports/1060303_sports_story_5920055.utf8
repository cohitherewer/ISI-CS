Nagpur: Paul Collingwood finally ended his wait at the VCA Stadium on Thursday and no wonder it was a great relief for him. 

A significant part of the inspiration behind the Durham players unbeaten 134, which pulled England out of the rut in the first innings against India in the first Test, could be drawn from his last Test appearance ? against Pakistan in Lahore three months ago. 

Collingwood came close to achieving his first Test century, having made 96 and 80 in that match, but his efforts were not enough to prevent Pakistan from winning it by an innings and 100 runs. However, the pain of missing out on the magical figure was always there. 

In Lahore I missed it and today it happened. It was a great relief for everybody in the dressing room as well as the team management. Ive waited for long to get it, Collingwood, who had to drag England along with the tail-enders, admitted after the days action. 

Once I got to the 90s, I really wanted to make sure that I wouldnt miss it this time around, the 29-year-old said, adding that the tail-enders did a fantastic job to help me go along. 

I just had to play to the situation and obviously it went well. To get close to 400 was a great effort by everyone, he further stated. 

Since a major part of his innings was built around the associations with Matthew Hoggard, Steven Harmison and Madhusuden Monty Panesar, India captain Rahul Dravid packed the field with close-in fielders towards the end of each over in a bid to prevent him from retaining the strike. 

I wanted to play attacking cricket? so they brought the field in for the last few balls of each over, but I thought I would take them on, Collingwood observed. 

V.V.S. Laxman also complimented Collingwood for his innings. Its not easy to play with the tail. But full credit should go to Paul because of the way he had applied himself and played with the tail, Indias middle-order bat pointed out. 

Interestingly, this is just Collingwoods sixth Test match while he has already appeared in 85 one-day Internationals. Is the unbeaten 134 a statement from him his end to stake a strong claim to the Test side? 

Collingwood smiled and admitted he wanted to change the situation. Its in peoples minds really. I know I have to score runs and change that, he said. 

Realistically, what was the target he was looking for? Anything in excess of 300, he said. Believe it or not, we were even thinking about 350.

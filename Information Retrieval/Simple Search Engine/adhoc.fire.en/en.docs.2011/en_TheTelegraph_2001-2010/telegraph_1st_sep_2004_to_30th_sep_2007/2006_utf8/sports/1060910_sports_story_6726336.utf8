 Pak to train in Jaipur

Karachi: Pakistans Champions Trophy squad will set up a week-long training camp in Jaipur ahead of the mini-World Cup to be held from October 7 to November 5. 

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) source said the team management was of the opinion that the players deserved a proper break after the hectic series in England and so a regular training camp at home was not necessary. 

Captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer feel that instead of having the customary preparatory camp in Pakistan, it would be better to give the players a complete break for three weeks and then train for a week in India, the PCB source said. 

Meanwhile, the PCB was planning to seek extension of the dates of Inzamams hearing by a day.

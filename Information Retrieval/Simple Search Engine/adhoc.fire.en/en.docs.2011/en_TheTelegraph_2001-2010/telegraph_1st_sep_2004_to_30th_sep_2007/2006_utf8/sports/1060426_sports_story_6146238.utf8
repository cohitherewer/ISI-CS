The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Victorian attitude comes under fire

 Chris Evert says Wimbledons attitude was a black mark on the sport 

London: Womens tennis officials and players blasted Wimbledon for a Victorian era view by announcing on Tuesday that it would remain the only Grand Slam event not to pay its mens and womens champions equal prize money. Champions past and present joined in the attack with Chris Evert saying Wimbledons attitude was a black mark on the sport. 

In the 21st century, it is morally indefensible that women competitors in a Grand Slam tournament should be receiving considerably less prize money than their male counterparts, said WTA Tour CEO Scott. 

The All England Club announced at a news conference that prize money for this years mens winner would be ?655,000 with the womens champion getting ? 625,000. The figures represent a four percent rise from last year. 

French Open organisers announced last month they would pay their mens and womens singles champions the same prize money of 940,000 euros ($1.13 million) this year, though they were criticised by the WTA for not applying the equality throughout the draw. 

The other two Grand Slams, the Australian and US Opens, have long offered equal money to men and women players. 

Women got the vote in Britain in 1918, and the Sex Discrimination Act has been in force for over 30 years, yet Wimbledon continues to take a Victorian era view when it comes to pay, Scott said in a statement. 

American Evert, who won the grasscourt Grand Slam three times, said: Wimbledon should do the right thing and award all womens players equal pay to the men. 

The fact that two of the grandest stages for womens sport, Wimbledon and Roland Garros, still do not treat women equal to the men is a black mark on the sport. 

Six-time winner Billie Jean King said: Wimbledon needs to join the modern world on this issue. 

Current champion Venus Williams added: Wimbledon needs to do the right thing and finally pay the women the same as the men. 

Russian Maria Sharapova, the 2004 champion, said: Womens tennis players are getting as many sponsors and media coverage as the men, and I understand that our TV ratings at the Grand Slams are pretty much equal to and often better than the men. So I dont understand the rationale for paying the men more than us. 

King had last week urged Wimbledon organisers to end the pay disparity but her pleas fell on deaf ears. 

All England chairman Tim Phillips said the total prize money for this years championships, which run from June 26 to July 9, would be ?10.38m, up 2.9 percent on last year. 

No tournament paid higher prize money than Wimbledon in 2005 and so far in 2006, and this increase further recognises the talent and commitment needed by top tennis players nowadays, he said. 

The mens doubles winners would each earn ?220,690, a rise of one per cent, with the women getting ?205,280. Mixed doubles prizes remain unchanged at ?90,000.

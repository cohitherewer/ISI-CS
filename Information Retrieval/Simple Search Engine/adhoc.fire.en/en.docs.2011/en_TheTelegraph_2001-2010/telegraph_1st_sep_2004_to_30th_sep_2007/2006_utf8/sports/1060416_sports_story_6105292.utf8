 We must learn to finish: Inzy

 Inzamam

Karachi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq wants his players to learn to finish off games which alone could help his team end the losing streak against arch-rivals India. 

Inzamam said the 4-1 scoreline in favour of India in the ODIs in Pakistan did not reflect the closeness of the contest. 

We competed well against India but just couldnt finish off the games. In Abu Dhabi, we have to find winning touches to the games, Inzamam said on the eve of the squads departure for Abu Dhabi where they will play two ODIs against India next week. 

The previous result may suggest that India won comprehensively. But India did well in pulling off the matches from tough situations. 

Its all about how good you are at finishing off the games, good teams dont give you chances too often and whenever the chance comes, you have to pounce on it. (PTI)

 Air India outclass Mahindra

Mumbai: Air India outclassed Mahindra United 2-1 in the National Football League at the Cooperage here on Thursday. 

Air Indias Nigerian import Basheeru Mohammed Abbas scored the opening goal in the last minute of the first half and then set up the second in the 58th, scored by Paresh Shivalkar. 

Abbas headed in low to the right of Mahindra custodian Sandeep Nandy off a right cross from Zaheer Abbas to put AI 1-0 up in the 45th minute. 

Air India got their second when Basheeru cut past two rival defenders from the right into the box before laying it on a platter for Shivalkar to find the target. 

Jose Ramirez Barreto pulled one back for Mahindra in the injury time.

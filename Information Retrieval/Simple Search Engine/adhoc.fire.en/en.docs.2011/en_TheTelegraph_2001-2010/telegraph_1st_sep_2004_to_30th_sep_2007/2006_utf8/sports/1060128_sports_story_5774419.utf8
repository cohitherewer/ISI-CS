 East Bengal riding Bhutia resurgence

[+uc('FREE-KICK

Its now an established fact that winning the National Football League (NFL) without foreign help is well nigh impossible. Let me state another indisputable truth: there is no Indian catalyst more powerful than Bhaichung Bhutia. 

These are very early days in the 10th edition of the NFL. But its very noticeable after seeing just four rounds of action what difference an in-form Bhaichung can make to the fortunes of a team. East Bengal havent got their three ideal foreign recruits, and yet they have made a flying start mainly because Bhaichung is firing on all cylinders. 

I have been noticing a somewhat different Bhaichung from the SAFF Cup. He led from the front, shouldered a great deal of responsibility, made peace with Nayeem and looked a very mature footballer. The national team benefited from the skippers good form in Pakistan, its now East Bengals turn to reap the rewards. 

He also looks determined to dismiss a charge which has been made against him from some quarters over the past few seasons: that he takes full fees but doesnt play the entire season. 

I have no doubt in my mind that there isnt a desi striker who is a patch on Bhaichung. A strikers first touch is so very important and no Indian has a better first touch than Bhaichung. I am just praying that the opposition doesnt resort to desperate tackles from behind in order to stop Bhaichung. We want a fit and healthy Bhaichung not only for the NFL but also for the Asian Cup and other national assignments coming up this year. 

Even Phillipe De Ridder seems to have quickly realised the worth of Bhaichung. The Belgian coach knows he is a star and that his ego has to be nursed with care. Bringing the best out of Bhaichung over a period of four months will be De Ridders biggest test. 

De Ridder is not the first foreigner to coach an Indian club side, but hes definitely a trend-setter as far Bengal football is concerned. At a time when they were forced to think of a replacement for Subhas Bhowmick, East Bengal made a smart move by appointing De Ridder as coach. 

The Belgian was in the city on an IFA assignment when East Bengal approached him. He wouldnt have cost the club a bomb as hes not a big name. By appointing a foreign coach, East Bengal have ensured that the process of modernisation set in place by Bhowmick will continue. Coming in as a rank outsider, De Ridder will have an open mind and is also likely to bring in some fresh ideas. 

De Ridder is in a way lucky that he is working with East Bengal because they have the most professional set-up among all Calcutta clubs. Hiring a foreign coach couldnt have been a run-of-the-mill decision, but once they have appointed him, the club management will back De Ridder to the hilt. 

Just like East Bengals Bhaichung-driven launch, Mohammedan Sporting have made a heart-warming start. The key, understandably, is the presence of foreigners. In David Mkandwire, Mohammed Habibs team has chanced upon a strong defender whose presence has been inspiring the likes of Madhab Das to play above their potential. And up front, Patrick Okonji has been troubling most defence lines. 

Its been so far so good for Mohammedan Sporting. But they have a very long way to go. Its a marathon league, even though the number of teams has been reduced from 12 to 10. Habibs challenge will be to keep his flock fit and healthy till May and keep motivating them against more fancied teams game after game. 

And what do Mohun Bagan need to wriggle out of the crisis they already find themselves in? Well, simple. They have to find three decent foreigners and find ways to score. Not a goal scored in four home matches is an alarming statistic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania star attraction

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza will be the star attraction at the second edition of the Videocon Challenge Tennis Tournament to be held in Siliguri on November 19. The exhibition includes both doubles and singles matches. 

Shikha and Neha Uberoi and Rushmi Chakravarthy will be the others vying for honours. Last time we held both a mens and womens tournament, but the growing popularity of womens tennis in India has prompted us to think of an exclusive ladies meet, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharjee said at a press conference on Thursday. 

The tournament, organised by the Siliguri Stadium Committee and managed by Jaidip Mukerjea Tennis Academy, will offer a total prize money of Rs 5 lakh. Mahesh Bhupathi and Sourav Ganguly will be guests at the meet.

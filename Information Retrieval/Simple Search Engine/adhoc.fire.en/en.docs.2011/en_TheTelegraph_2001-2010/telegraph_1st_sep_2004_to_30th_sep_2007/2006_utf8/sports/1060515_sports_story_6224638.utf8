The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Surely, each of us is entitled to an opinion, says a senior

 - Virender Sehwag gets support on comments; Anger at spineless ICPA 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sehwag

 Kingston: Even if everybody 

 in Team India may not have been impressed by Virender Sehwags 

 perfectly harmless views on former captain Sourav Ganguly, 

 conveyed through a recent interview to a news agency back 

 home, the Boards over-reaction has certainly won him 

 support. 

Theres also anger at the spineless Indian Cricket Players Association (ICPA) which remains silent on issues concerning the fraternity. Captain Rahul Dravid is one of its founding members and wants the Board to extend recognition. 

 Veeru (Sehwag) didnt 

 say anything controversial... He spoke the truth... Surely, 

 each of us is entitled to an opinion and that could be about 

 our most successful (Test) captain, one of the seniors 

 on tour told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the team hotel (Hilton) here, he added: One can understand why Sourav keeps quiet... Imagine what would happen to him if he himself uttered something! I feel sorry for Sourav... 

The senior tore into the ICPA, which doesnt seem to have done anything of note since it came into being in late 2002. He said: Its spineless... It should take a very public stand on issues such as burnout... Whats the point in staying silent? Is holding an occasional fund-raising dinner enough? 

 Sourav

Apparently, many feel much the same way. Strangely, till the other day, the Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi-headed ICPA hadnt even moved the Board for recognition. 

Returning to Sehwag, Board secretary Niranjan Shah ticked him off (officially described as advice wrapped in warning) for, among other things, saying sometimes we miss him (Sourav). 

The vice-captain had also commented: He supported me a lot... He backed players like Yuvraj Singh... Hes still playing first-class cricket and, hopefully, will get a chance again... Most of the times India won when he got a (one-day) hundred... 

Sourav, whose last ODI appearance was eight months ago, has 22 hundreds. 

The Board, it may be recalled, gagged Harbhajan Singh (last September) when he backed Sourav in his row with coach Greg Chappell. Then, in February, Yuvraj was warned not to speak about Sourav and matters of selection. 

 Its to be seen whether Sehwag stays the last 

 in this unusual list.

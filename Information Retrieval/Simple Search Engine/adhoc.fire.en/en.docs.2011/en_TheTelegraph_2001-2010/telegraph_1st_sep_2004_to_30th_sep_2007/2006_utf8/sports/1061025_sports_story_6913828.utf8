Calcutta: All India Football Federation (AIFF) is treating the AFC Youth Championship commencing this Sunday as launching pad for the preparation of Asian Cup 2011, which India are planning to bid to host. 

Talking to the media on Tuesday, AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said: This is perhaps the biggest organised competitive football tournament in India. Most of the players playing here will be a part of the Youth World Cup in 2010. 

If this tournament goes without any hitch, then well be in a better position to make a bid for the 2011 Asia Cup, he added. Das Munshi maintained that he would consider a last eight-berth for India as a great achievement. I would be happy if we finish within the top eight. We have to face a few very good teams. But if we make it to the semi-finals, Ill be more than happy. 

Iran, Japan, Australia and Saudi Arabia are formidable sides, whereas we have some chances against teams like Jordan and Kyrgistan, he added. He also expressed contentment over the fact that that no player was injured. 

The tournament gets underway simultaneously in Bangalore and Calcutta from Sunday. Other than playing two tournaments in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, Ismail Akhmedovs boys went for training in Portugal and played friendly matches in Laos. 

Das Munshi further informed that he is discussing with the Union law ministry the issue over foreign players of Indian origin. We are in discussion with the law ministry if players of Indian origin, who are now citizens of other countries, can be given Indian citizenship so that they can play for the country, he pointed out.

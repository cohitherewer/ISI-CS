 Atwal ends at tied 71st spot

 Reno Tahoe Open

 Will MacKenzie, 

 who won the title, in Reno on Sunday 

 Reno (US): Daniel Chopra 

 finished three strokes behind winner Will MacKenzie, but 

 still managed his career-best finish as he ended fourth 

 at the Reno Tahoe Open Golf Tournament on Sunday.

 Chopra fired a final round of 

 three-under 69, equalling his best closing round at Desutche 

 Bank Championships in 2004, to finish fourth and set to 

 rest doubts about his ability to finish a tournament with 

 a good round.

 Chopras finish also carried 

 him closer to the million dollar mark, as he now has just 

 over $972,000 and is placed 69th on the money list making 

 it by far his best year on Tour.

 It was his fourth top-10 finish 

 of the year and he has now finished inside top-25 in six 

 of the 18 cuts he has made from 26 starts this season.

 Arjun Atwal had one of the most 

 roller-coaster of a round with four birdies and six bogeys 

 for a two-over 74 that saw him finish tied 71st. With just 

 over $438,700 he is 134th on the money list and needs to 

 be inside 125 to keep a full card for next season. 

 Chopra had a bogey on third, but 

 made up soon after with an eagle on fourth. There were birdies 

 on fifth and ninth, but in between he dropped shots on sixth 

 and eighth to turn in one under. 

 American Will MacKenzie birdied 

 the final hole to win his maiden PGA Tour title by a shot. 

 The 31-year-old from North Carolina carded a one-under-par 

 71 to hold off Tour veteran Bob Estes, who closed with a 

 72.

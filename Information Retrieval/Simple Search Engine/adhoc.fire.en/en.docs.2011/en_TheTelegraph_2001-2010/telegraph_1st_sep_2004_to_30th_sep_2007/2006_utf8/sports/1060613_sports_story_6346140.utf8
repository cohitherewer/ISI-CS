 Figo still 

 the man to watch 

 On Target

 in Cologne on Sunday

 Portugal may not have won the 

 World Cup, but they boast of a rich football tradition. 

 In 1966 they reached the World Cup semi-finals and won the 

 third place, beating the USSR, one of the games powerhouses 

 then. 

 Portugal have also provided the 

 world with some of the games true exponents. Eusebio 

 was the top-scorer of the World Cup in England and the indisputable 

 star of that tournament. In modern times, players like Luis 

 Figo, Deco and Cristiano Ronaldo have been successfully 

 carrying the weight of that legacy on their shoulders. 

 This awe-inspiring pedigree was 

 surprisingly not to be seen in Portugals 1-0 win over 

 Angola on Sunday night. True, opening the World Cup campaign 

 with a win is always satisfying, but the manner in which 

 it was earned ? despite the presence of a number of stars 

 in the team ? is a bit disappointing. 

 Portugals start to the meet 

 can, in a way, be compared to that of England ? an early 

 goal and some individualistic display in an otherwise pedestrian 

 football. Like Beckham in Englands case, his former 

 Real Madrid teammate was instrumental in Portugals 

 solitary goal ? Pauleta couldnt have missed it once 

 his captain squared the pass to him so accurately near the 

 six-yard box. 

 Besides his leadership quality, 

 Figos enthusiasm, ball control and speed even at this 

 age ? he simply outsped the Angolan defender with just a 

 kick on his feet ? was simply amazing. This only shows why 

 the 33-year-old is still regarded as one of the worlds 

 best. 

 The Angolan keeper was also 

 partially responsible for the goal. When he saw one of his 

 defenders chasing the ball and Figo, he should have stayed 

 put on the line and not come up. This is inexperience, and 

 I must say, such things are part of your journey when you 

 happen to be the debutants on the worlds biggest stage. 

 The likes of Ronaldo, therefore, 

 need to learn a lot from their captain. Ronaldo is a key 

 player of Manchester United. Hes temperamental, but 

 his association with one of worlds most successful 

 clubs means he can be a hero in the Portugal team. But Im 

 afraid to say he indulged in what I shall call fancy 

 football against Angola. No wonder he had to be substituted 

 by the coach. 

 It really amazes me how he scuppered 

 one chance after another by merely playing to the gallery. 

 The young man must understand that how big a star you may 

 be, you should have some responsibility towards your country. 

 After all, Ronaldo has got a chance to represent his country 

 in the World Cup and it should act as a motivation. Who 

 knows whether Portugal would qualify next time or the player 

 would be in a form good enough to get a call-up in the national 

 team? The legacy of Eusebio can not be maintained by merely 

 playing to the gallery. 

 Ronaldo is young and good-looking. 

 There are very few handsome football stars. Look at Beckham: 

 Certainly, there are players more talented than the English 

 midfielder. But they lack Beckhams look and style 

 and, therefore, are not as recognisable as him across the 

 globe. 

 Angola dont have a striker 

 like Didier Drogba, yet they fought well and must return 

 a lot more confident from the match. On the other hand, 

 I hope Portugal will return to a team game in the next match. 

 And for this to happen, everybody ? Ronaldo, Deco or Figo 

 ? must play in cohesion. After all, if Portugal fail to 

 make the quarters, it will be a huge disappointment for 

 their supporters.

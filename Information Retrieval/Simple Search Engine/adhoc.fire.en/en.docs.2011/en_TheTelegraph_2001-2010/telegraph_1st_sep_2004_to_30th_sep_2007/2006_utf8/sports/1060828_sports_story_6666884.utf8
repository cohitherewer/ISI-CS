Calcutta: Mohammedan Sporting were lucky to escape with a goalless draw against George Telegraph in the Sahara CFL Premier Division match at the Vidyasagar Stadium in Barasat on Sunday. 

The match could well be an immediate extension of the pattern one saw in East Bengals 0-1 loss to Mohun Bagan the previous day. George Telegraph, starting as underdogs, held sway over Subhas Bhowmicks side throughout but they didnt have one Bhaichung Bhutia to translate a creditable draw into an incredible win. 

After six matches, George Telegraph are on six points, while Mohammedan Sporting missed the chance of emerging as provisional leaders, having now tied on 12 points with East Bengal (who have played a game less). 

In tune with Bhowmicks strategy, the black-and-white brigade went for the jugular right from the beginning. In the 10th and 33rd minutes, Raman Vijayan missed the target from close while a Mike Okoro header in between forced an acrobatic save from the George goalkeeper Swarup Das. 

As Mohammedan Sporting raided the rival box from the flanks, Swarup in particular and two deep defenders in general Gour Naskar and Shyam Mondal thwarted them with an unusual confidence. The Man-of-the-Match award eventually went to the Swarup a diminutive figure who looked tall for Okoro amp; Co. but more importantly, his performance under the bar percolated an air of confidence into his teammates, who swelled it further as the match wore on. 

In the second half, George left-half Ashim Das seemed to have successfully taken the baton from Swarup and gave Mohammedan Sporting backline a series of scary moments. Through his jinking run down the flank, instinctive speed and intelligent one-to-one with teammates, the Shyamnagar-based player was the pivot on which Georges attacks revolved. 

Sadly, their new Nigerian recruit Yusuf Ibrahim failed to do justice to his teammates efforts when he failed to beat Gopal Das from a one-to-one situation in the 69th minute, and took a shot in haste and missed the target from inside six-yard box three minutes later.

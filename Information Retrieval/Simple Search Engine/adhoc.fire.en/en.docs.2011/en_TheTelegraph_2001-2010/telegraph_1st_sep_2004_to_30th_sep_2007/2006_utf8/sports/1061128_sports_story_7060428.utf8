 Kaifs home vandalised 

Allahabad: A group of people, claiming to be supporters of the Lok Janshakti Party, on Monday vandalised the house of Mohammed Kaif after his poor show in the ongoing ODI series against South Africa. 

Kaif scored 8 and 10 in the two one-dayers against South Africa who drubbed India in both the matches so far, leading to strong criticism back home. 

A number of them tried to storm the house, broke some electric bulbs and plastered the name plate with mud, the police said. 

They also raised slogans against BCCI chief Sharad Pawar for persisting with Greg Chappell as the Indian coach and burnt their effigies. 

Nobody except servants were present at Kaifs house during the protest. Although Kaifs roots are in Allahabad, he stays in Noida nowadays.

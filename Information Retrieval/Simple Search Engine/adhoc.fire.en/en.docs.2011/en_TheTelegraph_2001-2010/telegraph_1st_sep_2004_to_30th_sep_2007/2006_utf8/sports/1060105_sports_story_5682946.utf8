 Ljubicic focuses on his priorities

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ivan Ljubicic during his first round match in Chennai on Tuesday 

Chennai: The untouchable Roger Federer apart, none had it as good as Ivan Ljubicic in the year that just passed us by. 

A glance at his basic statistics will quickly help realise how the Croat graduated from a good top-50 level pro to a feared top-10 player. He featured in as many as 10 finals, winning two of them. He also won for his country their maiden Davis Cup almost single-handedly, starring in victories over the US, Russia and Slovak Republic. 

So, has life changed in the last few months? 

Yeah, in the sense that the media is taking a lot of time, Ljubicic said with a hint of a smile shortly after winning his first-round match at the Chennai Open. 

As a kid you dream of appearing on television, signing autographs for fans? all that is a reality now. Im not complaining at all. 

Will the pressure of high expectations weigh him down every time he goes out to the court now? 

No, in fact just the reverse, came the prompt retort. I feel like the pressure is completely off. I love tennis, I play to enjoy the game. Thats how Ive reached where I am today and thats how Ill continue to play. 

Talking of goals for 2006, Ljubicic said: The goal is to win every match, you never get used to winning. More specifically, I would look to do well in the Slams and also try to help Croatia retain the Davis Cup.

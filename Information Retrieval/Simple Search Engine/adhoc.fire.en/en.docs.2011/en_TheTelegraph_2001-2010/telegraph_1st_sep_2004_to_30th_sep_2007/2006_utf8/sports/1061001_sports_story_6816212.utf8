 Nazir may replace Inzy

Karachi: Wasim Bari, chairman of Pakistans selection committee, has said forgotten batsman Imran Nazir was being considered as a replacement for skipper Inzamam-ul Haq in the Champions Trophy. 

Imran has a chance of being selected basically because he is a brilliant fielder and very energetic as a batsman. But it is also a fact that he is an opener while Inzamam is a middle-order batsman, Bari said. 

Meanwhile, Pakistan are all set to have a paid, full-time selection committee in place by early next month, a PCB official said. Former Test player Talat Ali is likely to head the panel.

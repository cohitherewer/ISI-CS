 Damp end to final Test

 New Zealand vs WI

 Wellington: Wet weather 

 ensured the final Test between New Zealand and the West 

 Indies ended in a damp draw at Napier on Wednesday, enabling 

 the host to win the three-match series by a 2-0 margin.

 Play was abandoned before a ball 

 could be bowled on the fifth and final day after overnight 

 rain had again flooded parts of the McLean Park field.

 The Windies were left stranded 

 on 256 for four, with Runako Morton unbeaten on 70 and Dwayne 

 Bravo not out 22, while New Zealand did not get to bat.

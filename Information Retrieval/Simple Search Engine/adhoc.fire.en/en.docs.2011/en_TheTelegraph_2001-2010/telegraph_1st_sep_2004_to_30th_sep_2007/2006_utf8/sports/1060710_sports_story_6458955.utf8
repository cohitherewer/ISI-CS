 Federer mows down Nadal

 - to win four is out of this world, says the victor hes unbelievable, says the vanquished 

 The victor and the vanquished with their prizes on Sunday. Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal 6-0, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3 in the Wimbledon final 

London: Wearing his now familiar cream jacket and with the golden mens singles trophy tucked under his arm, Roger Federer left Wimbledon on Sunday having elegantly redressed the balance of power in mens tennis. 

The Swiss world No. 1 joined Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras as the only men in the professional era to have collected four consecutive Wimbledon titles when he beat his 2006 nemesis Rafael Nadal 6-0, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3. 

Its fantastic, I never thought it possible but I made it, said Federer after a match in which his periodic brilliance outshone Nadals tenacity. They are heroes of the game and this is the most important tournament, so to win four is out of this world. 

Spaniard Nadal, the 20-year-old French Open champion, had beaten Federer in four finals this year but found the Swiss in no mood to suffer a repeat on his favourite grasscourt. 

Federers eighth Grand Slam title moved him to within six of the record held by Sampras. It was the 24-year-olds 48th consecutive win on grass. 

Claycourter Nadal is a novice on the surface by comparison but he recovered bravely after a nightmare first set to become the first man to take a set off Federer in the entire tournament. 

Hes unbelievable, the Spaniard said. I played my best tournament of the year here. Ive improved a lot and Im very happy. Of course I want to improve further, Im only 20, he is 24. 

Its important for me to believe I can beat Roger on this surface. After the first set I played good tennis and he didnt beat me easily after that, did he? I saw in the match when I was playing my best tennis, when I was playing well, that the match was very close. Thats nice for me. 

Federer was unplayable in the first set, when he treated Nadal like an impertinent schoolboy. 

The second seed was reduced to an impotent mass of muscle as Federer administered a 24-minute extravaganza in which the coup de grace was a wondrous crosscourt backhand that kissed the net as it flashed past Nadal. 

Nadal had lost the first set of last months French Open final against the Swiss 6-1 but recovered to win and he again rebounded off the ropes with a vengeance. 

He broke Federer in the first game of the second set and led 5-3 before a shanked forehand long cost him his next service game. 

Nadal emitted an anguished Aaargh! and Federer then recovered from 3-1 down in the tiebreak to take it 7-5, shaking a determined fist in direction of his coach Tony Roche when his opponent found the net with a forehand. 

The left-handed Spaniards game plan of trying to outhit Federer from the back of the court works well on clay but on grass Federers bewitching assortment of spins, slices and sizzling drives sets him apart. 

The difference is often in his trajectory, with some of Federers shots appearing almost to pass through the net, so low are they struck. 

Nadal lived with him through the third set thanks to a combination of guts, solid serving and the occasional bludgeoned winner, usually on his supposedly weaker backhand. 

When Federer started the tiebreak with a poor smash, Nadal pounced and reeled off five consecutive points to take it 7-2. For the first time in the match the crowd witnessed the Spaniards trademark running leap and fist pump. 

The last person to take a set off Federer at Wimbledon was German Nicolas Kiefer in the 2005 third round. 

Nadal sabotaged his chances of building some momentum, however, when he sent a horrendous smash into the stands to lose serve for 3-1 in the fourth. It was the killer blow and Federer used a nonchalant forehand volley to break again two games later. 

The Swiss faltered on his first attempt to serve out the victory but made no mistake on his second try when a tame sliced backhand into the tramlines by Nadal handed him victory. 

Part of Federers charm is his air of humility after matches and this time the Swiss who sobbed uncontrollably after winning the Australian Open in January was characteristically unassuming. It was awfully tight and I was getting awfully nervous too, he admitted. 

Zi Yan and Jie Zhang gave China their maiden Wimbledon crown after beating Viriginia Ruano and Paola Suarez 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 in the womens doubles final.

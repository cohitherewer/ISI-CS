Ostend: Kim Clijsters powered Belgium into their second Fed Cup final on Sunday with a comfortable 6-0, 6-1 win over American teenager Vania King. 

Belgium, playing without French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne, took an unassailable 3-0 lead in the best of five-match semi-final to give them a first Fed Cup victory over the US in five attempts. 

Clijsters, the world No.2 and US Open champion, crushed her 17-year-old opponent, ranked 79th in the world, with a 55-minute exhibition of power tennis. 

The Belgian, who had struggled to beat hard-hitting Jamea Jackson on Saturday, was in total command on the indoor hard court on Sunday. 

We had an ideal situation, leading 2-0 after day one, so it was down to me to finish it off. It went a lot better than yesterday, Clijsters told a rapturous 5,000-strong crowd in port city of Ostend before the Belgian team did a lap of honour and sprayed champagne on to the court. 

The US, without both the Williams sisters and Lindsay Davenport, all injured, had expected to field Jill Craybas for the reverse singles, but captain Zina Garrison decided to give a match to all four team members after going two down on Saturday. 

Kirsten Flipkens, local hero on day one after beating Craybas, was playing American Mashona Washington in the fourth match of the tie before a concluding doubles. 

Belgium will play Italy in the final in the Belgian city of Charleroi on September 16-17. Italy, led by top 20 players Francesca Schiavone and Flavia Pennetta, beat Spain in the other semi-final concluded earlier on Sunday on clay in Zaragoza. 

It will be the Belgians second final, after they won the competition in 2001. 

Earlier, Italy reached their first Fed Cup final on Sunday when Flavia Pennetta overcame Spains Lourdes Dominguez-Lino 6-2, 6-4 to give her team an unassailable 3-1 lead in their semi-final. 

Spain, trailing 0-2 after Saturdays opening singles rubbers, pulled a point back in Sundays first match when Anabel Medina Garrigues beat Italys No. 1 Francesca Schiavone 6-2, 6-2. 

But Pennetta, who crushed Medina Garrigues 6-3, 6-0 in the opening match on Saturday, produced a gritty display to see off Dominguez-Lino in the searing heat on the clay surface. 

Garrigues, who gave a weak performance against Pennetta on Saturday, made a much better start against Schiavone. Breaking serve in the opening game, she put her higher-ranked opponent under heavy pressure as she moved her around the court in the searing heat. 

The Spaniard broke again in the seventh game to go 5-2 up and served out with authority to take the first set. 

Schiavone, who beat world No.1 Amelie Mauresmo in Italys impressive 4-1 victory over France in the previous round, never looked comfortable as she played a succession of loose shots and netted some easy returns. 

Garrigues broke twice in the second set on her way to a comfortable win that gave the five-times winners hope of staging a comeback victory on home soil. (REUTERS)

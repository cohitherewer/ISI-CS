The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Assault on Bengals cadet paddlers 

 - A matter of serious concern, says TTFI as police launch investigation 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Indian sports sunk to a new low on Saturday night when four cadet girls of the Bengal table tennis team were physically assaulted in Pondicherry. 

The paddlers ? taking part in the cadet and sub-junior national championships, were asleep at their guest house when some miscreants forced their way into the room and tried to molest them. 

The four participants are below 12 years and are members of the Bengal Table Tennis Association (BTTA)s team. The state has two other teams in fray ? (national federation-recognised) West Bengal Table Tennis Association and North Bengal Table Tennis Association. 

According to the manager of the BTTA side, Partha Dutta, the Pondicherry police has initiated an inquiry into the incident. 

The police and a member of the local womens commission have met the girls. They are looking into it, Dutta said from Pondicherry. 

Though the entire team has been shifted to another base, parents accompanying the wards are not too keen to move the police. 

Its a matter of serious concern and on our behalf, we have informed the Pondicherry police about it. Gautam Chakraborty (additional commissioner) also had a chat with the senior police officers in Pondicherry. But most parents dont want to stay back there for too long to cooperate with the legal process, a senior BTTA official pointed out. 

The guardian of one of the assaulted players took her away to an undisclosed location to avoid police interrogation in the morning, he added. 

The Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI) secretary Mool Chand Chouhan also described the incident as a heinous act. 

Were going to discuss the matter in our general committee meeting in February. I cant confirm any steps right now but well definitely pay more heed to the players security in future, he told The Telegraph while travelling towards Chennai from Pondicherry. 

Chouhan added that the TTFI has lodged an FIR with the police. He, however, ruled out the possibility of Pondicherry being stripped of any tournament in future. 

Recalling Saturday nights incident, Dutta said that when some locals, in collusion with a boarder of the guest house broke into the girls room, they screamed, waking up the other members of the team staying in other rooms. 

Even we caught one of them. But some locals started threatening us not to inform the police, he said. 

A BTTA official in the city said that the organisers are not trying to dilute the incident. They are now saying that somebody sneaked into the room trying to pilfer. Its a blatant lie, he insisted.

Hockenheim: Kimi Raikkonen seized McLarens first pole position of the Formula One season at the German Grand Prix on Saturday. 

Ferraris seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, gunning for his third pole in a row in what some fans fear could be his last appearance on home soil, had to settle for second place on the starting grid. 

Renaults world champion Fernando Alonso, winner at Hockenheim last year and 17 points clear of Schumacher in the championship with seven races remaining, qualified a distant seventh. 

The Spaniard, celebrating his 25th birthday, almost collided with his 37-year-old German rival in the pit lane in the heat of the battle. 

Raikkonens pole was McLarens first since Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, now absent after deciding to switch to the US-based Nascar series, in Belgium in September last year. 

It was nice to get pole. We had some difficulties but its the best place to start and lets see what happens tomorrow, said the Finn, who has not won a race since the thriller in Japan last October. 

 It was the ninth pole of his career, and second in a row in Hockenheim, and Raikkonen will be hoping to translate his advantage into a long-awaited victory in engine partners Mercedes backyard. 

In his five starts at the southern circuit, Raikkonen has failed to finish despite leading in both the last two appearances there. 

Brazilian Felipe Massa qualified third for Ferrari with Briton Jenson Button, out of the points for the past five races, alongside for Honda and Renaults Italian Giancarlo Fisichella behind in fifth. 

We are quite happy to have a strong opponent with us and having Alonso where he is right now, said Schumacher, who was 0.135 seconds slower but remains well placed to chase a hattrick of wins on Sunday. 

Thats obviously a good starting point. 

I exited the pit lane and once I was out I saw that Fernando was pretty close to me, Schumacher said of the incident. I wasnt aware that he was there, because there were so many people, so much mess and it was so tight. 

If he felt there was some problem for him, then Im sorry for that. But thats the way it goes sometimes. 

While Raikkonen filled the top slot, despite running wide on to the gravel on his final flying lap, Spanish teammate Pedro de la Rosa was ninth after colliding with Toyotas Ralf Schumacher at the hairpin. Ralf qualified eighth. 

The German collided with the Spaniard at the hairpin in the final part of qualifying. 

Both cars limped back to the pits for repairs, with the McLaren suffering a blown rear right tyre. 

The first part of the knockout session was red-flagged after five minutes when Toro Rossos American Scott Speed ran wide, spun and hit the wall. 

 Toyotas unlucky Italian Jarno Trulli will start 

 at the back of the grid, after qualifying 13th, because 

 of an unscheduled engine change in practice that cost him 

 10 places.

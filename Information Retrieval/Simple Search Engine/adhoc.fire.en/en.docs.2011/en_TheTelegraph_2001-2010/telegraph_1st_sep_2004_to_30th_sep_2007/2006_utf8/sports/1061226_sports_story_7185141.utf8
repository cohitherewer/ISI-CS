Melbourne: It will be the start of going-away parties for Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath, and a chance for Englands redemption in the Ashes. 

The fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) beginning Tuesday will also be one of the most well attended Test matches in the history of the sport. 

More than 95,000 spectators are expected each of the first two days, and likely the third and fourth, at the MCG. 

Hometown boy Warne, who announced his retirement from international cricket last Thursday, will be the major focus of attention as England try to win their first Test in the five-match series after three straight losses which returned the Ashes to Australia. 

McGrath said his last Test will also be the one beginning January 2 in Sydney, although McGrath will play in the limited-overs World Cup tournament ending in April before calling it quits. 

Australia are also aiming to become only the second team to win a five-match Ashes series 5-0. Warwick Armstrongs Australian team was the only other team to do it, in 1920-21. 

That might be something that might be spoken about, if theres an opportunity there for that to happen, it would be nice if this team could be the one to do it, captain Ricky Ponting said on Monday. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff expects to be fit for the match after getting treatment for his troublesome ankle. On the weekend, Flintoff had injections and did not bowl in the nets. 

Theres no secret, Ive had some discomfort in it over the past week, Flintoff said. Having an injection is just a precaution, Im not envisaging any long-term problems or worried about these next two Test matches, he added. 

Flintoff also plans to play as much as possible in the limited-overs series against Australia and New Zealand. That series will feature the return of Michael Vaughan from knee injury. 

When asked about the captaincy, Flintoff replied: the announcement is going to be made after the Test series. Michael Vaughan has been the England captain, I have been doing this in his absence. We will see what happens. 

Flintoff is confident England will play well in Melbourne. 

We want to show we can win here, we want to show we can win two Test matches, its a big occasion for us, he said. There has been a few things happening in the world of cricket over the past week, but it cant affect our preparations. 

Both teams held workouts on Monday, although the Australians was optional ahead of a Christmas lunch with their families at a Melbourne hotel. 

Warne is determined to end his international career with a clean sweep against the old enemy. 

As far as Im concerned weve got two Test matches to play and I just want to finish the series on a high, Warne said. I think if we can win 5-0 that would be a fantastic achievement for a great team.

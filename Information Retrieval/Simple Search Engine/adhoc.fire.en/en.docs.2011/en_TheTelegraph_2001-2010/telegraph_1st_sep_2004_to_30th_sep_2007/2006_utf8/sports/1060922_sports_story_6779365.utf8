Calcutta: She was ranked 497 in 2004. In 2005, she reached 196, a jump of 301 spots. In the current season, the Frenchwoman is world No. 66. She came here fresh from making a career breakthrough at the US Open where she reached the fourth round, eventually going down to Elena Dementieva. She has a killer backhand and is generally considered to be a big hitter. 

No more hints. The player in question is Aravane Rezai, fourth seed at the Sunfeast Open whom Sania Mirza will face in the quarter finals on Friday, having huffed past Sandra Kloesel on Thursday. 

Inconsistent, brimming with aggression bordering on foolishness at times, and plagued by the old demon that has been troubling her since she turned pro in 2003, the Indian idol found her first serves and nerves just in time to squeeze out a 7-5, 6-3 victory over an equally erratic Kloesel. 

The first set was a study in mediocrity. With the game never reaching great heights, the sole point of interest was whether any player is skilled enough to hold her serve. 

Among the 12 games of the first set, seven were broken, and Sania held one more game than her German opponent, which made all the difference. 

The Indian, ranked 50 spots above Kloesel, is a much, much better player in final analysis. She has more shots in her array, aggressive, has an allround game and is more creative. That the difference watered down to almost none in the first set owes largely to Sanias reluctance in keeping the ball at play. Instead of letting Kloesel make the mistakes in a rally, she would go for the winners each time and commit unforced errors. 

Up 5-4, in the tenth game of first set and serving for the set, Sania, down 15-40, double faulted and threw her racket down in disgust, forcing the chair umpire to issue the first warning for racket abuse. 

Whether or not that served as a wake-up call is debatable, but following this, Sania broke again and held to clinch the first set in 50 minutes. 

No prizes for guessing, because the second set started on the same note, with both players trading breaks. 

It was not until the fifth game that Sania started to stitch it all together. The zipping forehands, the delicate touches and net approaches were all there, but only after getting the break back to make it 2-3 in second set, did Sania look like the giant-killer she is. 

The sixth game was the Indians most authoritative one. She held her serve with ease and more importantly, it set up the turning point of the match, the seventh game, where her forehands started talking and she minimised her errors. 

The first serves returned in eighth and the fighter Sania emerged in ninth, cocky, arrogant and supremely confident. It took her 1 hour and 29 minutes to put Kloesel in her place. 

Earlier, world No. 97 Olga Poutchkova pulled off the upset of the day, beating seventh seed Nicole Pratt of Australia 6-2, 2-6, 6-2. The blonde Russian will meet Italys Alberta Brianti in last eight, who outmanouvered Angelique Widjaja of Indonesia 7-6 (9-7), 3-6, 6-3. 

Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia blew away Hana Sromova of Czech Republic 6-2, 6-0 to set up a quarter final date with qualifier Iroda Tulyaganova. The Uzbek world No. 346 justified her talent, beating Casey Dellacqua 6-3, 6-2. 

Shikha Uberoi and Melinda Czink entered the doubles semis, beating Pratt and Anastassia Rodionova 7-6 (8-6), 3-6, 6-4.

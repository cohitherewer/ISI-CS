 Discovery riders admit to drug use

New York: Two of Lance Armstrongs former teammates said they used a performance-enhancing drug when they were getting ready for the 1999 Tour de France, according to a newspaper report. 

Frankie Andreu, a 39-year-old former team captain, and another teammate who requested anonymity because he still works in cycling, told a newspaper that they used EPO in preparation for the 1999 race, when Armstrong won the first of his seven titles in cyclings biggest race. 

There are two levels of guys, Andreu said in a story published on the newspapers website Monday night. 

You got the guys that cheat and guys that are just trying to survive. 

Andreu said he took EPO for a few races and is admitting the use now because hes worried doping is having a negative effect on the sport. 

Neither of the teammates ever had a positive test for performance-enhancing drugs. Both said they never saw Armstrong take any banned substances. 

Armstrong, who overcame testicular cancer to win the Tour a record seven consecutive times, faced constant doping allegations toward the end of his career. He has repeatedly denied using performance-enhancing drugs.

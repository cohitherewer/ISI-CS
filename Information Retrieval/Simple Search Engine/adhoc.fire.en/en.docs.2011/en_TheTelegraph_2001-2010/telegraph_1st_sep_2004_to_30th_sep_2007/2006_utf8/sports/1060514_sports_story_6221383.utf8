 Sri Lanka follow on

London: Sri Lanka averted the ignominy of defeat within three days at Lords on Saturday with a combination of concentration and judicious strokeplay after being asked to follow on in the first Test against England. 

The fightback began in the first session when Sri Lanka took their overnight total of 91 for six to 192 all out through some bold stroke play and lax England fielding. 

Needing 359 to make England bat again, Sri Lanka lost an early wicket with only 10 runs on the board in their second innings before recovering to reach 183 for three at the close. 

Matthew Hoggard was the days hero, taking his 200th Test wicket in the course of a fine spell of swing bowling to finish with four for 27 in the Sri Lanka first innings. He then dismissed Jehan Mubarak for the second time in the match with a late inswinger which bowled the lefthander for six. 

Hoggard made the early breakthrough when play resumed under leaden skies, taking a tumbling, two-handed return catch to dismiss Parveez Maharoof (22) after deceiving the allrounder with an extravagant late outswinger. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff was rewarded for his sustained pace with the wicket of his opposite number Mahela Jayawardene caught behind for 61 .

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 AIFF and its bizarre rules

 - Parent body indifferent to Lawrences absence from camp

New Delhi: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) seems to have different rules for different people. While East Bengal last month faced federations wrath and heavy fine for not letting Vimal Pariyar attend the national camp, Goas Dempo Sports Club are getting away with similar offence without even being pulled up by the national body. 

For the second time in two months, Dempo has not released their star midfielder Climax Lawrence for the national camp for the Asian Cup qualifier against Yemen, which started in Goa on Monday. While all the players have reached Goa, Sushil Singh and Lawrence remain the two absentees. Sushil, who missed his flight from Calcutta on Sunday, is likely to report by Tuesday, but there is no trace of Lawrence, who is a local boy. 

This is not the first time, Lawrence has decided to play truant during the national camp. Last month, he did not attend the camp in Goa though he regularly took the field for Dempo in the Goa Professional League. 

So much so, that Dempo shot off a letter to AIFF saying that Lawrence was not fit enough to play in international matches and should be excused from attending the camp. The AIFF, contrary to what they did with Pariyar, accepted the argument and did not even bother to ask the footballer to report to the camp and go for a medical check up under the team doctor. 

Dempo secretary and coach Armando Colaco said he had already informed the AIFF about Lawrences lack of fitness. He is not yet to fully fit to play the entire stretch of a 90-minute match. 

When asked the national team manager Nasir Ali, also an AIFF executive committee member, said: We will advice Climax (Lawrence) to report for the camp as soon as possible. This time he is not going to get away with this. Ali, however, has no explanation about what stopped the AIFF from taking action against Dempo and the footballer when he did not come for the camp last time. 

In Pariyars case, however, the federation took a strict stand. The matter was not only discussed in the emergency committee but was also sent to the disciplinary committee, which recommended financial penalty for both East Bengal and IFA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The art of bowling is in the hand, not in the ball: Harbhajan Singh

 - Your body language has to match the Australians, otherwise theres no point being on the park 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Harbhajan Singh

Kuala Lumpur: Harbhajan Bhajji Singh has been Indias stand-out bowler in the ongoing tri-series. On Wednesday, he even contributed with the bat to be adjudged MoM. A veteran of 57 Tests (238 wickets) and 133 ODIs (159 wickets), the 26-year-old Harbhajan spoke to The Telegraph for well over 45 minutes. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q Youve begun a big season very well. Are 

 you driven by a target? 

 A (Smiles) I dont set goals in that 

 I must get X number of wickets. Playing positively is at 

 the top of my agenda. I never look too far ahead, though. 

 Were you a little disturbed 

 after the last Test series, in the West Indies, when you 

 didnt get to play all four Tests? 

 For a while, I was disappointed as I didnt 

 play the first two... Look, everybody wants to play, lekin 

 jagah khali 11 ke liye hoti hai... Thats 

 cricket, but my keenness didnt suffer during the time 

 I wasnt picked. 

 How did you motivate yourself 

 sitting on the sidelines? 

 I kept talking to myself... Kept telling myself 

 Im the best, but that I would have to wait for the 

 next chance... Whatever the situation, I dont lose 

 self-belief... And, when the next opportunity arises, I 

 look to give 200 and not just 100 per cent. The records 

 will show I did well in the last two Tests. 

 You spoke to the legendary Lance Gibbs... 

 Yes, it was quite an education.. 

 He emphasised that the knuckle was the strongest point in 

 a finger... Because of big hands, he had a different grip... 

 Im going to try that, but will need to first get it 

 right at nets... Murali (Muttiah Muralidharan) employs a 

 grip similar to Gibbs. 

 What was his advice? That I keep working hard and look to better my 

 line. Perhaps, vary it, so that a batsman has to continuously 

 guess... 

 With no cricket in Sri Lanka 

 last month, there wouldve been time for a one-on-one 

 with Murali... 

 Hes a friend... We did catch up... Its 

 remarkable that he remains so humble despite being such 

 an achiever... Thats something to learn. 

 Are you more motivated when 

 the face-off is with Australia? 

 Of course... You want to do well against the best 

 and, for a number of years, the Australians have been No.1... 

 The challenge is to make a mark versus the best... Jyada 

 maaza aata hai. 

 What was on your mind when 

 we played them, for the first time in a couple of years, 

 last week? 

 I was positive... I was aggressive... Your body 

 language has to match the Australians, otherwise theres 

 no point being on the park. If your shoulders droop even 

 before the contest has begun, then youve had it... 

 The battle has been lost. By nature, Im an aggressive 

 cricketer, but try to lift my body language even more when 

 up against the Australians. I try to dominate them. 

 Why are Australians different 

 from the others? 

 Because of their self-belief... Theyve been 

 winning so many matches that theyve got used to it... 

 They cant do without the taste of success... If youve 

 noticed, the Australians body language never dips... 

 Then, the players are so talented... Also, the Australians 

 plan very well... Thats why its rare for them 

 to lose the plot. 

 Is there going to be more pressure 

 as the Champions Trophy is at home? 

 (Grins) Nowadays, theres pressure 

 in every match. The days of there being more pressure in 

 a particular series or the World Cup or a particular tournament 

 are over. (After a pause) A plus is that there will 

 be plenty of support. Provided we play to potential, we 

 can beat anybody. 

 Has Ramesh Powars presence 

 in the squad made things more competitive? 

 Hes a very good bowler... Controls the flight 

 very well... However, having been around for eight years, 

 I dont have to think about small matters (like competition). 

 I assume youre disappointed 

 that you cant team up with Anil Kumble in the Champions 

 Trophy... 

 Yes... Its nice when Anil is around as one 

 may talk to him about anything... That there are times when 

 only one of us makes the XI makes no difference to our relationship. 

 Having already had surgery, 

 are you worried about wear and tear on account of excessive 

 cricket? 

 I dont know whats meant by too much 

 bowling or being over-bowled... The way I see it, the more 

 a bowler bowls, the better hes going to be... Bowlers 

 should bowl more at nets and, obviously, must get a long 

 bowl in matches... Im not happy bowling 30 balls a 

 day, I would like to bowl 90-100... Champions like Shane 

 Warne and Anil have spent hours and hours at nets... Theres 

 this saying which holds true for everything: Doodh mein 

 jitna shakkar dalo ge, utna meetha ho ga. Look at Glenn 

 McGrath, he has worked so hard over the years that, today, 

 he can close his eyes and pitch the ball where he wants 

 to. Dont they say practice makes perfect... 

 How long does it take to get 

 into rhythm, particularly at the start of a season? 

 Bowling is all about feeling... A bowler knows 

 when hes bowling well... Equally, he will know when 

 the ball isnt going out of his hands in the manner 

 it should... When the seam position isnt right... 

 Rhythm also has something to do with the state of ones 

 mind. 

 Are you more comfortable with 

 any one brand? 

 I dont know which idiot has spread the word 

 that I cant bowl with the Kookaburra... Because Ive 

 grown up with the SG Test, Im more comfortable with 

 it, just like Warne is probably more comfortable with the 

 Kookaburra. That doesnt mean I cant bowl with 

 the Kookaburra... Its absurd. The art of bowling is 

 in the hand, not in the ball. 

 What have eight years at the 

 highest level taught you? 

 What Ive learnt most is taking responsibility 

 and trying to do whats expected of me... No point 

 putting up ones hand and saying Im going to 

 do the job, if it cant be done. I do know that the 

 expectations are high... Because Im taking more responsibility, 

 my approach has changed somewhat. 

 How do you handle pressure? 

 Its not easy, but Ive got to think 

 of the team, not myself. 

 Much of your cricket was under 

 Sourav Ganguly and John Wright. For the past year, it has 

 been Rahul Dravid and Greg Chappell... What has been the 

 difference? 

 Kuch nahin... Nothing.... For me, everybody has 

 been okay... I know what my role is and I dont have 

 to be told that by the captain or coach... Of course, the 

 role may change from match to match... Form, for example, 

 can become a factor. If somebody isnt clear about 

 his role, then his mind isnt working. 

 It appears youre consciously 

 putting in a bigger effort at batting... 

 Its needed. 

 Your comments on Monty Panesar? 

 Im happy for him and its pleasing that 

 the Khalsa is doing so well in the UK... Monty, though, 

 must be given time to really establish himself and shouldnt 

 be judged in a hurry. People have compared him to a legend 

 (Bishan Singh Bedi), but its all too premature. He 

 will do better with more hard work. 

 The Twenty20 format hasnt 

 enthused you... 

 (Interrupting) Its going to kill spinners... 

 Why will anybody take to spin bowling? Who is going to risk 

 flighting the ball? In a 20-over match, the pressure is 

 on the bowlers (particularly spinners), not batsmen. The 

 bats are so good, the boundaries are pulled in... The wickets 

 are flat... 

 Is there a batsman you respect 

 for the way he has handled you? 

 Ive bowled to some very good batters... If 

 Ive got to name one, it will be Brian Lara... Bowling 

 to him is a challenge... Hes the big fish! 

 The last question: What do 

 you tell a young audience? 

 (Laughs) Study! That life is a long race 

 and face up to the challenges... Also, dont get complacent 

 or over-confident... Like me, be on your toes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 London: Arsenal and England player Ashley Cole has decided to sue two tabloids which published articles ?linking? him to a ?gay orgy.? Cole?s lawyer said on Friday that the suit accuses The Sun and The News of the World of defamation, harassment and breach of privacy, even though the articles did not name the player. The suit was filed in London?s high court. In a story published on February 12, The News of the World claimed two Premier League players were involved in a homosexual act. The tabloid published a follow-up story on February 19 and similar allegations appeared in The Sun.

 ?The newspapers knew there was no basis to name Ashley but arranged the articles and pictures in such a way that readers would identify him. There is no truth whatever in these allegations,? Cole?s lawyer said.

 Jerusalem: An Israeli State Cup tie was settled after a 34-kick penalty shootout, Premier League Maccabi Petah Tikva scraping home against second division side Maccabi Herzliya to reach the quarter-finals on Friday. Players from both teams failed to score nine times but hardest hit was Herzliya goalkeeper Shaul Smadja who missed two spot kicks, allowing a Petah Tikva a 13-12 victory.

 The match had ended 2-2 following extra time. Herzliya, who were down to nine men, took the lead 2-1 in the 117th minute through Ohad Kadussi before Petah Tikva?s Salim Toema equalised in the 119th minute to send the game to penalties.

 Madrid: Celta Vigo?s Argentine international defender Diego Placente is expected to be out of action for between four and six weeks after undergoing surgery on a knee cartilage injury on Friday. The 29-year-old left back, who is a regular in Jose Pekerman?s national side, sustained the injury in his side?s 2-0 victory against Cadiz last weekend.

 Tokyo: Former racing driver Aguri Suzuki on Saturday unveiled his new Super Aguri team that will compete for the first time on the Formula One circuit this season. ?I want to report good results in near future,? Suzuki told journalists in Tokyo, flanked by his two Japanese drivers, Takuma Sato and newcomer Yuji Ide.

 Suzuki launched the team late last year and signed ex-Bar Honda pilot Sato and novice Ide to herald the first all-Japanese driver line-up in the history of motorsport.

 Beijing: China cannot afford to spend too much on hosting the 2008 Olympics at the expense of the rural poor, a member of the country?s parliament has said. China?s budget for the Games is $2 billion, although an estimated $40 billion will be spent on improving Beijing?s infrastructure before the opening ceremony in August 2008.

 ?The organisers of the event should exert all efforts to present the best-ever Games to the world with the minimum amount of expenditure,? Zhang Guiyu, one of the 3,000 delegates to the National People?s Congress (NPC), was quoted as saying by the state Xinhua news agency.

 ?There are still many people living under the 

 poverty line, especially in the countryside. We cannot afford 

 an extravagant event,? added the entrepreneur from Shandong 

 province.

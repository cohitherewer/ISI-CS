 Federer expects a tough fight 

 - Have to play my best: Nadal 

London: Roger Federer plans to exact revenge for 13 months of Rafael Nadal-induced frustration in Sundays mens singles final. 

Despite his undisputed status as the world No. 1, Federer has been beaten five times in succession by the 20-year-old Spaniard since June 2005. 

Four of those were in finals this year, the most painful of which was the most recent ? his French Open final loss four weeks ago when Nadal denied the reigning US Open and Australian champion a rare non calendar-year Grand Slam. 

Were Nadal to end Federers three-year reign at Wimbledon on Sunday, he will have every right to consider himself the worlds best. 

A final is always very different because the pressure is much higher. Im sure I will have to fight much harder, Federer said. 

If he wins an eighth Grand Slam title, the Swiss will join Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras as the only men to win four consecutive Wimbledon singles crowns since tennis went professional in 1968. 

He is the best, no? Three times in a row he wins here. Im going to have a very difficult match because hes one of the best in history on all surfaces, especially this one, Nadal said. I will have to play the match of my life to win, but Im gonna try. I fear Roger on any surface, but on this more so because he is the best. (Reuters)

 Nadal: Federer can beat me anytime, anywhere

Paris: Spaniard Rafael Nadal believes world No. 1 Roger Federer can beat him anytime on any surface despite the French Open champions stranglehold over the Swiss on clay. 

Nadal, who will turn 20 during Roland Garros, has won five of his six meetings against Federer. 

He beat him in last years Paris semi-finals and appears to be the only player able to trouble the Swiss. 

The press always tell me now Roger is getting closer. But Roger is the No. 1. Im the one who needs to get close, no?, Nadal told a news conference on Friday. 

The last match between the top two players in the world was the closest yet with Nadal saving two match points in the decider to emerge as the Rome Masters Series winner after a five-set battle. 

Every match is very tough. In Rome he was really close. I can lose every match against him, he said. I know hes the No. 1, hes the best. He can beat me on every surface, any match. 

Nadal, who will start his tournament on Monday against Swede Robin Soderling, added he was flattered to have equalled Guillermo Vilas record of 53 consecutive wins on clay. 

Federer, on the other hand, is playing down talk of a great rivalry between him and Nadal. Lets take it slow with this rivalry thing, Federer said ahead of Roland Garros, which starts on Sunday. 

When you have a rivalry, one wins a match then the other one wins the next match, and so on. Thats not the case as he has won our last encounters. 

Federer was due to start his tournament against Arnaud Clement but the Frenchman withdrew on Friday with a groin injury and the Swiss will now face a lucky loser, Diego Hartfield of Argentina. 

In the womens, Amelie Mauresmo goes into the Grand Slam as top seed for the first time but her hopes of finally banishing the demons that have haunted her at Roland Garros are endangered by the unexpected threats of Martina Hingis and Nadia Petrova. 

Nadia might be ready to win a Grand Slam. Shes definitely one of the favourites, said Mauresmo of the Russian player who has won four titles this year including three on clay. 

Former world No.1s Serena Williams and Lindsay Davenport have already pulled out with long-term injuries, while health concerns hover over Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters and Henin-Hardenne. 

Another contender Maria Sharapova believes she will need a miracle to play at her best at the French Open. The world No. 4, who has yet to play a match on clay this season, arrived at Roland Garros very short of match practice. 

I do not think Im as competitive as I would like to be, Sharapova said. If I can play correctly, it will be a miracle. Im really not at 100 percent, the fourth seed said.

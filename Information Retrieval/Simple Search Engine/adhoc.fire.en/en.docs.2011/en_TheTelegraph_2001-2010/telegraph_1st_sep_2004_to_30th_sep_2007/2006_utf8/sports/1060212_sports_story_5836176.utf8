The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

India settle score with a bang

- My bowling was under pressure for the past few weeks, accepts MoM Pathan 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

Islamabad: 

The Tezgam Express, the Quetta Express and the historic Khyber Mail link Rawalpindi 

to all corners of Pakistan. Yet, the citys most famous name is Rawalpindi 

Express who has put the town in the lexicon of cricket.

As Pakistan failed miserably in their effort to stop 

the marauding Indian batsmen, Shoaib Akhtar was left to cool his heels in the 

dressing room. The bowling was made to look pedestrian once Virender Sehwag and 

Sachin Tendulkar set up the brilliant start. 

If Pakistan missed Shoaib, Bob Woolmer wasnt 

willing to show it. If he is injured, no question of missing him, 

the coach retorted later, trying to hide his disappointment.

In hindsight, Pakistan might have decided to field, 

on winning the toss, if Shoaib was available. His loss was surely Indias 

gain as Irfan Pathan produced an inspired spell to put the hosts under pressure 

right from the word go. 

Despite some resistance from Shoaib Malik and Younis 

Khan, they never really recovered as India cantered to a seven-wicket victory, 

their first on this tour, to level the Hutch Cup 1-1. The hosts will now have 

to deliver in the third match in Lahore on Monday, with Shoaib still remaining 

doubtful.

The bowlers set it up for us, conceded 

Rahul Dravid. 

Man-of-the-Match Pathan couldnt hide his happiness 

either. 

My bowling was under pressure for the past few 

weeks. Im happy I was able to swing it today? Im delighted that my 

effort has ended in a winning cause.

President Pervez Musharraf, who watched the opening 

session for more than an hour, was witness to the Pakistan debacle. He departed 

when Malik and Younis were trying to repair the damage after being reduced to 

68 for four. 

Somehow the hosts never seemed to be in the match. 

They were completely outplayed by a more confident and determined India.

The manner in which Sehwag and Sachin began the chase 

was amazing. Sehwag, firing on all cylinders, cut Rana Naved-ul Hasan over point 

for a six and finished off by taking 22 runs off that over. He judged the length 

of the balls unerringly and despatched it with aplomb. His 67 off 60 balls was 

an innings marked with typical class and grandeur.

Sachin (42 off 43 balls) may have been slightly slow 

off the blocks, but once he found his feet, the runs started flowing around the 

park. Three exquisite boundaries off one Umar Gul over signalled that the little 

champion was ready for the challenge. The openers departed after stitching together 

a partnership of 105, before passing on the baton to Dravid and Yuvraj Singh.

Dravid (56 off 100 balls) was his usual self, but 

Yuvrajs batting on this tour has been a real revelation. With supreme confidence, 

he negotiated everything the bowlers offered him. The self belief and calm assurance 

that his presence in the middle exudes is bound to put the opposition in a quandary. 

His unbeaten 82 off 89 balls is sure to send Woolmer 

scurrying back to the drawing board. His 118-run stand with the captain for the 

third wicket put it beyond Pakistan.

More than the Indian bowling, it was the home batsmens 

ineptitude and wrong shot selection that cost them dear. From the moment Pathan 

lured Salman Butt to edge the second delivery of the day, it seemed that Inzamam-ul 

Haqs decision would backfire.

In slightly overcast conditions, Pathan got the ball 

to move around. That hint of swing was enough as Pathan again got into the act, 

this time Kamran Akmal playing onto his stumps. 

If Pathan inflicted the initial shock, the batsmen 

who followed only complicated matters. Lack of application and terrible running 

between the wickets ? there were four run outs in the Pakistan innings ? simply 

made their job all the more difficult. 

That they still managed to reach 265 was entirely 

due to the superb efforts of Malik and Younis. The pair added 102 runs for the 

fifth wicket that gave the innings some respectability. Malik missed out on another 

century after being dismissed for 90 in Peshawar. That he relishes the Indian 

attack is no secret and his 95 off 110 balls was another reminder of his potential. 

Younis had laid the foundation with his 81, but unfortunately there was none to 

build on it.

The Indians decided to go in with four pacers with 

Sachin and Sehwag sharing the fifth bowlers quota. If Pathan was excellent 

in his opening spell (7-1-27-2), Zaheer Khan failed to sustain the good start 

after removing Inzamam. Ajit Agarkar was hardly penetrative despite the two wickets 

and Sreesanths desire for that extra bit of pace is not paying the dividends.

The real improvement has been the fielding. With increased 

enthusiasm the reaction is more spontaneous and positive and the fielders are 

getting the direct hits on target more often. The trio of Yuvraj, Mohammed Kaif 

and Suresh Raina are proving to be dangerous for the opposition. Even a lethargic 

like Zaheer is throwing his body around in an effort to save that extra run.

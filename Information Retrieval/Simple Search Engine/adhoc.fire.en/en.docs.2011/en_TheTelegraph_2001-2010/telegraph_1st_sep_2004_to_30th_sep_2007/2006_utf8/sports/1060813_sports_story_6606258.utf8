 Constitutional crisis in RCTC 

 STAR RACER

 RCTC: The seat of power

Calcutta: The RCTC is heading 

 for a constitutional crisis with Sujit Bhattacharyya being 

 at the centre of another controversy. 

 Bhattacharyya was understood to have resigned as steward last month after a section of club members had accused the RCTC of financial irregularities pertaining to the sale of the D.L. Khan property, renovation of the office and other dealings.

 Gen. Shankar Roychowdhury, chief steward, officially acknowledged at the July 24 EGM that Bhattacharyya had resigned the previous week. But it was learnt on Saturday that he hadnt actually put in his papers.

 When contacted over phone, Bhattacharyya neither denied nor confirmed his resignation.

 Ill not make any comment on the issue; said Bhattacharyya.

 RCTC secretary Boman Parakh, however, stood by Gen. Roychowdhurys statement on 

 July 24. Ill believe what the chief steward had announced in the EGM about Bhattacharyya; said Parakh.

 Asked whether he had seen Bhattacharyyas resignation letter, Parakh refused to talk.

 Bhattacharyyas comment and Parakhs refusal to talk about the resignation letter say it all. Gen. Roychowdhury was not available for comment.

 The resignation controversy may lead to the stewards body, which includes the co-opted duo of Kishore Bhimani and Cyrus Madan, being rendered null and void. 

 The body is illegal as one of the members hasnt resigned yet; said a club member. Deepak Khaitan was the other steward to have resigned after the first cont-roversy broke.

 It has been learnt that influential members are trying to persuade Bhattacharyya to finally resign.

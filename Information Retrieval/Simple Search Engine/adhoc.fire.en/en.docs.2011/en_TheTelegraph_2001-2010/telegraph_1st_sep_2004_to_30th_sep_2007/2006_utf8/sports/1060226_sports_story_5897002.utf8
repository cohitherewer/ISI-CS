The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Decision on Air India tomorrow

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF will reply to the Air India letter, in which the Mumbai outfit said they would not play an NFL re-match with Fransa Pax, on Monday. 

The NFL fifth-round match had fallen through as Fransa didnt turn up. The AIFF ordered the two teams to play on Thursday, but Air India have refused to play ball. 

The Goa Football Association (GFA), meanwhile, has been asked to go ahead with arrangements for the re-match. 

 Tolly 

 miss trip 

 A Staff Reporter in Calcutta 

 adds: The Tollygunge Agragami squad, scheduled to leave 

 for Bangalore on Saturday to take part in second division 

 NFL, could not board the train as their tickets were not 

 confirmed. 

According to secretary Mantoo Ghosh, AIFF secretary Alberto Colaco was informed, but was not cooperative. Without assistance from the AIFF or the IFA, Tollygunge wont be able to reach Bangalore in time for the opener against HASC on Wednesday. We dont have the finances to travel by air, Ghosh added.

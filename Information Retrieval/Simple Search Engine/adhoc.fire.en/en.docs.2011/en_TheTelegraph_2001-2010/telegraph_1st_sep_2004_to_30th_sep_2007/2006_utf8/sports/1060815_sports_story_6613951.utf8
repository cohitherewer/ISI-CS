Toronto: World No.1 Roger Federer overcame a rocky start to outclass Frenchman Richard Gasquet 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 in the final of the Toronto Masters on Sunday. 

The Swiss, playing his first tournament since defeating Rafael Nadal to lift a fourth consecutive Wimbledon crown, claimed his seventh title this year and the 40th of his career. 

Gasquet, one of the just four players to beat Federer in the last two years, looked set to pull off an upset as he swept through the opening set. The world No.1, however, showed his pedigree as he hit back to take his second Toronto Masters in three years and extend his winning streak on the North American hard courts to 54 matches. 

I fought hard because I had to, Federer told reporters. It was very hard, I started badly and he had a big opportunity at the start of the second set but somehow I got out of it. 

Under blazing sunshine, Federer got his 17th consecutive final off to a positive start, taking the first game to love. 

But the 20-year-old Gasquet, who beat Federer last year at the Monte Carlo Masters, would not be intimidated. He responded by storming through the next five games, committing just two unforced errors compared to a staggering 17 from the world No.1 on the way to wrapping up the first set in 31 minutes. 

Gasquet kept Federer under pressure at the start of the second set and had a triple break point before Federer shifted into another gear to win five straight points and hold serve. 

Federer then broke Gasquet at the first opportunity and served out the set to level the match. The Swiss was in no mood for another surprise defeat by Gasquet and, with the tension mounting in the third set, Federer seized control with a break to go up 3-2. He never loosened his grip after that.

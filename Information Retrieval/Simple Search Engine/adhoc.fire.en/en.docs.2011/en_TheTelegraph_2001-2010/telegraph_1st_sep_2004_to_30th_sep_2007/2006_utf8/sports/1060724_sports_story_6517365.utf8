 Strauss to stay captain

 - Dalrymple in for Flintoff

London: Andrew Strauss will remain captain for the remainder of Englands Test series against Pakistan as Andrew Flintoff prepares to undergo ankle surgery this week. 

But Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney said on Sunday he was confident allrounder Flintoff would be fit for the Ashes starting in November. 

Graveney said medical staff from England and Flintoffs club Lancashire had worked day and night to try to heal the players left ankle without recourse to surgery but a specialist had decided on Saturday an operation was necessary. 

Selectors had named a 14-man squad for the second Test against Pakistan at Old Trafford, which starts on Thursday, as Liam Plunkett had picked up a knock, he added. 

Uncapped off-spinner Jamie Dalrymple was added to the squad in absence of Flintoff. The inclusion of the Middlesex allrounder Dalrymple would give the team more options, Graveney said. 

Flintoff, who took over the captaincy from the injured Michael Vaughan in India this year, missed the first Test against Pakistan which ended in a draw at Lords last Monday and is expected to be out of action for 12 weeks after his operation. 

If fit, he would be expected to lead the team in the Ashes series, which starts in Brisbane on November 23.

 Gary Neville doubtful for Sweden tie

Buhlertal: Injured England right back Gary Neville missed training on Saturday, making him a doubt for their final World Cup Group B game against Sweden in Cologne on Tuesday. 

Neville suffered a calf injury in training on Wednesday. 

An FA spokesman said no decision needed to be taken yet on Nevilles availability for the Sweden game. 

Ukraine midfielder Oleg Gussev did some light training on Saturday, leaving his team hopeful he will be fit for his teams second Group H match against Saudi Arabia. 

Gussev joined midfielder Andriy Vorobey in some light running around the track while the rest of the squad played on the field. 

We dont know for sure if they will play but I dont think either injury is very serious, team spokesman Igor Miroshnyschenko said. 

Miroshnyschenko said Ukraines No. 2 goalkeeper Bogdan Shust was nursing an injured hand. Shust was training lightly. His left hand was heavily bandaged. 

Meanwhile, in Berlin, German central defender Christoph Metzelder twisted his right knee in Saturdays practice and was taken back to the team hotel for treatment. 

German team officials could not immediately say how serious the injury was. The German team had been given off from midday Friday through Saturday evening. 

 All 23 players reported back on time for practice. Metzelder had to break off practice after 50 minutes and his knee was iced before he was driven back to the hotel. 

Tunisias leading striker Francileudo Dos Santos will miss Mondays group H match with Spain and has only a 50 percent chance of playing against Ukraine, the team said on Friday. 

Santos injured his shin in their final friendly against a German select side on June 7 before the tournament began. 

 Meanwhile, Trinidad and Tobago defender Cyd Gray will miss their final Group B match against Paraguay on Tuesday. 

Cyd will be out for at least a week with a partial torn ligament in his upper leg, team spokesman Shaun Fuentes said on Saturday. 

In Freiburg, Philip Cocu and John Heitinga missed The Netherlands first training session on Saturday after the 2-1 win over Ivory Coast. Both players are slightly injured, KNVB media officer Kees Jansma said. Philip (Cocu) has an ankle injury while Heitinga strained his hamstring.

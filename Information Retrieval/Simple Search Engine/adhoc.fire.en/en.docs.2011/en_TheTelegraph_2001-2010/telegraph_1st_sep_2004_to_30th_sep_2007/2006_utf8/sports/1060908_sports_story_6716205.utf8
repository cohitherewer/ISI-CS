 Shot in the arm for JSCA

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Ranchi: The Jharkhand State Cricket Association (JSCA) got a shot in the arm on Thursday after the Jharkhand high court ruled it be allowed to participate in the meetings of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). A division bench of the high court also observed that JSCA and its representatives are entitled to contest BCCI elections and have a right to vote. 

The BCCI has already indicated that it would appeal to the Supreme Court in case the high court verdict went against it. The board elections are scheduled for later this month and the next polls will only be held after an interval of two years.

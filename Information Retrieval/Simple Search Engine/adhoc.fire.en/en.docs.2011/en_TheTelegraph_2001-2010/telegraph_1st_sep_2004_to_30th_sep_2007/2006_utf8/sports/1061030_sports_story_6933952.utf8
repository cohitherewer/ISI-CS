The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Steve Bucknor 3rd to officiate in 150 ODIs 

 - West Indian eyes World Cup final No. 5 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Steve Bucknor 

Calcutta: Steve Bucknor of the West Indies on Sunday became the third umpire to stand in his 150 one-day Internationals. He reached the milestone when he came out along with co-umpire Billy Bowden of New Zealand to officiate the crucial Champions Trophy match between India and Australia in Mohali. 

Englands David Shepherd (156) and Rudi Koertzen of South Africa are the only two umpires to have officiated in more ODIs than the West Indian. 

I never thought I would get this far as, back when I started, there was the chance to stand in just a few matches every year. But now I can look back and think about the ICC Cricket World Cups and many other matches I have umpired and it makes me feel very proud, the 60-year-old Jamaican was quoted as saying by an ICC press release. 

Bucknor has already had quite a few records in his kitty. He has stood in more Test matches 113 than anyone else; he has also officiated in as many as four World Cup finals, and the next World Cup is already at the back of his mind. 

That is an exciting prospect, he said with a smile. It would be nice to stand in final No. 5.

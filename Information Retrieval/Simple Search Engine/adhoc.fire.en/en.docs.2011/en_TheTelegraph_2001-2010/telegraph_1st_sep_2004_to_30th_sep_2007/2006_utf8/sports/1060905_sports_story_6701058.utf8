 Sreesanth will emerge even stronger

Bangalore: Expressing hope that Sreesanth, who has been dropped for the ICC Champions Trophy, would stage a comeback and emerge even stronger, coach Greg Chappell has asked the Kerala mediumpacer to convert the setback into an opportunity. 

Sometimes, what seems like a setback could be a benefit because it gives him (Sreesanth) a chance to go away and work on a few things that we have had him work on already, Chappell said here on Monday. 

I have no doubt that Sreesanth has a choice. I told him in the morning that he could either let it (the omission) take him down or he can let it act as a boost. Thankfully, he has got a very good attitude and he can only get stronger, the former Australia captain said. Thats what it is, just a setback. He will come back. Chappell admitted it could be frustrating for a player (when he is dropped). Whoever missed out would have been unlucky because they all have done some really good work and Sreesanth is improving all the time. (PTI)

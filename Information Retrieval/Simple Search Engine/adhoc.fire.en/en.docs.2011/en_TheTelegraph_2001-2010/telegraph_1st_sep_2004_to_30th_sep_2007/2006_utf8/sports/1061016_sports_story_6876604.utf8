 Chopra third

Las Vegas: Daniel Chopra waded through heavy traffic and flooded streets to barely make his tee time and then shot a flawless eight-under 64, the best round of the day, to be the clubhouse leader at 15-under at frys.com Open. 

Chopras 8-under third round at TPC Summerlin gave him a total of 200, but overall he was lying third. 

Arjun Atwal also finished his third round and came up with a bogey-free five-under 67 that put him at tied 14th. (PTI)

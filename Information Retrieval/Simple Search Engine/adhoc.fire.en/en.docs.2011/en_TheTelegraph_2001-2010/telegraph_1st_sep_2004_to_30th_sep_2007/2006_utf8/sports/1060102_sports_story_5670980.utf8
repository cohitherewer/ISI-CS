 Negi Indias youngest IM

Hastings: Parimarjan Negi became the youngest International Master of the country with a fantastic victory over Grandmaster Sergei Erenburg of Israel in the fourth round of the masters section of Hastings International Chess Congress here. 

Twelve-year-old Negi, who had been on the verge of getting the IM title for quite some time, finally made the grade as he now stands to gain a staggering 30 Elo rating points from the first four rounds of this event. Negi also remained in joint lead and now has 3.5 points out of a possible four. 

Earlier, in the second round, Negi had beaten English GM Mark Hebden, while in the third he had drawn with higher rated IM Jean Pierre Le Roux of France. (PTI)

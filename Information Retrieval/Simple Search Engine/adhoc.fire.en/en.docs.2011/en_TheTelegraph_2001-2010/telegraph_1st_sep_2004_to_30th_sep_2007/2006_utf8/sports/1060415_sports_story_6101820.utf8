 Nellys prospect excites top Indian official

 - It will be a great achievement for female referees all over the world: Bentla 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: For Bentla DCoth, Indias most experienced female Fifa referee, the fitness and skills test for the 82 assistant referees to be held in Frankfurt and Neu-Isenburg from April 18 to 21 will be a more thrilling affair than the actual World Cup, to be played from June 9. 

I will not be present there physically, but will surely try to keep track of things, said Bentla from Kochi. It will be a great achievement for all female referees around the world if Nelly Viennot succeeds in getting into the final list of assistant referees for the World Cup. 

Bentla, who is considered one of Asias best female referees, is not far from the truth. For three days from Tuesday, the world will be watching the 44-year-old Frenchwoman who could become the first lineswoman at a World Cup. 

There is certainly excitement about the possibility that she could be the first female assistant referee in the World Cup, Fifa spokesman Andreas Werz said. But we want to underscore the fact that she is not going to be at the workshop because she is a woman and we want to have a woman. 

Rather she is coming because of the fact that she is good enough to be among the best assistants in the world, Werz added. 

Like the Fifa spokesman, Bengals Chaitali Pal also insists that there is no reason to stress on the fact that Nelly Viennot is a woman who is trying to force her way into the mans world. A referee is supposed to do the job according to the laws of the game. It is the technical ability of a person that matters at the end, not the sex, said Chaitali, who has graduated to the Fifa level only last year. 

There are a lot of people who are backing Nelly at the moment, but the excellent French assistant referee, known for her human and sporting qualities, had to fight her way up in this rather macho world of refereeing. She has been in the business since 1996, and the housewifes biggest achievement is that she has managed to officiate in matches without anybody referring to her sex. 

Why should one? asks Bentla. Does anyone at Frankfurt allow her to take advantage of the fact that she is a woman? 

She will be subjected to the same skills and fitness tests that the other 81 men will go through. Then why this talk of discrimination? 

The allegation of discrimination was levelled against Nelly only once when she was badly hit by fireworks during a match just a couple of days before last Christmas. Nelly dropped to the ground after being hit and had to be carried out by a stretcher. As her two children started crying, the referee had to call off the match. 

While some people were quick to criticise the fact that the substitute referee had failed to take over Nellys role, others claimed that had this happened to a man, he would have bounced back and the players should not have had to pay for such irresponsible behaviour by the spectators. 

What these people failed to understand was that it was not being a man or a woman that made the difference. 

The life of a referee or a player is always more important than a tournament, be it the national competition or the World Cup. No one bothered about the fact that the hit left Nelly hard of hearing temporarily.

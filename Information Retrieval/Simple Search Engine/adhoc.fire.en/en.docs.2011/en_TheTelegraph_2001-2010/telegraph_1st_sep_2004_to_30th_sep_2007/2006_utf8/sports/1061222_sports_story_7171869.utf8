 Sachin, Lara best of my era

Melbourne: Champion leg-spinner Shane Warne on Thursday said Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara had been the toughest to bowl to in his 15-year international career which will come to an end after the fifth Ashes Test next month. 

Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara are the two best batsmen of my era. I think those two guys have been the toughest at international level, said Warne, Test crickets highest wicket-taker with 699 scalps. 

On Lara, the 37-year-old bowler said, I cannot believe it, its just amazing his placement in cricket. He can dominate a game, as weve seen over the years, no matter whos bowling. 

Warne, who once admitted having nightmares about Sachin dancing down the track to thrash him, said he was amazed how the Indian managed to carry the expectations of a billion people on his shoulder. 

I really admire Sachin for what he has to go through everyday in India, with a billion people wanting him to do well, he said. 

Theres 50,000 people outside the stadium and when he walks up to bat they all charge in. One of the hardest things when youve been a successful player is everybody elses expectations, they can wear you down after a while. 

Warne pointed out Australias loss to Sri Lanka in 1996 as the lowest point of his career. 

The Adelaide win which gave Australia the coveted Ashes this season, and the 1992 Test against Sri Lanka where Warne helped his team to a comeback win were rated as high points.

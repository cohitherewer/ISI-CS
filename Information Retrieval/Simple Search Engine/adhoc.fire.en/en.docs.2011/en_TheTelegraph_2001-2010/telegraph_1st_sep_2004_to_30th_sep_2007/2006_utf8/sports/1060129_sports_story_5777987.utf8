The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav in with a chance

 - ODI SERIES 4 - from Test squad certain to go back 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Karachi: Sourav Ganguly is in with a chance 

of making his one-day comeback, too, in Pakistan. The Team India squad for the 

five-match series is to be chosen on Sunday, via a tele-conference, and the former 

captain will almost surely be there if 16 are picked. 

Till late on Saturday, though, nobody here could confirm whether the squad is going to be 15 or 16-strong. Ive asked (chief selector) Kiran More for a clarification, is all that Easts representative on the selection committee, Ranjib Biswal, could say. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, three of 

the five selectors have already had a discussion among themselves and arent 

disinclined towards Sourav. However, the views of captain Rahul Dravid 

and coach Greg Chappell will probably count the most ? largely because the focus 

is on the 2007 World Cup. 

Sourav, it may be recalled, hasnt played a single ODI after the tri-series in Zimbabwe. Once home, he wasnt available for the first two of the 12 matches (against Sri Lanka and South Africa) and, then, wasnt considered for the rest. 

As of now, four from the Test squad ? Anil Kumble, V. V. S. Laxman, Wasim Jaffer and Parthiv Patel ? are certain to go back after the face-off at the National Stadium, beginning on Sunday. Mohammed Kaif, Murali Kartik, Suresh Raina and S. Sreesanth are expected to come over. 

The Test squad, of course, has 16.

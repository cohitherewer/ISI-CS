 Jyoti Randhawa ends tied 58th

Wentworth: Jyoti Randhawa finished with a one-over 73 on the final day of the BMW Championships at the Wentworth Golf Club on Sunday. 

Randhawa was tied for 58th with a total of four-over 292. Earlier, in the third round, he carded a four-over 76 with two double bogeys. 

In his final round, Randhawa had a birdie on the second and then three bogeys from the third to fifth to turn in a two-over. On the back nine, he birdied 10th and 16th and dropped a shot on the 11th for a total of 73. 

Earlier, Jeev Milkha Singh had missed the cut after two rounds. Britains David Howell increased his lead on Europes Order of Merit with a runaway victory in the PGA Championship at Wentworth on Sunday. 

The Englishman went into the final round on Sunday with a three-shot lead and was never threatened as he closed with a three-under-par 69 for a 17-under-par 271 total. 

He finished five strokes ahead of Britains Simon Khan with Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez a further shot back. 

After shooting a 65 in bad weather on Saturday, Jimenez, his closest rival overnight, had been expected to run Howell close. Three birdies in four holes from the second by Howell, though, and bogeys on the sixth and ninth by the Spaniard, effectively ended the event as a contest. 

Khan stepped in to shoot a 68 and claim second place, with Jimenez treading water with a 72. Howells $903,000 win, his career fourth and his biggest, is his second of the season, adding to his Champions Tournament success last November when he beat world No. 1 Tiger Woods for the title in China. 

 Jeev stays in lead 

Meanwhile, Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh continued to lead the way on the UBS Order of Merit with $441,758 in his kitty after nine events despite missing out at the Philippines Open last week. 

Rising star Park Jun-Won, who finished as the runner-up in Manila on Sunday, walked home with $21,700 and broke into the top-60 on the Order of Merit in 57th position.

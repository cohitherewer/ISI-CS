 Sonn to attend inauguration

OUR CORRESPONDENT

 BCCI Function 

Chandigarh: The International Cricket Council president Percy Sonn will be present at the inauguration of the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai on Saturday. I will attend the inauguration... I met Sharad Pawar and other officials in India and am quite happy with their vision, he said on Wednesday. 

There were a lot of apprehensions about Sonn attending the function, especially in the light of the BCCI deciding to invite its banned former captain Mohammed Azharuddin. We had discussed regarding attending the event. I am happy with Sonns decision to attend the function. I know many of the former captains will be attending the event and it will be a great opportunity to meet up with them, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed added. 

Azhar, incidentally, was present in nearby Mohali, as a guest of the Punjab Cricket Association, to watch Wednesdays semi-final. 

Speed reiterated again that the BCCI had to go through the laid-down procedures to revoke Azhars ban. The process for appealing against a ban is in place. The process was ratified by the executive board of the ICC in 2004 and BCCI was represented in all of those four meetings where the decision took place. The decision was well documented and sent to them. There is no mystery about it. Former Pakitsan pacer Ata-ur Rehman has already made an application under this process so that he could play again for his country. 

Sonn offered support. The ICC doesnt run its members boards domestic affairs. As far as we are concerned Azhars status remains the same. We will have to follow the process if his ban has to be lifted. 

On the contentious Members Participation Agreement, the ICC didnt see any major trouble in resolving the issues. We had meetings in the past with the sub-committees of the BCCI regarding the issues. We have been briefed about it and I must say they are not substantial issues. We will discuss the same at the Executive Board meeting on November 3 and 4 in Mumbai and look to move forward. 

We accept BCCIs observations and some points will be reviewed and then the draft would again be sent to all the members for their approval. It was disappointing that India didnt raise the issue in April. There is no deadline for the countries to sign the MPA, but we would like to get it done as soon as possible, Speed said.

 Hari keeps sole lead

Paks (Hungary): Top seed Grandmaster P. Harikrishna maintained sole lead in the third Marx Gyorgy Memorial International Chess tournament with an easy draw with Hungarian GM Ferenc Berkes in the fourth round here on Tuesday. 

On a day when two games provided results, Harikrishnas match was the only one that ended in a draw and even though defending champion Zoltan Almasi of Hungary came back to winning ways along with Ukrainian Zahar Efimenko, the Indian remained atop the tables with three points after four games. 

With six rounds to come in the category-15 double round robin event, both Efimenko and Almasi trail Harikrishna on 2.5 points while Wang Yue of China and Berkes are joint fourth with two points apiece.

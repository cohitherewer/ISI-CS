Calcutta: The Football Players Association of India (FPAI) is not looking towards any confrontation with the AIFF in its quest to protect the players interests, but wants to impart proper advice to them while spreading the game to the grassroots level and adhering to the social cause. 

At the formal launch of the FPAI at a city hotel on Sunday, Bhaichung Bhutia, one of the four directors, spelt out its objectives. The association is here to work in tandem with the various clubs, state associations and the AIFF. We would like to ensure that players are treated fairly and future generation of players has a better support system in place. 

FPAI will function as a parent body of the players while educating them and providing them with proper advice and counselling by engaging professionals, if necessary. The association would also organise coaching camps in different communities as well as rural areas. 

Bhaichung also expressed his gratitude to the AIFF and the state associations. I am not aware if a formal affiliation is required for the FPAI from the AIFF. However, we plan to work together. I will be happy if the AIFF and state associations utilise FPAI for mutual benefit. It would be nice if the FPAI has representatives in the AIFF and state associations to take the game forward. 

Asked if the FPAI would take up player burnout issues and the recent transfer imbroglio involving players like Syed Rahim Nabi and M. Suresh, Bhaichung said: We want to suggest various measures to the AIFF for development of the game. We dont want to get into any confrontation. As regards the transfer imbroglio, the players have to approach us and only then can we suggest a course of action. 

Raman Vijayan, Deepak Mondal and S. Venkatesh will be the other directors of FPAI, while former India goalkeeper Sumit Mukherjee will be the CEO. There will also be regional heads. 

Allahabad Bank has agreed to a one-year sponsorship contract, but as Bhaichung emphasised, the FPAI was also looking for support from other corporate houses. 

The immediate plans involve organising charity/exhibition matches for needy former players. A pension scheme for the needy is also on the anvil. 

But where does Bhaichung see the FPAI in the long run given the fact that most such player bodies in Indian sport have failed to survive the test of time? 

Weve just started it and would want to go ahead positively Were not setting any time frame. We want to work hard with support from the media and sponsors, was the stars optimistic response.

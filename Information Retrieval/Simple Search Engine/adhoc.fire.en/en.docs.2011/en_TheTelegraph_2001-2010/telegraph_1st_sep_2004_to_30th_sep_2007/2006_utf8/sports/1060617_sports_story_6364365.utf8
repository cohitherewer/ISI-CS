The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well prove ourselves, says Villa 

Kamen: Spain striker David Villa said the 4-0 demolition of Ukraine in their opening match has proved they are serious contenders to win the World Cup. 

There were people who doubted our ability and we were all very keen to show that Spain has a great team and can aspire to everything, the Valencia player told his clubs website on Friday. 

We were always confident in our ability, we knew what we could do and we will prove that we can do it again. 

Villa, the top-scoring Spaniard in the Primera Liga last season with 25 goals, struck twice against Ukraine and has scored four times in nine appearances for Spain. 

I knew Id be able to hold my head up high and perform well and with a bit of luck everything would work out well, he said.

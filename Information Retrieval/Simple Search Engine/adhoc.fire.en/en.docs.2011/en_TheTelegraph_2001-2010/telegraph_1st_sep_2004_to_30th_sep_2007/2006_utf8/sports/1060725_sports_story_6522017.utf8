 Top cueists against BSFI rule

 Advani doesnt agree with BSFIs one-man-one-discipline rule 

New Delhi: A resentment seems to be brewing among top cueists of the country despite Billiards and Snooker Players Association and the national federation ? BSFI ? amicably agreeing on one man one discipline rule for the Asian Games. 

The rule allows a player to represent only in one discipline and if he or she qualifies in more events, the place has to be forfeited to the next best player. 

The rule, which was introduced in 2002 edition, was discussed at length after the nationals and before the beginning of the qualifiers for the Asian Games by players and the federation and it was unanimously agreed to be continued with, so as not to affect Indias medal prospects. 

The federation believes if a player participates in more than one discipline, his performance could be affected and a bad performance in one event could also influence the medal prospects in other events. 

But players do not agree. Players say they are putting in all the effort to qualify and they are able to manage it in the finals as well. Rather under-strength representation could cost the country medals. 

Former world billiards and snooker champion Pankaj Advani feels if a player is adept in more than one discipline, there is no reason to deny him a chance as an under-strength representation any way has less medal prospects. 

It does affect the medal tally. You apply logic to this, if Manan Chandra is doing well in both 8-ball and 9-ball pool and going though the grind why he should not be given chance, especially if he is talented enough, Advani said. 

That includes me and Ashok Shandilya also, he added. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barua, Negi among 7 leaders

 Holland Chess

 Vlissingen (The Netherlands): 

 Grandmaster Dibyendu Barua scored a hard fought victory 

 over International Master Perez Rodney of Cuba to take the 

 joint lead after the seventh round of the Hogeschool Zeeland 

 International Open chess tournament here.

 It turned out to be another good 

 outing for Parimarjan Negi as he held higher ranked GM Friso 

 Nijboer of The Netherlands to an easy draw to remain in 

 joint lead after the top four boards failed to yield results 

 despite tough fights.

 With just two rounds to go in 

 the nine-round Swiss event, as many as seven players are 

 joint leaders with six points each out of a possible seven. 

 They include GM Vyacheslkav Ikonnikov of Russia, GM Michal 

 Krasenkow of Poland, GM Erwin LAmi of The Netherlands, 

 IM Mikhail Klenburg of Ukraine, Nijboer, Barua and Negi.

 In the penultimate round, it is 

 going to be tough fight for Negi as he meets second seed 

 Krasenkow, while Barua will take on Nijboer in what is expected 

 to be a bloody battle.

 IM-in-waiting Saptarshi Roy and 

 IM Roktim Bandyopadhyay scored over Dutch rivals Zomer Koos 

 and Plukkel Sjoerd, respectively while IM Saptarshi Roy 

 Chowdhury was held by Matthieu Freeke. 

 Things unfolded quite dramatically 

 in the game between Barua and Rodney wherein the Indian 

 played with white pieces. It was an Italian opening by Barua 

 that only gave a minimal advantage and Rodney was quite 

 up to the task in exchanging pieces at regular intervals.

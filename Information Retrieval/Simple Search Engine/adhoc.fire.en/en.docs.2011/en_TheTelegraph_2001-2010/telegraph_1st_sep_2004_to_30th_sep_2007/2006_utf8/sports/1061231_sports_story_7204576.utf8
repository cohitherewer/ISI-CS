 Proteas pack a fatal punch

Durban: The euphoria of the historic win in Johannesburg gave way to utter despair as India surrendered meekly to give South Africa a series-levelling 174-run victory in the second Test here on Saturday. 

Set a stiff 354-run target, the fragile Indian batting line-up caved in to be dismissed for 179 in 55.1 overs, about 45 minutes after tea on the fifth and final day at Kingsmead. 

Makhaya Nitini (5/48) brought the trembling visitors on their knees with devastating exhibition of fast bowling, which completely rattled the Indians who had just to bat out the day to save the game and retain their 1-0 advantage. 

A delayed start and overcast conditions in the morning raised Indias hopes of saving the Test, having been two wickets down overnight, but the sun filtered through the clouds to allow just enough overs for the hosts to finish their job. 

The teams would now travel to Cape Town for the series decider on Tuesday. 

Resuming at 38 for two, India were rocked straightaway, losing both the overnight batsmen Sachin Tendulkar (0) and Wasim Jaffer (28) in quick succession to be reduced to 47 for four, a position from where they failed to recover, although the tailenders did their best to thwart the hosts. 

Both Tendulkar, who top-scored in the first innings with 63, and Jaffer were dismissed by Ntini in his consecutive overs. 

Tendulkar departed in Ntinis first over when he failed to bring his bat down in time and was beaten for pace by an incoming delivery. He failed to get off the mark and India were a wicket down without any addition. 

Jaffer began in style from the other end, flicking a delivery from Shaun Pollock to square leg fence but in Ntinis next over, was out playing a horrendous shot. 

India lost four wickets in the extended afternoon session, starting with Sourav Ganguly, who began aggressively and made 26 in quick time before guiding a lifting Ntini delivery into gully, giving the South African quick his fifth wicket of the innings. 

V.V.S. Laxman (15) followed him soon after as he went back to Andre Nel (3/57) and missed it completely to be bowled for 15. 

Anil Kumble defended stoutly for his 11 and batted for nearly an hour before the introduction of Andrew Hall ejected him from the middle. 

Hall sent down an awkward bouncer at Kumble and he could do no better than lob it to Hashim Amla. 

India then produced some rearguard action via Mahendra Singh Dhoni (47), who staved off the rampaging Proteas for a while. 

The wicketkeeper-batsman put on 59 runs for the eighth wicket before being dismissed in the last over before tea break. 

Dhoni, seeking to reach his half century, made an attempt to play a forcing stroke against Nel and edged it to keeper Mark Boucher. 

Zaheer Khan (21) then showed admirable defence and tenacity in batting for over an hour but once Dhoni was out in the last over before tea, the die was cast in the favour of the hosts. 

As clouds began to gather in the final session, India started using the option of consuming time. Both Zaheer and Sreesanth (10) took a lot of time in taking guard and moving to their appointed places between the overs. 

When Sreesanth was hit on his forearm by Ntini and the attendance from teams physio which took up a fair bit of time, it seemed to irritate the host captain Graeme Smith no end. Sreesanth even received a word from the two umpires in this regard. 

But the hosts were not be stopped as Zaheer edged into the slip cordon off Nel, bringing an end to his 56-ball vigil at the wicket. 

Meanwhile umpire Mark Benson has been discherged from the hospital.

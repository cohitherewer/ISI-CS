 Starting a new life: Barthez

Paris: Goalkeeper Fabien Barthez announced his retirement from soccer, three months after helping France reach its second world cup final. I am starting a new life, Barthez said. I will continue to enjoy myself. But without soccer. 

Some goalkeepers continue until 37 or 38, the 35-year-old Barthez said on Thursday. But I needed a human adventure, something like that. 

Barthez, who helped France win the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship, is not attached to a club and has not played since July 9, when the French lost a shootout to Italy in the World Cup final (as reported in Fridays Late City edition). 

Regarded as a superb shot-stopper but prone to eccentric moments, Barthez made 87 international appearances for France including a national record 17 over three World Cups. 

France coach Raymond Domenech chose Barthez as his starting goalkeeper at this years tournament in Germany ahead of Gregory Coupet, and he played in all seven of Frances games. (Agencies)

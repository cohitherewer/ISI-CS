The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I took the right decision: Inzamam

London: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq said he made the right decision at The Oval last month, when his team was adjudged to have forfeited the fourth Test, even though his punishment means he will miss the Champions Trophy. 

Inzamam was on Thursday cleared of ball-tampering charges but found guilty of bringing the game into disrepute over his sides refusal to continue play against England. 

I knew I was going to be in trouble when I made the protest, Inzamam told a website. 

It was not a decision I took easily, because nobody wants to prevent the spectators from watching cricket both at the ground and on television. 

Even so and despite the fact that Pakistan became the first team in Test history to forfeit a match Inzamam does not believe he did the wrong thing. 

I dont regret making the decision to stay off the field because there are certain things more important than winning and losing or the rule book, he said. 

I felt the respect and integrity of my country as being questioned, so the support that I have received in this issue has been comforting. It told me that we were right to do what we did. 

If we had just carried on with the game, the world would not have sat up and taken notice of how we had been accused of something we were not guilty of, he said. 

We felt we had to stand up and protest. Ultimately, I understand the ICCs decision to ban me. I did what I felt was right and so did they, the Pakistan captain maintained.

 Shastri: Of the present lot, Fleming is the best

 Trophy 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ravi Shastri 

Chandigarh: Circumstances ensured that Ravi Shastri didnt get to captain in more than one Test and 11 ODIs, but the limited opportunities were enough for him to make a terrific impression. India won that Test (against the West Indies, early 1988) and, not much later, a one-day tournament in Sharjah as well. Its a matter of debate whether a longer run for Shastri wouldve changed the face of Indian cricket. Today, hes a much respected commentator and is known not to mince words. Shastri, who played 80 Tests (3,830 runs and 151 wickets) and 150 ODIs (3,108 runs and 129 wickets), recently spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on captaincy. 

The following are excerpts 

On the qualties a captain should have 

 First, he must be able to hold 

 his place in the side... On merit, he should walk into the 

 XI... Then, he must be a good reader of the sport... A keen 

 student, so that he knows what tactics to employ 

 in tight situations... On the field, it can get lonely and 

 a captain may quickly run out of ideas Also, he has to 

 possess good man management skills... He has got to understand 

 the mindset of his players so that he can get the best out 

 of them. Having said all that, he has to remember hes 

 the boss and have the conviction to go by his gut feelings 

 and have the guts to stand by the decisions taken. Another 

 quality, because of the Medias growth, is the ability 

 to handle you all... If the team hasnt done well, 

 then the captain should take the rap. If the team has done 

 well, he must demand accolades. 

 On whether captains in 

 India need special skills

 (Grins) Well, because of our diversity 

 and the number of languages, man management is probably 

 most important. A captain, for example, has to ensure that 

 players coming from the smaller cities dont carry 

 a complex... That they quickly gel with the rest in the 

 dressing room. Be it a captain in India or elsewhere, he 

 shouldnt be scared of ruffling feathers. 

 On whether he had a role 

 model captain

 Ian Chappell... I loved his style... 

 He was aggressive and would leave no stone unturned in going 

 for a win... Of course, he played hard, but was fair and 

 did things within the laws... Ian was all for a fast and 

 aggressive game and I loved that... He knew how to get the 

 best out of his players and the best out of himself. Perhaps, 

 I dont need to add that he led from the front... 

 On whether he admired 

 any one captain during his days as an India cricketer (1981-1992) 

 Imran Khan... Even if he wasnt 

 the greatest tactician, he was a tremendous motivator and 

 led by example... Imran was so passionate that he gave the 

 impression about eating, sleeping and dreaming cricket... 

 Besides all that, he had the ability quite like Sourav 

 Ganguly to spot and groom talent... Thats going 

 to remain Imran;s greatest contribution to Pakistan. 

 On the Indian captain 

 he would give the highest marks

 Its a tough one... Very 

 tough... (After a pause) Of the captains I played 

 under, it will probably be Sunil Gavaskar... He didnt 

 exactly have a match-winning attack... He was a good tactician, 

 but didnt have the bowlers to take 20 wickets (in 

 a Test)... I didnt play under Tiger Pataudi, 

 but he was very shrewd and, by all accounts, made best use 

 of the resources at his disposal.... Again, I didnt 

 play under Ajit Wadekar, but one cant forget the back-to-back 

 wins in the West Indies and England (1970-71). A shrewd 

 tactician, Wadekar understood the strength of his players 

 and moved forward accordingly... (Again, after a pause) 

 Kapil Dev was instinctive... Sourav had his strengths... 

 He had his style, but his batting went down in the last 

 year or so of his captaincy (which ended in September 2005) 

 and, as a result, even his captaincy suffered... The truth 

 of the matter is that he remained in the team only because 

 he was the captain... He had a personality, though, and 

 there were times when he did a good job of leading from 

 the front... I personally feel Sourav ought to have given 

 up the captaincy after the tour of Zimbabwe incidentally, 

 the last time he captained and made himself available 

 as an ordinary player. 

 On the ideal relationship 

 between the captain and coach 

 Has to be on the lines of what 

 Bob Woolmer said (earlier this year) Im the 

 captains right-hand man... The coach is there 

 to show the path... The boss, both in the dressing room 

 and outside, has to be the captain. Hes the Commanding 

 Officer and, so, has to call the shots... The coach puts 

 the template in place, thats it. 

 On the captains (alphabetically) in the Champions Trophy proper 

 Rahul Dravid (India): 

 Hes a good student of the game, but I would like him 

 to stamp his authority... His personality must come to the 

 fore... Perhaps, its a matter of time... Indeed, being 

 the captain, he has to roll the dice a little more and announce 

 his presence. 

 Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), 

 who is hours away from becoming the captain to have led 

 in the most number of ODIs 194: Of the present lot, hes 

 the best captain... Hes a great package... A good 

 thinker, a fine batsman and an excellent communicator both 

 within the team and outside... Fleming, for example, handles 

 the Media very well... Unfortunately, he hasnt had 

 a bowling side of any strength or else New Zealand wouldve 

 been winning a lot more. 

 Andrew Flintoff (England): 

 Hes pretty new to the job, but is instinctive and 

 wants to stamp his personality... He wants to be involved 

 totally... Batting, bowling (though he cant do that 

 right now), fielding... Thats never easy. Early days, 

 but its not beyond Flintoff to be a captain who is 

 consistently good. 

 Mahela Jayawardene (Sri 

 Lanka): Very promising... Is a sharp thinker and 

 a good communicator who commands the respect of his players. 

 Under pressure (as captain), he has played very important 

 innings and thats a good sign... Captaincy hasnt 

 affected him... Jayawardene, in my opinion, is in the Fleming 

 mould. 

 Younis Khan (Pakistan): 

 Hes going to be a better captain than Inzamam-ul 

 Haq... Hes a quick thinker, hes aggressive... 

 Hes right on the button and makes things happen... 

 Theres more energy on the field when Younis is captain... 

 Inzy, at times, gives the impression hes bored and 

 allows the game to drift. Younis doesnt allow his 

 mind to wander. 

 Brian Lara (West Indies): 

 Great tactician... That hes an extraordinary thinker 

 becomes evident when you study some of his moves... However, 

 he expects too much from his bowlers without realising theyre 

 really not that good enough. Theres no point aiming 

 very high when you dont have the ammunition to get 

 there. Lara sets high standards for himself and expects 

 the rest to match him... Cant always be done... Viv 

 Richards, to my mind, occasionally had the same problem. 

 Ricky Ponting (Australia): 

 Likes to lead from the front... He could improve as a tactician 

 but, over the past few years, has been outstanding with 

 the bat. This tournament is a test for him... Next years 

 World Cup will be no different... Im sure he has learnt 

 a lot from the loss of the Ashes (in 2005)... Ricky is a 

 solid captain, but theres room to get better. I think 

 (coach) John Buchanan has been a terrific ally. 

 Graeme Smith (South Africa): 

 Another one with the potential to be a very good captain... 

 He leads from the front and is bound to have more success 

 if he gets a strike bowler to partner Makhaya Ntini. Hes 

 just 25 and has already been captain for over three years. 

 Clearly, Smith is going to improve. 

 Finally, his message to 

 rookie captains 

 Read about the game, talk to senior 

 cricketers... Half the battle will be won if you quickly 

 grasp the temperament of your players... Be positive and 

 look to win... Youre going to be in trouble if your 

 approach is such that you start looking for a draw... You 

 should only release positive energy.

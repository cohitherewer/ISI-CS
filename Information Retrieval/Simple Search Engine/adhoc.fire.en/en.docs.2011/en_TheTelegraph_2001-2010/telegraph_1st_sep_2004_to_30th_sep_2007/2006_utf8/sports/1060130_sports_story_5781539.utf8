 Chanda holds top seed Shirov

Gibraltar: Grandmaster Sandipan Chanda continued with his impressive run as he held the top seeded Alexei Shirov of Spain in the fifth round of the Gibtele.Com Masters Chess tournament at the Caleta Hotel here. 

Former British Championship winner Abhijit Kunte and national womens champion Nisha Mohota were amongst other Indians who faired excellently in this round of the tournament which carries a winners purse of ?6000. 

Kunte drew with second seed GM Vladimir Akopian of Armenia and WGM Nisha got the better of GM Milos Pavlovich of Serbia. 

Meanwhile, at the top of the tables, two near-veterans Kiril Georgiev of Bulgaria and Janathan Speelman of England emerged as joint leaders with comprehensive victories over Martinez Arizmendi of Spain and Mikhail Gurevich of Turkey, respectively. 

Both Georgiev and Speelman took their tally to 4.5 points at the half way stage of this 10-round event and will clash in the next round now. 

A pack of six players including 74-year-old Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland is breathing down the neck of the leaders on four points.

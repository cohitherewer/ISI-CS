London: Arsenal and Liverpool both came back from a goal down to salvage 1-1 draws as the English Premiership kicked off with a bang on Saturday. 

The two title-hopefuls had the chance to send a message to champions Chelsea, who start their campaign on Sunday, but the Blues would have seen nothing to suggest they cannot make it three titles in a row. 

In their first Premiership match at the new Emirates Stadium, Arsenal drew with Aston Villa, while Liverpool had to rely on a highly dubious penalty to rescue a point at newly-promoted Sheffield United. 

Elsewhere, Reading pulled off a magnificent 3-2 win over Middlesbrough, Newcastle defeated Wigan 2-1 and Portsmouth beat Blackburn 3-0 at home. Villas Swedish defender Olof Mellberg headed the first Premiership goal at the Emirates Stadium to stun the hosts. 

The Gunners teenaged starlet Theo Walcott, controversially included in Englands World Cup squad, made his first Arsenal appearance from the bench. 

But the striker could not salvage the situation as Arsenal piled on the pressure. 

Midfielder Gilberto equalised in the 84th minute from the far post, hammering the ball past villa goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen. 

Liverpool, who also have designs on winning the title, were only saved from the embarrassment of an opening day defeat at Bramall Lane thanks to a curious penalty decision. The Reds were guilty of slack marking just after the interval when Rob Hulse was left unmarked to head a shock goal for the hosts. 

But when Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard stumbled in the box, referee Rob Styles awarded a penalty and Robbie Fowler scored with ease from the spot. 

In their first match in the top flight, Reading pulled off a stunning comeback against last seasons beaten Uefa Cup finalists Middlesbrough at the Madejski Stadium. 

Stuart Downing put the visitors ahead after 11 minutes and Yakubu scored from a loose ball 10 minutes later. 

But Reading fought back and the impressive South Korea winger Seol Ki-Hyeon set up Dave Kitson to score two minutes before the break and Steve Sidwell equalised a minute later. 

Leroy Lita scored in the 55th minute to hand Reading an impressive start to life in the Premiership. 

Portsmouth beat visitors Blackburn 3-0 at Fratton Park, with Nigerian international Nwankwo Kanu, who only joined the south coast club on Thursday, scoring two late goals in a keenly-fought match. 

Newcastle, still desperately seeking a striker to fill in for the retired Alan Shearer and the injured Michael Owen, beat Wigan 2-1 thanks to a rare goal from captain Scott Parker and a tap-in from stand-in striker Shola Ameobi. 

Parker scored in the 38th minute but Lee McCulloch equalised for Wigan. But Ameobi won the match, pouncing to knock in a rebound in the 64th minute. (AFP)

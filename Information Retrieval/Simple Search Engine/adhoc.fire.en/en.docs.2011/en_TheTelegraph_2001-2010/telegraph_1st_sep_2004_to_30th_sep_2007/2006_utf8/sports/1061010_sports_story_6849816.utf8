Bangalore: Stay positive, this remains Bob Houghtons mantra ahead of Indias AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Japan on Wednesday. 

The Englishmans stint with India has not gone well so far, having lost to Saudi Arabia 0-3 and 1-7 at home and away, respectively. Still, the India coach has insisted that Japan can be countered only through a positive attitude. 

It is a tough task against Japan. It is tough to play against a good team, Houghton told reporters here. 

But if the boys try to be positive and play a positive game, we can win it. We have to play like compact team against Japan, who play a skilful game, Houghton added. 

India have already lost four matches in the qualifying round and their last match will be against Yemen on November 15. 

Replying to query on the packed schedule of players, he admitted that currently, they were hardly getting any rest, but refused to be drawn into a debate on the issue. 

After Wednesdays match, the players will feature in Santosh Trophy, Federation Cup and National League. 

Meanwhile, Mehrajudin Wadao, who has been injured, will be replaced by N.P. Pradeep, Houghton informed. 

Japan, who have already qualified from Group A with Saudi Arabia, did not want to be complacent against India 

 Since India are progressing well, they can try to put more pressure on us, Japan coach Ivica Osim said. 

Osim also referred to Indias performance against Saudi Arabia, saying that Houghtons men played well in the first-half in both encounters. There is a progress in Indias performance, he said. (PTI)

 Inzamam, Akmal runaway winners

 - PCB to give three more awards from next year 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Karachi: Inzamam-ul Haq and Kamran Akmal have been adjudged the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Player of the Year and Emerging Player of the Year for 2005, respectively. This is a first in these parts and, from edition No.2, three more awards will be given. 

The awards are expected to be presented either on the eve of the fifth and final ODI here (February 19) or on the match day itself. 

Actually, its hardly a surprise that the jury chaired by Lt Gen. (retd) Tariq Wasim Gazi chose the regular captain and the star wicketkeeper. Former captain Zaheer Abbas was on the panel of selectors. 

According to Gen. Gazi, the jury didnt only go by cold statistics but looked at the overall contribution. For example, acting as a role model and respecting the spirit of the game. Also, showing a high degree of enthusiasm towards the larger cause. 

While Inzamam is to get Rs 5 lakh, Akmal is going to be richer by Rs 2 lakh. The latter amount, by the way, will regularly be donated by the late Abdul Hafeez Kardars family. Kardar was Pakistans first captain. 

From 2006 onwards, awards are going to be presented to the Best Batsman, Best Bowler and the Best Domestic Cricketer as well. This suggestion came from the jury. 

Strangely, Akmal didnt know about his selection till The Telegraph gave the news around 7.30 pm. Yeh to bahut khushi ki baat hai... Nobody told me a thing... That Im getting the maiden award makes it that much more special, he said. 

Now, perhaps, the Board of Control for Cricket in India will follow suit.

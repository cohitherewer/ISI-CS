 NZ snatch 3-wkt win

Queenstown: New Zealand recovered from a top-order batting collapse to beat the West Indies by three wickets in the second one-day International here on Wednesday. 

The Black Caps looked to be heading towards certain defeat when they collapsed to 13 for four chasing 201 for victory after the touring side made 200 for nine from their 50 overs. 

But Peter Fulton (49) and Brendon McCullum (45) steadied the New Zealand innings before Daniel Vettori (53 not out) steered the home team to victory with eight overs to spare and give them a 2-0 lead in the five-game series. 

We should have lost that game, theres no doubt about it, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming said later. 

But some resolve and good batting from the middle and lower order got us home. Thats almost as pleasing as winning a game convincingly. 

Wavell Hinds had earlier scored a defiant half-century to rescue the West Indies from a disastrous start but received little support from his teammates.

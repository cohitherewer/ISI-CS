 Panesar can prove a wizard in Oz

 If I were an England supporter which Im not I would be getting very excited about Monty Panesar. He has a real chance of being successful in international cricket, and by that I mean consistently over a long period, not just in the odd game here and there. To me, he is the new Monty Python: something completely different. 

Three things strike me straight away. Firstly, he has that bit of spunk about him. Secondly, he loves bowling. He will need that when he has to bowl long spells on flat pitches. And thirdly, he is very astute at reading a situation. He has good control and when conditions suit, that allows him to bowl faster and still spin the ball. 

I always love to see a young spinner making an impression. I think of Monty as another member of our union. He bowled really well to get those eight Pakistan wickets at Old Trafford, my happiest hunting ground in four Ashes series in England. But Headingley Carnegie will be a different test for him in more ways than one. 

Over the years, spinners have not done so well at the ground. Conditions tend to favour the seam bowlers. That is why you hear the description of Headingley specialist. Having said that, when Hampshire played there earlier in the season the pitch was drier than usual. We managed to score 404 for five to win on the last day. 

In the longer term, the selectors have a difficult decision when Ashley Giles is fit. I know Ive said before that Ashley is a bit negative for my liking at times. Id love him to go more around the wicket. But he has done well in a different, more defensive role, and you have to look at the whole package he brings to the team. 

So what about the Ashes series this winter? In Adelaide and Sydney I think England will need to go with two spinners. Panesar and Giles could play together because they are not too similar. But the selectors may want somebody who spins it the other way, such as Shaun Udal or Jamie Dalrymple, who made quite a good start in the one-day games against Sri Lanka earlier this summer, or one of the young leg spinners who are starting to come through. 

Australia will be an eye-opener for Monty. Our batsmen are naturally positive and they will try to take him on. As for the crowds, they could go either way. There are always one or two opposition players they take to. On the other hand they always pick out another one or two for mickey-taking, and Montys batting and fielding make him a candidate. 

Phil Tufnell is a classic example of what can happen. He couldnt really field and the cheers would start every time the ball went in his direction. Things got worse and worse because the pressure got to him and he kept on mis-fielding and dropping catches. It affected his bowling, which kept getting smashed around the park. 

I can understand why people want to enjoy Monty for what he is and encourage his spin bowling. Thats fine, but in international cricket these days you have to be at least competent in all areas. Even if you cant take blinding catches in the slips, you must be able to stop the ball, hold the bread and butter chances and throw hard. 

On the batting front, at the very least you have to make the bowler get you out. Nobody will expect Monty to become the next Ricky Ponting, but if he gets a tight defence he can hang around while somebody plays shots at the other end. Im sure that will come as long as he keeps working hard.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Focus shifts to club members 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Five cellphones were confiscated during the Pune inter-venue on Sunday after The Telegraph exposed the RCTC securitymen-mobile user nexus in these columns on Saturday. It was nearly an year ago when the last such seizure was made by the security personnel. However, the fate of the two users, who were handed over to the police for using a unique concealed phone-gadget, is yet to be known.

 Most of the punters and the bookmakers were pleased at the turn of events as the mobile-wielding brigade has been proving detrimental to their interest. Security has been revamped; said an RCTC insider. He however, had no answer when it was pointed out that a score of club members have also been using cellphones in a room reserved for them, for reasons of privacy, in the members stand. Phones and pagers have been banned for the public and all categories of members in all RCTC enclosures.

 Some regular users of the phones in the grand enclosure, however, were of the view that the RCTC is being partial towards the club members. If they and their sycophants enjoy the liberty of using cells, then what is wrong if we do so. RCTC has never confiscated their cells and got them arrested, said Dayanth, a regular punter, who needs to carry his cell because of his ailing parents. When contacted on this issue, Boman Parakh, RCTC secretary, said: We are taking corrective measures.

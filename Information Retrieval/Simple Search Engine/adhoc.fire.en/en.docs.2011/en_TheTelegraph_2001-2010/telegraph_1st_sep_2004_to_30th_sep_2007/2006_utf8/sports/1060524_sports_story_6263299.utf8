 Portuguese duo in trouble 

Lisbon: Officials in Portugal are investigating Benfica duo Armando Petit and Nuno Gomes after they were seen in a TV report taking what appeared to be pirated films to a World Cup camp, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

A senior inspector with the culture ministrys Inspectorate-General for Cultural Activities, which oversees the fight against music and movie piracy, said the body would take action if justified despite the approaching football finals. 

Gomes said in a report broadcast on Friday that he had brought several movies to the training camp held in Evora, some 150kms south-east of Lisbon, including Basic Instinct II and Mission: Impossible III. Both movies have yet to be released on DVD. 

Petit, meanwhile, opened the trunk of his car to show the movies he was taking to the camp and a copy of The Producers, also not released on DVD, could be seen among other films. (AFP)

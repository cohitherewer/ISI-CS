 Malik fit for ODI series, says PCB

Karachi: Pakistan allrounder Shoaib Malik has been declared fit for the five match one-day series against England, chief selector Wasim Bari said on Saturday. 

We have informed the team management that Malik is now fit and has been cleared by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) medical panel. The management has to decide when to call him, Bari said. 

The 24-year old, who has played in 15 Tests and 118 one-day Internationals, had to return home before the first Test of the current tour with an elbow injury. 

He is now okay and keen to start playing again. His inclusion will further increase Pakistans options for the one-day series which is also important for us, Bari said. 

Pakistan lost the second and third matches to concede a Test series in England for the first time since 1982, however, Bari said the team would aim to redress the balance in the one-dayers. 

The former Test wicketkeeper said no final decision had been taken on retaining Mohammed Hafeez for the one-dayers as yet although he was in fine form. 

I think he should stay for the one-dayers as he is a very useful allround player but let us see what the team management wants. 

Hafeez was sent to England to shore up the batting and scored 95 on Friday in the final Test at the Oval on Friday after a three-year absence from the side. 

Both Malik and Hafeez are opening batsmen, off-break bowlers and sharp fielders and have had their bowling actions reported in recent times. 

Pakistan sent back openers Taufiq Umar, Salman Butt and left-arm pacer Samiullah Niazi before The Oval Test and Bari said a decision on the final one-day squad would be made next week. (REUTERS)

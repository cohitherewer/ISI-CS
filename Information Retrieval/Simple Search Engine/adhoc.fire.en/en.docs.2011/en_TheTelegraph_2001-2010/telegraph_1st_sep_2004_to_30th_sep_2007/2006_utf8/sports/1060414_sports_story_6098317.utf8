The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Problems galore for both teams

 - National League

 - Bagan face Air India today

Calcutta: The 1-3 loss against East Bengal has forced Mohun Bagan to revise their goals. The green-and-maroons are now hoping for a respectable finish rather than dreaming of occupying the top slot in the 10th National Football League for the ONGC Cup. 

A win is high on Mohun Bagans priorities as they go out on home turf (Salt Lake Stadium) against Air India on Friday. 

We have to win this match at any cost so that we can finish at a respectable position, said Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya after Thursday mornings practice session at the Bidhannagar Municipal Sports Complex ground. 

This is an important game for Air India in their struggle for survival. With just 13 points in their kitty from 12 matches, Air India are in eighth spot in the now nine-team league. 

Coach Bimal Ghosh realises the importance of maximum points. His task, though, will be cut out as regular defenders Benoy Kuruvilla and Suley Musah will have to sit out with injuries. 

Even Bhattacharyas team is plagued by multiple problems. Sushil Singh, Sanjeev Maria, Tomba Singh and Noel Wilson are not fit to start Fridays game, while key medio Dharamjit Singh will have to sit out following the red card in the East Bengal match. No wonder, Bhattacharya is still undecided on his starting XI. 

The absence of genuine strikers is worrying Bhattacharya. In the match against East Bengal, we missed a few chances which could have been converted if we had genuine strikers in our ranks , Bhattacharya pointed out. 

With Sushil out, the coach will have to decide who will partner Awudu Ibrahim up front. Mehtab Hussain and Dipendu Biswas are the two available options, but a question mark looms over the latter who hasnt played 90 minutes in an NFL game yet. 

Mehtab will be the key man, whatever his role. The attacking midfielder scored Mohun Bagans lone goal against East Bengal, and Bhattacharya will hope the captain will reproduce his scoring form on Friday.

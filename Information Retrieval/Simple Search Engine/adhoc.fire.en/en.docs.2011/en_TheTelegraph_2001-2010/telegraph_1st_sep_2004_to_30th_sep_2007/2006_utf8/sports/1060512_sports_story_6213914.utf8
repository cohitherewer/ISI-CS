 Malakhov holds Sasi

Sarajevo: Despite his best efforts, Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran had to settle for a draw with Russian GM Vladimir Malakhov in the fourth round of Bosna International Grandmasters Chess tournament here. 

In other games, top seeded GM Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu of Romania signed a quick peace with Borki Predojevic of Bosnia and Herzegovina while Norwegian wonder boy Magnus Carlsen failed to break the solid defence of Dortmund champion Arkadij Naiditsch of Germany and had to settle for a draw. 

Malakhov, Predojevic and Nisipeanu continue to lead the points table with 2.5 out of a possible 4. Carlsen remained fourth with 2 while Naiditsch is next in line on 1.5 points. 

With his second draw after two initial losses, Sasikiran is at the bottom with 1 point with six rounds to go. 

Sasikiran, with his white pieces, faced the Slav Defense by Malakhov and the players reached a position akin to the queens gambit declined. 

Fortunes fluctuated in this keenly contested game as early in the middle game Sasikiran could boast of a slight advantage and launched a king side attack after which Malakhov had to go on the defence. 

Under pressure, the Russian came up with a queen sacrifice for a rook and bishop to ease the tension a bit and thereafter, Sasikiran was seen pressing for a victory. 

However, Malakhov always had a defensive resource up his sleeve and when Sasikiran tried too hard, Malakhov struck back and got three pawns, a rook and bishop against Sasikirans lone queen. 

Since then, Malakhov was on top and Sasikiran was pushed to the wall but he managed to split the point. The longest game of the event thus far lasted 118 moves. (PTI)

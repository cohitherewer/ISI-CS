 Motivated Bengal up against determined UP

 - Deep expects a high-scoring game; Kaif pins hopes on Chawla 

A CORRESPONDENT

 Deep Dasgupta 

Lucknow: An intense tussle for supremacy is expected to unfold at the K.D. Singh Babu Stadium, where two spirited sides lock horns in the five-day Ranji Trophy final from Sunday. 

For the Deep Dasgupta-led Bengal side, it will be a wonderful opportunity to earn a third crown for the state ? their first in over a decade and a half. 

As far as Mohammed Kaifs men are concerned, history beckons them as Uttar Pradesh have never laid their hands on the coveted trophy. 

It was way back in 1939-40 that Uttar Pradesh played their first final, and came out second-best to Maharashtra. They have featured in two title-round clashes (1977-78 and 1997-98) since then, losing both to Karnataka. 

Back to the present. UP made a nightmarish start to the season, losing their first two games (to Haryana and Baroda) before turning things around and finishing the league stage with back-to-back wins (over Hyderabad and Andhra Pradesh). 

Bengal, on the other hand, suffered a major hiccup in their penultimate match (getting drubbed by Tamil Nadu at home) but recovered in the nick of time to outwit Railways and earn a last-four berth. 

Deep, a former India wicketkeeper-batsman, preferred to talk of his teams strength rather than analyse the opposition. Its our teamwork which has helped us through to the final and we are hopeful of continuing the good show here, Deep said on Saturday. 

The pitch seemed to have pleased the Bengal camp. It looks like the wicket we have at Eden Gardens and thats a good sign for our batsmen, said Deep. 

A big total will give some advantage to the team batting first. But chasing a big target also wont be a difficult task, the Bengal captain observed. 

The good news for Deep is that Rohan Gavaskar, who missed the semi-final versus Baroda, will be back in the XI to strengthen the batting department (at the expense of Kamal Hasan Mondal). 

Bengal will also rely a lot on new ball operators Shib Shankar Paul, whose big haul floored Baroda in the semis, and the tall and pacy Ranadeb Bose. 

Kaif, a member of the losing team eight seasons ago, will be determined to write a different script this time around. In the thick of domestic action after missing out on a Test berth to Pakistan, he has been a major inspiration for his teammates as the semi-final win over Mumbai showed. 

Refusing to pay much attention to the nature of the wicket, Kaif said the presence of young leggie Piyush Chawla has given his team an extra edge. 

The home team will also look to a big score from young left-hander Suresh Raina, a member of the ODI squad earlier this season. The other pillars of the side are veteran medium-pacer Ashish Winston Zaidi and experienced duo Gyanendra Pandey and Rizwan Shamshad. 

UP, a combination of youth and experience, look the fitter side. Bengal, on the other hand, look a motivated lot. In the final analysis, though, it may turn out to be a battle between the batters.

Bengal: Deep Dasgupta (captain), Arindam Das, Subhamoy Das, Avishek Jhunjhunwala, Rohan Gavaskar, Manoj Tewari, Laxmi Ratan Shukla, Sourashish Lahiri, Shiv Sagar Singh, Ranadeb Bose, Shib Sankar Paul.

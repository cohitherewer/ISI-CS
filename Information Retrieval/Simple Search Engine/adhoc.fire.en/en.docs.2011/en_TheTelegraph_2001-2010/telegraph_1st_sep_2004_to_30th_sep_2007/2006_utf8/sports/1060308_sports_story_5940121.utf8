 Powell keen to prove hes still fastest

Melbourne: Asafa Powell wants to prove he is still the fastest man on earth after being given a clear run as the headline act of the Commonwealth Games athletics programme. 

The March 15-26 event will be Jamaican Powells first major competition since his stunning performance last June, when he set a world mark of 9.77 seconds over the 100 metres to break Tim Montgomerys three-year-old record by 0.01. 

I am still the fastest man on earth, Powell declared when he arrived in Melbourne last week after a low-key preparation since a groin injury forced him to miss the world championships in Finland last year. The burly 23-year-old said he had been running well in Jamaica and was keen to complete his comeback and get back to serious running.To win the Commonwealth Games is a really big thing, Powell added. It is really a stepping stone for me and I would love to win my first race here and then go on to bigger and better things. 

However, Powell will not have it all his way. 

Marc Burns and Darrell Brown of Trinidad and Tobago both ran under 10 seconds in 2005 and Ghanas Aziz Zakari is above him in the IAAF world rankings. 

Powells bid to win his first major title has assumed even greater significance in Melbourne after the withdrawal of some of the Commonwealths best known atheletes, including English distance runner Paula Radcliffe, who injured her foot in training. 

Kenyans are expected to dominate the mens distance events, not least of them world champion Benjamin Limo and cross country specialist Augustine Choge in a 5,000m boasting one of the strongest fields at the Games. 

Silver-medallist in Manchester four years ago, Limo had planned to skip Melbourne to concentrate on the world cross country championships in Fukuoka but was among a number of Kenyans selected without running in his national trials. 

I am happy to represent my country in the Commonwealth Games because as well as helping me build speed for the cross country, I want to go a step further and win the title, Limo said in Nairobi last month. 

Kenyans Reuben Kosgei and Ezekiel Kemboi, who won gold at the 2000 and 2004 Olympics, respectively, will line up in what also promises to be an enthralling mens 3,000m steeplechase. 

One Kenyan not lacking in confidence is Athens Olympics 5,000m silver-medallist Isabella Ochichi. 

I have got the endurance that I wanted and I can assure you of medals in Melbourne and Fukuoka, the policewoman said.

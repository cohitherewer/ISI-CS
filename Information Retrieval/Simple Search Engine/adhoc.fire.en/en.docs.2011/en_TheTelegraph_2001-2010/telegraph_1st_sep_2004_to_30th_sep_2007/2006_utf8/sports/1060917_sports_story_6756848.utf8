 Never saw it coming It was a total shock

 - Becks reveals how he felt at being axed by McClaren 

 Beckham 

London: Former England captain David Beckham has revealed the full extent of his shock at being axed by new coach Steve McClaren following the World Cup flop show. 

The Real Madrid midfielder paid the price for Englands lacklustre performance in Germany where they went out in the quarter finals on penalties to Portugal. 

Beckham told a daily here that once McClaren had replaced Sven-Goran Eriksson, the former Middlesbrough coach told him bluntly you are one of the casualties. 

But the 31-year-old Beckham says he is determined to force his way back into the squad, even if he doubts McClarens public declaration that the door is still open. 

I know people said I should have seen it coming, said Beckham. But I never saw it coming. It was a total shock. I would be lying if I said I wasnt disappointed. 

Its a terrible feeling not playing for England after 10 years of being involved. He has made a decision. But its not bitterness that I feel. Its more disappointment and hurt. 

Its hard to take when the reasoning behind it was to move on but I still believe I have got two or three more good years left in me. 

I thought I could move on with the team and not get left behind but now I have got a burning desire to prove him wrong.

 CAB explores legal option

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) may form a legal committee to deal with the crisis regarding Jagmohan Dalmiyas continuation as CAB president. 

The move comes following BCCIs expulsion of Dalmiya at its special general meeting in Jaipur. 

After a suggestion from (former BCCI and CAB president) Biswanath Dutt, forming a legal committee is on the agenda, a CAB source said on Monday. 

According to another source, the legal panel may comprise personalities such as former West Bengal chief minister and lawyer Siddhartha Sankar Ray, Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee, and legal eagle Ushanath Banerjee. 

These names are doing the rounds at the moment, but nothing has been finalised, the source added. 

Meanwhile, the CAB working committee, which meets on Wednesday to decide on the future course of action, is likely to be chaired by one of the vice-presidents as Dalmiya may not attend.

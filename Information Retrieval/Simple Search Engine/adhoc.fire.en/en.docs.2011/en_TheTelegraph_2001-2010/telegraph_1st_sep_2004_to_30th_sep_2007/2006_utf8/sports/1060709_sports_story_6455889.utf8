 FIA proposals

London: Formula Ones governing body has paved the way for a major revamp of Grand Prix weekends with proposals to abolish the use of third cars next season. 

The International Automobile Federation (FIA) said in a statement on Friday that changes to the 2006 and 2007 sporting regulations had been proposed by its Formula One commission at a meeting in Paris. 

The changes also included lopping five minutes off qualifying with immediate effect. 

The proposals will be put to a fax vote of the FIAs World Motor Sport Council. 

If agreed, changes which affect the 2006 regulations will come into force at the French GP (next week), the governing body said.

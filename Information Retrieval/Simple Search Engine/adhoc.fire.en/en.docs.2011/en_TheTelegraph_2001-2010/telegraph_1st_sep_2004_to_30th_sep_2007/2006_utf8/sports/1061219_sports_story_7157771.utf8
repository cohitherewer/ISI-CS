 Jacques Kallis explanation satisfies CSA

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Cricket South Africa (CSA) CEO Gerald Majola and Jacques Kallis have met to discuss the controversy regarding the singing of the national anthem. 

In a statement issued on Monday, Majola said, Jacques has explained why he remains silent during the singing of the anthem before international matches and his explanation is completely acceptable to CSA. 

Jacques recently lost his parents, and he was particularly close to his father who was his cricket mentor. They would often sing the anthem together, and his father was very proud of him playing for South Africa, Majola said, according to information received here. 

Jacques told me that he sings the anthem in his heart in a quiet moment in remembrance of his parents and in gratitude for what they did to allow him to be good enough to represent his country. 

He has great respect for the anthem and cherishes every moment he has represented South Africa around the world.

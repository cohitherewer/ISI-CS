 Matthaeus, timeless class 

 - An all-action, goal-scoring midfielder without equal 

 Lothar Matthaeus 

Berlin: Lothar Matthaeus became one of Germanys most inspirational footballers in a world-record breaking international career that spanned 20 years and 150 caps. When Matthaeus finally decided to call time on his international playing days in 2000, he had completed tours of duty at five World Cups, and holds the record for appearances at the tournament, with 25. 

Born in Erlangen in 1961, he first came to prominence after moving to Borussia Moenchengladbach aged 18 in 1979. 

Quickly becoming an established star in what was then one of the Bundesligas strongest sides, the teenage Matthaeus was propelled into West Germanys victorious squad for the 1980 European Championship. 

Though unable to command a regular place in the Mannschaft, the youngsters talent was clear. In friendlies against Brazil and Argentina in the build-up to the 1982 World Cup finals, he had man-marked both Zico and Diego Maradona superbly in two masterful performances. 

Yet his contribution to West Germanys campaign at the World Cup was limited to just two appearances as a substitute. However, by the time of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, Matthaeus was part of the furniture. Though Germany were less than dazzling en route to their second final in a row, where they met Argentina, Matthaeus had been outstanding. 

In the final he was given the awesome job of man-marking Maradona once more. Matthaeus proved equal to the task, though could do nothing about the Argentines wonderful first-time pass which set up the winning goal. 

Two years later, Matthaeus was transferred from Bayern to Inter Milan, where he was the key figure in a German spine to the Serie A side that also featured Jurgen Klinsmann and Andreas Brehme. It was under Matthaeus that Inter last lifted the Italian title, their victory coming in the 1989 season. 

The following year was to bring greater glory for Matthaeus, however, when he captained Germany to their 1990 World Cup win. The tournament marked Matthaeus highpoint as a player. As an all-action, goal-scoring midfielder he was without equal. Not surprisingly he was European Player of the Year in 1990, and Fifa World Player of the Year in 1991. 

He helped Inter to victory in the Uefa Cup, before returning to Bayern in 1992 after four successful seasons in Italy. 

In 1994, he was back at the World Cup as Germany sought to defend their title. With his ageing legs no longer allowing him to perform the role of midfield dynamo, he had now been converted into a libero. 

His presence could not stop Germany from making a quarter final exit against Bulgaria, however, a game which saw him pull level with Uwe Seeler, Wladislav Zmuda and Maradona as most-capped World Cup player with 21. 

Matthaeus made an improbable return to international colours at the 1998 World Cup. He was still around at Euro 2000, but his presence was a source of discontent in the German squad. In the event, Matthaeus played as Germany tumbled out in the first round, an unhappy end to a glittering career. After a short stint in the US, he retired in 2000. (AFP)

London: Argentina joined fierce rivals Australia in the Davis Cup semi-finals on Sunday when Juan Ignacio Chela held his nerve to seal a 3-2 quarter-final victory over injury-hit holders Croatia. 

Russia also advanced to the last four thanks to Dmitry Tursunovs tense five-set win over teenager Richard Gasquet of France. 

In Septembers semi-finals, Argentina host Australia, who completed a 5-0 whitewash of Belarus earlier on Sunday. Argentina hammered the Australians 4-1 in an ill-tempered quarter final last year in Sydney. 

Russia will play the United States, who won 3-2 in California. 

Chela beat Croatian Sasa Tuksar, standing in for the injured Mario Ancic, 3-6, 6-4, 7-6, 7-6 to put the Argentines through to their fourth semi-final in five years. 

Croatias Ivan Ljubicic hauled the holders level at 2-2 with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over David Nalbandian in Sundays first singles rubber. 

France suffered their first defeat in five ties staged in Pau when Tursunov replaced injured compatriot Nikolay Davydenko to expose Gasquets inexperience. 

Tursunov won 6-1, 3-6, 6-7, 6-3, 7-5 against the 19-year-old to give Russia a decisive 3-1 lead. Mikhail Youzhny then beat Michael Llodra 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 to wrap up a 4-1 quarter final win for Russia. 

Australia had already clinched their semi-final spot by winning the first three rubbers against Belarus. 

On Sunday they completed a rout when Wayne Arthurs defeated Sergui Tarasevitch 7-6, 6-2 and Chris Guccione earned a crushing 6-1, 6-3 win over Belarussian rookie Alexandr Zotov. 

Andy Roddick defeated Chiles Fernando Gonzalez 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 in Rancho Mirage to guide the United States into the semis. James Blake lost the second reverse singles 3-6, 4-6 to Paul Capdeville.

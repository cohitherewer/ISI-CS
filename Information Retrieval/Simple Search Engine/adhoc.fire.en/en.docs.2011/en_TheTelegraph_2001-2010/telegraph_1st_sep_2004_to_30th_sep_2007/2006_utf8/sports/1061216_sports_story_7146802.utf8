The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ardelis may just do it 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singhs five-year-old champion galloper, Aperitivo, faces a big threat from Generations Next in Saturdays star-event, the 1,600m Calcutta Gold Cup. 

 Last winters St Leger winner Rasalas, who is a year younger to Aperitivo, is out to settle a score against the year 2005 Derby winner. In their recent clash, Aperitivo had humbled the Daniel David-trainee, albeit over 1,400 metres. The extended trip may see changed strategies and a different result. 

 However, Vijays other ward, the three-year-old Ardelis, may surprise both. He is out to prove a point. The Gold Cup would have been his for the asking had he not suffered a training setback nearly 10 months ago. He was impressive upon his return, last Saturday, when he troubled the 2000 Guineas winner, Moon Forest. He is going to be the sentimental favourite for most concerned, and he may just do it.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

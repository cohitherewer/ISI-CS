 Taufel defends Rauf

St Johns: Simon Taufel has defended the procedure taken by himself and fellow umpire Asad Rauf during the controversial Dhoni dismissal while also sympathising with the TV umpire, who he said was battling with moral and technical problems. 

The Aussie said they were right under the rules to refer Dhonis catch to TV umpire Billy Doctrove. 

Under the playing conditions, we are able to refer a boundary decision to the third umpire and have TV provide him with pictures to get him to make that decision as to whether or not the fielder did or did not touch the boundary rope before completing the catch, Taufel said. (PTI)

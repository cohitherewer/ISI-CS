The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Deep (78) stands among ruins

 - Ranji Tie vs Punjab 

 - Sourav manages 6, Bengal 156 

 Deep Dasgupta 

Mohali: Sourav Ganguly failed with the bat as Bengal were dismissed cheaply for 156 against Punjab on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group B match at the PCA Stadium here on Thursday. 

Sourav, seeking to make a comeback into the national side via the domestic cricket route, could make only 6 as the Bengal batsmen floundered on the sporting track after being put in to bat. 

It was Deep Dasguptas heroic knock of 78, which earned them some respectability after they had lost five wickets with just 18 on board. 

However, Punjab themselves were placed at a shaky 75 for three when stumps were drawn for the day. Ravneet Ricky (33) and Reetinder Singh Sodhi (5) were at the crease. 

While opener Karan Goel was run out, Sourav accounted for the wickets of Manish Sharma and skipper Pankaj Dharmani for a duck, making some amends for his failure with the bat. 

The trouble for Bengal began early with both the openers falling cheaply and they could never really recover from the twin setback. 

Laxmi Ratan Shukla played a useful knock of 30 down the order in the circumstances. 

For Punjab, Gagandeep Singh inflicted the maximum damage claiming four for 36.

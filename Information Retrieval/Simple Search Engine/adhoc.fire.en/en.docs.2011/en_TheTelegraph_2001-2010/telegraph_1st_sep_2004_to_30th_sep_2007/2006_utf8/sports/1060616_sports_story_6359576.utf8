The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Germans showed marked improvement in 

 Game II 

 - Sobolewskis red card cost Poland dear

 Talking Tactics 

 PK Banerjee

 I was expecting Germany and Poland, 

 traditional rivals and neighbours, to serve up something 

 special. Well, I wasnt disappointed with the midnight 

 show.

 The Germans ? keen to cash in 

 on their winning start ? played direct, pressing football. 

 The Poles fought tooth and nail to frustrate their celebrated 

 opponents. The big push came in the final 10 

 minutes and the Polish citadel finally fell in stoppage 

 time.

 It made for a riveting contest 

 and, as far as Im concerned, was one of the most entertaining 

 matches of the first round thus far.

 Klinsmanns team, despite 

 having pumped in four goals against Costa Rica, had shown 

 chinks in their armour ? especially in the defence. I must 

 say they showed marked improvement on Wednesday. The backline 

 concentrated hard and kept whatever Poland threw at them 

 by way of counter-attacks. Philipp Lahm was outstanding, 

 not only with his defensive work, but as an attacker as 

 well.

 Michael Ballack was a trifle rusty, 

 but still looked a leader of men. There is an authoritative 

 streak in him which was reflected best in the pinpoint 40-50 

 metre passes he essayed to spread the game long and wide. 

 Poland played to their limitations, 

 stressing on an organised defence and raiding the German 

 citadel on pacy counters. What really let them down was 

 a careless foul by midfielder Radoslaw Sobolewski, who was 

 booked a second time and thrown out after 75 minutes.

 Klinsmann had introduced David 

 Odonkor and Oliver Neuville just before the Poles were reduced 

 to 10 men. Both those fresh pairs of legs helped Germany 

 take advantage of the numerical superiority and push Poland 

 to a corner. A series of openings were created of which 

 only Neuville converted one.

 Neither Klose nor Podolski was 

 in the best of form on Wednesday night. Both have Polish 

 roots and Im sure there was extra pressure on the 

 duo to perform. They missed some absolute sitters, while 

 Polish custodian Boruc denied the Germans at least thrice.

 There had been a lot of hype over 

 Podolski. He would have realised after two games that the 

 World Cup is not an easy stage to meet expectations. Klinsmann 

 cant afford to see his strikers missing too many gilt-edged 

 chances once the knockout stage arrives.

 There was never any doubt about 

 Germanys superiority. They had more shots at goal, 

 better ball possession and several corners. Had the strikers 

 been on target, they should have won by a bigger margin. 

 And despite the bottomline reading far less convincing than 

 the one in their opener (4-2), the Germans put up a much 

 more solid performance in Game II.

 Thats a good sign for Klinsmanns 

 team. He couldnt have hoped for better results in 

 the first two league games. I think Germany will get sharper 

 with every match and keeping the home advantage in mind, 

 they look to be on track for a dream tournament.

 A closing thought on Poland. After 

 watching them put up such a gutsy fight against one of the 

 Cup contenders, I couldnt help wonder how they lost 

 to Ecuador. That one bad game has all but ended Polands 

 German odyssey.

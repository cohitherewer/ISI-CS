 Imran raps Pak management

Karachi: The Pakistan cricket team management has drawn flak from Imran Khan for experimenting with opening slots. 

The former World Cup-winning captain said frequent changes had an adverse impact on the teams performance in the ongoing Test series in England. 

All we have is makeshift openers and the result is for everyone to see, the Pakistan legend said. 

When the opening pair fails, the middle-order comes under a lot of pressure, which eventually leads to a collapse as was witnessed at Old Trafford, Imran was quoted as saying by a local daily on Saturday. 

He said that trying different openers in different matches was a wrong strategy. 

Its a strategic failure that we keep changing the opening pair every now and then, and it affects the overall stability of the side, he said. 

The former fast bowler was also worried about Pakistans bowling resources and said in Shoaib Akhtars absence, it was crucial that Mohammed Asif returned to the team as soon as possible to add some bite to the attack.

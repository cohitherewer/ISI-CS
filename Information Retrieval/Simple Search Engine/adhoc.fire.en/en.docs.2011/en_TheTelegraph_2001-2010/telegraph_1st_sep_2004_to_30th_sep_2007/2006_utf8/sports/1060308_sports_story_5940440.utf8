 Warne makes another debut

Sydney: Australian spin wizard Shane Warne has made his debut on a different field altogether. 

This time the 36-year-old leg-spin legend put on make-up instead of pad and gloves to appear in a television soap called Neighbours. 

Warne appeared as himself in the soap with the storyline revolving around his charity organisation ? The Shane Warne Foundation, according to a report in an Australian daily. 

Warne shot for three scenes for more than two hours as his kids Brooke and Jackson watched their father performing a new role. 

In the scenes shot for the serial, the highest Test wicket-taker is seen visiting Ramsay Street to collect donation for his foundation, which works for seriously ill and underprivileged children. 

The star tweaker also delivered several dialogues and bowled during his acting debut. 

The soap turned out to be a family affair as the producer of the show got to know that Warnes eight-year-old daughter Brooke was a big fan of Neighbours and also offered her a small role.

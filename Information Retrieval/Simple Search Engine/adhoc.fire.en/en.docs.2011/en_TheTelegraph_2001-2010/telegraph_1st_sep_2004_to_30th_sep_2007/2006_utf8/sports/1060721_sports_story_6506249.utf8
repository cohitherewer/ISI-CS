 Central Calcutta, South 24 Pgs in final

 - DISTRICT BADMINTON 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Central Calcutta and South 24 Parganas men made short work of their respective opponents to set up a Friday showdown in the Inter-District Badminton Championships. There was no action in the womens event as Darjeeling and Chandannagore failed to field teams. East Calcutta and South 24 Parganas benefited, and will contest in Fridays final. 

According to the organisers, the WBBA, there was none to accompany the two Darjeeling girls to Calcutta. Chandannagores problem was different. One of their players, Soumi Datta, became ineligible as she was selected in the Railways team recently. 

The mens clashes saw Sanjay Das putting up a good show for Central Calcutta. The former state champion dropped the second game only to come through 21-19, 12-21, 21-12 against Arijit Chowdhury. Sanjay also teamed up with Mrinmoy Pal to win the doubles rubber. 

In the second semi-final, it was Sudip Bhattacharjee who did the star turn for South 24 Parganas.

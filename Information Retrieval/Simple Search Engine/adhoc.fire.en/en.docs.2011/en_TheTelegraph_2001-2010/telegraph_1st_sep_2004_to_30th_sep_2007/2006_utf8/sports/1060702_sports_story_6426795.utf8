The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Negative play cost us dear

 - The way to beat Germany is to produce pure football

 Guest Column - Osvaldo 

 Ardiles

 So 

 close, this game. Any game decided by penalties is always 

 very painful for the losing side, contrasting with the high 

 of the winning team. Germany march on, and have made themselves 

 favourites to win the World Cup. They are a very difficult 

 side to beat.

 Argentina held the key in the 

 first half, controlling the game by moving the ball around. 

 They played the way I think we should always play ? with 

 only one or two long balls. It looked very positive for 

 Argentina. But in this very close game, the turning point 

 was the substitution of Juan Roman Riquelme. The changes 

 put all Argentinas eggs in one basket.

 Coach Jose Pekerman was looking 

 to win the game 1-0 from that point. Cruz replacing Crespo 

 was another indication of that, as Cruz is very similar 

 and the coach believed he needed height up front. But we 

 are all very clever after a game, when we know the result 

 and when we are not under the pressure ourselves. 

 I dont want to be too critical 

 of Pekerman ? he went with what he believed in. But my view 

 is that Argentina decided to defend too early in the game. 

 Those negative tactics, to which I have never subscribed, 

 probably cost us. Everyone will ask: Where was Lionel Messi? 

 I am asking the same thing myself. I wanted Messi to start. 

 There was a time in the game when I know everyone in Argentina 

 would have been praying for Messi to come on as the Germans 

 were looking for the equaliser, but it was not to be.

 Messi could have been the key. 

 Unfortunately, we will never know. The way to beat Germany 

 is to produce pure football. I think Brazil can beat them. 

 The other teams left in, I am not so sure. 

 Overall, Argentina have had a 

 very good World Cup and I am very proud of them. Perhaps 

 they were unlucky to meet Germany in the quarter finals. 

 Argentina brought a lot of colour to the tournament, and 

 leave as one of the best teams. 

 It brought back memories of just 

 how hard it is to win a World Cup. Match by match overcoming 

 your internal doubts, pressure from all quarters. Friday 

 was always going to be a close game. 

 I said 51-49 in favour of Germany 

 beforehand, and I think that was how it was. It turned out 

 that it is Germanys destiny to go on, and good luck 

 to them. I wish it could have been different.

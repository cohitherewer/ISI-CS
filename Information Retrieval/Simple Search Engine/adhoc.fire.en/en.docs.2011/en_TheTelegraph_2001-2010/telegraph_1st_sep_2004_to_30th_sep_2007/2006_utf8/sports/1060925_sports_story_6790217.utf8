The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I dont count minutes when I play: Hingis 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Martina Hingis took just 58 minutes to brush aside Sania Mirza in the semi-final and a minute less to dispose off Olga Poutchkova in the final to clinch the WTA Sunfeast Open on Sunday. 

The world No. 9, however, played down the easy passage to her victory. I dont count minutes when I play. Tennis is played according to the scores. But I definitely played very well today. The first set took only 18 minutes, which was almost scary, laughed Hingis. 

Which moment in the tournament does will she cherish the most? Playing Sania, of course. The fans were waiting for the match. You could feel the energy in the atmosphere. These are the moments for which you play and compete. 

It feels good to have got my second title. To be honest, the first six months of the year exceeded expectations. I had set a goal to be back in the top 10 and it was a dream come true when I did. My next target is to qualify for the Championships. 

And what memories is she taking away? Lots, my second title this year, an opportunity to visit India. And of course, the Missionaries of Charity. 

Meanwhile, Sania Mirza and Leizel Huber clinched the doubles title and the Indian felt: Any title is special. This is my first title in Calcutta and hopefully Ill be back to take the singles next year. 

Leizel also heaped rich encomium on her partner: Its hard to believe that Sania is only 19, considering that she already has three doubles titles under her belt. Its an honour to play with her. 

Former Davis Cup captain Jaidip Mukerjea is of the opinion that to beat Hingis, one either has to out-hit her a la Williams sisters, or outwit her by playing a tactical game. 

Former Davis Cup Akhtar Ali, however, doesnt feel she has it in her to regain the No.1 spot. The top 3-4 players hit the ball too hard for Hingis to cope with.

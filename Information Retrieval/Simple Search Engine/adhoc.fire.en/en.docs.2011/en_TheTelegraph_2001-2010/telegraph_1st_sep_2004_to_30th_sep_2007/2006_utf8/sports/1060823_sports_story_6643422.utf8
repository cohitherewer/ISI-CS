 Sania clings on to 44th place

 New Delhi: Despite a first 

 round elimination at the Montreal Masters last week, Sania 

 Mirza managed to hold on to 44th place in the latest WTA 

 rankings.

 The Hyderabadi teenager, who has 

 been in action in singles and doubles for several weeks 

 on the trot, went down in three sets to Italian qualifier 

 Alberta Brianti.

 Though Sania and her polish partner 

 Marta Domachowska lost in the first round as well, the Indian 

 saw her doubles ranking climb a notch to No. 28.

 Sania will tune up for the US 

 Open starting August 28 by playing the Forest Hills womens 

 tennis classic in New York, where she faces American wild 

 card Alexa Glatch in the first round.

 Shikha Uberoi is the next highest 

 ranked Indian in singles at 193, a fall of five places, 

 while her sister Neha, who plays for the US, jumped 18 spots 

 to 234th.

 In the doubles charts, Shikha 

 fell one place to No. 127. Frances Amelie Mauresmo 

 continues to lead the singles rankings ahead of Belgian 

 Kim Clijsters, who would not be able to defend her US Open 

 crown due to a wrist injury.

 The big mover was Swiss miss Martina 

 Hingis, who moved three places to break into the top ten 

 after reaching the final in Montreal. She is now at No. 

 9.

 On the mens side, American 

 Andy Roddick moved two places to No. 10 after his triumph 

 at the Cincinnati Masters, while Swiss Roger Federer continues 

 to rule the roost, followed by Spaniard Rafael Nadal. (Agencies)

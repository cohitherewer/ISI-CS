The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England paid the price for mental laziness

 - Flintoff's moves portrayed a lack of imagination... More 

 inventiveness was needed

 Guest Column

When we look for reasons behind Englands extraordinary inability to win this match, we shouldnt just blame the catchers who put down chances, important though they were. We should blame the whole teams attitude. They were lazy in the mind. 

England dominated the first two days, up until the end of Sri Lankas first innings. After that, all they thought they had to do was turn up. They expected the opposition to bat just as badly again and get themselves out. Players were laughing and joking, but they never got switched on. And they paid the price for it in the end. 

Its obvious that England are a much better team in terms of talent than Sri Lanka. The visiting seamers were poor, and their first-innings batting was worse. But England were lulled by their very dominance ? they thought victory was a formality. 

There is no point trying to find fault with people who dropped catches. Im not saying they werent expensive, because they were. There were nine misses, adding up to 231 runs and lots and lots of time. But the fielders just have to put their hands up and say they had a bad day. 

All the culprits can usually be relied upon: They are people such as Andrew Flintoff, Alastair Cook, Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood. In ordinary circumstances, these guys have hands like flypaper. 

I am a great admirer of Flintoff, but I thought he showed no imagination in this match. When the pitch is slow and flat, that is when a captain is tested. You have to show some inventiveness ? change the bowling around and alter the field placings. 

There was a sameness about England for far too long. They sat back and waited for something to happen instead of trying to create something. Monty Panesar didnt bowl until late on, and even then I thought he was under used. Flintoff seemed to get sucked into the idea that overcast conditions would equal wickets for seamers, but it didnt work like that. 

England only seemed to bubble after tea, when they realised that the game was getting away from them. Suddenly we saw fielders clapping each other. Even the crowd started trying to lift the team. But I never once saw Flintoff having a chinwag with his senior players, trying to come up with a different idea. I didnt see anyone bringing a drink and a message from the coach in the dressing room. 

Credit to Sri Lanka for the way they fought. They showed character, spirit, talent ? the lot. But they couldnt have done it without Englands soporific attitude. Flintoff and his team need to rediscover the killer instinct of last summer. They have only got themselves to blame. 

I know from experience that cancer comes as a shock. So I have great sympathy for my friend Fred Trueman, who has been diagnosed with the disease. I have spoken to Fred a couple of times in the last few days, and it is good to hear him in an optimistic frame of mind. He is very positive about his chemotherapy, which he starts this week.

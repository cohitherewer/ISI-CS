 Klose desperate for Golden Boot

Berlin: Germany striker Miroslav Klose said he is desperate to win the Golden Boot title after missing out on Sundays final in Berlin. 

Klose leads the scoring charts with five goals and has the chance to put more distance between him and his rivals when hosts Germany take on Portugal in Saturdays third-place play-off in Stuttgart. 

Finishing top-scorer at the World Cup is a great honour and it would be fantastic if one title stayed in Germany after these finals, Klose said during Thursdays press conference. 

The Werder Bremen striker is two goals ahead of his main rival French striker Thierry Henry, who will face Italy in Sundays showdown. 

German Player of the Year Klose admitted that he is still struggling with a calf injury picked up in the 0-2 semi-final defeat to Italy on Tuesday. 

We want to beat Portugal as third is better than fourth. We wanted to be in the final but unfortunately it did not work out that way. 

The 28-year-old, top-scorer in the German league last season, has put himself in the shop window with his performances at the finals but refused to discuss speculation he could be set for a big money summer move. 

I am glad to have a few weeks off on holiday before the season restarts. I will see how it goes with Werder Bremen, Klose said. 

I have a contract at Bremen until 2008. I want to go abroad at some stage but I do not want to talk about it now. 

If Klose, born in the polish city of Opole, can score against Portugal on Saturday, it will take his World Cup goals tally to 11 ? level with Germany manager Jurgen Klinsmann. (AFP)

Fatullah: Skipper Ricky Ponting and opener Matthew Hayden took champions Australia closer to victory on Wednesday after suffering early scare against bottom-ranked Bangladesh in the first Test. 

Ponting was unbeaten on 72 when stumps were drawn on the fourth day with first-innings centurion Adam Gilchrist on six as Australia reached 212 for four, 95 short of a win. 

The tourists lost three wickets towards the end of the days play after Hayden (72) had ensured a steady start and later Ponting capitalised on it. 

Despite conceding a shocking 158-run first innings lead, the Aussies showed their mettle and struck back hard by dismissing the home side for a meagre 148 runs in the second innings and then batted sensibly in their final innings. 

With a target of 307 to chase in the final innings, Hayden played a vital role, adding 64 with the other left-hander Michael Hussey (37) and then partnering in a crucial 109-run stand with Ponting. 

He struck eight fours and a straight six off left-arm spinner Mohammed Rafique during his 152-ball knock and also went for some quick singles in a bid to keep the pressure on the fielders. 

In the end, it was one such single to mid-on that ended Haydens innings as Enamul Haque made a direct throw to the bowlers end. 

Ponting continued to graft for his runs even as Damien Martyn (7) and Michael Clarke (9) were out cheaply against a probing bowling attack led by Rafique, who scalped both the wickets. 

Australia, who have won both their previous Tests against Bangladesh by an innings margins, had bounced back from their first innings deficit to reduce Bangladesh to 124 for five on the third day. 

Shane Warne and Jason Gillespie dismissed the remaining batsmen for just 24 runs this morning. 

Paceman Gillespie struck the first blow when Khaled Mashud was bowled, without opening his account, offering no stroke to a ball that nipped back sharply. 

Gillespie also dismissed the other overnight batsman Rajen Saleh (33) with leg-spinner Warne grabbing three quick scalps after going wicketless in the match so far. 

I am not bowling as well as I would like to, but it was satisfying to help the team in a tricky situation, said Gillespie. 

The match is not yet over and one should give full credit to the Bangladesh players for putting up such a stiff fight, he added. 

Warne had revenge on Rafique, trapping the left-hander leg-before after being whacked for three fours in the previous over, and then bowled Mashrafe Mortaza with his next ball. 

Haque (0) was also trapped leg-before by the leading wicket-taker as the home side lost the initiative with an all-too familiar second-innings collapse. 

Warne and Gillespie finished with three wickets each, Gillespie conceding just two runs for his two wickets this morning.

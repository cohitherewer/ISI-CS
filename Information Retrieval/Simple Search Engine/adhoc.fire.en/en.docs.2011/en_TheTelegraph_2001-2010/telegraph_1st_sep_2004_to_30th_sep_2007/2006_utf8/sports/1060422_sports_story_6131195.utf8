 Ponting slams CA

Melbourne: Australian captain Ricky Ponting has lashed out at the cricket administrators on players hectic Test schedule, saying such programme was unacceptable to him and asked for longer breaks between five-day matches. 

We just didnt have a break. Two days between most Test matches that weve just played is not nearly enough. I think we just saw the effects of that on day I in Dhaka, Ponting said. 

We certainly do need to take a look at the amount of time between Tests. I think weve played five in five weeks, in pretty extreme conditions. That, as far as Im concerned, is not acceptable, he was quoted as saying in a Melbourne based daily.

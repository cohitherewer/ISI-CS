The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan held 0-0

Margao: In a lacklustre match, Mohun Bagan dished out a goalless draw against Sporting Clube de Goa for the second successive match in the 10th ONGC National Football League played at the Nehru Stadium on Wednesday. 

Bagan ? who have failed to win in the last six outings ? have four points. They move to eighth position, while Sporting collected 10 points from six matches. 

Bagan defender Eduardos performance earned him the Man of the Match award. 

Bagans coach Jahar Das said, We should have won the match from the opportunities that we got. Now we have to play better and score when chances come our way. 

Fransa decision 

Meanwhile, the Fransa Pax management has decided to disband the team until and unless the AIFF decides to award a replay of their controversial match against Mahindra United last Monday or a point each goes against them.

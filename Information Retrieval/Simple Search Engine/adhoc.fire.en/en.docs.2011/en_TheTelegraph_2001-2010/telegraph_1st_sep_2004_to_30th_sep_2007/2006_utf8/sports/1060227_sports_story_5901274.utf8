 Dream is fulfilled: Subhajit 

 - NATIONAL TT Under-pressure Mouma lifts third title beating Mantu

 Mouma Das 

Calcutta: A three week-long training camp in China and then demolition of the countrys top player en route to lifting the maiden national title. Subhajit Saha could have expected more than that as a build-up to the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, which begins next month. 

I had been in the fray (for this title) for the past two years, but it remained a so-close-yet-so-far story for me. Im happy that my dream is fulfilled today, Subhajit told The Telegraph from Jaipur on Sunday, after he defeated his PSPB teammate and veteran Achanta Sharath Kamal 11-5, 4-11, 8-11, 11-9, 9-11, 11-9 and 11-6 in the final of the 67th National Table Tennis Championship at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. 

The training camp for three weeks that we had in China early this month benefited me a lot. They are No.1 and training according to their standards helped us put up a better performance at the Commonwealth Games this time, said Subhajit. 

Now I am confident that I can bag a medal at the Commonwealth this time, he added, his voice oozing in confidence. 

Subhajit also said that he was indebted for the title to Sharath Kamal, who on many occasions have provided him with useful tips. 

Mouma Das, on the other hand, lifted her third national title after she defeated former champion Mantu Ghosh 11-2, 11-7, 11-9, 7-11, 11-6. She also agreed on similar lines with Subhajit that the training camp in China helped her a lot to win the national title. This was her third title in seven appearances in the title-decider. 

It was a tough draw for me. In the semis, I had a tough fight with Poulami Ghatak and then, I bumped into the path of Mantu, said Mouma. 

Meanwhile the teams for the Commonwealth Games were also selected. They would leave for Melbourne on March 4 under Swedish coach Benone Cristian Grigore and newly-elected womens coach Mantu Ghosh.

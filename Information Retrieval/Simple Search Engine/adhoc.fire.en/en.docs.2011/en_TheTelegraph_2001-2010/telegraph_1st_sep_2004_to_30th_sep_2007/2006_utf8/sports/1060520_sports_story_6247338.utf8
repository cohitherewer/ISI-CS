 Greg Chappell

 Kingston: Some of Greg 

 Chappells decisions may not have gone down well with 

 everybody, but statistics dont lie ? even if they 

 dont always give the complete picture. Bottomline 

 is that the Team India coach has helped turn around our 

 one-day cricket and injected processes which should work 

 even after his contract ends next year. Chappell, who preferred 

 not to talk about former captain Sourav Ganguly, spoke to 

 The Telegraph for well over an hour at the Hilton. 

 The following are excerpts

 Q Come Saturday and you 

 complete one year as the Team India coach. What were your 

 expectations on May 20, 2005 and where did you then see 

 yourself a year on?

 A I didnt set any goals... 

 Just wanted to settle down and put in place processes to 

 help the team play better... I wanted to encourage the boys 

 play a brand of cricket which would increase the chances 

 of winning... Weve come a long way down the track 

 in the one-dayers, not so in Tests. By and large, Im 

 reasonably happy.

 What did you reflect on 

 in the short break between the end of last season and the 

 start of this tour?

 Having enjoyed the challenge, 

 I reflected positively... There were both good and bad days, 

 but the boys responded very well... Of course, while in 

 Australia, I also thought of the things which needed to 

 be done to keep the momentum going. 

 Like?

 Ive identified three areas: 

 Fitness, fielding and the running between wickets... We 

 need to get better at all three... Also, weve got 

 to apply the processes better in Test cricket. Having said 

 that, except for brief periods in Karachi where we lost, 

 the progress in the Test series in Pakistan made me happy. 

 (After a pause) The way the boys regrouped after 

 that defeat, to win the ODIs 4-1, showed courage... Showed 

 resilience... 

 Why hasnt the one-day 

 success been replicated in Tests?

 Because Test cricket is tough... 

 Its much harder... Being able to read the flow of 

 the game, being able to read situations... Its tougher 

 doing so in Tests... Takes a lot more learning... A one-day 

 game finishes in a day and its easy putting everything 

 behind you... The number of those who can play Test cricket 

 is fewer than those who play ODIs... You cant, for 

 example, expect young bowlers to walk into the Test team 

 and quickly become seasoned ones. (After a pause) 

 Weve let ourselves down in two areas in Test cricket 

 ? on occasions, we havent batted well and we havent 

 caught well. However, if we only look at the results, then 

 the entire story isnt appreciated.

 Are you conscious about 

 rankings/standings?

 Its good for the public 

 and good for the Media... The standings or rankings reflect 

 what youve done in recent times, but dont say 

 anything about how you could perform in the near future... 

 Its better, though, to be ranked in the top three 

 rather than towards the bottom... Yet, its not the 

 be all and end all. Whats important is that weve 

 got to be consistent... One bad session against a good team 

 could, for example, finish the series.

 Youve consistently 

 maintained that good teams evolve over a period...

 Indeed, yes... If you look at 

 Australia over the last 10-12 years and the West Indies 

 before that, they were good one-day teams before getting 

 to dominate Test cricket as well... Depending on how we 

 do in the four Tests in the West Indies and in South Africa 

 later this year, well have a fair idea of where were 

 going in the longer version... Whether our style is right, 

 whether the combination is right. 

 How long does it take a 

 player to really understand what Test cricket is all about?

 About 20 Tests... As Ive 

 stated, Test cricket is tough. 

 Where does your commitment 

 to excellence mantra stand?

 While the team still has a long 

 way to go towards achieving that, weve still gone 

 a long way down the road... Weve got to build partnerships 

 and, while bowling, break partnerships... Be it batting 

 or bowling, weve got to build pressure. Were 

 moving forward because the boys have accepted the process. 

 The bonding has been good.

 Is raising the bar in Test 

 cricket your biggest challenge?

 That, yes, and keeping the momentum 

 going in ODIs. To be a real force in the 2007 World Cup, 

 weve got to improve as much in the next 10 months 

 as weve done in the last 10 (beginning with the 2005-06 

 season-launching triangular in Sri Lanka). 

 The past year saw some tough 

 decisions. Did they come easy?

 Theres bound to be some 

 controversy whenever theres change... Im sure 

 all of us would like to go through life without the angst 

 and all that, but youve got to make the decisions 

 you believe in... Ive certainly made the decisions 

 I believe in... Once made, obviously, the decisions have 

 to be backed... Any team which continues to evolve needs 

 to have new personnel... A team that sits still is really 

 going backwards... This team needed revitalisation and, 

 as youve pointed out, some tough decisions had to 

 be made...

 Youre being given 

 credit for striking at the root of the star-culture... That 

 nobody is indispensable...

 That has to be the case with any 

 good team. You need a team culture, not a star culture... 

 In the long run, a team culture alone is going to survive. 

 Youve taught the players 

 a thing or two. What have you learnt in the past year?

 I wouldnt like to go into 

 details, but a lot of lessons have come out as a coach... 

 A lot of lessons have come out as a person... Ive 

 learnt more about India... Ive learnt how things operate 

 in India... In the past few months, particularly, I learnt 

 that the public and the Media werent really interested 

 in trying to understand the processes and, so, I stopped 

 trying to explain. The biggest lesson, I suppose, is that 

 Ive got to coach and not try and educate people. Thats 

 time and energy consuming and I need all the time and energy 

 to do this job.

 Have you, in this period, 

 changed as a person?

 Not greatly. Ive tried to 

 be as open and honest as possible... There have been times 

 when Ive decided to hold back on some of the things 

 I wanted to say... Other than that, I havent changed. 

 What gave you most satisfaction 

 ? the 4-1 win in the ODIs in Pakistan?

 Thats too trite... The boys 

 response has given most satisfaction... I wouldnt 

 pick on any one game or one result... Just focusing on the 

 results creates pressure... When I got the job, I realised 

 the team was result-oriented... The Media and the public, 

 too... That created pressure and, therefore, we had to remove 

 ourselves from that self-imposed pressure... We had to step 

 back and ignore that everybody else was tied up with results... 

 We had to get tied up with processes... With the sort of 

 cricket needed to be successful... The boys are enjoying 

 it as theyve realised if certain things are done correctly, 

 then they have the best chance of succeeding. A year ago, 

 we were labelled the worst chasers. Today, weve won 

 17 on-the-trot. Weve done that with focusing, building 

 partnerships and playing a low risk style of cricket. 

 Surely, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, 

 Yuvraj Singh and Irfan Pathan have made the biggest difference...

 And Rahul Dravid... I havent 

 seen him bat better... His range of shots has improved and 

 hes now a more flexible batsman... Then, Rahul has 

 been leading by example... He has been making a statement 

 both to the opposition and within. The leadership component 

 of his captaincy has played a big role. (After a pause) 

 Young Suresh Raina has made a big impact as well... I see 

 him as somebody who could have a 12-14 years career for 

 India... Even Sreesanth has had such an impact... Individuals 

 have played an important role, but its the team mentality 

 which has made the difference... We wouldnt 

 have had results if unity within the group didnt exist. 

 Remember, there used to be sensational individual performances 

 before I came, but the results were quite ordinary. We had 

 to change that high-risk style of cricket... That hit-or-miss... 

 By ensuring flexibility, weve made the team look solid. 

 Flexibility through experiments 

 or strategy?

 You could call it whatever, but 

 nothing has been done without giving it a good thought. 

 Youve had the best 

 seat watching Dravid grow as a captain. Your comments?

 Rahul has been the first to put 

 up his hand when a tough job needed to be done... The message 

 he has been sending has made the unit even stronger... Today, 

 Rahul trusts his instincts and intuition a lot more... His 

 honesty and integrity has helped him grow as a leader... 

 When needed, he has spoken sternly to the unit or to individuals... 

 His teammates see how hard he works, how determined he is 

 to get better... They know he wont ask them to do 

 something he himself wont... The boys respect him 

 for that. In fact, not only the captain, but the leadership 

 group within a unit must have integrity and honesty. Thats 

 needed for a team to go forward... Sachin Tendulkar, for 

 one, falls in that leadership group and is a shining example 

 of not taking short-cuts. 

 Who is the boss in the dressing 

 room?

 On and off the field, Rahul... 

 This is Rahuls team and Im just part of the 

 support staff. The captain is the most important person 

 in and around a cricket team. Yes, the captain and coach 

 should have a good working relationship, but dont 

 have to live in each others pocket... A coach has 

 to work hand-in-hand with the captain, because if the latter 

 isnt happy, then it wont work. I always run 

 ideas past Rahul before placing them before the group and, 

 most of the times, he has been happy with what Ive 

 proposed. At times, weve probably differed on the 

 composition of the team, but there has never been a disagreement... 

 I will make my point strongly, but from then on, its 

 up to Rahul... At the end of the day, his captaincy column 

 is going to get affected and, so, he has to make that final 

 call. If I was the captain, I would like the privilege of 

 making my own mistake rather than somebody elses. 

 I respect Rahul enough to give him the space a captain needs. 

 Im not a control freak as some have made out. 

 How long did it take the 

 two of you to gel?

 Till I became coach, I didnt 

 know Rahul well, but I always admired him as a batsman and 

 as a person... From the outside, I sensed he had character, 

 determination and integrity... That only got reinforced 

 when I began working with him... We didnt gel instantly, 

 but didnt take time either. From very early on, I 

 felt comfortable talking to him as coach... Rahul is open 

 to ideas, he reads widely... He wants to keep improving 

 as a cricketer, as a person... I admire that... Its 

 easy working with him. 

 Given the stature you enjoyed 

 as a batsman, its surprising that Virender Sehwag 

 and Mohammed Kaif went through such a horrific run... One 

 would expect batting problems to be identified and sorted 

 out quickly...

 Every batsman goes through such 

 phases and the good ones come out better at the end of it 

 all... We all go through anxiety and, when one has a few 

 failures, one gets even more anxious... It happened with 

 Kaif... (After a pause) Both have worked on a few 

 things... Both acknowledged they needed to work on a few 

 things... Whats hardest for a coach is not being able 

 to help out somebody who is struggling... Once hes 

 out of the dressing room door, hes out on his own. 

 Moreover, theres a limit to what a coach may do. He 

 creates an environment for learning, but cant force 

 a player to learn... Also, sometimes, he has to sit back 

 and bite his tongue, hoping that things will get sorted 

 out... You do need to play out a few things... At times, 

 you need to go backwards in order to go forward... Let the 

 boys learn from mistakes... I made them during my career, 

 so how can I expect others not to? A coach is like a parent... 

 Parents cant expect children not to make mistakes. 

 If they do, theyre making a mistake. A coach cant 

 be didactic... He has to be an observer, has to be flexible 

 and go with the flow of things.

 Have you, in the past year, 

 ever had a day when youve been totally relaxed?

 Its not a job with the luxury 

 of relaxing totally... But, yes, there were moments in some 

 matches when I eased off realising weve got it all 

 wrapped up... Even a coach is as good as his next performance 

 and a win today doesnt guarantee one tomorrow... Ive 

 got to be constantly vigilant and fix something before it 

 becomes a problem. I cant afford to drop my guard... 

 Its when youre complacent that you make mistakes. 

 The final one: Placed in 

 the same situation, would you do anything differently?

 No... I dont have regrets... 

 Ive backed the decisions Ive made and Im 

 not the type to look back... Ive responded to circumstances 

 with the best intentions and knowledge... Ive handled 

 the process of change in the manner I could best.

 Arsenal on the mark in derby win over Spurs

London: Arsenal beat Tottenham 3-0 in the Premier League on Saturday to maintain a seven-year unbeaten streak against their north London rivals. 

While Arsenal dominated possession and chances, Tottenham had reason to feel aggrieved at all three goals. 

Emmanuel Adebayor opened the scoring with a goal that Tottenham players claimed should have been disallowed for offside. Gilberto Silva then scored two penalties for Arsenal, the first of which was awarded for what appeared to be a fair tackle and the second which followed a possible handball in the build-up. 

Arsenal, who had lost their previous two games to Bolton and Fulham, went ahead in the first north London derby at Emirates Stadium in the 20th minute. 

Adebayor scored from a cross by Kolo Toure and celebrated by running to the touch-line and embracing club captain Thierry Henry, who missed the game with a neck injury. 

Silva made it 2-0 in the 42nd minute after defender Pascal Chimbonda had been penalised for what may have been a fair tackle on midfielder Tomas Rosicky. He scored his second penalty 30 minutes later after substitute Jermaine Jenas brought down striker Robin van Persie. (AP)

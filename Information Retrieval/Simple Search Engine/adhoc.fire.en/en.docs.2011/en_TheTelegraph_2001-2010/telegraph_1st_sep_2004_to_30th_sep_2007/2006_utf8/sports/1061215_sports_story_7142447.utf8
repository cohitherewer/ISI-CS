 PCB happy with Cup deal

Karachi: Pakistan may have lost out on the chance to host the 2011 World Cup final to India but they are pleased with the decision to have the headquarters of the central organising committee based in Lahore. 

Dr Nasim Ashraf, chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, said Thursday he was happy that the preparations for the 2011 World Cup would be made from Lahore. The PCB headquarters is also based at the Gaddafi in Lahore. 

The fact that three other hosts of the World Cup have decided to have their central organising headquarters in Lahore shows the amount of confidence they have in Pakistan cricket and its administration. It is an example of Pakistan crickets credibility abroad, Ashraf said. 

Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were given joint hosting rights of the 2011 World Cup by the ICC earlier this year 

We are satisfied with the way the matches have been distributed, he said. (PTI)

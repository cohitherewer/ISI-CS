 Tyson bores fans on return

 - Ex-champion begins World Tour

YongstowUSA): All that was missing were a few elephants, a trapeze and wo more rings. 

Everything else about the start of Mike Tysons return to boxing felt like a circus. 

The former heavyweight champion and one-time baddest man alive opened his World Tour on Friday night with a ho-hum performance in a four-round exhibition against Corey Sanders, a former sparring partner who outweighed Tyson by 50 pounds. 

Tyson, gasping for air during each of the two-and-a-minute rounds, floored Sanders early in the first round and then had to hold up his opponent moments later after staggering him with a flurry of punches. 

It was fun, thats my first time boxing since my last fight, said Tyson, who retired last year after quitting after six rounds in a loss to Kevin McBride. I didnt know how tough it would be. 

Wearing his familiar black shoes and blank trunks, Tyson entered the ring at 12.23 am to a rousing ovation from about 4,000 fans in the 6,000-seat Chevrolet Centre, home of the Youngstown Steel Hounds, a minor league hockey team. 

The arena, which will host a concert by Disneys Doodlebops on Saturday, erupted as Tyson made his way to the ring. But not long after Tyson knocked down Sanders, the warm buzz quickly faded. 

With Tyson and Sanders locked up like two ballroom dancers, the crowd first began a vulgar chant directed at Tyson and the fans soon began to boo at what looked more like a pillow fight than a boxing match. 

Tyson responded with right-left combination that buckled Sanders. 

But instead of finishing off his opponent the way he used to, Tyson wrapped his arms around Sanders to prevent him from hitting the canvas. 

It was more of the same in the second and third rounds as Tyson pawed at Sanders who wore headgear with an occasional roundhouse left or uppercut. (AP)

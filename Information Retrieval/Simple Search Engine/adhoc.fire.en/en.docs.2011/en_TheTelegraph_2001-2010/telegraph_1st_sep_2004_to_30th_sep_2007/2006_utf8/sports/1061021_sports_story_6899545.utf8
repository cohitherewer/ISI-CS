 Squad on October 30: Vengsarkar

 Tour of SA 

Indore: The selectors will watch the ongoing Duleep Trophy and Indias Champions Trophy match against Australia before they meet to announce the squad for the tour of South Africa later this year. The team will be announced on October 30 after the selectors watch the current matches being played in the Duleep Trophy and also India-Australia match in Mohali, chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar said on Friday. 

After the South African tour, the team will also play five one-day matches each against Sri Lanka and the West Indies. 

On whether former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly is performing well enough to be in the Indian squad, Vengsarkar said: it is for everybody to see, why you are asking me? everybody has a chance to come back into the team. 

Vengsarkar also supported the experiments being done by coach Greg Chappell.

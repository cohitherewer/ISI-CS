 Connors to coach Roddick

Los Angeles: Andy Roddick named Jimmy Connors as his new coach on Monday as the former World No.1 looks to rekindle his career. 

Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion and runner-up at Wimbledon in 2004 and 2005, has not won a title this year and slipped out of the top 10 rankings earlier this month for the first time since 2002. 

First of all, its just belief, the 23-year-old said on the sidelines of the Los Angeles Open over his reasons for linking up with the legendary left-hander. 

It means a lot when someone who has won as many tennis championships as Jimmy Connors comes through and says, I believe in you. I think you can really do some great things, and heres how. 

Connors, one of tennis most fiery competitors, said he wanted to instil some of his famed intensity in Roddick and help lead him back to the top of the world rankings. 

Its not rocket science, my job is quite simply to make Andy the best player that he can be. 

I would like to try to give him a little bit of what made me what I was, added Connors, who won a record 105 singles events including eight Grand Slam titles. 

Connors and Roddick first discussed the possibility of joining forces after the French Open. Roddick spent the week leading up to last weeks RCA Championships in Indianapolis training with Connors. 

Roddick advanced to the final in Indianapolis on Sunday before losing 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 to Davis Cup teammate James Blake. 

Connors said he never would have imagined himself as a coach and called it a great opportunity. 

Its not always in the game. Its the intangibles that could make the difference, along with a few tweaks here and there. Im not sitting down there breaking down and criticising everything, said Connors, who won 109 titles and four Grand Slams. 

Roddick was coached by Brad Gilbert in 2003, but parted ways in 2004 and since then Roddick has worked with Dean Goldfine and brother, John. 

Neither Roddick nor Connors would, or could, clarify the parameters of their relationship. 

Connors said, were just starting out and will try to get through this year and see how things go, and Roddick said he wasnt sure how much time they would spend together. 

Connors is a willing participant, though, after some initial reluctance.

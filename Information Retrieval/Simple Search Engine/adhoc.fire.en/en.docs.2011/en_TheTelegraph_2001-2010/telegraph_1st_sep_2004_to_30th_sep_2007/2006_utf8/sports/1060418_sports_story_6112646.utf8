The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Again, no place for Kaif in XI

 - Musharraf to watch todays face-off 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sehwag 

 Calcutta: Virender Sehwag, 

 who was rested in the last ODI (Indore, versus England), 

 will return to the Team India XI in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. 

 In all probability, the vice-captain is going to open with 

 Robin Uthappa in the first of two day-night matches against 

 Pakistan. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources in the UAE capital, the out-of-form Mohammed Kaif 

 will again sit out. Hes not in the XII shortlisted 

 late on Monday evening and nobody expects him to get a call-up 

 on Wednesday either. 

Also out of contention are quicks Rudra Pratap Singh, whose confidence has taken a hit after the tour of Pakistan, and Munaf Patel. The toss-up, one understands, is between Ajit Agarkar and Yalaka Venugopal Rao. 

The Indians, of course, take to this short series on an absolute high ? a 5-1 win over England. Then, earlier this year, Rahul Dravids team had beaten Pakistan 4-1 in Pakistan. 

 Meanwhile, sources have indicated 

 that Pakistans President Pervez Musharraf is going 

 to watch Tuesdays face-off, which will mark Abu Dhabis 

 debut as the newest centre for big-time cricket.

 LIKELY INDIAN XI 

 Virender Sehwag, Robin Uthappa, Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, 

 Suresh Raina, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Yalaka Venugopal Rao/Ajit 

 Agarkar, Irfan Pathan, Ramesh Powar, Harbhajan Singh, Sreesanth

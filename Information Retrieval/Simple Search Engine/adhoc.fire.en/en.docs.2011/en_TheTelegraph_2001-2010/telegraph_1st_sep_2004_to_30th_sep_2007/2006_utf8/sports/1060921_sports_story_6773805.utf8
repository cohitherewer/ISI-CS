The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are out of the race: Bhowmick

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Subhas Bhowmick admitted on Wednesday that Mohammedan Sportings chances of winning the CFL Premier Division are now over. And its time to look ahead, for another challenge in yet another tournament. 

This league is finished for us Were no longer in the title-race now, he said, after his teams 0-1 loss to Mohun Bagan. 

In the same breath, the Mohammedan Sporting coach pointed out that Bhaichung Bhutia made the difference between the teams. He got one chance and he scored. This is why hes such an excellent striker, Bhowmick said of the Mohun Bagan scorer. 

What were the reasons behind his teams failure to live up to expectations in the league? Bhowmick pondered and then added: There is too much inexperience in my team. We also couldnt produce wing-play much to our liking. 

Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, on the other hand, felt that his team should have won by a bigger margin. We got at least four clear chances, but couldnt convert them. I need to rectify this problem in practice sessions, he remarked. 

 Bhattacharya, though, was critical of Dharamjit Singhs marching orders and rued that he would miss his services against East Bengal. He (Dharamjit) needs to curb his temper Ill soon sit with him about this, the coach maintained.

 Maiden gold for China eves

Aarhus (Denmark): China upstaged favourites the United States to storm to their first womens team title at the world gymnastics championships on Wednesday. 

Zhang Nans deft footwork on the balance beam, coupled with soaring tumbling sequences on the floor by Cheng Fei and Pang Panpan, handed China a winning total of 182.200. 

A fall from the asymmetric bars by Chellsie Memmel and Jana Biegers botched landing from the vault cost the 2003 champions the title. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Clockwork fancied 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Its going to be a family picnic for trainer Vijay Singh on Wednesday. The trainer has a strong grip over the days seven-event card. His Clockwork may win the main event, the Mandolin Cup. The filly badly needed her last run and she seems to have come on a lot since. 

 While Vijays Andrology and Asterisk may also deliver the goods in their respective events, wife Sharons partly-owned horse, Awesum Attitude, is expected to strike again as the four-year-olds last victory was simply smashing.

 Barnabee, owned by Sharons kin, is also in with a good chance to win the 1,200m No Regrets Cup.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 West Bromwich player stabbed 

Manchester: West Bromwich Albion midfielder Ronnie Wallwork was in stable condition Friday after being stabbed at a Manchester nightclub. 

Wallwork, a former Manchester United player who is now on loan at Football League Championship side Barnsley, was knifed at the Sugar Lounge bar in Manchester city centre on Thursday night. 

The 29-year-old player was stabbed in the hand, stomach and back. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was listed in stable condition. 

Detectives believe this was not a random attack and are making further inquiries to trace the offender, Greater Manchester police said in a statement. 

Wallwork has played two games for Barnsley this season after going on loan from West Brom in September. 

 Larsson move 

Meanwhile, veteran striker Henrik Larsson will join Manchester United on loan during Swedens winter offseason. 

The 35-year-old will go to United when the transfer window opens on January 1 and return on March 12 before the Swedish league starts, Larssons club Helsingborg said. 

Alex Ferguson called last night and welcomed me to the club, a Swedish tabloid quoted Larsson as saying at a news conference in Helsingborg on Friday. Its a good time period, not too long and not too short. I discussed it with my family and when they said OK, there was no hesitation. 

 Ferguson said Larsson, one of 

 Swedens greatest ever players, would be a terrific 

 boost for Uniteds attack with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 

 and Alan Smith sidelined with injuries. (AP)

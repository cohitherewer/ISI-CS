The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

A STAFF REPORTER

 Avishek 

Calcutta: Riding high on his impressive debut for Bengal in the 2005-06 Ranji season, Avishek Jhunjhunwala feels that he is ready to make his mark for India A, too. 

The right-handed batsman was included in the India A squad, along with medium-pacer Shib Shankar Paul, for the six-nation meet to be played in Abu Dhabi later this month (as reported in Tuesdays Late City edition). Paul has played for India A before. 

I know it will be tough but I am ready for the challenge. There are some India A players who have already cemented their place in Team India. I, too, hope to grab all the opportunities that come my way, Avishek said. 

Avishek, also a good fielder, expressed his gratitude to Bengal coach Paras Mhambrey. He has been instrumental behind my success. I am grateful to him and my teammates. 

Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta showered accolades on Avishek. 

Deep said that it was a good opportunity for Avishek and hoped he would make his presence felt. He is a good find. In fact he is a good package with his batting and fielding skills.

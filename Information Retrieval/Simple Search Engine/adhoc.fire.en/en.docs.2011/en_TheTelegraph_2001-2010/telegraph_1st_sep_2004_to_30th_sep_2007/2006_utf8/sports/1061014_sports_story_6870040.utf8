 Arjun among top 10

Sanya (China): Arjun Singh gave a huge boost to his chances of securing playing rights on the Asian Tour next year by carding a fine four-under 68 to jump into top-10 after two rounds at the Volkswagen Masters-China at the Yalong Bay Golf Club. 

Arjun, who was two-under after the first round, was lying at six-under and a good finish could put him on way to a top-60 finish at the end of the season, and also earn a berth into the Volvo Masters of Asia in December. 

Meanwhile, defending champion Retief Goosen of South Africa cruised into a three-shot halfway lead on the strength of a brilliant seven-under-par 65. 

Though Arjun was lying eighth, the Indian star of the day was Gurbaaz Mann, who had a bogey-free six-under 66 that included five birdies on the back nine. He was tied 15th, while Digvijay Singh, despite a closing bogey, had a one-under 71 and was tied 23rd at three-under 141 for 36 holes. 

Also making the cut was Amandeep Johl, who shot a second straight even par 72 and was tied 50th. 

But Harinder Gupta (78) missed the cut at nine-over and Sujjan Singh (82) was 12-over. 

The world number seven Goosen overcame a stuttering outward nine before roaring home in 30, which included four birdies and a superb eagle at his last hole for an outstanding two-day total of 15-under-par 129. 

Overnight leader Lu Wen-teh of Chinese Taipei and 2005 US Open champion Michael Campbell head the chasing pack after a 69 and 68, respectively, in the $300,000 Asian Tour event.

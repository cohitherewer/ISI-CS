 Safin ousts top seed Blake 

Washington: Marat Safin, showing signs of the form that once made him the worlds top-ranked player, beat US top seed and world No. 5 James Blake 7-6 (8-6), 7-6 (7-5) at the Washington Classic. 

The 26-year-old Russian, building confidence in his comeback following a left knee injury, advanced to the quarter finals of the $ 600,000 US Open tune-up event with his fourth victory over a top-10 foe since his return. 

These kind of matches are the most important. Playing good, bad, with a lot of luck these are the ones that are going to give you the confidence, Safin said. 

The 2000 US Open and 2005 Australian Open champion remains confident he can return to the top despite the recent Grand Slam domination by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. 

Im trying. Im not sure Ill be able to be there, Safin said. But I still have hope and believe with hard work and a little bit of luck, by a little more skill and focus and consistency, I think Ill be able. 

Safin would next take on South African Wesley Moodie. Moodie eliminated Dane Kenneth Carlsen 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (8-6). 

Other quarter-finals pit third seed Lleyton Hewitt against Arnaud Clement, eighth seed Andy Murray against Mardy Fish and Tim Henman against Russian Dmitry Tursunov. 

Tursunov nearly joined Blake on the sidelines before rallying past Lee Hyung-Taik 6-7 (10-12), 7-5, 6-3 in an early morning finish. 

Hewitt beat Germanys Denis Gremelmayr 6-1, 6-4. Hewitt won his first ATP title in almost 17 months in June at Queens and has won 14 of his past 17 starts, including a Wimbledon quarter-final run. 

Clement, ranked 57th, eliminated fifth seed Domink Hrbaty 6-3, 6-2 . his first victory in four career meetings with the Slovakian. Murray beat Spains Feliciano Lopez 7-5, 6-2. 

Henman beat Jan-Michael Gambill 6-1, 6-3, in the Americans first ATP event of the season.

 Bangladesh athlete fined

Melbourne: A Bangladeshi Commonwealth Games athlete was fined A$1,000 after pleading guilty to indecently assaulting a female worker at the Games village, Australian media reported on Monday. 

Taufiqar Rahman, 40, appeared at the Melbourne Magistrates Court charged with two counts of indecent assault. 

A prosecutor told the court Rahman had grabbed the woman without her consent after she had agreed to hug him, Australian Associated Press reported. 

Rahman admitted the offence and apologised. He was fined A$1,000 but a conviction was not entered. 

The assault case was one of two at the Games village.

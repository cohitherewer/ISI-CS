 Woods, Mickelson knocked out

Carlsbad: US Ryder Cup captain Tom Lehman knocked out holder David Toms, while Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson were both ousted in Fridays third round on a day of upsets at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. 

World No.1 Woods, bidding for his third title of the year in four starts, struggled with his putting before losing a tight battle with Chad Campbell by a hole. 

Mickelson, who never led at any stage of his match with Britains David Howell, went out 3 amp;1 at a sun-drenched La Costa Resort and Spa. 

There were also victories for Davis Love III, who beat fellow American Chris DiMarco 3 amp;2, and Irelands Padraig Harrington, who overcame Vijai Singh after 19 scrappy holes. 

World No.3 Retief Goosen, who shaded Briton Luke Donald by a hole, was the only player among the tournaments top 10 seeds to book a place in the quarter finals. 

In the days top tie, twice champion Woods battled to make putts on the front nine at La Costa and was three down with eight to play before mounting a rally. 

He chipped in for an eagle-three from just off the edge of the green at the 11th and won the 12th with a par after Campbell missed the green to the left off the tee. 

Campbell, who had lost in the third round in his two previous appearances at La Costa, countered with an eight-foot birdie putt at the par-four 13th to restore his two-hole advantage. 

But he effectively gifted the next hole to Woods, finding thick rough to the left of the green with his approach and chunking his third shot into a greenside bunker on the way to a double-bogey six. 

After Campbell missed a birdie putt from 29 feet at the last, Woods had a chance to take the match into extra time but failed to sink his birdie attempt from 13 feet. (REUTERS)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Revised ties in city on Jan. 21, 25 

New Delhi: With just a round of the national football league completed, the AIFF has again changed the schedule citing ground unavailability and security constraints. 

Mahindra Uniteds home match against JCT, which was originally scheduled for Mumbai on January 23, has been shifted to Goa and would now be played on January 20. 

The Cooperage, which was supposed to stage the match, was in pretty bad shape and the federation had to move the game out of the city. 

Mahindras match with their local rivals Air India has been postponed for the same reason. No fresh date has been announced for the game. 

Also, the matches marked for the Salt Lake Stadium in Calcutta on January 18, 19 and 20 have been postponed to January 21 and 25. 

The state government had expressed its inability to provide adequate security arrangements as there was a CII Partnership Summit scheduled at the same venue. 

According to the changed itinerary, Mohammedan Sporting take on Salgaocar on January 21 while the East Bengal-Fransa-Pax and the Mohun Bagan-JCT encounters will take place on January 25 at the same venue. 

The first phase of the NFL, which was previously scheduled to end on February 9, will now do so two days earlier with only seven rounds of fixtures completed. 

This is to accommodate the national camp for the Asian Cup 2007 qualifiers.

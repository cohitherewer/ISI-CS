Dhanbad: After losing to Assam in their third match of the East Zone one-dayers on Friday, chart leaders Bengal are in no mood to take chances in their last match to be played here on Sunday when they take on Orissa in their last group match. 

Quite naturally, Bengal contingent had a gruelling practice session at the Tata Digwadih Stadium on Saturday. Bengal need a win to finish at the zone toppers. 

Team members along with coach Paras Mahambrey and manager Samir Dasgupta also discussed the strategy for Sundays match against Orissa. 

Sourav, who looked tensed till last night, for the first time looked relaxed. Apart from concentrating on batting and giving tips to teammates, he also played football with national selector Ranjib Biswal. 

The former India captain also spent some time perhaps discussing his future plans with Biswal and his chances of making it to the national squad to play against England next month. 

When approached by media person, Sourav politely refused to speak. There is nothing new on which I have to make a comment. I will definitely talk after February 23, he said. 

Incidentally, the selectors are scheduled to meet on that day for announcement of the Indian squad for England series. 

Biswal, a former Orissa captain, also refused to throw any light on the essence of his discussion with Sourav. We are good friends since my cricketing days. We just had a friendly chat, said Biswal. 

However, sources revealed that with the injury of some players in current national squad, the chances of Sourav making it to the squad have become bright. There are chances that Sourav may get a look in, revealed the sources. 

Officials of the Bengal squad pointed out that they are at a secured position above the other teams after managing a bonus point in the first match against Tripura. The squad has nine points followed by Jharkhands eight. 

The team also have four players ? Sourav, Deep Dasgupta, Lamxi Ratan Shukla and Shib Shankar Paul ? who have international exposures, said a Bengal official.

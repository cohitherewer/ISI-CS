 India A make title round

 World Snooker

 New Delhi: Former world 

 champion Pankaj Advani displayed his skills against fancied 

 Thailand to propel India A into the final of the World Snooker 

 Team Championship at San Jose.

 According to information received 

 here, Advani once again asserted his supremacy over Kobkit 

 Palajin, whom he had defeated in the 2004 World Championship 

 final, by carving a fine 57-22, 117-8, 21-22 victory, which 

 included a break of 82.

 Manan Chandra posted a win over 

 Atthasit Mahitthi, but Yasin Merchant lost two of the three 

 frames against Phaithoon Phonbun.

 In the final, India will face 

 England, who had beaten them in the league phase earlier 

 in the tournament. England routed Hong Kong 6-1 in the other 

 best of nine-frame semi-final.

 Earlier, India A had defeated 

 Australia 5-2 in the quarter finals while India B team lost 

 to Hong Kong 3-5.

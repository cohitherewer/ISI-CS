The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I havent done anything 

 big, says Biswajit

 - Back-to-back wins take Mohun Bagan to fourth place

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya does not wish to take any credit for the teams recent success after the disastrous show at the start of the National League this season. Two consecutive victories against Fransa Pax and Air India have changed the clubs fortunes that saw them jump three places to fourth position with 11 points from nine encounters. 

I havent done anything big? I dont think I have brought about any revolution as such? I only reminded the players about the role they could play in restoring the clubs pride and fortunes, Biswajit told The Telegraph on return to the city on Monday. 

Bagan defeated Air India 2-0 in Mumbai on Sunday, the goals coming from Dharamjit Singh and Coffi Agbessi. 

Biswajit doesnt agree Bagan are out of the danger zone. Only if we can win our next home match against Salgaocar, we can breathe easy. But there will be no room for complacency.. 

I dont deserve any credit? The footballers and officials should take it all? The footballers body language suggested that they wanted to do something. I have only brought about small modifications to their gameplan according to my abilities. Its good that we have been achieving success. 

Its hardly been ten days since I took charge. Its not possible to bring about any major change in such a timeframe. The good work done about by Amal Datta and Jahar Das since the start of the season is also paying dividends. You cannot ignore their contributions, the coach clarified.

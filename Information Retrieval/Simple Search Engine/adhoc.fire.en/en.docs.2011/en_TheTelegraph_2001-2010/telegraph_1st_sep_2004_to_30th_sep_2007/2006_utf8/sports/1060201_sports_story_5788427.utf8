 Jaipur inspection

Jaipur: The first step towards finding alternative venues for the ICC Champions Trophy was taken on Tuesday with the representatives of ICC and GCC inspecting the Sawai Man Singh Stadium here. 

The ICC had announced Calcutta, Mumbai and Delhi as the three cities to host matches of the tournament in October-November. But following commercial glitches at venues like Delhi and Mumbai, the BCCI has asked the ICC to think of other venues. 

Jaipur as emerged as a strong contender. Nagpur, Mohali and Hyderabad are the other centres in the running to host matches.

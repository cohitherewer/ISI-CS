Calcutta: Rarely has a 0-3 defeat been so refreshing. Bhaichung Bhutia put the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Saudi Arabia into perspective when he said: I dont remember the last time we created so many opportunities against a tough opposition in an international match. 

The India captain was also impressed by the teams ability to keep trying till the end despite having gone 0-3 down after 52 minutes. 

Luck was not with us today. Inexperience was also a factor, said Bhaichung, obviously referring to Manjit Singh, who played well but missed at least three chances. 

Even Bob Houghton was impressed. 

We had the worst possible start, but all in all, it was a good performance. Im not too down-hearted (despite the margin of defeat), said Houghton. This was Indias first full-fledged international outing under their British coach. 

The worst possible start was the second-minute goal N.S. Manju presented on a platter to Saudi Arabia when he tried to dribble past Al Kahtani Yasser, and surrendered possession inside the penalty box. 

It was very difficult to recover from that moment we had worked very hard for this match, but that second-minute goal knocked the confidence out of us, said Houghton. 

The second half was much better, we worked the ball around and moved up like we wanted to do and created some chances. 

The coach was especially pleased with the way his players performed in the final 30 minutes. 

We were playing against a very good team Our performance in the last half an hour gave us hope and showed that we are capable of competing against top teams. Of course, we have to maintain that level for 90 minutes, not just 30, remarked Houghton. 

Manjit was very good, Bhaichung played well too, said Houghton, defending the introduction of Alvito DCunha late in the game. 

He (DCunha) was lively, but not fully fit. Once he is in shape, well be able to use him better, maybe in the return match versus Saudi Arabia. 

The teams meet again in Jeddah on September 6. The preparatory camp for that game begins in Goa on September 6.

 Heinze set to play

Rome: Defender Gabriel Heinze should be a certainty for Argentina in their World Cup warm-up against Angola in Salerno on Tuesday. 

Heinze will be making his first proper outing since he damaged knee ligaments in a Champions League game for Manchester United last September and is in dire need of match practice. 

Im fine, relaxed luckily, Heinze said as Argentina prepared in Rome for the friendly prior to their trip to their Nuremberg base on Wednesday. Now we have to keep working for the dream. (REuters)

 Charlton warning to Cristiano

London: Cristiano Ronaldo is likely to face a hostile reception at the start of the new English Premiership season but will have to brave the boos, Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton warned on Tuesday. 

Charlton added that running away from the problem by leaving Manchester United would have made the young Portuguese wingers problems even worse. 

Ronaldo returned to Manchester United training on Monday following an eventful World Cup in which he shone as a player but was roundly jeered from the stands. 

England supporters were enraged after the winger apparently tried to influence the referee to send off his United teammate Wayne Rooney during Portugals quarter final victory. 

Rooney initially expressed his disappointment, but later reportedly made up with the 21-year-old. (AFP)

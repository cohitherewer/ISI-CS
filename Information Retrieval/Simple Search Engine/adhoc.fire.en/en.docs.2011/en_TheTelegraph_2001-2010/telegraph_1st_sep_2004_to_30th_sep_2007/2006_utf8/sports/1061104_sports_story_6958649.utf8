 IMRAN KHANS VISION

 Imran Khan

The talismanic Imran Khan, World Cup-winning captain who is now a Member of the National Assembly in Pakistan, spoke on his vision for cricket at the ICCs annual awards ceremony. The following are excerpts: 

I would like cricket spread to other countries, like the US and China... The Twenty20 is a brilliant way of doing so... Because its a shorter game, people find it easier to understand... Five-day cricket couldnt be understood by everybody... 

I would like to see more technology in the game... The lesser the human errors, the fairer the results... Till neutrals came on the scene, umpires tended to be patriotic and they would be more patriotic in India versus Pakistan matches... 

I would like to see the first-class structure changing... The way to improve that is to have high-class domestic cricket... When my party comes to power, Pakistan will have the best format and were then going to regularly beat Australia!

 Injury my own doing: Shoaib

London: Shoaib Akhtar says the recurrence of his knee injury, which has forced him out of the early part of the England tour, was a result of his over enthusiasm. 

Akhtar said his desperation to return to international cricket prompted him to start training before he had fully recuperated from an earlier injury. 

Missing the start of the England tour is disappointing but it is my own fault. I was so keen to make the tour that I bowled too early at the training camp and opened up my fracture again, he said. 

It was a case of too much too soon. I worked so hard then to make the tour, I pushed myself too much. These things happen in cricket, he said. 

Shoaib, however, said now he just could not wait to take on England. Im pleased to report that Im feeling good, my stress fracture has healed, there is zero pain and I cant wait to start playing again. 

Shoaib said he needed to listen to the experts. I dont feel that is up to me because if it was, I would be playing tomorrow... I feel really fit and just want to bowl but after what happened last time, I know I need to listen to advice from the experts. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Drama at The Oval 

Test cricket has seen a slew of controversies over the years. A new chapter was added on Sunday when the ball-tampering drama (read: farce) was enacted at The Oval on the penultimate day of the fourth and final Test. Following is Sundays sequence of events (timings in GMT): 

 1.34 pm: Umpires Darrell 

 Hair and Billy Doctrove examine the ball after Umar Guls 

 14th over. Hair, believing the condition of the ball to 

 have been unfairly altered, signals to the scorers that 

 Pakistan will be penalised five runs. Ball is changed 

 3.43 pm: Hair and Doctrove, and England batsmen 

 Paul Collingwood and Ian Bell, return to the field after 

 tea but theres no sign of the Pakistan team. Officials 

 and batsmen return to pavilion 

 3.54 pm: Umpires and batsmen 

 return to field, but still no Pakistan team. Bails are removed 

 and the covers come on 

 4.19 pm: Covers come off. 

 Match Referee Mike Procter, English cricket chief David 

 Morgan and Pakistan counterpart Shaharyar Khan seen in deep 

 discussions on balcony 

 4.24 pm: Skipper Inzamam-ul 

 Haq leads the Pakistan team back onto the field, but now 

 there is no sign of the umpires who insist that the original 

 Pakistan no-show after tea means the match has been conceded 

 4.41 pm: Shaharyar tells 

 reporters: The boys are extremely upset at the slur 

 of ball-tampering. As a result they registered a protest 

 with the Match Referee for the decision unilaterally taken 

 by the umpires. Once we did that, we were ready to go out 

 and play but it seems the umpires are reluctant to go out 

 5.13 pm: Play called off for the day 

 6.30 pm: Procter says talks 

 will continue in an effort to solve impasse

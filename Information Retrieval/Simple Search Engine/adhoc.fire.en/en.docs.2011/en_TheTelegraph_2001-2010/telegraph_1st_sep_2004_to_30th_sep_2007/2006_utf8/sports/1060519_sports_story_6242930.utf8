The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ive never been a great believer in technology: Chappell

 - Im not sure whether youll get to a situation where its going to be perfect 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Greg Chappell 

 Kingston: Nobody sees Greg 

 Chappell as a conservative coach, but his views on more 

 technology for decision-making is bound to be labelled conservative. 

 In fact, hes horrified at the prospect of the human 

 element being gradually reduced. 

The International Cricket Council, though, is moving in that direction. 

 Look, Ive never been 

 a great believer in technology... All umpires make mistakes, 

 but the human touch is one of the attractions of the game... 

 Im not sure whether youll ever get to a situation 

 where its going to be perfect and Im not sure 

 whether we should be trying to make it so, Chappell 

 told The Telegraph. 

Speaking at the Hilton in the lead-up to the one-day series, he added: I accept technology has worked well in some areas, like run outs and stumpings... However, if four people are watching a replay on TV, its possible there could be a 2-2 divide or a 3-1 split over a decision... Trying to be perfect is an impossible goal... 

According to Chappell, there have been instances when technology suggested the ball would miss the stumps when, in fact, it hit them. In much the same way, there have been occasions when technology indicated the ball would hit the stumps when there was no way in the world it could. 

People tell me theres a lot of money at stake and that careers could be marred... Perhaps, that is so... As for me, Ive got to be convinced that more technology actually is in the best interests of the game... At the moment, Im not, Chappell declared. 

He added: One of the great things about cricket is the courage and discipline it takes to accept a wrong decision and pledge to try your best in the next innings... The trouble really is that, as human beings, we tend to notice our bad luck but wont talk about the good fortune... 

In Chappells view, players get the umpires they dese- rve. 

As he put it: If youll put them under pressure, theyre bound to make mistakes... Rather than trying to correct that with more technology, the players need to be educated (on appealing)... I think the umpires, who always have the TV cameras on them, do a fantastic job... 

My impression over the last 14-15 years is that umpires get between 80-90 per cent of the decisions right... Thats a very high percentage... I would have been for more technology had it been 50-50... Lets not try to solve a problem which really isnt that big... 

 Chappell declined to comment on Steve Bucknors 

 allegations (about doctoring against TV producers) saying 

 he hadnt read what the record-scripting umpire had 

 said. Its not going to be proper to react, 

 he signed off.

 Teamgeist finds no takers among goalies 

 Stuttgart: When the official World Cup ball was launched amid great fanfare by Adidas, much was made of its name Teamgeist, German for team spirit. 

Halfway through the finals, however, some of the worlds leading goalkeepers are not convinced their welfare was on top of the German sporting goods manufacturers priorities. 

Fans love to see the ball whistling into the top corner and they have not been disappointed so far in what has been a hugely entertaining tournament. 

However, they should spare a thought for the men between the posts who say the ball ? which had to undergo stringent laboratory testing ? is proving to be a tough adversary. 

Its a lot more difficult (being a goalkeeper) than 10 years ago because the players are so much more physical and the balls so much harder and faster, Frances 1998 World Cup-winning keeper Fabien Barthez said just before the finals. 

I wouldnt like to be a 20-year-old doing this. Balls have kept getting harder and faster. At this World Cup you will see a lot of goals scored from 30 or 35 metres. 

Adidas say the ball, which comprises a revolutionary new design of 14 panels, provides significant improvements in precision and control. 

Witness strikes like Decos for Portugal against Iran, Serhiy Rebrovs thunderbolt for Ukraine versus Saudi Arabia or Robin Van Persies guided missile of a free-kick against Ivory Coast, and it is obvious that strikers are, literally, having a ball. 

The poor old goalkeepers, however, are feeling the strain, saying the Teamgeist is lighter, faster and a little more elusive than previous models. 

Portugals Ricardo has yet to pick the ball out of his net, but has seen enough damage inflicted on fellow members of the goalies union to keep him awake at night. 

The ball is very light and at high speed it is very difficult for us. Maybe in the rest of the tournament we will see some very good goals. Fifa is more concerned about creating goals in football which makes life uncomfortable for goalkeepers. 

American Kasey Keller, one of the most experienced keepers at the tournament, agrees having watched the ball in action. 

Its a very light, fast ball. From its starting point, you basically think you have an extra bit of time. Its fractions of a second, he said. You think the ball will be there, but its actually here. Its got a wobble as its coming at you. You have no idea what its going to do. 

I think youll see a lot of goalkeepers over-dive on it, he added, noting that he also expects to see more keepers punching shots away rather than risk trying to catch them. 

Its a technology thing and we have to deal with it as goalkeepers. Its definitely not a goalkeeper-friendly ball. 

Spains Iker Casillas continued the theme. It certainly flies about and the strikers love that, but its not easy for goalkeepers. They never seem to ask goalkeepers to take part in the development of the new balls...

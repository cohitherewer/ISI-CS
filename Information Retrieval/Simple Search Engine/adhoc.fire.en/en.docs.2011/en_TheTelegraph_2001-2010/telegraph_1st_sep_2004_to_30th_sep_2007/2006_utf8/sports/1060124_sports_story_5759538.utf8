 Tapie a bad influence

Paris: Arsenals French manager Arsene Wenger has described former Olympique Marseille chairman Bernard Tapie as a bad influence on French soccer. 

It did not surprise me, Wenger said when asked about comments by former Marseille player Jean-Jacques Eydelie, who accused Tapie of various misdemeanours when he was in charge of Marseille in the early 1990s. 

Those are things that I know, that many people knew, said Wenger, who coached Monaco from 1987 to 1994. 

We are talking about the worst period French football has been through. It was gangrenous from the inside because of the influence and the methods of Tapie at Marseille.

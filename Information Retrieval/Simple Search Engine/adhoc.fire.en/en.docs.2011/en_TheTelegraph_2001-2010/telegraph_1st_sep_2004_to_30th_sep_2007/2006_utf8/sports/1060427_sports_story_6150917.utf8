 Shed friendly attitude towards England

 - Steve Waughs formula for regaining the Ashes 

 Its a defining tour for both sides, feels Steve 

London: Australia need to shed their friendly attitude towards the Englishmen if they are to regain the Ashes later this year, according to former captain Steve Waugh. 

Waugh says Ricky Pontings men were too friendly with the English last summer and lost a bit of their aura as a result. 

I thought from the sidelines perhaps they were a little bit too friendly, Waugh said. 

They were using England players nicknames in the press and that was something that hadnt been done before. They may have become too familiar to England, the former captain was quoted as saying in BBC Sport. 

Waugh, who led the Australians to two Ashes victories before hanging his boots in 2004, said being reserved helped in intimidating the opposition. 

Recalling his first Test against the West Indies when they were at their prime, Waugh said the Caribbean attitude of keeping to themselves had an impact over Australias performance. 

When I first played West Indies we didnt know much about them, they kept pretty much to themselves and that gave you self doubts on the field, he explained. 

As you get to know players more you become less intimidated by them. 

Waugh said the English team was impressive in the Test series against India but they could not be judged by that one single performance. 

Something youve got to learn to come to grips with, particularly in England after such a lot of time not winning, is euphoria, he said. 

England have got to get back switched on because if they lose this series in Australia people will say, has England really progressed that much? Waugh said. 

The former captain said the upcoming Ashes would determine which side had learnt the lessons from the past. 

Its a defining tour for both sides. Can Australia reassert themselves or can England consolidate what theyve done? he said.

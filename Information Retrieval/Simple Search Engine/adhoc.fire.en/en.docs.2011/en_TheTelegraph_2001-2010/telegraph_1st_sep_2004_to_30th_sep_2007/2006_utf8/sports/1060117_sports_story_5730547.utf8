 Gopal holds Surya

New Delhi: Second seed Surya Sekhar Ganguly was held after a brilliant display of tactical chess by former national under-19 champion G.N. Gopal in the third round of the Parsvnath International Open Chess Championships on Monday. 

With players on most other boards also splitting points on Day II, only 17 out of the overnight 32 players maintained their lead, tallying three points out of a possible three. 

Six of the 14 Grandmasters featuring in the event ? top seed Alexei Fedorov of Belarus, Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh, Nurlan Ibraev of Kazakhstan, Marat Dzhumaev of Uzbekistan, Niaz Murshed of Bangladesh and R.B. Ramesh ? continued to be among the leaders. 

Besides, Surya, the highest rated Indian GM in the event, GMs Sandipan Chanda, Alexender Raetsky and Konstantin Chernusov of Russia also settled for draws, slipping to second spot with 2.5 points. 

GM-norm holder Parimarjan Negi maintained his winning streak as he defeated world under-12 champion N. Srinath. 

Employing the Sicilian Najdorf Variation, Surya, playing white, was completely surprised by 15-year-old IM norm holder Gopal. 

Surya diverted from regular line in the 11th move to follow his own preparation but lost track in the middle game that gave Gopal the chance to defend. The peace was signed in 47 moves. 

On the other boards, Sandipan missed a sure win, while Barua capitalised on his young Soumitra Majumdars inexperience to come back from the jaws of defeat. 

Sandipan was in great position with two pawns up but in the end game his rook-bishop against rook-knight position pushed the game to a draw.

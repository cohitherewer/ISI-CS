 Harikrishna downs Almasi again

 HUNGARY MEET

Paks (Hungary): Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna took a decisive step in his quest to lift the third Marx Gyorgy International Chess title after scoring a fine victory over defending champion Zoltan Almasi of Hungary in the eighth round. 

The Indian GMs second victory over Almasi within a week in this double round-robin meet meant that Harikrishna stretched his lead to a full point over nearest rival, GM Zahar Efimenko of Ukraine who drew with GM Ferenc Berkes of Hungary. 

Two draws in the remaining rounds should be enough for Harikrishna to clinch the crown. 

With the other game between Chinese Wang Yue and Hungarian Peter Acs also petering out into a draw, Harikrishnas game was the only high point of Round 8 of the Category 15 event. 

Harikrishna has now 5.5 points and is followed by Efimenko (4.5), while Almasi and Wang Yue are now joint third (4 each). Berkes is fifth (3.5), while Acs brings up the rear with 2.5. 

It was a topical variation that Almasi went for with some new idea in mind but his plan was countered by the wily Harikrishna. 

However, as the game progressed, Harikrishna kept whites attacking bid at bay. Slowly but steadily, he improved his position on the king side to force some favourable exchanges. 

In the endgame Almasi went for an erroneous plan and ended up a piece down after which it was childs play for Harirkishna who wrapped the issue in 37 moves. Harikrishna has now won three and drawn five.

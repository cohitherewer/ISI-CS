The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Milan: Inter Milan fans protested against their team?s disappointing season on Friday by boycotting the derby fixture with AC Milan.

 The section of the San Siro stadium designated for Inter fans was sparsely populated and there were none of the colourful flags of the ultra groups. The fans had however placed some black and white banners with messages sprayed on for the players ? the most prominent declaring: ?We aren?t here ? because you never have been?.

 London: Arsenal?s teenage midfielder Cesc Fabregas is doubtful for Wednesday?s Champions League semi-final first leg against Villarreal, manager Arsene Wenger said on Friday.

 Fabregas first injured his foot in the 5-0 league win over Aston Villa two weeks ago. Wenger said the Spaniard is unlikely to be fit in time after missing the midweek draw at Portsmouth.

 Berlin: Bayern Munich fans are being urged not to boo Michael Ballack after the midfielder announced he was eager to move to Chelsea next season.

 ?A player like Michael Ballack, who has done so much for Bayern Munich, deserves a dignified send-off,? Bayern coach Felix Magath said on Friday. Bayern are four points clear of Hamburg SV at the top of the Bundesliga table.

 Raleigh: A 100m showdown between world record holder Asafa Powell and Olympic and world champion Justin Gatlin is being negotiated for Athens in early July, the sprinters? agents said on Thursday.

 ?Athens on the third (of July) probably sounds 

 like the place,? Gatlin manager Renaldo Nehemiah said when 

 asked where the two rivals might meet for the first time 

 this year.

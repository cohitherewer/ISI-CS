 Wright game for rugby job

Christchurch: After stirring a hornets nest in Indian cricket through his just-released book, former coach John Wright says he is open to new challenges in any competitive sport even though he is a favourite to replace John Bracewell as New Zealand coach after the World Cup. 

Id love at some stage to have a role in competitive sport in New Zealand, whether it be cricket or something else, and I dont rule anything out, Wright said. 

I couldnt coach (other sports) but there are certain issues in high performance sports that cross over. 

You just have to get your culture right and get your values right. Ive learned a lot watching the Hurricanes (one of their rugby teams) and Ive studied the Crusaders with Robbie (Deans) and learned heaps off Wayne Smith.

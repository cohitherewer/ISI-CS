The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 1990s: Once in a Bleus moon

 Italy 1990

 The 1990 finals in Italy were 

 a curious mixture of good and bad games, the final fitting 

 into the second category. There were also several wonderful 

 surprises and days of woeful refereeing.

 Penalty shootouts began to decide 

 more matches and, although the fans in soccer-mad Italy 

 were passionate about it all, the event left behind bitter-sweet 

 memories. Italys failure to reach the final and the 

 disappointing quality of that showpiece occasion were two 

 of the main reasons.

 The 1990 World Cup was the pinnacle 

 of Roger Millas career. At 38, he had taken his leave 

 of the big time to play for JS Saint-Pierroise, a team of 

 modest abilities on Reunion Island. But he came out of retirement 

 to leave a memorable mark on the Italian World Cup propelling 

 Cameroon into the quarter finals. 

 In winning their third title, 

 Germany joined Italy and Brazil as the tournaments 

 most honoured nations. 

 Did You Know?

 Even 

 though fewer nations took part in the qualifying rounds 

 than in 1986 (112 rather than 121), reaching the finals 

 proved to be just as difficult. Among the teams that failed 

 along the way were Denmark, Portugal and even France, the 

 1986 semi-finalists having named Michel Platini as coach 

 to replace Henri Michel. 

 A 

 virtually unknown quantity at the tournaments outset, 

 Schillaci, better known as Toto in his homeland, 

 carried an Italian XI which, though they played entertaining 

 football, were lacking in finishing power. Schillaci, 25, 

 who played his club football for Juventus, was in such tremendous 

 form ? he scored six goals and finished as the tournaments 

 top goal-scorer ? that he virtually lifted Italy into the 

 semi-finals on his own. There, however, the Squadra Azzurra 

 went out on penalties against Argentina, having only let 

 in two goals in seven games. 

 Diego 

 Maradona again took Argentina to the final, but Andreas 

 Brehme converted a penalty kick to decide the match in West 

 Germanys favour. 

 Off-side

 Like Julius Caesar before him, Salvatore Toto 

 Schillaci came, saw and conquered. For three weeks he 

 was Italys hero. Originally from Palermo but on 

 the books of Juventus, he had played only one international 

 match before the World Cup started. In the first Italian 

 game he came on as a substitute and scored the the winner 

 against Austria four minutes later. He was back on the 

 bench again for the USA match, but was then used in every 

 game and scored in every one too. 

 After Mexico in 1986, the 14th World Cup returned to 

 Europe: to Italy, a mighty footballing nation where no 

 expense was to be spared in making the World Cup a roaring 

 success. Ten of the twelve World Cup stadiums were given 

 a complete face-lift and the other two (in Turin and Bari), 

 were built from scratch especially for the event. 

 Italy also became the first European country to stage 

 the World Cup twice after hosting and winning the 1934 

 finals. 

 Argentina became the first team not to score in the 

 final ? and also the first team to have not one, but two 

 players sent off in the final.

 USA 1994

 Fifas decision to stage 

 the finals in the United States was a brave one, even though 

 it ultimately failed to realise the goal of establishing 

 soccer as a major sport there. It did, though, produce a 

 fine World Cup, marred only by a 0-0 draw in the final between 

 Brazil and Italy. In a sense it was a World Cup held in 

 a bubble. 

 Around the stadiums, or in the 

 cities where matches were played, there was a level of local 

 interest and the competition did produce the biggest total 

 attendance figures in World Cup history.

 But millions of Americans had 

 no idea the World Cup was happening in their country and, 

 if they did, they were not in the least bit interested.

 Still, those who did turn up seemed 

 to enjoy themselves, even if they tended to think that a 

 long goal-kick or a powerful throw-in deserved applause 

 every time. This was football in America but not football 

 as they knew it.

 Did You Know?

 There 

 was drama when Diego Maradona, Argentinas hero of 

 1986, tested positive for drugs and was expelled from the 

 tournament, and there was tragedy too when Colombian Andres 

 Escobar was murdered days after returning home from scoring 

 an own goal against the United States. 

 147 

 countries ? a new record ? entered for the qualifiers. Among 

 them was South Africa, back after a lengthy exclusion. Many 

 big guns, however, were not to make it to the finals: England, 

 Denmark, the 1992 European champions, Portugal, Poland, 

 and once again France, knocked out by a Bulgarian goal in 

 the last second of their last qualifying game. Also excluded 

 was Yugoslavia, where civil war raged with Bosnia. 24 counties 

 competed in the finals of the 15th World Cup. 

 The 

 final pitted Brazil against Italy, two nations which had 

 already won the World Cup three times. But what in theory 

 was the ideal match, proved to be a dour, physical and ultimately 

 disappointing game. And for the first time in World Cup 

 history, it all came down to penalties. As he stepped up, 

 Italys saviour Roberto Baggio knew he had to score. 

 But his penalty flew high into the blue California sky and 

 the Brazilians were champions again, 24 years after their 

 last success. Brazil had also become the first nation to 

 win the World Cup four times. 

 Off-side

 In Morocco, Americas biggest rival to host the 

 tournament, the disappointment was enormous. An African 

 nation had still never organised a finals tournament since 

 the World Cup was founded in 1930, but with just two stadia 

 they lacked the facilities to stage such a major event. 

 Cameroons consolation goal in their 1-6 defeat 

 by Russia was scored by ? who else? ? Roger Milla, thus 

 earning him another mention in the record book as the 

 oldest goal-scorer in a World Cup final round. 

 In the same match, Russias Oleg Salenko ? who 

 was not even in the starting line-up for his teams 

 early games in 1994 ? scored 5 times in less than 60 minutes. 

 After that, he faded from the international scene and 

 finally had to end his career early for health reasons.

 France 1998

 When Joao Havelange was bidding 

 to become Fifa president in 1974, he promised that if he 

 was elected Asian and African countries would get more opportunities 

 to compete on the world stage.

 The process began in 1982 when 

 the World Cup was increased to 24 nations and was completed 

 in 1998 when the first 32-team tournament was staged.

 Japan, South Africa and Jamaica 

 were among the debutants at France 98 which began with champions 

 Brazil beating Scotland 2-1 in Paris on June 10.

 Brazil were again expected to 

 do well but France were expected to do even better. 

 The hosts had improved steadily 

 over the previous decade and were reaping the benefits of 

 a far-sighted national youth training programme.

 By the time of the 1998 World 

 Cup, the likes of Zinedine Zidane, David Trezeguet, Patrick 

 Vieira and Thierry Henry were young, established and ready 

 to take on the world and win, which is exactly what they 

 did.

 Did You Know?

 As 

 is often the case with the World Cup, the opening round 

 threw up its fair share of surprises, with certain favourites 

 having to make way for a few unfancied lesser lights in 

 the second round. Spain failed to break their World Cup 

 hoodoo after a slow start and despite a grandstand finish. 

 Facing a race against the odds after a 2-3 loss to Nigeria 

 in their opener, Javier Clementes side racked up six 

 goals against the hapless Bulgarians only for Paraguay to 

 beat the group-leading Super Eagles and qualify at Spains 

 expense. 

 Colombia 

 also failed to progress, in a group topped by a Romanian 

 side which surprised England 2-1. Morocco also finished 

 the tournament with a tinge of regret, after a last-minute 

 penalty enabled Norway to beat a full-strength Brazil and 

 steal second place in the group from the North Africans. 

 It 

 was a dream final for France, on 12 July, the day 

 of glory arrived, to borrow a line from Frances 

 national anthem La Marseillaise. With a header in the 27th 

 minute followed by a second in first half injury time, playmaker 

 Zinedine Zidane sent shock waves through his Brazilian opponents 

 from which they would never recover. Despite being reduced 

 to ten men after Marcel Desaillys expulsion in the 

 68th minute, the French fortress not only withstood a final 

 pounding from Brazil but even slotted in another goal after 

 a counter-attack from Emmanuel Petit in the last minute.

 Off-side

 Moroccan referee Belqola became the first African ever 

 to officiate at a World Cup final. 

 The meet also helped the world discover fresh young 

 talents such as Ariel Ortega (Argentina), Thierry Henry 

 (France) and Michael Owen (England). Owen earned the distinction 

 of scoring one of the most breathtaking goals of the whole 

 World Cup, where 171 hit the target in a total of 64 matches.

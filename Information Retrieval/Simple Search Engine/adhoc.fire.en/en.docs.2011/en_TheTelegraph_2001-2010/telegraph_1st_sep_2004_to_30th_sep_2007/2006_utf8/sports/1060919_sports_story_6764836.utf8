The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahesh hadnt factored Beijing final

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: A clutch of VIPs were at the Netaji Indoor Stadium to see chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cutting a ribbon to formally open the Sunfeast Open just past 7.30 pm on Monday. But one person was conspicuous by his absence. 

Mahesh Bhupathi, the man who brought the WTA event to the city last year and presented Martina Hingis this time round, couldnt be there simple because he was in Beijing till Sunday playing a doubles final (with Mario Ancic) he didnt expect to. 

I didnt expect to reach the final when I went to Beijing, I had thought Id be able to reach Calcutta by Monday, Bhupathi said from Singapore en route to Mumbai. His partnership with Ancic which will continue in Mumbai happened by chance, as Justin Gimelstob pulled out at the last minute. 

Asked whether he was missing Calcutta with the tournament starting and Australian Open-winning partner Hingis in town for three days, Bhupathi said: Ive been talking to her every day she is being looked after well.

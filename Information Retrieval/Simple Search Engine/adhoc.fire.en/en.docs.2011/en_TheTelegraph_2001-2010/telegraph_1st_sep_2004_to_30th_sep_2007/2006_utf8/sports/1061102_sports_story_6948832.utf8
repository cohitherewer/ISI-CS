Chandigarh: The first semi-final of the Champions Trophy may not have drawn much public interest, but the PCA Stadium in Mohali was not short on glitz and glamour. If the presence of Rishi Kapoor and Nasiruddin Shah and a host of other Bollywood celebrities were not enough, there was Mohammed Azharuddin to add to the star value. 

But one man who rose head and shoulders above the others to grab the limelight was Glenn McGrath. If it was about big match temperament, the fast bowler showed that he has not lost his focus and accuracy after the break from international cricket. This performance should serve as a strong warning to the Englishmen before the Ashes. 

Despite useful innings from Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds, there was no doubt that Man-of-the-Match McGrath showed them the way in their maiden entry into the final of this competition. The 34-run win was achieved with four overs to spare. 

McGrath broke the backbone of the New Zealand batting with an inspired spell (10-2-22-3) that reduced them to 35 for six in the first 15 overs. He started off by removing Lou Vincent with a well directed away swinger, then accounted for Hamish Marshall, and finally, Peter Fulton paid the price for his wrong judgement. 

Ponting decided to finish off McGraths quota in one spell, though, there may have been moments when he missed him during the Jacob Oram-Daniel Vettori partnership. The 103 added in 126 balls did give Ponting some agonising moments even as the bowlers found it tough to grip the soft ball. 

It could, however, in no way lessen the fighting qualities shown by the pair, especially Vettori. Even the fall of Oram failed to diminish his resolve. His 79 off 103 balls was another reminder of his growing stature as an allrounder. 

The wicket may not have been as lively as experienced during the Pakistan-South Africa game, but it certainly wasnt short on bounce and carry. There was appreciable seam movement at the outset as Kyle Mills and Shane Bond went about their task with clinical precision. 

As Mills removed both the openers in the space of four balls, it seemed survival would be tough in such circumstances. The ball flew around as Ponting and Damien Martyn struggled to cope with the pace. While one delivery from Bond went over the wicketkeeper, another almost knocked out Martyns off stump. 

It took a while for the pair to get used to the conditions. The Aussies made up for the early jitters (four for two) with partnerships of 66, 54 and 65 for the next three wickets. 

However, it was not Martyn their most successful batsman in this tournament who took the fight to the opposition but the Australian captain showed the way. Cautious aggression was the hallmark of his batting as the Black Caps lost way. 

The thing about the Aussies that makes them a champion side is their ability to not surrender any cause as lost. When it seemed, they would fail to reach 200, Ponting and his men upset all calculations. Even the fall of wickets failed to hamper the momentum. 

Stephen Fleming rotated his bowlers in short bursts, but that was not enough. Daniel Vettori could have proved to be his trump card when the left-arm spinner tried to put the brakes in the middle overs. 

Mills again provided the vital breakthrough when Ponting (58 off 80 balls, 9x4) miscued a pull to mid on. New Zealand sensed a lifeline but Andrew Symonds was in no mood to succumb to the pressure. He treated the bowlers with disdain and was intent on not missing an opportunity. 

He ran the singles hard along with Mike Hussey as Flemings men struggled hard to arrest the slide. Symonds hard hitting was mainly responsible for Vettori conceding 28 in his last four overs. His run-a-ball 58 portrayed his maturity. 

New Zealand tried to wrest some of the advantage with a few quick strikes in the latter stages, but by then it was a bit too late.

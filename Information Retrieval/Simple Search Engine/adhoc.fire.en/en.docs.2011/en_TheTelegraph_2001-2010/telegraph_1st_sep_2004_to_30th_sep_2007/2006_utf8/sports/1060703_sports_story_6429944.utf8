 Deadline for Klinsmann

Berlin: Theo Zwanziger, president of the German football federation (DFB), said on Sunday that coach Jurgen Klinsmann must take a decision on his future by August 16. 

German chiefs pleaded with Klinsmann to sign a contract extension prior to the finals, but the 41-year-old said he wanted to discuss the situation with his family. 

The only time frame is our first international against Sweden on August 16, Zwanziger told a magazine. After the end of the World Cup on July 9, Klinsmann would have five weeks to decide whether he extends his contract. 

The DFB wants Klinsmann to sign a two-year extension to guide the team towards Euro 2008. (AFP)

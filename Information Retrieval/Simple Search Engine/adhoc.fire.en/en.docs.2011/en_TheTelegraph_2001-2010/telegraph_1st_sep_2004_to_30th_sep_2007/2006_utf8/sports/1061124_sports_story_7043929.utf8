 Iran banned, Indias group may change

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: With Fifa deciding to suspend Iran Football Federation (IRIFF) from all international activities due to government interference in football matters, there is a distinct possibility that India might find them with new partners in the forthcoming Doha Asian Games. 

Iran, champions in the last two Asian Games, were grouped with India, Hong Kong and the Maldives in the Doha meet. While the Asian Games committee is yet to announce their new course of action under the present circumstances, the AIFF secretary, Alberto Colaco felt there could be fresh groupings for the meet. 

Without Iran, the group might look too lopsided, Colaco said. 

Meanwhile, the Indian squad in Dubai will play a practice match on Saturday against a local club side. Captain Bhaichung Bhutia, who is slightly injured, will not take the field. Though it is not at all a serious injury, we have decided to give him rest, the team doctor said from Dubai.

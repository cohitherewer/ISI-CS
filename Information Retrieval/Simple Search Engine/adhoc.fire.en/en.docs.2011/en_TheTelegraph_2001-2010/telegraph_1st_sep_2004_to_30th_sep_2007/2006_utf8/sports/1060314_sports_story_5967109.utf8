Auckland: New Zealand beat West Indies by 27 runs in the first Test at Aucklands Eden Park on Monday. 

The Black Caps wrapped up victory before lunch on the fifth and final day by bowling West Indies out for 263 after setting the visitors 291 for victory. 

West Indies resumed on 246 for eight, needing a further 45 runs to claim their first Test win in nine months, but lost Ian Bradshaw for 10 and Jerome Taylor for 13. 

Bradshaw was caught in close by skipper captain Stephen Fleming off spinner Daniel Vettori while Taylor was bowled by Man-of-the-Match Shane Bond, who finished with five for 69 after turning the match New Zealands way with a devastating spell on Sunday. 

It was one of the most emotional Tests because it ebbed and flowed, Fleming told a news conference. Up to yesterday afternoon, we were not down and out but well behind and to win it was very satisfying.

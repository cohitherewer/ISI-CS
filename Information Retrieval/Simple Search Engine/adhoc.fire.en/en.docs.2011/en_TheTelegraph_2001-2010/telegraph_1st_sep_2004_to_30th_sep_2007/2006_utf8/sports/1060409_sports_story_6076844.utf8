 Woolmer: We must beat India to restore confidence 

Karachi: Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer on Saturday said his team needed to find a method to beat India when the traditional rivals meet in the two-match one-day International series in Abu Dhabi later this month. 

Pakistan have played terrifically well in the last 12 months but we definitely need to find a method to beat India in the one-day game to restore our confidence, Woolmer said shortly after returning from Colombo after a successful Sri Lanka tour. 

Woolmer said Pakistan would go into the series with full preparation to avenge their 1-4 defeat to India at home earlier this year. (PTI)

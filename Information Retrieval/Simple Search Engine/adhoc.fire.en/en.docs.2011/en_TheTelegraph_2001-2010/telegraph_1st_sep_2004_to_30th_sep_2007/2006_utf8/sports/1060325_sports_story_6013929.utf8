The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Anand shocked by Grischuk

 Amber Chess

 Anand

 Monaco: Viswanathan Anand 

 suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Russian Alexander 

 Grischuk in the fifth round of 15th Amber Blindfold and 

 Rapid Chess Championship here. 

 The 0.5-1.5 loss proved quite 

 costly for the defending champion on Thursday as the Indian 

 not only lost the joint lead in the combined standings but 

 also slid down in blindfold.

 While Anand was below par against 

 Grischuk whom he had beaten comprehensively in Mainz, Russian 

 Alexander Morozevich took rapid strides ? especially in 

 the blindfold section ? and downed compatriot Peter Svidler. 

 In the return rapid game, Svidler came up with a fine performance 

 to level scores.

 Morozevich is leading the event 

 jointly with Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko, both having 

 earned 6 points.

 Anand (5.5) is joint third with 

 Spanish Francisco Vallejo Pons. The Indian GM is followed 

 by a pack of four, including Grischuk and world champion 

 Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria.

 Morozevich emerged as the sole 

 leader in the blindfold section in which he has thus garnered 

 4 points. Morozevichs nearest contender in this section 

 is Leko (3.5) while Topalov has 3.

 After the disaster against Grischuk, 

 Anand has now been pushed to joint eighth spot with 2 points.

 Anand, playing black, went for 

 the Berlin Defence against Grischuk. Perhaps the Indian 

 wanted to surprise Grischuk who only took it as a pleasant 

 surprise as the events unfolded.

 While both players blitzed out 

 the opening moves quickly on a blank chess board displaying 

 only the last move played, Grischuk gained the upper hand 

 when Anand went for an erroneous plan. The Russian was on 

 top despite Anand exchanging pieces at regular intervals 

 and turned the tide decisively in his favour after winning 

 an exchange. Anand resigned on his 40th turn.

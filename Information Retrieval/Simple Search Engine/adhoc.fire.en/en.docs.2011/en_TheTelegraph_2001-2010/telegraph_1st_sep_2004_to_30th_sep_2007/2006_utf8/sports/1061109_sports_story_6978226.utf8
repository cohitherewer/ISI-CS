 Asif victim of naivety, says Pak physio

Lahore: Pakistan crickets physiotherapist Darryn Lifson said Wednesday that naivety led to banned pacer Mohammed Asif taking dietary supplements without realising their possible consequences. 

I would say Asif was a victim of innocence. When he injured his elbow he took an injection for that, otherwise he was taking a powder which I was not aware of. When I came to know about it I stopped him, Lifson said. 

Asif told a doping tribunal last month that while in England with the Pakistan team in June 2006 he was given an injection for his elbow injury which did not work. He received two more injections during his stay. After his return he had been using a nutritional supplement called promax-50, he told the tribunal. 

Lifson described Asif as serious and honest player. Asif takes training very seriously and is a fantastic guy to work with, honest, hard-working and a very good man. 

Lifson, said news of Asifs testing positive was a shock. (AFP)

 India falter at Aussie hurdle

 - Shikha wins, Sania goes down

New Delhi: India faltered at the last hurdle as they went down to top seeds Australia 2-1 in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Zonal final in Seoul on Saturday. 

 Shikha Uberoi put India ahead with a 6-3, 6-2 win in the first singles over 21-year old and World No. 179 Casey DellAcqua who was playing in her maiden Fed Cup tie, according to information received here. 

 But the Aussies pulled level as Sania Mirza went down 6-4, 6-2 to Samantha Stosur in the second singles. 

 Twenty-two-year old Stosur, ranked No. 1 in doubles, then combined with Rennae Stubbs, world No. 6, to beat Sania and Shikha 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 in the deciding doubles rubber. 

Australia go through to the World Group II play-off in July this year, while India remain in Group I of the Asia-Oceania Zone. 

Indian captain Enrico Piperno said Sania was not at her best. 

Sania did not fire. It was one of those days. She did give her best but it was not enough, Piperno said. 

He said the 19-year-old let her concentration drop at a crucial situation in the first set against Stosur. 

The match went on well, it was 4-4 in the first set. Sania was 40-0 up serving when she lost concentration, Piperno said. (PTI)

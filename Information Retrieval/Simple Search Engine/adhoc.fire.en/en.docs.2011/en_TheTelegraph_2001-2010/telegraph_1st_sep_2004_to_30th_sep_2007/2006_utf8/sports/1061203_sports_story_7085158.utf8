 Handsome win for Aristotle 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Belying his upcountry form, the Vijay Singh-trainee, Aristotle, posted a handsome victory in the 1,600m Bangalore Turf Club Cup on Saturday.

 Taken to the front, right after the start, the 3-10 hot favourite drew away from the field in the home stretch, forcing jockey C.Alford to apply brakes 300m from home.

 D. Davids Right Again, on the other hand, had to be fully ridden out by the Bangalore-based jockey Colm Donoghue to beat Andrology in the Galstaun Cup. It wasnt the day for the visiting jockeys. While apprentice L. Prashant had a fall and broke his leg after guiding a friendless Salinger, jockey Vijay Kumar was handed a four-day ban for going easy on Tip Toes.

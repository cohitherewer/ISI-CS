The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Give him another opportunity

 - Sehwag has Wessels-Sohails sympathy

Durban: Despite another Virender Sehwag failure (and the appalling manner of his dismissal), two former captains and openers, Kepler Wessels and Aamer Sohail, would like him to be given another chance. 

Of course, lets see how the second Test goes, but the last will be at Newlands where the wicket is going to be slow... I would, for now, persist with him till the end of the series, Wessels told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, he added: I agree he didnt get out to a great shot, but weve got to wait and see how it impacts on the outcome here... 

Talking exclusively, Sohail said: When strokemakers get out of form, they do take long to regain touch... Sehwag needs to have an open stance, so that he can play in the V... Somebody must speak to him and he has to learn... 

He continued: Even Ill be inclined to give him another Test, in the hope that he comes good... Besides changing his stance, Sehwag should steel himself into wanting to spend time at the wicket. 

Sound advice, but is Sehwag going to listen?

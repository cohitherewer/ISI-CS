 Anand stuns Leko, back in joint lead

 - Monaco meet 

 Anand 

Monaco: Defending champion Viswanathan Anand came back strongly to score a splendid victory over Hungarian Grandmaster Peter Leko in the sixth round of 15th Amber Blindfold and Rapid Chess Tournament here. 

Anand, who lost to Grandmaster Alexander Grischuk in the previous round, thus, regained joint lead in the combined standings of the unique event. 

Grandmaster Alexander Morozevich of Russia shares the lead with Anand at the half way stage with 6.5 points. In this round, Morozevich drew with Grandmaster Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark to continue his supremacy in the euros 216,000 event. 

Anand showcased his class first in the middle game by maintaining a vice-like grip on the position with his better knight against the bishop and slowly improved his position to knock down one of black pawns. 

Leko went for a pure minor piece endgame soon after but there was little respite for him as Anand clinched the issue after 67 moves.

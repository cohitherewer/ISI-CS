Inspired by Cesc Fabregas, Arsenals youngsters were in such bewitching form at Highbury Tuesday night that the Old Lady of Turin was left showing her age and her crotchety temper. Juventus finished two players down, Arsenal two goals up and Fabregas and company will travel to the Stadio delle Alpi next week convinced they can progress to a semi-final against either Inter Milan or Villarreal. 

Such is the youthful verve of Arsene Wengers squad that the trip to Piedmont will resemble a school outing. The youngest of the eight sides left in the Champions League, Arsenal mix energy and a maturity beyond their callow years. The teenage Fabregas, racing out of the long shadow left by Patrick Vieira, utterly eclipsed a returning icon, scoring once and setting up Thierry Henrys goal. 

If Fabregas name danced merrily on the lips of every Arsenal fan as they strolled into the ground, then mention of Kolo Toure surely featured in ensuing utterances. Organised superbly by Toure, Arsenals defence equalled AC Milans Champions League record of seven successive clean sheets. 

Juventus coach Fabio Capello must have secretly admired the mobility and steel of Toure and his defensive cohorts, particularly as his own back five cost ?100 million ? 20 times more than Wengers rearguard. Toure was magnificent, even inflicting two stealthy tackles on Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who wore the bemused look of someone belatedly realising he had been pickpocketed. 

The ball lost, the first leg lost, Juventus then lost their discipline as Mauro Camoranesi and Jonathan Zebina were dismissed for double-yellow offences. The Old Lady left London without her dignity. Juventus can still turn the tie around, and an early goal beneath the Alps would make it a tense old night for Arsenal, but they also look highly capable of scoring, simply because they move through the gears so quickly on the counter-attack. Both goals stemmed from quickfire breaks. 

This compelling first leg was played at an intensity and speed that Juventus failed to match. At times it resembled an FA Cup tie, although the only Englishman to touch the ball was Brian Barwick, the Football Associations watching chief executive, who caught a wayward clearance from Zebina. 

Foreign hearts in the Arsenal ranks were filled with an English passion as they tore into Juventus, the sixth-placed side in the Premiership giving a wonderful advertisement for the English league. The suggestion that Arsenal would struggle against more physical European opponents, and would melt when Vieira and Emerson crunched into challenges, was soon mocked at. 

For all Highburys reverence of Vieira, the Juventus midfielder was soon booed for a series of fouls on his former teammates, and was eventually booked. Who are you? the North Bank inquired as Vieira and his visitors were embarrassed by the quality of Arsenals football. Arsenal constantly sought to caress the ball around Highbury, weaving their passing patterns with unremitting persistence, taking their goals with panache. 

The identities of those involved in their first-half goal particularly delighted the Arsenal faithful. Pires, playing for an extended contract, was in terrific form, even leaping high to prevent a cross reaching Vieira, and it was the Arsenal No. 7 who sent his team on their way to seventh heaven with a thrilling dispossession of Vieira. 

Pires glided down the inside-left channel before flicking the ball with the outside of his right boot to Henry. Fabio Cannavaro tried to douse the raging fire, but no chance. Henrys forward pass was sublime, placed perfectly into the path of Fabregas, who cut across Lilian Thuram before shooting low past a wrong-footed Gianluigi Buffon. Only the one corner of Highbury that was Little Italy for the night would have disputed the burning reality that the goal was deserved. 

Fabregas, enjoying the licence to break forward permitted by a five-man midfield, had already had one sighting shot after 16 minutes that skimmed wide. Toure also burst through to test Buffon. Henry, seeking to punish panicky Juventus fouls, then threatened with two free kicks. After Fabregas strike, as 1-0 to the Arsenal raced from Clock End to North Bank, Henry danced through Juventus defence but laced his shot wide. 

For all their commitment to attack, Arsenal still needed to be wary. Juventus armoury boasts all manner of weapons, although they were clearly missing the invention of the injured Alessandro del Piero and the left-sided dynamism of the suspended Pavel Nedved. 

Ibrahimovic, normally such a dexterous attacker, has been out of sorts for weeks but still the excellent Toure needed to be at his most alert either side of the interval to spirit the ball away from the Swede. Then when Adrian Mutu, formerly of Chelsea, made ground down the left, Toure again swept in to execute another tackle that brought Mutu to his knees in submission, and Arsenal fans to their feet. 

Still Arsenal looked to break forward, and just after the hour they almost doubled their lead but Buffon saved athletically from Henry. The Italian international then pushed away a Fabregas effort, but had no chance when Arsenal next came calling. Again Fabregas was involved, taking a pass from Alexander Hleb and finding Henry, who sent the ball into the net and Arsenal into Shangri-La.

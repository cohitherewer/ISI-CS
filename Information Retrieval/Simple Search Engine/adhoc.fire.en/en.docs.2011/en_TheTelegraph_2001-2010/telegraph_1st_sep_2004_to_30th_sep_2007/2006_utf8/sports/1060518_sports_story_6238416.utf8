The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Summer season from Saturday 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: The Bangalore summer season is scheduled to start from Saturday. The first weeks races were cancelled owing to the trainers surrendering their licenses following a new clause in the licensing conditions, which held them responsible for all the liabilities of their employees. 

 To tide over the crisis, the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) has issued temporary licenses to trainers for three months following prolonged negotiations on Tuesday. A panel has been set up to look into the problems relating to provident fund for syces and its recommendation is expected to come within the next three months. 

 The tussle was temporarily resolved with the intervention of horse owner MAM Ramaswamy. A bumper season is on the cards, with over 175 outstation horses having arrived to participate during the 26-day season, which promises exciting action. 

 The opening weekend may itself see well-filled card as regular rains during the past few days have done a world of good to the track. The stakes this season have been substantially increased. 

 The added money for all the Classic, grades and sweepstakes races has also been increased. The total stake money is at a staggering Rs 10 crore.

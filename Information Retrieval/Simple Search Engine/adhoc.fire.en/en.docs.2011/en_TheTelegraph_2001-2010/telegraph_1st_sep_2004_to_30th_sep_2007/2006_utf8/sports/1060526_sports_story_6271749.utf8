 Wayne Rooney undergoes MRI

Manchester: Wayne Rooney returned to the hospital for an MRI on his broken foot on Thursday, hoping to hear that he would be able to play the World Cup. 

Rooney broke a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a match against Chelsea on April 29, putting him in doubt for the entire June 9-July 9 championship in Germany. 

Since then, there have been reports of his recovering well. 

Manchester United has played down such optimism, however, with manager Alex Ferguson worried that Rooney might aggravate the injury if rushed back too early. England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has said he is confident Rooney will be fit in time for the quarter finals on June 30. 

Rooney, who has kept fit on an exercise bike and appears to be walking normally, went to the Bupa Manchester Hospital at Whalley Range for his MRI scan. The results of the scan wont be made public until Friday. 

Even if he is healed, Rooneys foot will need more time to be strong enough to withstand a strong tackle. The 20-year-old Rooney, who has had a standout season for United and England, also needs to get back to full match fitness. 

With the likes of Rooney, David Beckham, Michael Owen, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, John Terry and Jamie Carragher in the team, there are high hopes that England have their best chance of winning the World Cup since their only triumph in the competition 40 years ago.

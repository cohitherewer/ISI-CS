Dhanbad: With a victory each under their belt, both Jharkhand and visitors Bengal will be looking for a win in their second match of the East Zone Ranji Trophy one-day match at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Monday. 

Spirited by a bonus point thanks to an emphatic win over Tripura on Saturday, the Bengal team did not even turn up for practise on Sunday morning. Moreover, the arrival of former Team India captain Sourav Ganguly will also boost their morale. 

However, three of the Bengal players ? captain Deep Dasgupta, Laxmi Ratan Shukla and S. S. Singh, along with the physiotherapist, turned up for a warm-up session at the local indoor stadiums gym, trying out their hand at badminton during their two hour stay. 

Bengal manager S. Dasgupta, meanwhile, predicted an interesting match with the host state. Our morale is high after yesterdays win over Tripura, and the presence of Sourav will be an additional morale booster for the team, he said. 

The Jharkhand team, which practised on Sunday morning, were a bit cautious, keeping in mind the participation of Sourav.

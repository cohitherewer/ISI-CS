 Kaneria sees role for himself in World Cup

 - Caribbean wickets are to my liking 

 Kanerias optimism is not shared by Pakistan selectors 

Karachi: Danish Kaneria has been left to cool his heels while Pakistan have started their ODI campaign against India on a winning note, but the leg-spinner has no doubt he would be in frame when the 2007 World Cup beckons in the Caribbean. 

For one, I feel there is a role for specialists even in one-day arena and two, the wickets in the Caribbean are to my liking, Kaneria said on Wednesday. 

Kanerias optimism presently is not shared by the Pakistan selectors who have left him out of the mix for the first three one-day Internationals. That he has been provided only 15 one-day games in the last four years also probably conveys the fact that the selectors are yet to make up their mind on him. 

Kaneria, however, has little doubt that he would force a rethink in the one-day field as he has done in Test cricket in the last three years. 

I broke into the Test ranks in 2000-01 season but it was only in the last three years when I started to command a regular place. It wasnt possible to ignore me after I started taking wickets and performed in different conditions, he said. 

Sure I am an attacking bowler but there is place for specialists in one-day cricket. I may be conceding a few in my quest to attack, but then I also am able to pick up important wickets, he added. 

The wickets in the Caribbean suit slow bowling, may be it is because of the sand content in the pitches. I remember the Jamaica Test of the series in 2005 when the West Indies needed 280 runs in the final innings to claim the series 2-0. I picked up 5 for 46 and my scalps included the likes of (Brian) Lara, Shivnaraine Chanderpaul and Ramnaresh Sarwan, the leg-spinner recalled. 

Kaneria also feels he is on right ground to push his credentials as a one-day bowler after he helped his county side Essex to win the one-day championship last summer. 

I had some 17 wickets from nine matches and this was in England, mind you, not in dusty pitches of the sub-continent, he said.

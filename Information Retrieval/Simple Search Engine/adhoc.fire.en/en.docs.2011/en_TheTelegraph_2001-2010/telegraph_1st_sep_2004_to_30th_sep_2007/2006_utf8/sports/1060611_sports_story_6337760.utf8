 England manage full points

 - Own goal by Paraguay a boon for Erikssons boys

 Prince William meets England fans in Frankfurt on Saturday 

Frankfurt: David Beckham got Englands World Cup campaign off to a winning start by setting up the early goal that decided an unconvincing 1-0 Group B victory against Paraguay in Frankfurt. 

Sven-Goran Erikssons men then struggled to create clear opportunities ? and also took off striker Michael Owen early in the second half ? but held on to claim three points. 

Steven Gerrard was named in the starting XI by England coach Eriksson after the Liverpool skipper sufficiently recovered from a stiff back which has recently hampered him. 

Gerrard had barely settled into the game when England took the lead, with Beckham taking advantage of a free-kick on the left flank after Joe Cole was fouled by Delio Toledo. 

Beckham whipped in a delightful third-minute set-piece and the ball went in off the head of Paraguay captain Carlos Gamarra, with Erikssons men expected to go on and compile a big score. 

Paraguay goalkeeper Justo Villar damaged a calf muscle while sliding out to make a clearance after eight minutes and was replaced by Aldo Bobadilla. He is likely to miss the rest of the World Cup. Paraguay were already 0-1 down by then. 

Then Cristian Riveros forced Robinson into a regulation save from 25 yards, with Gerrard earning a yellow card for his challenge on the midfielder, while referee Marco Rodriguez also booked Nelson Valdez midway through the first half. 

In fact, it was striker Michael Owen ? who has recently returned from a broken foot ? who was taken off 10 minutes into the second half, although it was unclear if he was injured. 

England looked short on options in attack with just Peter Crouch leading the line, although Beckham shot wide and Cole had a tame effort from long distance which was saved by Villar. 

Paraguay had earlier threatened in the injury-time of the first half ? Valdez had flashed a volley wide ? and on the hour mark Paredes volleyed over after Robinson had failed to hold a cross. 

England will have to play better than they did in Saturdays 1-0 win over Paraguay if they are to win the World Cup, said coach Sven-Goran Eriksson. 

I know that to win the World Cup we have to play better football, but we will play better football, Eriksson told a news conference. 

Eriksson said the temperature had affected his team and was reminiscent of the steamy day at Shizuoka when they were dumped out of the 2002 World Cup by Brazil in the quarter finals. 

The heat was to blame for Englands lacklustre performance, agreed captain David Beckham. I think it was hot for both teams. We were good at times but we gave the ball away too much. 

Beckham said that there was no need to push the panic button as England bid to end their 40-year drought in the global showpiece. We will be alright. It was a 3 clock kick-off in the summer and that played a part. But we can perform better. 

Eriksson, who took striker Owen off after 55 minutes, explained the surprise move by saying: I wanted to see some fresh legs on the pitch.

Calcutta: It has finally dawned on the Bengal thinktank that they had made a huge mistake by choosing a greentop in their last match against Tamil Nadu. Bengal lost and also jeopardised their chances of grabbing a semi-final berth in the Ranji Trophy. 

It was the first time we had played on a seaming track this season and we faltered. So weve decided to get back to what were used to, said coach Paras Mhambrey on the eve of their crucial game against Railways. 

The typical Eden wicket on offer has very little grass and will help the seamers in the morning session. Once it settles down after lunch, the spinners can reap the benefits. The batsmen will also have their share but patience and application will be the need of the hour. 

Bengal will not only have to garner full points from this game, but also hope that neither Karnataka nor Tamil Nadu overtake them for a semis berth. Karnataka have 12 while Bengal and Tamil Nadu are tied on nine after six outings. Mumbai top Elite group A with 16. 

It all depends on how we play? The rest will fall into place, captain Deep Dasguptas philosophic observation summed up the circumstances. 

If Mhambreys fundamentals of improving are considered, Bengal have certainly made much headway this season vis-?-vis last years failures. Its important to play consistently? Our objective will be to do well in this game and look at the situation realistically, the coach remarked. 

We failed to capitalise the conditions in the last game. We lacked application. The need will be to work on the basics and stay positive. 

Bengal are likely to ring in three changes ? Manoj Tewari replacing Sourav Ganguly, Subhamoy Das for Subhajit Paul and Asok Dinda making way for Shib Sagar Singh. 

Defending champions Railways sordid plight has come as a huge surprise. The presence of Murali Kartik is sure to come as a bonus for the relegation threatened side. Railways are lurking at the bottom of the table with a mere four points. 

It will be a tough job, admitted captain Sanjay Bangar. Its been a collective failure? The batsmen have failed to be among runs and the bowlers have fared no better, he tried to reason. 

The batting failures have, no doubt, put them in a spot. Yere Gouds failures and Tejinder Pal Singhs absence have led to a void which has been hard to compensate. Bangar hinted he would continue opening with Amit Pagnis, but the middle-order might see a reshuffle. Whatever the result, the experience factor can never be ignored. 

As Deep put it, you can never take a team that has been together for years lightly.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Fielding captain, batsman can appeal

 - Much bigger role for third umpire; Trial at Champions Trophy 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: The ICC Cricket 

 Committee gave a guarded endorsement to a trial of the extended 

 use of technology during its two-day meeting in Dubai, which 

 ended on Saturday. 

 The Committee recommended that 

 players be allowed a limited number of appeals to the third 

 umpire if they feel a decision made by the onfield umpire 

 is incorrect during the ICC Champions Trophy in October-November, 

 according to a media release. 

 But the Committee also expressed 

 reservations about the implications such a process would 

 have on the spirit of cricket, the fabric of the game and 

 the authority of the onfield umpires. 

 The Committee recommended that 

 equipping of umpires with ear pieces connected to the stump 

 microphones be mandatory in all international matches. 

 Regarding playing conditions for 

 the ICC Champions Trophy, next years ICC World Cup 

 and for international Twenty20 matches, it sought to establish 

 new standardised criteria for the measurement of bad light, 

 and a sub-committee appointed last year reported back on 

 the Laws governing what constitutes a cricket bat. 

 All the recommendations made by 

 the Cricket Committee have to be approved by the chief executives 

 committee, and if that approval is forthcoming, then the 

 decisions can be ratified at the ICC board meeting. Both 

 meetings are set for London in July. 

 The Committee agreed to recommend 

 players be allowed three appeals per innings to the third 

 umpire if they feel a decision made by the onfield umpire 

 is incorrect. The recommendation was, however, made by the 

 narrowest possible margin (six votes to five). 

 Explaining how the new appeals 

 system might work, ICC general manager (cricket), David 

 Richardson said: Each team will be allowed three appeals 

 to the third umpire per innings. If the appeal is successful 

 they will retain the right to three appeals but if not, 

 then it is lost. 

 Only the captain from the 

 fielding side will be entitled to make the appeal by approaching 

 the onfield umpire making the sign of a TV with his hands. 

 For the batting side, only the batsman involved in the decision 

 would be able to make the appeal, which he would do in the 

 same way. 

 The trial would not include the 

 use of technology such as hawkeye or the snickometer, but 

 would include the lbw mat, the solid line super-imposed 

 on the screen between the two sets of stumps and used by 

 broadcasters to determine where the ball pitches and the 

 point of impact on the batsmans pads. 

 The Committee heard evidence that 

 artificial lights are of limited use in improving conditions 

 on dull days and that they are only truly effective when 

 a contrast exists between the ball and the sky, as is the 

 case at night with a white ball. On that basis it was decided 

 to recommend that the use of artificial lights during Test 

 matches be discontinued. 

 At the same time, the Committee 

 agreed umpires should be issued with a directive that play 

 should be maximised wherever possible. 

 The playing conditions for this 

 years ICC Champions Trophy and World Cup in the Caribbean 

 were discussed and recommended for approval. 

 Last years ICC Cricket Committee 

 appointed a sub-committee, made up of Sunil Gavaskar, Arjuna 

 Ranatunga, Angus Fraser, Tim May and David Richardson to 

 work with the MCC Laws Working Party to produce a series 

 of recommendations on the Law governing the bat. 

 The recommendations, which 

 will be submitted to the MCC, the custodians of the Laws 

 of Cricket, are: 

 The balance that exists between a wooden bat and a 

 leather ball should be retained. 

 The Law governing the bat should be the same at all 

 levels of the game. 

 The current dimensions should remain the same although 

 the area from the top of the handle to the end of the 

 splice should not make up more than 50 per cent of the 

 length of the bat. 

 The handle can be made of any material. 

 There is no need to define what a conventional shape 

 of bat is. 

 It should be made of a single piece of wood. 

 The issues of corking and bat covers should 

 be investigated further by the sub-committee. 

 Toe caps for bats should be covered in the Laws. 

 Bats should be the colour of wood except for permitted 

 logos.

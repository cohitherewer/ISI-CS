 IHF to rest senior players

New Delhi: A second-string hockey squad, mostly comprising youngsters, will represent India at the SAF Games to be held in Colombo from August 18 to 27. 

Both India and Pakistan ? the heavyweights in the games ? have decided to rest their senior players as they prepare for the World Cup to be played in Monchengladbach, Germany, from September 6. 

A host of 32 probables have been currently training in Patiala from July 5 under junior coach Clarence Lobo. Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) secretary K. Jothikumaran said the senior players could not be spared for the Colombo meet because of the packed schedule. 

Our engagement in the SAF Games will come to an end on August 25 and the team for the World Cup would leave on August 24. So it is not possible to spare the senior players at all, Jothikumaran said on Tuesday. 

Jothikumaran said the final squad for the SAF Games would be declared in a few days. The camp in Patiala is going on in full flow and will take a while to announce the squad, he said. (PTI)

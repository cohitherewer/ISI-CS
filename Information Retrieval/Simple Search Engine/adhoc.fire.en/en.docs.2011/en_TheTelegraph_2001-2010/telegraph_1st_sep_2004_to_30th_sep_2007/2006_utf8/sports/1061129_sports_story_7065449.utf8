Paris: Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro won the Golden Ball award Monday, the first defender in 10 years to be named Europes best player. 

The 33-year-old Neapolitan succeeds Barcelona star Ronaldinho, winner of last years award, but who placed fourth this time largely as a result of his World Cup performance as Brazil crashed in the quarter finals to France. 

Cannavaro who played for Juventus last season but then moved to Real Madrid after helping Italy win the World Cup took the honour on Monday with 171 points ahead of Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon (124) of Italy and Arsenals French striker Thierry Henry (121). 

Frances Zinedine Zidane, who retired after reaching the World Cup final, placed fifth with 71 points. 

I want to thank Real president Raman Calderon and my teammates from Juve and the national team who had an important part to play in my winning this award, said Cannavaro. It has a double importance because its given to the greatest players and as a defender its rare to have this honour. 

Cannavaro was only the third defender in 30 years to win Matthias Sammer won the award in 1996 and Franz Beckenbauer took it in 1976. 

He was also the fifth Italian to win, following Roberto Baggio (1993), Paolo Rossi (1982), Gianni Rivera (1969) and Argentina-born Omar Sivori (1961). 

I am the first to be surprised, Cannavaro said. This means everything to me. 

Capped 105 times for Italy, Cannavaro also has become the fifth Real Madrid player to win the award after Hispano-Argentine Alfredo Di Stefano (1957, 1959), Portugals Luis Figo (2000) and Brazilian Ronaldo (2002). 

The 51st Ballon DOr, organised by French football magazine France Football was decided after votes from European footballs leading journalists. (Agencies)

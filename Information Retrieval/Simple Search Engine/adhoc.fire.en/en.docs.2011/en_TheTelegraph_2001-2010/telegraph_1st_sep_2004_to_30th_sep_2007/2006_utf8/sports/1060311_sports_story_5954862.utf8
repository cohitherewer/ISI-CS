 Sachin, Sourav, Dravid among special invitees

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Chandigarh: Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar are among special invitees in the BCCIs newly-instituted committee for optimum utilisation of resources. 

The special committee will, among other things, examine the present system of selection of national and state teams (and umpires), and suggest measures to make them more efficient and foolproof, a release said. 

Nobody, however, will sit in judgement for the current panel, headed by Kiran More, who will hold office till the AGM in September. The recommendations will be applicable only for future selection committee members. 

The inclusion of Sourav, who has been the victim of whimsical selection methods in the past few months, is interesting. In effect, the formation of this special committee proves that the BCCI is not sure whether the current system of selection is perfect. 

An influential current BCCI member, however, did not agree. The aim is to make the national selectors more accountable and professional. If need be, the posts will no longer be honorary, he said. 

The special committee was formed as per the decision of the working committee on February 21. The special invitees list also includes former India captains Dilip Vengsarkar and Krishnamachari Srikkanth, along with Navjyot Singh Sidhu. 

The 11-member special committee, with Inderjit Singh Bindra as chairman and N. Srinivasan as convenor, has former captains Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev as members. The others are Shashank Manohar, Arun Jaitley, Ajay Shirke, K.M. Ramprasad, Prof. Ratnakar Shetty, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and joint secretary M.P. Pandove. 

The special committee has been asked to finalise its report within four weeks. 

They will also look into efficient ways of utilisation of resources being devolved upon the state associations by way of grants. The objective will be to develop world class infrastructure from the grassroots to international level and build institutes of excellence in each region. 

It will also recommend steps to make the distribution of funds to members more equitable and suggest measures to those who havent yet taken steps to create infrastructure.

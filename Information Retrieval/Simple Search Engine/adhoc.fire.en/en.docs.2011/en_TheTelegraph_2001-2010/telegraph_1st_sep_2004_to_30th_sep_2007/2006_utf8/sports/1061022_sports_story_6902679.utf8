 Atwal manages cut

Miami: After having a second round of three-under 69, Arjun Atwal managed to hang in there as he made the cut at the Funai Walt Disney Classic golf tournament. At five-under for two days, he is now tied 62nd, up from his first round finish of 70th place. More importantly, he has a chance to improve his position in the remaining two rounds. 

The Indian, currently 138th, is struggling to make the top 125 on the money list to ensure full playing privileges for 2007. (Pti)

 Silvestre: We want to be in Berlin on July 9

Hamelin: France defender Mikael Silvestre said on Wednesday that France were still aiming to go all the way to the final. Our objective has not changed and it remains to reach the final, he said. 

We want to be in Berlin on July 9, added the 28-year-old, who has been told he will win his 40th cap by coming in for the suspended Eric Abidal at left back against Togo in Cologne. Silvestre was on the bench for the first two games. 

France coach Raymond Domenech had set the final as his target before the tournament but a dull 0-0 stalemate with Switzerland followed by a 1-1 draw with South Korea have since done nothing to suggest the 1998 champions could go that far. 

France, who will also miss Zinedine Zidane through suspension, need to beat Togo by two clear goals to make sure of advancing to the knockout stages. We had expected to qualify more easily but we believe in ourselves and are not worried, said Silvestre. 

In 2002, France needed to win their final group match, against Denmark, by two goals. Instead they lost 0-2 and were sent packing without a win or goal from the group stage. 

We dont have the same feeling as in 2002, said Silvestre. This time we feel fresher and stronger. There is a great atmosphere in the team. 

Silvestre said France had to qualify, if only to allow Zidane to play at least another match. Zidane will retire after the finals. 

If France are eliminated, Sundays 1-1 draw with South Korea, in which he was shown his second yellow card of the tournament, will have been his last match. The best way to cheer him up is to win so he can play again, Silvestre said. (REUTERS)

 I dont think I couldve 

 written the script any better: Shane Warne

 - Iconic leg-spinner announces he will retire at the end of 

 the Ashes 

 ERA TO END! Shane Warne 

 announces his retirement from international cricket 

 during a press conference in Melbourne on Thursday.

 2, will be the 37-year-olds final appearance in 

 Australian colours. He will serve out the contract with

 Melbourne: Shane Warne, 

 Test crickets most successful bowler and one of the 

 most controversial players off the field, will retire from 

 the international stage next month, bringing the curtains 

 down on a glittering 15-year career which began against 

 India.

 The talismanic leg-spinner, who 

 mesmerised batsmen the world over but did not enjoy a high 

 success rate against Indians, formally announced his decision 

 to quit Test cricket at a press conference here on Thursday.

 I just know its my 

 time. I would like to go out on top. I would like to go 

 out on my terms, an emotional Warne, regarded as one 

 of the greatest spinners in the history of the game, said.

 Its been unbelievable 

 my journey and my ride in international cricket has been 

 phenomenal.

 Warne, who has 699 wickets from 

 143 Tests, is expected to reach the 700-milestone when he 

 bids farewell to an army of hometown Melbourne fans at the 

 fourth Ashes Test. The Sydney Test (January 2-6) will be 

 the swansong to his illustrious Test career.

 Warne, however, said that he would 

 continue to play for Hampshire for the remaining two years 

 of his contract.

 The charismatic Australian said 

 it was time to go after playing a pivotal role in regaining 

 the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead last week after 

 a shock loss in England last year.

 Im a very happy man. 

 I probably would have retired after the 2005 Ashes had we 

 won, but that was not to be. There was unfinished business. 

 For me, it was a mission to get that urn back, Warne 

 said.

 My time is now. I dont 

 think I could have written the script any better, 

 the 37-year-old spin wizard said.

 Warne said he had discussed his 

 decision to retire with captain Ricky Ponting after the 

 Perth Test.

 He said that he wanted to leave 

 the game at the height of powers and go on my terms.

 As for his future, he said he 

 would consider it over some quiet beers and a few 

 smokes.

 I dont know what the 

 future holds... There are a lot of things I would like to 

 do. Ive got two Tests to play, then I will sit back.

 Warne, the only current player 

 to be included in Wisdens top five cricketers 

 of the 20th century, also said that when he told his children 

 of his plans, they became concerned that his departure from 

 the game included their games of backyard cricket and he 

 had to assure them otherwise.

 Warne said this months stunning 

 fifth-day comeback victory over England in the second Test 

 in Adelaide helped him leave cricket while on the top of 

 his game.

 Adelaide did that I think 

 that is the best Test Ive ever played in, he 

 said.

 Ive given everything 

 I possibly could to the cause, and that was winning. Cricket 

 to me is my hobby, my passion and i love doing it. Yeah, 

 Ill probably miss it... Ive missed one-day Internationals 

 for the last four years.

 Warne said he was honoured to 

 have played in a champion Australian side and felt he had 

 contributed in some way in making the game more watchable.

 I sit here today (amidst) 

 every single trophy thats available in international 

 cricket... And I like to think that Ive played my 

 part in helping those trophies get into Cricket Australia, 

 the leg-spinner said.

 People have turned up, I 

 like to think that Ive given them entertainment and 

 Ive tried my guts out every single time. As a whole, 

 I think Ive made cricket more fun, he said.

 I dont think I could 

 have given any more to Australian cricket. Ive given 

 everything to the game.

 To end his career at the Sydney 

 Cricket Ground, the venue of his Test debut in 1991-92, 

 would be a great feeling, Warne said.

 To have an opportunity to 

 walk off in Sydney where it all began a long time ago I 

 think is a great opportunity and something to celebrate, 

 he said.

 Warne captured international limelight 

 for the first time in 1993, when he produced what has been 

 acclaimed as the ball of the century to bowl 

 Englands Mike Gatting with his first ever Ashes delivery.

 Since then, Warne has been the 

 worlds premier bowler. He has held the record for 

 the highest number of Test wickets since October 2004. In 

 August 2005, he became the first man to reach 600 Test wickets.

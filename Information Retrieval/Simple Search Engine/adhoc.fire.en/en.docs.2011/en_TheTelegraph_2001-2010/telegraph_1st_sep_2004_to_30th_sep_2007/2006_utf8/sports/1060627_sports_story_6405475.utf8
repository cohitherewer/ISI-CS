Montreal: Renaults world champion Fernando Alonso produced some Montreal magic to win the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday and deal another blow to Michael Schumachers fading title hopes (briefly reported in Mondays Late City edition). 

The 24-year-old Spaniards fourth successive win, and sixth in nine races, stretched his overall lead over Ferraris Schumacher to a hefty 25 points at the halfway point in the 18-race Formula One season. 

Alonsos victory was the 14th of his career, making him the second most successful current driver after seven-time champion Schumacher, his first in North America and took his run of podium finishes to 15 in a row. 

Its fantastic for me, he told reporters after appearing on the Montreal podium for the first time. After the last three years having opportunities to win (in Canada) and always having mistakes this is one race we should have had in opening years and now we have it. 

 Alonso leads the standings with 84 points from a possible 

 90 while Schumacher, denied an historic eighth Canadian 

 GP victory, has 59. Raikkonen has 39 and can now do little 

 more than decide which team to race for next year.

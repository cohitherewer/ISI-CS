 BCCI SGM on Dec. 16

 DALMIYA ISSUE 

Mumbai: The BCCI has convened a special general meeting (SGM) on December 16 in Jaipur with a single item agenda discussion of the disciplinary committees report on former president Jagmohan Dalmiya and the course of action to be taken against him based on the report. 

The meeting has only one item on its agenda to discuss the disciplinary committee report on Jagmohan Dalmiya which has been circulated to all the members, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here on Wednesday. 

The four-member disciplinary committee, headed by president Sharad Pawar, had summoned Dalmiya to appear before it last month in Mohali over allegations, raised against him for alleged misappropriation of funds relating to the 1996 World Cup accounts. But Dalmiya didnt attend the committees hearing. (PTI)

 Watch out for murderous Dhoni: Inzy

Lahore: Having been brought down to earth by the Indians after a string of brilliant performances in the past year, Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq is the target of criticism from several quarters. But the big man is unruffled, as he always is at the crease. 

Admitting that his team lost to a much superior foe, Inzamam said that the Indians strength is undoubtedly their batting. He picked Mahendra Singh Dhoni for special praise, saying that the wicketkeeper-batsman can be murderous at times and is one of the players to watch out for in the 2007 World Cup. 

Inzamam also talked about four other Indians (Sachin Tendulkar, Yuvraj Singh, Irfan Pathan and R.P. Singh.) The following is what he had to say about the Indian quintet. 

SACHIN TENDULKAR: He still is one of the top five batsmen in the world. He has shown by the way he batted that he is not on the decline. In my view, he is good enough for another four to five years of international cricket. 

 YUVRAJ SINGH: He is an exciting talent who 

 has now learnt to finish off games. He has the power to 

 play big shots and is equally clever in finding the gaps 

 to nudge and push the balls for ones and twos. His footwork 

 has improved tremendously. The only time he looks uncomfortable 

 is when he receives short-pitched deliveries. 

 IRFAN PATHAN: He is blossoming into an allrounder 

 India so desperately needed to strike the right balance 

 in one-dayers. He was always a good bowler who bowled a 

 teasing line and length, but his batting has improved after 

 Greg Chappell threw him in the deep pan and made him realise 

 that he has the ability to graft as well as play big shots. 

 I dont think a drop in speed has made him a less effective 

 bowler. If the line and length are good, you can be effective. 

 MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI: I can easily pick him 

 as one of the players to be watched in the 2007 World Cup. 

 He is unorthodox but very effective and, at times, murderous. 

 He is difficult to bowl to because he has this ability to 

 hit even the good balls with a jab shot. He is equally good 

 with the horizontal and vertical bat shots. He is safe behind 

 the wickets and can be compared to Adam Gilchrist. 

 RUDRA PRATAP SINGH: A committed 

 bowler who bowls with a lot of heart and determination. 

 He is young and will surely gain speed and at the same time 

 will maintain top grade fitness. (PTI)

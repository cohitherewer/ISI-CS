 Chopra joint 21st

Illinois: Indo-Swede Daniel Chopra slid from a birdie spree on the second day to a bogey spree on the third to play a nightmarish front nine and finish the round with a five-over 76 at the $5 million Cialis Western Open Golf tournament here. 

Chopra dropped to tied 21st spot after being the leader for the first two days of the event. His previous two rounds were 66-66, and he shared the first round lead and then held it solely by two shots after two days. (PTI)

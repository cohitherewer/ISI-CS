 Immelman tops

 - Western Open 

Lemont (Illinois): Daniel Chopra failed to conjure up the form he showed on the first two days, as he carded a final round of two-over 73 and ended tied 30th at the Cialis Western Open here on Sunday. 

Having led the field in the first two rounds, the Indo-Swedish player finished with a total of 3-under 281. South African Trevor Immelman won the title, his first on the PGA Tour, as he staved off a surging Tiger Woods. 

Immelman sank a stunning 32-foot birdie on the final hole for a card of 67 and tallied 13-under-par 271. 

Woods (68) finished tied second with Matthew Goggin (69) with an overall 11-under 273. 

Third round leader Vijai Singh (73) was tied fourth with five others including Stewart Cink (71) and Jim Furyk (70). 

Another birdie on sixth was followed by a bogey on eighth as he turned in even par. (PTI)

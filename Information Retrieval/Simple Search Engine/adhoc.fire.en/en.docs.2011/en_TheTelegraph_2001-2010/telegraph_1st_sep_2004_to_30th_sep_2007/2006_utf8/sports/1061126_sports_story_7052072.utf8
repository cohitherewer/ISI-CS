Kochi (Japan): Jeev Milkha Singh displayed fine iron play and carded a bogey-free three-under 69 to get back into shared lead after the third round of the $1.19 million Casio World Open Golf Championship here on Saturday. 

Jeevs 69 put him at 12-under 204 and in joint lead with Tetsuya Haraguchi (70), who played with Jeev in the lead group and matched the Indian shot for shot. The leaders were two clear of the next pack of three players at 10-under 206. 

Jeev and Haraguchi shared the first-round honours before the Japanese moved one shot ahead at the midway stage. 

The 34-year-old Jeev, seeking his maiden title in Japan, has been in amazing form having finished in the top-10 ten times in 15 starts in Japan this season. He has also won twice this season at the Volvo China Open, a joint-sanctioned event on Asian and Japan Tours, and then the Volvo Masters of Europe in Valderrama, Spain. Jeevs score did not do justice to the golf he played. 

He struck the ball beautifully and reached the greens in regulation on 89 per cent of the occasions and missed just two all day. 

But his putting was not in accordance as he needed 32 putts, as compared to 29 and 31 on first two days. 

I have been playing well all season and this could be a good chance to make a bid for my first title in Japan , said Jeev who has finished second at least five times in Japan in the last five years. 

As I keep telling myself, as long as I am in contention, I am always in with a chance and it will ultimately come. 

That was the kind of confidence that helped him break a seven-year-long title drought when he won the Volvo China Open in April this year. 

Jeev has been playing the last few weeks with a wrist injury and has been braving it in his quest for a title in Japan and a place in worlds top-50. He is currently a career-high 63rd on the world list. 

Hideki Kase (70), Toshinori Muto (69) and David Smail (67) were all tied third at 10-under 206. Two other players, Yoshikazu Haku (68) and Lin Keng-Chi (69) were tied for sixth at nine-under 207. 

Earlier in the tournament, Michelle Wie failed to make the cut after shooting rounds of 81 and 80 and finishing 100th among 100 participants.

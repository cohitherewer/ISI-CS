New Delhi: For 12-year-old Parimarjan Negi, becoming the worlds second youngest Grandmaster is hardly an achievement. He sees it as nothing but the first step towards attaining greater goals and understanding the important challenges that lie ahead. 

On Thursday, when Delhi Chess Association (DCA) felicitated him, everyone on the dais sounded truly excited. They heaped praise on the youngster and felt he was the best thing to happen to Indian chess after Viswanathan Anand. The only person who spoke differently was the prodigy himself. 

Speaking softly but clearly, Negi said: Though it has not yet dawned on me that I am a Grandmaster, I realise I stand only on the first step of the long-winding spiral staircase of my international career. 

It has been a journey towards certain goals that he honestly did not perceive before. 

The Delhi boy became the second-youngest GM in the history of the game by earning his final norm at the Chelyabinsk meet in Russia. The IM title and the first GM norm came in the space of a week. In the very next tournament, at home, came the second GM norm. 

Honestly, I did not expect the second norm to follow so soon. But once I had two norms, I wanted to get the third and final one in a hurry. Thank God, I didnt have to wait too long, said Negi. 

DCA secretary Bharat Singh Chauhan, also treasurer of the AICF, said efforts are on to bring Ukraines Katrina Lano the youngest GM among women to play a match against Negi, probably in November. 

Negi, however, is planning to take a two-month break from competitive chess. I am not playing any tournament in the next two months. I will concentrate on studies, go to school. Ive also planned short stints with Elizbar Ubilava of Ukraine and Lev Psakhis of Israel.

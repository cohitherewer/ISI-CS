 SA appoint Rhodes as fielding coach

 2007 World Cup

 Durban: South Africa have 

 appointed Jonty Rhodes as ODI fielding coach to help in 

 their preparations for the 2007 World Cup.

 Cricket South Africa (CSA) chief 

 executive Gerald Majola said Rhodes inclusion in the 

 team management was part of a larger strategic plan targetting 

 the quadrennial event in the West Indies next March-April.

 The strategic plan is aimed 

 at leaving no stone unturned in order to give the Proteas 

 the very best preparation available, Majola said.

 We will be using all the 

 expertise at our disposal. For instance, we have added Rhodes 

 to the Proteas management team as an ODI specialist from 

 now until after the World Cup.

 Rhodes will work in tandem with 

 convenor of selectors Haroon Lorgat, national coach Mickey 

 Arthur, captain Graeme Smith, professional cricket general 

 manager Vince van der Bijl and Majola.

 The announcement means Rhodes, 

 who is due to assist the Pakistan squad for two weeks before 

 their tour of England, will return home for a long-term 

 association.

 Majola also announced a 25-man 

 training squad.

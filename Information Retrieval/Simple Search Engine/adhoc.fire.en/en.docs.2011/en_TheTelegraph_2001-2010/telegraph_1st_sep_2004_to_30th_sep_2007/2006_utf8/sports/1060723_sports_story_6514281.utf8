 Jeev slips to tied eighth

Hokkaido: Ace Indian golfer Jeev Milkha Singh slipped to tied eighth after a topsy-turvy back nine at the Sega Sammy Cup golf tournament here on Saturday. 

Jeev had two bogeys, a double bogey and two birdies as he ended the day with a one-over 73 and a total of two-over to be two-under for three days. 

Jeev, who was four behind leader Yeh Wei Tze (72), was sharing the eighth place with Chris Campbell (69) and Kenichi Kuboya (75). 

Jeev, starting on the first, birdied the seventh and ninth and dropped a shot on the eighth to turn in one-under. 

Then on the back nine, he bogeyed the 10th and 12th, as he missed short par putts but did make up with a birdie on the 11th. 

Three pars followed from 13th to the 15th. On the 16th, he double bogeyed and just as he came to the end, he birdied the 18th to finish with a 73. 

Wei Tze, who birdied the third and eighth, bogeyed three times in four holes between the ninth and 12th. He recovered for a series of pars and finally a birdie on the 18th for a 72 that kept him at six-under and in top spot. 

Azuno Yano (70) and Hidemasa Hoshino (73) were at five-under and in tied second place, while four players ? Ye Yang (73), Chawalit Plaphol (74), Shoichi Ideguchi (72) and Liang Wen-Chong (72) ? were at three-under in tied fourth. 

Jeev has had four top-10 finishes in six starts in Japan this season. (PTI)

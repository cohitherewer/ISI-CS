 Pakistan gain upper hand

Karachi: The see-saw battle in the series-deciding third Test here continued on Monday with Pakistan gaining a distinct edge at stumps on Day II. 

Earlier, the Indians recovered from a worrisome 74 for four overnight to reach 238, only seven runs short of Pakistans first innings score. 

But on a wicket that appeared to have eased considerably after offering assistance to bowlers on Day I, Pakistan notched up 173 for two to take an overall lead of 180. 

Unless the hosts lose quick wickets on Tuesday, they will be firmly in the drivers seat. 

Pakistan openers Imran Farhat (57) and Salman Butt (53) provided a flying start to the second innings before India dismissed them in quick succession. But stand-in captain Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf once again came to their teams rescue. 

At close, Younis was batting on 25 while Yousuf, who became only the fifth Pakistani batsman to reach the 5,000-run milestone, was giving him company on 30. 

To make matters worse for India, Sachin Tendulkar collided with Yousuf while trying to run him out at the non-strikers end and had to leave the ground for medical attention. 

He did not take the field again till stumps, Harbhajan Singh substituting for him. 

In the morning, India allowed Pakistan to fight their way back after the home team was frustrated by the overnight pair of Sourav Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh who added 62 runs in just 12 overs. 

The fifth wicket pair batted in a very determined fashion and weathered a stormy spell from Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar. 

The duo saw off Shoaib, who tried to intimidate the pair with short stuff aimed at their ribs, only to fritter away the good start through some careless strokes. 

Sourav, who made a determined 34 by taking blows from Shoaib on his body, looked in fine touch with his off-side caresses and glides. 

But the stylish left-hander was also guilty of throwing away his wicket. 

Souravs departure, after a stay of 94 minutes and 53 balls, started a slide which was arrested by a late partnership of 56 between Irfan Pathan (40, six fours and a six) and Zaheer Khan (21).

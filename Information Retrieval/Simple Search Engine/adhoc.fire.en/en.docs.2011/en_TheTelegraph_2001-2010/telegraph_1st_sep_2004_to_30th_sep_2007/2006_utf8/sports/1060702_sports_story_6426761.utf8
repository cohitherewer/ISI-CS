The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Players hail Agassi

London: Andre Agassi, the flamboyant American who played his last match at the Wimbledon on Saturday, was given an emotional send-off by fellow tennis players, to many of whom he had served as an inspiration. Agassi had won at the Big W in 1992, apart from being only one of the five men ever to have won all four Grand Slam titles. The following is what the players had to say: 

Kim Clijsters: I sometimes get goose bumps just by watching him play because the attention he had in his eyes, I dont think you see that a lot in any player when hes really focused. Thats been incredible to see. 

Roger Federer: We are losing a big legend of the game, so its never pleasant. But hes had a terrific career. I was lucky enough to play against him. It is an incredible achievement to win all four Grand Slams. 

Lleyton Hewitt: Tennis owes him a lot, purely because hes such a marketable guy worldwide. Hes been a great personality for our sport. Especially coming as a young kid into the tennis world, I guess wearing funky clothes, the earrings, long hair. 

Andy Roddick: The moments I remember are the spandex and the mullet. And the match (1992 Wimbledon final) with (Goran) Ivanisevic here I think was the first time I actually sat down and watched a full five-set match. 

Marat Safin: He was the first guy who made tennis a show and entertaining. He won a lot of Grand Slams and everything but he made this entertainment with his looks, with his pants, with the fashion that he brought into tennis. He had such charisma. Agassi is Agassi. Its like a brand. (Reuters)

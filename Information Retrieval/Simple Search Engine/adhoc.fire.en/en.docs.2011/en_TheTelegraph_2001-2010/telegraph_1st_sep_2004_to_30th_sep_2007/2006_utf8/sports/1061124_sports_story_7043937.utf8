Multan: Pakistans Mohammed Yousuf missed a double century by nine runs as the second Test against the West Indies ended in a high-scoring draw on Thursdays final day. 

Yousuf made 191, his seventh hundred this year, putting on 152 runs for the sixth wicket with Abdul Razzaq, who was out for 80, as Pakistan reached 461 for seven before play was called off after tea. 

Pakistan lead the three-match series 1-0 after a nine-wicket win in the first Test in Lahore. 

Pakistan made 357 in their first innings in the drawn Test before skipper Brian Lara scored a magnificent 216 to spearhead a reply of 591. 

 Yousuf, who was 176 at tea, also missed a double hundred in Lahore by eight runs. 

He completed his 21st career century and joined West Indian Viv Richards and Sri Lankan Aravinda de Silva in the elite list of batsmen who have hit seven hundreds in a calendar year. 

His 1562 runs in 10 Tests in the year are second to Richards 1710 runs in 11 matches in 1976. Before this year, Yousuf had scored 14 hundreds in seven years. 

Yousuf said he wants to surpass Richards tally during the third and final Test against the West Indies next week. 

I am not disappointed because now I believe what God does has a reason and it is your fate. But, yes, I am eager to set a new record in the final Test. It would be a big achievement for me and my country, he said. 

Meanwhile, Mohammed Sami has been called up for the third and final Test starting on Monday in Karachi. He replaces left arm spinner Abdul Rehman.

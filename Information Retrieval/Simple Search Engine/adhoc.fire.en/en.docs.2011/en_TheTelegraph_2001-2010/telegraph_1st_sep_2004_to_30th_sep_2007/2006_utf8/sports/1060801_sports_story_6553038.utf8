 Indian eves clinch series

London: Riding on fine half centuries by Monica Surma and captain Mithali Raj, Indian eves thrashed Ireland by 79 runs to win the rain-marred second and final one-day International on Monday, sweeping the series 2-0. 

Surma scored 62 and Raj hung on to make 66 to propel India to an impressive 239 for four in their stipulated 50 overs after Ireland won the toss and put them in. 

Anjum Chopra and Hemlata Kala chipped in with 23 and 30, respectively. 

However, the target was revised and reduced to 214 in 40 overs by the Duckworth-Lewis method after rain interrupted play. India restricted Ireland to 135 for eight. 

Nooshin-al Khadeer and Jhulan Goswami were the pick of the bowlers with 2 for 20 and 2 for 25, respectively. 

The Indian team now travel to England to play a one-off Twenty20 match on August 20, two Tests and five one-dayers.

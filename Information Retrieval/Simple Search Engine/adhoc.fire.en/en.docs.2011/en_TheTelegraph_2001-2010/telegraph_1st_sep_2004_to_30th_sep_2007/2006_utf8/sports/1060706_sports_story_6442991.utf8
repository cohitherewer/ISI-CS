The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 2nd edition in Mohali next June

 - AFRO-ASIAN Cup

 - Kenya to host in 2008 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: The second edition of the Afro-Asian 

Cup, a fund-raising venture of the Afro-Asian Cricket Cooperation featuring three 

Asia XI versus Africa XI ODIs, is going to be held in Mohali next June. 

In all probability from June 4-8. 

Mohali, of course, is where the Inderjit Singh Bindra-headed Punjab Cricket Association is headquartered. Today, his influence is huge. 

According to The Telegraphssources, the 

venue and likely dates were decided upon during the Afro-Asian bodys AGM 

in London on Monday. 

Edition No.1, which saw a 1-1 finish, was hosted by South Africa last August. The third (and final) one will be in Kenya 23 months from now. 

Just like last year, the Cup is going to showcase three matches? In order to keep TV production costs down, all have to be at one venue, one of the sources pointed out. 

Another added that the ODIs will begin at 4.00 pm: That was, you may recall, the start of the Independence Cup matches (in Mohali) nine years ago... 

Incidentally, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Sharad Pawar is going to continue at the helm of the Afro-Asian body till the next AGM ? at least. 

With Indias term over, Pawar vacated the Asian Cricket Council chiefs chair last month and it was expected that successor Jayanta Dharmadasa (from Sri Lanka) would head the Afro-Asian body as well. 

At the AGM, though, it was felt that Pawar should retain the top post. Sri Lanka didnt object, informed one of the sources. 

Meanwhile, one learns that the BCCI could oppose a recommendation by the Sunil Gavaskar-headed cricket committee of the International Cricket Council, allowing each team three appeals to the third umpire in each innings. 

Indeed, whatever else, its perhaps not insignificant that the Pawar regime sees Gavaskar as one who was closely aligned with Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

The final decision rests with the world bodys 

Executive Board, but there does seem to be considerable opposition to the proposed 

referrals.

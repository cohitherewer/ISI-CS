 Ill play even better vs Japan: Ronaldo

Dortmund: Ronaldo is promising to pick up the pace in Brazils match against Japan on Thursday. 

The veteran striker had a dismal outing in Brazils 1-0 opening win over Croatia ? barely touching the ball and being substituted in the 69th minute ? and improved only slightly in the teams 2-0 victory over Australia. 

Im very upbeat for this match, Ronaldo said on his website. I feel very good physically and I know Ill play even better against Japan. 

The Real Madrid player has been working overtime recently to get back in shape. Hes been taking part in individual training sessions in addition to the regular practices with the rest of the squad. 

Ive been practising hard and Im certain that the results will show even more in the match against Japan, he said. 

Ronaldo arrived for the World Cup admittedly overweight after enduring a series of injuries with Real Madrid earlier in the season.

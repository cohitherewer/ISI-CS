 Younis likely to return

 Younis Khan 

London: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khan handed his side a boost ahead of next weeks second Test against England when he returned to action after a knee injury. 

Khan, 28, missed the drawn first Test at Lords last week but was back on the field for his countrys four-day match against Northamptonshire, which began on Thursday. 

If he comes through the game unscathed, Khan is certain to return to the Pakistan Test squad at the Old Trafford, Manchester on July 27. 

Khan, who has scored five hundreds in his last 11 Tests, is captaining Pakistan at Northampton as coach Bob Woolmer has rested several first-choice players including regular skipper Inzamam-ul Haq. 

Woolmer said: he is 100 percent fit and will be back and firing, which is very good news for us. 

Pakistan allrounder Abdul Razzaq, leg-spinner Danish Kaneria and Lords double-centurion Mohammad Yousuf all sit out the Northamptonshire warm-up. 

Team manager Zaheer Abbas hinted leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed, currently playing County cricket in England with Sussex, could be called into the side at Old Trafford if the pitch looks like it will take spin. 

The Pakistan Cricket Board has sanctioned his inclusion as an additional member of the touring party and Abbas said: if we are going to call him for Old Trafford we have to play him. 

He has been playing here and has done very well so there is no need for him to get a game beforehand.

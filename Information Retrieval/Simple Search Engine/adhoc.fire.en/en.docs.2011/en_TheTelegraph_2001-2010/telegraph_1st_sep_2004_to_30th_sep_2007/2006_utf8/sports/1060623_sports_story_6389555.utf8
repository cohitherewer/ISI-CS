 Ronaldos secret is out

Rio de Janeiro: A great Brazilian mystery long shrouded in secret has been resolved. 

Ronaldo weighs 90.5 kilos, just 500 grams above the ideal weight of a man six-feet-one-inch tall, Brazil physical trainer Moraci Santanna has revealed. 

Santanna told a TV channel that the Real Madrid star widely accused of carrying too much around the midriff, had been up to 95 kilos but is now close to his ideal weight. 

The issue had become one of state with Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva enquiring about the state of the stars fitness before they opened their World Cup campaign with two unimpressive narrow wins over Croatia and Australia. 

Ronaldo responded angrily saying: Just as he says Im fat, everybody knows he drinks too much. 

Lula sent a fax to the team headquarters saying he had broached the issue not as criticism but as a concerned fan. 

Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said last week that Ronaldo was very strong but his body has changed. He is not the youngster he was in 1994. (AFP)

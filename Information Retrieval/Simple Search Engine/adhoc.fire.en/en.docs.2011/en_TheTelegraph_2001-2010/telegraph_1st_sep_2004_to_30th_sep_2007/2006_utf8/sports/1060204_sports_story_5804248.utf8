OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Peshawar: The arrival of the four ODI specialists ? Murali Kartik, Mohammed Kaif, Suresh Raina and S. Sreesanth ? has been delayed. Now, they will either reach here late on Saturday morning or early in the afternoon. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, they missed the Lahore-Islamabad flight on Friday night owing to the late arrival of the Indian Airlines service from New Delhi. They were to have driven down from the capital. 

Now, the quartet is either going to catch an early morning Lahore-Islamabad flight and, then, drive down or undertake a seven-hour drive from Lahore itself. Theres no Lahore-Peshawar flight on Saturdays.

 Powell runs fastest 100 of year

Kingston: Asafa Powell ran the fastest time in the 100m this year, winning his event in 9.95 seconds at the Jamaica International Invitational meet. 

Powell broke away in the six-man field in midrace and easily beat Trinidad and Tobagos Marc Burns, who finished second in 10.22, and fellow Jamaican Ainsley Waugh, who was third in 10.31. 

Powell, who holds the world record of 9.77, says he is fully recovered from a groin injury that kept him out of competition for nearly a year. 

Im looking forward to that and running even faster times, Powell said on Saturday. 

Another impressive winner was American Lashinda Demus in the 400m hurdles. She won in a season-best time of 54.20 ahead of Jamaicans Allison Beckford (56.19) and Kallis Spencer (56.71). 

Kerron Clements, also of the United States, easily won the mens 400m hurdles, beating Jamaicans Dean Griffiths and Danny McFarlane. 

Clements finished in 48.95. Griffiths was second and McFarlane third. (AP)

 Ghei ends 5th, Jeev 7th

 China Golf

 Sanya: Gaurav Ghei shot 

 a brilliant six-under 66 and finished fifth for his best-ever 

 effort on a European Tour event as the $1 million TCL Classic 

 drew to an end at the Yalong Bay Golf Club on Sunday.

 Ghei, whose only win on Asian 

 Tour came way back in 1995, finished at 21-under in the 

 event jointly sanctioned by the Asian and European Tour.

 Jeev Milkha Singh, who was five 

 off the leader overnight, played a roller-coaster round 

 with a three-over 39 for the front nine, and then followed 

 that up with a brilliant five-under 31 on back journey with 

 six birdies and one bogey.

 Meanwhile, Swedish sensation Johan 

 Edfors enjoyed his biggest career win when he lifted the 

 title after a final round of four-under-par 68 today. Edfors, 

 31, was two strokes off the pace going into the last day 

 but he came through with flying colours and collected the 

 winners cheque of $166,660 after a four-day total 

 of 25-under-par 263.

 Amandeep Johl, who had a great 

 second round of 63, ended the week with a par round of 72 

 and at 14-under 274 for a tied 21st place.

 Shiv Kapurs closing one-under 

 71 gave him a total of 11-under 277 and a tied 41st, the 

 same as Rahil Gangjee, who stumbled with a one-over 73 in 

 final round.

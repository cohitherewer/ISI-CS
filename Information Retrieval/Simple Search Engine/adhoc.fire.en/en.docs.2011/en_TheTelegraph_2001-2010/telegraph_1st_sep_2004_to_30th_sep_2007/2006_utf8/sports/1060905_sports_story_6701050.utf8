 Seniors must get back to basics: Chappell

 - There are no short cuts or magic formula, says team India coach 

 Greg Chappell 

Bangalore: Team India coach Greg Chappell has said that senior players, including Sachin Tendulkar, need to get back to the basics. 

On the next batch of senior players slated to join the rolling camp here on Tuesday, Chappell said: There will be some variations, but sometimes the senior players need to get back to the basics as well. 

I think this (the ongoing camp) is an opportunity to get them back to the basics, the former Australia captain said. 

The good thing about players such as Sachin, (Virender) Sehwag, (Rahul) Dravid, Yuvraj (Singh) and (Mohammed) Kaif is that these guys have been around for a long time, yet they are ready to revisit the basics from time to time. 

There are no short cuts or magic formula. It is about applying the basics better than the other person, the Team India coach said. 

On Sachin, Chappell said the maestro will basically revisit the basics much like anyone else. He will give an input on what he wants to do. He has a very clear idea on what he needs. We (biomechanist Ian) Frazer and myself had a session with him up in Mumbai last week and he is working on some specifics. He is very good in understanding his own game. 

On specific goals vis-a-vis the Champions Trophy, Chappell said: We have identified some areas in ODIs where all teams are finding it difficult to adjust. We also find it difficult and we are trying to get better at that, he said. 

The Team India coach said they were looking at repositioning some of the resources against different teams because of the faster bowlers they may have, so that the team could match what our best attribute is against their best attribute at that time. 

So it could mean someone who bats down the order may bat up and someone who bats up could bat lower down. I dont think there are any set solutions to any situation. So we need to be ready to give our best attribute to that situation. 

Chappell said hitting the stumps is a critical thing in ODIs and if one can get one or two run-outs, it makes a big difference like having an extra bowler. So we are just trying to improve all around, he said, adding: When you get a group of 15, it is very hard to get a one-on-one session but with just five players 

That was one of the reasons behind having a small group this time. We wont have an opportunity like this again before the World Cup and it is a blessing in disguise. 

We would have preferred to play on in Sri Lanka but may be this (rolling camp) was meant to happen, he said. 

On the second phase, which concluded on Monday, Chappell said it has been another good one. 

We varied it a little bit this time as these guys (M.S. Dhoni, R.P. Singh, Sreesanth, Suresh Raina and Munaf Patel) identified fielding as an area that they wanted to work on as well. 

We did some extra fielding stuff on Monday morning. It went very well. The boys responded excellently to what we were doing in the camp. I am hopeful that the third one will be even better. 

On the aspects of fielding that he focused on, the coach said it was on throwing in from the deep. 

We are reasonably good in short distance, but we need to work on the longer distance throws. We are working on a few areas in their technique so that they get more power and accuracy when they throw. 

We have identified areas which each player has to work on individually but also as a group while playing on slower wickets, against taller bowlers. The stumps and the golf ball is about building confidence really. 

Chappell pointed out that if the players can consistently hit the golf ball with the stumps then they have to get into good positions. 

You cant get into bad positions and get away with it with a golf ball which you may do with a cricket bat and a cricket ball. We are emphasising on good basics again.

 Olympic berth eludes Jung

New Delhi: Samresh Jung squandered the opportunity to grab an Olympic quota place from the World Cups, finishing a distant 43rd in the fourth and last ISSF event for rifle and pistol shooters this year in Milan. 

Jung disappointed with a tally of 574 (97, 95, 95, 96, 95, 96) in the 10m pistol event on Thursday. 

He will now get another chance to book an Olympic berth in the World Shooting Championships in Zagreb, Croatia, next month. (PTI)

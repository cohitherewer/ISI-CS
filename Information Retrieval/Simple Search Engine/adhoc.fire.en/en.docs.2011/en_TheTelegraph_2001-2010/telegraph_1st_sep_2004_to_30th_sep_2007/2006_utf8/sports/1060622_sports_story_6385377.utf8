 Court notice on Modi

Mumbai: Bombay High Court on Wednesday issued notice to the BCCI to file within four weeks its reply to a petition seeking removal of vice-president Lalit Modi from his post on the ground that he had been allegedly convicted by a US court in 1985 for possessing 400gm cocaine. 

The direction was given by a bench on a PIL filed by Chandravardhan Parekh, seeking a direction to remove Modi as BCCIs office-bearer. (PTI)

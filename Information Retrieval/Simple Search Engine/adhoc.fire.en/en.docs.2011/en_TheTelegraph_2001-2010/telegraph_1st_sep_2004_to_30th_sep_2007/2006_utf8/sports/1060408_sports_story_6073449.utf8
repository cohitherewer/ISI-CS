 Dalmiya gets support from Mani

 - ICC president says he has never doubted his integrity

 and Jagmohan Dalmiya

 Mumbai: Even as Jagmohan Dalmiya worries about 

 the beating his image continues to take, he can draw comfort 

 from International Cricket Council (ICC) president Ehsan 

 Manis comments in Kochi on Friday morning. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph 

 at the Taj Malabar, he said: Ive not only known 

 Mr Dalmiya for over a decade-and-half, but have worked with 

 him in different capacities? I never once got the impression 

 his integrity could be questioned? 

Mani added that the issue of an FIR having been filed against Dalmiya, by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah, was raised during last months meeting of the ICCs Executive Board in Dubai. 

The vice-president (Percy Sonn) brought it up as Mr Dalmiya is a former ICC president and is respected in the world body, he pointed out. 

Apparently, when the ICC wanted details of the FIR, the BCCI ? a body Dalmiya headed for three years from 2001 ? indicated that specifics would have to be obtained from the concerned police station in Mumbai. 

Sonn, incidentally, is going to succeed Mani in June. While Dalmiya was the first Asian to head the ICC, Mani (whose roots are in Pakistan) is the second. 

Among other things, those currently running the BCCI have accused Dalmiya of misappropriation. Following the FIR, the economic offences wing of the Mumbai polices crime branch has already initiated a probe. 

Dalmiya, it may be recalled, had been most influential in the BCCI from around 1993 till last November. 

Equations changed when his candidate, the highly unimpressive Ranbir Singh Mahendra, got thrashed by Union minister Sharad Pawar in the election for the top post. 

A year earlier, Dalmiyas casting vote had ended Pawars bid No.1 for the BCCI presidency.

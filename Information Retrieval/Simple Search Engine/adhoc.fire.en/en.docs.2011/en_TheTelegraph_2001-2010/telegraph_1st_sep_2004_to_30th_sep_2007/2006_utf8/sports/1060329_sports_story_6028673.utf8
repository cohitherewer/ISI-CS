 Even a murderer is given a fair trial: Nayeem

A STAFF REPORTER

 Nayeem at South Club on Tuesday 

Calcutta: Sacked Indian coach Syed Nayeemuddin lashed out at All India Football Federation (AIFF)s decision to release him without giving him an opportunity to explain the cause of the teams debacle in the recently-concluded Asian Cup qualifiers. 

Even a murderer is given a fair trial before he is hanged. But that was not done in my case, Nayeemuddin said at the Calcutta South Club on Tuesday. It was sort of pre-planned? I would have been thrown out even much earlier, had we not won the SAFF championship, he added. 

Nayeemuddin had received a letter from AIFF, saying that he has been released from the duty of chief coach effective from coming Saturday (April 1). 

I was not informed of the reason for my dismissal, he said. He also indicated that AIFF secretary-general Alberto Colaco has played a key role in his ouster. One single official had made up his mind to remove me? I can gather from what has happened since my removal that he was determined (to sack me), he said agitatedly. 

The former coach said that he was given very little time by the AIFF to formulate any proper strategy for the team. No coach can produce results in such a short time, he said. 

He also blamed the conditions of the Jawaharlal Stadium, which played host to the teams practice sessions before the Asian Cup matches against Japan and Yemen. The ground was not suitable for any soccer-related activity, he observed. 

Nayeemuddin was shown the door after the India were thrashed in the Asian Cup qualifying matches, first by Japan (0-6) in Yokohama and then, Yemen (0-3) in New Delhi. 

He also expressed his aversion to the idea of roping in a foreign coach, saying We have several able and qualified former footballers who could do the job well.

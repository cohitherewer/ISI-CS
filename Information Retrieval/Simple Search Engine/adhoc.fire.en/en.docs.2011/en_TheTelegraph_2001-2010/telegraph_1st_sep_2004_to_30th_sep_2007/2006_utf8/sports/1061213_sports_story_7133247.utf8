The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rana declared best in Doha

New Delhi: Jaspal Rana, who came back from oblivion to scoop up three gold medals in pistol events in Doha, was on Tuesday declared the Best Sportsperson of the 15th Asian Games. 

The enfant terrible of Indian shooting became the first ever sportsperson from the country to bag the coveted honour and would now fly back to Doha to receive the honour personally. 

The award would be bestowed to him during the Games closing ceremony on Friday, Rana said. 

The original pin-up boy of Indian shooting, Rana had won the first shooting gold medal for the country 12 years ago at the Hiroshima Asiad. 

This edition saw him pick three gold medals, and a silver in pistol events. 

I am very happy and I will be going to Doha to personally accept the award, the 30-year-old gushed after receiving the news from the National Rifle Association Of India. 

Rana, who had returned here only Saturday with the rest of the Indian shooting contingent, felt the award may have gone his way from among 10,000 competitors at the Games because he had braved ill health en route to winning the medal in centre fire competition with a world equalling mark (590). 

NRAI secretary Baljeet Singh Sethi said it was a big achievement not only for Rana, but for the entire country. 

It is very big news. He has been declared best among 10,000 participants. Even the Chinese who have bagged well over 100 gold medals, could not get this award, he said.

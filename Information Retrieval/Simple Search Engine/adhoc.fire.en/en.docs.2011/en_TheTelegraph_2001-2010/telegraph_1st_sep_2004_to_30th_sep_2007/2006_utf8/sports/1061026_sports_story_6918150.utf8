London: Premier League strugglers West Ham United were knocked out of the League Cup 1-2 by third division Chesterfield in a third-round shock on Tuesday. 

The east London side, which is second from bottom in the top flight and has now lost eight games in a row, were sunk by an 87th-minute close-range strike from Caleb Folan. 

There were no such problems for the majority of Premier League sides facing second division opponents, with Arsenal winning 2-0 at West Bromwich Albion, Everton thrashing Luton Town 4-0 and Watford overcoming Hull City 2-1. 

Aston Villa manager Martin Neill found his return to former club Leicester City a difficult challenge as his top flight side had to work hard for a 3-2 extra-time victory. 

Leeds United slumped 1-3 at home to fellow second division side Southend United in front of former England midfielder Dennis Wise, who was named as their new manager on Tuesday. 

Premier League newcomers Sheffield United, however, lost 2-4 at home to second division Birmingham City. 

The big surprise came at Saltergate despite West Ham having got off to the perfect start when they took the lead through Marlon Harewoods volley after just four minutes. 

They failed to add to their score, however, and Colin Larkin got Chesterfield back on level terms in the 54th minute after being set up by Folan to fire home with his left foot. 

Chesterfield, in the fourth round for only the second time after their other appearance in 1965, were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1997 but are now struggling in 15th in the third division. 

In Tuesdays other ties, fourth division Notts County got past second division Southampton 2-0, fourth division Wycombe Wanderers beat third division Doncaster 3-2 on penalties as did third division Port Vale against second division Norwich City. 

In Berlin, second division Cologne struck twice in extra-time to beat local rivals Schalke 4-2 and knock the Bundesliga co-leaders out of the German Cup. 

Schalke fought back from two goals down to draw level at the end of 90 minutes, despite having midfielder Zlatan Bajramovic sent off while the score was still 2-1. 

They missed a good chance at the start of the first period of extra-time and Cologne capitalised when Thomas Broich took a pass from Ricardo Cabanas and blasted past Frank Rost in the 98th minute. 

Broich then set up Adil Chihi for the clinching fourth in the 111th minute. 

Defeat for Schalke, who are level with Werder Bremen at the top of the Bundesliga, was the only real surprise in the eight second matches on Tuesday. 

Borussia Dortmund, who had goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller sent off early in the second half, lost an all-Bundesliga clash with Hanover 96 1-0. VfB Stuttgart came safely through, winning 4-2 away to Babelsberg 03 in an entertaining match. 

Cologne, relegated from the first division last season, dominated early on against Schalke and took the lead in the 34th minute when Dario Rodriguez deflected a Salvatore Gambino cross into his own net. 

The second followed almost immediately for the home side as Milivoje Novakovic tucked a shot under Rost at the end of a swift break. 

Peter Lovenkrands took advantage of a defensive slip to pull one back in the 55th minute and even though Bajramovic was sent off for retaliation 14 minutes later, Schalke grabbed an equaliser with a Rodriguez header 15 minutes from time.

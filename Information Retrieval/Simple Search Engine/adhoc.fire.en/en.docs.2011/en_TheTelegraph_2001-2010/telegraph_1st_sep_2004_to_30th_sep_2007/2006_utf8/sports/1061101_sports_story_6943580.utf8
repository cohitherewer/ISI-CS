 Jeev, Choi to take part

 Hong Kong Open 

Hong Kong: The chances of an Asian winning the UBS Hong Kong Open after eight years have received a massive boost following stunning overseas victories for two of the events marquee players, Jeev Milkha Singh and K.J. Choi. 

Indian ace Jeev registered the biggest win of his career on Sunday at the European Tours season-ending Volvo Masters in Spain, holding off a star-studded field to triumph by one shot. A few hours later, Korean star Choi notched up his fourth USPGA Tour success with a comfortable victory in the Chrysler Championship in Florida. 

The duo will lead a powerful Asian challenge at the $2 million UBS Hong Kong Open where they will be aiming to end a run of seven victories by Europeans. Koreas Kang Wook-soon was the last Asian to lift the trophy in 1998. 

In the hunt with Jeev and Choi will be Chinese No. 1 Liang Wenchong another winner at the weekend when he cruised to a 12-shot victory in the China Tours season-ending Omega Championship in Beijing. 

The Asian contingent will face a tough battle to reclaim the trophy at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling from November 16. 

Defending champion Colin Montgomerie of Scotland will spearhead the European challenge while Major winners Retief Goosen (South Africa) and Michael Campbell (New Zealand) will also be in the fray. 

Jeev will be doubly motivated to produce an outstanding display at Fanling to help him achieve the goal of ending the season as Asias No. 1.

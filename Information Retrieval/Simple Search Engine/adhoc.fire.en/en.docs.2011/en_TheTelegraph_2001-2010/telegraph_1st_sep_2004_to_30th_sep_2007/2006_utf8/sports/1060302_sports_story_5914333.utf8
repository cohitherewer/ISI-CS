The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I want my players to constantly raise the bar, not look for safe options

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE Team India captain Rahul Dravid says all decisions arent easy, but one has to accept them and move on 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Rahul Dravid

Nagpur: Time really is at a premium for Rahul Dravid, particularly in the Orange City, his sasural. Yet, the Team India captain spared more than half-an-hour for The Telegraph on Tuesday, not many hours before the start of a fresh series. Dravid was frank with a capital F. 

 The following are excerpts 

 Q- I assume youre 

 more relaxed on this trip to Nagpur than you were in October, 

 before the ODIs against Sri Lanka... Youd then just 

 been appointed full-fledged captain and there had been issues 

 leading up to that series...

 A- Im more comfortable, 

 not more relaxed... Ive captained for much longer 

 and the more you captain, the more you learn and grow into 

 the job... I know some of the boys better and, equally, 

 theyve got to know me better. 

 Has there been one match 

 or moment when you began feeling more comfortable? 

 I cant put a finger that 

 way... Its an on-going process... You keep facing 

 new challenges and, as Ive said, keep learning... 

 To be honest, its not that I wasnt comfortable 

 in October... 

 Youve recently made 

 a couple of statements vis-a-vis your relationship with 

 coach Greg Chappell. Was it because you were irritated with 

 the perception that you arent really your own man 

 (as captain)? 

 I replied to pointed questions... 

 If I wasnt asked, I wouldnt have made any comment 

 ... I dont, by the way, lose sleep over perceptions... 

 Having played this game for years, I know they arent 

 always accurate ? not only where Im concerned, but 

 regarding others as well... Without really getting to understand 

 an individual or even making the effort, people attach labels 

 such as strong, weak, passionate, soft... The difference 

 with reality can be huge. 

 But you have an image... 

 (Interrupting) I havent 

 created one... I never try to prove a point... Ive 

 reacted because youve asked a question... I dont 

 need to go around saying things. 

 What did you learn most 

 from what was a difficult tour ? Pakistan? 

 We played superbly to come back 

 in the first two Tests (Lahore, Faisalabad)... We didnt 

 play the new ball well in both innings in Karachi and, in 

 my opinion, those were the two occasions when we didnt 

 do well on the tour... In my book, we didnt make any 

 other mistake... But, yes, we lost that Test and learnt 

 a lesson... Collectively, what we learnt most is that the 

 new ball has to be played better... Also, 20 wickets need 

 to be taken... (After a pause) People must not forget 

 weve got a young attack and, to grow, the bowlers 

 need experience. 

 Frankly, after losing in 

 Karachi, did you expect to claim the ODIs 4-1? 

 I was confident we could win, 

 but I didnt think of numbers and expected to face 

 a big challenge... 

 What gave the confidence? 

 Oh, just the quality of one-day 

 cricket we played versus Sri Lanka (6-1) and South Africa 

 (2-2) at home earlier in the season... The skills wed 

 shown, the flexibility, the enthusiasm... That and more 

 gave confidence. Of course, I also knew we would struggle 

 if we played below potential. 

 Did young legs alone make 

 the biggest difference? 

 A difference... No one element 

 makes the biggest difference... Its always a combination 

 of factors... What cant be denied is the energy and 

 enthusiasm of the young legs... Having said all that, some 

 of the experienced guys also contributed... Sachin (Tendulkar) 

 had a big contribution in the early matches... Yuvraj Singh 

 was consistent throughout... 

 Your own contribution wasnt 

 insignificant either... If you werent Rahul Dravid, 

 how many marks would you have given? 

 (Laughs) I am Rahul Dravid! 

 I cant not be Rahul Dravid... Look, I dont give 

 marks to anybody ? neither to my players nor myself... I 

 look at everything from a team-perspective... The collective 

 success or... Talking of myself, Im happy at the way 

 I responded to the challenges... We were up against 679 

 in Lahore and 588 in Faisalabad, but I opened and got hundreds 

 in each of those Tests... However, I would have liked to 

 have got runs in the Karachi Test.

 That both you and Chappell 

 kept defending the bowlers in the first two Tests attracted 

 praise from Imran Khan... 

 Because of the wickets (at the 

 Gaddafi and the Iqbal Stadium), I genuinely felt they didnt 

 need to be criticised... In any case, criticism is best 

 handed out behind closed doors... And, as you know, I believe 

 anything said in the dressing room shouldnt go beyond 

 those four walls... Actually, if somebody needs to be told 

 something, its better through a one-on-one and not 

 even in front of the team. (After a pause) Dont 

 forget we not only had some young bowlers, Zak (Zaheer Khan) 

 was making his comeback... 

 Was dropping Sourav Ganguly 

 in Faisalabad the toughest decision youve had to take 

 as captain? 

 Leaving out anybody is a damn 

 tough decision... Telling people theyre not playing 

 isnt easy, more so a great player with a proven record... 

 Im learning that not everything you do as captain 

 is pleasant... It comes with the job, but I would like to 

 add the captain alone doesnt decide (on the XI)... 

 Theres the vice-captain, the coach and, now, a selector 

 even on tour... The decisions are collective and by consensus... 

 Not that all are easy, though. 

 There was a time when Sourav 

 and you were seen as being very close... Well, he has been 

 dropped again... Will there be any awkwardness when you 

 meet him the next time? 

 I hope not... I dont think 

 personal relationships change for professional reasons... 

 At the end of the day, cricket is just a sport... Sourav 

 and I have been around for a number of years and it depends 

 how professional one is in handling such situations... Touch 

 wood, so far, there hasnt been any real awkwardness 

 between us... In fact, I also havent felt any awkwardness 

 with either Anil (Kumble) or (V.V.S.) Laxman, both of whom 

 havent been playing ODIs... To repeat, all decisions 

 arent easy, but one has to accept them and move on. 

 Man-management is a big 

 component of captaincy. Given your fondness for reading, 

 have you picked up something from any book?

 (Grins) Greg and (biomechanist) 

 Ian Fraser have given some books... One also gains a lot 

 through experience and talking to people, particularly former 

 captains... Not only through books on leadership or management... 

 At least, theres no book which I would call the Bible? 

 Im the type who reacts to situations. 

 Whats your style of 

 captaincy?

 Hmm... Dont know... Its 

 a tough question... I havent set out to carve a particular 

 style... The Media likes to categorise, but I dont 

 have a mantra for leadership... I be my own self and try 

 and do my best... If it answers your question, I remain 

 Rahul Dravid. 

 As captain, youve 

 often emphasised on fresh challenges... How 

 do you sell that in the dressing room? 

 Not hard at all... The right kind 

 of people are always going to look for challenges... Players 

 want to be challenged and if you dont offer fresh 

 challenges, youll never know how good they really 

 are... A great bowler brings the best out of a batsman... 

 He challenges him to raise the bar... Cricket, for me, is 

 getting the best out of myself ? not comparing my game or 

 my average with either A or B. Great challenges are, simply, 

 great challenges and theres nothing more satisfying 

 than competing with the best. I want my players to constantly 

 raise the bar, not look for safe options. 

 What, for you, is the biggest 

 challenge?

 (Laughs again) Trying to 

 put my kid (Samit) to sleep!

 Lastly, youre on the 

 verge of completing a decade of international cricket... 

 Any special thoughts?

 Thanks for reminding me... I need 

 to think!

Melbourne: Leander Paes got the better of Mahesh Bhupathi in the mens doubles, while Sania Mirza bowed out of the mixed doubles in the first round at the Australian Open here on Monday. 

Paes and partner Martin Damm of the Czech Republic recovered from a slow start to beat Bhupathi and Wesley Moodie of South Africa 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 and moved into the quarter finals. 

The Indo-Czech pair will now take on Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden and Max Mirnyi of Belarus in the last-eight stage. 

Sania and Wimbledon mens doubles champion Stephen Huss of Australia went down 3-6, 3-6 to Bob Bryan of the US and Vera Zvonereva of Russia. 

Meanwhile, Sanam Singh made a comfortable entry into the second round of the boys singles on Monday. 

The third-seeded Indian defeated Denmarks Rasmus Moller 6-2, 7-5 in the first round of the juniors competition to set up a match-up with Todd Ley of Australia. 

Another Indian in the fray, Jeevan Neduncheriyan, seeded sixth, put up a brave fight in a three setter before making the first round exit. 

Neduncheriyan lost to Steven Goh of Australia 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-8.

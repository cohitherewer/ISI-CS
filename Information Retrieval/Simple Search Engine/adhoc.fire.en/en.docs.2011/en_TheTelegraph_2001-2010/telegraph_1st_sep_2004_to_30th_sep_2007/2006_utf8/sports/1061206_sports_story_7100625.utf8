 India bag silver, Rathore bronze

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore on Tuesday made a tremendous comeback to win a team silver and an individual bronze medal in double trap shooting and then fired a bigger salvo outside the range when he accused the organisers of trying to scuttle his chances in the Asian Games. 

Minutes after he won the bronze medal in the individual event after a ding-dong battle with his Chinese rivals, Rathore said that he faced huge problems in negotiating the targets. 

The targets were not regular. The ones supposed to fall on 55 metres, were regularly falling on 50m from at least one position in the shooting arena, Rathore complained. I am not sure whether it was done intentionally, but it was definitely a hindrance towards good shooting. 

Asked whether it was a conspiracy to keep him out of the medal bracket, the ace shooter said he was not sure about it. But I am definitely disappointed with the way things have gone. I was almost out for the final in morning, but when I found this, I thought I will show these Qataris where exactly I stand. 

Rathore, of course, performed like a world beater in the third round of the team event, which paved the way for his entering the final. That was the time he looked like a real champion. 

In the first two rounds, Rathore shot a poor 46 and 43 and was almost out for a place in the final. In the third and the final round, however, Rathore was at his amazing best as he shot 50 out of 50 to lift India to the second position in the team event. Subsequently, the terrific show also took him to the individual final. 

Personally, it was a highly satisfactory performance from my side. I was virtually written off from the final, Rathore said. That was the time when I missed some crucial targets. Without that problem I could done even better. 

Rathore said he was not taking credit away from the two Chinese shooters, who won the gold and the silver medals. 

Both Wang Nan (189) and Hu Binyuan (187) are great shooters. I have full respect for them, said Rathore, who finished with 184 points. 

In the team event, Rathore teamed up with Ronjan Sodhi and Vikram Bhatnagar to finish with 409 points behind the Chinese trio, who had 424 points. It was a new Asian Games record.

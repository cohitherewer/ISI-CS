Mamaroneck (New York): Jeev Milkha Singh squeezed through the halfway mark despite a six-over-par 76 but Jyoti Randhawa, as also the illustrious Tiger Woods, were not as lucky and missed the cut after the second round of the 106th US Open Golf Championship here on Friday. Jeev is now tied 53rd. 

Out-of-sorts after the longest break of his career, Woods missed his first ever cut at a Major as a professional. 

Playing his first tournament in nine weeks following the death of his father, the world No. 1 struggled to a six-over-par 76 in the second round at Winged Foot Golf Club. 

Jeev is now nine-over 149 for 36 holes and ten off the lead held by American Steve Stricker (69), who was one ahead of Scotsman Colin Montgomerie (71). 

The Indian star, playing his second US Open, made it to the weekend round despite a disappointing finish with three bogeys in last four holes. 

It feels great to make the cut, said Jeev, who has been in good form of late, having won the Volvo China Open, a joint sanctioned event by Asian and European Tours. 

I was a little upset at those three bogeys towards the end. Anyway the course is playing tough and I am happy to be in the weekend rounds. 

I am putting well and that could prove crucial, added Jeev. 

It, however, turned out to be a disappointing round for Randhawa who shot a 75 to be placed tied 82nd. Randhawa struggled with the front nine when he carded five bogeys before recovering with a birdie on the 10th. He finished off the round with a bogey on the 14th hole and a total of 152. 

The 34-year-old Jeev had a nervy start to the second round when he struck back-to-back bogeys at the second and third hole holes. 

But Jeev, the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit leader, regained his ground through birdies at the fourth and fifth holes before dropping a shot at the sixth hole. He suffered a double bogey on the par-four ninth hole and turned in three-over.

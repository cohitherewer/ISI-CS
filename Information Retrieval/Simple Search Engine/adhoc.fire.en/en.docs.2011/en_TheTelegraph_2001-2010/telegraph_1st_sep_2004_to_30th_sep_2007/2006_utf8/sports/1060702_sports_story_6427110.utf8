 Brazil drop Adriano

 - Why Spanish ref?: Domenech 

Frankfurt: Defending champions Brazil dropped striker Adriano and brought in midfielder Juninho for Saturdays quarter final against France. 

Ronaldinho moved into the attack to partner Ronaldo, giving him a similar role to the one he performs with his club Barcelona. 

Juninho will play alongside Ze Roberto, Kaka and Gilberto Silva, who replaced Emerson from the team which started the second round tie against Ghana. 

France fielded an unchanged formation from the side that defeated Spain 3-1 in the second round, with Thierry Henry as lone striker backed up by a five-man midfield masterminded by veterans Zinedine Zidane and Patrick Vieira. The winners will play Portugal in the semi-finals. 

Meanwhile, picking a Spanish referee for the match was not a good idea, France coach Raymond Domenech said. 

Spaniard Luis Medina Cantalejo was selected to take charge of the game in Frankfurt, a choice Domenech contested after France defeated Spain. 

Im not questioning this referees honesty but naming him for this match puts him under a lot of pressure, said Domenech. 

He criticised the refereeing earlier in the tournament, saying France had been penalised by controversial decisions in their first two matches in the group phase. 

Saturdays match is Brazils first against France at the World Cup since losing 0-3 in the 1998 final. 

And the memories of that match will be fresh in everybodys mind. 

Thats something you never forget, Brazil defender Roberto Carlos said on Friday. But its something that doesnt bother us. On Saturday, it will come down to two very good teams trying to advance to the semi-final. 

Roberto Carlos is one of 12 players involved ? six from each team ? who participated in the 1998 tournament. The image I have of the 98 final is one of being in a dream, France defender Lilian Thuram said Thursday. I told myself Its not real, its not real. 

Im out of words to talk about that match, it left a scar, said Brazil midfielder Ze Roberto, who was a reserve eight years ago. 

Even those who were not there still talk about it. 

I was really little, but its a sad memory, 22-year-old Brazil striker Robinho said. I hope the story will be different this time. 

I dont want to demystify Brazil, Domenech said. A quarter final against Brazil is exceptional. (AGENCIES)

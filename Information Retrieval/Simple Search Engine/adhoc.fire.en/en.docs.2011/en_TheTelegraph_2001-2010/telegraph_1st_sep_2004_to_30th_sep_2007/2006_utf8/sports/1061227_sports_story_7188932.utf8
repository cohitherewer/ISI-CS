The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mixed response from Allan Donald

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Durban: South Africas legendary speed merchant, Allan Donald, has responded in a mixed manner to the Team India decision on Irfan Pathan. 

There are two ways to look at it... On the one hand, its a bold move... On the other, the message conveyed is that Pathan doesnt fit into the present scheme of things... Im not sure to what extent his confidence has been affected, Donald said. 

Speaking to The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon, he continued: Of course, its best to be bowling in competitive matches, but the state of mind is as important... Ive never come across anything similar to the decision made yesterday. 

Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, another great, concurred with Donald on the need for bowlers to regularly bowl instead of sitting idle for almost two weeks. He added: I also feel India should have a bowling coach... Most teams have one and Waqar (Younis) has definitely made a difference in Pakistan. 

Akram refrained from making a detailed comment owing to the speculation, after the ODIs, that he would work with Pathan. He did call me once, thats it... Nobody asked that I spend some time with him at nets... 

Pathan, for the record, has idolised Akram. 

Ex-West Indies quick Ian Bishop, meanwhile, felt the decision may not be a bad idea. He said: If it has been handled well, with Pathan given some kind of an assurance, then I dont have a problem... Hed been short on confidence and does need long spells... Also, you cant get your confidence back in international cricket, rather you take to it with confidence... 

The last, clearly, hasnt been heard on the Pathan affair.

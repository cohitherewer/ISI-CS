 Player of the Day

 GIANLUCA ZAMBROTTA 

 Versatile, dynamic and creative, Gianluca Zambrotta is currently one of Italys core players. His ability to play in many positions on both flanks provides great flexibility to both the defence and attack. It was best evident on Friday night when he steered his team to victory against Ukraine. Zambrotta put the Azzurris early in lead. Gathering the ball on the right, he raced down the wing and then sent it low and hard into the back of the net from just outside the box. The Juventus defender once again displayed his skills in the 69th minute. Popping up on the left, he busted the Ukraine off-side trap and slid the ball across for Luca Toni to just tap into the empty net. After starting his career as a right-sided midfielder, Zambrotta transformed himself into a full-back in Turin after he lost his place to Mauro Camoranesi. The very fact that Zambrotta remained a favourite with every coach in the national team since 1999, is the proof of his utility. While he first became a regular under Dino Zoff, neither Trapattoni nor Lippi could ignore him.

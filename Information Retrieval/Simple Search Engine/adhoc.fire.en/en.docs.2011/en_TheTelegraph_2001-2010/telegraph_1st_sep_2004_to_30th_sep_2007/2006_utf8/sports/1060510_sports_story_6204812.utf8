 Shane Warne turns on his magic

 - Vaughan is vital to Englands Test team, says leggie

Shane Warne is an irrepressible force of nature but even he had to admit defeat Monday when trying to find Bethnal Green Technical College for the launch of a new spin initiative. 

As someone who has overcome three operations to his shoulder, a drug ban, as well as countless kiss-and-tells in the tabloids, he was no match for the London rush hour traffic that caused him to be 90 minutes late. A Warne masterclass is worth the wait, though, for no spin bowler in history has matched his beguiling mixture of art, showmanship and box-office appeal. 

Naturally, it is the last of these that has lured Mitre to sign him up for a five-year equipment and footwear deal. It is also the reason Capital Kids and the Lords Taverners, two cricket-based charities, wanted him to be a role model for their Spin to Win programme, part-funded by Mitre. 

Though the dearth of home grown spinners playing County cricket has seen other spin bowler initiatives launched in the past, this one is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds mostly, though not exclusively, in Londons inner boroughs. 

Using a special spin ball developed by the Taverners (it has a pronounced seam for extra grip), spin bowling will be introduced to the Capital Kids summer courses, culminating in a days coaching for the top 100 prospects from across the country with Warne in September. 

It is an enticing prospect. Last seasons Ashes proved such a powerful unifying force that nobody wants to miss out on harnessing some of that magic. 

Of course, England have their own spinners in Ashley Giles and Monty Panesar, and either could have launched Mondays quest. Yet Warnes performance last summer transcended the parochial to the point where he was a hero, irrespective of ones allegiances. 

Id like to think that there are some young cricketers out there who want to be like me, Warne said, oblivious to the irony this may cause readers of the tabloid, the procurers of his latest lurid round of high jinks. 

Hopefully this initiative will keep them interested in spin bowling and if we produce a leggie who plays for England and does really well, thatll make me and everyone involved feel pretty proud. 

Dressed in a black shirt, with distressed jeans and the shiniest pair of winkle-picker shoes seen since Gene Vincent strutted his stuff, Warne looks more Venice Beach than the high wizard of wrist spin. But achingly hip attire does not prevent him from unveiling the mysteries of wrist-spin to the assembled throng of, mostly Asian, boys and girls. 

When he demonstrates the grip, the three-quarter size ball looks vulnerable as he clamps it into his powerful right hand. For the last 15 years, cricket balls around the world have been squeezed, exhorted and spun with such ferocity from that hand that it should look deformed. 

Instead, the only obvious flaw is the nicotine stain (he is still a smoker despite trying to quit) and the fact that his nails need a trim. 

With the ball firmly under control, he explains the different grips for leg-break, top-spinner and googly, but you can see him sense that the technical talk of wrist angles is perplexing the kids, some of whom have begun to be more intrigued by the television cameramen jostling for the best angle. 

This is the cue for a demonstration in the nets, which in his case is an effortless reproduction of the balls he has been describing, plus the flipper, the most difficult ball for a wrist-spinner to control. Click your thumb and fingers together so you squeeze the ball out like a pip, he tells them, sending down two perfectly pitched flippers after his first attempt drifts slightly wide. 

It is mesmerising stuff, even for those of us weaned on the wonder ball that spun 18 inches to bowl Mike Gatting in 1993, as well as the astounding doppelganger six years later that scuppered Herschelle Gibbs in the World Cup semi-final at Edgbaston. 

The kids did not look overly impressed, but then they are probably suffering from the Pot Black effect, or the way that snooker on telly looks a hundred times easier than it really is. 

Warnes career stats, 684 Test wickets, should add context, but they are difficult to conceive even for bowlers who played Test cricket. Until recently, talk of 1,000 Test wickets would have seen you carted off by men in white coats, but if he is serious about playing in the 2009 Ashes series, it wont be at all far-fetched. 

Provided his shoulder is fine (he admits that his surgeon may want to re-assess it before then) he will definitely be around for this winters Ashes, one of the most eagerly anticipated series ever played. 

But while he is happy to admit for the 4,000th time that Australia were beaten by the better side last summer, he feels that the series Down Under will be won by the side who suffer the fewest injuries. A veiled reference to Glenn McGraths absence for two Tests last summer, it could be more telling if England cannot take their first-choice squad. 

At the moment four leading players are hors de combat, including their captain Michael Vaughan, a man Warne feels is integral to England mounting a robust defence of the urn. 

I think Vaughan is vital to Englands Test team, Warne said. Hes a very aggressive batsman with all the shots and hes a very good captain. But at the end of the day the captain has to be worth his spot in the side, and has to perform ? this last point a dig at Vaughans moderate one-day record and the suggestion in some quarters that he should give it up to concentrate on Test cricket. 

He is even more lavish in his praise for Andrew Freddie Flintoff, Englands inspirational allrounder and Player of the Year, an award Flintoff picked up in London last night. 

Most teams rely on one player to swing the momentum for them, their go-to player. Freddie is Englands go-to player, though the things I like about him is his ability to drag the rest of the team as well as the energy and spirit with which he plays the game. 

There are a few others around the world who can do it (modesty prevents him from mentioning himself), but Freddies one of the best.

 Murali, Fernando dismiss SA

 - Murali, Fernando bag 4 each to restrict SA to 169 

 Muralidharan in action on Thursday 

Colombo: Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene scored undefeated half-centuries to give Sri Lanka the initiative after South Africa were dismissed for 169 on the first day of the opening Test here on Thursday. 

Sangakkara led the assault with 59 from 66 balls. Jayawardene provided solid support with 55 from 76 balls as the scoring rate climbed above five runs per over, pushing South Africa on to the defensive. 

The Proteas failed to capitalise after winning the toss, collapsing dramatically as wickets tumbled during the two-hour afternoon session. 

The collapse was triggered by fast bowler Dilhara Fernando and spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, who claimed four wickets apiece. 

AB de Villiers provided the only resistance with an aggressive 65 from 72 balls that included eight boundaries before he was the last man out as he tried to thrash late boundaries.

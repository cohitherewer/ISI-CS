 Hair: Racist slur hurts

Melbourne: Umpire Darrell Hair, in the centre of the ball-tampering row with Pakistan, says he has been deeply hurt by allegations that he was a racist. 

It really upsets when people describe me as a racist, because they have no idea how I spent my child- hood and how that shaped my beliefs in adult life, the Aussie said. 

Its particularly hurtful when I count as some of my closest friends the Pakistan umpires Aleem Dar and Asad Rauf, and the Sri Lankans Asoka de Silva and Peter Manuel. We are men from different cultures drawn together by cricket, Hair was quoted as saying in the Australian media on Monday. 

 Hair said he would not have acted the way he did had he not thought the spirit of the game had been violated during The Oval Test.

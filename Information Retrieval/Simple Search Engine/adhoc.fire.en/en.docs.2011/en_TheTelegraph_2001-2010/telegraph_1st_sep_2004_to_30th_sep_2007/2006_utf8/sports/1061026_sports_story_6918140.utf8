The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 You cannot experiment at the cost of the team, says Gaekwad

 - Rahul should never think of opening... He is best suited for the No. 4 spot 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

 Gaekwad feels Kaif has been a victim of constant shuffling in the batting order 

Ahmedabad: Aunshuman Gaekwad was the coach when India made their first Champions Trophy final in 2000 in Nairobi. The Telegraph spoke to the former India opener and national selector on the current team and their prospects. 

 The following are 

 excerpts

 Q How do you compare this 

 side with the one that reached the final in 2000? 

 A We definitely have a better 

 side today, one that is more balanced. I mean there are 

 more match-winners in the team Players with allround abilities 

 Batsmen who can bowl and vice versa. If you look at the 

 past record, the players have proven their capabilities. 

 If they play to potential, they can beat any team on a given 

 day. 

 What are your predictions 

 on tomorrows match? 

 As we witnessed Tuesday night, 

 the wicket has good carry and movement. To be very frank, 

 both India and the West Indies are very unpredictable. It 

 could be anybodys game and Im not ready to bet 

 on any one side. 

 You have been a known critic of Greg Chappells 

 experimentation policy. But now all teams are doing that. 

 How do you explain this? 

 Experimentation is a must in todays 

 game. I know this, but my point is simple. You cannot experiment 

 at the cost of the team. Youve got to strike a balance 

 somewhere and sacrifice the teams interests. Every 

 match, every tournament is important You cannot lose matches 

 because you are experimenting. 

 Look at Australia. They decided long back what team 

 they would be playing in the matches in Kuala Lumpur. They 

 made sure the balance was perfect. They didnt lose 

 the momentum. Thats how things should be. 

 Can you elaborate more 

 on this? 

 Were taking experimentation 

 a bit too far. We are having wrong people at the wrong places. 

 You cannot push Virender Sehwag down the order, get Rahul 

 Dravid to open the innings or have Irfan Pathan batting 

 at No. 3. You have got to realize the real potential of 

 your players. 

 How do you rate Rahul 

 Dravid as a captain when compared to Sourav Ganguly? 

 They are two different kinds. 

 Dravid isnt as explosive as Sourav, but he has been 

 doing well. Dravid has his own way of doing things and has 

 achieved success. 

 Do you agree with Ravi 

 Shastri that Dravid should have more say in selection matters 

 and team combination? 

 Im not aware of what is 

 happening, and so wouldnt like to make a comment. 

 Has Pathan been a victim 

 of experimentation? 

 Irfan should stick to his bowling. 

 If he has to concentrate on his batting, he will lose focus. 

 A bowler of his calibre should never allow that to happen. 

 If he can contribute with the bat, then it should be treated 

 as a bonus. Lets put it straight: Irfan is still not 

 an allrounder. 

 Kapil Dev never batted at No. 3 to be regarded as 

 an allrounder. He regularly got runs batting at No. 6 or 

 7. Mind you, India then didnt have so strong a lower-order 

 as it is now. You can have Mahendra Singh Dhoni promoted 

 to No.3 in emergent situations. Ideally, however, the No. 

 3 spot should be reserved for a regular batsman, one who 

 can hold the innings together and steady the ship. 

 Should the Sachin-Sehwag 

 opening combination be changed? 

 No. Rahul should never think of 

 opening. He is best suited for the No. 4 spot. He can carry 

 the innings on his shoulders from there. He handles such 

 situations very well. The No. 3 should be reserved for Yuvraj 

 Singh or Mohammed Kaif. I know Kaif hasnt been among 

 runs of late, but he, too, has been a victim of constant 

 shuffling. You cannot expect players to perform until you 

 give them a specific role. 

Look, we need to be told what is your job, unlike the Australians. Theyre mentally much stronger and tougher and may be able to take it in their stride. But we need to settle down well in our role. We need to prepare mentally before a game which, sadly, has not been happening. 

 I agree everyone needs to adapt to all situations, 

 but that will take time. Maybe another four years when the 

 next World Cup is around. 

 But do we have the ability 

 to win the World Cup? 

 Yes. Potentially we can beat Australia, 

 regarded as the best, any time. If you consider individual 

 abilities and experience of our players we are definitely 

 ahead of others. 

 I am a bit disappointed with the Champions Trophy 

 matches. True, some of the wickets have been bad, but even 

 on good tracks teams have rarely managed to score beyond 

 250.

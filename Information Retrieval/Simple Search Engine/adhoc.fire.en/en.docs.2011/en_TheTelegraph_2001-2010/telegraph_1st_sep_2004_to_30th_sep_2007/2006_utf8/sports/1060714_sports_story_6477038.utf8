Beijing: China gave a rousing welcome to athletics hero Liu Xiang on his triumphant return from Switzerland where he shattered the 110m hurdles world record. 

Congratulations! 12.88! Best wishes and happy 23rd birthday to you! Waiting for you (to shine again) in 2008! read a six-metre long banner at the Beijing airport. 

Five years ago, Lius birthday had coincided with Beijing winning the right to host the 2008 Olympic Games, in which China expect the 2004 Olympic champion to deliver another gold medal. The Chinese government and the ruling Communist party are expected to honour Liu on his new achievement and patriotic spirit. 

The previous record (12.91) was held jointly by Briton Colin Jackson and Liu himself. 

Internet chatrooms were filled with comments on the world record run, with a few netizens calling Lius arrival in Beijing as superman returns. 

Hollywood movie Superman returns premiered in Beijing on Wednesday. 

Concerned by the renewed frenzy over Liu, the Chinese media and fans have been urged not to disturb the star athlete, who is training for a repeat gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. 

The appeal was issued by the deputy head coach of the Chinese athletics team, Yu Weili, who has complained the media frenzy in. 

 A new round of frenzy is inevitable, Yu said. Because of distractions, Liu rarely has had good results in domestic competitions. There will be social activities that Liu cant refuse to attend. We hope there will be as less distraction as possible. (PTI)

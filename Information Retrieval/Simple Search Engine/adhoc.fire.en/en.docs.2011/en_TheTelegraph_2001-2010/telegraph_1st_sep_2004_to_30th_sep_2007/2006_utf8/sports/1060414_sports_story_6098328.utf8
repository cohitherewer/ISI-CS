 12 bowlers identified for illegal action

 U-19 World Cup

 Dubai: The International 

 Cricket Council (ICC) on Thursday confirmed that 12 bowlers, 

 including five from the Test playing nations, were identified 

 for remedial work on their bowling action at the recent 

 ICC U-19 World Cup.

 Those players identified 

 are not eligible for selection for any national team until 

 an assessment by their own boards bowling advisors 

 confirms either the action is legal or that, although it 

 was illegal, it has now been remedied, the ICC said 

 in a statement on Thursday.

 The ICC, however, did not name 

 the players identified.

 The actions of the players were 

 highlighted by a three-man Bowling Action Advisory Panel 

 (BAAP) during the tournament, which took place in Colombo.

 BAAP in Sri Lanka was made up 

 of former Indian pacer Jawagal Srinath, Richard Done ? the 

 ICCs high performance manager ? and biomechanist Marc 

 Portus who is a member of the ICCs panel of human 

 movement specialists.

 BAAP members attended games individually 

 and assessed bowling actions from various aspects of the 

 ground and, if an action was deemed to be suspicious by 

 a BAAP representative or match official, it was filmed wherever 

 possible.

 AIFF panel favours Air India

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Appeal Committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), which met here on Sunday to decide on the fate of the Fransa Pax-Air India match in the National Football League (NFL), has apparently given their verdict in favour of the Mumbai outfit. 

According to sources in the AIFF, which chose not to make the decision public, the committee felt that under the existing rules, Air India should be awarded a walk over. Only two of the six-member committee ? chairman Vijay Panjwani and BS Chauhan ? were present in the meeting. The vice-chairman of the committee, Alvino Valles has sent his opinion in writing, which too tilted in favour of Air India. 

Three other members ? Utpal Majumdar, RK Mishra and KNK Menon ? did not attend the meeting for various reasons. In a press release later on Sunday, the AIFF said that the chairman of the committee has passed an order which will be intimated to all other members of the committee. 

Once the concurrence is received, the decision will be communicated to all. 

On February 3, Fransa were scheduled to play Air India at Margao, but did not turn up for the match as well as the managers meeting a day earlier. Earlier, on January 30, Fransa had lost to Mahindra United at the same venue and wanted the referees decision to award two spot kicks against them to be reviewed. 

Later, Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco threatened to withdraw from the NFL unless the AIFF grants a replay of the Fransa-Air India match. The federation did bow to their wish after a series of meetings, but Air India then protested against the decision. The AIFF executive committee had then sent the matter to the appeal committee.

 Clijsters not to defend title 

Brussels: World number one Kim Clijsters will not defend her title at the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells next month after re-aggravating an ankle injury, the Belgian said on Wednesaday. 

I re-aggravated the right ankle that I injured in Australia this past week, and now require some time off to get back to 100 per cent, Clijsters, the US Open champion, said in a statement. 

It would have been nice to have defended my title in Indian Wells as it has always been one of my favourite tournaments. 

The 22-year-old Belgian was forced to retire with the same injury from her Australian Open semi-final with Amelie Mauresmo last month and returned for the first time at the Diamond Games in Antwerp last week.

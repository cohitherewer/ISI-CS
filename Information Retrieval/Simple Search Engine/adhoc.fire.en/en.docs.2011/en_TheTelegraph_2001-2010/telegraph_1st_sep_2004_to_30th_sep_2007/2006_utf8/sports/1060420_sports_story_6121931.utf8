 I wasnt informed

 - Inzamam's absence at Cup-unveiling ceremony

 Inzamam

Abu Dhabi: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq has blamed a communication gap for his controversial absence from the Cup unveiling ceremony and Match Referees meeting a day before the start of the first match against India here on Monday. 

I was not informed about it, no one told me about the programmes, Inzamam said at a press conference last night when asked about his absence. 

However, coach Bob Woolmer was on record saying that Inzamam was aware of the two important engagements scheduled on the match eve. 

He knows about it, he had been unavoidably delayed, was what Woolmer had told reporters at the unveiling ceremony. 

Pakistan Cricket Board director (operations) Saleem Altaf, who is also the Chef-de-Mission of the squad, denied there was a rift between the captain and the team management. 

If you are talking of the team management, it is me and Woolmer. As far as I know none of us has had any problem with Inzamam, Altaf said. It was communication gap. We have also explained this to Match Referee Roshan Mahanama, he said. 

 BCCI stand 

Meanwhile, the BCCI has decided not to hold organisational blunders against the Abu Dhabi Cricket Council (ADCC) when considering playing matches here in the future. 

What happened was very unfortunate. Its the first time such a thing has happened. But we have decided to give them the benefit of doubt since they were hosting an international match for the first time, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

The ADCC plans to host a tri-series meet in September-October this year and perch itself as a regular ODI venue on the international calendar.

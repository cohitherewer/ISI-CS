 Dhoni will bat up the order

Johannesburg: Striking a confident note, Indian captain Rahul Dravid Tuesday sought to rubbish the notion that his batsmen would be susceptible to hostile South African fast bowling during the 54-day tour. 

Dravid said the batsmen had scored big hundreds on previous tours to the country including the 2003 World Cup and he could not see why they could not excel one more time. 

As far as I can remember, we did very well in the 2003 World Cup where most of our batsmen made major runs. On previous tours too, we had some big hundreds, Dravid told reporters on arrival here Tuesday morning. 

Dravid backed up the robust defence of his batsmen by encapsulating the general performance of India in South Africa. 

Our batsmen have enjoyed batting on South African pitches because it affords you the ability to play shots. Of course there are a few shots you need to avoid but there is also a wider range of shots to choose from. 

Dravid arrived with the 16-member Indian squad for the gruelling tour comprising five one-dayers and three Test matches. India have never won a Test in South Africa on three previous visits and 10 Tests and only once in a one-dayer. 

Dravid said that in the absence of Yuvraj Singh, Mahendra Singh Dhoni would bat up the order in coming weeks. 

In Yuvrajs absence, someone like Dhoni, who has been batting a bit low, would get chance to bat up the order. Men such as Suresh Raina and Dinesh Mongia, as well as Mohammed Kaif, also have an excellent chance to make their presence felt. 

Dravid hoped the seniors of the side would lead the way for the rest of the team which has had pretty ordinary days on international fields in recent past. 

Seniors have been doing their bit in passing on their information to younger lads of the team. Some of them have been here on two or three previous visits. 

Top of the list in his mind was, of course, Sachin Tendulkar. 

Tendulkar is a class act who has been there for the last 16-17 years. He started off really well on a difficult wicket in Malayasia. If he fires similarly, it would be good for the team, as well as for the South African public to watch the great champion at his best. 

The Indian captain said besides the talk from seniors, a word from support staff, such as Gregory King who is from East London, would also help youngsters to rise up to expectations. 

They have had also good talk with a few in the support staff like physio and trainer who can tell what conditions to expect. We have discussed those aspects of touring South Africa. 

India coach Greg Chappell said his priority was to concentrate on one-dayers with the World Cup being round the corner. India are to play 13 ODIs sandwiched between now and the World Cup in March-April 2007.

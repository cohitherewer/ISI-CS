 Leander: Mahesh wasnt honest

 - Drama off tennis court, disaster on hockey turf 

Doha: Leander Paes on Tuesday hit out at doubles partner Mahesh Bhupathi for not playing with honesty in the Asian Games team event tie against Chinese Taipei. 

The crack Indian duo was defeated 2-6, 3-6 in 76 minutes on Monday as India lost the tie 1-2. 

I just feel that Hesh (Bhupathi) should be honest with himself, his injuries and his tennis, the 33-year-old Indian maestro said. 

I have tremendous respect for him (Bhupathi). He is a fantastic tennis player and has done a lot for the country. But at the moment, he needs to be honest with himself, Paes said. 

Paes, the captain of the Indian team, also threatened to drop Bhupathi. My job not only as a player but also as a captain is to choose the best team to win medals and unfortunately with that (Bhupathis) performance, we have to do a rethink. 

Paes said after the good show by the youngsters, their defeat came as a big disappointment. 

Indian coach Nandan Bal also felt that Bhupathi was not reaching for the ball. 

[Our Special Correspondent adds: Bhupathi, when told about Paes criticism, said: You ask why he said that. I did try my best, but it didnt work. 

Bhupathi added that he wouldnt be taking part in the mixed doubles event, in which he was due to pair up with Shikha Uberoi. 

Asked if he would be returning home, Bhupathi said: Im here to play. 

Bhupathi is scheduled to team up with Paes in mens doubles. It remains to be seen whether that materialises.]

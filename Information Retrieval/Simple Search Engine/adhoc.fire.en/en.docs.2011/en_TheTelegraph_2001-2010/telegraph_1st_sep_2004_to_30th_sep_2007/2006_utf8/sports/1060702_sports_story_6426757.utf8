 Jeev in tied ninth spot

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh gave himself a shot at another title after he played a brilliant round of three-under 67 to bring himself in contention at the UBS Japan Golf Tour Championships.

With a three round total of one-under 209, Jeev is now lying tied ninth, only four shots behind leader Tatsuhiko Takahashi (68). 

Tommy Nakajima (69) is second at four-under 206, while three players are at three-under 207 and three others at two-under.

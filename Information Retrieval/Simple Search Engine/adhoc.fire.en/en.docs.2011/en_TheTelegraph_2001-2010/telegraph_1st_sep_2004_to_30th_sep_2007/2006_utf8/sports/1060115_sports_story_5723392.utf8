 Crown for Blake 

Sydney: James Blake served notice he was looming as a major contender for next weeks Australian Open with a 6-2, 3-6, 7-6 victory over Russian Igor Andreev in the final of the Sydney International on Saturday. 

The American clawed his way back from the brink of defeat in scorching on-court temperatures to capture his fourth career title. 

Andreev looked to have victory sewn up when he served for the match at 5-4 in the third set but Blake broke back and won the deciding tie-break to join his hero Arthur Ashe as the only African-Americans to win the tournament that dates back to 1885. 

I am definitely flattered and humbled any time I can put my name in the same sentence as Arthur Ashe, Blake said. He is a role model for more than just tennis players... Im very proud of that. 

Andreev was left to rue his missed opportunity but said Blake had been too good for him when it mattered.

 Sriram splits point with Afzal

Hyderabad: IM Sriram Jha was held by little known Kazi Afzal of Bangladesh in the first round of the ONGC Cup International Grandmasters Open Chess tournament on Sunday. 

On the other boards, seeded players lived up to their reputation in the Rs 8.2 lakh prize money event. 

Top seed Surya Sekhar Ganguly outplayed compatriot Meghan Gupte in the Sicilian Nazdorf defence while women GM Dronavalli Harika and P.D.S Girinath had a flying start posting comfortable wins against their respective rivals. 

Former national B champion Sriram Jha was clearly taken aback by the tenacity of his opponent. 

Despite the Indians advantage in the end game, Afzal responded well by playing a comparatively fast game, even while shoring up the defence with the right moves to hold on to a draw.The other big guns of Indian chess, including Dibyendu Barua, Pravin Thipsay, R.B. Ramesh and WGM S. Vijayalakshmi, got off to a winning start.

Calcutta: A goalless passage to the semi-finals should not be the ideal way of announcing a teams authority. So, Mohun Bagan are facing the urgency for making their case with a mastery of the situation. 

The goalless ties against Mohammedan Sporting and Shenzen FC in the group stage showed that the green-and-maroon brigade has been far from being their best. Their performances so far bordered on the patchy, if not pitying, and any slip-ups couldve been disastrous for them. 

Come Wednesday, its another day and another battle for the Jose Ramirez Barretos since a place in the final is at stake. Their immediate hurdle in the form of Sporting Clube de Goa is by no stretch of imagination a pushover. In fact, if one goes by form in the current season, Mohun Bagan will start the first of back-to-back semi-finals at the Salt Lake Stadium as underdogs. 

The interim coach-cum-Brazilian physio Robson admitted on the match-eve that theres a lot to be desired in every department of the game. We are still in the building process. But tomorrow provides a good opportunity for all the players and it remains to be seen how they seize it, Robson, who took charge following Biswajit Bhattacharyas resignation after the Durand Cup debacle, said on Tuesday. 

A significant dose of Mohun Bagans success depends on how the Barreto-Bhaichung Bhutia combination performs against the Goan outfit. This tournament has marked the reunion of the duo in the Mohun Bagan colours, but their show against the Chinese rivals was a clear indication that more times would be needed to make them gel as a cohesive unit. 

Barreto, wearing the captains armband, echoed the same feeling. Its not just the question of Bhaichung and myself, but we as a team need time to improve. We understand the urgency and well click as a team sooner than expected, Barreto, the blue-eyed boy of the fans, promised. 

Sporting coach Clifford Chukwuma, surprisingly, has a similar problem to deal with. Even though Robson has termed the Goan team as currently the best in India, Chukwuma feels his team is also in preparation mode. Like Barreto and Bhaichung, our own combination of Dudu Omagbemi and Ernest Jeremiah is yet to get into the groove. But we are hopeful of making it to the final, the Nigerian said. 

Robson didnt wish to let his first XI be known as he put Bhaichung and Barreto in the wing-back positions during the practice session. But indications are both will start with Dipendu Biswas coming later in the match. 

We are now in the knock-out stage and are professional enough to understand the urgency of putting up a better show, Barreto maintained. This is a clarion call to come to terms with the reality from the so-called development phase. 

A man known for keeping his words, Barretos assertion could well be a premonition for Sporting. 

Like Mohun Bagan and Sporting, Mahindra United too are taking the IFA Shield as a platform for regrouping themselves before the Federation Cup and National Football League. Thanks to the national duty, most of their key players like N.S. Manju, N.P. Pradeep, S. Venkatesh and Surkumar Singh, have missed long-term sessions with other members under coach Derick Pereira. 

The former India defender, however, sounded confident that his team would be able to overcome the Shenzen challenge. Our primary objective was to qualify for the semi-finals. Once that goal was achieved, we are confident to reach the final as well, he said. 

Shenzen manager Zhang Jun watched Mahindras 1-1 draw with East Bengal on Monday. They are a good team some of the players have good speed also. There is no question of taking them lightly, he pointed out.

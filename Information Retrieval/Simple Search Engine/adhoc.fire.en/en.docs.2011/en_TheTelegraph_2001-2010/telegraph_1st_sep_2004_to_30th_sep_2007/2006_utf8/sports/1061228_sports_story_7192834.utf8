The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sreesanth should not get too far ahead of himself

 - A TELEGRAPH EXCLUSIVE

 Donald speaks on Indian quicks 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Allan Donald 

Durban: If theres one quick of recent times who needs no introduction, its Allan Donald who served South Africa (and cricket itself) with distinction from 1991 to 2003 330 wickets in Tests and 272 in ODIs. On Wednesday, the fastest of his generation, now 40, spoke to The Telegraph almost exclusively on Team Indias new ball bowlers. 

Following are excerpts 

On whether, being a South African, he regrets interacting with Sreesanth at the Wanderers 

(Laughs) No, no... Im not going to chase anybody away... Its not about nationalities... Of course, its strange that I was credited with having helped South Africa lose! 

On their interaction before the start of Day II 

We discussed about what I believe is the perfect preparation and the need to think like a Test cricketer... To put his mind into the batsmans mind... The visualisation doesnt begin on the eve of a match but two-three days before... A bowler, for example, has to visualise conditions and look at the strengths and weaknesses of batsmen... Mentally, youve got to be absolutely clear about what to expect and what you should be doing. I told Sreesanth he cant just turn up and rely on skills to get the job done... I also spoke to him a bit about the length which had to be bowled at the Wanderers. 

On the perfect preparation 

When at nets, youve got to put yourself in a match environment... If you open the attack, then you must go through the same motions... And, at the end of the session, youve got to walk away convinced youve done your best... That you bowled the way you would in a match... The greatest players, batsmen and bowlers, prepare that way... Steve Waugh was one. 

On what should be a quick bowlers approach as he prepares to bowl the first ball 

He must not look at the larger picture, instead visualise the ball hitting the keepers gloves... A young guy like Sreesanth should enjoy himself. 

On Sreesanth winning the MoM award at the Wanderers 

Hats off to him... Im pleased I could inspire somebody... Glad that I could make an impact with a few words. The good thing is that Sreesanth had heard much of what Id said from (coach) Greg Chappell and Dennis Lillee... In fact, the next day, Chappell thanked me for reinforcing what theyd been telling him. (After a pause) The South Africans turned up a bit arrogant, hoping to quickly repeat the one-day result. Test cricket is different. 

On whether its difficult to quickly match such a high 

The great bowlers try to improve... Its how you take the confidence forward... However, conditions may not be the same and re-focusing can become necessary. Sreesanth bowled well in the first innings here. There were a couple of bad deliveries on the first day, but that happens... His big test will be in the second innings if India are in a position where South Africa must be bowled out. Sreesanth, though, shouldnt get too far ahead of himself... He has the skills to take five wickets on flat pitches, but must not imagine hes a Glenn McGrath. 

On his advice for Sreesanth at this point in time 

Forget the bigger picture and take it match by match... Also, I know hes emotional, but should not go overboard... We wouldnt want him banned for a Test or whatever. Often, one look says 1,000 stories, so Sreesanth has to be careful. Whatever happens (after a delivery), he must turn back and walk away. He needs to hold back the reins a bit... Im confident hes going to learn. 

On whether Sreesanth thanked him 

(Laughs again) He did, this morning... 

On the first time he saw Sreesanth 

On the TV, during Indias tour of the West Indies (May-July this year)... I saw he had the attributes of a fast bowler. He has a nice, uncomplicated action and there isnt much that could go wrong... He doesnt have raw pace, but holds the seam beautifully and swings effectively. 

On Zaheer Khan, the senior-most Indian new ball bowler 

He has gained by playing County cricket (for Worcestershire)... His channels have tightened and the lengths have improved... Hes the perfect foil for Sreesanth. 

On Vikram Rajvir Singh 

His advantage is that hes young and bowls a lot quicker than it seems... Give him time to carry forward this process of learning. 

On whats wrong with Irfan Pathan, who leaves for home on Thursday 

I havent seen much of him, but didnt find anything terribly wrong... Obviously, hes suffering from a lack of confidence. 

On the Indian attack in previous face-offs with South Africa 

Youve had good bowlers... Kapil Dev, Manoj Prabhakar, Jawagal Srinath... The present one is definitely one of the best. The quicks on this tour have adapted very well to the conditions. 

On what should be the visiting new ball bowlers approach in South Africa 

The right length must be struck... Its important to bowl that bit fuller and not get carried away by the bounce. 

Finally, on South Africas most promising fast bowler 

Morne Morkel, the debutant at Kingsmead.

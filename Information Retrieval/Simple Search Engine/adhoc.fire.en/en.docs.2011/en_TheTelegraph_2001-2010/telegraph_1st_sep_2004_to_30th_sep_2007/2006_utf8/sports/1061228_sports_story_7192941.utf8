 Hayden, Symonds smash hundreds

Melbourne: Belligerent centuries by Matthew Hayden and Andrew Symonds crushed Englands hopes of making a fight of the fourth Ashes Test with Australia well on the road to taking a 4-0 series lead at the Melbourne Cricket Ground at the end of Day Two. 

Australia, in trouble at 84 for five chasing Englands modest first-innings total of 159, rebounded ferociously with the two Queenslanders pounding the tourists bowlers in a demoralising 279-run sixth-wicket partnership. 

At close on Wednesday, Australia had surged to a commanding 213-run lead at 372 for seven. Symonds was unconquered on 154 in 316 minutes and Shane Warne was on four. 

Hayden was finally out nearing stumps for 153, compiled in seven hours off 265 balls with 13 boundaries and two sixes. He was caught-behind off Sajid Mahmood. 

Hayden hit his 27th to join Allan Border as Australias fourth-highest century-maker, while Symonds released demons of an unfulfilled Test career. 

Hayden claimed his first century of the series and continued his fondness for the MCG, scoring his fifth century in eight Tests at the ground. 

Only Ricky Ponting (33), Steve Waugh (32) and Don Bradman (29) have scored more Test centuries than Hayden in Australian cricket.

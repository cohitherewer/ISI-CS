 Melbourne: If cricket is 

 not a part of the 18th Commonwealth Games, what is Sir Viv 

 Richards doing in Melbourne?

 I am an ambassador for sports 

 for my country. I have come here to cheer and encourage 

 my country, said the legendary West Indian batsman.

 Antigua always has the toughest 

 competition with Barbados, he said. I also have 

 a lot of friends in Australia and it gives me a good reason 

 to meet them.

 Richards, who was the manager 

 for the Kuala Lumpur Games in 1998, said he was looking 

 forward to visiting New Delhi for the 2010 Commonwealth 

 Games.

 I would like to visit New 

 Delhi in 2010. I hope the organisers invite me for the Games. 

 It would be a great chance to revive my contacts and friendships 

 in India, he said.

 On the upcoming series in the 

 West Indies (starting mid-May), he said India would start 

 as the favourites.

 Presently they (West Indies) 

 are not playing well, but that is not a cause of worry. 

 Our boys are preparing well for the World Cup.

 As far as Indias visit 

 to the West Indies is concerned, it is going to be a very 

 interesting duel. Though India would start favourites, our 

 boys should give them a tough fight, he said.

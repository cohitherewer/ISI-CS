1-shot lead for Jeev Milkha

Japan Tour

 Jeev Milkha Singh 

Tokyo: Jeev Milkha Singh flew on the wings 

of two eagles and five birdies to reach the top of the leaderboard in the Yomiuri 

Memorial tournament here on the Japan Golf Tour.

Jeev fired a seven-under 65 following his bogey-free 

six-under 66 on first day to lead by one shot at midway stage despite a last hole 

bogey.

It put him on road to his first Japan Tour title and 

that comes in the week after his winning the Volvo Masters of Europe in Valderrama. 

Jeev has won titles on Asian and European Tour but none in Japan.

The Indian had eagles on 10th, his first hole of the 

day, and 17th, the second last. He birdied four in a row from 14th to 17th and 

added one more on third. His bogeys came on fourth and ninth. He now has three 

eagles in two rounds.

Tetsuji Hiratsula is second at 12-under with 67 and 

65, while Koreas Ik Je-chang, the joint first round leader is third at 11-under.

Jeev started the event with a brilliant six-under 

66 that had him joint lead. He enjoyed a blemish-free card with four birdies and 

an eagle.

Jeev is aiming to become the first Indian to qualify 

for the US Masters.

The 34-year-old is now at a career-best 77th place 

in the world rankings. A top 50 place would give him automatic entry to the opening 

major of the year.

It hasnt set in yet, he told the 

Asian tour Web site on Friday. Its certainly a dream come true, to 

win one of the biggest events of the year in Europe. A goal of mine now 

will be to get into the top 50 in the world which will also earn me an invite 

to the US Masters. (PTI)

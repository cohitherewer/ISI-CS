Shanghai: Leander Paes and Martin Damms campaign in the ATP Masters Cup started on a wrong note as they suffered loss in the opening group match in Shanghai on Sunday. 

The Indo-Czech pair, which won the US Open crown in September went down 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 3-6 against Australian Paul Hanley and Zimbabwes Kevin Ullyett in the Red Group tie in two hours and 10 minutes. 

Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel shocked Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, of the US 7-6 (7-2), 3-6, 6-1 another Red Group match. 

In singles play, Roger Federer outfoxed defending champion David Nalbandian 3-6, 6-1, 6-1 in his opening match on Sunday, avenging his loss to the Argentine in last years final. 

American Andy Roddick, serving 20 aces, beat an error-prone Ivan Ljubicic 6-4, 6-7, 6-1 to win the days other clash after failing to capitalise on two match points in the second-set tie-break. 

I had to make him hit some errors he wasnt doing that at the beginning, Federer said. 

A couple of years ago I wouldnt have known what to do, he said, adding that experience had taught him how to handle an incredibly good baseliner like Nalbandian. 

The Swiss player won seven of his eight points at the net but Nalbandian, frequently at full stretch, won just eight of 16. 

Nalbandian blamed a weak first serve for his loss but said of Federer: He has all the shots. I mean, he can make any shot from anywhere. 

Roddicks big serve helped him against Ljubicic but it was the Croatians mistakes that were the decisive factor -- Ljubicic sprayed groundstrokes past the baseline, making 35 unforced errors compared to Roddicks 22. 

The Croat said afterwards he felt slow and weak after not practicing for three weeks because of an allergy.

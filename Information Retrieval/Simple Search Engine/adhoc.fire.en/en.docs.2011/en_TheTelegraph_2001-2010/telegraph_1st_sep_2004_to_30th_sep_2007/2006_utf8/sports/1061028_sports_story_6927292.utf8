 Lara: Need to keep winning formula intact 

 - Andrew Flintoff hints hell bowl today 

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR

 Ahmedabad: The mere presence of the legendary Clive Lloyd is an education to the West Indies team. Its not that the former captain has restricted his role to that of a teacher, who goes on telling his students about the old values and tradition of the West Indian cricket. Instead, he speaks his mind at team meetings, is actively involved with the players during nets, constantly reminding them of the present needs. 

Both Brian Lara and Bennett King have acknowledged his contribution. Having already qualified for the Champions Trophy semi-finals, the West Indies will look to keep the momentum going. Lloyds experience could come in handy as complacency may creep into the players minds following back-to-back thumping victories over Australia and India. 

What we need to do is keep the winning formula intact, stressed Lara. The good news is that Corey Collymore will be back More than experimenting with the team, we want to finish off the group stage with a win. 

Lara, who played against India despite not being fully fit, will again assess his condition on the day of the match. There is still 24 hours left If I feel good, well field the best XI, he added. 

Lara, though, is the one England are fearing the most. He is up there with the greats like Sachin Tendulkar and Steve Waugh. He has done some special things. Because of him, we have been at the receiving end on two occasions (375 and 400 not out in Tests versus England). He is someone we respect, Andrew Flintoff said. 

The good thing about this West Indies side has been the consistent performance of the juniors. Be it Jerome Taylor, Runako Morton or Ian Bradshaw, they have not disappointed at crucial times. Because of their consistency, the unpredictability tag, so far associated with the team, appears a thing of the past. 

Pride is what England will be playing for. As Flintoff said: We wish to finish off with a victory. We want to win a game in India. I know we are through with the tournament and will be returning, but want to put up a good show. 

We will play for pride. We are taking this match as an important game in our development process. 

Flintoff indicated he might bowl a few overs in the match. Thats a possibility, he said. I have been bowling at the nets for the past couple of weeks or so and the ankle has responded well. If there are no complications tomorrow, I will bowl I, though, have no intentions of bowling my full quota under any circumstances.

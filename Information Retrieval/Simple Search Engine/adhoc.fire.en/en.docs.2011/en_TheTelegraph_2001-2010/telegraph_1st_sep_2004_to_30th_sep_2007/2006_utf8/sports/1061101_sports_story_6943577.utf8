Kuala Lumpur: The Asian Tour has hailed title wins by Jeev Milkha Singh and Choi Kyung-ju in Europe and the United States, respectively, as significant milestones for golf in the region. 

Jeev claimed an impressive one-shot triumph against the European Tours elite in the season-ending Volvo Masters in Spain. 

Across the Atlantic, Choi Koreas most famous golf export bagged his fourth career title on the USPGA Tour coasting to a comfortable four-shot victory in the Chrysler Championship. 

This is the first time that Asians have won on the same weekend in two of the worlds leading circuits and Asian Tour chairman Kyi Hla Han said the terrific feats have reinforced the belief that Asian golf is making a giant leap forward. 

The wonderful performances by Jeev and Choi over the weekend reflect positively on the Asian Tour and the growing standard of play amongst our players. Their triumphs will inspire Asians aim for higher goals, including winning the Majors, said Han. 

Over the past few years, our talented members have regularly claimed victories in co-sanctioned events with the European Tour in Asia but to see Jeev winning on European soil against a world-class field is a ground-breaking achievement. 

It is also fulfilling to see Choi lift another title. He cut his professional teeth on the Asian Tour during the 1990s and has now shown once again that Asians have the talent to win in America. 

I have no doubt that his and Jeevs success will pave the way for more Asians to make their mark on the world stage, added Han. 

Jeev can certainly sweeten his season even further by wrapping up the Asian Tours UBS Order of Merit title in the course of two remaining events the Hong Kong Open and the Volvo Masters of Asia in Bangkok. 

He presently leads the Order of Merit with $470,108, with Thai Prom Meesawat in second place ($351,871). 

The son of famous Olympic athlete Milkha Singh, Jeev returned to the winners enclosure in April after a lapse of seven years when he won the co-sanctioned Volvo China Open in Beijing and has subsequently strung together a stunning run of form which includes 13 top-10s on the Asian, Japan and European Tours. 

Chois success ensured a top-30 finish on the USPGA Tour money list which comes with an invitation to the US Masters next April, the years first major. He finished third at the 2004 Masters. Han believes the Korean will savour another return to the Augusta National Golf Club. 

Hes shown a great liking for the Masters and weve every reason to believe that Choi can go on to lift a major in the very near future, said Han.

 Border returns as selector

Sydney: Allan Border was on Friday appointed as the fourth member of the national selection panel, officials said. Border, who served as a selector from 1998 to 2005, will join Andrew Hilditch and David Boon and Merv Hughes on the panel, Cricket Australia said. 

I have always loved working as a selector and only stood down because of other time constraints, the Australia batsman said. Circumstances have now changed and I am very happy to once again make myself available. (AFP)

Calcutta/Mumbai: Former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Saturday disputed treasurer N. Srinivasans comments at a press conference that CAB joint secretary Saradindu Pal had said at the working committee meeting that Dalmiya no more functioned as the affiliate units president. 

Pal said that Dalmiya no longer functions as its president and an emergency meeting has been convened on Wednesday to take steps to implement the BCCIs decision, Srinivasan said. 

The BCCI had expelled Dalmiya at its special general meeting in Jaipur. 

Reacting to the BCCIs claims, Dalmiya said he continued to be the CAB president. 

I will see to it that CAB does not suffer because of me. If at any moment, I feel that CAB is suffering, I will not hesitate to resign But at this moment, I continue to be the CAB president, Dalmiya said. 

As per information with me, Pal only said that weve convened a working committee meeting on Wednesday, and the association will abide by its decision. 

He (Pal) also said CAB will not finance any court case which I may file against the SGMs decision to expel me. I will fight it on my own, he added. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI ruled out participation in the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi citing a packed schedule under the ICCs Future Tours Programme (FTP). 

The working committee also formed a sub-committee to deal with players contract, but there was no discussion on nominating chief Sharad Pawar as the consensus candidate for the post of ICC president. 

The working committee discussed the invitation to take part in the 2010 Commonwealth Games and felt that the FTP, as it stands now, is too crowded and would not lend itself to participate in the Games, Srinivasan said after the meeting. 

On the issue of players contract, Srinivasan said a committee had been formed comprising himself, I.S. Bindra, Shashank Manohar, secretary Niranjan Shah and chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty to finalise the details. 

At this moment I cant say what the parameters will be, but we will try to find the right balance. The board members were concerned with the performance of the team and felt that players should be motivated to do well, Srinivasan said.

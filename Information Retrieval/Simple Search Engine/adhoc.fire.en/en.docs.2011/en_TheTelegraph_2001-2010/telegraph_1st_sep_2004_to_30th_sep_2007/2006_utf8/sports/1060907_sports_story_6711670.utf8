 ICC: Forensic test of ball a possibility 

 - The Oval fiasco 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Chief executive Malcolm Speed said on Wednesday that the International Cricket Council (ICC) could go to the extent of ordering a forensic test of the ball which was used during the ill-fated Pakistan-England Test at The Oval. 

Speaking during the announcement of nominations for the Hyundai ICC awards, Speed said that the date for the hearing for Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq will only be finalised on Thursday. There is a possibility that the hearing would be held in the last week of September, but a final decision will be taken tomorrow, he said. 

Asked about the forensic test, the Speed said: There has been suggestions like that in some quarters and it could be a part of the evidence during the hearing. The laws of cricket are clear on what constitutes changing the condition of the ball. Lawyers of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the ICC are studying what evidence can be put forth. 

Speed said that cricket has been going through a difficult time at the moment, but expressed confidence that the dust would settle down very soon. Thats primarily the reason why we asked the PCB not to air their views in public. We were trying to bring in relative peace. For that it was necessary to issue the directive to the PCB, Speed said. 

Asked about suggestions that the power of forfeiting a match be taken away from on-field umpires, Speed said the ICC could only consider such a proposal if it came through its cricket committee.

 United out

London: Holders Manchester United were dumped out of the English League Cup on Tuesday when they lost 0-1 to second division bottom side Southend United in the fourth round. 

Celebrations for Alex Fergusons 20 years in charge of the Premier League leaders were quickly forgotten when Southends leading scorer Freddy Eastwood, tracked by several top-flight clubs, curled in a 30-metre free-kick on 27 minutes. 

I am a Man United fan. We didnt think we were going to beat them... but Cup games are hard and they have found that out tonight, Eastwood said.

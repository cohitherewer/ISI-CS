 Bold Faith set to win again 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: S. Ganapathy-trained Bold Faith, who scored a facile end-to-end victory over Le Reve last time out in the lower class, is strongly fancied to lift the Patrons Cup, a race for horses in upper classes here on Thursday. The Placerville-Maevella three-year-old filly is maintaining her brilliant form and may strike it rich in the hands of jockey B. Prakash.

 Usha: Pinki a medal prospect

New Delhi: Sprint Queen P. T. Usha feels that Bengals Pinki Pramanik is a surefire medal prospect in the Doha Asian Games. 

While regretting that the performance of the athletes was not of a very high standard, the ace sprinter hoped that they would fare better in Doha. 

At present, we are not up to the mark. I am not happy with the last trials (for the Asian Games). Lets see what happens in the next trials, she said. 

Usha, however, believed that the top Indian women athletes would return to their best form to get medals in Doha. 

Pinki is a cent per cent medal hope. People like Soma Biswas and JJ Sobha who are far behind their best should repeat their feats to win medals, Usha said. 

Expressing concern over the increased cases of doping among Indian athletes, Usha said a more effective dope control system should be adopted to save the country from blushes at international meets.

 McClaren set to be named manager on Friday

 HENRY WINTER 

 McClaren lacks personal authority and experience 

It will all end in tears. Steve McClaren, who should be confirmed as England manager on Friday, is an engaging character, and a terrific coach, but he lacks the personal authority and experience to lead the Three Lions. Even his captain at Middlesbrough, Gareth Southgate, believes McClaren is not ready. 

McClaren will always be perceived as the No. 2 to Sven-Goran Eriksson, formerly No. 2 to Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United, and patently No. 2 choice for the Impossible Job behind Luiz Felipe Scolari, who so humiliated the Football Association last week. England have settled for second best. 

One instinctively wishes a likeable patriot well, and this sceptic left a good-luck message on McClarens mobile on Friday, but a skip-load of concerns remain ? concerns that the FA have swept under the Soho Square carpet in their embarrassment over the failed Scolari flirtation. 

The image endures of a chief executive, Brian Barwick, returning to Blighty spurned by a fickle Brazilian and rushing gratefully into the arms of an eager local. Even the suspiciously timed revelation about McClarens extra-marital affair on Saturday morning smacked of burying bad news at a busy time. 

McClarens private life is a matter between him and his wife, yet inevitably ? in these celebrity-obsessed times ? it was always going to be an issue for one end of Fleet Street. The word from the Soho Square spin machine is that McClaren has shown his temperament this week in fronting up to the story. And he has promised that no more skeletons lurk in his cupboard. 

Yet the medias prurient interest in one mans personal life masks the issues that should be analysed. McClarens credentials as a husband are irrelevant; it is his ability as a manager that need judging. The gut feeling remains that the individual England need most from the Riverside now is Stewart Downing, not McClaren. 

The Yorkshireman fits the FA blueprint of a home-grown coach who can groom a home-grown successor. So expect Peter Taylor, Stuart Pearce and, eventually, Alan Shearer, to appear at England training sessions. Yet the FA miss the point; they are not supposed to be appointing a technical director charged with developing young English coaches, but a national team manager whose job is to win meets. 

If the England managers job was to nurture coaches, then one is at a loss to understand the job spec of Sir Trevor Brooking, the FAs director of football development. The one thing Soho Square got right with Scolari is that they were keen to appoint an outstanding manager focused on ending 40-plus years of hurt. 

International dugouts are no place for the callow. So, instead of appointing the loose cannon Scolari or seasoned operators like Martin Neill or Guus Hiddink, the FA are close to unveiling a man whose only honour is the 2004 League Cup. 

Victory in the Uefa Cup final in Eindhoven will lend some gravitas to McClarens image. Otherwise, he will resemble a No. 2 promoted in an emergency. Popular among England players, does McClaren possess the toughness to become the bad cop after so long as the good cop in the England dressing room? 

His involvement at the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 has never fully been clarified. Did he try to dissuade Eriksson from some controversial substitutions, like Darius Vassell when Wayne Rooney was injured at the Stadium of Light? Why did he not react when Englands defence sat too deep? Too many questions cling to Steve McClaren.

Calcutta: It was a dull Thursday. The sun barely peeped through and the light went from bad to worse. Football at the Barasat stadium was, however, duller and even depressing. The only saving grace was Man-of-the-Match Mike Okoros brace, which saw Mohammedan Sporting trudge past Chirag United 2-0 in their CFL Premier Division clash. 

Right from the kick-off till the final whistle, the match was an exercise in mediocrity. The black-and-white brigade seemed hardly interested and Chirag United took defeat for granted. Add to this a pitch hardly fit for football, and you get a sure recipe for driving fans away. 

It was not until the 22nd minute that Mohammedan Sporting got their first clear look at goal. Rajiv Ahmed, who took a lot of workload, picked up an Okoro backheel and floated in a centre. The ball fell near Jamir Mondal, who took a low right-footer which was cleared from the goalline by Madhusudhan Majumdar. Okoro, bottled up by two defenders, tried his best to break the shackles by dropping down. A clever touch here and a little nudge there showed his class. 

 In the 36th minute, the Nigerian did what he does best. Bijen Singhs low free-kick inside the box wasnt extraordinary. But Okoros neat little push was. It is another matter that his markers were nowhere to be seen. 

If one thought that the goal would liven up proceedings, it only served to make the game even slower. After the lemon break, inexplicably, Chirag United started behaving as if they were in front, showing no effort to make any move. Instead of taking advantage of the situation, Mohammedan Sporting, too, followed suit and the meandering game soon became unbearable to watch. Just when it seemed everybody would only be too happy to go home, came the second goal in the 68th minute. 

Bijen, who was trying hard by switching flanks, sent an accurate through pass to Okoro in the box. The entire Chirag United defence stood stock-still, thinking it was an off-side. It wasnt and Okoro gleefully sent the ball home with a left-footer. The action took place almost in slow motion and took some time even for the crowd to realise that it was indeed 2-0.

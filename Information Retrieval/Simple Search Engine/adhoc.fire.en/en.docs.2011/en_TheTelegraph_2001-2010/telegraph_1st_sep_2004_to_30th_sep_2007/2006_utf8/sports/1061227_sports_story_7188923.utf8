Calcutta: When Rohan Gavaskar came into bat at No. 7 usually he plays No. 4 or 5 braving his throat infection and fever at the Eden Tuesday, the situation was not new for the Bengal batsman. 

From the opening stand of 78 from Arindam Das and Amitava Chakraborty the hosts lost five wickets with another 107 addition, to end the day at a shaky 199 for five, still 17-run shy of their first innings lead. 

Having experienced a bitter lesson against Gujarat, Bengal cant take the 17 runs for granted something which may give a sleepless night to the unbeaten duo Deep Dasgupta and Rohan. 

The run rate suddenly stepped up no sooner than Rohan joined Deep at 171. Their 5.3 overs association, by the way, fetched Bengal 28 with Rohan stepping up the ante, producing some scintillating cover drives. In fact, he started off with a typical cover drive to open his account. 

Deep, however, shrugged off last matchs memories and tried to keep himself in a positive frame of mind. The first half will be crucial. But last matchs memories wont affect us he told The Telegraph. 

Early into the first session, Ranadeb Bose was three times unlucky when Arnidam and Amitava at the slips let off catches. However, it did not stop him from taking yet another five-wicket haul. Finishing with five for 60, having run through the tail, this was Ranadebs second five-wicket haul this season from four matches in total, he has 11 five-wicket hauls in Ranji Trophy. He has thus pocketed 21 wickets so far this season. 

Meanwhile, Sourav, who made a dream debut with four wickets Monday, could not reach the magical five-figure mark, going wicketless from his seven overs at the other end.

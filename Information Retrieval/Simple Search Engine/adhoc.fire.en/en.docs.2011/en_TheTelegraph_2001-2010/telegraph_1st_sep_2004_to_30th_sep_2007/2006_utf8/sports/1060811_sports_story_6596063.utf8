 Goan club signs Effiong

 - Player of Indian Origin

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: Goas Churchill Brothers became the first club to sign a player of Indian origin under the new AIFF rules. 

According to Churchill manager Danzie Ferrao, the club has signed James Effiong, a Nigerian national who has his roots in Bangalore as their player of Indian origin for the Goa Professional League, starting August 15. 

While James father is a Nigerian, his mother hails from Bangalore. Churchill Brothers officials first saw him in Bangalore where he was playing for CIL as a foreign player and were impressed. 

He is stylish and quick on his feet. He has an excellent first touch too, Ferrao said. 

Incidentally, it was Churchill boss Churchill Alemao who first mooted the idea that a foreign player with Person of Indian Origin (PIO) status should be allowed play club football and wrote a letter to the AIFF. The idea was approved in the last executive committee meeting of the federation. 

Earlier, AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco clarified that anyone with a PIO (Person of Indian Origin) card is eligible for club duty. 

The player must have a PIO card issued by the government, Colaco said. 

The governments PIO card allows visa-free entry to people of Indian origin residing abroad and gives them all rights enjoyed by Non Resident Indians.

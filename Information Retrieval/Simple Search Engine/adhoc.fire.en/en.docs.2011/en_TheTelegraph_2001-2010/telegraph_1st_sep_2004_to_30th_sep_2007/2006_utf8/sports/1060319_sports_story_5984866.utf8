 Fleming puts NZ in box seat

Wellington: Captain Stephen Fleming and Peter Fulton stitched a 165-run partnership to put New Zealand firmly in control of the second Test against the West Indies at the end of Day II on Saturday. 

New Zealand were 335 for seven at close, a lead of 143 runs after they bowled the visitors out for 192 early in the first session at the Basin Reserve. 

Fleming was caught on the backward point boundary by Dwayne Bravo for 97, missing out on a ninth Test century, while Fulton, playing just his second Test, made 75. 

Nathan Astle was batting on 65, after combining with Daniel Vettori (42) in a 86-run partnership. James Franklin was unbeaten on two. 

Daren Powell had ripped through New Zealand middle order immediately after tea, dismissing Fulton on the first delivery then having Scott Styris (8) caught by Runako Morton at second slip and Brendon McCullum caught by wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin for 23 to give his side hope of restricting the lead. 

Astle and Vettori, however, refused to be shackled on a good pitch and in ideal batting conditions to ensure their side held a healthy lead. 

We may have been a bit too aggressive but we have again found ourselves in a position of strength, Fleming said.

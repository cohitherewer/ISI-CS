 Debate over second spinner

 - There are no soft teams in this Champions Trophy: Dravid

Jaipur: The Champions Trophy schedule is such that the hosts will have a 11-day break between the opening match and the next. For the vacation to be enjoyed, though, Rahul Dravid and Co. must defeat England at the spruced-up Sawai Man Singh Stadium here Sunday. 

Rajasthans capital, which has something of history in just about every nook and corner, has already hosted two day-night ODIs (both tournament qualifiers) this week. The big one, however, isnt many hours away and the state association chief, Lalit Modi, has had a tough time trying to oblige those who wont be satisfied with anything but the best seats. 

Its known that Team India thrashed England 5-1 when the two met in a bilateral series earlier this year, but Dravid was quick to accept that wouldnt have much relevance in the Champions Trophy propers face-off No.1. 

What matters is how a team plays on the day... In fact, any of the eight sides in the tournament could go on to win next years World Cup... There are no soft teams in this Champions Trophy... Of course, its going to help if we get off to a roll early on, he maintained. 

Clearly, the changed format should significantly raise the level of competition in the hottest event outside the World Cup. 

Dravid, as usual, gave no indication about the likely XI. Nor, for that matter, did he indicate who would open. The buzz is that senior-most pro Sachin Tendulkar wants to launch the innings with Virender Sehwag. It appears he will have his way and, so, the captain has to occupy a middle-order slot. 

Whats certain (well, to the extent things can be) is that the Indians are going to field a conventional 7-4 combination. Given the slowness of the wickets, there was speculation that five specialist bowlers may get the nod, but thats unlikely. 

Its not confirmed, but theres a tussle between Irfan Pathan and Ramesh Powar. If Dravid and coach Greg Chappell decide to play both specialist spinners (the in-form Harbhajan Singh being the other), then Pathan wont have a role. Theres no question mark over Ajit Agarkar and Munaf Patel. 

Among the specialist batsmen, Suresh Raina is the one with the least chance of making the XI. That Dinesh Mongia came good in the only match he played in Kuala Lumpur, against Australia, has cemented his place. For now, at least. 

From Englands point of view, much of the attention will obviously be on captain Andrew Flintoff, who hasnt played a one-day International for six months. He hasnt fully recovered from surgery on his left ankle and, so, wont bowl in the tournament. 

I do bowl a bit at nets, but thats at about 75 per cent... Im not going to rush things and it was known that complete recovery would take time, Flintoff remarked, adding he would bat at No.3. 

 Dravid, by the way, paid Flintoff a handsome compliment: His exploits in the last Ashes (2005) were well documented, not so the impact he made in India this year... He made a big impact with bat, ball and captaincy... I would like him to do well versus the others, but he should fail when playing against India! 

Commenting on the pluses and minuses of a blockbuster event at home, Dravid said: Definitely more pluses as the crowds support is a factor... 

Talking of the janata, its expected to root the most for Mahendra Singh Dhoni. If a reminder is needed, Master Blaster II had taken Sri Lanka to the cleaners with an explosive unbeaten 183 a year ago, the last time India played at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium. 

Dhoni, though, isnt taking anything for granted. Tomorrow will be a fresh innings and Im going to start on zero... Last years knock gives confidence, but doesnt guarantee anything, he told The Telegraph in his down-to-earth manner. 

Incidentally, with the business end of the Champions Trophy at hand, few would bet on any match ending in so lopsided a manner as the Sri Lanka-West Indies one Saturday. With the West Indies (the holders) managing no more than 80, the Sri Lankans topped the qualifiers with ease. 

England finished runners-up in the last edition, at home, while India were joint-winners (with Sri Lanka) in 2002. Thats the best for the two drawn to launch the tournament.

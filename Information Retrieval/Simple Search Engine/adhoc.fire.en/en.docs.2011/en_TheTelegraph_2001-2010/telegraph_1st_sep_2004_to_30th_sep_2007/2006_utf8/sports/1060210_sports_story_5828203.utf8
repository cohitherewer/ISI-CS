The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Powar may pip Kartik tomorrow

INDRANIL MAJUMDAR 

Islamabad: It is now almost official that Harbhajan Singh will miss the remaining matches of the one-day series. The off-spinner injured his right index finger while fielding as a substitute during the Karachi Test. 

We are monitoring him closely. Obviously we are keeping in mind not just this series, but a lot of cricket coming up in the next few months. We cant fix a timeframe for his recovery, Rahul Dravid said on Thursday. 

According to sources, Ramesh Powar, who arrived here on Wednesday as a cover-up for Harbhajan, is likely to play the second ODI at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground. Murali Kartik has failed to impress and the Mumbai offie is well-placed since his batting abilities will come as a bonus. 

The Indians had nets in the morning in Rawalpindi followed by another session at the sports complex here in the evening. Greg Chappell and Sreesanth, who are both down with a sore throat and slight fever, did not attend. 

The Indians couldnt go flat out at nets in Rawalpindi because of the two-hour timeframe set by the security personnel in keeping with Muharram. Sachin Tendulkar, though, used the opportunity to practice with the net bowlers in one corner, while Ajit Agarkar incurred the wrath of the groundsmen for batting on pitches meant for bowlers near the square. 

The Indians are still undecided on their bowling combination. There is a school of thought which feels that having five bowlers in these conditions is a luxury. An extra batsman might be more useful.In case Sreesanth fails to recover in time, Rudra Pratap Singh will take his place. But, if the Indians decide on having an extra batsman for Sreesanth, Gautam Gambhir is a certainty. 

The pitch is devoid of grass and it looks another high scoring match is on the cards. But with the 9.30 (local time) start and the dew prevalent at this time of the year, there should be some lateral movement in the opening hour. 

Dravid, however, again defended the profligate ways of his bowlers in the opening game. Ours is a young attack, Its tough in these conditions. We are trying out a few different things. They are learning and working on them. 

The captain toed the familiar line, but the time has come to arrest this bowling slide. Unless the side finds ways to restrict their opponents, no amount of runs will be able to save them. 

Meanwhile Shoaib Akhtar did not bowl at the nets after experiencing pain in his ankle. 

Musharraf invitation 

President Gen. Pervez Musharraf will meet players of both teams Friday morning. A cricket lover, he had met the players and watched the second ODI in 2004. He also visited New Delhi to watch the final ODI during Pakistans return tour.

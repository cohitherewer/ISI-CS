 Princess may rule supreme 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Supreme Princess, a facile winner of the Calcutta Oaks and the Queens Cup, both long distance races, may rule supreme in the 2,800m Calcutta St. Leger on Saturday. The Daniel David-trained filly is not only the best stayer in the five-horse field, she is also in good form.

 Jockey B. Prakash, who partners Supreme Princess, may be seen at an advantage again on Retained Asset in the B.K.Poddar Cup over 1,400m. In his previous start, the Warrshan-Autumn Affair son found the mile trip a wee bit taxing. Prakashs another ride,Tomahawk, in the opener, the Navy Cup, may cash in on his current form. His Favourable Returns, in the Acorn Stakes, may also give a tough fight to the in-form Javed Khans filly, Chitralekha.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

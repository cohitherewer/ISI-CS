 Hari draws with Karjakin

Crimea: Former world junior champion P. Harikrishna drew with Sergey Karjakin of Ukraine after a sharp tactical battle in the eight round of the Aerosvit International Grandmasters chess tournament. 

The Indian GM played the king pawn opening to which Karjakin responded with the Najdorf variation of the Sicilian defence. Having done their home work well, both the players readily entered a sharp line with tactical complications. But the game ended in a draw by repetition after 28 moves. 

The two players have 3 points apiece to be behind the rest of the field in the 12-player category-18 tournament. 

On the top board, tournament leader Grandmaster Sergey Rublevsky of Russia also settled for a draw with GM Alexey Shirov of Spain in mere 19 moves. 

Rublevsky continues to lead the field with 6.0 points, but his lead was cut down to half-a-point as Ukrainian GM Vassily Ivanchuk scored a smooth victory over Volokitin.

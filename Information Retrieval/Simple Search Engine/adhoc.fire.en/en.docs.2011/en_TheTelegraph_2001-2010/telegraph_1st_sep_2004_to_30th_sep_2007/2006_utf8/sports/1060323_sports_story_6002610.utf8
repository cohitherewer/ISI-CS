 In the clash between the club and AIFF, players are the most affected lot, feels Ambrose 

New Delhi: Fransa Pax chairman Micky Pacheco has decided to disband the club after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) appeal committee on Wednesday announced not to replay the Goan outfits controversial National Football League (NFL) tie against Air India. 

The committee has also declared Air India winners of the match, and awarded the Mumbai side three points and three goals as per the NFL rules. 

Speaking to The Telegraph from Goa, Pacheco said: Ive got nothing to do with football anymore. Its a waste of time, money and effort. The Fransa boss said he would not only pull his team out of the NFL, but will also discontinue with the age-group teams. 

The appeal committee decision has come as a jolt for Fransa, especially after AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi awarded them a replay in writing on February 23 when the emergency committee failed to reach a solution, and left it for the federation chief to take a final decision. 

The matter, however, had to be referred to the appeal committee after Air India lodged a protest. It was Das Munshi who had decided on the replay. If we cannot take the AIFF presidents word, what right does he have to continue in office? Pacheco asked. 

While the Fransa chairman termed the AIFF a big joke and called it a body of flips and flops, the team players are extremely upset over the latest developments. We have been called for a practice session at the Colva beach tomorrow (Thursday) morning, said Fransa skipper Cressan Antao, who has been with the team since Pacheco took it over in 2001. 

It could well be our last practice, but we will try to change Pachecos mind. 

According to another footballer, Alex Ambrose, the players are planning to meet the club chairman on Thursday to try and change his mind. In this tug of war, the players are the most affected lot, he said. 

Another footballer alleged that players have not been paid their salaries for the last three months. Pacheco, however, assured that all players would be paid their dues till the end of the season. 

To make matters worse, the Fransa management is also unlikely to inform the AIFF about their decision to quit the NFL midway through. They are planning to simply call it a day and not to report for matches any further. Fransas next match is against Sporting Clube de Goa on March 30.

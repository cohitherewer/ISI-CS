 Another 100 by Sachin

London: Sachin Tendulkar came up with another big score for Lashings World XI, hitting 147 before retiring in a charity match against Reigate Priory Cricket Club, Surrey. 

Tendulkar got support from skipper Richie Richardson, who chipped in with 95 as Lashings declared at 292 for four in 41.3 overs after opting for first strike on Sunday. 

Reigate Priory made 197 for seven in 51 overs, Jon Gale top-scoring with an unbeaten 64 and Aleks Richards contributing 31. 

Sachin, testing himself in match conditions before making a comeback to international cricket, had hit a strokeful 155 in his first outing for the star-studded club last week.

 Nadal battles back to overpower Nieminen

 - Barcelona Open 

 Rafael Nadal celebrates winning a point against Jarkko Nieminen in Barcelona on Friday 

Barcelona: Rafael Nadal dug deep into his reserves to extend his winning streak on clay to 45 matches on Friday with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3 win over Finn Jarkko Nieminen in the quarter finals of the Barcelona Open. 

The defending champion and top seed battled back from 6-4, 4-1 down to set up a semi-final against either 10th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero or unseeded Spaniard Nicolas Almagro. 

The victory moves Nadal to within one of second-placed Bjorn Borg in the open-era list of most consecutive wins on the surface, a list headed by Argentine Guillermo Vilas with 53. 

Sixth seed Tommy Robredo of Spain will play unseeded Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka in the second semi-final. 

Robredo, who earlier finished off his rain-delayed third-round match with Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 2-6, 6-2; followed it up by beating Czech fourth seed Radek Stepanek 6-3, 6-2. 

Wawrinka beat unseeded Ivo Karlovic 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, becoming the first man to break the Croatians serve this week.

Multan: Half centuries from Imran Farhat, Younis Khan and Mohammed Yousuf inspired a strong fightback by Pakistan to save the second Test after Brian Lara had hit his ninth double hundred to put West Indies in control on Wednesday. 

Farhat (70 not out) shared substantial partnerships with Younis (56) and Yousuf (56 not out) to steer Pakistan to a comfortable 213 for two at the close on the fourth day, just 21 runs short of making West Indies bat again. 

West Indies, enjoying a big first innings lead of 234 thanks to Laras brilliant 216, dismissed Mohammed Hafeez for 18 in the second session and removed the dangerous Younis in the second over after tea. 

While Hafeez was bowled middle stump by Jerome Taylor, Younis was caught behind off spinner Dave Mohammed after a 100-run stand from 149 balls with Farhat. 

The left-handed Farhat, dropped in the next over on 45 by Shivnarine Chanderpaul at short mid-off off Dwayne Bravo, combined with the in-form Yousuf to put on an undefeated 89 runs for the third wicket to keep the visitors at bay. 

Yousuf was in splendid form scoring his 27th half-century from 66 balls with seven fours and Farhat his 10th from 139 balls and six boundaries. 

Younis also completed his 17th half-century from 66 balls with six shots to the fence and 4000 runs in his 49th match with a streaky shot down to fine leg. 

All three batsmen also got half centuries in the first innings total of 357 to which West Indies replied with 591. 

Trailing the three-match series 0-1 after last weeks nine-wicket defeat in Lahore, West Indies were bowled out one hour before lunch having resumed on 509 for five. 

Lara, resuming on 196, completed his double hundred after playing 11 balls in the morning before holing out in the deep to leg-spinner Danish Kaneria. 

His 216 coming in 432 minutes and 262 balls with 22 fours and seven sixes. 

Kaneria finished with five for 181 for his 12th five-wicket haul as Pakistan took the last five wickets for 89 runs.

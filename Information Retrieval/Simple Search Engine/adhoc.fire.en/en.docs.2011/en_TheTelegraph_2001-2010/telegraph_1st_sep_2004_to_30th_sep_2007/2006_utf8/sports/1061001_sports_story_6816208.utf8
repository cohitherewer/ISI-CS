 Inzy: No legal action against Hair

 EYE OF THE STORM: Darrell Hair 

Islamabad: Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul Haq on Saturday said he would not take any legal action against umpire Darrell Hair as he was keen to put the unsavoury episode behind him. 

He said his relationship with Hair was tense during the entire episode but he held no grudge against him. 

We have been vindicated in our stand on ball-tampering. I have no intentions now of taking any legal action against Hair or anyone else, he said. 

It is not easy for me because the last few weeks have been a big burden. I have felt the pressure more than on the field. I am trying to forget everything and look ahead, he said on Saturday. 

Inzamam was charged on two counts of violating the ICC Code of Conduct during the fourth Test against England at The Oval last month. 

I am normally a very calm person but when the umpires basically said we were tampering with the ball, we were all very upset... 

I am satisfied now and I have nothing in my heart. But I knew a ban was on once we didnt go on to the field. 

Although obviously I am disappointed at having to miss a major tournament like the Champions Trophy. 

The ICC has done what is necessary for the game. I would advise everyone to let this matter rest and move on. 

He said Pakistani players felt bad for the spectators who were deprived of watching the full match but said they were forced into taking the stand.

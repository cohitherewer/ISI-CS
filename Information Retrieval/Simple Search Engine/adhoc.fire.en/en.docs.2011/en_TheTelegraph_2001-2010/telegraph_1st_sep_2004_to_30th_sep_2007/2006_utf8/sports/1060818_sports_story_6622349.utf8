The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Tokyo: Former Japan coach Zico was close to being sacked before the World Cup, according to Japan Football Association (JFA) president Saburo Kawabuchi. Zico stepped down as planned following Japans first-round flop in Germany but Kawabuchi acknowledged he had thought about firing the Brazilian during a bumpy qualifying campaign.

 During the qualifiers I did think about replacing him, Kawabuchi said. But after we had got through the qualifiers I thought there was no reason to.

 Japan failed to make any impact at the World Cup finals, however, and Kawabuchi admitted in hindsight that the team had lacked direction under Zico.

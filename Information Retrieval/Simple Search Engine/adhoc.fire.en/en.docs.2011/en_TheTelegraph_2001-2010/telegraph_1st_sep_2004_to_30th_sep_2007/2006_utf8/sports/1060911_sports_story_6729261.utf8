 Leander picks up 7th major

 Leander Paes 

New York: Leander Paes and Martin Damm crowned their first year as a pair on Saturday as they beat second seeds Jonas Bjorkman and Max Mirnyi 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-3 to win the mens doubles title at the US Open. 

Indian Paes and Czech Damm, the sixth seeds, were a break down in the second set but recovered to win in two hours, 35 minutes. 

The victory gave Damm his first Grand Slam title, while it was Paes fourth mens doubles crown and seventh in all. He has three mixed doubles Grand Slam titles. 

It was the Indians first mens doubles title at a Grand Slam in five years. The 33-year-old last won a major in 2001 at the French Open with Mahesh Bhupathi, with whom he also won the French Open and Wimbledon titles in 1999. 

Bjorkman and Mirnyi, who lost to American brothers Bob and Mike Bryan in the final 12 months ago, looked on course for victory when they took the opening set on a tie-break and broke in the first game of the second. 

But Paes and Damm, beaten finalists at the Australian Open and who saved five match points in their semi-final win, roared back to clinch victory. 

Paes said communication had been the key to his success with Damm. I dont think there are enough words to express how much fun and how much learning Ive actually had playing with Martin, because were actually opposites on the court, Paes said. 

Martin is strong and plays more solid. Im more flashy and a bit more quick. We really complement each other. Its been a fantastic year playing with him. Ive really enjoyed it. Id like to thank him for a wonderful year. 

Paes and Damm pocketed $400,000. 

The lengthy opening set was a power struggle that stayed on serve to force a tie-break. Even then, Bjorkman and Mirnyi just barely slid by. 

The 6-foot-5 Mirnyi used his enormous reach to take care of some high overhead shots. While across the net, Paes clinched numerous points by poaching. Both teams were equally fierce on their serves, but Bjorkman and Mirnyis 15 unforced errors and nine double faults cost them. 

In the second set, the gap started to widen. The expressive Paes, who was slamming down his racket in frustration in the first set, now pumped his fist, initiated chest butts with Damm, and performed erratic dance moves as the two nudged ahead in the second set. 

In the third, both teams fought it out until Paes and Damm, up 4-3, managed to snatch a break to serve for the match. When Damm pounded back an overhead for a sideline winner to secure the title, a jubilant Paes bounded into his arms. 

Paes said the final was a very close encounter and they had had such tough matches with Bjorkman and Mirnyi in the past as well. We have really some tough matches against them. They are two wonderful ambassadors of the game and are fantastic talents. 

I knew we had a job on hand because both Max and Bjorkman were serving excellently well. Max was serving at 140 miles per hour and it was almost impossible to get a racket on that. We were lucky to find a way to fight back and as the match went on, we got better and sharper, Paes said. 

 The duos triumph sealed their spot at the season-ending 

 Masters Cup in Shanghai.

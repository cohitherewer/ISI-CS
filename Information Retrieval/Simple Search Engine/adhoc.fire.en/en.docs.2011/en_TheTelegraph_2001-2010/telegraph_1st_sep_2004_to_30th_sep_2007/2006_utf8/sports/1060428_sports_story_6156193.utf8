 Barcelona hold off Milan to set up dream date

 - Champions League

 - The final will be interesting, we have a chance: Wenger

Paris has its wish. Ronaldinho, a former resident, as well as Thierry Henry, a favourite son, are coming to town on May 17 for a European Cup climax that shimmers with joie de vivre. This is not a final, this is a carnival. 

Given such grace by Ronaldinho, Barcelona will doubtless be installed as favourites but Arsenals manager, Arsene Wenger, will have found last nights spying mission to the Nou Camp most instructive. Wenger considered staying at home and watching the match on television, but the temptation to see Barcelona in the flamboyant flesh proved too much. Having just flown back from Spain following Arsenals stalemate at Villarreal, Wenger flew back out again. 

The final will be interesting, said Wenger before leaving the Nou Camp. We have a chance. We must prepare well. Their dangermen are Samuel Eto, Ronaldinho and Ludovic Giuly. Ronaldinho, in any moment, can produce something special. Of course, I saw some encouraging things. The important thing is to go with the right belief. You always want to make it your destiny. 

As Wenger indicated, there were some encouraging things for Arsenal to take from this. Amid all the flashes of genius on view, and one volleyed 70-yard pass from Ronaldinho which took the breath of 90,000 spectators away, glimmers of mortality could be detected in Catalan ranks. Barcelonas risk-taking defence can definitely be caught out, particularly when the ball is dropped into the gaps between the centre-halves and full-backs. 

The dream final promises compelling duels all over the Stade de France: Eto against Kolo Toure, Ronaldinho against Emmanuel Eboue, Henry versus Carles Puyol, Henrys employers versus his suitors, Gio van Bronckhorst against his old club. 

Whatever the myriad sub-plots, Paris was guaranteed a spectacle the moment Barcelona comfortably held off a disappointing Milan. Trailing from the first leg, Milan had hoped to pull off a rescue act that no other European Cup semi-finalist had achieved since Ajax a decade ago. Milan were not only fighting history but the sweet movement of Barcelona. 

Within two minutes, Frank Rijkaards fine side could have scored but Dida proved the equal to Etos left-footer. When Eto ? such a blend of pace, touch and intelligent runs ? next came calling, Dida could only half-block the shot and Alessandro Costacurta hooked the danger clear. 

Ronaldinho, inevitably, led many of Barcelonas elegant raiding parties. Milan sought to stifle him early, Jaap Stam and Gennaro Gattuso both guilty of late challenges, but the Fifa World Player of the Year managed to ride most of the Lombardian lunges. Such was Ronaldinhos menace that, after the break, Carlo Ancelotti switched Clarence Seedorf across to help fight the fire. Milan could have done with a satellite to track Ronaldinho. 

The majesty of the Brazilian in full flight had attracted countless distinguished visitors from Britain to the Nou Camp, not only Wenger, but also Roy Keane and Sam Allardyce. Football-lovers love the football conjured up by Barcelona. Deco was often involved, even releasing Juliano Belletti down the inside-right channel for a strike that the full-back flashed wide. 

As well as stars like Ronaldinho, Eto and Deco, Barcelonas supporting cast also impressed in the first half, notably Andres Iniesta, who constantly darted forward from his anchoring station alongside Edmilson. Any gate-crasher to the Nou Camp on Wednesday last night would have assumed it was Barcelona chasing the tie, such was their commitment to attack. 

Milan sat back, soaked up Barcelonas surges, and then sought to work the ball forward, often starting with Andrea Pirlo, the deep-lying move-launcher. Rafael Marquez, who shares Barcelonas centre-half sentry duties with Puyol, showed terrific agility to cut out one through ball that appeared destined to fly over him and reach Filippo Inzaghi. 

Then a neat interchange between Seedorf and Pirlo swept the ball along the edge of Barcelonas box, before it was suddenly transferred to Andrei Shevchenko, who surprisingly found only the side-netting. Frustration was biting deeper and deeper into Milans support. 

Mindful of the ticking clock, Milan raced upfield again. Seedorf clipped a ball into the box which Shevchenko headed straight at Victor Valdes. Barcelona immediately reacted, tearing forward, Ronaldinho finding Giuly, whose cross from the right was dreadfully wasted by Belletti. 

Controversy then ensued. Shevchenko, preying on Barcelonas weakness to aerial balls, had the ball in the net but his header was ruled out for an apparent push on Puyol, which appeared slight at best. The referee, and the sporting gods, smiled on Barcelona. So will Paris.

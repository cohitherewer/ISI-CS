The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Women make a mark 

Hanover: Women are everywhere at this World Cup. They crowd stadiums and street festivals, rearrange their lives around game schedules. Germanys female chancellor is leading the cheers from the VIP section. 

Its a long way from the days when soccer was strictly mens business, when female spectators were an oddity. The German soccer federation only lifted a ban on women in the sport in 1970. 

But once the dam was breached, the women came in huge numbers. Germanys womens team is No. 1 in the world, ahead of the US. The Germans won the 2003 World Cup and are six-time European champions. A womens Bundesliga was formed in 1991. 

 Today, 12 per cent of the 6.3 million members in Germanys soccer clubs are women. Soccer has become the No. 1 team sport for girls. (AP)

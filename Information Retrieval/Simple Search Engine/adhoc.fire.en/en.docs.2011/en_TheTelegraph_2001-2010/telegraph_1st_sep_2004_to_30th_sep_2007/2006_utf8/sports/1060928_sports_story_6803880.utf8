 Gangjee, Kapur in fray

Taipei: Rahil Gangjee, who has hit a purple patch that has seen him rise to a career-best 29th on the UBS Asian Tour Order of Merit, will be hoping to strike it rich at the $500,000 Mercuries Taiwan Masters that begins on Thursday. 

Also in the field is Shiv Kapur, buoyed by his fifth place in the Singapore Open, his best finish of the year, that catapulted him to sixth place on the money list. 

 My aim is to give Jeev a run for his money for top spot in money list and if I win here that can happen, said Kapur. 

The other Indians in the field are Gaurav Ghei, S.S.P. Chowrasia, Arjun Singh, Harmeet Kahlon, Gurbaaz Mann and Digvijay Singh. 

The defending champion is Lu Wei-Chih of Chinese Taipei. Among his chief rivals, besides Gangjee and Kapur, are Australian Brad Kennedy and Thailands Prom Meesawat. (PTI)

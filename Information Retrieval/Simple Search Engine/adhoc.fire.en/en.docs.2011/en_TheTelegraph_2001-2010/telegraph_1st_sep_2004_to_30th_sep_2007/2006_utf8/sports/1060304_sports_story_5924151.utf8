 Flawless start by Tiger

 - DORAL CHAMPIONSHIP 

 - Atwal shoots 68 to be four behind leader

Miami: Tiger Woods made the perfect start to his Doral Championship title defence, moving one shot clear with an eight-under-par 64 in Thursdays opening round. 

The world No. 1, who overhauled Phil Mickelson in a gripping last-day duel 12 months ago, reeled off eight birdies in a blemish-free display at Dorals Blue Course. 

Indias Arjun Atwal shot a four-under-par 68 to lie four shots behind the leader. Atwal, the former Asian Tour No. 1, carded five birdies against a lone bogey to end the day in tied 20th place. 

It was good work by the Indian ace after having made early exits in his last two events. 

Bidding for his third victory of the year in five starts, Woods picked up shots at three of the first four holes before covering the back nine in five-under 31. 

That left him one ahead of fellow-Americans Mickelson, 2002 US PGA champion Rich Beem, Ryan Palmer and Mark Wilson, plus PGA Tour rookie Camilo Villegas of Colombia. 

Woods romped to a record 9 amp; 8 victory over Canadian Stephen Ames in his first match of last weeks WGC-Accenture Match-Play Championship at La Costa before being ousted in the third round. 

Left-hander Mickelson was delighted to find some form with his putter after struggling on the greens in his first five PGA Tour starts of the year. 

Among the other big names, Sony Open winner David Toms was one of five players who opened with 66s while world No. 2 Vijai Singh returned a 67. 

Davis Love III, who lost to Australias Geoff Ogilvy in the final of the WGC-Accenture Match-Play Championship on Sunday, and Irelands Padraig Harrington were among a group on 68. 

Spaniard Sergio Garcia, the world No. 6, birdied his final hole for a 69 while twice US Open champion Retief Goosen, the world No. 3, carded a 70. 

However, fourth-ranked Ernie Els finished eight strokes off the pace, offsetting four birdies with four bogeys for a level-par 72 in his first appearance at Doral since his 2002 triumph. 

Nine of the worlds top-10 are playing this week at the Blue Course, where the tournament is being held for the final time as a regular tour stop.

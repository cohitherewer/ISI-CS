 Sami, Kamal called up for tour match

Karachi: Pakistan have recalled Asim Kamal, Yasir Hameed and Mohammad Sami for a two-day tour match against the West Indies after the teams recent failures in England and the Champions Trophy. 

West Indies start their tour of Pakistan with a two-day game in Lahore from Wednesday followed by three Tests and five one-day Internationals. 

Pakistan lost the Test series in England 0-3 and were eliminated in disappointing fashion from the Champions Trophy after the round-robin phase. 

Chief selector Wasim Bari said the panel had an open mind regarding the Test line-up. 

These are special circumstances with Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif also unavailable. We will consider a number of discarded players as we need to plug in the gaps in the team, he said on Thursday. 

Opener Hameed last played in June 2005 and middle order bat Kamal, who has eight fifties in 12 Tests, have been ignored since last winter while Sami has also been out of favour since failing in England. 

A senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official said that Yasir, Kamal and Sami were being considered for selection as it was time to start preparing the best possible combination for the World Cup. 

Bari said the bans on Shoaib and Asif was a major setback but the selectors had built up a good bench strength of 20 to 25 players and Pakistan still had the capacity to field a balanced one-day squad. 

We have been following the rotation policy of selection consistently based on a players current form and it has worked well for us, he added.

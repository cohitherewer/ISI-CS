The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 EBs Brazilian striker arrives

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: East Bengal unveiled their new Brazilian striker on Friday. The 26-year-old Marcio Fernandes Thomas, who was with Rio de Janeiro first division side Vilario, will sign for the red-and-golds once his ITC comes in a day or two. 

East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto de Souza, who has rued the lack of scorers, expects Marcio to play that role in the Mohammedan Sporting match on Thursday. 

He is a positive striker and a good header. He is also very cool inside the box, said the East Bengal coach. 

Marcio, who scored his last goal for Vilario just before leaving Brazil, said (through a translator) that he had played for Swiss club Meiyn and scored 16 goals in a season.

 Anand draws with Adams

Wijk Aan Zee (The Netherlands): Viswanathan Anand was quickly held by English Grandmaster Michael Adams in the seventh round of the Corus International Chess tournament here on Saturday. 

After a shocking loss against Gata Kamsky of the United States in the previous round, the 23-move draw against Adams did not prove enough for Anand to retain joint lead, and the Indian ace was pushed to second spot after world champion Veselin Topalov made mincemeat of local hopeful Ivan Sokolov. 

With his fourth victory in the 14-players all-play-all tournament, Topalov (5 points) took a slender half point lead over Anand. 

2nd GM norm for Negi 

Meanwhile, Parimarjan Negi caused a flutter by clinching his second GM norm in the final round of the fourth Parsvnath International Open Chess in New Delhi on Sunday. 

Negi defeated S. Kidambi with black pieces in around four hours to earn the norm in successive tournaments. His first norm came at Hastings, England, last month. 

Negi thus overshadowed Alexei Fedorovs great unconquered run to the title. (PTI)

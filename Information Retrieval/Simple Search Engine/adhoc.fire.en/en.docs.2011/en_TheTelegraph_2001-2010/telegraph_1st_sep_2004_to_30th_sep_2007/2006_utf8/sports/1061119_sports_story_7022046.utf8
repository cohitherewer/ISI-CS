 Umpires go public against ICC

 - HAIR ISSUE 

Sydney: One of Australias largest umpiring associations has publicly criticised the International Cricket Councils (ICC) decision to sack Darrell Hair from the Elite panel of umpires. 

The NSW Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association (NSWCUSA), of which Hair is a life member, ran a full page advertisement in a Sydney newspaper on Saturday, describing the ICCs decision as a travesty of justice. 

The decision to remove Darrell from the Elite Panel of umpires has clearly not been taken and cannot be justified on grounds related to his ability as an umpire, NSWCUSA chairman Tim Donahoo wrote in an open letter to ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

The sole reason for this pre-emptive action can only be interpreted as a need to appease the Pakistan Cricket Board ... who have been noisily critical of Hair for some time, presumably because he is known as a no-nonsense umpire who actually does what he is paid to do. (Reuters)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 The pressure was on me

 - Obviously looking forward to playing Hingis, says the Indian glamour girl 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza did not belie expectations. She sailed into the second round of the Sunfeast Open with a 6-0, 6-4 defeat of compatriot Rushmi Chakravarthy on Tuesday evening. At the post-match press conference, she answered all questions with aplomb. 

 Following are excerpts

 QYou cruised in the 

 first set. But struggled a bit in the second. What do you 

 have to say about that? 

 A Well, the opponent was a 

 player too and she had nothing to lose. The pressure was 

 on me. I was a bit rusty, but that is only to be expected. 

 Rushmi was a bit nervous in the first set. In the second, 

 she played better, hit forehand better while I tended to 

 slow down. Im glad to be through to the next round. How does it feel to be back in the city? 

 Calcutta is wonderful. Sportsmen here are like 

 idols, treated like movie stars. You feel a warmth which 

 you dont get in most other cities. 

 How are you preparing for the subsequent rounds? 

 I am, honestly, not even thinking of the coming 

 rounds. I havent even seen the draw. I just knew that 

 I was playing Rushmi. I am taking it match by match and 

 right now Im enjoying todays victory. 

 Since you are not defending points here, are you under 

 less pressure? 

 Everything is not about defending points. Would 

 you have spared me had I lost today? Pressure is there everyday. 

 That is not going to change. Im trying to change myself. 

 How are you looking at the expected clash with Martina 

 Hingis? 

 I am obviously looking forward to it. But, as Martina 

 said yesterday, we both have to get there first, right? 

 Did you watch Hingis play Melinda Czink? 

 I watched a few games. Shes a great champion, 

 no doubt, and a great mover on the court. Watching her play 

 is a treat. 

 This year has not exactly been going your way. Are 

 you any the wiser for it? 

 There will be some good years and some bad. And 

 anyway, this year has not been as bad as everyone has been 

 making it out to be. Ive been playing doubles well. 

 I am a more mature player and have grown as a person you 

 continue to learn till you retire and even beyond it. 

 Sourav Ganguly came to watch you play. How does that 

 feel? 

 Sourav and I have been pretty good friends for 

 the past few years. It was great he came to watch me play. 

 I told him the crowd would go berserk if he came, and I 

 was right. 

 Last year here, you were asked the reason for the 

 gap between you and the other women tennis players of the 

 country. That gap still exists. Your comments? 

 Nothing happens overnight. That gap will take time 

 to bridge. But a large number of people are following the 

 game in the country. That is the biggest positive. Time 

 was when I, my mom, the other player, her mom and the coach 

 would be the only ones present during a match. And this 

 time, there are six Indians in the main draw. We just need 

 to be patient. A lot more girls will come up. 

 Finally, dont you think you need to be a little 

 more patient while playing? 

 As you all know, fitness is not my forte. So I 

 cannot afford to be patient like Hingis or Dementieva. I 

 have to go for my shots. I make some and I miss some.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Rehearsal for EB match, says Okoro

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Man-of-the-Match Mike Okoro took the Railway FC match as a rehearsal for their match against East Bengal next week. 

It was a rehearsal of the East Bengal match as we want to win against them, even a draw is not on our minds, Okoro said after their match against Railway FC on Thursday. 

We know it is going to be a tough match for us, but we will have to come out with flying colours in order to win the title, Okoro said. Okoro, whos five goals in the CFL is only second after Mohun Bagans Dipendu Biswas (6 goals), would like to increase his tally against the red-and-golds. I will be happy if I can score against East Bengal. 

On the other hand, coach Subhas Bhowmick was not ready to take this match as a rehearsal for the East Bengal match. Not at all. I prefer taking one match at a time and Im happy that my boys bagged three points today, he remarked.

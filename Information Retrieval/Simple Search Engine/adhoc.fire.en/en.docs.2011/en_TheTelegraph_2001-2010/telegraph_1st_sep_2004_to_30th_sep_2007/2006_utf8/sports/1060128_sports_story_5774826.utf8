 Azad unwell, misses trip

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Karachi: IGP Yashovardhan Azad, who was supposed to be here in the lead-up to the third and final Test, had to cancel his trip owing to illness. However, two senior Indian security officials arrived on Friday evening. 

Mr Azad had to be hospitalised in Bhopal... Hes much better now, but couldnt make it, DIG Tapan Kumar Deka, his replacement, told The Telegraph. 

Deka, it may be recalled, was the security officer on Team Indias tour of Bangladesh in December 2004. Accompanying him is Rajiv Sinha, a director in the ministry of home affairs, and member of the recee party which visited Pakistan not too long ago. 

Both Deka and Sinha are expected to return home once the Test gets underway on Sunday. Ranbir Singh Krishnia (additional commissioner of police, Delhi) has, of course, been travelling with the Rahul Dravids from Day-I ? January 5. 

Karachi is receiving special attention as its seen as a sensitive venue.

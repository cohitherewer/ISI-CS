The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 JCT down Bagan 2-0

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In Wednesdays double-header under lights at the Salt Lake Stadium, Mohun Bagan represented the other side of the Bhaichung Bhutia-inspired East Bengal ? as they gave a lacklustre, listless performance, and ended up as losers. 

JCT sealed Mohun Bagans fate within a space of three minutes through the strikes of Johnson Banner (33) and Parveen Kumar (37). Both goals were the outcome of counter-attacks, exposing the home fans once again to the fear that this season might just see them fighting to avoid relegation. 

Mohun Bagan started off on a positive note, prising open the JCT defence with two clear chances inside the first ten minutes. 

Ibrahim first ballooned the ball over the horizontal when a well-timed Dharamjit Singh pass found him clear on the top box. 

Both were the culprits in equal terms on the second occasion, even though Kalyan Chowbey effected back-to-back saves in excellent fashion. The JCT custodian blocked Dharamjits volley and regained ground in no time to deny Ibrahim, who didnt capitalise on the rebound from close. 

Moreover, there was Rennedy Singh, Sunil Chhetri and MoM Marcos Perreira ? all former Mohun Bagan players, who played spiritedly as if to prove a point against their erstwhile employers. For the record, Mohun Bagan are now on two points after Round IV, while JCT are on five.

 Randhawa now No. 101

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa is within striking range of once again breaking into the top 100 of world golf rankings. 

The Indian ace, who finished tied 13th at the Dubai Desert Classic moved from 108 to 101, and a good showing at the Johnnie Walker Classic can see him closer to his career-best of 71. 

 Meanwhile, Arjun Atwal, who missed 

 the cut at Scottsdale Open, slipped from 127 to 137 and 

 Shiv Kapur, who missed the cut in Dubai, dropped one place 

 from 168 to 169. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sania to be No. 4 seed in city meet

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Sania Mirza will be seeded No. 4 at the WTA Sunfeast Open to be held at the Netaji Indoor Stadium from Monday. 

The Indian star was No. 2 in the original list of entries, when her ranking was in the 50s. But as she has dropped to world No. 70 in the latest rankings, she will be behind Martina Hingis (world No. 9), Karolina Sprem (No. 50) and Yuliana Fedak (No. 64). The seedings will be based on the September 11 list. 

Sania will hope she avoids drawing Hingis in her half of the draw. The Swiss superstar will land in the city on Friday morning. 

Sania will be pairing up with Liezel Huber in the doubles event. 

Ankita Bhambri who has won three ITF singles titles this season has been awarded the second singles wild card into the main draw of the Sunfeast Open. Shikha Uberoi got the first one. 

PTI adds from Mumbai: Sania did not sound too concerned about the steep decline in her singles ranking. 

Stating she had a phenomenal first year on the WTA circuit, when she rose to as high as 33 in 2005, the Hyderabad-based Sania said it was not possible to repeat the feat year after year.

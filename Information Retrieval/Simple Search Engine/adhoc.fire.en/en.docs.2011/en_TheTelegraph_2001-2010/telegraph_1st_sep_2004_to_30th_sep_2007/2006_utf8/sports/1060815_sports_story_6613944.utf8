 Saudis prepared for rain

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Rain might have put a wet blanket on their first practice session upon arriving in the city, but Saudi Arabia firmly believe that weather wont put them at a disadvantage against India on Wednesday. 

Rain and a slushy ground are not good advertisement for the game, but we are prepared for this. Rain or not, our aim will remain the same: A win, coach Marcos Paqueta said on Monday. 

Isnt there a big gap between a team with 13 World Cuppers and one languishing at the bottom of Fifa rankings pointing towards a mismatch? The Brazilian coach refused to believe in such statistics and hastened to add that they have full respect for India, are aware of the hosts velocity and that they like to rely on quick counter-attacks. 

Saudi Arabia are keen to put the World Cup disappointment behind them. For Omar Hussain Sulaimani, leading the side post-Sami al-Jaber era, is a big challenge. 

The match will be shown live from 3 pm on Zee Sports.

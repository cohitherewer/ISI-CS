The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 PCB tribunal not to have neutral doctors

 - Proceedings against Shoaib, Asif unlikely to begin this week

Jaipur: The tribunal, which will be constituted by an acutely embarrassed Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to handle the Shoaib Akhtar-Mohammed Asif doping issue, isnt going to include neutral doctors. 

The PCB has no plans to involve non-Pakistanis... We dont intend looking at somebody from outside the country, for that will suggest we dont trust the independence of our own doctors, a well-placed source told The Telegraph Tuesday evening. 

The source, who didnt wish to be identified, added that while the tribunal may be put in place within 48-72 hours, its unlikely to meet this week. Because of the upcoming Id holidays, we dont expect any movement forward this week... For good reasons, its going to take some time... 

According to the source, the PCB wont take a lenient stand and, if the strike bowlers arent able to convince the tribunal of their innocence, then tough action will be taken. Our understanding, though, is that its not necessary to impose a two-year ban... The punishment could be for a lesser period. 

That Cricket Australia (then the Australian Cricket Board) banned Shane Warne for no more than a year, in February 2003, can always be cited as a precedent. 

Meanwhile, Shoaib and Asif met senior PCB official Saleem Altaf during the day. Apparently, both were accompanied by doctors who treated them during recent injuries Tauseef Razzak (Shoaib) and Sohail Saleem (Asif). 

Till late at night, however, there was no confirmation on whether PCB chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf (a minister in the federal government) had summoned Shoaib and Asif to Islamabad.

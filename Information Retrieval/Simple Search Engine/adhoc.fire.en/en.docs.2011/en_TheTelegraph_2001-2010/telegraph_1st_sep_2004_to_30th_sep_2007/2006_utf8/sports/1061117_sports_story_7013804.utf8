 Boost for Landis claims of innocence 

Singapore: Floyd Landis claims of innocence in the face of a doping charge have been boosted by reports that the French anti-doping laboratory that tested his urine samples had made an administrative error, the American cyclists spokesman said on Wednesday. 

A report in a French daily that a sample had been mislabelled helped validate the Landis teams claims that there is enough evidence to prove his innocence, Michael Henson said. 

The reported administrative error confirms one of the many errors that Floyd and his defence team brought to public attention in early October, Henson wrote in an email to Reuters. The correct identification of an athletes sample is fundamental to the integrity of the results management process. 

The French anti-doping laboratory (LNDD) in Chatenay-Malabry, on the outskirts of Paris, has come under intense scrutiny after its computer system was breached and Le Monde reported that a clerical error had been made in the handling of Landis samples. 

According to the report, the lab made an administrative error, labelling Landis B sample with the wrong number. Tests on the riders two samples indicated that he had elevated levels of testosterone in his system when he won the Tour de France in July. 

While the whole of the Landis defence does not rest on this single mistake, the news validates our claim that there is more than enough fact-based evidence in the public material to prove Floyds innocence, Henson said. (Reuters)

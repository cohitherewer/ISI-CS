 1962 was Garrinchas finest moment

 Garrincha 

By reaching the last three finals of the World Cup, Brazil may be the dominant force in modern football but their fans will not rest until they can successfully defend their title. This desire to win back-to-back tournaments is as important as the prestige of the Hexa, the name for what would be a sixth world title, and their inspiration is the last team to start and finish a World Cup as champions: Brazil in 1962. 

Pele was injured mid-tournament and the team had to rely on Garrincha, a dribbling genius described by one Brazilian journalist as a cripple, an illiterate, and an alcoholic. As a baby, he was as small as a wren, a garrincha, said his sister Rosa, and the nickname stuck. As a player, he was compared to a little bird for the way he flew past defenders. 

Garrincha was born with a left leg that curved in and a right leg that curved out. According to Alex Bellos, author of Futebol, The Brazilian Way of Life, he looked like a cartoon character swaying in the wind ? but with an incredible ability to change direction. 

Paolo Amaral was on the Brazilian coaching staff in the 1950s and remembers writing a scouting report on the young winger after he moved to Botafogo: I wrote that Garrincha is a formidable player, but he has one very small defect: he dribbles far too much, he said. This defect was never resolved. 

Some officials indulged him: in one game for Botafogo, he dribbled past a defender and off the pitch, but the referee did not stop play as he wanted to continue watching him in action. 

His first World Cup appearance was, along with Pele, as a starter against Russia in Brazils third group game in 1958. In the first three minutes, both players had hit the post before Vava scored. They are considered by many as Brazilian footballs greatest three minutes of all time, said Bellos. Garrincha and Pele kept their places and Pele scored twice as Brazil beat Sweden 5-2 in the final. Brazil never lost a match when the two played together. 

Four years later, Garrincha was to have a greater impact, even though his mind was on other things. It would be hard to find a womaniser like him anywhere, said Amaral. He was unique. Or as Nilton Santos, the defender who Garrincha humiliated during a trial at Botafogo and who later became his teammate, said: He only thought with his you-know-what. 

By 1962, Garrincha had been married for 11 years, and had three other children with two different mistresses. And then he met Elza Soares, a famous samba singer who, like Garrincha, had risen from poverty to become a national hero. 

He promised to score for me and he told me that he would go out and win the World Cup as a tribute for me, she said of the love affair that defined Brazils decade, before sniffing: I was honoured but I wasnt going to get big-headed about it. 

Pele limped out of the second game against Czechoslovakia and did not play again in the tournament. Would Brazil, an ageing side, cope without him? The answer was yes. Brazil topped their group by beating Spain but there were concerns about their next knock-out opponents, England. 

They neednt have worried: Garrincha scored twice in a 3-1 win and Brazil began to believe again. Garrincha scored two more in the semi-final against Chile to set up the final against Czechoslovakia which Brazil won the 3-1. 

Santos blushed as he remembered what happened: Everything went on that day! Soares added, It was a beautiful moment of consecration. quot; 

That tournament was Garrinchas finest moment. But his differences with Pele remained stark: whereas Pele had become a professional, registering his name as a trademark and turning himself into a brand, following his 1958 World Cup success, Garrincha remained an amateur who only wanted to play football. He was never interested in money, said Soares. He was simple and for him, football was fun. 

Garrincha was not the same player in 1966. Brazil picked him because of his past heroics but his knees were weak and his last game, a 1-3 defeat to Hungary, was the first time he lost in 60 Brazil appearances. He retired from football, but did not cope well: he drank heavily, had three car accidents (including one that killed Soares mother) and became depressed, eventually drinking himself to death aged 49 in 1983. 

His legacy was already assured: no player had done more to win his team the World Cup than Garrincha in 1962. Only Diego Maradonas achievements with Argentina in 1986 come close to his level of dominance. 

In Germany, all eyes will be on Ronaldinho, who embodies the spirit of freedom and happiness with which Garrincha played the game, but will that be enough to emulate the success of 44 years ago?

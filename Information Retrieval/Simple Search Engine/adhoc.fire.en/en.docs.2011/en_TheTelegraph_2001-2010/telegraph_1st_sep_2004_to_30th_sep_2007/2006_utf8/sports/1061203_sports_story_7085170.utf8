Doha : The sun shone in Doha for the first time in two days on Saturday, but as the day progressed the faces of the big Indian shooting contingent in the Asian Games here turned more and more cloudy. 

Perhaps, the expectations were too high. On Day II of the Games, India opened their account in the medals tally with a couple of bronzes at the Lusail shooting complex in the mens and womens 10-m air rifle team event, but it could hardly please the Indian fans. 

Judging by the performance of the shooters in the last Asian Games, it was not exactly a poor show, but the Indian supporters that included a host of Indian Olympic Committee members, were not convinced. 

In the individual front, there were further disappointments at the ranges, situated far away from the city. The biggest Indian hope in the 10-m air rifle, Gagan Narang flopped to the fifth spot and admitted afterwards that India really missed the presence of world champion Abhinav Bindra in this event. I only know how dearly we missed Bindha, said a disappointed Narang. 

While the Chinese shooters swept all the gold medals at stake on the opening day, the Indian coach Sunny Thomas rued how the Indians failed to break the mental barrier in bigger meets. 

I wont say this is a totally disappointing result, but also there is nothing to feel highly encouraged about it. Every time in these big meets, our shooters fail to deliver the desired result at the last moment. 

In the team event, however, it was not the fault of Narang that forced India to miss the silver medal by a whisker. 

The world junior champion Navnath Fartade, who was touted as one of Indias biggest hopes for the future, made some wayward shooting to reduce India to the third place. Fartade scored a horrible 589 to allow Korea to get the second position by just one point. India scored 1176, Korea 1177 while China walked away with the gold collecting 1786 points. 

In the womens front, Shima Sirur fared badly a 94 in the third series and two superb showings in the first two that fetched her 99 and 100. 

But India could never recover from that one poor series and had to remain content with the bronze. In trap event, however, it was a different story with Manavjit Singh doing creditably in the qualifiers. The world champion hit a fine 70 out of 75 to remain in contention for the gold medal.

Johannesburg: India made a statement of positive intent as they battled inclement weather and some fiery fast bowling by South Africa to reach 156 for 5 on the opening day of the first cricket Test here Friday. 

The Indians, whose batting had been vulnerable against the South African quicks on the tour so far, showed grit in countering a tricky wicket under cloudy sky after skipper Rahul Dravid made a bold decision to bat first at the Wanderers. 

It was the seasoned middle order of Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman and Sourav Ganguly that hauled India out of a tightspot although an indisciplined South African bowling helped their cause to a great extent. 

Openers Wasim Jaffer (9) and Virender Sehwag (4) went cheaply at the score 14 but then a 69-run third-wicket stand between Tendulkar (44) and Dravid (32), and later a 46-run association between Laxman (28) and Ganguly (14 not out) did much to restore their profile. 

The dismissal of Laxman off what turned out to be the days final delivery somewhat spoiled an otherwise reasonably satisfactory day for the visitors. 

There were two interruptions of considerable stretch during the day first a wet pitch delayed the start of the game by 90 minutes and then over an hour was lost because of drizzle and bad light which forced the tea break 15 minutes before scheduled time. 

India recovered much ground in the second session when Tendulkar and Dravid were at the crease. 

The Little Master wasnt averse to making good use of open spaces with sumptuous drives and flips over the slips heads while Dravid was intent in blunting the pace attack of the South Africans. 

Both were taken out of the equation by the nagging line of Jacques Kallis who, surprisingly, was the best bowler for the hosts. 

Kallis had both Tendulkar and Dravid caught in the slip cordon with deliveries that left them a shade. 

After Dravid was out, India at 110 for 4 appeared in a bit of trouble but the duo of Laxman and Ganguly ensured there were no further hiccups.

 FMSCI, MAI set to merge 

Chennai: The two warring bodies, Federation of Motor Sports Clubs in India (FMSCI) and Motorsport Association of India (MAI), are all set to merge following an order from Federation Internationale de LAutomobile (FIA). Former FMSCI president Vicky Chandok, a regular at the FIA meetings, said on Sunday that the merger should certainly go through and there was no speculation about it. 

It will mean a huge growth for the sport in India, he added. 

FMSCI has given a commitment to the FIA that it will be more than happy to follow the findings and decisions of Vijay Mallya, nominated as chairman for resolving the vexed issues and the seven year hitch is gone, Chandhok said. 

FIA had, by its July 6 order, directed Mallya to ensure that the two groups worked under one umbrella, failing which both would be de-recognised. Mallya was scheduled to discuss the merger issue with Nasir Hoosein, MAI president, this month for sending his proposals to the FIA before September 1.

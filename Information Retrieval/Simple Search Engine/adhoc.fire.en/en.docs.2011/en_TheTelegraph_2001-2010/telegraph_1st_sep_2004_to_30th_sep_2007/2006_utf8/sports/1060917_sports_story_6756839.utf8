London: Substitute Lomana Lua Lua scored on Saturday to give Portsmouth a 1-0 win against Charlton Athletic that took them to the top of the Premier League. 

Manager Harry Redknapps team, which only just avoided relegation last season, jumped above Manchester United after a fourth victory in five games and is the only team yet to concede a goal. 

Lua Lua had been on the field for 10 minutes at The Valley when he collected a pass from Sean Davies in the 74th minute, beat midfielder Matt Holland and hit a low shot past goalkeeper Scott Carson. 

Manchester United are not in action until Sunday when they host Arsenal, and defending champion Chelsea host Liverpool. 

Third-placed Everton were held 2-2 at home by Wigan, twice taking the lead only for Austria international Paul Scharner to score twice for the visitor. 

Portsmouth, who now have a goal difference of 9-0, have 13 points from five games, Manchester United have a 100 per cent record of 12 from four and Everton have 11 from five. 

In Saturdays other games, Bolton and Middlesbrough drew 0-0 and, in a meeting between two promoted clubs, Reading won 2-1 at Sheffield United. 

Kevin Doyle took a pass from United States midfielder Bobby Convey to put the Royals ahead after only 16 seconds at Bramall Lane and South Korea midfielder Seol Ki-hyeon made it 2-0 in the 25th with his first goal for Reading. 

Rob Hulse replied for the Blades but Reading held on and, in the top flight for the first time in their 135-year history, have climbed to fifth place. 

In Berlin, Arminia Bielefeld came from behind to win 2-1 at home to Bayern Munich on Saturday, handing the Bundesliga champions their first defeat of the season. Mark van Bommel scored six minutes into his league debut to put the Bavarians ahead, but a mistake in defence allowed Artur Wichniarek to equalise in the 25th minute.

 Never be impatient... openers have a difficult job: Sohail

 May not be a bad idea if Sehwag bats in the middle-order for some time, says former Pak captain 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 A TELEGRAPH SPECIAL 

 Aamer Sohail 

Durban: Former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail, who is on Media duty in the ongoing series, spoke to The Telegraph exclusively about opening. Incidentally, hes the first Asian captain to record a Test win in South Africa at Kingsmead, in 1997-98. 

Following are excerpts 

On Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer failing to come good both in the ODIs and the first Test 

To talk of Sehwag first, he has been worked out by the opposition... He hasnt learnt and continues to look for the cut on deliveries pitched outside off stump... He needs to cut that out and should adjust his stance in order to play in the V... Also, he must mentally be determined to spend time in the middle... As for Jaffer, he looked reasonably good at the Wanderers, but erred in judgement... Theres no need to worry about his technique. 

On whether the Indians should give the pair another chance 

Perhaps, yes... Both have a good record... Having said that, I would like Gautam Gambhir to get an opportunity... His technique isnt faulty and he has the strokes as well. (After a pause) Actually, it may not be a bad idea if Sehwag bats in the middle-order for some time... Hes a reflex-player and, currently, isnt able to handle the movement. The Indian thinktank has to be prepared to make a tough decision... It will be great for India if Sehwag gets runs in Durban, but what if he doesnt? 

On his approach when he opened in South Africa 

I did some homework on the bowlers... The ones who liked to pitch it up, those that preferred pitching it back of a length... Id prepared myself both for the conditions and the bowlers I would face... For example, theres no point waiting on the backfoot to Shaun Pollock... Frankly, its best to keep factors like bounce and movement out of the equation and focus wholly on playing the ball. All batsmen, not just openers, must keep it simple. Once you start complicating things, the problems never end. 

On whether batsmen from the subcontinent get psyched out even before they land in South Africa 

(Grins) Its not the bounce, but movement which does them in... Batsmen from the subcontinent struggle in, say, New Zealand because the ball swings around... Thats the concern, not the bounce. Once we see the ball swinging, theres the tendency to get into a shell. That, then, gets exploited as batsmen from the subcontinent have grown up hitting through the line without moving their feet. 

On the South African openers, captain Graeme Smith and Herschelle Gibbs, also struggling 

Smiths problem is his backlift... Gibbs is, of course, having a poor run. 

On whether its tougher for the openers to get out of a bad patch 

Its tough for batsmen in general... Once youre in that phase, you seek advice and end up doing what others tell you... In doing so, often, the basics get forgotten... That, to my mind, is a huge problem... My advice is simple: Watch the ball coming out of the bowlers hand. Do that and things are going to fall into place. You know, its rightly held that youre one knock away from regaining form... So, dont complicate matters. 

On the lack of quality openers with consistency except, say, in Australia 

Thats a nice point... Youve listed the most important reason for Australias success the lack of good openers in other teams... The Australian bowlers can run through the opposition and, when its Australias turn to bat, the bowlers invariably struggle to get their openers out... The momentum given by a Matthew Hayden is fantastic. 

On the top requirement for openers 

Technique... Thanks to the technology available, anybody with a flaw is quickly sorted out... Once picked, openers should be given time to settle down. Its like moving into a new house... You need time to get used to the setting. Once done, you wont need a candle to move about if theres a power cut... So, never be impatient with openers, for they have a difficult job. 

On openers regularly being changed in Pakistan 

I cant understand it... Salman Butt and Taufeeq Umar ought to be doing the job in Tests... Its easy to drop players, but I have a question: Why cant the highly-paid coaches identify and sort out the problem when somebody loses form? Addresing the problem, I suppose, is more difficult than dropping somebody! The selectors must, for a length of time, be prepared to absorb the failure of openers. 

On whether openers may be made or theyve got to be born 

Depends... Some are natural, while others grow into the job. I myself began first-class cricket in the middle-order, but moved up (for Lahore) on the advice of my captain, the late Wasim Raja... Theres no harm promoting somebody with good technique. 

Finally, his message to young openers 

Watch the ball coming out of the hand... People speak of trigger movements and so on, but the lesser you move the better the chances of succeeding. Then, enjoy the role.

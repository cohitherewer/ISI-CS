 Shoaib ban too harsh, says Imran

Imran Khan feels the two-year ban on Shoaib Akhtar is a bit too harsh, especially in comparison to the punishment the Australian board had meted out to Shane Warne for taking a banned diuretic. 

Following are the reactions of Imran and others (alphabetically) on the PCBs decision: 

STEPHEN FLEMING: It (Shoaibs two-year-ban) is an interesting twist to an interesting scenario There have been positive and negative shades to his career It will be interesting to see how it pans out this time. 

IMRAN KHAN: Considering that Warne got a one-year ban, Shoaibs punishment is a bit harsh. I dont know what transpired (here I am talking from pure ignorance), I also dont know what went on during the hearing. I do think that if the players deliberately took banned substances to enhance performance, there should be punishment to discourage other sportspersons and young children who look up to these players as their heroes and role models. But, I do think that two-year ban is too harsh. 

I am waiting for details, but why this discrimination in the two cases? Perhaps, they thought that Asif is a new player, who probably did not understand implications of taking those drugs. In case of Shoaib, they felt that he ought to have known. 

RASHID LATIF: I was expecting them to impose some sort of ban, but didnt think this would happen. I just feel really bad for the players, I can understand what the duo must be going through at this moment because they have kept on pleading their innocence. It is a sad day for us. A lot of things have happened in the last few months which are not good for the image of Pakistan cricket. 

JAVED MIANDAD: I am shocked and feel sorry for the players, but in the long run such decisions are neccessary for the benefit of Pakistan cricket. I dont know if the intake was accidental or intentional, but this sort of punishment is not good for any player. 

RICKY PONTING: Im not shocked at Shoaibs being banned.

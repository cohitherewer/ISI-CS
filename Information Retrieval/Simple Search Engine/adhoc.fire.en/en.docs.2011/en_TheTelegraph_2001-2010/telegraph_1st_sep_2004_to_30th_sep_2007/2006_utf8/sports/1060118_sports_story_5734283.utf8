 Negi goes down to Uzbek GM

New Delhi: It was a day of mixed fortune for Parimarjan Negi as his disappointing loss against Grandmaster Marat Dzhumaev in the fifth round overshadowed his mornings stupendous win over GM Ziaur Rahman in the Parsvnath International Open Chess Tournament here on Tuesday. 

Negi, the countrys youngest-ever GM-norm holder in hunt for a second norm here, lost to the Uzbek playing white with modern defence, a strategy which had brought him success against Bangladeshi Rahman. 

Alexei Fedorov and R. Dzhumaev shared the lead with a cent per cent record, while a hoard of players were trailing behind, half a point adrift on 4.5. 

GM R.B. Ramesh, who played a long game to clinch a win in the fourth round, quickly settled for a draw with IM S. Arun Prasad, slipping to joint second spot in the evening. 

National champion Surya Sekhar Ganguly came back into reckoning with two straight wins on Tuesday after his Mondays draw, while IM Vishal Sareens juggernaut was halted by a veteran IM B. S. Sivanandan. 

Dzhumaev was in top form against junior national champion and GM-norm holder Deep Sengupta in his previous round game.

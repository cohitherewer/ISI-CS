Calcutta: Perhaps Maharashtra got their calculation wrong on Christmas morning. Opting for first strike after Sairaj Bahutule called correctly proved to be a disaster for the visiting team on Day One of the Ranji Super League tie at the Eden Gardens. 

Deep Dasgupta summed up it up aptly after Maharashtra closed Day One on 171 for seven. It was a good toss to lose, said Deep Dasgupta. 

Bahutule and coach Chandrakant Pandit couldnt fathom how deadly debutant Sourav Sarkar roped in to create problems for four southpaws in the Maharashtra top order. Sourav, who had an amazing run in Bengals C.K. Nayudu Trophy-winning campaign with a haul of 30 wickets in eight games, claimed four for 38 on Monday. 

Sourav opened his Ranji account with the dismissal of a left-hander Dheeraj Jadhav who had been Maharashtras batting mainstay with a tally of 309 from three innings including a 171, till Monday. 

He, however, would will like to forget his innings against Bengal. Having repeatedly beaten the outside edge, Sourav got the prized scalp off the last ball of his third over. The Punekar hadnt opened his account after facing 18 deliveries. Dheeraj, who had been included in the Test squad during Australias tour of 2004-05, edged one to the third slip (Manoj Tewari). 

The second ball of Souravs next over accounted for the other opener. Mansingh Nigde, who was given a chance in place of regular opener Harshad Khadiwale, was caught plumb in front to a typical Sourav in-swinger. 

It did not take Bengal long to push Maharashtra into a deeper hole. This time Ashok Dinda chipped in, showing the exit door to Yogesh Takawale in the 23rd over. Having come to the limelight after a brilliant unbeaten half-century against Australia in a practice match ahead of the Champions Trophy, Yogesh too was dismissed cheaply. 

A change in end proved to be lucky for Ranadeb Bose. Wicketless in his first spell (8-1-15-0) from the Pavilion end, Ranadebs second spell (from the High Court end) saw him come register 4-2-13-2, which included a hattrick chance. His first ball of the 26th over sent Maharashtras last match hero Hrishikesh Kanitkar to the pavillion, the second ball claimed Pratik Desai (who was brought in place of Maharashtra U-19 skipper Nikhil Paradkar). 

The top and middle-order collapse was some sort of a dj vu for Maharashtra, the team tumbling to 71 for six in 39.5 overs. Their great middle order collapse during Australian coach Darren Holders stint was still fresh in memory.When it seemed the hosts would wrap up the innings before tea, Maharashtras Tamil Nadu-recruit Sridharan Sriram (batting on 51) came up with a steady knock and a 99-run seventh-wicket stand with wicketkeeper Satyajit Satbhai.

 Lanka tighten noose on NZ

Wellington: Sri Lanka took a firm grip on the second Test against New Zealand on Saturday as they built an overall 363-run lead with five wickets remaining in a confident second innings batting spree. 

A half-century from Chamara Silva (79 batting), with Prasanna Jaywardene on 22, helped the visiting islanders to 225 for five after the hosts were skittled out for just 130 in the morning session. 

New Zealand slumped from their overnight 66 for four to 130 all out, giving the tourists a first-innings lead of 138. 

Spinner Muttiah Muralidharan claimed four wickets and paceman Lasith Malinga completed a five-wicket haul as New Zealand were dismissed in just 39.1 overs.

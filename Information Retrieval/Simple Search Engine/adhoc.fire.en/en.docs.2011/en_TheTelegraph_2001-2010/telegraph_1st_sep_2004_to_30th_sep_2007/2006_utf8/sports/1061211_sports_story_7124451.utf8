 Sania blows away Korean rival 

 - Paes, Bhupathi have it easy 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: For the first time, Sania Mirza had to play in front of near empty stands. Under a blazing sun at the Khalifa Tennis and Squash Complex, there were not many to watch Sania Mirza in action when she reached the quarter finals of the womens singles in the Asian Games. 

Sania, however, was in good form and posted a 6-1, 6-4 victory over South Koreas Yu Mi, who proved no match to her Indian rival. 

There were little doubts about Sanias superiority right from the very beginning. After the Korean held her serve, Sania seized control to win eight games in a row. 

The Indian girl was good in both service and groundstrokes. The Korean double-faulted at set point to lose the first set in just 18 minutes. She had nothing better to offer in the second set except for the fact that she won four games. She tried to engage Sania in long rallies, but the trick didnt work for long. 

Sania expressed worry about the tight schedule. I also have to think about the doubles. It is very tiring to play more than two matches each day, and I have to play three today, she said. 

 The schedule took its toll on the Indians when Shikha Uberoi conceded her singles second-round match against the second seed Zheng Jie due to exhaustion. She was trailing 0-4 at that point. 

Later, Sania and Shikha lost their doubles pre-quarter final match to Japans Ryoko Fuda and Tomoko Yonemura 3-6, 6-7 (6-8). The Indians were the third seeds in the tournament. 

Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi won their doubles second round game with ease. The top-seeded Indians beat Mohammed Ghareeb and Ahmad Mohammad of Kuwait 6-1, 6-1 in 55 minutes. In mens singles, Wang Yeu Tzuoo of Chinese Taipei defeated Karan Rastogi 2-6, 7-5, 7-5. 

In the evening, Leander Paes and Sania Mirza reached the semi-finals of the mixed doubles with a 6-4, 6-3 win over Ratiwatana and Tangphong of Thailand. 

In chess, the Indian trio of K. Sasikiran, P. Harikrishna and Koneru Humpy overcame China 3-0. 

In boxing, India had to remain happy with a bronze as Vijender Kumar lost to Bakhtiyar Artayev in 75kg. While archers too didnt do too well at the Lusail range, the rugby team suffered a 0-41 defeat against China.

Toronto: Third seed Argentine David Nalbandian went out of the Toronto Masters in the first round on Monday when he was beaten 1-6, 2-6 by grey-haired Italian Davide Sanguinetti. 

The burly Nalbandian was completely outclassed by the 33-year-old qualifier, who needed just 58 minutes to collect his first win in three attempts on Canadian hard courts. 

In other first-round action, fourth seed Ivan Ljubicic of Croatia eased passed Spains Nicolas Almagro 7-5, 6-1 and fifth seed James Blake needed just 56 minutes to crush the hopes of hometown favourite 17-year-old Canadian Philip Bester 6-4, 6-1. 

In contrast, Argentinas Jose Acasuso needed more than two hours and an epic second set tie-break to beat Germanys Bjorn Phau 7-5, 7-6 (20-18). 

The tie-break equalled the longest on the ATP Tour record books. It marks the fifth time a singles tie-break had gone the record distance first reached by Bjorn Borg and Premjit Lall at Wimbledon in 1973. 

Nalbandian attributed his early exit to a fever that he said left him short of energy. I had a headache, maybe a little bit of fever, said Nalbandian. Didnt feel really good to try to push myself to play good. 

Czech Tomas Berdych, seeded 13, advanced with a 6-4 7-5 win over Canadas Daniel Nestor, while 15th seed Fernando Gonzalez of Chile scraped past Swedens Robin Soderline 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. 

Ninth seed and Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis joined Nalbandian at the exit after falling 5-7, 6-2, 6-3 Julien Benneteau of France. 

Britains Tim Henman breezed past Swedens Jonas Bjorkman 6-2, 6-3. Greg Rusedski, however, lost 4-6, 2-6 to Russian Mikhail Youzhny. 

Spains Carlos Moya brushed past Argentinas Gaston Gaudio 6-1, 6-4, while Thomas Johansson withstood 18 aces from Feliciano Lopez of Spain to win 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, while Richard Gasquet defeated Fabrice Santoro 6-4, 6-3. Thirteenth seed Tomas Berdych was a 6-4, 7-5 winner over Daniel Nestor of Canada. (AGENCIES)

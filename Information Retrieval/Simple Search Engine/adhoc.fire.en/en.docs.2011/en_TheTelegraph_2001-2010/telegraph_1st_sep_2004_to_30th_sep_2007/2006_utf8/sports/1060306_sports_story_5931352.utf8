 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 U-19 Asian Cup Qualifiers

 New Delhi: Sixteen-year-old 

 Sasmita Malik from Orissa struck four goals, including a 

 hattrick, as India registered a 7-0 triumph over Kyrgyzstan 

 in the under-19 Asian Cup womens football qualifiers 

 at the Ambedkar Stadium on Sunday.

 India dominated the show throughout 

 and could have won by many more goals. While Sasmita scored 

 the fourth, fifth, sixth and the seventh goals, pint-sized 

 Manipur girl Lal Varmoihmar got the other three.

 Coached by former international 

 Harjinder Singh, India will play Bangladesh next on Thursday 

 in the three-team group.

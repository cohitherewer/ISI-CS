 Jeev slips to tied eighth

Hokkaido: Jeev Milkha Singh returned a card of two-over 74 in the third round to slip from overnight tied third to tied eighth in the Sun Chlorella Classic Golf meet. 

The lead is held by Tetsuji Hiratsuka of Japan, who carded a four-under 68 and moved to six-under on a tough course in hot conditions. 

Jeev started the day at three-under. He opened with a birdie but gave it back on the third before going through the next 12 holes with pars. 

However, Jeev faltered on the 16th. He double bogeyed and dropped another stroke on 17th, just as he had on the first day. He is now four-over for the 16th in three days. (PTI)

 BTC, trainers at loggerheads 

 SRIMAX

 Bangalore: The Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) and trainers are at loggerheads. The summer season is scheduled to start from Saturday but nobody seems to be sure in view of doubts after enmass surrender of license by the BTC trainers. As a result of this, entries for the weekend races have been kept on hold.

 Trainers are protesting and the issue pertains to the payment of provident fund to syces. The newly incorporated clause on issuance of license holds trainers responsible for syces liabilities for the past, present and for the future.

 A Karnataka Trainers Association member, who did not want to be identified, said: BTC is trying to play it safe as the matter relating to the provident fund payment is already in the court. 

 All parties concerned will meet on Wednesday morning to sort out the issue.

 Another revamp in support staff likely

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: The support staff of the Indian football team is set to undergo yet another change on the eve of the Asian Cup match against Japan to be played in Bangalore on October 11. The national camp begins in Bangalore on October 1. 

According to All India Football Federation (AIFF) sources, Services coach Stanley Rozario and Aslam Khan, both from Bangalore, are likely to replace assistant coaches Mauricio Afonso and Savio Medeira of Goa, who did duty in the last two home and away outings against Saudi Arabia. Goalkeepers coach Marcus Pacheco, however, is likely to continue with the team. 

Interestingly, national coach Bob Houghton has been talking about having permanent support staff from the very beginning of his tenure, but is yet to get it. 

Last week, at the emergency committee meeting of the AIFF, Houghton said he needed a group of coaches, who would also do the talent hunting according to his choice and ideas. 

AIFF is believed to have failed to acquire the services of Afonso as the former India skipper will be coaching Goa for the Santosh Trophy. Savio Medeira has not been released by his employers, Salgaocar.

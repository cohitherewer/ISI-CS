 Salgaocar in quarters

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Francis Fernandes rose to the occasion for Salgaocar SC, heading home the matchwinner against JCT in Tuesdays second match of the Federation Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium. Salgaocars 1-0 win means they will now take on another Goan rivals, Sporting Clube de Goa, in the quarter final. 

What promised to be a quality contest didnt quite rise to its billing, though Salgaocar held the sway over their rivals and returned the deserving winners. JCT failed essentially on two counts. Their midfield failed to link up with the attackers and on some occasions, when they managed to get to the rivals box, they spoiled the chances by unnecessarily playing too many passes among themselves. 

Salgaocar defenders also kept a close vigil on the dangerous Chidi Edeh as the Nigerian was hardly allowed any free space in and around the box. Then towards the end, when Salgaocar had started showing signs of tiredness, the extra initiatives from JCTs end were missing. 

However, much like the Sporting Clube de Goa-Army XI match, which preceded their encounter under lights, JCT came close to scoring in the very first minute. But the Salgaocar goalkeeper Milagrio Medeira prevented Baldeep Singh from doing an Ernest Jeremiah with a five save. 

However, that early moment of anxiety was enough warning for Salgaocar to come out of their slumber. They settled down slowly and steadily, controlling the midfield. This also enabled the Goan outfit to dictate terms and show more positive intent in the attacking third. 

Felix Chimaokwu was instrumental in providing sparks to their raids. He laid it off for Jerose Oliueira in the 23rd minute, but the latter took the ball to too acute an angle to get a proper sight of the goal. Then, in the 36th minute, Felix sent the ball back towards the edge of the box after having outsprinted two rival defenders down the left, but both Fernandes and Francis Andrare failed to compliment their teammates effort. 

On came another attack, three minutes later, when Fernandes shot took a defection off JCT defender Anwar Singh, who saw with bated breath the ball missing the goal by inches. 

JCTs offensives, on the other hand, were heavily depended on setpiece moves, especially corners and free-kicks by the unpretentious Rennedy Singh. However, with Chidi heavily marked and Sunil Chhetri struggling to beat much taller rivals in the air, those attacks never reached their destination. 

Fernandes huffing and puffing inside the box finally paid off after the break. JCT upped their tempo in the second half, but the Salgaocar midfielder dashed their hopes in the 52nd minute. Following a throw-in, Rocus Lamare promptly crossed the ball towards the box. Fernandes outjumped everybody to nod home. 

JCT coach Sukhwinder Singh reinforced his attacking line having Sunday Ambrose been replaced by Praveen Kumar soon after the break. But Savio Medeiras side held their fort with strong will and character. Fernandes goal at that time also provided them with the much-needed boost to fight on with last dregs of their energy.

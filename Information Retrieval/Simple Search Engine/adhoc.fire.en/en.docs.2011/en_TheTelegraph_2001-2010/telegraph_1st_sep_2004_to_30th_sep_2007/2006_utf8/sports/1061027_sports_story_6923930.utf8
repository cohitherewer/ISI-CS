 Johnson relishes challenge 

 Sharp Singles 

Chandigarh: Australias young pacer Mitchell Johnson admitted that bowling on Indian pitches was challenging, but said he would try to exploit the bounce which the Mohali track offered. It is always a challenge to bowl on Indian wickets. Wickets here are generally known to be batsmen-friendly. However, bowlers have been doing a good job in the (Champions Trophy) championship, Johnson said. 

 He said the swing bowlers got in Wednesdays match between Pakistan and New Zealand was encouraging and the pacers would be looking to exploit that. 

 Johnson said he regarded Sachin Tendulkar as a dangerous batsman who could change the match situation any time. 

 Referring to Sundays match in Mohali against India, he said it was going to be a new situation and a game with new setting. Johnson said the team was using the break between matches by practising and training hard in preparation for the big match.

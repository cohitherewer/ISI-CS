 Ageing France look underprepared

 - Dhorasoo should inspire Indian footballers to shed negative 

 thoughts

 On Target

 Shyam Thapa

Old is not always gold. So it turned out, with Zinedine Zidane and his fellow veterans failing to produce magic as they started their World Cup farewell campaign with a goalless draw against Switzerland on Tuesday. The 1998 champions looked underprepared and, with so many ageing players, they played predictable, old-time football and were found wanting in implementing plans with new ideas. 

It was akin to static football ? where the rhythm of the whole team was slow-paced and the moves were hardly constructed on speed and ideas. This was a very un-Frenchlike show and for the first time in this tournament, I saw one of my favourites failing to rise to the occasion. 

The French defence looked suspect, the midfield was sans ideas, save a few moves from Zidane, and the much-acclaimed Thierry Henry lacked cutting edge. 

Switzerlands tactics were clearly aimed at slowing the pace and France fell into their trap. The former champions were, in fact, lucky to escape with a draw as Switzerland missed a couple of chances from close range. 

All this could be attributed to the French having an off day in office. But when the whole team fails, it rings an alarm bell and the sooner the French old warhorses realise it, the better. 

Zidane did whatever he could, but Henry was an utter flop. The French striker has often been a one-man army for Arsenal, but whenever he plays for the country, his motivation level is suspect. Look, for example, at Leander Paes: Playing for the country has always been his motivation and, time and again, he has raised his game to a sublime level in Davis Cup. The same cant be said of Henry. 

This is the worlds biggest stage and like in 2002, Henry once again failed to produce anything positive when his country needed it the most. 

The match ? however dull and pedestrian it may have looked like ? will be remembered by us Indians for a special reason: Vikash Dhorasoo, the first player of Indian origin to feature in a World Cup finals, came in for Wiltord towards the end. He had a good attempt which missed the far post by a few inches. I feel the French coach should have introduced him earlier. 

Dhorasoo, despite having an Indian physique, is representing a team like France on the worlds biggest stage. His very presence in the field on Tuesday should be a big motivation for all Indian footballers. He should help banish all the negative thoughts about our physical deficiencies. 

Unlike France, another title-contenders Italy produced completely different football against Ghana on Monday night ? furiously fast and attacking. The Azzurris looked cohesive in all departments of the game and, true to their rich tradition, gave the world a glimpse of what they are capable of. 

In 2002, they had to bow out because of some controversial refereeing decisions in the gameagainst South Korea. If their first match in the 2006 campaign was anything to go by, they look determined to exorcise the ghost of South Korea. With a strong bench to fall back on, I can see Italy making the final. 

Debutants Ghana looked more and more confident as the match wore on. However, they were found wanting in finishing. Today one can see at least two-three African players in all the top European clubs and it only goes to show that they are influencing world football more profoundly than before. If these African teams can get the monetary strength like their European counterparts, the day is not far away when one of them lifts the coveted Cup.

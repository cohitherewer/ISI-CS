Mumbai: The proposed fitness test for Sachin Tendulkar, recuperating from a shoulder injury and currently in Chennai undergoing training and practice, has been put off by a few days. 

The fitness test would be held in Mumbai on either May 22 or 23 and it would be done in the presence of Andrew Leipus (former Team India physio) and Kiran More (national selection panel chief), Board secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

The fitness test had earlier been scheduled for Saturday. The squad for the Tests will be selected on May 24. 

Leipus, who is in Mumbai, would leave for Chennai on Tuesday 

Along with Sachin, opener Wasim Jaffer, who underwent a shin surgery last month, would also undergo a fitness test ahead of the selection committee meeting. 

Meanwhile, Sachin on Monday arrived in Chennai to train and practise at the MRF Pace Academy. 

On the importance of the West Indies tour, Sachin said: It is an exciting tour. Playing cricket is exciting to be short and sweet whether you play in the West Indies or New Zealand or South Africa. You do not want to miss cricket. 

Sachin also said that Brian Lara wanted him to visit the West Indies. 

We had lunch together in Mumbai. He was looking forward to my coming to the West Indies. He was saying this many times. I hope he is a good host. 

On being asked about his experiences in the West Indies, and the chances of the present side, Sachin said that the team has the firepower to put on a good show. 

I think if I am not mistaken, we won the one day series in the Caribbean last time and losing at Barbados was a nightmare. It took me a long time to overcome that. 

But I am sure that our present team will put up a very good performance. I have no doubt that we will come back with flying colours, he said. 

When asked about the burnout issue, Sachin said: Each one should be judged differently. There are youngsters, senior players, fast bowlers and spinners. The workloads are different to each of them. We just have to find the right balance. Sometimes, you want a break, the player should take some time off just to recharge his batteries. 

To get fresh mentally and physically it is important. The selectors, the coach and the captain would know particularly the state of the individual players and they are the right persons to figure out who are not needed to be selected.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 What does our PM do: Rathore

New Delhi: Olympic silver-medallist shooter Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore said on Sunday that Indian fans do not support their heroes as they should. 

Indian fans do not give adulation to sportspersons unless they perform at the highest level. In this scenario, it is very difficult to keep going and motivate yourself to give your best, Rathore said. 

The Army marksman said people should understand that winning an Olympic medal is not a routine thing. A medal is like 300 runs in cricket. It is not possible every time. 

Indian crickets latest sensation Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has shot to world No. 1 in one-day batsmens rankings, had said recently that sportspersons needed their fans support when they were going through a bad phase. 

Rathore said what mattered most for a sportsperson was that he stayed among the best in his sport. 

My plateau is always among the top six-seven (shooters) and I am happy to be there. There are many who will never be among even the top 10 or top 50, said the world No. 6. 

Our competition is with the shooters of US and Australia, who are even economically better off than us. 

We can compete with them in economy as the government chalks out plans, but what do our Prime Ministers do for sport? So, charting our own path and sustaining it is a big thing. 

Rathore admitted that he felt the pressure to perform as a billion people pin their hopes on him. It is not easy to perform in international competitions. It is rather difficult to defend your title, he said.

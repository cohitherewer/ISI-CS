 Pathan injury not serious: Doctor

Vadodara: Irfan Pathan, who suffered a minor cut in his right hand, is all right and would be available for Indias next outing in the ICC Champions Trophy. 

He had a minor cut in the forearm of his right hand. He might have sustained it from some glass splinter at home. We have done the dressing and it is nothing major. He is alright now, said Sachin Saha, a plastic surgeon, who saw Pathan in his hospital on Friday morning. 

India are slated to play the West Indies on Thursday next in Ahmedabad. 

Baroda Cricket Association secretary and former chief selector Kiran More said Pathan is practising daily and would attend the nets today as well. 

There is nothing to worry about. It is a very minor injury. He is coming to the ground everyday, More said.

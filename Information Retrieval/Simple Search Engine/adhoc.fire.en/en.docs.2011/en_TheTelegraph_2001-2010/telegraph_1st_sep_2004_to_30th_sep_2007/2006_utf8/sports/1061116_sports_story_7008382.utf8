 Bangla govt clears TV deal

Dhaka: The Bangladesh government on Wednesday cleared a record $56 million television rights agreement with a Singapore-based company after a row over the deal led to the resignation of the countrys cricket chief. 

The government approved the television deal with Nimbus Sports International yesterday (Tuesday) and instantly we informed the company about the clearance, said Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) secretary Mahbub Anam. 

Nimbus last week beat its nearest rival, Zee Telefilms, by over $23 million to win the rights to broadcast international cricket matches played in Bangladesh until 2012. 

BCB president Ali Asghar had resigned on Tuesday after the government failed to sign the deal within an agreed time frame.

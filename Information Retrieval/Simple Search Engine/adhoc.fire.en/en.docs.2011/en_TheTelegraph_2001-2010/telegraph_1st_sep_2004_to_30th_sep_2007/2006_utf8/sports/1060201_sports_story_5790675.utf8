 Rahul erases Limbas record

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Rahul Banerjee of Jharkhand set a national record on the second day of the 26th Senior National Archery Championship (Fita) at the SAI complex on Tuesday. 

Rahul, younger brother of ace archer Dola Banerjee, set the record in the mens 50m recurve category by aggregating 341 points. He thus broke a long-standing record ? that of Limba Ram who had notched up 332 at the 1991 nationals in Calcutta. Overnight leader and Rahuls statemate, Jayanta Talukdar, rewrote the national record in the overall category. 

In the womens compound event, Jhanu Hansda was at the top of her form. 

She rewrote her own national records ? in the overall, 50m and 30m categories.

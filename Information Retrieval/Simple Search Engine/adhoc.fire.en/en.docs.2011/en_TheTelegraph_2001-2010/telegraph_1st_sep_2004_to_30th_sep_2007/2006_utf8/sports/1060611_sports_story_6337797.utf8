 Madugalle to train Jawagal Srinath

 - Indian to be sent to an England-Pak Test 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: Former Sri Lankan captain Ranjan Madugalle, the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Chief Match Referee, is going to train rookie Jawagal Srinath during the forthcoming England versus Pakistan Test series in England. 

We havent decided on which of the four Tests is to serve as a training ground, but Srinath will be sent to one, ICC general manager (cricket) Dave Richardson told The Telegraph on Saturday. 

Madugalle is the Match Referee for the series. 

The first Test, at Lords, is from July 13. Thats going to be followed by Old Trafford (from July 27), Headingley (from August 4) and The Oval (from August 17). 

Srinath, at 36 the youngest among eight Elite panel Match Referees, got appointed a couple of months ago. His appointment, though, wasnt well received by sections within the Pakistan Cricket Board as it had made four recommendations. 

Pakistan has gone unrepresented on the panel since Wasim Rajas exit. 

Im looking forward to interacting with Ranjan? Sitting with him in the Match Referees chamber should be a nice learning experience, is what Srinath said in the evening. 

Ive already been briefed by Richardson and Doug Cowie (the Match Referees and umpires manager)? It took place in Dubai last month, the one-time Team India quick added. 

The briefing, at the world bodys HQ, focused on responsibilities and conduct. 

Srinath is a Tier-II Match Referee and, so, wont be given assignments throughout the year. Clive Lloyd and Alan Hurst are in the same category. 

Madugalle, Mike Procter, Jeff Crowe, Chris Broad and Roshan Mahanama are in Tier-I. 

Srinath is the second Indian, after fellow-Bangalorean (and former India captain) Gundappa Viswanath, to make the Elite panel.

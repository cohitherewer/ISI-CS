 Jharkhand too good for Orissa 

OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Dhanbad: Jharkhand opened their campaign with a 39-run victory over Orissa in another match, held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Jealgora Stadium on Sunday. 

Chasing a target of 232, Orissa collapsed in the 43rd over with a total of 193. The win will certainly boost Jharkhands morale ahead of their crucial tie against Bengal at the same venue on Monday. 

Orissa captain Debashish Mohanty won the toss and elected to ball. Jharkhand lost wickets at regular intervals and managed a modest total of 232 for eight in 50 overs. 

Orissa suffered an early hiccup, losing BBCC Mahapatra in the second ball of their innings. Niranjan Behera scored a half-century before he was run out in the 37th over, but no other batsman had shown any patience and perseverance to assist him in the chase. 

Meanwhile, S.S. Rao, who spearheads Jharkhand attack, pulled out of the match owing to a back injury. He left for Ranchi to undergo an MRI scan and his availability against Bengal would be known after his return. 

Brief scores 

Jharkhand 232/8 in 50 ovs (Chandra Mohan Jha 64, Rajiv Kumar 37; Sanjoy Satpathy 3/35). Orissa 193 all out in 42.2 ovs (Niranjan Behera 56; Shahid Khan 3/28, Mihir Diwakar 2/30). Jharkhand won by 39 runs.

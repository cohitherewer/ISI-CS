The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Quick Takes

 Clinton: Defence more important than 

 offence

 Berlin: Former US President 

 Bill Clinton, who watched his first live game when Italy 

 and France played the final at Berlin Olympic Stadium, said 

 sometimes defence was more important than offence in the 

 game. Ive watched a lot of the games, on TV 

 of course ? this is the first one live... You have to play 

 strategically when you are in an elimination situation; 

 you cant make it as exciting all the time. You have 

 to play with discipline, and sometimes defence is more important 

 than offence, the 59-year-old was quoted as saying 

 by the Fifa website.

 Algerian village saddened

 Aguemoune: In the Algerian 

 mountains where Zinedine Zidanes parents grew up, 

 fans gathered in the Cafe Zizo to watch the 

 French stars farewell show. It wasnt what they 

 expected. We are very disappointed, he said. 

 He should have kept his cool, said one of them. 

 Because of him we love France, Zidanes 

 cousin Rabah said outside the family home, a new, modest 

 structure.

 Campioni del Mondo!

 Rome: Delirious Italians 

 poured into streets and piazzas on Sunday night to dance, 

 sing and hug each other as they screamed three words: Campioni 

 del Mondo! Within seconds of the fifth successful penalty-kick 

 going in, fireworks were shooting into the sky, foghorns 

 were being blasted and even police were sounding their sirens. 

 In Romes Circus Maximus, where a flag-waving crowd 

 of about 200,000 gathered to witness the match, the air 

 was thick with red smoke from flares. We did it! We 

 did it! they said.

 Beetle takes a plunge

 Berlin: The bidding price 

 for the 39-year-old Volkswagen Beetle that once belonged 

 to Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann has plunged after the 

 seller introduced strict controls to exclude non-genuine 

 bids. The top bidding price for the 1967 VW convertible 

 fell from a quoted 300,050 euros on Saturday to 5,605 euros 

 on Monday ahead of Tuesdays close of bidding after 

 interested parties were required to register and prove they 

 were serious. 

 Scolari wants to stay

 Lisbon: Portugals 

 Brazilian-born coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said on Sunday 

 he wanted to stay in the job, Portuguese news agency Lusa 

 reported. I want to stay, yes, Scolari said 

 after the return of the Portugal side from Germany on Sunday. 

 I have a marvellous squad, it is a situation to be 

 studied. As of Wednesday or Thursday we will talk, 

 Scolari said.

Calcutta: With arch-rivals East Bengal finishing at the second spot, Mohun Bagan are now eyeing the third spot in the in the National League. 

After scripting an upset win against champions Mahindra United, the green-and-maroon camps are looking for nothing other than a win when they take on Mohammedan Sporting at the Salt Lake Stadium on Tuesday. 

We will obviously go for a win as we want to finish the league at a respectable position. It is also going to be a prestige issue for us as in the last encounter we lost to Mohammedan Sporting, said Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya after the teams practice session at the club ground on Tuesday. 

But Bhattacharya is going to miss some key players like captain Mehtab Hussain, A. S. Firoze, Mehrajuddin Wadao, Eduardo Coelho, goalkeeper Subrata Pal, all due to injuries. 

For the black-and-whites also the picture is not very different for their opponents as well. 

Mohammedan Sporting, who are on 14 points from 15 matches, are still facing relegation threat and are desperate to take one point from the match and are also going to miss the services of some of its key players. I am just thinking to get one point from the match to get my team out of the danger zone, said coach Subhash Bhowmick on Tuesday. 

Okonji Patrick, Mir Farooque Hyder and Satyajit Bose will Tuesdays match due to double bookings while Palash Karmakar is out with injury.

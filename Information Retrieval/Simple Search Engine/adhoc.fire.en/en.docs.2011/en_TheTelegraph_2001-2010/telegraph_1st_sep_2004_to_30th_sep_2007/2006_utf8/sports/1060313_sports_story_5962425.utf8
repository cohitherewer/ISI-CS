Madrid: Real Madrid had to settle for a 0-0 draw at Valencia in the Primera Liga on Saturday after substitute Ronaldo spurned a golden opportunity to give his side victory when he missed a last-minute penalty. 

The Brazilian, who was dropped to the bench by Real coach Juan Ramon Lopez Caro, earned the spot-kick after he was fouled by Santiago Canizares but the Valencia goalkeeper atoned for his error when he saved Ronaldos low shot. 

Barcelona top the table on 61 points, Valencia and Real have 52 and Osasuna are six further back with 46. 

Earlier, Celta Vigo missed their chance to move into the Champions League places when they lost 2-0 at 10-man Espanyol. 

The defeat meant the Galicians, who had won four of their last five games, remain fifth a point behind Osasuna. 

Sociedad are now five points clear of the relegation zone, although their immediate rivals have yet to play this weekend. 

He also left out forwards Antonio Cassano and Robinho, choosing instead to play Raul and Julio Baptista up front. 

But the changes failed to add more spark to the Real attack and scoring chances were scarce in the first half as the sides battled hard in midfield and got plenty of men behind the ball. 

The first clear opportunity did not come until just before the break when Valencia striker David Villa had a goal-bound free kick tipped over the bar by Iker Casillas. 

Valencia continued their pressing game in midfield in the second half and although Real had more possession they had problems getting near the opposition area. 

Lopez Caro sent Ronaldo on in place of Raul just after the hour, although it was his strike partner Baptista who almost opened the scoring a few minutes later. 

The Italian had a hand in winning the penalty when he exchanged a neat one-two with Ronaldo a minute from time. The Brazilian was felled by Canizares as he burst towards goal but was then denied his 11th goal of the season when the Valencia keeper went the right way to save his spot kick. 

Meanwhile, Inter Milan striker Adriano ended a 10-match goal drought when he snatched the winner in a 1-0 victory over Sampdoria on Saturday. 

Adrianos goal, his first since scoring twice in a 3-2 triumph over Cagliari on January 15, left Inter third in Serie A with 62 points from 29 matches, 11 behind leaders Juventus who are yet to play weekend game against second-placed AC Milan. 

Elsewhere, Bayern Munich and Werder Bremen suffered hangovers in the Bundesliga on Saturday after their painful Champions League exits. 

Leaders Bayern were held to a 0-0 draw at VfL Wolfsburg while second-placed Werder were thrashed 0-3 at home by Hertha Berlin.

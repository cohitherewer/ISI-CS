 Crime to keep Sourav out

 - India not picking best team: Ranatunga 

 Arjuna Ranatunga 

Colombo: Arjuna Ranatunga said on Thursday he was amazed that Sourav Ganguly has been continuously ignored by the Indian selectors. 

I simply cant understand how such a good player can be kept out of the side. Building up for the future is fine, but not at the expense of experience, Ranatunga said. 

Former captain Sourav last played for India in January in a Test against Pakistan, while his last ODI appearance was over a year ago. 

I wonder whether it (his dropping) has got anything to do with performance. There can be issues within the side, but the country comes first and all these petty things are immaterial, said Ranatunga, Sri Lankas only World Cup-winning captain. 

India have lost back-t-back ODIs in South Africa by margins of more than 100 runs. A three-Test series will follow the five-game one-day series. 

Ganguly is a match-winner and we had the utmost respect for him when we played against India, said the 42-year-old Ranatunga, who had backed Sourav before also. 

As captain, he showed a lot of aggression as well, and its he who showed recent Indian teams how to be ruthless. He certainly has been the toughest Indian captain in recent times, Ranatunga said. 

I feel sorry for India. Its a crime to keep out such a talented player, and I dont think India are picking their best team at the moment. 

The instances he must have missed out on personal landmarks, for the sake of the team, are numerous. I love those types of players and teams need them, said Ranatunga. 

He also said India were capable of winning next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

No team has such a batting line-up. When you have Sachin (Tendulkar), (Virender) Sehwag, (Sourav) Ganguly, (Mohammed) Kaif, Yuvraj (Singh), (Rahul) Dravid and (Mahendra) Dhoni, you can chase any target. 

Its like our batting line-up when we won the (1996) World Cup, said Ranatunga, a left-handed middle-order batsman who scored 5,105 runs in 93 Tests and 7,456 in 269 ODIs.

 Cup fears grow for Michael Owen

Given that Sven-Goran Eriksson has long maintained that prospects for England success at the World Cup finals will be determined by the extent of his injury list, there can only be distress at Michael Owen suffering a setback in his recuperation from a fractured metatarsal. While the striker hopes to be playing again within four weeks, he now has little scope to prove his fitness before Germany. 

Owen on Friday night underwent what his club described as a minor procedure at a Manchester hospital to tighten a screw that was inserted in his foot last January. The forward has not appeared for Newcastle United since he suffered the problem at White Hart Lane on New Years eve and although his mood remains upbeat, he can scarcely afford another breakdown before the tournament. 

The news will be troublesome for the England head coach. If all goes to plan, Owen will be training inside two or three weeks and the 26-year-old aims to return to the Newcastle first team for the home game against West Bromwich Albion on April 22. He would then have only two more competitive matches before the end of the season ?? against Birmingham City and Chelsea ?? in which to hone his conditioning. 

Eriksson will announce his provisional 26-man World Cup squad on May 8, a week before the official Fifa deadline, when three standby players will be discarded. England then play friendly internationals against Hungary on May 30 and Jamaica on June 3, and while, theoretically, Owen should be fresh for his sides start to the competition the next weekend, he can hardly hope to have reached peak form. 

The specialists have said that everything is healing fine ?? but to speed the process they need to tighten the screw they inserted in January, Owen, who had complained of feeling pain in his foot this week and subsequently had a scan on Thursday, said. It is a simple process and should ensure that I am back playing for Newcastle before the end of the season. 

If Owen returns against West Bromwich, he will not have kicked a ball in anger for 16 weeks, four more than his surgeons most optimistic prognosis at the time of the original injury. As Englands chief attacking threat and a world-class talent who inspires fear and respect from opponents ?? he has scored 35 goals in 75 appearances for his country ?? his continuing absence is alarming. 

It also heralds more gloom for a club that paid Real Madrid a record ?16.5million for him last August. Owen has scored seven times in his ten league games for Newcastle, but his goal ratio is balanced by the scarcity of his appearances in a black-and-white shirt.

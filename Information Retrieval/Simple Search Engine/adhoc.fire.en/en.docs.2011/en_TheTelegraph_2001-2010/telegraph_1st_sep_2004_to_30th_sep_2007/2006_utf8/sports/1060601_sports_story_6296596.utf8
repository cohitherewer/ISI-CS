Paris: Roger Federer was better than the weather. On a third consecutive damp, chilly day at the French Open, the top-ranked Federer endured two rain delays while beating Alejandro Falla 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 in the second round on Wednesday. 

 The two delays totalled one hour and 31 minutes. The match lasted only one hour and 26 minutes.A Colombian ranked 139th, Falla lost in qualifying and made the draw only because another player pulled out. He now has the distinction of losing to Federer at two major events ? their only previous meeting came in the second round at Wimbledon in 2004. 

Fourth seeded Maria Sharapova, recovering from an ankle injury she aggravated last week, moved well on the Centre Court clay and beat Iveta Benesova 6-4, 6-1. 

With cool temperatures, an early start paid off for No. 6 Nikolay Davydenko. He became the first man to reach the third round when Flavio Saretta retired with the flu trailing 6-2, 4-1. 

 Another Russian, No. 14-seeded Dinara Safina, beat Hana Sromova 6-0, 6-2. Safina hit 31 winners, including six aces. 

 Safinas older brother, two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin, was fined $10,000 on Wednesday for failing to hold a post-match news conference after losing in the opening round to Fernando Gonzalez. The ninth-seeded won the match 6-3 1-6 6-3 6-1. 

 No. 24 Katarina Srebotnik beat Ashley Harkleroad 6-3, 6-2, leaving three Americans in the womens draw. No. 25 Marion Bartoli and No. 27 Anna Chakvetadze were eliminated. Jelena Jankovic beat Bartoli 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, while Li Na beat Chakvetadze 7-5, 6-3. No. 30 Carlos Moya beat Mikhail Youzhny 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. 

Meanwhile, Mahesh Bhupathi and Xavier Malisse of Belarus registered an easy 6-2, 6-2 victory over Gilles Muller of Luxemburg and Christophe Rochus of Belarus to move into the second round.

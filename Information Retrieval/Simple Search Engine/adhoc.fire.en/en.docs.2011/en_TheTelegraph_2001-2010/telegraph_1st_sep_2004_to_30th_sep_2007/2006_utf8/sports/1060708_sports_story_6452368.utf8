 Series win extra special: Kumble

 - I hope to cash in on the experience: VRV 

 Munaf Patel on arrival in Mumbai on Friday 

New Delhi/Mumbai: Some of the Indian players arrived home Friday after their successful Test series in the West Indies. Pacers Irfan Pathan, Munaf Patel and off-spinner Ramesh Powar arrived in Mumbai. 

The teams support staff, Ian Frazer, Greg King and Ramesh Mane also came along with them via London. 

Vikram Rajvir Singh and Suresh Raina arrived in Delhi. 

Anil Kumble, back in Bangalore, said the Test series victory was one of the high points of his 16-year international career. 

Kumble took six second-innings wickets as the touring side won the fourth and final Test in Jamaica by 49 runs to clinch a 1-0 series triumph on Sunday, Indias first in the Caribbean for 35 years. 

It is very satisfying since I have had to wait all this time for this moment, the 35-year-old said from Bangalore. 

This probably was my last Test series in West Indies so it was extra special. 

It was third time lucky for Kumble after two previous tours of the Caribbean. They werent really pleasant memories from my earlier trips, Kumble said. So it was important for me to achieve a victory and I am happy to have played a significant role. 

Kumble, who has signed to play for English county side Surrey later this season, said he was pleased to be contributing to Indias successes. Im happy to be playing my role whenever I get an opportunity, he said. 

At this point all I can say is Im feeling fit and strong and enjoying my cricket. 

Kumbles wife gave birth to a girl on Thursday. 

Meanwhile, having impressed as fill-in seamer on the recent tour, young fast bowler Vikram Rajvir Singh is hoping his place in Team India will become a permanent one in the days to come. 

It was great to be a part of the team that won a series in the West Indies for the first time in 35 years. I played a small role in that and I hope to cash in on the experience. Hopefully, I will become a regular player and make major contributions in the future, VRV said.

 Baros cleared to start training

Westerburg: Czech striker Milan Baros, who has missed the first two games with a foot injury, has been cleared to start running again, a team spokesman said on Sunday. 

But it was unclear if this meant there was a chance he could be fit for Thursdays Group E game against Italy. 

He will do only running on Monday, team spokesman Lukas Tucek said. It will be the first time Baros has done any running since sustaining the injury in a June 3 friendly. The only exercise he has done since is cycling, having tried unsuccessfully to take part in training with the help of painkillers. 

Meanwhile, Italy midfielder Simone Perrotta is doubtful for the match against the Czechs, the team doctor said on Sunday. 

Perrotta limped through the latter stages of Saturdays 1-1 draw with the US after picking up a leg injury in a challenge with defender Carlos Bocanegra. He could not go off because Italy had used all three substitutes. 

Germany defender Christoph Metzelder, meanwhile, should be fit to play Tuesday against Ecuador despite missing training on Sunday. 

Metzelder turned his right knee in training on Saturday and was unable to continue. He had treatment at the team hotel and went for a scan that revealed no serious damage.

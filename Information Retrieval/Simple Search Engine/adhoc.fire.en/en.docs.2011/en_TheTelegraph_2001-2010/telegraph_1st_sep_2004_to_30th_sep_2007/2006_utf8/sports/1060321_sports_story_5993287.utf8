Melbourne: It was a day of cheers for India with the shooters grabbing three more gold medals and the mens table tennis team creating history by becoming champions at the 18th Commonwealth Games here on Monday. 

Maintaining their rich harvest of medals, shooters led the show by winning an additional silver as India latched on to the third position behind hosts Australia and England on the fifth day of the competition. 

One more silver came from the weightlifting arena where Monica Laishram Devi raised the prospects of a golden finish before eventually settling for the second place in the womens 69kg event as Indias tally went up to 12 gold, eight silver and three bronze medals. 

England are ahead of India with 17 gold, 19 silver and 15 bronze, while powerhouse Australia continue to sit pretty at the top with 39 gold, 35 silver and 32 bronze medals. 

In table tennis, India pulled off a sensational upset over higher ranked Singapore to snatch the first-ever mens team gold. 

Shrugging off a 0-2 deficit, Subhajit Saha, Achanta Sharath Kamal and Soumyadeep Roy made a remarkable comeback to win the next three matches and dash Singapores hopes with a 3-2 upset. 

India started their title quest on a disastrous note as Soumyadeep was thrashed 0-3 by Yanz Zi in the opening match. 

Yang Zi registered a confident 11-5, 11-3, 11-8 win over Roy before Kamal went down to Li Xiao Cai 11-9, 9-11, 11-3, 7-11, 8-11 in a see-saw battle. 

With their backs to wall, national champion Subhajit Saha pulled off one against Jason Ho 3-1. Saha put up an inspiring performance to overpower Jason 10-12, 11-5, 11-7, 12-10.

At the shooting range, Samresh Jung claimed his third gold, teaming up with seasoned marksman Jaspal Rana in the 25m centre fire pistol pairs. 

Debutant Tejaswini Sawant hit the bulls eye to win womens 10m air rifle individual event for her second yellow metal. Avneet Kaur Sidhu, also making her first appearance at the Games, bagged the silver, as both the Indian girls equalled the Games record set by compatriot Anjali Bhagwat in Manchester four years ago. 

Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang clinched their second gold together in the Games, winning the mens 50m rifle three positions pairs event, as India led the medal tally in this discipline. 

Another table tennis bronze came from the womens team who pipped Canada 3-2 in the third-place play-off. 

The womens badminton team added another bronze to the kitty. Led by an inspirational show from teenage sensation Saina Nehwal, the Indian shuttlers bagged the bronze in mixed team event conquering fancied New Zealand 3-1. 

In the boxing ring, three Indian pugilists came closer to podium finish by storming into the quarter finals. 

Featherweight Diwakar Prasad, bantamweight Akhil Kumar and flyweight Jitender Kumar won their pre-quarter bouts in style during the day to join compatriots Vijender, Ajay Kumar and Verghese Johnson, who reached the last eight stage on Sunday. 

Indian men and women both registered big wins, albeit against weaker sides, in hockey to remain in contention for semi-final berths. 

While the men whipped Trinidad and Tobago 10-1, their women counterparts made short work of Nigeria 8-0. 

In track and field, Vikas Gowda came up with his personal best by heaving the iron to a distance of 18.46m, but that could fetch him only a fifth place in mens shot put, while Jaisha Orchatteri finished seventh in womens 1500m. 

In mens 20 km walk, Jalan Parayil occupied the fifth place with a timing of 1 hour, 30 mins and 43 seconds, while the womens event saw Deepamala Devi get the sixth spot clocking 1 hour, 41 min and 54 seconds.

 We are ready for bouncers, says Dhoni

Bangalore: Flamboyant wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni on Monday challenged Pakistan to attack Indian batsmen with bouncers and short-pitched deliveries in the upcoming series. 

We are ready for it (bouncers and short-pitched deliveries). If they think that Indians are vulnerable, they should try it. We are ready to face all the bouncers and short-pitched deliveries, Dhoni said here after being signed as brand ambassador for Karnataka Soaps amp; Detergents Limited. 

The swashbuckling batsman said the series would be very tough and predicted an even contest. The team that plays well throughout will win, he added. 

 Meanwhile, Videocon on Tuesday also roped in Dhoni as one of its celebrity endorsers. Dhoni stands for entertainment, which is a value that is at the core of Videocon, said a company official in Mumbai. (Agencies)

Lahore: Team India batsmen fired in unison but the bowlers were made to work hard to find their rhythm by Pakistan A opener Imran Farhat who served a timely reminder to the selectors with a swashbuckling century on Day II of the three-day tour-opener on Sunday. 

India had declared on 414 for seven after half centuries from their top six batsmen, including V.V.S. Laxman (54), Yuvraj Singh (59) and Sachin Tendulkar (74). Laxman and Yuvraj both retired. At stumps on Day II, Pakistan A reached 212 for four. 

Farhat staked a strong claim for a place the first Test against India by blazing his way to a superb 107. The left-hander ? who had notched a century against Sourav Ganguly-led side in the second Test of Indias last visit to Pakistan in 2004 ? cut the Indian pace attack to ribbons with his audacious drives, cuts and pulls. 

Farhat struck 16 fours and a six in his 162-ball innings. His captain Hasan Raza also made mincemeat of the wayward Indian attack in making a 62-ball 75, which included 10 fours and a six. Together they added 160 runs for the third wicket in 172 balls and steadied the ship for Pakistan A from the difficult situation of 26 for two. 

Bazid Khan (6) was caught at second slip by Laxman off Ajit Agarkar and then Mohammed Wasim (1) was trapped on the backfoot by Irfan Pathan with a big inswinger. 

Then Farhat and Raza got involved in the rollicking stand to tear apart the attack, especially Zaheer Khan and Rudra Pratap Singh, who was included only for bowling and fielding as the 12th man under mutually agreed upon terms before the tie. 

Farhat, however, was dropped on 95 by Yuvraj off Irfan Pathan. 

Earlier, The Indians, 298 for four overnight, declared their first innings closed at lunch at 414 for seven. Laxman and Yuvraj negotiated the new ball taken by the home team soon after it was available on the second morning without much qualms, barring the former taking a nasty lifter from Yasir Arafat on his fingers once. 

Yuvraj later told reporters that the fact that all top-order batsmen made fifties in the only warm-up game before the first Test was a good sign for tougher battles ahead. He also said that the pitch prepared for the tie at the picturesque Bagh-e-Jinnah ground was a very good one for batting but a heartbreaker for bowlers.

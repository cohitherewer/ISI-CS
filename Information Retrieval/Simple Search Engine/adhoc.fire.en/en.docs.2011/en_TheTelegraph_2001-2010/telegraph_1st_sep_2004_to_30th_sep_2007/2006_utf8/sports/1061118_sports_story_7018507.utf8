 Brett Lee a dad now

Melbourne: Brett Lee has got a gift a week ahead of the Ashes battle with wife Liz delivering their first child, a boy. 

Liz was due to give birth next Wednesday a day before the first Test in Brisbane but the early arrival of the baby, named Preston Charles, provided Lee the scope to be with his wife and son, according to a report published in a daily. 

Lee had earlier decided that he would play the first Test even if he had to miss the birth of his baby. Now, he would be leaving for the team camp on Saturday. (PTI)

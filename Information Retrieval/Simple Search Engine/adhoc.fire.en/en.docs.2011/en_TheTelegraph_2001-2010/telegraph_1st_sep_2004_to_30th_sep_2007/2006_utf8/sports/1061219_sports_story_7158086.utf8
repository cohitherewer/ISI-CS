The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It was a team effort, says Gaekwad

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: They maybe not part of the Indian team now, but following Indias historic Test win against South Africa former Indian coach and players (Aunshuman Gaekwad, Deep Dasgupta, Rohan Gavaskar and Parthiv Patel) could not stop themselves from sharing their joy. The common refrain, incidentally, was expecting a clean sweep from Team India. 

The following are excerpts (alphabetically): 

Deep Dasgupta: Im extremely happy for the winand at the same time we (Bengal team) are all proud for Sourav. Having started off on a brilliant note, we should now look for a clean sweep. 

Aunshuman Gaekwad: The win was significant, since it was a team effort. From Sachin Tendulkar (who saw the new ball through), Sourav Ganguly to Sreesanth, Zaheer Khan everybody contributed in the win. Now were on top with plenty of confidence...for the fact that weve broken the notion that Indians cant play the South African bouncy tracks. Now, we should go out all guns. As for Sourav, it was a brilliant innings from himand now let him play and Im sure there would be better knocks ahead. 

Rohan Gavaskar: It was a fantastic win. And it was Sourav who made the difference; in fact, it was him who boosted the morale of the entire team especially after the one-day thrashing. 

Parthiv Patel: The conditions in South Africa are very different from that in England. Just for the fact that this is our first win in South Africa, it becomes special.

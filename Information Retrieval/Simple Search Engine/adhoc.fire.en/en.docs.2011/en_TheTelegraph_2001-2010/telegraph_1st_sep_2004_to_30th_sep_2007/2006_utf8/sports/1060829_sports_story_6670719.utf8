 CAB sounds out Saba Karim

 - Chief selector's post

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India and Bengal stumper Syed Saba Karim was sounded out for the post of the chief selector of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) for the season 2006-07. Current chairman Pranab Roys term got over last month. We are thinking of someone who is young as well as a big name and so Saba can definitely be sought for the post, a source in CAB said on Monday. 

However, it has been learnt that Karim is not turning his back on the offer and wants to pursue the dialogue, though he himself refused to comment on the issue. 

The only thing that is creating a bit of problem is Karims assignments as a commentator. 

He feels this a very honourable position and if he ultimately takes it up, he will try to do justice to it, a Karim confidante confirmed. 

CAB, however, had also sought quite a few big names Arun Lal and Ashok Malhotra in the recent past for the same post, but both were apparently unable to take the offer due to personal engagements. 

Meanwhile, CAB under-19 boys will go to Delhi for a preparatory tour before they open their season with the Vinoo Mankad Trophy one-dayers starting here on October 24. 

The Bengal colts are likely to play four one-dayers and a three-dayer from October 6-15 in Delhi.

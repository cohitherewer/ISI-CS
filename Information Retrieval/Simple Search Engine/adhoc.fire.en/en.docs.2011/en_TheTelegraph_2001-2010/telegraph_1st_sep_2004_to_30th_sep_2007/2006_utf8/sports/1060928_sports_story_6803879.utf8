 Yuvraj all for experimentation

New Delhi: Yuvraj Singh dismissed the growing criticism of Team Indias experimentation policy in the one-dayers, saying there was no hue and cry over the policy when things were going smoothly for the side. 

This (experimentation) has been going on for the past six months. When it was working, nobody questioned it. Now only you media people have started questioning it, Yuvraj said on the sidelines of promotional event here on Wednesday. 

After India lost the ODI series in the West Indies and then failed to reach the finals of the DLF Cup in Malaysia, ex-cricketers have questioned the constant shuffling of the batting line-up. 

Asked about their lacklustre performance in Malaysia, Yuvraj was candid: we dont have any excuse to offer. (PTI)

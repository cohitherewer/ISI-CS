The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Injured King 

 out for season, will be fit for Germany

 QUICK TAKES

 London: 

 England defender Ledley King will be fit for the World 

 Cup despite sustaining a stress fracture to his left foot, 

 says Tottenham Hotspur manager Martin Jol. 

 He will take three or four 

 weeks to recover so of course he will be fit for the World 

 Cup, Dutchman Jol told a television sports channel 

 on Monday.

 England begin their campaign against 

 Group B opponents Paraguay in Frankfurt on June 10. 

 Spurs defender and captain King 

 is out for the rest of the Premier League season after suffering 

 a stress fracture to the fourth metatarsal on his foot in 

 Saturdays 1-0 win at Everton.

 Tunisia bid turned down

 Tunis: Tunisias 

 bid to have Toulouse midfielder Nabil Taider available at 

 the World Cup finals has been turned down by Fifa, the Tunisian 

 Football Federation said on Monday.

 Tunisia had applied for a change 

 of footballing nationality for the French-born striker, 

 who won caps at junior level for the country of his birth 

 but also qualifies for Tunisian citizenship through his 

 parents. Tunisias 

 application to Fifa has been ruled ineligible because Taider 

 had already turned 21, the TFF said. The 22-year-od Taider 

 is in his third season of French Ligue 1 football with Toulouse.

 Chances boosted

 Rio de Janeiro: Forward 

 Johnny Baldeon boosted his chances of a call-up for Ecuadors 

 World Cup squad by scoring a hattrick in Barcelonas 

 6-0 demolition of title holders El Nacional.

 Baldeonb snapped up a rebound 

 in the 25th minute, then latched on to Elkin Sotos 

 pass and rounded goalkeeper Giovanny Ibarra for his second 

 13 minutes later. He also fired in the fifth following a 

 corner in the second half. Soto, 

 Paraguayan Derlin Florentin and David Garcia shared the 

 other goals.

 Stars missed

 Mexico City: Guadalajara, 

 missing six players called up for Mexicos pre-World 

 Cup training camp, were beaten 0-3 at home by smaller neighbours 

 Atlas on Sunday. Atlas scored all the goals in the second 

 half at the Jalisco stadium, with two from Argentina Emmanuel 

 Villa and one from Daniel Osorno.

 Mexico announced a 26-man provisional 

 World Cup squad two weeks ago and the clubs have agreed 

 to release all the selected players to help the national 

 sides preparations. 

 Guadalajara, the only club not 

 to allow foreign players, have been the hardest hit. They 

 remain third in Group 3 of the Clausura championship with 

 22 points from 15 games, two behind Cruz Azul who lost 3-1 

 at home to America in a Mexico City derby.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dalmiya likely to skip meeting

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Though everybody feels that there is no option left for Jagmohan Dalmiya than to appear before the special general body in Jaipur on Saturday, there was no sign of the former BCCI president heading towards the Pink City till late Friday. 

According to CAB sources, joint secretary Saradindu Pal will represent CAB in Saturdays meeting with a close Dalmiya confidant. 

Since (Saradindu) Pal is not aware of the whole matter, he will be assisted by somebody who knows the ins and outs of the issue, the source said. 

The only reason to attend this meeting is to avoid being expelled, the source added. 

However, if Dalmiya is expelled and not suspended, it will be interesting to see whether he manages to hold the top post in CAB too.

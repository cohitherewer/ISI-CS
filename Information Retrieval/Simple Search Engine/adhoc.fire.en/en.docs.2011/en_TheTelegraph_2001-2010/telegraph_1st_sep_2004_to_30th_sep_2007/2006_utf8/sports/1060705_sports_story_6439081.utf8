 ITALY MARCH INTO BERLIN

 - First semi-final 

 Dortmund: 

 Italy stunned Germany 2-0, in the closing stages 

 of extra-time, to book a place in Sundays World Cup 

 final in Berlin.

 Fabio Grosso scored with some 

 three minutes to go and, even as the Germans were trying 

 to recover from that shock, substitute Alessandro del Piero 

 banged in one more.

 Earlier, the teams were locked 0-0 after 90 minutes.

 Germany had more of the chances 

 at the stadium in Dortmund, where the national team has 

 13 wins and one draw.

 Miroslav Klose, the tournaments 

 leading scorer with five goals, dribbled through three Italians 

 before falling in the penalty area early in the second half.

 Gianluigi Buffon made a two-handed 

 save on Lukas Podolskis turnaround left-footer from 

 close range, then Arne Friedrich shot over the net. As Italy 

 tired, Germany kept coming.

 But the Italians had allowed 

 only an own-goal against the United States in five games, 

 and their technique carried them even when their legs didnt 

 want to.

 Captain Michael Ballack put a 

 19-metre free-kick from the middle over and wide in the 

 82nd, and goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made a punchout save with 

 Simone Perrotta going for Francesco Tottis pass in 

 the box in the 84th.

 Italian defenders seemed to materialise 

 from nowhere to block shots and clear other balls when the 

 Germans pressed the attack. Even in the air, where Germany 

 had a decided height edge, Italy more than held their own.

 Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro 

 was everywhere in the first half. His sliding clearance 

 of a loose ball in the box in the 15th minute came with 

 three Germans pursuing the ball, and he did it again to 

 Podolski in prime scoring range moments later. 

 Still, Germany got their opportunities. 

 Podolski shot over the net from 18 metres and Bernd Schneider, 

 alone on the right side from 12metres, barely put one over 

 the crossbar.

 Italys strategy of lobbing 

 the ball over the huge German defense yielded few threats, 

 but Perrotta broke in on left wing in the 16th. Lehmann 

 came out to meet him and saved Perrottas weak shot.

 The crowd, which is right on 

 top of the action at the Stadium, didnt seem to bother 

 the visitors. It was Mexican referee Benito Archundia who 

 heard the fans whistles most when he gave Borowski 

 a yellow card for a dangerous tackle in the 40th.

 Juergen Klinsmann made two changes 

 in Germanys starting line-up to replace suspended 

 midfielder Torsten Frings, and defender Marco Materazzi 

 returned for Italy.

 Sebastian Kehl took the place of Frings, while Borowoski 

 came in for midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger 

 had a below-par performance against Argentina in the quarter 

 finals, while Borowski, who plays for Werder Bremen, has 

 been strong coming off the bench.

 Frings has been one of the key 

 players in helping the Germans to five straight victories 

 at the tournament, but the 29-year-old was banned on Monday 

 after video evidence prompted Fifa to investigate his involvement 

 in a post-match melee with Argentina.

 Meanwhile, just hours before the match, an Italian prosecutor 

 asked a sports tribunal to demote Juventus to Serie C or 

 lower and strip the team of the Serie A titles it won in 

 the past two seasons.

 Prosecutor Stefano Palazzi also 

 asked the sports trial into Italys match-fixing scandal 

 at the Olympic Stadium to relegate AC Milan, Fiorentina 

 and Lazio to Serie B. 

 Along with the demotions, Palazzi 

 requested the teams be docked points next season: six for 

 Juventus, three for AC Milan, and 15 for Lazio and Fiorentina.

 The Italian World Cup squad has 

 13 players in all from these four clubs.

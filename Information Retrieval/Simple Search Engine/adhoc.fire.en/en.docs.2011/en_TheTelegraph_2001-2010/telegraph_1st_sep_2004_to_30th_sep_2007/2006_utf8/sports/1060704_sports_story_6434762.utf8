The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Germany a tad 

 ahead of Italy 

 Talking Tactics 

 PK Banerjee

 Its 

 down to three games and four teams. And its down to 

 an all-European affair. This is not the first time that 

 the games biggest continent will fight among themselves 

 for the right to contest the grand finale, but very few 

 expected it to happen in the 2006 edition. 

 Both Brazil and Argentina were 

 among the strongest of contenders and their exit in the 

 quarter-final stage has been among the most stunning developments 

 in the Battle for Berlin.

 Rather than indulging in a scapegoat-hunting 

 exercise, let us look forward to the business end of what 

 has been a fascinating championship. Of my five pre-tournament 

 strong contenders, only Germany and Italy are 

 alive. As far as France and Portugal are concerned, they 

 have the talent and ability, but frankly speaking, I didnt 

 expect them to reach the semis at the expense of Brazil 

 and England, respectively.

 Looking at the Germany versus 

 Italy duel, I would say Klinsmanns team is marginally 

 ahead. The Germans are riding the crest of an enthusiastic 

 campaign driven by a massive nationalistic surge. The coach 

 deserves credit for taking in his stride all the criticism 

 ? for flying to and from his US-based home in the midst 

 of the World Cup build-up ? and moulding a collection of 

 good (not great) players into a formidable unit.

 But for Ballack and Lehmann, Germany 

 have no superstars. Even Ballack is no Zidane, after all. 

 Yet, this team has been delivering game after game. The 

 defence has looked sound, except in the opener versus Costa 

 Rica. Philipp Lahm, in particular, has had an outstanding 

 tournament as an attacking wing-back.

 Ballacks form was on the 

 upswing with every game, though he was a bit flat against 

 Argentina. Klinsmann will hope that his captain has two 

 more good days ahead of him. Frings, Schneider and Schweinsteiger 

 have been consistent in midfield. The real stars, however, 

 have been Klose and Podolski, the Poland-born strike duo, 

 who have scored eight goals between them.

 The Italian defence is reputed 

 to be the best in the game and Lippi will surely have his 

 plans to check Klose and Podolski. Italys problem 

 is, they havent faced a high-quality team besides 

 a below-par Czech Republic in the group league stage. They 

 struggled versus the US, conceding a rare own goal, and 

 were given a tough time in the pre-quarter final by Australia. 

 It took a stoppage-time penalty to ensure Italian progress.

 One problem or the other has been 

 hampering the Italian defence. Nesta had to miss the previous 

 game. Of course, they have Buffon under the bar, but I feel 

 Germany have the firepower to breach the Italian rearline. 

 For Italy to upset the German applecart, an improving Totti 

 and the talented Toni will both have to play their best 

 games of the tournament.

 Going by current form, its 

 difficult to look beyond France in the second semi-final. 

 The manner in which they have turned things around in the 

 knockout stage after a most ordinary start, they really 

 mean business now. I know it wont be easy for Domenechs 

 team to reproduce the football they dished out against Brazil, 

 but with Zidane proving that age cant wither quality 

 skill, nothing is impossible for Les Blues now.

 Makalele, Vieira and Riberys 

 efficiency has helped Zidane concentrate on his creative 

 play. I think the only way to stop Zidane will be to police 

 him constantly. The magician has to be forced to play his 

 passes square, and not forward. If Zidane is not allowed 

 to play his natural game, Portugal will feel they have an 

 even chance.

 Portugal were not at all convincing 

 in their quarter-final triumph. They couldnt score 

 against an English team which had 10 men on the pitch for 

 about an hour. Deco wasnt eligible to play that night, 

 but should be back for the semi-final. He, along with Figo, 

 Cristiano Ronaldo and Maniche, form a dangerous quartet 

 which can bother any defence any day. But it remains to 

 be seen whether the organised French midfield lets them 

 take charge.

 Ive heard this game being 

 labelled as a Zidane vs Figo duel. My feeling 

 is, it will be Scolaris intelligence versus Zidanes 

 sublime skills.

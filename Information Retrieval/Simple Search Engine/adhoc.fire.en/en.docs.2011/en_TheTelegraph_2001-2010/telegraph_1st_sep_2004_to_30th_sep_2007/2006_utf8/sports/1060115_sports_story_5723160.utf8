The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ashim out to prove a point 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: The long injury lay-off has hardly allowed Ashim Biswas to wear the green-and-maroon jersey in the last season. With Mohun Bagan showing no interest in him in the new season, the former India striker decided to move out of the Maidan and join Salgaocar. 

Come Sunday, Ashim will start his new campaign, when East Bengal host his team at the Salt Lake Stadium in their second-round NFL match. 

I want to play for India again, Ashim said on the match-eve. Coach Savio Medeira, on the other hand, felt that the striker is yet to regain full fitness but is improving day by day. 

Bhaichung Bhutia, who hit the winner against Mohammedan Sporting, however, looks like enjoying the game to the hilt. 

While Bhaichungs return to form will be a big boost for the red-and-golds, it will also serve as a warning to his rivals in the National League. 

A hard-fought 1-0 win over Mohammedan Sporting must have given new East Bengal coach Philippe De Ridder relief, but hes going to field the team sans foreigners for the second time in a row as Mike Okoro is still to recover from his injury. 

Its a long-drawn league and we have to deal with it carefully, De Ridder said. 

Whatever it is, Sundays match will hold special attention for a duel between Bhaichung and his one-time India teammate, who is out to prove a point. 

Meanwhile, the East Bengal-Mohun Bagan derby, scheduled to take place on January 22, will be held under lights at the Salt Lake Stadium and start from 7 pm. 

The revised matches on January 25 ? East Bengal versus Fransa-Pax and Mohun Bagan versus JCT will have 5pm and 7 pm starts, respectively.

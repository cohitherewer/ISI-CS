 Manavjit bags Indias third gold

 World Shooting

 Zagreb: Manavjit Singh 

 Sandhu won the mens individual trap gold, edging past 

 Italian Erminio Frasca and Bret Erickson of the US at the 

 49th World Shooting Championships here on Thursday.

 Manavjit tallied 143 points, including 

 121 in the team event to clinch the third gold for India. 

 His close competitors Frasca and Erickson were tied at 142, 

 forcing the implementation of tie-shoot. In the tie-breaker, 

 Frasca prevailed over Erickson to bag silver. The American 

 had to be satisfied with bronze.

 Earlier, Indian mens trap 

 team claimed the silver medal with its consistent performance 

 over two days. India totalled 360 points out of a maximum 

 375 and finished just two points behind gold-medallists 

 Russia. The bronze went to the United States (359).

 Manavjit scored 121, Mansher Singh 

 120 and Anwar Sultan managed 119. The Indian tally at the 

 championships now reads three golds, one silver and two 

 bronze medals.

 India were tied for the second 

 spot with Australia after three qualifying rounds.

 Manavjit shot 73 out of 75, which 

 included a perfect first round 25, to be joint third in 

 the individual event on Wednesday. The Indian, who has already 

 qualified for the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, shared the 

 spot with three others ? Giovanni Pellielo of Italy, Russians 

 Pavel Gurkin and Alexey Alipov. Compatriots Mansher and 

 Anwar shot 72 each to be 13th and 14th, respectively, in 

 the qualification round.

 The Indian and Australian team, 

 comprising Russell Mark, Adam Vella and Michael Diamond, 

 tallied 217 each.

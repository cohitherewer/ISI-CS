 Williams lifeline for Narain

London: Williams could throw a Formula One lifeline to Indian Narain Karthikeyan despite appointing Austrian Alex Wurz as their official test driver. 

Team boss Frank Williams said on Thursday that Karthikeyan, who became his countrys first Grand Prix driver when he raced for Jordan last year, could yet play a role for the former champions. 

Alexs appointment as Williams official test and reserve driver does not necessarily mean that the team has no additional role for Narain, he said. The team and Narain are still in dialogue and the possibility of a second testing role for him still exists. 

Karthikeyan tested twice for Williams after the end of last season but the Cosworth-powered team opted to sign McLarens experienced tester Wurz. 

The 28-year-old Chennai driver has no hope of a race seat with any team in 2006 but is eager to stay in the sport. 

The objective for 2006 has to be to keep Narain involved in Formula One throughout this season as a lot is likely to change for 2007, his manager Piers Hunisett said. As long as he keeps his profile up, he could be in a good position by the end of the year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Brussels: The world?s richest soccer clubs will challenge Fifa, the sport?s world governing body, in a Belgian courtroom on Monday in a case that could change the game at international level forever.

 Belgian first division club Charleroi are taking Fifa to court seeking compensation after one of their players was injured while playing a friendly for Morocco against Burkina Faso in November 2004 and missed the rest of the season. Charleroi are backed by the G14, which represents 18 of the world?s richest clubs, in a test case on the vexed club versus country issue. The G14 grouping, which also includes Real Madrid and Manchester United, has joined French champions Olympique Lyon in a similar action. The G14 threw its support behind Charleroi in September and has also filed a complaint with the Swiss Competition Commission saying Fifa?s regulations on releasing players violates Swiss competition law.

 Fifa says there is no link between the injury and where Charleroi finished in the league last season, fifth. It believes national associations should reimburse clubs and it is not Fifa?s responsibility.

 Berlin: Former German captain Lothar Matthaeus has stepped down as coach of Brazilian side Atletico Paranaense less than two months after taking the job, a German daily reported on Saturday. quot;I have informed the club?s leadership on Friday morning that I was stepping down,? the 44-year-old said. quot;It was not an easy decision to take.? The former Hungary coach said family reasons had motivated his decision. quot;I was missing my wife Marijana, who is in Budapest, and my children,? he said. Atletico were unbeaten in nine games since Matthaeus took over, winning seven and drawing twice. 

 London: English second division team Stoke City have suspended director of football John Rudge and assistant manager Jan De Koning, the club said on Friday. A statement on the official website said: ?The Board of Stoke City football club regrets the ongoing dispute between the club?s director of football, John Rudge, assistant manager Jan De Koning, and the manager, Johan Boskamp.

 Madrid: The president of the Spanish football league has backed Fifa?s new anti-racism proposals, though they received a mixed response from Primera Liga clubs.

 ?The Spanish league will be pioneers in implementing the new rules,? Jose Luis Astiazaran told a sports daily on Saturday. ?They will make the clubs and the fans more aware of the issue.?

 On Thursday, Fifa announced tough new sanctions for incidences of racism in football, which included match suspensions, the deduction of points, relegation or elimination from competitions.

 Confederations and national associations will be compelled to incorporate the measures and infringements could lead to a two-year exclusion from international soccer.

 Fifa president Sepp Blatter said on Friday the measures were ?immediately applicable.?

 Cristiano keen to play for Real

Madrid: Manchester United and Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo has said he would like to play for Real Madrid and plans to talk about his future after the World Cup. 

Ronaldo has aligned himself with a candidate for Reals presidential election on July 2, Juan Miguel Villar Mir, and although he has made no firm commitment to a move he said he would open negotiations if Villar Mir wins. 

I have told my agent I am prepared to leave. I want to do it in the best manner possible. I want to play for Real Madrid and dream of doing so, Ronaldo told a Spanish sports daily on Tuesday. 

Manchester United have, however, denied they gave Mir permission to speak to Ronaldo about joining the Spanish club. There has been no contact between Manchester United and (Mirs) election team or Real Madrid, and any suggestion there has been is incorrect, a statement from the club said. Cristiano Ronaldo will be a Manchester United player next season. 

Meanwhile, another candidate in Real Madrids presidential election, Lorenzo Sanz, has promised to sign Brazil striker Adriano from Inter Milan if he is victorious.

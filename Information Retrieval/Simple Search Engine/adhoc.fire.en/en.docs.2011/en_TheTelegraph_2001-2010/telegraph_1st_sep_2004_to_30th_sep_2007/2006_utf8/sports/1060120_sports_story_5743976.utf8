 Inzamams warning for Sehwag 

The Pakistan captain, Inzamam-ul Haq, has taken on Indian vice-captain Virender Sehwag ? not in a hand-to-hand combat, but through his column in a leading English daily in Pakistan. Heres what Sehwag said on the fourth day of the weather-hit first Test, at the Gaddafi, and Inzamams reply published on Thursday: 

Sehwag: ... Such wickets arent good for cricket... In fact, it reflects the defensive state of Pakistans mind. 

Inzamam: ... Sehwag has said that Pakistan were on the defensive. On the one hand, while I have the greatest of praise for his innings of 254 ? as one experiences such outstanding knocks at the Test level only rarely, I do not agree with his criticism of the Pakistan team and the Lahore wicket. I wouldnt like to get into a slanging match with Sehwag, I would rather want to prove my point on the ground.

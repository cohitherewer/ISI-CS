 Fleming: If you walk around thinking youre a leader, youre far from one

 - Hours away from record, New Zealander says captaining India is probably 

 the toughest job

 Chandigarh: The 

 team-driven New Zealanders are distinctly uncomfortable 

 when the attention is on an individual, but much of the 

 spotlight on Wednesday (in the Champions Trophy face-off 

 against Pakistan) is going to be on captain Stephen Fleming. 

 The 33-year-old, after all, is set to lead his country for 

 a record 194th time in ODIs. He has been at the helm for 

 a few months short of a decade. 

In the lead-up, Fleming had quite a bit to say about captaincy. Here go excerpts: 

Its nice to achieve (a record), but Ill be more excited if we win the game and get ourselves into the semi-finals... Its good to achieve personal milestones, but Im looking to help achieve the team goal win tournaments... Weve improved in the last 24 months, but need to cement that and finish with a good World Cup result (next year)... 

Im still getting massive satisfaction from leading New Zealand... Thats an important thing to acknowledge even after ten years... My desire and drive to get better as a captain is as intense as it was on Day-I... I understand the shelf-life talk, but Ive tried to be innovative and have tried to encourage leadership... That has kept me energised... If you walk around thinking youre a leader, youre far from one... 

A decade of cricket (as captain) is a lot to go through... Good moments, soul-searching moments... They make you as a player and as a person... I cant be thankful enough for having done the job for so long... I got a chance to not only learn, but explore possibilities as to how to go about it... Im still very mindful of how much respect Ive got to give the position... 

Actually, Ive got lots to achieve win this tournament, win the next World Cup (March-April 2007), encourage Daniel Vettori, Jacob Oram, Shane Bond and the Marshalls to develop leadership qualities... Theyre the next group of leaders... Speaking of my successor, Vettoris name comes up first... 

 [Incidentally, in an interview 

 to The Telegraph, Vettori has lauded Flemings 

 role in building a leadership group: Stephen 

 has himself taken a couple of us under his wings... He talks 

 about situations and ideas are exchanged... The leadership 

 group is central to the teams performance... 

 Stephen is remarkable because the shifts in momentum dont 

 affect him...] 

Looking back (February 1997), I didnt know what I was to do in my first game as captain... My style has changed 360 degrees and more... Ive developed in different ways... Used the people weve had and gone with my beliefs... Its probably now, with the benefit of hindsight, that Im discovering just how important leadership can be... 

Im not as good a captain when Im under pressure as a batsman... The decision-making is not as confident as it should be, but Ive been in the game long enough to set that aside and concentrate on the captaincy even when the batting isnt going well... Martin Crowe has always been supportive, he was himself an innovative captain... Gilbert Anoeka (a sports psychologist) has also been influential... 

Yes, Ive thought of giving up the captaincy (when the going hasnt been good)... In the playing sense, the buck stops with me and youve got to see whether the captaincy is hindering or helping your game... You always think of life after cricket, but Im not sure whats there (after retirement)... 

At times, Ive got more credit than deserved... If youre in the game for recognition (alone), though, then youre there for the wrong reasons... Team success is what counts... Sure there have been great teams with average captains, but youve also had very good captains who didnt have too much success... It ought to be okay if youre able to separate batting from captaincy... First and foremost, Im in the team as a batsman... 

Captaining India is probably the toughest job... Both Sourav (Ganguly) and Rahul (Dravid) are strong personalities, but with contrasting styles... Sourav had quite an emotional streak, but Rahul seems more measured... One needs to respect what Sourav did he brought a lot of spark and passion to the team... He differed from the other Indian captains, who had a passive approach... Sourav was very confrontational... Over a period of time, its going to be interesting how Rahul measures up... 

If a captain is observant and man management is in order, then half the things get sorted out... 

 Fleming, clearly, knows best.

 PRAISE FROM PAK CAMP

 Pakistan captain Younis Khan and 

 coach Bob Woolmer had nice things to say about Stephen Fleming. 

 Here goes:

 YOUNIS: I have always liked New Zealand 

 and have liked Flemings captaincy, particularly in 

 the last seven-eight years... He has been leading well...

 WOOLMER: Fleming has been an excellent 

 captain and, over the years, one of the best in the world...

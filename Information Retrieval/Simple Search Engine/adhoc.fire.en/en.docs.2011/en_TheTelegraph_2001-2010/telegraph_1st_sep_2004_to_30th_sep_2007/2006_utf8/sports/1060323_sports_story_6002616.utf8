The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Bagan look to keep winning run going 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Following their back-to-back victories against Fransa Pax and Air India, Mohun Bagan ? who have jumped three places to fourth position with 11 points from nine encounters in the National Football League ? are looking to keep the winning run intact against Salgaocar at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

The city giants will be without Mehrajuddin Wadao and Mehtab Hussain, who are yet to fully recover from injuries, in their opening tie of the second leg. We cannot afford to look back. We have to aim for three points. If we cannot get that, we will go down a few slots down the order? Things will be back to square one. A victory will give us an opportunity to breathe easy, coach Biswajit Bhattacharjee said after practice on Wednesday. 

Salgaocar have the reputation of coming out good against tougher opposition. With small passes they add variations to their attacking line. Moreover, they have Ashim Biswas upfront which will help them come to terms with alien conditions, he explained. 

Chinmoy Sarkar may take Mehrajuddins place while Tomba Singh is also likely to make the XI. The good news for Mohun Bagan has been the return to goalscoring ways of Coffi Agbessi. 

Salgaocar, on the other hand, are under threat of relegation with seven points from nine games.

 Oram century helps NZ take 51-run lead 

 - Bouchers 350th dismissal 

 Oram

Centurion: Allrounder Jacob Oram, playing in his first Test match in more than a year, took New Zealand into a first innings lead with a valiant century on the second day of the first Test against South Africa at the Centurion here on Sunday. 

Oram hit a career-best 133 as the Black Caps recovered from a disastrous start to make 327 and take a 51 runs lead. South Africa finished with four for no loss when the stumps were drawn. 

New Zealand lost their first five wickets for just 45 runs before Oram led a recovery. 

Oram and Daniel Vettori (81), however, combined in a superb 183-run stand for the seventh wicket. 

Mark Boucher, meanwhile, became the fourth wicketkeeper to complete 350th dismissal in Tests.

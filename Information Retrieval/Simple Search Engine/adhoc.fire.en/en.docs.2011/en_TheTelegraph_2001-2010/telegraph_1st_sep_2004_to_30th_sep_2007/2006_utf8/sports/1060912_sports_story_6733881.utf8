 ACA smells financial motive

Melbourne: Australia have only agreed to play in the Malaysia tri-series because of the million-dollar cash carrot dangled by India, Australian Cricketers Association (ACA) chief Paul Marsh has said. 

There is no doubt the major motivating factor for Cricket Australia (CA) agreeing to this series is financial, Marsh said. 

The majority of the public arent excited by these types of tournaments and if CA continues to agree to them when there is a good financial outcome offered up, we question what effect this will have on the long-term value of the product of cricket, he was quoted as saying in an Australian paper. 

Whilst the ACA supports growing the games finances, there has to be a balance between the short and long-term needs of the game, he said. 

Marsh also said the success of the Australian team was being placed in jeopardy because of scheduling. Our major concerns with series like this one are their lack of context and the ever-increasing workload burden placed on players, he said. 

While we acknowledge that the Australian players are coming off the longest break they have had for several years, such breaks are rare. 

Im sure wed all hate to see Australia lose the Ashes or World Cup because of unnecessary player injuries caused by excessive workload. (PTI)

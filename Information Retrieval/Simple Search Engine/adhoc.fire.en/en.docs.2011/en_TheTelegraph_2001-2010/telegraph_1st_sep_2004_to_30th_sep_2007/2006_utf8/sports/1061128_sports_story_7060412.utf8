Brisbane: Brett Lee dismissed Kevin Pietersen in the first over, crushing Englands hopes of saving the first Test on Monday and helping Australia secure a 1-0 lead in the Ashes. 

The Australians mopped up the English tail-enders in 91 minutes on the fifth day, bowling the Ashes holders out for 370 to secure a 277-run win in the first Test. 

We were relentless, said winning captain Ricky Ponting. We didnt let them get back into the game at all. We really rammed home our advantage at every opportunity we had. 

England captain Andrew Flintoff said any nerves that came with playing an Ashes Test in Australia were now erased for his team, upset winners in the 2005 series. 

Were 0-1 down in an Ashes series. Well let this game go and move on, he said. It will be tough to come back we cant hide from that. But theres a lot at stake, a big incentive. Weve got to get into this series and weve got to win Thats all we can focus on. 

With the result almost a foregone conclusion after three days barring a record run chase or heavy rain in drought-stricken Brisbane this match will be scrutinised most for Australias conservative decision not to enforce a follow-on. 

That allowed Englands batsmen to get some confidence-building time in the middle and had Australias bowlers working for 100 overs in hot and humid conditions. 

With the second Test starting on Friday in Adelaide, strike bowler Glenn McGrath is in doubt with a seriously bruised heel and Ponting is recovering from a back strain. 

Pietersen defied the Australians for almost four hours on Sunday, sharing an innings-reviving 153-run stand with Paul Collingwood (96), but fell after two deliveries with the new ball. 

England, set 648 to win the match, ran out of hope when South African-born Pietersen hit Lee to Damien Martyn at short mid-wicket without adding to his overnight 92 to make the total 293 for six. 

Geraint Jones had five boundaries in his 33 before chopping a McGrath ball onto his stumps to expose Englands tailenders at 326 for seven. 

Paceman Stuart Clark and Shane Warne combined to remove No. 8 Ashley Giles (23) and No. 9 Matthew Hoggard (8), both caught at slip slashing outside off stump. 

And the innings ended a half hour before the lunch interval when Steve Harmison (13) hooked Clark around to McGrath at fine leg. 

Clark returned four for 72 in 24 overs and Warne returned four for 124, failing to add to his four wickets from Sunday afternoon. 

One problem for Australia ahead of the second Test is the fitness of McGrath, who took six for 50 to skittle England for 157 in the first innings after Australia had posted a massive 602 for nine. 

McGrath, coming back from 10 months out of the test arena, needed pain-killing injections to bowl on the last two days and took one wicket in the second innings. 

Ponting, who won Man-of-the-Match honuors for his 196 in the first innings and unbeaten 60 in the second, praised McGrath and opening batsman Justin Langer for their contributions. 

Langer followed his 82 in the first innings with an unbeaten 100 in the second, prompting Australias declaration at 202 for one early Sunday morning. 

Glenn did a fantastic job, his bowling in the first things was superb, Ponting said. :Justin Langer the same, he got the job done for us. 

Ponting strained his back in the 5.1 overs he batted early Sunday morning and did not field for all of Englands 80 overs on day four. He returned on Monday, but not in his customary close catching positions. 

Ponting said despite the scale of the win, his line-up had learned a lesson in 2005 and will not be taking the accelerator off in the second Test. 

Australia won the first Test at Lords last year before losing two of the next four matches to surrender the Ashes for the first time in almost two decades.

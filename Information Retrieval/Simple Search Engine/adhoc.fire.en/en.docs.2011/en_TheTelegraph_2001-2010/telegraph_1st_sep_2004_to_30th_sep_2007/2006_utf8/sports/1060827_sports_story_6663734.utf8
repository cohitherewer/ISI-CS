 Justine wins as Lindsay retires 

 New Haven Final

 New York: Lindsay Davenport 

 hopes to be fit for next weeks US Open after retiring 

 from the final of the New Haven event against Justine Henin-Hardenne 

 on Saturday with a shoulder injury.

 French Open champion Henin-Hardenne 

 was leading 6-0, 1-0 when Davenport decided the injury was 

 too bad to continue.

 The American, playing just her 

 second event back after five months out with a back problem, 

 was in tears as she sat on court afterwards.

 I just hope that it is going 

 to be better next week, she said. Davenport hinted 

 she may ask US Open organisers for a late start.

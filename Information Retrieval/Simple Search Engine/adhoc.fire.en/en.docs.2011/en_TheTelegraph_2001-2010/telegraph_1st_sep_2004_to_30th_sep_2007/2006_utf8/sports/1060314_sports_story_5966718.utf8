The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahindra down Md. Sp. 2-0

Mumbai: Mahindra United wasted chances galore, but were still strong enough for Calcuttas Mohammedan Sporting to carve out a 2-0 victory in the ONCG for the National League match on Monday. 

Man of the Match Steven Dias put the league leaders ahead in the 29th minute, slotting home from close. 

Mahindra then squandered a lot of opportunities until Ghanaian forward Yusif Yukubu put them 2-0 ahead at the fag end of the match. 

Yukubu had earlier missed sitters, including an open net, a minute after his team had taken the lead in the first half and was guilty of selfishness that cost Mahindra at least a couple more goals. 

It was the still-unbeaten Mahindras sixth victory in the league, taking their points tally to 19 from seven ties, while Mohammedan Sporting remain on 10 points from eight matches. 

 TFAs feat 

In Jamshedpur, TFA qualified for the final round of the second division NFL and will feature in the Federation Cup for the first time. TFA finished with nine points. 

They will be joined by either Punjab Police (6) or Churchill (7), who meet in the last league tie on Tuesday. 

On Monday, Ever-Ready and Simla Young ended their engagements playing out a 1-1 draw. Both finished with five points and failed to get a final-round berth.

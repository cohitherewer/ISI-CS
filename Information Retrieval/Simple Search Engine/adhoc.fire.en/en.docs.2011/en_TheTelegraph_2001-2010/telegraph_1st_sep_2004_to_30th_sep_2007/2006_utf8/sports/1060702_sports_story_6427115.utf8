The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Devastated, says Franco 

Berlin: Leonardo Franco walked slowly off the field, head bowed, oblivious to the jubilant German players rushing past him. 

Called upon without adequate warm-up, forced to defend Argentinas goal in a penalty shootout, Franco couldnt deliver. The Albiceleste are on their way home and, fairly or not, Fridays loss to Germany is on Francos hands. 

You cannot say this penalty shootout is wrong because the goalkeeper doesnt have sufficient experience, Argentina coach Jose Pekerman said. You cannot simply crucify anybody or the goalkeeper for not having stopped the penalty. 

Very bad. Very sad. Very devastated, Franco said after the match. I think we deserved something better out of those 120 minutes. (AP)

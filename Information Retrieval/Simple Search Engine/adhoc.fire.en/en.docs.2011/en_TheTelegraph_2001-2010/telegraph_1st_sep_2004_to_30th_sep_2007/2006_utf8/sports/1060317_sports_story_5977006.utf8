 Karthikeyan wants to help youngsters

London: Narain Karthikeyan, Indias first Formula One driver, wants to help a new generation of racers from the subcontinent achieve their dreams. 

As a youngster it was always very hard to find sponsorship in India, the Williams test driver said on Thursday before flying to Malaysia, the closest race to his homeland, for Sundays second round of the season. 

If I could help some drivers get into the Indian scene without them being hassled to find the sponsorship, then I think it would be a good step. 

Also I would be giving back something to the sport, Karthikeyan said. 

We are talking to our sponsors ... so hopefully some kind of package can be put for the youngsters in this line and I would be happy to support this programme. 

He said a long-term plan was for an academy for promising Indian drivers. 

The academy thing will be later on. The first step would be to offer a complete drive to four young drivers from India below the age of 21 in the highest category of the Indian racing championship, he said. 

Thats the plan at the moment, but Ive been so busy that I have to go back and see how to put this into practice. 

The Chennai driver made his debut last season with Jordan (now Midland) and became the first Indian to score F1 points when he finished fourth in the six-car US Grand Prix. 

Although only the second test driver at Williams, with Austrian Alexander Wurz taking the reserve slot and driving in Friday practice at the races, Karthikeyan hoped to maintain a sufficient profile to make a comeback in 2007. 

Karthikeyan will test the new V8-powered FW28 car for the first time next week.

 Yagnik clinches it

 -Sourav hit for last-ball six, East lose

 Avishek Jhunjhunwalas 

 66 was not enough 

Jaipur: Dishant Yagnik did a Javed Miandad (1986 Austral-Asia Cup final in Sharjah) by hitting Sourav Ganguly for a last-ball six to help Central Zone beat East by a wicket in their last league encounter of the Deodhar Trophy on Monday. 

It was an allround show by wicketkeeper-batsman Yagnik who made an unbeaten 20 off 10 balls and also took four catches behind the stumps. 

Chasing a target of 227, Central were left to make 13 off the last over and then five off the last ball. 

Yagnik produced the winning hit, a six over extra-cover boundary to carve out a thrilling victory for Central at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium. 

On the other hand, it was a bad day in office for Sourav. The former India captain could score only 17 with the bat and gave away 28 runs in his three overs. 

Put into bat in damp conditions, East rode on the back of Avishek Jhunjhunwalas 66 to make 226 for six in 45 overs. 

Sourav tried to break the shackles ? his 17 came off 43 balls ? by stepping out to Jai Prakash Yadav but ended up with an edge to Yagnik. 

Tejinder Pal Singh led Centrals reply with a fine 56 but the visitors lost wickets at regular intervals. 

Sourav was hit for three consecutive boundaries in an over and finished with none for 28. (PTI)

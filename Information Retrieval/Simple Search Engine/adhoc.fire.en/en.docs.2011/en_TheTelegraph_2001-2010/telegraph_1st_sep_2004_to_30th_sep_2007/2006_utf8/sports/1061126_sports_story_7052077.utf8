The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Months on, finance committees okay is awaited

 - Former captain Srinivas Venkatraghavans appointment as the BCCIs 

 director of umpires 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: On September 8, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced through joint-secretary and umpires committee convenor Mohinder Pandove that Srinivas Venkatraghavan would present a blueprint for improving the quality of umpiring within 10 days. 

A laudable move, but two-and-half months have passed and there has been silence. Reason: The BCCIs finance committee hasnt yet approved the former captains appointment as director of umpires. 

All the papers are ready. However, as the question of remuneration is there, the finance committee has to give the green signal The needful should be done at its next meeting, Pandove told The Telegraph. 

Whats strange is that Venkat had been appointed to the same post by Jagmohan Dalmiya more than two years ago! 

Obviously, that remained on paper. But the Sharad Pawar regime, which claims to be professional, has done no better. 

Venkat, a former International Cricket Council (ICC) Elite Panel umpire and a Match Referee in the pre-Elite Panel days, must be pretty miffed. 

He chose to be very business-like, though, when contacted at his residence in Chennai. 

Theres work to be done, but I cant comment on specifics till Ive received the terms of reference Its a reality that theres no Indian on the Elite Panel, but getting there isnt easy, he said. 

Venkat added: As with cricket at the highest level, umpiring demands a lot of practice Practice makes perfect Ive already pointed out its tough making the Elite Panel 

The ICC, it may be recalled, honoured Venkat during the 2004 Champions Trophy in England, some months after his last appearance as an Elite Panel umpire. 

The 10-member Elite Panel (Darrell Hairs name, by the way, hasnt been taken off) has two umpires from Pakistan Aleem Dar and Asad Rauf. 

Remarkable given that the quality of umpiring on the other side of the border left much to be desired till not very long ago. 

In fact, till the ICC stepped in across the board 15 years ago, most teams touring Pakistan were convinced they played against 13 

So, while the Pakistan Cricket Board has much to smile about, the BCCI has its task well and truly cut out. 

Its to be seen whether any of the three nominated by it to the ICCs International Panel Amish Saheba, Suresh Shastri and G.A. Pratap Kumar graduates to the next (Elite) level. 

Also to be seen is the impact Venkat can make. He doesnt have a magic wand, but few boast a higher stature.

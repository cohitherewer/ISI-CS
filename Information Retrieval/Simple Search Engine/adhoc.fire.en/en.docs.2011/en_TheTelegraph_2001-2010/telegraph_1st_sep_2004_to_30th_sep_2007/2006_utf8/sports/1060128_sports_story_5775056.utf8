 Mahesh, Leander in finals

 Mahesh Bhupathi is in mixed doubles final 

Melbourne: Hopes of another Leander Paes versus Mahesh Bhupathi Grand Slam clash went out of the window after the former, partnerning Nathalie Dechy of France, lost in the mixed doubles semi-final at the Australian Open on Friday. 

Paes and Dechy ended up on the wrong side of the super tie-break to go down 6-3, 4-6, 4-10 to sixth seeds Daniel Nestor of Canada and Russian Elena Likhovtseva. 

Bhupathi, however, kept himself in the hunt for a third mixed doubles crown on the trot after reaching the final with Martina Hingis. The Indo-Swiss pair defeated the fifth-seeded Aussie pair of Paul Hanley and Samantha Stosur 6-3, 6-3. 

Bhupathi had triumphed at Wimbledon and the US Open last year with Mary Pierce and Daniela Hantuchova, respectively. 

Paes mixed doubles defeat wasnt the end of the world for him. He is in contention for the mens doubles crown after he and Martin Damm made the title round on Thursday. 

The seventh-seeded Indo-Czech pair won 6-2, 6-4 to end the run of unseeded Polish pair Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. 

Paes and Damm will meet top-seeded Americans Bob and Mike Bryan. (Agencies)

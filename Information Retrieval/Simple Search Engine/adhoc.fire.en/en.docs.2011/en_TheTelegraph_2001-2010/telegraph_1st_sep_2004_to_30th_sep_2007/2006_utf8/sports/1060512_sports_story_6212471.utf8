The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 On Thursday, four East Bengal players ? Mike Okoro, Naseem Akhtar, Debabrata Roy and Amandeep Singh ? called on their former coach Subhas Bhowmick, who is currently in charge of Mohammedan Sporting. 

 Their visit at the Mohammedan Sporting ground in the morning ? when Bhowmick was training his wards ? could have had a significant bearing in the light of a few East Bengal players? apparent grudge over the Belgian coach Philippe de Ridder?s way of functioning. 

 Bhowmick, however, doused such speculation, saying it was nothing but a courtesy call.

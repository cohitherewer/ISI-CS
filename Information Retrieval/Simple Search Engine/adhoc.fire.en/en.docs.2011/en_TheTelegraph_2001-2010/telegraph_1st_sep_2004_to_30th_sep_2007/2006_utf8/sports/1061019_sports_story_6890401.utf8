 Now, Asif pleads innocence

 - Fast bowler says it could be injections he took during recovery 

 Asif 

Islamabad: Young fast bowler Mohammed Asif, caught for a doping offence, has pleaded innocence. 

Asif, who was recalled from the ongoing Champions Trophy in India along with fellow speedster Shoaib Akhtar on Monday after the duo tested positive for banned steroid nandrolone, said it could be due of the injections he took to recover from his elbow injury. 

I have never used any performance enhancing drugs in my life. I can tell you very honestly that I have never ever come near to such substances, Asif said breaking his silence over the dope fiasco. 

The only possibility is that there might be something in the injections I used during recovery of my injury. It is up to the board how they take our cases, he was quoted as saying in a daily. 

The fast bowler said he had taken the injections in full knowledge of doctors while recovering from his elbow injury. 

During my injury and recovery process, I did use some injections only with the permission of and prescription of doctors, Asif said. 

The 23-year-old talented bowler said he was shocked to hear the news of the positive tests because he could not even think of such a move at the start of his career. 

I never thought that I would be tested positive of any substance as I have not used anything like that. No young and upcoming bowler ever thinks of consuming such drugs. So no question arises of my involvement in such practices, he said. 

Asif also denied reports that he smoked cannabis during Pakistans recent tour of England. It is totally ridiculous. I have never used such things and those who are pointing at me should keep in mind the consequences.

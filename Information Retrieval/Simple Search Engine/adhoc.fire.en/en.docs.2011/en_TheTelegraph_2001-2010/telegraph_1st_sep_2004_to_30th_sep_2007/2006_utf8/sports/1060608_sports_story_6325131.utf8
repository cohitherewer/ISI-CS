Paris: Rafael Nadal moved on at the French Open when Novak Djokovic decided to stop. Defending champion Nadal advanced to the semi-finals and extended his record clay-court winning streak Wednesday by beating Djokovic, who retired with a back injury three points into the third set trailing 6-4, 6-4. 

Seeded second, the Spaniard won his 58th consecutive clay-court match and improved to 12-0 at Roland Garros. A potential Sunday showdown looms against top-ranked Roger Federer, but first Nadal must play on Friday against Ivan Ljubicic. 

Big-serving Ljubicic powered into his first Grand Slam semi-final when he ended French hope Julien Benneteaus run with a clinical 6-2, 6-2, 6-3 win on Wednesday. 

Benneteau, whose main ambition was to keep the ball in play, held serve for the first time when he levelled at 2-2 in the second set, only for Ljubicic to win the next four games and seal a two-set lead. 

The Croatian decisively broke to love for 4-2 in the decider when Benneteau double-faulted, before wrapping up the match after two hours 14 minutes. 

The result means it will be the first time since 1985 that the French Open semi-finals will feature all four top seeds. 

Spains Nadal reached the last four after Serbian Novak Djokovic pulled out of their quarter final with a back injury when two sets to love down. 

The unseeded Djokovic, playing in his first Grand Slam quarter final, hurt his back and sought treatment from a trainer after falling behind 3-0 in the second set. In the next game, he took a spill behind the baseline and rose hobbling. 

Djokovic won four more games but sometimes clutched his back and winced following shots. After hitting a backhand long in the first game of the third set, he walked to the net and conceded, frustrated by the missed opportunity against Nadal. 

The brevity of the one hour, 54 minute victory meant a welcome respite for Nadal, who had played 8 hours, 10 minutes in his previous two matches. 

 The womens semi-finals will 

 be on Thursday. Two-time champion Justine Henin-Hardenne 

 plays two-time runner-up Kim Clijsters in an all-Belgian 

 match-up, and 17-year-old Nicole Vaidisova faces former 

 US Open champion Svetlana Kuznetsova. 

 Paes-Kirilenko loses 

Indian challenge ended at the French Open with Leander Paes and his Russian partner Maria Kirilenko faltering at the quarter final hurdle of the mixed doubles event here on Wednesday. 

The Indo-Russian pair were handed over a 3-6, 3-6 defeat by sixth seeds Martina Navratilova and Bob Bryan of US at the Chatrier court. 

Earlier, Mahesh Bhupathi, who teamed up with Martina Hingis, and Sania Mirza, who combined with Paul Hanley of Australia, have already bowed out of contention.

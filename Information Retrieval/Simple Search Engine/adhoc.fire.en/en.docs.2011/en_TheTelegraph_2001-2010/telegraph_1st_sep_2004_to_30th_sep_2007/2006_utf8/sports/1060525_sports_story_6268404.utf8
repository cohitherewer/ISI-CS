 Quick Takes

 Vieira, family gassed and robbed at 

 home

 Nice: Police are investigating 

 reports that France midfielder Patrick Vieira and his family 

 were robbed in their villa on the French Riviera. The player 

 has filed a complaint, saying intruders seized jewels at 

 his home in Cannes last weekend and drove away with his 

 Mercedes, a police source said on Wednesday, confirming 

 media reports.

 The car was later found abandoned 

 in Nice. The burglary occurred the night before Vieira joined 

 Frances camp in the French Alps resort of Tignes. 

 According to reports in the French and British media, the 

 intruders used gas to make sure that Vieira, his wife Cheryl 

 and her teenaged daughter would not wake up.

 Ballack fined 60000 euros

 London: German football 

 captain and new Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack has been 

 fined 60,000 euros for failing to declare a handbag he bought 

 in Dubai at airport customs, according to a German newspaper. 

 Ballack bought the handbag for his girlfriend in January 

 and it was found in his luggage at Munich airport.

 FA plans party

 London: The FA may be tempting 

 fate by planning an England World Cup victory parade that 

 will culminate in tea with the queen at Buckingham Palace. 

 The Times has learnt that the queen, after overtures 

 from the FA, will make time in her diary for a reception 

 should David Beckham return with an all-conquering team 

 after the final on July 9. July 11 has been pencilled in 

 for the celebration.

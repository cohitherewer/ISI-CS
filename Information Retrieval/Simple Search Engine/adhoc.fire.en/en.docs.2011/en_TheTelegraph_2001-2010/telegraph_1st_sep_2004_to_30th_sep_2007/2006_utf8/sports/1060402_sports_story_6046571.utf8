The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 England didnt expect Raina to 

 be that good

 -I am amazed at Indias ability to throw up new stars 

 every day 

 Taking Guard

 Graham Gooch

I wonder if England missed a trick in not attacking India enough when the critical sixth wicket stand was beginning to take shape in the second one-dayer. A meagre total can only be defended if the opposition is bowled out. Teams bat way down these days and there are no rabbits. Rahul Dravid did it so well in Delhi with his small total; it was Freddies chance to catch the hint in Faridabad. 

Maybe he, or none of us, suspected Suresh Raina to be that good. Raina, who had dropped a chance in the morning, was not asked to bowl his tweakers on a spinning surface and was caught for a good few seconds by James Anderson in his follow-through. 

Raina then let England feel the weight of his talent in the final hour and two of his signature strokes ? one a thump over mid-on against Andrew Flintoff, no less, and a scoop over fine leg will be frozen in memory for long. Indian cricket has discovered a new hero. 

I am amazed at Indias ability to throw up new stars every day though admittedly it does not say much about England. 

Rainas and Powars can make the likes of Dhonis and Pathans look old hats and can give jitters to Yuvraj-Kaif combine in batting and Harbhajan in bowling. Suddenly and not so silently, a revolution is apparently taking place in India. 

Powar was impressive. His success proves that you do not have to bowl doosra all the time to earn your wickets. He beat the two Andrews, Strauss and Flintoff, in flight and dip. He is a conventional orthodox spinner, the likes of which you do not see in international arena these days. May be a little less girth around his middle would allow him to accept such a dolly as he missed in his follow-through. 

All of India may swoon if they must, but please do not ignore the stench too. Your top order has been failing too regularly: it has happened in Karachi and Mumbai in Tests and Delhi and Faridabad in one-dayers. Dravid was too clever by half in feigning a run and Mohammed Kaifs attempted pull on a pitch such as this was dreadful. 

Yuvraj Singh attempted a cut against the spin and Virender Sehwag and Gautam Ghambir, despite the early promise, triggered a collapse, which quickly changed a position of 61 for no loss to 80 for four. 

England, meanwhile, continue on their journey towards self-doubt. 

They could have won both the games, but thats hardly comforting. One-dayers, by their very nature, can go either way. There is no credit in running the opposition close if you are pipped at the finishing line. 

I do not argue with Matt Priors promotion as an opener for he is aggressive and has enjoyed good success for Sussex. I am also inclined to ignore Paul Collingwoods failures even though his run out was as daft as you would see in an international arena. But either Strauss or Kevin Pieterson really needed to push on till the end. 

Most of the top batters in one-day cricket like to get in early and remain till the overs run out. The ones of England have been inept in this matter. So many single digit scores in the scoreboard is not pretty at all. 

There was also a crying need to have a second spinner in the line-up. 

Gareth Batty should have played on a surface where India tried everyone with pretensions of being a spinner. India invariably have two spinners on their low and slow surfaces. 

Coach Duncan Fletcher says all the slots in Englands team for one-dayers are more or less settled. He must be having the likes of Steve Harmison, Simon Jones, Marcus Trescothick, Ashley Giles and Michael Vaughan in mind. But the relentless diet of one-day cricket has shown that the second string should be interchangeable. 

If India are not missing Sachin Tendulkar or Sourav Ganguly and are taking the failure of Virender Sehwag in stride, its because no place is secure. There is a price tag on every slot. It is dangerous on the part of England coach to convey that moss could actually grow on most slots now perceived settled. (PTI)

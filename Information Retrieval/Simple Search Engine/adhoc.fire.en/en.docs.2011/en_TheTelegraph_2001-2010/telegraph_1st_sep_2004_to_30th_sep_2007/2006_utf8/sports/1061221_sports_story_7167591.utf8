 Muniyappa ahead in Bangalore 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: A six-under-par 66 was good enough to give local favourite Chinnaswamy Muniyappa the second round lead at the Rs 50 lakh EMAAR-MGF PGTI Championship, with a 36-hole total of six-under-par 138 on Wednesday. 

Overnight leader Harinder Gupta had a dream start but came apart after a double bogey on the par-four sixth hole, according to information received here. 

Gupta, S.S.P. Chowrasia, Gurbaaz Mann and Harmeet Kahlon were tied for the second place at five-under-par 139. 

Harinder dropped a shot on the 11th, double bogeyed the 12th after he hit his tee-shot out of bounds and followed it up with another bogey on the par-three 13th hole. 

He recovered with a birdie on the 15th but made yet another bogey on the 16th before carding a final birdie for the day on the 17th to card a 74.

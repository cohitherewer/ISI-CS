 All Indians likely to be dope-tested

Mumbai: All 14 Indian players making the Champions Trophy squad are likely to be dope-tested ahead of the ten-nation event scheduled in October-November. 

We are thinking on those lines To take urine samples of all those chosen for the tournament and send those to Malaysia or Thailand for dope-testing, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said here on Thursday. 

The ICC, meanwhile, announced that two players each from seven matches will be tested during the Champions Trophy. 

According to ICCs media and communications manager Brian Murgatroyd, the selection of teams and players will be done randomly. 

The tests will be as per Wada procedures as the ICC is now a Wada-compliant. 

The samples will be flown to Malaysia for analysis, as was the case during the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka earlier this year, Murgatroyd explained.

 Gibbs to come with lawyer

Durban: Herschelle Gibbs is determined to travel 

 to India for the ICC Champions Trophy accompanied by his 

 lawyer, given the possibility of Indian police interrogating 

 him for the match fixing scandal in 2000. 

 Yeah, I am going to go (to India), he 

 was quoted as saying in an interview to a magazine. But 

 my lawyers coming with me. I have put forward a proposal 

 to Cricket South Africa, which was discussed on Thursday. 

 I have proposed that my lawyer and I will travel with the 

 team, and once we get to the hotel, they can then do the 

 questioning at the hotel, Gibbs said. 

Gibbs said he was confident of clearing his name and blamed the New Delhi police for not playing their part. They havent really played their part. You know, weve asked them many a time to come question me on neutral territory, and they refuse. So its not like I havent made the effort. Its them being hard-a****. Thats it. 

I have got the 18 questions that they want to ask me. Its basically exactly the same stuff that I answered at the King commission. Ill just be repeating myself. 

 Gibbs said he thinks that compatriot Bojes case 

 was bit different.

 More sunshine will open up cracks: Boucher

Former captain Mark Boucher, the Proteas wicketkeeper, interacted with the Media on Friday evening. The following are excerpts: 

I dont think it was a mistake coming off when the light was offered on the first day... Ashwell (Prince) had been cramping... He had to make a call and made the right choice... The wicket has been playing pretty good, but more sunshine (on Saturday morning) will open up the cracks and its then going to become an up-and-down one... (Virender Sehwag) Veeru couldve taken the attack to us, but hes struggling in conditions away from home... He has a great eye, but the new ball does quite a bit in South Africa... Morne Motkel has batted very well... He has a good eye for the ball... Hes one for the future, as an allrounder... Im happy that Graeme (Smith) got runs... One doesnt become a bad batsman overnight or over a period of a few weeks... He has had to face criticism, but will emerge a better person and a better cricketer... Hopefully, his innings today is the start of a different era for him...

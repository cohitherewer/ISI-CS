 Donadoni new Italy coach

 Rome: The Italian soccer federation on Thursday named former Italy and AC Milan midfielder Roberto Donadoni as the national team coach, a news agency reported. 

Donadoni replaces Marcello Lippi, who resigned on Wednesday three days after guiding the Azzurri to their fourth World Cup title. Italian soccer federation chief Guido Rossi made the appointment, the agency reported. 

Donadoni started coaching in 2001, and joined Livorno in 2004. He stepped down this year despite leading the Tuscan team to sixth place in Serie A. 

Italy press saluted Lippi on Thursday. Goodbye and thank you, began an article on the front page of one daily. 

The voyage was not from coast to coast, but from the rough waters to the smooth, from sea-sickness to pride, from disenchantment to true love, it said. 

Other tributes focused on the reasons behind Lippis departure. Several papers claimed Lippi had grown tired of hearing his name mentioned in connection with the Serie A match-fixing scandal.

 Schumacher races into history 

 - Seven-time world champion first to win same grand prix eight times 

Magny-Cours: Ferraris Michael Schumacher made Formula One history in France on Sunday, becoming the first driver to win the same Grand Prix eight times. 

Schumachers commanding victory, from pole position on a sweltering Sunday afternoon at Magny-Cours, left the seven-time champion 17 points adrift of Renaults Fernando Alonso with seven races remaining. 

Spaniard Alonso, the runaway winner in France last year on his way to becoming the sports youngest world champion, took second place. 

Schumacher crossed the line 10.131 seconds clear of the field, lapping all but the top seven, for his 150th appearance on the podium. 

Looking at this race...We clearly have made up ground, said Schumacher. It (the championship) is far from being over. 

Obviously its going to be a battle in development but its a great result when you see this weekend and how difficult it has been at times. 

Brazilian Felipe Massa was third for Ferrari, with both Ferraris making three pit stops ? one more than Alonso ? in a race without any major incident. 

It was the 88th win in Schumachers career, his fourth of the season and eighth at Magny-Cours. 

We had a great start and drove our race from there, said Schumacher. We were not sure how the race would go because we didnt do any long runs (in practice). 

So it was a little bit of a guess how the race would go but I have to say that the car, the tyres, the whole package really worked perfectly. 

The German thanked his mechanics for a great job after his car caught fire in Saturdays free practice, an incident that the team played down at the time as they raced to make repairs before qualifying. 

Schumachers history-making achievement was not the sort that the yellow-and-blue-shirted fans crowding the grandstands had hoped to see, 100 years after Renault won the first French GP at Le Mans. 

After Italys World Cup final success over France in Schumachers native Germany last Sunday, an Italian team had once again dashed French hopes with Ferrari dominant in Renaults home race. 

Alonso put the result into perspective, however. 

To be second, on a difficult weekend for us, is a perfect result, said the Spaniard, who pushed Massa hard into the first corner but then had to wait until the pitstops to go past. 

It was close, I was nearly on the grass at one point so I had to back off, he said. 

Schumacher, already far and away the most successful driver in F1 history, punched the air with his fists as he crossed the line for his second win in a row after Indianapolis on July 2. 

Out of the car, the 37-year-old hugged French team boss Jean Todt with the Italian flag in his hands. 

Schumachers younger brother Ralf was fourth for Toyota, after leading for two laps at the first stops, ahead of McLarens Kimi Raikkonen. 

Italian Giancarlo Fisichella was sixth for Renault, with Spaniard Pedro de la Rosa seventh and back on the scoresheet for McLaren after a years absence. 

Test driver de la Rosa was replacing Colombian Juan Pablo Montoya, who announced last weekend that he was leaving F1 for the US Nascar series next year. 

Germanys Nick Heidfeld took the final point for BMW Sauber. 

Meanwhile, Formula Ones governing body has dismissed as wholly inadequate an offer by car manufacturers to create a 40 million euro ($50.70 million) fund to help independent teams secure affordable engines. 

At the same time, champions Renault disassoc- iated themselves from the proposal. 

A statement issued earlier by the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) ? grouping BMW, Renault, DaimlerChrysler, Honda and Toyota ? said the fund would help cut costs considerably for smaller teams over the next four years. 

The engine fund provides the opportunity for an independent engine supplier to plan a structured development programme and ensure its engines remain competitive and affordable, the statement said. 

This initiative is without precedent in motor sport and represents a significant effort to reach out to all teams, in the best interest of the sport. 

Renault said the GPMA statement was released without their agreement and they were not a party to it. 

The manufacturers made the offer as part of attempts to stave off a total freeze on engine development from 2008, when the Concorde Agreement governing the sport expires. 

 The governing International Automobile Federation 

 (FIA) has said that next season will start with engines 

 returning to the developmental stage they were at in June 

 this year.

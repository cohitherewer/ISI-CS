 Kapur-Ghei to battle for berth

Kuala Lumpur: Shiv Kapur and Gaurav Ghei will lead the Indian challenge for one of the two berths available for the 2006 WGC-World Cup of Golf to be held in Barbados in December. 

The Indian duo, along with Malaysias Danny Chia and Iain Steel and Singapores Mardan Mamat and Lam Chih Bing, will be the main contenders for two tickets to the WGC-World Cup when 14 nations tee off in the qualifiers at Seri Selangor Golf Club on Wednesday. 

The WGC-World Cup will be staged at Sandy Lane Resort in Barbados from December 7-10. The format for the qualifier is the same as the World Cup, with four-ball golf played on the first and third days and foursomes (or alternate shot) played on the second and final days.

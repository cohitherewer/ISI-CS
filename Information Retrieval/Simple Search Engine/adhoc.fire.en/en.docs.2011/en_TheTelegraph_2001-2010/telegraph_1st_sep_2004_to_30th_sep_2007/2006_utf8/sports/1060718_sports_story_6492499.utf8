 Sourav fails, Northants struggle

London: Sourav Ganguly failed to make amends for his first innings flop, managing just two in the second essay for Northamptonshire who were staring at defeat in a four-day Division II County Championship match against Surrey. 

Northants needed a big hearted display from their top-order batsmen after they were set a daunting target of 453 but none could stand up to the task, leaving the side tottering at 97 for six in the second innings (as reported in Mondays Late City Edition). 

Sourav (1/29), though, could take some consolation from the fact that he got rid of JN Batty when he appeared unstoppable at 133. 

The former Indian captain had scored six while taking one wicket in the first innings. 

Surrey made 328 and 424 for six declared in their two innings while Northants scored 300 in their first. 

Elsewhere, Dinesh Mongia met almost similar fate, being out to his second consecutive duck. However, he did pick two wickets for 62 for Leicestershire against Glamorgan in another four-day match.

 Dutch may field 2nd-string side vs Argentina

Freiburg: Having a fit and full line-up for the second round is more important to the Dutch coach Marco van Basten than topping the first-round group. 

Van Basten was leaning toward resting several key players for Wednesdays match against Argentina, which will determine first and second places in Group C. 

Six Dutch players have yellow cards and if any of them get another against Argentina, they would miss next weekends game. The winners of Group C meet the second-placed team from Group D in the next phase. 

We will avoid running risks where we can, Van Basten said on Sunday. It is important that you have the strongest possible team in the second round, goalie Edwin van der Sar said.

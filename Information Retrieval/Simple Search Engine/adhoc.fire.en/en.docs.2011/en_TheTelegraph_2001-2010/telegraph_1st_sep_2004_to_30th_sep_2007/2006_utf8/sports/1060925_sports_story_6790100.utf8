 (From top) Wasim Akram, 

 Wes Hall, Michael Holding, Dennis Lillee and Malcolm 

 Marshall

Kuala Lumpur: A generation was fascinated by Jeffrey Thomsons slinging action and fiery pace. His lethal partnership with firebrand Dennis Lillee, too. On Sunday, The Telegraph requested Thomson (200 Test wickets and 55 in ODIs) to pick his top five speed merchants. On a TV assignment here, he didnt have to think long and out came the names, as quick as anything hed hurled at terrified batsmen. 

Here goes his top five (alphabetically): 

 WASIM AKRAM: Boy, 

 he made the ball talk... He could bowl any which way he 

 wanted and kept doing that till the day he retired. He was 

 a handful. 

 Akram played for Pakistan between 1985-2003. Tests 104 (414 wickets); ODIs 356 (502 wickets). 

 WES HALL: He 

 was a great bowler who also indulged in showmanship... As 

 I told you in an earlier interview, he made a big impact 

 on me when I was young. 

 Hall played for the West Indies between 1958-1969. Tests 48 (192 wickets). 

 MICHAEL HOLDING: 

 I loved watching him... He was smooth and just glided i 

 ... Made for a terrific sight visually, but was effective 

 as well. 

 Holding played for the West Indies between 1975-1987. Tests 60 (249 wickets); ODIs 102 (142 wickets). 

 Jeff Thomson

 DENNIS LILLEE: 

 Oh, he was flamboyant, had flair... He was aggressive and 

 a true pro in every sense... Nothing ever stopped him from 

 doing whatever he wanted to do. 

 Lillee played for Australia between 1971-1984. Tests 70 (355 wickets); ODIs 63 (103 wickets). 

 MALCOLM MARSHALL: He 

 was such a good bowler... Besides having quality, he would 

 be quick and the best thing is that he got wickets all over 

 the world. A class act. 

 The late Marshall played for the West Indies between 1978-1992. Tests 81 (376 wickets); ODIs 136 (157 wickets).

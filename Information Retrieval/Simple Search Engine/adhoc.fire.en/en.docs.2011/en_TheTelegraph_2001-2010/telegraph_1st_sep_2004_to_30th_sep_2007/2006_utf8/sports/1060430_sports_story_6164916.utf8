 Quick- Takes

 Cup tour ends

 Riyadh: The World Cup 

 ended its first global tour on Saturday with a public display 

 in a Saudi Arabian shopping mall.

 The reception of the trophy 

 in each country was outstanding. We had very emotional people, 

 people who were crying, said Alex Koch, a Fifa official, 

 who toured 28 countries with the gold trophy. 

 The most impressive reaction 

 we got was from an 80-year-old man in Ecuador, in Quito, 

 who said it was the highlight of his life, to see the trophy 

 before dying, Koch said. In Saudi Arabia, the reception 

 was more conservative as hundreds of young men in white 

 robes and red headscarves queued to have their picture taken 

 beside the coveted Cup, which began its world tour in Ghana 

 in January.

 The Cup was designed by Silvio 

 Gazzaniga and awarded for the first time at the 1974 finals. 

 The original Jules Rimet trophy was won outright by Brazil 

 when they became world champions for the third time in 1970.

 Saudis joked that this could be 

 the closest they will ever get to soccers most famous 

 prize. 

 Welcome move

 Berlin: A court decision, 

 clearing the way for harsher penalties against streakers 

 who disrupt soccer matches by running on to the pitch, was 

 welcomed by Germanys World Cup organising committee 

 on Saturday.

 Horst R. Schmidt, the committees 

 vice president, said Fridays court ruling upholding 

 a 10,000 euro ($12,550) fine against a streaker would serve 

 as a deterrent.

 Were certain that 

 this ruling will have an effect during the World Cup and 

 are delighted to have the appropriate legal means at our 

 disposal now, he said in a statement. It has 

 been made quite clear that these are not simply misdemeanours.

 Tunisia plan

 Tunis: Tunisia will host 

 a tournament involving Uruguay, Belarus and Libya to prepare 

 for the World Cup finals in Germany, the Tunisian Football 

 Federation (TFF) said on Saturday.

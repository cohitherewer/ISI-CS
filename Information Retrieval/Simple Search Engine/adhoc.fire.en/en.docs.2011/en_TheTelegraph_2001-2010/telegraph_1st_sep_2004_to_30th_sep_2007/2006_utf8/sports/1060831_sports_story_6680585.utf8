 Anjum hits 98 in Indias 307

London: Anjum Chopra hit a gritty 98 to help India eves score 307 in their first innings against England on the second day of the second and final Test at Taunton on Wednesday. 

Chopra, who was batting on 56 overnight, stayed firm even as wickets kept tumbling at the other end. Chopra was, however, unfortunate to be out leg before to Isha Guha just two runs short of her century. 

Resuming at their overnight score of 168 for 2, India squandered a good position and could add 139 runs while losing 8 wickets. 

Brief Scores: India 307 (Anjum Chopra 98, Mithali Raj 65, Rumeli Dhar 43; Isha Guha 4/61) vs England. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ill soon get back to the top: Anand

New Delhi: Indias chess legend Viswanathan Anand believes his record fifth Corus Super Grandmaster crown is the best answer to criticism that he lacks killer instinct. 

Some say I am too much of a gentleman to show killer instinct. I guess after my win in Corus, my critics will have to think of something new now, Anand said in a telephonic interview. 

The Indian super GM recently won the Corus meet at Wijk Aan Zee in The Netherlands for fifth time, surpassing the records of Hollands Max Euwe, Hungarys Lajos Portisch and Switzerlands Victor Korchnoi, who have won the title four times each and are no longer active players. 

Others who have won four times cannot compete with my record and all those who won it once will at least take four years to just catch up with me! said Anand, who first won the title as a 19-year-old in 1989 and repeated the feat in 1998, 2002 and 2004. 

In the process, Anand also crossed the coveted 2800 Elo rating for the first time in his career with 11 points from the elite tournament. 

But the veteran of 64 squares said the record was more significant to him than the rating. 

For me both the achievements are important. I was trying for the 2800 rating for quite some time. But I would say the record is more important to me. The rating is just a milestone, the first GM title-holder of the country said. 

Anand also revealed that he was looking to upstage Bulgarias Veselin Topalov from the top spot in Fides list. 

Of course, if you are playing at this level you ought to be competitive. For that you have to play a lot of tournaments. I will soon get back to the top. 

Like Anand, Topalov also finished with six wins, six draws and one loss in Wijk Aan Zee meet ? against Michael Adams of England ? which the Indian feels is one of the strongest events currently. 

Clearly, it is the biggest event of the year and this year it was most interesting as there were a lot of decisive games, around 42 to 45 per cent, which is a very high number, said Anand, who rated the title as the best achievement of his career, on a par with his World Championship win in Tehran in 2002. 

The Madrid-based player was satisfied with his performance. 

A win is not always indicative of your level of play but I am overall happy with my performance. I have played many good games and +5 is a winning score in such tournaments with the top players of the world, said Anand, who had +6 score in 1998 edition. 

About his only defeat in the event ? against old nemesis Gata Kamsky ? he said it had pulled his morale down and he had to really exert himself to make a comeback. 

There are days when you wake up and just about everything goes horribly wrong. It was one such day. I had to win three matches just to exorcise the ghost of that game. I chose a line that was bad and as they say in chess, all moves in a bad position are bad. 

On his last round victory, he said: When I knew I had a good chance to win, the thought did cross my mind that this was the moment and I just had to seize it. So I thought for a long time and made sure that I had the game nailed. Actually, I didnt realise that I had crossed 2800.

 Quick Takes

 Cole has skills of a Brazilian: Pele

 London: England midfielder 

 Joe Cole has the skills of a Brazilian, according to Pele. 

 But the three-time World Cup winner believes the Chelsea 

 star needs to work on his game and learn to concentrate 

 on when to keep things plain and when to elaborate. 

 The three-time World Cup winner 

 echoed the sentiments of his club manager Jose Mourinho 

 when he said: Joe Cole is a very good player. 

 He has the skills of a Brazilian 

 but he needs to learn when to show the skills and when to 

 play the simple game. The tricks are fine at 3-0 or 4-0 

 but not at 0-0 or 1-1. When I was playing and it was 0-0 

 we would keep it the ball and pass it around.

 Pele said that Cole could learn 

 from watching the World Footballer of the Year: Ronaldinho 

 knows when to do the tricks and when to keep it simple. 

 That is why he is so good.

 Newcastle boss hits out 

 London: Freddy Shepherd, 

 the Newcastle United chairman, has criticised England for 

 the way they have handled news of Michael Owens latest 

 injury. Owen, the England and Newcastle forward, required 

 a scan on a tight thigh muscle after training on Monday. 

 No damage was revealed but Shepherd only found out about 

 the problem through the media. 

 I am disappointed that none 

 within the England camp informed us, he said. Weve 

 cooperated all the way along with England to help Michael, 

 and thats why this is disappointing. 

 Well be making our 

 feelings known and seeking an explanation from the England 

 team management.

 New plans for Rooney 

 Manchester: Wayne Rooney 

 will fly to Germany with Englands World Cup squad 

 on Monday, then return to England two days later for a new 

 CT scan on his broken foot.

 The 20-year-old Manchester United 

 striker will be travelling to and from Germany so that England 

 coach Sven-Goran Eriksson and his medical team can assess 

 his chances of playing in the June 9-July 9 World Cup. The 

 FA said on Tuesday that Rooney would go with the rest of 

 the squad to Baden-Baden and come back on June 7 for the 

 scan on the broken metatarsal bone in his right foot.

 Zambrotta to miss opener 

 London: Italy international 

 Gianluca Zambrotta will miss his countrys World Cup 

 opener against Ghana on June 12. The Juventus midfielder 

 sustained a thigh injury during training last weekend and 

 will need at least two weeks to recover. 

 The Italy team doctor said that 

 if all went weel, he Zambrotta would be back in 15 to 20 

 days. 

 Petkovics own 

 goal

 Belgrade: Serbia and Montenegro 

 coach Ilija Petkovic has called up his son Dusan Petkovic, 

 a defender, to replace injured striker Mirko Vucinic at 

 the World Cup finals. Vucinic was ruled out last week after 

 injuring his knee.

 The Belgrade media called Petkovics 

 decision a scandal and a self-goal 

 because Dusan has not had an impact in the national team 

 and did not take part in World Cup qualification. 

 Dusan, 32, has 12 caps for the 

 national team, but none in official matches.

 Fresh scare for Van der Vaart

 Amsterdam: Rafael van der 

 Vaart suffered a fresh ankle injury when the Netherlands 

 resumed their World Cup preparations on Monday. The midfielder 

 was sidelined during Saturdays 1-0 win over Cameroon 

 and abandoned Mondays session after a ball struck 

 his recently operated-on ankle.

 Rosicky injury not serious

 Prague: Czech midfielder 

 Tomas Rosicky is expected to recover in time for the World 

 Cup finals after a medical check-up showed his leg injury 

 was not serious. 

 The medical examination 

 came out in an excellent way. It is nothing serious, 

 a daily quoted coach Karel Brueckner as saying. Rosicky 

 picked up the injury in the friendly against Saudi Arabia 

 on Friday.

 Ban comes into effect

 London: Some 3,300 banning 

 orders introduced to prevent known English hooligans from 

 travelling to the World Cup in Germany came into force on 

 Tuesday. 

 The orders, introduced following 

 riots by England fans in Belgium during Euro 2000, are central 

 to the governments drive to prevent fans causing trouble 

 during the tournament.

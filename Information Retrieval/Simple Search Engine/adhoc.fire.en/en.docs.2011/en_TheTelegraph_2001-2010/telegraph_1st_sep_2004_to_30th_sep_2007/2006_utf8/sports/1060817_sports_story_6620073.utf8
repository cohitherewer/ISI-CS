 Strauss ready to lead in Ashes

London: Andrew Strauss is ready to accept captaincy if he is offered the role ahead of the Ashes series. 

The left-handed opener, leading England in the absence of Andrew Flintoff, was asked at a new conference at The Oval on the eve of the fourth and final Test against Pakistan whether he would like to continue in the hot seat. 

Absolutely, he said. I have enjoyed doing it and, if asked, it would be a massive honour. But likewise if they (the England selectors) think Freddy is the man he will have my 100 per cent support. Whatever happens, there are going to be 15 or 16 guys going to Australia with the sole intention of retaining that Urn. That will happen regardless of who is captain. 

Meanwhile, Aussie speedster Brett Lee is fired up to regain the Ashes and looking forward to teaming up again with fellow fast bowler Glenn McGrath. The 29-year-old says he feels rejuvenated after three months rest and cannot wait to take on the England batsmen when the series begins in Brisbane on November 23. 

The Ashes is going to be absolutely amazing and its possibly the biggest series I will ever play in, Lee said. Im pumped for it. 

Lee is looking forward to opening the bowling with McGrath, who is stepping up his fitness bid after missing the tours of South Africa and Bangladesh to help wife Jane recover from cancer. 

It would be great to be back bowling with Glenn, Lee said.He is training very hard and says hes bowling as quick as he ever has done.

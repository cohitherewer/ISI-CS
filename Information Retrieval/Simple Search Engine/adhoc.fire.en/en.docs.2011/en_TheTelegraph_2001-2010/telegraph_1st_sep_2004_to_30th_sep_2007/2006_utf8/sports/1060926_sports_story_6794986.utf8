 Sourav set to be included in Challenger

 Sourav Ganguly

Mumbai: Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag are set to lead two of the three teams in the Challenger Trophy limited-overs meet. The third team is going to be led either by Yuvraj Singh or Mohammed Kaif. 

The selectors meet here on Tuesday to pick the teams. 

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly will also be included in one of the teams. Test specialists Anil Kumble and VVS Laxman are also expected to be named. 

The trio was among the 30-strong probables list announced for the ICC Champions Trophy. 

The tournament is in Chennai from October 1-4. 

Players out of action for long due to injury Ashish Nehra, Laxmipathy Balaji and Murali Kartik should also make the grade. 

Bengals Ranadeb Bose may also get a look-in. Shib Shankar Paul, who was among the probables, will not be considered after having undergone a knee surgery recently.

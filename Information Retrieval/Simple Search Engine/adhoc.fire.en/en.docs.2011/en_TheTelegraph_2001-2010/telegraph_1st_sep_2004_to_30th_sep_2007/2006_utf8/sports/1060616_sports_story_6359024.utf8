 Match vs Iran will be like final: Figo

 Luis Figo in Marienfeld on Thursday 

Marienfeld: Playmaker Luis Figo said on Thursday that Portugals World Cup game against Iran would be like a final with both teams desperate to get the full three points albeit for different reasons. 

I expect a difficult game because it will be one of the last chances for Iran to try to get through to the next round, the Portuguese said. Everyone knows that if they get a negative result they will be out. 

In contrast, if we win we will qualify for the next round. It is like a final for both teams, he said of Saturdays Group D clash in Frankfurt. 

Iran lost 1-3 to Mexico in their first Group D game. Portugal beat Angola 1-0 in their opener. 

I dont have to prove my abilities to anyone as a player, he said. It will not be at the end of my career that I start proving what I can do. I am here to do my best in a top competition.

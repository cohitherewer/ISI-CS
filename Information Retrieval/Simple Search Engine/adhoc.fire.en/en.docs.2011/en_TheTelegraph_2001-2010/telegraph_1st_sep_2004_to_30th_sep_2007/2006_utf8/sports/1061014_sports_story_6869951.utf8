The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are building up good momentum, says Lara

 - Controlling extras biggest concern for Sri Lanka 

 Brian Lara in Mumbai on Friday 

Mumbai: West Indies captain Brian Lara on Friday said his team was capable of winning the Champions Trophy and was building up a winning momentum towards it. 

Lara was drawing confidence from the last edition of the tournament when West Indies defied all odds to win the coveted trophy. 

Were building up the momentum. The guys are aware that we are defending champions and that puts some pressure on us, but that is good pressure, the 37-year-old said. 

We understand that and are looking to hold on to the trophy again. Weve beaten the best in the world in this tournament two years ago and were capable of doing it again, the Trinidadian said. 

Sri Lanka skipper Mahela Jayawardene also wants his team to retain the winning momentum on Saturday. 

Winning is a very good habit. We will try and win as many matches as possible, the Lanka skipper told mediapersons. 

Sri Lanka coach Tom Moody said that the team was looking forward to the challenge presented by the West Indies. 

Its an important match. Its a big challenge for us after two confident wins by the West Indies and we are looking forward to the tough challenge, Moody said. 

Moody said the biggest area of concern for the Lankans was controlling the extras and the bowlers have been working on this. 

There are a number of areas we want to improve on and the biggest is the issue of no balls and wides. We have been working on this area and it is on the top of our list of priorities, he said. 

Lara said his team will go all out for a win on Saturday to avoid making it to pool A which has tough opponents in India, Australia and England. 

Wed like to win tomorrow. Obviously the preference would be group B. In a tournament like this, no team wants to have to pick themselves up and dissect a loss. We play every single game to win, the Windies skipper said. 

Recalling his numerous past battles with ace Lanka spinner Muttiah Muralidharan, Lara said he always enjoyed the on-field battles with the spin wizard. 

 Its (battle against Murali) been great over the years. Weve had some good contests some Ive won and some hes won. Weve really enjoyed playing against each other. And having Murali as a teammate in the world series was excellent, he said. 

Ive been lucky to have batted well against him and this is another opportunity, and its not going to be an easy test. But its not so important who wins the battle between Murali and Lara. Whats important is who wins the battle between West Indies and Sri Lanka, he added. 

While stating that Ramnaresh Sarwan would bat at No. 3, Lara said that all the players, including fast bowler Fidel Edwards, were fit. 

I only batted at No. 3 because I hadnt had a hit in the practice game, whereas Sarwan had, so I went ahead of him. Our No. 3 spot is occupied by Sarwan. 

Lara said he had not had a look at the wicket before coming to meet the media. 

The outfield had a bit of sprinkling, so I couldnt make a fair judgment. I understand theres a bit of dew in Mumbai this time of the year, so well play it as we see it, he said. 

Asked whether he was reminded of South African Jonty Rhodes extraordinary catching in the last game he had played at the Brabourne Stadium in 1990, Lara said it had happened a long while ago. 

I was reminded of that, but that was so long ago. Its always good to come out and play in India. To have an outing at the CCI is something were looking forward to. Its been a long time but its good to be still playing cricket at this venue.

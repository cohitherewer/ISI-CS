 Australia thrash Argentina 6-0

Terrassa (Spain): Australia thrashed Argentina 6-0, Spain snatched a 3-2 last-gasp win over Pakistan and The Netherlands sweated to a 3-3 draw with Germany in the mens Champions Trophy field hockey tournament here. 

The defending champions bounced back from their 3-5 humbling at the hands of their Spanish hosts earlier this week as the Latin Americans usual energy and drive appeared to desert them. 

In the earlier match, Spain seemed in control 2-1 thanks to a field goal and a penalty conversion by Santiago Freixa with just two minutes left on the clock. 

But then Sohail Abbas pulled level with a penalty corner conversion after Akhtar Ali had opened Pakistans scoring with a deflection at the right post on a cross by Mohammed Saqlain. 

However, Mohammed Imran limped off the field and, with 10 seconds left to the final whistle, Spanish captain Francisco Fabregas took a free hit outside the circle to Sergi Enrique whose shot high into the goal had the home crowd celebrating.

 East Bengal lift Super Cup 

Mumbai: It was sweet revenge for East Bengal as they defeated National League champions Mahindra United 2-1 to lift the ONGC Super Cup title here on Saturday. 

East Bengal, took a 2-0 lead in the first half through strikes by Ndem Guy Herve and Alvito DCunha. 

Mahindra came back strongly in the second to reduce the margin in the 66th minute through Yusif Yakubu. 

They made some good moves in the first half but failed to get the much-needed equaliser. 

In the absence of star striker Bhaichung Bhutia, the left-footed Alvito played a stellar role by paving the way for the opening strike and then scoring the second with his swerving corner kick. 

Alvito measured corner kick in the 23rd minute found an unmarked Ndem who headed home to give the red-and-gold brigade the lead. 

The stand in captain then scored the second ten minutes later when again his swinging flag-kick deceived Mahindra custodian Subashish Roy Chowdhury to make it 2-0 for the Calcutta outfit.

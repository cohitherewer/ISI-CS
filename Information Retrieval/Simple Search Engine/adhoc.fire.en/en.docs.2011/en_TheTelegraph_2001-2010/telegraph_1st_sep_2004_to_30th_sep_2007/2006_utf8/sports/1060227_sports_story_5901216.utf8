 English challenge will ignite Sachin 

 Guest Column

Indias pin-up boy, Sachin Tendulkar, is only 32, but he has achieved immense things in his career, setting records which ensure that his place in cricket history is safe. It should be enough, but he carries the expectations of a cricket-mad nation on his shoulders and must be aware of the questions that continue to be asked about his worth to the Indian team. 

Are the runs he scores matchwinning contributions? Is he being overtaken by Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag? And does he have the determination to see his career through these next few years? Tendulkar deals with criticism in a polite fashion and has answered most of these questions with his bat. He would not be human if there hadnt been times when he has felt tired or less inspired than at his peak. Nobody can sustain an output like his forever. Somehow, he has continued to produce innings of the highest quality, although he did struggle in Pakistan recently. 

The challenge of England in India will, I am sure, rouse him again. The last time England toured there in 2001-02 the magic was very much alive. 

It was fascinating to watch how Tendulkar dealt with Englands bowling, as well as the huge demands of the Indian cricket-loving public, the millions of his fans around this vast country and the tens of thousands who come to watch him play. 

In Ahmedabad in the second Test of that series he was not out overnight on a day when the ground was about two-thirds full ? above average for modern Test-match crowds in this part of the world ? and they returned the next day to see him make his hundred. 

Once he had achieved that, and as soon as he was out, most of them left, leaving the stands looking decidedly empty. That is his pulling power. 

For some, that pressure would tell, but he shows no signs that he is feeling any extra burden. I suspect that having Dravid, Sehwag and V.V.S. Laxman to keep him company in one of the worlds strongest batting line-ups helps take some of the pressure off, because he is not relied upon to win matches single-handed. 

He also likes the sense of competition of batting with those men, especially Sehwag, who was the junior partner last time round. There was a special passage of play in Bangalore five years ago when the two men batted together. You could see that the Grand Master did not wish to be overshadowed by the Young Pretender when Sehwag began to play some extraordinary shots against the spin of Ashley Giles, bowling over the wicket into the rough. 

Giles was trying to keep things quiet. Sehwag thought the decibel level needed raising and did so brilliantly. Tendulkar watched quietly from the other end as the Sehwag onslaught began, and then decided to join in. The ball flew to all parts. It was a while before order was restored ? when Giles had Tendulkar stumped 10 short of a century after one stroll too many down the pitch ? and the batsmen had achieved a points victory. 

For a man who has been playing at the highest level since he was a teenager, and has succeeded against the best bowlers in the world, it is all about new challenges. The true pro might just set his stall out to repeat as best he can his peak form. The genius that is Tendulkar needs to find different ways of expressing himself, even if the same mental disciplines apply to everything he does. Picking a bowler to dominate or a colleague to match are two ways of finding new challenges day by day rather than the more dour tenets of batting that decree simply: Play each ball on its merits. He can do that, but he does a lot more besides, and that is what makes him special. 

It is also worth looking through his records, and checking when his runs have been crucial to India winning or losing a Test or a series. He has proved his worth to Indias cause during the past 17 years. And then some. 

Of course there have been failures and injuries. He has missed a lot of cricket recently, leading people to wonder how much is left in the tank. Only he will know, but we who can but watch will be more than content if he continues to delight all with his batting for a while yet. England will be working hard on plans to deny him during the coming weeks ? but if he is in the mood to make runs, then he probably will.

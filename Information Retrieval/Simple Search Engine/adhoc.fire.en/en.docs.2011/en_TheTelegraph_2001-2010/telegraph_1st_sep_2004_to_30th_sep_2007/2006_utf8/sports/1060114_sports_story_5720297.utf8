Calcutta: It went down to the wire and the Bengal youngsters showed character and determination in carving out a thrilling five-wicket victory over Railways at Eden Gardens on Friday. Bengal are into the Ranji semi-finals after three seasons, a huge turnaround in the teams fortunes after barely managing to cling on to the Elite group last year. 

We have done consistently well this season? This is the icing on the cake, satisfied coach Paras Mhambrey said. 

Subhamoy Das and Avishek Jhunjhunwala may have done the star turn with their 217-run second-wicket partnership, but this match was a triumph of the spirit and attitude of the youngsters. Besides Avisheks brilliant 139 and Subhamoys solid 83, there was Manoj Tewaris unbeaten 27 off 25 balls under immense pressure, Ranadeb Bose and Shib Shankar Pauls superb bowling in the first innings, Deep Dasguptas astute leadership and, of course, Mhambreys presence. 

Not many were optimistic when Railways declared at 321 for six an over after at lunch to set Bengal a target of 303 in 53 overs. Bengal, having nothing to lose, began on a positive note, Sourashish opening with Subhamoy. 

Sourashishs run-a-ball 24 set the tone ? 16 runs coming off the first two overs. As Avishek walked in at No. 3, the more experienced Railways bowlers could not have envisaged what awaited them. The pace and confidence with which Subhamoy and Avishek went about their task was exemplary. 

Avisheks 135-minute knock, that included 20 boundaries and a six, was an eye-opener. His maiden Ranji hundred in only his third match underlined his talent. Having benefited from Devang Gandhis withdrawal from the Gujarat tie, it was baptism by fire and he came out with flying colours. 

The 23-year-old stepped out against Murali Kartik and even reverse-swept the left-arm spinner who is a member of the Indian ODI team. It may be too early to pass judgement, but Avishek surely has it in him to go a long way. 

Subhamoy played the supporting role to perfection . The pairs departure, in a span of four overs, led to a couple of more wickets, but Tewari maintained a cool head. The involvement of the players was spontaneous and everyone was willing to play his part. Rohan Gavaskar, despite a stiff neck, walked out and gave Tewari company till the end. 

Bengal needed nine of the last over and Tewari hit the winning runs, off the penultimate delivery, past point amid tension and excitement. 

A visibly moved CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya announced an award of Rs 25,000 each for Avishek and Subhamoy, and Rs 1.5 lakh for the rest. 

Sadly, Amit Pagnis 103 and Yere Gouds 55 in the morning session was of little significance in the end. That Railways delayed their declaration was also forgotten in a hurry. The Bengal youngsters brave chase will, however, be remembered for long. 

Bengals semi-final battle against Baroda begins Friday.

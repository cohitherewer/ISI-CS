 Lara chose team over self by batting at No. 6

- Windies win will cause a flutter in the Indian camp

No Holds Barred

There will now be a flutter in the Indian camp. Australia and the West Indies wont be easy to get past by in the league stage. It could also be the challenge they need to come out of their slumber and get themselves moving for the World Cup in six months time. 

You just cannot help but look ahead given the way the West Indies came to the party on Wednesday. When the big boy fires, it sparks a revival in the ranks. Brian Lara led Runako Morton by hand; his innings was an affirmation that in conditions such as this, batting in the lower middle order is the best place for him. 

Coming in at No. 6 was a smart ploy by the captain who did not fall for the lure of a batting position where he could get the maximum runs being the best player in the side, instead choosing to be a glue in the middle where collective collapses have been routines in recent times. He chose team over self, maybe having Clive Lloyd as one of the backroom boys has helped. 

No less impressive was Adam Gilchrist, who showed a break of seven months did no harm to his spirit or form. When he plays in such a fashion, eschewing belligerence and buckling down to innings-management, Australia are doubly dangerous. He was a Tiger Woods using the wood sparingly. I hope the example is not lost on younger wicketkeepers of world cricket, like our own Mahendra Singh Dhoni. 

Another champion did not go unnoticed but it was for different reasons. Glenn McGrath has rarely been driven over his head or extra cover, much less hoisted over the tent by a No. 8 batsman in the line-up. 

But the Pigeon is just about returning after a long absence and the engine is sure to purr back to life soon. Well as Nathan Bracken bowled, Australia would still be better served when McGrath and Brett Lee share the new ball, especially on a surface which are harder as in Mohali. There is all the more reason to give McGrath the brand new cherry now that the pace is slipping. Better younger players are coming through the ranks for the West Indies which accounts for their recent turnaround. 

Dwayne Bravo, hattrick man Jerome Taylor and the two offies Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels all played critical hands. More and more it is apparent that it would be a folly to treat them as a one-pony bowling attack in Ian Bradshaw. 

Australia would be under pressure since their experiment with Shane Watson at the top of the order is not clicking. Ricky Ponting and Andrew Symonds need to do some damage, while sending Michael Hussey could be worth a thought. Even taking into account the vagaries of pitches in Malaysia and India, their relative low scores is unsettling. They have not been able to defend a 434; scores of over 300 have been few and far between, and eight losses have accrued from their 24 games this year. 

Put simply, Australia have lost every third game they have played. Cracks are beginning to show, and more and more teams want to find out if the tag of unbeatables is for real. 

The Champions Trophy is far from over and it is hazardous to form a report card. But the West Indies remain the most improved lot. India need to come out of slumber for they have the team to go the distance. 

Finally, it was fascinating to see Gayle wired up against the Aussies. The message was loud and clear. We kome to play maaan. Kool breeze you know.

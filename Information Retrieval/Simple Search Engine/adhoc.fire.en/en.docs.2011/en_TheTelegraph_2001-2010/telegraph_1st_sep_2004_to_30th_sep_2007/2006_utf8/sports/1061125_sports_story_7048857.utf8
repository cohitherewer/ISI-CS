 Munaf injury scare 

Cape Town: Team India were dealt a fresh injury blow on Friday with paceman Munaf Patel being laid low by a sore ankle ahead of the third ODI against South Africa. 

Munaf, who picked two wickets but bowled at a much slower pace in the second tie in Durban, had a sore left ankle and did not take part in the indoor net session at the University of Cape Town on Friday. 

According to a team spokesman, Munaf underwent a precautionary X-ray and should recover in time for the Sunday encounter. (PTI)

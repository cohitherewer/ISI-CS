 Issue should reach right conclusion: Dravid

Bangalore: Describing the ball tampering controversy involving the Pakistan team as sad and disappointing, Indian captain Rahul Dravid on Thursday said it was now important that the issue reached a right conclusion. 

It was a sad and disappointing event, Dravid said in reply to a question as the nine-day rolling camp here ahead of the Malaysia tri-series concluded on Thursday. 

Nobody wants to see a match being forfeited, he said. However, Dravid said it was time to move on from the controversy. I think we have got to move on from there. Whats happened, has happened, we cant change it and the series has gone on. 

England are playing Pakistan in a good one-day series, and the game of cricket goes on. I dont think it (ball tampering episode) is going to be a major blow to the game or make an impact. 

 I think there needs to be 

 some kind of conclusion, and i am sure towards the end of 

 the month, they will find that.

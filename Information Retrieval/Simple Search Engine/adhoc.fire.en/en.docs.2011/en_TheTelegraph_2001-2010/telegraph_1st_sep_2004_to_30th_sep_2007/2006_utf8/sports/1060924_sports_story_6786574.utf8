 Paes to team up with Qureshi 

 - ATP Mumbai Open 

Robredo seeded No. 1, Ancic second 

 Juan Martin del Porto of Argentina celebrates his 18th birthday in Mumbai on Saturday 

Mumbai: Leander Paes on Saturday said his US Open-winning partner Martin Damms Davis Cup commitments forced him to pair up with Pakistans Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi in the $380,000 Kingfisher Airlines Open starting here on Monday. 

Martin is playing Davis Cup at the moment in Holland where he will be playing till Sunday night European time, Paes said. 

Paes said he was looking forward to partnering Qureshi who was in the rival camp when India played Pakistan in the Davis Cup play-off tie here in April. 

Five months ago, we were rivals at the same venue in Mumbai, so its nice to be on the same side of the court this time. Its great to be partnering Aisam, whos an old friend. He is a serve and volley player, much like myself, which makes it interesting to see how well we gel on the court. 

Bhupathi is paired with Croatias world No. 13 singles player Mario Ancic. The pair won the title at China Open in Beijing last week. 

Meanwhile, world No. 7 Tommy Robredo of Spain and Croatian Ancic were drawn on Saturday to meet in the final of the meet in singles. Robredo and Ancic were seeded one and two in the ATP event, after the pull-out of injured Czech Republics world No. 10 Radek Stepanek. 

Also missing from the fray after entering the event is Chiles world No. 12 Fernando Gonzalez which helped Czech world No. 13 Thomas Berdych to be seeded. 

Three other big names whose preliminary entries had been received six weeks ago but who have since pulled out for various reasons are German world No. 23 Nicolas Kiefer, Frances Fabrice Sontoro and former top ten player Greg Rusedski of Britain. Rusedski will certainly be slapped a monetary penalty of around $1,000 for his late pull-out, said ATP supervisor Ed Hardisty after the draw. 

Robredo is drawn to meet fourth seed Dmitry Tursonov, a member of the Russian Davis Cup team currently playing in the semis against the US, in the semis. The Russian world No. 22 has Indias wild card recipient Akash Wagh as his first-round rival. 

The other two wild card Indian entrants, Rohan Bopanna and Karan Rastogi, have uphill struggles in store in the first round against eighth seeded South African Wesley Moodie, the world No. 73, and sixth seeded German world No. 66 Bjorn Phau, respectively.

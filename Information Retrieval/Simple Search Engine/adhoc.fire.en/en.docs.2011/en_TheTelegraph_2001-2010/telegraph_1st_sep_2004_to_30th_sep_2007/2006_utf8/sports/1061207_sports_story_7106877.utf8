 5th kabaddi gold for India

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: There is one gold medal that India never fails to win and this time, too, it was no exception. India duly won the kabaddi gold medal for the fifth successive time at the Aspire Hall here. In the final, India defeated their traditional rivals Pakistan 35-23 to take their gold No. 3. 

India added two more bronze to their kitty on Wednesday when shooter Vijay Kumar finished third in the 25m rapid fire and rowers came third in the mens lightweight double sculls. 

Vijay, incidentally, won the medal by default, thanks to an Asian Games rule in shooting. Vijay shot a score of 775.3 (577+198.3) to finish fourth, just 1.2 points behind the third place Chinese shooter, but he was awarded the bronze because the rule does not allow a country to win all three medals in a shooting event. 

Pemba Tamang finished 9th with a score of 574.

 One-match ban for Irish player 

Dubai: Irelands Niall Brien has been banned for one ICC Intercontinental Cup match after being found guilty of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct. 

The Ireland wicketkeeper, who plays first-class cricket in England for County side Kent, was also warned about his future conduct when the judgement was handed down. 

Brien was found guilty of a Level 2 offence during Irelands ICC Intercontinental Cup match against Scotland in Aberdeen last month, ICC said in a release on Sunday. 

Match Referee David Jukes found the player guilty of clause 2.8.

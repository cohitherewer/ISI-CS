 Chidi 

New Delhi: Sporting Clube de Goas Nigerian striker Chidi Edeh, who formed a deadly pair with compatriot Dudu in the National Football League this season, has decided to switch over to JCT Mills, Phagwara for the next season. 

Chidi, who was also hotly pursued by East Bengal in the transfer market, was in the capital on Sunday to sign the necessary papers in presence of JCT manager Sukhwinder Singh. 

JCT, according to Sukhwinder, has decided to release their Brazilian striker Marcos Pereira, who was not at his best in the just-concluded NFL. JCT, however, is retaining their Nigerian defender Julius, who enjoyed a good season.

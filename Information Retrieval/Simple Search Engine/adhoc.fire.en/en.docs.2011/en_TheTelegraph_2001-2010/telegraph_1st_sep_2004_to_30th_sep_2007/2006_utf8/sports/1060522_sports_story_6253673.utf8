 Hingis lifts first title after comeback

Rome: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis swept aside Russias Dinara Safina 6-2, 7-5 to win the Italian Open on Sunday, her first title since ending a three-year self-imposed exile from the professional circuit. 

The Swiss, who returned in December, had last won a tournament in Tokyo in February 2002. 

I never thought Id be here again, Hingis said after claiming her second title in the Italian capital. 

But they say never give up hope and keep fighting, and here I am. Its just great to be back on top of the game. 

Safina had beaten a series of higher-ranked players en route to the final, including world No. 2 Kim Clijsters, but her form deserted her as she sprayed shots long and wide. 

Hingis victory is expected to move her back into the worlds top 15 and establish her as a contender for the French Open, which starts next Sunday. 

 Robredo tops in Hamburg 

Meanwhile, Spains Tommy Robredo won his first Masters Series title on Sunday, defeating Czech Radek Stepanek 6-1, 6-3, 6-3 in a one-sided final in Hamburg. 

The 24-year-old sealed the win with a volley then tore off his shirt and flung it into the crowd. 

With Sundays win, Robredo regained the top 10 world ranking he briefly attained earlier this month, while Stepanek, 27, breaks into the top 10 for the first time in his career.

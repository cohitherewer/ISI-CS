 No confirmation from Sourav

 Super Six in Pak

 Karachi: Former Team India 

 captain Sourav Ganguly will feature in the first Asian Super 

 Sixes tournament in Pakistan next month, an organiser said 

 on Thursday.

 Four teams Pakistan, India, 

 Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have confirmed their participation 

 in the two-day event on September 15 and 16 at the National 

 Stadium in Karachi, coordinator Rashid Khan said. 

 [Till late on Thursday, though, 

 a confirmation could not be received from Sourav.] 

 The tournament is being held with 

 the permission of the Pakistan Cricket Board by former Test 

 captain and wicketkeeper, Moin Khan.

 Sourav, discarded by the Indian 

 selectors since playing in the Test series in Pakistan this 

 year, has been named in the list of Champions Trophy probables. 

 Rashid said the organisers were hoping for sell-out crowds 

 in the tournament.

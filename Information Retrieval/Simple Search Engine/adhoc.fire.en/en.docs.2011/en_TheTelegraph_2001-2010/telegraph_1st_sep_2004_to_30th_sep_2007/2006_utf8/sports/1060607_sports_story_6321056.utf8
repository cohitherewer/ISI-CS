Paris: Czech teenager Nicole Vaidisova followed up her upset win over world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo by dazzling another Grand Slam champion in the French Open quarter finals on Tuesday. 

This time the 17-year-old mesmerised Wimbledon title-holder Venus Williams 6-7, 6-1, 6-3 to confirm she is the emerging force of womens tennis. 

Belgian Kim Clijsters stopped Martina Hingis in her tracks while mens top seed Roger Federer and womens defending champion Justine Henin-Hardenne bounded into the last four. 

Clijsters beat a tired Hingis 7-6, 6-1 and will now face compatriot Henin-Hardenne, a rematch of the 2003 final in which Clijsters capitulated 6-0, 6-4. 

Vaidisovas win over the older Williams sister mirrored her shock fourth round victory over Australian Open champion Mauresmo when she also lost a tiebreak before dominating the next two sets. 

The German-born Czech turned 17 only in April and if she wins the title she will become the second youngest winner of the French Open behind Monica Seles, who was 16 when she won the clay court Grand Slam in 1990. 

Im so excited I could just scream now, gasped the teenager, who plays Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova for a place in the final. 

Im not even thinking about the match yet. Im still in my little la-la land. Ill figure out something tomorrow. 

A product of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida, Vaidisova describes Steffi Graf as her inspiration. Her best previous run at a Grand Slam was when reaching the US Open fourth round last year. 

Its great, twice in a row. I struggled a little bit with some parts today and still pulled it off. It definitely boosts your confidence a lot, she said. 

Former world No. 1 Hingis, who is back on tour after a three-year career break, was playing for a fifth consecutive day at Roland Garros which endured a rain-hit first week and she sagged noticeably in the second set. 

I was a little flat, said the Swiss. I was a little tired. I didnt have the energy going I had in the first three matches. I had a rough schedule the last three, four days. 

Clijsters also knocked Hingis out of the Australian Open quarter finals in January and once again her greater weight of shot counted for more than her opponents tactical nous. 

If she beats Henin-Hardenne on her 23rd birthday on Thursday, she will also reclaim the world No. 1 spot from Frances Mauresmo. 

Federer is now only two wins from becoming the third man in history to hold all four Grand Slam titles simultaneously after demolishing Croatian Mario Ancic 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. 

The Swiss treated the centre court crowd to some astounding tennis to set up a semi-final against either Argentine third seed David Nalbandian or Russian Nikolay Davydenko. 

Henin-Hardenne was too crafty for German Anna-Lena Groenefeld, winning 7-5, 6-2. Like Clijsters, she is yet to drop a set. 

Kuznetsova recovered from an atrocious start to beat fellow Russian Dinara Safina, the conqueror of Maria Sharapova. 

 Sania loses in doubles 

Sania Mirzas challenge came to an end with a straight-set loss in the womens doubles at Roland Garros. 

Sania, partnering Janette Husarova of Slovakia, went out to Eleni Daniilidou of Greece and Spaniard Anabel Medina Garrigues 0-6, 4-6 in the quarter finals. 

 Meanwhile, there was disappointment for Indian fans 

 in the junior section as well with Sanam Singh and Jeevan 

 Nedunchezhiyan losing their boys doubles first-round 

 match against 6-7 (7-2), 4-6 against Croatian pair Nikola 

 Mektic and Vedran Siljegovic

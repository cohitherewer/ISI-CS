 Delhi surrender to Joshi

 - RANJI ROUND-UP 

 Sunil Joshi took six wkts for Karnataka 

Bangalore: Delhi succumbed to the guile of spinners Sunil Joshi and Anil Kumble to concede a 25-run first innings lead to Karnataka on the third day of their Elite Group A match on Thursday. 

Joshi took six wickets for 73 runs and Kumble scalped three for 89 as the visitors, resuming from their relatively strong overnight position of 213 for two, slumped to 258 all out replying to Karnataka 283. 

At stumps, the hosts reached 196 for five wickets off 75 overs in their second innings, ahead by a total of 221 runs, with a days play remaining. 

In Agartala, riding on superb bowling by Vineet Jain, hosts Tripura registered an emphatic 130-run win against Himachal Pradesh in their Ranji Trophy Plate Group B match here on Thursday. 

Tripura secured four points from this outright win. 

Himachal, who resumed at their overnight score of 111 for six in the second innings, were bowled out for 156 with Jain taking seven wickets while giving away only 29 runs from his 17.2 overs. 

 In Visakhapatnam, the efforts of Andhra skipper Y. Venugopal Rao (78) and M. S. K. Prasad (72) were not enough to prevent Punjab from taking a first innings lead of 79 runs on the penultimate day of their Elite B Group match being played here on Thursday. 

 Right arm spinner Rajesh Sharma was the wrecker-in-chief by claiming five wickets of Andhra, who resumed at 79 for two in reply to Punjab score of 316, and folded up at 237. 

 The visitors were 98 for three at close.

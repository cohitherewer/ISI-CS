 EB look up to new Brazilian duo

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The Durand Cup, it seems, has become a testing ground for clubs to try out their foreign recruits. On Sunday, Mahindra United went home a happy lot as their new Portuguese recruit Filipe Azevedo passed the entrance test with distinction, scoring a brace against Air India. 

Come Monday, it will be the turn of two new Brazilians to don the red-and-gold jersey in their Durand Cup quarter-final league group II action against Dempo. 

At the East Bengal practice session Sunday morning, the focus was on Daniel Gil and Thiago Ferreira, with coach Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva keeping a close tab on the new recruits. 

Both of them will play on Monday, confirmed Pereira. They are experienced players and I am satisfied with their fitness, he added. Captain Alvito DCunha is yet to make an appearance. 

I have been told that Alvito is in Goa, the coach said. Its good if he comes, but will sit on the bench for the first match. 

The coach also said he was unhappy with the tight schedule of the tournament. To become champions, we will have to play five matches in seven days. Thats little too much, I think. 

East Bengal are awaiting the arrival of one more Brazilian, Christiano, in Delhi. The club officials said he could be tried out in Durand Cup once he gets clearance from the IFA back.

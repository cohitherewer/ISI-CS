 Hingis for Korea Open

Seoul: Former world No. 1 Martina Hingis will take part in the Korea Open from September 25 to October 1, the Korea Tennis Association (KTA) said on Friday. 

Russias Maria Kirilenko and Sania Mirza of India are also reported to have received invitations to the tournament. 

The Korea Open was won last year by Czech Nicole Vaidisova. 

After Sharapova took part in 2004, people (in Korea) really began to get interested in tennis, so we were looking for a good player, KTA official Lee Jin-soo said. (Reuters)

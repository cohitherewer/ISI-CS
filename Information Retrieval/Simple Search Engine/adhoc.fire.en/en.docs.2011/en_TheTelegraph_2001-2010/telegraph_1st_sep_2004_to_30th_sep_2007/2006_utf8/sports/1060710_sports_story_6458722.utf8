 Need a few days to understand all this

 Klinsmann in Berlin on Sunday

Stuttgart: Juergen Klinsmann has done more than merely silence his critics after taking Germany to a third place finish at the World Cup. He has turned those who criticised his methods and wanted him to quit just four months ago into ardent supporters who are now begging him to stay on. 

Im totally overwhelmed by all the compliments that are coming from so many different directions. I cant put it into words. It cant get any better than this. I need a few days to be able to understand all of this, the German coach said amid calls from across the country for him to stay on. 

So much has crashed down upon our heads, on the team and the coaches, said the 41-year-old. Wed always warned everyone that the World Cup would be an avalanche, but we didnt know it was going to be as massive an avalanche as this. 

Everywhere you look across Germany, in the towns and villages, the people are celebrating like never before. I need a few days. I cant really locate where I am right now, added Klinsmann when asked about his expiring contract with the national team. 

One-time critic Franz Beckenbauer again pleaded with him to continue on Saturday. The Kaiser said youd better keep going, Klinsmann said when asked what the man who led and later coached West Germany to World Cup wins said to him on the pitch after the third-place finish. 

I told him lets wait and see what happens, Klinsmannsaid, borrowing Beckenbauers favourite Schaun mer mal phrase and turning it against his mentor. 

But seriously, Im delighted that he holds our work in such high esteem. Those words came from his heart. For me as a young guy and young coach to get such a compliment like that from Franz Beckenbauer, its a special moment. (Reuters)

 PK in clinic after cerebral attack

 - Hes stable now: Doctor 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: P.K. Banerjee had to be hospitalised on Thursday morning after suffering a mild cerebral attack. 

The former India captain, a columnist for The Telegraph, was about to leave for his morning walk when he felt uneasy. 

He stayed at home. I called a doctor who advised we should hospitalise him, said daughter Paula. By 10.30 am, he was admitted to the ICCU of a private nursing home. 

According to Dr Manoj Shah, who is in the team of doctors looking after PK, a scan was done, revealing a small clot on the right side of the brain. 

His condition is stable, Dr Shah said in the evening. But since there has been a haemorrhage, we have to take all possible precautions. He will be kept under observation for 72 hours. 

The 70-year-old PK, who loves holding fort at any and every gathering and has anecdotes to match all occasions, is a busy man despite not being involved with coaching for the last few years. 

He has a very busy schedule he is not getting younger, so has to slow down, said younger brother Prasun Banerjee of the man, adjudged Indian Footballer of the 20th century. 

PK himself said the other day that life was getting hectic. They keep inviting me to all kinds of functions and insist I have to go. I dont like saying no because this is a manifestation of peoples love and recognition. But at times, it gets very tiring. 

Recipient of the Arjuna and Padmashri awards, PKs latest assignment was to supervise the dope testing procedure at the forthcoming AFC Youth (under-20) Championships, to be held simultaneously in Calcutta and Bangalore. But that, obviously, wont materialise now.

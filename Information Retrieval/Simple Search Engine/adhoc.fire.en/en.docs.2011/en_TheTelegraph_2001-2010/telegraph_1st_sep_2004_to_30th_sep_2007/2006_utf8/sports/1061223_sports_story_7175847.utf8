 PMs visit defers Classic day 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: RCTC stewards were forced to postpone Saturdays Classic, the Usha Stud Calcutta Oaks, to Tuesday (Boxing Day), thanks to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs proposed visit to the city on the day.

 The postponement followed the state governments (home departmentl) directive, vide a notification last Wednesday, to suspend all racing activities at the racecourse on Saturday. The restrictions imposed are in view of the security measures for the Prime Minister who would use the racecourse helipad on the day.

 Never in the past had RCTC faced such an inconvenience because of a visiting dignitary. Live racing and the inter-venue were conducted as schedule even during the visits of former President Giani Zail Singh and Prime minister Indira Gandhi when militancy in Punjab was at its height. On few occasions, security personnel did empty the stands, but only for an hour or so while the sport went on even as VIPs used the helipad. Saturdays restrictions are, therefore, uncalled for. (Note: Inter-venue betting on Bangalore races has also been cancelled).

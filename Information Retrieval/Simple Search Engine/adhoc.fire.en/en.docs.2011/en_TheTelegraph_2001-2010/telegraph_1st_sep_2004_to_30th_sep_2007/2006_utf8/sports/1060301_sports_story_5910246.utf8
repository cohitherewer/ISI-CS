The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jaffer a bit nervous and excited

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Nagpur: Opener Wasim Jaffer, who is making a comeback after almost four years, is both a bit nervous and a bit excited. 

Theres a bit of both... Perhaps, its inevitable, Jaffer told The Telegraph on Tuesday afternoon, shortly after Team India captain Rahul Dravid confirmed he would open with Virender Sehwag. 

Grinning, the Mumbaikar added: Of course, I should settle down by the time I take guard... Main normal cricket khelunga... 

The last of Jaffers seven Tests was in Trent Bridge (August 2002). He was in the squad for the recent tour of Pakistan, but the captain himself took the second openers slot in all three Tests. 

 Chopra in town 

Meanwhile, former India opener Akash Chopra (whose last appearance, ironically, was at the VCA Stadium 14 months ago) is in Nagpur to consult physio John Gloster. He has a right shoulder injury and cant throw over-arm. 

Ive brought all the scans and the other stuff... Ill probably meet trainer Greg King, too, he said.

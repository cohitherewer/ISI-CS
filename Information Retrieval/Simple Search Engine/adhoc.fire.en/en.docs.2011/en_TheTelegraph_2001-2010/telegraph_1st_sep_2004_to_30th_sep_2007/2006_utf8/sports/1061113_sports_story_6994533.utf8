 PCB contests BCCI claim over Cup final

Lahore: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Dr Nasim Ashraf on Sunday dismissed Indias claims that it would host the showpiece final of the 2011 World Cup. 

Ashraf refuted statements by the BCCI that the schedule for the World Cup matches and final had been finalised. 

I dont think the allotment of matches or the venue for the final is done as yet. We are holding a joint meeting in India on December 11 to discuss these issues, he told a news conference. 

[BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah reiterated that India would host the final. May be Dr Ashraf isnt well informed. This was settled by the bidding committee during one of its meetings in New Delhi, Shah told The Telegraph. 

[This is not a serious issue. We can always sort it out during our next meeting, he added.] 

The ICC in April awarded the hosting rights to Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. (Agencies)

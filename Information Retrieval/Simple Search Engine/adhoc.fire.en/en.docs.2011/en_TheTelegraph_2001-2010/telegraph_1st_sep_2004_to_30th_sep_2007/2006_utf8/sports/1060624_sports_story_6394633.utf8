The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dutch shatter Indian hopes 

 Azlan Shah Cup

 Kuala Lumpur: Indias 

 title hopes were dashed when they lost 0-1 to formidable 

 The Netherlands in the semi-finals of the Sultan Azlan Shah 

 hockey tournament on Friday.

 A 64th-minute penalty corner conversion 

 by Roderick Weushtof sealed the victory for the Dutch. Incidentally, 

 it was the winners first conversion in the tournament.

 The Dutch thus made their maiden 

 entry into the final of this tournament where they would 

 face Australia, who walloped New Zealand 7-1 in the other 

 semi-finals. 

 Grant Schubert (2), Luke Dorener 

 (2), Matt Naylor, Travis Brookes and Dean Butler scored 

 for Australia. Richard Petherick converted a 69th minute 

 penalty corner to provide some consolation to New Zealand.

 India paid dearly for their defensive 

 approach in contrast to the more positive Dutch who had 

 the better of exchanges. But the Indians did not feel the 

 sun on the backs and in the closing minutes, the deep defence 

 that had performed admirably for over an hour, succumbed 

 to pressure leading to the penalty corner that Weushtof 

 converted with a neat drag-flick.

 Meanwhile, India coach V. Baskaran 

 blamed an overcautious approach at the start and mistakes 

 in the last quarter for the defeat. (PTI)

 Anand still in 2nd spot

Wijk Aan Zee: World champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria hung on to his slender half-point lead after settling for a quick draw with Viswanathan Anand in the 12th and penultimate round of Corus Chess tournament here on Saturday. 

Topalov moved to 8.5 points after playing it safe against Anand who inched to 8 points and maintained his sole second position. 

Topalov will meet Peter Leko in the final round, while Anand has to tackle Boris Gelfand. 

Playing white against Anand, Topalov was surprised by the Indians choice of Arkhengelsk variation. Going for routine exchanges around the centre and on the queenside, Anand ensured he got a fine position in the middle game and the peace was signed after just 23 moves.(PTI)

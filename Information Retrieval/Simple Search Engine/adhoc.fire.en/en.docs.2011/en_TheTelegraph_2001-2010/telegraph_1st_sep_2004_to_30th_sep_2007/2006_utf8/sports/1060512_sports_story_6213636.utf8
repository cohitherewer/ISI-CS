 Northants in talks with Sourav

Calcutta: Northamptonshire are in talks with Sourav Ganguly to tie up the former India captain for part of the ongoing season. 

Mark Tack, CEO of Northamptonshire CCC, said: We are in talks with Ganguly and his agent. We are looking for a replacement for Chris Roger who has been called for Australia A duty. A final decision will be made in a weeks time. 

He added that the contract, if finalised, would be for five weeks starting end of June. 

Whatever the Northants official may say, its unlikely that Sourav himself will take a decision on whether to play County cricket before the squad for the Test series in the West Indies is announced on May 24. 

There is a possibility of me playing for Northamptonshire this season, but nothing has been finalised, Sourav said, adding that something may materialise soon.

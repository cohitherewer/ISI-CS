The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Strange game produces 3 Red Cards, an own goal

 In what was easily the most explosive 

 and eventful match of the 2006 World Cup finals, Italy were 

 forced to a 1-1 draw by the US in Kaiserslautern on Saturday 

 night. Uruguayan referee Jorge Larrionda hogged most of 

 the limelight in the group E game, flashing the red card 

 a record-equalling three times. 

The sequence of bizarre events began in the 27th minute when Cristian Zaccardo conceded an own goal ? a once-in-a-blue-moon mishap for any Italian side ? to neutralise Alberto Gilardinos strike. 

Just a minute later, the eviction drama started when Italian defender Daniele de Rossi was sent off for elbowing striker Brian McBride in the face (picture on left). 

Then it was the Americans turn to suffer as midfielder Pablo Mastroeni was ordered off the pitch (picture in the middle) for a sliding tackle on Andrea Pirlo, just before half-time. 

 Two minutes after the change of ends, American Eddie Pope had to go off (picture on right) following a second booking for a foul on Gilardino (his first infringement was also against Gilardino). 

The previous instances when there had been three dismissals in World Cup finals were in 1938 (Brazil vs Czechoslovakia), 1954 (Brazil vs Hungary) and 1998 (Denmark vs South Africa). 

 Few had given the US any chance against three-time champions Italy, especially after the Azzurris impressive display in their opener against Ghana. 

 Not only did Bruce Arenas team catch Marcelo 

 Lippis side by surprise, they have also thrown the 

 group wide open with all four teams (Czech Republic and 

 Ghana being the others) having a chance to qualify for Round 

 II.

 in Singapore Open, is sixth. Jyoti Randhawa (25th) and Amandeep

 their worst rounds of the week at the $3 million Southern 

 Farm Bureau Classic Golf tournament. Chopra, tied third 

 overnight shot a three-over 74, ended at seven-under 281

 his card continued as he played a five-over 76 in a roller-coaster

 Benaud flays ICC 

 Sydney: Richie Benaud says last weeks International Cricket Council (ICC) hearing into ball tampering arising from last months forfeited fourth Test between England and Pakistan has hurt world cricket. The former Australian captain said the ICC hearing was crass and unbecoming and he criticised Pakistans decision to refuse to re-enter the field instead of accepting the umpires ruling at The Oval. 

 Why didnt he get a Test ban? Benaud 

 told a paper Monday. His proven offence was committed 

 in a Test. Instead, he got the minimum one-day ban 

 of four matches when the minimum Test ban was 10 days of 

 cricket.

 Bradman losing appeal 

 Sydney: The Bradman Museum, established to honour Australias greatest cricketer Don Bradman, is facing dwindling visitor numbers and may have to be reinvented for a generation more familiar with Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting, reports said. Situated in Bowral, an hours drive south-west of Sydney where Bradman lived his early years, the museum is experiencing a decline in income since the 2001 death of Bradman, aged 92. 

 Business has been difficult since Sir Donald 

 died, Richard Mulvaney, the museums founding 

 director, told a paper. In its heyday, in the late 1990s, 

 85,000 cricket lovers visited the museum every year, but 

 that has fallen to about 40,000 per year.

 Mankad Baroda coach 

 Vadodara: Ashok Mankad has been appointed 

 as the new coach of the Baroda Ranji team, Baroda Cricket 

 Association secretary Kiran More said. The post fell vacant

 over to Madhya Pradesh as coach.

 Tough for Flintoff: Akram 

 Karachi: Andrew Flintoff faces a difficult 

 time as England captain in next months Ashes in Australia, 

 his long-time friend and former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram 

 said. The choice of Flintoff as captain is good but 

 I fear he will be leading a losing team in the forthcoming 

 Ashes. The Australians are going to crush England and only 

 an extraordinary performance can avert the outcome, 

 Akram said.

 BCCI bid 

 Mumbai: The Board of Control for Cricket in 

 India (BCCI) has decided to bid for the rights of all the

 stadium will get financial support of Rs 25 crore.

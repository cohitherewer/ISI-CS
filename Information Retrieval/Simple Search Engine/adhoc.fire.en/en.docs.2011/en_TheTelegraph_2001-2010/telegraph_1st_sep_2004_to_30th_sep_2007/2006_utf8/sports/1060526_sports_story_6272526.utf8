 Chappell has a mind-block on Sourav: Patel

A STAFF REPORTER

 Sourav Ganguly

Calcutta: According to former India batsman Brijesh Patel, Sourav Ganguly should have been included in the West Indies-bound squad for the four-Test series, starting from June 2. 

Given the absence of Sachin Tendulkar owing to injury, the most successful Indian captains experience would have come in handy in the Caribbean, reasoned the 53-year-old. 

The team would only have benefited from his experience, Patel, who is also the Karnataka State Cricket Association secretary, said here on Thursday. 

Surely, Sourav has got a raw deal. A player of his stature deserves proper chances and an honourable exit, Patel maintained. 

He also felt Team India coach Greg Chappell had a mind-block on Sourav. Chappell is doing a decent job, except the issue over Sourav. He seems to have a mind-block over Sourav, he said. 

Patel also came down heavily on the current dispensation of the BCCI, charging them with launching a witch-hunt against former president Jagmohan Dalmiya. 

What kind of transparency they are talking of? Had they been transparent, they would have made public the facts pertaining to the court cases against Mr Dalmiya, he said. 

Patel, a Dalmiya camp loyalist, also felt the present BCCI administration did precious little in improving the National Cricket Academy. Patel was the NCA director, but was removed from the post when the Sharad Pawar camp came into power.

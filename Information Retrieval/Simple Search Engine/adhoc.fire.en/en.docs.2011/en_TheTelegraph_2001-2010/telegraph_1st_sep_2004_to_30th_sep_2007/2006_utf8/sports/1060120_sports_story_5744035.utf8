The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I focus on batsmen, not pitches: Shoaib

 - Track may have something more than Gaddafi: Woolmer 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Faisalabad: Be it most Indians or Pakistanis, the priority on reaching the Iqbal Stadium was to head for the wicket prepared for the second Test, which begins on Saturday. 

As Team India had the morning practice, the visitors thinktank had the first good look. The hosts came after lunch, with captain Inzamam-ul Haq and coach Bob Woolmer getting into the scrutinising act straightaway. Moments later, vice-captain Younis Khan joined them. 

I reckon it will have something more (than the Gaddafi)... It does seem hard, but is probably rather soft underneath, remarked Woolmer. Counterpart Greg Chappell said it was too early to say anything conclusively. 

Chappell, of course, made 235 in the only Test he played here ? back in 1979-80, when he was captain. The match ended in a draw, but Australia went home 0-1 losers in the three-Test series. 

Senior pro Anil Kumble didnt offer a comment, but he saw the wicket from different angles (with and without sunglasses) and indulged in a bit of shadow-batting. Perhaps, he was indicating it would be better being a batsman in Faisalabad. 

Beginning with the Iqbal Stadiums debut Test (versus India, 1978-79), batsmen have invariably hit the jackpot. That 12 of the 23 matches have ended in draws is rather revealing. 

Just a few didnt bother giving the wicket a close look, one being Shoaib Akhtar. In a chat with The Telegraph, he explained: Main wicket dekhna pasand nahin karta... I bowl on whats offered... Its the batsmen I focus on... 

Asked whether his left ankle (which takes a beating each time he lands) was fine, Shoaib replied: Absolutely... Theres no problem... Test No. 1 was disappointing, but he appears ready to fire on all cylinders.

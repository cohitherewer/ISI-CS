 Jeev five shots behind leader

 Japan Golf

 Ibaraki: Jeev Milkha Singh 

 set himself up for another top-10 finish with a spectacular 

 round of four-under 67 that took him 18 places up to tied 

 sixth after three rounds in the 120million Acom International 

 at the Ishioka Golf Club on Saturday.

 For the second successive day, 

 Jeev, with a total of seven-under 206, made the biggest 

 leap and is now in line for his 13th top-10 finish of the 

 year, of which seven have come in Japan.

 Jeev is now five strokes behind 

 the leader, Mamo Osanai, who carded a three-over 74. Osanai, 

 leader by five shots overnight saw his lead cut to just 

 two, as Ryuichi Oda (65) moved to second spot, with a nine-under 

 204, alongside Thai Prayad Marksaeng (70).

 Choudhary thrashes minister

SHASHANK SHEKHAR AND JAYESH THAKER

 Amitabh Choudhary won by 101 votes 

Bokaro: David had the last laugh against Goliath. 

Amitabh Choudhary, the stakes loaded against him in the battle for the presidents post of Jharkhand State Cricket Association, dealt a knockout blow to home minister Sudesh Mahto, defeating him by a huge margin of 101 votes in the biennial elections held in Bokaro on Sunday. 

While Choudhary polled 400 votes, the minister could muster only 299. Seventy three per cent polling was recorded with 701 of the associations 955 voters casting the ballot. Two votes were declared invalid. 

Till the morning, the odds were stacked against Choudhary, the incumbent president and the inspector-general of police (human rights). The minister had pressed the official machinery into action and was also believed to have the backing of Tata Steel. 

Tata Steels deputy managing director, A.N. Singh, flew in to Bokaro in a company plane accompanied by Telcon managing director Ranaveer Sinha and senior Jusco officer U.K. Srivastava. Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) DIG Alok Raj, liquor baron Badal Jaiswal and former India wicketkeeper Saba Karim, all known to be supporters of Mahto, reached the venue well before 11 am to ensure they got to cast their votes. 

What swung the elections in Choudharys favour was the votebank of 420 new life members from the districts, inducted last year. A sizeable chunk of these life members queued up at the polling station ? the community centre at Sector 2 ? in the morning and, braving the scorching heat, waited patiently for their turn.

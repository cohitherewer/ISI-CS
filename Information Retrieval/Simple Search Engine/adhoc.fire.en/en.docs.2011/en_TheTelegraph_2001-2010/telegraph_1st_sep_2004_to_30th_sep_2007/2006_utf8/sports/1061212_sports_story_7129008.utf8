 NZ rally behind McCullum

Christchurch: The New Zealand cricket team rallied behind wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum Monday, defending him from ongoing criticism over the dismissal of Sri Lankas Muttiah Muralidharan in their first Test. 

McCullum has been pilloried in the media for running out Murali when the careless tailender left his crease while the ball was in play to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara on scoring a century. The dismissal sparked an ethical debate, with the Sri Lankans and several commentators saying it breached the spirit of the game. 

McCullum said he was shocked by the widespread adverse reaction to what was a legitimate dismissal that ended Sri Lankas second innings and left New Zealand a 119-run target to win which they achieved for the loss of five wickets. 

I didnt expect the repercussions from it, McCullum said. I never thought it the wrong thing to do, the rules are there and you cant reward stupidity, McCullum said.

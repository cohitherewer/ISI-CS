 Anju seventh

New Delhi: Anju Bobby Georges disappointing season continued as the world No. 4 finished a lowly seventh at the Qatar IAAF Super Tour in Doha. 

Anju, who was the top ranked long jumper in the event, could manage only 6.43m and failed to make the most of the absence of the top three athletes ? Tatyana Kotova, Tianna Madison and Grace Upshaw, who gave a skip to the meet. 

The gold medal went to world No. 5 Oksana Udmurtova of Russia who created a new meet record with a mammoth jump of 7.02m, the seasons best so far. 

The silver was claimed by her compatriot Tatyana Lebedeva, who set the meet record here last year, by leaping 6.97m. 

Comonwealth Games gold medallist Australian Bronwyn Thompson was way behind in third place with 6.76m. (PTI)

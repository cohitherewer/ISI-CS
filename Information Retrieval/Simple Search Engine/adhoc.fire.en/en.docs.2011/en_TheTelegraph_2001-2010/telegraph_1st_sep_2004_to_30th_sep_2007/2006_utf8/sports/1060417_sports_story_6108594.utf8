 Monkey is off my back: Jeev

Beijing: Jeev Milkha Singh, Indias first big hero on the Asian PGA Tour, came to Beijing as an amateur in 1990 when he represented India at the Asian Games. Sixteen years later, the Chinese capital seemed to have infused a fresh lease of life into a career that has been very meaningful for Indian golf yet without a win for the last seven years. 

In an interview soon after the victory, Jeev spoke of the long wait and the way ahead. 

Following are excerpts 

Q Its been a long seven years and now youre here with a big trophy... 

A I just cant explain this feeling. Its like a dream come true. Ive always tried hard to win and today, I just went in there with reverse psychology thinking that if it doesnt happen, never mind. I just wanted to give it my best shot. And it worked out perfectly for me. 

Im really excited and happy the way it worked out. The seven-year-itch is over and the monkey is off my back. 

What was the key to your success here? 

I focussed really well today. My composure was good too. I think two putts coming into the last two holes made a lot of difference. I made a birdie on the 14th and a good putt for par on 15th. Coming into the 18th, I saw Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano was 10-under and had bogeyed the 18th. I was on the left side of the fairway in the rough and decided that I would not try to be a hero and go for the flag, and, instead play safe. If I make a par, good, but if I made bogey, Id still win the tournament. 

Did the recent losses (he finished second five times since 1999) play in your mind before the day started? 

It did play on my mind. I think I used to put more pressure on myself playing in the last round to try and get the job done. Ive let so many tournaments go and I just said if its another one, let it be. If I play well, itll be a bonus. If I dont its one of those weeks and Im going to keep trying. 

After your wrist injury (in 2000), how gratifying is this win? 

Its fantastic. When I was injured, I didnt know if I was going to come back in the sport. When I came back I wasnt thinking the same way. I was struggling, I was putting pressure on myself and getting down. 

I started working hard and the wrist became better and things started looking up for me. Ive just won and its one of the best feelings. 

Do you think you will now be a hero in India, like your father (Milkha Singh)? 

I hope Ill be a hero in India, but I think my dad is a bigger hero still! 

Your father wanted you to be an athlete and when you wanted to play golf, he wanted you to be the best... 

Thats right. Hes been a true sportsman and hes been a big support in my life. Hes the man who speaks the way he does and he tells you straight up. He told me if you want to take up the sport, you might as well give your best to be the best, otherwise do something else. He would be proud of me today but Im sure hed expect more from me! 

Can golf match crickets popularity in India? 

I think so, but itll take a few years. Cricket is a religion in our country. Golf is our number two sport. Weve got some young kids coming up and weve got Arjun Atwal and Jyoti Randhawa and have Shiv Kapur and Rahil Gangjee who have great potential. 

If we keep performing well, golf will become bigger in our country. I dont think itll be as big as cricket but if it gets closer, well be happy. 

How well do you know Vijai Singh? 

Yes I know him? Ive played a few practice rounds with him on the European Tour and Ive always taken his advice about practising. 

But I cant keep up with him as he practises a lot more than I do.

 Bagan jolt EB to lift title

 The jubilant under-15 Mohun Bagan players with chief guest P.K. Banerjee after beating East Bengal in the Manchester United Premier Cup final on Sunday 

Calcutta: Buoyed by the seniors great show against Salgaocar at the Salt lake Stadium, Mohun Bagan colts pipped arch-rivals East Bengal 6-5 via the sudden death to win the India leg of the Manchester United Premier Cup for under-15 football meet at the same pitch on Sunday. 

By virtue of this win in the sub-junior stage, the Green-and-maroon brigade earned a ticket to Bangkok where they will play the winner of South Asian Round on May 22. 

The match turned out to be a miniature derby. East Bengal started the proceedings well and led the first session, guided by a fifth minute strike from Avijit Mondal. 

Though the time format was curtailed to 20 minutes for each session, the sub-juniors were given the full extent of the pitch to play. 

The early lead opened up more opportunities as Avijit got his second chance in the 13th minute off a corner. But his acrobatic volley missed the target by a whisker. 

Mohun Bagan took over the proceedings after the breather just as East Bengal players seemed to relax a bit. 

The equaliser resulted off a fine move in the 37th minute that Sanjay Boro finished with an immaculate header. 

With the extra-time taken off the format, the tie-breakers were enforced straight away. The scoreline remained tied (4-4) yet again as both sides saw one of their attempts saved. 

The decision came in the sudden-death when East Bengals Lalmuanpuia saw his shot blocked by Bagan custodian Mithun Saha after Suman Bose put latter ahead in the first attempt after the tie-breakers.

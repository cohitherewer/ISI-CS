 German fans get picture first

London: German football fans are already celebrating a victory over their English rivals before a ball has even been kicked in the World Cup. While supporters in Germany, Austria and Italy will be able to watch matches live on their mobile phones, English fans will not. 

All that is being offered by British networks is a highlights package lasting a few minutes which can be downloaded within an hour of the final whistle of each England game. 

Mobile phone television has been touted as the next big thing in entertainment. It had been assumed that the World Cup finals in Germany in June and July would be a showcase for the technology. 

But according to T-Mobile, which bought the rights to the finals for mobile phones, there is little demand in Britain for live games on mobile phones. 

The serious fans are not going to miss the games themselves and they will want to watch the live matches on a large TV screen, a spokesman said. 

The highlights package will cost ?5 a month and other mobile phone operators have more limited World Cup packages of score updates, photographs and match reports.

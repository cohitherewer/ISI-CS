 Paes happy with scoreline

 - Rohan did not lose match, Aisam took it away 

Mumbai: Indian Davis Cup captain Leander Paes expressed happiness after the opening singles of the Asia-Oceania Zone I play-off tie against Pakistan at the end of which the two teams are tied 1-1. 

Considering that we were 0-1 down and Prakash (Amritraj) was trailing in the opening set against Aqeel Khan in the second singles, I can say I am happy, said Paes at the end of the first day of the rubber on Friday. 

I was worried when we were 0-1 down. But Prakash handled himself well after getting into a hole , Paes said. 

I was not happy with the way Prakash played today. He did not know what to do against Aqeel, whom he was playing for the first time on grass, and was a bit tentative. 

But when he was one break and two breaks down in the first two sets, he showed whos the better player, the veteran player said. 

Prakash was not at his best. Theres a lot of pressure going in when you are 0-1 down against a player who has nothing to lose. But Aqeel too did not know what to do when he was up in the first two sets. And I respect Prakash for the way he fought, Paes said. 

Though Bopanna lost in three straight sets to Qureshi, Paes said that the India number two did not lose the match, but his more experienced rival raised his game by a notch to take it away from Bopanna. 

Aisams experience helped. Rohan did not lose the match, but Aisam took it away. At 2-4 down in the first set tiebreaker he proved himself, said Paes. 

Pakistans non-playing captain Rashid Malik said he would have been happier if Aqeel had won the first two sets against Prakash which would have then given them a huge advantage. 

Qureshi said he never expected to win in straight sets over Bopanna. I never thought I would win in three sets, but after having won the first two, I was confident of taking the third. Hes a player who goes for the lines, he said. 

Malik talked about some line calls that seemed to have gone against them. Line calls at crucial stages do matter. But we cant do anything about it, was the cautious way he put it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Right decision, says Houghton

 - Past and present coaches in india on lippis startling move 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; A STAFF REPORTER

 Marcello Lippis resignation as Italy coach evoked 

 mixed reactions from the Indian football fraternity. The 

 following are excerpts of what the coaches, past and present, 

 had to say:

 MAURICE AFONSO (assistant 

 national coach): It is quite a surprising decision. Maybe 

 he has got an offer from one of the bigger clubs in Italy, 

 Spain or England. It is also possible that he wanted to 

 stay away from the match-fixing controversy. He is simply 

 a great coach. After all, no one expected Italy to reach 

 the final, leave alone winning the Cup. Lippi must have 

 injected a lot of confidence into his boys.

 Rating: 9/10 

 P.K. BANERJEE (former India 

 coach): Its difficult to comment on the decision because 

 it must have been a very personal one. But he has done a 

 great job and got his due. He shouldnt have any regrets. 

 He was eager to prove himself and went about his task confidently 

 and silently. A man of few words, he didnt have to 

 be burdened with constant media glare. That he achieved 

 the ultimate result proved his genius. He brought speed 

 and attacking flair to the side. You have to give all the 

 credit to Lippi. 

Rating: 8/10 

 BISWAJIT BHATTACHARJEE (Mohun 

 Bagan coach): I think hes going out at the right time. 

 Moving out when at the top is the ideal way to protect ones 

 dignity. Hes already 58 and must have thought it was 

 high time to bid goodbye. Its his decision and must 

 have been a well thought-out one. The way he transformed 

 this Italian side into a winning combination speaks volumes 

 of his strategical prowess. The Italians were not impressive 

 at the start. No one showed much faith. But they proved 

 the pundits wrong with their attacking display and improved 

 with every game. 

Rating: I dont think Im qualified enough to rate Lippi 

 ARMANDO COLACO (Dempo coach): 

 Lippis decision to quit was wrong. He is the coach 

 of a winning side and a winner should always continue. Perhaps 

 he wanted to stay away from the controversy that has engulfed 

 Italian football for the past few months. All that is said 

 about Lippis defensive and attacking style of play 

 is wrong. He is a simple coach who tells his players to 

 believe in themselves. Thats the way he motivates 

 his players. 

Rating: 10/10 

 BOB HOUGHTON (national 

 coach): It was definitely the right time to resign. It is 

 pointless to continue after winning the World Cup because 

 the coach is not left with any other target. As a coach, 

 I like his style. He is sensible and knows his job. He knew 

 the teams requirements and acted accordingly. He is 

 technically strong. He handled the team well and helped 

 them realise the ultimate dream. 

Rating: 9/10 

 SAVIO MEDEIRA (assistant 

 national coach and Salgaocar coach): It is difficult to 

 say whether it was a good or a bad decision. He must have 

 had his own reasons for this decision. Perhaps he wanted 

 to be remembered as the coach who brought the World Cup 

 back to Italy after 24 years. As a coach he is tactically 

 very strong. He has proved that Italy can be world beaters. 

 The best thing is that in winning the Cup, Lippi has not 

 compromised with the entertainment part of the game. His 

 style was highly interesting, the team being both defensive 

 and attacking. 

Rating: 9/10 

 HENRY MENEZES (Mahindra 

 United manager and former India goalkeeper): What a brilliant 

 way to go out. However, it is probably wrong to say that 

 he took this decision because he wanted quit while on top. 

 Lippi is a man who loves challenges. Now he will look out 

 for a different adventure. It is a great loss for Italian 

 football. All I can say is that it is a job well done. As 

 a coach, he showed a tremendous sense of responsibility. 

 A disciplinarian, his policy to blend defensive tactics 

 with attacking style paid dividends. He has given a new 

 dimension to coaching. 

Rating: 9/10 

 ALOKE MUKHERJEE (former 

 India assistant coach): I think he has got a lucrative offer 

 from a club or a national side which has forced him to leave 

 the Italy job. Even Scolari had quit as coach after Brazil 

 emerged champions in 2002. Lippi must be a happy and satisfied 

 man after almost singlehandedly guiding Italy to the title. 

 Italy wouldnt have been champions had Lippi not transformed 

 this ordinary bunch of players into an unbeatable outfit. 

 He had the charisma as well as tactical and mental awareness 

 to bring about this turnaround. Lippi has to share the bulk 

 of the credit. 

Rating: 9/10 

 SYED NAYEEMUDDIN (former 

 India coach): Lippis record speaks for himself ? five 

 Serie A titles, besides the Champions League and the World 

 Cup. The way he transformed the Italian squad into a winning 

 combination was amazing. He brought an attacking flair into 

 the team and made the players believe that defence was as 

 important as offence. Players were given no fixed roles 

 and they proved to be as efficient in attack as in defence. 

 He should have stayed on. No doubt, Italy will miss him. 

Rating: 10/10 

 DERRICK PEREIRA (Mahindra 

 United coach): A shocking decision. Certainly not a good 

 thing for Italian football. Under Lippi, Italy were going 

 in the right direction. As a coach, Lippi has shown his 

 class. His tactics worked well. Each player gave his best 

 under him. If his defensive tactics were good, his sharpness 

 in counterattacks was terrific. 

Rating: 8/10 

 HARISH RAO (former Mahindra 

 United and Maharashtra coach): Lippi has taken a decision 

 too early. He should have waited. But then, there are people 

 who love to go out while at the top. Lippi is a good coach. 

 I specially liked his handling of a star like Totti. Lippi 

 played him, dropped him and then brought him back again 

 at a crucial juncture. He is so cool. When everyone else 

 rushed to the ground after the victory, he turned to pick 

 up his jacket first. 

Rating: 8/10 

 SUKHWINDER SINGH (former 

 national coach): A correct decision on Lippis part. 

 It is always better to go when on top. As a coach, he has 

 done a great job. He did not have too many stars in the 

 team. The few he had were not in good form. He made all 

 these players into top stars. Italy scored 12 goals in the 

 World Cup and 10 different players scored the goals. Lippi 

 showed that the victory was a result of team game. 

Rating: 8/10 

 PARMINDER SINGH (JCT coach): 

 Lippi should not have resigned at this juncture. After all, 

 he is the coach of the winning team and there was no pressure 

 on him. As coach, his capabilities are beyond question. 

 I didnt find much weak points in his coaching. I liked 

 his style of counter-attacks and defensive organisation. 

 He also kept the team united. 

Rating: 9/10

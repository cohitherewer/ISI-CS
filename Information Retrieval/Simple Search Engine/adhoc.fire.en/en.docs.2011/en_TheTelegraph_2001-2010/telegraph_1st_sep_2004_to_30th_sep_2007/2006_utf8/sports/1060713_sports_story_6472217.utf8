 London: Argentine Mariano Puerta?s record eight-year ban following a positive dope test has been reduced to two years on appeal, CAS said on Wednesday. The start of the ban is dated to June 5, 2005, the date of the French Open final which Puerta lost to Spain?s Rafael Nadal. A urine sample was taken on that day which later tested positive for the banned stimulant etilefrine. ?The appeal filed by Mr Mariano Puerta is partially upheld,? the Lausanne-based CAS said in a statement. His taking of the drug was ?non-deliberate, he was unware of it and it involved ?no significant fault or negligence?,? CAS said.

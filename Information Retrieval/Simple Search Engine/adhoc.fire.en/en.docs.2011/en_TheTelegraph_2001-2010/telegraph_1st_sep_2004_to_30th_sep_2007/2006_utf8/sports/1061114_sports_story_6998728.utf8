 - WTA/ATP Rankings 

 Sania Mirza 

New Delhi: Sania Mirza has moved up three places to end what has been a below-par year for her at No. 66, according to the WTA Tour rankings list released on Monday. 

Sania, who had begun the year at a career-best 31, was not able to build on that. Her rating points dropped to 382, way below her last years count. 

In doubles, she finished a career-best 24 with 1070 points. 

Among other Indians, US-based Shikha Uberoi finished 206th, followed by Ankita Bhambri (42.50) at 418. 

Despite a niggling calf strain, Justine Henin-Hardenne beat the in-form Maria Sharapova in the semi-finals of the WTA Championships in Madrid to secure the year-end No. 1 spot and then defeated defending champion Amelie Mauresmo on Sunday to win the season-ender for the first time.

 Fransa held by Salgaocar

Panaji: Salgaocar came from behind to hold Fransa Pax to a 1-1 draw in the ONGC Cup for the 10th National Football League match at Duler Ground, Mapusa, here on Wednesday. 

After the teams failed to break the deadlock in the first half, Saikhon Singh drew the first blood for Fransa in the 61st minute with a left-footer from outside the box off a Godwin Franco pass. 

Salgaocar, who had better scoring chances in the first half, were denied on several occasions by Fransa keeper Virender Singh who made some brilliant saves. 

However, Salgaocar found the equaliser in the 69th minute when Samson Singh tapped the ball in from close after Fabio Passos did the spadework.

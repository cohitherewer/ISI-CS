The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Angola must score to harbour qualifying hopes

 - Iran Determined to give it their best shot

 Angolan goalkeeper Joao Ricardo takes a fall during training in Celle on Monday 

Berlin: Angola must end their goal drought against already eliminated Iran on Wednesday to have any chance of qualifying from Group D and will hope former colonial masters Portugal help them out by beating Mexico handsomely. 

Coach Luis Oliveira Goncalves has started the first two games using a solid 4-5-1 formation, with captain Akwa as a lone striker, but with goals at a premium he may opt to beef up the attack with Benfica frontman Mantorras. 

Angola have to score goals so naturally we have to play with a more offensive formation, assistant coach Alvaro de Almeida Mabi said on Monday. 

We are also playing against very strong opponents who dont want to leave the tournament with three defeats. 

Portugal have already qualified for the second round and will be joined by Mexico unless the Mexicans lose to the Portuguese and Angola beat Iran. Even then goal difference would decide who finishes second and play the Group C winners. 

Playing at their first World Cup, the Angolans have shown there is more to their country than war and strife and surprised everyone including themselves by keeping their qualifying hopes alive with Fridays gutsy 0-0 draw against Mexico. 

We are sure (the Mexico) game will give a better image of our country and we are putting in a very strong effort also for Africa, said goalkeeper Joao Ricardo, whose acrobatic display against the Mexicans earned him the Man of the Match award. 

Despite their early exit, Irans players have said they want to put in a strong performance in their final game to help save face and add to their only World Cup finals victory to date, a 2-1 win over the United States in France in 1998. 

Obviously, its a matter of honour and pride for us now and well give it our best shot in our last game and bid the tournament a worthy farewell, said midfielder Ferydoon Zandi. 

Wed like to finish third in the group, but were well aware Angola will provide tough opposition.

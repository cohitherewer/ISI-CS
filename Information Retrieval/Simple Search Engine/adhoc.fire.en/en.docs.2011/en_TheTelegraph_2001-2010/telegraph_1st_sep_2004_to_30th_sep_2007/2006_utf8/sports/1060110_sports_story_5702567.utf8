 Martyn guides Aussies to win

Melbourne: Damien Martyn smashed 96 off 56 balls to guide Australia to a 95-run victory over South Africa in the first full international Twenty20 game in Australia on Monday. 

Martyn hit five sixes and seven fours. Andrew Symonds chalked up 54 not out off 26 balls in Australias 209 for three off their 20 overs. 

Nathan Bracken took two wickets in South Africas third over ? and could have had a third had Martyn not dropped Graeme Smith ? to ensure they were always behind the run rate and they were bowled out for 114 in 18.3 overs. Smith (22), Mark Boucher (29) and Shaun Pollock (24) all got starts but were unable to capitalise. 

Symonds and Martyn had put on 84 runs in 7.5 overs for Australias third wicket before Monde Zondeki had Martyn caught by Herschelle Gibbs with the score at 187 for three on the first ball of the final over. 

Zondeki then conceded a wide and Symonds smashed 20 runs off the remaining five balls to reach his half century. (Reuters)

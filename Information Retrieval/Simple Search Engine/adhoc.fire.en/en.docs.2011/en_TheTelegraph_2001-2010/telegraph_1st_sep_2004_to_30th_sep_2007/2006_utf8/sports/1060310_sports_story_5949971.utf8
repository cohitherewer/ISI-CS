 Title for North Zone

Jaipur: North Zone clinched the Deodhar Trophy, edging out East by 52 runs in a rain-truncated match here on Thursday. 

North won via the VJD method after bad light forced the tie to be called off midway through Easts innings. The champions were further aided by Souths thrilling two-run win over West. 

East, out of the reckoning having lost the first three matches, were 146 for six in 30.4 overs when play was called off. Sourav Ganguly was dismissed for a first-ball duck.

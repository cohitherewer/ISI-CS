 WICB: Our vote was not on sale

 Port-of-Spain: The West Indies Cricket Board has come out in the open for the first time against allegations that it sold its vote to the Asian countries to help them win the rights to host 2011 World Cup. Ken Gordon, president of WICB, said the region acted in its best interests in throwing its support behind the joint bid by Asian countries, which included India, at an ICC meeting in Dubai in April. 

[The Telegraph had first reported that the WICB had supported Asias intent to host the Cup after receiving a written undertaking that they would help generate much-needed revenue by scheduling fundraisers in North America.] 

We live in the real world and we must understand that when people want to achieve an objective, they try to get support for that objective. Clearly, the India board wanted to have support for their objective and we did speak. Gordon said. (PTI)

 Clockworks expanding odds remain a mystery 

 STAR RACER

 Clockwork was expected to be at par in the betting with Wizard Of Oz but she went to the start as a 7-2 chance last Wednesday. Having opened as a joint-favourite at evens with the Wizard, the expanding odds of the Vijay Singh-trained filly still remained a mystery. Nevertheless, Clockwork won the 1,800m Mandolin Cup to the delight of her supporters after building up a sizeable lead from the halfway mark.

 The Steinbeck-Alarming daughter did get a fright from the topweighted Adderly, who was also in the betting, but her early lead stood her in good stead. Wizard Of Oz, too, was in contention and, in fact, he was only three lengths behind the winner nearing the distance post but the horse went backwards from that point. The Daniel David-ward may have felt, albeit late, the impact of his fall during the paddock parade. The horse was seen badly panting after the race.

 Legal Lady was the only one who spoiled punters party in an afternoon, which was otherwise ruled by the favourites. The John Stephens-trainee, though fully stretched, produced the vital extra in her last stride to account for Nose Nothing the convincing winner of the previous outing, who led from the start till beaten.

 Vijays Andrology was a treat to watch in the 1,200m Jeweller Plate. The Razeen-Adored son was a quarter-money hot-favourite and won the way he liked. Vijays another favourite, Asterisk, also returned a facile winner of the 1,400m Citi Limits Handicap, though his odds expanded from 6-10 to 2-1. The Razeen-Regal Grace son being a suspect bleeder, and it being the concluding event, bookmakers were perhaps keen on taking their last chance. Although Daniels Indigo also received a good support in the betting, the horse failed to do anything worthwhile in the race.

 Roofer was a medium of big gamble in the 1,400m Arcade Handicap. Backed down from 7-4 from evens, the six-year-old was ridden with a good judgment by apprentice Amandeep Singh who had the Daniel-trainee settled off the pace. 

 Genesis presented the visiting Delhi trainer, Shafiq Khan, with his fourth winner of the season. The Tirol-mare, however, met with a stiff resistance from Farley Rodrigues Spectacular Star in the last furlong of the 1,000m Sweet Senorita Handicap.

 The victory did not come easy either for Errol Bhungards Traditional Stride. The 6-10 favourite was in fourth berth, close behind the leader, Satluj, but made a heavy weather of her victory, leaving Amandeep to fire on all cylinders in the end. Vancouver walked onto the scene late to occupy the third slot only a length behind the fighting duo.

 Sania-Marta in Round II

New Delhi: Sania Mirza and Marta Domachowska of Poland advanced to the second round with a comfortable victory over Natalie Grandin and Milagros Sequera in the doubles event at the $175,000 WTA Tour tennis event in Cincinnati. 

According to information received here, second seeds Sania and Domachowska defeated Grandin of South Africa and Venuezuelan Sequera 6-4, 6-3 in the opening round on Monday. 

The Indo-Polish pair will take on Varvara Lepchenko of Uzbekistan and Chinas Meng Yuan in the second round. 

Shikha Uberoi, the other Indian in the fray, is paired with Canadas Maureen Drake and the duo face top seeds Maria Elena Camerin of Italy and Gisela Dulko of Argentina in the first round. 

Meanwhile, defending champion Patty Schnyder rallied from 1-4 down in the final set and saved a match point to beat Lilia Osterloh of the United States 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-1) in the first round. 

The top-seeded Schnyder fought off the match point at 5-4 before breaking Osterloh to level. The Swiss player ended the tiebreaker with a hard serve which Osterloh returned wide. 

Its a great feeling to come back, Schnyder said. To get out of that situation gives me confidence. 

Osterloh double-faulted while serving for the match in the 10th game of the third set. That is a missed opportunity, because I had the opportunity to close it out, she said. 

In other first-round matches, Amy Frazier beat Jessica Kirkland 6-3, 6-4 in an all-American match, and Finlands Emma Laine defeated Austrias Sybille Bammer 6-3, 6-1.

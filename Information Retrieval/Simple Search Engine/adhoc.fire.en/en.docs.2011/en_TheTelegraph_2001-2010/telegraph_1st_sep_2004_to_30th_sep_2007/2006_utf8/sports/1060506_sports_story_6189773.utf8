 Lara worried about teams batting

Georgetown: The West Indies will look to close out the ODI series against a depleted Zimbabwe when the two sides meet in back-to-back matches on Saturday and Sunday at the Bourda Oval. 

The hosts lead the seven-match series 2-0. 

West Indies captain Brian Lara has indicated his intention not to play all the matches, and this would be a big motivating factor to get his troops primed for battle. 

We werent as convincing as we should have been in the first two ODIs, but dont take anything away from our guys? to complete a victory is important, Lara said. 

Weve got to go back to the classroom and work on it. The Zimbabweans I think have got hope, its a situation where its unfortunate with the exodus of players, but they have to work with what they have and Im seeing one or two bright lights. 

Lara is, however, worried about his teams batting. The batting is not as solid as we would have hoped it to, he said. I am just a little worried, but I sense the guys are just getting themselves back in, we can expect better things as we go on. 

We know for a fact that if we are going to do well against better teams, weve got to score a lot more freely and make a lot more runs, Lara observed. 

The West Indies have fortified their side by including fast bowler Tino Best, left-arm chinaman bowler Dave Mohammed and uncapped left-handed opener Sewnarine Chattergoon. 

One of Laras trusted soldiers, Ramnaresh Sarwan, had a close shave when he escaped unhurt in a road accident. The 25-year-old was driving along one of the major thoroughfares in the Guyanese capital when another vehicle collided with his car. None suffered any major injury. 

I am fine, no scrapes, no scratches, no bruises or anything? Im fully available to play cricket this weekend at Bourda, Sarwan said. 

The news was not so good, however, for international umpire Eddie Nichols, whose son Dylon died in another traffic mishap. (AFP)

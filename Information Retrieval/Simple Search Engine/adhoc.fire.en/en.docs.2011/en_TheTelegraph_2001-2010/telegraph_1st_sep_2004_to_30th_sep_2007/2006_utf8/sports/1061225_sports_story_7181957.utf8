Calcutta: It was 9.45 p.m. on Sunday few hours for the Christmas parties to begin. But, at Salt Lake Stadium the celebrations were on. With fire crackers in the stands, rejoicing fans and players in a huddle, Christmas had truly come early for Mohun Bagan. And their celebrations were worth it. 

Having defied a stiff Churchill Brothers challenge to come out winners 5-3 (2-2) in the penalty shootout, Mohun Bagan made the last four (and seal a date with their Durand Cup nemesis Dempo Sports Club) in the Peerless 28th Federation Cup football tournament. 

Sundays win was a hard fought one. From being 1-2 down to levelling 2-2 in the dying minutes, Mohun Bagan took the match to extra time. Though both teams tried their hearts out, their effort was not enough to break the deadlock. 

Captain Jose Barreto started off the penalty shoot out for 11-time winners Mohun Bagan. But his effort parried by custodian Vinay Singh. The fans prayers were answered when Churchills Thokchom Naoba Singh missed his chance as well, hitting the goalpost instead. 

Dipendu Biswas clinical shot went in after hitting the bar. But it was on even keel soon following George Ekehs conversion for the Goans. However, Fabio Cortez Vidal and P.C. Lalawmpuias conversions settled the issue for the city giants, as Churchill Brothers Robert Lalthalamvana and Zenith Genius Masmangva missed out. 

Earlier, Barreto ended his goal drought to help Mohun Bagan draw first blood in the 25th minute. A Bhaichung Bhutia flick was enough for the captain to put Mohun Bagan on the front seat. But that was till the lemon break. 

Khan Thang Paites substitution (for Raju D.) right after the changeover paid dividends for Churchill Brothers. Following a free-kick from Odafe Onyeka Okolie, Ekeh headed inside the box and Paite was spot on with his header to make it 1-1. 

Minutes later, Bhaichung had a chance, but his right footer went wide. In between, both teams squandered a couple of chances before Chandam Singh struck the shot of the day from 30 yards, way out of the reach of Mohun Bagan custodian Sangram Mukherjee. 

With the scoreline reading 2-1 against the city club in the 80th minute, for a moment the dismayed home team supporters thought that it was all over. 

But there was something else in store. Just five minutes later, a Dipendu header made it 2-2, and the match went into extra time. The equaliser came off a Dharamjit Singh free-kick, which was converted by Dipendu. 

With the Durand Cup wound still fresh, it would be revenge time for Mohun Bagan in semi-finals against Dempo.

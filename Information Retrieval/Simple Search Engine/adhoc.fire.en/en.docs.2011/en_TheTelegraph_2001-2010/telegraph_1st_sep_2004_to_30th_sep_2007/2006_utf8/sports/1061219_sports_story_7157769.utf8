 Indians script history in SA

 - Zaheer, Kumble complete last rites; Prince falls for 97

Johannesburg: Dismissed as pushovers after their one-day thrashing, India Monday staged a dramatic turnaround by recording their first ever Test win on South African soil with a 123-run triumph in the first Test here. 

It was a commendable display of resilience by the Indians who had gone into the Test series with not many giving them a chance to come good on the bouncy tracks tailor-made for home teams fast bowlers. 

But the strategy backfired completely as the demoralised visitors regrouped to plot a sensational South African defeat, riding on some gritty batting performances and the bowling heroics of young Sreesanth. 

Chasing a stiff target of 402 for victory, the South Africans resumed at a shaky 163 for five and were bowled out for 278 just at the stroke of lunch break on the fourth day itself. Ashwell Prince (97) made a valiant effort to resurrect the innings but got little support from other batsmen. 

Sreesanth, who ripped through the top order in both the innings, to finish with match figures of eight for 99, earned the Man of the Match award. Zaheer Khan (three for 79) and Anil Kumble (three for 54) were the other wicket-takers in the second innings. 

After Zaheer dismissed wicketkeeper-batsman Mark Boucher (23) in the fourth over of the day, Kumble ransacked the tail to cap the fine effort of the Indians right through the match. All-rounder Shaun Pollock made a defiant 40 off 41 balls and added 67 runs from 87 balls with Prince. 

But with almost two days left, it was never going to be enough to resist India who have now taken a 1-0 lead in the three-Test rubber. Pollocks rearguard action eventually proved to be flickers of a dying lamp and his innings, that consisted six fours and a six, came to an end when he was bowled by Kumble. 

The 35-year-old Bangalorean then trapped Andre Nel lbw, before he broke the resistance of Prince who faced 223 balls and struck 11 boundaries. Dravid at this stage brought on Sreesanth to do the honours of finishing the match which had much been shaped by his fiery burst of bowling. 

The second new ball was claimed to facilitate the process. But it was Zaheer who put the seal of victory when he had Makhaya Ntini caught in covers by Virender Sehwag, the innings folding up in 86.5 overs. 

Proteas squad 

Meanwhile, South Africa have called uncapped spinner Paul Harris into their squad for the next two Tests in Durban (from December 26) and Cape Town (from January 2). 

Harris, who played eight county championship matches for Warwickshire this year, has replaced fellow slow left-armer Nicky Boje, who announced his retirement from international cricket last week despite being selected for the first Test against India. 

Wrist-spinner Paul Adams and batsman Jacques Rudolph, both of whom were released for domestic action last weekend, remain in the 15-man squad, while uncapped paceman Morne Morkel has been placed on standby for the injured Dale .

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Promising season on cards from Thursday 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: A good beginning is half the job done, so goes the saying. A quick glance at the winter-season opener, on Thursday, suggests that the RCTC stewards mean business right from the start.

 The six-event card boasts of a healthy average of eight runners per event and the fields also bear a competitive look. It is another matter that the seasons prospectus could not be readied on time. But stewards informed the media persons on Sunday that the delay was because of uncertainty about Invitational races. The worrying factors have now fallen in line, punters may look forward to a promising season ahead.

 There are two trophy events on the cards but all eyes will be on the speedster Best Of The Blues in the 1,200m Rising Star Cup.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 No interaction with Thommo yet

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: Coach Greg Chappell hasnt been able to work out the date and time when the legendary quick, Jeff Thomson, is going to interact with Team Indias new ball bowl- ers. 

It will be at some stage, over the next couple of days, but I cant say when... Ive got to see how things go, he said on Tuesday afternoon. 

That Chappell had requested Thomson, who played 26 Tests under him, to have a word with his quicks was first reported by The Telegraph last week. Im going to say some tough words, Thomson warned.

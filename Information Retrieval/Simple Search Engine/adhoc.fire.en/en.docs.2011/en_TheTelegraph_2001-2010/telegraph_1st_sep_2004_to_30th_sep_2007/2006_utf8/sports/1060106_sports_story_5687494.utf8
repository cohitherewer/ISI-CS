 Sania goes down to Venus

Hong Kong: Wimbledon champion Venus Williams overcame an injury scare to down Sania Mirza 6-3, 6-3 in the Champions Challenge here on Thursday. 

 The five-time Grand Slam winner was struggling at a break down in the first set before leaving the court for 11 minutes of treatment to her left hip. 

But Venus, who had not played since pulling out of the China Open in September with a knee injury, broke the teenager three times in a row on her return. 

 Sania had capitalised on some erratic serving to break Venus in the first game at the exhibition tournament. 

 But with the Indian 3-2 up and eyeing a one-set lead, Venus called for the trainer and disappeared off-court clutching a handbag. 

 Rejuvenated by her break, Venus immediately broke twice before serving out at 6-3. 

Sania, the first Indian woman to win a WTA tour event, went another break down at the start of the second before breaking back for 2-2 as Venus double-faulted. 

The Indian world No. 34, buoyed by strong local support, found another break, but could not hold her own serve, double-faulting and putting a backhand pass wide to go 4-3 down. Serving to stay in the match, she was broken again as Venus converted her third match point. 

 It was Venus second win over Sania in two meetings after her 6-3, 6-2 victory in Stanford, last year. (AFP)

 - ICC retains all seven Match Referees 

MATCH REFEREES PANEL 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Jawagal Srinath 

Calcutta: A shade over three years after his last India appearance, Jawagal Srinath has landed a new job: Match Referee on the International Cricket Councils (ICCs) Elite Panel. 

I played the game fair and square? The way cricket should be played? Thats going to be at the back of my mind when I begin assignments, Srinath, who took 236 wickets in Tests and 315 in ODIs, told The Telegraph. 

Asked whether he would be as gentle in his new role as he used to be on the playing field (except when infuriated by some decisions), Srinath laughed: Despite my nature, didnt I bowl bouncers? 

Speaking from Bangalore, on Monday evening, he added: Its this afternoon that I got an e-mail from Dave (Richardson), informing me of my appointment? Its an honour, definitely. 

Richardson is the general manager (cricket) and was the first to interview Srinath, earlier this month. The former quick was also interviewed (over the phone) by chief executive Malcolm Speed. 

He was quizzed about the Match Referees role, his commitment and keenness for the job. 

Cricket committee chairman Sunil Gavaskar had a big hand in reviewing the performance of the existing Match Referees (seven in number), but didnt interview Srinath. 

Significantly, contrary to an agency report, Chris Broad hasnt been dropped. In fact, all seven have been retained for 2006-07, with Srinath as an addition. 

Actually, at 36, Srinath is the youngest on the panel. 

Among others, he beat four compatriots (Dilip Vengsarkar, Shivlal Yadav, Kiran More, Robin Singh) and three Pakistanis ? Talat Ali, Col. (retd) Naushad Ali, Pervez Sajjad. 

The last Match Referee from India was Gundappa Viswanath, who finished in 2004-05. Theres no Indian on the umpires panel, though. 

Srinath has been placed in Tier-II, which means he wont be given assignments throughout the next 12 months. Clive Lloyd and Alan Hurst are in the same bracket. 

The Tier-I Match Referees are (chief) Ranjan Madugalle, Mike Procter, Jeff Crowe, Broad and Roshan Mahanama. 

Mahanama, who was in India recently, has been given a 24-month contract. For the last two years, the renewal was done annually. 

Srinath will have to undergo a crash course of sorts conducted by former New Zealand umpire Doug Cowie, manager of the Match Referee and umpires panels. 

Im not sure whether Ive got to go to Dubai (where the ICC is headquartered) or meet Cowie somewhere else, Srinath said. 

In the next day or so, however, he intends having a one-on-one with fellow-Bangalorean Viswanath. 

Vishy called to convey his congratulations and I used the occasion to seek a meeting with him. His tips are bound to be helpful, Srinath remarked. 

He signed off quipping: Even at my best, I never received as many calls from the Media as in the last hour or so? 

Once Srinath wears the ICC blazer, though, his lips are going to be sealed. 

Tier I: Chief Ranjan Madugalle (Sri Lanka), Mike Procter (South Africa), Jeff Crowe (New Zealand), Chris Broad (England), Roshan Mahanama (SL). 

TierII: Clive Lloyd (West Indies), Alan Hurst (Australia), Jawagal Srinath (India).

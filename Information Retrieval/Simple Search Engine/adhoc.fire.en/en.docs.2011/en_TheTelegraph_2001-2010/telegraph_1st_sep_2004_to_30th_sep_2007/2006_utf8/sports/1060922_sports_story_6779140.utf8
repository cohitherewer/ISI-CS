The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasanta all praise for striker

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee, it looked, has just been sanctioned a hard-earned Puja vacation. Having left to defend for most of the 120 minutes, Vimal Pariyars goal in the 119th minute came as a big relief for him. 

I am naturally happy to be in the quarter-finals, said Banerjee. It will also allow me to make six changes in the team. We did not play too well today. My defence and midfield need to be organised. 

The Bengal team will leave for Calcutta in groups on Friday and will return to Haryana in the second week of next month to play the final rounds. 

Banerjee said he was surprised that a positive striker like Pariyar has been kept out of the national team. I dont know why he has been kept out of the national team. He is dangerous in the box and a regular goalscorer. He should be there.

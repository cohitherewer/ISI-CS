 PCB rejects misgivings over Mushtaq

Islamabad: The PCB has rejected misgivings by the ICC over the appointment of leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed as assistant coach for the squad at the Champions Trophy. 

A PCB official said that ICC chief executive, Malcolm Speed, had sent a message pointing out that Mushtaqs appointment in the ICC organised tournament was unexpected given his role in a match-fixing scandal some years back. But in one last act, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan, who resigned on Friday, rejected the ICC point. 

The chairman Shaharyar Khan rejected the point raised by Speed over Mushtaq, the official said. (Reuters)

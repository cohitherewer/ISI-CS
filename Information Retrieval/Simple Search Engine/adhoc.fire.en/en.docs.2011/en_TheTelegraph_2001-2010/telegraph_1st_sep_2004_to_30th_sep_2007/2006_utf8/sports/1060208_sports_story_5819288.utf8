 Campbells act exposes a leadership vacuum

 - Vieiras departure has left a yawning chasm in arsenal

Sol Campbells disappearing act has answered any remaining questions about his leadership abilities ? he doesnt have any ? although he is not the only one who has failed to step into the breach at Arsenal this season. Dennis Bergkamp confirmed on Monday his teammates belief that Patrick Vieiras departure has left a yawning chasm that is yet to be filled, a truism no less damaging for the fact it is self-evident. 

Campbell was back in training on Monday after a weekend in Brussels and, although Arsene Wenger was pleased to see him, the impact of his return is far from certain. Arsenal appeared to cope well enough in his absence in their 2-0 win over Birmingham City, a victory that will do more to raise their battered morale than the presence of the England defender. 

In fairness to Campbell, he has never considered himself captaincy material, insisting he had no wish to succeed Vieira. I wouldnt have liked the armband, not really, no, Campbell had said. Not at all. It should be the person who has played longest at a club, say if someones been there five, six, seven years, I think they should be captain. Thats natural. 

Im a leader but I think I hold back. If I was the real me I could be a little bit frightened of myself. Not frightened, but you know, theres something inside that stops you from going over the edge, ranting and raving too much. Ive found a nice balance; I can be myself and say things when things need to be said. Its all about balance. If youre shouting all day long, after a while it goes in one ear and out the other. 

Wenger also appears to hold the view that the best player should be captain, appointing in Vieiras place Thierry Henry, a different character to his fellow Frenchman. Where Vieira could drive his team forward through sheer force of character, dominating a midfield by himself, as Bergkamp put it, Henry is a more introverted player, often appearing to retreat into his shell when the going gets tough. He leads by deeds rather than by words. 

For all his magnificent performances and the various records he has set, Henry has not played like a captain this season. 

 It is always difficult for a striker to lead from the front, with his back to much of the action, but even more so for such a supremely talented individual. As Glenn Hoddle has discovered to his cost, frustration at the inability of lesser mortals inhibits your ability to inspire them, with Henry often shrugging his shoulders in exasperation at his colleagues failings rather than seeking to raise them to a higher level. 

The selfish streak inherent in every top-class striker has also undermined his captaincy credentials, with some of his decisions this season bordering on the bizarre. After the Robert Pires penalty farce against Manchester City, Henry pledged to assume all responsibilities in the future, but when given the chance to live up to his word in the Carling Cup semi-final against Wigan Athletic last month, he demurred. Even more strangely, Lauren, Arsenals second-choice penalty-taker, proved equally reluctant, with Jose Antonio Reyes spot kick ultimately saved. 

Such is his status at the club that Wenger, whose choice of captain has been widely criticised, refuses to chastise Henry. It is noteworthy, too, that the other senior figures have not been pulling their weight either. 

Gilberto Silva, who was expected to fill Vieiras shoes, has not performed in the manner expected of a Brazil World Cup-winner and appears to have shunned the extra responsibility, while the influence of Fredrik Ljungberg and Pires also appears to be dimming. With his retirement date just months away, Bergkamp has made more impact with his words than with his magic wand of a right foot. 

It is telling that Arsenals best performers have been their youngsters, with Robin van Persie, Kolo Toure and now Abou Diaby appearing to enjoy their new starring roles. With a vacuum at the top, Arsenals youngsters are showing the way forward.

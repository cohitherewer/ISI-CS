 Gangjee finishes tied 3rd

 Brunei Open

 Bandar Seri Begawan: Rahil 

 Gangjee made a scintillating spurt with four birdies and 

 a chip-in for eagle in the space of seven holes to finish 

 tied third at the Brunei Open, his best result since the 

 win in the Volkswagen Masters in China two years ago.

 Gangjees final round of 

 three-under 68 helped him to a 12-under 272, four shots 

 behind winner Wang Ter-Chang of Chinese Taipei.

 Both Wang and Australian David 

 Gleeson finished 16-under and went into a play-off, where 

 the 44-year-old Wang won on the second play-off hole for 

 his fourth title on the Asian Tour.

 Adding to the Indian joy was Jyoti 

 Randhawas surge with a five-under 66 in the final 

 round that saw him rise to tied eighth after having been 

 in danger of missing the cut with a two-over in first round.

 Gangjee, who held the first-round 

 lead, was in danger of slipping low down the ladder, when 

 he suddenly found his putting touch. He was two-over after 

 a double bogey on the eighth and in danger of slipping out 

 of the top-10. 

 But he hit a purple patch with 

 birdies on ninth, 11th, 12th and 13th. After a par on 14th, 

 he chipped in for an eagle from 20 feet on the 15th. (PTI)

 PCB to propose change in ball colour

 - Weather affects preparation in Faisalabad 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Shaharyar Khan 

Lahore: Even though trials with orange and yellowish balls havent had exciting results in Australia and South Africa, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) intends asking the world body to consider replacing the red ball with some other colour at the highest level. 

As batsmen have problems with the red ball even under lights, the International Cricket Council (ICC) should consider replacing it with some other colour ... If Wimbledon could break with tradition, why not Test cricket? Well soon send a formal proposal, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan told The Telegraph. 

Speaking in his plush office at the Gaddafi, on Tuesday, he added: Lahore has one of the finest set of floodlights, yet so much time was lost in the first Test. So, perhaps, the ICC can explore the possibility of baseball-like lights where the towers are smaller and the illumination much more focused ... 

Shaharyar indicated even thats going to feature in the PCBs proposal. However, beyond a point, Test cricket cant be played under artificial lights. Umpires wont continue once the natural light has gone totally, reminded somebody connected with the ICC. 

Meanwhile, Shaharyar accepted that the weather-related hiccups notwithstanding, every blade of grass ought not to have been removed from the Gaddafi: I agree it shouldnt have been shaved ... We wanted to prepare a very different wicket, but enough sunshine just wasnt there ... The baking process didnt take off ... 

According to Shaharyar, the PCB wants the wicket in Faisalabad (venue of the second Test) to have life, but foul weather there, too, is affecting its preparation. Worse, the Iqbal Stadium doesnt have floodlights and, so, the fear of even less cricket is real. 

There would, obviously, have been fewer problems had Karachi been given the first Test. That wasnt done as the Indians didnt want an extended stay in that often troubled port city. The PCB, though, could have found a solution by scheduling the tour-opener in Lahore and, then, flying Rahul Dravid and Co. to Karachi. 

Lessons have to be learnt and the PCB isnt exempted.

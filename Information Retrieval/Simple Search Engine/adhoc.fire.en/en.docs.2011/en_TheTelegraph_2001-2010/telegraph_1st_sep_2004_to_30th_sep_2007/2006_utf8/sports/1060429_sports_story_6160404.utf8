The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 - My privacy was totally under siege... Thats not part of my life...

 Lisbon: Portugals Brazilian coach Luiz 

 Felipe Scolari stunned the soccer world on Friday by withdrawing 

 from the race to become England manager because of unbearable 

 media intrusion. 

 In a news conference televised from Portugals 

 World Cup training site in Germany, Scolari said his plans 

 would be open after July 31 when his contract with the Portuguese 

 Football Federation ran out. 

He said his decision was linked to his feelings for Portugal and the relentless media pressure since his name surfaced two days ago as the likely candidate to succeed Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson as Englands manager. 

There are 20 reporters outside my house now, he said. If that is part of another culture, it is not part of my culture. I am not the coach, and will not be (Englands) coach. 

I dont want this situation involving England because in two days during which I was not coach, I never agreed to anything, life was invaded, Scolari said. My privacy was totally under siege. 

Scolari said the press had made absurd comparisons of him and his wife with Eriksson and the Swedes partner, and how they dressed. Thats not part of my life and its never going to be. 

Turning to Portugal, he said: I want to appeal to you at this moment, mainly those from Portugal, to tell you that we will continue together, lets go to the World Cup. 

England are looking to replace Eriksson, the countrys first foreign manager, who will leave after the World Cup. Scolaris contract with Portugal expires after the finals in Germany. 

FA chief executive Brian Barwick travelled to Lisbon on Wednesday for a meeting with Scolari which the Brazilian later described as a simple talk, informal and with the consent of the Portuguese Football Federation. 

Englands Football Association released only a brief comment, saying they knew Scolari would release a statement. 

We will now reflect on his announcement before making any further comment as we move forward with the process of finding a new England manager, the FA said. 

The 57-year-old Scolari, who led Brazil to their 2002 World Cup triumph and took Portugal to the final of Euro 2004, knocking out England on both occasions, had become a surprise front-runner. 

English favourite Steve McClaren of Middlesbrough, Charltons Alan Curbishley and Boltons Sam Allardyce, along with Northern Irishman Martin Neill, were early favourites ? and will now return to centrestage. 

 Media intrusion has frequently been a cause of complaint 

 by Eriksson during his tenure.

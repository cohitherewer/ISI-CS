 Bacher: Do away with quota system

London: The appointment of coloured cricketer Ashwell Prince as captain of South Africa shows that the time has come for the country to do away with the quota system, says Ali Bacher. 

 Bacher, who played a vital role in South Africas staging the cricket World Cup in 2003, said Princes appointment would be an inspiration for black men and women in his country. 

There are extraordinary opportunities are available for black sportsmen and women in the new democracy. And they now know that if youve got the determination, the focus and the potential, you can make it to the top and ultimately lead your country, he said. 

We do have problems that need to be addressed, but the political transformation in South Africa has been miraculous. His (Prince) appointment also indicates is that we are approaching the end of a period in South African cricket where there was affirmative action and quotas, which was necessary, he wrote in a column for a British electronic media.

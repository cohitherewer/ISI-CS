 Mexico a draw from second-round berth

 - Scolari to leave out all five players who have yellow cards 

Gelsenkirchen: Two of Latin Americas top coaches face off Wednesday, with one of them bidding for World Cup survival and the other fine-tuning a European team for the next round. 

Ricardo La Volpes Mexico cant afford to lose their last group D encounter against Portugal. El Tri must win or draw against the Portuguese to advance to the second phase. 

Portugals Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has already guaranteed his team a place in the next round with two wins from two. 

Scolari said on Tuesday he would leave out all five players who had collected yellow cards in the tournament for his sides game against Mexico. 

Winger Cristiano Ronaldo and defender Nuno Valente were booked in Portugals first game against Angola. Playmaker Deco, striker Pauleta and midfielder Costinha have marks against them from the Iran clash. 

We are going to make five substitutions, as is normal when players have yellow cards, he told a news conference. The five wont play, even if Mexico are winning 30-0. 

Scolari hinted that Simao Sabrosa, Tiago and Armando Petit, who were in the starting lineup in Portugals 1-0 win over Angola, would be back again to face the Mexicans, but said there would be no deviation from the 4-2-3-1 formation. 

I have no concerns about the substitutes, because some of these players were chosen in the first game. I have absolute confidence in all 23 players, he said. 

Known as Big Phil, Scolari has been motivating the substitutes with the prospect of making the starting 11 in the knockout stage, where the Portuguese will face either Argentina or the Netherlands. 

All I ask from the players is that they give their best on the pitch tomorrow. That way I can think about who will play in the next round, he said. 

 Well be playing to win against Mexico, captain Luis Figo said. Thats the only way we know how to play. 

The Portuguese have so far failed to dazzle on the pitch, although the coach said Portugal had quality, confidence and condition and were getting better all the time. 

After progressing to the second round for the first time since 1966 when Portugal reached the semi-finals of the tournament but were eliminated by England, the squad had been getting pep-talks from Eusebio, Portugals hero 40 years ago. 

Many times he has lunch or dinner with us and speaks to the players. This motivates them and will help them reach the form needed to get to the next phase, Scolari said. 

The winners of groups C and D meet the second-placed teams in the other group. Argentina and The Netherlands meet for top place in group C, so theres no easy route through the second round for the group D winner anyway. 

Mexicos qualification campaign has gone down to the wire after last weeks scoreless draw against first-time qualifiers Angola, that came after an opening 3-1 win over Iran. 

That has left the Mexicans doing the math. 

If Iran wins or draws against Angola on Wednesday in Leipzig, that would also send Mexico into the second round. Both matches start at the same time. 

If Mexico loses and Angola wins, the first tie-breaker would be goal differential. Mexico has a three-goal edge in that category, at plus-2 to Angolas minus-1. 

Striker Francisco Fonseca said the Mexican line-up had only one outcome in mind. We believe we are a better team than Portugal, he said. Whats important is for us to win and get to the second phase. 

La Volpe has once again to plug a gap left by the absence of veteran striker Jared Borgetti. 

The 33-year-old Bolton striker missed his teams match with Angola last Friday with a torn left thigh muscle, and the game ended in a scoreless draw. But two other players have recovered from injuries and are expected to play. 

Defender Rafael Marquez, Mexicos captain, had complained of muscle spasms in his right thigh, and attacking midfielder Antonio Naelson ? known as Zinha ? had a right-knee injury. 

Portugal and Mexico have met only once before, in a 1969 friendly that ended in a goalless draw. (agencies)

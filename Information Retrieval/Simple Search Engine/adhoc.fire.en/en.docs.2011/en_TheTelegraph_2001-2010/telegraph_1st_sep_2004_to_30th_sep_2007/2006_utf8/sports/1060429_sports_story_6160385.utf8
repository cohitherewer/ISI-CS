 Amandeep Johl 

Seoul: Amandeep Johl stayed in contention with a second successive three-under 69 to remain tied for sixth place in the $600,000 GS Caltex Maekyung Open at the Lakeside Country Club on Friday. 

The Indian golfer, who was second at the same event three years ago, has a score of six-under and is now well placed to make a bid for his maiden title. 

Korean Lee Seung Man roared ahead with a six-under-par 66 for the halfway lead. Lee, 26, has a two-day total of 11-under 133 to open a two stroke lead over compatriot Kim Sang-Ki who shot an impressive 65. 

Local talent Suk Jong-Ryul carded a 69 and shared third position with another Korean Lee Seong-Hoon who managed a 68, while American Bryan Saltus shot the same score to stay in lone fifth position. 

There was a six-way tie at sixth place, including Johl. 

Rahil Gangjee added a two-under 70 to his first day 72 to be three-under 141 at the midway stage to be tied for 21st place. Also making the cut was Gaurav Ghei, whose second round 70 gave him a two-day total of two-under 140 and a tied 32nd place. 

Missing the halfway cut were Harmeet Kahlon (73, 71) and Shiv Kapur (76, 71) who were at three-over 147 as the cut came at even par. 

I am happy with the way I hit, but the putting could have been much better. I hope I can make up over next two days, said Johl. 

Johl, who excelled on the back nine on the first day on Thursday, did the same again today with three birdies on 11th, 16th and 17th. He could well have been at least three shots better if not more but his putter let him down as he needed 31 putts as against just 25 on the first day. Overall he had five birdies and two bogeys.

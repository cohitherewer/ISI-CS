 Preparation wasnt good, says Anju

Melbourne: Anju Bobby George wore a disappointed look after finishing a poor sixth in womens long jump on Friday. Local girl Bronwyn Thompson took the gold. 

The preparation did not go well for me. Bronwyn had done so well in her second attempt itself (6.97m which ensured gold) that I hoped to get a silver, Anju said. The world No. 5 also said she had not got into her best rhythm yet. 

March is too early for meets, the season starts in May. I could not get my run-up properly in three jumps today, said Anju who managed 6.54 on her third attempt. It was way below her personal best of 6.83. The rhythm was also lacking. (PTI)

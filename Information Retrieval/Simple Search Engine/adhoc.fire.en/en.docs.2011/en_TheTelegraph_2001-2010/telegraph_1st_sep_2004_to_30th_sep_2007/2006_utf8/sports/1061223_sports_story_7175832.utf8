 Surya, Thipsay still on top 

 NATIONAL A CHESS 

 Surya Sekhar Ganguly

Valsad: Third-seeded International Master Diwakar Singh of Jharkhand on Friday shot back into reckoning for the top honours after he won his sixth round game and finished on a joint second spot at the 44th National A Chess Championship here. 

Diwakar, pitted against young IM Deep Sengupta, continued with his strategy of adopting rarely played lines to draw the game into unexplored territory. 

However, his idea backfired as Sengupta gained an advantageous position in the queen pawn game. 

Sengupta won a pawn on the 23rd move and a big upset was on the cards as he was coasting towards victory. However, in a hectic time scramble he allowed his rook to be pinned by Diwakars queen on the 30th move. 

The rest was a matter of technique for Diwakar to romp home on the 39th move. 

On the top of the table, the encounter between overnight leaders GM Pravin Thipsay and GM Surya Sekhar Ganguly was a French defence game. 

Thipsay, playing white, opted for his favourite advance variation in this opening. The game developed on the well-known theoretical lines with neither player gaining any advantage. They settled for a draw after 16 moves. 

The spate of drawn games continued on the second table where GM Deepan Chakravarthy took on GM Dibyendu Barua. Similarly, the game between IM S Arun Prasad and G.N. Gopal ended in a tame draw. 

The lead continued to be with Surya Sekhar and Thipsay with a score of 4.5 points.

Calcutta: First round leader Hendrik Burhmann of South Africa hit a course-record equalling seven-under-par 65 to take a share of the lead at the end of the third round at the Aamby Valley Asian Masters on Saturday. 

According to information received here, Burhmann hit two stunning eagles which took him to the top of the leaderboard with Indias Ashok Kumar and Simon Hurd of England. 

Buhrmann ? who came up with two eagles, four birdies and just one bogey on the 16th, ? thus equalled the course record set by Shiv Kapur last year. 

Overnight leader Kumar carded a one-over 73 which was highlighted by 37 putts and a 15-foot birdie on the closing hole, the 18th, which saw just seven birdies during the day and once again proved to be the toughest hole. 

Hurd, who carded a 69 in the inaugural $400,000 Asian Tour event at the Aamby Valley Golf Club, could have taken sole lead but for a dropped a shot on his last hole after finding thick rough with his tee shot. 

Englands Simon Griffiths, who is playing competitive golf after a three-year hiatus, quietly moved up the charts with an impressive 67 to lie one shot behind the co-leaders, while Australian rookie Kane Webber, who returned a 66, was a further two strokes behind on 209. 

Gaurav Ghei (68) and Rahul Ganapathy (69) were both in contention for a top-10 finish. Ghei was tied seventh at five-under and Ganapathy was tied ninth with four-under. 

Ashok stumbled early on, dropping a bogey on the fourth and a double bogey on the par three sixth after taking two shots to get out of a bunker. 

Just as Ghei was looking all set to pose a challenge to the leaders on the final day on Sunday with a six-under after 15, he dropped two shots on last three holes. I bogeyed the 16th and 18th and that was a big disappointment, said Ghei.

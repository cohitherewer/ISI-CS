The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Argentina, Netherlands in goalless 

 tie; Ivorians win

 Frankfurt: Argentina and 

 The Netherlands cancelled each other out in a 0-0 World 

 Cup Group C draw on Wednesday.

 The Argentines finished on top on goal difference and will 

 meet Mexico in Leipzig in the second round on Saturday. 

 The Dutch face Portugal in Nuremberg on Sunday.

 In another match in Munich, Ivory Coast came back from two 

 goals down to beat Serbia and Montenegro 3-2 on Wednesday 

 and record their first victory at a World Cup finals. Both 

 teams were already eliminated after losing their opening 

 two games to Group C leaders Argentina and Netherlands.

 Serbia and Montenegro went two up via Nikola Zigic and Sasa 

 Ilic in the 10th and 20th minutes. Aruna Dindane scored 

 twice in the 36th and 67th minutes for Ivory Coast, while 

 Bonaventure Kalou netted the final goal in the 86th minute 

 via penalty.

 A tight, tactical battle only sprung to life on isolated 

 occasions, mainly when Argentina threatened to score, having 

 created more chances. After the teams had weighed each other 

 up for the opening quarter of an hour, the first shot on 

 target came from the Dutch. 

 An error by right back Nicolas Burdisso allowed winger Dirk 

 Kuijt to force a leaping save from keeper Roberto Abbondanzieri.

 Minutes later, Argentina strung together a long passing 

 movement which ended with Carlos Tevez shooting narrowly 

 wide of Edwin van der Sars right-hand post.

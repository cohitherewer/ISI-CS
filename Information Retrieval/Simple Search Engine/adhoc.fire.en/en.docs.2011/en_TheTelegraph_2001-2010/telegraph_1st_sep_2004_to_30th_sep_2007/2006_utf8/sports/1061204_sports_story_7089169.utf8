 Owen return

London: Injured England striker Michael Owen hopes to be back playing for his club Newcastle United before the end of the season. 

Owen suffered a cruciate ligament injury during a World Cup match against Sweden in June and has since had two operations on his knee. 

Im confident that I can play again this season. Itll be great if I could, Owen told a British radio station on Sunday. 

I have a scan at the turn of the year and as long as everythings knitted together quite nicely well press on. Hopefully, I can start jogging in early February and then well really kick on from that. 

Its been a long slog so far and theres still quite a lot of work to be done till Im back out playing but Ive got other things that are keeping me occupied and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now, added the 26-year-old former Liverpool and Real Madrid player.

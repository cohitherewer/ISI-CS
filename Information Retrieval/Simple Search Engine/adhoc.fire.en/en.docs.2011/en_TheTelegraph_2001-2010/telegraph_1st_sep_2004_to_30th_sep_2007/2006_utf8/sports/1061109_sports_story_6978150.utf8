 Ponting willing to apologise to Pawar

Melbourne: Australia captain Ricky Ponting said on Wednesday his team did not intend to show any disrespect to BCCI chief Sharad Pawar during the Champions Trophy presentation ceremony in Mumbai on Sunday. 

Rattled by the reactions in India over the nudging of Pawar, Ponting sought to put the lid on the controversy by offering to apologise.. 

Admitting that the whole episode had dampened their maiden Champions Trophy victory, Ponting said: Im a bit disappointed that some of the gloss has been taken off, but Ill be doing the best I can to get to the concerned people in India to get my point across and let them know we werent trying to embarrass them, Ponting said. 

We were all pretty keen to get the photo taken and get off the stage and enjoy the moment for what it was, , he told reporters. 

Asked if he would consider tendering an apology to the BCCI supremo, Ponting said: I probably will, yeah. If we all feel thats relevant well probably do that. 

Once Ive spoken to him and got an idea of how hes taken the thing and not just whats been said by the Indian journalists, if it is required Ill certainly do it (apologise). 

Weve got to show due respect to everyone around us. Thats part of representing your country. Hopefully we havent offended him too much and weve got to be aware of those sort of things in the future, he said. 

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said he was satisfied the players had not meant to offend Pawar but was disappointed at the way the team had been portrayed in the Indian media. 

It is really disappointing because I know our players have the utmost respect for India, he said. 

BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said they considered the affair closed. We did not make an issue out of it from the start, he said. Now that Ricky Ponting is willing to tender an apology, the matter is closed.

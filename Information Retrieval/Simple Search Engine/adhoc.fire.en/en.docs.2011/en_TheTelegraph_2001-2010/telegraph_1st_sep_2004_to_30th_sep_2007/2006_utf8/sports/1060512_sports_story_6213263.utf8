 Not aiming to be top scorer: Ronaldo

Madrid: Brazil striker Ronaldo looked to rebuild bridges with Real Madrid on Wednesday when he said he would be happy to stay at the club. 

At the moment there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the club after a difficult year, Ronaldo told a news conference. But I have a contract with Real (until 2008) so when I return from (the) World Cup, if the new president wants me I would be delighted to stay. 

The striker appeared to be on his way out in February when, after being whistled by a section of fans, he said he would consider his future at the end of the season. 

Ronaldos attitude to the Real supporters remains cautious. I am happy in Madrid and want to be successful here but if the fans dont want me I dont want to be a problem for them. 

Many times the responsibility, if things go wrong, seems to fall on one or two players, and one bad event affects the atmosphere and the teams performance. I hope things are put right soon so that everyone can be a little calmer and we can all look forward to a great season next year. 

Real are coming to the end of their third successive season without a major trophy, their worst run for more than 50 years. 

Ronaldo is likely to miss Reals last game of the season against Sevilla on Tuesday because of injury but is looking ahead to the World Cup in Germany in positive mood. 

It has been a difficult year for me with injuries but I have got over them and the important thing now is to prepare properly for the World Cup, he said. I am not aiming to be the top scorer, I just want to win the Cup and if I can score three or more goals I will be happy.

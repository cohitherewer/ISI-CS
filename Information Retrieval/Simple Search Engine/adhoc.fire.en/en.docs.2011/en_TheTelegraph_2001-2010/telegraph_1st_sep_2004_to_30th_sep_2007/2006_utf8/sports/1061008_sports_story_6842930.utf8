 Brian Lara wary of Zimbabwe

 - Defending champions start campaign today 

Ahmedabad: The 5-0 conquest at home notwithstanding, the West Indies will be wary of Zimbabwe in their opening qualifying match for the ICC Champions Trophy here on Sunday, says captain Brian Lara. 

Lara said the African nation had a much improved side now and was capable of springing a few surprises. 

They have improved, they are talented and they are very competitive. And the more they play, the more they will improve, Lara said at the match-eve media conference. 

The batting genius said each of the four sides the West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe and Bangladesh battling for the two berths in the main tournament would try their level best to make the cut. 

So, no team can be taken lightly, he said. 

The talismanic left-hander said despite the one-sided result when the two sides met earlier this year, he had liked what he saw of the Zimbabweans. 

In this context, he referred to Bangladeshs surprise wins over Australia and Pakistan. 

If Bangladesh are already taking care of such teams, then they can do it to any other side. And there is no doubt that the other so-called lesser known sides are also capable of coming up with such performances. 

Lara said the West Indies would put up their best combination and could effect one or two changes from the side that played the tri-series final in Kuala Lumpur last month. 

But what is important is that all the guys are vying to be in the team. Its a very healthy atmosphere, he said. Form and recent records, though, favour the defending champions.

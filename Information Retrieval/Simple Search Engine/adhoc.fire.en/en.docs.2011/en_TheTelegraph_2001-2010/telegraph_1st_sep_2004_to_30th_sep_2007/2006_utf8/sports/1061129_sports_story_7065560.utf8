 Sachin should bat like Lara: Akram 

Port Elizabeth: Wasim Akram has suggested Sachin Tendulkar show the same aggressive approach to his batting as Brian Lara. 

I have been watching Sachin. He has achieved everything. Now he should be toying with the bowling like Lara does. People say he has responsibility but so has Lara, Akram said after Indias defeat in Cape Town where Sachin scored 2. 

Sachin should come out and play his shots, especially in one-day cricket. When he goes back in his shell, leaving deliveries outside the off stump, then the bowler gets to him. (PTI)

 Vengsarkar against picking Sharma for home ODIs

 - Chief selector defends flip-flop over young quick 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Durban: The flip-flop over young Delhi quick Ishant Sharma has fuelled speculation that he could actually be capped sooner rather than later. Selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar, though, isnt thinking that way. 

Im personally not in favour of picking him for the eight ODIs at home, before the World Cup... However, one cant say anything definitely, Vengsarkar told The Telegraph on Thursday. 

On returning home, the Indians will play four ODIs against the West Indies (January 21-30) and, then, four versus Sri Lanka (February 8-17). India and Sri Lanka are in the same group in the World Cup being hosted by the West Indies.

 Defending the turnaround, which 

 has left egg on many faces, Vengsarkar said: We had 

 a rethink and my colleagues felt it would be better for 

 him to play Ranji Trophy instead of sitting in the dressing 

 room at Newlands... Also, Munaf Patel has got fitter... 

Till the flip-flop on Wednesday, Sharma was to have come straight to Cape Town, where the third and final Test begins on January 2.

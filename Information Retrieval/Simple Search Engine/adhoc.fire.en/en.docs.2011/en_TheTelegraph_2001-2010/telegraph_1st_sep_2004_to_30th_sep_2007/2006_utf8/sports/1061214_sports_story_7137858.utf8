Multan: Marlon Samuels smashed his first ODI century in four years Wednesday, powering the West Indies to an emphatic seven-wicket victory over a new-look Pakistan in the fourth one-dayer of the series. 

The 25-year-old Jamaican hit a six and 17 fours in his unbeaten 100 as the West Indies raced to 212 for three in 34.5 overs after dismissing Pakistan for 209 in 49.5 overs. Thus, the West Indies narrowed Pakistans lead to 2-1 in the five-match series with the final match to be played in Karachi on December 16. 

Terming it as an exceptional effort, the WI skipper Brian Lara, who hit the winning boundary and stayed unbeaten on 13, said: We showed a lot of character despite being 0-2 down in the series and I am proud of the performance of my team. 

Pacer Rana Naved-ul Hasan gave Pakistan hope of defending the total when he bowled Chris Gayle (9) with a full pitched delivery, then had Lendl Simmons lbw off successive deliveries in his second over. 

However, a 141-run partnership between Samuels and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (60 off 82 balls) bettered the previous best third wicket stand for the West Indies against Pakistan when Richie Richardson and Viv Richards scored 137 runs at Karachi in 1987. 

Samuels and Chanderpaul then took the game away from Pakistan with a 156-ball partnership in an awesome display of powerful hitting.

Hoylake: With another magical shot in a career already filled with them, Tiger Woods seized control of the British Open with a 7-under 65 on Friday and cast aside the notion that his poor performance in the US Open was anything more than a rare off week. 

The defending champion, who missed the cut at Winged Foot a month ago, holed his second shot from 204 yards at the par 5 14th to open up a three-stroke lead at 12-under. 

That was cut to one by Ernie Els, who matched his 65 and moved smoothly to 11-under 133 with Chris DiMarco third, two strokes further back after another 65, which was also a course record. 

Retief Goosen, a two-time US Open champion, was fourth at 8 under after a 66 that included two eagles. 

Woods had already grabbed the lead when he stood over a 4-iron at No. 14. He ripped a low shot that caught the edge of the green and hopped three more times before striking the stick and dropping straight in for eagle. 

Woods stood in the middle of the 14th fairway with a dazed look, so far away from the green he couldnt tell where his ball landed. 

It went in? Woods asked caddie Steve Williams. Yes, it did. He shrugged his shoulders, almost as if he was apologising, then broke into a wide grin and gave his caddie a high-five. 

The shot pushed Woods score to 11-under par ? the first golfer into double figures ? and provided a three-shot cushion over DiMarco. 

Its a bonus, Woods said. Trust me, Im not trying to put the ball in the hole. Im just trying to put it on the green and get out of there with a 4. 

Instead, he wrote down a 2. 

Everyone faces the daunting task of chasing down Woods, who has never been beaten when hes got a 36-hole lead in a major. 

Woods said its too early to claim victory this year. Im not here with the Jug, he said. Weve got 36 more holes to go. 

Els, a three-time major winner who took the Claret Jug in 2002, didnt fade away in the afternoon, even with the winds off the Irish Sea kicking up just a bit. 

The Big Easy matched Woods with a 65 that was more workmanlike than his rivals ? seven birdies, no bogeys ? and theyll see each other up close on Saturday when theyre paired in the final group. 

Obviously Ive got to keep it up, Els said. Im playing with the worlds No. 1 player on the weekend. It should be fun. 

First round leader Graeme McDowell couldnt hang on after opening with a six-birdie, no-bogey 66. The little-known golfer from Northern Ireland bogeyed the first hole and slumped to a 73. 

In joint fifth position on seven-under 137 were Australias Adam Scott, Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain and Finn Mikko Ilonen.

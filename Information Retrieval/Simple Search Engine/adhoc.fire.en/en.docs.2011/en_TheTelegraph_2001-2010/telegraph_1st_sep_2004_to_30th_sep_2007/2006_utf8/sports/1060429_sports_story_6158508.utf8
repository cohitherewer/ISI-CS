 McEnroes Grand wish

Boston: John McEnroe won seven Grand Slam singles titles before retiring in 1992. Now he wants to revisit his old haunts on tennis seniors tour. 

Hopefully, the combination will be something we see soon, he said on Thursday before the Champions Cup tournament in Boston. 

A four-time US Open winner and three-time Wimbledon champion, McEnroe wants the Champions Series to schedule events in conjunction with tennis majors. That way, the senior tour would get a readymade tennis audience and fans would get a chance to see some of their old favourites and watch new stars, too. 

Former No. 1 Jim Courier put the seniors tour together, cobbling together five stops for this season. He won the first event, in Naples (Florida) last month. 

Also playing in Boston this weekend are McEnroe, Todd Martin, Aaron Krickstein, Mats Wilander, Goran Ivanisevic, Pat Cash and Mikael Pernfors. To be eligible, a player must have been ranked in the top-five or reached a Grand Slam final or played singles for a Davis Cup-winning team. 

Courier said the older players might have lost some of their footwork, but racket skills stick around for those who continue to practise. But the biggest difference is the schedule; there are only five Champions events this year, instead of a weekly schedule. 

This is a way to space it out, manage it so your body can be sustained, Courier said.

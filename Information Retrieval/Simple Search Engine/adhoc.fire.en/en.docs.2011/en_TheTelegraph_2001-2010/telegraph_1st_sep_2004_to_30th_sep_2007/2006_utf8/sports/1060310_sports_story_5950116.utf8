 Ronaldo criticises Pele 

Madrid: Real Madrid striker Ronaldo has criticised fellow Brazilian Pele for saying stupid things, rebuking Pele for his comments last week in which he said the three-time Fifa Player of the Year gets distracted. 

We dont need to pay any attention to him, Ronaldo told a radio station on Wednesday after Madrids elimination by Arsenal in the Champions Leagues second round. 

The comments by Ronaldo come following a series of criticisms by soccer luminaries and jeers from Real Madrid fan. 

Pele had said that off-the-field problems were affecting Ronaldos career and his personal life had been very mixed up. Ronaldo has shown he is a good player, and has won a lot of titles but he tends to get distracted, Pele said during a World Cup promotional trip in Shanghai. (AP)

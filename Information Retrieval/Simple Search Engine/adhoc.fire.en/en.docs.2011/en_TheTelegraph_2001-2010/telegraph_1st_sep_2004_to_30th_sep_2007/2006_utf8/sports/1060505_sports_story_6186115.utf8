 Gonzalez: Argentinas Mr Dependable

 Luis Gonzales

Argentina seem to have found the perfect formula for including Carlos Tevez, Juan Roman Riquelme and Lionel Messi in one team. The answer? Gonzalez. The man the fans have nicknamed Lucho is a complete midfielder, whose industry, class and, above all, versatility provide the foundation for his more celebrated teammates to perform. 

That is not to say Gonzalez is not himself a threat. Capable of playing out wide or bursting from deep, he scored on his debut for the national side against Honduras in 2003. While Jose Pekerman likes to play him in a deeper role for Argentina he could be a surprising source of goal-threat from a team bristling with menace. 

Jose Mourinho has had Gonzalez watched and sees him as a prototype Chelsea player: reliable, powerful and incredibly driven. 

The 25-year-olds outstanding displays as Porto cruised towards the Portuguese title have also alerted Internazionale and Roberto Mancinis side could prove a summer competitor if Chelsea do make an ?8 million move. His list of suitors will no doubt increase if he helps Argentina live up to their potential at the World Cup. 

After coming through the ranks with Huracan, Gonzalez was bought by Buenos Aires giants River Plate. He was considered the best player in Argentina as River won back-to-back Clausura titles in 2003 and 2004. Porto signed him for ?2.5 million last April. 

 Despite his grungy appearance (he has rocker hair 

 and is covered in tattoos) he has carved himself out a reputation 

 as Argentinas Mr Dependable.

 Wet start to Big W

London: Roger Federers bid for a fourth successive Wimbledon crown got off to a whirlwind start on Monday only to be stalled by the notoriously fickle London weather. 

The world No. 1 looked as if he had never been away from centre court as he claimed a service break in the second game of his first round match with Frenchman Richard Gasquet and went on to claim the first set 6-3 in just 26 minutes. 

But with Federer about to serve at 1-2 in the second, rain forced the players back to the locker room and play was suspended. 

Victory in the final here on July 9, the same day as the World Cup football final, would see Federer become the third man, after Bjorn Borg and Pete Sampras, to win four consecutive titles at the All England Club. 

The Swiss began the tournament as an overwhelming favourite. 

There is nevertheless a feeling among many in the sport that he may be more vulnerable this year after a gruelling, but ultimately unsuccessful bid to win the French Open earlier this month. 

Federer was narrowly beaten by Rafael Nadal in the final at Roland Garros and ? although he was still good enough to win the tournament ? appeared jaded as he made his first outing of the year on grass at Halle in Germany. 

Victory in Halle extended Federers unbeaten run on grass to 41 matches, taking him level with Borgs all-time mark. 

It is a sequence which included a very tight match against Gasquet which had given the Frenchman hope of upsetting the odds at Wimbledon. 

The 20-year-old continued his fine form by winning the Nottingham Open for a second consecutive year on Saturday and said prior to Mondays match that he was in with a chance. 

At Halle, I had four set points in the first, won the second and only lost 6-4 in the third, he recalled. 

This is a Grand Slam, its on the centre court at Wimbledon, so it wont be easy to beat him. But I have a chance, I know I am getting back to my best. 

Venus Williams will begin the defence of her womens singles title on Tuesday. That left centre stage on the opening day to French Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne.

 Railways retain title

 National Hockey

 New Delhi: Star-studded 

 Railways posted a comprehensive 3-0 win over a rookie-packed 

 Haryana side to claim their 20th Womens National Hockey 

 title on the trot at the Shivaji Stadium on Thursday.

 Railways kept up the pressure 

 on Haryana, who have lost many of their experienced players 

 due to switch-over to other teams.

 A fast-moving Saba Anjum drew 

 the first blood in the second minute, while Surinder Kaur 

 (16th) and Masira Surin (67th) shot home to keep the Railways 

 winning streak in the Nationals intact.

 Anjum opened the account early 

 for the Railways when she dived from the right to deflect 

 a ball after it was hit off a penalty corner. Twelve minutes 

 later, Railways got back-to-back penalty corners, one of 

 which brought the second goal through Surinder. 

 The final goal came just minutes 

 before the end. Anjum passed the ball to Surin inside the 

 D. Surin turned around in a flash to deliver a firing shot 

 into the net.

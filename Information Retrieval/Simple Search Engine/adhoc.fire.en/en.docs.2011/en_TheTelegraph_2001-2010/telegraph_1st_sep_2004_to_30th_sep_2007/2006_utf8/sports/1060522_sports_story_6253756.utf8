The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We will win World Cup, declares Eriksson

 JAMES MOSSOP 

 Eriksson is displaying a new-found 

 boldness 

 In an unprecedented show In an 

 unprecedented show of rousing World Cup confidence England 

 manager Sven-Goran Eriksson has an nounced: We will 

 win it.

 Not since Sir Alf Ramsey used 

 those words ahead of the 1966 World Cup has any of Erikssons 

 predecessors been remotely as bold. 

 Indeed, the Swede, until answering 

 my question last Thursday, has been a complete fence-sitter. 

 But he could not resist a response when asked if he could 

 be as positive as Sir Alf was before leading England to 

 triumph all those years ago. 

 I think we will win it, 

 of course, he said. But you know that you have 

 huge opponents as well. We need no more injuries, a little 

 bit of luck and good referees. It says everything about 

 how difficult it is to win the World Cup that we have to 

 go back so far. 

 Everything must be in place. 

 Everything must be almost perfect if you should have a chance 

 to do it. You know it is seven games. The expectation is 

 not a burden it is motivation.

 Some people laughed when Ramsey 

 made his prediction and he faced more taunting when the 

 tournament opened with a miserable, goalless draw against 

 Uruguay. 

 But with a defence that never 

 changed and variations on a wingless wonders 

 theme, football came home with the Jules Rimet Trophy. 

 As the England players trained, 

 relaxed and played golf close to their hotel complex on 

 the Algarve, Eriksson looked towards two important events 

 on Thursday. On that day he will field a team against Belarus 

 in a B international at Readings Madejski Stadium, 

 but even more crucially he will receive the results of a 

 second scan on Wayne Rooneys broken metatarsal. It 

 may determine Rooneys participation in Germany. 

 I have spoken to him and 

 we are agreed that Wayne will remain in Manchester doing 

 everything possible so that when he is football fit he will 

 come to us, he said. He has to be 100 per cent? 

 The club will make the decision because he belongs to them. 

 So far our relationship is good and I am extremely happy. 

 If Rooney is fit no one 

 in the world can tell him not to go to the World Cup. If 

 he is fit he would be prepared to walk to Germany, 

 said Eriksson.

 What will Eriksson do after the 

 World Cup? I might try to win it again for another 

 country, he said, with another example of his new 

 boldness.

 Upset wins for Shamim, Vinod

New Delhi: Veteran golfers Mukesh Kumar and Vijay Kumar were upset by two young Delhi Golf Club boys at the SRF All India Matchplay Championship here on Friday. 

The tournament, being played at the par-72 Delhi Golf Club, witnessed Shamim Khan upset top seed Mukesh two-up, and Vinod Kumar pulled the rug from under the feet of second seed Vijay by an identical scoreline. 

Mukesh perhaps had a premonition of things to come on Thursday itself. 

Though I am the top seed, Shamim will start off as favourite tomorrow, said the Tour money list leader. (PTI)

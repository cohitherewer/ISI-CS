 Deep rues lapses in fielding

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bengal might have managed just two wickets on Sunday, but Deep Dasgupta stood by his bowlers. I think we did well under the circumstances The pacers and spinners bowled well, the Bengal captain said. 

He did not wish to get into the debate over the nature of the wicket. The bottomline remains that whatever the nature of the pitch, we have to get the runs and wickets. Weve played matches where the outcome has been decided in three days. No one says anything about such tracks Youve got to standardise wickets all over the country. 

Deep is positive about the final day. The strategy remains the same weve got to attack. The first session is going to be important. There is not much carry and bounce strokemaking is difficult. Well take our chances. 

He, however, rued fielding lapses and admitted that dropped chances cost us dear. At the end of the day, its part of the game, he, though, added. 

Double centurion Manoj Tewari dedicated his innings to teammates, family and well wishers. 

Mumbais Bhavin Thakkar, batting on 108, believes the innings has been a test of his patience and temperament.

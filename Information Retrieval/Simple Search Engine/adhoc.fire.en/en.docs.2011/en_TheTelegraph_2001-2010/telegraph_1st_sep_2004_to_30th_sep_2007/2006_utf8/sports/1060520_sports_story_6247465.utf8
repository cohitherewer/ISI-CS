 Im preparing to the best of my ability, says Sachin

 Sachin Tendulkar addressing a press conference in Chennai on Friday 

Chennai: Sachin Tendulkar on Friday expressed satisfaction at the progress in his fitness programme but refrained from commenting whether he would be able to play the Test series against the West Indies next month. 

The 33-year-old batsman said it was not possible to put a time frame for recovering from such injuries, and his availability for the Test series would be known only after he undergoes the fitness test on Tuesday. 

There is no time frame as such. It is a matter of strength levels. When you strengthen you got to have time for recovery for the muscles to relax and get time for another session. I am working on it, Sachin told a press conference here. 

When asked specifically whether he was ready to make the trip to the West Indies for the four match Test series, the batsman avoided a direct reply and said his fitness test in Mumbai would provide the answer. 

I am preparing to the best of my ability and the trainer and physio are here with me. We are working two sessions a day. 

But I still have to undergo a fitness test in Mumbai on Tuesday. After that I will be able to let you know whether it (going to the West Indies) is happening or not. Before that, to give my judgement, is not the right thing to do, said Sachin. 

A discussion with Dr Andrew Wallace would help him take the final decision. 

Whether I am going or not going (to the West Indies), I will still meet him and figure out because this programme was decided much earlier when I was operated on in March, Test crickets highest century-maker said. 

But Sachin is keen to return to the game as soon as possible. At this moment the goal is to get fit as early as possible. That is what I was targeting for so many days. That remains my target and goal.

 Performance matters, not age: Ponting

Sydney: Australias cricketers have scoffed at suggestions that their ageing team is too old to win back the Ashes. 

Australias likely line-up will be the oldest in almost 80 years with an average age of about 33, compared to an England side that will average around 27. 

At 37, Shane Warne will be the oldest player in the team but more than half the side for the first Test in Brisbane will be at least 35, including Glenn McGrath (36), Justin Langer (36), Matthew Hayden (35), Damien Martyn (35) and Adam Gilchrist and (35). 

Ponting is one of the youngest players in the team at 31, but insists age is irrelevant. 

Its dictated by performances. It doesnt really matter about your age, Ponting said at the official Ashes launch in Sydney. 

Its spoken about a lot, the age of the side, but those guys keep performing. Look at Warnie, McGrath and Hayden. Theyre our best performers. 

Warne also scoffed at the idea his teams age was a problem, saying he was bowling as well, if not better, than at any stage in his career. 

The leg-spinner was Australias leading wicket taker in the last Ashes series with 40 scalps and needs just 15 more to become the first player to claim 700 Test victims. 

Im probably fitter now than when I started, he said. 

I am bowling a few deliveries better but there are no mysteries. We know how theyre going to bat, they know how Im going to bowl, its a matter of execution and who does the best on the day. 

Australia are favourites to regain the Ashes after Englands form slipped since the last Ashes but Warne said he was still expecting a close series. The Ashes always brings out the best in both teams, no matter how poor one of the sides are playing, Warne said. 

At the moment, England arent playing as well as they would like but at the end of the day its all about how they play during this series. 

Theyve got some match-winners there and Im sure theyll be looking to entertain and play well. 

Meanwhile, Australian great Richie Benaud reiterated that England are capable of defending the Ashes. 

Benaud feels that in Englands Ashes campaign, the onus will be on the pace attack, which has the firepower to rattle the Australians. Englands pace bowling is the key to the series, he was quoted as saying by a paper.

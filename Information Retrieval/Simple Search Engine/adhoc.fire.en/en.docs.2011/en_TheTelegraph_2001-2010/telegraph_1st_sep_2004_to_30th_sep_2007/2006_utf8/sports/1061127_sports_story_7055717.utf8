The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Biswajit a closed chapter for Bagan

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Biswajit

New Delhi: Mohun Bagan, it seems, is a complete divided house at the moment. While a section of the team members are still having a lot of sympathy for the outgoing coach Biswajit Bhattacharya, powerful club officials have made it clear that a new coach would be named in a few days time. 

On Sunday, although the club secretary Anjan Mitra refrained from saying much on the subject, the accountant of the club, Debasish Dutta called the Bhattacharya issue a closed chapter. 

There is not much to say on the coachs resignation, said Dutta before leaving for Calcutta. A new coach is likely to be selected in a few days and we hope to start the practice, may be on Wednesday, he said. Dutta and Mitra both refused to say who would be Mohun Bagans next coach. 

Club sources said that Bhattacharya wont be asked to reconsider his decision. The senior club official Sunday morning had a brief meeting with the coach. All they requested Bhattacharya was not to indulge in mud slinging and part ways in an amicable manner. 

The conduct of some of the footballers, especially, the Brazilian lot has also come under scanner. Skipper Jose Ramirez Barreto is believed to have not exchanged a word with Bhattacharya after the match and left for Calcutta by air on Sunday morning along with his Brazilian colleague Eduardo. It infuriated Ndem, who too, demanded an air travel and got it in the bargain. 

The rest of the footballers, who have taken a train on Sunday evening for Calcutta, felt that there is too much of Brazilian interference in the team. The Brazilian physio Robson, they alleged, are calling the shots and even trying to pose himself as the assistant coach. Bhattacharya, too, did not travel with the team by train and left on his own by the evening flight. 

Club secretary Mitra said the team practice will start on Wednesday even if they fail to get a coach by then. We also may not play in the IFA Shield unless the IFA does the grouping by draw of lots.

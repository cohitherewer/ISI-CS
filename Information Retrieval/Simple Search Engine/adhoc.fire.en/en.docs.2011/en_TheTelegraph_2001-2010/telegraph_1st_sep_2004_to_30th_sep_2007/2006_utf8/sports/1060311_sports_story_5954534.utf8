 Ever-Ready lose 0-1

Jamshedpur: Punjab Police got the better of Calcuttas Ever-Ready in the ONGC Cup second division National Football League (NFL) encounter at the J. R. D. Tata Sport Complex on Friday through a solitary second half goal. 

Ever-Ready dominated the first half and came close to scoring, but the alert Paramjit Singh foiled their all attempts at the goal. Though the first half went barren, Punjab Police drew the first blood in the second half as substitute Pardeep Singh, who replaced forward Parminder Singh, scored the all important goal. 

In another match, State Bank of Travancore came from behind to draw 2-2 with Delhis Simla Young. 

Ogbeide Aninawaon Austin (1) and D.J. Kabui (80) scored for the Delhi outfit while Mohammed Rafi (29) and Asif Saheer (83) equalised for SBT.

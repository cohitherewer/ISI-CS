London: Jose Mourinho said Father Christmas must be a Chelsea fan after his side grabbed a last-gasp 3-2 win at Wigan Athletic on Saturday. 

The champions looked to have blown a 2-0 lead when two-goal Emile Heskey deservedly put Wigan back on level terms at the JJB Stadium, only for Arjen Robben to conjure a stoppage-time winner with his first goal of the season. 

The victory keeps Chelsea breathing down the necks of Premier League leaders Manchester United, who ran out 3-0 winners at Aston Villa in an earlier match, thanks to two goals from an inspired Cristiano Ronaldo and a memorable volley from Paul Scholes, as reported in Sundays Late City edition. 

Going into the hectic holiday fixtures, Chelsea trail United by two points. United have 47 points and no team with at least that many at the halfway stage has failed to win the title. 

Im not proud of them (the players), manager Mourinho said. Father Christmas must wear blue because we didnt deserve to win. 

We were in complete control but with 15 minutes to go in the first half I could smell it (Wigans comeback)...passing the ball bad, losing position, losing balance, conceding a goal in the last second of the first half.

Wigan had a brilliant attitude, added Mourinho, who said his team were not the same without captain John Terry (back injury). 

Chelsea were cruising after Robben put in Frank Lampard for the opener and Salomon Kalou headed the second. Heskey then restored parity as the champions threatened to implode. 

Alex Ferguson could not have been more content, even if Chelseas late winner would have taken the gloss off his evening. It was a fantastic performance against a very good Villa team, Ferguson said after his side made amends for last weeks 0-1 defeat by West Ham United. 

Liverpool remained a distant third at the halfway stage, 13 points behind United after Craig Bellamy and Xabi Alonso sealed a 2-0 home win over bottom club Watford. 

Arsenal stayed in the last Champions League qualifying spot with a 6-2 thrashing of free-falling Blackburn Rovers. 

Meanwhile in Italy, Brazilian striker Adriano scored his first goal in more than nine months as leaders Inter Milan equalled the Serie A record of 11 straight wins with a 2-1 victory over Atalanta on Saturday. 

Unbeaten Inter go into the Christmas break with a seven-point lead over AS Roma, who beat Cagliari 2-0 with goals from Brazilians Rodrigo Taddei and Mancini. 

Inters run of victories equals AS Romas Serie A record which was set last season. 

On a good day for Brazilians, Kaka and Ricardo Oliveira were on target for AC Milan in their 3-0 win at Udinese Italy striker Alberto Gilardino also finding the target. 

Bottom club Ascoli finally got their first win of the season with a 3-0 win over Chievo while Lazio, forced to play with 10 men for most of the game, following the dismissal of Sebastiano Siviglia in the 14th minute, enjoyed an impressive 3-1 win at Parma. 

Catania moved up to fourth after a hat-trick from Gionatha Spinesi helped them to a 4-2 win over Sampdoria. 

At the San Siro, Inter suffered an early setback when Atalanta playmaker Cristiano Doni fired the visitors in front with a superb strike with the outside of his foot in the 16th minute. 

Inter coach Roberto Mancini brought on Portuguese winger Luis Figo after the break and the former Real Madrid player turned the game around. 

Figo provided the cross, which Adriano met with a diving header for his first goal in Serie A since March 11.

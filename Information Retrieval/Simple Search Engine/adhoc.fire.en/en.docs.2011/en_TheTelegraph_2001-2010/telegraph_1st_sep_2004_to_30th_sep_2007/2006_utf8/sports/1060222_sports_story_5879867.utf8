 Bangla recall Omar, Hossain

Bogra: Bangladesh recalled regular opener Javed Omar and fast bowler Nazmul Hossain for the second one-day International against Sri Lanka, chief selector Faruq Ahmed said on Tuesday while announcing a 12-member squad. 

Omar replaces recently-retired Khaled Mahmud, former captain whose 36 was the top score for Bangladesh in their 5-wicket loss in the first game on Monday. 

Hossain replaces Abdur Razzak, the Super Sub in Mondays match.

 I would have picked Sourav: Kirmani

Nagpur: Former selection committee chairman Syed Kirmani said on Saturday that Sourav Ganguly deserved a better treatment and was still capable of making runs for the national side. He felt the time had still not come to write off the former India captain. 

Had I been chairman of national selection committee, I would have picked him for the side, Kirmani said. 

The former India stumper, who was in the city on a promotional campaign, also said Sachin Tendulkar would be back among runs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Nehra hoping to get rhythm back

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Guwahati: Ashish Nehra was confidence personified after his three-wicket haul at the Nehru Stadium here Tuesday. 

I will be back... I am 100 per cent confident of returning to the Indian team.... Everybody knows how good a bowler I am, Nehra told The Telegraph. 

He, however, was not putting any deadline. That is up to the selectors and how the other bowlers perform. All I am concentrating now is on giving my best in every match and getting back my rhythm. I am working hard, he said. 

Nehra, who is said to break down if the workload increases, asserted he was fit. 

To justify his point, he said it was not only the six wickets he has got in the two Duleep matches he has played this season but bowling over 30 overs in each innings on wickets not conducive to fast bowling. 

The wicket here is flat as was the one in Jamshedpur. Still, the long spell has been good practice for me. It will help me get into rhythm. That is what the selectors are also looking at. Mind you, I was not dropped from the team but injured. I figured in the one-dayers the Challenger Trophy after a year, Nehra added. 

Nehra had taken the wicket of former India opener Shiv Sundar Das, the talented Abhishek Jhunjunwala and Sourashis Lahiri in the only innings he has bowled here. 

He will not miss the chance to impress the selectors in the final. It is good for me and lot of the talented youngsters in the side to perform before the national selectors. Like me, everyone is looking forward to the match. Its a big opportunity. 

Meanwhile, the North side will leave for Calcutta on Thursday.

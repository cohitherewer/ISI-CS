Shanghai: World No. 1 Roger Federer was forced to dig deep to keep his perfect record in Masters Cup round robin matches intact with a 4-6, 7-6, 6-4 win over a fired-up Andy Roddick on Tuesday. 

American Roddick hassled and hustled Federer out of his comfort zone to win the first set and then had three match points in a thrilling tiebreak in the second, which the Swiss came back from 4-1 down to win 10-8. 

In doubles, Leander Paes and Martin Damms suffered their second straight loss. The Indo-Czech pair went down fighting 2-6, 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (5-7) to Americas Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, in their second Red group match. 

The US open champions had earlier lost 6-7 (6-8), 6-4, 3-6 to Australian Paul Hanley and Zimbabwes Kevin Ullyett on Sunday. 

Paes and Damm will now have to defeat Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram of Israel and rely on results from other matches of the third and final round on Thursday to go through to the semi-finals of the year-end championships. 

Federer thus put himself in the driving seat to qualify for the semi-finals at the year-ending championship with his second Red group victory when he sent an ace down the centre of the court after just under two and a half hours. 

Federer won the Masters Cup in 2003 and 2004, was losing finalist last year and has still not lost in 14 group matches at the tournament. 

Roddick, who drops to 1-1 for the tournament, has now lost to Federer in eight successive matches including the US Open final and won just one of 13 career matches against the dominant player in mens tennis this year. 

I put myself in a position to win tonight, its tough right now... I felt like I was unlucky not to win that one, Roddick said. 

The 24-year-old American strode on to the court with a transparent sense of purpose and was soon dashing to the net behind his big serves in an attempt to unsettle Federers cool. 

Sometimes it worked and sometimes it just opened Roddick up to the nine-time Grand Slam winners deadly accurate passing shots, which were particularly devastating from the backhand. 

The American, watched by his new coach Jimmy Connors, succeeded enough to grab the first break of the match in game three when Federer failed in a hawk-eye appeal against a second serve called wide. 

He had more break points in game five and served up four straight bombs to save his own serve in the next game, winning the set after saving another break point in game 10. 

Roddick was forced to save three set points at 5-4 down in the second set but grabbed three of his own in the tiebreak, which Federer saved before levelling the match when the American charged the net only to fluff his volley. 

Another backhand winner gave Federer a break early in the third set and, after Roddick lost despite forcing three deuces in the next game, the Swiss held serve with some ease and converted his second match point. 

In doubles, Hanley and Ullyett have more or less clinched one of the two last-four berths from the group with their 6-4, 6-4 win over Erlich and Ram Tuesday. 

They need to win a set against the Bryans to seal their last-four spot. The Bryans, who had lost to the Israeli pair, would book the other spot if they win without dropping a set. 

Erlich and Ram also have a chance if they win against Paes and Damm without dropping a set.

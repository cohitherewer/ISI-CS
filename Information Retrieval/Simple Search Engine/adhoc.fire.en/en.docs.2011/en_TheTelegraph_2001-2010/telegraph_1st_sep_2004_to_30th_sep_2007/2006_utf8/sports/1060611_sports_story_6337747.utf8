 AIFF Cup plans elicit mixed reactions

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: A day before his selection as Indias chief coach, Bob Houghton had said his first aim would be to take India within 100 in the Fifa rankings. India are currently ranked 117th in the Fifa classifications. 

On Friday evening, the All India Football Federation president, Priyaranjan Das Munshi, stretched it further while launching Indias World Cup project 2010-14 amidst fanfare. 

With a galaxy of former footballers, ministers and other dignitaries present, the AIFF chief did not reveal the actual blueprint of his Mission World Cup, but said the project would focus on providing training, administrative support to the players so that India could qualify for the World Cup. 

While Das Munshi said it is time to work together to achieve Indias World Cup dreams in 2010, most of the former footballers applauded and felt Indian football needed this boost to do well on the world stage.

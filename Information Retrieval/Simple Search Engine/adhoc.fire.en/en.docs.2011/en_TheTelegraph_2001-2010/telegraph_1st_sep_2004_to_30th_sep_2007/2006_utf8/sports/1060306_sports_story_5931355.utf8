 Sporting rout Fransa 3-0

Panaji: Dudu Omagbemi brace guided Sporting Clube de Goa to a comfortable 3-0 win over Fransa Pax in the 10th ONGC National Football League (NFL) at Duler Ground Mapusa here on Sunday. 

Sporting dominated the major part of the game. They surged ahead in the 51st minute through Dudu who headed in after Fransas goalkeeper Virender Singh hesitated to clear the ball off a pass from Bibiano Fernandes. 

Dudu again scored five minutes later through a penalty after defender Bello Rasaq brought down striker Edeh Chidi inside the box. 

Bibiano hammered the last nail in Fransas coffin five minutes before the end. (PTI)

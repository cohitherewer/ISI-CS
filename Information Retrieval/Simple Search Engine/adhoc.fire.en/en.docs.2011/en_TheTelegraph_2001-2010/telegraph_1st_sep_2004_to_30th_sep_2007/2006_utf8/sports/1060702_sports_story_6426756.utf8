London: Rafael Nadal spared no room for sentiment on Saturday when he ended Andre Agassis Wimbledon career with a display of ruthless brilliance on the Centre Court. 

The double French Open champion dispatched Agassi 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the third round, leaving the 36-year-old Las Vegan to wave farewell to the event he won in 1992 with a sad smile and a lump in his throat. 

Its been a lot of incredible years, Ill never be able to repay you for how you embraced me, Agassi said after blowing kisses to all four sides of an emotional Centre Court. 

Saying goodbye means as much as winning. 

The American, one of only five men to have won all four Grand Slam events in his career, will retire from tennis after the US Open which starts on August 28 and on Saturday he tried everything to prolong his final visit to the All England Club. 

Time has caught up with Agassi, though, and he could not contain the 20-year-old Nadals fulminating groundstrokes on the court where he won the first of his eight Grand Slam titles. 

In scorching conditions more typical of his native Mallorca than England, the Spaniard produced an astonishing forehand pass and an ace to snatch the first set tiebreak after Agassi had led it 5-2. 

From that point onwards Nadal dominated in a display that proved the claycourter was a genuine contender for the grasscourt Grand Slam. 

Its unbelievable for me to play the last match with Andre, one of the best players in history, said second seed Nadal. Today I played my best match on grass so I am very happy. 

Australian Lleyton Hewitt, the 2002 champion, swept through to the last 16 with a 6-1, 6-4, 6-4 defeat of Belgian Olivier Rochus. 

Roddick is the last American left in the mens singles after defeats for Agassi and Mardy Fish, who retired from his match against Georgias Irakli Labadze due to a stomach upset after losing the first set 6-2. 

Labadze, the first Georgian to reach the fourth round since Alex Metreveli in 1976, faces Nadal next. 

Russian seventh seed Elena Dementieva equalled her best Wimbledon performance by reaching Round IV with a 7-5, 6-3 win over compatriot Elena Likhovtseva. 

Another Russian, Anastasia Myskina, also advanced to the last 16 but Dinara Safina bowed out. 

Indias Leander Paes and partner Martin Damm of the Czech Republic had a smooth sailing and reached the pre-quarter finals of the mens doubles on Saturday. 

The Indo-Czech pair defeated Jan Hernych and David Skoch of the Czech Republic 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 in the second round. 

However, it was a day of mixed luck for the Indian colts with Sanam Singh advancing to the second round and Sanaa Bhambri bowing out with a first round defeat. 

Sanam, the eighth seed, ousted Venezuelan Roberto Maytin 6-1, 6-2 in the boys singles, while Sanaa went down with an identical scoreline to Yung-Jan Chan of Chinese Taipei in the girls singles.

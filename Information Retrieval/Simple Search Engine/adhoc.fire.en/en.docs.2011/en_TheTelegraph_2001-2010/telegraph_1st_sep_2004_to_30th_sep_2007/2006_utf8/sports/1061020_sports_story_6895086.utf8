 Berdych topples Roddick

 - Ginepri knocks out Robredo 

 Rafael Nadal serves to Mardy Fish in Madrid. Nadal won 6-4, 6-2 

Madrid: Sixth seed Andy Roddick and world No. 8 Tommy Robredo suffered straight-set defeats in the third round of the Madrid Masters on Thursday. 

Czech Tomas Berdych toppled Roddick 7-6, 6-3 with the American ending the match complaining of pain in his left ankle, while the unseeded Robby Ginepri beat Spains Robredo 6-3, 7-6. 

There was nothing to separate Berdych and Roddick in the first set as they held firm on their serves and it was no surprise when it went to a tie-break. But Roddick was the first to crack and the 21-year-old Czech runner-up at the Mumbai meet two weeks ago clinched it 9-7. 

The American received treatment on his left ankle at 2-3 down in the second set and Berdych produced a sensational running pass to break serve in the next game before easing his way to victory in the first meeting between the pair. 

American Ginepri, who lost to Nadal in the semis last year, put Robredo under early pressure, breaking in the second game and then holding his serve with ease to take the first set 6-3. 

He kept Robredo on the back foot in the second to take a 5-4 lead, but the seventh seed refused to fold and broke back to love when Ginepri was serving for the match. The set went to a tie-break and it was Ginepri who won through 7-3. 

On Wednesday night, world No. 2 and second seed Rafael Nadal opened the defence of his title with a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 win over American qualifier Mardy Fish. 

World No. 3 Ivan Ljubicic was defeated 4-6, 6-3, 3-6 by Britains Andy Murray. 

Eighth seed James Blake succumbed 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 to Belgian Kristof Vliegen after an exciting third-set tie-break 6-4 3-6 7-6. 

The American has won five titles this year and came into the tie having won back-to-back tournaments in Bangkok and Stockholm. 

Obviously my preparation wasnt great after making the final in Stockholm, said Blake. Its a fine line between having lots of confidence and being here longer to get used to the courts and the altitude. 

But Im not making excuses and Vliegen played a great game. I dont think I could have played the game any differently tactically. 

Fifth seed Nikolay Davydenko went down 4-6, 7-6, 3-6 to Swede Joachim Johansson, while ninth seed Marcos Baghdatis fell 4-6, 3-6 to Russian Marat Safin, the 2004 champion.

 Sometimes we miss Sourav

 - Indian vice-captain picks Dhoni as next superstar 

 Sehwag 

New Delhi: Sourav Ganguly, in his days as Indias captain, nurtured a bunch of budding cricketers. Virender Sehwag, being one of them, voiced his gratitude to the former captain on Sunday and said that the team missed him. 

He supported me a lot. He backed Yuvraj (Singh), Harbhajan (Singh), Ashish (Nehra), Ajit Agarkar, Mohammed Kaif, feels Sehwag. Team India vice-captain also nods in full agreement when asked if Sourav had shaped the careers of all of them. 

He does not know what has happened between Sourav and Greg Chappell, Sehwag maintained, adding simply that both are aggressive. 

The former captains cricketing fate is in the hands of the selectors and the BCCI, Sehwag acknowledges, but says that sometimes we miss Sourav. 

Sehwag refuses to believe that Souravs international career is over. He is still playing first class cricket and hopefully he will get a chance again. It will be good if he gets back because he has got 10,000 one-day runs, 5,000 Test runs and 22 ODI hundreds. Most of the time India won when he got a hundred. He is a fantastic player, the vice-captain said. 

[Sehwag, it may be recalled, described the Sourav issue as a thing of past on the eve of the sixth ODI against England in Jamshedpur on April 11. However, Sehwag backtracked the very next day, saying that he was referring to the past controversy over Sourav.] 

His favourite captain was Australias Steve Waugh followed by Sourav, Sehwag said emphasising that a skippers mettle was tested in tough situations. Otherwise, everybody is a good captain if the going is good, he said. 

Rahul Dravid is a very good thinker, according to Sehwag. May be, hopefully, Dravid will be the best captain by the end of his career, he said. 

How can Chappell be compared to John Wright? 

Wright, Sehwag replies, was a good but not a great player while Chappell was a great player with great knowledge of the game. 

Sehwag also singles out Mahendra Singh Dhoni as the next superstar. He is handling pressure very well and in tough situations he adjusts his game very quickly. (PTI)

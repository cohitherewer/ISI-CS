The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav: I wont react till Ive spoken to the CM

 - Former India captain caught in build-up to CAB elections 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Calcutta: When Sourav Ganguly left for Northampton (via Dubai and London) last Friday, he didnt anticipate getting caught in the build-up to the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) elections within 24 hours of reporting at Northamptonshire. 

Indeed, while Northants coach Kepler Wessels expects the former Team India captain to provide the spark that has been missing in the Countys campaign this season, West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ignited one here. 

Much more than a spark, actually. 

First, he publicly announced (something doing the rounds in whispers) that he wanted Jagmohan Dalmiyas innings as CAB president to end. In other words, the former International Cricket Council and Board of Control for Cricket in India chief should step aside for the citys commissioner of police, Prasun Mukherjee. 

Second, that hed asked Sourav to take responsibility. He didnt elaborate ? intentionally, perhaps. 

Has the CM said that? Well, Im thousands of miles away and wont react till Ive spoken to Buddhadebbabu? Its not a simple matter, was how Sourav responded, when The Telegraph contacted him in a Northampton hotel on Monday afternoon. 

Sourav has checked into a hotel as the County-provided flat wont be ready for possession till after his debut match, a four-day affair in Worcester beginning Wednesday. 

A car (Volkswagen), however, has already been handed over to him. 

Sourav also didnt react to Mukherjees claim (on Sunday) that he had his support. I dont have anything to say on that either? As Ive said, Im first going to talk to the CM, whom I respect enormously. 

Like others still playing the sport, Sourav currently has nothing to do with the CAB. Out of choice, he isnt even the Bengal captain. 

 Its not clear what Bhattacharjee wants him to do, but Sourav (according to those closest to him) remains convinced hes the only one who hasnt used him. 

Therefore, hes expected to go along with anything proposed by the CM. 

Footnote: Having announced his candidature for the elections, usually scheduled in the last week of July, Mukherjee is concentrating on his job. I dont intend saying anything more, but I do know cricket is an unpredictable sport! he quipped late on Monday.

 Quick Takes

 Argentine get-together

 Buenos Aires: Argentina 

 have called up 16 players largely regarded as certainties 

 in their World Cup squad for a two-day get-together in Madrid 

 early next week.

 The 16 are all with European clubs, 

 except for goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri, who will travel 

 to Madrid on Sunday after playing for Boca Juniors in the 

 Argentine league.

 There is one surprise in AS Roma 

 defender Leandro Cufre, who won the second of his two caps 

 in March 2005, while Lionel Scaloni, on loan at West Ham 

 United, has also been merely a fringe player.

 Listed players

 Goalkeepers: Roberto Abbondanzieri (Boca 

 Juniors), Leonardo Franco (Atletico Madrid); Defenders: 

 Nicolas Burdisso (Inter Milan), Gabriel Milito (Real 

 Zaragoza), Juan Pablo Sorin (Villarreal), Fabricio Coloccini 

 (Deportivo Coruna), Leandro Cufre (AS Roma), Roberto Ayala 

 (Valencia), Gabriel Heinze (Manchester United), Lionel Scaloni 

 (West Ham United); Midfielders: Maximiliano Rodriguez 

 (Atletico Madrid), Esteban Cambiasso (Inter Milan), Luis 

 Gonzalez (Porto), Juan Roman Riquelme (Villarreal); Forwards: 

 Lionel Messi (Barcelona), Hernan Crespo (Chelsea). 

 No surprises

 Belgrade: Serbia and Montenegro 

 manager Ilija Petkovic said there would be no new names 

 in his 23-man World Cup squad to be announced on May 15, 

 the B 92 website reported on Saturday. There will 

 be very few surprises, if any. The group of players who 

 qualified for Germany have earned their places in the squad 

 and I think they ought to be rewarded for their efforts, 

 he said. 

 Kehl in doubt

 Frankfurt: Sebastian Kehls 

 place in Germanys World Cup squad could be in doubt 

 after the midfielder suffered an ankle injury on Saturday. 

 It could be a ligament tear, Dortmund Sporting 

 director Michael Zorc said.

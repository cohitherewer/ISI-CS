St Johns: Fast bowler Jerome Taylor rocked Zimbabwe with a four-wicket haul to bowl the West Indies to an emphatic victory in the second ODI on Sunday. 

The home side won by 98 runs to take a 2-0 lead in the seven-match series. 

The West Indies were restricted to 242 for nine after winning the toss, but Taylor decided the match in a telling new-ball burst that left Zimbabwe reeling on 11 for three. 

Zimbabwe never recovered, and they were dismissed for 144 in 46.2 overs despite a second successive half-century from Justice Chibhabha. 

Bowling with pace and accuracy, Taylor, who took four for 24, had Piet Rinke caught by Dwayne Bravo at point for six in the fourth over. 

Taylor then bowled Terrence Duffin for one and Brendan Taylor for nought with successive balls at the end of the sixth over. 

Lara, who batted at No. 6 for the second successive match, took guard in the 38th over and faced just nine balls before he fell to a catch by Mahwire at square-leg. 

Laras decision to drop down the order has been the topic of some debate, but he indicated it was part of his sides tactics to expose some of the players in preparation for the upcoming series against India next month. 

The top four or five batsmen should dominate the batting in these 50-over games, said Lara. 

If this takes place, the lower-order batsmen will not get a knock, so I am trying to get some of the guys lower down the order to get a knock. 

The Windies captain has demanded his batsmen rediscover their killer instincts in the remaining five one-dayers against Zimbabwe. 

We lost too many wickets on Saturday chasing 152, and on Sunday, we were almost bowled out, said Lara.

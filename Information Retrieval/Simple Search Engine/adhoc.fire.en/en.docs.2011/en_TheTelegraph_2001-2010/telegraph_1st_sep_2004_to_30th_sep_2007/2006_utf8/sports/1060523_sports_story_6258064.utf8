 Ponting plots Englands downfall

Melbourne: The first Ashes Test is still more than six months away but Australian captain Ricky Ponting is already plotting to snatch the famous urn back from England. 

Ponting said his side had spotted out the weak links in the line-up and sorted them out. 

Last summer, our senior players werent at their best, but we sat down and had a good look at it and found out where the weak links were, and I think weve sorted that out, Ponting was quoted as saying in the media Monday. 

I know the guys are relaxing away from cricket at the moment but weve had a changeover in personnel, were playing really well and were all pretty keen looking forward to the Ashes, he said. 

The anticipation will be great, and I understand theyve sold loads of tickets for the Boxing Day clash. There will be bigger grounds this year, so hopefully the excitement will be even greater. (PTI)

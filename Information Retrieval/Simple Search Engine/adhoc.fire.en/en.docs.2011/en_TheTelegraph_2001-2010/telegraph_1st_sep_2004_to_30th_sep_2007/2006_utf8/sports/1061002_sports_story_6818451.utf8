 PCB to accept Hair standing again

London: Pakistan would accept an ICC decision allowing controversial Australian umpire Darrell Hair to stand again in international matches, PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan said on Sunday. The PCB had earlier asked the ICC to omit Hair from any future games involving Pakistan. 

We would not oppose that (him standing in international matches) ourselves. I wouldnt say that I am happy to see him (do so) but I would say that I have no objection to him umpiring matches that the ICC feels that he is secure. That is something to be decided later, Shaharyar said, adding that he would continue to press for a probe into the Hairs conduct. 

However, he said that they were not going to protest the forfeit or Inzamams ban. What transpired was that it was a technical blunder that we did not come to the field. Actually we had decided to stage a five minute protest and now we would investigate who was responsible for the fiasco. 

Meanwhile, according to media reports, the PCB could be asked to cough up a whopping 800,000 as compensation following The Oval Test forfeiture. (Agencies)

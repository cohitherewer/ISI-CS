 Kashyap wins, Saina out

New Delhi: Twenty-year-old P. Kashyap pulled off a major upset, drubbing world No. 19 Przemyslaw Wacha of Poland to storm into the mens singles pre-quarter finals at the Hong Kong Open Badminton Championships on Wednesday. 

However, Indias euphoria was dampened a bit by Saina Nehwals defeat to world No. 1 Ning Zhang of China. 

Kashyap is now the only Indian in fray in the six-star event as others, including Chetan Anand, Anand Pawar and Ajay Jayaram failed to go past the second round. 

Kashyap came up with a sparkling performance against Wacha as he overcame a one game deficit to win 17-21, 22-20, 21-13. The Hyderabad boy set up a clash with veteran Taufiq Hidayat of Indonesia. 

Saina gave a good fight to Zhang but the Chinese top-seed handled the crucial points well to pocket the match 21-11, 21-16. 

Pawar lost to Chong Wei Lee of Malaysia 22-20, 6-21, 11-21. Chetan Anand lost to Hwan Sung Park of Korea 21-12, 21-9.

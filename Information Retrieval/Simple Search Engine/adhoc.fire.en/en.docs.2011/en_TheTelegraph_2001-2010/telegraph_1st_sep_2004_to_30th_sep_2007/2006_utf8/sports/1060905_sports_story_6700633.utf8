The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Prasanta oozes confidence

 A STAFF REPORTER

 SANTOSH TROPHY

 Calcutta: Prasanta Banerjee 

 is not losing hope. The Bengal coach, despite the absence 

 of first-choice players from the Big Three clubs, is confident 

 of crossing the first hurdle in the Santosh Trophy with 

 second rung members.

 I am not the one who will 

 run away just because the best are not available. The Big 

 Three are going to send their reserve players to the camp. 

 Obviously they will not be in the same condition as the 

 regulars. The fitter players will get prominence even if 

 they are from smaller clubs, Prasanta told The 

 Telegraph on Monday.

 I am going to judge the 

 players solely by their condition. My first target will 

 be to make the second phase of the tournament. We can then 

 get eight players replaced.

 The camp has witnessed poor attendance 

 with three players turning up on the opening day. The camp 

 will resume on Wednesday after a three-day break.

 East Bengal on Monday decided 

 to release Surya Bikash Chakraborty, Debkumar Sashmal, Sovan 

 Chakraborty and Gouranga Biswas for the tournament. Mohun 

 Bagan will release Bijoy Basfore, Suman Dutta and Ayan Ghosh. 

 Mohammedan Sporting havent decided their players yet. 

 IFA secretary Subrata Dutta has 

 sounded a warning to the small clubs, saying the players 

 who do not report to the camp will be de-registered. 

 The Big Three have been 

 spared since they already have released players for the 

 national team, he explained.

 Bengal play their first match 

 on September 14.

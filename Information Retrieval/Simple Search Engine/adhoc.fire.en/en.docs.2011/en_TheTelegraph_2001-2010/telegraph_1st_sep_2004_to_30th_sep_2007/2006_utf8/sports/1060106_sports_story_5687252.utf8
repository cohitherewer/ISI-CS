 Indian security officers for Karachi Test

 - Azad and team to reach port city before match 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Lahore: Despite the assurance of foolproof security by both the federal agencies and the Sindh government, a crack team of Indian officers is going to keep vigil before and during the third and final Test in Karachi. 

The Test is to begin on January 29. Its not clear, though, whether the same arrangement will be followed for the last (No.5) ODI there ? on February 19. 

According to The Telegraphs sources, IGP Yashovardhan Azad and a couple of other officers are to reach Karachi a few days before the Test to oversee arrangements. While Azad could return home once the face-off has begun, the other officers are going to stay put. 

Azad, it may be recalled, headed the delegation which recently reviewed security arrangements across Pakistan before New Delhis formal nod for the second tour by Team India in less than two years. Hed done the same in 2003-04 as well. 

What has been planned for Karachi could seem unusual... However, despite the assurances, some (in New Delhi) still arent com,fortable... Having our own officers is bound to be reassuring, a source pointed out on Thursday. 

Incidentally, a senior Delhi police officer ? additional commissioner Ranbir Singh Krishnia ? is the security coordinator for the tour. Basically, he will be on call 24x7.

 2002: Asia shining

 The decision to stage the first 

 World Cup in Asia in South Korea and Japan was one of the 

 most profound Fifa have made. Decades of animosity between 

 the two countries had created a situation that would have 

 resulted in national shame for whichever nation lost the 

 vote to host the tournament.

 Their shared and difficult history 

 was something that even Fifa could not solve and, in July 

 1996, Fifa did the most pragmatic and sensible thing by 

 making them joint hosts. 

 This created a curious but thrilling 

 event with the two countries embracing the tournament in 

 different ways.

 It seemed the entire Korean nation 

 were swept along with the idea and that every man, woman 

 and child in every hamlet donned a red T-shirt for a month. 

 The Japanese were rather more 

 reserved but added their own special brand of individualism 

 to the occasion. Never before have so many Japanese David 

 Beckham look-alikes walked the streets of Tokyo, Sapporo 

 or Niigata.

 Did You Know?

 The first round of the 2002 World Cup Korea-Japan reflected 

 a changing football world as upsets and surprises thrilled 

 right from the start. 

 The tone of the group stage was set in the opening 

 match as African debutantes Senegal shocked the holders 

 France with an impressive 1-0 victory. Les Bleus never 

 really recovered from the loss, failing to escape Group 

 A without even mustering a goal. Though the disappointment 

 was extreme for the French, it was a wonderful match and 

 tournament for the Senegalese. The Lions of Teranga made 

 it to the second round, beating Sweden on a golden goal, 

 and then only fell to a Turkish golden goal in the quarter 

 finals. 

 Group D also saw a monstrous upset as the United States 

 opened their tournament by beating fancied Portugal 3-2. 

 The Golden Generation of Portuguese came back to beat 

 Poland, but then fell to the groups other surprise 

 package, Korea Republic, as another high-profile European 

 power went home far earlier than expected. 

 Europe got its revenge in what was termed The 

 Group of Death, where England and Sweden went through 

 at the expense of powerful Argentina and always dangerous 

 Nigeria. The most hotly anticipated match of the entire 

 opening stage was perhaps the Argentina versus England 

 rematch in Sapporo, Japan. England captain David Beckham, 

 who was sent off in the corresponding contest at France 

 98, successfully put his ghosts to rest as his penalty 

 kick was the only goal in the always fascinating confrontation 

 between the teams. Argentina, a pre-tournament favourites 

 for many, could only manage a draw in their last match 

 against the Swedes, and they joined the ranks of big-names 

 on their way home earlier than expected. 

 While the knockout rounds followed a more predictable 

 pattern than the startling group stage, co-hosts Korea 

 Republic did their best to keep the dream alive. In the 

 Round of 16, they faced illustrious Italy and claimed 

 an electrifying 2-1 victory from Ahn Jung Hwans 

 golden goal. Even more unlikely was what followed next 

 ? a penalty shootout win in the quarter final over Spain. 

 A 0-1 loss in the semi-final to Germany could not dampen 

 the incredible enthusiasm of the Korean people, who flooded 

 the streets like a sea of red during and after every match. 

 On the other hand, Turkey knocked out the Japanese in 

 the second round on their way to the semi-finals, where 

 they fell to Brazil. 

 In the end, thus, it was two familiar faces, Germany 

 and Brazil, who played for the world championship, and 

 it was the South Americans who won their unprecedented 

 fifth World Cup. Ronaldo, who suffered a famously poor 

 final four years earlier, was the hero for the Sele?ao, 

 scoring both in the 2-0 victory. He ended up with eight 

 goals in the tournament ? the most in a World Cup since 

 Gerd M?ller scored ten times at Mexico 70.

 Off-side

 Brazilian 

 captain Cafu became the first man to play in three World 

 Cup final matches. Though he was often overshadowed by the 

 flashy skills of the Three Rs ? Rivaldo, 

 Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, not to mention Roberto Carlos on 

 the opposite flank, Cafu played every minute of every match 

 for the Sele?ao, and his marauding up and down the right 

 flank was one of their biggest strengths. 

 Another 

 first was the pairing in the final. Amazingly, the World 

 Cups two most successful teams, Brazil and Germany, 

 had never met each other at the tournament, not until their 

 87th and 85th matches, respectively. 

 The 

 third-place match also featured a remarkable first, as Hakan 

 Sukurs goal for Turkey against Korea Republic came 

 after just 11 seconds ? the fastest ever scored in the finals. 

 By 

 claiming their fifth world championship at Asias first 

 finals, Brazil kept alive their extraordinary record of 

 having won the World Cup on every continent that has hosted 

 the event.

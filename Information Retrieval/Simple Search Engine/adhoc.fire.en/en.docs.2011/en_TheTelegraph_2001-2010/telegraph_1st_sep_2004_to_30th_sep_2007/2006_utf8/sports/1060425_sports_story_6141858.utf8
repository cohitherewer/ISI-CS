Madrid: Barcelona were denied the chance of wrapping up the Spanish title on Sunday when a stunning quick-fire hattrick from David Villa gave Valencia a 3-0 win at relegation-threatened Athletic Bilbao. 

The Valencia striker grabbed the goals in the space of just four second-half minutes to hit one of the quickest hattricks ever recorded in the Primera Liga and take his total for the season to 22. 

Barcelonas hopes of bringing a rapid conclusion to the title race were dealt a further blow when their late game at Sevilla was called off because of a water-logged pitch after a heavy downpour at the Sanchez Pizjuan. 

Real Madrid snatched a barely deserved 2-1 win over basement side Malaga after defender Sergio Ramos scored a last-minute header at the Bernabeu. 

Barcelona, who have a game in hand and five left to play, lead the standings with 73 points, Valencia follow eight behind on 65, while Real have 63. 

Osasuna are a point further back on 62 after an injury-time strike from French midfielder Ludovic Delporte gave the Navarrans at 1-0 win at Real Mallorca. Real are away at Osasuna next week, while Barcelona host relegation-threatened Cadiz at the Nou Camp. 

Malaga were left staring relegation in the face after their defeat at the Bernabeu and are now eight points adrift of Cadiz at the bottom of the table. The Andalucians, who drew 1-1 at home to Deportivo Coruna, are just a point behind Alaves, while their are six other teams within five points of the relegation zone. 

Villa did not open the scoring against Bilbao until eight minutes from time when he fired past keeper Inaki Lafuente after racing on to a long pass hit from inside the Valencia half. Two minutes later he squirmed his way past a defender and Lafuente before steering home his second and moments later he completed his hattrick when he poked in at the far post after some great work by Mario Regueiro and fellow striker Mista.

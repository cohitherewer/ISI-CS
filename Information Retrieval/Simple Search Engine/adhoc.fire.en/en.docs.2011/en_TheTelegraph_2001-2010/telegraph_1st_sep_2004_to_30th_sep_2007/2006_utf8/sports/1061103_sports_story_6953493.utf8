 Davydenko up

 - Paris Masters 

Paris: Nikolay Davydenko stormed through to the quarter finals of the Paris Masters with a 6-2, 6-2 third-round win over fellow-Russian Dmitry Tursunov on Thursday. 

World No. 5 Davydenko, the fourth seed and the highest-ranked player in the indoor event after a string of no-shows, recorded his third win in as many meetings with Tursunov, seeded 15th. 

Davydenko, who has already secured a berth at the season-ending Masters Cup later this month in Shanghai, will next face Croatias Mario Ancic who thrashed Frenchman Julien Benneteau 6-3, 6-1. 

Benneteau had on Wednesday eliminated world No. 8 Fwernando Gonzalez of Chile 3-6, 6-4, 7-5. 

Defending champion Tomas Berdych, seeded eighth, also advanced easily, beating American Robby Ginepri 6-3, 6-3. 

The 21-year-old Czech won the tournament on his first appearance last year. 

German Tommy Haas, seeded 10th, kept alive his slim hopes of making the Masters Cup when he knocked out American seventh seed James Blake 6-4, 6-2.

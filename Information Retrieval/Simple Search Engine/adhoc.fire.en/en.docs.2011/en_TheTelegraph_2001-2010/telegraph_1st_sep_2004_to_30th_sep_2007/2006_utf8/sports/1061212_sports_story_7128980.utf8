 No tampering with opening slot, says Vengsarkar

 - Chief selector spells out strategy for first Test 

 Dilip Vengsarkar 

Johannesburg: Chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar promptly declared on arrival here on Monday that the opening slots would not be tampered with in the first Test against South Africa, starting here on Friday. 

Opening is key to any teams success Despite regular failures, the opening slot would not be tampered with (for the first Test), said Vengsarkar. His comments would ease creases on the foreheads of Virender Sehwag and Wasim Jaffer. 

Both Sehwag and Jaffer have been sitting ducks on this tour but the issues have not stopped with them alone as other top-order batsmen, too, have found the going tough. 

It is only bounce which is getting them into trouble, but they are experienced cricketers and should come good. It beats me why they havent still come good after a month in South Africa, remarked Vengsarkar. 

The former Indian captain arrived here from Mumbai this morning and was at the nets straightaway, speaking to physio John Gloster about Munaf Patels ankle injury and having a word with captain Rahul Dravid. He also spoke to Irfan Pathan and tried to have first-hand information about the problems he is experiencing in bowling. 

Vengsarkar, a veteran of 116 Tests, made a pertinent observation on the batsmens plight, stating India would struggle to produce good batsmen if the pitches are not good. 

Good cricketers will only be produced on good pitches, thats a fact, he said. 

Vengsarkar denied that he is on a mission to South Africa or has actually been asked by BCCI president Sharad Pawar to take stock of situation. 

I am not on a mission. Most of us have played together and are on the same wavelength. But I would be contributing in the selection of XI for the Test matches. Sometimes its important for a team to have an outside view. 

Vengsarkar had words of encouragement for Sourav Ganguly who made an instant impression on arrival with an innings of 83 in his first tour game at Potchefstroom which resulted in 96-run win for India. 

Its good that Sourav contributed in the first game itself and it would hold him in good stead. He is an experienced cricketer and we expect runs from him. 

Vengsarkar was diplomatic on the continued worry on the form of Pathan whose batting has improved but bowling has really taken a nose-dive in recent months. 

He is a good, experienced cricketer and I am sure he would soon find an answer to his problems. Things would be alright if he bowls a good spell or takes five wickets. His confidence would be back and its an important factor in cricket. 

Vengsarkar tried to downplay the worry on Indias one-day form where the team has lost 15 of the last 18 matches played. 

I am more concerned about forthcoming Test matches than about World Cup at the moment. 

But we would have eight matches to work on before the World Cup at home and it would be an important one for us, stated Vengsarkar.

Calcutta: The also-rans have been identified and dispatched. The field in the AFC Youth Championship has narrowed down to four. South Korea, Japan, North Korea and Jordan go into battle at the Salt Lake Stadium, already having won the war. 

They will be playing for pride and a place in the final, but all four semi-finalists are secure in the knowledge that they will be featuring at next years Fifa Youth World Cup in Canada. 

South Korea, looking to complete a hattrick of titles, have the edge over Japan in the first game, while North Korea will fancy their chances against Chinese-conquerors Jordan. Thursdays double-header could, thus, set up a mouth-watering all-Korean title showdown. 

Yes, we would like to play North Korea on Sunday, South Korean coach Cho Dong-hyun said through an interpreter at a press conference Wednesday. 

Of course, they first have to pass the Japanese test. Japan are an organised side with a very good attack. We have to be solid in defence, observed Cho. 

The Salt Lake turf is worrying the South Korean camp. Its a hard, uneven ground and affects our style of soccer as we have talented, skilful players, remarked the coach. 

The Japanese know they are a tad lucky to have qualified for the last four, after having been involved in a three-way tie in groups league action in Bangalore. Not only do they have to contend with the toughest team in the championship, the Japanese also have to adapt to new conditions. 

Jordan, the surprise package, will be hoping that their fairytale run continues. The initial euphoria of qualifying (for the Youth World Cup) is over, the boys have realised there is more responsibility, said their Danish coach Jan Poulsen. The win against China has given them lots of confidence. Who knows, there could be another upset. 

Its no fault of the North Koreans that they have hardly any idea about their opponents. The Jordanians, after all, are featuring in the AFC Youth Championship after 28 years! 

Like the Japanese, the North Koreans also have to adjust to different conditions. They, however, found the Salt Lake Stadium better than Bangalores Kanteerava Stadium. 

Worried with the poor turnout, state sports minister Subhas Chakraborty announced that 50,000 complimentary tickets will be distributed for Sundays final. We are also arranging special buses for ferrying fans to and from the stadium on Sunday, Chakraborty informed at a media conference.

London: Manchester United made it three wins out of three in the new Premier League season with a 2-1 win at promoted Watford on Saturday. 

Defender Mikael Silvestre and winger Ryan Giggs scored the goals that ensured United are the only side with a 100 per cent record and kept them two points clear of second-placed Everton. 

Everton, down to 10 men for an hour following a red card for Kevin Kilbane, fully deserved a 2-0 win over a pale Tottenham Hotspur side at White Hart Lane with an own-goal by Calum Davenport and an Andy Johnson strike. 

There were two red cards and two penalties at the Valley where home side Charlton Athletic spent more than an hour a man short after Hermann Hreidarsson was sent off for violent conduct but still beat Bolton Wanderers 2-0 for their first win. 

Striker Darren Bent scored both goals, the first from a penalty in the 65th minute, nine minutes after El-Hadji Diouf had his saved by Scott Carson and six before Davies became the second player dismissed. 

In the days early match Liverpool scored twice in four minutes to come from behind and beat West Ham United 2-1 in a re-match of Mays FA Cup final. 

Striker Bobby Zamora scored his fourth goal in three matches to give Hammers an early lead. Danish defender Daniel Agger equalised in the 42nd minute with a fine striker from 30 metres into the top corner after advancing unchallenged from the Liverpool half. Englands Peter Crouch struck the winner four minutes later, taking a good pass from Luis Garcia and rounding goalkeeper Roy Carroll to slot the ball home from six metres. 

Elsewhere in Germany, wasteful Bayern Munich had to settle for a goalless draw at home to surprise Bundesliga leaders Nuremberg on Saturday. 

Bayern, double winners for the past two seasons, had enough chances to beat their Bavarian rivals comfortably but Roy Makaay missed an open goal in the second half and Lukas Podolski made little impact after coming on as a substitute. 

A draw was enough for Nuremberg to edge back to the top with seven points from their three matches played. 

Bayern are behind them on goal difference, sharing second spot with Schalke 04 after their 2-0 win over Werder Bremen on Friday.

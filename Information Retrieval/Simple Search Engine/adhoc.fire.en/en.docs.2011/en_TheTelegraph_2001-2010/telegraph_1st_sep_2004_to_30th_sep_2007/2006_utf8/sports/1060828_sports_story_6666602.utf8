The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 The big-time basketball is returning to the city almost after a decade. About 50 teams and 800 boys and girls will vie for top honours in the 33rd Sub-Junior National Basketball starting at Netaji Indoor Stadium from Monday. 

 While 26 teams have confirmed participation in the boys section, the girls competition will see 24 teams in this WBBA-organised seven-day fray. Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh are the defending champions and runners-up in boys section while Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu won the first two places among girls in the last edition of the meet. 

 The CFL Premier Division match between East Bengal and Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday has been thrown into confusion on the grounds that it coincides with a state athletic association programme at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

 Although the IFA is yet to take a decision, but it is likely to postpone the match till Indias Asian Cup qualifier (away) against Saudi Arabia gets over on September 6. India captain Bhaichung Bhutia and others have left for the national camp on Sunday.

 BASKETBALL: Sub-junior nationals at Netaji Indoor Stadium from 7 am. 

 CHESS: National meet for visually impaired at BSS, Lake Town.

 Rameez Raja role in Younis Yorks job

 - I acted as the go-between

Jaipur: Former captain Rameez Raja played a role in Younis Khan, the current stand-in captain, becoming the first Pakistani to be signed by Yorkshire. 

I wasnt the middleman, but simply acted as the go-between, Rameez, also a former chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, told The Telegraph Tuesday. 

The County contacted Rameez when the Pakistanis were touring England in the second half of the summer. He, in turn, conveyed the messages from one to the other. 

Initially, Yorkshire were looking to appoint Younis as the captain for 2007, but that changed after the Countys board identified another overseas player who could get the top job. So far, Australian Darren Lehmann has been the only non-Englishman to wear the captains hat. 

Craig White led Yorkshire this summer, while Lehmann and compatriot Jason Gillespie were the overseas signings. The County just about escaped being demoted to Division II, finishing third from the bottom in the Championship table. 

Its possible, by the way, that Younis will get a contract for 2008 as well.

 Negi splits point with McNab

Hastings (England): Continuing his good show, Parimarjan Negi held veteran Grandmaster Colin McNab in the seventh round of the masters section of the Hastings International Chess Congress here. 

After the keenly contested draw, Negi, who became an International Master earlier during this event, suffered a mild setback in his quest for a maiden GM norm, although the 12-year-old still remained in contention. 

In the next round, Negi meets Croatian GM Bogdan Lalic and in the event of a victory, the Indians chances for the coveted norm will improve hugely. At the top of the table, GM Milos Pavlovic of Serbia caused a sensation by defeating top seed Russian GM Vladimir Belov. 

The win helped Pavlovic emerge as the sole leader in the ?6000 tournament on six points out of a possible seven. Three players are on the heels of the leader with 5.5 points apiece, including GM Valerij Neverov of Ukraine, while as many as eight are next in line on five points each. Negi has 4.5 points. 

Playing the black side of a Grunfeld defence, Negi got a reasonable position after the opening wherein the Indian surprised his opponent with his preparation. 

Soon in the middle game, Mcnab was under some problems when his kingside was forcibly opened by Negi but the Scot kept himself in the game with counter active moves. 

Both players fell under acute time pressure by the 30th move and though Negi had slightly better prospects, he decided to repeat the position and signed peace in 32 moves. (PTI)

 Sachin discharged from hospital

 Sachin Tendulkar 

London: Sachin Tendulkar has made good recovery and has been discharged from the hospital on Tuesday evening, said Dr. Andrew Wallace in a statement here on Wednesday. 

The operation was successful and when I visited Sachin yesterday afternoon, I was pleased to see that he has made a good recovery, said Wallace who operated on Sachins shoulder on Monday at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth. 

The orthopaedic surgeon said Sachin was beginning to be more comfortable wearing a sling and was dischar- ged from the hospital last evening. 

The master blaster underwent arthroscopic surgery on Monday to stabilise his shoulder joint and reattach a damaged biceps tendon to his upper arm bone. 

According to Wallace, Sachins shoulder injury is not as serious as tennis elbow that struck him a year and a half ago.

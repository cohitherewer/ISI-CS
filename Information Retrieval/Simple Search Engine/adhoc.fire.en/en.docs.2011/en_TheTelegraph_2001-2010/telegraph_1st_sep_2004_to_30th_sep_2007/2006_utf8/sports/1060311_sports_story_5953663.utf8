 Anju campaign begins today

 - WORLD INDOOR MEET 

New Delhi: World number four Anju Bobby George starts her campaign at the World Indoor Athletics Championship after fine-tuning her technique to boost her chances of success at the elite event. 

I have worked on my rhythm and landing and they have improved since my last competition. I am happy with the situation now, said Anju from Moscow before the qualifying rounds of the womens long jump on Saturday. 

She warmed up for the championship by claiming gold at the Federation Cup here with a best effort of 6.47m but was not satisfied with her run-up and landing. She reached the Russian capital a few days before her event and worked with her coach and husband Bobby George to rectify the minor problems in her technique. 

My training session has been going well even though I have not been jumping yet, Anju said. 

This would be only the third indoor event for the Indian ace after the 2003 World Championship in Birmingham, where she finished seventh with a 6.40m a national indoor record jump, and the Asian Indoor Championship earlier this year where she won the silver medal with a jump of 6.32m. But she denied that her lack of experience indoors could be a factor in Moscow. 

It does not bother me too much. I am pretty confident of doing well, Anju said. 

The entry standard for the event has been set at 6.65m. 

 I will look to make it to the finals first and will not go full pelt in the qualifying jumps, said Anju, who will next lead Indias charge at the Commonwealth Games.

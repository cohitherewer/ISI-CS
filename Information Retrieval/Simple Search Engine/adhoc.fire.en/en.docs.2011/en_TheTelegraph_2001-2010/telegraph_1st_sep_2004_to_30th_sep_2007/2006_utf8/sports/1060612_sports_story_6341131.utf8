 Japan rely on tactical nous 

 - Socceroos rubbish rough play accusation 

Kaiserslautern: Japan are bracing themselves for a gruelling physical battle when they face Australia in their World Cup opener on Monday. 

The Asian champions will look to counter Australias power with their own tactical nous and speed on the break in a Group F game regarded by both teams as vital to their prospects. 

With Croatia and World Cup holders Brazil looming in the group, a poor performance in Kaiserslautern would leave the losers with a mountain to climb to reach the last 16. 

Japan overcame earthquakes, typhoons and a much-publicised curfew-breaking drinking session early in coach Zicos reign to qualify for the World Cup for the second time. 

The Brazilian has been sweating over the fitness of several key players in the run-up to the Australia clash while questions remain over the stability of Japans defence. 

Only Yuji Nakazawa, at 187 cm, stands tall among Japans three-man back line and will be asked to shadow Australia forward Mark Viduka, cleared to play after a calf problem. 

Our defenders are not going to suddenly grow another few inches overnight so weve worked on getting the marking right and making sure were marking tight, said Zico. 

His first choice strikers Naohiro Takahara and Atsushi Yanagisawa, as well as playmaker Shunsuke Nakamura, have all recovered from knocks and should start. 

The Japanese squad has also closed ranks after playmaker Hidetoshi Nakata blasted the team as a shambles following a narrow 1-0 win over Malta in their final warm-up game. 

Meanwhile in Oehringen, Australia coach Guus Hiddink is furious with accusations that his team plays dirty. 

Im getting very angry when people are suggesting that, Hiddink said on Sunday. We have a good team. They like to fight. Every team must fight in my opinion. 

Hiddink was reacting to a newspaper article in which a top Japanese Football Association official criticised Australias physical style of play. Hiddink said such talk reflected irresponsible behaviour toward our team and the sport in general. He added that is also was intended to sway referees. 

 And I think thats not fair, Hiddink said. You should play fair at the beginning. 

Australia captain Mark Viduka was also dismissive. 

I dont know what all the hypes about, Viduka said. We as Australians ? and our team in particular ? play fair every time we go out. 

Were very competitive people. We like to win and we will never pull out of a tackle. But it doesnt mean that we go out to hurt people. I think its a lot of hype made up so people can write articles, Viduka added.The Socceroos have come into the tournament with a reputation for rambunctious play. They bumped and battled The Netherlands to a 1-1 draw before the World Cup, with three Dutch players injured during the game. 

Australia defender Luke Wilkshire was sent off for a second yellow card, scything down a Dutch player in the corner. 

 Defender Lucas Neill later acknowledged that the Australians were deliberately physical to blunt the technical skills of the Dutch. 

Hiddink called the match fair, saying one Dutch player injured himself and another was hurt in a normal game collision. 

The Japan game represents the first for Australia at the World Cup since 1974 in West Germany, when the Socceroos lost two games and drew one without scoring a goal in their only prior trip to the tournament. 

 But Hiddink has a wealth of World Cup experience, having led the Netherlands and South Korea to the semi-finals in previous World Cups. 

 This time around, his hopes appear more modest ? the second round. 

 Japan winger Akira Kaji is out with an ankle injury he picked up in a 2-2 draw with Germany.

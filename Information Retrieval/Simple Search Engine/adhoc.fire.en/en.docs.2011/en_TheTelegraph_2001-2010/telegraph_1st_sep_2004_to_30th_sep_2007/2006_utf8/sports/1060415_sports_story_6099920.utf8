The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Atwal well-placed at 10th

 USPGA Meet

 Hilton Head Island (South Carolina): 

 Arjun Atwal, needing a good result to bolster his sagging 

 form this season, came up with a fine 4-under 67 to lie 

 10th after the first round of $5.3m Verizon Heritage Golf 

 tournament.

 Atwal, who has missed four successive 

 cuts and six in last seven starts since FBR Open in the 

 first week of February, had five birdies and just one bogey 

 in his round.

 He opened at the 10th and went 

 two-under for the back nine of the course and then his only 

 bogey came on the first, before a hattrick of birdies from 

 fourth to sixth ensured a fine day for him.

 Leader in putting averages last 

 season, Atwal has struggled with it this season and is 114th 

 in putting and 155th in birdie average, where he was third 

 last year.

 In the first round, his putting 

 seemed somewhat better for this year with 27 putts.

 Daniel Chopra had a roller coaster 

 of a round with a two-over 74, which included an eagle and 

 two double bogeys, besides two other bogeys and one birdie. 

 He was even after 14th but then dropped three shots in last 

 four holes including a double on 18th for his 74th that 

 placed him 101st.

 Vaughn Taylor, who disappointed 

 at the Masters in Augusta, where he grew up, seemed more 

 relaxed in his 8-under 63 in the first round that included 

 four birdies on the last four closing holes. He was two 

 off the course record of 61 by David Frost in 1994. Ernie 

 Els, the only one of the top-five here in the field, shot 

 a 71.

 Jim Furyk was a shot behind in 

 second at 64, while Tom Pernice Jr., Billy Mayfair and Tom 

 Waldorf shared the third at 65 each. (PTI)

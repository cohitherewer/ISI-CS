 Indian eves win, men held

Turin (Italy): Viswanathan Anands absence hurt the Indian mens team badly as they could manage only a 2-2 draw against Uzbekistan in the ninth round of the 37th Chess Olympiad. Whereas the Indian eves managed to carve out a 2-1 victory over Kazakhstan and slipped to joint 13th spot. 

Grandmaster Koneru Humpy came back strongly after a loss in the previous round to defeat Kazakh top player Dana Aketayeva while D. Harika produced a much-needed victory over Sofya Zigangirova. 

The second seed Indian men came up with another mediocre performance and missed out on a victory over the lower ranked Uzbeks despite Krishnan Sasikiran, P. Harikrishna, Surya Sekhar Ganguly and Sandipan Chanda enjoying a better rating than their counterparts. 

With just four rounds to go, the Indian men are clearly struggling on joint 10th spot with just 22.5 points and badly need some big wins in their kitty. 

In the womens, Swati Ghate failed to make it a clean sweep going down against untitled Gulmira Dauletova. 

At the top of the table, defending champion China held top seed and overnight sole leader Russia to a draw. It turned out to be a big gain for Ukraine who scored a 2.5-0.5 victory over the United States to emerge as the new leader on 21 points with four rounds to go. (PTI)

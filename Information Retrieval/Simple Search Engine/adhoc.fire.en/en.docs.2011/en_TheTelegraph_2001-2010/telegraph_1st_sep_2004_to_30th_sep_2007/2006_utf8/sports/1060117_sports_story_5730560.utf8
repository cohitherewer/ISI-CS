 Teenager knocks Venus out 

 - Moya, Dent bite the dust Davenport, Sharapova cruise 

Melbourne: Venus Williams was knocked out of the Australian Open on Monday and her sister Serena, the defending champion, was lucky not to suffer the same fate on a dramatic start to the first Grand Slam of the year. 

Tenth seed Venus made her earliest grand slam exit in five years when she fell to little-known Bulgarian teenager Tszvetana Pironkova 2-6, 6-0, 9-7 in the first round while Serena struggled to a 6-3, 6-7, 6-2 win over unseeded Chinese player Li Na. 

I just couldnt pull my game together. I dont know what happened, a dejected Venus said at a news conference. I was in good form but I just somehow fell off. 

The American sisters both came into the tournament with question marks about their fitness but Serena said her biggest problem against Li was mental. Everyone chokes, I choked today, she said. I just lost it basically, I didnt do what I needed to do. 

Wimbledon champion Venus was the biggest casualty on an action-packed opening day at Melbourne Park that saw eight seeded players eliminated. 

The mens draw lost two seeds. Former Australian Open finalist Carlos Moya lost in five sets to Andrei Pavel and big-serving American Taylor Dent fell to Guillermo Garcia-Lopez. 

The womens draw lost Russian ninth seed Elena Dementieva, who was beaten by Germanys Julia Schruff, as well as Tatiana Golovin, Ai Sugiyama, Anabel Medina Garrigues and Klara Koukalova. 

Argentinas Masters Cup champion David Nalbandian, one of just four men to beat Roger Federer last year, survived a tough scrap with Thai qualifier Danai Udomchoke to win 6-2, 6-2, 1-6, 6-7, 6-1. 

His Davis Cup teammate, eighth seed Gaston Gaudio, had a much easier time against Razvan Sabau, strolling into the second round when the injured Romanian pulled out in the second set. 

Its not the best way to start but its good always to win, the score doesnt matter, Nalbandian said. 

Second seed Andy Roddick buried the disappointment of losing in the first round of last years US Open with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Swiss qualifier Michael Lammer. 

I stopped thinking about that (defeat) a while ago, Roddick said. Im not going to carry that with me for a long time. 

World No. 1 Lindsay Davenport had a short first day, crushing Australian wildcard Casey Dellacqua 6-2, 6-1 in less than an hour, while Maria Sharapova and the bookmakers favourite Justine Henin-Hardenne also made light work of their opponents. 

I feel like Im ready for the challenges, said Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion and runner-up to Serena Williams 12 months ago. 

Sharapova showed few signs of the shoulder injury that threatened to wreck her campaign as she breezed to a 6-2, 6-1 first-round win over Sandra Kloesel while 2004 Australian Open champion Henin-Hardenne beat Marta Domachowska 6-2, 6-1. 

Thats one of the first times I played a match without feeling anything, Sharapova said. I dont expect it to be that like for the whole tournament so Im very happy I got through that one without any pain. 

Pironkova, playing in her first Grand Slam match, showed no sign of nerves or being intimidated by the power of Venus, frustrating her opponent by tenaciously running down every shot she played. 

I have known (about) Venus for a long time from the TV when I was a little kid, Pironkova said.I always loved her game. But when I go on court I am a professional player, so I should not think about (the fact) that she was kind of my idol before. 

Seeded 13th after her ranking plummeted when she played just 23 matches after winning in Melbourne last year, Serena served for the match in the second set but two consecutive double faults handed Li a service break that turned the course of the match. 

I just got angry that I was in the situation. I felt as if the match should have been over and I shouldnt even have been out there at that point, Serena said. 

Sania up to No. 32 

Indias Sania Mirza moved up two places to No. 32 on the WTA Tour Entry System standings, according to the list released on Monday. She now has 616.75 points. 

Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, who won the Sydney International title last week, also moved two places to No. 6. 

On the mens side, Australian Lleyton Hewitt fell two to No. 6, while David Nalbandian (Argentina) and Nikolay Davydenko (Russia) moved up one each to Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.

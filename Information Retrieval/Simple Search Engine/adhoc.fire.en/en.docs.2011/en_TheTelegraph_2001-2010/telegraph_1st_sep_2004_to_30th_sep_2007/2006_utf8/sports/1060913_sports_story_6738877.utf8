The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Clockwork may do the trick again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Fields in Wednesdays race card, though small, are very competitive and few close finishes are ruled out. The card includes three trophy events. 

 The focus, however, will be on the 1,800m Alternator Cup which may see three closely handicapped horses Proud Native, Clockwork and Adderly vying for supremacy. Proud Native is the best handicapped horse but to win an 1,800m race without a race-gallop is always an arduous task.

 Adderlys marginal advantage at the weight, vis-a-vis Clockwork, may not work despite K.P. Appus presence in the saddle as Clockwork beat him far more easily than the official verdict indicates. Therefore, Clockwork may do the trick again as the Vijay Singh-trainee hasnt been pushed to her limit yet. S. Shanker partners the Steinbeck-filly.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

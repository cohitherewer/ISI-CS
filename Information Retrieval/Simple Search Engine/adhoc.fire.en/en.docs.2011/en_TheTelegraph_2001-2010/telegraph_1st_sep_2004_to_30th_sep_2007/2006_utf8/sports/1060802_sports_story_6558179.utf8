The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Vijay banks on Aleksei 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: Trainer Vijay Singh means business in Wednesdays race card. The champion trainer has three potential performers, including Aleksei who could open his seasons account. Aleksei takes on four rivals in the feature event, the 1,400m Roubaix Cup.

 Alekseis Leger-run is best ignored as the Razeen-Remembren son is more comfortable over middle distances. A two-time easy winner over a mile circuit, Aleksei seems to be maintaining his good form and may score in the hands of C.Alford.

 The Vijay-Alford combinations may also come good in 1,400m Anticipator Handicap. They have a smart sprinter in Clockwork who is heading for her third straight win. However, the combos youngster, Flemenco Star, may have to overcome his weight disadvantage in the Reliable Plate.Read as: Sl. nos, last 4 runs, horse name, trainer, jockey, weight amp; draw:

 We need to take care of the heat: Advocaat

Bensberg: Having heard about the problems the heat caused England, South Korean coach Dick Advocaat says his team will chose carefully when to press Togo in their World Cup opener on Tuesday in Frankfurt. 

 We want to pressurise them. But we have to take care a little bit about the heat because what I hear from people from England against Paraguay is that it is very, very warm, the Dutchman told reporters Sunday. So in that way, its important how you press them. You cant press the whole game. You must feel the right moments to do that. 

Advocaat had told reporters over the previous three days that warm weather wont have an effect on the South Koreans game since theyre used to playing in Asias summer heat. 

But with temperatures across Germany rising and reaching 36 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) in Frankfurt on Saturday ? causing Englands players to complain about the heat in their 1-0 mid-afternoon over the South Americans ? Advocaat appeared to soften his position. 

His comments came following South Koreas final practice session at Leverkusens Bay Arena on Sunday, adding the 2002 semi-finalists are anxious to get under way. 

South Korea, whose game starts at 3 p.m., plan to travel by bus from Bensberg to Frankfurt on Monday morning and train for a last time in the evening at Frankfurts World Cup stadium. 

 South Korean players practised some set plays and played two 10-minute games during the closed-door training session on Sunday morning, Advocaat said. But the coach refused to disclose if hell play with three defenders and four midfielders, or four defenders and three midfielders along with three strikers against the Africans. 

 Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-sung excepts he will play a crucial role in the opener. Because Im the best-known player, (the Togolese) may look at me a lot more. And I think that will leave our other players more space, Park said.

 Satisfied with draw: Paes

Mumbai: India Davis Cup captain Leander Paes said he was happy and satisfied with Thursdays draw for the Asia-Oceania Zone Group I Davis Cup play-off tie between India and Pakistan. 

Pakistans No. 1 player Aisam-ul Haq Qureshi will take on Indias No. 2 Rohan Bopanna in the first singless at the CCI lawns on Friday. 

Im happy Rohan (Bopanna) gets to play first, said Paes. Prakash also preferred to play in the afternoon, though both were prepared either way. 

A Davis Cup tie starts once the draw is done. Now we can concentrate on exactly what needs to be done. 

Paes also said that if the tie was decided by Saturday, he might even play the reverse singles on Sunday. 

He expressed happiness that the workload was being divided between four players with him and Bhupathi, winners of a string of Grand Slam doubles crowns, playing on Day II. 

The workload is divided amongst four players and thats important, he said. Serve, volley and good returns of serves, thats what will be seen over the next few days. 

Pakistan have decided to pit doubles novices Jalil Khan and Asim Shafik against the erstwhile Indian Express in Saturdays doubles. Asked if he had been surprised by the decision, Paes said: They can change it an hour before the match.

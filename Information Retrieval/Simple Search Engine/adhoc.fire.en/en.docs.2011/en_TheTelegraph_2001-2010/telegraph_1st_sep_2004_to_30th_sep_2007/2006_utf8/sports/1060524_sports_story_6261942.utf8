 Korea held 1-1 by Senegal

Seoul: South Korea were held to a 1-1 draw by Senegal on Tuesday in the first of four warm-up matches for next months World Cup. 

Koreas Park Chu-young collected a cross on his chest to set up Kim Do-heon for a low strike in the 74th minute in the Seoul World Cup Stadium. 

Five minutes later the Africans shocked the home fans when Moussa Ndiaye struck a fine effort from outside the area to beat South Korea keeper Lee Woon-jae. 

I was very happy with the game because we are, as you know, in the middle of preparations for Germany, South Korea coach Dick Advocaat told a news conference. 

It was an excellent exercise for us especially on the physical side. 

South Korea striker and fan favourite Ahn Jung-hwan had a goal disallowed for offside just after the break and a penalty appeal turned down in a frantic last 10 minutes.

London: Bayern Munich, Valencia and Chelsea all maintained 100 per cent records with their third straight wins as the Champions League group phase reached the halfway stage on Wednesday. 

Bayern Munich beat Sporting 1-0 in Lisbon in group B, Bastian Schweinsteiger scoring a superb long-range goal after 19 minutes but was sent off early in the second half for a second booking. 

Valencia beat Shakhtar Donetsk 2-0 in group D, thanks to two first-half goals by David Villa. 

Chelsea handed European champions Barcelona a 1-0 defeat (as reported in Thursdays Late City edition) at Stamford Bridge in group A where Didier Drogba scored an outstanding goal after 47 minutes. 

The result left Chelsea level with Werder Bremen after the Germans beat debutants Levski Sofia, the first Bulgarian club to take part in the competition proper, 2-0. 

Werder won with goals from Brazilians Naldo and Diego and kept a clean sheet at home for the first time in 13 Champions League matches. 

Liverpool, the 2005 European champions, stayed top of group C with a 1-0 win in Bordeaux where Peter Crouch headed the only goal after 58 minutes to take their tally to seven points. PSV Eindhoven, who came from behind to win 2-1 at Galatasaray with goals from Jan Kromkamp and Arouna Kone, have seven points as well. 

Sasa Ilic had put Galatasaray ahead after 19 minutes but Galatasaray coach Eric Gerets, who won the European Cup with PSV in 1988, could only watch as his team ran out of steam in the second half. 

Although no team is yet certain of their place in the last-16, it is hard to see any of the group leaders failing to advance now. 

In contrast, the immediate future in the competition looks bleak for Levski Sofia, whose defeat in Bremen was their third in group A, while Bordeaux have only one point in group C, the same as Galatasaray. 

Shakhtar and Olympiakos Piraeus also look out of the running after the formers defeat to Valencia and the Greeks 0-1 home defeat by AS Roma left them on a point apiece. 

Inter (3) still trail Bayern (9) and Sporting Lisbon (4), but their prospects are far brighter after this victory.

 My 

 player of the week / Shyam Thapa

 Maradona in making

 Player No.1: Lionel Messi

The World Cup has exploded with 

 all its charm, character, spirit and vivacity ? qualities 

 which make it such a special occasion to savour. As the 

 first fortnight of the competition came to an end, with 

 16 teams being eliminated after a gruelling group stage 

 battle, the memories of week No. 2 has been about ecstasy 

 and agony in equal measure. 

 We saw some good and competitive 

 matches during those seven days. Some of them entertained 

 us with modern technical and tactical understanding ? necessary 

 components of a team game ? like the Argentines, Spanairds, 

 Ghanaians and Germans. 

 Some like Brazil, England, France 

 and Portugal entertained us with their individual skills. 

 But till the end of Round I, the so-called big stars like 

 Beckham, Zidane, Ronaldihno or Ballack, did not live up 

 to expectations. 

 This has made me comb through 

 the bunch of promising youngsters to pick the star of the 

 week. The preceding week has given me a number of choices, 

 who are not only talented but stars in the making. Rooney 

 is already enjoying star status at club-level football, 

 but he is yet to fire on all cylinders in Germany because 

 of his injury. 

 Also making a beeline for stardom 

 are Riquelme, Lionel Messi, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Fernando 

 Torres, Tevez, Crespo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Deco, Pauleta, 

 Luca Toni, Kaka, Robinho and Juninho, just to name a few. 

 I must say these youngsters have outclassed and outshone 

 the veterans in the second week of the tournament. Because 

 of them, no big team suffered any upset in the group stage. 

 Picking the best out of this bunch 

 is a difficult job. But eventually, my vote will go in favour 

 of Messi, who turned 19 on Saturday. How can I swim against 

 the stream when the legendary Pele and Maradona have spoken 

 highly about this Argentine teenager? 

 I like his speed with and without 

 the ball. His passing resembles that of Pele, and his jinking 

 run with the ball reminds me of Maradona. He still has a 

 long way to go, but if he can cope with the pressure and 

 dedicate himself solely to the game, Im sure the fans 

 can expect to get another Maradona.

 Messi came on as a second-half 

 substitute in the game against Serbia amp; Montenegro, 

 and immediately attracted attention. He came through as 

 a gamemaker, with some delicate touches, and also scored 

 one himself.

 Against the Dutch, Pekerman played 

 him from the word go and didnt he make his presence 

 felt! His explosive presence tested the Dutch defence, even 

 though the match ended goalless.

 Messi served notice to the world 

 when he joined Barcelona as a 13-year-old. He moved up the 

 ranks scoring regularly and is now a feared man in the Primera 

 Liga.

 He also helped Argentina win the 

 2005 Fifa World Youth Championship. He scored half-a-dozen 

 goals to finish top-scorer. Surely, the senior Argentine 

 side will benefit from many such outings in the months and 

 days, months and years to come.

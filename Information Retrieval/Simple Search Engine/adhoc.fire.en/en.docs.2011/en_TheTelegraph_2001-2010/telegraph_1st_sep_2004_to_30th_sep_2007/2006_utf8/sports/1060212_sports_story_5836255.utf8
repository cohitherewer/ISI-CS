 Inzy decision surprises Dravid

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Islamabad: Just as the dust was settling over Inzamam-ul Haqs obstructing the field dismissal in Peshawar, Shoaib Malik nearly treaded into dangerous territory on Saturday. 

Younis Khan had played the ball on the off side and as Malik took off for a single he got into a tangle with bowler Zaheer Khan, who had rushed down on his follow through into the middle of the pitch. Malik would have struggled to regain ground had Zaheer picked up the ball and threw down the stumps. 

Malik, in effect, deflected the ball away with his boots (whether willfully or not may never be known) and got back into the crease without a problem. There was just a brief hint of a protest from Zaheer. 

 To be honest I havent seen the replays, Rahul Dravid said later. From my fielding position, it didnt appear as if he had deliberately kicked the ball or obstructed the fielder. So I didnt think there was any need to appeal. 

The Indian captain was ecstatic after the series levelling win and attributed the success to team effort. 

The bowlers bowled well and kept taking wickets regularly. The early inroads slowed down their run-rate. The batting also clicked. It was a good allround show. 

Dravid was all praise for his deputy. When Veeru (Virender Sehwag) gets you off to such a start it makes a huge difference. It puts the opposition under pressure. 

Dravid said he was surprised when Inzamam decided to bat. I would have fielded first. I protected myself for losing the toss by having Ramesh Powar as the super sub. Inzys decision somewhat stumped me, he remarked.

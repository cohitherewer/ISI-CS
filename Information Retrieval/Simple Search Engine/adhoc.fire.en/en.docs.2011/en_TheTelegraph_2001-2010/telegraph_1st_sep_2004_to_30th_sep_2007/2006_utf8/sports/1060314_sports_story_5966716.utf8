The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Paris: Olympique Marseille goalkeeper Fabien Barthez will miss his side?s Uefa Cup third-round second-leg match against Zenit St Petersburg with a left calf injury, the Ligue 1 club said on Monday. ?He felt a pain in his calf. We will know more about it tomorrow but it will also be hard for him to play against Lille (next Sunday),? coach Jean Fernandez told the club?s website.

 Barthez will be replaced by Marseille?s No. 2 goalkeeper Cedric Carasso. Marseille, who lost 0-1 at the Stade Velodrome in the first leg, will also be without suspended midfielders Wilson Oruma and Franck Ribery.

 Rio de Janeiro: Corinthians coach Antonio Lopes resigned in the dressing room after the Brazilian champions lost 1-2 to Sao Paulo in a derby match on Sunday.

 Lopes became the fifth coaching casualty at the club since they signed a multi-million dollar partnership deal with London-based Media Sports Investments at the end of 2004.

 He had been in charge since September and was at the helm in December when they won the Brazilian championship.

 ?The club asked me to stay but I?d already made the decision and nothing would make me change my mind,? Lopes told reporters.

David Toms gained one spot to seventh at the expense of fellow-american Jim Furyk. Englishman Luke Donald gained two places to enter the top-10 at No. 10 for the first time.

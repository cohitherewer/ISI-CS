 Negi loses to Ukranian GM

Hastings: Parimarjan Negi was left to rue missed opportunities as he went down to second seed Grandmaster Valerij Neverov of Ukraine in the sixth round of the masters section of the Hastings International Chess Congress underway here. 

The loss left Negi with four points out of a possible six, which relegated him to joint ninth spot. Top seed GM Vladimir Belov of Russia, Milos Pavlovic of Serbia and Neverov are in joint lead with five points each. 

They are followed by a pack of five players having 4.5 points apiece, while Negi is amongst the next set of 14 players. 

Negi, who completed the formalities for becoming Indias youngest International Master at this event, is still in contention for his maiden GM norm. But the 12-year-old will have to score heavily in the remaining games to achieve the feat. 

Four rounds remain at this ?6000 tournament being played under Fides Swiss rules.

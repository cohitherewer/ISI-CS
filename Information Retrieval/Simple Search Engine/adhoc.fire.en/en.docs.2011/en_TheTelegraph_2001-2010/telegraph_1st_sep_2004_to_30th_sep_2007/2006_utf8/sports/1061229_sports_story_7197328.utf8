 SA build on first-innings lead

 - SECOND TEST 

 - India dismissed for 240 

Durban: India paid the price for some atrocious shot selection, allowing South Africa to take firm control of the second Test with a sizeable first innings lead. 

AB de Villiers and Graeme Smith shared an unbroken half-century stand to build South Africas first-innings lead of 88 on the third day of the second Test against India on Thursday. 

South Africa were 64 without loss in their second innings, a lead of 152 runs, when bad light ended play 30.3 overs early. De Villiers was 31 not out with Smith on 28. 

India were dismissed for 240 in reply to South Africas first innings of 328. 

Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman resumed on 103 for three and took their partnership to 64 before Sachin attempted to cut an angled, short delivery from fast bowler Makhaya Ntini and was caught behind by wicketkeeper Mark Boucher. 

Sachin, who was dropped on 21 on Wednesday, hit 11 fours in his 63, Indias top score. 

Three balls later Sourav Ganguly fended a rising, short delivery from Ntini to Herschelle Gibbs in the gully to be dismissed without scoring. 

Debutant fast bowler Morne Morkel took his first Test wicket when Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored 34, edged a drive to De Villiers at second slip. 

The dismissal ended a steadying partnership of 54 that Dhoni shared with Laxman. 

Morkel claimed his second victim in his next over when Anil Kumble drove wildly and was caught behind by Boucher for nought. 

Zaheer Khan skied what became the last ball before lunch, bowled by Morkel, to Hashim Amla at short-leg to be dismissed for two. 

Free-scoring No. 10 Sreesanth helped Laxman add 52 runs in fluent style for the ninth wicket. 

Mediumpacer Andrew Hall ended the partnership when Sreesanth, whose 28 included five fours, swung across the line and edged a catch to Boucher. 

The innings was over an hour after lunch when mediumpacer Shaun Pollock had VRV Singh caught behind for four. 

Laxman batted for almost three hours for his unbeaten 50. Ntini and Morkel claimed three wickets each. 

Play will again begin half-an-hour early, 1 pm IST.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I am feeling positive: Sachin

New Delhi: Seeking to put an end to the controversy over his fitness, Sachin Tendulkar has said he is fit and raring to go. 

It hasnt been easy not being part of the team and I missed it a lot. But I am looking at the positives, and yes, I feel fit and just happy to be back. I am ready to give my best, he told a TV channel. 

A fresh debate on his fitness had ensued after coach Greg Chappell said Sachin was still not fully fit and unable to throw the ball from the deep. But Sachin said his shoulder was holding up quite nicely now. 

I had to go through a gradual increase in workloads and follow a particular rehabilitation programme. It was a step by step process. Batting was never a problem. Occasionally there was pain while throwing and bowling. But it has settled down and I am feeling positive. (PTI)

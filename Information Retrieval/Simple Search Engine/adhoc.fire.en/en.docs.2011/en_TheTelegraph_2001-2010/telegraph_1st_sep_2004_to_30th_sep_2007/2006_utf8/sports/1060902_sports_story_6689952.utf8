 We must be flexible, says Chappell

Bangalore: Coach Greg Chappell has asked Team India members to adopt a flexible approach since their roles can change depending on the game and their opposition. 

On a question on Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj Singh, two of the five players who attended the first phase of the rolling camp, Chappell said he was sure they are working towards becoming more consistent as well. 

Everybody is looking for consistency. Everybody is looking to be able to play their role, the former Australia captain said. 

The roles can vary depending on the time, game and opposition. So its a matter of being flexible and adjusting to different conditions. 

We dont really know what we are going to be confronted with (in) Malaysia. But we expect the wicket to be on the slower side. We must adjust when we arrive, Chappell said. 

The Team India coach justified the short duration of the rolling camp and expressed satisfaction with the first phase, attended by Virender Sehwag, Ajit Agarkar, Kaif, Irfan Pathan and Yuvraj, that concluded on Friday. A fresh batch is set to take guard on Saturday. 

He said three days were sufficient to work with the players. 

I think anything else (longer duration) would be an overkill. Its important to get the quality right; not quantity. We have got the quality we have been looking for. 

I think we have achieved all the things that we set out to achieve. We have had a lot of time with each of the players. 

Meanwhile, Yuvraj and Kaif described the rolling camp as a novel concept that was proving to be extremely beneficial for them. 

It was a good camp. We worked on specific areas, especially fielding and batting, Yuvraj said. 

Kaif said dividing players into small groups helped focus on individuals, resulting in personal attention. 

The camp was different, challenging and hectic, he said. 

Both said practising with golf balls helped in middling cricket balls better.

 Devang tips helped me immensely: Avishek

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Devang Gandhi was the first to call and congratulate Avishek Jhunjhunwala on Friday. The former India opener had decided to opt out before the Gujarat match citing lack of runs. It paved the way for the youngster and he hasnt looked back. 

On Friday, Avisheks brilliant 139 off 135 balls and his 217-run second-wicket partnership with Subhamoy Das (83) put Bengal in the Ranji Trophy semi-finals. 

I have always benefited from Devangda. He has given me lot of tips on batting and mental preparation. It helped me immensely, Avishek said. 

The 23-year-old said he set no target when he walked out. We wanted to stay positive and take it from there. I was just enjoying myself, Avishek, who dedicated the century to his parents, remarked. 

When we reached 123 in the 27th over, we thought of seeing off another 10 overs. We added almost 80 more runs by then and thought we could make it, he added. 

Deep Dasgupta described the partnership as unbelievable. Their stand put us in a position of no return. We have had a few outright wins this season? Todays and the one versus Delhi will stand out. 

The Bengal captain said it had been a team decision to promote Sourashish Lahiri as opener. He felt there was a difference in the team this season. The body language has changed. All credit to Paras (Mhambrey) and the CAB? Remember this was also a tough group, Deep said. 

The players celebrated with a team dinner. Let us enjoy? It hasnt sunk in as yet? Well think about the semi-final from tomorrow, Deep quipped. 

Subhamoy said despite the failures, he didnt experience any pressure as such because the team gave him a lot of support. I was getting the starts but failing to build on them? 

Mhambrey did not wish to take any credit. The players have made it possible. The way they reacted in crunch situations have proved it all.

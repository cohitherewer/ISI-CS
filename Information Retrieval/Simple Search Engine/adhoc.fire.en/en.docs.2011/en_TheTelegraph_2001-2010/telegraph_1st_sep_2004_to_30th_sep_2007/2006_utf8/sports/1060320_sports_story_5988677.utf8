Melbourne: India grabbed a gold medal in shooting and three silvers on Day IV of competition at the 18th Commonwealth Games on Sunday, while the shuttlers and paddlers kept themselves on course for a podium finish. 

With four medals coming their way, India maintained their third position with eight golds, six silvers and a bronze, behind England who widened the gap by increasing their gold tally to 13. Australia consolidated their position atop the medals table with 28 gold, 20 silver and 19 bronze. 

Vijay Kumar and Pemba Tamang were the stars for India, claiming gold in 25m rapid-fire pistol pairs event with 1134 points to boost the countrys gold medal tally to eight. 

Vijay (290) and Pemba (280) finished a whopping 18 shots ahead of Australias David Chapman and Bruce Favell, while Canadians Metodi Igorov and Yuri Movshovich were third with 1111. 

 However, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore and Anjali Bhagwats hopes of bagging gold were trampled. Rathore, paired with Vikram Bhatnagar, lost his mens double trap pairs title to Australias Russell Mark, who marked his return after a four-year break with a Games record. He teamed up with Craig Trembath. 

Rathore and Bhatnagar tallied 179, seven points less than the 186 set by Mark ? who is also Rathores former coach ? and his partner. The bronze went to Englands Richard Faulds and Steven Walton (176). 

Defending champion Anjali and new partner Anuja Jungs silver was worth 1142 points in the womens 50 m rifle 3 positions pairs event. 

The gold went to Englands Louise Minett and Becky Spicer with 1143 points. 

Indias third silver came via Mohammed Zakir Asdullah in weightlifting. Asdullah took silver in the mens 77kg event with and overall lift of 308kg. That was just one kilogram less than Majeti Fetrie, who claimed the first-ever Commonwealth Games weightlifting gold for Ghana. 

In badminton, India went down 2-3 to defending champions England in the mixed team semi-finals. 

India will now play New Zealand for the bronze on Monday, while England will clash with Malaysia, who beat New Zealand 3-1, in the final. 

India continued their good show in table tennis, as the mens team upset formidable Nigeria 3-2 to book a berth in the team final. 

Nigerias Kazim Nasiru lost both his matches to Achanta Sharath Kamal and Soumyadeep Roy, while Subhajit Saha accounted for Merotohum. However, Segun Toriola ousted both Soumyadeep and Kamal in straight sets. 

The womens team, however, was less lucky as it went down to Singapore 0-3 in the semi-finals. Poulami Ghatak went down 11-3, 9-11, 11-4, 11-7 to Li Jia Wei, while Mouma Das proved no match for Ling Xue Zhand and lost 11-5, 11-7, 11-7. Xu-Yan completed the rout with an 11-6, 11-4, 11-3 win over Nandita Saha. 

In athletics, Vikas Gowda booked a berth in the mens shot put final with an effort of 18.37 m. The 22-year-old had a distance of 18.37m on his third throw to claim the fifth spot in the qualifiers at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In womens 400m, Manjit Kaur booked a berth in the semi-finals. 

In the boxing ring, three Indian pugilists stormed into quarter finals in various divisions. Light heavyweight contender Ajay Kumar and Verghese Johnson in the super heavyweight category carved out contrasting wins in their pre-quarter final bouts to advance their medal hopes. 

Vijender proved too strong for Alvyn Andy Gabriel of Seychelles, winning 25-11. Ajay got the better of Tongas Mokai Paraha with a 22-16 points favourable verdict and will meet Kenyas Joshua Ndere on Tuesday for a place in the last four.

 Orieyo Oracho of Kenya in 35 seconds with the referee stopping

 Must-win tie for Bengal vs MP

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Faridabad: Madhya Pradesh kept Bengal under a bit of pressure when they defeated Rajasthan 8-0 in the Cluster III of the Santosh Trophy at the Sector-12 Stadium here on Saturday. 

In the three-team group, Bengal beat Rajasthan 8-1 on the opening day and now have been placed in a must-win position to top the group. Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee, who watched the match throughout, however, sounded unperturbed. 

True, Madhya Pradesh at the moment are ahead of us on goal difference, but that wont make much of a difference. My boys will get three points on Monday, he said. 

Madhya Pradesh, who led 2-0 at the half time, increased pressure in the second session to slam in six goals. While Rehmat Baig scored three goals, V Shibu and Suresh Rajak (two each) and Praveen Nair were the other scorers. 

In the other match, Bihar defeated Pondicherry 1-0 in Cluster I at Gurgaon. After a goalless first half, Niranjan Patel struck the all-important goal in the 70th minute.

 Illegal Action

 New Delhi: Off-spinner 

 Mohnish Parmar is among the 12 bowlers reported for suspect 

 action during the ICC Under-19 World Cup held in Sri Lanka.

 The BCCI said it had taken note 

 of the observations on Parmar made by the ICC-appointed 

 expert panel and would appoint an experienced off-spinner 

 to study the bowlers action and suggest corrections 

 if needed. The three-man ICC panel comprised Jawagal Srinath, 

 biomechanic expert Marc Portus and Richard Done. (PTI)

 Quick Takes

 Don't rush Rooney warns Beckham

 London: England captain 

 David Beckham said he doesnt want Wayne Rooney to 

 be rushed back from injury in order to play at the World 

 Cup.

 On Saturday, England team doctor 

 Lief Sward said Rooneys progress was very, very 

 positive after he was seen cycling around Uniteds 

 training ground.

 Beckham had a similar injury two 

 months before the start of the 2002 world cup. He played 

 in every England game, but wasnt 100 per cent. If 

 hes not right, then he has to look after himself, 

 Beckham was quoted as saying in a British tabloid. He 

 cant take risks or rush it. Hes got a huge future.

 Zico despairs of shy attackers

 Tokyo: Japan coach Zico 

 was once again left scratching his head after the Asian 

 champions were held to a 0-0 draw by a below-strength Scotland 

 side on Saturday.

 Another anaemic performance from 

 Japans struggling forwards meant the hosts finished 

 last in the three-team Kirin Cup behind winners Scotland 

 and runners-up Bulgaria.

 You cant simply create 

 players whose job it is to score goals, Zico told 

 reporters. Its an instinct youre born 

 with. How Zico must wish Japans goal-shy attackers 

 had it. 

 Gerrard needs arest : Benitez

 London: Liverpool boss 

 Rafael Benitez says Steven Gerrard will need to rest for 

 a week after his long season. The Reds ended the season 

 by beating West Ham on penalties after a 3-3 draw, in the 

 FA Cup on Saturday. The Hammers were two-up after half an 

 hour and seconds from a famous win when Gerrard sent the 

 final into extra-time with a stunning last-gasp equaliser. 

 Saudies beat Togo

 Sittard: A late goal from 

 Malek Al Hawsawi earned Saudi Arabia a 1-0 win against fellow-World 

 Cup finalists Togo in a friendly on Sunday. Al Hawsawi pounced 

 on a through-ball from Mohammed Ameen Haidar five minutes 

 from time before sliding the ball home.

 Hope and trepidation ahead of final Test

 - Indians unsure of bowling combination 

Kingston: India are once again in a quandary over team combination as they approach the fourth and final Test beginning here on Friday with the ambition of clinching their first series win in the Caribbean in 35 years. 

The curator of the Sabina Park has dished out a pitch that will be to the faster bowlers liking but it is still no guarantee that the match will throw up a winner and break the series deadlock. 

But both India and the West Indies enter the fray without the conviction that they have the will or the firepower to undo the stalemate after the first three Tests ended in a draw. The only ones to have gained in the past one month are the batsmen and runs have been piled by tons. 

The wicket, true to groundsman Charlies words, has hardened and the green live grass has also begun to sprout at places. It is a pitch which encourages a fast bowler to mark out his run-up. 

Indias dilemma is clear: if they decide to stick to their four-bowler theory, one of the spinners would have to make way. Anil Kumble is the lynchpin but Harbhajan Singhs five wickets in Basseterre is a weighty matter too. His eight wickets in Indias previous Test at Sabina Park in 2002 also lends credence to his claims. 

If India wants to retain spinners and go with five bowlers, then one of the six top batsman could lose his spot. The worst case is that of Yuvraj Singh but the support for him within the team has been phenomenal. Captain Rahul Dravid, no less, views him as the best Indian batsman of the past season. There is no easy choice. 

The coming Test will also be illuminating on Rahul Dravid and his approach to captaincy. Put it down to weather or pitches or circumstances not in his control, but Dravid has somehow appeared shy of taking the bull by the horns. He works by calculated assaults rather than risk the unknown.

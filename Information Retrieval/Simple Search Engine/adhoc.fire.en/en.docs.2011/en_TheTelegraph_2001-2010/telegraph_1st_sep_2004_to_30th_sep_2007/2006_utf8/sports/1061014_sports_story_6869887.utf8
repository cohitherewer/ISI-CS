 IFA fined over Pariyar issue 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Gurgaon: The AIFF has slapped a fine on the IFA for fielding striker Vimal Pariyar in Bengal colours in the preliminary stages of the Santosh Trophy, held last month in Faridabad. 

Pariyar skipped the under-21 national camp despite being asked to join it, and instead, played for Bengal. He was top-scorer for Bengal with eight goals in Faridabad. 

The AIFF sources said that disciplinary committee of the federation, which met in the capital on Friday, also fined East Bengal club for holding back Pariyar and playing him in the crucial CFL Premier Division tie versus Mohun Bagan, instead of joining the national camp following Santosh Trophy preliminaries.

 Its time Sourav calls it a day, says Akram

 - Top sportsmen dont realise when they should say goodbye 

 Sourav 

Karachi: Sourav Ganguly need not be desperate to play for India and the time is right for the former captain to make a dignified exit from international cricket, according to Pakistan great Wasim Akram. 

The legendary allrounder said that Sourav did not have to prove anything more and that timing his retirement correctly would round off a successful career. 

Sourav has been an outstanding leader for India, but I think it is now time he should hang up his boots, he said. 

The former Pakistani captain said he had admiration for Sourav but was disappointed he had not taken the tough but right decision on his retirement. 

This is a problem in our part of the world. Top sportsmen dont realise when is the right time to say goodbye to the game, Akram, who finished with 414 Test and 502 one-day wickets said. 

I dont think he now stands a chance of getting selected again in the national team. There are some good young players coming up in the Indian team now. 

Sourav was again ignored by Indian selectors when they announced the ICC Champions Trophy squad on Sunday. Also missing was leg-spinner Anil Kumble who was suffering from tendonitis. 

Akram said Kumble definitely must be part of the Indian World Cup squad. 

He is a very difficult and experienced bowler especially on the type of pitches one should expect for the World Cup in the West Indies. He definitely must be in the team. 

On The Oval Test fiasco, Akram was clear that Pakistan should have continued to play after tea on the fourth day of the Test and should have protested against Darrell Hair and Billy Doctroves decision to change the ball in some other way. 

I also think they have delayed the hearing for Inzamam for too long. Pakistan should have called for an earlier hearing even if Ranjan (Madugalle) was not available. Lost time is not in favour of Pakistan. (PTI)

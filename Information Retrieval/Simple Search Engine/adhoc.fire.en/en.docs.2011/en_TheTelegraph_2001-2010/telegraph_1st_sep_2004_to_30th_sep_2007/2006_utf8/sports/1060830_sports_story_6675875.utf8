 Sandeep return 

 shouldnt be rushed

 Stickwork 

 Gurbux Singh

 Sandeep was crucial to Indias 

 World Cup strategy

Call 

 it an accident, disaster, voodoo or whatever you want, but 

 lets face it, the news of Sandeep Singh being shot 

 at, caught the Indian hockey in particular and the hoi 

 polloi in general, absolutely unawares.

 Not only does it land us in a 

 tricky situation, but the entire planning around the teams 

 preparation for the World Cup may now take a different dimension.

 Hockey is a team game, but you 

 do need some individual brilliance to make things happen. 

 Sandeep is a penalty-corner specialist and a big part of 

 Indias strategy in the forthcoming World Cup.

 Sandeep was the proverbial focus 

 boy in the four-team competition in Chennai, whose 

 concentration and determination was in harmony with his 

 self-confidence. Perhaps he was not as good as Jugraj, but 

 he was in his elements and appeared relieved in having cemented 

 his place in the team.

 Though Arjun Halappa converted 

 a couple of penalty corners in Chennai, we had no second 

 opinion as far as Sandeeps role in the team was concerned. 

 He occupied a significant part in Baskarans scheme 

 of things. His absence the way the team is going to miss 

 him, to be precise would surely affect the players psychologically 

 in Germany.

 Almost three years ago, we missed 

 the services of Jugraj ahead of the Asia Cup in Kuala Lumpur 

 when he was seriously injured in a car crash and hes 

 still struggling to get back his old flair. And now, we 

 have this freak accident of Sandeep. It cant be anything 

 but a curse on Indian hockey!

 I have spoken to the coach and 

 Sandeeps brother and my advice to him is that he should 

 not rush his comeback. If he is unavailable for the Doha 

 Asian Games in December, so be it. Sandeep is promising 

 to be an asset and we cant shorten his career by calling 

 for an early service.

 Jugraj, Bikramjit Singh and Raghunath 

 have already joined the Indian squad currently in Belgium 

 for some practice matches.

 Jugraj lacks international experience 

 since that ill-fated accident. He did play in the Professional 

 Hockey League in Chandigarh, and his comeback journey does 

 border on the extraordinary, but hes yet to return 

 to old form.

 Bikramjit is also inexperienced 

 in this context, while Raghunath is a promising youngster. 

 Of the three, Raghunath could be Sandeeps replacement, 

 but a decision on this should be taken as early as possible.

 We go into the World Cup after 

 playing a series of matches against Belgium, a German club 

 and Japan. It remains to be seen how these matches help 

 us before we actually start the campaign in the games 

 showpiece tournament in Germany.

 No doubt, we are in a difficult 

 group. We have to get the measure of two of the worlds 

 leading teams the hosts and Holland if we nurture any 

 ambition of advancing farther. Interestingly, we start with 

 Germany on September 6 and end the group stage against Holland 

 on September 12. In between, we have to deal with England, 

 South Africa and South Korea.

 Holland are undoubtedly one of 

 the tournament-favourites along with Australia and let me 

 admit that our chances against them are virtually nil. This 

 is why we need a proper strategy in surviving the group 

 stage.

 It would be interesting to note 

 how Sandeeps accident affects the teams performance 

 in Germany. It could either put the players morally and 

 psychologically down or it could generate a sense of togetherness 

 in the team. Lets hope the teams gets united and draw 

 strength from Sandeeps mishap.

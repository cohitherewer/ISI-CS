 Blatter on the offensive

 Zurich: Fifa president 

 Sepp Blatter launched an offensive against possible match-fixing 

 at the World Cup finals. He revealed that Fifa was initiating 

 a major anti-gambling strategy and will be asking referees 

 to pledge they will not place any bets at the World Cup 

 finals.

 Blatter told reporters he would 

 personally address all the 23 referees selected. They 

 will all sign papers to say that they, and their families, 

 will never be involved in any betting or other similar problems, 

 he said.

 shape before the World Cup finals. I feel sharp and 

 ready to go, he said.

 Landis wants doping charges dismissed 

 Floyd Landis 

Raleigh (US): Tour de France winner Floyd Landis asked a US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) review board on Monday to dismiss doping charges against him. 

The details of the submission support Landiss long-held innocence and argue that tests conducted on the athletes A and B urine sample from stage 17 of the Tour de France do not meet the established World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for a positive doping offence, said a statement released by Landiss publicist on behalf of his attorney Howard Jacobs. 

The single (positive) T/E (Testosterone/Epitestosterone) analysis in this case is replete with fundamental, gross errors, the statement added. 

The statement said three of the four testosterone metabolite differentials tested in Landiss sample are reported as negative considering the margin of error. 

The one metabolite that has been identified by WADA-accredited laboratories as the best, and longest-term indicator, of exogenous testosterone usage was reported as negative in Landiss urine samples, the statement said. 

Landis tested positive for the male sex hormone following his stunning comeback in stage 17 that put him on course for victory in the Tour de France. He has repeatedly denied taking performance-enhancing drugs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 It appears the thinktank read wicket wrong, says Wadekar

 - Dravid decision came as a surprise, says Strauss 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Sreesanth celebrates after scalping Kevin Pietersen on Saturday 

Mumbai: England, it seems, are most competitive when saddled with a major problem on the eve of a Test. The visitors were outstanding in Nagpur, despite the drama which preceded that first face-off, but fell flat in Mohali to trail 0-1. 

If losing Steve Harmison wasnt a big enough blow in the lead-up to the third and final Test (at the Wankhede), England had to cap Middlesexs Owais Shah at the last minute after Alastair Cook (a centurion on debut, Nagpur) pulled out with Mumbai-belly symptoms. 

Yet, by stumps, the visitors were on a pretty decent 272 for three. If that came as a bit of a surprise, the bigger one was when Rahul Dravid chose not to bat. 

Having packed his XI with three new ball bowlers (Irfan Pathan, Sreesanth and Munaf Patel), Dravid probably had no choice. But, then, the composition of the XI comes into question as V.V.S. Laxman again had to sit out. 

It appears the thinktank read the wicket wrong... If I had to play five bowlers, I would have picked three spinners and most certainly have batted... Unless, the circumstances are extraordinary, its best to make first use of the wickets in India, former captain (and coach) Ajit Wadekar told The Telegraph. 

In fact, even opener Andrew Strauss (who ended a dismal run in the subcontinent with a fine, though not chanceless, 128) acknowledged they were surprised. We would have batted, but didnt expect to be put in, he said. 

The left-hander had poor scores ? highest being 23 in four Test innings ? on the tour of Pakistan, late last year, and didnt score very many in the first two Tests of the onging series either. A big one, therefore, was due. 

This (eighth) hundred took a little while coming... There are lots of things to learn in the sub-continent, patience being one of them... I didnt try to dominate too much and, yes, was conscious about the shots to play, he remarked. 

The Johannesburg-born Strauss also accepted not feeling great in recent times as the runs werent coming in the numbers he would have liked. Its important to keep working hard... That done, things look after themselves... Of course, in the subcontinent, its important to work out a method, he added. 

Strauss picked Munaf for special mention ? he bowled a couple of good spells when the ball was old... The breakthrough, however, came from Sreesanth. And, having got the centurion, Harbhajan Singhs confidence is bound to grow. 

The wicket does have some bounce and conditions did help both the conventional and reverse swing. No demons, but its all about exploiting to the fullest... 

Team Indias catching, though, has to improve: Dravid dropped Strauss (off Harbhajan) on 92, Mahendra Singh Dhoni couldnt hold on with the opener on 123. Anil Kumble had to suffer then. 

 Hoggard may stay 

 Meanwhile, with there being a question mark over Harmison, 

 Matthew Hoggard is expected to stay back for the seven ODIs.

 SHARAD PAWAR 

 PRAISE FOR RAHUL DRAVID

 Rahul Dravid is felicitated 

 by BCCI president Sharad Pawar at the Wankhede on Saturday. 

 (PTI)

 The Board of Control for Cricket 

 in India president, Sharad Pawar, had much praise for captain 

 Rahul Dravid when he made his 100th Test appearance, at 

 the Wankhede, on Saturday.

 The following is the text of Pawars 

 statement:

 Hearty congratulations to 

 you on reaching a personal milestone of hundred Test appearances 

 for India.

 We in the BCCI place on 

 record your outstanding contribution to Indian cricket ever 

 since your debut in 1996.

 Your international career 

 started on a sedate note, but with every Test you played, 

 you matured and exhibited in abundance the qualities of 

 discipline, commitment and focus, which has helped you carve 

 a niche for yourself as one of the worlds best batsman.

 You are a quiet and humble person who conducts himself 

 with grace and dignity on and off the field.

 You have been a perfect 

 ambassador for India and the game of cricket and the recent 

 honour bestowed on you by the United Nations is another 

 feather in your cap.

 You have always given your best to the Indian team, 

 whether it was playing as a wicketkeeper-batsman in one-day 

 Internationals or helping the Indian team recover from early 

 setbacks while batting.

 You have been in excellent 

 form over the last few seasons, as is reflected by your 

 batting averages. You were rightfully adjudged as the Test 

 Player of the Year and the Player of the Year by the ICC 

 in 2004.

 I am sure that the younger 

 generation in this country looks up to you as a role model 

 particularly to adopt your determination to do well and 

 your work ethics.

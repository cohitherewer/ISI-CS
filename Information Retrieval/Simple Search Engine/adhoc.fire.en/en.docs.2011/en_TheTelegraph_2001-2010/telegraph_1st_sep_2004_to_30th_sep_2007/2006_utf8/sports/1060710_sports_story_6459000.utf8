The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dodd claims title, Jeev tied fourth

 European Open

 Kildare: Britains 

 Stephen Dodd recorded his third European Tour success and 

 his first of the season when he took the European Open by 

 two strokes on Sunday.

 Welshman Dodd, 39, birdied two 

 of the last three holes in the final round, to shoot a two-under-par 

 70 in high winds at the K Club, totalling nine-under 279.

 He finished ahead of the overnight 

 leader Jose Manuel Lara of Spain and another Briton, Anthony 

 Wall.

 Irelands Paul McGinley boosted 

 his Ryder Cup hopes by birdieing three of the last four 

 holes to shoot a 69 and finish a further stroke back, with 

 Britons Lee Westwood, Simon Khan and Graeme Storm and Indias 

 Jeev Milkha Singh finishing tied fourth. Jeev had a two-under-par 

 70, totalling 282.

 Jyoti Randhawa finished tied 61, 

 with a final round score of six-over 78 for a total of nine-over 

 297 for the meet.

 Even though Dodd, like most, dropped 

 early shots in the blustery conditions, he stayed well in 

 contention and two birdies in three holes around the turn 

 kept him on Laras shoulder.

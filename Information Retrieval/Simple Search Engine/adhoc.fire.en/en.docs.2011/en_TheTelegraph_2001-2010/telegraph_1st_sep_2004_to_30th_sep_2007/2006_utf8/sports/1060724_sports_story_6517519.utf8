 Chopra, Atwal move up

 BC Open

 New York: Arjun Atwal sparkled 

 with a second eagle in three days to be tied 24th, while 

 Daniel Chopra fired five birdies to occupy tied 15th place 

 at the $3 million BC Open on a rain-hit day at the Atunyote 

 Golf Club course.

 Atwals eagle at two on the 

 par-4 ninth for the second time in three days brought him 

 a card of three-under 69.

 Chopra, who climbed up from tied 

 27th, is now at nine-under 207 for the tournament. Atwal, 

 from overnight 39th, is seven-under 209.

 Gabriel Hjertstedt of Sweden hit 

 a four-under 68 to take a one-shot lead. Hjertstedt, the 

 first Swede to win on the PGA Tour when he captured the 

 1997 BC Open, was at 14-under 202. He is attempting to join 

 two other two-time winners ? Joey Sindelar (1985, 1987) 

 and Brad Faxon (1999, 2000).

 First-round leader Mark Brooks 

 (66), who shot a 72 on Friday, was tied for second with 

 David Branshaw (68), and Scott Gump (69).

 Sitting just three shots back 

 at 11-under 205 were four players led by Larry Mize, the 

 1987 Masters champion, who returned an error-free five-under 

 67 to move into contention. (AGENCIES)

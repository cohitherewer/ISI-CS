 Zlatan may miss tie vs England

Bremen: Striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic could miss Swedens Group B finale against England on Tuesday because of a groin injury, Sweden team doctor Anders Valentin said on Friday. 

The Juventus striker was injured during warm-up before Swedens 1-0 win Thursday over Paraguay in Berlin. He left the pitch at halftime and was replaced by Marcus Allback, who set up Fredrik Ljungbergs matchwinner in the 89th minute. 

We are a little bit worried about him for the England match, Valentin said. 

Meanwhile, Switzerland defender Valon Behrami has been ruled out of Mondays match against Togo because of groin muscle inflammation. 

Team doctors will decide in the coming days whether Behrami will have to quit the World Cup altogether, said team spokesman Pierre Benoit.

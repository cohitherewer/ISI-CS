 Lance to make debut in New York

 Marathon

 London: Seven-time Tour 

 de France champion Lance Armstrong will make his marathon 

 debut in the New York race on November 5, New York Road 

 Runners president Mary Wittenberg said on Thursday.

 Armstrong, 34, set his record 

 winning streak after he had been diagnosed with cancer and 

 given less than a 50 per cent chance of survival.

 I was thrilled to learn 

 late last night of Lances decision to run the New 

 York City marathon, Wittenberg said in a statement. 

 A bit like winning the lottery after you thought you 

 had lost.

 Lance epitomises both the 

 American spirit and the spirit of the marathon, and it is 

 no surprise that his drive, motivation and focus lead him 

 to his next challenge.

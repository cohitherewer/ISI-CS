The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Velvet Rope knocks out favourites 

 PRAVESH GUPTA

 Mumbai: Mumbai: Friendless Velvet Rope turned out to be a horse with an iron punch when the Vinayak-trainee knocked out the fancied runners in the 2,400m McDowell Indian Derby at the Mahalaxmi race course on Sunday. P. Kamlesh, who partnered the got-abroad horse to victory, scored his first Derby win, while it was third for Vinayak. 

 The winner, a Turtle Island-Truffa son, also bettered the course record over the Derby trip by 0.6 second. The record was earlier held by Starsky, who had clocked 2 minutes 30 seconds in the 2002 Derby.

 It was a close contest with the runaway Bangalore Derby winner, Holding Court, finishing only half-a-length behind after going stride for stride with the eventual winner. The public-rage Mystical, too, added excitement to the finish in the last furlong but the 8-10 favourite looked to be tiring in the last 100m to finish a further length and-a-half behind. 

 The Calcutta filly Romantic Liaison was simply outclassed after raising hopes upfront till a furlong from home. She was a poor fourth.

 The record timing of 2 minutes and 27.4 seconds clocked by the winner indicates that the early pace in the race was cracking. Admirals Force, the stablemate of the favourite, ensured it with a runaway lead but the strategy followed by jockey C.Alford for a serious Derby contender like Romantic Liaison, surprised many in the crowd. Alford made the Liaison chase the leader from the start. The filly did take over the running at the top of the turn but she found herself out of steam passing the distance-post when Holding Court, Mystical and Velvet Rope came alongside. 

 To say that jockey Kamlesh rode a well-judged race would be demeaning the effort of the winner. The horse looked beaten inside the 100m when jockey N. McCullagh brought Holding Court alongside. But Velvet Rope recharged his batteries in a trice to get the measure of his rival in the final three strides, which were long enough to seal the verdict by half-a-length. 

 There was no hard-luck story for the favourite. Mystical had some problem before arriving here from Bangalore but the Alnasr Alwasheek-Mystic Memories son had beaten Democraticus, also a Derby contestant, and Velvet Rope in his preparatory race, the 2,000m Ramnivas Ramnarain Ruia Cup. However, his margin of victory in that race was hardly convincing. More importantly, Velvet Rope stayed the Derby trip more comfortably than Mystical while Democraticus failed miserably.

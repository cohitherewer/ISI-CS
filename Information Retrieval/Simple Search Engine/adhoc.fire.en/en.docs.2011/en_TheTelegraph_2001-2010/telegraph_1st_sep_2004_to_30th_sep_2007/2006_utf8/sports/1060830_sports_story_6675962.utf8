 ICC advice sought over Inzys selection 

Karachi: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is to seek advice from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over whether to select captain Inzamam-ul Haq for the Champions Trophy, a senior official said on Tuesday. 

The ICC has directed all member countries to announce their final 14-man squads for the tournament by September 7. 

Inzamam is due to appear before an ICC disciplinary hearing after the tour of England ends on September 10 to face charges of ball tampering and bringing the game into disrepute, following the The Oval Test fiasco. 

The 36-year-old Inzamam, who has played 113 Tests and 362 one-day Internationals, faces a ban of up to eight one-dayers and four Tests if found guilty of both charges, effectively ruling him out of the Champions Trophy which starts in India in early October. 

This is a very pertinent issue for us. We want to know from ICC what happens if we pick him in our final Champions Trophy squad, director of cricket operations Saleem Altaf said. 

Our selectors want to know if they are allowed to replace him if he is banned after being named in the squad, Altaf said. 

Dont forget besides being captain he also a key player for us. He rates high in the planning for the tournament. 

It is a problem for us. At this stage we dont even know when the ICC will schedule the hearing, Altaf said.

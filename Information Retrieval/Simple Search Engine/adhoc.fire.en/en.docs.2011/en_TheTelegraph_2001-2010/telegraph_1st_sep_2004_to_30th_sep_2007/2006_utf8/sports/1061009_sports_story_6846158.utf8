 Flintoff will be an inspiration: Steve

Sydney: Australian great Steve Waugh feels Andrew Flintoff will be an inspiration as England seek to hold on to the Ashes in this years five-Test series in Australia. 

Flintoff was preferred ahead of opening batsman Andrew Strauss to captain Englands Ashes defence despite not having played since ankle surgery in July. 

Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney says an important reason for Flintoffs selection was that his panel believed the Aussies feared him. Waugh believes Flintoff gives England an extra dimension: genuine inspiration. 

Why not pick Andrew Flintoff? he wrote in his newspaper column on Sunday. The players respect him and one of the most important things is that he wants to do the job. 

Hes an inspirational player, hes a great all-rounder and I have no doubt hell be leading them with the idea theyre here to fight. I know theyll follow him into battle. (AFP)

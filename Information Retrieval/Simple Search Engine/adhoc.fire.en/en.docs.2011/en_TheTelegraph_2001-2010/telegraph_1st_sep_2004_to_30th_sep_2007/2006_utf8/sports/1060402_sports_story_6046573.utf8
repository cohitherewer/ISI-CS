 We will bounce back: Blackwell

 - Fletcher leaves for home, to return tomorrow

Margao: Ian Blackwell is confident England will bounce back in the seven-match ODI series against India despite trailing 0-2. 

On reflection, we thought we should have won both the games, the left-arm spinner told a news conference on Saturday. Perhaps if we performed a little better, and were a little more ruthless, then we could have probably been in a different position going into the third game. 

The third of the seven ODIs is on Monday. 

We have assessed the last couple of games and how people gave their wickets away and how we bowled at certain people. There are some things that we will have to rectify. You know, the small tweaks, and we are more than capable of turning things around. 

Blackwell, who displayed fine control in both matches, does not think the tourists were a spinner short on a slow and low pitch in Faridabad where the hosts chased 227 for victory. 

I think it was more of a case of one of your guys playing out of the skin and producing a match-winning partnership with (Mahendra Singh) Dhoni to clinch the game rather than us missing a second spinner, he said. 

Meanwhile, a virgin square is in the offing for the match at the Nehru Stadium. The ground had been taken over by the Goa Cricket Association (GCA) on January 9 and no National Football League matches have been held during this period. 

Meanwhile, England coach Duncan Fletcher flew back home to accompany his sick wife and would join the squad on Monday. 

Fletcher has gone to South Africa to drop his wife who is sick, English teams media manager James Avery said. The coach would not be able to join the squad before Monday, he added.

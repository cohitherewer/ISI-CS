 Lara puts team ahead of self

Multan: Brian Lara said Tuesday he was more interested in extending the lead against Pakistan in the second Test rather than going for his third triple century. 

I am not necessarily looking at a triple century...it is all about getting a couple more partnerships to put Pakistan under pressure, Lara said. 

I dont look at my innings in a personal context. What matters is we are in a good position and we try to finish it off well. If that happens it would add value to my runs. 

Lara played several savage strokes and was particularly severe on Danish Kaneria, hammering the leg spinner for 26 in one over with three sixes and two fours. 

I knew we needed to target someone with the second new ball coming up, said the 37-year-old left hander. 

But there was nothing going on in my mind facing him, I just watched the flight and concentrated playing through mid-on and mid-off. 

I am very enthusiastic every time I go out and I want to do well. I want to see the West Indies do well and I have the energy and desire to carry on, he added. (Agencies)

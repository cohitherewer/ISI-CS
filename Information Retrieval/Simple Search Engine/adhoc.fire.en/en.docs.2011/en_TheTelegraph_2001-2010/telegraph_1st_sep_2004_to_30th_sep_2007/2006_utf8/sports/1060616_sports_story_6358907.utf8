The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ronaldo will soon deliver, says Bhutia

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Bhaichung Bhutia says too much shouldnt be read into Ronaldos below-par performance against Croatia. 

It was just a bad day in office. Hell deliver in the next matches, he said of the Brazilian striker. The world champions managed a 1-0 win in the World Cup campaign-opener, with Kaka firing in a left-footed winner. 

Bhutia feels India need more international exposure if they want to become a major force in the future and should take a leaf out of the African book. 

Look at teams like Angola and Togo. They are now playing in the World Cup because the players get good exposure abroad. The AIFF should ensure such trips more often if we are to do well in the international arena, Bhaichung said, soon after signing for Mohun Bagan at the IFA office on Thursday. 

Bhaichung urged the national federation to give coach Bob Houghton quality time to settle down. Instead of hurrying to assess any coach, we need to look at how best our plans for future can be implemented. Houghton can deliver if he is given time.

 Wie misses cut

Crans-Sur-Sierre (Switzerland): Michelle Wie struggled to an 8-over 79 at the European Masters on Friday, missing the cut at a mens event for the ninth time in 10 attempts. 

The 16-year-old from Hawaii, who shot a 78 in Thursdays first round, finished at 15-over 157. Wie ran up double-bogey 7s on successive par-5s. 

I didnt even know which sport I was playing out there, she said. My bunker play was better and I putted better. But I wish I had a little more feel for the game before I came here. It was not my day. 

The only time Wie has survived the halfway cut in a mens event was at the SK Telecom Open in South Korea earlier this year, where she finished 12 shots off the lead. 

Laura Davies is the only other woman to play on the European tour, finishing next to last in the 2004 ANZ Championship in Sydney. 

Wie will play against the men against next week in the 84 Lumber Classic on the US Tour. 

Her previous worst round in a mens tournament came this year in the Sony Open in Hawaii, where she opened with a 9-over 79. She had a 68 in the second round but still missed the cut.

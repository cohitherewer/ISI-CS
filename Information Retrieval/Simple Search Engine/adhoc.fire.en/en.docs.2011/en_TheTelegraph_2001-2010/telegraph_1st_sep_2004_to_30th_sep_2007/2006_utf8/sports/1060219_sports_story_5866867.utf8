 Jharkhand eye bonus point

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhanbad: Jharkhand will take on Assam in the last match of East Zone One-dayers meet at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Sunday. 

With chances of Jharkhand qualifying for the next round of meet becoming brighter after Bengals maiden defeat at the hands of Assam on Friday, the hosts not only did a rigorous practice but also had a brainstorming session chalking out the strategy. 

If we manage to score a bonus point against Assam and keep our run-rate high there is every possibility to make it to the next round. We may get chance even after Bengal manage to win, said Jharkhand officials. 

They further pointed out that some of the bowlers and batsmen including captain Rajiv Kumar Raja have performed well in the last three matches.

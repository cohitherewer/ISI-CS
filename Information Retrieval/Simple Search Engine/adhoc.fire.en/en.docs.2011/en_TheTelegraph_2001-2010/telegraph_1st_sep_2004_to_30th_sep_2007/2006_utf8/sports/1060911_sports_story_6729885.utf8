 Indians arrive

Kuala Lumpur: The Indian team arrived here on Sunday for the tri-series against the West Indies and Australia, starting on September 12. 

The Rahul Dravid-led squad touched down in the wee hours and is scheduled to have a practice session on Monday. The Indians will play their first match against the West Indies on September 14 while world champions Australia and the West Indies lock horns in the opener. 

Each team will play the other twice with the top two playing the final on September 24. All the matches of the tournament would be played at the new Kinrara Oval ground. 

The tournament, the first of its kind to be held in Malaysia, will give an opportunity to the three teams to test their skills before the Champions Trophy in India. 

The tri-series is an offshore project for India as they have financed the tournament in its entirety, BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah said. 

Meanwhile, the BCCI is planning to hire renowned sports psychologist Rudi Webster to help the team prepare for the World Cup. According to Shah, the proposal had come from Greg Chappell and Dravid.

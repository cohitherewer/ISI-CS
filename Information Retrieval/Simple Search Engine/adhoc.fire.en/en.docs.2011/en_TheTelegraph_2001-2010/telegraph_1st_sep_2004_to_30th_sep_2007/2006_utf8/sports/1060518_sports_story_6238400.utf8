 India notch up 116-run win

Montego Bay: The Indians served notice of their talent and form in their tour-opener here on Wednesday, notching up a convincing 116-run win over Jamaica Cricket Association (JCA) XI. 

While Raina, who eventually retired hurt for 50, impressed with his clever manipulation of the field and powerful flicks down the onside, Kaif also played a busy innings and essayed a few pleasing drives down the ground. 

Mahendra Singh Dhoni smashed four fours and three sixes in his 45 from 23 balls.

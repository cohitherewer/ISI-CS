 Andhra Pradesh hold Manipur goalless 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gurgaon: Strong contenders Manipur suffered a mild setback in Cluster V of the Santosh Trophy when they were held to a goalless draw by Andhra Pradesh on Sunday. 

With top stars like Surkumar Singh, Rennedy Singh and Bijen Singh in their ranks, the 2002 champions were expected to have an easy time against Andhra Pradesh. But coached by former India captain Mohammed Habib, Andhra put up a lively fight and could have gone ahead in the first half. Striker Mohammed Qaiser missed the opportunity when he shot over from close. 

In the second half, Manipur did a better job but could not score. Mohammed Ali Khan had a good day and thwarted two attempts from Bijen and Narendra Meetei. 

Manipur now have four points from two matches and will play Chhattisgarh in their last match. Andhra have two points from two outings. In the same cluster, Chhattisgarh routed Himachal Pradesh 7-0 to take their tally to four. Kulwant Singh (2), Ramchandra Murmu (2), Abid Khan, Subir Majhi and Tajuddin scored. 

In Cluster VII, Delhi beat Orissa 4-2, thanks Sunil Chhetri, who scored a hattrick. Praveen Rawat was the other marksman. For Orissa, Antu Murmu and Manabesh Mohanty twice restored parity before Delhi ran them over. In the same group, Jammu and Kashmir played goalless with Railways.

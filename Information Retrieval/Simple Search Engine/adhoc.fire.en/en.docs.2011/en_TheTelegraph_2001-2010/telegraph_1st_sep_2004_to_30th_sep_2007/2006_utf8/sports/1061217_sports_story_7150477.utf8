 Tiger Woods grabs lead

California: Tiger Woods, boosted by two monster birdie putts, grabbed the lead from overnight pacesetter Henrik Stenson in the Target World Challenge second round on Friday. 

The world number one holed out from 40 feet at the ninth and from 50 feet at the 10th on his way to a four-under-par 68 at Sherwood Country Club. That left him at eight-under 136, one ahead of Swede Stenson who carded an eventful 71. 

Geoff Ogilvy of Australia returned a 70 to join Chris DiMarco (68) in third place at six under with Britains Paul Casey (70) a further stroke back in fifth. (REUTERS)

Sydney: Australia completed a 5-0 whitewash of Belarus in their Davis Cup quarter final by winning Sundays two dead singles matches in straight sets at Kooyong in Melbourne. 

Wayne Arthurs defeated Sergui Tarasevitch 7-6, 6-2 and Chris Guccione completed the rout with a crushing 6-1, 6-3 win over Belarussian rookie Alexandr Zotov. 

Australia had already wrapped up their first ever tie with Belarus and booked their fifth semi-final appearance in eight years by winning Fridays opening singles matches and Saturdays doubles. 

Lleyton Hewitt was originally due to play Max Mirnyi in the first reverse singles but both teams agreed to substitute their No.1 players in the shortened best-of-three sets matches. 

Australia will now play either defending champions Croatia or Argentina in Septembers semi-finals. 

Australia will get home court advantage if Croatia win but face the daunting prospect of travelling to South America if Argentina win. 

Arthurs teamed up with Paul Hanley to win an epic five-set doubles match and held his nerve to win the opening set against Tarasevitch in a tiebreak, then rode his booming serve to race through the second and seal victory in 80 minutes. 

Guccione was even more impressive, needing just 45 minutes to continue his meteoric rise in Australian tennis. 

Meanwhile in Zagreb, Croatias top-ranked player and captain Ivan Ljubicic brushed aside world No. 3 David Nalbandian 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 to haul the Davis Cup holders level at 2-2 with Argentina in their quarter final on Sunday. 

World No.5 Ljubicic served a total of 35 aces and won 83 per cent of the points on his first serve to blow away Nalbandian who committed a string of unforced errors and struggled to cope with the Croatians baseline power. 

In Pau, France, Nikolay Davydenko pulled out of his Davis Cup quarter final singles match against Frenchman Richard Gasquet through injury and will be replaced by Dmitry Tursunov, the Russian team said on Sunday. 

Davydenko complained of hip pains following his four-set victory over Arnaud Clement in the opening singles on Friday. Russia lead the tie 2-1 going into reverse singles.

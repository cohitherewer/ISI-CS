Ahmedabad: The Diwali break is over, the Indians are down to serious business. There is no hangover and the players have resumed their campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy with renewed vigour and enthusiasm. 

On Monday, they played a practice game with a local side but the contest was mainly restricted to the top-order batsmen against the frontline bowlers. If Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravids form did come in for some relief to Greg Chappell, Virender Sehwags failure to make an impact is sure to keep him worried. 

Not wanting to waste time, Chappell spent some time with the vice-captain. The shadow practice lessons should do Sehwags confidence a world of good. There, however, are no immediate plans to change the opening combination as witnessed in the match against England. 

Suresh Raina, though, may not be so lucky. Having been dismissed for a duck in the first match, he was again unimpressive, failing to judge Ramesh Powars flighted delivery Monday. It is now more or less certain that Dinesh Mongia will take Rainas place in the team against the West Indies on Thursday. 

Rainas inclusion in the Jaipur match did raise a few eyebrows since the Punjab left-hander had come good in the final game of the Kuala Lumpur tri-series. 

West Indies are still sweating over the fitness of Brian Lara. The West Indies captain had a side strain while batting against Australia and has not recovered fully. He did not bat at nets Monday, and limited himself to stretching exercises. 

Though the official line is that he is recovering well, the sources said that thinktank is unlikely to risk him if he doesnt recover fully. 

For the visitors, the good news is that Shivnarine Chanderpaul has recovered fully from food poisoning and Corey Collymore will be back Tuesday. 

Speaking to the Media, coach Bennett King was all praise for Clive lloyd. He has been very good. He tells the boys stories from when he played, and is now helping around in the nets, he said. Lloyd gives his ideas to the players. I certainly encourage him to keep talking to the players and keep teaching them about things that happened in the past. It certainly helps players to learn about cricket history. 

King wants to reduce the unpredictability that is associated with the West Indies cricket and felt that hunger for success would drive his players against the Indians. 

Meanwhile, Runako Morton said that he wants to keep the momentum going and make full use of the confidence gained from his Mumbai innings.

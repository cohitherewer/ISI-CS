The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 IN THE CITY

 One of the three young left-arm spinners Michael Behera, Anirban Gupta and Amit Banerjee may get a look in when the selectors meet here on Tuesday to select the CAB squad for the Moin-ud-Dowla Gold Cup commencing in Hyderabad on September 2. 

 According to a CAB source, Murtaza Lodhgar and Shiv Sagar Singh are in England while Anirban Chatterjee is down with typhoid. Hence the need for a left-arm spinner.

 CAB would also miss the services of Subhamoy Das, who would side with employer BSNL in the same meet. CAB XI would open their campaign on September 6 against Mumbai Cricket Association XI. Sourav Ganguly will be offered the captaincy. In case he denies, Deep Dasgupta will don the captains mantle. Kick-boxing expert Montu Das may be added as part of the support staff.

 Bengal duo Ritam Kundu and Abhijit Sikdar will do their duties for Railways in the Hyderabad meet.

 The East Bengal-Mohadmmedan Sporting match, which was scheduled on Wednesday, has been postponed and it will be held instead on September 8. It was unanimously decided in the IFA meeting that there will be no change in the fixture. Now how can it be changed? We will lodge a protest, Mohammedan Sporting secretary Sultan Ahmed said. We have called a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the issue, he added.

 Kalighat MS routed Behala Youth 6-1 in a Sahara CFL first division group B match at the Howrah Stadium on Monday. Two matches BNR versus Anushilani and Bata versus Sporting Union were abandoned due to bad light.

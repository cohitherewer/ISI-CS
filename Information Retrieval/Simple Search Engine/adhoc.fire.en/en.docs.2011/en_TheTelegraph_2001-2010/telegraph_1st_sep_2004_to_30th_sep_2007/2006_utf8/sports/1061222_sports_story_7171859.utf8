 Vaughan returns, England delay naming ODI captain 

 Harmison retires from ODIs 

Sydney: Michael Vaughan has been included in a 16-man England squad for their upcoming limited-overs series with Australia and New Zealand pending a fitness report, but there is still no decision on who captain the side. 

Left-arm spinner Monty Panesar was called up to make his one-day debut while fast bowler Steve Harmison announced he was retiring from the abbreviated form of the game after being overlooked for selection. 

Test wicketkeeper Geraint Jones also missed out with Chris Read and Leicestershires Paul Nixon both picked ahead of him in a series of changes to the squad that failed at the Champions Trophy. 

Englands chairman of selectors David Graveney said a decision on the captain had been delayed until after the Ashes Test series finishes in early January. 

Allrounder Andrew Flintoff has been skippering the side during the Ashes in the absence of regular skipper Vaughan, who faces a fitness test before playing. 

Harmison, 28, decided to quit after being left out of the triangular series, which is Englands last tournament before next years World Cup in the West Indies. 

This has been a difficult decision but I want to play at the highest level for as long as I can and believe that concentrating solely on test cricket is the best way forward for me, he said. 

ENGLAND SQUAD: James Anderson, Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood, James Dalrymple, Andrew Flintoff, Ed Joyce, Jon Lewis, Sajid Mahmood, Paul Nixon, Monty Panesar, Kevin Pietersen, Liam Plunkett, Chris Read, Andrew Strauss, Chris Tremlett, Michael Vaughan.

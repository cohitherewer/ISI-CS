 Jack set to replace Hislop vs Paraguay

Rotenburg: Kelvin Jack looks set to start in goal for Trinidad and Tobago against Paraguay on Tuesday, with Shaka Hislop dropping to the bench, sources within the camp said on Sunday. 

Jack was picked ahead of Hislop for his countrys opening Group B game against Sweden, but injured himself in the warm-up and was replaced by the West Ham keeper. 

A Man-of-the-Match performance by Hislop in the scoreless draw against the Swedes meant he kept his place between the posts for the 0-2 defeat to Eng- land. 

But Trinidad coach, Leo Beenhakker is set to return to his original No. 1. 

Leo likes Kelvin a lot and would probably like to give him a run out in the tournament, a source said.

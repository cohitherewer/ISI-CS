Calcutta: L. Bombayla Devi on Wednesday entered into the sporting history of Manipur. In the womens recurve final of the Olympic individual round, she upset Sumangala of Uttar Pradesh 111-99 points and became the first Manipur girl to win a senior national archery title. 

Bombayla Devi, thus, capped a fine day after scalping two heavyweights, Sushma and Dola Banerjee in the semi-finals and quarter finals, respectively. In the final, held at the SAI Eastern Centre, Sumangala showed signs of uneasiness and lost concentration having missed the targets at crucial times. The Manipuri girl, on the other hand, rose to the occasion and completely outshone her fancied rival. 

If the day will be remembered for Bombayla Devis history-scripting performance, Santosh Tamangs was a tale of sheer frustration. The SSCB archer erased Vivek Kumars national record (113) by scoring 117 in the quarter finals of the senior compound mens event. Vivek was the defending champion but could not participate due to illness. 

In the final, Santosh then waged a brave fight against Jayantilal Nanoma of Rajasthan and both settled for 110 points out of the maximum 120. In the tie-breaker, Jayantilal, however, pipped him to the title with a 9-8 verdict in his favour. 

The day also saw another record being scripted by Manjudha Soy in the senior compound womens event. In the semi-finals, the Jharkhand girls score of 117 (en route to beating Niva Karketta) was one point better than Jhanu Hansdas mark, set in the last nationals in Ernakulam. 

In the final, Manjudha got the better of her JAA mate Renu Munda by 116-104 points. Jhanu finished third. 

Meanwhile, Jayanta Talukdar retained the mens curve title, beating Uttar Pradesh rival Vishwash by 112-107 points. Their statemate Rahul Banerjee ? who is the brother of Dola and who obliterated Limba Rams long-standing record on Tuesday, won the bronze.

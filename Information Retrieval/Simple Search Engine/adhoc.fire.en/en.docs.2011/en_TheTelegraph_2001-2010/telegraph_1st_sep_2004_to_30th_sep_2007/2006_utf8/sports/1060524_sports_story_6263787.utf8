 Quick Takes

 FA not likely to block Venables return 

 London: The FA is unlikely 

 to block Steve McClarens bid to bring Terry Venables 

 back into the England set-up. McClaren, who takes over from 

 Sven-Goran Eriksson after the World Cup finals, has identified 

 Venables as the ideal man to work alongside him on the international 

 scene. 

 Venables has also had talks with 

 Middlesbrough chairman Steve Gibson and McClaren is concerned 

 that his old club, also been linked with Martin Neill 

 and Alan Curbishley, could beat him in the race for the 

 63-year-old. 

 Venables, out of the game for 

 three years, may prefer to rejoin England, where it will 

 be easier for him to marry the job to his other business 

 interests and television work. 

 Pope of Polish 

 football dies

 Warsaw: Former Poland soccer 

 coach Kazimierz Gorski, who led the country to a third-place 

 finish at the 1974 World Cup and Olympic gold, has died 

 at the age of 85, it was reported on Tuesday. Gorski coached 

 the national team from 1970 to 1976, overseeing the golden 

 era of Polish football.

 I dont think I am 

 offending anyone by saying that he was the Pope of Polish 

 football, said former goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski, 

 whose heroic saves against England at Wembley took Gorskis 

 team to the 1974 World Cup. He was a second father 

 to me. For what we achieved with him, he will live in my 

 heart forever.

 Rosicky joins Arsenal 

 London: Czech Republic 

 midfielder Tomas Rosicky joined Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund 

 on Tuesday. The 25-year-old has signed a long-term contract 

 for an undisclosed fee, the Arsenal website reported without 

 giving further details. The attacking midfielder is a key 

 member of the Czech World Cup squad. 

 Ruud in no rush to move on

 London: Ruud van Nistelrooy 

 insists his future will not be decided until after the World 

 Cup. Although the prolific Dutchman is adamant his love 

 for Manchester United remains undiminished, his chances 

 of appearing for the Old Trafford outfit again remain bleak 

 following his stunning end-of-season bust-up with Sir Alex 

 Ferguson. 

 Nothing is going to happen 

 until after the World Cup, he said. I have two 

 years left on my contract and if things stay the way they 

 are at the moment I will still be at the club next season. 

 But I am not naive. 

 Not-so-sweet honeymoon

 Madrid: Spain goalkeeper 

 Pepe Reina has admitted there has been a downside to his 

 decision to get married last week before joining the squad. 

 Im very happy with my new status, but now Im 

 going to have to spend my honeymoon with 22 other blokes, 

 he was quoted as saying on Tuesday.

 Reina married girlfriend Yolanda 

 Ruiz in the southern Spanish city of Cordoba last Friday.

 Freddie needs rest: Doctor

 Stockholm: Sweden midfielder 

 Freddie Ljungberg would be better off resting during the 

 group stage of the World Cup to fully recover from a foot 

 injury, says team doctor Anders Valentin. He would 

 need to rest for four weeks to completely recover, 

 he said.He might not be completely without symptoms 

 (at the finals).

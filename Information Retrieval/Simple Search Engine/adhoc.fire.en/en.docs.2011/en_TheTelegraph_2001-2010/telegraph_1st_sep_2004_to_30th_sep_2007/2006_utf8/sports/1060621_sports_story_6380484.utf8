 Lanka go 2-0 up

London: Sanath Jayasuriya scored his 20th ODI century and took the vital wicket of Kevin Pietersen to inspire Sri Lanka to a 46-run win on Tuesday that gave them a 2-0 lead in the five-match series versus England. 

Jayasuriyas 122 off 136 balls, full of trademark uppercuts over point and gully, set the foundation for the tourists 319 at The Oval before England. England slumped to 273 all out in the 47th over. Pietersen made 73 off 76 balls but his departure sealed the home sides fate.

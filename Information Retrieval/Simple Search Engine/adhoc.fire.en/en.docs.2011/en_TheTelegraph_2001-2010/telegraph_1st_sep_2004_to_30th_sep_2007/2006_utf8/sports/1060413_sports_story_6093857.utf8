 No regrets, says Trescothick

London: Marcus Trescothick on Wednesday insisted that he had no regrets about his early exit from Englands tour of India. 

The opening batsman left before the first Test after contracting a viral disease, a problem he partially blamed on the teams heavy workload. 

But the 30-year-old said he was happy that he had made the right choice despite his experience is being badly missed on a tour blighted by injuries. 

Asked if he thought he had let England down, Trescothick told a news channel: I dont think so, to be honest. I think people will realise. 

Ive had a lot of support from players and management and I think that says a lot for me. I know Ive made the right decision. It was just unfortunate with the timing. 

Trescothicks departure was explained as a family reason at that time by England, which conflicts with the players own explanation. 

Meanwhile, Michael Vaughan appealed to call for an end to all speculation over Trescothick. Marcus left the tour, he had a few problems, he had an illness, now lets look forward. (Agencies)

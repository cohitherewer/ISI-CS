 AIFF warning for Fransa

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: The AIFF, come what may, is determined to give Fransa Pax Club a long rope. After being at the receiving end of the verbal abuse of Fransa chairman Micky Pacheco since January 30, the national body has decided to give the Goan club another chance to wriggle out of the difficult situation. 

On Friday, the AIFF general secretary Alberto Colaco has shot another letter to Fransa asking them to express regret for withdrawing from three matches of the NFL and adhere to the rules and regulations of the NFL. The club has also been told that any request from Fransa Pax FC should be without pre-conditions. 

The letter further said: Your reply shall reach us by February 20, 2006 at 4pm. If you do not respond to this letter or do not adhere to the above conditions, the AIFF president will take appropriate decision based on the powers vested on him by the (executive) committee.

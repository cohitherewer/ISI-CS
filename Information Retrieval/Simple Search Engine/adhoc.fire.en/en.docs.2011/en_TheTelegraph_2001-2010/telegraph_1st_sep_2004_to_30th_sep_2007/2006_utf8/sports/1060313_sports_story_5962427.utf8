 India make successful presentation to CGF

Melbourne: India passed the big test with flying colours on Sunday after a successful presentation to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) general assembly on its preparations for the 2010 Games in New Delhi by Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi. 

After the slick 40-minute presentation, Indias request for three more disciplines at the 2010 Games received a positive response and the decision to add archery, cue sports and tennis will now be taken by the CGF Sports Committee in the next few months. 

Another significant move from the CGF was Pune being awarded the right to host the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games. 

The Youth Games in Pune will be a unique event in itself and will be held from October 12 to 18, 2008, featuring six disciplines. 

Interestingly, some CGF members requested for one or two additional disciplines to be added to the schedule. 

The six disciplines in the Pune Games will be athletics, badminton, boxing, shooting, tennis and weightlifting. Swimming could be an addition to this list. 

Progress is being made in New Delhi and we have a secretariat, which is up and running. As things move further forward we will be increasing staff numbers. 

The infrastructure in New Delhi is coming along well and we should be ready in time. (PTI)

 ICC adopts pitch-monitoring process

Dubai: The International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday it would scrap the super-sub trial in one-day Internationals and introduce a formal pitch-monitoring process for international cricket. 

This process, which has been adopted with immediate effect, includes potential sanctions ranging from a formal warning to a member board fine or even suspension of international status for venues that produce substandard pitches, it said in a statement after an ICC board meeting. 

The pitch monitoring process, the first formal one in international cricket, is to be based on the initial report of the Elite panel referee at the ground. 

That report would be followed by a review by the ICC general manager (cricket), David Richardson, and the chief Match Referee, Ranjan Madugalle (or the chairman of the cricket committee, Sunil Gavaskar, if the chief Referee produced the initial report). 

The boards decision on the use of super-subs follows last months recommendation by ICC chief executives, who felt the rule placed too much importance on winning the toss in one-dayers. 

It also confirmed that the ODI trial playing condition relating to fielding restrictions should be referred to the cricket committee for further consideration. 

The adoption of an ICC anti-doping policy would apply for all major ICC events.

 CAB wants Prasun to head panel

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Nineteen days after the Jagmohan Dalmiya group won the high-profile CAB elections beating Prasun Mukherjee and his team, the first effort was made on Friday to get the police commissioner involved in the associations administration. The working committee, which met in the evening, proposed setting up a cricket development committee with Mukherjee chairing it. 

I havent heard anything from the CAB yet Let me first see what they have to say, then only Ill be in a position to say yes or no, said Mukherjee. 

All the other 21 sub-committees were finalised on Friday. Two of Mukherjees teammates have found favour Samar Pal in the statistical committee and Tushar Sarkar in the sub-junior committee. 

Biswaroop Dey and Alok Nandi were unanimously selected as assistant secretaries.

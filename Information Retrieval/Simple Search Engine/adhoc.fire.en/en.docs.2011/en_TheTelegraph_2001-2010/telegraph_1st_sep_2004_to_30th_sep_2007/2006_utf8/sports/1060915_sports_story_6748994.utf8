Calcutta: East Bengal crossed a major hurdle on Thursday when they beat Mohammedan Sporting 4-2 at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

It placed the red-and-golds atop the CFL Premier Division standings, with 16 points from seven games. 

Mohammedan Sporting, having played eight matches, have 15 points, while Mohun Bagan have 14. 

The East Bengal coach, though, is in no mood to celebrate. There is a long way to go for us we still have to play seven matches and will have to beat Mohammedan Sporting again, said Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva at the post-match press conference. 

He was satisfied with the way the players had taken the chances on a sultry afternoon. Today (Thursday), we got five or six chances and scored four, thats very good. Against Mohun Bagan, we created six opportunities and converted none, observed Pereira. 

The Brazilian accepted that his team had committed some mistakes. 

 This is football, the players will make some mistakes, especially in these weather conditions. But still our team has been playing at a certain level we have been playing positively and aiming to score. 

Expressing happiness with the performance of fellow-Brazilians debutant striker Marcio Fernandes Thomas and Luiz Octavio de Souza who played in midfield on Thursday Pereira also had a word of praise for Man of the Match Snehashish Chakraborty. 

Some people didnt agree with my observation that Snehashish is a very good player, but everyone saw him today

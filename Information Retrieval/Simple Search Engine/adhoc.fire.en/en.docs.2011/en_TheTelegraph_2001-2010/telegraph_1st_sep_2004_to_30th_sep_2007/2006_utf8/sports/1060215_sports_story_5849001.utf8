 Sasi beats Landa 

to be joint second 

 - MOSCOW CHESS Neelotpal wins 

 Sasikiran is on 3.5 points with five others 

Moscow: Grandmaster Krishnan Sasikiran cruised to a fine victory against GM Konstantin Landa of Russia in the fifth round of the A1 section of Aeroflot International Open Chess Tournament here. 

Sasikiran, with 3.5 points, is joint second behind a pack of five players, including Vladimir Akopian of Armenia. 

Sandipan Chanda is on three points after drawing his fifth round game against Alexei Fedorov of Belarus and national champion Surya Shekhar Ganguly registered his first win in the event to be at two points. 

International Master and double GM norm holder Neelotpal Das remained on course for what would be his final GM norm after defeating IM L. Victor Ivanov of Russia. 

The victory took Neelotpal to four points out of a possible five for a joint third spot behind two leaders on 4.5 points in the A2 section being held simultaneously. 

The Calcutta-based now needs to meet a few GMs in the remaining three rounds and needs to score decently to become the next GM of the country. 

 Parimarjan Negi, Deep Sengupta and Abhijeet Gupta tasted defeats in the fifth round. 

Negi was beaten by GM Valeri Yandemirov of Russia while Italian GM Michele Godena proved too strong for Sengupta and Gupta could not quite compete against Vladimir Dobrov of Russia. 

All the three youngsters remained on 2.5 points and now need to score heavily in the remaining four rounds to remain in contention for GM norm.

 Sabina Park upgrading affected

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kingston: The upgrading of Sabina Park, one of the premier grounds in the West Indies, has been affected by a shortage of cement. 

We know the World Cup isnt very far off (begins in March 2007), but weve been faced with a shortage of cement... Were trying our best, Jamaica Cricket Association president Jackie Hendricks told The Telegraph. 

Sabina Park is to host the first semi-final, on April 24. 

Renovating one of the stands in a big way is underway and, so, there will be seating restrictions during the first two India versus West Indies ODIs next week ? on Thursday and Saturday. Were losing around 2,500 seats because of the construction activity, Hendricks informed. 

 When the upgrading is complete, capacity is expected 

 to increase by 2,500. During the World Cup, were 

 hoping to accommodate 15,000 spectators, Hendricks 

 said.

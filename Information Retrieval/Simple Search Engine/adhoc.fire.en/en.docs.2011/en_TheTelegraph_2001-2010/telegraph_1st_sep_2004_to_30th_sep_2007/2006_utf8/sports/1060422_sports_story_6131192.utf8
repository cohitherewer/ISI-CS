 Team more important than rankings: Dhoni

 Dhoni

New Delhi: Indias explosive wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni has said that contributing to the Indian teams victories is more important than reaching the top spot in one-day world rankings. 

Ranking does not matter. The team is more important. As long as my contributions lead to the teams victories, it is more important than the top ranking, he said. 

The Jharkhand player displaced Ricky Ponting from the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) ODI batsmens rankings after his half century in the second and final one-dayer against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. 

Its a pleasure for me to achieve the top ranking in a short span of 16 months. It really means I have done something to reach the top spot in such a short time, he was quoted as saying by a website. 

The 24-year-old said he has to keep performing to continue enjoying the top ranking for a long period. 

Its a good feeling and I hope to keep performing in the future. If you want to stay in the team, you need to keep performing, he said. 

He said it is unfair to compare him with Australian Adam Gilchrist. 

Gilchrist has proved himself consistently over a long period of time. I have played only 16 months of international cricket. Hence, I think that the comparison cannot be justified. I just hope that people can recognise me as Dhoni only, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Im not obsessed with the speed gun, says Brett Lee

 - Despite a long break, McGraths body has responded brilliantly 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Kuala Lumpur: Perhaps, Brett Lee has mellowed. Or, having played 54 Tests and 136 ODIs, hes more mature. 

Whatever, the 29-year-old, who has been playing for Australia from December 1999, told The Telegraph Wednesday that he wasnt obsessed with the speed gun. Today, Im perfectly happy bowling at 140 (kmph) as long as the line and length is fine... Im not obsessed with the speed gun... 

Earlier, interacting with the Media at the Traders Hotel, Lee remarked: I cant be complacent as there are guys who can take my slot... The rhythm gets affected if one isnt playing regularly, but Im happy I got a game (against the West Indies) a couple of days ago... I played after months and was surprised at how nicely the ball came out... 

Talking about the gifted Mitchell Johnson, who had to go home despite an excellent showing in Australias first two matches of the tri-series, Lee said: Hes a fantastic find... Mitch is an awesome bowler and has great things ahead... Hes enjoying the learning curve... Has good pace, but doesnt compromise on line and length... 

He added: The next 18-24 months are going to be crucial for Mitch... Lee, incidentally, is one of the quicks Johnson admires. 

Asked if he was looking forward to sharing the new ball with Glenn McGrath (he didnt play Monday), Lee responded: Absolutely... It has been quite a while since Glenn and I made the same XI... He ties up batsmen at one end, which gives me an opportunity at the other... Theres an aura about Glenn and batsmen look wary once he takes the field... Despite a long break, his body has responded brilliantly. 

The last Test featuring the two was at the SCG, in January, versus South Africa. Then, they havent played a one-dayer together after the one against Sri Lanka in Perth, end-January. Five Tests and 16 ODIs have gone by. 

Reiterating that Sachin Tendulkar was God, Lee emphasised hed always raised his game when up versus S achin and Brian Lara. Ricky Ponting and they are the best... That Sachin got an unbeaten 141 on his comeback, last week, confirmed the class act he is... 

Lee had words of comfort for Stuart Clark, who was sent to all corners of the park by Lara and Chris Gayle the other evening. It was one of those days... Im sure hell be able to put it behind him... Nowadays, with power plays and so on, conceding 45-50 in ten overs would be considered okay... Earlier, it had to be 40 in ten. 

In Lees opinion, Australias newly-appointed bowling coach Troy Cooley had much to give him and the other new ball bowlers. May be, hes going to show us a few things we havent seen... We all know the difference he made to England... Personally, Ive worked a lot with Dennis Lillee and will work with him in the future as well... 

Lee, by the way, had nice things to say about Ajit Agarkar. Hes a fantastic bowler and Im happy that he has re-invented himself... Im sure he still has lots to offer Indian cricket... The Mumbaikar is going to have opportunities to reciprocate.

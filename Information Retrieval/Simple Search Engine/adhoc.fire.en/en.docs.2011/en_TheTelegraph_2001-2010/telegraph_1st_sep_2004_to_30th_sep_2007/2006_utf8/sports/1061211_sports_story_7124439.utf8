 India not strong Cup contenders: Kapil

Ludhiana: Considering the prolonged patch of below-par performances, former captain Kapil Dev Sunday said the Indian team was not a strong contender for the World Cup 2007. 

At this stage, India are not a strong contender for the World Cup as they are passing through a very tough time, Kapil said. 

The World Cup winning captain said it was important to instil confidence in the team to get good results. 

Presently, the teams morale is down and efforts should be made to boost up their confidence to play well, said the former allrounder. 

Asked if coach Greg Chappell should be replaced, the legendary cricketer said: It is up to the Board and selectors for changing an Indian coach. But we must see how quickly the Indian team starts playing better. 

On the inclusion of Sourav Ganguly, Kapil said: It is not the question of inclusion of any cricketer. You bring any player but the team should start putting in its best efforts for winning a match. 

Kapil said the vice-captaincy to VVS Laxman must be a part of selectors planning for the future. 

When I first heard about it, I also felt strange, but I think selectors must have some planning behind this move, he said.

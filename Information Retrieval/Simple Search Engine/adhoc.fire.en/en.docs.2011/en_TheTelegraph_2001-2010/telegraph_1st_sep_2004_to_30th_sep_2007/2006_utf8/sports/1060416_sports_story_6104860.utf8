 Atwal makes cut after four misses

 Heritage Classic

 Hilton Head Island (South 

 Carolina): Arjun Atwal broke the jinx after a long time, 

 when he made his first cut in five starts with a one-under 

 70 in the second round of the Verizon Heritage Classic at 

 the Harbour Town Golf Links. Atwal, at five-under 137, is 

 now tied 16th and may well have been inside the top-10 but 

 for two late bogeys on the 15th and 16th.

 Meanwhile, Daniel Chopra missed 

 the cut with an even par 71 that saw him finish at 145 and 

 three off the cut line.

 Jim Furyk took a two-shot lead 

 with a huge 56-foot bir- die putt on the 18th to go 11-under. 

 He was followed by Aaron Baddeley (67), Brian Gay (67), 

 Duffy Waldorf (68) and first-round leader Vaughn Taylor 

 (70).

 Atwal, who had a great day off 

 the tee with 100 per cent accuracy, birdied the second, 

 fifth and 11th hole with a bogey in between on third. He 

 was going fine, when he struck back-to-back bogeys on 15th 

 and 16th to fall to even par.

 A birdie on last brought him back 

 under par on a day, when he needed 27 putts, just as he 

 did on first day.

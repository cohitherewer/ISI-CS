 Walsh: We can reach Cup final 

 Courtney Walsh

Mumbai: Fast bowling great Courtney Walsh predicted on Friday that the West Indies, runners-up in the ICC Champions Trophy, would make it a double by making the final of the World Cup. He felt that the one-time world-beaters were heading in the right direction. 

I am confident of the West Indies reaching the final of the World Cup. The team has been playing well over the last few months and seems to be heading in the right direction. 

The team is coming of age with the passage of time and with more experience to help them. The time is right for them to shine by getting their act together, he said. 

He was also all praise for Sachin Tendulkar and described him as the best player he had played against in international cricket. His (Sachins) record speaks for himself. I dont think anyone can question that what he has done for the game. Whatever Sachin gets from the game, he deserves, Walsh said. 

Walsh was reacting to a query at a media conference as to whether Sachin deserved to be named by Time as one of Asias heroes in its 60th anniversary issue. The list includes Mahatma Gandhi, Jawarharlal Nehru, Lakshmi Mittal and N.K. Narayana Murthy. 

I can only say that Sachin, if he were a West Indian, would probably have got the same fame. I can say that (West Indies skipper) Brian (Lara) is the best player I have had in my team and Sachin is the best I have played against, he said

 CAB hits back

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former BCCI joint secretary Goutam Das Gupta on Saturday said that the decision of not allotting any match to the CAB for the ICC Champions Trophy was a predetermined move. 

We never put forward any unreasonable demands to the BCCI. Till now the board hasnt conveyed anything to us in writing. But it seems that this was a predetermined move. One of the agenda in the meeting was to make a proposed itinerary for the tournament. But nothing happened as such, said Das Gupta.

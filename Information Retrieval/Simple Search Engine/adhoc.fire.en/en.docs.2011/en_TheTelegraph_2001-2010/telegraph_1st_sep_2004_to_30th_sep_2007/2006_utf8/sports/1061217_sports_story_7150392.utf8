 Gaekwad wants Sourav to open

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Heres a food-for-thought to coach Greg Chappells experimentation formula. And, as a matter of fact, this comes from somebody who has been there and done that before John Wrights era. 

Former India coach Aunshuman Gaekwad Saturday felt that Sourav Ganguly should be promoted to the No. 1 slot at a time when the regular openers (Wasim Jaffer-Virender Sehwag) were not clicking. 

At the Wanderers Friday, Jaffer made a 42-ball nine, while Sehwag had four off 46 balls. 

Impressed with the way Sourav batted (in his unbeaten 51, which built Indias first innings), Gaekwad felt that the former India skipper should be promoted ahead of Rahul Dravid. Sourav once Indias No.1 opening pair with Sachin Tendulkar in one-dayers is not new to opening. In fact, while I was the coach I had suggested him that if he was opening successfully in ODIs, then why not in Tests 

About Souravs innings, Gaekwad said: It was full of confidence; he was determined to fight out the odds and never looked tentative. 

Now the head coach of Gujarat, Gaekwad has a remedy to sort out the Sehwag syndrome. Its time for the team to give Sehwag a break which sometimes is helpful.

 Coaches strategies hold key: Gaekwad

Ahmedabad: Strategies and mind games thought out by the respective coaches will hold the key to the India-Pakistan series that begins with the first Test in Lahore on Friday, former India coach Aunshuman Gaekwad said on Wednesday. 

Considering the current form of the Pakistanis and the huge experience of international cricket that India carries with it, I think both the teams are on an equal footing, he said. 

But the key to the entire series will be the battle royale that will be fought between the two coaches (Bob Woolmer of Pakistan and India coach Greg Chappell) in the dressing rooms, he added. 

It will be their ability to devise strategies, to out-think the opposition, to churn out surprises which will hold the key as to who will win the series. 

Gaekwad felt that like the Australians, the Pakistanis also played the mental game. 

The Indians need to be mentally tough. And I am sure the players know it, he said. 

However, Gaekwad warned against over-confidence and complacency. 

The current Indo-Pak series will show us where we actually stand in the international arena. I feel the last series against Sri Lanka was too easy for Indians. It was more a case of the Lankans playing badly. (PTI)

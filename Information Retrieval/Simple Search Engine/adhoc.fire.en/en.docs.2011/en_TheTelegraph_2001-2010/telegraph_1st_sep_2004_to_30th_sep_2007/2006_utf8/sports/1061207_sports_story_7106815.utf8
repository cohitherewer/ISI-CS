 India lose match, win hearts

 - They defended well, created attacks and matched Iran move for move

Doha: It was one of those rare days when one could feel proud about the performance of the Indian team in an international soccer outing. On Wednesday, in the concluding Group D match against Iran, the Indians did lose the match 0-2, but won the hearts of their fans with some gallant display. 

It was the end of Indias soccer campaign in the 15th Asian Games, but what they gained at the Al-Sadd Stadium on Wednesday was much more than the three points they surrendered in the crucial encounter. The confidence they displayed throughout the 90-minute will help them deal with bigger challenges in future. 

For 78 minutes before Kelshadi Akbari struck from a free-kick outside the box after Habibur Rehman brought down an Iranian attacker, India played their best football in many months. They defended well, created attacks and matched their fancied rivals move for move. 

Sandip Nandy had an amazing day under the bar till he let in the second goal a minute before the final whistle. He made the mistake of coming out of his charge that helped Adel Kolakhaj lob the ball into an empty net. Till then, Nandy made at least four superb saves. 

It was not one of those typical outings where India would put up seven defenders against stronger rivals to keep the margin of defeat low. Bob Houghton had on Tuesday promised to go for an open game. He kept his word. Never in the match did it seem India were playing second fiddle and they opened several attacks through the wings. 

India, in fact, could have scored at least three goals. If Manjit Singh was the culprit who missed at least two chances, Sunil Chetri missed the other. Perhaps this was the time when Houghton really felt the absence of Bhaichung Bhutia. 

If the midfielders and strikers played in the most aggressive manner, equally competent were the Indian defenders, despite their visible inability to match their rivals physically. 

While skipper Surkumar Singh was able to break most of the attacks, Debabrata Roy gave him company on the other side. As he was beginning to slow down, Houghton brought in Habibur. 

The Mohammedan Sporting defender had a good day except for the foul he committed on the top of the box that fetched Iran the first goal. 

Houghton later said he was hoping to win the match upto the point it stayed goalless.Once you concede a goal in the 78th minute, it is difficult to make a comeback, he said.

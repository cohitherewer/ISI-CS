 Glowing tributes to the legend 

As Shane Warne announced on Thursday that he retire from international cricket after the final Ashes Test against England starting in Sydney on January 2, cricketing world was quick to sing the legendary legspinners praises. From being a true matchwinner to the bowlers Bradman to the games ultimate legend, tributes were flooding in from all corners of the globe in the knowledge that his absence will leave a void in the game that may take years to fill. 

The following are reactions from players (alphabetically) past and present to Warnes announcement of retirement: 

RICHIE BENAUD: In the space of a short time, hes turned the game upside down, changed it in concept. I think his greatest single achievement is not necessarily the 700 wickets, but the fact that when Wisden chose the five cricketers of the century, they chose Donald Bradman, Garry Sobers, Jack Hobbs, and Viv Richards and Shane Warne who had only been playing since 1991. Thats quite remarkable. 

ALLAN BORDER: He is in superb touch, hes bowling well physically. Hes been a breath of fresh air for the game. I just got the inkling that he was even considering one more tilt at England in England (in 2009) and that would see him out, but its just caught everyone by surprise. What he has done for the game is immeasurable really. The fact that he revived the dying art of leg-spin bowling and just the way he has gone about his cricket, its just been exciting when Shane Warne is involved. 

STEPHEN FLEMING: I dont think anyones done more than what hes done. On and off the field theres been areas of controversy, but statistically (he is) the greatest bowler that ever played. He was tough, very, very competitive but he had a cheeky streak about him. 

ADAM GILCHRIST: As a wicketkeeper theres no better spot to be than standing behind the stumps to Shane Warne at any time really. But when hes on song its quite mesmerising, so he brings a great deal of joy to me, just like everyone else sitting around watching. He makes us look good because hes so brilliant. 

RICHARD HADLEE: A lot of batsmen in world cricket will be delighted to learn hes leaving the game, but I think the game will be poorer without him. He has been a matchwinner, flamboyant and just incredible to watch. 

MERV HUGHES: Whatever you say about Shane Warne it isnt enough. His performances have not only shaped cricket in Australia but worldwide. Most people go through a purple patch and Shane Warne has had a purple patch for 15 of 16 years. 

NASSER HUSSAIN: For me, he was the reason you played cricket. To be in a test against him, you knew you were in a battle with Warne, verbally, physically, mentally and technically.

 STUART MAcGILL: I was completely stunned and 

 didnt believe the news when I first saw it, because 

 I was always under the impression that I would be out before 

 Shane. 

JAVED MIANDAD: Warne was the bowler who could bowl leg-spin, flippers and googlies with utmost perfection. Warne could have easily played a year or two (more), but its Australian history that a player retires when hes at his peak form. 

SARFRAZ NAWAZ: Warne is the bowlers Bradman. He always made batsmen think with his variety of deliveries. The cricketing world would miss him a lot. I wish he could have continued to play on. 

STEVE WAUGH: He was a resilient, courageous and tough opponent. Warnie was always a matchwinner because he had a great repertoire and a sense for the occasion. The greater the stakes the better the performance.

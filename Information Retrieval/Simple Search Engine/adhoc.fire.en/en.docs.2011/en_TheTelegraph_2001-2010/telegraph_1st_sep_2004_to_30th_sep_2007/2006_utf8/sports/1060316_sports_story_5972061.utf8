 - National One-Dayers

A STAFF REPORTER AND AGENCIES 

 Sanjib has been recalled as 15th member 

Calcutta: Sanjib Sanyal on Wednesday was recalled as the 15th member of the Bengal squad for the National One-Day Meet, to be held in Kanpur. 

According to a CAB official, the allrounder was included on captain Deep Dasguptas request. Deep wanted an experienced allrounder in the squad, so Sanyal was included. The members of the selection committee met on Tuesday and the decision was taken to include him as the 15th member, he said. 

Sanyal, it may be noted, was dropped and the under-19 World Cupper Debabrata Das was into the squad, when it was initially picked on Friday last. 

Meanwhile, Sourav Ganguly joined the squad on Wednesdsay. 

Bengal take on Punjab in the quarter finals at the Green Park Stadium on Thursday. 

Everybody in the camp is fit. As of now, Kamal Hasan Mondal, Debabrata Das and Subhajit Paul could be left out while Shib Sagar Singh might be the super-sub, said Bengal team manager Samir Dasgupta. 

Apart from Sanyal, Deep, however, will hope young gun Manoj Tewari to deliver in the match. 

On the other hand, Punjab will rely on captain Dinesh Mongia who has been in form with the bat and the India prospect pacer, Vikram Rajvir Singh. The players morale is high. We are confident of winning the match, Punjab coach Intikhab Alam said in Kanpur on Wednesday. 

In Thursdays other match, Jharkhand face an uphill task against Baroda at the D.E.F. Ground. 

Defending champions Uttar Pradesh, Railways, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu are the other teams in the fray. 

Railways and Karnataka advanced after winning their pre-quarterfinals against Gujarat and Haryana, respectively. 

The teams practice was affected after they were ordered to remain indoors by the state officials citing stringent security due to holi.

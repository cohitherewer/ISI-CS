 Berbick hacked to death

Port Antonio (Jamaica): Trevor Berbick, a famed footnote in boxing who beat Muhammad Ali and lost to Mike Tyson in historic fights, was found hacked to death at his Caribbean island home here on Sunday, police said. 

Former world heavyweight champion Berbick, who was 51, was born here and fought as a heavyweight for Jamaica at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, although he later became a Canadian citizen. 

Police said that they had no leads several hours after Berbicks body was discovered early this morning at his home in the small town of Portland with several chop wounds believed to have been inflicted with a machete. 

According to radio reports, Berbick, who returned to live on the island, has had several run-ins with neighbours over land disputes. (AFP)

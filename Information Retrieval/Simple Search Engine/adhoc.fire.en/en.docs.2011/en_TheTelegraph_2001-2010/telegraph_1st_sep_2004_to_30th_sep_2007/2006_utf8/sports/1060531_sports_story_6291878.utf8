 Adams lauds skipper Lara

London: The return of Brian Lara to the helm of affairs was the key behind the sterling show of the West Indies in the recent one-day series against India, according to former captain Jimmy Adams. 

Adams said the young players of the side looked up to Lara and were responding well to the batting great. 

Having Brian back as captain has made a big difference. The youngsters have responded to him and thats good to see, he was quoted as saying in a TV channel. Adams relished the recent performance of the West Indies who clinched the series 4-1 against favourites India. (PTI)

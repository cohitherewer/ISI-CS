 Pollock, Kallis, Fleming set for 100th Test

Centurion: Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock and Stephen Fleming could mark their 100th Tests by leading South Africa and New Zealand in the series-opener on Saturday. 

Whether Kallis captains the home side will depend on if regular skipper Graeme Smith passes a final fitness test on his injured ring finger. Smith batted in the nets on Thursday and was in some discomfort, but team physio Shane Jabbar was encouraged. 

We will treat the finger some more, and then well take a final decision, Jabbar said. 

When you play in your first Test, you never really think about playing in a hundred, Kallis said. But it is an honour and a privilege, and it will be something to remember in the future. But I wont be expecting any favours from the opposition because its my hundredth Test. 

Asked for career highlights, he listed his debut against England in December 1995, his first Test century against Australia two years later, and the friends hes made among teammates and opponents. 

I have also had the opportunity to travel the world-what guy at 30 has been to some of the places Ive been to? And I get paid for something I love doing. 

He needs 160 runs and four wickets to become the first Test player since West Indies great Gary Sobers to reach 8,000 runs and 200 wickets. Asked what he hoped for from his hundredth Test, Kallis quipped, a couple of hundreds and a five-for. 

Despite observers believing South Africa will be tired after battling Australia in two successive series ? and winning only one Test in six ? Kallis said theyd be tougher for the experience. 

I am very pleased that its the same guys who went through that who have been selected for this series.

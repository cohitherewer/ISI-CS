 Uthappa focuses on consistency 

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Robin Uthappa has taken his omission from the South Africa-bound ODI squad in his stride and termed consistency in performance as the inevitable path for getting a national call-up. 

Its important that you keep on performing. The selectors look up to the best performers and if you prove to be one of them, its inevitable that youll be there in the team, Uthappa said after his well-crafted 141 against Sri Lanka A on Monday. 

The Karnataka batsman also believed that South Zone would start the final day on an advantageous position. The pitch is deteriorating and the Sri Lankas wont find it easy to handle it, he said. 

Uthappas view was supported by Souths attacking spearhead Sreesanth. The batsmen have given us a good platform Were hopeful to give them a good fight, he said. 

Uthappa said that he loved playing an allrounders role. As an under-19 player, I used to keep wickets. But the selectors asked me to concentrate more on my batting. I also love bowling (South captain) Laxmanbhai has used me frequently as a bowler. Im ready to contribute to the teams cause in whatever way possible, Uthappa added.

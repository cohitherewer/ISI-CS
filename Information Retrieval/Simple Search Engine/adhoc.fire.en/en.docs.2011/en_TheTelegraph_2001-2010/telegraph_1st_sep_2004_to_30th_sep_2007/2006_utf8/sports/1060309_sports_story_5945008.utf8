 For the book

 The Dutch Football Federation (KNVB) has banned fans from wearing imitation plastic Nazi helmets inside stadiums in an effort to cool volatile temperatures between Holland and German supporters in the run-up to the World Cup. The helmets will be banned from forthcoming friendlies against Mexico, Cameroon and Australia but any decision to ban them at the World Cup would have to be taken by local organisers.

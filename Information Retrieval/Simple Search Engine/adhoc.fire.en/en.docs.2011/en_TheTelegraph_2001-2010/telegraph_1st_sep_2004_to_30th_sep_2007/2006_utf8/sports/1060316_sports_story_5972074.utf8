 New coach hopes goal drought will end

 - National League

A STAFF REPORTER

 With Mohun Bagan going through a lean patch and finding goal scoring a tough proposition, newly-appointed coach Biswajit Bhattacharya had a point or two to make to Dipendu Biswas during a practice session at the club ground on Wednesday. Picture by Santosh Ghosh 

Calcutta: It will be a battle for pride when Mohun Bagan take on Fransa Pax in the eighth round of the ONGC Cup for the 10th National Football League match at the Salt Lake Stadium on Thursday. 

Both Bagan and Fransa are at the bottom of the points table at ninth and tenth place, respectively. Bagan have five points from seven matches, while Fransa have three from six outings. 

It will be tough match for Bagan and their new coach Biswajit Bhattacharya as he will miss the services of five regular players. Captain Mehtab Hussain, Eduardo Coelho, Sanjeev Maria, Dulal Biswas and Tomba Singh will all be unavailable for the tie. Mehtab is out with jaundice, Tomba is suffering form a groin injury and the other three are out with double booking. 

We will prefer to play it safe for the first 25 minutes and then go for attack. The team is going through a bad phase, but I am hopeful that the boys will give their 100 per cent, Bhattcharya said during practice at the club ground on Wednesday. 

Scoring will be Bhattacharyas main headache. In recent times, Bagan have failed to score goals and have also missed out on some close chances. Yes, I have tried my best to work in that area. We have scored goals during our practice matches and hopefully we will do the same on the match day as well, he said. 

Bagan will probably go for the 2-4-4 formation with Awudu Ibrahim and Dipendu Biswas leading the charge. However, whether Dipendu would be able to play full 90 minutes is doubtful since he suffers from a congenital heart problem. He has not played full 90 minutes so far, so I will have to talk to him and then decide, added the Bagan coach. 

Another problem for Mohun Bagan is their defence, as they will miss the valuable service of Eduardo and Maria. 

Fransa, who are back in the league after all the imbroglio which in fact raised questions over their participation in the NFL, are also low on morale and will desperately be looking forward to a win. 

Fransa can draw inspiration from their last match where they were held by Salgaocar 1-1. 

Fransa, too, will miss some key players like Sidney Nkalanga, Marcus Peixto, Surojit Roy and frontline goalkeeper Mark Mascarenhas. 

Marcus and Surojit are out with double booking, while Mark is down with injury. 

The Fransa coach will be banking on frontline strikers Bello Rassaq and Ivan DSilva. 

 Sidney issue 

Sidney, who donned East Bengal colours in the Federation Cup, hasnt travelled with the team. According to a team source, he was very irregular at practice and has fallen out with the team management. The team management has even filed a missing diary at the Colva police station in Goa.

 Star status affecting India: Dr Webster

New Delhi: Hot shot sports psychologist Dr Rudy Webster, currently associated with the Indian team, has suggested that the super star status is affecting Indias performance. 

This is a common syndrome, Dr Webster told a TV channel on Thursday, adding: super star status puts one under pressure. The same happened to (Brian) Lara in his early days. 

Youngsters have got to learn this balance and remember that cricket comes first. We have to make players understand, to keep their feet on the ground and remain focused. 

They have to be made to understand that their superstardom is because of their game, Dr Webster said. 

I have been able to speak to a few of them, for instance Virender Sehwag. 

I managed to speak to him just before the last ODI. The session helped him. That is evident from the way he played, Webster said.

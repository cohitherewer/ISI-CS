The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ACC doesnt break with convention

 - SLC chief is now at helm 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: The 

 Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) failed in its 

 bid to have president Sharad Pawars term as the Asian 

 Cricket Council (ACC) chief extended. 

 According to The Telegraphs 

 sources in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, nobody favoured 

 a departure from convention when the idea was floated 

 in the lead-up to last Sundays AGM in Kuala Lumpur. 

Pawar, therefore, vacated the chair which is now occupied by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) head Jayanta Dharmadasa. 

Given that Pawar came on the scene only after BCCI nominee Jagmohan Dalmiya resigned in early December, he was at the helm for just six-odd months. 

The top post is rotated among the four Test-playing nations of the region ? India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. 

Each gets a two-year term. 

Dharmadasas own innings, though, may well be shorter if he loses the SLC elections on July 15. 

After all, theres intense speculation that a well-connected politician ? Sripathi Sooriyarachi ? could file his nomination. 

Dharmadasa has already filed his, much before the last date (July 1) for doing so. 

The role of sports minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga is going to be crucial? If he backs somebody from his fraternity, then theres no way that Dharmadasa can win. Sooriyarachi, therefore, could sit in the ACC chiefs chair, remarked one source. 

The Kuala Lumpur-headquartered ACC, meanwhile, has formed a womens coordination committee headed by former Indian cricketer Shubhangi Kulkarni. 

Kulkarni is the Womens Cricket Association of India secretary. 

Besides elevating Kuwait and Thailand to Full Members, the AGM saw total agreement on the next edition of the Asia Cup being hosted by Pakistan in April 2008. 

The members resolved, once more, to conduct the tournament (first staged by Sharjah, in 1984) every two years. 

 Its to be seen whether that actually happens. 

 Incidentally, the one slotted in 2008 was to have been held 

 this year!

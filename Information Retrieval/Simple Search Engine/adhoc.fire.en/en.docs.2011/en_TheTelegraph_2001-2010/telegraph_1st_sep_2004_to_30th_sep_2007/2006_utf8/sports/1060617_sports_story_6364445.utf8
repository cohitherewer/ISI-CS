Rotenburg: As soon as practice ended Friday, Stern John broke out the cricket bat and began a lighthearted game with his Trinidad and Tobago teammates. Shouts and laughter rang out as bowlers threw tennis balls to the batsmen. Not quite the scene one would expect the day after a heartbreaking World Cup loss to England. 

Then again, few experts expected the Soca Warriors to still have a chance to make it to the second round of the World Cup heading into their final first-round game. They called us in the beginning the Cinderella team and we had nothing to look for in this tournament, coach Leo Beenhakker said on Friday. You see how the team played against two big European teams. 

Trinidad and Tobago was less than 10 minutes away from their second straight 0-0 draw on Thursday before Englands Peter Crouch scored on a header and Steven Gerrard added another goal in injury time. 

Coming into the World Cup everyone thought that wed be the whipping boys and lose every game heavily, midfielder Chris Birchall said. Weve done the country proud.

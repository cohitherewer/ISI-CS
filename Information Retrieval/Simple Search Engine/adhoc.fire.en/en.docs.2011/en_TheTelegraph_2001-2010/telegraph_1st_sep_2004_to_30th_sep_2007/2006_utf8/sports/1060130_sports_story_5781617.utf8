 Deep rues fielding lapses

A CORRESPONDENT

Lucknow: Bengal captain Deep Dasgupta tried to hide his disappointment after the opening days play in the Ranji Trophy final against Uttar Pradesh. 

Not the runs we conceded, but our missing easy catches has kept me worried, said a dejected Deep. 

The time has come when he we have to live up to the expectations, especially in the fielding department, he added. 

At least three catches were dropped and that put the pressure on the visitors. Mohammed Kaif, who went on to make 92, was let off early in the slip cordon. 

Bengals fielding lapses had haunted them during their Elite group matches as well, but the performance of their batsmen and bowlers helped them overcome such lapses then. It will be up to them again to snatch the initiative from Uttar Pradesh. 

Deep praised his bowlers, but said that they had to be more disciplined in their line and length. 

They could have taken more wickets on the first day itself, he said. We have a good batting side and I am hopeful of a good response from our batsmen. 

Bengal need to pick up a few wickets in the morning session on the second day if they are to harbour hopes of a turnaround.

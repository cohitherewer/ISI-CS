The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We are up against 2 top teams: Lara 

Bridgetown: Captain Brian Lara said the West Indies were keen to see how they measured up against Australia and India in the DLF Cup tri-series in Malaysia this month. 

We have to be realistic, Lara said before the squad left the Caribbean on Wednesday. 

We are playing against two of the best teams in the world. We had some success against India earlier in the year and that has us in a positive frame of mind. We know that they are a formidable opponent. 

Australia are the strongest team in the game. We are a team that is very excited about the prospects of taking on both of them. We will be looking to the future as we go to Malaysia, Lara said. 

However, Lara also said the tri-series would be an ideal preparation for his teams defence of the ICC Champions Trophy in India in October-November. Lara also said the team picked for the tri-series was just the start of great things for his side. (PTI)

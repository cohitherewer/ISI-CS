 South Africa pick Gibbs, leave out Boje 

 - CHAMPIONS TROPHY 

 - New Zealand include rookie Mark Gillespie 

 Herschelle Gibbs 

Durban: Nicky Boje wont need to worry about interrogation by the Delhi police. He has been left out of the South African squad for the ICC Champions Trophy in India. 

While Boje failed to find a place, Herschelle Gibbs was included in the 14-member squad announced by the South African selectors on Thursday. 

The names of Gibbs and Boje were mentioned in the course of the match-fixing investigation by the Delhi police who busted the scandal in 2000 after tapping phone conversations of late South African captain Hansie Cronje. 

Both the players, who twice refused to visit India fearing arrests, expressed their keenness to tour this time and had agreed to meet the investigating authorities with their lawyers. 

The Delhi police, however, did not rule out interrogating Gibbs regarding his alleged role in the scandal. We will take a decision at the appropriate time, a senior crime branch official of the Delhi Police said. 

Robin Petersen is the lone specialist spinner in the squad that will see the return of Graeme Smith as captain. 

With several of our key players needing to pass fitness tests before they can be considered for selection, we had little choice but to select a larger than usual squad, selectors convenor Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. 

Smith, vice-captain Jacques Kallis, pacer Charl Langeveldt and allrounder Justin Kemp, who all missed out on tour of Sri Lanka last month due to injuries, have been included. 

Except for Smith, the other three will have to clear a fitness test on September 12. 

The South Africans will play a three-match one-day series against Zimbabwe that will serve as a tune-up to the 10-nation event. 

Meanwhile, uncapped fast bowler Mark Gillespie was named on Thursday in New Zealands 14-man squad . 

Gillespie, 26, was among the leading wickettakers in New Zealands domestic cricket last summer taking 43 wickets at an average of 23.16, and played for New Zealand A in the recent Top End series in Australia. 

The right-armer, who bowls fast medium inswingers and outswingers, has been named to provide new ball support to opening bowler Shane Bond in the absence of the injured Michael Mason. 

Scott Styris has been nam-ed in New Zealands squad tho-ugh he recently suffered a ba-ck injury while playing county cricket in England. New Zealand manager Lindsay Crocker said with more than four weeks remaining until New Zealands opening match against South Africa at Jaipur, there was ample time for Styris to recover full fitness. 

Top order batsman Peter Fulton has been retained ahead of the younger, more dashing right hander Ross Taylor in the squads only other contentious selection. 

Meanwhile, Bangladesh retained Habibul Bashar as captain and included uncap-ped allrounder Mehrab Hossain in their 14-man squad. 

 Bashar, forced to cut short a tour of Zimbabwe and 

 Kenya last month after injuring his left hand, is recovering 

 well, chief selector Faruque Ahm-ed said.Shahriar Nafees 

 was named as vice-captain, replacing wicketkeeper Khaled 

 Mashud.

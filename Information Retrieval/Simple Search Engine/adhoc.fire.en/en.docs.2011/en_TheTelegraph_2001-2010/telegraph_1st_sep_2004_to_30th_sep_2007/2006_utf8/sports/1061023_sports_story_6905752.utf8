The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 India move up to 4th 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: India have moved up one place in the latest LG ICC ODI rankings following their win over England in the ICC Champions Trophy match on October 15. Victory over Sri Lanka and Australia in the remaining group matches of the tournament could see Rahul Dravids side return to third in the table, according to an ICC release. 

Among batsmen, South African captain Graeme Smith and West Indian allrounder Chris Gayle are using the Champions Trophy to put pressure on the Australian pair of Mike Hussey and Adam Gilchrist at the top of the batsmens list. 

Gayles fine performances, particularly his unbeaten century against Bangladesh, have moved him up five places in the batting list to fourth overall. 

Australian captain Ricky Ponting has dropped five places to number nine in the batting list after a disappointing start to his ICC Champions Trophy campaign.

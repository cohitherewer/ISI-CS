 Dalmiya threatens to move court 

A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta: Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya on Friday condemned the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)s moves against the association, terming them as high handed and vindictive, and threatened to move court. 

Describing the actions as nothing but a stunt, in view of the ensuing annual general meeting, Dalmiya said: One cannot remain a silent spectator... The judiciary is still vibrant in this country and if necessary, appropriate court of law will be moved again. 

The BCCIs letter stated that since Dalmiya had not given a reply to the second showcause notice on April 15, the matter would be referred to the Boards disciplinary committee. The BCCI has also decided to withhold all subsidies and payments to the association. 

Dalmiya remarked that a number of accusations had been made in the showcause notice with regard to the bank account at Indian Overseas Banks Bhowanipur branch, but no supporting document was furnished. 

I wrote to the Board asking for inspection of the documents on which allegations were based. My authorised representative was asked to go to the BCCI treasurers office in Chennai on May 5. The documents were partly shown and partly held back and an assurance was given that all the documents would be made available to me within a fortnight, Dalmiya said. 

Circulating a copy of the minutes of the meeting on May 5, he claimed that the BCCI representative had inspected the documents at the bank randomly. 

On the basis of such random inspection of documents, the BCCI filed an FIR against me, suspended me from the Board and now they are referring it to the disciplinary committee even before giving me an opportunity to inspect the full document and answer the charges. This is the height of injustice and, if necessary, I will seek legal redress. 

The CAB also denied Board secretary Niranjan Shahs claim that Chitrak Mitra, who represented the association at the April 9 working committee meeting, had assured that details of amounts transferred to CAB from the Bhowanipur account would be furnished to the Board within seven days. 

No such time limit was fixed at the meeting and it can well be proved from the draft minutes that were circulated to the affiliated units, Mitra said. 

Dalmiya described as arbitrary the BCCIs decision to stop all subsidies and payments and debit Rs 40 crore to the association till it furnished details of the accounts.

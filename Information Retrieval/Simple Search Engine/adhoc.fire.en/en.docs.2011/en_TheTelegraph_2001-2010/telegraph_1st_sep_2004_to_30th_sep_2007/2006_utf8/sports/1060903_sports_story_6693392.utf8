 England, France, Scotland have it easy 

 Louis Saha after scoring Frances second goal against Georgia 

Manchester: England opened their Euro 2008 qualifying campaign with a 5-0 victory over Andorra in a one-sided Group E game at Old Trafford on Saturday. 

A goal apiece from Peter Crouch and Steven Gerrard inside the first 15 minutes settled the outcome, Jermain Defoe hit two more either side of half-time and Crouch headed the fifth. 

It could not have gone smoother for Steve McClarens first competitive game as England manager since replacing his former boss Sven-Goran Eriksson after the World Cup. 

England certainly looked good against a side of amateurs from a Pyrenean principality whose entire population of 71,000 could be seated at Old Trafford with room to spare. 

England were fielding a re-shuffled side with first-choice strikers Michael Owen and Wayne Rooney absent due to long-term injury and suspension respectively. Midfielder Joe Cole and defenders Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand are also injured. 

Crouch got the goal feast underway from close range after five minutes and Gerrard chested down Ashley Coles high cross to lash in the second in the 13th minute. 

Andorra at times had all 11 men in the final third, while their feeble attempts to attack were snuffed out by holding midfielder Owen Hargreaves, who also hit the post with a free kick. 

In Tbilisi, Florent Malouda and Louis Saha each scored to lead France over Georgia 3-0 in another Group B qualifying match. Franck Ribery assisted on both early goals as France dominated the match. 

Georgia defender Malkhaz Asatiani scored an own-goal in the 46th, volleying Willy Sagnols pass over the head of goalkeeper Grigol Chanturia. 

In the same group, Scotland hammered the Faroe Islands 6-0 for their biggest competitive win in 37 years at Celtic Park on Saturday. 

Scotland led 5-0 at halftime with goals from Darren Fletcher, Kris Boyd (2, including one from a penalty), James McFadden and Kenny Miller before 50,103 fans. Substitute Garry Connor added the sixth four minutes from time. 

Barcelona forward Eidur Gudjohnsen became Icelands joint top-scorer on Saturday, netting in a 3-0 demolition of Northern Ireland in their Group F qualifier at Windsor Park in Belfast. (Agencies)

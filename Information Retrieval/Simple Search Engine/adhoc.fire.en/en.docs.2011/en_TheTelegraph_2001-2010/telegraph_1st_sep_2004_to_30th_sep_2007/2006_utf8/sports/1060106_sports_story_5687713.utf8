 Pak tour an opportunity to grow, says Chappell

 - Zaheer has the desire to perform, says Indian coach

New Delhi: Coach Greg Chappell on Thursday said the Indo-Pak encounter was a great marquee series in world cricket but the players must treat it as an opportunity to test themselves against tougher opponents as they continue to evolve as a team. 

It is a big series in this part of the world. It is a great opportunity for the team to continue its development. Pakistan is a confident bunch this time, and we need to be tested by difficult teams, Chappell said at a pre-departure media conference here. 

Chappell said the Indo-Pak clashes have outstripped the Ashes series. 

Obviously the Ashes has been there for some time, but the Indo-Pak one is a great marquee series in world cricket, the 57-year old former Australian captain said. 

The enthusiasm, the excitement and the sheer number of people involved makes it the biggest. I am honoured to be a part of the series. 

The Indian team begin their campaign with a three-day warm-up game in Lahore from Saturday. 

Captain Rahul Dravid said he had prepared for the series with the same respect which he gives to other tours. 

Asked if the Pakistan tour was the toughest of the challenges he has faced so far, Dravid said, I think the toughest was probably to sing my baby to sleep. 

No, every series is a challenge. We have prepared ourselves as best as we can. We want to enjoy our cricket. 

He maintained that both the teams would begin the series on zero, and what they achieved in the past did not matter. 

It doesnt matter who is favourite or who scored runs. When the journalists ask, you say a few things but as a professional sportsman you know that what you do on that day is what matters, he said. 

Dravid, who had stood for Sourav Ganguly in the first Test at Multan during Indias last visit in 2003-04, said he did not imagine he would lead the team on a Pakistan tour when he made his debut 10 years ago. 

No. When I started, I wanted to be a successful cricketer and play an important role in the teams fortune, he said. 

The time has come now for me to take added responsibility. But the principle and the philosophy will remain the same. 

Chappell was positive in his view on Zaheer Khans return. 

He has been in good form in domestic cricket. I think his performance shows he has the desire to do whatever we wanted him to do, he said. 

Dravid also clarified that his comments in an interview to a magazine was not made with reference to any particular individual. 

What I said was that at this level (of the game), I should not have to tell a player to give his best for the country. It is understood that he has to give his best, the Karnataka batsman said. 

There are a whole group of guys who give their best. If two people cannot motivate themselves it is going to bring down the whole team. We dont want to allow that to happen, Dravid said. 

Chappell said the form of the opening batsmen was not an issue, and that it was not yet decided as to who will open in the Tests. 

Cause of concern is not what I would say. The start is important, but it does not always happen that way, the coach said. 

We have seen in recent matches that the lower order has done well to give us a good total. It is all about applying ourselves. If we do well at the top, it is going to be easy for us. We have got three openers and over the next week we will have to find out who are the two who can do the job.

He (Sachin) has recovered exceptionally well given the time since the surgery (in London in March) and Dr Andrew Wallace (who performed the surgery) is confident that the repaired anatomical structures will be strong, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah said in a statement.

Rio De Janeiro: Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said he was not contemplating anything other than another World Cup victory as the defending champions named their 23-man squad for the finals on Monday. 

Parreira, who sprang no surprises, said Brazil would be wary of pitfalls but that his mind was set on an unprecedented sixth world title. 

We just think about winning, he said after announcing his choices. 

We dont allow negative thoughts anywhere near us, they take a long by-pass. Nobody is prepared for a defeat, we are prepared to win. 

We have a lot of quality, he added. If you stop Ronaldinho, there are three or four others who can win a match. If you stop Ronaldo, another one pops up. 

However, Parreira promised that Brazil would not take any of their opponents lightly. 

We know the World Cup is a treacherous competition, he said. There are just seven games, its knockout from the fourth game onwards and the technically weaker teams can spring surprises. 

Meanwhile, AC Milan striker Filippo Inzaghi has been named in Italy coach Marcello Lippis 23-man squad along with goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. 

The 32-year-old Inzaghi has not played for the national team since October 2003 due to a series of injuries but his recent club form has earned him a spot in the squad. 

Juventus goalkeeper Buffon was included despite his link to an ongoing investigation into gambling. He was questioned on Saturday over alleged betting improprieties after he voluntarily presented himself to Turin magistrates. 

The keeper has denied any wrongdoing or breaking the ban on gambling that is imposed on all professional players in Italy. 

However, in a surprise move, Liverpool striker Fernando Morientes has been left out of Spains squad for the World Cup after Luis Aragones preferred to bolster his sides defence. Valencia centre-back Carlos Marchena was included despite a mediocre season, while Morientes was ignored after failing to find his scoring form at Liverpool. 

Morientes has found the net just nine times for Liverpool this season, but has an impressive record when he has played for Spain, scoring 26 times in 43 games. 

The former Real Madrid striker went to both Euro 2004 and the last World Cup, but missed out on Euro 2000, an omission that then-coach Jose Antonio Camacho later admitted was a mistake. 

Meanwhile, Germany coach Juergen Klinsmann included Jens Nowotny in his squad on Monday despite the defenders near two-year absence from international football. 

Klinsmann also added surprise choice David Odonkor from Borussia Dortmund, picking the uncapped 22-year-old midfielder over a trio of experienced rivals for a spot in the hosts squad. (Reuters)

 Bhutia not impressed by Teamgeist

 - Things dont improve every time you bring in change 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPNDENT

 Teamgeist, the official ball for the 2006 World Cup 

New Delhi: The ball had played no mischief in Indias crushing 0-6 defeat against Japan at Yokohama in the World Cup qualifiers in February. Yet, Indian skipper Bhaichung Bhutia is not entirely happy with the quality of the ball that was used in the match. 

I was aware that we played with the same ball that will be used for the World Cup in Germany, Bhutia told The Telegraph on Wednesday. But somehow, I was not convinced with the quality of the ball. It looked sparkling, but what is important is the outer layer. I didnt find it that good. It was difficult to play with. 

The new ball, Teamgeist, according to Adidas, will produce greater precision than other balls, making ball control and distribution 30 per cent more accurate. The ball is rounder because the number of panels have been reduced from 32 to 14, which removes seams that create an uneven surface. 

Panels are not that important, Bhaichung said. Its the quality of the outer layer that is more important. To me, the one that was used for the last World Cup was certainly better. I fully understand the fact that the trend of the time is to be innovative. But, then, it doesnt mean that things will improve everytime you bring a change. 

Atanu Bhattacharya, Indias goalkeeper coach, begs to differ. He had found no fault with the new ball while playing against Japan and in the friendly tie against Hong Kong. It has the right speed and swerve, said the former Asian All Star custodian. 

In fact, Atanu was convinced that the one used in the last World Cup was defective. It was not travelling with the same speed and direction after a shot was taken from a distance. It created a lot of problems for the footballers, especially the goalkeepers. The ball was one of the main hindrance behind Roberto Carlos failing to take accurate free-kicks, Atanu said. 

The biggest advantage with the newly introduced ball, Atanu felt, was its ability to play true to both the striker and the goalkeeper. 

This ball doesnt have the treacherous tendency to change track once the kick is taken. At the same time, it is easy for the goalkeepers to judge under lights since the ball has more white than the black. 

All India Football Federation (AIFF) general secretary Alberto Colaco felt that people are always reluctant to accept new things. But one has to accept the fact that equipment technology in football is progressing by leaps and bounds and the ball is a product of this new technology. It is good for football, said the veteran soccer administrator. 

Indian footballers used the ball during the national camp for the World Cup qualifiers. Each ball cost around Rs 5,000 and the federation supplied a dozen such balls before every match. Colaco, however, said there was no plan to introduce these balls for the domestic tournaments. At the moment, we are using Fifa approved Nivia balls and are likely to continue with them, he said. 

Former national coach Sukhwinder Singh is yet to see these new balls, but has no reservations against them. Adidas claimed that these (balls) will improve the quality of the game. If it is true then we should play with these balls, Sukhwinder said. 

Equipment does play a major role in enhancing performance these days. Then, why not play with Teamgeist, he said. 

During our days, we used to get sub-standard boots, balls, jerseys and socks while playing for the national team. Thankfully, things have changed. Let these boys enjoy the best available facilities, Sukhwinder said.

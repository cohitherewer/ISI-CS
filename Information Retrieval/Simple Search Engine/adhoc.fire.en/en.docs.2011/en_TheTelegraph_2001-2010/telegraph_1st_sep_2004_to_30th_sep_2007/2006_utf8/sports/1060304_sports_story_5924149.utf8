 CAB demands action against Chappell

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), at its working committee meeting on Friday, decided to write to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), asking the body to take appropriate action ??? in accordance with the rule book ?? against Team India coach Greg Chappell for his comments on former captain Sourav Ganguly in an interview to a UK newspaper. 

The working committee of the CAB felt it was not a freak incident as it was happening everyday. Sourav is very important to us. We are not here to settle any scores with the BCCI. Such comments from the coach makes it difficult for the player to concentrate on the game, more so, when he is fighting to make a comeback, CAB president Jagmohan Dalmiya said after the meeting. The working committee authorised joint secretary Saradindu Pal to communicate with BCCI secretary Niranjan Shah and find out what action the Board proposed to take against Chappell. 

Dalmiya said the coach is a part of the team and such comments from him were not desirable. He felt the Board should take stern action against the coach for violating the laws. A mere piece of advice from the Board asking Chappell to restrict his comments to the teams performance and prospects is not enough. 

According to the CAB president, the rule is clear on the issue. Clause 3.2 (9) of the rule book for players and team officials, adopted by the BCCI in 2000, says: No Players/Team Officials shall write, publish or assist any person to write, publish any book or articles in newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals or participate in a TV interview/Radio interview on any matters relating to the disclosure of any strategy decided by the Team and/or any information relating to the decisions taken at the Team Meetings and/or shall not comment upon any Player/Team Official till the retirement from that particular class of cricket. 

Dalmiya also said that the issues regarding the alleged irregularities in Pilcom accounts could wait, but not the Sourav issue. 

Some of the other issues, which were also discussed at the meeting, included Bengal teams sponsorship by Videocon International, the teams performance in the Ranji Trophy and ratification of the cash awards for the players.

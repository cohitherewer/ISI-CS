 All officials, agents to be interviewed

 - Premier league inquiry aims to clean up game 

 Matt Hughes

Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan police commissioner appointed to head the FA Premier Leagues bung inquiry on Friday, will interview every manager, club director and agent involved in top-flight transfers in the past two years in an attempt to clean up the game. 

Although independent from the Premier League, the 20 Barclays Premiership clubs have pledged to support the ten-strong team of investigators and forensic accountants from Quest, the investigative firm run by Stevens, despite strong reservations expressed by Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool. 

Stevenss six-month inquiry, triggered by claims from Mike Newell, the Luton Town manager, of a bung culture within football, will focus on the 320 Premier League transfers completed by 26 clubs since January 1, 2004. 

The 63-year-old will report back to the Premier League in September, after promising to leave no stone unturned in the search for evidence. 

Managers, players and club officials are expected to give evidence to his team of investigators, though there are no sanctions with which to punish those who refuse to co-operate. 

I will personally overview the inquiry and ensure that it meets the highest standards of investigation and evidence gathering, Stevens said. 

It is our intention to interview all those involved in the transfer process and to examine all transfers during the period. In addition, a number will be subjected to a more detailed investigation criteria set by myself. 

I am conscious that there have been persistent allegations in the press and I would be grateful if those responsible for the articles would provide to my team any supporting evidence or leads that they might have. We will not be distracted or diverted from whether or not irregularities exist, and if there is evidence of wrongdoing it shall be highlighted. 

Richard Scudamore, the Premier League chief executive, is confident that Stevens will detect any malpractice and insisted that the inquiry would not hinder a similar investigation by the FA. 

This investigation has specific terms of reference and a distinguished chairman, Scudamore said. What is different this time is that we will give it all the resources it needs. 

We dont know what the outcome will be. All the board is interested in is the truth. The Football Association has said it will fully co-operate with this inquiry because its interests are entirely aligned with ours. If there are breaches of the rules, we will deal with it. It is a serious inquiry. 

Having triggered the whole affair because of his frustration at the practices of certain agents, Newell welcomed the inquiry. They have appointed somebody, so I am pleased about that, he said. If they want to get to the bottom of it, he will need wide-ranging powers. But anybody who believes it doesnt happen and hasnt happened is in for a big shock.

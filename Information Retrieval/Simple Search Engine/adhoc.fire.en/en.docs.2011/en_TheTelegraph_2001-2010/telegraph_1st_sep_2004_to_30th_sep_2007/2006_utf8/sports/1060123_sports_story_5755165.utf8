Calcutta: Everything at Eden Gardens on Sunday afternoon pointed to a Bengal triumph. Even the normally reserved Deep Dasgupta accepted it would be next to impossible not to make the title-round from here, though, he wasnt ready for the celebrations yet. Balwinder Singh Sandhus hopes of a turnaround had all but faded by close on the third day. 

Bengal are set to make the final for the first time since 1993-94. It will be a home tie if they take on Mumbai, but if Uttar Pradesh return triumphant in the other semi-final, they will have to play in Kanpur/Lucknow. 

A record 314-run partnership for the sixth-wicket between Deep Dasgupta and Laxmi Ratan Shukla had generated a 276-run lead by close. The Bengal pair dominated, at times slaughtered, and ultimately frustrated the insipid Baroda attack into submission. Even a negative line adopted by Baroda wasnt enough to stop Bengal. 

Deeps career-best 171 (357 balls, 520 minutes, 21x4) was his fourth century in Ranji Trophy and second this season after the 143 versus Gujarat. The former India wicketkeeper was an epitome of discipline, concentration and application. There were no loose shots attempted and he proved that he was worthy of the responsibility thrust on him. 

Not just his own innings, he also had to shoulder the burden of guiding Shukla along their partnership that lasted almost a full day. The Bengal captain carried a cool head on his shoulders which he managed to rub off on his partner. He was constantly egging on Shukla and making him bat with resolve. 

Till he snicked to Pinal Shah, it looked like Baroda didnt have enough ammunition to dismiss him. Their stand eclipsed 283 by Syed Saba Karim and Srikant Kalyani against Bihar in Patna, 1995-96. 

Sensing that Shukla was prone to make mistakes as he approached the three-figure mark, the official scorer was asked not to display his individual score as he was nearing 80. However, once Shukla felt comfortable in the 90s, the scoreboard flashed his figures. 

The allrounder showed no signs of nerves as he completed his century with a six off Rajesh Pawar. Shuklas unbeaten 137 (353 balls, 447 minutes, 19x4, 1x6) was his maiden hundred in Ranji. Bengals highest run-getter last season survived two chances, but showed enough motivation and diligence during his stay. 

It was an uncharacteristic innings from Shukla. The flamboyance was missing. Rather, there was a concrete effort to play into the gaps, keep the scoreboard moving and bat out the whole day. In a way his batting reflected the spirit and attitude of the young guns in the Bengal ranks. 

Having not done anything of note this season, he chose to strike it rich at the big stage. Having achieved success, he is capable of pulling off a double hundred. Bengal will look to bat through the order on Monday, and Shukla will have enough chance to reach another landmark. Concentration and patience, though, will be the key.

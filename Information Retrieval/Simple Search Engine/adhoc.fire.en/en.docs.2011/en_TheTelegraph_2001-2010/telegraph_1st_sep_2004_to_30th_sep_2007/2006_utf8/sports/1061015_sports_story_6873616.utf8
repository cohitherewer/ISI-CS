 PCBs 

 no to Inzys India visit

 SHARP SINGLES

 Andrew Symonds during Australias 

 practice in Mumbai on Saturday

Karachi: 

 The new regime in the Pakistan Cricket Board has denied 

 Inzamam-ul Haq the permission to visit India and commentate 

 on television during the Champions Trophy in line with its 

 policy to keep tight control on the players.

 PCBs concerns are primarily 

 twofold. At a time when Pakistan cricket is shrouded in 

 controversies, PCB thinks any ill-judged comment by Inzamam 

 could add fuel to the fire. Also, Inzamam was to return 

 home only on November 7 and, just four days later, Pakistan 

 are due to meet the West Indies in the first Test in Lahore. 

 Younis to play for 

 Yorkshire 

 Karachi: Pakistans stand-in 

 captain for ICC Champions Trophy Younis Khan has signed 

 for English County Yorkshire as a player and not as a captain. 

 Younis had announced few days back that Yorkshire had offered 

 him a contract to captain their team in next years 

 championship. Vote 

 for Watson 

 Mumbai: Australias Andrew 

 Symonds is backing fellow allrounder Shane Watson for the 

 role of opening batsman in one-day cricket. Technically, 

 I think he is capable of doing a good job there, Symonds 

 told reporters after practice on Saturday. Joint 

 pledge

 Calcutta: The United Nations and 

 ICC has come together to help run out HIV and AIDS across 

 the cricketing world, as well as address such issues as 

 poverty and illiteracy.

 Players from both India and England 

 will support a pledge read by Ravi Shastri, who is a goodwill 

 ambassador for Unicef in India, as part of the UN Millennium 

 Campaigns Stand Up Against Poverty, Stand Up 

 for the Millennium Development Goals challenge.

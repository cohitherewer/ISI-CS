Calcutta: As an 11-year-old, Surya Sekhar Ganguly did hit the headlines beating GM Gregory Serper in the Goodricke Open in Calcutta more than decade back. Surya was the youngest to do so. The IndianOil employee who clinched the national title for the third successive year has carved out a niche for himself in Indian chess since then. 

His Elo rating of 2578 defies his strength. With an incredible will to win, Surya works hard and has a phenomenal memory. A penultimate round loss to GM Abhijit Kunte in the National A had endangered Suryas qualification for the Olympiad squad. He faced a must-win situation in the last round not only to retain his title, but also to ensure a berth in the Olympiad squad. He not only won his game with the black pieces but did it in style too. 

Surya himself considers his last game with S. Kidambi the best game in his entire career. I havent played under so much pressure in my entire career. I had black and Kidambi is one of the most solid players in India, Surya told The Telegraph on his arrival to Calcutta. 

According to the Calcutta GM, before the game, he prepared from seven in the evening to well past midnight and figured his strongest and his weakest points. I decided to take the game out of theory, Surya said. My plan and strategy paid rich dividends and I managed to win the game in 26 moves said a contented Surya. 

Surya is happy with the composition of the Olympiad squad. Viswanathan Anand, P. Harikrishna, Krishnan Sasikiran, Sandipan Chanda, Diwakar Prasad Singh and himself and is confident of a medal prospect for the Indian team. 

Our chances of getting a medal in Turin is excellent. The last time we finished sixth in Spain, though we could have finished higher. We were even winning against Russia but ultimately went down 2.5- 1.5 rued Surya. I definitely believe we are a stronger team now. 

Asked whether he plans to discuss strategy with Anand during the Olympiad? Surya answered in affirmative. Of course, we will discuss and Anand is always very helpful. I remember, the last time we discussed the openings in general before the game or during dinner. His knowledge of the openings is very deep and was always forthcoming with his views. said Surya. 

Surya seemed happy that Neelotpal Das achieved his final GM norm. Neelotpal works hard and is an excellent fighter, he said. 

Surya was all praise for the duo of Mary Ann Gomes and Bitan Banerjee. I am highly impressed by Mary Ann and Bitans play. 

Mary was really impressive at the Nationals. She is focused and plays to win. But the Olympiad will be a test of her character and strength because she will met the worlds top players there felt Surya. 

Surya will leave for Goa for the coaching camp on April 27 along GM Sandipan Chanda and WIM Mary Ann Gomes.

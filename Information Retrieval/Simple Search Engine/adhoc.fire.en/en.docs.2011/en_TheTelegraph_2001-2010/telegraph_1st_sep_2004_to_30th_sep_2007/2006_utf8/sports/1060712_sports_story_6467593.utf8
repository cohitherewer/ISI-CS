 Nadal escapes unhurt

Madrid: French Open champion Rafael Nadal escaped unhurt after the car in which he was travelling hit an electricity pylon in Manacor, Mallorca, Spanish media reported on Tuesday. 

The 20-year-old world No.2 returned to his hometown on the island on Monday after losing to Roger Federer in the mens singles final at Wimbledon. 

A Spanish news agency reported that a woman who lived nearby went to investigate after hearing the noise of the accident and found Nadal dizzy but unhurt. 

She said the tennis player recovered after having a drink at her house and the car was taken away by a tow truck.

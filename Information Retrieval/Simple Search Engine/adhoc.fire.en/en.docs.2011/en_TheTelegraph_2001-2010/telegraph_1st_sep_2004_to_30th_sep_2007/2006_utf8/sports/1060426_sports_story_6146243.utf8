The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Uneasy start to last day card 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 The Family Welfare Stakes, the 

 main event in the last days card at the Delhi races 

 on Tuesday, was declared null and Void by the stewards following 

 a crowd demonstration. A large number of punters protested 

 against negative tactics adopted by some jockeys during 

 the race. Rest of the six races were held uninterrupted 

 after the stewards decision.

 The season ended on a happy note for trainer A.Khan and jockey Rajinder who were champions in their respective fields.

 Chance to avenge loss to Windies: Dravid

 Malaysia Tri-Series

 Bangalore: India would 

 seek to avenge their one-day series loss to the West Indies 

 when both nations meet in the tri-series in Malaysia, captain 

 Rahul Dravid said on Thursday.

 We havent done well 

 against the Caribbeans in the last series. This is a good 

 chance for us to correct that, Dravid said about the 

 tri-series, also involving Australia.

 We are confident. If we 

 play some good cricket, we can get some good results. Australia 

 are obviously the best team in the world and its exciting 

 to play against them. They have a very good track record 

 and they play some very good cricket, he said at the 

 conclusion of the nine-day rolling camp on Thursday.

 Dravid said the boys have done 

 commando-style training in preparation for the new season.It 

 is just a chance to give people different experiences. If 

 you keep following the same routine, sometimes people can 

 become a bit stale and bored.

 The Team India captain said the 

 two practice games at Chennai on Friday and Saturday were 

 aimed at giving the players match-practice.

 Dravid, however, said the players 

 were unanimous in their opinion that individual members 

 as well as the team as a whole needed to improve their fielding. 

 In all the interviews we had with the boys, there 

 was pretty much unanimity... Everyone in the team felt that 

 the area where we wanted to improve individually and the 

 team could really make some strides, was in the fielding 

 department.

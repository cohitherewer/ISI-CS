The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Mahanama: Jonty made diving glamorous 

 - The Match Referee, one of the finest fielders of his time, speaks exclusively to The Telegraph 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Roshan Mahanama 

Former Sri Lankan (one-day) captain Roshan Mahanama wasnt just a very dependable middle-order bat, but was among the finest of fielders in any position. A Match Referee for a couple of years, a job which has brought him to India this time, the 39-year-old Mahanama spoke to The Telegraph exclusively on fielding the other day. Incidentally, he was a member of Arjuna Ranatungas world-conquering team in 1996. 

The following are excerpts 

On the essentials for having a presence on the field 

Fitness, thats No.1... Flexibility, agility... Everything comes with fitness... Next is putting in a huge effort and its not without reason that players are still told that practice makes perfect... Also, youve got to keep your eyes on the ball till it has lodged in the palm... Talking of myself, I would take around 100 catches in almost every workout... I also worked on hitting the stumps... (Adds laughing) Quite like my batting, I fielded in almost all positions! 

 On having been an outstanding fielder (the run outs havent been documented, but he took 56 catches in Tests and 109 in ODIs) 

I played in an era when everybody had begun to realise it would be difficult hiding those who couldnt field... That fielding was as important as any specialised job... I can truthfully say there were times in the first two-three years of my career when I made the squad and, then, the XI only because I was an asset on the field... Taking it easy, as a fielder, could have harmed my career... Today, the emphasis on fielding is even more and theres no place for passengers. In fact, to be a good cricketer, youve got to be good in two departments. 

On whether surgery on the left knee pretty early in his career (1989) ever made him tentative 

At one time, there were fears that my fielding could suffer... However, thankfully, no such thing happened. 

On his top fielders 

(After a pause) Ill pick four, but make a mention of Viv Richards, who effected three run outs in the 1975 World Cup final against Australia... Unfortunately, I didnt see much of him live though. 

Mohammed Azharuddin: His flexibility was exceptional and nobody could throw the way he did, despite being off-balance... He defied the manuals and had the ability to field in any position. Azhar wasnt ordinary. 

Gus Logie: Be it point or at short-leg, he was brilliant. Actually, given the period in which he played, he wouldnt have got into the West Indies team if he wasnt outstanding in the field... Given his size, he was deceptive. 

Ricky Ponting: Fields in any position and is getting better despite being 31... The way he focuses, particularly the way he keeps his eyes on the ball, is worthy of emulation... Youngsters should observe his fielding in Australias next match (in Bangladesh, from Sunday)... Ricky takes blinders, gets direct hits... What else would you want? 

Jonty Rhodes: He gave a different dimension to fielding... He was like Boris Becker ? throwing himself, diving here and there... His athleticism was remarkable. Unlike most, who would stand up and then throw, Jonty did so lying on the ground... He made diving glamorous and every effort of his stuck in the minds of fans. 

On Yuvraj Singh 

Hes one of the best of the present times, as is Mohammed Kaif... I have a high regard for Tillekeratne Dilshan, too. 

Finally, his message for youngsters 

If youre looking at a career, work on your fielding as you would on batting or bowling... A decent fielder may have a short innings, but the good ones alone are going to have a long career... The one-day game exposed many, now the Twenty20 version will make it more difficult for those who lack the qualities of a good fielder. (After a pause) Dont wait for the coach to make you work, put in the effort yourself... Of course, if you dont enjoy fielding, you wont be good... As a kid, I would get a tennis or a rubber ball and regularly collect rebounds off the walls... That sharpened my reflexes and the exercise was enjoyable as well.

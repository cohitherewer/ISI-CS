 Baskaran may take over

New Delhi: Amid speculation of another unceremonious sacking of the national hockey coach, Olympian V. Baskaran was on Sunday tipped to take over the reins of the struggling team, for the second time in six years. 

Baskaran emerged as the frontrunner for the job with sources backing the former player to replace incumbent Rajinder Singh Jr. 

Baskaran is most likely to replace Rajinder Singh, sources in the Indian Hockey Federation (IHF) said. 

The official announcement of Baskarans recall is expected tomorrow or the day after, they added. 

In fact, well before the team left for Melbourne, Baskaran was all set to take over with Harinder Singh as his assistant. But due to pressure from certain quarters and wary of facing the media over the issue, the IHF recalled Rajinder. (PTI)

 Yadav suspended again 

 STAR RACER

 Calcutta: With stewards tightening the noose on erring professionals, the city racing is beginning to return to the desired course. Stewards were seen taking a keen interest even in the routine affairs instead of depending on the support staff.

 As a result of this, jockey R.Yadav earned a back-to-back suspension. This time for eight race days for riding Lightning Flash into the ground in the String Of Pearls Cup. Last week, Yadav was slapped a four-week ban for riding a half-hearted race on Tomahawk.

 Nevertheless, Vijay Singhs Flemenco Star, ridden by C.Alford, justified his odds in the Real Danger Handicap with a three-length-plus victory.

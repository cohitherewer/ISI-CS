 Should still be in the Cup: Cahill

 - Austalia: 

 The day after heartbreak

Kaiserlautern: The Australian players leave the World Cup with their heads held high. And a sour taste in their mouths. The Socceroos, ranked 42nd and in their first appearance at the tournament in 32 years, won kudos for their comebacks and never-day-die attitude in reaching the second round. But they exited on a debatable penalty call with just 12 seconds remaining in a 0-1 loss to Italy. 

We should still be in this World Cup, said an emotional Tim Cahill, one of many players upset at Australias treatment at the hands of tournament referees. 

But others could see the bigger picture. 

Being very close, on a disputed penalty, to go to the last eight of the world is a tremendous achievement, said coach Guus Hiddink. 

Captain Mark Viduka also saw positives. 

We played some very nice football. Today and on the other days as well. I think weve got a lot of followers just because of the way we played, the way we never gave up in any game. It is a sour way to finish, but weve got to deal with it. 

That is a big challenge. 

Football Federation Australia (FFA) has big shoes to fill now that Hiddink is leaving to take over the Russian national team. In just a year in a largely part-role, Hiddink turned the Australians into a frighteningly fit team that could carry out his savvy tactics. 

But Hiddink was unable to make the Australian finishing more lethal, or manufacture more depth in the squad. 

Australia faces other hurdles. 

With the top players contracted to clubs in Europe, summoning them to the other side of the world for national team duty is always going to be contentious. And Australia recently quit Oceania for the more challenging Asian Football Confederation. 

Prime Minister John Howard captured the feelings of a nation on Tuesday when he said he was brokenhearted, adds a report from Sydney. I am brokenhearted, Howard said, adding it was a very cruel way to lose. The team has been fantastic and the country is so proud of them. They performed way above where they were rated and its just a very cruel way to lose... right on the knocker like that. 

Id just say that I am very proud of them. I think 20 million Australians have very proud hearts for the way they fought. 

The Socceroos, meanwhile, are all set to cash in on their success. Every member of the 23-man squad will pocket at least $150,000 dollars after the FFA decided to split the millions it expects to raise from an auction of their signed shirts, Australian newspaper Daily Telegraph reported on Tuesday. 

Moreover, the new-found interest for the sport among people might also mean the soccer heroes clinching big marketing deals, it quoted experts as saying. 

Neer Korn, director of a major corporate market research firm, Heartbeat, told the paper that the Socceroos earning potential was currently huge. 

Several of the Australian players have also caught the attention of some important European clubs. 

Neill, currently with Blackburn Rovers in England, has piqued the interest of Spanish giants Barcelona, as well as English Premierships Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle, while Brett Emerton is said to be a target for Italian powerhouse AC Milan, the paper reported.

 BCCI asks for more venues

New Delhi: The Indian cricket board has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to add more venues to the current three that they have cleared for the Champions Trophy this year. 

The BCCI treasurer N. Srinivasan, while speaking to the reporters on Monday said that India is still keen to host the biennial one-day tournament but needed to resolve some outstanding issues. 

The BCCI president at the ICC meeting in Pakistan this month drew attention to the fact that maybe more than three venues might be required as there are 21 matches in all, Srinivasan said. But the ICC board has taken a view that three centres are sufficient. 

Mumbai, New Delhi and Calcutta have been named as the venues for the tournament in October and November. 

 Meanwhile, the BCCI on Monday decided to extend its platinum pension scheme to widows of Test cricketers and umpires. 

As per the resolution passed by the working committee widows of the cricketers and umpires who retired prior to December 31, 1975, shall continue to get the pension for their lifetime. (AGENCIES)

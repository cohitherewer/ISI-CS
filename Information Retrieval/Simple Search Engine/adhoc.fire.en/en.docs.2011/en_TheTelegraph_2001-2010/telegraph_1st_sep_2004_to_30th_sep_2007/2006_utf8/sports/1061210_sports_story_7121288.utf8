The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Soma takes silver

 - I wanted to win this for Sushmita, says heptathlete 

JAYDEEP BASU

Doha: Soma Biswas described it as a winning race. Those who watched it at the Khalifa Stadium on Saturday knew it was the race of her life. 

With JJ Sobha breathing down her neck after some good showing in long jump and javelin, Soma ran a splendid 800metres in heptathlon to win her second back-to-back silver medal in the Asian Games. She then said this was a race which may give a new twist to her career. 

At the start of my career, I never thought of winning an Asian Games medal. Now that I have two in a row, I may even extend my career and go all out in the Olympics, said the Bengal athlete. 

The 800m she ran here was a treat to watch. For more than 400m, she was well behind the pack along with Sobha. But in the last 200m stretch, she increased her pace. 

 It was a burst that even caught her rivals by surprise. In the end, when Soma finished in 2:23.05 minutes, her nearest Vietnamese rival was behind by a good five metres. 

For the Indian fans the event was a double delight as Sobha bagged the bronze with 5662 points. While Olga Rypakova (5955) won the gold by a huge margin, Soma collected 5665 points. Olga came up to hug the Bengal girl immediately after the race. 

Minutes after she won the medal, Soma showed that she doesnt forget her friends. 

This is a medal which I wanted to win badly not for myself, but for my fellow athlete in Calcutta Sushmita (Singha Roy), said Soma. I dont want to name anyone, but it was not the right decision to exclude her. There were a few people who wanted me to finish with a bronze only. I was determined to prove them wrong. 

At the end of four events on Friday, Soma was placed third. She didnt improve any further in the morning session as she could jump only 6.04m in long jump. While Olga remained the undisputed leader, Sobha jumped to 6.23m to elevate herself to the third position and within 31 points of Somas then score of 4153. 

In javelin, too, Soma finished behind Sobha and the margin of difference came down to just five points. Soma had no option but to go flat out in the 800m. 

In 800m, S Shanti of Tamil Nadu won the silver in 2:03.16. Bahrains Maryam Yusuf Jamal won the gold at 2:01.79. 

In womens 400 metres heat, Pinki Paramanik reached the final with a time of 52.46 seconds. The other Bengal athlete in the fray, high jumper Harishankar Roy ended fourth with a jump of 2.19 metres.

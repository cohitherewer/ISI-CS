 Anand moves to joint third 

 Monaco Chess

 Anand outclassed 

 Vallejo Pons 

 Monaco: Defending champion 

 Viswanathan Anand outclassed Grandmaster Francisco Vallejo 

 Pons of Spain in the rapid game of the third round to take 

 the mini-match by a 1.5-0.5 margin in the 15th Amber Blindfold 

 and Rapid Chess Tournament here.

 The victory helped the Indian 

 super GM keep pace with World Cup winner Levon Aronian of 

 Armenia in the rapid section of the event as the Indian 

 maintained joint lead with him on 2.5 points out of a possible 

 three.

 Anand jumped to the joint third 

 spot in the overall standings with 3.5 points in his kitty 

 alongside world champion Veselin Topalov of Bulgaria and 

 Boris Gelfand of Israel.

 Aronian and Alexander Morozevich 

 of Russia shared the lead in the combined standings with 

 four points apiece.

 The highlight of the day was another 

 stunning defeat for Topalov in the rapid game where he was 

 beaten by Peter Heine Nielsen of Denmark.

 In this unique event, being held 

 on a round-robin basis between 12 players, each round comprises 

 a blindfold and a rapid game.

 In the blindfold section, 20 seconds 

 are added to the clock after every move is made while in 

 the rapid there is a 10 seconds increment.

 It was a Sicilian Nazdorf by Anand 

 and Pons apparently had a tenable position in the middle 

 game when Anand came up with a spectacular blow on the king 

 side that ripped whites position apart. After the 

 tactical melee, Anand appeared with a couple of extra pawns 

 and coasted home after 43 moves.

 Earlier in the blindfold game, 

 the draw as white did not help the Indian ace a great deal 

 as he slipped to joint 10th spot in this section.

 Playing the white side of an open 

 Ruy Lopez, Anand could get little out of opening against 

 the Spanish talent. In the middle game Pons obtained a comfortable 

 position and when it appeared that he was in no trouble 

 whatsoever, Anand thought it wise to take a draw through 

 repetition of moves.

 Topalov accounted for Danish Grandmaster 

 Peter Heine Nielsen in style in the blindfold. However, 

 in the return rapid game, he failed to match Nielsens 

 skills and the latter won in just 33 moves.

 Earlier, Topalov was a lucky winner 

 in the blindfold after Nielsen misplayed a promising position 

 against the world champion.

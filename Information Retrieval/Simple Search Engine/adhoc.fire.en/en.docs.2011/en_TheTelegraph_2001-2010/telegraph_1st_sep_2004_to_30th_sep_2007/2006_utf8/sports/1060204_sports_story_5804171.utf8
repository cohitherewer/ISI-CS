The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 ODIs may well be very different

 - Weve proved that we can play on a green-top, says Younis 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Peshawar: Pakistan vice-captain Younis Khans roots are in this region and, so, its no surprise that he (and Shahid Afridi) have a huge following in Pathan territory. In fact, on Monday, the Arbab Niaz Stadium should be packed with their supporters. 

Younis, though, isnt one to either get carried away by the adulation or get crushed by failure. Main waisa banda nahin hoon... I know cricket is a tough game... I also know the importance of not getting affected by the swings, he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Friday evening, Younis added: Everybody is delighted with the (341 runs) win in the Karachi Test (under his captaincy), but thats history... The ODIs may well be very different and nobody must take anything for granted... 

However, he made the point that Pakistans huge victory ? the highest-ever in terms of runs ? was statement-making as it came on a green-top. 

Younis said: The impression is that Pakistani batsmen cant play on a surface which seams... Cant play on a green-top... By winning big weve proved many wrong and the confidence gained is bound to particularly help us when we tour England in the summer... After all, the wickets there wont be flat. 

Asked whether there would now be even more pressure, having been Man-of-the-Series in the Tests, Younis laughed: Jitna aap sochiye ga, utna pressure hoga... Im a relaxed person and will start the ODIs in a relaxed frame of mind... 

Cool, did someone say?

Calcutta: World No. 13 Martina Hingis will be the star attraction at the WTA Sunfeast Open in the city from September 18. The week-long tournament will also include Indias Sania Mirza. 

Indian doubles star Mahesh Bhupathi ? head of Globosport ? with whom Hingis won the Australian Open mixed doubles title this year, said the full list of participants will only be finalised six weeks before the tournament begins. Like last year, we hope to have a strong field this year too, he said. 

Asked whether defending champion Anastasia Myskina of Russia ? who was the major attraction last year ? would also be seen in action this time, Bhupathi said, I cant say now. 

At a press conference on Wednesday, Bhupathi described Hingis as the perfect modern day player, capable of playing on all surfaces and on all conditions. 

The Swiss player showed admirable resilience in fighting back from a career threatening injury and storming into the top-20 within six months. I expect her to be within the top-10 when the tournament begins, he added. 

Bhupathi also described Hingis as the best doubles partner he has had. 

Hingis was excited at the prospect of playing in India. I have heard a lot about Indian tradition and the excitement the WTA is creating in the country. Im very excited to come and play in front of the passionate tennis fans in Calcutta, a tournament release quoted the star as saying. 

Bhupathi felt that too much should not be read into Sanias recent losses. Shes had tough draws in both French Open and Wimbledon. By no means can they be termed bad performances. Shes playing good tennis. Shes best suited to the hard courts and will have a good chance at the US Open. 

Shes no way near her prime. Her best is yet to come and in the next two to three years the upward slope will continue? She will break into the top 10/15, explained Bhupathi. 

On the personal front, Bhupathi informed he was yet to find a mixed doubles partner for the forthcoming US Open. 

Meanwhile, the design the trophy contest for this years meet will see 400 schools participate from across six metros.

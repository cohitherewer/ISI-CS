 IAAF chief wants 4-year ban for doping

Gothenburg: The president of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) wants athletes who test positive for substances such as steroids to be banned for four years. 

We want to move towards four-year bans, Lamine Diack said on Sunday in Gothenburg, where the European athletics championships start on Monday. We cannot accept any doubts about the performances of our athletes. 

Diacks proposal came a few days after Olympic and world 100 metres champion Justin Gatlin said he had tested positive for testosterone, dealing a serious blow to the showcase Olympic sport. 

Under the current WADA rules, athletes face a two-year suspension for a first doping offence and a life ban in case of a second. (Reuters)

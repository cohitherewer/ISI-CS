The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Well be ready for Sourav: Smith

 - Interesting to see how he fits into team 

Johannesburg: Sourav Ganguly will get a hot reception on arrival in South Africa, if Graeme Smiths comments are anything to go by. 

He has got a lot of runs here and we have a huge respect for him. But its not a worry and we would be ready for him, remarked the South Africa captain ahead of Fridays Twenty20 game here. 

Sourav has been recalled to the Test squad after being ignored for the last 10 months. 

The 33-year old former India captain, whose last appearance for the national team was in the Karachi Test in February, doesnt get along well with coach Greg Chappell. 

Smith recalled the turmoil he witnessed in India when the Chappell-Sourav spat was at its peak and effigies of the former Australian captain were burnt on the streets of Calcutta. 

It will be interesting how he fits into the team, but obviously they have fallen back on experience by selecting (V.V.S.) Laxman and Ganguly. We were expecting that all along, remarked Smith. 

Smith also promised that the Indians wouldnt have it easy in the fifth and final ODI to be played in Centurion on Sunday. The South Africans have won all three games by huge margins after the first game in Joburg was washed out. 

We have done well despite poor starts in all three matches. We never really had a good foundation. Imagine what we could have managed if our foundation was solid. We intend to set it right in the last game. (PTI)

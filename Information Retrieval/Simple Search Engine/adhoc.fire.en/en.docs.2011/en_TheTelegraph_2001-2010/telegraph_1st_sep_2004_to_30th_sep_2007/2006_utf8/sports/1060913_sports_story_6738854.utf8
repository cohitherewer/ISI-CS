The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 We found a way to lose, says Lara

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Brian Lara 

Kuala Lumpur: From 172 for one, the West Indies crashed to 201 all out, an achievement which left captain Brian Lara stunned. 

Its difficult to comprehend... We found a way to lose and, now, weve got to dig deep... Weve got to put this defeat behind us, as the tournament (DLF Cup) isnt over... Weve got the psychological edge against India, having beaten them 4-1 in the last series, and well be looking to build on that, he said after the 78-run defeat at the hands of Australia. 

The match against India is on Thursday. 

Openers Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul had smashed 136 in a mere 18 overs, when the former fell, but what followed after Chanderpauls exit would have given many in the Caribbean a heart attack. 

Conditions definitely were bowler-friendly at the Kinrara Oval, which hosted its first ODI, but the West Indians showed impatience and immaturity. That allowed Shane Watson (who was on a hattrick and finished with four for 43) to bag the MoM award and made Ricky Ponting admit we had an amazing comeback... 

Asked whether the Australians famed mental toughness was a factor, Lara replied: Theyre the world champions and, so, are used to winning... They rested quite a few of their top players, but still won big... Whatever the position, we know theyre going to come out fighting... They arent unbeatable, though... 

He conceded even his bowlers didnt get their act right. We shouldve bowled better... We conceded too many runs (279)... It wasnt a wicket (for that many)... 

Ponting, predictably, praised his men. In fact, he himself played a gem of an innings (54 off 53 balls), but its Michael Clarke who finished the top-scorer 81 from 79. He also expressed satisfaction with Glenn McGraths comeback. 

Glenn bowled too many wides in his first spell, but had more control in the second... He got a wicket as well... We would like him to peak for the Champions Trophy... I think he tried too hard today, Ponting remarked. 

 Captaincy surprise 

Ponting, meanwhile, revealed hed expected Andrew Strauss to captain England for the Ashes face-off later in the season. I expected Strauss to get the nod... Lets see what Andrew Flintoff does (as captain). 

The Australian captain didnt give a detailed comment on the provisional selection of Ashley Giles and the recall of James Anderson, both of whom havent played for months owing to injuries. 

 Ponting didnt go beyond: Doesnt 

 matter... Its irrelevant who theyve named. Right 

 now, were focused on one-day cricket. In time, our 

 focus will be on Tests...

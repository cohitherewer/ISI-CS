 Jeev, changing face of golf

 - Hopes high for Asians winning a Major 

New Delhi: Changing the face of golf was the Asian Tours bold, new tagline in 2006 and the striking image of Jeev Milkha Singh came to the forefront in the regions greatest golf season yet. 

And Jeev was indeed changing the face of Indian golf, too. In a year which saw a record of 27 events offering an all-time high $ 24m in prize money, Jeevs spectacular return to form, in which he claimed a maiden UBS Order of Merit title and four victories around the globe, dominated the season that included numerous milestones. 

Hopes are now high for Asias best players to challenge for a first Major in the near future, especially with established stars including Thongchai Jaidee of Thailand, Koreas Charlie Wi, Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Kapur of India, and young Turks Prom Meesawat and Chinarat Phadungsil of Thailand and Filipino Juvic Pagunsan enjoying fulfilling seasons. 

We are delighted with how our players have performed this season, both at home and abroad, said Kyi Hla Han, the Asian Tours executive chairman. 

Our top players have played some outstanding golf and it is also fantastic that our younger players have also been winning regularly. 

From a playing perspective, it has certainly been a fantastic season, without a doubt one of our better years where our players have performed consistently. Jeev has enjoyed a great season and the international stage awaits him now. 

The golfing world is beginning to take more notice of Asia. This is a strong sign that our players can now compete against the best players and it will only be a matter of time before an Asian player wins a Major. That would be the next step, he added. 

After a seven-year winless run, Jeev claimed the China Open title in April which sparked a terrific run of form. He went on to win Europes season-ending Volvo Masters in Spain followed by back-to-back triumphs in Japan during a six-week purple patch from late October. He also posted 15 other top-10s on three different tours. Starting the year in a lowly 376th place on the official world golf ranking, Jeev will enter 2007 as the 37th-ranked player and he will enjoy starts in all four Majors, including dream debuts at the US Masters and British Open.

 Indians focusing on short-pitched stuff

Benoni: Anil Kumbles return to one-day cricket and the pressure it brings on his bowling colleagues will be the focal point of Indias day-night tour opener against a South Africa A at Willowmoore Park here Thursday. 

Kumble has been dusted off the shelf and put in the one-day mix after Indias recent horrendous run in the limited-overs format. His experience and nagging accuracy have made his fielding travails a minor issue. Suddenly, his World Cup hopes no longer appear just a dream. 

Kumbles presence though will not make life any easy for Indias other World Cup aspirants. Harbhajan Singhs inevitable presence would further turn the screws on the medium-pacers. 

Zaheer Khans return would stir up the pot for the likes of Sreesanth and Munaf Patel, and not to forget Irfan Pathan. 

[Meanwhile, the BCCI sought to downplay the controversy over the unavailability of the team blazers and ties prior to the squads departure, saying it had happened because of a communication gap with their sponsors. 

[It happened because there was a miscommunication with Pantaloons. We thought they would deliver them to the players and thats the reason we had not asked them to carry their old ones. They will be sent to South Africa soon, secretary Niranjan Shah said from Rajkot. 

[What has happened cannot be set right. But it is not a big issue, said chief administrative officer Ratnakar Shetty.] 

The game thus could be instructive in gauging the teams plans ahead of the World Cup. The competition between the medium-pacers would only intensify and only at the end of it would one know who has been left standing. 

India would take no chances with their batsmen and all the top ones are most likely to be paraded in the middle. 

Everyone, from Sachin Tendulkar to Virender Sehwag to Rahul Dravid, would be keen to hit the ground. Mahendra Singh Dhonis elevation in the batting order would also be watched with keen interest. 

Anticipating a barrage of short-pitched deliveries during the series, Indian cricketers sought to sharpen their skills against bouncing balls in the first net session Wednesday. 

The batsmen tested themselves on short-pitched deliveries, especially the ones aimed on their body and heading down the leg side as this is the area they expect South Africans to bowl. 

Some sparring techniques were polished against deliveries rising and aimed outside the off-stump. 

Coach Greg Chappells absence due to food poisoning left each one to his own device. The Australian met his appointment perfectly on arrival on Tuesday but apparently woke up unwell Wednesday morning. 

In his absence, Dravid tried his best to explain to others how to make the most from the net session. A bowling machine was also there during practice.

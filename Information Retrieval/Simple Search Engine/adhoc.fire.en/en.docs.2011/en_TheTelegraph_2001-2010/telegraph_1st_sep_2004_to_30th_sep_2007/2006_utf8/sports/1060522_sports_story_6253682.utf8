 Rathore bags Olympic berth

New Delhi: Olympic silver medallist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore clinched the fourth Olympic berth by winning the double trap gold at the ISSF World Cup in Cairo on Sunday. 

According to information received here, he topped the field with 182 after making it to the finals via sudden death following a tied finish with Qiang Pan of China. 

He shot 137 in the preliminaries but bounced back with an excellent 45 in the final. 

I knew that I wanted to do my best. In the extreme weather conditions, I kept my nerves to get the quota, Rathore said from Cairo. 

People are very thrilled here because it is quite unprecedented to jump from sixth place to number one in the finals, that too after I was in final after sudden death. 

Gagan Narang and Anjali Bhagwat (rifle) and Manavjit Singh Sandhu (trap) are the other three Indians to have won a quota place for the Beijing Games. (PTI)

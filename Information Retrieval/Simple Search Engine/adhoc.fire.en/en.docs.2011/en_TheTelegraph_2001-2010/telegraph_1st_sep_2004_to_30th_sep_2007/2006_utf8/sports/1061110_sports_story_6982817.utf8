 Talukdar

Jamshedpur: Jayanta Talukdar, the captain of the Indian archery team, was on Thursday disqualified on technical grounds in the quarter-finals of mens individual recurve section in the second Commonwealth Archery Championship after an objection raised by the Australian team on the first day of the championship. 

World No. 4 Talukdar, who ousted New Zealand archer James McMohan Nightingale in the second round 112-107 to qualify for the quarter final, was tied at the world-record mark of 347 in the 70m distance with Australian Chris Lewkowski when he was disqualified by judges Neil Dammock (England) and J. Ban Ari (Israel). 

Talukdar had raised the bow to a degree even after he was warned for a similar reason in the second round which led the judges to disqualify him despite his equalising the world mark of 347 held by Korean archer Chio Young Kwang in August 2002. 

However, the Indian officials also are partly to blame for the disqualification as they did not lodge a written appeal against the judgement within the specified time of five minutes. They took 12 mintues to do so. 

Malaysian woman archer Uniza Binti Ismail was also disqualified against Scotlands Muriel Kirkwood in the first round of the compound individual 70m distance.Ismail was leading by 104 against Kirkwoods 94 when the former was disqualified. 

Kirkwood, who moved into the second round, lost to Indias Jhanu Hansda 114-104. Hansda, who defeated Australias Sherry Gale in the quarter final 112-110, is pitted against Linda Garner of England in the semi-final.

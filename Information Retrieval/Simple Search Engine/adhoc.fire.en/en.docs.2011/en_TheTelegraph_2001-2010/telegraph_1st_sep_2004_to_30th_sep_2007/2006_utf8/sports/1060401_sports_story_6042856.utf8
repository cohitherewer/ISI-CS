 Gangjee among 4 Indians in fray

Singapore: Shiv Kapur, Amandeep Johl, Jeev Milkha Singh and Calcuttas Rahil Gangjee will bid for tickets to the British Open when they tee off at the Open Championship International Final Qualifying for Asia at the Sentosa Golf Club here on April 6. 

A total of 37 players will be vying for four berths on offer for the Open to be played at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake from July 20 to 23. 

The field for the 36-hole qualifying event features the cream of the Asian Tour, including Andrew Buckle, Singapores Mardan Mamat and Thai duo Prom Meesawat and Chapchai Nirat. 

Thai sensation Thaworn Wiratchant is the sole Asian Tour player to gain automatic exemption, a reward for being crowned the 2005 Order of Merit winner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Security ring for Saudi players

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: In the face of threats of terrorist attacks ahead of the Independence Day, there was an unprecedented security ring in place during Saudi Arabia players practice session at the SAI on Monday. 

While Eastern Frontier jawans kept a close vigil on the proceedings in the ground, policemen in plain clothes were seen questioning any intruder entering the ground and checking their belongings. 

We are considering places like the IT hub and Salt Lake Stadium as highly sensitive. Plus, Saudi Arabia players are in the city. So, apart from normal security, there will be additional force in and around the stadium, not only during the match, but even after that, Praveen Kumar, SP, North 24 Parganas said.

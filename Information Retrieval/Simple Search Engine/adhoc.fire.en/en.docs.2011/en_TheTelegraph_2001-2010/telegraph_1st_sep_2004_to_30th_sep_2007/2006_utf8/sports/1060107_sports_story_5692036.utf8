The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 I need a bit of luck, says Sourav

 - Dont think Im playing better because Im no longer the captain 

A STAFF REPORTER 

 Sourav Ganguly 

Calcutta: It is not any relief from captaincy but luck, thats what Sourav Ganguly wants to carry with him on the tour of Pakistan. 

Just the other day, his one-time India teammate Hemang Badani ? who cracked 67 and unbeaten 157 against Bengal at the Eden ? stressed on how keen he was to concentrate on batting after relinquishing the hot seat of Tamil Nadu. Indias most successful captain, however, doesnt wish to relate the same view to his own case. 

For the past five-six months, I have been scoring runs in both domestic and Test matches. I also scored runs as captain in Zimbabwe. So, I dont think Im playing better because Im no longer the captain, Sourav said after he was dismissed for 88 on Friday. 

Bengal eventually lost the match by 222 runs in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group A match. 

Its not a question about whether you are relieved without being the captain. True, its a different phase? its about less responsibility because as a captain you have to keep too many things on your mind. But it is the same for all captains, he added. 

Sourav, who was asked to play the match by the BCCI before going to Pakistan, felt that against Inzamam-ul Haq amp; Co. there will be pressure to perform not only on him, but the entire team. But he exuded confidence that his experience and expertise will hold him in good stead. 

Its going to be a contest between two good sides. Ive been playing international cricket for 10 years and gone through a number of tough tours. So I know how to live through pressure. Whoever is on the trip to Pakistan will be under pressure. I will just go about my job, concentrate on my cricket and at the end of the day, I need a bit of luck? lets see how it goes, Sourav pointed out. 

Are you ready to open in Pakistan? The middle-order bat decided to leave it to the team management. Its to be decided by the captain, coach and vice-captain, he said. 

Sourav also insisted that that Team Indias triumphs in both Test and ODI series in Pakistan under his captaincy two years ago is history and Lahore (where the first Test is slated to begin on next Friday) throws up an entirely different challenge. 

Is there any difference between Pakistan he had led against in 2004 and now? Its almost the same side. Probably, Salman Butt was not in their squad at that time, he said. 

Sourav also played down his role as an allrounder in the team. I think Im primarily a batsman who can bowl a bit? Thats how I have been for the last 10 years, he remarked. 

Sourav also didnt pick any player who could make the difference between the two sides. It may be Shoaib (Akhtar), (Rahul) Dravid, Ganguly or Sachin (Tendulkar)? Inzamam is also playing well. But what you do on a particular day is what matters most. Both sides are good and whoever players better will have the edge (in the series), he said.

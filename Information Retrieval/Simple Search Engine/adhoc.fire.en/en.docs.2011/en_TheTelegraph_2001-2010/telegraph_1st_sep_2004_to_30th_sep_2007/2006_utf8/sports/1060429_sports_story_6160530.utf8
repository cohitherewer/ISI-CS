 Zaheers 10-wkt haul in vain

London: Zaheer Khans 10-wicket haul went in vain as Worcestershire suffered a 227-run loss with a day to spare against Somerset in a County Championship Division II match at the Worcester County Ground on Friday. 

Zaheer, who had picked four wickets in the first innings, once again claimed six for 40 as the visitors were bundled out for 120 in the second innings. He had a match haul of 10/140. Worcestershire, needing 366 to win, were bundled out for 138.

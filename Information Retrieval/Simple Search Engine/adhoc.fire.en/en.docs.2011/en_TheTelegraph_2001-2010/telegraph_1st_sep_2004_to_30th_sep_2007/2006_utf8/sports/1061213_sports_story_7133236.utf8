 Saurav in squash semis

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Doha: It was an unusual battle ground for two of India s top squash players. At the crowded Khalifa Squash and Tennis Complex Tuesday, Saurav Ghosal and Ritwik Bhattacharya fought it out for a place in the semi-finals in the Asian Games with the former finally clinching it with a 3-1 verdict. 

Ghosal won the first two sets before losing the third, but settled the issue in the fourth to make last-four. 

Bhattacharya, who received a nose injury a few days back, was not at his best. But he denied the injury had affected his performance. It is not like that, said Bhattacharya, who had lost to Ghosal in the National championships in New Delhi a few months ago. 

Bhattacharya conceded that Ghosal played well and was the deserving winner. I feel happy for him because he now has a chance to make the final. 

Ghosal refused to comment whether Bhattacharyas injury helped him reach the semi-finals. I cannot comment on that since he is a highly experienced player. He masked it very well. 

As Ghosal was mobbed by the Indian fans after the match, he sounded emotional. It was great to see so many people come for the match. People may expect me to win the gold, but I know it is not going to be easy. Now I will focus on just one match at a time. 

In hockey, the Indian forwards finally regained their ability to score, but it came a bit too late. In the classification match for fifth to eighth spot, India hammered Chinese Taipei 12-1. Chief coach Vasudevan Baskaran later said that the entire team was still to recover from the shock of losing to China that cost them a place in the semi-finals. He also claimed that the Indian team has the best lot of strikers in Asia. 

It is tough because we are still thinking about the loss to China, said the former Olympic gold winner. My players have realised that they played badly against China , but today they had a chance to make some amends. But its still disappointing that we couldnt make semis. 

For India , who led 3-1 at the half time, V Raghunath scored five goals from penalty corners. Shivendra Singh (2), Arjun Halappa, Tejbir Singh, Tushar Khandekar, Rajpal Singh and Adam Sinclair completed the rout.

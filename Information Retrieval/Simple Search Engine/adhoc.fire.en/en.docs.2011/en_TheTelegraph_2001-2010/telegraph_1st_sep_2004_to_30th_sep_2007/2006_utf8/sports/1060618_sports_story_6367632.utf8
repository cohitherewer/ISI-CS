 I will resign after return: Petkovic

Billerbeck: Serbia-Montenegros head coach Ilija Petkovic will quit the national team after the World Cup. 

I will resign when we return home, Petkovic said on Saturday. 

 The announcement came after Serbia-Montenegros 0-6 loss to Argentina on Friday that ranked as the worst in their World Cup history. 

Also quitting will be captain Savo Milosevic, defender Mladen Krstajic and midfielder Predrag Djordjevic who announced their retirements from the national team even before the World Cup. 

 Serbia-Montenegro conceded only one goal in 10 qualifying matches, but leaked seven in its first two Group C matches against The Netherlands and Argentina. The Serbs, still to play Ivory Coast on Wednesday, have no chances of making the second round. 

 Fridays loss was the worst for Serbia or the former Yugoslavia at the World Cups since a 1-6 semi-final defeat against Uruguay at the first edition in 1930. 

Serbia-Montenegros appearance in Germany is the national teams 10th trip to the World Cup, but the first ? and last ? under that name. Montenegro voted for independence in May.

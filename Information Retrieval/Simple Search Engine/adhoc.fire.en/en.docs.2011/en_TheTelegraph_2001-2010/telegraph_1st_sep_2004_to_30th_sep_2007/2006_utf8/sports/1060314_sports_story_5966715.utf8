 Sania sets up date with Dementieva

New Delhi: Sania Mirza pulled up her socks in time to clinch a second-round win and set up a clash with world No. 8 Elena Dementieva of Russia in the $2.1 million Pacific Life Open WTA Tour event in Indiana Wells on Sunday. 

Sania, who slipped to 45 in world rankings last week, defeated local qualifier Bethanie Mattek 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 to advance to the third round of the tier I tournament. 

The Indian, who had a bye in the first round, will have a tough job on hands when she takes on Dementieva. 

Earlier, Shikha Uberoi bowed out to M. Camarine of Italy 7-6 (5), 4-6, 2-6 in the qualifiers last week.

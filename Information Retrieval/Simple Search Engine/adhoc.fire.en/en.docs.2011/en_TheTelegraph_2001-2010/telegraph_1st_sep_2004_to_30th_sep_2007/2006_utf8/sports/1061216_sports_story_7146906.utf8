 Sangakkara rescues Lanka

Wellington: An unbeaten century by Kumar Sangakkara helped Sri Lanka take first-day honours in the second Test against New Zealand on Friday. 

A determined Sangakkara was at his majestic best as he produced a near flawless 156 not out while wickets tumbled around him, with Sri Lanka all out for 268 and New Zealand 66 for four in reply at stumps. In a frenetic day on a pitch, 14 wickets fell including six ducks. 

Mahela Jayawardene again won the toss, chose to bat, and was let down by his openers.

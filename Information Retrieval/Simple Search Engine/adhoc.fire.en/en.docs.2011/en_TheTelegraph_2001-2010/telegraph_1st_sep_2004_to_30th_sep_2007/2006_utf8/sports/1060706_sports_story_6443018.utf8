 Real want Beckham to stay on forever

London: Real Madrid want England midfielder David Beckham to stay at the club forever, newly-elected president Ramon Calderon said on Wednesday. 

Hes very important for us. Very, very important in any sense, he told a news channel in an interview before Real confirmed that Italian Fabio Capello was returning for a second stint as coach. 

Hes a premium player, magnificent. All the supporters here are very much with him and of course hes very important in the commercial area, added the 55-year-old lawyer. I want to have him with us forever, at least the three years I think we have still with him. 

The new president promised in his election campaign that he would sign Arsenals Spanish international midfielder Cesc Fabregas, Chelseas Dutch winger Arjen Robben and AC Milans Brazilian midfielder Kaka. 

He (Fabregas) wants apparently to come here, he said. 

I know that (former Real player and sporting director Predrag) Mijatovic has been in touch with his (Fabregas) representatives and he has said he is very much interested in joining us, he added.

 Hanif: Shoaib, Asif victims of personal grudge

Karachi: Former captain Hanif Mohammed feels banned fast bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammed Asif were victims of personal grudge by the Pakistan Cricket Board appointed tribunal, which was not neutral. 

The way the national cricketers have been punished was a source of embarrassment for all. 

If both players were at fault, they should be punished but the punishment should not be so severe that it could bring their careers to an end, Hanif said. 

I can say with full confidence that most of the batsmen in the world fear Shoaib. He is the fastest bowler in the world. 

In the absence of these bowlers, it would be hard for the Pakistan to reach the second round in next years World Cup, he was quoted as saying. 

He also said Pakistans victory against the West Indies in the Lahore Test should not blind them as Brian Lara was in excellent form and could pose to be a serious threat. 

Shoaib was banned for two years and Asif for one after the duo tested positive for banned steroid nandrolone in the PCBs internal dope test before the Champions Trophy.

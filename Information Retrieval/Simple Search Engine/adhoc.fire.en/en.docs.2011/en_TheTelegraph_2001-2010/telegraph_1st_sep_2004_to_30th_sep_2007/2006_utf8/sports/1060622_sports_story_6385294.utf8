 Domenech stirs Swiss nest

Bad Bertrich: Switzerland have accused French coach Raymond Domenech of playing mind games following his comments that the Swiss have benefited from favourable World Cup refereeing. 

The Swiss were fortunate not to concede penalties in their first two Group G matches against France and Togo, but assistant coach Michel Pont insisted that there was nothing unusual about the incidents. 

In the long history of Swiss football we have also had plenty of decisions that have not gone our way, so I guess its equal for all teams, Pont said on Wednesday. 

I think Domenech is maybe trying to put some extra pressure on Switzerland with these statements but we are not going to let ourselves get stressed by what he says. 

Domenech felt his side should have been given a penalty when a shot from French striker Thierry Henry struck the hand of Swiss defender Patrick Mueller. The referee ignored the claims, however, and the two teams went on to draw 0-0. 

Togo had more cause to feel aggrieved during their encounter with the Swiss after Henrys Arsenal teammate Emmanuel Adebayor appeared to be brought down in the box with Mueller again the man involved. (REUTERS)

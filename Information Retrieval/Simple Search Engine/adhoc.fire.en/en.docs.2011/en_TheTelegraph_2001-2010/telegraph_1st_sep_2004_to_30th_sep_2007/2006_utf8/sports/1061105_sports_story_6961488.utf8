 Aussies better prepared for elusive title 

 - West Indies look to make most of the unpredictable tag at Brabourne today 

Mumbai: Australia are confident they can win the only major one-day title missing from their collection when they take on the West Indies in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday, captain Ricky Ponting said on Saturday. 

There has been a lot made of us not having won this tournament before but the facts are we have been in this position many times, he said. 

We have probably won more one-day finals, one-day tournaments, and World Cups than any other team. Certainly a lot more than the West Indies have. 

The world champions lost in the semi-finals of the previous two competitions. 

We know what it takes to win big games and we will see how the West Indian players will cope under pressure tomorrow, Ponting added. 

Ponting said Australia would not be complacent, especially after losing to the holders in the group phase at the same venue. 

That was the first game of the tournament, we are better prepared now, said Ponting. 

They are a very capable team and have shown that through this tournament. (Chris) Gayle has been the player of the tournament so far. (Ian) Bradshaw has been very good and Taylor has been very good too. 

In this tournament, the best two teams have made it through to the final. 

Not taking any chances, Lara has told his team to play intelligent cricket on Sunday. The Australians try to impose themselves on any opposition they play, Lara said. 

You have to play intelligent cricket, match them at all times, and take that extra step when the right time comes. 

Playing with flair or attacking cricket is not going to scare the Australians. You have to play sensibly, put in a good team effort. The smarter team is going to win. 

Despite their win in the group phase, Lara said Australia were the favourites. Of course theyre the favourites. Theyre world champions, the No. 1. Going into the match youd be unwise to think otherwise. 

(But) I love the tag unpredictable, which means that no opposition, no matter how strong they are, can think that theyre going to roll over us.

 German daily on Wednesday.

 He named Neville, Roberto Carlos, 

 Bobby Moore and Franz Beckenbauer as his back-four. In the 

 midfield, he put himself alongside George Best, Lothar Matthaeus 

 and Zinedine Zidane. His striking duo was made up of Ronaldo 

 and Maradona. Peter Schmeichel was his all-time top goalkeeper. 

 Blatter: India key market

 New Delhi: India is a key 

 market with regards to soccer viewership and huge fan following 

 as compared to other south-Asian nations, Fifa president 

 Sepp Blatter said on Wednesday. I am pleasantly surprised 

 with the great interest in soccer in a cricket crazy nation 

 like India. The special effort to telecast the 2006 Fifa 

 World Cup in Hindi will give further boost to the viewership, 

 Blatter said in an ESPN-Star Sports release.

 Dusan pulled out

 Billerbeck: Serbia amp; 

 Montenegro will conduct their campaign with only 22 players 

 following a meeting with Fifa on Wednesday to discuss whether 

 they could call up a replacement for Dusan Petkovic. The 

 son of coach Ilija Petkovic, Dusan was pulled out of the 

 squad after a row over nepotism.

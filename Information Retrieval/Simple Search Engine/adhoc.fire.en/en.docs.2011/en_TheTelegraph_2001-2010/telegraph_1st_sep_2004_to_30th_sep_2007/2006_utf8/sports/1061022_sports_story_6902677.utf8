 Randhawa takes one-shot lead

 Indian Open 

New Delhi: Jyoti Randhawa and Shiv Shankar Prasad Chowrasia ensured enough fireworks on the Delhi Golf Club Course on the Diwali Day as the Indian golfers threatened to run away with all major honours in the Hero Honda Indian Open. 

Six Indians figured among top nine and there were three others inside top-20 adding a sparkle to their celebration. 

With one more day to go in the 42nd edition of the Open, Randhawa fired eight-under 64, just one off the course record, to total 16-under 200 and take a one shot lead over Chowrasia, who himself had a five-under 67 that gave him a total of 15-under 201. 

Not left too far behind was Englishman Simon Dyson who for the third day in a row had an eagle on his card during a round of 68. He was 13-under and just three off the leader. 

In the bunch for fourth were five players, three of them Indians, including overnight co-leader Vijay Singh, who despite a two-under 70 slid down the ladder. 

Gaurav Ghei, a dangerous customer on this course and great last-round player, shot a stunning seven-under 65, bettered only by Randhawa, moved into the frame at 12-under 204. 

In the same bunch was Mukesh Kumar (66), who lamented the lack, or rather the complete absence of any tournament play since mid-May. The two visiting players in this tie for fourth were Prom Meesawat (68), No. 2 on the Asian Tour Order of Merit, and Unho Park (69). 

 I tried to stay in the present and kept focusing on my job, as my mind trainer Dr Tarun Jain has advised me, said Randhawa. (PTI)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 17 wkts fall on Day I

 - Zaheer, Balaji scalp 4 each to bundle out UP for 148 

 Balaji and Zaheer 

Nagpur: Zaheer Khan and Lalshmipathy Balaji claimed four wickets apiece to bundle out Uttar Pradesh for a meagre 148 runs before the Rest of India themselves collapsed to 131 for seven on an eventful opening day of the Irani Trophy match here on Monday. 

As many as 17 wickets perished on Day I of five-day match, as batsmen on both sides had tough time trying to negotiate the slight seam movement that the pitch at the VCA Stadium was offering 

Batting first, a depleted Uttar Pradesh, missing Suresh Raina, Mohammed Kaif, Rudra Pratap Singh and Piyush Chawla, comfortably reached 102 for two fifteen minutes before lunch. But then the tragedy struck. Zaheer (4/46) and Balaji (4/29), trying to make a comeback on the national squad, struck regularly to reduce the Ranji champions to 115 for five at lunch. 

Openers Shivakant Shukla (52) and Praveen Kumar (42) showed some early resilience but batsmen down the order failed to make much impact on a fairly seaming wicket. Murali Kartik chipped in with two for 23. 

Rest of India made a confident start putting 64 for the opening wicket through captain Wasim Jaffer (45) and Gautam Gambhir (20). The exit of Gambhir signalled the collapse of the Rest of India. 

 Robin Uthappa (8), Yalaka Venugopal 

 Rao (0), Dinesh Karthik (11), paid for some rash strokes. 

 Praveen (3/27) and pacer S. Srivastava (3/47) did the damage. 

 Subramaniam Badrinath (35 batting) is holding one end up 

 with patience with his side still requiring 18 runs to overhaul 

 UPs first innings total. (PTI)

 Merykom frustrated by state of boxing 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: MC Merykom has twice been the world champion, but is still not sure about pursuing her career in boxing in the longer run. 

Looking at the state of affairs in boxing, I feel like crying, said the Arjuna Award winner, considered Indias best bet in the World Womens Boxing Championships beginning here from November 18. 

Merykom is worlds top boxer in the 46kg. In 2002, she won the gold in the world meet in Turkey and regained it in 2005 in Moscow. In her four-year career, Merykom has been conferred with both Padma Shri and Arjuna Award. 

Yet, she is somewhat frustrated. I have nothing against the federation as they are trying their best. My complaint is against sponsors, who never come forward to help us out. 

Pointing at the T-shirt she was sporting, Merykom said: Look at the quality of the official T-shirts we are wearing. Will any cricketer or Sania Mirza wear such stuff? They have money and sponsors to back them. We are much higher at the world level, but still no one looks at us. 

She said she would go all out to win her third gold in the New Delhi meet.

 Im no great shooter: Rosicky

 Tomas Rosicky 

Gelsenkirchen: Tomas Rosicky scored twice in the Czech Republics World Cup opener with the US on Monday and then said he was no great goalscorer. With key strikers Jan Koller and Milan Baros both injured, however, midfielder Rosicky may just have to become one. 

The Czechs beat the US 3-0, helped by Rosickys goals, one of them a fine swerving shot from 25 metres. Of course, Im no great shooter... but I tried and today it worked. Three would probably have been too many, he said. 

Coach Karel Brueckner was forced to abandon his usual 4-4-2 formation and play Koller as a lone striker after Baros failed to recover from a foot injury. 

The problems facing the two top strikers will put pressure on midfielders like Rosicky to push forward more in their remaining games against Ghana and Italy. 

The Czechs have a wealth of talent to draw on in midfield, including former European Footballer of the Year Pavel Nedved. I dont need to say anything about Pavel... he is still one of the best players in Europe, said Brueckner. 

The team still features most of the players that reached the Euro 2004 semi-finals but the media has expressed concern that with three-quarters of the midfield over 30 they are past it. 

That view did not hold up against the US and the coach certainly does not agree with the commentators. Our team is not getting old, he said. 

Meanwhile, US coach Bruce Arena said on Tuesday he had no regrets about criticising individual players after the loss. It (the evaluation) was accurate. The reason we lost the game was that their players played better than our players. Individually, they were better and won most of the match-ups on the field. 

Following the loss, Arena uncharacteristically criticised individual players ? especially Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley ? for their performance. 

Arena said he had met the starting team as a group since the game, but had not had too many individual discussions. He said that he had not met with Beasley and did not yield on his public criticism of him. 

 The result is not going to go away, Arena said. We have a day or two to regroup, lick our w ounds a bit and put it past us. Theres still six points out there. (Reuters)

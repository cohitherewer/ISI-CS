Calcutta: India completed their journey from high expectations to despair on Thursday when they bowed out of the AFC Youth Championship with a 0-3 defeat to South Korea at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

After a 2-3 loss to Jordan, Islam Akhmedovs boys needed to script the upset of the tournament to stay alive, but luck which the Uzbek coach had been ruing that they lack was not the solitary component required to overpower the defending champions. It called for determination, gallantry and a bit of magic the traits which have never found expression in the Lalkamal Bhowmicks. 

Young Sung-shim (75), Jin Hyung-song (85) and Young Rok-shin (90+) dashed all hopes for a revival by the home team in the final 15-minute extravaganza of speed, power and precision. 

One might take heart from the fact that India held the formidable rivals to a goalless deadlock till the 75th minute. But the reality is that South Korea never exerted themselves in the beginning. Their offensive ambitions were restricted to attempts from the top-box and on occasions when the defence was breached, Indian keeper Souvik Mondal stood in their way. 

It was India who came up with a statement of positive intent as early as the 10th minute when Raisangmi Vashums right-footed shot following a Lalkamal floater went well over the bar. 

But the best chance for them came on the hour-mark when Branco Cardoso fed Lalkamal, only to see the midfielder squandering the chance from inside the box with a feeble shot. 

With that, the Indian hopes also came to an end as South Korea started showing urgency in the attacking third. They didnt have to wait for long to open the floodgates. In the 75th minute, Sung-shim found the net with a left-footer, meeting perfectly with a cross from right by Chung Young-lee. 

As the Indians looked reconciled to their winless fate, South Korea struck again within 10 minutes. In a three-man move which lasted just 11 seconds, Hyung-song finished it off with a powerful shot from close. 

The third goal was a comedy of errors for the Indians probably a testimony of how far they were reduced to hopelessness. Souvik came out of the top box to clear a long ball from the deep. He miscued it and central defender Rakesh Masih could just watch as Rok-shin rose above him and headed the ball into the open net. 

TEAMS 

South Korea: Su Huk-jo; Choi Chui-soon, Sung Yeung-ki (Jang Hae-park, 19), Jong Jin-park, Dong Suk-kim (Joo Ho-park, 46), Sang Ho-lee, Young Sung-shim, Chung Young-lee, Jin Hyung-song, Young Rok-shin, Seung Jin-bae (Hyun Baem-park, 62). 

India: Souvik Mondal; Rakesh Masih, Raisangmi Vashum, Lalkamal Bhowmick, Thokchom Noaba Singh (Bimal Minj, 89), Sushil Singh, Branco Cardoso, Ong Tshering Lepcha (Zaidinmawla Hmar, 73), Aiborlang Khongjee, Hirohito Elangbam (Baldeep Singh, 57), Poibang Pohshna.

Jordan qualify 

Kyrgyzstan held Jordan to a goalless draw but the result was enough for the former to qualify for the last eight stage. South Korea topped the group with nine points, followed by Jordan on four. 

Jordan didnt show much enthusiasm in attacks and settled into a defensive mould. Kyrgyzstan, on the other hand, raided the rivals box on a few occasions but poor finishing by the forwards cost them dear.

 Surrey grab 28-run lead

London: Surrey were 75 for one in their second essay after Northamptonshire were bowled out for 300 in the Division II County Championship tie on Saturday. Jonathan Batty (35) and Mark Ramprakash (28) were at the crease. 

Usman Afzal remained unbeaten on 136 for Northants while Mohammed Akram and Ian Salisbury claimed three wickets apiece for Surrey. 

Earlier, former India captain Sourav Ganguly once again failed with the bat as he scored only six runs. 

Sourav was the third batsman to fall when the Northants were struggling at 43 for three, replying to Surreys first innings score of 328. 

Meanwhile, Leicestershire were 493 for seven after Dinesh Mongia was out for duck against Glamorgan in another Division II match. (Agencies)

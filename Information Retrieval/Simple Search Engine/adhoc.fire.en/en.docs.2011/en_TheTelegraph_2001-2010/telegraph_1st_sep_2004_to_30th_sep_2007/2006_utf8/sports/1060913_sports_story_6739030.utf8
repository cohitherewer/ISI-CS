The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Sourav can return he should allow his bat to talk 

 - Selectors must be guided by cricket-considerations, nothing else: Borde 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Kuala Lumpur: Sourav Ganguly isnt the only one believing he could make a big league comeback. Former captain Chandu Borde, who was chief selector when he got the captaincy full-time in March 2000, is another. 

Souravs last Test appearance was in Karachi, over seven months ago, while he hasnt played a one-dayer for a year. 

Of course, Sourav can return... Hes experienced and is hungry for a comeback... He shouldnt be sending e-mails, though, and must not give interviews... Instead, he should allow his bat to talk... For a batsman, nothing speaks louder than runs... Borde, here on a private visit, told The Telegraph. 

Asked if he would have kept Sourav out of the ODIs, even after hed recovered from tennis elbow symptoms last October, Borde replied: I would have handled things differently and would have considered his track record... Selectors must be guided by cricket-considerations, nothing else. 

Praising Souravs captaincy, Borde said: He had his way of getting the best out of players... He relied on instincts and, perhaps, was an impulsive captain... Rahul Dravid is different hes methodical, quite like Sunil Gavaskar. 

Borde felt Dravid, appointed captain till the end of the 2007 World Cup, would grow as a leader. He accepts responsibilities and never gives the impression of getting weighed down... His consistency is remarkable... 

However, Borde didnt go to the extent of a Kapil Dev in saluting Dravid as Indias finest-ever (largely on account of delivering under pressure). 

Weve had the Vijay Hazares and the Gavaskars... More recently, Sachin Tendulkar... Its difficult making a comparison as laws have changed, the support staff has mushroomed and so much protective gear is used... Im not naming any one batsman over the others, but this could be a fascinating debate, Borde pointed out, smiling. 

Incidentally, in Bordes opinion, Polly Umrigar probably had the sharpest mind among Indian captains. He read players and situations very well... Perhaps, thats something for another debate.

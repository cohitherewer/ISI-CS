The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 QUICK TAKES

 Beckenbauer 

 interested in Uefa, not Fifa 

 Berlin: The chief organiser 

 of the World Cup, Franz Beckenbauer, said on Thursday that 

 he was not keen on becoming Fifa chief but said he would 

 be interested in taking over the Uefa presidency. The current 

 Fifa president Sepp Blatter said in an interview to a German 

 newspaper that Beckenbauer does not want to and cannot 

 be Fifa president. He is right in principle, 

 Beckenbauer said. I do not have time in my schedule 

 to do that job and the need to be multi-lingual is also 

 a problem. I speak German and a bit of Bavarian and my English 

 needs to be vastly improved, so I leave this job to a talented 

 person like Blatter.

 Barge hits giant screen 

 Frankfurt: A giant screen set up in the middle 

 of Frankfurts Main river to show World Cup matches 

 has been slightly damaged after it was hit by a barge. Police 

 said the screen was grazed at about 1 am local time on Thursday 

 by a 170m convoy of vessels loaded with brewery vats. Tens 

 of thousands of spectators have gathered regularly on the 

 banks of the Main to watch World Cup matches on the screen, 

 which is moored to the river bottom.

 Semi-final bookmark 

 London: Sven-Goran Erikssons hopes of 

 getting close to the ?2 million he wants from publishers 

 for a book on his eventful England reign depend on the team 

 reaching the semi-finals of the World Cup on Saturday. Erikssons 

 advisers have seen all the leading English publishers and 

 made them aware of the ?2 million initial asking price, 

 but the publishers are waiting to see how the team fares 

 against Portugal before considering making offers anywhere 

 close to that sum.

 Poland coach resigns 

 Warsaw: Polish coach Pawel Janas has resigned 

 rather than wait for an official decision on his future 

 in two weeks, senior football association (PZPN) official 

 and member of parliament Ryszard Czarnecki said on Thursday. 

 I spoke to Janas on Wednesday. The decision has been 

 taken. He will not be the coach any more, Czarnecki, 

 head of the associations international division told 

 public television. 

 Ghana coach to quit 

 Belgrade: Ghana coach Ratomir Dukovic said 

 he would resign following his teams exit from the 

 World Cup, a Serbian newspaper reported on Thursday. Of 

 course, Ill return to Ghana. They want to continue, 

 the Serbian coach was quoted as saying. But I think 

 it was enough. I should move on, there are new challenges 

 awaiting. 

 Kingson feat 

 Berlin: The Black Stars World 

 Cup dream may be over, but at the conclusion of second round, 

 Ghana keeper Richard Kingson leads the list of top 

 goal-savers. Kingson has made 22 saves in four matches, 

 followed by Joao Ricardo of Angola and Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi 

 of Japan, with 21 saves each in three games.

 Henry a Brazil fan 

 Frankfurt: France striker Thierry Henry is 

 a self-confessed fan of Brazil. You just have to look 

 at those five stars on their shirt to understand that football 

 is part of their identity Henry said on Thursday. 

 In Brazil theyre born with a ball. On the beach, 

 on the street, at school, everywhere you look, theyre 

 playing football. 

 Tostaos criticism 

 Bergisch Gladbach: Its been 36 years 

 since Tostao stood alongside Pele at the World Cup, helping 

 Brazil win their third World Cup title. Tostao has been 

 watching Brazil closely this year. Brazil have had 

 a few individually beautiful moments. But as a team they 

 havent yet played beautiful soccer. They can do a 

 lot better, Tostao said. But (coach Carlos Alberto) 

 Parreira could do things differently. He doesnt manage 

 to get the best out of the players. 

 Fan deserts 

 family 

 Beijing: A fan in Beijing refused to let the 

 small matter of his house burning down disturb his enjoyment 

 of Tuesdays World Cup match between France and Spain. 

 A fire broke out in a Hutong in the centre of the Chinese 

 capital at 3am local time on Wednesday. When the neighbours 

 shouted fire!, I took my little baby and ran 

 out in my nightclothes, the mans wife said. 

 My husband just grabbed the TV and put it under his 

 arm. After getting out of the house, he then set about finding 

 an electric socket to plug in and continue watching his 

 game.

 World Cup air 

 on sale 

 Beijing: A Chinese company which promised 

 plots of land on the moon has come up with a more earthly 

 plan ? World Cup air for sale. Li Jie, the CEO 

 of the former Lunar embassy in China, whose 

 licence was revoked for selling plots of land on the moon, 

 has gathered air from German stadia hosting 

 World Cup matches for sale in China.

 Cup for free 

 Hong Kong: An estimated 40,000 households 

 in Hong Kong have been watching the Cup through illegal 

 Internet broadcasts without paying a cent, a report said 

 Thursday. 

 Long arm of religion

 Berlin: World Cup football is also a good 

 time for religious organisations. Keeping in view the immense 

 interest among the people in the Middle East, a Christian 

 satellite network is broadcasting a series of programmes 

 about male and female Christian sports heroes.

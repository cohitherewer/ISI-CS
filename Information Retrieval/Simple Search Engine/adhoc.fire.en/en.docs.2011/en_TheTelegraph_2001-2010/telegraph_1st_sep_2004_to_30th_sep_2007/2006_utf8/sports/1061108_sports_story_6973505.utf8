 Woods has new designs

 - World No. 1 plans courses 

 Tiger Woods 

New York: The worlds No. 1 golfer, Tiger Woods, is taking aim at a new business designing golf courses. 

Woods, who has won the US Masters, the US and British Opens, said in a statement on Monday that he was forming a new company to design golf courses. 

There are golfers everywhere who may never get a chance to play a links course in Scotland, a tree-lined course in America or the sand belts of Australia. Hopefully I can bring some of those elements into their backyards, said Woods. 

Ive been working very hard over the last decade to get a feel for all kinds of courses and really understand the best elements of design. 

Woods, 30, will be the chairman of Tiger Woods Design, based in Windermere, Florida. The new company is planning projects around the world although it gave no details on where the courses would be located. 

Woods, who has played golf in more than 20 countries, said his courses would take into account all skill levels. 

He said he decided to push ahead with forming Tiger Woods Design in 2005 as he approached his 10th year of playing professional golf and after seeking the advice of friends and experts in the industry like former champion golfer Jack Nicklaus and golf course designer Tom Fazio. 

Nicklaus, an 18-time major champion, has designed 250 courses that are open for play worldwide, according to his company. (Agencies)

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 10-man Mahindra down Air India

 National League

 Mumbai: Mahindra United, 

 assured of their maiden National Football League (NFL) crown, 

 were undeterred despite being reduced to 10 players and 

 outsmarted Air India 2-0 in their NFL tie at the Cooperage 

 Ground here on Tuesday.

 Mahindra, who booked the title 

 on Monday itself following East Bengals defeat against 

 Sporting Club de Goa, were without the services of their 

 custodian Subasish Roy Chowdhury for the entire second half.

 The Jeepmen scored once in each 

 half through Surajit Bose (15th minute) and captain Shanmugam 

 Venkatesh (69th), later declared the Man of the Match.

 Surajit took control of a chip 

 into the box by Yusif Yakubu to beat Air India custodian 

 Raju Ekka and put Mahindra 1-0 up.

 Venkatesh then slotted home an 

 angular shot from the right following another lofted pass 

 into the box at his feet by substitute Steven Diase.

 Mahindra goalkeeper Subhasish 

 was sent off after his second booking in the match by referee 

 S. Suresh for handling the ball outside the penalty area.

 The victory boosted Mahindras 

 points tally to 35 with two ties in hand while Air India 

 remain on 15 points after as many matches.

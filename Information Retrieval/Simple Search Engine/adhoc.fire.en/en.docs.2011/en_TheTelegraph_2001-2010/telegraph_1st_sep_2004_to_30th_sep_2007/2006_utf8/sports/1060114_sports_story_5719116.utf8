 Justine battles to lift crown

 - Sydney meet 

Sydney: Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne twice clawed herself back from the brink of defeat to beat Italys Francesca Schiavone 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 in the final of the Sydney International on Friday. 

Schiavone looked to be on her way to her first WTA Tour title when she led 6-4, 4-1 in the second set then again when she served for the match at 5-3 in the third. 

But the former world No. 1 drew on all her big-match experience to fight back on both occasions, raising her game as the errors started to creep into Schiavones game. 

The Italian was a point away from grabbing a 5-1 lead in the second set. However, Henin-Hardenne regained her composure, holding serve for 2-4 then reeling off five of the next six games to square the match. 

Schiavone jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the deciding set and although the fifth seed pulled back to 3-3, she broke again to serve for the match at 5-3. 

Henin-Hardenne broke when Schiavone double-faulted then unleashed a ferocious return forehand down the line to lead 6-5. 

There was more drama in the final game when a sudden shower forced the players to scurry from the court with Henin-Hardenne three points from victory. 

But they returned once the rain passed, with Henin-Hardenne hitting a winning forehand to seal victory after three hours to remain unbeaten in Australia for three years. 

Their clash overshadowed two upsets in the mens semi-finals as American James Blake and Russias Igor Andreev booked their place in Saturdays final. 

Blake upset Russian second seed Nikolay Davydenko 6-4, 6-2 while Andreev ousted Italian qualifier Andreas Seppi 6-2, 2-6, 6-2. 

The unseeded Russian was leading 6-2, 2-5 before rain delayed the match for more than three hours.

 Ronaldo: I need the surgery 

 - I wont be out for very long 

 Ronaldo

 Madrid: Ronaldo said on 

 Friday he agreed with Brazils team doctor that he 

 needed a minor knee operation. 

 Jose Luiz Runco said Ronaldo was suffering from tibial 

 calcification and that surgery was needed to remove the 

 calcium. On Thursday the strikers club, Real Madrid, 

 denied Ronaldo was to go under the knife. 

It is better that they operate on the calcifications thereby removing the problems they have caused me over the past eight months, Ronaldo said in his column with a Spanish daily on Friday. 

I will travel to Brazil shortly to see if I will finally have surgery to sort out this minor problem. 

I wont be out for very long because it is not a serious operation and I think the benefits will be greater than if they dont operate. 

Either way I will be ready to start the season with Real. 

Real said on their website on Thursday: Ronaldo returned from the World Cup with pain in his left knee that obliged him to be examined by Reals doctors. The player has now been told to rest to preserve the tendon in his right knee. 

The Madrid doctors have made contact with Runco to analyse the tests done in Madrid and find out about the state of the knees. For the moment surgery has been ruled out. 

Ronaldo is holidaying in Europe with his family after Brazil were knocked out by France in the World Cup quarter finals. 

 Reals next game is a friendly against Real-Salt 

 Lake in the United States on August 12.

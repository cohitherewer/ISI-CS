 Captain, coach duck queries on Sourav

Bangalore: The Indian team management on Thursday evaded persistent questions on former captain Sourav Gangulys inclusion in the list of 30 probables for the Champions Trophy. 

Captain Rahul Dravid, coach Greg Chappell and selector Sanjay Jagdale (manager) refused to answer any query relating to Sourav saying the chairman of selectors Kiran More had already talked about the issue on Wednesday. 

Yesterday, the chairman of selectors had addressed the issue and you (Media) had your chance. We are going on the Sri Lanka tour and discussing that, Dravid said. Chappell also gave a similar reply to another question on Sourav, saying: Theres no issue in that. We are now focussed on Sri Lanka tour. Jagdale also maintained that he was not interested to field questions in that regard. You should have asked the chairman. I dont want to answer that, he said. (PTI)

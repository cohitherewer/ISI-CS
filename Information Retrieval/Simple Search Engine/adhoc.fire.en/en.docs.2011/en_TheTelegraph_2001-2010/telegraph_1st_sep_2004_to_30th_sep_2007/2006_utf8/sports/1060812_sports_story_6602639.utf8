The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Barreto to focus on NFL

A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Jose Ramirez Barreto is hoping his second association with Bhaichung Bhutia will click and the two will help Mohun Bagan win many trophies. 

When I played with Bhaichung (for Mohun Bagan in 2002-03), he was not fully fit. Im looking forward to a more fruitful association this season, said Barreto, who will lead Mohun Bagan. Im yet to gain match fitness. Let me see how the coach wants me to play in the league, but my focus will be on the NFL. 

Barreto, who landed in the city on Thursday, briefly attended Fridays practice session. Coach Biswajit Bhattacharya said Barreto needs at least 10 days to come to proper shape. 

 Suresh signs for EB 

Meanwhile, M. Suresh signed for East Bengal on Friday. I was not getting chances under Philippe de Ridder (last season) and thats why decided to play for Mohammedan Sporting. But Im a contracted player for East Bengal and I deeply regret the various comments I made against the club recently, Suresh said.

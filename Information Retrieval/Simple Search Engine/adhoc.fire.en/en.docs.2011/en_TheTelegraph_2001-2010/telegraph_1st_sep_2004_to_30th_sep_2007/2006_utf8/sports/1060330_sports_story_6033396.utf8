 Dravid: Doors not closed on Sourav

New Delhi: Rahul Dravid said on Wednesday that the doors had not been shut on Sourav Gangulys return to the national side. 

We are not writing off anyone. Irrespective of whether it is a Ganguly or a Kumble, nobody is written off, Dravid said in a TV interview. 

Anyone could be in the team if you are playing domestic cricket and if you are doing well, as long as the-re is a place for you in the team. 

If the people in the team are doing really well, then it becomes very difficult, irrespective of who you are.

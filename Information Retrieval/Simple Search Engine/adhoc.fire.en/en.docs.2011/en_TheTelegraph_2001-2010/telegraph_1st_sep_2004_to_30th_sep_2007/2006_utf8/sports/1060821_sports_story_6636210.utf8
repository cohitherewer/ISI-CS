 Chopra elected as DSA chief 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi: One more career politician entered the administrative arena of Indian football on Sunday when former Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president and MLA Subhas Chopra was elected the president of the Delhi Soccer Association (DSA). 

After hectic politicking for the past few days, Chopra was elected to the post unanimously, courtesy instructions from the AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

We decided to withdraw ourselves from the fray after Das Munshi told us last evening that he wanted Chopra to be at the helm of the affairs in Delhi, said former DSA president Umesh Sood, who looked a frontrunner for the top job till Saturday. 

After Das Munshi became AIFF president in December, 1988, a number of politicians had entered the federation through different state associations. At the moment, WIFA is being headed by Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel and the Uttar Pradesh body is headed by Sanjay Singh. The two are also vice-presidents of the AIFF.

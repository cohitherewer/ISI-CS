 Hoggard checks Australia

 - Ponting registers 33rd Test hundred to go past Waugh 

 Matthew Hoggard in action on Sunday 

Adelaide: Matthew Hoggard took four wickets in two devastating spells to reduce Australia to 312 for five in their first innings and put England in control of the second Ashes Test after three days at the Adelaide Oval on Sunday. 

Hoggard dismissed Matthew Hayden and Damien Martyn before lunch to leave Australia teetering at 65 for three, then claimed the crucial scalps of Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey in the last hour before stumps after they had launched a fight back. 

Ponting followed up his 196 and 60 not out from the first Test in Brisbane with 142 to register his 33rd Test hundred and pass Steve Waugh as Australias most prolific centurion. 

Hussey made a watchful 91 to continue his remarkable start to his Test career. 

The pair shared a 192-run partnership for the fourth-wicket but departed in quick succession to leave Michael Clarke (30 not out) and Adam Gilchrist (13 not out) to carry through to stumps with Australia 239 behind Englands daunting total of 551/6 declared and needing another 40 to avoid the follow-on. 

The tourists, who have improved dramatically since they were crushed by 277 runs last week, might have been in an even better position had they not missed two early chances to dismiss Ponting. 

He was dropped on 35 by a leaping Ashley Giles at deep square leg then survived a suicidal run on 46 when Paul Collingwood missed with a shy at the stumps and he made them pay dearly for their misses. 

The 31-year-old grew in confidence after his two close shaves, pulling James Anderson for four in the last over before lunch to reach his half-century then recorded his hundred just before tea, off 183 balls in 266 minutes, scampering through for a single off Andrew Flintoff. 

Pontings century was his seventh in 2006 and his 10th from his last 13 Tests and lifted him into outright fourth on the all-time list of century makers behind Sachin Tendulkar (35) and Brian Lara (34) and Sunil Gavaskar (34). 

He faced 245 balls over 353 minutes and struck 12 boundaries before nicking Hoggard behind to wicketkeeper Geraint Jones when England took the second new ball late in the day.

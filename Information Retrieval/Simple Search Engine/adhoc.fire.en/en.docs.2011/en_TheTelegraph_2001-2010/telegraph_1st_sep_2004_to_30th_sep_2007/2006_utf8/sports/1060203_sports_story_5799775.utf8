 Faisal recalled in ODI squad

 - Kaneria, Sami get the boot 

 Faisal Iqbal has played 17 ODIs so far 

Karachi: Pakistan selectors on Thursday dropped bowlers Danish Kaneria and Mohammed Sami while rewarding third Test centurion Faisal Iqbal with a berth in the 16-member squad for the first three one-day games against India. 

Besides Faisal, the selectors also recalled allrounders Shoaib Malik and Yasir Arafat in the squad to be led by the fit-again Inzamam-ul Haq. 

[That Inzamam was fit for the ODI series was reported by The Telegraph on Wednesday.] 

Malik missed the third Test because of the demise of his father during the second Test while Arafat was a member of the Pakistan team that beat England 3-2 at home late last year. 

The axe fell on leg-spinner Kaneria, who managed just five wickets in three Tests, and Sami who failed to get any wicket in the only game he played in Lahore. 

Faisal, 24, played his 17th and last one-day International 26 months ago against South Africa in Rawalpindi. In 17 games, he has scored 284 runs at little under 22. 

I am thankful to the selectors for keeping faith in my abilities. I will try to justify my recall and cement my place in the one-day squad if provided with an opportunity. Having said this, it is a matter of great honour for me to remain part of a star-studded squad, said Faisal, nephew of Javed Miandad. 

Faisal, who scored a career-best 139 in Pakistans series-winning 341-run victory, might not be the first choice batsman with Inzamam back in reckoning. 

Inzamam said he had recovered from the back injury which forced him to miss the Karachi Test. 

The recovery progress from the back injury has been excellent and I am looking forward to playing in the one-day series, Inzamam said. 

Obviously, it was difficult to watch the third Test from the dressing room but i am glad that we won the game and that is all what matters and counts. I look forward to maintain that pattern in the one-day series, he said. 

The Multan batsman said his side would take these one-day matches as a build-up for 2007 World Cup. 

The one-day matches we play this year will be our build-up for next years World Cup. We will try as many promising players as we can and experiment with different combinations so that when the squad for the prestigious event is finalised, we have a 360-degree view of the resources we have. 

THE SQUAD 

Inzamam-ul Haq (captain), Younis Khan (vice-captain), Salman Butt, Shoaib Malik, Imran Farhat, Mohammad Yousuf, Faisal Iqbal, Kamran Akmal, Shahid Afridi, Abdul Razzaq, Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Asif, Rana Naved-ul Hasan, Yasir Arafat, Umar Gul, Arshad Khan. 

Inzy to be selective 

Meanwhile, Inzamam will only make himself available for future matches on a selective basis because of the back problem. 

It is not a career threatening problem but it does become a nuisance if not taken proper care off, he said. In future, I will try to sit out on matches where possible. 

I plan to sit out Test matches where nothing much is at stake and where I can take a rest in order to preserve myself for the more important games, he added.

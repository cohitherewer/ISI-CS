 Laxman eyes Test route to Cup spot

 - Im always under pressure to deliver 

 Laxman 

Mumbai: V.V.S. Laxman says his omission from the one-day side touring the West Indies has motivated him to excel in the Test series and force his way into contention for next years World Cup in the Caribbean. 

Playing in a World Cup is one of my dreams, he said before leaving for the four-Test series starting on June 2. 

The 31-year-old is making his third trip to the Caribbean. 

Since missing the 2003 edition Ive been aiming to play in 2007, he said. 

It has gone a little off track, but I believe if I get big runs there (in the Caribbean), I will surely get opportunities in one-day cricket. 

His last one-day International appearance came in August 2005. 

Laxman is confident of his form ahead of the West Indies tour . The last time it was a different experience, he said. Most of the time, I was not out as the tail used to just succumb. 

Im assuming it will be number four, if (captain) Rahul Dravid is to bat at three. Again it depends on (coach) Greg Chappell and Rahul and what they are thinking. 

I am hoping Ill get some good opportunities, get some big hundreds. 

Ive been under scrutiny and under pressure to deliver always. I have learnt to enjoy it. If I think I have been unfairly treated and they are putting additional pressure on me, then I will not enjoy the game. (Reuters)

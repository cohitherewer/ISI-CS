 Zaheer Khan to play for Worcester

Mumbai: Indian left-arm seamer Zaheer Khan will play for Worcestershire this season as a replacement for Australian paceman Nathan Bracken. 

Zaheer, 27, dropped from the Indian team after the recent Pakistan tour, will step in for Bracken, who has earned a regular place in the national squad, the county said on Monday. 

Im delighted to be playing a full season, Zaheer said. 

Seniors in the team have been advising me to play county cricket. It will help me develop as a bowler and stay match-fit. 

Zaheer has played 42 Tests and 107 ODIs.

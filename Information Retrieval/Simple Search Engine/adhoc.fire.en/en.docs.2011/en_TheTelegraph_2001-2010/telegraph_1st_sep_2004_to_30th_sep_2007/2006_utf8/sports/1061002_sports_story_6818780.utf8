 Bhupathi may retire hurt from India duties

 - No motivation for doubles ace after Paes no to reuniting next year 

AMITAVA DAS GUPTA

 Mahesh Bhupathi 

Mumbai: Mahesh Bhupathi is contemplating retirement from national duties with immediate effect. 

Indias most successful Grand Slammer dropped the bombshell during a chat with The Telegraph on Sunday afternoon. Yes, I am thinking of quitting playing for India Ill take a few more days before making an official announcement, an emotional Bhupathi said. 

But why this sudden change of heart after saying 12 days ago that he would like to give another shot at an Olympic medal with Leander Paes in 2008? Has it got anything to do with the AITA decision of pairing Paes and Sania Mirza for the Doha Asian Games? 

No, its not that. Id most probably have played mixed with Shikha (Uberoi) in Doha and wed have stood a good chance of winning, Bhupathi said. 

The real reason was Paes polite refusal to pair up with him in the next season or two. I had the motivation to play for India till the Beijing Olympics. But to have a realistic chance of winning a medal, we have to play together regularly, otherwise theres not much chance of beating the Bryan brothers and other good pairs. 

Bhupathi said he had brought up the issue of reuniting with his old partner. I did discuss playing 2007 and 2008 together with Leander, but he said hed go with Martin (Damm), Bhupathi revealed. 

While Bhupathi hasnt had a steady partner since splitting in May with Wesley Moodie and is now getting ready for another year of mix-and-match, Paes has said he doesnt want to disturb a winning combination with the Czech. Paes and Damm had some terrific results in this years Grand Slam events, reaching the Australian Open final, Wimbledon semis and winning the US Open last month. 

Bhupathi spelt out some other factors as well to justify his thought process. For just one doubles rubber, Ive been travelling a lot the last two-three years to play zonal Davis Cup ties. We played in cold Korean conditions and caught a viral which kept me out for two weeks. Next year God knows where wed have to play in Uzbekistan. 

I dont have many years left in the game, I want to stay fit and healthy, remarked the man with 10 Grand Slam titles (four in mens doubles and six in mixed) in his kitty. In any case, I think Rohan (Bopanna) and Prakash (Amritraj) can team up with Leander against zonal opposition. 

Bopannas doubles ranking, he pointed out, would shoot up to about 120 after the great run he had this week with Mustafa Ghouse. Prakash is also quite good in doubles and with Leander there, they are capable of giving India the doubles point at least against the Asian teams, Bhupathi argued. 

If I have to without an Olympic medal, so be it, he signed off on a melancholy note.

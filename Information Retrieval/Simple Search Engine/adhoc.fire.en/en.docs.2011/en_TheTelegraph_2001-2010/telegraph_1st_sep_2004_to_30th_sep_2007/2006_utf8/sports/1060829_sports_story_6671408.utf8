 Lightning causes death

Copenhagen: A 17-year-old soccer player hit 

 by lightning during an amateur game has died, police said. 

 The victim, whose name was yet to be released, died 

 early on Monday. 

Lightning hit the teenager while he was playing for Ulfborg against Maabjerg at a tournament in north western Denmark on Saturday. Nine other players were knocked over. 

There were no clouds in the sky. Only a black cloud far away, Maabjerg goalie Kasper Stoettrup told a daily. Suddenly he was just hit. Out of nothing. 

Paramedics revived the teenager who had severe burns and rushed him to the hospital with four other players. They have since been discharged. 

 The lightning struck 10 minutes before the final whistle, and the game was cancelled. 

The game was played in Ulfborg, 330 kilometers (205 miles) northwest of Copenhagen. 

 Several matches in Denmarks top SAS League tournament 

 were cancelled or stopped at the weekend because of heavy 

 rain and thunder.

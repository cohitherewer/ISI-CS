 CLOSE SHAVES IN TEST HISTORY

This was the 15th occasion when a Test had ended in a draw with just a wicket to fall in the fourth innings. The Indians have now been denied by the last-wicket pair twice, the first time being in the Calcutta Test of the 1978-79 series when Sew Shivnarine and Sylvester Clarke saved the game. Fidel Edwards became the only cricketer to be involved in last-wicket draws twice, the first time being in the 2003-04 Harare Test when he helped Ridley Jacobs save the game.

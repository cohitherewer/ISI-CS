 25-man Yemen arrive

 ASIAN CUP QUALIFIER

 New Delhi: A 25-member 

 Yemen team reached here on Sunday night to take on India 

 in the second qualifier for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup Football 

 Championship.

 There are nine officials accompanying 

 the side which would aim to bounce back after the 0-4 home 

 defeat against Saudi Arabia in their opening qualifying 

 encounter.

 India were also torn to pieces 

 0-6 by defending champions Japan in their first match. 

 They are already practising here 

 and have called in reinforcements including Salgaocar midfielder 

 Micky Fernandes and Mahindra Uniteds Surojit Bose.

 Rajat Ghosh Dastidar, S. Venkatesh 

 and M. Suresh, who did not play against Japan in Yokohama, 

 are also expected to be available for selection.

 The two top teams from each group 

 will make it to the Asian Cup to be held next year in Thailand, 

 Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam.

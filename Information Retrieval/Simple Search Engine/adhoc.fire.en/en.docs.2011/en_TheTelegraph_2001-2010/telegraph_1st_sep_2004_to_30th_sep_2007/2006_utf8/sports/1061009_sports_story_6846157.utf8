New Delhi: On Sunday, when Australia, England and South African cricketers came out in the open to give a few hints about their plans for the Champions Trophy, the Aussie skipper, Ricky Ponting, made no secret of the fact that his first priority is to beat arch rivals England at Jaipur. 

I have a statement to make on October 21, announced the Australian captain. Champions Trophy is very important to us since we havent won it earlier. Before that we need to beat England. 

Though England and South African cricketers didnt flex their muscles in the same manner, they didnt lag behind either. While England players said a new script would be written in the tournament, the South Africans were sure they would remain true to their tag of favourites. 

The mental game has begun in the right earnest. 

 AUSTRALIA 

 John Buchanan: It is wrong to say we are only going to focus on the Ashes. The Champions Trophy is equally important to us and we have come here to win it. We are the number one team in the world, but rankings dont always matter. We have to play good cricket to win it. McGrath has been making very good progress and with Lee around, Australia will win the trophy. 

 Brett Lee: We had a long season and really good efforts are needed to perform well here. We are not here to prepare for the Ashes. Our goal is to win the Champions Trophy, which we are perfectly capable of. This is also not a preparation for the World Cup as that we will come much later. Conditions are different in India, but we will adjust to it soon and get going. 

 Ricky Ponting: I have a statement to make on October 21 when we play England. We may have lost the Ashes, but have played quality cricket throughout the year thereafter. The Champions Trophy is very important to us. After all, this is the sole silverware that we lack. Things are certainly going to change this time and the trophy will be ours. 

 ENGLAND 

 Paul Collingwood: We are looking forward to win the trophy. England are very good at chasing and all we need to do is to analyse the situation properly. We have more strength in batting than just Pietersen. A bunch of good youngsters have arrived. Personally speaking, I need to become more consistent. 

 Kevin Pietersen: Dont underestimate us as we are a highly capable one-day side. In the series against Pakistan, we proved that by coming back from a 0-2 deficit. In one-day cricket, the key is to knuckle down the opposition, which we are perfectly capable of. We have a young side, which can go about and do something. Most important is the two massive matches against India and Australia. 

 Andrew Strauss: All we got to do in the first two matches is to have the right start. Once we see through the first few overs and get some runs on the board, we have the ability to beat any team. Yes, we do miss Trescothick, but he has come a long way down. He will be fine for the Ashes. I have enjoyed myself as a skipper as I received great support from my senior colleagues in the team. 

 SOUTH AFRICA 

 Makhaya Ntini: That I open the bowling for South Africa and bagged the best players award five times, speaks volumes about my talent. I run very fast because when I was a kid, I used to chase the horses. I do bowl fast, but I am also very accurate and that will be the key to success in the Champions Trophy. I dont want to bowl slow deliveries. My best weapon, of course, will be the yorkers. 

 Shaun Pollock: We should win the Champions Trophy again. To win it, we should take the game to the opposition camp. We need to be more flexible in our approach. Our team is quite experienced as most of our boys have played nearly 100 games each. We know cricket in the sub-continent is high scoring than on pitches in Australia or England. Playing on the home turf will certainly help India, but we, too, can do it. 

 Graeme Smith: At the moment, we are trying to get used to the weather. Captaining the team certainly puts some added pressure, as it needs one to be a lot more responsible. We have a great batting line up and should win the trophy. South Africa have no definite game plan. It will vary from match to match. I know it is difficult to play in Indian conditions, but if we can beat Australia, then we can win here as well. For the spectators, we want to play great cricket.

 Moscow: New Russia coach Guus Hiddink got his first taste of the job by making a whistle-stop tour of the capital this week. The Dutchman began his two-and-a-half year stint as Russia?s first foreign manager by visiting the Russian FA headquarters and meeting fellow coaches, the national team?s staff and officials.

 Accompanied by his wife Elizabeth, Hiddink also toured famous Moscow landmarks such as the Kremlin and Red Square. 

 Everywhere he went, Hiddink was followed by a horde of reporters, photo and television cameras. ?Moscow is a great city, the only problem seems to be these huge traffic jams. It?s just a nightmare,? he said.

 ?Although no misconduct by the manager, David O?Leary, was uncovered, as a result of the investigation it has been agreed that an amicable parting of the ways was in the best interests of all parties,? Villa said in a statement.

 O?Leary?s contract has been terminated with immediate effect.

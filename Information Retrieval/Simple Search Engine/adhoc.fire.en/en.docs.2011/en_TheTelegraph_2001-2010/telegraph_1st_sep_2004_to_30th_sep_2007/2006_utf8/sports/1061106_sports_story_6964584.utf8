 Jeev misses title by a shot 

 - JAPAN GOLF 

 - Injured wrist costs Indian dear 

Fukuoka: An injured wrist brought misfortune for Jeev Milkha Singh as the Indian golfer fell short by a shot to miss out on the title at the Asahiryokuken Yomiuri Memorial golf tournament. 

Tatsu ichihara, five shots behind Jeev after three rounds, turned in a sensational comeback on the final day to card a five-under 67 while the Indian, after spoiling three putts on the final hole, managed only a one-over 73 to finish second. 

This is Jeevs best on the Japanese Tour this season and the third runner-up finish in the year. 

Ichihara picked up his first title on Japan Tour. His previous best finish was tied second at the Mizuno Open earlier this year. 

Toru Suzuki (67) was third and Hiroyuki Fujita (69) and Ike Je Chang (70) were tied fourth. 

Jeev, who had 32 putts on the final day, was in line for an unique achievement to win back-to-back tournaments in two consecutive weeks. It would then have been his third title on a third different tour after Asian and European tours. It nevertheless meant a tenth top-10 finish in 15 starts and it moves Jeev to the 12th place in Japan Tour money rankings. 

Jeev needed a par to get into a play-off as both Ichihara and Jeev had birdies on the 15th which tied them at 17-under. Ichihara had finished one flight ahead of Jeev and was waiting in the clubhouse as the Indian, who had at least a share of the lead for all of first three days, came towards the finish. 

I am a bit disappointed, said Jeev after the finish. But for that three-putt on the final hole, it has been a great fortnight after the win in Valderrama and then here for the first three days. 

Jeev, who has been affected by a niggling wrist injury, which has often affected his putting last few weeks seemed to have been hit by it at the wrong time. 

The wrist has been bothering me for a while and it did again. After the next couple of weeks for which I am committed, I will take some time off to allow it to recuperate, said the 77th ranked Indian, who should come closer to his goal of making it to the top-50 of the world. (PTI)

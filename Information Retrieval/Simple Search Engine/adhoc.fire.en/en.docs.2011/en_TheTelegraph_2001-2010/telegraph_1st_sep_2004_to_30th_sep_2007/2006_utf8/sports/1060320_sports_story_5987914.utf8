Calcutta: Football took a nosedive from the sublime to the ridiculous in a day. If the East Bengal-Sporting Clude de Goa match had all the ingredients which elevated the game to a surreal level, Sundays clash between Mohammedan Sporting and Fransa plunged itself into the ugly pit of reality. 

Their Round VIII engagement ended in a painful, pathetic and pointless goalless draw at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

But both teams should be happy as both stood to gain something from the verdict. For Mohammedan Sporting, the draw meant an end to their three-match losing streak, while for Fransa, it was an important point gained in an away outing, as they were out to survive the National Football League match for the ONGC Cup. 

Apart from a few good moves, the match hardly had anything to offer. Mohammedan Sportings three foreigners ? Patrick Okonji, Gley Yao Rodrigue and David Mkandwire ? were all off colour throughout, and hence the scoresheet remained blank during the painful 90-minute affair. 

Only on a handful of occasions did Fransa forwards make their presence felt, giving the black-and-white brigade goalie Gopal Das a chance to exercise his limbs. Otherwise, if one goes by the standard of the game, any second division outfit of the Calcutta Football League would have perhaps posed a stiffer competition to the Goan team in terms of soccer skills. 

Mohammedan Sporting, playing with four men up-front, looked clueless as their midfielders failed to feed the frontliners with adequate amount of passes. 

Fransas Mohammed Nizam got a loose ball inside the box quite early in the sixth minute, but squandered the chance when his feeble right footer hit the advertising boards instead of the nets. 

Among Mohammedan Sportings three Africans, Patrick was the best of the lot, though he wasted a number of moves in his bid to hold the ball longer than necessary. David and Rodrigue were only shadows of themselves despite coach Mohammed Habibs yelling from the touchline. 

Mohammedan Sporting looked to go one-up eight minutes from time, when a Karmakar cross was headed properly (for the first time in the match) by substitute Raman Vijayan, but a brilliant fist from Fransa custodian Virender Singh helped his team squeeze a point.

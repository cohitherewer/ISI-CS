The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 CAB president, Sourav keep it business-like 

- Dalmiya pep-talk to players 

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: The warmth wasnt missing, but both Jagmohan Dalmiya and Sourav Ganguly chose to keep it business-like. The occasion was the CAB presidents pep-talk to the Bengal team which open its Ranji campaign against Punjab in Mohali from Thursday. 

This was the duos first public meeting in over three months after the bitterness generated between them in the lead-up to the CAB elections in July. On entering the conference hall of the Dr B.C. Roy Club House at the Eden, Dalmiya asked the Bengal captain who was seated a couple of chairs away to sit next to him. 

Dalmiya told the former Team India captain that the national selectors would be forced to recall him. Sourav also spoke for a brief while, reminding the players of their responsibilities. 

Later, Sourav said, he (Dalmiya) wished us the best. 

Dalmiya remarked: I told the players that they have it in them to improve on last seasons performance (runners-up). Im confident theyll do well, as I have faith in the boys. Some of them are in good nick, if their performance in Duleep Trophy is any indication. They should fight till the last ball. 

Dalmiya rounded off the 20-minute session by telling the players: If you feel there is any administrative failing, dont hesitate to come back to me.

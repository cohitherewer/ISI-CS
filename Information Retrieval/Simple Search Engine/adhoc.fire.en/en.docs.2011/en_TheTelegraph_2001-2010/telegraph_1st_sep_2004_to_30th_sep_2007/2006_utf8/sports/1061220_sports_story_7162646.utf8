 Sreesanth: It just cant get better

 - I dedicate my MoM award to all Indians whod felt let down in ODIs 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

Johannesburg: Despite pocketing the MoM award on Monday, Sreesanth wasnt feeling too good. That hed been disciplined by Match Referee Roshan Mahanama was one big reason, the other being a mild stomach upset. 

On the morning after, however, Keralas newest icon was upbeat. 

Its such a great feeling... The first Test win in South Africa and Im the MoM... It just cant get better, Sreesanth, who took eight for 99 in only his sixth Test, told The Telegraph. 

Utterly devoted to his parents (V.S.Nair and T.N.Savitri Devi), hed already spoken to them twice since the Test ended. Their blessings have played a big part as also the good wishes of so many... I dedicate my award to all Indians whod felt let down in the ODIs, but have much to cheer now... 

Asked whether expectations could weigh him down, Sreesanth replied: I dont think so... I see the MoM award as something thats going to motivate me... Im not thinking negatively... 

The positive trait came through when he insisted that being in and out of Team India for the past few months had actually been of help. I wasnt upset or anything... Rather, I was made to realise I needed to improve... I worked on my bowling and, thanks to God, was able to deliver at a critical time... 

Incidentally, Sreesanth picked Jacques Kallis dismissal (caught by Sourav Ganguly) in the second innings as the one which gave most satisfaction. 

The youngster, though, will be well advised as selection committee chairman Dilip Vengsarkar put it to curb his exuberance.

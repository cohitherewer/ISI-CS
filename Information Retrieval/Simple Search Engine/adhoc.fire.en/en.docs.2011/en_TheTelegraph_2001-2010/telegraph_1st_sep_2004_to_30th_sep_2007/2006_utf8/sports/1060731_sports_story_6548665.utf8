 Pak debacle reflects plight of hockey in subcontinent

- There rsquo;s still hope for us in the World Cup if we prepare well 

Stickwork

Gurbux Singh

Its time to get buttoned up for hockeys showpiece event, the World Cup. We are already in the process of selecting those who will serve the country in Monchengladbach, Germany, in September. 

Weve identified a pool of 25. Barring an injury or some other external factor, these players will feature in a tournament in Chennai from August 12 to 16. Thereafter, a series has been planned in Belgium, which will be finalised shortly. Then the squad will travel to Germany a few days before the World Cup, to get acclimatised to conditions there. 

I should make it clear that we are in a very tough group in the World Cup. Our campaign will start against the hosts on September 6 and well end our pool engagements with inarguably the toughest match, versus Holland on September 12. In between, well face England, South Africa and South Korea. 

Pakistan are clubbed with Australia, Spain, Argentina, New Zealand and surprise package Japan in the other group. Form and talent-wise, we can get the measure of Germany. True, they will enjoy home support, but they are not in the same league as Australia, Holland and Spain. On current performance, India have little chance against tournament-favourites Holland, and therefore, we need to plan our strategy properly. 

Assessing the opponents strengths and weaknesses accurately is like an added string to your bow. We cant afford to squander points against teams like England, South Africa and South Korea. Im not trying to build a castle in the air, but with good planning and backed up by solid performance, we can overcome those challenges. 

Weve already had a chance to see how the Dutch are planning to go for the kill at the games biggest stage. Seeing the Austral-Asian performance in the ongoing Champions Trophy in Spain has been a very depressing experience. Australias 3-5 loss to the hosts, after being three up at one point, was shocking. I still feel the Australian game is the modern version of the Dhyan Chand-style and it was disturbing to see them lose like that. 

Then, I am at a loss for words to describe Pakistans 2-9 defeat to the Dutch. The more I think about that match, the more I shudder about the plight of subcontinental hockey. The kind of talent teams like Holland and Spain are unearthing is mind-blowing. It reminds me of the Golden Age of Indian hockey when, if we entered three teams in a tournament, we would finish 1-2-3, almost unchallenged. Hollands elevation to the top can be attributed to a couple of basic factors. Firstly, hockey is the No. 1 game in the country. And then, they have a very well-organised and professional domestic league in which even top players from India and Pakistan feature on a regular basis. 

No doubt, Pakistan hockey is undergoing a period of turmoil and uneasiness. The PHF secretary Musarratullah Khan has resigned. They have fallen back on senior pros like Sohail Abbas. When you are calling someone out of retirement, its obvious that there is a problem in the existing talent pool. 

In the backdrop of this gloomy scenario in the subcontinent, the Indian players must realise the importance of playing well in the World Cup. Of course, Im not hoping for a medal from Germany. But if we play a little better than what we did in the Azlan Shah Cup, we can expect a berth in the last-four stage. 

I only hope that the positives from the Azlan Shah meet are carried forward in Germany. Nothing can boost Asian hockey more than fine shows by India and Pakistan in the World Cup.

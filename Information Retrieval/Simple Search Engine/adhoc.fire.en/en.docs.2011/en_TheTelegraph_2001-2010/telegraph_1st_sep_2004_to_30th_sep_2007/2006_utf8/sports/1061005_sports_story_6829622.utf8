 WI warm up in style

 Chris Gayle en route to his 101 on Wednesday 

Ahmedabad: In a perfect start to their campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy, the West Indies on Wednesday steamrolled GCA Presidents XI by winning the warm-up game by 173 runs at Motera Stadium near here. 

Aided by an unbeaten 101 by fiery opener Chris Gayle, the Caribbeans scored an imposing 344 for six in their allotted 50 overs. In reply, GCA XI managed just 171 for six in 50 overs. 

Though Shivnarine Chanderpaul (15) perished early, edging an Ashraf Makada delivery to wicket-keeper Nilesh Modi in the sixth over, Gayle took a liking to both spinners and pacers and hammered them all around the park. 

Before Gayle retired at a personal score of 101 in the 28th over, the left-handed batsman struck five sixes and 12 fours, sharing a 175-run partnership for the second wicket with Runako Morton, who scored 91 runs in 97 balls. 

For GCA XI, Ashraf Makda was the only notable bowler who finished with three wickets for 65. The Carribeans were led by Sarwan after the team management rested Brian Lara for the game. 

Meanwhile, GCA XIs batting failed to put up a fight with 47 extras being the top scorer for the team. 

The lone resistance came from Neeraj Patel (37) and Hem Joshipura (32 not out).

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Invitation becomes reality 

 OUR TURF CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta: The hosting of the Indian Turf Invitation Cup at the RCTC raceground is going to be a reality. At an EGM on Saturday, majority of the club members voted in favour of the event, though the cost of hosting such a bonanza would be cut down drastically by more than half. Doubts were being raised by a large number of members about the staging of the mega event in view of the clubs poor finances.

 The hosting of the Invitation Cup was cleared by the club members but the dates will be changed because of the Holi festival, said Cyrus Madan, an RCTC steward.

 Members also voted for the sale of D.L.Khan property which was one of the root causes for unrest among many members in the past three months. Their main grudge was that the property was being sold for peanuts to a steward who subsequently resigned. 

 All of us know the cash crunch faced by the club and such a sale would give a breathing space. What we wanted was transparency in all such deals, said a member who did not wish to be identified.

 Opinions were, however, divided among them about the City Club plans or a shopping mall at the Russell Street property. The matter has been kept in abeyance and it may come under discussion at the next EGM in early November, said Madan.

 2nd IM norm for Saptarshi 

New Delhi: International Master S. Satyapragyan outplayed Himanshu Sharma but remained at considerable distance from earning his maiden Grandmaster-norm after the eighth round of the Parsvnath International Open Chess Championships here on Friday. 

Saptarshi Roy earned his second IM-norm after drawing with IM Abdulla Al-Rakib of Bangladesh. The Calcutta player offered a draw to his opponent before the game began which the Bangladeshi refused. Saptarshi then played four knight defence opening with white and drew only in 10 moves. 

Parimarjan Negi drew with black pieces against GM Ziaz Murshed of Bangladesh and needs only a win on Saturday to secure his second GM-norm in the successive tournaments. 

Meanwhile, top seed Alexei Fedorov of Belarus defeated International Master Sriram Jha to maintain his half point lead, with a tally of 7.5 points, over Satyapragyan and Grandmaster Pavel Kotsur of Kazakhstan. (PTI)

 Six-wkt win for Pakistan A

Abu Dhabi: Pakistan A bounced back from an agonising defeat against arch-rivals India to hand a crushing six-wicket win to the Netherlands A in the Eurasia Series Limited Overs Cricket Tournament on Monday. 

After seamer Yasir Arafats bowling exploits (4/36) saw the European team being skittled out for a meagre 183, Pakistan A romped home with more than 17 overs to spare in the group D second leg match. 

Top-order batsman Shahid Yousuf hit a well-paced 62 while captain Hasan Raza was unbeaten on 41. The duo featured in a match-winning partnership of 65 runs for the third wicket.

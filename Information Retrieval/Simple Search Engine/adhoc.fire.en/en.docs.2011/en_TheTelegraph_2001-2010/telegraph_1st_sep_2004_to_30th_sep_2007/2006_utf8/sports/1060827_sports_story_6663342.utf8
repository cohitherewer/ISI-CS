 Win could be turning point: Biswajit

 Bhaichung gets a pat from East Bengal coach Carlos Roberto Pereira on Saturday 

Calcutta: Mohun Bagan coach Biswajit Bhattacharya felt that the victory against arch-rivals East Bengal could well be the turning point of the ongoing Sahara Calcutta Football League 2006. Though we were playing well in the last few matches, victory eluded us and so we needed a win to turn around, Bhattacharya told the reporters at a post-match news conference on Saturday. 

Bhattacharyas counterpart Carlos Roberto Pereira da Silva was in no mood to lament on his luck factor. Why should I blame it on luck factor? We failed to put the ball inside the net, which is all-important, he stated. We have lost the match 0-1, thats finished, he quipped. 

The green-and-maroon coach also felt that his boys were deprived from a penalty when Bhaichungs right footer struck Vincent Pires inside the box. 

Bhattacharya seemed worried about his midfielders and defenders, most of whom are not cent percent match fit. 

We will have to release players for the national camp, I dont how to cope with the situation, he said. Pereira who will also have to do without the services of quite a few players who will leave to attend the national camp shared the concern. We have to make five changes in the next game, which is very difficult for any team to adjust, but I am confident of a good show. 

Asked about East Bengals misses, Mohun Bagan coach said it was a part of the game. They played really well but missed the chances, we scored from the chance we created and the record books will say that Mohun Bagan won the match 1-0, he remarked. 

Bhattacharya, however, thanked his players and officials for having faith in his plans and formations before the derby match.

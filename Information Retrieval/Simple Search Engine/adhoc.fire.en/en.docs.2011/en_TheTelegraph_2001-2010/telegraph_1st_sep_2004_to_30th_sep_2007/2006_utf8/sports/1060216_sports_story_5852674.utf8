 India high on incentive, low on resource 

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nayeem is even thinking 

 of beating Japan in their own den

New Delhi: High on incentives, but low on resources, India are all set to leave from here on Thursday morning to play the Asian Cup qualifying group league match against Zicos Japan in Yokohama on February 22. On the way to Japan, the team will play a practice match against Hong Kong on Saturday. 

A year ago India played Japan in the World Cup qualifiers and lost by 11 goals. They conceded seven in the away match and four at the Salt Lake Stadium. 

While the chief coach, Syed Nayeemuddin, in his characteristic style, talked about his vision of beating the continents best side in their own den, the reality projected a completely different picture. 

As it is placed 99 ranks below Japan in the Fifa rankings, India are going to Japan leaving behind some of the key players. Defenders Sameer Naik and M. Suresh, midfielders S. Venkatesh and Climax Lawrence and striker Abhishek Yadav could not make the trip because of injuries. 

While stopper back Deepak Mondal could not be contacted for joining the squad, skipper Bhaichung Bhutia went through the rigours of a full training session only on Tuesday. 

Nayeemuddin, as usual, is putting up a brave front. Dont talk about individuals. Lets talk about the team. All my boys are capable of making the team champions, he said. 

I know Japan have qualified for the World Cup. But whats the big deal? I am only looking for a victory at Yokohama. 

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is aware of the humiliation India suffered in the hands of Japan in the World Cup qualifiers. 

The AIFF president, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi tried his best to lift the morale of the boys on Tuesday evening when he visited the team hotel and announced a series of financial incentives for the boys. 

While each player was presented with a purse of Rs. 10,000 as match fee, the footballers, according to team manager PK Banerjee, have been promised a bonus of Rs. 1 lakh each if they manage to upset Japan. 

In case of a draw, the players will receive Rs. 50,000 each. A victory against Yemen here on March 1, Das Munshi promised, will fetch each player a bonus of Rs. 25,000 each. 

Das Munshis announcements, no doubt, did cheer up the Indian camp quite a bit. But its not that everything went off smoothly. 

The chief coach managed a few video cassettes of the Japan team, but it took the AIFF nearly a week to arrange for a VCD player to watch the cassettes. It was supplied only on Wednesday morning after the final practice. Even the squad, as one member of the team management alleged, was announced by the federation without bothering to consult the chief coach.

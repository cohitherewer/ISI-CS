 Advani shocked 

Chennai: World snooker champion Pankaj Advani suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Maharashtras Aditya Mehta in the BSNL National Junior Snooker Championship on Sunday. 

Each frame in the best-of-seven final went neck and neck. But Aditya put up a better show, making good use of his visits and often putting the defending champion in two minds. Aditya eventually had the last laugh, winning it 85-28, 103-1, 8-63, 63-51, 15-78, 70-38. 

Mehta came up with breaks of 85 in the first and 59 in the second frames.

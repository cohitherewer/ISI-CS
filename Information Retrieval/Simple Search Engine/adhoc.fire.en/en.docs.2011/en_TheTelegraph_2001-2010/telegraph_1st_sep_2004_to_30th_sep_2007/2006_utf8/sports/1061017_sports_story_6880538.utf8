 Bengal lose 0-2 to Goa

 - Former champions must beat Punjab to make semi-finals

 Nabi missed a golden opportunity 

Gurgaon: Bengals quest for entering the semi-finals of the Santosh Trophy suffered a major setback at the floodlit Devi Lal Sports Complex here on Monday when they went down to 0-2 to Goa. 

After an encouraging start, Bengal turned lacklustre to concede a goal at the stroke of half-time and one more a couple of minutes before the final whistle to hand over an emphatic victory to the defending champions. 

Except for a few minutes in the first half when Bengal initiated a few attacks, the 29-time champions were left to play second fiddle. Bengal, actually, should consider themselves lucky for not losing the match by a bigger margin. 

With three points from two matches, Bengal have now pushed themselves to a must-win position against Punjab in the last group league match to be played on Wednesday. Punjab, who drew goalless with Haryana in the days first match, have four points, while Goa have three points. They, however, are in an advantageous position since their last match is against Haryana, the weakest team in the group. 

As Bengal coach Prasanta Banerjee later agreed, the team from the eastern metropolis never could play combined football. While Banerjee blamed lack of combined practice was the primary reason behind the defeat, it was the lack of will to play all out football that cost Bengal dearly. 

Goa, on the other hand, came with a positive approach. They took time to settle down and then harassed the Bengal defence with some fine wing play. While Nicolas Rodrigues, the Best Player of Santosh Trophy last year and Samir Naik were the main tormentors for Goa, equally efficient were Peter Carvalho and Freddy Mascarenhas, who worked in tandem to tear open the Bengal defence. 

The first goal in the 30th minute was the result of a flag-kick taken by Wilton Gomes from the left. Peter Carvalhos first try was a header, which was blocked by Rahim Nabi. But the Bengal defence had no resistance to offer when Carvalho sent the rebounder in with a crisp left-footer. 

The only positive chance Bengal received the whole match came a minute before the half time. Saumik Dey rushed through the left to cross at the goalmouth. Nabi, who stood unchallenged, fumbled in controlling the ball, thus allowing the defenders to run back and make a clearance. 

Induction of Tarif Ahmed in the second half in placed of Gouranga Dutta failed to add any sharpness to the Bengal attacks. Instead they lost control of the midfield and allowed the Goans to play around the Bengal penalty area. 

Freddy Mascarenhas scored the second goal when everything looked over. Wilton Gomes lobbed the ball at the goalmouth, which was parried away by Kalyan Chaubey. Mascarenhas controlled the rebound and shot home powerfully.

Chittagong: Sri Lanka moved to within sight of victory in the first Test after dismissing Bangladesh for 181 in the second innings on the third day. 

Needing 163 to go one-up, the Lankans were 25 without loss at stumps on Thursday. Upul Tharanga was on 19 and Michael Vandort on 6. 

Muttiah Muralidharan ran through Bangladeshs second innings with a six-for-54 haul, giving him nine wickets for the Test and making him the first bowler to break the 1,000 international wickets barrier. 

That the off-spinner is playing his 100th Test makes his achievement doubly significant. Murali now has 593 Test wickets and 411 ODI victims. 

Muralidharan said: I am happy to get some wickets because this helped me cross the 1,000 mark and also put my team on the winning track. 

Mohammad Rafique (40) top-scored for the hosts in their second innings, with top order batsman Nafees Shahriar making 38. 

Malinga Bandara and Dilhara Fernando captured two wickets each. 

Bangladesh coach Dav Whatmore was optimistic and pleased with his teams improvement. We are still very much in the game, he said.

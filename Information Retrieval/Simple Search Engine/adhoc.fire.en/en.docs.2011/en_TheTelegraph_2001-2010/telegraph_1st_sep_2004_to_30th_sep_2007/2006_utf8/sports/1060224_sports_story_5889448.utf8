 Mubarak, Mashud fined

London: Sri Lankas Jehan Mubarak and Khaled Mashud of Bangladesh have been fined following an incident in the second one-day International when Mubarak was given out caught behind by Mashud. 

Opener Mubarak was fined 25 per cent of his match fee for showing dissent. Mashud was fined 20 per cent of his fee for conduct which could bring the game into disrepute, the International Cricket Council said in a statement on Thursday. 

Hurst found Mubarak guilty of breaching an ICC Code which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision by action or verbal abuse, an ICC release said on Thursday. 

All level I breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand and a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee. 

Bangladesh won the second one-dayer by four wickets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Let this be a golden swansong

 - The team championship debacle was a blessing in disguise

Calcutta: This was one gold all of us had taken for granted. Estimates of how many India would garner in Doha varied from 10 to 20 before the Asian Games kicked off about a fortnight ago. But the doubles gold in mens tennis featured on everyones list. 

That sure-shot gold did come Indias way on Wednesday evening, but how? 

The story of Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathis Doha conquest can easily inspire an imaginative scriptwriter to come up with a compelling drama. A drama that was triggered by two unknown Taipei players who made a mockery of the multiple Grand Slam titlists reputation in the team championship contest 10 days ago. 

In the post-mortem of arguably their most humiliating defeat, charges flowed thick and fast all aimed at the less-than-fit Bhupathi. It needed an AITA directive to convince an angry Paes to stick with Bhupathi in the individual doubles event. 

With one reluctant tennis player joining forces with someone he thought was not worthy of donning India colours, doubts over that sure-shot gold clouded the minds of one and all. Many, in fact, struck off that medal from their list. 

Not the ones who knew them well. Not after what they had witnessed in 1999, when despite not being on talking terms for most of the year, Paes and Bhupathi reached the finals of all Grand Slams. 

Personal differences grew wider and the egos got larger, and they separated not once but twice on the ATP Tour. But whenever fate threw the two of them on the same side of a tennis court, there was this great urge to prove to each other what they were capable of. The chemistry never died. 

Even on Wednesday, as the charged up Ratiwatana brothers played out of their skin, it needed something special from the once world No. 1 pair to snatch gold literally from their opponents grasp. 

Did that rude jolt from the Taipei duo come as a blessing in disguise for the warring stars? Perhaps yes. Will the two doubles aces ever play another match together? Perhaps no. 

This is not the time to investigate what led to Paes and Bhupathis unbelievable defeat in the team championship. Neither is this the moment to question the wisdom of those who coaxed Bhupathi to change his mind of not playing for the country. 

This is the time to toast another magical triumph. Also, be practical rather than be swayed away by emotions. Let the Doha triumph mark the golden swansong of two of Indias most successful sportspersons as a doubles team. Let there not be a remote chance of another public spat featuring two men who once ruled the world of mens doubles.

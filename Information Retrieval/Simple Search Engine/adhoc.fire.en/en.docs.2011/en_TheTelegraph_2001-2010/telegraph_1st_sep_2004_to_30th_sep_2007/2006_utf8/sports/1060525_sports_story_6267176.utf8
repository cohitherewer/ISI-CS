 Rare double beckons Ronaldinho 

 - With eye on record, Ronaldo hopes to cock a snook at critics

Rio de Janeiro: Ronaldinho could complete a rare double by winning the World Cup little more than 50 days after inspiring Barcelona to victory in the Champions League title. 

While a total of 49 players have graced the finals of international and European club footballs greatest tournaments in the same season, only a fraction of that figure, eight, have managed to win both in the same year. 

Ronaldinhos teammate Roberto Carlos managed it in 2002, and another Real Madrid player, Frances Christian Karembeu achieved it four years earlier. But beyond that, you have to travel back 32 years, when six members of the Bayern Munich side led by Franz Beckenbauer lifted the 1974 European Cup before helping West Germany win the World Cup on home soil. 

To win the Champions League with Barcelona and the World Cup with Brazil would be something special, said Ronaldinho. 

But its not something that Im thinking about especially. The most important thing is to make sure that Im playing well so I can help the team achieve its goal. 

Fans in Brazil may complain that he struggles to reproduce his Barcelona form whenever he dons the famous lemon yellow jersey, but all the signs are that the 2006 World Cup could be Ronaldinhos tournament. Although there is not a major honour left for him to win, the 26-year-old remains hungrier than ever to taste success. 

Now that I know how nice it is to win those titles once, the motivation comes from wanting to win everything lots of times, he said. 

Ronaldo, meanwhile, after a season dogged by questions over his form and fitness, is planning once again to use footballs greatest stage as his platform to provide the answers. 

Four years ago the Brazilian striker arrived at the World Cup as a spent force, a pale, injury-ravaged imitation of the player once known simply as The Phenomenon. At least thats what the critics said. 

Seven games, eight goals and a World Cup winners medal later and the gap-toothed centre-forward was the toast of the Far East, leaving his critics to choke on helpings of humble sushi. 

With 58 goals in 91 matches for Brazil, Ronaldo remains a class apart. His scoring record is even more remarkable when set against the fact that injuries have sidelined him for around three years throughout his career. 

He is also within touching distance of becoming the leading World Cup goalscorer of all time. 

He currently stands on 12, two behind Germanys Gerd Muller on 14 and with first round opponents to include Japan, Australia and Croatia at the World Cup, only a brave man would bet against him equalling or bettering the record. 

Ronaldo insists he is not motivated by personal glory but admits he has one eye on the record. I cant deny that the record is one of my objectives. It is not the principal goal ? thats winning the World Cup ? but I would be so proud to be top-scorer in history and it will be on my mind.

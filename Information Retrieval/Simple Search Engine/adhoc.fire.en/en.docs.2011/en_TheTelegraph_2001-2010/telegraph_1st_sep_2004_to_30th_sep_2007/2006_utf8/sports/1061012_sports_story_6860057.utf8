 Jango upsets on last day 

 STAR RACER 

 Calcutta: With hot-favourites winning the last three events, punters had reason to smile on Wednesday, the concluding day of the monsoon season. The first half of the seven-event card was disastrous for the followers on money. Schumacher, Alcades and Jango were the chief spoilsport on a sultry afternoon.

 Lasting Love, in the main event, in the Defence Forces Cup, attracted big support but Delhi-based trainer, Shafiq Khan, had other ideas. His speedy ward Jango established a four-length lead from the start to frustrate efforts of the favourite, a Daniel David-trainee. Daniel, however, had his day made with the victory of Presidium and Royal Sunset. The D. Khaitan-duo of Silver Print and Olympic Medal also justified their short odds, winning their respective events the way they liked. C.Alford guided the two winners.

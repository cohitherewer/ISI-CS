The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Jadeja may play one more season

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Former India ODI captain Ajay Jadeja, whose international career ended when the match-fixing controversy broke in early 2000, is hoping to squeeze out some time for cricket in the ensuing season amidst busy media commitments. But it could well be his last season. 

My commitments with the media wont allow me to play much cricket. But I will be playing for Rajasthan only, Jadeja said on Sunday. 

The flamboyant allrounder was disappointed at being ignored by the national selectors despite having scored heavily for Rajasthan last season. 

Jadeja, was full of praise for Sourav Gangulys captaincy and found nothing wrong with the former Team India skippers e-mail accusing Jagmohan Dalmiya of playing with players careers. There is nothing wrong with the e-mail if he believes in the allegations and sticks to them. Friends do not always stay friends, he said. 

Asked if Sourav could make a return, the witty Jadeja, said: But he has already returned (to Calcutta). On a more serious note, he added it all depended on the selectors. 

Rating Team India coach Greg Chappell as fantastic, Jadeja said that the Australian was different from his predecessors as he was open to talks.

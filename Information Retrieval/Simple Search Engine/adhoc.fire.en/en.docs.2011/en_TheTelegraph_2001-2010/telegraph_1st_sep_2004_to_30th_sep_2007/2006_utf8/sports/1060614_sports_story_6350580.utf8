 Vidic out of World Cup

Billerbeck: Central defender Nemanja Vidic is out of the World Cup because of a knee injury, a severe blow to the beleaguered Serbia-Montenegro team. 

Vidic, of Manchester United, injured his left knee when he slid on grass during a Monday training session as he was reaching for a ball and left the pitch in pain, team spokesman Aleksandar Boskovic said on Tuesday. 

Vidic, considered the teams biggest star, sprained medial collateral ligaments in his left knee, putting him out of action for several weeks, which means he will miss the World Cup even if we reach the finals, Boskovic said. He said Vidic was in considerable pain. 

Meanwhile, the Czech Republic trained without their two first-choice strikers in Westerburg on Tuesday with Jan Koller and Milan Baros having injuries examined in a hospital. Team officials were uncertain when they would be available. 

Koller injured his right thigh in the 43rd minute of Mondays opening World Cup win over the US in Gelsenkirchen. He was taken to a Dortmund hospital on Tuesday to be examined by his former doctor from Borussia Dortmund, a Czech team physician said. 

Koller played for Dortmund from 2001 before moving to Monaco this month. 

Baros was still not fit enough to play with a foot injury he suffered in the final warm-up against Trinidad and Tobago on June 3. 

In Goettingen, Mexican striker Jared Borgetti will miss the rest of his countrys group D games, the teams doctor said. Borgetti, who had to be replaced with a leg injury in Sundays 3-1 win over Iran, will certainly be out of action for eight to 10 days, team doctor Jose Luis Serrano said. 

Didier Drogba, meanwhile, practised on Tuesday after two days of rest as Ivory Coast prepared for Fridays showdown with The Netherlands. After a battering 90-minute effort against an Argentina back-line that hounded him but could not prevent him from scoring, Drogba skipped his teams exhibition game against the local fifth division team in Troisdorf, south of Cologne. 

Midfielder Deco, already doubtful after clashing with teammate Costinha last week, trained separately from the rest of the squad in Gueterslohon Tuesday.

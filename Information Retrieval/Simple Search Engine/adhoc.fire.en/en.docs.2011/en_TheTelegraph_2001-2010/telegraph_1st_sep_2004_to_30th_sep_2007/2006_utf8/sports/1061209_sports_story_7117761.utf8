Calcutta: A former Sri Lankan captain and one of their greatest batsmen, a commentator and South African great (worlds best-ever right-handed opener, as Donald Bradman once said) and one of Indias most-successful captains When the trio (Arvinda de Silva, Barry Richards and Mohammed Azharuddin) are pitted against each other in a boxing ring at a city hotel on Friday, chances are that punches would fly thick and fast though related to cricket. 

The topic, unmistakably was Indian cricket, which perhaps has reached a new low especially after the reality bites in Kuala Lumpur; flop show in the ICC Champions Trophy; and, more recently, their abject surrender to the Proteas in the ODI series in South Africa. 

Right from what went wrong to what needs to be done, the experts were tongue-in-cheek in the close to one-hour-long discussion. 

Here are excerpts: 

ON INDIAS PERFORMANCE 

Richards: Ive got a different set of views on this. This has been an age-old problem for India. Theres no point in blaming the selectors or the team; obviously they have chosen the best team to play for the country, though there might have been a couple of niggles here and there. 

Australia, South Africa and New Zealand have always been difficult tours for Indiawhy should you not introspect on that? Dont hang the players. But you should question the system, which is producing the players, for not preparing themselves properly. There has to be long-term planning to develop the Indian cricket; you cannot win a match with a 10-minute planning. 

Also, I think (Irfan) Pathan could have made the difference had he generated swing. He would have been a tough one against the likes of Gibbs or Kallis. However, the real disappointment came from Harbhajan Singh it seemed he lacked confidence. His performance worries me. 

Azharuddin: This (their dismal performance in South Africa) is not something new; I think we got to be a bit more aggressive and play strategically. If the opening partnership is not clicking we should think of sending Dhoni ahead. Were allowing the fast bowlers to dominate; we should try to do something differently, maybe in technique (like standing outside the leg stump), so as to unsettle them (the fast bowlers). 

ON THE FAILURE OF OPENERS 

Richards: The failure of the opening partnership has much to do with Indias poor showing. Its been a long time that (Virender) Sehwag contributed. About Sachin, his role has changed over the years. With (Rahul) Dravid, they are the two rocks of the team. 

Azharuddin: Sehwags poor run is putting pressure on the inexperienced middle-order. However, Sachin is not past his prime. Theres much cricket left in him; however he needs to play his natural game. 

De Silva: I think its because of media pressure, Sachin is not performing to his potential. Theres still at least five years left in him. 

ON GREG CHAPPELLS EXPERIMENTATION 

Richards: Gregs is an overrated profession. Its the captain who leads the side, not the coach. I think Greg came to India with a viewto better Indian cricket, which cant be achieved overnight; its a long-term plan. 

Azharuddin: Experiments are good when you, as a team, are clicking; but they dont click you should go back to the conventional way of thinking.

 East Bengal set sights on Felix

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta: Disappointed by the performance of the two Brazilians Luiz Octavio DSouza and Marcio Fernandes Thomas East Bengal have set their sights on the Nigerian Felix Chimaokwu of Calcutta Port Trust. 

The Nigerian forward has been in excellent form with Aloke Mukherjees Port Trust during the ongoing CFL Premier Division. 

Mukherjee has even described him as the best foreigner after Mike Okoro currently playing in the country. 

It has been learnt that East Bengal are keen to test him once the Premier Division gets over. 

Meanwhile, Mohammedan Sporting have released Douglas da Silva and are seeking to bring in a foreigner, currently playing in Malaysia. 

Well soon sit with the coach (Subhas Bhowmick) and put everything in place, said a club official. 

Incidentally, Mohammedan Sporting are also interested in Felix. The Nigerian had already played for them a couple of seasons ago. 

Its still not confirmed but East Bengal will soon show either Luiz or Marcio the door.

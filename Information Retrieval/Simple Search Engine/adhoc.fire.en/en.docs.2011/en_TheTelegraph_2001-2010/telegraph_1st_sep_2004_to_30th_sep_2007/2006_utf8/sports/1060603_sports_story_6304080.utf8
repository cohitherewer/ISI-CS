 Ponting hot on Sachin heels

Dubai: Hot on Sachin Tendulkars heels with 31 hundreds under his belt, Australian captain Ricky Ponting believes he is better placed than the Indian maestro to score more centuries in the coming days. 

Sachin has still got a few more years left in the game. So I will have to catch up with him. It is only in the last couple of years that I have managed to reach reasonably close to him. (But) I am only 31 years old and so Ive got a few more years ahead of me to get a few more hundreds, he said in a Dubai daily on Friday. (PTI)

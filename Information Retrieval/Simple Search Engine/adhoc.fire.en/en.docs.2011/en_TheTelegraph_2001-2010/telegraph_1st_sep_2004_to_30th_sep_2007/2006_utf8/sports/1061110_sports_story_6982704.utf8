The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Ajit Agarkar provisionally cleared

 - Yuvraj Singh to be re-examined by Dr Anant Joshi in New Delhi on Monday 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Ajit Agarkar

 Calcutta: Ajit 

 Agarkar, who suffered a hairline fracture on his left thumb 

 in the Champions Trophy match against the West Indies last 

 month, has been provisionally cleared by the 

 one whose opinion counts the most Dr Anant Joshi. 

If Team India physio John Gloster, too, is satisfied with his recovery, then the Mumbai-based allrounder is to head for South Africa in the early hours of Tuesday. 

Should the Agarkar-cookie crumble that way, stand-by Vikram Rajvir Singh will have to wait for his next trip overseas. 

The squad, incidentally, has only been chosen for the five-match ODI series which begins on November 19. The Test selection is at a later date. 

 Dr Joshi feels that Agarkar 

 is going to be absolutely fit by November 19. Now, the ball 

 is in Glosters court, a top Board of Control 

 for Cricket in India official told The Telegraph 

 on Thursday afternoon. 

As of now, Agarkar is to undergo a fitness test on Friday. 

 Yuvraj Singh

 Meanwhile, top gun Yuvraj Singh 

 will be re-examined by Dr Joshi in New Delhi on Monday. 

Theres more flexibility in the (left) knee, but I dont know whether surgery is going to be necessary As Ive said, this is a difficult period for me and Im hoping for a quick recovery... I have no choice, remarked Yuvraj, speaking exclusively from Chandigarh. 

Yuvraj, who narrowly missed getting the ICCs ODI Player of the Year award (it went to Michael Hussey), got injured while playing kho-kho on the eve of the Champions Trophy match versus Australia. 

That was part of the warm-up exercise and, as first reported in these columns (on October 31), the senior national selectors have asked the team management to do away with such high-risk games. 

 Yuvrajs pain (and Team Indias loss), though, 

 cant be lessened.

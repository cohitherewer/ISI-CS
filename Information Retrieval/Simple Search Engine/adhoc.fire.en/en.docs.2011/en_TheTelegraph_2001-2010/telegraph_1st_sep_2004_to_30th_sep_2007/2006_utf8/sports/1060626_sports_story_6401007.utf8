 Final ahead of the finale?

Stuttgart: Germany versus Argentina in Berlin. Has the World Cup fast-forwarded to July 9 already? The biggest game of this thrilling championship has come 11 days too soon. Sorry, Brazil, Italy, England et al. But right now, this should be the final. 

Juergen Klinsmanns Germans swept past Sweden 2-0 on Saturday to give their fans an expected glimpse of a fourth World Cup. Winner in 1954, 1974 and 1990, Germany look like a far better side than the one that scraped into the final four years ago to lose predictably to Brazil, and Klinsmann has won the public over as he has unearthed a very talented team. 

Good enough to win the title again? You bet. The fact the final is in Berlin is another motivational goal for the Germans, who have never played a championship game in their capital. 

Germany have won three world and three European titles in big cities all around Europe. When the events were held on home soil, however, the finals had to be in Munich because Berlin was a divided city before unification in 1991. 

Klinsmann chose to have his training camp near Berlin, saying: This is our capital. This is where we want to be. The German fans, growing in confidence that this is their year, will give Fridays game a World Cup final atmosphere as his young team face their biggest test yet. 

 With their Polish-born strikeforce of Lukas Podolski and Miroslav Klose again working well in tandem, Germany created a dozen chances in the first half-hour against the Swedes. Barely two weeks ago, their chances of beating Argentina looked slim. Judging by Saturdays games, Germany are now the favourites. 

 Argentina needed a wonderful goal from Maxi Rodriguez to subdue Mexico 2-1 in extra time on Saturday night. Jose Pekermans team was nowhere near its best, but anyone who saw his team rout Serbia-Montenegro 6-0 knows the talent he has to choose from matches even Brazil at this World Cup. 

 He reverted to Javier Saviola and Hernan Crespo as his starting strikers, with Lionel Messi and Carlos Tevez as their second-half replacements, and that is likely to be the pattern in Berlin. 

Pekerman says any matchup of Germany and Argentina is one featuring two great teams in the history of the World Cup. Argentina beat West Germany 3-2 in the 1986 final in Mexico City, and the Germans triumphed 1-0 in Rome four years later. 

 Diego Maradona played in both finals ? the second against Klinsmann ? and hes effectively become Argentinas unofficial 24th squad member. 

 Wearing an Argentina shirt, he walked to the VIP area at half-time to shake hands with Fifa president Sepp Blatter and Franz Beckenbauer. 

Fridays quarter final game in Berlins Olympic Stadium cant come soon enough.

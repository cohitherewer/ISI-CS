The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Dont intend wasting my money: Imran

 - No plans to buy Musharrafs memoir 

LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI

 Calcutta: Given 

 President Pervez Musharrafs more than passing interest 

 in cricket (hes the patron-in-chief of the Pakistan 

 Cricket Board), its possible he has read the two books 

 bearing Imran Khans name All Round View, 

 published in 1988, and Ivo Tennants 1994 biography, 

 Imran Khan. 

In any case, both hit the stands long before Pakistans most celebrated cricketer turned to politics. Today, of course, Imran (who heads the Tehrik-e-Insaaf) is a Member of the National Assembly. 

However, even if Musharraf has read either All Round View or Imran Khan, Imran has no plans to buy Musharrafs maiden literary effort In the Line of Fire, which has memoir-status. Released last month, it appears to be doing rather well. 

 I dont intend wasting 

 my hard-earned money... In the Line of Fire is certainly 

 not going to be on my bookshelf... Actually, we Pakistanis 

 see it as In the Line of Embarrassment! 

 Imran spat, during a chat with The Telegraph. 

Speaking from Islamabad, he added: By all accounts, the book has been used to project an individual at the cost of the nation... Coming from the head of state, its a shameful exercise. 

Trust Imran not to mince words. 

Incidentally, in the period immediately after assuming power (exactly seven years ago), Musharrafs relations with Imran had been pretty cordial. In fact, hed even offered him the Prime Ministership. 

 All that is history and, for quite some time, Musharraf 

 has been in Imrans line of fire.

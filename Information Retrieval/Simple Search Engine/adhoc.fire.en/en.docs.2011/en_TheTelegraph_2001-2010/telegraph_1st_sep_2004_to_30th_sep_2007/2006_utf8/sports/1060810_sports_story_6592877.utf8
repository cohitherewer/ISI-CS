Toronto: World No. 1 Roger Federer and defending champion Rafael Nadal returned from vacation to post routine first-round wins at the Toronto Masters on Tuesday. 

Back in action for the first time since their Wimbledon showdown, Federer celebrated his 25th birthday by easing past Frenchman Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-3, 6-4, while Nadal shook off the rust with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Chiles Nicolas Massu. 

Federer and Nadal, the worlds two outstanding players, have met in five finals this year and appear headed for another mouth-watering clash on Sunday. 

The muscular Spaniard and silky smooth Swiss have taken ownership of the mens game, winning six of the last seven Grand Slams and 12 of the 14 Masters Series events, including the last two Toronto Masters.Federer, who spent a month off savouring a fourth consecutive Wimbledon title at his training and holiday base in Dubai, was typically efficient, improving his seasons hardcourt record to 29-1, his only loss coming to Nadal in the Dubai final. 

Federer, the 2004 Toronto champion, will next meet in-form Frenchman Arnaud Clement, who won his second title of the season on Sunday in Washington and strolled into the second round by crushing Spains Alberto Martin 6-1, 6-2. 

I was home last year so its good to be back on the road again for my birthday, said Federer, who was presented with a cake while the centre court crowd sang Happy Birthday to the eight-time Grand Slam winner. 

After a months layoff spent fishing and visiting Euro Disney, Nadal laboured against the feisty Chilean, particularly in a tough opening set that lasted 68 minutes. 

Marat Safin was bundled out in the first round 5-7, 7-5, 2-6 by seventh seed Tommy Robredo of Spain. Australian 11th seed Lleyton Hewitt narrowly avoided a first round exit, rallying past Argentinas Juan Ignacio Chela 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in a two hour, 35 minutes marathon.

 Compensation for NZC 

Wellington: The New Zealand government will pay its national cricket body NZ $406,000 in compensation for the cancellation of last years tour by Zimbabwe, sports minister Trevor Mallard said. 

The tour was abandoned when the government refused visas to Zimbabwean players in protest over human rights breaches by the government of Robert Mugabe. 

We decided the tour was not appropriate given the governments continuing human rights abuses, Mallard said.

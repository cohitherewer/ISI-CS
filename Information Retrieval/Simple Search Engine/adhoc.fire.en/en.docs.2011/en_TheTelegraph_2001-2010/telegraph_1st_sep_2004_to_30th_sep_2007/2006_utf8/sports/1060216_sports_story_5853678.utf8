 Jharkhand, Assam win

OUR CORRESPONDENT

Dhanbad: Jharkhand notched up a nail-biting one-run win over Tripura at the Digwadih Stadium on Wednesday to stay in contention in the East Zone one-dayers meet. 

Tripura needed two runs for a tie off the last ball. Mihir Diwakar prevented Vinit Jain from going for a big shot and restricted the scoring to just a single. The hosts owe their victory to some tight bowling in the final 10 overs of the Tripura innings and a brilliant knock by skipper Rajiv Kumar. 

In another match, Assam defeated Orissa by five wickets at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium on Wednesday.

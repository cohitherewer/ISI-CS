 Malik yet to get over fathers death

OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A real difficult period for me, says Malik 

Peshawar: Shoaib Malik, who lost his father on the last day of the second Test (Faisalabad), is still grieving. 

Frankly, I havent recovered... Parents just cant be replaced aur gam abhi bhi hai... I know whoever comes has to one day leave, but this is a real difficult period for me, he told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Saturday evening, Malik added: However, a new series is beginning in two days and Im pulling myself together... Im sure God will give strength to perform whatever Im asked to do... 

The allrounder (who is engaged to our Hyderabads Ayesha), it may be recalled, had to miss the third and final Test ? Karachi.

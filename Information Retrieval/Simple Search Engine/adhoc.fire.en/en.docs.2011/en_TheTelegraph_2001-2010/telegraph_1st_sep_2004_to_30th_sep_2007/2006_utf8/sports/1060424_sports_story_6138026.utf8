 Donovan has a point to prove to the Germans

 SIMON HART

 Landon Donovan 

Remember Landon Donovan? If youre struggling to place the name, cast your mind back four years to when the United States pulled off one of the great World Cup shocks by defeating Portugal 3-2 and then knocked out Mexico before succumbing to Germany in the quarter finals ? a game they might have won had they not been denied a clear penalty. 

The common denominator in those performances was their 20-year-old playmaker, whose dazzling contribution received official recognition when he became the first American to be named Best Young Player of the tournament. It goes to show how fleeting success can be. 

Donovans attempt to establish himself in Europe ended in failure and now he finds himself back at home playing for Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer. He is a big fish in a small backwater ? a pin-up boy in his home country but barely remembered this side of the Atlantic. You could say he has something to prove. 

The fact that the World Cup is taking place in Germany has extra significance for the Californian because it was at Bayer Leverkusen where his career stalled. In 1999, aged 17, he became the youngest American to sign for a European club but, unable to break into the first team in the Bundesliga, he was loaned back to MLS and the San Jose Earthquakes. Last year he returned to Germany but again failed to impress, so it was back to MLS, this time with LA Galaxy. 

I cant sit here and say I was an amazing player, he says, with commendable candour. I had games where I accept I was poor and it just didnt work out. Sometimes things dont always happen the way you want. 

It is with the same honesty that he admits the quality of MLS falls a long way short of the European game. The gap has closed but theres still a big difference, he says. Im not stupid enough to believe that we could beat Premier League teams on a regular basis, but were getting there. 

The limitations of MLS explain why the United States suffer a trade deficit when it comes to the buying and selling of top-quality players. 

The American squad divide themselves into the comparatively well-paid domestic players and the super-rich exports to Europe ? the haves and the have-lots ? which is something of a headache for the countrys coach, Bruce Arena. 

Rarely able to pick his first-choice team due to players club commitments, he will have only a three-week training camp in which to gel his players into a single fighting unit. Donovan says the teams goal is just to make it through the qualifying group in Germany and then anything can happen. 

As in 2002, he promises the plan is to go on the attack. We have to play that way, he says. Ten years ago it was like, Lets sit back and pray that we get a tie. But if we want to be considered one of the best teams in the world, we have to be positive. 

Donovan insists he is genuinely enjoying life back in the States, though he does not rule out a return to Europe. I never say never but the last time I checked, teams in Europe werent falling over themselves to sign me so I dont have to worry about that right now, he says. 

As for wanting to prove a point in the country that rejected him, he says a bigger motivation would be to avenge the quarter final defeat by Germany and the infamous handball on the line by Torsten Frings that ended their World Cup campaign last time. 

I wont go there with a vendetta and feeling I hate Germany, he says. But if we play the Germans, then that will be different. Man, theres going to be an agenda then.

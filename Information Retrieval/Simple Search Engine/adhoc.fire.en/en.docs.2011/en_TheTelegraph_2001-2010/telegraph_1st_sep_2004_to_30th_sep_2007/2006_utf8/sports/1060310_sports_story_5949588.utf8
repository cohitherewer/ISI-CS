 Shera will be the mascot

New Delhi: Shera, the friendly tiger, will be the mascot for the 2010 Commonwealth Games to be hosted by the Indian capital. 

This was announced by the chairman of the organising committee, Suresh Kalmadi, here on Thursday. 

He said the 15-minute cultural extravaganza at the closing ceremony of the Melbourne Commonwealth Games on March 26 will be sponsored by the Delhi government. 

The programme, which would include several stars of the Indian entertainment industry, would be a great marketing opportunity for attracting sponsorship for the 2010 Games, Kalmadi said. Our effort would be to project Delhi as a great destination for sports. (PTI)

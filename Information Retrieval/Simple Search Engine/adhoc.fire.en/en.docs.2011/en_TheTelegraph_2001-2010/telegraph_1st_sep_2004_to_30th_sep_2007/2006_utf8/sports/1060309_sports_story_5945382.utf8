Chandigarh: Team India captain Rahul Dravid has been touched by Steve Waughs gesture of wishing him and the rest of the boys for the second Test in neighbouring Mohali and the remainder of the series against England. 

Currently in India on a business trip, the iconic Australian conveyed his best wishes through somebody known both to Dravid and him. 

Steves gesture is much appreciated and Ill definitely let the team know as well, Dravid told The Telegraph, after finishing with the Test-eve workout at the PCA Stadium. 

Dravid, incidentally, has written the foreward to Steves autobiography: Out of My Comfort Zone.

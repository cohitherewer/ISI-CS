 Quick Takes

 Magic Zurawskis 

 disappearing act

 Barsinghausen: When a 

 player is nicknamed Magic, its always 

 possible that hell disappear. Maciej Zurawski was 

 tipped to be Polands greatest hope at the World Cup, 

 but has been almost anonymous and mustered only one shot 

 on goal, while his team lost both their matches and crashed 

 out. Zurawski led scoring in qualifying with seven goals 

 in 10 matches, but the strikers performances since 

 then have been questioned and criticised. My scoring 

 form is obviously not what it was, Zurawski said on 

 Sunday. Its not like I can say I need 

 to be in good form for the World Cup, and Im 

 going to have it.

 Nickname game

 Celle: Most people think 

 Angola defender Loco got his name because he goes mad when 

 he gets on the soccer field. Thats crazy! The story 

 behind his nickname, which means crazy in Spanish, 

 is much more tame, and it started when he was only 9 years 

 old. The other kids said I played football in the 

 same style as Paris Saint-Germain player Patrice Loco, 

 Loco said. So everyone in the neighbourhood started 

 calling me Loco. Loco isnt alone. Lama got his 

 name because he admired former France goalkeeper Bernard 

 Lama. Its a custom that is really quite normal 

 in our country, said Angola forward Love, who got 

 his name because of his close relationship with his mother.

 Fan tantrums

 Mainz: A pair of English 

 fans went for a ride in their sleep, police said on Sunday, 

 failing to wake up when their van crashed into a parked 

 car in Mainz. At about 1 am on Saturday, the van rolled 

 across the road and collided with a parked car. It came 

 to a halt in the middle of the street, blocking traffic. 

 The two England fans were blissfully oblivious, police said. 

 Only after officers rocked and banged on the vehicle did 

 one of them eventually roll down the window.

 Munich police said a Scottish 

 resident was arrested on Saturday for raising his kilt and 

 exposing himself to passers-by ? including a police officer. 

 The man was taken to a police cell, where he tried to bite 

 an office.

 Fathers Day

 Goettingen: Mexico coach 

 Ricardo La Volpe gave his players a day off on Sunday to 

 celebrate Fathers Day. It was a particularly poignant 

 day for the Mexicans whose keeper, Oswaldo Sanchez, 

 flew home on the eve of the finals to attend the funeral 

 of his father. Fifty-year-old Felipe Sanchez, who was due 

 to travel to watch his son play at the finals, died from 

 a heart attack.

 Lenient Aussie PM

 Sydney: Australian Prime 

 Minister John Howard urged employers to show consideration 

 for workers who turn up bleary-eyed on Monday because they 

 stayed up for the broadcast of Australias World Cup 

 match against Brazil. Several million Australians are expected 

 to watch the match, which kicks off in the early hours of 

 on Monday morning, with Howard among them.

 New role for Milutinovic

 Frankfurt: Revelling in 

 his status as an ordinary tournament spectator, five-time 

 World Cup coach Bora Milutinovic said he never knew the 

 experience could be so much fun. This is the first 

 time in nearly 25 years that I can actually enjoy myself 

 without the stress of having to worry about my team, 

 Milutinovic said. I had forgotten the World Cup is 

 actually fun. Ive seen eight matches so far, travelled, 

 met old friends, and generally enjoyed myself tremendously.

 Short trouble

 Freiburg: It was an Orange 

 tail that could not get past the World Cup censors. Heading 

 into the stadium for the Dutch vs Ivory coast late on Friday, 

 some Dutch fans were refused entry for wearing orange pants 

 equipped with a fake lions tail ? an advertising gimmick 

 by a non-World Cup sponsor.

 Signing off

 Berlin: Soccers world 

 governing body has already raised more than 12 million euros 

 ($15.15 million) for its 6 Villages for 2006 

 campaign, including 500,000 euros ($631,000) from the World 

 Cup tickets auctioned on a German TV show. Now Fifa is putting 

 up for auction a book containing signatures of all 736 players 

 and coaches from 32 competing teams.

 Hello again

 Berlin: Itll be a 

 reunion of sorts for Switzerland coach Jakob Koebi 

 Kuhn and his Togo counterpart, Otto Pfister, when their 

 teams meet at the World Cup next week. Kuhn, 61, and Pfister, 

 68, go back 40 years, having first met as players in Switzerland. 

 Theyre also neighbours.

 Saudi player bereaved

 Hamburg: Saudi Arabia midfielder 

 Mohammad Al Shalhoub has gone home following the death of 

 his mother on Saturday, team officials said on Sunday. It 

 was not clear when he would return but he appears certain 

 to miss the Group H game with Ukraine in Hamburg on Monday.

 Musical training

 Berlin: Mexico trained 

 on Saturday to the rhythm of the popular Mexican group El 

 Recodo. The group, known for its infectious style simply 

 called banda (band), visited the teams 

 practice in Gottingen, where Mexico are training for their 

 match against Portugal.

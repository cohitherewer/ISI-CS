 Rumeli stars in India win

Karachi: Defending champions India inflicted a humiliating 10-wicket defeat on Pakistan in their last league match of the Asia Cup Womens cricket tournament on Monday to continue their superb unbeaten run here. 

India bowled out the hosts for a paltry 94 in 47.4 overs before racing to the target in 17.3 overs with all their wickets intact, in what was an inconsequential tie since India and Sri Lanka have already made it to the January 4 final. 

Mithali Raj made 38 off 57 balls with five fours while Rumeli Dhar scored a quickfire 54 off 48 balls studded with eight boundaries and a six.

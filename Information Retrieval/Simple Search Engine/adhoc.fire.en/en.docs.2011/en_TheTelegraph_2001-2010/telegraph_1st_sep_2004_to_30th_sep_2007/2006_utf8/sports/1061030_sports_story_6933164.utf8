 Ferrari want Schumacher as Todts number two

Monza: Ferrari want seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher to work as assistant to team boss Jean Todt although the German, who retired from the sport last week, said he will wait before deciding on his role. 

Michael will be a super assistant to Jean Todt, Ferrari president Luca Montezemolo told reporters at the Ferrari World event on Sunday. 

However, Schumacher said he would take his time before making any decision about his future role. I cant say anything precise about what I will do in the future and I dont want to define my role inside Ferrari yet, Schumacher told a news conference. 

I will take a break in the coming months and then I will be more clear about what I want to do. Ferrari have left me free to decide and have given me the time that I need to make up my mind, he added. 

Schumacher said he was looking forward to having a change of rhythm in his life. 

Meanwhile, Spains Formula One double world champion Fernando Alonso was also given a heros welcome at a civic reception in his home city of Oviedo on Sunday. 

The 25-year-old was greeted by thousands of fans decked out in the colours of his Renault team and waving the regional flag of Asturias which, like the French manufacturer, is blue and yellow.

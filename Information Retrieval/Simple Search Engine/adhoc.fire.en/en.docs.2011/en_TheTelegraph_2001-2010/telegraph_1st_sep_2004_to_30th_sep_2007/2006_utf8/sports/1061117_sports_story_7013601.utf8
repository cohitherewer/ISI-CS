 Randhawa in joint lead 

- Jeev Milkha shares sixth spot 

Hong Kong: Jyoti Randhawa of India and Spains Jose Manuel Lara shot matching six-under-par 64s for a share of the lead after the first round of the Hong Kong Open on Thursday. 

Defending champion Colin Montgomerie had a frustrating start to the $2 million tournament, carding a string of pars to end the day on one-under, while two-time US Open Champion Retief Goosen finished on level par after picking up three bogeys. 

Randhawa notched up seven birdies in a controlled round, including one at the 18th after a beautifully flighted approach shot over water that dropped less than a foot fro m the hole. 

My feel around the greens and my end shot was good ... I stayed with my shots and stayed committed today and I did well, said the Indian, who dropped just one shot on the 5th hole. 

However, Randhawa, who raced to a similar first round lead in last weeks Champions Tournament, rued not going even lower, after missing short birdie putts on the 16th and 17th holes. 

Lara did not drop a shot in his rise to the top of the leaderboard, sinking six birdies to finish one ahead of Briton Graeme Storm, Frenchman Gregory Bourdy and Chinas Liang Wen-chong. 

Liang enjoyed a blazing start to his round that included an eagle on the par-five third hole. Im very pleased, I never thought it would be so smooth out there today, he said, adding that he did not feel pressured at being Chinas top hope for the co-sanctioned Asian and European Tour event at the Hong Kong Golf Club in Fanling. 

His compatriot, Zhang Lianwei finished with a one-under 69, after dropping a stroke on the last hole. 

Montgomerie, who is aiming to continue a run that has yielded at least one title every year since 1993, said he was unhappy to be five strokes off the pace. 

Indias Jeev Milkha Singh and South Koreas Suk Jong-yul were among those flying the flag for Asia two shots behind the leaders in joint sixth place with Swede Jarmo Sandelin, Adam Blyth of Australia and Briton Simon Khan. 

That was a good start, but it could have been better. However I am not complaining, said Jeev, whose closest rival in the race for the Asian Tour Order of Merit, Prom Meesawat had a none-too-happy start at one-under 69, which placed him 42 nd. 

James Stewart of Hong Kong also pleased local fans by finishing three under for the day with a birdie at the last. 

New Zealander Michael Campbell remained within striking distance of the leaders after carding a patient 68. 

Of the other Indians in the field, Rahil Gangjee and Gaurav Ghei shot even par 70 each and were tied 59th. Both had four birdies, two bogeys and one double bogey each. 

Harmeet Kahlon had two birdies and five and was lying tied 115th, while SSP chowrasia shot two birdies and four bogeys in 74 and was tied 125th. 

Chowrasia was in danger of missing his first cut this season and to avoid that he needs to shoot a good low score on second day.

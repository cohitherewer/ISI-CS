 Jansher Khan arrested over property dispute 

 Peshawar: Police arrested Pakistans former 

 world squash No. 1 Jansher Khan on Thursday after a court 

 cancelled his pre-arrest bail in a dispute over ownership 

 of a house.

 Jansher was handcuffed and taken away in a police 

 van after emerging from the District and Sessions Court 

 in the north-western city of Peshawar, where his interim 

 bail against arrest was struck down, said Dost Mohammed 

 Khan, a Peshawar police officer. 

Under Pakistani law, anyone facing a criminal charge can secure bail from a court before the police arrest him. But bail has to be renewed and the court can strike it down at any time. 

A Peshawar woman complained to police last month that Jansher and several other men stormed into her home, tried to occupy the it and force the family out. She also accused Jansher and the other men of beating her, her husband and a son, according to the police official. 

Janshers brother-in-law, Mehboob Khan, a former squash player and coach, was also arrested on Thursday in connection with the dispute. Dost Mohammed did not have information on what charges the former squash players face. 

There was no comment from Jansher and his lawyer was not immediately available. Jansher had secured an interim bail to avoid arrest, but Judge Ihtisham Ali Khan cancelled his bail and ordered his arrest, said Dost Mohammed. (AP)

 Aussies pick uncapped Voges 

Melbourne: Australia have called up uncapped batsman Adam Voges and allrounder Andrew Symonds for the third Ashes Test match against England in Perth starting on December 14, Cricket Australia said on Friday. 

Voges, a 27-year-old who plays for Western Australia, comes in for Damien Martyn, who announced his retirement from first-class cricket earlier in the day. 

Symonds replaces paceman Shaun Tait in the 13-man squad, which took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series with the six-wicket victory in Adelaide on Tuesday.

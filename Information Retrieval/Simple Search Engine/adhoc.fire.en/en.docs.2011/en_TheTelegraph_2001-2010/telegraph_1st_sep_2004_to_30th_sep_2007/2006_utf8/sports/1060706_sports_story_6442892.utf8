The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 He has to continue, says Beckenbauer

 - The Juergen klinsmann question

Berlin: Germanys young team has a bright future and can be proud of its World Cup despite the 2-0 semi-final loss to Italy. The question now is how to persuade coach Juergen Klinsmann to stay. 

Klinsmann has asked for time before giving a final answer and is unlikely to make his decision known soon. German soccer officials want a quick reply but are willing to give Klinsmann time to make up his mind. 

Wed like an early reply but its the wrong time to put on pressure, team manager Oliver Bierhoff said on Wednesday. I wish he would stay. Klinsmann has been a stroke of luck for German soccer, German soccer federation (DFB) co-president Gerhard Mayer-Vorfelder said Wednesday. 

Hes started a project and he should continue it, Mayer-Vorfelder added. 

Klinsmanns contract ends after the World Cup and he has said before he wants to consult his family before making a decision. Klinsmann has resisted calls to move back to Germany from his adopted home in southern California. 

I need time to let this sink in, Klinsmann said after Tuesdays extra-time loss to Italy in Dortmund. I havent made a decision. I was only thinking so far as the final, not beyond it. Ive asked the federation to give me time. 

Franz Beckenbauer and other influential German soccer officials had criticised the way Klinsmann has overhauled the team and ditched Germanys usual safety-first tactics. The coach has also drawn fire for adopting US-style training methods and commuting from his home in the United States. 

But Klinsmann won them over with his teams exuberant, attacking style that pleased the fans and took Germany into the last four, way past early expectations. 

Even Beckenbauer urged Klinsmann to stay after Tuesdays game. He started a job that he hasnt finished. He wanted to be world champion, and he didnt manage it, so he has to continue, Beckenbauer said. 

Hes formed a young team that he trusts and that trusts him. It would be a terrible shame if we would go back to California, Beckenbauer said. 

He has to carry on this work. He has no choice. 

With a handful of players who could still be on the under-21 team, Germany will not peak until the 2008 European Championship or even until the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. 

This is their chance and he should stay. We saw that Italy was at its peak and that it has great experience. We are still away from our peak and we were a bit careless with our chances, Mayer-Vorfelder said. 

But compliments to the staff and the coach, he gave them self-belief and faith. This World Cup showed that the investment was good and sound. 

The federation has not released any figures, but Klinsmann has surrounded himself with a large staff he brought from outside that has increased the cost of running the team significantly. 

Nobody can now doubt the quality of Klinsmanns work, Bierhoff said. 

 After Germany complete their World Cup with the third-place 

 game in Stuttgart against either France or Portugal, their 

 next game is a friendly against Sweden on August 16 and 

 the DFB has said the team must have a coach by then. Germany 

 beat Sweden 2-0 in the second round of the World Cup.

 Player of the Day

 ANDREA PIRLO

 Andrea Pirlo is proving to be a key man in most of Italys 

 wins in this World Cup. Like in the opening match against 

 Ghana, Pirlo was once again controlling the midfield for 

 Italy, either in a defensive role or in a more advanced 

 position. 

 He also broke up the German counter-attacks on innumerable 

 occasions. And when the match was destined for a penalty 

 shoot-out, Pirlo plotted the downfall of the hosts with 

 a perfect assist that was converted into the first goal 

 by Fabio Grosso.

 Pirlo is generally regarded as one of the best midfield 

 players in the world today, especially in the Serie A. He 

 possesses good passing talent and creativity, thriving in 

 the deep-seated playmaking role in which he is employed 

 at AC Milan and Italy.

 Creative, with excellent passing ability and capability 

 of producing brilliant free-kicks, Pirlo is also a highly 

 successful footballer on set-piece moves.

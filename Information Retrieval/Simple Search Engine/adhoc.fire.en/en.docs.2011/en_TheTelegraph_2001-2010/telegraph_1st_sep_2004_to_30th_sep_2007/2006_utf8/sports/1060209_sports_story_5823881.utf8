 Kim Clijsters likely to return next week

 Clijsters has more than a 50 per cent chance of playing in Antwerp 

Brussels: World No. 1 Kim Clijsters says she has more than a 50 per cent chance of making an early return at her home tournament in Antwerp next week. 

The good news from my visit to the doctors today is that there is a very good chance that I will make Antwerp, the Belgian said on her website on Tuesday. 

Based upon todays diagnosis, the doctors think I can try and play some tennis by the end of this week. There is a better than 50-50 chance I will make it. 

The 22-year-old was forced to retire from her Australian Open semi-final against Frances Amelie Mauresmo last month when she fell and hurt her right ankle. 

Initial tests suggested an eight-week break from competition but doctors told her the ligament was not as deeply torn as the analysis in Australia initially indicated. 

However, it was not all good news for Clijsters as doctors suggested she should pick her tournaments carefully over the coming months. 

The doctors have advised me to watch my schedule on a weekly basis and I should be more aware of too much pressure on my joints, she said. 

Sliding on clay is quite damaging and I might therefore avoid the clay tournaments. 

If she proves her fitness, Clijsters will kick off her campaign in Antwerp on Wednesday. 

Belgian tennis fans will also be cheered by the addition of world No. 8 Elena Dementieva of Russia and Slovakian 14th-ranked Daniela Hantuchova to the events line-up. 

If Clijsters plays, six of the worlds top-10 will be in Antwerp with the Belgian and Dementieva joined by Mauresmo (2), Nadia Petrova (7), Patty Schnyder (9) and Venus Williams (10). 

Organisers have also confirmed they are in negotiations with world No. 5 Mary Pierce, another Frenchwoman.

It was a night when Brazil rediscovered themselves and, in doing so, gave an assurance to billions of fans around the world that they are very much alive and kicking. It was a night when Ronaldinho recovered some lost ground and redeemed his status as the worlds best player. It was also a night when Robinho announced his arrival on the big stage. But, most importantly, it was Ronaldos night. 

I doubt whether the World Cup has seen a bigger comeback story. Here was a man who had been written off by all and sundry, abused by some and ridiculed by others. What a test he faced Thursday night! 

Underdogs Japan, having soaked in immense pressure with some sound defensive organisation, scored a beauty in the 34th minute off a superbly-crafted counter-attack. The rejuvenated Brazilians kept raiding the Japanese citadel, but goalkeeper Kawaguchi came in the way of sure goals three to four times. The pressure was mounting on the already under-fire world champions. 

Just when it seemed Japan would go into half-time with a 1-0 advantage, Ronaldo struck with a neat header. That goal not only brought back the belief in himself, it fired up the team which produced some moments of typical Samba magic resulting in three beautiful goals after change of ends. 

Gilberto, playing at left-back, latched on to a defence-piercing diagonal ball from Ronaldinho and scored with a flawless placement. His overlapping skill looked as good as Roberto Carlos and he retreated quickly enough to defend as well. The day Carlos decides to quit, Brazil will have a ready replacement. 

Juninho showed why hes considered to be the worlds best player without a first XI berth in the national team. His powerful shot from at least 25 yards out swerved into goal, leaving Kawaguchi ? who was not far from the ball ? completely bewildered. 

Ronaldos second goal reminded me of his exploits in the last World Cup. Having played a neat wall with Juan, the master striker picked his spot and sent the ball into the corner of the net with minimum of fuss. 

That was a goal which can be scored only by great strikers, not good ones. 

It was his 14th goal in World Cup finals, putting him on par with Gerd Mueller. I wont be surprised if Ronaldo captures the record on Tuesday, against Ghana. 

If Ronaldo operated at 30 to 40 per cent of his potential in the first two games, he lifted it to 60 on Thursday night. He had a shot blocked by Kawaguchi, missed one narrowly after playing a dream 1-2 with Ronaldinho, shot wide once and headed straight to the keeper as well. He also showed his unselfish nature by supplying balls to Robinho and Kaka, instead of going for goals himself. 

The story of Ronaldos rebirth wont be complete without mentioning the name of the author. Yes, Ronaldo owes it to Parreira. The Brazil coach benched five of his regulars on Thursday, but not Ronaldo ? to give him another chance to shrug off the rust. 

Indeed, the faith Parreira showed on the striker over the past few days, very few in his shoes would have had the guts to do. 

If Parreiras patience helped Ronaldo regain his scoring touch, Robinho can claim some of the credit for Ronadinhos return to form. 

The young man started in place of Adriano and struck a sweet note in the opening 20 minutes, spurring Ronaldinho to come out of his shell and get into the creative mode. Robinho is faster than Ronaldinho, has a sharp attacking dodge, a great footballing sense and a lethal shot.

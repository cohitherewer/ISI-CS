Calcutta: Patrick Okonji was the catalyst as Mohammedan Sporting savoured the winning taste after four matches in the National Football League (NFL) for the ONGC Cup at the Salt Lake Stadium on Friday evening. 

The Mohammedan Sporting captain scripted the decisive moment of an otherwise lacklustre match against Air India in the 17th minute, when his thunderous strike ? following a dreadful mistake by former teammate Suley Musah ? beat Air India keeper Sundar Rajan all ends up. 

Mohammedan Sporting took their tally to 14 points from 10 matches, giving coach Mohammed Habib a chance to heave a sigh of relief for a while. Air India, who won the home engagement against Habibs wards by an identical margin, remained on 10 points from nine outings. 

If one takes out Patricks matchwinner and Man-of-the-Match Mohammed Mukhtars delectable runs down the wings, the hosts looked a pedestrian lot. They mostly went through the motions and, in the end, had to thank their stars for overcoming the Mumbai outfit. Air India held a clear edge over as far as creating chances were concerned, but their strike force had an off day. 

Habib posted former Mohun Bagan striker Gley Yao Rodrigue in the middle but the Togolese did nothing but engage himself in a few arguments with referee P.K. Bose. He ended up with a booking for wasting time. 

Patrick was heavily marked, yet he showed tremendous opportunism in delivering the killer punch. But what a pity there was none to translate Mukhtars efforts into goals. Towards the end, the diminutive medio even created a chance himself, but after foxing a defender and the goalkeeper, he lost balance and possession. 

After the first quarter of the match ? characterised by a midfield muddle ? Musah committed the blunder which cost his new team dearly. The Ghanaian ? who was released by Mohammedan Sporting after the Federation Cup on grounds of non-performance ? went up to thwart a Bijen Singh cross. Instead, he back-headed to Patrick and before Musah realised his mistake, the ball was already on its way to the Air India goal. 

Undaunted, Air India continued to dominate proceedings. In the 35th minute, Bashiru M. Abbas surged ahead, pouncing on a clearance from his box, but Gopal Das charged out to deny the striker. 

In the dying minutes of the first half, Soccor Voelho set Vijith Shetty clear just outside the box, but the latters chip was too feeble to beat the advancing Gopal. 

Even after the change of ends, Habibs men continued to live on the edge. Bashiru messed up a chance by playing to the gallery and Mir Farooq Hyder almost conceded an own goal. The equaliser, however, remained elusive.

 England keep tweaking fingers crossed

 Guest Column 

 Michael Atherton

 Shaun Udal has only three-Test experience 

 to boast of

 Cast your mind back four years 

 to high summer at Trent Bridge: A ball rotating furiously 

 on its axis, then gently curving, a batsman stepping out 

 to drive, and then overbalancing as the ball dipped tantalisingly 

 out of reach, the ball landing on a worn patch the size 

 of a small plate, and spinning in between bat and pad and 

 knocking back the top of off stump.

 The greatest batsman of the day, 

 Sachin Tendulkar, had been defeated and Englands spinner 

 wheeled away towards his jubilant teammates in the covers, 

 one arm raised high, with the index finger that had done 

 the damage pointing to the heavens.

 You may not remember the moment, 

 but it is an image that has stayed with me longer than perhaps 

 it might.

 It is an image for the archives, 

 an image to prove that once upon a time an England spinner 

 had what it takes to deceive a great batsman in the air 

 and spin one through his defences.

 It is still the best ball bowled 

 by an England spinner in the 21st century. The trouble is 

 that it was bowled by Michael Vaughan, a part-timer.

 Ashley Giles will almost certainly 

 be ruled out of the India tour this week, having failed 

 to recover sufficiently from his hip operation in December, 

 which means that not since the West Indies arrived in India 

 in 1983 and 1994, each time with a solitary uncapped spinner 

 (Roger Harper in 83 and Rajindra Dhanraj in 94), 

 have a team been so woefully short of spin ammunition on 

 the sub-continent.

 Shaun Udal has three Tests-worth 

 of knowledge to share with Monty Panesar and Ian Blackwell.

 The 1983 West Indians proved that 

 the absence of spin was no bar to success, hammering their 

 hosts 3-0.

 But they were one of the great 

 teams in the history of the game, and not even the most 

 ardent England supporter would argue that Stephen Harmison, 

 Andrew Flintoff, Simon Jones and Matthew Hoggard are a match 

 for Malcolm Marshall, Andy Roberts, Michael Holding and 

 Wayne Daniel.

 How has it come to pass that a 

 country with such a proud tradition of attacking, match-winning 

 spinners has been reduced to such poverty of choice?

 The 1980s was the decade when 

 the damage was done. The decline would not have been immediately 

 apparent, as the spin tradition was still being upheld by 

 excellent practitioners of the art like John Emburey and 

 Phil Edmonds, but three-day county cricket on covered pitches 

 laid the foundation for the situation English spin finds 

 itself in today.

 In 1979, the last year before 

 pitches were covered permanently, there were 18 English-qualified 

 spinners who averaged under 30 runs per wicket. (Average 

 is a better comparison than number of wickets, because of 

 the far fewer matches now played in the championship).

 Three years later, the tradition 

 of each county having at least one decent spinner was still 

 strong enough to outweigh the changed conditions: 18 England-qualified 

 spinners again averaged less than 30.

 Emburey took 77 wickets at 23.20, 

 Edmonds 80 at 22.10 and the great Derek Underwood 78 at 

 22.44.

 By the time I started playing 

 for Lancashire in 1987, three-day first-class cricket had 

 been largely reduced to a glorified one-day run chase. Both 

 teams would spar for the first two days, before a run chase 

 was set up.

 The prevailing fashion in the 

 late 1980s was for off-spinners to bowl flat at leg stump 

 with a predominantly on-side field, scarcely changing their 

 modus operandi for three-day or one-day cricket. The spinner 

 had become a run-saver rather than a wicket-taker. Attacking 

 spin bowling was a dying art.

 Such a change took time to work 

 its way through English cricket, because spinners tend to 

 have long careers. Nine of the 18 mentioned in 1982 were 

 still playing in the early 1990s. That generation, though, 

 has now died out. Last year, there were just six English-qualified 

 spinners averaging under 30.

 Last week the ECB recognised the 

 dire state of English spin bowling by appointing a guru 

 to oversee all English spinners, young and old. David Parsons 

 has a hell of a task.

 His job is not so much to coach 

 spin bowlers per se, but to overturn a quarter of a century 

 of gradual decline and neglect and to foster a culture whereby 

 spin is seen an important and valuable part of the game 

 in this country.

 The good news is that four-day 

 cricket at least gives spinners a chance to play an important 

 role (overseas spinners are now much more in demand by counties 

 than they were 20 years ago), although any recovery, as 

 with decline, is likely to take a generation or more.

 How might Parsons go about his 

 job?

 He may start by banning the term 

 mystery spin.

 The greatest spinner of all time, 

 Shane Warne, is routinely described in this country as a 

 mystery spinner, which, for a youngster, must 

 sound completely unattainable.

 In Australia they call Warne a 

 leg-spinner. 

 He bowls the traditional variations 

 of leg-spin ? a googly, a flipper and a top spinner ? with 

 an orthodox, flawless action, and he is unremittingly accurate. 

 What is so mysterious about that?

 Weve got ourselves into 

 such a state about mystery spin in this country 

 that we took Alex Loudon to Pakistan simply, it seems to 

 me, on the basis that he can bowl a doosra.

 The best off-spinner that I played 

 against, Tim May, didnt bowl a doosra 

 but he did grasp the need to vary his pace and his flight, 

 change his angle on the crease and give the ball such an 

 almighty rip that a huge, bleeding gash was routinely opened 

 on his spinning finger each time he started a spell.

 England last won in India in 1984-85 

 when the culture and practice of spin was still strong in 

 this country. Edmonds and Pat Pocock, two very traditional, 

 quality English finger spinners, played a key role in that 

 victory, taking 27 wickets between them.

 Twenty-one years later England 

 are likely to travel with three specialist spinners who 

 have three Test wickets to their names. Thats just 

 710 shy of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh.

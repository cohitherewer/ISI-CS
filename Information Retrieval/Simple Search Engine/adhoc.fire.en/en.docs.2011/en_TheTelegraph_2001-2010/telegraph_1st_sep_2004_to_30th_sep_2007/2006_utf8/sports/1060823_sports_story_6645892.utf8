The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 BCCI asked to hand over documents

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Dalmiya Case

 Calcutta: The city civil 

 court on Tuesday directed the Board of Control for Cricket 

 in India (BCCI) to hand over all relevant documents, relating 

 to the alleged misappropriation charge against Jagmohan 

 Dalmiya, by August 29. 

 The case relating to the BCCI 

 notice asking Dalmiya, its former president, to appear before 

 its disciplinary committee came up for hearing before P 

 K Sarkar, chief judge of the city civil court.

 After hearing both the sides, 

 the court order said: After receiving the said documents, 

 Dalmiya will have to give reply to the BCCI by September 

 8. If the BCCI is not satisfied with Dalmiyas reply, 

 it will enjoy the liberty to ask Dalmiya to appear before 

 the disciplinary committee.

 Appearing for Dalmiya, Gitanath 

 Ganguly argued that the BCCI had no authority to issue such 

 notification to his client as his petition challenging similar 

 notification asking him to appear before the committee on 

 July 26 was lying pending with the same court.

 Your court had passed an 

 order saying that my clients petition would be heard 

 on August 22. But, even though the case is lying pending 

 before the court, the BCCI had issued another notification 

 asking my client to appear before the committee on August 

 15, Ganguly, had submitted on August 10.

 After hearing Gangulys argument, 

 the chief judge had stayed the operation of the BCCI notification 

 till August 22, when the matter was fixed for hearing.

 Ganguly told the court on Tuesday 

 that BCCI was asking his client to appear before the committee 

 without providing relevant bank documents to him. 

 The BCCI is telling my client 

 that the documents are lying with the bank. How could my 

 client answer the queries of the BCCI committee before going 

 through the documents, Ganguly asked.

 The judge then asked the BCCI 

 counsel whether his client was ready to hand over the said 

 documents to Dalimya. 

 The lawyer, after discussing with 

 the BCCI representatives, replied that his client was ready 

 to provide the documents to Dalmiya.

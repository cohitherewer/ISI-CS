 Germany set to be shoppers stop

London: The World Cup isnt just about which country has the best team. The tournament in Germany, which kicks off 50 days from Thursday, is also a shop window for stars who dont know where they will be playing next season. 

About 25 per cent of the worlds population are expected to watch Brazil attempt to defend its title and try win its sixth World Cup, while club owners will be in the crowds hoping to snap up a big name. Some of the biggest of all may be on the move before the opening match on June 9. 

Germany captain Michael Ballack has admitted he is talking with English champion Chelsea and seems likely to disappoint Bayern Munich fans by leaving the Bundesliga. 

Thierry Henry wont give Arsenal a decision on his future until the end of a season in which hes trying to help the gunners win their first Champions League title. 

The France striker has been at Arsenal for seven seasons and has been linked with a move to either FC Barcelona or Real Madrid. He didnt want to talk about his future even when told that he owed the Arsenal fans an answer. 

According to the British papers, Chelsea striker Hernan Crespo could be leaving Stamford Bridge and returning to Italian soccer. 

Chelsea has the vast wealth of billionaire owner Roman Abramovich to spend. No player appears to be out of Chelseas range and the English champions could be among the big movers in the World Cup marketplace. 

The Blues have also been linked with AC M ilan striker Andriy Shevchenko, who will be Ukraines main threat on their World Cup debut. 

Real Madrid are another powerhouse set to miss out on a major trophy this season and are looking for new talent and a replacement coach. Zinedine Zidane could even retire after the World Cup. 

Madrid sports director Benito Floro told a radio station on Wednesday the club would be interested in signing a powerful centre forward such as Adriano and a dynamic midfielder such as Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. 

With speculation that the Ruud van Nistelrooy could be leaving Old Trafford after losing his starting place to Louis Saha, there could be changes at Manchester United, too. The Red Devils are chasing midfielders rather than strikers, however. 

Whatever position a team may need to fill, owners will likely be able to find someone in Germany. (AP)

Barcelona: Roger Federer reasserted his status on top of the sporting world on Monday by again winning the Sportsman of the Year title at the Laureus World Sports awards on a big night for tennis. 

Croatian skier Janica Kostelic took the womens prize after an unprecedented fourth Winter Olympic gold, while Federers compatriot Martina Hingis won the Comeback of the Year award, a day after her first singles title success in over four years. 

Spaniard Rafael Nadal, Federers great rival, was named Newcomer of the Year after 12 months in which the 19-year-old was crowned French Open champion and became unbeatable on clay. 

Formula One constructors Renault won the team award, offering some consolation to losing nominee Fernando Alonso, who became the sports youngest-ever champion. 

Along with Alonso, Federer beat off competition from seven-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, Brazils Ronaldinho, two-time winner Tiger Woods, and Italian motorcycle champion Valentino Rossi, who picked up a Spirit of Sport award after three fruitless years as a contender. 

Federer, who goes to the French Open on Sunday aiming to become the first man since 1969 to hold all four Grand Slams, also won the Laureus award in Estoril 12 months ago ?when he was the Wimbledon and US Open champion. 

With the Australian Open title also in his possession now, the powerful frame of Nadal is likely to be his greatest obstacle to glory at Roland Garros. 

South African wheelchair racer Ernst van Dyk, with a fifth straight win at the Boston Marathon, won the disabled sportspersons award. 

Angelo dArrigo, the Italian hang-glider known as the Human Condor who was killed in an air crash in March, was posthumously given the alternative sportspersons award. 

The King of Spain and Hollywood celebrities such as Morgan Freeman and Teri Hatcher rubbed shoulders with the likes of Australian cricketer Shane Warne and German tennis great Boris Becker. 

In a city still suffering the hangover of Barcelonas Champions League win last Wednesday, former club player and coach Johan Cruyff was presented with a Lifetime Achievement award for his contribution to football. 

The awards are decided by a jury of 40 of the greatest sportsmen and women of all time, from a shortlist put together by a panel of journalists from around the world. 

The awards are twinned with the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, a charitable venture seeking to assist the underprivileged and needy around the world.

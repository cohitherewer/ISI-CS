 Sarfraz tears into Chappell

 - PCB draws Match Referees attention to coachs comments

Karachi: Former Pakistan stalwart Sarfraz Nawaz has lashed out at Team India coach Greg Chappell for doubting Shoaib Akhtars action. According to reports in the Media here, Chappell did so in an interview to a TV channel back in India. 

Chappell is out to destroy relations between India and Pakistan... When the International Cricket Council (ICC) doesnt have a problem, who is he to question it? Chappell first caused disharmony in his own dressing room, by the way he treated Sourav (Ganguly), and now wants to severely damage bilateral relations Sarfraz told The Telegraph. 

Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, during a break in his PTV commitments, he added: The rules are clear and a coach is expected to know the protocol... Why go after Shoaib? Koi matlab hi nahin hai... 

Talking of Mohammed Asif (who has been signed by Leicestershire), he said: He doesnt need to change anything... He keeps a terrific line and is very sharp... Hed come to me last year, during the time he was dropped, and Id observed he must not get frustrated and look to performing big in domestic cricket... Im happy he took my advice. 

Asif plays for Sialkot ? holders of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. Outside the provincial competition, he turns out for National Bank. 

Sarfraz, incidentally, is of the opinion that Sachin Tendulkar is past his prime. He wasnt convincing in Faisalabad and just wasnt up to the task in both innings here... Hes over the hill... If you arent convinced, study the movement of his feet as the bowler delivers... 

Known to land in controversies almost at the drop of a hat, Sarfraz has dabbled in politics but is now into the construction business. I keep shuttling between Lahore and Islamabad, he signed off. 

Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (through manager Asad Mustafa) has drawn Match Referee Ranjan Madugalles attention to Chappells comments. We arent making an issue, but weve conveyed our feelings to Madugalle, is how a senior official put it. 

Madugalle declined to speak at length. Ive been approached informally and, so, will handle it that way... Im not going to make an announcement... 

By the way, hes returning home (Colombo) and Englands Chris Broad will be the Match Referee during the five ODIs.

 the Caribbean. 

 The venue will be the seventh new ground to host an ODI 

 in 2006. 

 The ground will also host its first Test match, when India 

 play the third Test of the series from June 22. 

 The ground hosted its first first-class match on April 21, 

 1962 when the touring Indians played a Combined Islands 

 team. The tourist won the match by 137 runs. 

 Since then, 35 first-class matches have been played here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Sports

 Chris Gayle fined

A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta: Chris Gayle on Thursday was fined 30 per cent of his match fee following a series of verbal duels during their Champions Trophy tie on Wednesday. 

Both players were called for separate hearings by Match Referee Mike Procter on Thursday. While Gayle was found guilty of a breach of C1 of the Code, failing to conduct play within the spirit of the game, Clarke was absolved of the same charge. 

What started off as banter between the two players got out of hand and Chris Gayle went over the top in his reactions, said Procter. 

We do not want robots on the field and we want to ensure players play with enthusiasm and passion. 

We saw a great deal of that during an excellent match on Wednesday but there is a line between what is acceptable and what is not and Chris crossed it.
